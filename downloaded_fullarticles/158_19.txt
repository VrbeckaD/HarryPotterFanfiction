    <p>“Screw you, Fudge,” I groan, looking at the front cover of today’s <em>Daily Prophet</em>. “Even <em>I’d</em> make a better Minister than you. And I’m only 10-years-old. You know, sometimes I wonder whether or not you’ve even got a brain in there. That would explain all the stupid decisions you make. How ’bout you just step aside and allow for someone competent to take your place? That would be the smartest decision you’d ever make in your life.”</p><p>Frustrated, I roll up the Prophet and chuck it at my window, hitting the glass with a loud <em>thud</em> and falling limply to the floor.</p><p>“Screw you, Fudge.”</p><p>I sit up on my bed, looking around my small room above Quality Quidditch Supplies in Diagon Alley. My room is a mess. It’s not that I have too much junk and not enough places to put it, it’s that I haven’t got a lot of stuff and a lot of open space to leave it. I twist my head and look at my wand, laying patiently on my nightstand. I attempt to resist the impulse to reach for it and try to keep my arm where it is. “Just because you can do magic, doesn’t mean you should,” I tell myself. But when has that ever stopped me? “Dad would appreciate your rule breaking, Willow,” I say to the room. “He was a mischief maker in his own generation. In fact, he’d be really disappointed if he came back and you’d never broken a single rule in your life.”</p><p>I snigger quietly to myself and throw my head back, reaching for my wand. I break a lot of rules. Many of the rules I break are also laws. Which is partly why I’m in a bit of trouble with the Wizarding world. Nothing too serious, of course, just serious enough to annoy the Ministry and get me on their bad side.</p><p>I raise my wand and say, “<em>Locomotor</em>,” pointing it at objects on the floor and watching them fly back to their rightful positions. There’s probably a better spell out there to clean my room, but I don’t want to go through a bunch of household cleaning spells if I haven’t got a house to use them on.</p><p>The shop owner of Quality Quidditch Supplies, Mr Volare, does everything he can to keep me out of trouble. If he sees me doing magic, he gets mad at me. ‘<em>Just because you haven’t got the Trace doesn’t mean you’re allowed to do magic</em>,’ he always tells me. But no Trace actually <em>does</em> mean magic. Of age wizards and witches don’t have the Trace and <em>they</em> can do magic. So why should I be any different?</p><p>With a sigh, I get off my bed and stand up, raising my arms and stretching. I walk groggily to a large mirror on my wall, inspecting myself. I run my fingers through my long, soft blond hair and tie it quickly into braids, long enough to reach my hips, like I do every morning. I contemplate the deep purple bags under my eyes, which won’t go away, no matter how much sleep I try to get, or at least try to get. I tilt my head up, watching my piercing grey eyes turn a stunning emerald green when the light catches them. I grin to myself and tilt my head back down so my eyes look grey again, then back up so they turn green. Not to be full of myself, but I love my eyes. They make just as little sense as anything in this wretched world does. I turn my head again, but this time to marvel my earrings, fake diamond studs that I’ve never taken off. They shimmer all the colours of the rainbow, projecting light colours on the walls.</p><p>I straighten up and check the left sleeve of my pale blue button-up shirt, making sure that it covers my entire arm from shoulder to wrist. I smooth out the wrinkles in my shirt, tucking it into my navy blue slacks. Satisfied, I grab a light cloak hanging off of my wall and pull it on. I give my room one last quick glance before heading out of my room and down the stairs to the shop, busy as ever. I find my way to the back room, where Mr Volare and one other employee are standing, poring over a large stack of papers.</p><p>“Good morning, Mr Volare.”</p><p>He jumps a little, knocking over the stack of papers. With an impatient wave of his wand, the papers float back into the neat stack they were in before. “I didn’t hear you come in, Willow! Gave me quite a scare.”</p><p>I smile and reply, “Sorry about that. But I had a question to ask you, before I do much else.”</p><p>Mr Volare looks to the employee, gives him a small nod, and walks away from the stack. “And what might that be?”</p><p>“I just wanted to know if you’d need any help with the shop today. It’d be better to know before I set off doing who knows what out on the street.”</p><p>He ponders this for a moment. “I don’t think I will, no. I haven’t yet had anyone owl in sick yet. Though it someone does, I can always just have someone else fill in their position. You needn’t worry about it today.”</p><p>I smile gratefully. “Okay. Well, I best be off. Bye!”</p><p>He returns my smile. “Bye!”</p><p>I leave the back room and head back up the stairs to my room where I pack <em>A History of Magic</em>, the <em>Daily Prophet </em>I had thrown at my window, and my bag of gold (which I really ought to refill soon) into my book bag. Before heading back out, I stop in front of my mirror, straightening out my navy blue cloak, and then I leave.</p><p>I struggle through the thick crowd of the shop towards the door. When I finally get out of the crowded shop, I take a deep breath of fresh air and stand there for a moment, relishing the outside. With one last deep breath, I fight my way through the crowded street to Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour, only a short walk from Quality Quidditch Supplies. The moment I walk inside the cool parlour, the sweet scent of ice cream fills my nostrils. I sit down at a small table in a corner and pull out the <em>Daily Prophet</em> again. I do my best not to look at the front page again, where I know I’ll stay if I start reading any of it. I scan the rest of the headlines, however, looking for something worth my time. With a laugh, I spot an article about how the Defense Against the Dark Arts position at Hogwarts has been filled. Again. I get comfortable in my seat and I start to read.</p><p>“Anything good in there today?” A voice beside me suddenly says. I look up from the Prophet to Mr Fortescue, standing in front of my table and gesturing towards the newspaper in my hands.</p><p>I set the Prophet down on the table and look up at him with a half-smile. “Not really. There’s some rubbish about how amazing Fudge is in here, but not much else. The Defense Against the Dark Arts position at Hogwarts has been filled again, though. I can’t believe the last professor quit already. The term hasn’t even ended yet.” I pause. “Do you think it’s cursed? The position, I mean.”</p><p>Mr Fortescue tilts his head up in thought for a moment. “I’m not sure whether or not it is. It might be, it might not be. Do <em>you</em> think it’s jinxed?”</p><p>I grin evilly. “Oh, I know it’s jinxed. I’m near positive of it. There’s no other logical explanation as to why the professors keep leaving after every year. I’ve thought about it and tried to find some reasoning behind it, but nothing else makes sense. Everyone wants a job, and I doubt this many people would be willing to give it up so easily all the time. And it’s not even like it’s a horrible position. The class doesn’t seem like it’d be that difficult to teach, and I doubt the students are the problem. There are other professors who have been at Hogwarts for ages. Take Dumbledore, for example. He’s always been there. And loads others have been there for a long time, too. The whole thing is rather amusing. I could go on, but I really shouldn’t be wasting your time talking about jinxes.”</p><p>Mr Fortescue smiles. Unspoken words pass between us. “Would you like your usual?”</p><p>“What? Oh, yes, please.” I watch him leave and disappear behind the counter. I pick the Prophet back up and start to read the article. It goes on and on about how the position was filled by some guy called Quirrell, who’s apparently been all over the place and found all sorts of creatures and whatnot. Mr Fortescue comes back to my table with a bowl full of apple crumble ice cream with chocolate sauce on top, my all-time favourite. I thank him and get back to the Prophet. I skim over the article for another minute or so before I become bored with it and replace it with <em>A History of Magic</em>.</p><p>I spend the rest of the day reading and eating ice cream. Not the healthiest decision I’ve ever made, but who’s going to stop me? When night arrives and Mr Fortescue starts to clean up, I drop a Galleon and a couple Sickles on my table and head back to Quality Quidditch Supplies. The shop has been closed for almost an hour, so I find Mr Volare in there alone, restocking and tidying up.</p><p>“Hello, Mr Volare.”</p><p>He looks up at me and smiles. “Willow! How was your day?”</p><p>“Pretty relaxing. I spent the whole day at Fortescue’s.”</p><p>“Sounds like a lot of fun.</p><p>“As fun as it can be.” I start to head towards the stairs before I turn back around to face Mr Volare. “Do you need any help closing up?</p><p>“I don’t believe so, no. I’m just about done, as it is. You should be off to bed, now. And please, try to sleep. Sleep does wonders.</p><p>I make a face. “I guess.”</p><p>I head up the stairs and go into my room. I change into my pajamas, still long sleeves (even though it’s basically summer). I lay down on top of my bed and lie awake for what feels like hours, staking blankly at the ceiling, until I fall into an uneasy sleep.</p>
