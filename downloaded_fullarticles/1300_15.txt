  <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong>
</p>
<p>It wasn’t ideal. Fifteen minutes prior, Draco Malfoy had appeared in her front garden with a wide-eyed and, frankly, unfocused stare. Without any conscious thought on her part, she had surprised them both by hitting him square in the forehead with the only thing she had at hand: her left shoe. The victory of a good throw—having never particularly excelled at sports—didn’t last long. With the impact of shoe to skull, his unfocused stare turned direct. His gray eyes narrowed, and he moved slowly but purposefully towards her.</p>
<p>And then—suddenly!—they were in her living room. Hermione wasn’t sure how he had gotten through the door. She had made moves to shut it on his fingers. But, everything was a bit blurred around the edges. She knew a few things. She knew they walked. No one had cast any spells. He didn’t appear to have his wand on him and she, still technically bound by the rules of underage magic, had hers tucked away in her school trunk. She touched her thigh for a moment, thinking of the wand holster she had bought. She didn’t need her wand, not now.</p>
<p>She was strangely sure she didn’t need magic to stop him. His stare was predatory, but not particularly frightening. If anything, she felt annoyed. He wasn’t chasing her, exactly. He walked forward, and she backwards like partners in some demented dance. And then they were in the living room.</p>
<p>She knew she should be afraid. She was unarmed, in the middle of a war, and her racist schoolmate had shown up in her childhood home. It had all the makings of a terrifying situation. But, as she tossed her other shoe at his chest and, for the second time that day, made contact, she was not at all afraid. It was as if something inside her expected this to happen. Maybe not in this particular fashion but she wasn’t very surprised to see her nemesis staring at her like she was a giant steak.</p>
<p>“Granger! Honestly!” Draco caught the remote she tossed at him in midair. Hermione shrugged. She picked up another remote, glad her parents had invested in a cable box. She wasn’t going to throw a lamp at him, after all. Malfoy was being frustrating but a lamp to the head? That could kill someone.</p>
<p>“Pumpkin?” Richard Granger, DDS, poked his head in from the kitchen. His face transitioned quickly between a smile and a frown, as he put down his golf bag by the door. He took off his hat, and moved further into the living room, standing between Hermione—hand poised toss another remote—and the wizard. “Is everything alright in here?”</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy sketched a quick, shallow bow to the dentist. Hermione rolled her eyes from behind her father’s back. “Draco Malfoy,” Malfoy said politely. “Mr. Granger, I am pleased to make your acquaintance.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Granger,” Dr. Granger corrected.</p>
<p>“You are?” Hermione asked, skeptical.</p>
<p>“I am, Dr. Granger,” Malfoy confirmed.</p>
<p>“Perhaps we should all sit down.” Jennifer Granger sailed in from the kitchen, holding a tray stacked with cups and a pitcher of lemonade. Richard, deferring to his wife, moved from between his daughter and the strange young man to the couch.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Granger,” Malfoy responded with another quick bow. Hermione was sure, at this point, that she was trapped in some strange dream.</p>
<p>“Dr. Granger,” Dr. Richard Granger corrected again.</p>
<p>“Doctors Granger,” Malfoy said, nodding. “Your daughter is top of her class so I am not surprised that her parents were as well. Doctors are healers, are they not?” And, so he sat down in one of the leather wingback chairs next to the couch, as if it was not strange at all for a Death Eater (Hermione presumed) to drink lemonade with a muggle. Hermione focused all her attention on the clear mark on his chest from where her slip-on sneaker, sole first, had hit him.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you delightful?” Jennifer smiled at her daughter and handed Draco a glass of lemonade. “Pardon me, but I did not catch your name.”</p>
<p>“Draco Malfoy,” Hermione answered. “He goes to school with me, and he should not be here. Why are you here?” It was Hermione’s turn to stalk forward. Draco stared at her blandly—as if he hadn’t been hit in the head with a shoe just minutes ago—and took a sip of lemonade.</p>
<p>“Granger, you know why I’m here.”</p>
<p>“She does?” Jennifer turned towards her daughter. Her blue eyes widened, inquisitively.</p>
<p>“I do not.” Hermione was lying. She was lying through her teeth. She picked up her own glass of lemonade and crossed the room to get as far away from him as possible. The minute her father entered the living room, she had known. The minute everything slowed down, she had felt it. She could feel it even now, as she tried to pretend that this moment wouldn’t be the last normal moment of her entire life. If she had to pick a last meal, it would not have been her mother’s overly sweet lemonade.</p>
<p>The grandfather clock in the entryway was the only noise for what felt like several minutes as Hermione contemplated the best way to explain whatever… this… was. Maybe she could ignore it. Maybe she could go to her room, pack her bag, and leave the country. Maybe she could change her name or sink to the bottom of the ocean or…</p>
<p>“We’re soulmates.” Draco Malfoy’s words rang through the living room as loudly as they rang through her skull. She wondered briefly if she’d hear the words even as she died. Would her ears ever stop ringing with the phrase “we’re soulmates”? Her magic, had no such compunctions, and eagerly reached out to his. His magic felt like a cool breeze, dancing just on the top of her arms, touching the back of her legs. She sighed and moved back to the couch.</p>
<p>“How romantic,” Jennifer cooed.</p>
<p>“Not romantic, Jen! They’re sixteen. They don’t know what they’re doing,” Richard shouted.</p>
<p>Jennifer sighed. “Hermione is seventeen, Richard!”</p>
<p>“Time turner, Dad,” Hermione mumbled.</p>
<p>“I love young love.” Jennifer turned towards Hermione as she settled herself between her parents. “How long have you two been dating?”</p>
<p>“We haven’t,” Hermione fairly growled. “Our magic brought Malfoy here. We haven’t much got along in the past, but he’s telling the truth.”</p>
<p>Richard Granger stared between the two. Draco sat particularly upright, his back never even nearing the high back of the seat. Seemed posh. Jen liked posh. Hell, Jen was posh. But he did not and was not. Not to mention the boy’s intensity, which was particularly focused on his daughter. Hermione, who until this summer, Richard had thought was just a normal girl—well, as normal as you could be while also being a witch—instead of someone marked for death. These days Richard’s thoughts seemed to circle around the scar that criss-crossed Hermione’s body and almost took her life. He tried not to focus on it, but it was always there in the background. The dull hum of knowing that someone had tried to kill his teen daughter. And the intensity that this teen boy’s gaze had did not speak of puppy love—of flowers and school dances. It spoke of desperation, the kind that could get someone killed. It made Richard uncomfortable. “What’s this rot?”</p>
<p>“Wizards don’t like to think of ourselves as magical creatures, Dr. Granger,” Draco responded, topping off his glass of barely touched lemonade. “But we are. And, as such, we have certain responsibilities to magic. You know Harry Potter can talk to snakes?”</p>
<p>The Drs. Granger nodded. Draco was relieved. As least Hermione had told them this much. “That is a gift from magic itself. I doubt he knows that. I doubt anyone has explained it to him. But magic gifts certain people special abilities that they are intended to use to help the entire wizarding world.”</p>
<p>“As if defeating Vold-“ Draco made a shushing noise and tapped his left arm. Hermione frowned. “Already?”</p>
<p>“My parents would have more strenuously opposed it had they known.” Draco gestured between them.</p>
<p>Hermione sighed. “We’ll have to fix that.”</p>
<p>“We’ll have to fix a great many things,” Draco agreed.</p>
<p>Richard cleared his throat loudly. “Apologies,” Draco said, inclining his head. “As I was saying, magic gifts individuals occasionally. I am one of those individuals.”</p>
<p>“And you’ve been <em>gifted</em> our daughter?” Richard asked, clearly displeased. “Hermione is not an object. Not a gift. She’s her own person.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded again. “I agree. Grang—Hermione is a very talented witch. I believe that we have been gifted this connection for a reason.”</p>
<p>Hermione sighed, picking up the story. “Malfoy and I are on opposite sides of the war.”</p>
<p>And that’s truly when hell broke loose.</p>
<p>If Hermione could do it all over again, she never would have signed her parents up for Prophet delivery. But, at eleven, she hadn’t known she’d become embroiled in a war that started years before she was born. She was even less aware that her closest friend would be a young man with vision problems who, for reasons beyond his control, was touted as The Boy Who Lived. She hadn’t known those things when they went to Diagon Alley the first time. The only thing she had known at that time was that she was a witch and she would soon be disconnected from her parents, her favorite people, for months in a world that they could neither enter of their own volition, or understand without assistance. So in a gesture of good faith and muggle-magic relations, she had signed them up for their own delivery of the <em>Prophet</em>.</p>
<p>Jennifer and Richard, upon learning that the wizarding world was filled with as many, if not a greater number, of dangers than the muggle one had wanted to withdraw Hermione from school. After her near death at the Ministry of Magic, it had taken visits from both Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape to convince her parents that she belonged at Hogwarts. Jennifer and Richard agreed, reluctantly, but signed her up for French classes, hoping that she would excel and they could make a compelling argument to send her to Beauxbatons.</p>
<p>Hermione had never failed at anything like she failed at French. At the time, Hermione was baffled. She wasn’t trying to do poorly. Honestly. But, as her magic touched Draco Malfoy’s, she felt that maybe she had been trying to fail, albeit unknowingly. Hermione shook herself out of her reverie as the shouting between her parents ceased and her father picked up a lamp.</p>
<p>“Put down the lamp, Richard. He’s clearly not trying to kill us this instant,” Jennifer Granger pointed out reasonably. Even so, she moved the tray of lemonade a few inches further from Draco. Hermione tried to hold back a smile. Her mother, even in times of great distress, had always, and would always, take her revenge on others by making things just a tiny bit annoying. Richard kept hold of the lamp, even as he brought the base to rest again on the oak side table.</p>
<p>“Hermione and I are going to end the war,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“But for whose benefit?” Jennifer asked, pouring herself the easily reached lemonade.</p>
<p>Draco smiled broadly at that. “Why, Dr. Granger, for ours.”</p>
