    <p>Chapter One : The Owlery </p><p> </p><p>We first met in a pile of ruffled feathers and in between angry screeches of dishevelled looking pygmy owls. Kan perched on my shoulder, eyes half closed, while I was was discussing the coherence of wingspan to speed level of Verreaux´s Eagle Owls with the shop owner, when a dark haired girl entered the owlery, arms full of books. Which actually wasn´t very surprising, given the new school year was about to start in a week and Diagon Alley was full of buzzing students buying their school supplies. But somehow I had the single most vivid deja vu experience of my life. Why did her face feel so familiar? I felt like I knew her from somewhere.</p><p>“... and that is why 6 ft wingspan allows for the correct power use from wind to gain speed up to 76 mph!”<br/>
“Would you excuse me for a second”, I mumbled, only half listening.<br/>
I watched her looking at a plain barred owl and reading the the short profile, that was pinned next to the cage.<br/>
“I´d rather take that barn owl over there. More extravagant for someone as pretty as you, eh?”<br/>
She turned around, raising her eyebrows.<br/>
“I´d rather go for endurance and accuracy than pretty looks, thank you very much.” And with this she then grabbed the barred owls cage handle and walked to the checkout.<br/>
“Seems like your usually reliable charm didn´t work this time!”, Kan smirked into my ear. I rolled my eyes.<br/>
“Hey, wait up!”<br/>
Her annoyed look told me, that I´d better shut up, but as usual I couldn´t help myself.<br/>
“Are you a Hogwarts student? I´ve never seen you before. But I´ve got this strange feeling that we somehow met?”<br/>
“I´m a transfer. And no. I´ve never seen you before.”<br/>
I watched her leaving the owlery when her red fox daemon suddenly turned around and examined Kan and me with a quick glance before they both left through the glass door.<br/>
“That was strange, wasn´t it?”, I asked the crow on my shoulder.<br/>
Kan tilted her head. “Somehow I´m sure that fox of her recognised us as well. Why didn´t they say anything though?”<br/>
“Dunno”. I shrugged. “But we´re going to find out, won´t we?”<br/>
“As if anything could ever stop you. But this time I´d strongly advise to just mind your own business and concentrate on your NEWT tests, will you?”</p><p>My life would have definitely been easier if I´d listened to him just this time.</p>
