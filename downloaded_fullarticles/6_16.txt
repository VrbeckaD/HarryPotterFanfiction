  <em>"One day, a knight in shining armour may find my daughter, and offer to save her from her life, her problems, her troubles. In that situation, I hope that I have raised such a girl that she smiles coolly and tells him, “No, thank you. I’ve very much got this.” Then puts on her armour and rides off into the sunset alone to save herself."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Nikita Gill, <b>Merida’s Pledge</b></em>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>The night was dark and full of terrors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Benjamin Eickel sat as close to the fire as his skin would let him before it burned. The light was a gift in such a dark place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His job was to keep watch while his fellow Aurors slept in their tents. Ten years after the war, the Auror department was tasked to round up remaining dark artefacts. Often found deep in the woods where the light from the sun barely cast through the trees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At night it was worse. The darkness was overwhelming. Even a large fire didn’t light more than a few feet. It was safe in the light.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Auror Eickel knew by now to ignore small snaps of twigs and the rustle of leaves. Bowtruckles and Doxies awoke during the night to hunt. Instead of the sounds creating a panic, it soothed his beating heart. At least there was something else that was awake. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tonight was different, though. There were no snapping twigs or rustled leaves. It was a motionless quiet. Even the branches above that would often sway in the night wind stood eerily still. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Auror Eickel felt alone. Utterly alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But at least he had his fire. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He began to open a tin of fish with shaking fingers, digging into his satchel to retrieve a spoon to feast. He often ate while the others were asleep as to not create gluttonous jealousy. His wife had armed him with enough food for a year, even if he was only gone for three months. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Damn, no spoon.” He huffed to himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Begrudgingly he stood, walking to keep himself in the fire’s light as he made his way to Auror Moorehouse’s bag. He wouldn’t miss it for the night and he would have it cleaned by his shift tomorrow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bag was hanging over the pole that Auror Rodriguez pitched to keep their cloaks dry and off the ground. The bags hung a peg higher to keep the scent of food away from wandering Hippogriffs. Reaching an arm up, he grabbed for the strap of Moorehouse’s bag, but it tumbled to the ground in a heap of cloaks and clatter of silverware. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Damn it all to hell.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a quick glance over at the tent to ensure his clumsiness did not wake the rest of his group and the light of the fire slowly burning out, he made quick work of cleaning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well now you’ve made a mess of things. Daisy will kill you in the morning.” He said to himself and he picked up a cloak soaked in mud and pebbled with debris. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he bent over, a large gust of wind shook the bole of the tree so hard Auror Eickel thought they were about to tumble down around the clearing. The fire was blown out entirely, a puff of smoke in his wake. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Curiously, even as the wind subsided, the clearing felt cold. An unnatural cold that made him sweat and his fingertips tingle with the sudden change in temperature. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A forest in the July heat of Brazil should not feel this brisk. Something was wrong. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mess forgotten, Auror Eickel made his way to the opening of his colleague’s tent. Throwing back the thin fabric, he uttered a small </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lumos </span>
  </em>
  <span>to emit a bright, white light from the tip of his wand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Covers pulled back, pillows fluffed as if no one had been laying on them for hours. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>But I was just outside, where could they have gone? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Auror Rodriquez? Auror Moorehouse? This isn’t funny, I’ll have you know!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But there was no answer. Not even the snap of a twig. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With shaking hands, he made his way from the clearing. No man left behind, the oath he swore some years ago when he became an Auror. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His wife had been so proud, her belly swollen with their daughter as he retrieved his Auror cloak and badge. She was four now. The spitting image of him. He would return for her. But he couldn’t leave his team behind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Daisy! Matthew! Stop fucking around, yeah?” His tone was serious, but the trembling hand that held his wand ahead of him showed his true fear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, finally, a twig snapped behind him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Turning on his heel, a scream just at his lips fell flat when he saw the familiar dark curls and blonde crop of Daisy and Matthew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merlin, you fuckwits scared me half to death! Head Auror March will be hearing about this when we get back and then--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His light finally hit their faces. Staring back were blue eyes that seemed almost neon in the bright light of his wand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, Daisy was lunging. Her nails dug into the flesh of his neck, but he was quick on his feet to pull back and fall against a tree. Whatever this was, it wasn’t Daisy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sounds out of her mouth were feral and screeching. Matthew Moorehouse was next to pounce. He grabbed Eickel’s ankle with a strong grip. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Stupefy!” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing. Daisy’s hands were in his hair, over his neck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Petrificus Totalus!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing. Matthew’s breath was hot against his stomach. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Avada Ka-”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Daisy’s long talons ripped into the soft flesh of his jugular, pulling his tongue from the hole it created in his neck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His last thoughts were of his wife, round with his child. Smiling, proud. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>+++</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The rise to power had not been an easy one for Draco. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first two years after the war were of exile and contempt from the wizarding community. More than once, he would notice someone had slipped a potion into his food or be caught with a hex that left him bloodied and raw. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t what he was used to; being weak, powerless, vulnerable. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His mother was long dead, having committed suicide after Draco’s failed mission from Voldemort.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> His father, unfortunately, had remained alive and overbearing. He drank aged whiskey by the handle and wasted away into himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You killed my wife,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>He would tell Draco, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“You killed my Narcissa.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Outside, he was a monster. In his own home, he was a killer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He needed to escape. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the dead of night, while the house-elves slept and Lucius had drunk himself into comatose, Draco swept into the forest that surrounded the manor with only the clothes on his back and a few spares of shirts and underwear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He apparated to a dock where water rippled under dark wooden boats that ruled the seas. His mother had taken him there as a child to escape the manor and just to watch the boats drift into the horizon and vanish. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Where are they going?” </span>
  </em>
  <span>He had asked her.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Somewhere better.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s where he wanted to go. Somewhere better. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hid among canned food and preservatives, living off their sticky contents for the journey. By the time they arrived at the shores of San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, his hands were stained berry red and pruned with the amount of suckling he did. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ship’s crew paid him no mind, even though he was quite a sight as his pale skin contrasted with the darkness of theirs from weeks on deck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He spent the next few weeks living off the land’s fruits and nuts. Walking miles a day, never settling in one place for more than a few hours to rest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His thighs became rock hard and his skin burned then peeled away to golden flesh. Perhaps the first time a Malfoy ever tanned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He happened upon a cave in the highlands of Guarida Del Escala. Red rocks formed into a slanted cavern and after weeks in the sun, he welcomed the shade. He could tell the cave had been untouched, the sand sat still and flat, no feet had happened upon it to create craters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cave was long, narrow, and the sand felt denser the deeper he drifted into it. The sweat on his brow cooled away to sticky residue on the hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The farther he travelled into the cave, kicking up undisturbed sand that stuck to the fine hairs of his exposed calves, the colder it became. Which wouldn’t have been an odd climate for a cavern, if not for the flames. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Giant, blue flames that licked the sides of the cave’s end. Each flame tip flickered a deep pattern of red and yellow before disappearing into the cracks of the rocks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Below it, he saw what the flames had been protecting. Large, scaled eggs he had recognized from diagrams at Hogwarts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dragons. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gold letters flickered the walls, only highlighted by the flames that burned a circle around the eggs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perzys daor ossēnagon nykeā zaldrīzes.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fire cannot kill a dragon. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He moved farther into the cave, towards the flames. They grew higher with each step, surrounding him in blue waves and reached towards him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fire engulfed them. He and his eggs. Swirling into the cracks of the red rocks and spitting ash onto him. He couldn’t feel it. He reached for the eggs, cradling them in the crooks of his arms like newborn babes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He imagined this is how a father felt the first time he held his children. A base instinct to protect. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, the flames burned higher. A thick wall of blue that shimmered each individual scale of the eggs. His eggs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It burned off his clothes, scorched the untouched sand. The cave was collapsing around him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could feel none of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fire cannot kill a dragon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then, when the sand was black with ash and the cave had fallen around him, he stood with three dragons nuzzling at his body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fire cannot kill a dragon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>+++</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whiskey both tickled and burned his throat on the way down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been a gift from Blaise after a particularly successful campaign run. It tasted of peanuts and fell under his tongue in thick puddles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Through his window he watched his dragons claw at each other with sharp talons, rolling through patches of dirt that muddied otherwise perfect scales. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>To onlookers, it may have been quite the terrifying sight: dragons, huge and menacing, brawling. He knew the difference. His children were playing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pax, The Peaceful. He was the baby. The last to hatch and the smallest of them all, not that it meant much. He still towered over Draco by at least six feet. You could often find him basking in the sun, the yellow of his belly upturned, his grey wings tucked tightly under him, and huffing gently while his siblings played.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Roark, The Tyrant. His firstborn. He gleamed garnet and gold and his teeth showing through sneers that reminded Draco of himself. He was menacing with thick horns that lined his back and puffs of fire and smoke that burned through his nostrils. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cissa, The Queen. His only girl. Named after his mother, but baring no similar qualities other than that. While Narcissa was gentle and small, Cissa ruled the skies with thick black scales that glittered purple in the sun and wide eyes like ice. She was the largest of them all. The most powerful. His girl. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He watched as his dragons danced, swiping paws at the ground and hissing fire at each other before tumbling, wrapping their wings around their bodies and rolling through the mud. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pax is getting quite good with his fire,” A gentle voice called out through his door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>From the corner of his eye he spotted stark blonde hair, similar to his own, but barring no familial resemblance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Luna,” He greeted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Minister Malfoy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He snorted, “Just Draco to you, Luna. You know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hummed an understanding and met him at his side to peer at the dragons below them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, Just Draco, you should be proud of your boy. He’s starting to get lines of fire instead of just balls.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was nothing, really. I just caught some wrackspurts in his ear distracting him. He’s more focused now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was. Timid, shy Pax was now rearing back against his brother. Pounding a paw at the ground. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Let’s play. </span>
  </em>
  <span>No longer keen to merely laying aside in the sun. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If he was a different man, he might have cried in pride. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cissa is getting big, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hummed and set his glass down to refill. He tipped his head towards her and she shook her head. She never partook, but it was polite to ask. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Restless, too. She’s been picking fights more than usual.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can take her to the North with me when I go. We have lots of roaming space for her to fly. I wouldn’t mind. It’d be nice to not have to light my own fires for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He raised a brow. “You’re a witch, Luna, it’s surely not that hard.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hummed again in a way only Luna could. “I find lighting it the muggle way makes it warmer. Don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It’s all the same fire. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He thought but instead gave a tight smile, “Sure, Luna.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anyway, I’ll be heading up there tonight to visit my dad. I just came to give you this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She handed him three thick vanilla envelopes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How is your father, Luna?” He asked, rifling through the notes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shrugged lightly, but her shoulders looked heavy. “Ill. I’ve had Caterina keep an eye on him while I’m away. He’s an old wizard, Draco.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked up, “You can always take time off, Luna. It’s well deserved.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She waved a hand in the direction of the files. “There are much more pressing matters than me staying in the north.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Benjamin Eickel</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Matthew Moorehouse </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Daisy Rodriquez</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He pinched the bridge of his nose. “More?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They were in Brazil. Their wands were still at the campsite.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What kind of fucking Auror doesn’t take their wand with them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I reckon ones who didn’t need them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He arched a brow but didn’t look up from the images in the files. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The only thing askew from the campsite was an overturned coat rack with some food cans scattered. More pictures showed wet, red grass laid out flat. As if someone had been attacked and dragged. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The blood is Eickel’s,” Luna offered, peering over his shoulder. “His wand was found right by it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco huffed. “He had his bloody wand and couldn’t defend himself?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luna was silent, which was odd for her. She usually always had an answer for things like this. Perhaps wrackspurts had gotten into </span>
  <em>
    <span>his </span>
  </em>
  <span>ears and distracted him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he looked over to her, she had her brows furrowed thoughtfully. There were no lines on her forehead as if she had never, not even once, done that before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Something the matter?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pursed her lips in a tight pout and looked at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco gulped. She was really quite beautiful, with silver hair and bright eyes. And while she had many of the qualities of a pureblood wife; the elegance, the grace, the innocent joy, she lacked the qualities that Draco found he required in a partner; strength, and passion, and ruthlessness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know about White Walkers, Draco?” Her breath puffed against his face like a baby dragons. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Doesn’t every magical child?” He laughed, closing the files. “Our first scary story to ensure we don’t sneak out of bed at night?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Little witch, little witch, </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What do you see?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I see the White Walkers</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Coming after me.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Little witch, little witch, </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What do you hear?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I hear the Whites </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>And they’re coming near.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Little witch, little witch, </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why do you shout?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You got out of bed</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>And the Walker’s have come out. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, well, I have a theory they have much to do with this,” her movements were so gentle it was like she floated around the desk to prop herself into one of his chairs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Float. No, he wanted a woman who would stomp. Who would stampede. Who would demand the chair move to </span>
  <em>
    <span>her. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Luna, love… You know I adore how quirky--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not being quirky, Draco.” She interrupted him. Her tone wasn’t angry, wasn’t accusing. Just stating a fact. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” He said slowly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re very much real. My dad said he’s seen them in the forests of the north.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm, doing what?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hunting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For?” He quirked a brow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Magic,” She said, as if it were the simplest explanation in the world. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As children, the tales of White Walkers were what you listened to when your parents cast a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lumos </span>
  </em>
  <span>on their wands, tucking you and them under the covers to secure yourselves in the darkness. It was a tale followed by giggles because what a load of bullshit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Undead men that never had to sleep, never had to eat. Just kept walking. Always hunting. They would eat magical little boys and girls to absorb their power. Draco did not know of any child that dared to sneak out of bed after those stories. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theo had told him, in confidence, he had often wet himself instead of crawling out to use the bathroom lest the White Walkers take his magic. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then children grow up. You realize that while there are no White Walkers. There are other evils that make you stay in bed and wet yourself. Like Lucius Malfoy, Like Voldemort, and for some, like Draco. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re not real, Luna. It’s… It’s a child’s story. A myth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She bit her cheek thoughtfully and stared out at Pax, who had flown just high enough where the grey scales of his back touched the window’s ledge. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So what do you suggest it is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rubbed his face with the palm of his hand. “Fuck if I know--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So it could be White Walkers, is what you’re saying.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shot her a knowing glare, “This isn’t wrackspurts, Lovegood. You’re talking about an army of the undead targeting Aurors--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not just Aurors, Draco, </span>
  <em>
    <span>wizards. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Magic. Aurors are just easiest to get to because they venture out for missions.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco scoffed, “So what? A few wizards disappear--”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“649.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He paused. “Pardon?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“649 wizards, that we know of. I had Blaise contact the Ministers in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. They’ve all had mysterious disappearances of their Aurors based in Europe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t mean--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My dad has never lied to me in my life, Draco. If he says he saw them, I believe him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco turned around to look at his dragon. Pax was fluttering gracefully now, high into the horizon. He reminded Draco so much of Luna. Trusting, wistful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Luna--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You trust me, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her eyes were wide and childish, yet there was something wise behind them. Like she knew something no one else did. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” He repeated, “Say… Say you’re right. There’s an army of undead men killing wizards in Europe.” He turned back to face Luna, her face with a small smile. “The ministry would do nothing without proof.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luna stood, smoothed out her patterned skirt and gave Draco a bright smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leave the burden of proof to me, Minister. It’s why you hired me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then as quickly as she appeared, she was gone. She always made it a point to never say goodbye. Draco turned back to watch his dragons play.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>+++</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The north was fogged and damp during the nights of October. Luna’s dad, as warden of the North, ensured that all energy sources were clean and used in small quantities so that magic light pollution did not disturb the glow of the moon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, even through the fog you could see it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Xeno Lovegood was a proud man, a proud father. His daughter was of the highest ranks in the Ministry. She worked to better the lives of all creatures, true to her nature of the wild north. And still, she always made time to visit her ailing father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, moon of my life.” He went to raise himself off the chair as Luna unwrapped the scarf from her neck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His knees trembled from the lack of muscle around his calves to hold him up and he toppled back into the cushions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh no, Daddy, you stay! I’ll come to you.” She gave him a kiss on the cheek. "Hello, Lady." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gave her father's dire wolf a stroke of the head and she gave a soft sound, nuzzling her muzzle into Luna's hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you like some tea?” She asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you speak with the minister?” He ignored her question and she gave a breathy giggle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s just Draco, daddy. You know him.” He waved his hand. “Yes, just before I came here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sighed and watched the moon cut through fog from thick glass windows. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t believe me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Xeno tapped her hand lightly with his own. “Well, we were expecting that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gazed back at him, keeping her shoulders turned towards the window. “He wants proof.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Xeno nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had spoken about this before she had left the last time. Over 400 Aurors were killed and not a trace of them left, save for their wands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before his ailment had broken down his muscle and weakened his bones, Xeno was an avid gatherer in the North. Wild berries, shrubs, herbs. He would trek through the wilderness to bring them home. It’s how the North stayed so self-sufficient. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Goppelberries only blossomed during the night. They opened up to puckered berries that were sweet and rich and very valuable for medicine making. Caterina, the northern nurse, had requested a handful for wizard flu season and Xeno spent the evening rummaging for them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>These particular berries were sensitive to the blue light of a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lumos </span>
  </em>
  <span>and thus he opted to bring a gas lantern instead, </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He found them nestled deep in a pile of shrubs. While bending to pick them up, he was met with the sight of a tattered leather book. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly glancing up, the lantern flame licked the blue, icy face of something that could only be described as dead. It reached out for him and in a panic, Xeno threw the only thing he could; his gas lantern. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Piercing shrieks filled the air as the White crumbled, failing to collect its magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew there had to be more. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He forbade the children from leaving their homes after dark. There was no more Goppelberry foraging. Lest others be taken by a strange fate. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Luna had come home, up to her ears in paperwork from deceased Aurors who happened to disappear with everything </span>
  <em>
    <span>except </span>
  </em>
  <span>their magic, he knew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were getting stronger, wilder. Larger. An army. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll give him proof.” He assured her. “Help me up, yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gave a tight smile. One that said </span>
  <em>
    <span>I don’t want to do this, but I need to </span>
  </em>
  <span>before grabbing hold of him. In the dead of night, with one arm slung over her shoulder, they walked to the edge of the forest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In her other hand, a gas lantern. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At their feet, Lady, his loyal dire wolf. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, Luna. You… You go sit on the porch. You can watch from there. Lady will help you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Daddy..” Her voice cracked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He kissed her forehead lightly, trying not to put all his weight on her, but his knees shook persistently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For the greater good, moon of my life. I’ll be just fine. Lady won’t let me die, will you girl?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The wolf whined and he chuckled lightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go,” He urged her. “Let me do this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gave a slight nod before becoming Lady to follow.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the porch steps, she watched the moon cut through the fog. Illuminating the dew of the grass her father laid on. Waiting. Watching. Waiting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hoping they’d take the bait. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hoping they wouldn’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clutching the lantern. </span>
