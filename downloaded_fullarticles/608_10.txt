    <p>Dear Reader,</p><p>Before I start writing my account of this story, I just want you to know that this story is 100% real, every last bit of it. You’ve probably heard the stories in the halls, false accounts of how I landed with twins at 17 years old. You’ve probably heard the rumors of who the father is, but my question to you is that if I told you who the father is would you believe me? I was told the man was unlovable; this story was made to prove those tales wrong, because that man is gone now, and I would do anything to keep his memory alive. I wish people would remember him as he was, a great man, and not a dark dungeon bat, or whatever you call him.</p><p> </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p> </p><p>Evelyn Owen</p>
