  <em>Roses and tulips then daisies and lilies then hearts and swirls then-</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"Harry! Are you even listening?" one of his best friends, Hermione looked at him exasperated as though she had been trying to get his attention for a while. In her defense she probably was.</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, 'Mione." He smiled at her shyly. "It's after 4. They're in class again."</p><p> </p><p>"Who's in class again?" She asked confused.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yeah. I forgot to- well about a month ago my soulmate or whatever joined this self improvement art class. They wrote the name on their arm and I looked it up... Anyway, basically they draw or doodle over scars that they have to show that they can still love themselves."</p><p> </p><p>"That <em>does</em> sound really relaxing, but it <em>doesn't</em> explain why you weren't listening. You're going to fail chemistry if you never get the formulas-"</p><p> </p><p>Harry held out his arm before she could finish so that she could watch the confident lines curve off and become flowers and animals and other shapes that soon covered Harry's entire forearm.</p><p>She looked almost as enraptured as he did as she watched the line curved across his forearm into flowers and swirls.</p><p>"Those are beautiful, Harry," she said in awe.</p><p> </p><p>"I know..." he spoke quietly with a small smile on his face.</p><p> </p><p>"It's nice that you're accepting the whole soulmate thing. Ron and I are still trying to...work through it."</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughed at that. Work through it was a nice way of putting it. Her and Ron had been tearing each others heads off for years because they had no reason not to. The soulmate conversation had never come up, but when they all ended up at the same university it was getting harder and harder not to discuss it.</p><p>"Well I have to get going, but we'll pick you up for school tomorrow, right?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded at her.</p><p> </p><p>"Absolutely."</p><p> </p><p>"Alright then. Don't forget, okay?" She stood from the small table in the library and brushed her skirt off before heading towards the door. Once she walked out Harry began packing his things.</p><p> </p><p>It's not that he was bad at chemistry per say, he just didn't get what was so special about it. The different mixes and compounds didn't make sense to him, and he was fine with that.</p><p>He sat watching the flowers spawn for another hour until they eventually stopped. When nothing new appeared for a while he stood and ordered a coffee to go before heading out the door. As he walked down the street he noticed a guy walking towards him with his head down and an angry look on his face he made sure to cross the street before he could run into the muttering blonde.</p><p> </p><p>

  <em>Don't be late again!!!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy was having a shitty week. Even before he lost his favorite pen. And his soulmate's lack of paper wasn't his concern. Whoever she-he-<em>they </em>were could (and would) wait until he found his damned pen.</p><p>He had class today! Thursdays were the only day he had free for things his father would call unbecoming. He could almost hear his voice now.</p><p>"Finger painting!? You've blown your savings on finger painting?"</p><p> </p><p>Draco sighed. He really could hear his father's voice. Thursdays were also the only days his parents saw fit to sit and intrude in his flat for tea.</p><p>"Father, it isn't finger painting. I'm paying tuition to get a degree in art. Today is more of a volunteer class, everything is free and I get to work through some things..."</p><p> </p><p>"First the tattoo and now <em>this</em>!? It seems like the only thing you're <em>working through </em>is your inheritance!"</p><p> </p><p>Draco rolled his eyes, but smiled as his hand, stuffed into the cushions of his couch, finally gripped onto his pen. He pulled it out with a flourish and almost immediately began writing on his arm.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>How about you find a pad of paper, love.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Sorry. This was easier.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He chuckled and moved over to the sink to wash off his side of the conversation, it was all he could do.</p><p>"Father, Mother." He smiled at each of them before grabbing his mothers hand and kissing her knuckles. "I would love to stay and chat, but I really must go. I believe you can show yourselves out."</p><p> </p><p>With another 100 watt smile he gripped the pen tighter and made a break for the door before jumping in his car and making his way towards the recreation center for his drawing spa. It was already 3:45. He looked down at his arm and smiled. He hoped his soulmate wasn't running late too, before speeding the rest of the way through town.</p>
