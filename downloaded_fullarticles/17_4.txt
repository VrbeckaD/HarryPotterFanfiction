    <p>Gellert looked up from the dark ball of energy to see his partner stand there with an odd twinkle in his eyes. He knew all of Albus' twinkles. This was the 'I am going to convince you to follow my mad plan' twinkle. Gellert raised an eyebrow and Albus had the decency to blush. It was a wonder that he could make the greatest light wizard of all time blush like a teen before him and he revelled in it. Albus was his one saving grace no matter what he spouted sometimes about Albus destroying his career as a dark lord.</p><p>"I thought you were out recruiting dunderheads to attend that insipid school of yours," said Gellert.</p><p>"I was," said Albus sighing.</p><p>Gellert looked at Albus impatiently.</p><p>"I met this boy-</p><p>"Don't tell me I have to become a genocidal megalomaniac again” </p><p>It was Albus' turn to roll his eyes as he got to Gellert and took his hand. </p><p>"He is 11 and my new student," said Albus.</p><p>Gellert looked at him.</p><p>"He is the last Gaunt, the Slytherin heir," said Albus. Gellert sighed.</p><p>"I see and that has you worried," said Gellert.</p><p>Albus told him everything that happened in the orphanage. </p><p>"There is cause for worry," said Gellert.</p><p>"I went to Trelawney after that," said Albus.<br/>
Gellert looked at him.</p><p>"It is not good, Gellert. I - he will turn to be the deadliest dark lord in the history of the earth. He is such a small boy, too fragile to grow into a - he makes Horcruxes," said Albus, worried.

</p>
<p>"But that is just one future," said Gellert.</p><p>"Which is what I wanted to talk to you about," said Albus and looked at Gellert.</p><p>"You want to take him in," said Gellert.</p><p>Albus looked at him worried. He hoped Gellert wouldn't object. </p><p>"Fine, we will take him in," said Gellert after much thought.</p><p>Albus smiled and hugged Gellert who brought his arm around him. Gellert was so glad that he stopped his power trip when he did. He remembers Albus walking into Nurmengard one day. He had simply thrown a glare his way and occupied a room in the house. He would never kick Albus out of his house and then, he watched as his followers showed the same respect to Albus that they did to him, well, the sane ones.</p><p>Lestrange and Albus became friends and he convinced her to go back to her muggle man. He had been furious and finally confronted Albus who just sat there calmly sipping a tea inside his shield as he threw curses left and right. Nothing deadly, he can never curse Albus like that. He may not have loved Albus as he did but he knew that Albus' love for him was true. He can never hurt the one person who actually loves him on this miserable earth.</p><p>After he was done cursing, he had looked at Albus in fury demanding answers.</p><p>"Alas, I didn't like seeing that lovely woman hanging around you much when she has a perfectly fine muggle boyfriend and a wonderful family to go back to," Albus said.</p><p>Gellert was shocked. He just looked at Albus who was looking at him challengingly.</p><p>He realised that Albus did not think he was capable of doing the evil he is aiming to commit. Or at least Albus thinks, he won't. And, Albus Dumbledore was jealous. He felt threatened.</p><p>Gellert had looked at Albus who glared at him and all Gellert could do was grab Albus and kiss him.  Rest is history. He pleaded guilty of all the charges one year later and had a prison term of one year, where Albus found a way to be with him while as far as the rest of the wizarding world know he was on a trip. He was on house arrest another five years. He was now thankful that he did not become a mass murderer. He was so very thankful.</p><p>They were both 45 now. Very young among wizards. Not even middle age. They had the health and wealth to bring up a child. </p><p>"We are not turning him into a dark arts prodigy," said Albus as if he can read Gellert.</p><p>"Well, fine, best of both," said Gellert.</p><p>"That I can agree with," said Albus looking at Gellert.</p><p>"He didn't like me much. But you, on the other hand, he will adore," said Albus, a bit sadly.</p><p>"Well, I didn't like you much in the beginning either, now look where we are," said Gellert.</p><p>------------</p><p>The journey back to the Wool’s orphanage was not difficult, except both men wore suits knowing that they will have to meet muggle authorities.</p><p>Mrs Cole was not a bad woman. She was kind and caring in her own way. Gellert was not impressed with the building. The other children playing around looked sick and starved. He sighed. He had enough wealth as it is that generations can not work and live like kings. He was richer than the Malfoys or any other posh European.</p><p>They waited for Mrs Cole to take in the depth and seriousness of their demand as she sat there shocked.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Tom scowled. He knew he was special. It was these stupid people who did not see it. At least people in this new school will see him for what he is, a powerful wizard. He did not like the professor much. The man was looking at him with something akin to suspicion. However, the thought of coming back to this place where no one understands him for another few years was a terrible thought. He hated these kids here who laughed at him, made fun of him.</p><p>“Tom, you have two visitors,” said Mrs Cole, with a small smile.</p><p>Tom was surprised. Till yesterday, he did not have any visitors and all of a sudden, there are two more.</p><p>Tom followed her downstairs.</p><p>One was Mr Dumbledore. The other man was looking at him and Tom felt like the man was looking through him.</p><p>“Tom,” smiled Dumbledore.</p><p>“What happened professor?” he asked with trepidation. Were they going to deny him a place.</p><p>“We are here with an offer for you,” said the other man.</p><p>“Who are you,sir?” asked Tom.</p><p>“Gellert, Gellert Grindelwald,” said the man.</p><p>“What is the offer?” asked Tom. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Dumbledore use the wand and soon it was as if Mrs Cole was not part of the conversation even though she was standing there.</p><p> </p><p>“You are new to the wizarding world and traversing it is going to be difficult, especially a brilliant youngling like you. I and Albus, we are looking to adopt you, if you would let us,” said Gellert. Albus rolled his eyes at the man. He looked every bit as charming as he did when they were 16 and the man convinced him of the greater good.</p><p>Tom was shocked. Two things, no everything Grindelwald said shocked him.</p><p>“What do you want in return?” asked Tom, because there was always a price. Nothing was ever given to him for free.</p><p>“Nothing. Just let us pamper you a bit, let us take care of you and do things for you,” said Gellert.</p><p>“I can take care of myself,” said Tom stubbornly.</p><p>“That may be. But, having two adults is a bonus,” said Gellert.</p><p>“He doesn't like me,” said Tom nodding to Dumbledore.</p><p>Albus was shocked.</p><p>He walked over to the child who was looking at him suspiciously.</p><p>“I am sorry if I made you feel that way. As a young kid with so much control over your magic you did unsettle me a bit. I have no dislike for you. In fact, I would like it if you will agree to be our son,” said Dumbledore.</p><p>“Can two men have-” Tom looked uncertain.</p><p>“In wizarding world? Yes. We do not discourage same sex relationships because only a relationship of love can strengthen the wizards's core. Being homophobic will be detrimental to the magical society,” said Dumbledore.</p><p>“Interesting, they call them fags here and even kill them. I have heard,” said Tom.</p><p>“Well, sad things, these muggles,” sneered Gellert. </p><p>“Gellert,” said Albus sternly.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, all are human beings who deserve to live yadayada,” scowled Gellert and looked at Tom.</p><p>“They can do whatever they want, live or die. But it's not like I have to care about them,” said Gellert and sighed. Tom's eyes lit up. Inside the deep dark hollowness in the boy's eyes there was a fire of elation. There was someone he could relate to. </p><p>Albus looked between the two and wondered what he was getting himself into. </p><p>Tom looked at Albus and saw the exasperated look and smirked.</p><p>“Yes, I would like to be adopted,” said Tom.</p><p>Gellert and Albus looked at each other.</p><p>They relieved Mrs Cole from the distraction charm and did the primary paper filings.</p><p>Albus looked at Tom and smiled.</p><p>“We will come in the morning and take you on an outing to the wizarding areas,” said Albus.</p><p>Tom nodded trying not to show his excitement.</p><p>“Also, we brought you an owl. It's Albus’. You can use him till we get you a new one,” said Gellert. Albus explained how owl post worked to Tom and then both men hid the owl cage with charms in Tom's room so that only he can see it. </p><p>If Tom was bewildered,he did not show it.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Gellert looked at Albus as they walked into their house.</p><p>“You were right,” said Gellert sighing as he sat down, face on his hand.</p><p>“You are upset,” said Albus sitting down next to him.</p><p>“He- He is way too young to have such darkness in him. The upbringing is abominable. Is that how they treasure kids among muggles,” said Gellert.</p><p>“There are a lot of children there,” said Albus.</p><p>Gellert nodded looking thoughtful.</p><p>----------------</p><p>Tom sat staring at the cage, wondering if it was all a dream. He thought the professor hated him. He was still not sure. However, there was no denying it, it is true. They were here. And the Grindelwald man, he was okay.</p><p>----------------</p><p>Tom was surprised when the men did come to pick him up as promised. He dressed quickly and got down. Both men desired to spare his pride and did not ask him the obvious. Did he not think that they would come.</p><p>“Where are we going?” asked Tom.</p><p>“We thought, exposing you to magical world little by little is the best way to go rather than excite you with all the fuss of diagon alley,” said Albus.</p><p>“It's Appleby, a small wizarding settlement. They have a quidditch team,” said Gellert. Albus chuckled. Not many knew that Gellert absolutely adored quidditch. Among the English teams, he liked the Appleby Arrows which is why this is their first destination.</p><p>“What is quidditch?” asked Tom giving them a look which said old men are crazy. </p><p>Gellert explained as Albus listened amused.</p><p>“And Appleby is one of the best teams to ever play- Gellert went on.</p><p>“Ahahah, let's not corrupt him and cloud his judgement. I am sure he can figure out the better team for himself,” said Albus. Tom puffed out his chest at that which both men noticed. It was a small victory though it came unintentionally. Appleby's shopping area was small, but still had so many wonders to keep Tom interested.</p><p>“I think we should buy him Bathilda's book first,” said Gellert watching the kid who was watching the moving photographs with barely concealed awe.</p><p>“Good idea,” said Albus and walked into the book store as Gellert kept watch. Gellert watched as little Tom took in every simple detail of the village. He was looking surprised at the crowd moving in the far end of the street.</p><p>Albus was back with the gift. Tom walked over to them with a lot of questions.</p><p>“We will have lunch and discuss them?” asked Albus.</p><p>Tom nodded. The soon to be family of three sat around and ordered food. Tom was hesitant but ordered a wizarding meal.</p><p>After the lunch and dessert that followed, Tom fired questions left and right. Both men answered them patiently.</p><p>“So, what do you think about watching a quidditch match live?” asked Albus.</p><p>Tom was not sure if he wanted to see it. But he needed to see it just to know about everything in the wizarding world. Be it quidditch.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>All three walked to the ground and Tom could feel the magic around the two grown men. It was as if everyone got their attention deflected off them.</p><p>Tom however focussed on others. He saw all sorts of people wearing ‘robes’. Some of them really seemed silly. He was looking forward to wearing suits as a grown man.</p><p>“Most Appleby fans and wizards living in this area  agree that the Arrow's most glorious hour, was of their 1932 defeat of the Vratsa Vultures in a sixteen-day match, earning the European Cup for the only known time,” said Gellert as they stepped in.</p><p>“16 days?” asked Tom and was soon given answers by them. Tom must say he liked the game. Especially he liked the beaters. The way they smash the bludgers showed so much power. However, it was the sneaky seekers who caught his attention. They are cautious, cunning observers, just like Tom. He wouldn't mind trying to be a seeker. It will be a challenge to him.</p><p>----------------</p><p>Tom was on his second visit to the wizarding world the next day. They went to Ottery St Catchpole. Tom saw how wizards were living. He could hear the sound of kids even from the hill as he looked at a small house tucked in another hill.</p><p>“Ah, the Weasley's. Septimius is going to join you in your class,” said Albus.</p><p>“He is going to be like all others,” said Tom and turned away. He was not going to get his hopes up.</p><p>“Maybe, Maybe not. But you will have friends my child. No son of Gellert Grindelwald would fail to charm people. See, I have Albus doing my bidding,” said Gellert. Tom was almost amused seeing the exasperated look Albus was giving Gellert. </p><p>However, it was the use of the word son that left Tom silent for the rest of the trip. As they dropped him back at the orphanage, Tom looked at Albus.</p><p>“What is your favourite quidditch team?” asked Tom.</p><p>“Puddlemere United,” said Albus.</p><p>“Can we see them play next?” asked Tom.</p><p>“Wow, played you right. Okay, we can but that is only next week,” said Gellert and ruffled Tom's hair earning himself a glare. Grindelwald  just winked at the furious boy.</p><p>---------------</p><p>They had said that they will be busy the following few days and to write to them if there was anything he needed. Tom was feeling so suffocated in the room. He wanted to be out there in Appleby or in Ottery St Catchpole or the numerous other places where he can just blow out his anger and no one will call him a freak. He would never admit it, but he was feeling a little scared of being left behind. </p><p>He took a parchment and wrote.</p><p>Respected Mr Grindelwald and Mr Dumbledore,</p><p>I have finished reading Hogwarts A History, I need something more challenging. </p><p>Tom</p><p>There that did not give away anything.</p><p>--------------</p><p>Gellert gave tea to a very tired Albus who was back from a mission for the stupid ministry. He hated it when they used Albus for his power. Ofcourse, Gellert would never leave him alone. The ministry fools did not know that he has ways of remaining invisible that fly above their radar.</p><p>They saw the owl flying in and both cast worried glances at each other. They took it and Gellert almost smiled reading it.</p><p>“Our ward is missing us,” said Gellert handing over the letter to Albus who smiled.</p><p>“I was thinking, we should give him different perspectives of history. The old and the modern,” said Albus.</p><p>“Yes and then about the other races,” said Gellert. They got five books the next day. Two were history books. The next one's were about werewolves, goblins and house elves.</p><p>“That should do,” said Gellert approvingly. They were buying it rather than borrowing him books because they wanted Tom to keep every book he read and treasure the knowledge and obviously because they could afford it.</p><p>“We can't keep on living in the two room cottage when we have another person living with us. When we are making a family,” said Albus.</p><p>“True. I was thinking, we can make something new. Your house gives you bad memories and mine- well, it is a castle that brings back by foolish days. Let's make something in my land in Ilkley,” said Gellert.</p><p>Albus and Gellert sent all the books to Tom with a detailed letter on what happened. That Albus was needed by the ministry, Gellert accompanied and that they would visit as soon as they set the living arrangements.</p><p>The making of a wizarding space was easy. You just need to know the correct spell works. Both wizards knew it. However, as they stood looking at the empty spot they cleared for the house, both were not able to go through with it.</p><p>“I think Tom should be here. This is going to be his house in future,” said Albus.</p><p>“Yes, let us go get the brat,” said Gellert.</p><p>------------</p><p>Tom read through the letter again and again. It felt like Albus was being used by the ministry and he did not like it one bit. He has already finished a book staying up at night and was now reading the letter. The knock on the door was unexpected.</p><p>“Mrs Cole- </p><p>“Let's not finish whatever lie you were going to say, get dressed and Albus is waiting downstairs,” said an amused Gellert.</p><p>Tom looked up and was shocked.</p><p>“You are here,” he said , the stoic, unaffected mask back on.</p><p>“Yes, because we want your inputs. Now do you want me to get you dressed,” asked Gellert. Tom glared at him and his magic shut the door on Gellert's face with a satisfying thud.</p><p>Tom tried not to be smug as he walked out and Gellert looked at him narrow eyed.</p><p>Albus was chatting with Mrs Cole. They were to attend a meeting with the authorities soon and she was giving tips.</p><p>Albus beamed as he saw Gellert and Tom coming down. He can see both were irritated with each other.</p><p>“Did you have breakfast?” asked Albus.</p><p>Tom shrugged.</p><p>“Tom refused to come out of his room,” said Mrs Cole.</p><p>“Well, he is a child. But making him eat is your job,” snapped Gellert. He took hold of Tom's hand and walked out.</p><p>Albus looked at Mrs Cole disappointedly and walked out. No one spoke till all three settled in for Tom's breakfast at a local shop.</p><p>“What's wrong? What are you both irritated about?” asked Albus placing a hand on both of them.</p><p>“He slammed the door in my face,” said Gellert.</p><p>“I was angry,” said Tom.</p><p>“But you know what you did was wrong, do you not?” asked Albus.</p><p>Tom looked down.</p><p>“Yes” he said.</p><p>“Good”</p><p>“Apologise now,” said Albus </p><p>Tom looked at Gellert.</p><p>“I am sorry,” he said.</p><p>Gellert nodded.</p><p>“Also, we want you to have proper food. There will be no more skipping meals,” said Albus.</p><p>“Okay,” said Tom.</p><p>------</p><p>Tom was surprised when Gellert took his hand as they walked out. He thought the man was angry at him. Albus took the other hand too.</p><p>“We have something to talk to you about,” said Albus.</p><p>“You are not adopting me isn't that it?” snapped Tom throwing their hands away and turning on them.</p><p>“You have found perfect kid, you don't want someone odd and freakish as me, right? Isn't that why you both ignored me for four days,” said Tom, his eyes losing all the light it had gained during his time with both men.</p><p>Both men exchanged looks and squat down on both sides of the child and took both his hands though he resisted.</p><p>“We were away on work. But we understand it distressed you and it won't happen again. We will make sure you are aware of what is going on,” said Albus.</p><p>“As of today, we were actually planning on setting up our house. Then we thought you should also be able to give inputs on the house we are building,” said Gellert.</p><p>“We are building a house?” asked Tom, shocked.</p><p>“Yes and you are going to decide what you want,” said Albus.</p><p>“I get my own room?” asked Tom</p><p>“Of course,” said both together. Tom let them both hug him and drop a kiss each on his forehead and ever went through the indignity of his hair being ruffled. He looked at them.</p><p>“So you both want me to be your son and not those perfect kids,” asked Tom.</p><p>“Tom, I think we need each other. We need you to light up our lives and you need us to protect you and guide you,” said Gellert.</p><p>“Also, we will be making a family. You, me and your father. If you want, in future we can also have more siblings. You will have a bigger family,” said Albus.</p><p>“In future,” said Tom and let Albus hug him.</p><p>Gellert smirked as all three of them apparated to Ilkley. No one spoke about Gellert being addressed the father.</p><p>-----------</p><p>Tom looked at the estate. It was huge. No nosy neighbours. </p><p>“So, what kind of house would you prefer? I grew up in a castle, was shuttled across many places and Albus grew up in a mansion. We both were living in a cottage. So, what sort of house would you prefer,” asked Gellert.</p><p>“If we want a big family we will need a big house,” said Tom like he was talking to a child. Albus snorted as Gellert scowled.</p><p>“Yes, sir Tom,” said Gellert making Tom look at Gellert like he was a child again.</p><p>“A mansion,” said Albus.</p><p>They drew many patterns in the air and almost 50 designs appeared. </p><p>Tom picked the one with an inner courtyard.</p><p>They built around it. The house had some 30 rooms, a library, a potion lab and a stable. They made a rough  structure. Tom watched having his meal of beans as  his soon to be parents were joined by some architects who helped. It was not a one day work. They came back and took him to the location every day. Tom has already picked his room. It was closer to his parents’ room but not too close and gave a good view of the estate. He has also taken time to look around the estate. They had acres and acres of land lying about.</p><p>Gellert already told him about the importance of the land. It is a magical property and has been in his family for centuries. Albus saw them deep in conversation with Tom unconsciously leaning towards Gellert who also sat leaning on the tree under which they sat.</p><p>“What would you like to have in the grounds? We have already decided on the herb garden, cultivating potions ingredients and a greenhouse. Of course the stable also. I would like to have a few flying horses,” said Gellert.</p><p>“I want a pet zoo,” said Tom.</p><p>“Pets?” asked Albus.</p><p>Tom nodded.</p><p>“How about we get you one pet and see how you take care of him/ her and decide after that?” asked Albus.</p><p>“That's fair,” said Tom as the owl was not his. But he still took care of her. She was a great companion.</p><p>“Do I have to go back to the orphanage?” asked Tom.</p><p>“Maybe two more days. We have spoken to the muggle authorities. Tomorrow they will speak to you and then we can take you home. However, we will have to adopt you magically too. That may take a few days however, that won't affect your stay with us,” said Gellert.</p><p>Tom nodded. </p><p>“How about we go for a quidditch match tomorrow. The Wimbourne wasps are playing. We can let the architect's do their job and we will come back and think about the interior furnishings,” said Albus.</p><p>Tom tried not to jump of excitement like an idiot child and nodded stoically.</p><p>--------------</p><p>Tom was taking notes in the quidditch stands. He had already made his notes on Appleby Arrows, Chudley Cannons, Puddlemere United and Montrose Magpies from the last two games. Today Wimbourne was playing Ballycastle Bats. Tom is yet to decide on a favorite team. </p><p>“They play defensive game, foolish tactic. Quidditch is not a defensive sport,” said Tom and Albus looked at Tom like he has heard that sentence before. Tom looked behind to see a very smug Gellert smirking at Albus who groaned.</p><p>Tom wanted to laugh for some reason. But he did not. </p><p>----------------</p><p>The muggle adoption went fine. Tom was so glad when he stepped out of the orphanage. There was nothing on this earth that can make him go back  there again. Nothing. </p><p>They soon stood outside a small cottage. Tom did not mind. It was kind of cute. Aggh, he is using stupid words now.</p><p>“Come on, let us get inside,” said Albus and they did. Gellert showed him the second bedroom and then deposited Tom's luggage in there.</p><p>“We need to buy you more clothes,” said Albus.</p><p>Gellert nodded.</p><p>“And a haircut,” said Gellert.</p><p>------------------</p><p>Tom liked the hair cut. He also liked his new muggle clothes. His haircut was similar to that of Gellert. Tom realised Gellert can be more of a child than him at times and had to admire Albus's patience.</p><p>Gellert had told him about the Gaunts. He knew his uncle was alive. But he detested people who lived like pigs. They had silently shown him around Little Hangleton. He saw the riddle house. It was big but he also knew that his biological father might not know about his existence. He knew his mother had used a love potion on the muggle man.</p><p>He was so glad that they told him. That they trusted him to understand. Tom did not take trust for granted. Not many people have trusted him and he was not going to let down his parents.</p><p>All three of them had stood as they watched Tom Riddle Sr carry around a baby in his arms as he walked around the lawn. They saw the man's eye lock on the Gaunt House and freeze for a second and look away. He was scared of them. Who wouldn't be after all he went through ?</p><p>“Can we go home now?” asked Tom, realising what he said only after his parents side along apparated him to their house.</p><p>Albus picked him up and Tom did not fight him. He was rigid for sometime before giving in and hugging Albus tight as the man carried him around, telling him a happy story about a boy named Harry Potter who had a Nimbus broom,  who flew on a flying car to his school along with his friend Ron Weasley.</p><p>Gellert sat and watched for some time. Then he conjured a camera and took a photo.</p><p>------------</p><p>Tom was a bit ashamed when he woke up tucked in, in his room. He remembers clinging to Albus like a baby. His eyes burned remembering it. Gellert walked in with tea and saw his son crying. He put down the tea and sat near the child and scooped him into his arms. Tom struggled and kicked and shouted all sort of shit before going limp and hugging Gellert tight.</p><p>“I don't want to be clingy,” said Tom.</p><p>“You are not clingy. We like being depended upon,” said Albus from the door.</p><p>“No one likes it. All the nurses in the orphanage hated it,” said Tom vehemently.</p><p>“Well, they are stupid nurses. We on the other hand are your parents and you are our only son,” said Albus.</p><p>Tom looked pacified at that.</p><p>“So it's okay?” asked Tom.</p><p>Both men nodded.</p><p>“Do you know that even after coming off age, most wizarding kids stay with their family,” said Albus.</p><p>“They do. Family is very precious for us. With these many little wizards and witches left, we all tend to stick together,” said Gellert.</p><p>“Where are your parents?” asked Tom.</p><p>“Mine are dead. Though I have a sister Arianna and a brother Aberforth. He will love you. She will too. And to answer your question, we don't live together because something horrible happened in the past,” said Albus.</p><p>“And you?” asked Tom looking at Gellert who looked down.</p><p>“I do have a family. I was disowned by them and my great aunt took me in,” said Gellert.</p><p>“Oh, why did they disown you,” asked Tom.</p><p>“My parents were kind souls. I - I ended up hurting a lot of people. They couldn't bear to look at what I had done and banished me,” said Gellert.</p><p>“How about we let father be on his own for a bit and join us at the breakfast table,” asked Albus carrying Tom in his arms. Tom was little for an eleven year old.</p><p>“Tom,”  said Albus.</p><p>“He misses them? But they threw him away,” said Tom worried.</p><p>“But they are still his parents and they love him and he does love them. That's how family works,” said Albus.</p><p>“Hmm,” said a thoughtful Tom. Both waited for Gellert who joined them. They had  breakfast and left for the ministry. Tom watched in awe as wizards and witches respectfully moved away from his parents’ side. Some in fear too, but mostly respect.</p><p>He saw the lady whom they approached do the same. She asked Tom some questions and then looked up the wizarding relative who is evidently incapable of taking care of Tom. She spoke to Tom for a bit.</p><p>They left ministry that day as a family. He was now the son of Gellert Grindelwald and Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>---------------</p><p>The parents decided it was time for Tom to meet his other family members. They decided to visit Hogsmeade first. </p><p>Aberforth was serving some travelling groups while the three walked in. He saw who was standing at his doorstep and growled.</p><p>“To what do I owe this displeasure,” asked Aberforth as he poured both of their favorite drink, yet to notice the kid.</p><p>“Actually, we came here so that you can meet your nephew,” said Gellert taking his drink.</p><p>“Nephew, Please tell me you both did not find a way to procreate and made a mini you,” said Aberforth.</p><p>“We did not, fear not. This here is Tom. Tom, meet Uncle Aberforth,” said Albus lifting Tom so that Aberforth can see the kid.</p><p>“Good lord. We are taking this to my cottage,” he said and led the way. Aberforth did not take his eyes off Tom all the while.</p><p>“Also, meet Arianna,” said Aberforth and a transparent being came forward. Tom was surprised.</p><p>“She looks like a ghost,” said Tom.</p><p>“I am a ghost, as you put it little one. You must be Tom Marvolo Riddle Dumbledore- Grindelwald. You are famous among the ghosts,” said Arianna.</p><p>“Me?” asked Tom, leaning towards Albus knowing he will protect him if something went wrong.</p><p>“You know you are the heir of Slytherin right?” asked Arianna.</p><p>Tom nodded.</p><p>“Well, Slytherin's son is a ghost. Bloody Baron. He says how Al said you are faring so well and how proud Albus Dumbledore is of you which must mean the heir is doing something right,” said Arianna.</p><p>Tom looked at Albus who was looking at Arianna rebukingly. But she gave a small laugh and went through Gellert who scowled.</p><p>“That's cold as you very well know,” said Gellert.</p><p>“Chill, brother in law,” said Arianna.</p><p>“ The way you pester me, one would think you are my sister and not theirs,” said Gellert.</p><p>“You are so easy to mess with,” smirked Arianna. </p><p> “Be a good boy love. Aunt will always be a call away. Just call Aunt Arianna and I will be there,” said Arianna.</p><p>Tom nodded, not knowing what to say.</p><p>“So there are actual ghosts?” asked Tom.</p><p>“Let me tell him all about it while you men finish the drink,” said Aberforth and led Tom to the corridor. They listened to Aberforth telling him all about ghosts as they sat there holding each other. Every appearance of Arianna often left them vulnerable. No matter how many times Arianna said that it was her magic that killed her, they just couldn't believe it.</p><p>Then Aberforth was telling him about Hogsmeade and the various shops, the history of the place and how close Hogwarts is. He also told him some stories about the Dumbledore family.</p><p>“How did aunt Arianna die?” asked Tom.</p><p>Aberforth breathed in and out. It was a difficult question but he knew he would have to give an unbiased answer. He looked at the two parents and then sighed seeing them give the go signal. Aberforth told him.</p><p>Tom was silent as they reached home. He saw both his parents were worried and he can understand why. He did not want them to be upset. He kind of liked them both. </p><p>In the morning, he walked over and climbed on the sofa and sat between them. </p><p>“I would believe Aunt Arianna. Logically, since she is a spirit she could have blamed you easily if that were the case. I read about spirits,” said Tom looking at them both.</p><p>“How did you get to the top shelf?” asked Gellert amused.</p><p>Tom looked down.</p><p>“I climbed up,” said Tom truthfully. He had climbed up after looking at the library listing.</p><p>Gellert hugged him close.</p><p>“You shouldn't have done that, but, thank you,” said Gellert.</p><p>Albus nodded.</p><p>“We appreciate it but you could have fallen. So, we will have to ground you for a day,” said Albus dropping a kiss on Tom's forehead.</p><p>Tom nodded.</p><p>“How about I make pancakes for breakfast?” asked Gellert.</p><p>Tom nodded trying not to be too eager. He loved pancakes.</p><p>--------------</p><p>It has been a month and a half since Tom met both Albus and Gellert, his parents. He trusted them both. They have never hid much from him. While he was not naive to think that they did not hide anything at all from him, he knew they would always say everything important.</p><p>They were going to have the housewarming soon. But before that his parents were arguing about interior designing. He almost groaned but thankfully did not do anything that disgraceful. </p><p>“Can you both stop it,” said Tom looking at them both witheringly.</p><p>“Okay,” said Albus and sat down. Gellert scowled but he too sat down.</p><p>“How about I pick the living room and other rooms while you both can pick your personal rooms,” said Tom.</p><p>“Okay,” both parents agreed.</p><p>------------</p><p>Tom sighed and called up Arianne and wrote a letter to Aberforth. He needed help. With their help, Tom decided the type of things he would want. Ofcourse, limited input on the designing part from Aberforth given the state of the pub, still. They also hired a wizarding interior designer. It took them three days. Tom was satisfied with the house and let his parents see it. </p><p>Both did not have much to argue about. They just sighed and held Tom close, proudly. Tom loved his room in the new house. He decided that he wanted a dark Prussian blue paint and had black furniture giving the room a different look. His parents did not object.</p><p>Tom beamed when he was taken to the part of Hogsmeade from where he can see Hogwarts. </p><p>“It's beautiful,” said Tom.</p><p>“It is,” said Albus.</p><p>“I have spoken to the headmaster and made sure that you can stay in my chambers when you wish to. Also, you are not to tell your friends of the privilege,” said Albus.</p><p>“Will we not see father till Halloween?” asked Tom crestfallen. That was the first time he addressed Gellert as father.</p><p>“We will see him every weekend. We will go home every weekend,” said Albus. Gellert lifted Tom and carried him on their journey to Hogwarts. Tom did not care that he was being a baby. He did not want to be away from Father. Why can't he have his father also with him.</p><p>Albus and Gellert could sense the pain. Both looked at each other.</p><p>“You know, teachers of Hogwarts have a living quarters where the family is also allowed in Hogsmeade. Before now, Albus has not made use of it. But, we were thinking maybe we can use it during the weekdays. You can come see me with your dad on most days,” said Gellert.</p><p>Tom looked mollified at that but just cuddled himself closer to his Father. He was almost animose towards the Headmaster who had no clue why the kid hated him.</p><p>“Why is your son glaring at me like I took his favorite toy away?” asked<br/>
Armando.</p><p>“He is not happy with being away from Gellert,” said Albus.</p><p>“And, I thought you were mad to miss Grindelwald while at work,” said Armando.</p><p>Albus glared at him.</p><p>“Dad,” screeched Tom from outside, his first time calling him so and Albus knew Tom was establishing his team against his enemy Dippet.</p><p>As Albus reached the door, Dippet sighed and said, “You can tell your Grindelwald that there is a vacancy for the Defence Against the Dark Arts Position. If you think that you can have a hold on him that is,” said Dippet.</p><p>Albus looked at Dippet.</p><p>“I trust you. Go on,” said Dippet.</p><p>Albus walked out after nodding.</p><p>------------</p><p>Gellert ran his hand through Albus's hair. He was resting his head on Gellert’s shoulder.</p><p>“So, you and your stupid Headmaster thinks I am qualified and sane enough to teach children Defence Against Dark Arts?” asked Gellert.</p><p>Albus did not say anything.</p><p>“Okay. If it means I get to see you and Tom every day, I would even assist that nutter Kettleburn in Care of Magical Creatures,” said Gellert.</p><p>Albus just hugged him tighter.</p><p>“I never liked leaving you alone for the better part of a week,” said Albus.</p><p>“Neither did I,” said Gellert.</p><p>--------------</p><p>Tom was like a child high on candies next day. The news was well received. All his trained mask was in shambles when he was around family. Aberforth and he baked a cake as celebration.</p><p>“You know, Tom is curious about his grandparents, the living pair. Maybe try and get in touch?” asked Aberforth. Albus looked at Gellert who nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>Tom was sharing the cake with a few of the kids in the lane. Though he did not like them, his parents had taught him that sharing is good. So he will do it at times.</p><p>-----------</p><p>Padre and Madre</p><p>This is Gellert. I am , as you might know, now with Albus. We recently adopted a child. His name is Tom. You are his only set of grandparents. He would like to meet you lot. I would not expect you to forgive me. But I request that you consider the plea for your grandson's sake.</p><p>GG</p><p>In the countryside of Spain, an owl flew down to a castle. The guards took the letter to the baron. The man opened the letter. Debra Grindelwald stepped closer to her husband to read the missive. It was from her son, her eldest. He knew Gellert was now settled down and has left his old ways, mostly. The thing was, they did not know how to approach him after that.</p><p>Machelon Grindelwald looked at his wife.</p><p>“A grandson. After all it is Gellert who did give us our first grandson,” said Machelon.</p><p>“Did someone say Gellert,” asked a voice from the room, poking his head out.</p><p>“We did speak of your older brother Gaen,” said Debra. Gaen was the youngest and 20. He has only seen Gellert once. They had banished their son long back.</p><p>“Are we finally getting to see my brother again?” asked Gaia, Gellert's sister.</p><p>“Don't act like you did not use to visit him often when he was around,” said Machelon.</p><p>Gaia scowled.</p><p>“So the prodigal son returns?” scoffed Gabriel, Gellert's immediate younger brother.</p><p>“He adopted, Gabriel,” said Debra.</p><p>“What?” asked Gabriel.</p><p>“Yeah, exactly my thought. I can see Albus affecting him positively. Good lad that. But, adopting a kid? I must say, my son has changed a lot from the selfish boy he was,” said Machelon.</p><p>“I would spare judgement  till we meet them?” said Gabriel.</p><p>“You are also meeting him? I thought you said I will never lay my eyes on that traitor again,” said Gaen.</p><p>“Do shut up Gaen,” said Gabriel.</p><p>Gaen just scowled. Grace, the middle sister came down hearing all this and hugged their dad. </p><p>“Thank you. When are we leaving for England?” asked Grace.</p><p>“I was thinking I will invite the three of them here,” said Machelon.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Gellert,</p><p>I expect you and your family to visit us before the summer ends. Your mom and sisters and Gaen are excited. Gabriel says he is sparing judgement till he meets you. I, on the other hand, just want to see my first born and what he has made for himself.</p><p>Love<br/>
Padre.</p><p>Albus held Gellert as the man sat like a stone. When the teardrop did fall, Albus wiped them. Tom was sitting on the sofa and even though he was acting like he was reading, he was observing his parents.</p><p>“May I see the letter Father,” asked Tom.</p><p>Gellert gave him a smile and nodded. Tom read through the letter.</p><p>“These are good things. Why are you crying?” asked Tom.</p><p>“He is crying because he is happy,” said Albus. Tom climbed on the bigger sofa and stuck like a koala to Albus's side.</p><p>“I thought we cried when we are sad,” said Tom.</p><p>“People cry when they are sad too. Adult thing,” said Albus.</p><p>“Weird, adults,” said Tom as he slowly gave into exhaustion and fell asleep on Albus's lap.</p><p>Both men looked at their son and just sat there. Glad for the moment.</p><p>------------</p><p>Gellert was worried. Tom held his hand and Albus held the other. They were a team, no matter what.</p><p>They took a portkey to Spain. Tom saw the castle and gasped.</p><p>“It's big,” said Tom.</p><p>“Yeah,” said Gellert, sheepishly.</p><p>Tom looked at Albus who gave in with a smile and picked him up. He did not want to be seen as a baby. But he liked being carried by his parents.</p><p>They reached the doorsteps and Gellert waved his hand and a magical energy swirled and went into the house. The door was open in a moment and there stood his sisters. They threw themselves at Gellert.</p><p>They fussed over Albus and Tom and led them in. Then, Debra walked in and she rushed to their side, quite majestically. She hugged her son, son-in-law and grandchild. Machelon went for a more restrained greeting.</p><p>Gellert then felt a body crash on him. A teen looked at him shly. </p><p>“Merlin Gae, you have grown so much,” said Gellert hugging his twenty year old brother who looked no older than fifteen. Gae always write letters to Gellert and Gellert would always respond with equal enthusiasm. </p><p>“Hey little one,” Gae smiled at Tom after giving a hug to Albus.</p><p>Tom looked at him, his nose in the air, at being called little one.</p><p>“It is fun to be the little one. We get pampered,” said Gaen and picked up Tom who finally gave in and smiled.</p><p>Debra has cornered Albus along with the sisters, asking questions left and right.</p><p>Gellert looked on.</p><p>“You chose well,” said Machelon.</p><p>Gellert looked at his father.</p><p>“I almost let it go. Albus is stubborn,” said Gellert.</p><p>“Good thing too. I would have hated informing your future nephews and nieces that their uncle was a megalomaniacal dark wizard,” said Gabriel.</p><p>“Gabe,” said Gellert.</p><p>Gabriel scowled, something uncharacteristic to him. “I am not five,” said Gabriel.</p><p>He hugged his brother and then Albus and finally Tom who was now beaming covered in chocolate given by Gaen.</p><p>------------------</p><p>The family of three left for home. Albus and Gellert took Tom shopping for school books. The shopping was a great experience. Tom hesitated outside the wandmaker’s shop. He had read about the Ollivanders in history books. He knew, Garrick Ollivander is a friend of his parents.However, the thought of having a wand for himself was intimidating.</p><p>Albus picked up Tom and they all stepped in. </p><p>Garrick looked old. The man looked ancient, in fact. He smiled seeing Tom. </p><p>“Ah, my child. I see what your parents are talking about. I know the perfect wand for you to harness  your power,” said Garrick and went around looking at his shelves. He brought stacks of wands to Tom as they parents watched. There was an old battered box in it. Interestingly, Tom went for it. Garrick’s eyes twitched.</p><p>“If he is getting a high out of observing out child like a specimen, I might take my wand out,” muttered Gellert.</p><p>Albus kept a calming hand on him. He knew Garrick would seem different with the way he spoke about wands and wand users.</p><p>Tom lifted the wand in the box and gave it a swish. Golden sparks leapt out of the wand. Both the  parents beamed. Garrick Ollivander, for once was shocked into silence.</p><p>“That is a wand made by my great great grandfather Wilhem Ollivander. He made it with Cedar wood and Thestral hair core, springy, 13 cm,” said Ollivander, still in a daze as he looked at the young boy who, for once seemed unaware of the drama going on as he looked at his wand curiously. </p><p>The parents got the message clearly. Their son is powerful and is meant for great things.<br/>
Tom peered at them, assessing their expressions. Both beamed and hugged him.</p><p> </p><p>Moving into the new house was a happy day for the family of three. They lived there for three days before it was time to leave for Hogwarts.</p>
