    <p>Harry was defiant as he waltzed up the steps towards the throne room, even in another territory he refused to submit. Harry through a drunk deal his uncle had made was due to marry the heir to the Malfoy throne. A contract that was irreversible. It as a way to for the greedy man to gain money from selling off his hated nephew, a way to aline himself with royalty. The all doors swung open revealing the Malfoy family sitting elegantly in their allocated thrones. Lucius Malfoy was hiding a look of disgust under a tight smile is pointed nose raised to the sky, Narcissa was unreadable as a plan expression engulfed her sharp features. Draco held a plain look of annoyance on his pale skin. Why this contract came about was a mystery to Harry, it seemed that each party was as unwilling as the other.</p><p>Vernon walked towards them bowing once he was at he appropriate distance.<br/>
'Your highnesses I present my nephew, Harry Potter'</p><p>Lucius' eyes lit up at the sound of Harry's last name, a link to a rather wealthy noble family before a radical group had assassinated them.<br/>
'Any relations to the lord and lady that passed almost two decades ago?'<br/>
'Most certainly' Vernon let a smug smirk rise to his thin lips, the deal becoming more promising as words became conversations.<br/>
'I'll let the servants take you to your chambers for the time being, the boys will be spending more time together from now on' Lucius gave a hand motion ordering the servants to move, they scuttled towards Harry curtsying clumsily. Harry leaned towards the poor girls ear.<br/>
'It's fine, I don't need the formalities'<br/>
Blush arose on the servants face before she quickly began leading him away from the dreaded room.</p><p>The palace corridors were filled with paintings of royalty and noble families alike. Even one stolen from his dead parents home was place along the tall walls a dedication plaque beneath.</p><p>'James and Lily Potter, strong yet weak as they perished'</p><p>A last snide remark the royal family could make against his rebelling parents.</p><p>Harry followed the oddly awkward servant to his room. A chamber that was fit for the highest of royal guests, silken pillows hid inside the emerald canopy bed. Gold encrusted the delicate patterns that adorned the window frames and the ceiling was painted with stories that Harry would spend the next couple of nights deciphering. It was a beautiful room yet it showed wealth in such a flamboyant way that Harry couldn't help to think about those below him, those unable to gain such luxuries. It was disgusting. </p><p>Harry sat by the window in a tall velvet chair watching day turn to night, maids lighting his chamber candles before telling him he had a half hour before dinner. A surely uncomfortable affair to ensue. He made sure he was presentable, trying to tame his untameable locks before letting a maid lead him to the dining room.</p><p>Another elaborate display as wealth, high painted ceilings, an exceptionally long dining table that looked like it could serve the whole court and stained glass. The weight of it all would surely break the structural support that may as well have been  pennys beneath lumps of gold. Lucius and Narcissa were already sat down, Vernon sitting smugly beside Narcissa. Lucius sat at the head leaving two seats to his right for Draco and Harry. One of those took an awfully long time to be filled.</p><p>Draco left the table waiting and waiting before arriving with a guard on his arm. He proceeded to give him a quick kiss before signalling him to leave taking his seat in between his father and Harry. Smoke looked as if it would start pouring  from Lucius' ears, a look of anger consuming his pointed features. His fists clenched upon the detailed table cloth.<br/>
'Who would that have been?'<br/>
'Just a friend' Draco brushed it off, this was clearly not his first time pissing off his father<br/>
'A friend! Does this friend know you are very much engaged?"<br/>
'Well yeah, that's the point'</p><p>Even Vernon had lost his appeased look as the atmosphere turned significantly darker.</p><p>'You had no right! We have raised you better than to be some man who whores himself out to palace guards'<br/>
'Least I'd have more fun than marrying some nobody'<br/>
'He has money, he will keep this kingdom afloat' Lucius' voice continued to get louder, Harry losing his patience</p><p>'He will not be subjected to this crap. If he won't do it willingly then neither will I, I'm not a puppet' Harry growled<br/>
'Sit down' Hissed Vernon<br/>
'No! Why can the prince be an ass? Why can he waltz in with a man on his arm if he is engaged to me? I'm not ecstatic about this marriage either but I haven't disrespected him at all'<br/>
'Harry. Sit. Down'<br/>
'NO'</p><p>And he ran. He ran past he armed guards as fast as his legs could take him. He ran to the grounds, to the peace of the outdoors. The palace had a beautiful botanical garden, filled with flowers and plants from ever kingdom that would let them take some. It was entrancing. The colours basked within the moons gaze the sky clear. He found refuge beneath an old oak tree leaning against the trunk, ignoring the dirt he now sat on. What would it matter when tomorrow he would probably be escorted (dragged) off of palace grounds. He tilted his head back closing his eyes, taking a deep breath in. He was at peace knowing that it could only get better from hear, he couldn't dig any lower. </p><p>'You know, that was pretty brave' Draco's velvety voice interrupted his peace<br/>
'By brave I hope you mean stupid, I could've could my ass in a guillotine'<br/>
'Are like your head butI wouldn't have let him, I'm sorry I'm a shitty fiancé'<br/>
Harry sighed placing his head within his hands.<br/>
'You haven't really had a chance to be my fiancé, it's a forced betrothal and honestly it was never going to work'<br/>
'Can we try? I'm pretty sure I'll be the one in a guillotine if we don't'<br/>
'Sure, doesn't bother me either way'<br/>
'Why not?'<br/>
'Because I can't access my inheritance without Vernon getting some of his grubby hands on to it, I marry you he can't get a drop. If we don't I'll just wait for the bastard to die'<br/>
'So you'll marry me?' Draco asked his voice losing it's smoothness and earning itself an edge which only came from discomfort<br/>
'Sure, just don't kiss other guys in from of me'<br/>
'Why not?'<br/>
'Well it'll look pretty bad considering I'm supposed to care and I'll just kinda stare' The twinkle dimmed in Draco's eyes, maybe he hoped for Harry to actually be the jealous type, the one that wouldn't like him going around flirting with guards. Apparently not.<br/>
'Oh'<br/>
'I'm going to head to the kitchens now, I'm bloody hungry' Harry stood up, brushing off his trousers and shaking out his overcoat.<br/>
'Can I come with you? I didn't eat either'</p><p>Harry nodded letting Draco walk up beside him, their walking patterns seconds apart. Though Harry knew little of the castles layout it was easy for him to find the kitchens, servants were carrying the wasted food from the dining room and he followed accordingly. They had wedged themselves between two servants, both of them carrying plates full of side dishes. There was probably going to be excess food anyways but because of boys behaviours most of it would end up wasted, that our it would become servant food for as long as it stayed good. The kitchen hand behind them had pink dusted cheeks which were surely Draco-Induced, it didn't help he proceeded to smile back at her terrified face. His reassurance looked at lot more threatening than reassuring.</p><p>They reached the kitchen doors, the palace's staff round a rather beaten wooden table eating the leftovers that were piling in by the second.<br/>
'You don't mind if we grab a bite do you?' asked Harry a cheeky grin on his face<br/>
'Not at all' the head cook replied, she was a rounded middle aged lady with a coloured striped apron, her cheeks were a jolly red and she was clearly not someone you messed with</p><p>The staff's young children were running throughout the bustling kitchen, some with baked goods stuffed within their shallow pockets poking out. Both boys looked at them with a hunger for a childhood like that, one without strict rules and distant guardians. A childhood that was a childhood and not a study period for adult hood. Draco could ballroom dance better than the majority of his court but his ability to make friends was almost non-existent. His flirting skills came from romance novels and his 'friends' were greedy nobles wanting him to marry their daughters. Harry on the other hand was given to his aunt and uncle after his parents sudden passing, expected to behave like a nobel son yet treated with such disrespect from people who were below him in the ruling system, he wouldn't have cared so much if had the option to do as he pleased but he too was put through rigorous etiquette classes that taught him zero social skills. </p><p>They awkwardly took a seat around the beaten table quickly grabbing food and rudely shoved it down their throats. They were famished. You could see smiles peak onto the servants faces to see such childish behaviours from renowned young men. It wasn't long before the went to grab more, their hands grazing in the process. Draco pulled back his cheeks kissed pink whilst Harry ignored it more focused on the meal in front of him. The cook stifled a laugh before getting back to the children.</p><p>'Thank you' Harry said once he swallowed his last mouthful<br/>
'Yeah thank you' Draco echoed before following Harry the door<br/>
'I'm heading to bed, see you tomorrow Draco'<br/>
'Tomorrow' Draco agreed suppressing a grin</p>
