    <p>Five years since the Battle of Hogwarts, life has been good to one Harry Potter, he and Ron had been Auror partners and they are both considered experts in their field, while Hermione Granger was working as an Unspeakable, a high ranking one.</p><p>It was just another day off for Harry, he woke up early and made himself a cuppa to start the day. He sat on the chair by his kitchen counter and began to peruse the Daily Prophet. His face once again scrunched up as he saw his own face plastered at the front page with Ron Weasley, between them was one of the captured remaining Death Eaters, Mcnair.</p><p>It took them months to hunt him down as the man decided to hide in muggle London. But they found a trace of pseudo-love potions being sold in muggle London that seemed too good to be true. It seems the man was trying to make a livelihood in the muggle realm by creating pseudo-love potions to sell to muggles.</p><p>It took the cooperation of several departments to track down all of his clients and obliviate and cure them from the effects of the pseudo-love potion, which they learned to be harmful to the muggles especially if overdosed. Mcnair did not have the necessary ingredients for the potion so he improvised and those improvisations led to eleven muggle deaths.</p><p>Harry did not bother to read the rest of the article as soon as he saw who wrote it. That witch, Rita Skeeter has always been a bane in Harry’s existence along with her annoying quill, he knows it would be full of bollocks and shitload of praises. He tossed it to the side as he then began to fry up some eggs and bacon.</p><p>Soon enough Harry heard his floo being activated and he peeked from his kitchen to see who it is. Hermione and Ron was there brushing off some of the sooth on their clothes.</p><p>“Hey, what are you guys doing here?”, Harry looked at them amused and Ron shrugged his shoulders as he began to move towards the kitchen holding what seems to be a case file.</p><p>“I smelled bacon”, Ron replied as he brushed Harry’s shoulder and picking up one of the pieces of bacon in the plate that Harry has on his table. Harry rolled his eyes and watched as Hermione flopped to the couch, he smiled, he was sure she just passed out.</p><p>They left Hermione to have a few minutes of sleep since they both knew she hasn’t had any decent sleep since the other day. Harry casted a charm to the living room where Hermione was passed out and waved a blanket to her tired form.</p><p>“So what is this mate?”, Harry broke the silence and Ron’s munching on his bacons, and Ron swallowed then opened the case file. Harry’s eyes widened at the case file and the photos in them.</p><p>“Aren’t these one of Mcnair’s victims?”, Ron nodded and mumbled to Harry to look closer.</p><p>“Wait, their veins are black”, he looked toward Ron and a voice interrupted them.</p><p>“The pseudo-love potion he made did not result to that, I checked it twice and it was not a match. So I took it up to Robards and guess what I found”, the two of them looked at Hermione who looked like she needs more sleep and she just gestured to them later, as she stole Harry’s cup and took a swing from it.</p><p>“Ugh, I feel alive”, Harry just sighed.</p><p>“Is this steal Harry’s food day?”, Harry voiced out laced with amusement and his friends just looked at him with amused expressions.</p><p>“Back to the topic, when the bodies were sent to Saint Mungos for autopsy, four of those bodies were positive to have been killed by the potion”, Harry’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Are you telling me that seven of them were killed by this black thing in their veins?”, Hermione nodded and she exhaled.</p><p>“At first, I thought they were the same that Mcnair just gave them another concoction but no, when I inspected them more clearly I noticed a small triangle tattoo on their bodies, a mark of a curse. This curse was not easy to lift, this was old magic”, Ron and Harry looked at one another then to Hermione who sighed and began to explain.</p><p>“Old magic, where it was common to sacrifice things for a curse and all that, unlike the new magic upon which was changed.”, she noticed that her two companions just looked at each other as if having no idea what it was, it would’ve been acceptable had it only been Harry but from Ron that’s just barmy.</p><p>“Just really really old”, Hermione just voiced out as she could see the confusion in their faces. Though none of them were talking as they listened to Hermione and she just crossed her arms together and the aura from her seemed different to Harry.</p><p>“When I lifted it, took me days to be honest but their wounds showed, a black puncture precisely on their hearts and whatever it was spread to their bodies killing them painfully”, Hermione’s eyes were guarded as she looked at them and Ron stood up to rub her shoulders.</p><p>“Not to be rude or anything but why is an Unspeakable investigating this case?”, Harry asked Hermione and she replied crossing her arms.</p><p>“It is related to what I was working on”, was all Hermione’s reply Ron and Harry never asks why since her job requires her silence upon any work that their department does.</p><p>“Robards sent me the owl along with the case files immediately as soon as Hermione reported her findings. It looks like this was not a new case, this was a cold case that went on a halt when the Dark Lord rose to power.”, Ron took one of the cuppas Hermione made and sipped on it.</p><p>“And these killing started up once again when he disappeared is that it?”, Ron nodded, he took out a small box from his pocket and enlarged them showing dozen case files all with the same victims.</p><p>“Then if it really was not Mcnair who caused the death of the seven, there might be someone still out there who covered their tracks using him”, Harry’s eyes flared as he then began to peruse the documents.</p><p>The trio then began their work once again; it was almost lunch time when Ron stood up from where he sat to push toward them a file that piqued all of their interests.</p><p>“Look at this”, Harry’s eyes widened from beneath his rimmed glasses and Hermione gasped as they all saw the man in the picture.</p><p>Black curly hair, black eyes and pale skin, Harry released a breath he was holding as he looked at the man that looked like a slightly younger version of Sirius Black. But as soon as he saw the name in the photo, <em>Regulus Arcturus Black</em>, it was written in the report that he was killed just like the others. However the one that piqued their interest most was that the day he died, all the muggle killings with marks like that were all stopped, another was because he was the only magical being killed when all the previous targets killed were muggles. He was the one the previous Aurors who conducted the investigation assessed to be the culprit.</p><p>“Do you reckon he knew about those killings?”, Ron voiced out and Harry looked up at him defending Regulus.</p><p>“Perhaps, but it is impossible that he was the culprit, I mean he even aided us with the Horcruxes”, he knew that but he never truly knew the man and Hermione grasped his arm.</p><p>“We understand Harry, it is also possible he saw who did it and got caught in the crossfire”, Harry took a shuddering breath as he slumped to his seat and rubbed his eyes.</p><p>“Sirius told me about him before, he told me that his brother changed and that he regretted not taking him with him when he left the Black household”, Hermione offered him support by placing one of her hand to his shoulder and giving it a squeeze.</p><p>“That might be true mate”, and Ron once again handed them a statement from a muggle doctor who was the one who found him.</p><p>“She might be the last person who saw him alive”, Harry and Hermione read the file and Harry voiced out the name of the Doctor who found him in muggle London.</p><p>“She might’ve already been obliviated though”, Ron stated as he scratched his head out of frustration on the case. They saw no pattern or connection from the victims of more than 20 years ago to now.</p><p>“No it says here that she was a squib who decided to live in the muggle realm”, Hermione looked up at the photo and the statement of the woman who last saw Regulus Black.</p><p>“Judging from her age here she is now probably a retired Doctor”</p><p>“She is the only lead we have, let’s take it”, Harry voiced out as he then ran up the stairs to change his pajamas leaving Hermione and Ron in the kitchen.</p><p>“Do you think he will be alright?”, Hermione voiced out and Ron took a sip from his now cold tea.</p><p>“He will be”, Hermione stared up at him with knowing eyes, they both know how the death of Sirius was a touchy subject for Harry, and knowing that Sirius’ brother Regulus Black was involved in their case did not settle well for them. “I’ll watch over him”</p><p>Hermione nodded and gave him a small smile as she then plucked her robe and Ron’s eyebrow rose at this.</p><p>“Tell Harry I went to catch some sleep in my apartment, share me what you guys find out okay?”, Ron was confused as to why Hermione was concerned about their current case but knowing her she probably just want to help since muggles are being killed by some maniac again.</p><p>Hermione kissed Ron’s cheek and as she was about to leave Harry popped in the kitchen and she kissed his cheek as well. “Take care you two”, she voiced out and waved at them before flooing to her apartment.</p><p>As soon as she arrived, she took out a cellular phone and began to type a number in. The phone rang twice before a woman at the other end replied to Hermione’s call.</p><p>“It’s me”, Hermione voiced out as she took off her coat.</p><p>“Yes, we have a problem”, she headed to one of the windows of her living room and closed off the windows as she then leaned to one of the panels.</p><p>“They have started to move”, there was a muffle of sounds coming from her phone.</p><p>“Regulus Black knew something, not us but the others”</p><p>“Of course I covered it up, the Ministry doesn’t know a thing”, she huffed at the reply of the woman.</p><p>“I made sure Harry and Ron would hold onto the case, any information they find is as good as ours”, she gritted her teeth and was about to snap back but she calmed herself.</p><p>“No need, I will head there myself. Knowing your position right now it would be too suspicious”</p><p>“In the name of our Oath, I shall not fail”, she pressed a button and the phone call was turned off. Her hands fell to her sides as she tilted her head back and closed her eyes. She took out the photo of the muggle doctor that was the last person to interact with Regulus Black.</p><p>“Penny Elmore”</p><p>-</p><p>Harry and Ron apparated just near the small quaint village where Penny Elmore lived. From the looks of it, it would take a few minutes just to get to the nearest Hospital where she lived; it was the perfect place for her to live in.</p><p>Harry never thought that his day off would start of this way, a cold case that has now been re-opened. Though to think they never saw this coming, meaning that whoever was doing this was very smart and very old. If Hermione was right, since the wound from 20 years ago was seemingly the same as the victims they had lately. Or perhaps the perpetrator this time was an imitator or a cult continuing their work now that the Dark Lord is gone.</p><p>“Looks like no one is home Harry”, Ron voiced out and as soon as they both decided to leave for the Hospital a voiced startled them.</p><p>“Is there something you need from me?”, a petite woman who looked nothing like she was in her 60’s, with strawberry blonde hair and dark brown eyes asked them. She was holding onto a bag of groceries in one hand and a phone in the other.</p><p>“Penny Elmore?”, Harry asked and Penny nodded and gave them a confused but amused face.</p><p>“Yes, I am is there something wrong?”, she looked at them from top to toe and her mouth turned to an o.</p><p>“Now I am as sure as hell I know I did not cause any trouble in the Wizarding World to have two handsome Aurors arrest me, but now I am remembering if I ever did”, she said with amusement twinkling in her tired old eyes. Ron flushed slightly and Harry looked amused and Penny walked towards her door to open it.</p><p>“Come in you two”, she voiced out as she headed to the kitchen and began to prepare tea for all of them.</p><p>“Young man you can stop staring you know”, she regarded Harry and he just spluttered an apology.</p><p>“I apologize it’s just that you don’t look like your age”, the woman laughed and handed them their cup of tea.</p><p>“I am a pureblood despite being born a squib, it makes me age just a bit slower than the usual muggle”, she sipped her tea and gestured them to sit down.</p><p>“Now may I ask why two Aurors are directed my way”, Ron looked at Harry and Harry began to ask the woman.</p><p>“I am Auror Potter and this is Auror Weasley of the DMLE Department. Would it be alright for us to ask about a certain incident almost 20 years ago?”, Ms. Elmore then sipped on her tea, her eyes guarded and calculating then she blinked and procured a tired smile and nodded.</p><p>Ron then procured the photo from his pocket and Ms. Elmore’s eyes widened as she placed down her cup, she released a sigh.</p><p>“Did you know of him?”, Ron began and the woman nodded.</p><p>“I found him when I was just on my way home after a long day of shift in the Hospital”, she played with her cup not looking up at them once as she stared at the photo of Regulus Black. Harry noted that there was something in her eyes that he could not comprehend; it was a mix of sadness, anger and regret.</p><p>“I was surprised you know. A wizard like him was dying in the muggle realm. I knew I had to contact the Wizarding realm to help him, but I have no way of contacting them. So I called the ambulance, in hoping that the bizarreness of the situation would allow the Ministry to interfere.”, she looked up at them now as she continued.</p><p>“But they were too late, he had already died, horribly, I could never forget the pained look he had, nor his screams”, her lips pursed as she seemed to remember that day clearly.</p><p>“I’m sorry it must’ve been a horrible thing for you to see”, Ron voiced out his voice laced with sympathy and the woman snorted which made the two looked up at her.</p><p>“I was a Doctor I have seen countless dead bodies and even dissected them for science”, the two realized she was trying to make the situation light but they could still feel the tension in the air so they allowed the old woman to be. “But you are right if you think that that day did not give me the nightmares. I lived once in the Wizarding Realm and I have never seen a death such as his, if it were me I would just gladly take the Avada anytime”</p><p>She sipped on her tea once again, breaking the silence and the two continued on with their questions. “Did you perhaps see anything odd that night?”</p><p>“No, I saw nothing”, Harry could see it in her eyes that she was not lying. But when Ron asked the next question he was sure as hell she was lying then.</p><p>“Did he tell you anything before he passed away?”, she looked up at the two of them and again with her smile she straight up lied to them.</p><p>“No”, Harry and Ron thanked the woman for her time and when they were outside of her house a few blocks away now Harry voiced out his thoughts.</p><p>“She was lying”, Ron stopped in his tracks as he then casted a muffliato to prevent anyone from hearing them.</p><p>“Noticed that too, she stared at the photo of Black as if she knew him, not well enough, but enough for her to look that way”, Harry nodded.</p><p>“When she said that Regulus said nothing before he died she lied too. All the time we asked her about that incident she never looked us straight in the eye, but when we asked her that”</p><p>“Shall we set up surveillance?”, Harry nodded.</p><p>“I better go pick us up some food then, I will meet you here”, Harry nodded as Ron popped away. Harry then turned back and his appearance changed easily, seeing as there was no one present.</p><p>Harry then casted surveillance spells all over Penny Elmore’s house, when he peeked at what the woman was up to the woman had turned on the telly and closing off her curtains. Still no sign of her going out, nor contacting anyone, via phone or anything.</p><p>After a few hours Ron came by and the two of them waited from the roof of the opposite building of Elmore’s house.</p><p>“Still nothing?”, Ron asked and Harry shook his head.</p><p>“She is hiding something, maybe she won’t contact them right away but soon maybe”, Harry could not shake the feeling that something bad is about to happen. He could not explain why but his gut is usually right.</p><p>“Hey Harry, look”, Harry then looked toward where Ron was pointing at and they both saw a blonde woman who was headed towards Elmore’s house. She rang the doorbell and Harry then extended his magic for them to hear what they were saying.</p><p>“Hello, Penny”, the blonde’s voice was cheery and there was something to it that Harry could not place. They both watched the old woman’s expression but she just smiled and hugged the blonde.</p><p>“My dear! So good of you to visit! How is your husband doing?”, Harry and Ron then watched as the woman entered her abode. When they thought that Elmore was going to tell her some information that they needed they realized that their conversation was a normal one.</p><p>Apparently the woman who Elmore invited in was the wife of one of her old patients that she had taken care of before. It seems she comes from time to time to visit the old doctor.</p><p>“Nothing to listen in there huh?”, Ron voiced out to Harry as he slightly lowered his guard and Harry nodded his head, but he still could not shake the feeling that something was up so he listened to the mundane talks of the old woman and the woman.</p><p>-</p><p>As soon as the woman entered the room and as Elmore closed the door her eyes caught up to the runic line that slightly glowed in the tiled floor.</p><p>“You are?”, Elmore voiced out as she then began to grab at one of the umbrella’s in the stand where they were placed and the woman that Elmore knew as one of her close friends smiled at her.</p><p>“<em>Meo nomine –“, </em>Elmore’s eyes widened as her body sagged all tension leaving her person as soon as she heard the name of the person in front of her. She released a gasp as her eyes watered, then with shaking hands she kneeled on the floor her body did not slump but it held the grace and air of a knight in the long gone past.</p>
