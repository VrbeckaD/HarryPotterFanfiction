    <p>Draco was angry. He felt he had a lot to be angry about really. Ever since the Dark Lord fell, even before that when he’d stupidly taken the mad man’s mark.</p><p>It was the summer before his eighth year at Hogwarts; another thing to be angry about, having to retake his final year.  His father spending the foreseeable future in the company of dementors and his mother secluding herself away in the manor.  He was the man of the house now, and he should have been happy, happy to be in charge, to be Lord Malfoy, except he didn’t, he just felt angry, angry at the cards life dealt him, and alone in his aristocratic manor with dozens of rooms and only house elves for company.  Except he never saw them, so they weren’t much company at all, and he really wouldn’t have wanted to interact with the servant race anyway so he decided it was probably for the best that he didn’t.  It didn’t stop him from being angry about it though.</p><p>He really needed to get a handle on his emotions.  The other day he’d been reading in the library and he froze his robe to the back of his chair and had to spell them apart.  This afternoon he’d put a spoon in a bowl of soup and it had frozen solid.  He’d yelled at a house elf about that and had them bring him another one.</p><p>The first time he started freezing things he figured, rightly so, that it was his anger at his situation that was causing bouts of accidental magic.  To counter that he spent several hours a day blasting away at targets in his mansions dueling range.  But even that wasn’t enough to stop the random magic that sprung up around him.  And after he’d exhausted himself and went to use an aguamenti too fill his glass, a blast of ice shot from his wand, shattering the glass and freezing the table and floor beyond.</p><p>He’d spent a couple sleepless nights in the library after that, trying desperately to figure out why his magic was acting up, and while he’d found a few answers, they were more for children with underdeveloped, wild magical cores.  To his surprise and annoyance, after running a few tests on himself he found his core was in a state of wild instability similar to that of a child.  Which would mean he really needed to stop throwing spells around unless he wanted to seriously hurt himself and his magic.</p><p>There’s a reason children aren’t permitted to cast magic until they turn eleven.  Their cores are unstable until then and forcing them to use magic can cause them to collapse in on themselves, explode outward or all sorts of other nasty and unpleasant things.  Lucky for children, they don’t possess enough magic for it to bleed from their core on a normal basis like some witches and wizards of above average strength (a group which Draco could confidently call himself a member of)  and the small bursts of accidental magic came infrequently enough to not be a problem.</p><p>He, on the other hand, was an adult, with a sizable magical core, which meant releasing some of his magic from it was necessary to his continued health, but with his core as unstable as the average five year old, continued magical use could result in his core further destabilizing.  Worse still was the only solution he'd been able to find.</p><p>*****************</p><p>Gasping for breath, Draco leaned on his knees, sweat clinging to the muggle shirt and shorts he'd acquired from some sports shop in town.  As if associating with muggles and wearing their clothes was bad enough, the only way he's discovered to burn through his excess magic without exploding was, perhaps, the most muggle thing in the world.  Exercise, bloody exercise!  Malfoy's didn't exercise!  If he had to put up with this for one more day he would, he would.</p><p>He'd keep running because it was this or die, or even worse, lose is magic and he'd be damned if a little muggle activity bested him.</p><p>That night, after checking his core he was pleased to see it had settled by a measurable amount.  Not anywhere near enough to be out of the danger zone  but enough to know that, as disgusting a solution as it was, he'd at least found a solution.</p><p>*****************<br/>Deep slow breaths where before there had been coughing and heaving.  Long legs met the ground with easy strides as Draco worked his way around the route he’d set up for himself within his vast holdings.  He really didn’t want to admit it, but he was beginning to enjoy his time alone, running through his woods, lost in thought.  Well, he spent almost all of his time alone anyway, so that wasn’t really a change from the status quo, but the pounding of his feet on the forest floor and the scent of nature that filled his lungs were almost enough to make him forget why he was running in the first place.</p><p>It had been two weeks since he’d started his daily run, and he’d been making slow and steady improvement in stabilizing his magical core.  As a wizard, his magic naturally helped keep him healthy and maintain him, and so exercise had allowed the unstable access magic to heal the damage his exercions had caused him.  This had lead to a bit of a problem though, one of increasingly diminished returns.</p><p>He felt like he should be laughing at how sad muggles were, at how they didn’t have magic to help them recover, and how he was better at something he disliked than they were, it was only fitting that a Malfoy be the best right?  But instead he was just frustrated.  He’d ran further today than ever, and the day before that further than the last and so on, but his body had gotten to the point where less and less magic was needed to heal him after his run.</p><p>That night he checked his magical core and for the first time in a week the floor around him froze in jagged shards of ice as he read the readings in anger at the lack of improvement.  He’d stagnated, running had done all it could for him and he needed to find another solution and fast.</p><p> </p><p>*******************<br/>The next day he made his way back into the muggle sections of London.  He’d heard some of the mud-muggleborns at Hogwarts mention these gym places and how they were places muggles would go to exercise.  He wanted nothing to do with them, and the smell of sweat and the sound of grunts as he walked into the first gym he came across almost made him sprint off in the other direction.</p><p>“Oh, hello!”  a cute girl behind the receptionist desk smiled cheerfully, eyes wandering over Draco’s form in appreciation.  Draco rolled his own eyes in response to her gaze.  He knew he was hot, he didn’t need some muggle girl telling him. “Are you a new member or returning?  I think you’re new because I don’t recognize you, and I’m pretty sure I’d definitely recognize you, but if you have a membership card just swipe it here and be on your way, unless you’ve got any questions or if you are new then we can set up an account for you or maybe you’d like to try our free trial membership?”</p><p>She spoke faster than an excited Hermione, well, maybe not quite that fast, no one could spit out words faster than that girl.  Piecing together the jist of what she’d said, Draco fixed a neutral expression on his face and stepped forward.  “I’m new, and I’d like to try the free membership.”</p><p>“Great! I knew I hadn’t seen you before!  Alright so here’s the forms for you to fill out, and when you’re done with those just give them to me and you’ll be good to go!”</p><p>Looking at the mass of paperwork in his hand, Draco grimaced in distaste.  He knew that with his magic in the state it was he shouldn’t do something this stupid, but he was at the point where he really didn’t care.  Sliding his wand from the the holster on his forearm, he waved it at the girl as he handed the unfilled pages back to the talkative girl.  “Done”  he muttered and strode past the girl into the exercise area of the fitness center, where the smell of body odor and the sound of bangs, clangs and testosterone filled grunts filled the air.  It was almost enough to make him vomit.</p><p>Wandering aimlessly for a few minutes he spotted a man wearing an unnecessarily tight shirt standing in the corner with the word ‘trainer’ stretched across his chest.  Figuring he’d be a good a person as any to ask instructions on how to use all the giant clanging machines he made his way towards him.</p><p>“How do I use these?” asked Draco, not really in the mood for pleasantries.<br/>“Oh, hey kid, you new here?”  at Draco’s nod the trainer continued, “well technically your free trial doesn’t come with a personal trainer, but I guess I can show you a bit of the…”<br/>Draco tossed the man a galleon and smirked as his eyes widened comically at the lump of gold in his hand.<br/>“You’ll teach me what I want to know.”<br/>“Sure,sure, ya kid whatever you say.”</p><p>His time at the gym was, eventful to say the least.  He learned a lot about exercise, more than he’d ever really thought existed.  About his muscles and his diet and how his body worked, along with how to use all the machines in the gym and what they did.  By the end of the day Draco was exhausted, he felt more beat up and tired than he had after his first run by a long shot, but when he dragged himself home and tested his core, he couldn’t help the grin that spread across his face at the improvements made as he drifted off to sleep.</p><p>The next morning came and Draco felt like he’d just been through a round of the dark lord’s cruciatus.  Everything hurt, his whole body was sore and he could barely move.  His thoughts flashed back to the previous day.  “You’ve never worked out before?  I’m surprised!  You’re doing really well for your first time, but be warned, you’ve pushed yourself really hard today so you’re gonna be sore in the morning from all that lactic acid.”<br/>“Lactic acid”<br/>“Yeah man, when you work too hard you’re muscles can’t get enough air in them and start making lactic acid as an alternate energy source,  build up too much and you get really sore”<br/>“Oh, that doesn’t happen to me.”<br/>“Whatever you say kid, but just in case, we’re gonna do some cool down stretches to try and get rid of the buildup.”</p><p>It didn’t happen to him, or at least, it hadn’t happened before.  His magic was more that enough to heal any aches and pains in his muscles and get rid of any lactic acid build up, but this morning, every muscle in his body was screaming in protest at even the smallest of movements.  Gasping for a house elf he had it bring him a relaxation potion, only risking half of the drink due to his wild magic before standing unsteadily by his bed to slowly work through the cool down stretches the trainer had shown him.  It was painful, but as he worked out the kinks and knots in his arms, legs, chest, back and everywhere in between, he began to relax and feel better and better, enough, at least to go downstairs to the dining room for a bite to eat.</p><p>As he sat down and was greeted by a little elf ready to take his order for breakfast, he was again reminded of yesterday and the large emphasis the personal trainer had placed on proper diet and eating.  Trying to remember what it was he’d been told Draco had the elf make him eggs, vegetables and whatever else he could remember the man suggesting.</p><p>He returned to the gym that afternoon for one final time to learn any more information form the tight shirted trainer.  After another intense workout in the loud smelly gym he vowed to never return.  When he returned home he called an elf to him and gave instructions to purchase all of the same equipment he’d been using in the gym and to set it up in a room near his own.</p><p>Feeling sweaty and gross from the days exertions he went to wash up in his bathroom like most nights, the sweat clinging to his clothes causing him to peel them off quicker than normal in front of his bathroom’s full sized mirror.</p><p>“Looking good sweetie!” his mirror spoke in approval, and while Draco didn’t really want to admit that stupid muggle stuff had done anything to improve his physique, looking at his toned arms and legs, and the beginnings of a six pack of his skinny frame, he couldn’t help but think he looked pretty good.  He’d always just thought of exercise as an unpleasant thing he had to do to keep from exploding, but now, looking at himself he realized it came with a few other benefits as well.  After that he made a habit of changing in front of the mirror and viewing his progress after every workout.</p><p>He was pleased to see his core continued to settle down with every passing day, and was equally pleased that it looked like he wouldn’t have to worry about finding another way of lowering it as all he had to do when his body got used to the workout was increase the weights or change the exercises.  Not that he really had to do that very often at all.  The second day with the weights had been met with painful soreness, but not nearly as bad as the first.  He didn’t need a relaxation potion to move thankfully.  The third day he wasn’t really all that sore at all but continued his stretches just in case, and on the fourth day, he still stretched, but he wasn’t sore at all.</p><p>He measured his core every night and was surprised to see that even on the fourth night, he could see a noticeable decrease in the amount of wild magic flaring off.  At dinner that night he tried to figure out why until he figured that just because he didn’t feel any lactic acid build up, didn’t mean his magic wasn’t working to get rid of it.</p><p>*********************</p><p>After a week he saw the first sign that the workout was delivering less of a magical return, and upped the weights high enough to feel the same burn he had that first day in the gym.  The following morning, as he lie groaning in bed, trying to force his body to reach out and grab the unfinished relaxation potion by his bedside he cursed his stupidity at raising the weights by such a large amount.</p><p>When he finally sat up, and rubbed at his stomach to try and dissipate some of the soreness, he couldn’t help but look down and confirm what his hands felt.  Solid abdominals pressed out to meet his fingers through soft fabric, and for the first time that summer, Draco looked down at his nightshirt to see the buttons at his chest were straining a bit, his chest and shoulders stretching and distorting the fabric.  Stretching shirtless that morning he decided he was happy with the results, figuring it was only fitting that he get some benefit out of all his work aside from not dying, which, alright he honestly would have been alright with just not dying but this was a pretty good bonus.</p><p>********************</p><p>Draco heaved  a barbell into the air, bench pressing it with relative ease as his mind wandered.  ‘Hogwarts, my eighth year starts tomorrow’   he thought.  I’ve already been through the curriculum even if some of the classes were taught poorly by psychopathic death eaters, many of the core classes at least, were taught by the professors who refused to leave their students behind, so he felt confident in his ability to easily ace them a second time.</p><p>**********************</p><p>“Eighth years over here!”  the scottish accent of Professor, or rather, Headmistress McGonagall cut through the commotion of the Great Hall.  Because you’re all retaking you’re seventh year, and the dorms don’t have an eighth year sleeping arrangement, you’ve all been placed together in a dorm of your own.”  This was news to Draco, frustrating news since he was usually always aware of school decisions thanks to his father’s place on the Board of Governors.  He supposed this would just be something else he’d have to get used to.  He was thankful, at the very least, that his magic didn’t flare out to freeze anyone around him, happy that his efforts over the summer weren’t all for nothing.<br/>“Furthermore” McGonagall continued, “Many of you, for obvious reasons, failed to attend your seventh year, as  you all should have been graduated by now, the faculty and staff have decided to create an advanced curriculum for its returning eighth years.”  <br/>Moans and groans met her declaration of harder schoolwork.<br/>“Now this advanced curriculum was created because it would be unfair for those students who actually attended last year to learn nothing new this one.  That said, those of you who are behind will have to work hard to catch up, and since that’s frankly impossible to do alone for all but maybe one of you” Her eyes slid across the group to land on the redheaded bookworm. “Staff has paired you together in groups of two, one who’d attended school and one who hasn’t to help offset the knowledge gap”  </p><p>Draco couldn’t help but feel concern at those words, an impending sense of doom seemed to hover in the air.</p><p>“You will be rooming with your partner for the school year, the Eighth year arrangements are different from normal dorms and we were only able to fit two beds to a room.”</p><p>Yep, he wasn’t going to like this.  The Headmistress began listing the names of those paired together before finally.  “Malfoy, Draco!”  his head shot up from his musings.  “You will be partnered with Potter, Harry for the year.”</p><p>Wide green eyes looked up at his through coke bottle glasses.  Shit, well this sucked.</p><p>*********************</p>
