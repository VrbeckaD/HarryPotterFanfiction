    <p class="western">Laughter swirled around the tent, accompanying overly loud music and dancing lights. From somewhere came the drunken singing of his best man, and the proud and tearful bragging of his mum. But no sight nor sound stood so stunning as his wife, her face shining with joy and laughter, held in his arms, both of them looking as if they'd want nothing more than to be like this forever. But it didn't last. It never lasts.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The lights died and the laughter stopped all too suddenly to be natural, the tent was gone and the night sky threatened rain. No more guests, but fighters, warriors in a dark war, their wands ready for battle.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">And then they came; those monsters wearing the faces of humans, firing curses willy nilly, no skill, no accuracy. A tiny army of expendable enemies, all so easy to dodge, if not a bit distracting... Bill had relived the next moments so often, he could recite it like a poem...</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He barely dodged a stunning spell, leaping aside too quickly to realise he'd leapt into the grabbing arms of Fenris, his precious wand wrenched from his grip and kicked away. Fenris was built sturdier than Bill, he easily overpowered the young man, shoving him to the floor, kneeling on his stomach to hold him down, warm, rancid breath washing over his face. It smelt of death.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Then came the biting, over and over, sharp pains across his face followed by pulling and tearing, the sharp pains becoming drawn out and unbearable, hot breath on exposed meat, blood running into his eyes, screams lost under the yells of battle.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Bill woke with a start, twisted in his blankets, panting like a dog. Ground himself quick: the quilted blanket from his mum, the proggy rugs made by a close friend, his wife, sleeping soundly and heavily as always. He was at home, not the tower. The war was over, they were all safe. His eyes were stinging from tears, not blood. Fenris couldn't hurt him, or anyone else, ever again. A group of ridiculously determined monster hunters had broken into Azkhaban to ensure it.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">That dream happened a lot, Fenris attacking him, interrupting happy memories or wild adventures. It had been so commonplace from the time he'd been attacked to Victoire's birth. Barely a night had gone by without a visit from Fenris; it had gotten so bad he'd needed to take potions to sleep at all. They'd all but stopped when Victoire arrived, a constant reminder of why they'd suffered, he'd even joked to his mum that he was sleeping better with a new baby in the house, blaming it on having so many younger siblings. He'd never told anyone what the dreams were; no-one had seen him dodge the attack, and he'd never felt the need to say otherwise.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">But he'd been getting the dream more and more commonly recently, interrupting joyous dreams of his wedding, his children's birthdays, or long summer days at the beach. He hated it, but there wasn't that much to do about it. Maybe it was because it was getting close to 20 years since his attack, maybe it had no reason. Maybe he should talk to someone about it.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He picked up his wand from the bedside table and stood by the window to examine it, hoping to clear his head. He'd had it since he was 11, Uncle Gideon's old wand. His parents couldn't afford to buy him one back then, nor could they for Charlie, but while Charlie's wand from Uncle Fabian had happily worked for Ron, Bill's wand was stubborn. It wouldn't work for anyone but Gideon or bill, and even then Bill suspected it only worked for him because Uncle Gideon would let Bill play with it for a laugh. The wand had survived 2 wars, and was as reliable now as when it had first been bought countless years before. He'd never felt quite so helpless as when it had been taken from him back then, never felt so defenceless... he clutched it tighter, cautiously curious of whether the war would have ended the same without his most trusted weapon.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The sky was still pitch black through the window, no point in staying awake, but the cool room helped clear Bill's mind, and the trusty wand helped reassure him that he was safe. Eventually he returned to bed, embracing his beloved wife as he drifted away once more.</p><p> </p>
