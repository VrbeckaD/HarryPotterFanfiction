<p>Sirius can’t help but notice the young man who is wiping down a table, his dark hair messy, his skin a sickly pale shade of grey, his eyes tired. They make him look older than his years. He wonders if the boy is ill, if he can even work in this state. But then he watches him take a deep breath, and straighten his back, a certain strength coming over him. Hiding the weakness which had been written all over his face, his body, only moments before.<br/>“Are you even listening to a word I’m saying?” James asks, and Sirius snaps out of his thoughts, and looks over to his best friend, who is sitting across the table from him. “Are you alright?”<br/>“Yeah, sorry, I’m just… what were you saying?”<br/>“I was saying you really need to get yourself a job.”<br/>“I know,” Sirius interrupts him, looking down into his coffee.<br/>“You know I don’t mind paying, but…,” James says, an embarrassed look on his face, because he hates to talk about this subject. “This isn’t going to last forever, and you need to save up some money.”<br/>“I’ll get a job.”<br/>“You said that last year.”<br/>“And I did,” Sirius says, a mischievous smile on his face, an James raises an eyebrow. “What, I did!”<br/>“Make it a bit more… legal this time.”<br/>“When did you get so boring?” Sirius laughs, as James shakes his head, staring out of the window. “But I’ll get a job. I promise.”<br/>He looks back at the young man, who is now wiping down another table, and he still can’t help but wonder what his story is. Wonder if he’s okay. But then the boy looks up, straight into his eyes. He wants to look away, but he can’t. So he simply flashes a small smile. It makes the young man blush, and he goes back to wiping down the table. Sirius can’t help but smile as he watches him, now nervously keeping his face down. He is hoping that the boy will look up at him again, but he doesn’t.<br/>“So… ready to go?” James asks, after he has finished his coffee. Sirius wishes he could take a final look at the young man, but he is nowhere to be seen, so he simply gets up, grabs his coat, and follows James out of the café.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Ah, mrs. Potter,” Sirius laughs, when the beautiful red-haired young woman enters the apartment, carrying bags full of groceries.<br/>“Don’t.”<br/>“Still getting used to it?”<br/>“I’ll never get used to it,” she laughs, as Sirius gets up to take the bags from her. They go into the kitchen, and set down the bags. Lily sits down on a stool, letting out a sigh.<br/>“Long day?”<br/>“I want to go back to Hogwarts,” Lily says, and Sirius can’t help but laugh, as he goes over to her and wraps his arms around her. “Things were so much easier, weren’t they?”<br/>“You wouldn’t have to cook… clean…”<br/>“I wouldn’t have to do those things now, if you two would just…”<br/>“I love you,” Sirius laughs, before kissing the top of her head.<br/>“Bastard.”</p>
<p>“I was at the café, and they are looking for someone,” James says, as they are having dinner that night. Sirius looks up at him, a confused look on his face. “And you need a job, so…”<br/>“You want me to make coffee?”<br/>“The machine makes coffee. You’ll be serving it to people,” James says, and Sirius is about to open his mouth, but then he sighs. He knows he needs the job, because this arrangement won’t last forever. Sure enough, James is paying the rent for this apartment, and will pay for it as long as they live here, but now that he and Lily are married, they won’t want to share an apartment with someone else for much longer. So he knows he will need money to pay for his own place soon.<br/>“When?”<br/>“When what?” James asks, but by the smug look on his face Sirius can see that he knows exactly what he is asking.<br/>“When do I have to be there?”<br/>“Tomorrow at ten. Don’t be late.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“When can you start?”<br/>“You’re giving me the job?” Sirius asks, a confused look on his face. He was convinced he had messed up the interview, and he had already been rehearsing the conversation in his mind, where he had to tell James and Lily.<br/>“I am,” Hope says, a friendly smile on her face. “So when can you start?”<br/>“Ehm…  tomorrow?”<br/>“I’ll see you tomorrow at eight then. My son… where is he…,” Hope says, looking around the café. The young man Sirius had noticed when he and James had been here the other week, is standing behind the counter, looking happier, and much healthier now. “Ah, there he is. Remus, he will teach you all you need to know.”<br/>“He’s your son?”<br/>“He is. What, I’m too young to be his mum?” Hope laughs, and Sirius can’t help but smile. “I’m just teasing you, love. But yeah, that’s my boy. You will be working with him.”<br/>“I can’t wait.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“You must be Sirius,” Remus says, as he opens the door. The café is still closed, so he had knocked on the door, hoping to be let in. It had actually taken a little while, and Sirius had been about to turn and leave, when the door had opened. “Come in.”<br/>“I’m Remus,” the young man says, flashing a small and nervous smile.<br/>“Sirius, nice to meet you. So… your mum owns this place, huh?”<br/>“Yeah, she does. I’m not… I work hard though, so…,” Remus says, and Sirius can see the nervous look written all over his face. “I’m not just…”<br/>“I’m not judging you,” Sirius says, and he flashes a reassuring smile. “It was just a question.”<br/>“Right…”<br/>“So… what happened to the guy who had my job?”<br/>“Oh, she left,” Remus explains, as he leads Sirius to the room in the back. “She worked here since my mum opened the café, so…”<br/>“So I’m the first new guy?”<br/>“Yeah. It’s just the two of us, and mum. But mum usually only deals with the business side of things, you know? And she steps in when one of us is ill,” Remus explains, as Sirius hangs his coat up on a chair.<br/>“Don’t you ever get tired of it?”<br/>“Nah, I like it here,” Remus shrugs, and Sirius can’t help but smile at the kind and gentle nature of the young man. He seems down to earth, normal. The opposite of some of the people Sirius had dealt with back at Hogwarts, some of the people who had made him want to come here in the first place.</p>
<p>“Do you live around here?” Remus asks, as they are closing up the café later that day.<br/>“Yeah, my friends and I, we rent an apartment just a few minutes from here.”<br/>“You live with your friends?”<br/>“Mhm. After we graduated, we decided to move here, get away from it all for a few years. Before it all gets real, you know?” Sirius tries to explain, but then he realises that a stranger probably won’t understand. Especially not a Muggle, who has no idea about magic, about Hogwarts. “But now the two of them are married, I have an actual job…”<br/>“It’s all getting real,” Remus says, and Sirius can’t help but smile.<br/>“What about you? Do you live around here? Do you live with your mum?”<br/>“With my parents,” Remus explains. “My dad is away for work a lot though, but… yeah, we live here. Upstairs.”<br/>“Have you lived here all your life? You don’t sound Welsh.”<br/>“No, we moved here a few years ago. We moved around a lot, but mum is Welsh, and she lived here when she was younger, so…”<br/>“It’s beautiful here.”<br/>“You haven’t lived here long, have you?” Remus laughs, as he grabs two muffins, and hands one over to Sirius. Sirius can’t help but smile, as they sit down on one of the tables, and quietly eat their muffin. But he catches the shy young man looking at him, and he looks up at him.<br/>“What?”<br/>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“I want a double-choc-hazelnut-latte, triple-shot syrup, hold the cream, make it soy. Oh and…,” James rambles on, and Sirius can’t help but laugh.<br/>“That’s not even… a cappuccino then?”<br/>“Yes, please,” James laughs. “And a slice of… whatever that is,” he says, pointing at one of the cakes. “It’s not carrot cake, is it?”<br/>“It’s not,” Sirius laughs. “Sit down. It’s my treat.”<br/>“Thanks, man,” James says, before sitting down at one of the tables by the window. Remus comes up to Sirius, an uncomfortable look on his face.<br/>“I noticed he didn’t pay…”<br/>“Oh yeah, he’s my friend, he…”<br/>“You can’t give things away for free. I’m sorry, but…,” Remus says, and Sirius can’t help but smile at his nervousness. He puts a hand on his arm, and gives it a small squeeze.<br/>“Don’t worry, I was going to treat him. But I was going to pay for it myself later. I wouldn’t give away things for free.”<br/>“Oh…,” Remus says, looking more than embarrassed. “I’m so sorry, I…”<br/>“Don’t worry. I get it.”<br/>“Sorry,” Remus repeats, looking over at James. “He’s your…”<br/>“My best friend, James. I live with him and his wife, Lily. We all went to school together.”<br/>“I’ve seen you guys here before, haven’t I?” Remus asks, and Sirius can’t help but smile, remembering when he had been staring at him, and he had caught his eye, making him blush. He nods, and Remus seems to be remembering the moment now, because his cheeks turn a dark shade of red, and he looks down at his feet.<br/>“Remus?”<br/>“Yeah?”<br/>“Why don’t you come over to our place tonight? Hang out with us?” Sirius asks, and only after the words have left his mouth, does he realise what he has asked. He has asked Remus, a Muggle, to come over to their apartment. And although they are living without magic now, they are not hiding who they are back at the apartment. So bringing a Muggle there, it can only lead to trouble.<br/>But a shy smile appears on Remus’ face, and Sirius wonders if he has any friends of his own at all. If he ever hangs out with anyone other than Hope. Because he can see how genuinely surprised he is, and how much it means to him to get invited at all.<br/>“Are you sure? Won’t your friends mind?”<br/>“No, of course not. It’ll be great!”</p>
<p>“No, no way! You are not bringing a Muggle to the apartment,” James says, keeping his voice down, but somehow raising it at the same time. “Besides, isn’t he your boss?”<br/>“His mum is my boss, and he’s a really nice guy,” Sirius tries, but James shakes his head, as he looks over at Remus, who is serving a customer. “James, come on… Just tidy up the place, hide any…”<br/>“Evidence of what we are.”<br/>“I like this guy, James,” Sirius says, a pleading look on his face. “He makes me feel normal.”<br/>“And we don’t?”<br/>“You know what I mean. Please.”<br/>“Fine. But if he finds out… this is on you.”<br/>“I know. Thank you,” Sirius says, before giving James a big hug.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much for helping, those two in there never help,” Lily says, as Remus plates up dinner. “Well, that’s not technically true. They helped me once, but they nearly burned the kitchen down, so…”<br/>“So now we’re not allowed to help her anymore,” James interrupts her as he sits down at the kitchen table.<br/>“Just because you messed up once…”<br/>“I just don’t want to risk it,” James shrugs, and Lily slaps him in the arm, as she gives him a plate of food, before sitting down.<br/>“What’s your excuse?” Remus asks, as he hands Sirius his food, before sitting down next to him.<br/>“I can boil an egg. That’s it.”<br/>“Didn’t your mum ever teach you how to cook?” Remus laughs, but the atmosphere turns frosty, and he quickly looks down at his plate. “Sorry.”<br/>“No, I… I don’t have the kind of family you have. No mum to teach me how to cook,” Sirius admits.<br/>“Oh, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have…I can teach you,” Remus says, still looking uncomfortable, and he is actually making things more uncomfortable, but Sirius knows that he means well.<br/>“You better say yes, because you cannot live on boiled eggs,” Lily says, and Sirius can’t help but laugh. “And it’d be nice to have you cook dinner for once.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about before,” Remus says, as Sirius is walking him home. “I shouldn’t have assumed.”<br/>“You didn’t know. But… I actually lived with James, before we moved here. I was never a part of my family, and my mum… she was never a mother to me,” Sirius explains. “James’ mother was like a mother to me, but… I didn’t have what you have.”<br/>“I’m sorry.”<br/>“I don’t need them. I have a family,” Sirius says, but Remus can see the pain written all over his face. He reaches out to touch Sirius’ hand, but at the last moment pulls back. But Sirius has already noticed, and can’t help but smile. “You can touch me, you know?”<br/>“I…”<br/>“I don’t bite,” Sirius says, a mischievous smile on his face. Remus shakes his head, smiling to himself, as he looks up at the sky. “I wouldn’t even mind you touching my hand.” Sirius admits, and from the corner of his eye he can see Remus’ face turning a dark shade of red. “Did I say too much?” Sirius asks, but Remus doesn’t say a word. They simply walk on in silence, both processing everything that has been said today.</p>
