  <strong>Chapter One</strong>
</p><p>"Come on," Sirius said. "I've seen you trying to follow us."</p><p>Severus looked at Sirius incredulously. It was a rarity that Sirius would talk to Severus. There was something about all of this that didn't sound right.</p><p>"When do you want to meet?" Severus asked.</p><p>"Meet me at the entrance at nine o'clock," Sirius said. He was trying his best not to smile. "I'll take you down there myself."</p><p>"If you're fooling me—" Severus started.</p><p>"I'm not fooling," Sirius cut the Slytherin off.</p><p>"Alright," Severus conceded.</p><p>Severus walked off. Sirius watched him, smirking.</p><p><em>This is going to be so much fun</em>, Sirius thought. <em>I can't wait to see Snivellus wet his pants when he sees what's under that tree.</em></p><p>Later that night, Severus snuck out of his dormitory and headed for the front entrance. Severus was doubtful that Sirius was really going to show. When he saw Black standing by in the courtyard, Severus walked towards him.</p><p>"Didn't think you were actually going to show," Sirius said.</p><p>"I'm not the coward you seem to think," Severus said. "I don't have to hide behind Potter and Lupin."</p><p>Sirius wanted to reply to that remark, but figured what Severus was walking into would be its own reward.</p><p>The two teens walked to the front court.</p><p>"Where are we going?" Severus asked. "If you're taking me on a wild goose chase, Black…"</p><p>"Don't worry," Sirius said. "You will see what we do. I'm not fooling you."</p><p>They were quiet after that until they ended at the edge of the Whomping Willow tree.</p><p>"Why are we here?" Severus said.</p><p>"It's down there," Sirius said.</p><p>Sirius picked up a small rock and aimed it towards the base of the tree. Hitting its mark, the tree stopped moving. Sirius started moving towards the tree.</p><p>"You coming or what?" Sirius asked, when he saw that Severus didn't follow.</p><p>Not wanting to seem like a coward, Severus followed. The two teens went into the trap door under the tree. Severus saw that there was a small stairway that led to a tunnel. His curiosity got the best of him. He went down the few steps and walked down the tunnel. In his quest, Severus didn't realize that Sirius wasn't with him.</p><p>There was a noise at the end of the tunnel. It was faint at first. He kept walking as if he were in a trance. Something was pulling him towards the noise. Severus found himself at a rickety door. Some of the panels were hanging by a few fragments of wood. The knob was hanging off the door. It wasn't even keeping the door fastened to the wall.</p><p>Severus slowly opened the door and stepped through.</p><p>_000_000_000</p><p>Sirius couldn't stop laughing. His sides were hurting, he was laughing so much. When he made it to the Gryffindor tower, his head was hurting.</p><p>James was alone in the common room, sitting in front of the fireplace. He was reading a comic his father sent him in his care-package that his mother would send every month. James looked up when Sirius walked in.</p><p>"What's so funny?" James asked, smiling at Sirius.</p><p>The dog animagus laughing seemed to brighten up the room.</p><p>"Snivellus is going to get the scare of his life," Sirius said, chuckling.</p><p>"What do you mean?" James said smiling. He along with Sirius loved playing pranks on the lonely Slytherin.</p><p>"He keeps following us when we leave the castle," Sirius said.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Well, I let him see where we go," Sirius said, sounding proud of himself.</p><p>Sirius sat down on the sofa next to James.</p><p>"What are you talking about?" James asked. His smile leaving his face.</p><p>"I led him to the Whomping Willow," Sirius said, sighing.</p><p>"You did what?" James exclaimed, getting up from the sofa.</p><p>"What?" Sirius asked, looking up at James.</p><p>"You sent Severus to the Shrieking Shack?" James said.</p><p>Sirius was surprised to hear James call Severus by his name.</p><p>"What's the big deal?" Sirius asked. For the first time he wasn't smiling, standing in front of James.</p><p>"You do realize what time of the month it is?" James scolded.</p><p>"Yeah," Sirius said. "Why do you think I sent him down there?"</p><p>"Are you trying to get Remus killed?" James yelled, pushing Sirius, rushing towards the portrait.</p><p>"Why are you so angry?" Sirius asked.</p><p>James turned around and walked back towards Sirius. "What do you think will happen if Moony attacks Severus or even kills him?" James growled, quietly, "if the werewolf kills or hurts Severus, they could put Moony down. In other words, kill him."</p><p>James didn't wait for a reply has he turned and rushed out of the portrait.</p><p>It took no time for James to reach the front entrance. When he got to the Whomping Willow he rushed to the knob that stopped the tree with great ease. He didn't feel the branches hitting him or trying to swipe him off his feet. The only thing on his mind was getting to Severus before Moony killed him.</p><p>Once James got to the tunnel, he instantly changed into his animagus form and rushed to the Shrieking Shack.</p><p>_000_000_000</p><p>Severus opened the door and saw a rundown staircase. The crashing sounds and growling were louder than before. Severus slowly walked up the stairs. Walking up the stairs, Severus had to reach for the railing. He felt the stairway move. He had to catch himself. There was dust settling down to the floor. Once he got his footing, he got to the top of the landing.</p><p>_000_000_000</p><p>Remus was cursed.</p><p>He hated himself. Every month he was forced to lose himself.</p><p>Remus was laying on the old dusty bed. The threadbare, scratchy sheets was affecting his sensitive skin.</p><p>A strangled groan passed his lips as the muscles felt like it was tearing from his bones. His bones felt like they were breaking, while dislocating through the change. Tears streamed down Remus' face as the pain began to become more and more excruciating.</p><p>There was a creaking sound as if someone was coming up the stairs, but the pain Remus was going through, he couldn't think on it. During the spasms of his muscles, Remus got a glimpse of someone standing at the door. With his headaches becoming unbearable, he wished whoever was there that they would leave before he didn't have the capacity of restraint.</p><p>_000_000_000</p><p>Severus couldn't believe what he was seeing. Remus was changing. During several of the classes in Defense, Severus knew that Remus was changing into a werewolf. The screams and groans told Severus that the transformation was agonizing for the person.</p><p>Severus didn't much care for any of the Gryffindors. They were horrid towards him in more than one occasion. But even Severus wasn't sadistic to watch all the pain that Remus was going through.</p><p>Severus was in shock of what he was seeing. Seeing someone in pain reminded him of his home life.</p><p>"L…eav…ee," Remus moaned.</p><p>Severus was frozen in the spot he was standing. He began hearing bones breaking. Remus' howl started changing, sounding more and more like a dog.</p><p>Remus rolled off the bed and stood up. Severus didn't see the Gryffindor boy that stood by while his friends picked on him. There was an eight-foot werewolf. It walked over to Severus. The Slytherin finally felt movement in his legs as he backed up. It wasn't fast enough as the wolf swung at him.</p><p>Pain radiated through Severus side. He fell on the floor, sliding a bit from the force of the hit. Severus tried to sit up, but his side felt like it was on fire. It was hard to breathe. The pain was causing Severus to blackout. The last thing he saw before sinking into the darkness was hind-legs stretching. Severus passed out.</p><p>_000_000_000</p><p>It didn't take long for James to reach the Shrieking Shack. Once he got to the stairway, he rushed up the stairs as fast as he could without falling through the worn-out steps. He heard the tale-tell signs that Remus had changed into Moony. When he got to the landing, he saw Moony strike Severus.</p><p>James changed into the stag and rushed forward. Severus was unconscious on the floor. Moony was about to make another strike when Prongs stood over Severus' limp body and pierced Moony with his antlers. It didn't stop Moony, but it did change his target.</p><p>Moony forgot about the body laying on the floor and went for the stag. Prongs knew that the only way to keep Severus safe, he would have to lure Moony out of the Shack and lead him to the forest. Moony could take care of himself in the forest. Prongs just had to remember to come back before the sun came up to carry Remus back to the Shack.</p><p>Prongs loved being a stag as he could jump from high places and not hurt himself from the fall. Instead of running down the stairs, risking breaking the step or his leg, the stag jumped over the railing and landed on the bottom floor. The wolf followed.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, James returned to the Shack to check on Severus. Moony was "safely" in the forest. James knelt beside Severus' prone form. He put his finger under Severus' nose to see if he was still breathing. When he felt the puff of air on his finger, he sighed a huge relief. James tried to think of the best way to get Severus to the Infirmary. Casting a feather-weight charm on the Slytherin, James levitated Severus to the entrance of the Whomping Willow. Stepping through the entrance at the bottom of the tree, he saw that Sirius was standing at the base.</p><p>"What happened?" Sirius asked.</p><p>James looked at his friend with contempt. Yeah, they picked on Severus. But never did they do something this heartless. Severus gave as good as he got, but this. James didn't know what to think.</p><p>"What did you expect to happen?" James growled.</p><p>James changed back into Prongs. It was harder to do magic in animagus form. It took strong feelings to bring out the magic through the animal. The way that James was feeling it wasn't hard to channel his magic.</p><p>Severus was raised on Prongs' back. Prongs slowly walked back to the castle, leaving Sirius behind. When he got to the front door, he changed back and lowered Severus to the ground.</p><p>Rushing in the school, James went to the Infirmary.</p><p>"Madam Pomfrey," James called out. "Madam Pomfrey."</p><p>"What is it?" Poppy said, walking out of her office. "Mr. Potter, what are you doing out of bed?"</p><p>"I know I shouldn't be strolling the corridors," James said. "But there was something that happened. A student is hurt."</p><p>"What?" Poppy asked. "Where?"</p><p>"At the entrance," James said.</p><p>Both ran out of the Infirmary. When they got to the entrance, Poppy gasped. She sent out a Patronus. She knelt by the student and turned to see who it was.</p><p>"Sweet Merlin," Poppy gasped.</p><p>She began running a diagnostic charm over Severus' body. There were a rush of footfalls coming towards James and Poppy. James turned around and saw Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Slughorn coming towards them.</p><p>"Poppy," Albus asked. "What has happened?"</p><p>"Severus was attacked," Poppy said. "I need to get him to the infirmary."</p><p>Minerva transfigured her handkerchief into a stretcher while Poppy levitated Severus' body on it. The two witches went towards the Infirmary. Professor Slughorn followed.</p><p>Professor Dumbledore looked at James.</p><p>"Would you and Mr. Black accompany me to my office?" Albus said.</p><p>James turned around, but he didn't see Sirius.</p><p>"Come from hiding, Sirius," Albus said, his voice was soft.</p><p>Sirius walked from the courtyard entrance towards James and Dumbledore. Without another word, Albus turned and headed to his chambers. James and Sirius followed.</p><p>
