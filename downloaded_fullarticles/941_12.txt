    <p>Apparently, the Christmas hols at Hogwarts were meant for snogging. Hermione Granger, new Transfiguration Professor, had discovered and put a halt to not one, not two, but three pairs of snogging students in unused classrooms and broom closets.</p><p> </p><p>Happening upon the steamy intimacy left Hermione more lonely than she’d felt in some time. She longed for a partner. None of the other professors were near enough to her age for her to even consider an arrangement of convenience, let alone attempt a romantic connection.</p><p> </p><p>Near-empty bottle of wine in-hand, Hermione found herself on the seventh floor, drunkenly and playfully wondering how fully the Room of Requirement might fulfil her needs.</p><p> </p><p>Focusing with as much concentration as she was able in her inebriated state, Hermione paced back and forth before the wall that housed the Room of Requirement.</p><p> </p><p><em>“Someone real… Someone living… Someone single… My ideal match… Someone to take away my loneliness… Someone to take my damned virginity…” </em>she furiously thought.</p><p> </p><p>Daring to crack her eyes open, Hermione was pleasantly surprised to see that a door had appeared. After the Fiendfyre incident, she wasn’t certain how much of the enchanted room had survived.</p><p> </p><p>Giddy with what she’d asked for, Hermione’s palm was clammy on the door. Regardless, she pushed it open and stepped into a cavernous bedroom, dominated by a four-poster bed and lit by gentle candlelight.</p><p> </p><p>When her eyes fell on the wizard standing before the fireplace, the forgotten bottle of wine slipped from Hermione’s fingers. She’d know that hair, anywhere…</p><p> </p><p>Lucius Malfoy turned quickly at the sound of shattering glass.</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione Granger,” he said in his strangely modulated voice.</p><p> </p><p>Mind spinning, Hermione didn’t reply and she couldn’t seem to move her feet. Was he real?</p><p> </p><p>“Where are we?” he asked.</p><p> </p><p>“The Room of Requirement,” she finally replied, voice quiet.</p><p> </p><p>“At Hogwarts…” Lucius mused then added, “You <em>require</em> something of me..?”</p><p> </p><p>Specter or not, Hermione would only benefit from talking things out. “I asked for my ideal match to…”</p><p> </p><p>“Your <em>ideal match</em>…” Lucius repeated, brows arched.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes… I would have never guessed it would be you.” Hermione muttered, recovering from her shock. Lucius didn’t need to know every sordid detail of what she ‘required.’</p><p> </p><p>Catching up with her actions, Hermione hastily vanished her broken bottle and closed the door after stepping fully into the room. Her gaze noted shelves beside the bed. There were books and… And… Mother of Merlin! The Room had supplied a variety of erotic paraphernalia, most of which, Hermione had never before seen. A hot blush crawled up her neck. Had Lucius seen them..?</p><p> </p><p>A cart of glass decanters appeared beside the wizard. “I could become accustomed to this,” Lucius murmured, helping himself.</p><p> </p><p>If he’d noticed the shelves beside the bed, he gave no indication.</p><p> </p><p>Watching as Lucius poured himself a drink, Hermione’s mind folded in on itself, once more. It was an elaborate detail that a specter generated by the Room would want a drink and provide a cart. The tiny hairs on the back of Hermione’s neck stood straight up. He was part of the room… Wasn’t he..? Was it possible the room had summoned the wizard, himself..? …Was he wearing anything under his dressing robe?</p><p> </p><p>“Are you real..?” she wondered.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius sipped deeply from the tumbler in his hand before fixing her with his pale gaze. He lifted a brow. “I believe I am…”</p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t you supposed to be..?”</p><p> </p><p>“In Azkaban,” he replied with a sharp glance. “For five more months.”</p><p> </p><p>At a loss, Hermione remained stubbornly by the door. Had she conjured Lucius Malfoy from his prison cell?</p><p> </p><p>Two comfy chairs appeared before the fireplace. Lucius shot Hermione a lingering glance, looking her down, then up. His eyes narrowed as they darted thoughtfully towards the bed and then back to her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me about this room…” Lucius said and gestured for Hermione to take one of the chairs.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione reasoned that he had, indeed, seen the contents of the shelves. Legs stiff with anticipation, she took a stumbling first step but quickly caught herself and walked to the overstuffed chair before the fire. Not until she sat down did she realize that she wore only a cobalt negligee that left little to the imagination.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s suspected this room has some sentience… It can be entered by persons in real need. And it will be equipped with whatever the person needs…” Hermione explained, drawing her legs up under her in the chair. She felt his gaze but couldn’t bring herself to meet it.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah,” he replied. “Is it any relation to the Room of Hidden Things?”</p><p> </p><p>“One and the same. Or, it was. I’m not convinced all of its aspects survived a bout of Fiendfyre…”</p><p> </p><p>The wizard’s lack of further questions confirmed that he knew of the tragic incident.</p><p> </p><p>After a lengthy silence in which Hermione stared at the crackling fire, Lucius set aside his empty tumbler with a clack.</p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Granger,” he began. Not until Hermione finally looked at him did he continue. “It is by your will I am here and not shivering in a miserable cell. Is there something you wish of me..?”</p><p> </p><p>Where was her legendary Gryffindor courage? Hermione couldn’t seem to form a coherent word. The notorious Malfoy patriarch was asking if there was something he could do for her.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t – I can’t…” she helplessly shrugged, feeling her face warm, once more.</p><p> </p><p>“I understand loneliness,” he offered in a near-inaudible hiss.</p><p> </p><p>“Your wife..?” Hermione asked, genuinely interested.</p><p> </p><p>“Gone,” Lucius replied bitterly.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s happier.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione couldn’t keep her gaze from the man. She supposed him to be just a bit older than her father. Of all wizards, why him?</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve got a question,” Lucius prompted. “Your eyes give everything away,” he added.</p><p> </p><p>With a lifted brow, Hermione threw caution to the wind. “I was just thinking ‘of all wizards, why you?’”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you know..?”</p><p> </p><p>Surprised, Hermione met his pale gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m your <em>ideal match</em>,” he replied with a glint in his eye that made Hermione’s insides melt.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione was too shocked at being teased by Lucius Malfoy to laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“What, precisely, did you intend to <em>do</em> with me..?” he purred, leaning towards her.</p><p> </p><p>Pinned by his heavy-lidded gaze, Hermione’s mind went blank. The wizard stood and moved until he was towering over her. She watched, utterly captivated, not to mention still a little drunk, as he slowly leaned towards her, hands braced on the arms of her chair. Hermione’s limbs tingled with anticipation.</p><p> </p><p>“The contents of this room leave little doubt…” he whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Face warm with embarrassment, Hermione lifted her hand and drew slender fingertips down his jaw.</p><p> </p><p>“None of this is real…”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course not,” Lucius hissed.</p><p> </p><p>His lips tasted like whisky and his breath ignited her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius kissed her as if sipping from her; tantalizingly pressing his lips to hers for soft, lingering moments. When he leaned in and slipped his tongue assertively up her neck, Hermione forgot how to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>He plucked her from the chair and carried her to the bed as if she weighed nothing. His arm around her waist lifted her, sliding her up the bed, settling her so that her head rested on pillows, and he followed to lay beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Examining the man so close with such intimacy was surreal. Being inebriated allowed her to study his pale eyes without shame; he considered her in return, a hint of consternation between his brows.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t stop, now,” she whispered, shyly lifting a hand to touch his chin. Her fingertips caressed his stubbled jaw and smoothed across his lower lip. A hand wrapped around her wrist, holding her fingers to his mouth. With a groan, he sucked the tip of her index finger and gently drew it between his teeth. Hermione filled with sudden heat and gave a sharp gasp.</p><p> </p><p>“Anything in particular you like..?” he asked in a low tone, keeping a firm hold on her wrist.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione blinked at him as her brain attempted to come up with an answer.</p><p> </p><p>“I like your eyes,” she said softly.</p><p> </p><p>A chuckle rumbled through the wizard. “That isn’t what I meant but thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Hermione replied, suddenly feeling sober. Could she tell him she was a virgin? Should she? Would he be angry? Was he even real..?</p><p> </p><p>With furrowed brows, he released her wrist and slowly traced the slope of her hip.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me if I do something you don’t like,” he said.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione met his captivating, pale eyes once more and was calmed. He may have been chosen for her by the strange magic of Hogwarts but being with him felt, and she was well aware of the cliché, right. Regardless, she couldn’t help but wonder if it was the enchantment of the room guiding his actions. Was he acting by choice? Full circle, was he real?</p><p> </p><p>“Promise,” she hissed, unconsciously leaning closer to him.</p><p> </p><p>He gently slid the silk gown up her thigh, fingers drifting in a teasing trail. A buzz of pleasure followed his touch. Emboldened, Hermione mirrored Lucius with a leisurely exploration of his chest. She grinned, watching her finger part its way through the salt and pepper patches of curls. He went still, watching her as she watched her hand. As her hand wandered towards the tie of his dressing robe, he pulled the knot and Hermione was treated to an unabashed view of Lucius in all of his glory.</p><p> </p><p>Heat crawled up her neck. Before she could withdraw her hand, Lucius took her wrist and guided her to his erection.</p><p> </p><p>Utterly won over by her curiosity, Hermione glanced between his face and the warm length of flesh she fondled. Lucius closed his eyes and sighed as she gently explored him. She was intrigued by the softness of the skin and contemplated sucking on him. Wizards enjoyed that, didn’t they?</p><p> </p><p>“Now, you,” he said, disrupting Hermione’s inexperienced petting by swiftly sliding his hand under her silky gown to rest on her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>With a shy bite of her bottom lip, Hermione sat up and pulled the negligee over her head.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius’ indrawn breath and appreciative inspection of her bare body imbued her with more confidence.</p><p> </p><p>With a growl, Lucius suddenly grabbed her, drawing her beneath him and pinning her, hands on her arms and knees between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>“Go slow,” she whispered, anxiously.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” he replied, leaning in to capture her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Absorbed by Lucius’ talented mouth, Hermione mewed to feel him slipping against her nether lips, coating his erection with the evidence of her arousal.  She turned her head, breaking their kiss, to gasp as he pressed against her, seeking entrance.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so tight,” he hissed.</p><p> </p><p>Pressure increased at her crux, almost painful, but she widened her knees, encouraging him. Suddenly, she felt herself stretch enough to accommodate Lucius’ girth. He pushed himself deeper and she gasped as a sharp pain lit through her, startling her.</p><p> </p><p>“Damn it, girl. You didn’t tell me you were a virgin,” Lucius growled through his teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” Hermione breathed. The pain was subsiding as Lucius remained motionless. Hermione mulled the oddness of having a man so close and inside of her. Particularly one she never considered as a potential lover.</p><p> </p><p>“Lucius,” she whispered, reaching up to touch his clenched jaw. “It’s alright.”</p><p> </p><p>His features relaxed a bit and he leaned in to kiss her, again. His arms trembled but he held himself still within her and she felt her body soften, as well. Only once she was buzzing with desire, once more, did Lucius shift within her and the sensation was electric. Giddy pleasure shot through Hermione’s limbs, stoked hotter with each thrust of Lucius hips. Within moments, he began moving faster and harder, pressing deeper.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah!” he gasped, signaling the start of his release.</p><p> </p><p>Encouraged by his climax, Hermione suddenly tripped into black bliss, as well, clinging tightly to the body above her.</p><p> </p><p>Upon emerging from the cocoon of climax, Hermione curled into the warm body beside her. She nestled her head upon his shoulder and felt his arm slip around her, holding her close. The heartbeat thumping under her ear slowed and she sighed in contentment as she fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p>In the morning, Hermione was alone.</p><p> </p><p>With an aching head and dry mouth, Hermione took stock of herself as she awoke. As pieces of her memory came together creating a clear picture of the night, she sat up.</p><p> </p><p><em>“Lucius Malfoy...” </em>she breathed.</p><p> </p><p>If it weren’t for the tender state of her body, she’d have suspected the night a dream. Her breath caught as she recalled the smell of whisky on his lips and weight of his body on hers. Free of observation, Hermione fell back onto the bed, shuddering with the memory of pleasure. It had been incredible. Every caress, every nip, and every moan.</p><p> </p><p>As she drew on the negligee, she wished she had proper robes – there was no telling who she might encounter in the corridors on her way back to her rooms. A flash of black cloth told her that the Room had provided, once more.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered, pausing to look about before slipping back to the real world.</p>
