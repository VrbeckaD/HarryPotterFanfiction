  <u>PART 1</u>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She comes to herself slowly, unwillingly. It’s in pieces at first, her mind drifting in and out of consciousness. She struggles, eyes too heavy to open, thoughts fractured, unable to focus. Her body lies in mourning. Her soul, her magic - she still cannot grasp it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">No longer capable, she hears Dumbledore telling her parents while she lies, still as death in the hospital wing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">No longer capable of magic, he had said, as if those words could fully explain the pressing weight keeping her tethered to the bed, making each movement unbearable. The feeling of something crawling under her skin haunts her; she can feel the ghost of his hands on her body, keeping her company, digging deeper into her mind, touching her - </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The days pass, and she tries not to sleep. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Healers, when they come, are powerless. Potions and spells, neither can heal a body unreceptive to magic. So she withers, feeling violated and broken, as if Tom’s hands had not only been on her, but in her, holding her soul, and taking pieces of it with him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Weeks pass, and the end of term arrives with no solutions from the greatest medical minds. Magic, once gone, cannot be replaced. It is the fundamental law of the magical world; a gift born to a select few, which she has squandered and lost through her own misguided and careless act of trust. She is sent away from Hogwarts quietly, shamefully, never again to see the halls her family roamed for centuries. The Burrow, once she gets there, is no better. Once her childhood refuge, now only a bitter reminder of all she has lost, all touches of the magic of a wizarding home now alienating her from her family.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Molly, naturally, tries to make the best out of things, having thought lovingly but selfishly all the same, that her daughter coming home would mean plentiful time, opportunities to sit in each others company, moments to bond through tales passed on from mother to daughter. She had been unable to succeed the year before, when her daughter displayed the fierceness of her brothers, and little of Arthur’s gentle temperament at the mention of sitting quietly. Perhaps now, she thought, her youngest might be more settled, willing to sit by the fire and knit or draw, or engage in gentle conversation with her mother.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If anything, it is the opposite. Attempts to motivate Ginny are met with silence. The absence of the tenacity or temper that made had her the most formidable of the seven children concern Molly and Arthur. Uneasy with her drastic change in character, they refuse to take Dumbledore’s word that all will be healed given time, and take Ginny to see the MindHealers of St. Mungo’s. For the next few months, diagnoses of ‘female hysteria,’ ‘sullenness,’  and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>‘melancholia’ are tossed around from Healer to Healer, and their treatment plans of electroshocks and firm discipline not doing much to assuage the Weasley family. Five healers and a year later they finally decide to enrol Ginny in the local muggle school. With funding from Dumbledore as ‘reparation fee’ for damages, Ginny is enlisted in several extra-curricular activities to keep her as busy and out of the house as possible. Every day is a battle, and getting Ginny out of bed becomes a job in and of itself, but her parents push on, and keep her attending her lessons as much as they can. There are the bad days of course, where no matter how much cajoling, pleading, bribing and forcing won't get her up, but as the year passes, those days grow fewer and further between.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Summer arrives, and sightings of Ginny are harder to come by as Harry takes up residence in their home. Gone before breakfast and back past supper, she claims to be visiting at friends' houses before disappearing up in her room for the night, only to be gone the next morning, often ignoring her mother's pleas to sit and have breakfast. Telling herself to believe Ginny when she says she is off having fun with her muggle friends, Molly gives up and turns her attention to her magical children who give her the play by play of the Quidditch World Cup. With the Triwizard Tournament fast approaching, Molly fears this new wave of death-eater behaviour is only a sign of times to come.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Molly is right; things only go down hill from there. With Harry in forced into the tournament, the death of Cedric, and the rise of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, by June, the house is in shambles. The Burrow is packed up, and for the first time in Molly and Arthur’s married lives they move house, transporting their belongings to the childhood manor of an escaped convict and his rabid House Elf.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It is only when they receive Ginny’s yearly school report via muggle post does Molly realize she had not thought of transferring Ginny to a school in London for the new year. Ashamed, and more than slightly horrified at herself for loosing track of one of her children, she scrambles to enrol Ginny in a public school close to the safe house after it has been reaffirmed by Dumbledore that it be best if the family remain in London for the year. Trusting the safety of her daughter’s transit to school with Arthur (who ensures her that the muggle underground is perfectly safe) she turns her energy to the needs of the Order, and hopes that the coming war will not be as destructive as the one some 16 years prior.</span>
