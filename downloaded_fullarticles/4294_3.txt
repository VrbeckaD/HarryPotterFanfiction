          <div class="userstuff"><p>“You had some nerve doing that!” Ginny yells after Cho.</p><p>Cho swings around to face her. She has changed out of her Quidditch uniform and into her Ravenclaw robes. Her hair is done up in a loose bun, and her eyes are kind. A wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, I just got caught up in the thrill of it all—”</p><p>“Look, I get that you were upset Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw, but why go to the extent of spelling out ‘<i>ginny, will you date me</i>’ in the sky for everyone to see?”</p><p>“Is it a no?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“I like you, Ginny. You’re spunky and fearless and your freckles are cute. The offer was genuine, and still stands.”</p><p>“Oh. I thought— oh.” Tall, pretty Cho Chang liked <i>her</i>? “If this isn’t an attempt to embarrass me, then sure, I guess.”</p><p>“You sound real confident there.”</p><p>“<i>Yes</i>. That’s a yes,” Ginny says. “On one condition, though. We don’t go to Madam Puddifoot’s or anywhere cheesy like that for our first date. I have tickets for the Quidditch game over Winter Break.”</p><p>Cho’s eyes widen, and Ginny has already thought <i>adorable</i> before she can stop herself.</p><p>“Holyhead Harpies vs. Tutshill Tornados?”</p><p>“Mmm. Harry pulled some strings for me.”</p><p>Cho’s smile drops for a second. <i>Right</i>. Don’t mention the ex-boyfriend. Then her smile returns, better than ever. “Okay, from now on I’m dating you exclusively for Quidditch tickets.”</p><p>“Is that all?” Ginny’s tone is playful as she drags Cho in for a kiss.</p></div>
