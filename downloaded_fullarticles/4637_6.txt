        <em> <strong>A few hundred years after the War in Heaven</strong> </em>
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, Father." A voice whispered brokenly from deep inside the cave in the earth. "I'm so sorry." Chains rattled loudly as the figure clasped his hands in front of him, blood dripping from torn figures. Tears poured from emerald green eyes, cleaning soot-covered cheeks to reveal pale skin. Giant wings, once a bright white, were twisted beyond use and blackened with the shame of sin.</p>
      <p>"Father!" Lucifer cried from his cage in Hell. "Forgive me for my betrayal for I am so sorry!" Tears followed more freely as the Fallen choked out a sob. "I was a fool! A fool who thought he knew best and was drunken on his own supposed superiority! I care not if I ever leave this agony, but please," His voice cracked as tangled, dirt-covered hair fell over his face. "Please forgive this blasphemous fool."</p>
      <p>
        <em>You are no fool.</em>
      </p>
      <p>His head shot up, eyes widening in shock and awe. "Father?" he gasped.</p>
      <p><em>Yes, my son. </em>A warm light began to fill the lonely cave, coming from nowhere yet everywhere. <em>I have heard your prayers.</em></p>
      <p>Lucifer shut his eyes in shame and bowed his head. "I am not worthy of your presence… I have fallen, led others astray to betray you, became the father of the monster's that wreak your earth… I deserve nothing but your deepest hate…"</p>
      <p><em>And yet you only receive my love and forgiveness. </em>A feeling of warm and love washed over the desolate fallen angel. <em>You've have spent many centuries trapped, Lucifer, but only now do you show remorse for your actions. It makes me happy with you.</em></p>
      <p>"You…forgive me?" Lucifer asked, as if it were too good to be true. "You're happy with me?"</p>
      <p><em>Yes, child. </em>The glowing light somehow grew even brighter, completely blocking out the disturbing background. It even seemed to clean the broken angel—blood sizzled out of existence, dirt and sweat completely disappeared, wing bones mending themselves back to health (though the feathers still stayed black). The chains refused to vanish; instead, the rusting iron it was made from turned to soft gold. <em>I believe it is safe to say that the punishment no longer fits the crime.</em></p>
      <p>"I…" The Fallen One glanced around himself, shaking in shock. "I don't understand, I thought—"</p>
      <p><em>That I would leave you? </em>The voice sounded amused. <em>No, Lucifer. But I'll give you a choice. You can stay here until the 66 seals are broken, or I could send your soul into the human reincarnation cycle.</em></p>
      <p>Lucifer tilted his head down and to the left. Humans. Creatures he hated because they'd destroy the world his Father created. But…they were also his Father's creations… Being in this cave had given him one thing—time to think. Surely his Father wouldn't create creatures who would only destroy?</p>
      <p>
        <em>If you accept to be human, then I will remove your grace and memories, and put them into several objects that will return them to you when your sentence is up. If you stay here, you'll keep your grace and memories, but it will be several millennia before the seals break.</em>
      </p>
      <p align="center">A small smile graced Lucifer's face for the first time in centuries. "You're making it obvious which one you want me to choose."</p>
      <p><em>Yes,</em> the voice agreed. <em>But the choice is yours to make.</em></p>
      <p>"My Father," The Morning Star raised his arms out into a cross, hands and face turned upward. "Do with me as you will."</p>

      <p>The ten year old boy watched as man after man strained themselves to pull the sword out of the stone. As the hours pasted and no one could even make it budge, the crowd thinned until only the boy was left. Cautiously, the child crept up to the sword and wrapped his small hands around the handle.</p>
      <p>And, slowly, Arthur drew the sword the stone.</p>

      <p>A young man was bent over his desk, charcoal staining his hand black as he sketched. Green eyes shone brightly as his hand flew across the parchment, making elegant arcs and nearly perfect lines. Strands of black hair fell in his eyes as the man held his drawing up to the candle flame.</p>
      <p>"Soon," he promised himself while staring at the self-designed flying machine. "Soon, I will fly."</p>

      <p>An elderly man gripped his wife's hand as they watched the amusing play in front of them. He smiled gently at her, the crow's feet near his eyes crinkling playfully. It was Good Friday, the war was ending, and he was with his wonderful wife. What could ruin this night?</p>
      <p>Behind him was the soft click of a gun.</p>

      <p>Deep in the Forbidden Forest, a killing curse was cast and Harry Potter remembered everything.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Well,...this was fun. If you didn't realize, some of Lucifer's reincarnations are King Arthur, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Abraham Lincoln. If you have any other ideas, put them in a review.</strong>
