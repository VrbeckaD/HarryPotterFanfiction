    <p>The tension in the air was so thick Draco could taste it on his tongue. Each breath he inhaled filled his nostrils with the smell of sweat and fear. The courtroom was filled to the brim, it seemed as though the entire wizarding world wanted to watch the Malfoys get their sentence, get imprisoned in Azkaban. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Draco knew his father still had connections and still held leverage over the ministry of magic, and that crowd would be disappointed after the trial ended with nothing but a light slap on the wrist. The crowd was beginning to murmur as the charges were read and witnesses brought up. Draco watched with a sense of detachment as wizard after wizard, witch after witch, talked about how awful his family was. And then Harry Potter was called to the witness box. </p>
<p>The murmurings grew louder as the Chosen One took his stand. More cameras were flicking, taking picture after picture. Draco watched as Potter swore in and began testifying. Potter looked tired, shoulder’s a little hunched over, dark bags over his eyes. Draco was certain Potter was definitely having nightmares or why else would he looks so sleep deprived? Unbidden, the events in the Room of Requirement flashed into his mind, reaching out to Potter, the flames burning brightly around him. He remembered the heat, suffocating him, making his lungs burn, eyes water, mouth dry. The courtroom was actually quite similar. </p>
<p>Potter suddenly turned to look at him and Draco was suddenly aware that the prosecutors had asked Potter a question about Draco’s involvement in Dumbledore’s death. Potter’s piercing green eyes looked bright and alert, completely contrasting from the dark circles under his eyes, and Draco could almost detect a hint of concern within Potter’s eyes. Concern and mild fear. <i>Sectumsempra.</i> The word popped into Draco’s mind without warning and he could see it now, clear as if it happened yesterday. The hatred in Potter’s eyes, the wave of his wand, the shock at seeing his insides open and the blood pouring out, pouring and pouring endlessly out of his chest. The last thing Draco remembered seeing before passing out was those green eyes laced with horror, shock, fear, and concern. </p>
<p>Draco was aware that Potter’s mouth was moving, but for some reason he couldn’t focus on what he was saying. But it was definitely something controversial because the spectating wizards and witches suddenly started yelling their protests, outraged. His mother reached over discreetly and squeezed his hand. Draco realized that his composure had fallen and quickly schooled his face back to a neutral, haughty expression worthy of a spoiled pureblood. He looked back at Potter and noticed a slight frown in his expression. A witch screeched in protest, yelling over all the other spectators. “MURDERER! MURDERER!” </p>
<p>“Silence. Silence.” A stern wizengamot wizard stared down his glasses at the courtroom, pounding his gavel against the table. His father stood even straighter than usual, head held high, but his hands were fisted, knuckles paper white. His mother’s eyes were pointed straight forward, narrow shoulders filled with tension. She was rubbing a bracelet on her arm, the one Draco had given her for her birthday before he went off to Hogwarts. His father had brought him to the shops and allowed Draco to personally pick it out. His mother had worn it ever since. </p>
<p>Draco desperately held onto his composure and tried not to flinch as the gavel continued sending small vibrations. He still remembered the day he was supposed to kill Dumbledore. The look the old wizard had given him, full of understanding and acceptance, as if he was daring Draco to just do it. As if he knew Draco was too cowardly, too weak to actually go through with it. He remembered shaking so much, gripping his wand so tightly he almost snapped it. But he couldn’t do it. <i>Avada Kedavra.</i> He could picture the empty faces of the muggles, wizards, and squibs staring lifelessly at nothing in the Manor. </p>
<p>Draco felt a shudder go through him and he forced himself to snap out of it. <i>Quidditch, warm towels, the smell of chamomile tea, sunshine.</i> The words his mother used to say to him when he was little and had a bad nightmare stopped working after Voldemort had moved into the Manor. But Draco still clung on to the familiarity of it. He wanted to go back, to a time when the worst thing that happened was when he fell off his broom and broke his arm. It had terrified him and took him almost a month to be able to even touch a broom again. His father had been irritated by his lack of resilience and cowardice, but his mother soothed him and read him stories about brilliant Quidditch players until little Draco had felt well enough to brave the brooms again. His father had sneered when Draco asked him to play Quidditch with him and promptly sent him away. He was 5.</p>
<p>Draco knew his parents wouldn’t approve if he closed his eyes during the trial because any image that didn’t look good for them would be plastered all over the papers. Still, Draco couldn’t resist closing his eyes for just a second, wishing he could go back to the past.</p>
