    <p>The pounding began exactly at 10:48 on a Tuesday morning. He didn’t open the door immediately, but he did glance up at the clock. The potion was at a critical stage, however, and he continued to add the lacewings one at a time, his fingers hovering over the cauldron and his head bent to inspect the results. Create in order to deconstruct; it was a method he favored and used frequently.</p>
<p>At 10:52, when the potion was beginning to catalyze, the pounding intensified. He scattered the last of the lacewings across the surface of the brew and stirred twice, counterclockwise, and then once in the opposite direction. Only then did he turn and remove the wards on the door, opening it with a flick of his wand. He saw a flash of black and green as it swung open, and he turned back to his workbench, wiping his palms on a flannel. “Bloody hell Potter, what do you want now?”</p>
<p>“Severus,” the boy choked, and he spun back. If Potter wasn’t calling him Snape, something was wrong – aside from the terror and fear and frustration in his voice. His pupils had contracted to show dark flecks amid the green, and there were blue circles under his eyes. “Haven’t you heard?”</p>
<p>He raised an eyebrow. “Heard what?”</p>
<p>A hand came up, raking through the hair, and it broke the illusion. Sometimes Harry looked so much like Lily that he could almost forget that he was Potter senior’s son as well, but the messy hair and the hand raking and the way his shoulders straightened were pure James. It was a balancing act; if he stopped seeing Lily, he detested the boy almost as much as the sire. If he started seeing her too much, he began to feel as if he and Potter had become chums, and that was revolting. He preferred to perch somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>“Hermione. She’s been…” Potter took a deep breath, and he felt a flash of something between anger and panic. Anger that somehow they’d gotten themselves into another mess, and panic that perhaps eventually their luck would run out. Might already have run out. Damn Granger… “She’s been arrested.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” He was sure he hadn’t heard correctly. He thought Potter said arrested, but they were talking of Granger just a moment before, and surely the Deputy Head of Magical Creatures – Shacklebolt’s little ingénue – wouldn’t have done anything criminal. She was swotty and stroppy and brash, but she wasn’t a lawbreaker. And then he remembered the tail, and the Centaurs, and a hundred other things she’d done in flagrant violation of the rules and in the name of expediency.</p>
<p>“She’s being held – we extradited her by Portkey this morning.”</p>
<p>She’d been overseas? He hadn’t noticed – but then he rarely left his lab except to attend staff meetings, and she only rarely came down to visit him, always in Potter’s wake. He waved his hand. “A technicality, no doubt. What is the alleged crime?”</p>
<p>Potter sighed loudly, walked across the room, and flopped onto the stool next to the shelves. “Memory charms. She was in Australia, and they’re…it’s serious. Kingsley had to guarantee charges would be filed before they would agree to release her into our custody and I’m...they won’t let me see her.”</p>
<p>He nodded, sifting through the tidbits of information he had. Memory charms – that could be anything. Australia – Australia. “She was visiting her parents?”</p>
<p>“Sort of,” Potter replied, burying his head in the wide sleeves of his Auror’s robes. “Yes, it’s just…they still don’t know they’re her parents. She was trying to restore their memories and I think something must have gone wrong.”</p>
<p>That made no sense. “What do you mean? I was under the impression that she goes to see them rather frequently.”</p>
<p>A nod, head still buried. Potter looked as if all the fight had gone out of him, and it wasn’t a thing he was used to seeing. “She’s always gone to have her teeth cleaned. This year, she decided to try and fix it.”</p>
<p>“Fix what, exactly?”</p>
<p>“They didn’t immigrate. Hermione sent them there. But she…” Potter had trailed off, some kind of thousand yard stare taking over his features.</p>
<p>“Get on with it!” He’d taken two steps forward and splayed his hands on the bench, bending over Potter.</p>
<p>“She erased all their memories. Completely.”</p>
<p>“Yesterday?” If it were caught early, an accident of that magnitude, it could probably be corrected. And he was pleased that Potter had turned to him, because it showed a great deal of well-justified faith in his expertise. He wondered if the parents had been transferred to St. Mungo’s yet.</p>
<p>Potter shook his head and then raised it. “Seven years ago.”</p>
<p>Bloody hell. And she’d tried to reverse it after that much time…was she mad? “Why – why on <em>earth</em> – would she have done that?”</p>
<p>Potters eyes slid away as if there was something he was trying to hide. Another shake. “You’ll have to ask her.”</p>
<p>Seven years – even he couldn’t help. There was nothing that could be done for the girl or her parents. Severus turned back to his potion, stirring it quickly. “Rather difficult when she’s in a holding cell.”</p>
<p>“Right. Right. That’s why…Ineedyoutogetherout.”</p>
<p>“Stop mumbling, Potter.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I – I need you to get her out."</p>
<p>He snorted; it was something between a laugh and an exclamation of disbelief. “Ludicrous. If you can’t get her out, I certainly can’t.”</p>
<p>Potter tapped his fingers on the table. “You’re a member of MLE, you’re not close enough for it be considered a conflict of interest, and you’re powerful enough to take her on and win. Kingsley just said you’re the only person he’ll consider releasing her to.”</p>
<p>Severus stared at him, the stir rod going slack in his hands as he tilted his head and considered Potter’s plea. It was dangerous – it would likely be disastrous. They’d be like gasoline and fire, he and Granger.</p>
<p>Potter extended a hand, clenching it as if he wanted to grasp hold of his sleeve and beg. He took a step back so that physical contact wouldn’t be possible and stared down his nose.</p>
<p>“Please? Please help her. She won’t even see me.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “I can’t.”</p>
<p>“You mean you won’t.”</p>
<p>“That too.”</p>
<p>Potter looked down at the table, breathing deeply, trying to get a rein on his emotions. Severus was glad to see it; time was the boy probably would’ve tried to force him at wand point down to the cells to retrieve the errant girl. The man drew himself up in the stool and looked him square in the face. “I won’t turn my back on my best friend and I need your help.”</p>
<p>Potter was as manipulative as the dotty old pouf had been, and as shamelessly blunt about it. There was no attempt to soften the appeal, no attempt to seduce him into agreement, just the double-edged blade of guilt and duty sunk deep beneath his shoulders. He twisted as if the pin were more than metaphorical; he ought to let the girl rot, just to spite them all. He drew the rod from the cauldron, cast a stasis spell, and shrugged on his robe. “I assume the Minister will agree to see me?”</p>
<p>Potter smiled and mussed his hair again, nodding. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Bugger off. And do something about your hair. You look ridiculous.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>\|/</p>
<p>Sometimes the guilt was more than she could bear. She had sent them away, robbed them of their identities and their memories and their dreams. She had done it keep them safe – except when had she started to see herself as the adult and them as the children to be protected and coddled? No matter her justifications – they were alive, after all, in the physical sense – for the act itself, the sheer hubris of it all frightened her. She had betrayed them. She had lied to them, and in some sense murdered them.</p>
<p>But all for the greater good.</p>
<p>She’d been willing to fight and die for something she believed in, but she hadn’t admitted their right to make the same decision. She had treated them as children, too ignorant to know what was really good for them as it related to the magical world. But she hadn’t tried to teach them; she’d taken their lack of understanding as a rejection, and pushed them away. Until one day she’d cut the cord completely and sent them away.</p>
<p>Her family. Her parents. And they were lost to her now, completely, and her crimes had finally caught up with her.</p>
<p>She had been trying to fix her mistakes, to make amends, and instead she had only compounded the severity of the betrayal. In the law’s eyes – which did not recognize Wendell and Monica Wilkins as being kith and kin to Hermione Granger – she had broken the Statute of Secrecy, stupefied her Muggle dentists, and attempted to perform an unforgiveable on them once they were incapacitated. She’d known she was breaking the law the moment she’d lifted her wand – she just hadn’t expected to be caught. There was nothing in her visa that said they were monitoring the spells she cast.</p>
<p>Kingsley had been to see her, disappointment etched on his features. He’d spoken to her gently as he’d laid out the charges against her, and her rights under the law, and her suspension from her job while she awaited trial. He’d been very kind when he told her frankly that her reputation might be enough to spare her Azkaban, but that her career wouldn’t survive the scandal. She’d wanted to cry, not because her dreams had shattered beneath her but because she had let them all down. They believed in her, and she’d proven their faith misplaced.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to see Harry, had refused when Kingsley asked. Harry would justify her crimes, exonerate her immediately in his own mind and promise that it would all be worked out soon, and the worst part was that he’d really believe it. She didn’t want to explain to Harry that sometimes intentions didn’t matter and mistakes couldn’t be swept under the rug.</p>
<p>“We’ll see if we can find you someone to stay with. I’m afraid Harry and the Weasleys are out of the question.”</p>
<p>That’s what Kingsley had said. She hoped he wouldn’t find anyone to take her; she’d rather remain in the cell than go home with a stranger, her magic bound and her wand surrendered.</p>
<p>Yet she knew even now that she was fortunate. Another witch wouldn’t have been extradited immediately and visited by the Minister of Magic. Another witch wouldn’t be ensconced in a cell that had been transfigured into a study, with bookshelves lining the walls and a chaise where she could sleep or read or think or cry.</p>
<p>Her eyes swam with tears so constantly that she knew there would be no reading tonight. She wouldn’t be able to see the words on the page.</p>
<p>She was breaking, breaking. She had tried so hard to do what was right, what was just, what was good, but she had failed.</p>
<p>She heard footsteps at the door, and she swiped her sleeve quickly across her eyes, pushing herself into a sitting position just as it opened.</p>
<p>She blinked, sure that she was staring at an apparition, an illusion, a mirage.</p>
<p>Snape was standing in the doorway, her handbag held awkwardly in a tight grip.</p>
<p>She didn’t have to say a word, because he knew. She could see it in his eyes, which were gentle and kind as they flickered around the room. His lip curled up in distaste. “I see Shacklebolt attempted to make you comfortable.”</p>
<p>She shrugged, and then the weight settled back over her and she felt the tears begin to prick her eyes. She swallowed and turned her face away from him, knowing that she hid nothing and that the gesture revealed her shame.</p>
<p>But he understood that too. With a flick of his wand, he let down the Apparition wards, and his footsteps were slow and even as he approached her. He said not a word as he wound her arm around his and then she felt the pull and the crack and they were standing in the hallway of what she supposed was Spinner’s End. It was a crowded space so small that she clung to him not so much for support as out of necessity. With another flick he opened a door and pushed her into a bedroom. It was neat and tidy, if small, and the single bed looked comfortable.</p>
<p>She wanted to sleep as much as anything.</p>
<p>He left her there, standing in the middle of the room staring longingly at the bed. And then suddenly he was there again with a vial of Dreamless Sleep and a cup of tea, and she accepted both with a gratitude that was profound and silent.</p>
<p>He seemed to understand everything. His hands were gentle as they pushed her toward the bed, and she didn’t hear him leave or close the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>\|/</p>
<p>He rubbed his hand over his face and sighed again, and then returned to scratching the cat behind its ears. The claws sank and retracted, sank and retracted, and on some level he enjoyed the pain he endured while the beast showed its pleasure. He didn’t have a clue what to do with the girl upstairs, the bushy-headed goldilocks in his bed.</p>
<p>But he knew what it was to fall to your knees in remorse over your mistakes, and he knew enough about being broken to know that she’d been shattered. Her sanctimonious superiority was gone, her pride in tatters.</p>
<p>He tried to do the opposite of what Dumbledore had done for him, and so far it seemed to be holding up well as a strategy.</p>
<p>He’d promised Shacklebolt no more than a week. He would keep the girl for a week, and attempt to steady her enough to see that she was upright. A week was enough time to find a suitable solution, at least for the duration of the trial. He had only been held for a week the first time around, but it had been the worst week of his life. The second he’d still been sequestered at St. Mungo’s, not yet even fully capable of understanding that elsewhere his trial proceeded without him.</p>
<p>It was, he thought, going to be a very long week. They were effectively trapped; he’d been told to work from home, do what research he could in his personal lab. He’d been cautioned to set enchantments on his house, to secure it so that she couldn’t escape. It was just as surely a prison as the holding cell at the Ministry, or a tower room in Azkaban.</p>
<p>No prison could be worse than the one she was building herself. Sometimes Dementors weren’t necessary at all, and a person could create a hell in their own mind. He knew well enough that he’d never seen Hermione Granger break until tonight. If she’d been defiant, if she’d made excuses, he would have turned on his heel and left her in that cell, Potter and Shacklebolt be damned. But she hadn’t; she’d clung to him as if he could save her from drowning, as he’d once clung to Albus.</p>
<p>Regrets and recriminations were worthless. Guilt was a bitter pill and a harsh yoke.</p>
<p>He knew.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>\|/</p>
<p>It was the bright light that woke her and she blinked quickly, burrowing deeper into the down cover and the soft sheets and pulling a pillow over her head. Her mouth was dry and her eyes itched, and she felt drained and boneless.</p>
<p>The pillow jerked from under her face with a harsh snap, and it thudded against the wall and slid to the floor. “Get up, Miss Granger. It’s past ten.”</p>
<p>She blinked again as the dark shape above her coalesced into a familiar visage. He was scowling down at her, his lips thin and his brow slanted down across his forehead, exposing the deep line between his eyes. “Snape, what -?”</p>
<p>She stopped immediately as the day before came back to her. An experiment gone wrong; the Australian Aurors arriving in the clinic moments after she’d cast the spell, before she could even begin to sort through their minds. The cuff around her wrist, the cell, the Portkey. Another cell. A conversation with Kingsley.</p>
<p>She groaned. “Sorry.”</p>
<p>“You should be. The eggs are cold and the coffee’s turned to sludge, but I saved you a bit of both. You have fifteen minutes to shower and meet me in the kitchen.” He tossed a trunk onto the floor by the bed and waved his wand to enlarge it. “Mrs. Potter delivered some of your personal effects. You’d best hope she selected well.”</p>
<p>She felt a rush of helpless yearning and frustration, and the tears pricked her eyes again. She wasn’t sure how she had any moisture left; she felt as dry and brittle as old parchment. “Ginny was here?”</p>
<p>“You’re not permitted to see her. It seems I’m to be your sole companion for the immediate future.”</p>
<p>She nodded. In any other circumstances, she would have regarded the prospect of being trapped in Snape’s house at his mercy with horror, but somehow the thought that no one else would see her like this was comforting.</p>
<p>“Why are you helping me, sir?” He didn’t seem to like her – he never had. But then he didn’t seem to like anyone, really, even the people who formed his immediate circle. Certainly he never seemed to do anything but snipe at Harry and Kingsley and even Minerva, although the fact that he tolerated their company was something of an admission, just as the fact that he was tolerating hers spoke more loudly than his words.</p>
<p>He scowled, his long fingers clenching around his forearms as he brought his arms to rest across his chest. “If you’re as clever as I’m told, you’ll work it out for yourself. Fifteen minutes.”</p>
<p>And then he was gone. She showered mechanically, wincing as she squirted a bit of astringent shampoo – which smelled like tea tree oil and something chemical – into her palm. She thought about drying herself – with a start she realized that she couldn’t use her wand and reached for one of the flannels folded on the shelf above the sink – and seeing if Ginny had packed her toiletries, but in another moment of reflection she realized that she wasn’t going to see anyone but Snape and it hardly mattered if his harsh shampoo turned her into a walking shrub. She worked it into her hair, finished her shower, and dried herself off, padding back through the bedroom to her trunk. She put on the first clothes she found, a ratty vest and a pair of jeans, and slipped her feet into a pair of ballet flats. She rubbed her hair half-dry, hung the flannel on the rack in the bathroom, and headed for the kitchen.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a large house, just a terrace with two up and two down and a basement that was only possible with the aid of magic. There was a door in the bathroom that led to the other bedroom – his bedroom – and the hallway was just a small landing with scarcely enough space for a single person to loiter. The stairs were steep and wood and they creaked as she walked down them to the sitting area.</p>
<p>She hadn’t been in his home for six years, since he’d been comatose in the Magical Creatures ward at St. Mungo’s and Harry had been sent to fetch his notes on antivenin. Then, the sitting room had been dark and cluttered and uncomfortable, the chairs rigid and unyielding and the wallpaper faded and peeling. The books and the clutter were still present, but at some point he’d whitewashed the walls and replaced the rickety chairs with a couple of monstrous zero-gravity contraptions upholstered in tan leather. There was a music system in the corner, but no telly, and there were piles of books and papers everywhere.</p>
<p>Even Harry had never been invited to Spinner’s End, and Snape had only darkened the door of Grimmauld Place once since the end of the war. Her curiosity was stronger than her grief and exhaustion, and she took a few moments to study the room. It was, all in all, a simple and inviting space, and certainly more to her taste than the overdone monstrosity Kingsley had created in her cell yesterday.</p>
<p>Snape was in the kitchen, sitting at a small table and reading a copy of the Prophet, sipping a cup of coffee. There was an empty place setting at the table, a full mug and a plate of eggs and bacon. She sat down and took a long sip of the coffee, and then picked up a strip of bacon and pushed the eggs around the plate with the crispy end. “Did it make the paper yet?”</p>
<p>He lowered the newspaper and studied her, his lips pursing. “No. Don’t play with your food, Granger. Eat.” And then he hid his face again to read.</p>
<p>She picked up the fork and scooped up a bit of the eggs, depositing them on her tongue. They tasted like ash, and she followed them with bitter coffee and cold bacon. The silence was broken only by the white noise of her cutlery scraping against the pottery, the sounds of her chewing, and his grunts and page turning. After she’d eaten a few slow bites, she set down the fork and looked up at him.</p>
<p>“Will they offer me a plea?”</p>
<p>“I suppose.”</p>
<p>“What do you think it will be?”</p>
<p>He flung the paper onto the table’s surface and glared at her. “How should I know?”</p>
<p>Dammit. She was crying again. “I just thought – you’re very clever, sir.”</p>
<p>His face softened a bit, and he leaned forward. “Does it matter what they offer you? Whatever it is, it will be both too much and not enough in your eyes. You will receive neither true mercy nor justice.”</p>
<p>She heard the truth in his words as soon as he spoke them. She looked around the small kitchen. It was neat and well-kept, the linoleum polished and the countertops scrubbed. She looked at the man across from her, who sat straight in his white linen shirt and his black jeans, his hair – lightened by a few streaks of iron-grey – falling limply around his face. She looked at his arm, covered by his shirt, and wondered about the mark the fabric hid.</p>
<p>He was still not a handsome man, nor a genial one. The end of the war had changed neither his aspect nor his essential personality, yet somehow she understood a little better the weight he’d shouldered.</p>
<p>He shrugged suddenly, and pushed his chair back from the table. “Don’t look to them for comfort. What matters is that you find a way to live with yourself.”</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” she asked, desperate to keep him there with her. She didn’t want to be alone, didn’t want to be trapped with nothing but her own thoughts.</p>
<p>“To my lab. My work didn’t end just because I’ve been saddled with you as well.”</p>
<p>“May I help?”</p>
<p>He sighed, and she thought it was just a shade too emphatic to be genuine. “Possibly, if you do as I ask and otherwise stay out of my way.”</p>
<p>She followed him down another set of stairs to his basement laboratory. Parts of it – the benches, the jars of pickled creatures – looked to have been transported directly out of his office at Hogwarts. His desk was shoved in the corner and so piled with papers that she couldn’t see the surface, but she suspected he’d brought that along as well.</p>
<p>It felt like a lifetime ago that she’d sat on one of the hard stools at a potion’s bench, although in reality it had only been five years. But Harry and Ron hadn’t been with her then, and Slughorn had been absent-minded at best. Her N.E.W.T. year had passed in a haze.</p>
<p>She’d broken up and then mended things with Ron four or five times before he’d finally told her that being together felt too much like work. Ginny had been Head Girl. Hermione had been the war heroine, shoved off to the side because she was too old to be a student and too young to be a peer with her professors. That had been a lonely year for her.</p>
<p>It must’ve been a lonely year for him too, stuck at Spinner’s End with only Kreacher to care for him – if one could call the bossy elf’s demands care. But somehow, by the time she’d left Hogwarts to start her job in Magical Creatures, Harry had wormed his way in and claimed that he and Snape were – if not friends – then at least allies and colleagues. Ron wanted no part of it, but Harry and Neville were frequent visitors to his lab in the M.L.E. division, and even Luna and Ginny had been known to drop in for lunch on occasion. Hermione had rarely been invited to join them, and she’d tried not to resent the exclusion.</p>
<p>He was preparing a cauldron, his efficient hands performing the tasks by rote as he muttered notes to a dictoquill. She watched him with a mixture of awe and gratitude as he chopped ingredients and formed them into little piles, his wand dancing in his left hand to summon jars and replace them as his right held the knife with a practiced grace. He smirked slightly as he chopped a flobberworm diagonally, the blade tapping a staccato rhythm as it quartered the wiggling creature.</p>
<p>“You enjoy this,” she breathed, and she heard his knife clatter to a stop. He didn’t turn to face her, but speared another worm with the tip and repeated his quick dissection. She clarified. “Your work.”</p>
<p>He glanced up at her from under his lashes, set down his knife and his wand, and dragged a stool to the opposite side of the bench she was sitting at. He leaned back against it and folded his arms across his chest. “I should hope so.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t unhappy, she realized suddenly. Not anymore. His eyes were warmer and the planes of his face were softer. He looked healthier, and while he was still thin his cheekbones and jaw didn’t jut out at such harsh angles.</p>
<p>“How do you move past it?”</p>
<p>“You don’t,” he answered evenly, and she was grateful for his honesty. “You accept that there is never perfect justice in this world, and you do your best to make amends for your crimes.”</p>
<p>She nodded, and she felt the need to tell him, to make him understand. To hear his perspective, which suddenly seemed to be the only one that mattered. “It was something Tonks said. She told me if the Ministry fell they’d be at risk – that I had to tell my parents what was happening. She offered to come with me – they’d hid her dad’s parents in Ireland, and she had…experience, I guess. But I’d lied to them for so long, telling them that everything was fine and things at school were lovely and no, they didn’t need to come with me to pick up my school supplies or to see me off at the platform…I didn’t know how to tell them that there was a war going on and that I was right in the middle of it and I’d hid it from them. They were so reluctant to let me go in the first place. They didn’t understand why I couldn’t have tutors in magic and sit my A-levels. They wanted me to do both, and I knew that…what sort of parent would let their teenage daughter fight a war they couldn’t comprehend against an ideology they couldn’t understand? I couldn’t tell them, so I…I thought I was protecting them. I altered their memories, their documents, their bank accounts. I sent them to Australia and I told myself I was saving their lives.”</p>
<p>He sighed and ran a hand over his face when she trailed off, shaking his head slightly. “Dora was right. Yaxley paid a visit to your home immediately once the Ministry fell. You shouldn’t have lied to them, but you already know that.”</p>
<p>“I just thought I could fix –“</p>
<p>“Stop. You wanted them back. You wanted their forgiveness and their absolution, but did you ever once think of what that would cost them?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You suppose that they would be better off knowing they had a daughter who respected them that little and an entire life they’d been denied for the better part of a decade?”</p>
<p>His words were harsh, but his voice was soft and strangely gentle. She leaned toward him, and then rested her chin on her hands. “I didn’t…I didn’t think, I suppose. I missed them terribly, and I thought that…they’d miss me too, if they knew. But they don’t.”</p>
<p>He rose from the stool, returned to his work. “Withholding information, treating people as if they can’t be trusted to draw their own conclusions. Dumbledore did the same. Rules and laws never applied to him so long as he believed in the purity of his own intentions.”</p>
<p>“Did you hate him for it?” She realized how impertinent the question sounded as soon as it left her lips, and she ducked her head to hide her eyes, waiting for a snappish response and a set-down.</p>
<p>“Sometimes. Never so much as I hated myself for looking to him for absolution that wasn’t his to grant.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” she said suddenly, unsure where the impulse had come from. She saw his lips curl up in a smile as he dropped the worms into the base and adjusted the heat on his cauldron, and she thought that he might be mocking her but she didn’t care.</p>
<p>“For what?” he asked blandly.</p>
<p>“For ever –“ she began, and she realized how weak the apology was as soon as she started to articulate it. “For lying to you. For setting you on fire, for knocking you out, for sneaking around and all the stupid things we did. For disrespecting you.”</p>
<p>“Apology accepted.”</p>
<p>She smiled despite herself. “So it’s that simple, is it? I apologize and I’m forgiven.”</p>
<p>“It’s rarely that simple, but I am hardly in a position to be unforgiving.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough.” She studied the wood of the table, digging the side of her thumb into a gash on the surface. “Are you going to apologize to me?”</p>
<p>She thought he snickered, but his head was bent so low over the cauldron she couldn’t be sure. He raised it then and looked at her, his lips quirking. “For what? My teaching methods?”</p>
<p>“For being cruel,” she huffed. Was he totally oblivious?</p>
<p>“I don’t apologize for being what I am,” he answered. “Only the wrongs I’ve done.”</p>
<p>“But you called me an insufferable know-it-all, and a fool, and…” she stopped. Much quieter, she finished, “Nothing I didn’t deserve.”</p>
<p>He nodded. “I was ill-suited to being a teacher. Albus encouraged your disrespect and your paranoia and your arrogance. You were taught to think yourself above the rules, and I was forced to endure the results of it. None of us were entirely to blame.”</p>
<p>“We were at war, Severus.” She said his name without thinking, and she froze at the same moment he did. His shoulders tensed, and then relaxed just as quickly. She held her breath.</p>
<p>“There’s no such thing as a just war.”</p>
<p>“So we shouldn’t have fought, is that what you’re saying?”</p>
<p>He pushed himself back and turned, striding to her table in three long steps and leaning over so that his face was uncomfortably close. His eyes narrowed and she could see the lines around them deepen. “I’m saying that you do your best to do the thing in front of you with the least amount of damage, and that’s all you can do. Because if you start believing that you know what justice means, and it’s your duty to dispense it, you’ve already failed.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I’m a horrible person?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why you’re doing this.”</p>
<p>He stopped glowering, and his jaw relaxed. She felt his stare graze over her face, and she fixed her eyes on his forehead and submitted to his scrutiny. And then he tilted his head, and she felt exposed, as if all of her pain was reflected in his own face and all of her shame was laid bare. “We are all just beggars at the feast.”</p>
<p>She felt the tears coming again, and she swiped at them with the back of her sleeve. “Why did you choose to serve him?”</p>
<p>“Because he wasn’t a hypocrite,” he answered steadily, misconstruing the question.</p>
<p>“I meant Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>He rocked back, and he seemed disinclined to answer as he retreated from her personal space. The intensity drained from him, and she saw something that looked like regret flicker over his features, but then he straightened and his voice was level when he replied, “I was too much a coward to confess what I’d done to Lily, so I begged someone else to right it. I trusted him to save her, but he was as much a coward and fool as the rest of us.”</p>
<p>She wasn’t sure she wanted to accept it. It seemed like he lived in a world without good and evil, in some sort of relativistic grey area where all were equally mean and stupid and incompetent, but she knew that she was willfully misunderstanding him. He did believe in things like honor and justice and courage or he wouldn’t have acted as he did. And yet he seemed reluctant to admit it, almost as if admitting it was a danger.</p>
<p>“I’ve ruined my life,” she said bluntly, as he turned back to his cauldron yet again.</p>
<p>“You’ve besmirched your reputation and probably ended your career. Your life is hardly over – Kingsley will sacrifice his own position before he’ll allow you to be kissed. Given the extenuating circumstances, I doubt you’ll even be sent to Azkaban.”</p>
<p>She didn’t correct him, she didn’t inform him that what she’d meant was she’d ruined her career and that was the same as saying she’d ruined her life. Somehow she thought it wouldn’t come out the way she meant it, or possibly that it was stupid in the first place.</p>
<p>“You’ll find, much to your chagrin perhaps, that life goes on.”</p>
<p>“Were you sorry that you lived?”</p>
<p>“The first time, yes. The second I was just sorry that others did not.” He tapped his stirring rod on the side of the cauldron and then set it on the table. “Come – this needs an hour or so to thicken.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” She asked, following after him dutifully as he mounted the stairs. He ignored her question and headed for the kitchen, taking down an electric teapot, a canister of Earl Grey, and a box of chocolate biscuits. He slid the box across the counter toward her and busied himself with the teapot and the faucet. She nibbled at one of the biscuits, watching him. “You don’t use magic to warm your water?”</p>
<p>“I don’t use my wand at all except in the lab,” he answered, and she looked around the kitchen again. It was clean – muggle clean. The way her mother cleaned things, with soaps and rags and polish. It was a different sort of clean, and she wondered why she hadn’t noticed it before. He’d been raised in the Muggle world, as she had.</p>
<p>“Do you ever wish you hadn’t been a wizard?” She asked, and what she meant was – sometimes I wish I wasn’t a witch. It would have been easier that way. She’d have been ignorant of all it; she would never have found herself in the middle of a war, or been pulled away from her family, or betrayed her parents.</p>
<p>“My mistakes would have been different, but I’d still have made them.” He poured the water over the leaves and steeped them. She didn’t know what to say. He poured out a cup and slid it across to her. “Milk or sugar?”</p>
<p>“No thank you.” Why was he being so kind? He’d never been kind to her before; she’d always had the impression that he disliked her, or at the very least didn’t give a shit about her one way or the other. She felt like a burden, one he was shouldering with a surprising amount of grace. Was this really the man who’d snarled and snapped at them all?</p>
<p>“You’ve changed,” she said. “You’re not so angry anymore. What happened?”</p>
<p>“You grew up.”</p>
<p>She had a moment to coddle a winding indignation before he smiled, a full grin which showed his awful teeth but transformed his features utterly. It was a sweet, sensitive smile. It was a smile she remembered seeing on a boy in bottle of memories. And there was nothing to do but smile in return, and it felt so good to smile, to be happy, to forget…</p>
<p>And it broke her heart as soon as she remembered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>\|/</p>
<p>She was a mess. He had been scrupulously careful to allow her to take her ruminations wherever she needed to take them, and he had been patient with her curiosity and her rude questions. It was the mercy of the fallen – he wouldn’t offer her false platitudes, but he wouldn’t wound someone who was so very fragile intentionally.</p>
<p>So he hadn’t mentioned that she had bags under her eyes or that her hair looked as if a hedgehog had been caught in a bramble. He hadn’t mentioned that perhaps she ought to put on something more appropriate than loungewear and do something useful. He’d let her follow him around like a puppy and interrogate him like a lawyer and he found that despite her actions she had a mature perspective on her situation and a decent enough grasp of ethics.</p>
<p>She’d grown up. He’d felt a similar acknowledgement when Longbottom had faced him without fear, when Potter had apologized for assaulting Draco, when Draco had shown up and asked what he needed to do to make amends. It was the mercy of the fallen, the sole province of those who had floundered and failed and hadn’t run from their failures but faced them and fought them down.</p>
<p>Humility was the one thing Granger had obviously lacked. He wished, for her sake, that it hadn’t come to this, but there was a new wisdom in her eyes, and it forced him to accord her the same amount of respect he would any other of his peers. She was clever and creative and courageous and she never turned her back on anyone. She was sympathetic and determined and not afraid to speak her mind, and those were all good qualities. Only her insufferable pride, her absolute faith in her own conclusions and perceptions, the certainty of her moral superiority had made her intolerable.</p>
<p>She was tolerable now, he supposed. He wasn’t finding this as excruciating as he’d anticipated when Potter had been pleading for his help. Entertaining her was only mildly unpleasant.</p>
<p>Until he smiled at her.</p>
<p>At first she smiled back, and she looked younger, more like the Miss Granger he remembered. She was not – had never been – a really pretty girl if you just took her features into account. She had been attractive, though, because she was clever and witty and animated. He was glad to have elicited a smile. It suited her better than brittle stoicism.</p>
<p>And then suddenly her face crumpled in, and there were tears running down her cheeks. She didn’t cry aloud, or sniffle, or whimper. She just stood there and reached out for him blindly, her hand groping over the counter.</p>
<p>He did the opposite of what Albus would have done. He put his arm around her shoulder and guided her into the sitting room. He hooked his foot under one of the ottomans, sliding it against the other to form a sort of bench, and pulled her down beside him. She leaned on his shoulder and her tears were soaking his shirt.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what to say – perhaps there was nothing to say, after all. She was asleep in minutes, and he laid her in one of the chairs and pulled a blanket over her before heading back to his laboratory. A bit of rest wouldn’t do her any harm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>\|/</p>
<p>When she woke again it was dark, and it took her a moment to realize where she was and a few more for her eyes to adjust. She was in one of the leather chairs, and there was a thick wool blanket wrapped around her. It smelled like him, she realized. It smelled like the bed upstairs. A cat was curled on her lap; it woke at the same time she did and stretched its legs, jumping from the chair and startling her a bit.</p>
<p>She listened for a moment, hearing the faint sound of music from the basement. He was still down there. She climbed out of the chair and reached for the lamp, fumbling around until she found the switch. She headed upstairs to the bedroom, and paused at her trunk to remove a jumper. She looked around at the rather spare room, then crossed to the closet and opened the door. His clothing hung neatly inside it, and his shoes were precisely arranged on the floor.</p>
<p>She stepped back into the hallway, staring at the door to the second bedroom. It was slightly ajar, and it would be easy to push the door open. The light in the hallway would illuminate the room well enough to see inside it.</p>
<p>But she wouldn’t impinge on his hospitality by disregarding his privacy. She turned off the light and headed for the basement. She found him hovering over a set of cauldrons with his sleeves rolled up and his hair tied back. A CD player sat on the counter; he was listening to Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p>Her mother liked Leonard Cohen too. She tried to push that memory away and concentrate on the man in front of her. He turned a bit to acknowledge her presence, but he was intent on the interplay between the two cauldrons, and he held up a finger to forestall her. She wandered over to the stool and sat on it, propping her elbows on the table. Three songs finished before he grunted, cast a stasis on the potions, and turned to look at her.</p>
<p>“Was it successful? Your experiment.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What is it you do exactly?” she asked, putting off the discussion she’d come down here to have with him. And really, his job wasn’t very well defined and she had wondered at times.</p>
<p>“Forensics,” he answered. “Analyzing and re-creating potions so that we can devise antidotes or approve them for market.”</p>
<p>“That sounds interesting.” And far beyond her abilities. She’d wanted him to acknowledge her as a prodigy because she could follow instructions flawlessly. But she wasn’t truly gifted. Not in the same way he was.</p>
<p>“It’s fascinating. I’m paid to experiment.”</p>
<p>“I slept in your bed last night,” she blurted. “I only just realized – “</p>
<p>He turned away from her, cleaning his stir rods with a flannel and tidying up the discarded ingredients. “Would you have preferred one of the chairs?”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point. I don’t understand why you’re doing this for me.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you?” He seemed genuinely surprised. “Potter asked me to, as did Shacklebolt.”</p>
<p>“But why you? And why did you agree?”</p>
<p>“For one thing, because the Prophet will probably report that you were released into my custody.”</p>
<p>She nodded, puzzled.</p>
<p>“If you read that, would you think it sounded like a pleasant holiday?”</p>
<p>She smiled crookedly. “I suppose everyone will think that I’m locked in your basement and that you’re insulting me ad nauseam whilst I’m forced to clean cauldrons by hand.”</p>
<p>“Not everyone, but the vast majority,” he answered, quirking an eyebrow as if daring her to prove him wrong.</p>
<p>“You really don’t care what they think, do you?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how to thank you.”</p>
<p>“You could start by making dinner while I tidy up. You were asleep, and I didn’t have time to stop for lunch.”</p>
<p>She flushed. “I would, but –“</p>
<p>“But what?” He almost looked eager to hear her answer, as if he was waiting for an opportunity to mock her about something relatively harmless. She supposed he probably was; he’d been earnest and kind for a rather long time without cracking, and the effort must have worn him.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how to cook without a wand.”</p>
<p>He quirked his head at her. “Good God. Do you mean you never helped your mother in the kitchen?”</p>
<p>Did that mean he had? She knew nothing about his childhood, she realized, aside from Harry’s allusions to abuse and neglect. “She didn’t cook. We survived on toast and take-away.”</p>
<p>“Then I suppose it’s down to me to teach you.” He stacked his paraphernalia on the corner of the table and headed for the stairs, no doubt expecting her to follow.</p>
<p>So she did.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>\|/</p>
<p>She’d followed his instructions carefully and managed to cook them a passable dinner without burning the house down, and he’d even gone so far as to damn her efforts with faint praise. She’d reacted to his decree of ‘not terrible’ as if he’d featured her in the culinary section of the Guardian, and it had required an effort on his part not to laugh at her.</p>
<p>Her need to please was her biggest problem. She looked elsewhere for approbation and it made her vulnerable. Weak. She’d probably wanted to please her parents as well, and look where that had got her.</p>
<p>But overall, things seemed to be going well. She’d had a day of rest, and she’d concluded it by accomplishing something, even something so small as managing to feed them. She hadn’t protested when he’d demanded that she take the bedroom, and she’d done as bid and allowed him to do the washing while she went to bed. She’d even stolen his cat; his lap remained bare throughout the night. He assumed she must’ve needed the company more than he did.</p>
<p>The cat also accomplished waking her at a respectable hour. It padded into the kitchen looking for kibble at the same moment he heard the shower turn on upstairs, and she arrived in the kitchen just as he was taking the coffee off the warmer. She sat down at the table and trailed her arm across the cat’s ribs. It continued to eat, but flicked its tail against her wrist.</p>
<p>“What’s her name,” she asked.</p>
<p>“Pardon?” He poured out two cups of coffee, but he didn’t hand her the second one. Instead, he left it on the counter and walked to the table, snapping his paper open and scanning the headlines. After a moment, he heard her get up to retrieve the coffee.</p>
<p>“Your cat. What’s her name?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have one.”</p>
<p>“You’re joking. How long have you had her?”</p>
<p>“Four years,” he answered. “It was a gift from Professor McGonagall.” Keep her talking – long enough for him to scan the article. Long enough for him to assess the damage.</p>
<p>“It’s a girl, you know. Your cat doesn’t have a name – that’s mad.”</p>
<p>“It’s a cat, Granger. At best, it keeps the mice away, and I could accomplish as much with a spell. It eats, it sleeps, it tracks litter and hair across the house. If it’s any consolation, I’m sure it thinks of me as ‘the human.’ We cohabitate; that is all.” He could practically hear the steam pouring out of her nostrils, although he continued to read. She was distracted, and he was glad of it.</p>
<p>“She deserves to have somebody love her! What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>“I respect the cat, which I daresay it values a great deal more than love. Or would you have me pawn it off on Master Teddy, who would no doubt love it to extinction? I don’t recall any of the real bunnies desiring to have their fur loved off. Daft cow.”</p>
<p>She sputtered, and a few droplets of coffee soaked their way through the paper. “Sorry, did you just allude to the Velveteen Rabbit?”</p>
<p>“It’s vastly superior to Peter Rabbit, at least. I’ve always hoped that Potter would name one of his litter Beatrix, and that our Miss Potter would turn out as dull and insipid as her namesake. Alas, it’s too close to Bellatrix, I suppose, to hold much hope of it.”</p>
<p>She was silent; he hadn’t expected an outright laugh, but he was rather proud of his wit and expected at least a passing acknowledgement. He didn’t lower the paper, though, even though he’d finished the article.</p>
<p>“How bad is it?” She finally asked. Brighter than he’d given her credit for, he supposed.</p>
<p>“Here”, he said, tossing the article down in front of her. “I’ll make us some toast.”</p>
<p>He busied himself with a loaf of pumpernickel and the toaster. He heard the rustle of the paper as she picked it up, but he continued to fiddle at the counter and then went to the fridge for a jar of jam. He took an absurdly long time selecting knives and plates, considering he only owned one incomplete set of dishes and tableware. Finally he heard another rustle as she dropped the paper to the table, and he carried the food over.</p>
<p>“They’re saying I wasn’t in my right mind – that I didn’t know what I was doing. War trauma, Percy said.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he answered, spreading a bit of the jam across his toast. He took a bite of it, chewing it carefully.</p>
<p>“It isn’t true.”</p>
<p>“It may be believable.”</p>
<p>“That isn’t the point. Justice is supposed to be about finding the truth, isn’t it? Not shoving off responsibility and making things up.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t a question of justice. It’s a question of politics.”</p>
<p>She sat for several minutes, scraping her knife across the toast, deep in thought. He didn’t venture to say anything. He guessed that she was trying to tease out the larger plan.</p>
<p>“They aren’t going to let me testify, are they? They’re going to claim I’m indisposed, tell everyone I’m too sick to take the stand. Let me resign and call it medical, ask me to keep a low profile. And then Harry’s going to find me some out of the way job that he’s dreamt up, and I’ll be expected to lead a quiet life.”</p>
<p>“In essentials,” he answered, around bites of his toast.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m here,” she accused. He could hear anger in her voice, but he didn’t look up at her. She felt he’d betrayed her. Fair enough – he supposed he had. “I’m not going to do it, Snape. I have principles – I’m not going to go along with such a bald-faced lie in order to save my own skin. Just how guilty were you?”</p>
<p>Ah. There. Of course. He took a sip of his coffee, finally looked up at her, held her gaze. “As guilty as you are. And then some.”</p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears. “But your intentions…”</p>
<p>“As I said.” He went back to eating his toast.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because they care what happens to you, but they can’t afford to have Albus’s methods questioned. Or haven’t you noticed that the Order of the Phoenix has more power than the riddled bastard ever did?”</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous!”</p>
<p>He set down his knife and leaned across the table. “Kingsley Shacklebolt is what?”</p>
<p>After a moment, she answered. “Minister.”</p>
<p>“Minerva.”</p>
<p>“Headmistress, but – “</p>
<p>“Arthur Weasley.”</p>
<p>“Muggle liaison.”</p>
<p>“Bill Weasley.”</p>
<p>“Gringott’s.”</p>
<p>“Shall I continue?”</p>
<p>She waved her hand, glaring at him. “I won’t lie.”</p>
<p>“They won’t ask you to.” He pushed back his coffee and stretched as he rose. He looked down at her. “It’s your choice, Granger. I’ll take you back today, if you wish it, and you can press for justice to be served. Or you can stay here and make yourself useful while you await mercy to be granted.”</p>
<p>He walked away. He was almost to the basement stairs when he heard her voice from the kitchen. “It isn’t fair.”</p>
<p>He paused, and spoke loud enough to be heard. “Life isn’t.”</p>
<p>And then he closed the door to his laboratory firmly behind him.</p>
