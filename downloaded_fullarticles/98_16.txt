    <p><em>                “The work of an Unspeakable is Unspeakably dull. Either you die through the tedious boredom of research, or the stupidity of your coworkers.”</em> ~ <em>U-15 Orange Sigma</em></p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>                The Unspeakable sidestepped a cloaked figure without losing a step. His own form, shrouded in the all-concealing robes of his station, continued its stalking walk, unhurried movements making its determined way through the crowded hall. Even in <em>his </em>department there existed a lack of time for processing reports. One man in a telephone booth, no matter how enchanted, did not rate more than a few minor notes.</p><p>                Out of the tail of one eye, another cloaked figure shivered, and abruptly vanished.</p><p>                He kept a shiver under control. <em>“Someone’s going to get a good lambasting for that. No Time Turners in public.”</em></p><p>                Still, he obliged common convention and slowed his pace. The actions were mirrored by the majority of cloaked figures in eyeshot. One such figure drew closer, following him as he walked. Agent U-15 folded his arms behind his back, palm upwards.</p><p>                <em>“Please, not me. Not me. Let it be anyone but me,” </em>his thoughts repeated themselves, chanting faster and faster. Precious seconds tiptoed past, stretching into a full minute.</p><p>                The thin sensation of paper, folded over enough times to create a cutting edge, jabbed into the thin skin of his palm. His fingers closed on the material, just the phalanges tightening. Movement of the hands or arms would betray the reception of non-time-standard messaging, which in turn could affect the event considered important enough to necessitate time travel in the first place. Every Chrono-operative in the Temporal Division was trained to understand that seamless lack of reaction, the subtle mastery of body language unconsciously given through the simple fact of being human.</p><p>                Thirty seconds later the Unspeakable U-15 – allowing the luxury of personal names would be a downright lazy thought whilst the robes were still on – brought his hands around once more, the hard bit of parchment sliding into place inside the sleeve under his wrist.</p><p>                A tense brace of minutes ensued, as he made his way to a cubicle reserved for himself and himself alone. No one entered an Unspeakable’s private laboratory without an expert team of Cursebreakers or three. Gringotts protections boasted a lethal reputation, but an Unspeakable team employed viciousness on an entirely different level.</p><p>                <em>‘Not including personalization,’</em> Agent U-15 relaxed as the powerful wards washed over his apparel. His own design came from a muggle device known as an <em>airlock</em>. His version used twin sealed doors that prevented entrance or egress before a thorough evaluation of a potentially hostile environment could be completed. Of course, updating the wards was a constant job; new curses were developed every week, worming their way around the department like the Slashkilter some sarding fool had created, then lost. It had taken weeks of Reversed Time to trace the thing’s progress, and an entire month of trying different baits until someone had the bright idea of checking for mating behavior.</p><p>                The Lovegoods would never let that go, either. Every few issues a reference to the <em>Umgubular</em> <em>Slashkilter</em> would surface, their way of thumbing their teeth at the Department.</p><p>                Satisfied, the wards allowed him entrance.</p><p>                In the safety of his sanctum, Karl Timonssen relaxed. His hood lowered, cloak releasing its fastening charms before drifting to a place on the door-ward wall. Everything was the same, a place where his possessions could remain secure, and the little projects he worked on the side could be monitored in true solitude.</p><p>                Like most employees in the Department of Mysteries, this had started with a basic cubicle. Upon entry to the Time Division, everything had been transferred to a new room, created specifically for him. Every new employee had one; magic allowed a thousand offices each having the potential size of a stadium room, yet existing in a layer as thin as a coat of paint. Each room rested secure within the personalized security created by individual owners – frequent issues in past centuries had barred entry for anyone but the personal master of the miniature realm. Even the Director had to receive permission from the owner before gaining access.</p><p>Idle hands checked a recursive algorithm he’d started some time ago. It was a simple loop experiment, rebounding dust from the Saharan Desert through a tunnel made of pure orichalcum; in a few years, he might be able to evaluate the theory if the Great Sphinx had indeed caused the desert to become a desert, based on the results. All members of his division had experiments going on the side; combined with the security and paranoia meant no one knew when or what was going on a scant <em>thaum</em> away. So far as he knew, there were forgotten experiments going on in his hall that had been started over half a millennium before, monitored by charmed automatons, forgotten or unknown – even if they <em>were </em>known, no one had the solution to stopping them.</p><p>                He glanced at a note on the wall above the splashback, in the potions brewing area. The one reminding him to transfer all security codes to Central Storage, in the event of an Inversion or something worse. The note flashed a brilliant pink, fading to blue, then flashing pink once more.</p><p>                As usual, he tagged it with a wandless muting spell. Division regulations were important, but … respected more than obeyed.</p><p>                Crinkling paper unfolded in his hands. “Let’s see. What do I have here?”</p><p>                The paper folded outwards, actual <em>paper</em> rather than parchment. That meant the message was from himself, to himself. Messages meant for other wizards were on the more magic-friendly parchment.</p><p>                <em>Me,<br/>
                Ignore the Non-Interference Clause tonight. Time Chamber, then Death Chamber. Vee to the Prophecy airheads; fate is what you make of it.</em></p><p>
  <em>                P.S. I hate me.</em>
</p><p>                Karl let the page fall. It disintegrated before reaching the floor. He paid it no mind. The entire situation had changed; that report on the strange man in a telephone booth would have to wait.</p>
