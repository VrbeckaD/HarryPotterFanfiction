  <span>The prefect by the name of Zacharias Smith laughed slightly as Millicent Bulstrode his fellow Slytherin Prefect, mentioned the Weasley twins new invention that they had performed on Vincent Crabbe, one of the most idiotic stereotypical Slytherin’s. It was their last round by now, they hadn’t been doing much really besides walking around and talking. “I hope Draco for once gets the courage to beat Potter, it’s sickening seeing him lose over and over to that good for no-” Zacharias’s voice was cut off as he fell to the ground with a thump, falling over something large. Millicent screamed at the top of her lungs and Zacharias shakily looked down to see he had fallen on a unconscious body, the body of Harry James Potter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Millicent’s screams had gained the attention of Filch and Snape, who were also patrolling the dark empty halls. They weren’t the only ones who heard it, two Slytherin’s were snogging in a broom cupboard not far. The mercury eyes of Draco Malfoy widened and he pulled away from the kiss he was engaged in with Blaise Zabini. They both stared at each other wide eyed as they heard another scream, of Zacharias Smith. They hesitantly opened the door to check out what was wrong, Draco had permission to be out as he was head of the Slytherin Quidditch team, but Blaise was meant to be in the dormitory sleeping. Blaise was the first one to spot the body on the ground, a few feet away the petrified faces of Millicent and Zacharias. “You stay here,” Draco whispered to Blaise as he went to check out the problem, not knowing Snape and Filch were on their way.</span>

  <span>“Holy shit,” Draco whispered as he reached the two Prefects and now identified body. At that second Snape and Filch rounded the corner as Draco place two fingers on the unconscious boys neck, feeling a very rapid heart rate. Questions ran through his mind as in a blur he was already back in his dormitory after being taken away in the mix of screaming and yelling as other teachers arrived at the scene along with Head Boy’s and girl’s.</span>

  <span>Madam Pomfrey arrived at the scene, watching the blonde Slytherin being taken away. She quickly ran a spell, checking for his blood pressure, heart rate and breathing. His heart rate was 212 bpm, way above what his body should be able to handle, his blood pressure reading 60 over 30, insanely low for a teenage boy. His breathing was shallow, as if he was breathing but not taking the air in. “Get him to the infirmary right away!” She yelled as the headmaster arrived at the scene with the head of Houses.</span>
