    <hr width="“80%”"/><p>Lying on her back on the wet grass, Welkin woke to a cold, relentless downpouring of rain, and a dull, aching throb in her head. </p>
<p>The last thing she remembered was walking along the Scottish moors in the afternoon sun, behaving like the typical American tourist. She had just paused to retrieve her digital camera from her backpack when she felt a single sharp bolt of pain shoot through her head and a feeling like suddenly having her feet jerked out from under her. Her chest had constricted painfully and she gasped for breath before everything went dark. </p>
<p>Now, crawling and stumbling her way into a groggy standing position on the slippery grass, she tried to get her bearings in the dark. Night had apparently fallen while she was unconscious. </p>
<p>Blinking against the rain which was continuously streaming down the wet strands of her auburn hair and into her eyes, she stumbled in a circle until she glimpsed a dim, shimmering light not too far in the distance. Slowly she forced her rebellious leg muscles to move in that direction.</p>
<hr width="“80%”"/><p>Argus Filch, caretaker at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was making his nightly rounds, accompanied by his malevolent looking feline, Mrs. Norris. He was bemoaning the fact that thus far tonight he had been unable to catch any of the students where they shouldn’t be. It looked to be a boring and uneventful evening for him, until he suddenly heard a pounding sound echoing down the front hall.  </p>
<p>Proceeding more eagerly toward the sound, with a nasty grin of anticipation on his face, he discovered that someone was indeed at the front door, although the pounding appeared to be getting weaker. No doubt it was one of the students breaking curfew, he thought with twisted satisfaction.</p>
<p>Reaching the massive door, Filch eagerly pulled it open, prepared to apprehend the rule breaker in triumph.  A wet, muddy, bedraggled woman fell into the hallway onto her knees. </p>
<p>Breathing hard, Welkin slowly raised her aching head and saw the stringy-haired character standing there, looking for all the world like something out of the <i>Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>.  Coming down the hallway she thought she saw two other men, one with a long, white beard and the other with long, dark hair, dressed in equally long, dark robes. </p>
<p>“Castle Frank-N-Furter I presume...” she managed to say to Filch in a raspy voice before collapsing on the floor in a wet heap.</p>
<hr width="“80%”"/><p>When Welkin came to the second time, she found herself in a small, dark room with the look of a dungeon and rows of glass containers with some rather alarming looking floating contents. </p>
<p>She realized slowly that her muddy clothes and undergarments were gone, replaced by a silver-grey robe of some very soft but unfamiliar material, and she was lying on a low, not terribly comfortable couch. She sat up slowly and groaned as her head throbbed anew.</p>
<p>“Drink this,” a masculine, silky yet severe sounding voice commanded, making her nearly jump out of her newly dried skin. </p>
<p>She turned to face the owner of the voice, and recognized the man from the hallway with the long, dark hair. </p>
<p>His voluminous robes now cast to the side over a dark leather chair, he was dressed in a distinctly Victorian looking manner, in a long tunic style jacket with many buttons up the front.  A large hooked nose dominated the rest of the features in his sallow complexioned face; except for his cold, black eyes, glittering at her like a snake’s as he stepped forward and offered an ornate cup to her. </p>
<p>“It will revive you and then we can begin,” he said crisply.</p>
<p>“Begin <i>what?</i>” she demanded, shrinking away from him, and was immediately struck with a new thought. “How did I get undressed? Did you undress me while I was unconscious, you pervert? And now you’re trying to drug me!” she blurted out.</p>
<p>“I had no idea you preferred your previous disgustingly bedraggled condition. My apologies for returning you to at least a semblance of acceptable appearance,” he said snidely. “In the future I will remember that you apparently prefer to wallow in filth. As to my attempting to drug you, this is merely a potion that will make you more comfortable physically, before I begin my inquiries into the nature of your unexpected arrival here.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be such an asshole about it,” Welkin sniffed. “Just give me the damn potion. I need a drink anyway.”  She was fairly certain that she wasn’t going to like this guy’s attitude. He was definitely not a gentleman.</p>
<p>She took the cup and downed it like downing a shot. The taste was horrendous, but almost immediately she started to feel a tingling, from her bare toes to the top of her head, which, within 30 seconds, had stopped its annoying throbbing.</p>
<p>“Wow!  What’s in that?” she wondered aloud.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t really care to know,” Professor Snape assured her with a crooked half-smile. He abruptly pulled her to her feet and re-deposited her in the other leather chair. </p>
<p>“Now...shall we begin?” he asked. </p>
<p>She gripped the arms of the chair nervously as he walked around it to stand to the back of her, so that she couldn’t see him.</p>
<p>“Tell me exactly how is it that you happened to stumble upon us tonight? Do not attempt to lie to me,” he drawled menacingly. “I will know it, I assure you, and the consequences might not be so pleasant.”</p>
