    <p>-------</p><p>My footsteps echoed out across the platform as I took my first steps onto Kings Cross Station. Other than the small handful of attendants mulling about, the platform was completely empty. </p><p>Arriving this early hadn't been my original plan, but I had run out of ways to entertain myself before boarding. Still, I hadn't expected to be the only one here. Glancing above my head, I read the dusty metal sign hanging there. <i>Platform 9 ¾,</i> yep, this was definitely the place.</p><p>Scanning the platform I looked for a secluded place to wait for the train to open it doors. My gaze fell upon an old bench by the front of the train and I made my way towards it. I settled down beside my trunk and pulled a book from my bag to try to read while waiting. </p><p>A few minutes had passed and my eyes were still fixed on the same spot. I simply sat boring holes into the page without comprehending any of its words, my mind was elsewhere.<br/>
Slowly the sounds of the station began to dull and the pulsing of my own heartbeat rose above everything else, reverberating like drums in my ears.<br/>
<i><br/>
This is really happening. </i></p><p>
  <i>I'm going to Hogwarts. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>I'm going to finally have a chance to discover my past.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>-----</i>
</p><p>
  <i>I had always known I wasn't really a Parish. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>It didn't have to be said, it was simply known. But I loved my parents dearly, even if they weren't my blood.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>My mum is a world renowned Magizoologist. Her work is the reason we spent the last six years in Africa. And dad is an inventor, a brilliant one. Every Christmas he gifts me something one of a kind, a magical artifact made just for me. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Both of my parents were Swedish. They had fair skin with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. A picturesque rendition of the perfect porcelain couple. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>I however, looked nothing like them.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>I was born with skin that loved the sun. My mom liked to say that tan was my natural color. I had high cheekbones and wide mahogany brown eyes. My hair was only slightly lighter than my eyes and thick like a horses mane. And in the last few years I had allowed it to grow long enough to reach my lower back.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>I've always felt plain in comparison to the beautiful women in my life. At home I had my mother, who was drop dead gorgeous, and at school I was surrounded by dark skinned beauties who attracted all of the boys. I supposed I could look acceptable to a certain type of man, but on a day to day basis I don't turn many heads. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>I've never minded that though. I was just glad to have a school to go to. I'd always been homeschooled as my parents traveled the wilderness, following whatever magical beast my mom was searching for at the time. But when we'd come to Africa my parents had enrolled me in Uagadou.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Although I loved my classes, I never really fit in with the other students at the beginning. So few of them knew English, which made communication nearly impossible. My parents had noticed my sullen demeanor and quickly realised it's cause.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>That Christmas was the year my dad gifted me with my Lexicon Clavis. A beautiful necklace with a small intricately detailed cube hanging from it. A truly amazing magical artifact made for me alone.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>It was a key to all the world's language's. Whenever someone spoke in a language that the wearer did not know, it would translate the sound of their voice before it reaching the users ears. It could then repeat the process whenever the wearer spoke as well. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>I loved my lexicon dearly, and I would always treasure the gesture of its creation. As my father had known how important making friends was to me, that he sacrificed so much time and effort to create something so intricate in such a short period of time. It was yet another example of my parents love for me, which I had never doubted.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>So when I'd found a letter, with my name beautifully scripted on the envelope, tucked away in a dusty box of photos. I was hurt to find that my parents had kept it from me for all these years. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>The letter itself was written to me. It was an acceptance letter for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When I asked them about it they simply told me that my birth parents had attended Hogwarts, and therefore the letter had come as no surprise to them. They had simply wanted me to remain close, and therefore decided not to tell me. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>I dwelled on the letter for days. What were my birth parents like? Were they still alive? Could I meet them? I would never be able to replace my mom and dad, but I had always been curious about where I'd come from.<br/>
Which is why I made a decision to find out for myself.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Understandably, my parents were both upset when I told them I wanted to go to Hogwarts the following year. But after many spats and nights of groveling they had finally agreed to let me transfer.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Three months later I was in London, staying at a pub named the Leaky Cauldron and picking up my supplies in a bustling Diagon Alley. Until finally on the first of September I made my way here, to Kings Cross Station. Admittedly I may have arrived a bit early, but I was simply too full of excitement to wait any longer.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>I was one step closer to finding out who I was. </i>
</p><p>---</p><p>The sudden hum of excited voices broke my train of thought. Looking up from my book I found the sound was due to the arrival of a dozen or so witches and wizards arriving onto the platform. </p><p>One man in particular stood out to me. He had a large camera slung over his shoulder and was holding a notepad. He was watching the students and their families like a wild predator. Waiting for one of them to stray far enough away from their parents for him to pounce. </p><p>I watched him over the top of my book, it seemed he wasn't interested in just any student. He was scanning the faces for someone in particular.. Sadly though, as he scanned the platform, his eyes met mine, and I regretted it immediately. He began briskly walking toward my spot away from the hustle and bustle. </p><p>I decided it was time to board the train. I calmly closed my book and replaced it into my bag. Pretending as if I had never noticed the man making his way towards me across the platform I stood, levitated my trunk behind me, and began walking towards the only train attendant I could see. </p><p>She was a short woman with a pleasant round face. However, upon noticing my approach the woman hurriedly looked away, suddenly very focused on brushing off a spot on her uniform. </p><p>She was going to pretend she hadn't seen me. </p><p>
  <i>Well that's just rude. </i>
</p><p>I waited. I had nowhere else to go. </p><p>“Ma'am may I ask you a few questions?” a voice asked from behind me.</p><p>“No.” I replied flatly. A faint chuckle came from the man who circled around to face me. </p><p>“I was simply wondering if you happened to know the eldest Potter boy?” His voice was nasally and it fit his oily appearance perfectly.</p><p>“No.” My voice was harder this time. “Now please bugger off.” </p><p>I could hear the man chuckling softly as he passed by me again, leaving me to my own annoyance. Which I directed towards the attendant who was still busy pretending I didn’t exist.</p><p>“Oi! Can I please board now?” </p><p>My sharp tone startled the woman. If she hadn't been ignoring me I would have felt a little remorseful. But the greasy reporter had set me on edge and I really just wanted a quiet place to sit down.</p><p>I could read the conflict on the attendants face, she was trying to think of a nice way to tell me no.  However, before she could respond a bright flash of light blinded my vision momentarily, causing me to flinch and grit my teeth. The slow glare I shot over my shoulder at the reporter didn't even make him budge as he shot me a smirk and stalked off to find his next target.</p><p><i>Great.</i> I thought. <i>That's going to be a right lovely photograph. </i></p><p>Noticing my obvious discomfort with the situation the woman climbed down to the bottom step and glanced around us. She then gave me a small wave, signaling me to lean in. </p><p>Once I was within a few inches of her she quickly whispered. “No ones to board the train until the conductor gives the okay. But if you head straight to the back and keep your head down an door shut I'll make sure no-one bothers ya. Alright?”</p><p>I quickly nodded. “I'm elusive on the best of days, I promise no-one will even know I'm on board.”</p><p>She flashed me a quick smile and stepped to the side, quickly ushering me up the steps. With a flick of her wand my trunk disappeared, she didn't miss my surprised expression. “It'll be waiting for you at the castle don't worry dear. Now hurry along before your seen!” Doing as told I hurried my way to the back of the train. It was eerie how empty it was. I imagined that would change soon enough with all the students that would be boarding. Finally reaching the last compartment I ducked in and slid the door closed behind me. </p><p>Letting out a breath I hadn't realised I'd been holding in I sank down into the seat. The man had unnerved me greatly and I'm thoroughly grateful the attendant had allowed me to board. All I want now is a few minutes to collect myself. Leaning my head back against the worn out seat leather I focused on taking a few deep breaths. </p><p>When I opened my eyes I was met with a peculiar sight. Rather than the empty shelf that should have been above my head I found myself looking into into a pair of enchanting large green eyes.</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>The cat didn't respond, it simply stared at me. </p><p>“Sorry for barging in on you. My names Ariana.”</p><p>The cat responded with nothing more than a blink as it watched me from the shelf above my head.</p><p>“Well, suit yourself.” I yawned. “I'm going to take a nap. Feel free to join me if you'd like.”</p><p>Placing my bag against the wall as a makeshift pillow. I laid back on the seat and kicked my feet up on the other end of my bench. </p><p>“Wake me up when the other students start boarding Chaton.” I closed my eyes and tried to relax.</p><p>
  <i>No response. I like this cat. </i>
</p><p>--</p><p>Muffled laughter from further up the train woke me from my sleep.</p><p>I stretched my arms above my head and took turns stretching each leg in the air. Naps always made any situation better, therefore I always woke up from them in a cheerful mood. </p><p>I spotted my furry friend curled up on the seat across from me. It's large green eyes were watching me lazily.</p><p>“Oh, I'm sorry did I wake you? Well too bad, considering you were supposed to wake me, honestly I'm the one who should be upset.” I bantered playfully.</p><p>I reached over and scratched behind its ear. </p><p>“It's alright though, I forgive you. But only because you're gorgeous.” </p><p>Which was true. The cat was large, it's long legs and back stretched lazily covering over half of the bench seat. It's medium length coat was coal black and it's eyes a beautiful emerald green. It looked like a small panther, completely at ease with its surroundings, like it traveled the world by train on a daily basis.</p><p>Which made me wonder. “Do you live on this train? Or did you simply jump on at the station?” The cat watched me with discontent. He couldn't possibly live on the train, so he must be a stow away.</p><p>“I wonder if you'd like to come to school with me? I'm allowed a cat I believe.”</p><p>Ignoring me it slowly stood facing the back of the seat. Stretching out its long legs and raising its bum and tail in the air it stretched it's long back before settling back down in a sitting position.</p><p>
  <i>Well thanks for the view. At least I know you’re a male cat now.. </i>
</p><p>“I'll let you think about it. Until then I'll just call you Chat Noir.” Chat simply watched me with lackluster enthusiasm. His case of resting bitch face was serious.</p><p>
  <i>A cat after my own soul. </i>
</p><p>His eyes suddenly snapped away from mine to glare at the door. A silhouette on the other side told me our privacy was about to end. </p><p>The compartment door slowly slid open to reveal a tall skinny girl. It's was obvious she was of mixed ethnicity, her skin was a light caramel and her hair was a soft curly afro. When she made eye contact with me she smiled, and I swear the tiny compartment got brighter when she did. </p><p>“Oh hello! I’m so sorry I thought this compartment would be empty since it's at the back. Didn't mean to barge in on you!” She hastily apologized.</p><p>“That's alright, you're not the only one, I barged in on poor Chat here. At least you have proper manners about it. I'd say you're welcome to stay but you have to ask him as well.” I gestured to the cat sitting before me and the seat available next to him.</p><p>She glanced to Chat, who was looking utterly bored with our conversation. </p><p>“Pay him no mind, he's just a bit of a prude.” I explained, smiling at the grumpy cat. “I think we may be soulmates.” I reached across the compartment to scratch under his chin. “What do you think love, would you like to be my soulmate?” Chat gave me a look that said he'd never heard of a less exciting idea in his life.</p><p>The girl laughed and entered the compartment. When he realised she intended to sit next to him he hissed and leapt across to my seat. I shot him a disapproving glare as he curled into a ball by the window. </p><p>“Like I said, he's a prude.” I said matter of factly.</p><p>“That's alright, I love all animals, but I've learned to accept that not all animals will love me back.” She smiled as she watched Chat flick his tail at the sound of her voice.  Then she extended a hand towards me. “My names Natsumi Hanson, I'm a 6th year Ravenclaw, how about you?”</p><p>Taking her outstretched hand I shook it. “My names Ariana, but please call me Aria or Ana. I'm not sure what house I'll be in, but I'm a 6th year as well.” </p><p>“You're a transfer student then! That's amazing, where have you come from?” Her eyes lighting up with excitement as she talked. </p><p>“Well we traveled a lot for my parents work. So I was homeschooled until I was 11, but once we moved to Africa for mums research I attended Uagadou.” </p><p>I watched as her mouth fell slightly open and her eyes grew large as she stared at me without blinking for a moment. “Uagadou?”</p><p>“Yep..” I let the last letter pop off my lips as I tapped my knee nonchalantly.  </p><p>I hadn't expected anyone to care about my previous school. Quite frankly I hadn't expected anyone to know it existed. Her expression softened as she recovered, her mouth forming a knowing smile.</p><p>“You didn't think I would know what you were talking about did you?” She asked with a small smirk on her lips. “Well honestly most people probably won't. However my Gran is from Africa. And growing up she would tell us stories of the school in the clouds, carved by its founders into the side of the Mountains of the Moon. It's said to be the world's largest Wizarding school. And I also know that the students of Uagadou happen to have a unique curriculum based on teaching a few extra skills compared to most other wizarding schools. Isn't that right?” She questioned with her eyebrow raised and a humored expression on her face.</p><p>I couldn't hold back my smile, I liked her already. I glanced out the window as the Hogwarts Express let out a shrill whistle and began to slowly ease out of the station. At the back of the crowd of cheerful waving parents I could just make out the greasy reporter from earlier. By his sour expression I could assume he had never found his true target.</p><p>Picking up Chat up from his spot under the window, I placed him beside me with his top half in my lap, I couldn't fit all of him. He protested at first, but remained still once I started scratching behind his ears.</p><p>“I'll have you know I posses a great many skills, I could teach you some, but then I'd have to kill you.” I said the last part with a wink.</p><p>The corner of her mouth was still turned up in a sly smile as she regarded me for a few seconds and then we both began laughing. If she really knew anything about Uagadou then she knew I wasn't allowed to share its secrets. And I was grateful that she respected that.</p><p>Soon our laughter died away and the only sounds remaining was a gentle rumble coming from Chats chest and the clattering of the Hogwarts Express making its way along the track.</p><p>“I think he's growing fond of you.” She mused, watching as he turned his head this way and that to make sure every spot got scratched.</p><p>“I told you, we're soulmates. We both look grumpy on the outside, but really, all we want is to be pet, fed and allowed to sleep at any hour of the day, undisturbed, and in the best spot in the house.” I concluded.</p><p>Nats’ laughter was cut short by the sudden opening of our compartment door. Chat stood and turned abruptly in my lap, arching his back and growling at the boy standing in the doorway. He was tall and fit with a jawline to make a model envy. But his eyes were cunning as they lazily swept over me.</p><p>“Why hello darling.” The boy drawled. His voice was deep with an unmistakably American origin. </p><p>“Hello.” I replied coolly. I had yet to break eye contact with him, I didn't know why but this boy made my hair stand on end. </p><p>He wore a form fitted shirt that hugged his chest tightly and faded jeans but what piped my curiosity the most were his boots. Not cowboy boots like his accent suggested but leather high-top work boots. They made his simple attire look rugged and worn and suggested he didn't belong on this train but rather a forest somewhere trekking through the wilderness. </p><p>When my gaze flicked back up to meet his I saw that the corners of his mouth had upturned into a devilish grin. I got the feeling he had mistaken my time spent contemplating his outfit as interest. My face pulled into a detested scowl before I could catch myself.</p><p>
  <i>What a pompous arse.</i>
</p><p>“I can't say I recall seeing you around Sweetheart.” His lazy tone implying he wasn't at all thrown off by my disgruntled expression.</p><p>“Once again I do pride myself on my elusiveness.” My voice trailed into a small chuckle at my own joke from earlier. </p><p>His eyebrow quirked up at the inside joke he obviously couldn't follow. “Well that's just fine because I do always enjoy myself a good hunt.”</p><p>I couldn't help but laugh freely at his now shameless flirting attempt.  </p><p>“Listen Lad, I'm not sure how girls normally react to you but I have to warn you I'm no ones prey.” I rolled my eyes towards Nat who's disgusted facial expression told me she didn't particularly care for the boy either.</p><p>“You've got sass, I like that. But believe me love, I could make you very, very happy.” His eyes lazily looked me up and down again as he spoke. His tone was so suggestive that I had to concentrate on not gagging in response.</p><p>I returned his confident lopsided smile and replied in the best mock drawl I could manage, “Oh I know you could make me happy sugar, all you'd have to do is turn around and walk out that door and I'd be absolutely delighted.”</p><p>His dumbfounded expression was short lived, as he immediately scowled at the sound of Nats howling laughter filling the compartment. Behind him I could just pick out a few questioning glanced from other students interested in what was happening.</p><p>“Oh I see,” he scoffed while glaring at Nat “you're chasing for the wrong team.” Her laughter came to an abrupt halt and her eyes flicked to mine.</p><p>“What?” I asked, truly dumbfounded.</p><p>“Oh my, you didn't tell her?” He asked Nat in mock surprise. “Well that seems a bit misleading doesn't it?” His voice returning to a calm tone as he regarded Nat, who was holding eye contact with him, a look of mild disgust still on her face.</p><p>
  <i>Didn't tell me what? What does chasing for the wrong team mea… oh.</i>
</p><p>I scoffed, drawing his attention back to me.<br/>
“You really assume that just because a girl has no interest in you she must be gay?” The corner of his lip twitched as I spoke, clearly unaffected by his shocking news. </p><p>“I'll have you know that my lack of interest has nothing to do with the useless knob between your legs and everything to do with your abhorrent lack of redeeming qualities.” I gently stroked Chats back as I spoke. “Now, if you'd be so kind, please bugger off.” </p><p>He opened his mouth to reply but before he was able to speak a strong hand clasped his shoulder, cutting his reply off.</p><p>“Oi, Liam! Why don't you leave these nice ladies alone before you make even more of an arse of yourself.” </p><p>Liam turned towards the voice allowing me a view of the boy now standing behind him. </p><p>
  <i>Good Lord is anyone in this school ugly?</i>
</p><p>The newcomer was boyishly handsome to say the least. He looked like he belonged on the cover of Witch Weekly. His skin color was similar to Nats but his dusty brown hair looked touchably soft and was just long enough to cover the tips of his ears.</p><p>Leaning past Liam he reached his hand out towards me. “We're sorry to have disturbed you ladies. I'm Fred Weasley, I don't think we've met.” His smile was genuine and I felt comfortable with him despite his friends rude behavior prior. </p><p>I returned his smile and shook his hand. </p><p>“Ariana, we haven't met, I'm new.” I explained before leaning back into my seat and returning to petting Chat. </p><p>“Hey Nat, had a good summer?” He questioned, nodding in her direction.</p><p>“You know me Fred, I always have a good time.” She replied. He laughed in response before turning back to me. </p><p>“So with pleasantries aside, is there a reason our compart is suddenly the place to be?” I figured there was no point in dancing around the point.</p><p>If Fred was put off by my abruptness he didn't show it.<br/>
Instead he smiled and opened his mouth to reply but instead Liam, who had been hovering just outside the compartment behind Fred, spoke up. “Yeah actually, we're looking for our Mate, he-” </p><p>Liams voice cut out the moment I raised my finger. </p><p>“I wasn't speaking to you. I was speaking to Fred. And considering you've been nothing but rude since arriving, <i>I would like you to leave.</i>” Our eyes met and he stood frozen unsure of how to respond. I knew he had felt the emphasis I'd pushed into my words. I wasn't asking him to leave, I was telling him. His eyes flicked to Fred's for a brief moment before he scoffed and turned on his heel, muttering something under his breath as he stalked back up the train.</p><p>A nervous laugh from Fred redirected my attention to him as he watched his friend leave. “I'm sorry about his behavior, he isn't normally this much of a prick. But he's been acting like God's gift to women all summer. It's quite annoying really..” He said sheepishly. </p><p>“Well at least his friends know he's an arse.” I replied.</p><p>“Yeah, that we do. Speaking of which, that's the reason we're here, have either of you seen James?” He asked a hopeful expression on his face.</p><p>Nat spoke up first. “I haven't, and I didn't notice any compartment being stalked by girls either, which is normally how one can find him.”</p><p>“Damn. Ariana?” His attention drawn to me again.</p><p>“Uhh. Who is James exactly?” </p><p>No one answered me. They looked like I'd just told them my family didn't celebrate Christmas.</p><p>“Potter.” Replied Nat slowly as if it might help clarify which James I was getting him confused with.</p><p>“Well that's nice. Who is James Potter?” I asked again.</p><p>A few seconds ticked by before anyone spoke up.</p><p>“You don't know who James Potter is?” Fred asked with a smile forming on his face.</p><p>“No.” I replied bluntly. His smile was annoying considering nothing funny had been said. </p><p>“Well then, when he does turn up you'll probably be his new favorite person.” He said with a laugh.</p><p>I raised my eyebrow questioningly at him. </p><p>But it was Nat who responded by handed me a magazine and pointing firmly to the figure on the cover.</p><p>“James Sirius Potter.” She announced before continuing. “The eldest son of Harry Potter. He's currently ranked Witch Weekly's most eligible young bachelor. And he's also been chosen as the player to watch this year by Seeker Weekly. Even if he wasn't born famous his Quidditch skills alone would have been enough to get him there.” </p><p>She wiggled the magazine at me, encouraging me to take it from her when she'd finished speaking, looking triumphant when I did. </p><p>“He's the teenage heartthrob of our generation, girls have been throwing themselves at him since he first stepped foot on this train. Hence why it's hilarious that you have no idea who he is.” She finished with a smile.</p><p>“Oh, alright then..” I murmured quietly before inspecting the magazine I'd been handed. It was Seeker Weekly. And just as Nat had said the cover story was of one James Potter and his imminent rise to Quidditch fame.</p><p>The cover shot was a boy our age, shirtless and sweaty, wearing a pair of form fitting Quidditch trousers caked with dried mud.  He was leaned up against a wall next to his broom while staring to his right like he was in the middle of talking to someone. The living photograph was a loop of him laughing while running a hand through his shaggy jet black hair. </p><p>It was easy to see why so many girls had fallen for him. He was gorgeous. But as Liam had proven recently, a pretty face didn't make you an attractive person. </p><p>“He has a nice jawline.” I announced matter of factly.</p><p>Fred burst into laughter immediately. “Really mate!? You're staring at a half naked photo of the Hogwarts Bachelor, the same photo may I add that was captioned as ‘Dripping sex!’, and the only thing you say is <i>'He has a nice jawline!?'</i>” He was doubled over laughing now. </p><p>Chat, disgruntled by the amount of noise being made, hissed at Fred and jumped back to his original spot on the shelf above my head.</p><p>“My point, <i>Fred!</i>” I emphasised his name my hitting his knee with the magazine “Is that muscles are obtainable, but bone structure is something you're born with!” I finished my speech by tossing the magazine at him and he yelped in surprise. Nat and I exchanged glances and both began laughing as well.</p><p>The train ride was passing by quickly as Nat and Fred took the time to explain the basics of Hogwarts to me. I mentally took notes about the important details, the Forbidden Forest, Hogsmeade, the Room of Requirement.. but mostly Fred's side note about the house elves that run the kitchen. Apparently you could visit anytime you pleased by tickling a pear outside the door and they would be happy to feed you. I just hoped they took requests. Fred and Nat howled with laughter at my excitement after finding out the elves might make me macaroni and cheese. </p><p>By the time they had begun talking about Quidditch I had began getting distracted by the scenery outside. It was beautiful here, and the temperature was so much cooler than Africa had been. I wasn't going to miss sweating as much. </p><p>The sound of my new friends bickering about which Quidditch team was better filled the compartment. </p><p>
  <i>I wonder if I'd be any good at Quidditch.</i>
</p><p>I've always been a decent flyer but I hated flying in the extreme heat. That and hardly anyone at Uagadou even knew how to fly. Brooms were an eastern invention that never caught on with the rest of the world. Instead apparition was the base means of travel and almost everyone could do it by the age of 13.</p><p>“Gryffindors team is going to be unbeatable this year. Yeah Jones was one hell of a Keeper but we'll find another. Besides with James as our new Captain we're only going to get better. Promise.” Fred announced proudly to Nat in a confident tone.</p><p>Her facial expression showed she was not as convinced. </p><p>“We'll see.” She replied playfully. “Rose is wicked fast, and you may just find that she's able to get a few too many points on your new Keeper.” Fred only hummed thoughtfully in reply as he laid back in his seat. </p><p>“Hey Fred, did you say you play Quidditch?” I asked suddenly, breaking the light banter. </p><p>“Yep! I'm a Beater! Living up to my namesake the best I can!” he replied cheerfully.</p><p>“Do you think you'd mind teaching me the basics?” I asked.  “I'm a decent flyer, but I've never actually seen a Quidditch match so I'm not entirely sure how it works.” </p><p>“You've never seen a match before!?” He asked as his face fell in disbelief.</p><p>“Well you've never seen a Saran Taj match have you?” I asked pointedly.</p><p>“What's Saran Taj?” Fred asked with a furrowed brow and a glance to Bat showed she had no idea either.</p><p>“Exactly my point.” I said with a wink.</p><p>“Fair enough, but we're fixing this asap. Starting with the basics and then you're going to a Quidditch match first chance you get.” Once I agreed Fred continued to spend the rest of our train ride explaining to me the basics of Quidditch and how it's played. </p><p>Nat and I were both relieved that Liam never returned from his search for his friend. Fred however seemed confident that he was fine and would be at school when they arrived.</p><p>-----</p><p>“It's beautiful.” I announced.</p><p>I was leaned up against our compartment window watching as the train pulled closer to Hogwarts. It was getting dark outside but I could still see the castle. It was magnificent.</p><p>“Yeah, seeing it for the first time was pretty breathtaking.” Nat said.</p><p>When the train came to a stop Fred excused himself quickly saying he was going to try to spot James leaving the train. Nat and I were both gathering up our belongings when Chat jumped down from his perch. </p><p>“Oh right. I have to ask if he belongs to any of the workers before I can bring him with me.” I told Nat.</p><p>“That's alright. It shouldn't take too long. I'll wait for you.” She said.</p><p>“No I don't want to keep you behind, I'll catch up to you. Go ahead.” I instructed motioning for her to shoo with my hands.<br/>
She lifted her bag onto her shoulder “Alright, but hurry up. I don't want you getting lost along the way!” She said before leaving the compartment.</p><p>Picking up my own bag I turned to Chat. </p><p>“Still want to come with me Chaton?”</p><p>He stared blankly at me for a few moments before meowing softly.</p><p>“Good enough! Let's go!” I exclaimed as I scooped him up and headed towards the front of the train.</p><p>---</p><p>The sun had set completely by the time Chat and I were making our way to the castle.</p><p>After talking with the Conductor, the Trolley Witch, and a few of the steam hands we had come to the conclusion that no-one had seen Chat before. He must have jumped on the train while it was docked at Kings Cross.</p><p>That was fine by me, as I was growing quite attached to him. With Chat held securely in my arms I was almost jogging trying to get to the castle. Dinner surely had to have started by now.</p><p>Once I reached the doors to the entrance hall I could hear a loud voice announcing names from inside double doors to my right. I quickly ducked beside the marble stairs leading further into the school and set Chat down. </p><p>“Okay I know you can't understand me but please stay here.” I motioned towards the corner I had set him. Chat looked around for a moment before flicking his tail and walking away.</p><p>“Wait!” I squeaked in dismay grabbing him around his middle. “This isn't going to work.. Hold on.” I pulled a strip of parchment from my bag and tore a long scrap from it. I quickly scribbled out ‘If found return to Aria Parish’ on it and rolled it into a small scroll. Pulling the ribbon that was holding back my hair I used it to tie the note around Chats neck like a collar and tag.</p><p>“That'll have to do for now. I'll see you soon.” I said giving him a quick scratch behind the ear. </p><p>Rummaging around in my bag again I quickly looked for the letter I had brought with me. My acceptance letter.</p><p>I stopped before entering the Hall when I noticed my reflection in an old mirror hung nearby. You could tell I had run to get here. My face was flushed and my hair messy after tugging out its ribbon. I smoothed out my clothes and flicked my wand at my hair. In a flash my long dark hair was completely smooth, reaching down to my lower back. My hair had always been a pride of mine and I didn't want people to think I left it unruly as a regular habit.</p><p>With my acceptance letter in hand I approached the large double doors.</p><p>“Okay, let's do this.” I murmured to myself.</p>
