  <em> Draco smiles lightly for the cameras and leans his head back, letting the tree take his weight. In his hands is a bowl full of mush stained red with the berries he picked from a bush they'd passed the night before on their way to the Cornucopia. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> “Tell me,” he says to Ron, “tell me about your family.” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Ron looks up from his own bowl of cut fruit- there are no berries, of course, Draco picked them only for himself- and raises an eyebrow. “You sure you wanna know, Malfoy?” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> He shrugs. “It's just the two of us left, Weasley. I think we can wait to kill each other till after we're done eating, don't you?” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Ron laughs, a jagged, brittle thing, his blue eyes burning with regret and not-yet-necessary guilt. But he doesn't comment on the looming prospect of death, he simple starts regaling him with tales of brilliant pranks and wild feats of ingenuity as they eat. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> Draco interrupts him about halfway through a story about how his brothers and sister roped half their school into a prank war, blurting out, “your sister sounds like a </em> delightful <em> menace,” while trying not to laugh. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> Ron eyes him for a moment, as if trying to assess whether he's being insulting again, then grins. “That she is. You should meet them some day, they'd love you,” he says. It takes him a minute to realise the </em> implications <em> of his words, but when he does, he winces. “Right, sorry,” Ron whispers, and makes an aborted motion, as if he had been coming in for a hug. He flushes and doesn't meet Draco's eyes, which is just as well, since Draco doesn't want to taunt the redhead into preemptive murder. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> They sit together in a painfully awkward silence. Then, suddenly, Ron continues his tale rather loudly, and Draco laughs and smiles at the appropriate moments, all the while ignoring the numbness slowly spreading through his limbs. </em>
