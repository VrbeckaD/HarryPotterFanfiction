    <p>Harry Potter sat on the windowsill in the astrometry tower feeling a foreboding sense of despair lacing through him. Sirius was gone. Never coming back gone. His only father figure was ripped from his life because he himself fallen for Voldemort's trick.</p><p>Hermione and Ron were ignoring him, probably because he keeps pushing them away. Harry didn't mean to but Sirius plagued his thoughts and his nightmares. He couldn't sleep. If he had just been quicker or smarter even Sirius would still be alive and pouting, locked away behind the fidelus charms of number 12 grimmauld place instead of the whispery veil.</p><p>It was all because of Dumbledore. He had disappeared when Harry needed him, and a wedge had slowly driven between him and Dumbledore had the year had gone by.</p><p>"Harry?" A voice cut through his inner turmoil and Harry turned his head to face the fiery red hair that belonged to his best friend, Ronald Weasley. Ron looked tired no doubt having woken up from his own nightmare anhad noticed Harry missing when he had climbed for his own bed to wander over and snuggle into Harry's. His hair was sleep rumpled and he had a blanket over his shoulders, reminding Harry of his own slight chill. Ron and him were a lot closer thanmost people thought. In fourth year their falling out had been real but had not lasted as long a people thought it did, they had made up nearly a week after when Harry slid into Ron's bed after a nightmare about the tournament. Since then they hadgrown increasingly close, a lot like how close the Weasley twins were. Harry managed a smile at Ron through fast cascading emotions, but Ron pulled himself up from his tired slouch and gripped the blanket tightly as he walked over to where Harry was sitting watching his face carefully.</p><p>"Ron?" Harry sounded tiny even to his own ears. A warm blanket cut off his vision as it was swung around his shoulders and Ron's lithe body sat beside him. An arm reached out and snagged Harry by the waist pulled him onto Ron's chest, his larger hand placing itself on Harry's back moving in a circular, up and down motion. Harry was grateful for the comfort as verbal vomit literally spilled from his mouth without him wanting it to, he had held it in for so long he had no way of holding it in anymore. Ron's hand just continued to rub his back soothingly.<br/>
"Hush Harry, i need to tell you something" Harry shut up immediately blushing in mortification at the what he had just done and he was grateful for Ron interrupting him, he still had more to say and Ron's interruption was a blessing. Sitting up a large eyed Harry looked at Ron who seemed to gather himself together and steel himself, taking a deep breath, before beginning to speak. Harry couldn't believe his ears, "i followed 'Mione today to find out where she is going so often and to see why she is avoiding us. I followed her all the way up to Dumbledore's office,Harry. I heard everything they said to each other, about your money and mine own. She's been stealing from us, and you know my family doesn't have much money in the first place. They have plans Harry that include us. I won't tell them to you right now as your are too beaten up about Sirius and going back to the Dursley's in a few days, to deal with them right now-"</p><p>"I'm fine Ron" Harry cut in, quickly still digesting the new information being given to him, his head was having great difficulty wrapping itself aroundthe new information. He couldn't see Hermione doing that to them, but he still trusted Ron more than he did her. He would ask Hermione about it later and get thewhole  story, he vowed silently to himself.</p><p>"Your not fine Harry, come stay at the Burrow this summer, i'm sure Dumbledore will let you." Harry smiled sadly and shook his head, there was no way Dumbledore was going to allow him to stay at the Burrow all summer. </p><p>Headmaster Dumbledore had disregarded his pleas for help for years, claiming that a little bit of discipline wouldn't hurt him.</p><p>"I'm fine" Harry stressed again, "lets go back to bed" Ron caved knowing Harry needed the sleep and he wouldn't get anywhere with Harry as stubborn as he was. Sighing he shifted as they bother stood wrapping the blanket around the two of them and Harry bent down and picked up his invisibility cloak. They started back to Gryffindor tower now starting to feel exhaustion seeping into them.</p><p>--</p><p>It was Seamus's pained cursing that woke Harry and Ron that next morning. Dean was very obviously trying not to laugh judging from the muffled snickering coming from the bed next to Ron's.</p><p>"Shut up Dean!" Came Seamus's angry retort to his friends laughter, thumping sounded on the ground, and Harry had no doubt that Seamus was currently hopping on one foot. Shifting Ron flopped onto his back with a sleepy moan. Harry cracked open his eyes slowly unable to help the amused smile that wormed its way onto his face at the sight that met him when he did. Seamus was holding his bedpost for support holding his stubbed toe in one hand, the other was the one on the post, yet hewas still hopping ridiculously. Harry let out a little giggle at the sight and Dean looked at him strangely.</p><p>"That was adorable, Harry. Real cute, now care to finally tell us why you are in Ronniekin's bed?" Harry flushed quickly rising from the bed and making a scuttling retreat to the bathroom where he proceeded to lock himself inside. He heard Ron grunt something, and the creak of the door as it opened. No doubt Neville coming back inside the dorm room.</p><p>"Come on Harry," Neville's voice sounded through the door, "get dressed, we gotta head down for breakfast in the Great Hall before those heritage tests start." Harry tensed, he had forgotten all about the heritage tests that were to happen Malfoy had been pushing for it for months, although it was only rumours until three days ago when it was announced that it was going to happen. The story was that Malfoy had lost two of his sons to a kidnapping and he was desperately trying to find them. Harry wasn't convinced, he was just happy there were no other stuck up Malfoy's around.</p><p>"Ok" he unlocked the door quickly and pulled it open, Neville was still standing there, a smile on his face. Slipping past the other boy Harry padded to his trunk and pried the top open, it had taken to sticking sometimeafter Dudley had messed with it last summer. Pulling out some newly cleaned robes, Harry once again made his retreat to the bathroom to change in there and freshen up before coming put again. By the time he did his dorm mates were all ready to go and were waiting on him. They made their way down to the common room as a group, they were closer to each other than the rest of the house, other than a select few, namely the Weasley twins Ron's older brothers who had already graduated and started tyeir very own joke shop.</p><p>"There you are!" Bushy hair was all Harry saw before he was being hugged tightly. Spitting he tried to get Hermione's hair out of his mouth as Ron scowled at their other best friend. Harry waited until she pulled away from him and held him at arms length to ask her.</p><p>"Hermione-" he was cut off almost immediately as Hermione started sprouting off some more words.</p><p>"It's utterly atrocious that they are making us go through with this resort" she sniffed and Harry was vaguely reminded of a certain platinum blonde that was currently in the Slytherin common room. "As if any of us would be in the wrong families" Harry looked to Ron for help as the only girl in the golden trio grabbed his arm and started dragging him out of the common room. Ron looked slightly green as they ventured out of the safety of their common room and started down to the Great Hall, but he made no move to help Harry not that Harry wanted help, he was perfectly happy talking with Hermione, her arm looped through his. Ron's suspicions seemed less and less likely to him as he basked in the friendship that he had with the genious witch, wondering just how she had stuck around him for so long and not run for the hills.</p><p>"Hermione you can let go now" Harry tried, when her are started tightening around his and she smiled sheepishly letting him go. Harry didn't know why but that sheepish expression seemed kind of fake to him now and his mind went back to what Ron had told him what he had overheard last night. The doors to the great hall were open when they got their and two Aurors were standing on either side of the doors talking to some students seemingly sorting them. Most purebloods and Slytherins were in the Great Hall already but lost of the other houses weren't.</p><p>"Names please" the auror monotoned not even looking up from his sheet his quill already at the ready.</p><p>"Seamus Finnegan" Seamus seemed fidgety if his twisting hands were anything to go by, the auror hummed thoughtfully looking through the names and crossing one off.</p><p>"Step off the the right Mr. Finnegan, next?" Seamus did as he was told and stepped to the right right in front of another auror who they had not noticed before.</p><p>"Hermione Granger" the auror looked like he sucked a lemon as he looked through his names.</p><p>"Step to the right" he intoned and Hermione puffed up as she stepped aside standing right next to Seamus.</p><p>"Dean Thomas"</p><p>"Neville Longbottom" the two boys spoke one right after another just wanting to get it over with. They to were directed to the right.</p><p>"Ron Weasley"</p><p>"Harry Potter" the auror looked up sharply his eyes zeroing in right on his forehead making Harry reach up and cover it unconsciously. They were very quickly directed to the right. A few other student from other househad joined them in the time frame it took Harry and Ron to join.</p><p>They were soon paraded through the halls and on a very familiar course for Harry, the one to the hospital wing. There was a line going from the door of the hospital wing to halfway down the hall when they the auror was sure theywere situated at the end of the line he disappeared again back down the hallway. It was mostly silent other than the quiet whispers of nervous students, the doors to the hospital opened and a group of ten came shufflingout. Some were looking immensely relieved but two were sobbing into their hands. Harry could feel his heart start to pound ad another group of ten were directed into the hospital wing and the doors were once again shut. Harry found himself quickly counting the number of people between him and the doors. If they were doing ten at a time three groups would have to go before him and then it would be him turn. Ron would hopefully be in his group but to make sure he counted anyways. He would be and Harry felt himself relax as another group of kids joined them at the back of the line.</p><p>"Everyone good?" Seamus asked quietly gripping Dean's hand for support. No one shook their head as the group reemerged from the hospital wing. None crying this time, the next group of ten went in quickly. Two groups between him and that door, Harry's thoughts were going wild but he placated himself saying that his parents would not have done that and he was their child and that there was nothing he had to worry about other than going back to the Dursley's the next and Collin Creevey joined their little group, Collin for once was without his camera. That fact in itself was enough to scare most pf the people in the corridor. The doors opened again, no one crying. Next group went in. One group between the doors and Harry.</p><p>"Ron?" Harry looked at his best friend who looked white making his freckles stand out a lot more. "You ok?" Ron swallowed and nodded his head.</p><p>"I don't understand why i am so scared about this but i just am" Ron shrugged and grabbed Harry's hand for support. The doors opened quickly this time, only nine out the ten kids came back out. Harry's eyes widened comically before a minute later the tenth came scurrying, her face covered in snot and tears. The final ten before him went in and the doors shut in front of him as he moved up. He squeezed Ron's hand, the time see,ed to click by slowly and Harry found himself itching to grab his wand and cast the tempus spell just to see what time it was. He was proud of himself for self teaching him that one. Finally the door opened and the ten came out. Three of them in tears. Harry gulped, there was a St. Mungo's patron standing there ushering them inside.</p><p>"Well pick a bed and sit, someone will see to you shortly" the patron shut the doors behind them and the eerie silence cut through Harry like a knife, it was usually a calm serene silence not this tense one. Harry hightailed it to his usual bed and sat down Ron snagging the bed next to him. An elderly lady approached him as soon as he sat down.</p><p>"Hello dear, my name is Annie, i will be conducting your heritage test today. Is there any reason for you to believe that your parents are not your parents?" Harry shook his head violently, praying to every god he knew that this would go alright and that his luck wouldn't screw everything up. The nurse produced a sheet of blank parchment and without warned cast a light cutting curse on his palm making him hiss with displeasure. As he blood dropped onto the parchment, it glowed faintly as words began to sprout from where his blood had fallen. After three drops had fallen the nurse healed his hand, the. They sat waiting for the parchment to do its work. When it stopped glowing and Harry was able to finally see thewords writtenon the page, his heart studdered to a stop in his chest.</p><p>"This can't be true. Something must have gone wrong. Did you sneak someone else's blood onto this parchment? This isn't funny!" Harry felt like hyperventilating and he was aware of very little until a calming drought was poured down his throat. Things Came back into focus and Harry finally read through the words on the page in front of him.</p><p>Name: Kyden Cadrian Malfoy<br/>

Glancing over at Ron he was surprised to see him just as white as Harry was sure he was. Getting up Harry all but ran over to Ron and clambered onto the bed hugging Ron with all his might.</p><p>"I'm a what?" Ron seemed shocked, he seemed to be trembling, "there has to be some mistake i can't be a arrogant bigot Malfoy" he mutter his arm curling around Harry.

Heir to the Noble and Brave House of Potter</p><p>Harry sucked in a breath letting Ron go long enough to escape to his bed and retrieve his own parchment gripping onto it tightly at he turned it and shoved it in Ron's face as soon as he was close enough. Ron looked it over before meeting Harry's nurses were talking in quiet whispers as they stood by the fireplace. The fire was green obviously someone was floo calling or coming through. Harry and Ron had formed themselves around each other in a huddle, hugging each other tightly. They didn't notice the floo flare up and a regal Lucius Malfoy step through or him angrily speak to the nurses for a few moments before facing them on the bed.</p><p>Lucius Malfoy stared down at his sons, utterly disgusted with how they looked, he knew they didn't look that way originally his twin sons had had tuffs of blonde hair when he had last seen them, and their eyes were differentcolours. What he was pleased about was that fact that he had them back, they would look precious when the glamours hiding the came off. Draco would be thrilled at the opportunity to be a big brother since he was not able to be one after his baby brothers had disappeared. He hated it when Abandon, his eldest babied him. he placed a hand on Kyden's head feeling him flinch and burrow into his brother more. It was cute the way they were cuddling but Lucius wanted their glamours off. He wanted them off now. As much as the nurses advised waiting he wouldn't, his baby boys didn't deserve this injustice any longer. Signalling To the nurse beside him she nodded her had and stood at the foot while another came to join her. They spoke for a minute putting up privacy wards and silence wards,they would be taken down later. Lucius crossed his arms over his chest and stared down at his boys,they had finally noticed what was going on and were looking at him angrily. He would deal with that later. The nurses started to chant.</p><p>Kyden's grip on his brother increased the only outward sign he was in anykind of discomfort. Cadrien grunted, and hunched over his twin. Fascinated Lucius watched them transform between his very eyes. Ron had lost all his precious height, he and Harry levelled out at a solid five foot four. Their eyes were shut stopping Lucius from seeing them, but their face structures sharpened, cheekbones heightening. Red and black hair lightened into blonde. They looked dainty and cherub like. With Long eyelashes, curly blonde hair, dark pink lips, and big blue eyes Lucius had no doubt they had.</p><p>"Call my son, Draco" he ordered not looking up from his baby boys. He knew seeing them now that he would mercilessly kill anyone who even looked at them wrong in any way, shape or form. It pained him not to ba able to call Abandon but he was needed in the Dark Lord's service, he would be told when he got back. But between him, Abandon and Draco, Lucius doubted Kyden and Cadrien would be put down even though they were too old to be carried around. That would never stop Abandon or Draco from pickin them up to carry them though.</p>
