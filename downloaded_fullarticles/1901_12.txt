“It could’ve gone better,” Severus said, picking up the cards dealt to him.
</p><p>
“The Package is safe, and I’ve got Peta-Lorrum’s word that she won’t turn any students to stone,” Minerva said.  “Ten.”
</p><p>
On her command, a few chips floated from her pile into the middle of the table.
</p><p>
“But <i>how</i> did she turn Quirinius to stone?” Filius asked, taking a sip of his drink.  “Raise to 20.”
</p><p>
“She called it <i>flesh to stone</i>,” Minerva replied.  “As usual, she didn’t use her wand.”
</p><p>
“I said before, many children that grow up on the streets learn wandless magic,” Pomona said, ordering some chips into the pot.  “It’s not uncommon.”
</p><p>
“But turning a man to stone?” Filius asked.  “I think we’d know by now if someone else had discovered that spell.”
</p><p>
“Has our fearless leader given any insight?” Severus asked after taking a drink.
</p><p>
“None, but he knows something,” Minerva said.
</p><p>
“He <i>always</i> knows something,” Severus said, adding some of his own chips to the pile.  “I was asking if he’d <i>shared</i> any of that information.”
</p><p>
“No.”
</p><p>
“If Albus is withholding information, then there must be a reason,” Filius said.  “Even if the girl’s a tad off, she’s still a little girl.  Like Pomona said, she probably just learned to defend herself.”
</p><p>
“She’s still got an attitude problem,” Minerva said, adding more of her chips to the pot.
</p><p>
“Speaking of which, did we ever find out why she started screaming in the middle of class back in October?” Pomona asked as Filius folded.
</p><p>
“She <i>claims</i> she heard the castle shouting at her,” Minerva said.
</p><p>
“Since then, she’s turned a man to stone, apparated at will, and has Occlumency shields strong enough to keep me out,” Severus said.
</p><p>
“I thought she was a house-elf in disguise before we found out she used Occlumency,” Minerva muttered, glancing at her hand again.  It wasn’t a great hand, but she had plenty of chips to spare, thanks to a particular group of first-years.
</p><p>
“Don’t forget showing up to breakfast one day pale as a sheet,” Filius added.
</p><p>
“Why don’t we talk about something other than Rose Peta-Lorrum,” Pomona suggested, calling the bet.  “Flush.”
</p><p>
“Three of a kind,” Minerva said.
</p><p>
“Pair,” Severus said.
</p><p>
The chips in the middle of the table slid towards Pomona, and everyone’s cards returned to the deck that floated above the pot.
</p><p>
“Let’s talk about her friends instead,” Severus said as a floating bottle refilled his drink.  “Would anyone care to explain how a group of five first-years managed to get past the best we had to offer?”
</p><p>
“I’ll be honest,” Pomona said, grimacing at her cards, “the Devil’s Snare was only the best I could do on such short notice.  I didn’t have anything else that wouldn’t immediately kill whatever was caught in it.”
</p><p>
“Filius?” Severus asked.
</p><p>
“What was wrong with <i>my</i> challenge?  Twenty.”
</p><p>
“You left the key in the room,” Severus said as Pomona sent some of her chips into the pot.
</p><p>
“Albus didn’t want the key left unattended.  We agreed leaving the key in the room itself would be safest.”
</p><p>
“And let anyone that passed through to take it.  Call.”
</p><p>
“That’s why I made it as difficult as I could to get the key,” Filius said.
</p><p>
“There’s no need for finger pointing, Severus,” Minerva said.  “The only reason those children didn’t pass your challenge was because we reached them first.  Raise to fifty.”
</p><p>
“Fold,” Filius said.
</p><p>
“Peta-Lorrum said it was only Bathsheda’s and Septima’s challenge that gave them any real difficulty, and Albus asked them to do it <i>because</i> of her.”
</p><p>
“When was this?” Pomona asked.  “Call.”
</p><p>
“After I told Albus that Peta-Lorrum could apparate in the castle,” Minerva replied.  “He wanted additional protection on the Philosopher’s Stone, and Septima thought their dimensional prison would suffice.”
</p><p>
“Because her judgment has been spot on this year,” Severus said.  “Call.”
</p><p>
“I take it you’re referring to her decision to allow Granger to take Arithmancy early?” Minerva asked.  “Full house.”
</p><p>
“What else?” Severus asked.  “Flush.”
</p><p>
They both turned to Pomona.  With a broad smile on her face, she laid out her four Jacks.
</p><p>
“Hufflepuff never wins the House Cup,” Severus said, giving her the same look he gave Longbottom when the boy handed in a pathetic excuse for an assignment.
</p><p>
“That’s because we don’t need to,” Pomona said as she received the chips from the pot.  “I get plenty of bragging rights from our game.”
</p><p>
She took a celebratory drink as they began another round.
</p><p>
“Septima said Granger’s earned her place in the class,” Filius said.  “In my experience, she’s never late, never misses an assignment, and her work has only improved with time.”
</p><p>
“I’m glad her run-in with that troll didn’t take its toll on her,” Pomona said.
</p><p>
“Never mind the troll,” Filius said.  “What about its friend?”
</p><p>
“Perks and Granger both described it as a cross between a dragon and a snake,” Minerva said.  “We still don’t know where it came from, and <i>that’s</i> what’s troubling me.”
</p><p>
“Let’s change the subject,” Pomona said.  “Prefects.  What does everyone think?  I think this year’s bunch has done splendidly, especially given the circumstances.”
</p><p>
“They have,” Minerva said.  “I doubt next year’s crop will be quite as accomplished, but they’ll do.”  Muttering, she added, “So long as <i>next year’s</i> Defence professor doesn’t let a troll into the castle.”
</p><p>
“That’s the spirit,” Pomona said.  “Next year will be better.”
