    <p>1994 Quidditch World Cup</p><p>“Lucius Its time.” Crabbe Sr. said to my father after the quidditch world cup.</p><p>“Draco Keep out of site and If you see Potter’s mudblood friend send her our way, Do you understand?,” He explained sternly</p><p>“Yes father, but whats going on?,” I asked confused </p><p>“Just know that there is about to be a lot of chaos, I sent your mother home but I think you should see this. Now get out of site and pay attention,” He said pushing me towards the woods</p><p>“Yes Father,” I said making my way to find a tree to lean which would also give me a good view.</p><p>Everything happened so fast I heard screams and then there was fire, smoke, explosions and people running everywhere. Thats when I saw them marching in all black, the followers of the Dark Lord. They we stripping and lifting those muggles and filthy mudbloods up in the air making them spin around and around. I spotted my father immediately, he was in the front I could tell by the way he held his head high and looked down at the filth that ran passed him. This is true power I realized, this is how you make people fear you, and I couldn’t be prouder of the man I call father.</p><p>I watched in awe as people ran passed me going deeper into the woods to hide, I ignored them all until one of the idiots tripped over a stick and fell. I wasn’t shocked to see it was Ron Weasley on the ground.</p><p>“Tripped over a tree root,” he said spat, slowly making it back up to his feet again.</p><p>I couldn’t help but to comment on his idiocy.</p><p>“Well, with feet that size, hard not to,” I said from behind the ginger halfwit.</p><p>The golden trio seemed to notice me then and they all turned around with snarling faces</p><p>“Sod off Malfoy,” Weasley yelled</p><p>“Language, Weasley, wouldn’t want your mommy knowing you are saying words like that” I said smirking in his face, thats when I felt Granger glaring at me and I remembered what my father told me earlier, but for some reason I would prefer the mudblood not be stripped and embarrassed in front of thousands of people.  </p><p>“Hadn’t you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn’t like her spotted, would you?” I said trying to keep my nonchalant tone even though I was kinda nervous that someone would see her and there would be No saving her then.</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” She asked angrily </p><p>“Granger, they’re after Muggles,” I said rolling my eyes, for all the praise everyone gives her for being the smartest witch of our age she couldn’t figure that out.<br/>
She starred at me dumbfounded, meanwhile I could here the screams coming closer to where we were standing, if they didn’t get her out of here now she would be caught for sure.</p><p> “D’you want to be showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around . . . they’re moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.” I told her with my famous smirk.</p><p>“Hermione’s a witch,” Harry snarled at me. Okay so maybe the golden trio wasn’t as smart as everyone thought they were.</p><p>“Have it your way, Potter,” I said, grinning at them. If they didn’t want to listen to me then I guess we are going to see Granger twirling in the air with nothing but her knickers on. I could practically here the servers of the Dark Lord marching behind me now.</p><p> “If you think they can’t spot a Mudblood, stay where you are.” I told them still grinning but fully focused on Granger.</p><p>“You watch your mouth!” Weasley screamed while coming towards me but I didn’t care I just kept my eyes on Granger.</p><p>“Never mind, Ron, He isn’t worth it” She said grabbing his arm and pulling him back toward herself.</p><p>There was an explosion and everybody jumped while the screams got louder. “Scare easily, don’t they?” I said lazily turning to Weasley.“I suppose your daddy told you all to hide? What’s he up to…trying to rescue the Muggles?” I said laughing, Weasley and his blood traitor family really were a pathetic bunch.  </p><p>“Where’re your parents?” Potter snarled “Out there wearing masks,?” I couldn’t help the smiled that appeared on my face “Well . . . if they were, I wouldn’t tell you, would I, Potter?”  I spat</p><p>I heard Granger gasp and turn to me with disgust written all over her face, she grabbed both her friends arms “Oh come on,” she said “let’s go and find the others.” And with that she turned away and all I could see was that wild nest on her head.</p><p> I thought of one more warning to give her “Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,” I sneered. Both Potter and Weasley turned back towards me but she gripped there arms tighter “Come on,” she repeated as she yanked them through the woods. Those idiots couldn’t even tell I was trying to help the mudblood.  </p><p>I was still enjoying the scene when another explosion went off near me and I was blasted to the ground, when I looked up I noticed the tree I was previously leaning on was falling towards me, before it landed somebody yank me from the ground I turned to see who had just saved my life and it was some girl with muggle clothing and pink hair.</p><p>“Careful cousin,” she said with a smile before turning around and running though the woods. I had never seen her before but she looked like a younger, prettier version of aunt Bella. I didn’t have much time to think about who she was because a few seconds later there was another explosion, I looked up to see where it came from and that’s when my eyes saw the green darkmark floating above the trees. The mark only made people scream and panic more.</p><p>I didn’t know this at the time but that was the first but not last time I would run into my cousin.</p><p> </p><p>Tonks POV</p><p>“Tonight was terrible mother,” I said my eating dinner</p><p>“I know love, me and your father were so worried. He wanted to come and find you himself but I persuaded him not to,” she said pouring me some tea</p><p>“Yea it would have been dangerous for him to come, you should have seen what they were doing to the muggles and half-bloods. It was so terrible, I saved as many as I could.”</p><p>“Im so proud of you Dora,” she said kissing the top of my head “With this being only your second mission, I can already tell you are going to be fantastic Auror.” She said</p><p>“DORA ARE YOU HOME?” I heard my father scream</p><p>“Yes father, mother and I are eating dinner,” I screamed back</p><p>“Love I’ve was looking all over for you, I went to the auror department and Moody told me you went home.” He said hugging me “I was so worried about you.” </p><p>“Im fine, don’t worry Im a arour now this is my job,” I said smiling at him</p><p>“Yes, I guess you are right,” he said seating down to eat his dinner</p><p>“I met Draco Malfoy today,” I told them </p><p>The both stop eating and looked at me with wide eyes </p><p>“What?” Asked my father </p><p>“How?” Said my mother </p><p>“Well I was running towards where we were gathering people to help them get home when an explosion went off and I fell as well as a few other people. When I stood up I noticed a tree about to come down on a boy who was still on the ground, so I ran and yanked him out the way and thats when I noticed is was Draco Malfoy.” I explained to them</p><p>“Well….that was nice of you dora.” My father said </p><p>“Was his mother and father around?,” My mother asked </p><p>“No he was by himself” I told her</p><p>“Okay, well just try and stay away from them if you can sweet heart.” She told me</p><p>“Don’t worry I will.” I assured her</p><p> </p><p>1995 The Order</p><p>Tonks POV</p><p>Now that I was apart of the order, I had spent most of my summer at Grimmauld place. We all knew that Voldemort was back and that he wanted Harry so we needed to figure out the best way to keep Harry safe.</p><p>“You should really try and come by more Sirius, My mother loves when you are around?” I told him </p><p>“Well darling it’s sorta difficult because if anyone catch me I’m going back to Azkaban and well I don’t want that,” he said smirking  </p><p>Remus walked into the room and I couldn’t help the flutter in my stomach when he sat beside me “Hello, Remus how are you,” I asked him</p><p>“Im well thank you, and you?,” </p><p>“Im excellent thank you” I smiled at him I heard Sirius chocking back and laugh and I glared at him. </p><p>The rest of the Order made there way into the room and we discussed Cornelius Fudge‘s attacks on Dumbledoor and Harry. We then talked about how we would all contribute in protecting Harry, Severus said he was going to talk to Doumbledor about teaching Harry Occulmancy, I decided I would be one of the Aurus to go to Hogwart and keep an eye on him. After about hour Mrs.Weasly had enough of the discussion and told us it was time for dinner, when Ginny and Hermione came I moved to sit between the two girls.</p><p>“I saw you sitting by Remus”, Ginny whispered to with a wink “Did you make any progress?” She asked </p><p>“unfortunately no he is still so formal with me.” I sad sadly</p><p>“Don’t worry Tonks It will get better, It can take men a while to realize what they want.” She said patting my hand and looking at Harry</p><p>“Hey Tonks can we play that game again, the one where your morph into different animals?” Hermione asked laughing</p><p>“Yes witch animal do you girls want to see today?” I asked them</p><p> </p><p>1996 Battle at The Department Of Mysteries </p><p>Tonks POV</p><p>“Remus may you come outside so we can talk?” I asked“Sure,” He said following me on the to the balcony at Grimmauld place</p><p> “What do you want to talk about?,” he asked</p><p>“You already know what I want to talk about,” I snapped  “I don’t understand why you just won’t give us a chance,” I pleaded </p><p>“I already told you..” </p><p>“NO you’re just giving me excuses,” I screamed not letting him finish his statement </p><p>“They’re not excuses its the truth.” He said with a sigh  “I’m to old, to poor, I’m a werewolf for Merlins sake. I have nothing to offer you.”</p><p>“I don’t care about any of that, I love you,” I said feeling a tear roll down my face</p><p>“Stop,” He begged </p><p>“Do you not love me?” I asked taking his hand in mine</p><p>“You won’t be this first person I let go because I love them,” He said kissing my hand and walking back In the house </p><p>I didn’t know how long I stood outside crying and starring out at the moon but once I turned to go back in the house I noticed Sirius leaning on the wall watching me.</p><p>“He was never the smartest wolf when It came to love.” He said walking towards me “There was a time where Harry probably would have been Remus’s son instead of James, but just like you he pushed Lilly away. </p><p>“Do you think that’s the reason he can’t love me...Because of her?” I asked curiously </p><p>“No darling,” he said whipping my tears “He loved Lily but they way he looks at you, I’ve never seen him look at anyone like that.” He said with sadness in his eyes </p><p>“Why does he does he push me away the...he isn’t only hurting me, he is torturing himself as well.” I said frustrated</p><p>“He never felt like he deserved to be loved, he have always said he didn’t want to burden people with his condition.” He explained </p><p>“Well he doesn’t know how stubborn I can be, I refuse to give up on him,” I said </p><p>“Exactly, that’s what you have to do with a bloke like Remus...you can’t take no for an answer,” he said hugging me and kissing the top of my head</p><p>“TONKS, SERIUS WE HAVE TO GO,” Kingsly came outside yelling</p><p>“Why whats happened” I asked </p><p>“HARRY AND SOME OF HIS FRIENDS WERE JUST AMBUSHED BY DEATH EATERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIOUS, SEVERUS JUST CAME AND TOLD US, WE HAVE TO GO NOW,” Kingsley explained</p><p>“MERLIN,” I screamed </p><p> </p><p>When we got to the scene Harry was about to hand the Prophsey to Lucious Malfoy “Get away from my godson” I heard Sirius scream and punch Lucious who dragged Longbottom down with him, the prophecy slipped through Lucious’s hands and shattered, angry he grabbed Longbottom and put his wand to his neck but I stunned him before he could curse the boy. </p><p>“Longbottom are you okay lad?” I asked the boy </p><p>“Yes.... yes...thank you I’m fine” he said out of breath</p><p>“Is it just you and Harry here?”  </p><p>“No Luna, Ron, Ginny and Hermione Merlin’s HERMIONE,” he screamed </p><p>“Come down Longbottom where are the others?” I asked </p><p>“I don’t know....I...I...I can’t remember,” he stuttered “But Ginny hurt her ankle, Luna is stunned, and Hermione... Merlin you have to go help Hermione she is hurt really bad,” he explained </p><p>“Okay I will but do me a favor and try and think of where they might be,” I begged him </p><p>“Okay well...HEY WATCH OUT BEHIND YOU!” He screamed </p><p>I turned around with my wand aimed to see Bellatrix Lastrange standing in front of me. “Well....Well...Well if it isn’t my half-blood whore of a niece,” she said with a sick smile</p><p>“I’m no niece of yours,” I snapped back</p><p>“You are not wrong about that,” she spitting on me and laughing. I wiped her spit of my face witch seemed to anger her “You should be honored to have my spit on you,” she screamed. I was about to respond when she started speaking again “I got a plan....,” she said twirling her wand  “I’ll kill you tonight and then tomorrow I’ll go find your mommy and daddy..... I think I’ll spit all down there filthy naked bodies and once I’m done I will kill them to,” she said laughing hysterically </p><p>“Expelliarmus,” I scream but she blocked it. </p><p>“Come on niecy lets play,” she said still laughing “Crucio,” she screamed but I blocked her. She turned into black cloud of smoked but I still went after her “Crucio,” she growled again but I blocked it once more. When we landed madness had fully taken over her “DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN BEAT ME“ she screamed “AVADA....”</p><p>“PROTEGO,” I screamed before she could finish the spell, My heart was beating so hard I could barley hear anything around me. I saw Bellatrix whip her wand back and fourth “CRUCIO,” she screamed. I tried to hold my barrier but the spell was so strong it broke through and I went flying through the air. When I landed hard with a thud, I knew then that I was dying, I was feeling to much pain at once, My body was on fire, There were 1000 knives ripping and tearing my skin, and something was chocking me. I could hear myself screaming until everything went black.</p><p> </p><p>“TONKS…. NYMPHADORA….NYMPHADORA come on wake up,” I heard someone saying </p><p>“Don’t.... Call...me....Nymphadora.” I said slowly opening my eyes and staring at Moody, he gave the closes thing he could to a smile</p><p>“What happened.....Where am I?” I asked confused looking around and seeing all white walls</p><p>“Well you are at St Mungo’s,” he said “You have been out for nearly 2 days,” he told me </p><p>“Merlins, how is Harry.... and Hermione.. the Longbottom kid told me she was hurt.” I said trying to get up only to have Moody push me back down</p><p>“Harry is fine...but the girl she isn’t doing to good, They are trying there best to help her but nobody know the spell she was hit with.” He explained walking toward  the window</p><p>“Merlin they have to help her, she is just a child.” I said </p><p>“They are trying there best…..we arrested all them but the bitch Bellatrix. That Idiot Fudge finally saw Voldemort with his own eyes and now I read in the prophet he is trying to resign,” he spat turning back around to face me “But that’s enough of that talk right now you need to rest, your parents we’re worried about you.” </p><p>“Yea I could only imagine, my father is really going to want me to quit now.” I said “But I think I’m fine now Moody, I want to check on Hermione and go home,” I said trying to get out of bed again</p><p>“Tonks....There is something else you should no but I can’t be the one to tell you... so stay here and let me go get Lupin,” he said forcing me back down on the bed</p><p>“What is it....is it something bad?” I asked but he didn’t answer he just turned and walked out the room </p><p>A few minutes later Remus walked in and I let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding. (he’s so handsome) </p><p>“Remus...what happened?” I asked anxiously </p><p>“I hate to be the one to till you this,” he said looking down </p><p>“Just say it...you guys are scaring me,”</p><p>He pulled up a chair beside my bed, took my hand into his, and looked at me with tears in his eye which immediately made me start crying...I don’t know why but I just knew it wasn’t good</p><p>“It’s Sirius....he,” he struggled to say</p><p>“No please don’t say it,” I begged </p><p>“Tonks you need to know” he said squeezing my hands “After you were knocked unconscious Sirius ran to your side and stoped Bellatrix from torturing you. When Bellatrix fell Sirius started trying to revived you but you couldn’t wake, you were to weak. While this was going on we were all busy fighting the other death eaters non of us realized  Bellatrix had already gotten up and revived Lucious. She and Lucious  went straight for Harry, but when Sirius came and started helping him Bellatrix disappeared.” He said pausing and swallowing what I knew was a lump in his throat</p><p>I didn’t see or here what happed before it was to late. Harry said that Sirius stunned Lucious and was about to go back and try to revive you again but before he could.....Bellatrix cast the.... killing cures on him.” He whispered squeezing my hand tighter. </p><p>I couldn’t breathe, Sirius was gone....he was my family, best friend...all his jokes, winks,and smiles were all gone, the last personal thing I would ever have from him would be the hug we shared on the balcony before the battle. </p><p>He was dead, he died because of me. </p><p>“Why.....,” was all I could say before my heart exploded and I crumbled </p><p> </p><p>Draco POV</p><p>“Mother.....Mother where are you?” I asked </p><p>“Sweetheart,” she came running out the dining room and pulled me into a tight hug</p><p>“Mother whats wrong....why did you call me from Hogwarts,” I asked pulling out her hug, that’s when I notice her eyes were red and wet with tears</p><p>“Mother?” I said grabbing her hand </p><p>“Oh Draco....it’s your father,” she said starting to weep, I had never seen her so disheveled </p><p>“Mother please tell me what’s going on?” I asked again “Where is father?” I asked anxiously. She still didn’t answer she just kept weeping </p><p>“FATHER” I screamed “FATHE...,”</p><p>“Draco he is gone darling,” she finally said </p><p>“Gone....Gone where?” I asked confused</p><p>“Azkaban.” She said crying harder </p><p>“What...Mother please stop crying and tell me what has happened,” I asked her </p><p>“What happened was you daddy failed, he lost the prophecy, and got himself shipped to Azkaban,”  I turned around to see Aunt Bella smiling </p><p>“Aunt Bella...what are you talking about...What happened?” I asked still confused nobody was making sense tonight</p><p>“Well the Dark Lord gave your father a task to get the prophecy for him but Lucious got himself stunned by Potter and his little friends and was arrested and taken to Azkaban.” Aunt Bella said twirling her wand. </p><p>“Potter got my father sent to Azkaban,” I said in shock </p><p>“Don’t worry Draco, your father was a terrible server. He didn’t deserve to have the Dark Lords mark on his arm.” She said whispering in my ear and rubbing my back</p><p>“Stop crying Cissy….” She snapped “Maybe it will help you to know.... I killed Sirius Black tonight.” She said laughing. </p><p>I felt my mom hand go ridged and she stop crying “What did you say Bella?” She asked </p><p>“I KILLED SIRUIS...I KILLED SIRUS,” she said singing “You should have seen all of  their faces,” she said laughing so hard tears were in her eyes</p><p>My mother just started to cry more and harder than before. I was still to shocked to comfort her. Potter got my father sent to Azkaban was the only thing I could think of.</p><p>“YESSSS,” Aunt Bella screamed “I’m being summoned.” She said looking at her arm in awe “Come on Draco let’s go.”  She said grabbing my arm but my mother stood up and pulled me back</p><p>“What are you doing Bella?” She asked sternly </p><p>“The Dark Lord has no more use for Lucious… it’s Draco he wants now.” She said smiling at me. For the second time tonight I was in utter and complete shock</p><p>“What No...Draco is just a boy,” my mother said begging </p><p>“CISSY YOU CAN’T TELL THE DARK LORD NO...HOW DARE YOU.” Aunt Bella screamed. “Come on Draco,” She said snatching me from my mother and into a puff of black smoke we went. </p><p> </p><p>September 1, 1996</p><p>Draco POV</p><p>It’s been a little over two months since my father was sent to Azkaban and everything in my life has changed. The night Aunt Bella took me to visit the Dark Lord was the first time I ever laid eyes on him and it wasn’t what I expected at all. I was already afraid but when I finally saw him my blood ran cold and I could barely move, he wasn’t even a man any longer, he looked and spoke more like a snake. He didn’t speak a word to me he just summoned a few men to hold me down while he gave me my Dark Mark. Receiving that mark was the worst pain of my life, It felt like I was burning inside my body, like my veins and bones were melting off...I nearly blackout from the pain. After that he made me bow to him while he presented me with my first task, the task of fixing the vanishing Cabinet at Hogwarts so that when the time comes I can let the death eaters in to invade the school while a few accompany me to my second task, which is killing Albus Doumbeldour. A task that even now sitting on this train I know I won’t be able to complete. That night when Aunt Bella brought me back home I saw my mother sitting in the same spot I left her at hours ago, she took one look at the blood dripping from my left arm she and broke out in tears only crying harder when Aunt Bella started screaming at her. I tried to help my mother as much as I can but between not being able to see and speak with me father and fearing for me she has been driving herself mad. I decided to quit the quidditch team this years as well as to distance myself from Crabble and Goyle becauseI don’t need any distractions and they won’t understand what I’m going through. I can”t fail these tasks, its not only me that I have to think about but its also my mother. Another reason I can’t fail is because the Dark Lord promised if I did the consequences would be deadly.</p><p>“Draco Are you alright?” Pansy asked </p><p>“I’m fine, just didn’t feel like coming back to this filth of a school.” I spat </p><p>“Whats wrong with this door?” I here Blaise yell, I see him trying to close the compartment door and it refusing to shut..Blaise then yanks the door but it pushes him back and he falls into Goyle’s lap, for a split second I could see a shoe..Goyle pushes Blaise off him and slammed the compartment door shut, thats when I heard thud on the bag rack and I noticed my bag slowly being unzipped. I didn’t even have to guess I knew it had to be Potter.</p><p>“What did Slughorn want?” I asked Blaise once he flopped in front of me  </p><p>“Just making up to well connected people,” he said with a shrug</p><p>“Who did he invite?” Pansy asked</p><p>“Mclaggen from Gryffindor, um Bebly I think from Ravenclaw, Longbottom, Potter and the Weasley Girl,” he said</p><p>“What about the Granger girl,?” She asked “Isn’t she the smartest person in our year.” Pansy said smirking</p><p>“You didn’t here...she never really recovered from some injury she got last year, she’s still in the muggle word.” He said and Pansy face fell</p><p>What a stupid girl she was to go up against Antonin Dolohov. It’s better if she stay in her little muggle word before she get herself killed </p><p>“Well it sounds like it was a room full of half-blood and Blood traitors to me,” I said rolling my eyes </p><p>Anger flickered in Blaise face from being called a half-blood but he didn’t say anything.<br/>
“Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school. My father should have sent me to Durmstrang when he had the chance.” I spat </p><p>“Draco,”  Pansy said grabbing my hand </p><p>“I think I’d pitch myself of the Astronomy Tower if I had to continue here for another two years,” I said </p><p>“What that’s supposed to mean?” Pansy asked rubbing my hand </p><p>Let’s just say I don’t think you’ll see me wasting my time in Charms class next year.” I said snatching my hands from her, Blaise started laughing “Amused Blaise....We’ll see just who’s laughing in the end. All you care about are your O.W.L.s and your N.E.W.T.s, nun of that is going to matter when the Dark Lord takes power,” I told him </p><p>“What do you think you can do for him, you are sixteen and not even qualified.” He said smirking </p><p>“Maybe the job he has for me isn’t something you need to be qualified for,” I spat standing up and grabbing my bag “I can see Hogwarts I need to change into my robes.”</p><p>10 minuets latter Goyel was opening the doors to our compartment and everyone was leaving. I could see Pansy and Blaise waiting for me “You two go on...I wanna check something,” I told them. Once everyone left the Compartment I went to shut the blinds.</p><p> “Pertrificus Totalus,” I screamed once I turned around. I heard something hit the ground..I ripped of the invisibility cloak of him “Didn’t mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop...oh yeah I forgot she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.” I said stomping his face “That’s for my Father,” I stomped his fingers next “Don’t worry, you didn’t hear anything I care about, Potter.” I Covered him back up with the invisibility cloak “Enjoy your ride back to London,” I spat and walked out. </p><p>I hopped off the train to see no one left at the platform. I started walking toward the carriages not sure if there would be one to take me to the school but not really caring much. Thats when I saw someone in the distance and quickly realized who it was. The girl who save my life 3 years ago my “cousin” as she called herself. She looked different older, skinnier, darker hair, all these factors making her look more like Aunt Bella, she didn’t notice me and I didn’t care about her so I kept walking. </p><p>“Draco, we were wondering where you were.” Pansy said waiting in a carriage</p><p>“Come on before we are late to the feast.” Said Blaise </p><p>I hopped in “Did you find what you were looking for?” Pansy asked taking my hand</p><p>“Yes.” I said as we flew off </p><p> </p><p>Tonks POV</p><p>It’s been over two months since I found out Sirius was murdered and nothing seems to be getting better. Remus has pushed me further away, The ministry is in chaos, Hermione is still sick and suffering, and Harry..... I feel like Harry blames me for Sirius death. Speaking of Harry “Hey Heather did you see Harry get off the train?” I asked </p><p>“Um no I don’t think so,” she answered taking out her wand</p><p>“Its okay I’ll go check the train for him,” I told her </p><p>When I made it own the train I noticed the last compartment window shades were down. The room was empty but I knew Harry had his invisibility cloak, I was felt around on the seats, and the ground and that’s when I felt the cloak and I ripped it of him. Blood was all over his face, and clothes, his nose was crooked and two of his fingers were swollen “Rennervate,” I said pointing to him. He started whipping his bloody nose and standing </p><p>“Merlins Harry,” I said grabbing his arm “Come on we have to go the train is already starting, we ran to the first door and jumped out.</p><p>“Who did this to you?” I asked standing in front of him </p><p>“Malfoy,” He said wiping his nose again “I think he is a death eater Tonks,” he said </p><p>“Harry I highly doubt that..yes his father is one but what would Voldemort want with a sixteen year boy like Draco Malfoy” I told him.</p><p>“You don’t understand, he been acting different and weird,” he said </p><p>“His father went to Azkaban,” I told him but he just started at me “Don’t worry I’ll keep an eye out for him,” I said   </p><p>“Do you want to fix it?” I asked pointing to his nose </p><p>“Um yeah sure,” he answered </p><p>“Episkey,” I said. I could see temporary pain cross his face</p><p>“Thanks,” he said “Not only for my nose but also for finding me and reviving me,” he said smiling </p><p>“No problem,” I said tripping over my own foot and nearly pulling Harry to the ground but he pulled me up, he gave a short laugh but I couldn’t find it in myself to even smile. We continued walking in silence until he finally asked “How did you know where I was?”</p><p>“Well I didn’t really, I noticed you never got off the train and when I got on there  I noticed the last compartment shades were down.. I knew you had your invisibility cloak so I just sort of put two and two together.” I answered </p><p>We were nearly to the gate when he whispered “Do you miss him,” I knew he was talking about Sirius </p><p>“Every day,” I answered wiping a quick tear off cheek. I couldn’t even think of Sirius without crying </p><p>“Did you.... did you .....well did you fancy him?” He asked curiously </p><p>“Is that what you think?” I asked sending my patronus so someone could open the the gate </p><p>“Well yeah, that’s why I never brought up his death with you. At first I will admit I was angry with you.....I was angry with everyone actually, but then I saw how hard you took his death and I felt terrible. I’m sorry...he was your family as well and you lost him to.” He said taking and squeezing my hand</p><p>“Thank you Harry,”  I said wiping my tears “But to answer your question no I did not fancy him... but I did love him very much” I was going to continue but I noticed Sivirus making his way towards the gate</p><p>“Potter,” Severus spat “Why…are you so late?” He asked curiously</p><p>“You should hurry and go….you probably already missed half of the feast by now,” I told him turning and leaving him with Severus </p><p>The rest of the school year slowly got better, I was moved from Hogsmede to inside of Hogwarts after two murderous   incident one involving Katie Bell, the other with Ron Weasley.. That’s when the order decided they wanted me inside the school to keep an closer eye on Harry and his friends. When ever I could I took them to visit Hermione, we  spent our breaks at Grimmauld Place where I got to see Remus. Remus was finally letting me in and we decided to owl each other while I stand guard  at Hogwarts, though he still say we will only ever be friends...I feel like with a little more patience he will finally give in. Tomorrow would be the kids last day of school and I couldn’t wait to see my parents, visit Hermione, and of corse see Remus.</p><p>Draco POV</p><p>This has been the worst school year of my life, I have spent every single day fixing that fucking vanishing cabinet, I tried to kill Dumbledore twice and failed, I’ve nearly lost all my friends and I have found myself multiple times talking to a ghost in the girls lavatory. I don’t sleep anymore I can’t myself from always being paranoid and looking over my shoulder... I keep Pansy in my bed because when she is there I can at least relax a little by focusing on her breathing. Potter almost killed me this year when he realized what I did to to that Bell girl, I never seen Potter as scared as the day I was laying there in my blood begging him to kill me and finish it, the idiot just sat with me in shock until Snape came...Now the only thing I receive from him are his fucking sympathetic looks. Snape has tried to help me numerous times... he doesn’t understand I have to do this on my own. Tomorrow is the last day of school and it’s going to be the hardest test of my life...I’ll have to kill Dumbeldor and let the death eaters invade the school. I know sleep isn’t going to come to me tonight so instead I just lay there staring at the ceiling with Pansy head on my shoulder. Tomorrow I will either die or be a murderer and there is nothing I can do about it</p>
