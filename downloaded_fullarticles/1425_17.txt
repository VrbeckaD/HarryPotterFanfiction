    <p>In which Draco and Harry play rough.</p><p> </p><p>‘Harry?’</p><p>I hum contentedly as he’s stroking my hair. </p><p>‘I would like for us to... um...’</p><p>I grin. Draco, eloquent as he is, sometimes finds it difficult to discuss a kink with me. It must be his stiff pureblood upbringing.</p><p>‘What would you like, handsome? Want me to suck you off at the ministry? Want me to ready myself so you can use me as a plaything whenever you please? Want me to pretend I’m a teenage rent-boy? Let’s hear what you’ve got in store for me.’</p><p>He blushes a bit. ‘I would like to do some auror play.’</p><p>It’s a bit disappointing actually. Not nearly as kinky as I like it with him, and playing auror doesn’t really do it for me. But just as with Ginny, I would do it if it makes him happy. Maybe I can retrieve some old gear out of the attic for it. ‘Okay handsome. I’ll see if my old uniform still fits me.’</p><p>‘Fits you?’ He looks at me taken aback. ‘Fits..? Oh, I understand. Well, if you want to be the auror, that’s fine too.’</p><p>Huh?</p><p>‘Are you proposing...’</p><p>‘To be the unrelenting auror in question, yes. But if that doesn’t turn you on, we could do it the other way around?’</p><p>‘Doesn’t...’ I bounce up in excitement. ‘Draco, it turns me on beyond words. I would love to wriggle my way out of a parking ticket.’</p><p>‘A what?’</p><p>‘Never mind, it’s a muggle thing. I would love to suck your cock to prevent a ticket for performing underage magic or whatever you’ll think of.’</p><p>He looks at me predatory. ‘Oh, but that’s not what I had in mind at all.’ His eyes are glistening with darkness. Whatever he’s got in store? It’s going to be fucking amazing.</p><p>‘I really want you to play the criminal, on the run for the aurors. The garden is big enough and has more than enough hiding spots. When I find you, I’ll promise I’ll play rough.’ He bares his teeth in a feral grin.</p><p>I feel boneless. I love playing rough. With Ginny, I’m always careful not to hurt her too much. She is strong and can take pain too, but with Draco? We’re able hurt each other equally bad, overpower each other and hit each other without holding back. </p><p>‘When?’</p><p>‘Tomorrow? It’s a full moon then, you’ll be able to make your way in the garden better.’</p><p>I swallow. My cock is hardening. Quite the performance, since we just had some bloody perfect sex an hour before. </p><p>‘Oh, and Harry? I won’t be a particularly kind or righteous auror.’ He eyes me sideways.</p><p>‘I’m counting on it.’</p>
