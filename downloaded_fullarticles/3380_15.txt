    <p>Remus lays on his bed, in the Hogwarts dorm he shares with the other marauders, staring at the wall so long that his vision becomes blurred. He tried to go back to sleep, to ignore or even forget. He gets like this sometimes, usually for no reason in particular. Like everything is just too much and his body shuts down. His mind starts to slow and everything becomes so utterly dull. He's been through enough of these days to know how it will go. No school, no food, no hitting up Hogsmeade after the last class of the day. He will lay here. All day. And maybe have enough energy to take a piss but considering he won't be consuming any liquids he probably won't need to. This is what Remus has named The Void™.</p><p>James pops his head into the dorm room, probably to let him know it's time to get ready. If he's lucky he'll manage a hum of acknowledgment so James will finish getting ready then get distracted with his daily goal of getting Evans attention and leave without him. Leaving Remus to be a fuck up alone. But the world obviously hates him so James came back. </p><p>He says something along the lines of how they're gonna be late and needs to hurry. Remus doesn't respond. James continues, even coming over and nudging moony’s foot but to no avail. He disappears and a few minutes later Sirius appears. </p><p>“You okay, moony?” </p><p>“Come on, Re...It’s Friday and we have transfigurations first, your favorite class.”, Sirius tries again.</p><p>A few moments pass and Remus doesn't say anything. He loves Sirius, he really does but he just doesn't get it. None of them do. So they try their best to help but in the end, it comes down to when his body decides to let him go. </p><p>He hears Sirius talking, it sounds like nothing important so he doesn't have to respond but it helps him from fully slipping into The Void™. Sirius has seen him go through enough of this to know what helps. Remus’ chest is tight and his mind is whirling but he feels nothing. No strong emotion to focus on. He hates himself for these days. He gets panic attacks just thinking about these days. The knowledge that they are unavoidable. Nothing helps. Not the therapists or medication. Not that he's using either right now anyway. What's the point? Nothing's going to change. He tries to tell Sirius to leave him and go to class but no words leave his mouth like his voice was stolen. He feels like screaming but he can't. </p><p>He is so completely helpless. When he gets like this he wonders why his friends even bother. He's so much work and he's sure life would be easier without him constantly pulling this shit. His parents have already made it quite clear they wish he were dead.</p><p>He feels the weight on the bed shift and leave before being replaced by another weight. He looks over and finds James sitting there. It must be time for Sirius’ to go to Arithmancy. James starts talking about his latest scheme to win Lilly's heart. The side of Remus’ mouth quirks up in what is probably a pathetic version of a smile. If James just paid attention he'd see that he already has stolen Lilly’s heart. Remus wants to tell him to stop being stupid and just ask her out but all that actually is said is</p><p>“Yeah, that sounds good" </p><p>But by the time he realizes it and wants to fix it he just doesn't have the energy to. Or maybe it's that his body won't let him. Either way, he feels stuck. Like he could scream until his lungs collapsed but his friends still wouldn't hear him. Put in a straight jacket and left in a dark room. Trapped within himself with a never-ending loop of self-hatred and numbness playing in the background. He kinda smiled a moment ago so maybe he's coming out of it. He feels his eyes start to water and he really doesn't want to cry. To show even more weakness. Maybe he should stay like this. What if the real world is even worse. Maybe he's just not cut out for it. Maybe he's here by mistake. Maybe this isn't so bad.</p><p>All of a sudden he's crying and his whole body jerks. Before his brain even allows him to process what's happening he's scratching at his arms and James is grabbing his wrists to stop him before he could start bleeding and hugs him. He flings himself into a sitting position because he's scared that if he doesn't move he'll end up back in The Void™. James and Remus just sit there while Remus takes as much time needed to even out his breathing. James tries to cast an inconspicuous healing charm where Remus was scratching. After a few minutes have passed Remus starts to feel uncomfortable. He never knows what to say in moments like these. Is there anything to really say? Luckily for him, that's when Sirius enters the room with an arm full of what appears to just be an assortment of random objects. </p><p>Sirius is putting everything on one of the beds in the dorm. “Is he out of it yet? Because I got his favorite; chocolate cinnamon rolls and th-"</p><p>“I'm always available for chocolate cinnamon rolls.” Remus cuts Sirius off. Thankful for the break in the silence and happy his friends know him so well. He looks up to Sirius who's smiling and setting up the movie on the TV that they usually keep shrunken and hidden. </p><p>He's still not sure how James, Sirius, and Peter were able to break the spells that keep electronics from working in the castle and what they did to get the TV and DVD player to work without electricity. Being a prefect he tries to keep out of stuff like that and not ask for details. But right now he's happy they did it because eating sweets, watching a movie and piling into one bed with his friends is all he has the energy for. And when future Remus claims to McGonagall his absence was because of the flu, even though that's the third time this month, it will be okay because she knows what's really going on.</p>
