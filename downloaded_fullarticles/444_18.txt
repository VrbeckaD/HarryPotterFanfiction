    <p>Lord Sirius Castor Orion Aries Black III vowed that his greatest regret in life was sleeping with his ex-best friend the Lord James Potter. It was stupid of him to forget the contraception charm, which meant his highly fertile body, got pregnant. With twins. </p>
<p>It was the worst 5 months of his life but it was worth being able to hold his two babies, Caelum and Cassiopeia. His heir, Caelum, was tested to be a bearer like himself so he immediately sought possible husbands for his young son. He found that the best person for his heir was the Lord Richard Lestrange who only longed for love and not money.</p>
<p>His spare, Cassiopeia, was only revealed when she was 4 years old. She was then bethroed to his childhood friend’s son, Heir Blaise Zabini. </p>
<p>As one of the highest nobles, he knew that his son was to have a lot of pressure on him. Though illegitimate, Caelum was recognized as the heir of both the Potter and Black families and any other families magic deems him fit. His younger sister, Cassie, was the heiress of the Rosier family and the spare of the Black family, while his younger half-brother, Austin, was the heir of the Evans family and the spare of the Potter family.</p>
<p>Caelum and Cassiopeia were two very smart kids. They were sent to Thomas’s Kensington since kindergarten and have decided on future schools already. Caelum was also already set for Eton College for Year 9 while Cassiopeia planned to transfer to Wycombe Abbey for Year 7 (Caelum was to transfer to Thomas’s Battersea for Years 7 and 8). </p>
<p>It was a great relief to Sirius that both kids wanted to go to a school that allowed private tutors for other subjects. He did not want to send them to Hogwarts and that was final. </p>
<p>Austin on the other hand, was pretty much just a spoilt rich brat. He was sent to Thomas’s Clapham and was to stay there until Year 2, he would then transfer to Thomas’s Fulham until Year 6, after then would he be admitted to Hogwarts while also attending the state school Soar Valley College for his Year 7 onwards.</p>
<p>Now- onto the actual story. It was very common knowledge to everyone that the Blacks were related to the Royal family of the UK. The current Lord was actually 1st   in line of the muggle throne (Prince Charles is gay and cannot have children, so by order of law the crown will revert to the line of the Blacks) and the so-called ‘king’ of Albion (Europe, America, and some parts of Asia) in the magic world. So it was very much normal for the entire main Black Family to be awake at 7:30 am on August 1st to have the kid’s inheritance tests. They unfortunately had to be accompanied by their sire, Lord Potter, and his family in order to finish the testing. Since there was no actual age limits on the tests (though parents usually had it done at 7), Lord Potter thought it a great opportunity to have his own son, Heir Austin, get it done too.</p>
<p>All three were instructed to place three drops of blood on their respective pieces of paper, and all three followed. Their parents were then instructed to place one drop each to the parchment of their child/ren for the results to manifest.</p>
<p>The kids were allowed to read their own results, and it looked something like this:</p>

<p>Most of the things on the papers were already common knowledge to both Sirius and James, so it was mostly Lily who was confused about the whole nobility thing. </p>
<p>“Père, can we go fix our vaults now and obtenir nos cartes? Caelum and I vraiment envie de faire du shopping scolaire!” Cassiopeia exclaimed, using French to convince her Père. (Dad, can we fix our vaults now and get our cards? Caelum and I really want to go school shopping)</p>
<p>“D'accord, Cassie, dis d'abord adieu à ton papa,” was the reply of Sirius. Caelum and Cassie ran to their other father to say goodbye. (Okay, Cassie, just say bye to your father)</p>
<p>“Father, Cassiopeia and I are leaving already to do some school shopping for our upcoming year at Thomas’s. Thank you for accompanying us today.” Caelum spoke like a true pureblood heir which creeped Lily out. </p>
<p>“You will then bring your brother with you, Harry. Austin is to start Year 1 at Thomas’s too and I am not quite sure if we have the time to go buy his materials.” James replied, using the name he wanted for his eldest son. “Lily will be accompanying you while I have to talk to Sirius about certain matters.”</p>
<p>Caelum looked for direction from his Père. His Père sighed and said, “Caelum, Cassie, tu dois suivre Lady Lily et tout ce qu'elle dit. Achetez les fournitures dont vous avez besoin et allez à l'école pour confirmer vos admissions. Carlos et Michael vous suivront comme protection.” (Caelum, Cassie, you are to follow Lady Lily and everything she says. Buy the supplies you need and go to the school to confirm your admissions. Carlos and Michael will be following you as protection.)</p>
