    <p>Its has been two years since the battle of Hogwarts. Two long years of trying to rebuild the magical world after a crazy madman tried to kill everyone. Two years of listening to my best friends screaming in the night. Harry and Hermione, my best friends, the people i care about most.</p>
<p>Lets get some things hashed out shall we. So my father is now in St Mungo's. He kind of drove himself mad with guilt over betraying my friends when they approached him for help, i suppose it didn't help that i showed up singing their praises that they saved me from Malfoy manor. Anyway he tried several times to apologise to Harry and Hermione but just ended up crying and speaking gibberish, then he turned his wand on himself tried to obliviate the guilt away and well no he is less my dad and more my little brother who cant look after himself.</p>
<p>So i rebuilt the house, well a little less eccentric than it was before. Larger basement for the printing press and more rooms for people and not research. Still round. Still tall but wider and with more care to the grounds. Its a home. Well my home. Our home. Harry and Hermione live with me, they needed someone to help them when the war ravished their minds and hearts. I didn't think twice about it. Just built two extra rooms at the top of the house and told them they were welcome to come and stay whenever they liked. That was about twenty two months ago now. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong though i love them both, with my whole heart. I absolutely adore having my two best friends living with me..... But now and again i do have to tell them off. Harry now and again does this whole "I'm going to drink myself to death and there is nothing you can do to stop me" routine. Poor man gets so drunk and passes out for a couple of days. This happens about once a month now, this is good as at the beginning it was every few days. </p>
<p>Hermione on the other hand is slightly more.... Well me like when she goes off on one. She will spend days apon days pouring through books and writing notes and research into anything and everything. About a month into the pair moving in she cam bouncing over to me shouting some gibberish, at about 100 miles a second, that she had found a nest of Jigglypuffs in the south west of England. She insisted that we needed to pack and go and find these creatures right away. Needless to say i was excited for her but had no idea what these creatures were. But after she started rambling about making some sort of ball that captures them i stunned the poor witch and put her to bed. </p>
<p>So this is my life now. I'm not complaining. I love my friends. But how the hell did i become the voice of reason? </p>
<p>CRACK</p>
<p>I look round and there in the middle of my front room is a strange looking house elf, Hogwarts emblem emblazoned on the front of his shirt.</p>
<p>"hello mistress Lovegood, I has been sent by Head mistress to be asking you to be coming with me to her office please?" the strange elf croaked out whilst holding out a hand for mine.</p>
<p>Unsure of whats going on, but sure that Minerva wouldn't send a house elf unless the need was great i reached out and took the small hand.</p>
<p>CRACK</p>
