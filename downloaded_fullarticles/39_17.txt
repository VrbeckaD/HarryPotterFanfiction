          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco <em>never</em> eats breakfast. He steals a bag of Mother’s freshly baked biscuits as he heads to the floo point. He’ll grab a toffee latte on the journey. </p><p>Draco <em>never</em> eats lunch. Today he’s meeting Harry in the Leaky. He buys a couple of Chocolate Frogs to tide him over and a Pumpkin Pasty for the afternoon. </p><p>Draco <em>never</em> eats dinner. He’s meeting Pansy. He'll snaffle a quick, greasy Muggle pizza when he leaves the bar, eat it quickly in his bed. </p><p>Draco sighs, looking at the scales. Another three pound gain? Merlin. It was hardly fair. He never ate!</p></div>
