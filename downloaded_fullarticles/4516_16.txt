    <p dir="ltr">Twelve-year-old Amy Havens was sitting alone in the Great Hall trying to get a bit of homework done between classes when the most extraordinary thing happened. Someone came marching up to her. Seeing as Amy had been on the receiving end of a very powerful Memory Charm just before coming to Hogwarts, she didn’t know anything about her past. Or anyone.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
Even now, almost two years later, she spoke to no one, keeping her head down and getting her work done. Amy had perfected the art of blending in. Absolutely no one in school knew who she was. If they ever got a glimpse of her, she’d be gone a second later. She preferred it that way. Being practically invisible had allowed her to discover so much more about the ancient castle than she would have been able to otherwise.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
“Eva?” the boy whispered and she shook her head, still baffled this boy had noticed her. She was usually able to practically melt into the woodwork so nobody noticed her. She even had her own dorm.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
“Amy,” she said quietly. “You’re in my year, aren’t you? In Gryffindor?” She had seen him around before, usually surrounded by a group of admirers, as he was on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Everyone seemed to be obsessed with Quidditch for some reason Amy could never understand.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
“Yeah,” the boy’s abstraction from when he first walked up seemed to disappear in an instant. “I’m James Potter. Want to come sit with me and my mates?”<br/>
Amy didn’t know what to say, but the boy—James—didn’t seem to be able to take no for an answer. She made not a squeak of protest as he took hold of her arm and practically dragged her to the nearly empty Gryffindor table where three other boys her age were sitting.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
She could only imagine what they were thinking as James introduced her. Amy’s plainness was part of why she’d been able to blend in so well. Her pale skin, black braids, and hazel eyes really weren’t anything special.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
“H-hi,” the shortest, slightly lumpy boy stuttered. “I-I’m P-Peter. Peter P-Pettigrew.” Amy smiled faintly at him, grateful he said anything at all.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
“Remus Lupin,” said the one with the sandy hair. Poor kid looked half asleep, but still managed to give Amy a genuine smile, making her feel much more at ease.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
“Sirius Black, but you can call me anything you want, love,” the one with long shaggy hair said with a wink, turning Amy’s face bright red. James smacked his arm and he scowled momentarily before going back to his original flirty grin.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
After the introductions had been made, the conversation started up again and Amy found herself enjoying listening to their discussion, though not inputting anything herself. It was sort of nice being around people again.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
By the end of the day, Amy had four friends. She hadn’t been this happy or felt this normal since she was Obliviated. She just hoped that her newly formed friendships would last.</p>
