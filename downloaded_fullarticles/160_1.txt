          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Moony! Let’s go!” Sirius called for the tenth time. Remus was still in the bathroom, drying his hair, so Sirius doubted that the other boy heard him. He sighed and plonked down on Remus’s bed. It was far more comfortable than his own. He always used that excuse whenever James asked him why they never slept in Sirius’s bed. Truthfully, it was more about how Remus’s scent clung to the pillows. </p>
<p>When he laid down, he stretched out and put his hands under the pillow to feel the coolness underneath. Instead, his hand met cardboard. He quickly sat up and pulled whatever it was from under the pillow.</p>
<p>A sketchbook.</p>
<p>He flipped it open. The first page was a drawing of two hands almost meeting each other. Something he recognized vaguely from some muggle painting. The next page were eyes. Also vaguely familiar, though he didn’t know why. They were so realistic, they could’ve been a photograph. </p>
<p>Did Moony draw these?</p>
<p>He kept flipping through pages and pages of hands touching, of collarbones, of skin, until he finally landed on a face. </p>
<p>His own. </p>
<p>It had to have been drawn from memory, but it looked so much like him that it was startling. It felt like his grey eyes would wink back at him. He wondered if Remus had animated any of them like the paintings that dawned the walls of Hogwarts. He wondered if Remus even knew how. He probably did. Remus’s knowledge knows no bounds. </p>
<p>He flipped again and this time there were two boys on the page. One with the brown curly hair that he knew so well and the other was his own thick mess of black cascading past his shoulders. They were sitting on a cliff, watching the sunset, hands intertwined. Sirius couldn’t help but smile. </p>
<p>“Dammit,” he heard a voice say. When he looked up, he saw Remus standing there, all dressed up for their date to Hogsmeade. “You found your anniversary gift. I wasn’t done with it yet.” </p>
<p>“Well, it wasn’t a very good hiding spot,” Sirius said and hugged the book to his chest. </p>
<p>“Yes, well, I put it there temporarily so I wouldn’t forget to finish it.” </p>
<p>“It looked pretty finished to me,” he said and opened it back up to the sunset page. </p>
<p>Remus sat down next to him and took the sketchbook. He then turned to the next page, the last page, of the book. Sirius’s breath hitched. It was beautiful. Obviously, all the drawings were beautiful, but this one took his breath away. Even though it wasn’t fully colored in, he couldn’t believe how amazing it was. </p>
<p>It was them. Their bodies curved around each other, mouths pressed together. He felt himself get hot in the face. The drawing stopped at the torso, but he couldn’t help tracing his finger along the penciled edge of Remus’s back. </p>
<p>“Wow, Moony, I— I didn’t know you could draw like this,” Sirius said, barely above a whisper. </p>
<p>Remus, usually quick-witted and sarcastic, seemed to be at a loss for words. His face was tinted pink. He smiled sheepishly. “Yeah, I can draw alright, I guess.” </p>
<p>Sirius let out a laugh. “Alright? Moony, these are incredible! I can’t believe you made all this for me.” He turned to meet his gaze and kissed him, setting the sketchbook aside so he could get closer to his boyfriend. </p>
<p>Remus chuckled into his mouth. “I love you,” he said when they pulled apart, resting their foreheads together. </p>
<p>Sirius grinned so hard his face hurt. “You mean it?” </p>
<p>Remus laughed softly. “You think I’d draw you so many times if I didn’t mean it?” </p>
<p>Sirius shrugged. </p>
<p>“The reason that I drew you so many times is because I couldn’t <em>help</em> but draw you. Every time I put pencil to paper, you came out on the page.”</p>
<p>Sirius pulled him in for another kiss. He’d never heard Remus talk like that. It was all sharp comments and playful insults and unsaid words. Sirius wanted to hold onto this moment for as long as he could. </p>
<p>When they pulled apart again, Sirius wrapped his arms around the other boy. “I love you too,” he said softly. “So much.”</p></div>
