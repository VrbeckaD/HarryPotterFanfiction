Or rather, his nose was buried in his phone until that deep, sinful voice in front of him ordered a large dark roast, black. He slowly pulled his eyes away from the small electronic device in his hands and allowed his grey orbs to drag up the backside of the slim form at the cash register only two people in front of him.</p><p>He shifted slightly to his left and caught a glimpse of the other man's bare left hand. A smirk tugged at the corner of Sirius’ lips. It was worth a shot, he mused to himself.</p><p>The other man stepped away, and the lady in front of Sirius proceeded to order her drink — some tea concoction with too much milk for his tastes.</p><p>“Next,” the other barista called out as his previous customer made their way to the pickup area. “Hello, Sirius,” he said with a grin when Sirius was in front of him. “Your usual?”</p><p>Sirius laughed. “Of course, Nick. What else would I get?” He paused for a moment before adding, “Other than that horrible Americano stuff you had me try a while back.”</p><p>Nick laughed and rolled his eyes as he rang up Sirius’ order. “I was just trying to get you to broaden your horizons.”</p><p>“I know, but I like my coffee like I like my men,” he waggled his eyebrows, “tall and dark with a touch of sweetness.”</p><p>Nick leaned closer. “Well, tall, dark, and handsome just walked outside to sit at one of the tables like he usually does every Wednesday.”</p><p>“Good to know,” Sirius replied as he took his large black, dark roast coffee from Nick's hand. “Have a good day, kid.”</p><p>“You too, Sirius,” Nick replied, “and good luck!”</p><p>Waving a hand over his shoulder, he quickly made his way over to the side table where he added just a touch of sugar to the otherwise straightforward drink. Replacing the lid, Sirius turned and made his way out of the coffee shop.</p><p>As the door closed behind him, a voice to his left stopped Sirius’ search for the other man before it even began, “Tall, dark, and sweet, you say?”</p><p>Turning to face the seated man, Sirius replied, “I do.” He gestured to the other chair at the two-person table. “May I?”</p><p>“You may,” the other man replied, “only if you tell me your name and join me for an Irish coffee Friday night after work.”</p><p>A rakish grin spread across Sirius’ lips. “Sirius Black,” he replied as he sat down, “and you have yourself a deal, mister…?”</p><p>The other man returned Sirius’ smile with a gleam in his dark blue eyes. “Slytherin, Salazar Slytherin.”</p></div>
