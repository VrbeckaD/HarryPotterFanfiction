    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>You were seething as you entered the Great Hall, an eruption of laughter coming from the Gryffindor table which you attributed to your hair; bright scarlet and gold, obviously the result of the Weasley twins. You glowered as you made your way towards the Slytherin table, sneers across their faces. You rolled your eyes, feeling the intense glare of your house head from the Professors’ table, causing you angrily grab a piece of toast. You plopped down into the seat, angrily opening your transfiguration textbook to review once more for the test you would have in less than twenty minutes.</p>
<p>You blamed your roommate. Stupid fucking Astoria Greengrass. She couldn’t just fucking grab you a piece of toast while you dealt with the mess that was your hair. Truthfully you blamed yourself. Despite having woken up earlier than usual, you had meandered in bed, planning out when you would do which assignments, as well as finishing up the essay that was due in potions. Yes, it was a week early, but despite being the head of your own house, Snape had a profuse hatred for you, being a muggle-born Slytherin. The only non-humanly repugnant thing he did, you decided, was omitting to the other Slytherins about your blood heritage and the other muggle-born Slytherins, a fact you were often thankful for; that didn't change your mind that he was an evil and cruel man. Due to his hatred for you and yours of him, you created a system of 
completing his assignments early, to give you an adequate amount of time to revise them to be up to his incredibly impossible standards.</p>
<p>Therefore, you hadn’t gotten out of bed till about a half hour till breakfast would be over, screaming in horror as you came upon the sight of your hair. You immediately knew that this was the work of the ginger twins, wondering how they were able to do this. It was probably when they were down at the pitch during the Slytherin quidditch practice, and it seemed that you were the unfortunate soul whose shampoo was targeted, causing you to be the victim of this prank. You were upset; if you had gotten out of bed twenty minutes before, you would’ve had enough time to reverse the effects, but no, you had to spend effort on making your bed so that the elves wouldn’t do it —you didn’t regret that. It seemed that your rather quiet squeal awoke your roommate, who ran into the bathroom, before cackling at your ailment. And of fucking course she had refused to get you a piece of toast so that you could save yourself the humiliation of wandering the halls with bright Gryffindor hair for the remainder of the day, rather than having the pleasure of the hotshot twins knowing that their immature prank was foiled, and perhaps you could have even given them a taste of their own medicine. </p>
<p>It didn’t help that they had already let loose a niffler in your room. This hair was the icing on top of the cake.</p>
<p>You chose to ignore the comments and snickers about your hair, glaring dangerously at someone who had been a little too enthusiastic about the situation, instantly shutting up and returning to whatever meaningless conversation they had been participating in before.</p>
<p>You carried yourself with haughtiness, opting to roll your eyes at the guffawing twins with their hoard of Gryffindor friends, thinking they were some big hot shots because they were seventh years. No, you would not give them the satisfaction of seeing you angry, making their prank even more useless. Maybe they were getting lazy in their old age. Yes, that was it.</p>
<p>You walked quickly and with purpose towards Professor McGonagall’s classroom, ten minutes early, only a few other people in the room, most of them seeming to be frantically studying last minute. You slipped into your seat, noticing in your peripheral McGonagall turning her head slightly, as if in question, unsure if there was a smirk or sympathetic smile on her face, or unsure if she even moved. You pushed the thought from your head as you took out your pencil case, and took out your reading and homework, calmly reviewing your notes for the test.</p>
<p>Cormac McLaggen slipped into the seat next to you, and you could feel his haughty gaze on you as you continued to study, purposefully ignoring him. Really why was McGonagall still giving you, <i>sixth years</i>, assigned seating?</p>
<p>“Gotta quill, eh <i>Slytherin?</i>” He asked, and you could practically hear the arrogance in his voice, mocking the hair colour you were currently sporting. You really hated being desk-mates with him.</p>
<p>“I happen to quite like my hair, I was desperate for a change.” You said sarcastically, rolling your eyes, nonetheless handing him a quill, knowing from prior experience that he would stop bothering you about then. You turned back to your notes; he would have to worry about the ink once he remembers about it.<br/>

</p><p>You glanced up at the clock, less than a minute before the official beginning of the class, putting your notes and textbook back into your bag, grabbing a ballpoint pen from your pencil case while placing your homework neatly in the middle of the table. Professor McGonagall picked up your paper as she placed two tests in the middle of your table, you taking the top one, while McLaggen was furiously whispering around to see if anyone had an extra inkpot, causing a small smirk to appear on your face.<br/>

</p><p>The hour progressed slowly, this test being a slightly more uncomfortable than any other that you had experienced: feeling people’s stares on you, or rather your hair. Nevertheless, if it was distracting them then if would be their fault when they failed the test. Every fifteen minutes Professor McGonagall would alert the amount of time remaining on the test, though otherwise it remained silent, save for the one time she yelled at everyone to get back to work, feeling relieved as you felt the stares on you immediately leave.<br/>

</p><p>Perhaps it was because your hair was so distracting to others that you finished the test first, actually checking your answers because Professor McGonagall was notorious for being a harsh grader with some of the hardest exams.<br/>

</p><p>People began to follow suite, turning in their tests, as she moved towards the board, and with a flick of her wrist the homework assignment was on the chalkboard. You wrote it down in a small planner that you carried for this exact reason. You gathered your belongings and placed them in your bag, opting to start on the reading that she had assigned, waiting for the five minutes till class was over.<br/>

</p><p>You walked out of the classroom proud, because you fucking crushed that test.<br/>

</p><p>You glanced down at your watch, trying to memorize where your next class was it still was the beginning of the year after all, and opened your schedule, realization hitting you that you had Seventh Year Charms next. The class you shared with the Weasley twins.<br/>

</p><p>You groaned in frustration, beginning the trek to Professor Flitwick’s classroom, trudging your feet across the stone as if it would delay the inevitable. After about thirty seconds or so, you huffed at your ridiculousness, beginning to walk normally, boring yourself with how slowly you had been walking.<br/>

</p><p>It seemed that fate was on your side, as you walked into the classroom, second years slowly filing into the classroom. You raised an eyebrow, before it hit you that this was when your free period was; you had volunteered to be a teacher’s assistant.<br/>

</p><p>Seizing advantage of this opportunity, you strode up to the front of the classroom, offering Professor Flitwick a pleasant smile, not placing your bag down in the small desk by his desk as you had been doing for the past week and a half.<br/>

</p><p>“Professor, is it alright if I can use this time to get this out of my hair?” You asked, motioning towards your hair.<br/>

</p><p>He looked up at you, an amused smirk on his face, and you rolled your eyes slightly, almost knowing what he was going to say next. “I would’ve expected that you would have done that earlier in the morning.” He said, a playful edge to his tone.<br/>

</p><p>You chuckled ruefully. “I overslept.” You stated simply. “So, Professor, considering that I am your star pupil, and I am here for the next two hours, can I get those twenty minutes to sort it out?” You asked, the same playful tone in your voice.<br/>

</p><p>“Yes, very well.” He said, motioning for you to leave, having gone into his Professor mode, beginning the lesson. You quickly left the classroom, throwing a devastating glare at some poor second year who was staring at you for too long.<br/>

</p><p>You quickly made your way through the corridor, entering the common room, luckily the password wasn’t bigoted at all making a run towards your dorm, setting your bag down with a large thud. You quickly changed into a t-shirt, should something go wrong, not that you expected it to, before walking into the bathroom.<br/>

</p><p>“<i>deago colour.</i>” You muttered quickly, the colour beginning to seep out of your hair, slowly returning to its natural colour. You knew that this process would take between five and ten minutes to finish, so you took the opportunity to brush your teeth again, giving yourself more time to compose yourself for the day than the small amount of time you had had in the morning.<br/>

</p><p>After about ten minutes, you slowly picked through your hair, trying to see if any patch of colour had remained, and to your glee none had. A victorious grin overtook your face, changing back into your uniform shirt, and restyling your hair for the day, making sure that it wasn’t in your face.<br/>
You quickly grabbed your schedule once more, looking over your classes for the rest of the day, not that it ever really changed, slinging your bag over your shoulder, exiting Slytherin common room.<br/>

</p><p>“Shit!” You whispered violently, as you nearly stepped off the landing, the stairs that you were about to step on having just moved. You stuffed your schedule back into your bag, figuring that knowing what you were gonna do during the day was not worth getting killed by the castle. You flipped off the stairs, before rushing down the staircase, having to take the long way.<br/>

</p><p>You grumbled slightly, walking towards the other side of the castle, passing the library, and after a split second of hesitation you entered, walking towards Madam Pince’s desk, pulling the novel out of your bag and setting it down.<br/>

</p><p>“Done already?” She asked, peering over her glasses to look at you.<br/>

</p><p>“Yep!” You answered enthusiastically. “I really enjoyed it. You don’t happen to have the continuation, do you?” You asked, and she seemed to scan over the cover.<br/>
She held out one finger, muttering out a, “One moment,” making her way through the stacks. After five years you were still unsure of if you should follow after her, so you opted to idle around the desk, fiddling anxiously with your fingers.<br/>

</p><p>“Dammit!” You heard someone mutter next to you. “Where the hell is she?”<br/>

</p><p>“She’s getting me a book.” You offered quietly, motioning in the general direction of where she had gone. As you turned back to the other person, finally getting a good look at them, seeing Lee Jordan standing there.<br/>

</p><p>He seemed to turn to you, considering you, before a smirk grew across his face. “What happened to your hair?” He snickered, motioning towards his own.<br/>

</p><p>“Funny, I could say the same about yours.” You quipped; he had an unusual haircut that he had never seemed to have before.<br/>

</p><p>His smirk soured a little, his eyes darkening, and you offered a sickeningly sweet yet fake smile, the both of you standing there in a sort of stalemate.<br/>

</p><p>You broke it, offering a warm smile and thanks to Madam Pince who had returned with your book, beginning to check out the books that Lee had piled onto the desk.<br/>

</p><p>“You know,” you said, turning on your heel to face Lee Jordan. “Perhaps the three of you had gone soft in your old age.” The words poured out, the fake smile stretched over your face once more, before turning away from him and stalking out of the library.<br/>

</p><p>“Dumbass!” You chastised yourself, hating that you couldn’t have kept your mouth shut, because you had now practically invited them to prank you again.<br/>

</p><p>You gently tapped your forehead, mentally beating yourself up over the interaction, letting your pride get in the way.<br/>

</p><p>You straightened your back, nodding your head slightly to compose yourself and began walking, your hair bouncing behind you. You took a breath, your face hardening, the gleam of determination in your eyes as you marched back to Professor Flitwick’s room.<br/>

</p><p>“Good job!” You cheered on the second years as they began filling out, helping Professor Flitwick grab the materials that they had been using.<br/>

</p><p>“I must say, remarkable work.” Flitwick spoke, motioning towards your hair.<br/>

</p><p>A fake-embarrassed smile flitted over your face. “Well, I had a really good teacher.”<br/>

</p><p>It was his turn to smile. “I’m so incredibly proud of you, (y/n). You’ve become a fine young witch.”<br/>

</p><p>You smiled brightly, turning to him, feeling so incredibly good that you felt tears welling up in your eyes. “Thanks, Professor.” You quickly dabbed at your eyes, brushing away unshed tears, before grabbing your bag from the desk next to his, and moving over to your seat in the front of the class, pulling out your book while waiting patiently for other students to begin filing in, glad that you hadn’t been emotional in front of them.<br/>

</p><p>You were nearing the end of the first chapter, when you saw in your peripheral someone slip into the seat next to you. That was rather odd, because you sat in the front and nobody ever wanted to sit so close to the board. Your curiosity piqued, you glanced over the top of the book to find a red-headed Gryffindor occupying the chair next to you. Your eyes widened, but you didn’t react more than that, pretending to go back to reading, despite the racing thoughts and sweaty palms as to why one of the Weasley twins was sitting next to you, knowing that it had something to do with the semi-avoidance of their prank or your remark to Lee Jordan.<br/>

</p><p>You weren’t even sure you blinked as you stared at the ink on the page, not being able to comprehend a single letter among the jumble.<br/>

</p><p>“Wow, you’re taking a long time to read a page.”<br/>

</p><p>You hadn’t realized that you hadn’t been breathing.<br/>

</p><p>You inhaled sharply, and continued to stare at the page, choosing not to respond.<br/>

</p><p>“Really, I’ve read it three times now.”<br/>

</p><p>“Didn’t your mother ever teach you that it was rude to read over other people’s shoulders.” You snarled, looking up from the book, angrily shutting it to glare at him.<br/>

</p><p>“Maybe, dunno, never really listened to her rules about manners.”<br/>

</p><p>“That much is evident.” God, you should just stop talking. Please stop creating more fodder to be the target for future pranks.<br/>

</p><p>“What’cha say?”<br/>

</p><p>“You heard me.” Stop talking. Right now!<br/>

</p><p>“Oh, and now are you sure about that?”<br/>

</p><p>“Because Ronald, Ginny, and Percy all have wonderful manners.” Please, shut up.<br/>

</p><p>“Oh really? You think Percy wasn’t rude.”<br/>

</p><p>“Piece of cake compared to you and your other half.” Shut. Up.<br/>

</p><p>“Oh, you think so.”<br/>

</p><p>“Yes! For the sake of Merlin, please stop talking to me!” You shouted, frustration seeping into your features.<br/>

</p><p>A smug smirk crawled onto his face, a deep rage burning within you along with the urge to smack him in the face.<br/>

</p><p>“I liked your hair this morning.” He commented, the stupidly smug smirk still on his face.<br/>

</p><p>“Thank you, I wanted to show my support for Gryffindor against Ravenclaw this weekend.” You sassed, rolling your eyes, and making a face while slightly sticking your tongue at him.<br/>

</p><p>“Oh, so you want Gryffindor to beat Ravenclaw. Why?” That fucking smug ass bastard.<br/>

</p><p>“So that I can beat you with a bludger.” You snarled, enunciating every word with anger, your nails digging into the palms of your hands as your fists trembled under the desk.<br/>

</p><p>“Unfortunately that wouldn’t be happening. See, my other half and I are too good for that.”<br/>
</p><p>“No, you’re too lazy to move.”<br/>
</p><p>“That....might be true.” He admitted, his smirk changing into a genuine smile which was worrying you immensely.<br/>
</p><p>“Shouldn’t you be getting back to your other half?” You asked, anxious to be alone.<br/>
</p><p>Unfortunately, luck was not on your side as Flitwick cleared his throat, signaling the beginning of class. He became a more difficult teacher as the years went on, and after third year the expectation in his class was that nobody should leave their seats, lest for the bathroom.<br/>

</p><p>You looked away from the twin, facing your attention on the board, beginning to take notes on what Flitwick had put up on the board. You could feel his stare on you, and you did your best to ignore it, focusing all your attention on the lesson.<br/>
</p><p>About five minutes in, it was too much, and you quickly turned towards him, hissing through clenched teeth. “What are you doing?”<br/>
</p><p>He looked amused, and you rolled your eyes, the urge to sock him coming back. “You got a piece of parchment?” He asked, and you rolled your eyes in exasperation, flipping to the back of your notebook and ripping out an empty page, bitterly sliding it to him.<br/>
</p><p>He finally looked away from you, and you felt somewhat relieved, being able to focus enough to understand the concept that Flitwick had been explaining.<br/>
</p><p>You raised your hand, needing confirmation about what he had just said. “So, essentially non-verbal charms have to do with the intent and emotion of the caster? Which is why they’re so powerful, yet so unpredictable?”<br/>
</p><p>“Correct!”<br/>
</p><p>You smiled slightly, proud of yourself your body straightening as you took more notes.<br/>
</p><p>“You really didn’t know that? We covered some of that last year.” The twin whispered to you, and you suddenly felt self-conscious, your cheeriness immediately dissipating as you tried to cave in on yourself.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m... a sixth year.” You hesitated, slightly unsure of how that would change anything.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh right, forgot about that. How’d you manage to do that?”<br/>
</p><p>“Flitwick had a free block when I had mine last year and he helped me do more advanced work, and I got an O on my OWLs, so he just put me in this class.” You explained briefly, unsure of why you had explained yourself to him.<br/>
</p><p>About halfway through the lecture, a look of intense bewilderment spread across your face, confused with the notes on the board. Flitwick had glossed over a concept that apparently they had spent a large portion of the previous year working on. It was integral to learning and accurately performing the non-verbal water-making charm, a simple enough conceptual concept but difficult to master perfectly therefore only being taught in NEWT classes.<br/>
</p><p>You hadn’t even thought about it, before whispering to the twin, “What is the <i>sorgeva</i> concept?” You were so lost, that had you had a minute more to think about it you would’ve been too proud to ask, but your curiosity and confusion outweighed your pride.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s the main technique of non-verbal spells. Essentially, it’s the concept of knowing the result of the spell, and being able to hypothetically stand your ground to cast the spell.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah, okay.” Realization seeped in. “Thanks, I was lost.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah. It’s hard to understand the lesson without the concept.”<br/>
</p><p>“So, basically to master the non-verbal water-making charm you have to envision yourself saying <i>augamenti</i> and think about the effects of the charm?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, exactly.”<br/>
</p><p>Your proud smile returned for exactly a moment.<br/>
</p><p>It seemed as if your brief chittering whispers had been heard, Flitwick standing at the front of the room, silent, with a disappointed look on his face.<br/>
</p><p>“Anything to share with the class you two? (l/n)? Weasley?” He questioned, and you immediately looked away feeling unfairly punished but also embarrassed that you had been caught, and more so that you had disappointed Flitwick.<br/>
</p><p>When you both remained silent, you couldn’t look Flitwick in the eye, staring at the desk in front of you instead, he began again. “No? Then, detention for both of you. Please stay after for a few moments.”<br/>
</p><p>Well it was official, you were gonna die.<br/>
</p><p>You spent the remainder of class copying the notes as if in a daze, not being able to fully understand them, the feeling of embarrassment causing your body to warm up leaving you feeling uncomfortable. You wanted to squirm in your seat, but didn’t think you could deal with drawing more attention to yourself.<br/>
</p><p>You had turned away from the twin, whom you were pretty sure was Fred, one because of the way he carried himself; slightly more confident and boisterous than you had imagined either one to be, and two, because he had written Fred on the top of the paper.<br/>
</p><p>You sighed in relief as the class ended, feeling relief as your peers left the classroom, leaving you to wait anxiously in front of the classroom, waiting for the shitty feeling of guilt you would feel.<br/>
</p><p>“Weasley, do we really have to have this conversation again?” Flitwick asked, slightly exasperated but the look of exhaustion seeping into his features.<br/>
Fred didn’t seem to take it seriously, a non-apologetic smile on his face. “No, Professor.”<br/>
</p><p>Flitwick didn’t seem to care, turning towards you, his expression reflecting the disappointment you felt in yourself. “I expected better of you, (y/n).”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m really sorry, Professor.” You apologized. “I asked him about the <i>sorgeva</i> concept because I didn’t want to derail the lesson.” You explained, quickly and rather meekly.<br/>
</p><p>He sighed, removing his glasses briefly, before putting them back on, looking between the two of you. “I’m sorry we didn’t cover that concept enough last year, and while I understand it now, unfortunately I have to make an example of the two of you. Seventh years often tend to care less about the rules, but because we’re learning much more difficult concepts that require full attention, I need the students to understand the consequences still exist. Does that make sense?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes.” Both you and Fred said, surprising you by how the twin could be so understanding.<br/>
</p><p>“I just need you both to grade papers for a half hour after classes end, is that alright?”<br/>
</p><p>You both nodded, before walking out of the room heading towards the last class before lunch.</p>
