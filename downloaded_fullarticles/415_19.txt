          <div class="userstuff"><p>"We received another wedding invitation, Poppy," Rolanda Hooch announced after thanking the owl and sending it on its way.</p>
<p>The Hogwarts mediwitch didn't look up from the word puzzle she was doing. "Oh? Who is it for this time?"</p>
<p>"Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood," Rolanda replied after opening the invitation.</p>
<p>Poppy looked up, blinking. "Ginny and Luna? They're good girls. Better than some other patients I could name."</p>
<p>"I have <i>no</i> idea who you're talking about," Rolanda retorted blithely, picking up her scone and taking a bite.</p>
<p>Poppy covered Rolanda's hand with hers. "Do <i>you</i> want to get married, Ro?"</p>
<p>"I'm happy with you, Poppy." Rolanda turned her hand over to clasp Poppy's firmly. "I don't need a ceremony to prove it."</p>
<p>Scooting her chair around the table so she could wrap her arm around Rolanda's shoulders, Poppy said, "It wasn't a good idea when we first became lovers, but the world has changed since then. Now people like Ginny and Luna--" she paused and kissed Rolanda's cheek, smiling fondly "--or us can get married."</p>
<p>Rolanda sat quietly for several moments, just leaning into Poppy's embrace. Finally, she gave a deep sigh. "I... yes, I <i>would</i> like for us to get married. Do <i>you</i> want it too, Poppy?"</p>
<p>"I do, Ro." Smiling brightly, Poppy kissed Rolanda softly.</p>
<p>Cupping Poppy's cheek, Rolanda told her with a tender smile, "Then I guess we're getting married."</p>
<p>"I guess so." Poppy smiled back, her eyes suspiciously bright.</p>
<p>Kissing her softly, Rolanda added, "I love you, Poppy."</p>
<p>"I love you, too, Ro."</p></div>
