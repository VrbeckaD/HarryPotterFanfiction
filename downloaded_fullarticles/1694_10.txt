    <p>The atmosphere of the room was immediately noted to be tense when Remus stepped out of the fireplace. He’d had to make multiple stops on his trip back from Eastern Europe and added more on to further obscure his final destination. Stomach roiling as he’d never been the happiest with the Floo network in the first place, Remus contemplated sneaking up the stairs and presenting himself later.  Molly’s raised voice could be heard, with murmuring behind it, before Sirius erupted with a “Bloody hell!”</p><p>Remus sighed. The Weasleys had moved into 12 Grimmauld Place only a week ago, but tensions were already running high between Molly and Sirius. If it wasn’t over the “state of the place,” which Molly repeatedly used while glancing testily at Remus and Sirius, it was monologuing on why grown men shouldn’t tell children stories. Given Sirius and Remus had opened the place up only a month before, Remus was a tad resentful over the commentary on their house cleaning. He could hold his tongue though. Sirius was an entirely different story, edgy and angry, throwing himself from one room to another; Grimmauld made his skin crawl, that’s what he’d been saying for weeks.</p><p>“They are not children, Molly, whether or not you like it.”</p><p>“Of course they are,” Molly snapped angrily. “What else would they be but children? And how on earth you think they are supposed to cope with a war, when they should be enjoying themselves! They don’t need to know things, like what You-Know-Who is doing!”</p><p>“Considering Harry gets a live preview through his scar, and likely tells Ron and Hermione, I doubt we are telling them things they don’t know,” Sirius retorted, his voice lowering. Remus could see the shadow of sadness passing over his face as he stepped into the room. Sirius and Molly were facing each other, a basket of laundry laying forgotten at her feet. Nearby stood Arthur Weasley, looking resigned, while Minerva McGonagall sat in one of the armchairs, her lips pressed together.  He guessed he’d walked into the beginning or end of an Order meeting. Checking his watch, he surmised beginning.</p><p>“And that’s another thing,” Molly said, throwing her arm in the air. “Why on earth are you discussing these things with him, instead of telling him to close his mind? He’s seen enough horrors, and you just won’t let him move on!”</p><p>“He can’t move on, Molly, can’t you see that? He’s part of this,” Sirius replied. His face grew frustrated. “You can’t just coddle him and tell him it’s going to be okay. He’s not a child.”</p><p>“Yes he is,” Molly shouted, obviously frustrated. Arthur stood and laid a hand on Molly’s arm. “Now let’s all calm down, we all want to do the best thing for Harry, and for all of our children.”</p><p>“Yes, <em> we </em> do,” emphasized Molly scathingly. “Sirius seems to think he has his best friend back.”</p><p>“I do,” Sirius replied coldly. “I’ve turned out to not be a murdering pure-blood lunatic, so Remus has welcomed me back with open arms.”</p><p>At the mention of his name, Remus stepped further into the room. “You’re still a lunatic, Pads,” he said softly, trying to defuse the situation.</p><p>Sirius turned to him, as his face lit into a smile. “Moony, you’re back! How was the trip? Let’s get some tea into you.” Sirius had reached Remus at this time, and pulled him into a hug. For a moment, Remus could only hear the snuffle of Sirius’s breathing against his neck, and felt something safe and warm lodge into him.</p><p>“I’m famished actually,” Remus replied, and allowed Sirius to lead him from the room.  They were stopped my Molly’s shrill voice.</p><p>“I’ll have your word, Sirius.”</p><p>They turned in unison. Molly was standing with her arms folded under her ample chest. “Your word, Sirius,” she said, her eyes brimming with furious tears. Arthur sighed next to her.</p><p>“You have my word not to tell your underage children anything of import, Molly.” Sirius’s voice was mechanical and heavy. He was in the process of turning away, when Molly called, “That includes Harry and Hermione.”</p><p>Sirius whirled around. “No, it does not. Hermione can discuss war with <em> her </em> parents as she chooses, and as Harry’s godfather, I think it appropriate to discuss with him.”</p><p>“No, you will not! Harry’s just a boy Sirius, can’t you see that?  Remus, talk some sense into him.” At Remus’s closed face, she abruptly changed tactics. “You will not, Sirius, or I will go to Dumbledore.“ </p><p>“And what will that do? I am still his guardian!”</p><p>“No you aren’t! Just being a godfather doesn’t give you any parental rights!” </p><p>“Just being his best friend’s mother doesn’t either!”</p><p>“I’ve done more for him than you have, been unavailable haven’t you?”</p><p>There’s a sharp silence after that statement, and even Molly seems shocked by her words. Remus feels an anger growing in him, nearly bubbling to the surface. Minerva was standing, an observer until this point.</p><p>“That is not what you meant, is it Molly?” Arthur’s voice, usually so pleasant, had a steel undertone to it.</p><p>“No, of course not,” Molly whispered. “Sirius, I—“</p><p>“Oh you’ve voiced it before, if not so directly,” Sirius forced jovially. “It is true, being locked in Azkaban does make you a poor guardian. It doesn’t change the fact that I <em> am </em>his legal guardian, and the one his parents chose.” </p><p>Arthur’s face looks surprised after this. “Sirius,” he says quietly. “His aunt and uncle are his guardians, both under Muggle and Wizarding law. There was no will.”</p><p>“Of course they had a will,” Remus says, entering the fray. “Lily was one of the most organized women on the planet. They had a will complete the day Harry was born. It was updated once-,” he interrupted himself. “Once they knew Voldemort was after them.”</p><p>“The papers all reported otherwise, it’s why The Boy Who Lived went to his Muggle relatives,” Arthur’s voice was patient, like that explaining something to a small child.</p><p>“I was a witness,” Remus replied angrily. “I signed the damn paper myself. Sirius was guardian, and if not him, then,” his voice caught, “Peter. Lily joked that the world would be horrified to know she was leaving her child to a bunch of Marauders.”</p><p>“And James said that Harry was already Marauder, and could only be properly be raised by one,” Sirius said smiling.  “Ha, do you remember how he was trying to get Harry to say Marauders?”</p><p>“Or to get him to stop calling him “Pwog” instead of dad,” Remus said. He could still see Harry, gripping James’s face yelling “Pwogs!” at the top of his lungs while Lily laughed so hard she cried.  Turning back towards the Weasleys, he shrugged his shoulders. “I always knew no one would let a werewolf adopt a boy, and even more so after Harry became famous. There was no one else, so I thought that’s why he went to the Muggles.”</p><p>There’s a dead silence in the room. Minerva laughed then, a short chuckle. “Well that makes me feel better.” At everyone’s confused looks, she explained, “Harry’s permission slip for Hogsmeade. Sirius signed it.” Still everyone looked confused. “I’d charmed the slips myself, so that only a true parent or guardian could sign them. Did it with all official documentation, so that some of our more <em> exceptional </em> students,” and here she paused and gave the Weasleys a significant look, “couldn’t sign slips that were meant for parents. I’d already decided to just let Potter go to Hogsmeade the next year as head of house when the parchment came in. I was surprised, but let it go. Seems the parchment knew more than me.”</p><p>“So you are Harry’s guardian,” Arthur said slowly.</p><p>“Yes,” Sirius replied. “I’m Harry’s legal guardian, Azkaban escapee or not.  Both in the wizard and Muggle worlds. Lily made sure of that. And he’s my legal heir, including this ramshackle piece of shi-,“ his voice cut off at the quelling look from McGonagall. “I-uh-I  had already changed and updated my will, to include him, before I was sent off, but I updated it again this summer. A little gold will go a long way,” he added at Molly’s surprised look.</p><p>“I take it Albus knows these things,” Minerva said finally, something flashing in her eyes.</p><p>“I’m still under the assumption that Dumbledore knows everything,” Sirius replied dryly. He ran a hand through his hair, pushing it out of his eyes before turning. He turned again to Molly. “As I said before Molly, I don’t agree with your views on information. And while I will ask Harry to not discuss details with your children, in all reality, I doubt they will not know anything I tell him within hours if not minutes. “</p><p>“We appreciate you trying, Sirius.” Arthur said, his hand still resting on Molly’s arm. Molly nodded rigidly. She opened her mouth, then closed it. Remus could see Arthur’s grip tightening on her arm. “I just want them to have a childhood,” she said finally.</p><p>Remus smiled at Molly, his anger beginning to dissipateing. “In all reality Molly, I think that ship has sailed.”</p><p>“Ship has sailed,” Arthur asked interested. “Is that a Muggle saying?” </p><p>“Yes,” Remus laughed.  “It means that option has long since passed.” Sobering, he shot a glance at Sirius. “We had to grow up too quickly out of Hogwarts. I hope this generation will have time to be a kid when this war is over.”</p><p>There was a moment of contemplative silence, and Remus was surprised when he heard McGonagall give a sniff.</p><p>She gave a choked laugh. “I just remember you boys as first years. <em> All </em>of you boys,” she emphasized. “I hate to think how old I am, if you sound that aged Mr. Lupin.”</p><p>Sirius laughed. “Dearest Minnie,” he smiled cutting off her retort. “Do not fear. I will always be young at heart, and capable of a dung bomb at unexpected moments.”</p><p>“Ever unadvisable,” Remus inserted, laughing lightly.</p><p>“You always were the brains to the operation,” Sirius replied.</p><p>McGonagall laughed, and turned to the Weasleys. “Your Fred and George give this gang a run for their money. I’m regularly grateful they don’t have their own Lupin to perfect their schemes.”</p><p>Molly gave a large sigh. “I tell and I tell those two to keep it in line,” she started.</p><p>“They’re great kids, Molly.” Remus said, cutting her off. “Very bright, and always willing to help. Not a cruel bone in either of their bodies. They were obviously raised to care about other people.”</p><p>Molly blushed at the compliment. “Thank you, Remus.” Arthur beamed next to him. There’s a sense of camaraderie as they troop down the stairs, Molly trilling about tea, Minerva agreeing. There will be another meeting tonight, more arguments about how to best interpret the scant information they have. Sirius’s hand slid into Remus’s, their fingers intertwining. A sense of peace washed over him, just for a moment, before Molly’s squawking about “the state of this kitchen,” shattered the content. Remus felt Sirius stiffen before his hand pulled away, and Remus could only sigh.</p><p> </p><p align="center"> </p><p>Remus felt Sirius’s exhaustion as they climbed into bed that night, sliding under the sheets of his childhood bed. They were sharing a room under the pretense of the difficulty of cleaning the others, but the way Arthur nodded calmly, and tightened his grip on Molly’s arm, it was obvious they knew.</p><p>“Think Molly’s having a fit about our “unnaturalness” downstairs,” Sirius asked as he flopped backwards, his hair flying out around him.</p><p>Remus huffed a laugh, settling in more delicately, his face rubbing against the silk of the sheets. Green they may be, and probably charmed with some sort of Dark Magic, but these were the softest sheets he’d felt in years. “I’m sure Arthur’s talked her down.”</p><p>Sirius growled. “Doesn’t change that she’s yelling ‘Fag’ in her head loud as she can.” </p><p>“And she can continue to do that, Padfoot.” Remus let his foot slide against Sirius’, and he immediately stretched, with his wide extravagant movements to look at Remus. </p><p>Sirius’s face was placid, but his eyes sparkled with mischief. “Really Moony, no grand lecture, no scheme. Just a shag?”</p><p>Remus let a little puff of laughter. “I wish it was a shag,” he replied, letting tiredness slip into his voice. “But I--” he stopped himself, looking helplessly at Sirius, feeling a burning sensation in his chest. Sirius was staring at him, a slight curve of a smile on his face, his eyes surprisingly unshadowed. “I’m happy to be home,” he finally whispered, still so uncomfortable with intimacy. </p><p>“Oh, Moony.” It was a voice that Remus has barely ever heard, and he’d thought disappeared in Azkaban. Sirius pulled him closer, snuffling into his neck. They held one another for a few moments, then he murmured, “It’s good to have you.” </p><p>Sirius’s steady heartbeat pulsed beneath Remus’s fingers, and he could feel his own start to sync slowly. He knew this sound, the thwap of a valve opening, blood flowing through, the way it settled as Sirius’s breath slowed. There was a sense of peace in those two valves (or is it four? His foray into Muggle medicine was short-lived.) “Sirius,” he whispered, before he could stop himself. “Does a heart have two valves or four?”</p><p>“Four,” Sirius gruffed out, his breath little puffs on Remus’s temple. “Why?”</p><p>“Counting,” Remus said quietly. He knew not to ask Sirius questions, to stretch the limits of his tired mind. Sirius had once seemed to know everything about anything, though he never seemed to use it for anything other than a nefarious purpose. The habit of just asking slipped back to Remus so quickly after a once clean-shaven, and simply clean Sirius reemerged, only to be reminded that while his outside could be scrubbed, his mind was still filled with sudden potholes and quicksand. Remus was relearning Sirius, this Sirius, and it was even harder than learning to live life without him.  </p><p>Sirius was pulling away slightly, and Remus tensed for the inevitable swell of fury, of frustration at life, and possibly at him. But instead, Sirius slid one hand next to Remus’s and began to count. “1,2-3 4. 1 2 -3 4,” alongside his own heart beat, tapping it out lightly with his index finger, his other hand splayed along Remus’s upper back. Remus knew this had happened before, could feel a sense of deja vu, but couldn’t place it clearly. He wanted so desperately to hold on to the moment, but exhaustion and Sirius’s low voice were combining, and he finally succumbed.<br/> </p><p> </p><p>The light in the room was low when Remus finally struggled to open his eyes. It was that pinkish-orange glow of an early summer morning, one that was crisp and clean before burning into a typical muggy summer day. Sirius was sitting up in bed next to him, wand in hand, carefully reading a book. His tongue was poking out of the right corner of his mouth, and his hair was tied into a top knot, a few stray strands hanging over. Remus surreptitiously tried to look at the book he was studying. </p><p>“Charms, Mooniekins,” Sirius said, before placing the book down. He shot a glare at Remus. “And do not start on how I leaned on Lily too much. Harry wouldn’t exist if I hadn’t made Lily tutor me.” </p><p>Remus laughed, and stretched his arms over his head. “Gah, watching her patiently explain timed Freezing Charms to you while James had a nervous breakdown was probably a highlight of 6th year.”</p><p>“Daft bugger was never going to ask her out, despite cleaning himself up. I had to do something.” The book was tossed toward Remus, and his eyes skimmed across “Charming Charms for the Everyday Man.”</p><p>“Really, Sirius,” he asked, sitting up and opening the book randomly. The charm listed showed cleaning a highball glass. “Thinking of throwing a party?”</p><p>“Of course! I’ll invite Molly and all the kids, get’em all liquored up. She’ll definitely take a shine to me then.” He flipped it a few pages back, showing a simple hair grooming spell. “It’s strange, but I can’t seem to remember how I did my hair. Or shaved for that matter. I think I had Black family charms on my clothes to keep them straight, and they were all stopped. I assume when darling mother passed.” A dark look passed across his eyes, and his lips curve down.</p><p>“That’s because you never did your hair, and I inevitably had to shave off whatever monstrosity you’d grown on your face,” Remus said dryly. He was rewarded with a smirk, and continued. “You thought the ‘rumpled’ look was a thing.”</p><p>“It was,” Sirius exclaimed, “and it still is.” He flipped to another page, where a sparkly wizard pointed at his perfectly combed locks, yelled “Musstifo” and his hair became casually tousled. “I <em> told </em> you this would become a thing. But I know I used another charm for that.” Sirius bit his lower lip, apparently wracking his brain for the charm while muttering under his breath. Remus flipped the cover back over, and noted how new it looked.</p><p>“How did you get this, Padfoot?” There was a note of anxiety in his voice. </p><p>“Owl-order,” Sirius replied absently</p><p>“With what money,” Remus asked, exasperated. Their pooled funds were poor, given they mainly came from his meager savings, and while he wouldn’t begrudge Sirius a book, they still had to be careful. </p><p>“Mine,” Sirius said. His wand was now pointing at his head, and with a quick flick, his hair ruffled, looking like he’d just stepped off his motorcycle. “I knew I knew it,” he shouted triumphantly, jumping out of bed and hurrying over to the mirror hanging over the bureau. </p><p>The early morning sunlight softened the lines of Sirius’s face. Combined with the genuine joy in his expression as he preened in the mirror, Sirius looked 22 again. Or, if not 22, then the way he should look in his 30s, sans Azkaban. Remus dubbed the look ‘sans-Azkaban’ in his head, then waved his arm to get Sirius’s attention. </p><p>“What money,” he asked again more firmly, “and what wand are you using?”</p><p>“Oh, this is my great grandfather’s, found it mouldering in the attic.” Sirius gave it a little twirl, and flounced back into the bed. Remus rolled his eyes. “Doesn’t work perfectly, but Kingsley said mine is somewhere in the bowels of the ministry. He’s been trying to look for it, says he’ll snatch it for me.”</p><p>“And money,” Remus said patiently. </p><p>“Oh, well, goblins don’t follow wizarding law, just old blood laws and, well, financial laws. The Black vaults have been blood warded for generations, and as long as I am alive, as the heir, only I can access them. Apparently Lucius Malfoy went sniffing around them after my mother died, tried to bleed his kid onto them. Though Harry says the kid’s a right prat, so maybe not a loss.”</p><p>“You opened your vaults,” Remus asked, his voice rising in pitch. “Padfoot, you could be caught. It could lead back here. Damnit, we need to hide you, I can’t - I can’t have you gone again.” A sheen of sweat immediately covered Remus’s face, and he felt his heart racing.</p><p>“Moony, calm down.” Sirius placed his palm on Remus’s cheek. “I know goblin laws, and I know goblin minds. There’s a lot of money in the Black vault, money that’s just been sitting. Without me, they can’t play with it. Not to mention James - no, <em> Harry’s </em> vaults.”</p><p>Remus stared at him blankly. His family had never been well-off and his knowledge of Gringotts was limited to exchanging small amounts of galleons for pounds, just to get him by. </p><p>“The UK branch of Gringotts trades with other international branches, they also invest on the Muggle exchanges and with other species. Readyally, galleons makes all that easier. The Black and Potter family vaults are both stuffed full. Plus I’d invested Uncle Alphard’s money carefully, and it’s grown quite well. When mother died, my vault and the family vault combined.”</p><p>“So they don’t care that you are a convict,” Remus surmised. “Because you are the sole controller of the Black fortune, even if you resided in Azkaban.”</p><p>“Precisely,” Sirius replied. “Plus as Harry’s guardian, I’m the executor of the Potter vault. Lily had forms filled with the Goblins in Geneva.” Sirius smiled at Remus. “Goblins are very particular, but very loyal to money.”</p><p>“You were all very thorough,” Remus said finally. “I had no idea.”</p><p>Sirius’s smile slipped. “You should have had access to everything Moony,” he said, gripping Remus’s hand. “The werewolf limitation laws were passed after I went to Azkaban, and they were specifically written for goblin compliance. I had no idea those would ever be passed. Never thought the Wizengamot would actually lower themselves to talk with a subspecies.” There’s a grimace on his face.</p><p>“You planned for Lily and James’s death.” Remus’s voice is barely above a whisper. </p><p>“I planned for everyone’s death, Remus,” Sirius exclaimed. “James, Lily, you. I wrote Caradoc’s will. Hell, I’d-I’d helped Peter.” His voice breaks at the end of that. They gripped each other’s hands tightly. “His mum got everything, right, including the flat’s contents?”</p><p>Remus nodded. “Helped get everything there myself, though she didn’t want to see me.”</p><p>There’s silence for a few moments. “Is she alive?” he asked finally.</p><p>“Yes,” Remus said. “As far as I know.” </p><p>“They were so attached, after Pete’s dad died.” It was the first time Sirius had ever said his name, not Peter or Wormtail, but Pete as he had been in their memories. There was a spasm in Sirius’s face. “I’m sure the contents of our flat were dumped in the trash heap.” His voice was low and angry, and his grip was now too tight.</p><p>“Packed up, actually. It’d been trashed, then bagged by the time I made it there.” Remus could still smell the angry magic that permeated their apartment, broken glass crunching under his feet as he made his way to their bedroom. He’d sat on the overturned bed, staring at a painting Evelyn Mansby had made as a housewarming gift. A huge gryffin, outspread wings, with rolling fields beneath. Evelyn was still alive as far as Remus knew, she’d kept in touch over the years with letters. The painting was wrapped in his parent’s home, something Remus couldn’t let go of. </p><p>Sirius had still said nothing, his hand still in Remus’s, but Remushe knew he was out of luck. Sirius calm for this many hours, talking about the past, was a near miracle, and the explosion was about to come. “I should write her,” he murmured as Sirius gave out a giant roar, and threw himself out of bed and out the door. He slipped a robe on, and trailed Sirius up the stairs as he threw things, small things, large things, shiny things, things that likely were full of Dark Magic. Remus waved his wand calmly, and cleaned with efficiency as Sirius raged.</p><p align="left"> </p>
