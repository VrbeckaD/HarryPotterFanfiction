          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry had gone to the Lord Roberts with Ron and Neville. </p>
<p>It was a seedy, dilapidated place, famed more for the cheap alcohol and sticky floors than the atmosphere but, tonight, it suited Harry perfectly. Harry craved the filth and the heartbreak of the place; craved the drunken Muggles singing off-key Karaoke and the weight of cheap beer in his belly. </p>
<p>He’d never felt as low as he had in the last few weeks. </p>
<p>Draco had left him, panicked by the strength of Harry’s adoration. Harry’s devotion had terrified Draco and he’d run away in a sparkle of floo smoke, stealing every happiness from Harry’s life. </p>
<p>So, when Draco took to the stage, Harry felt stunned. </p>
<p>“I’m here because I made a mistake,” Draco announced, scanning the crowd with wide, grey eyes. “I’m here because I was a coward. The man I’m going to sing for… Well, he played this everyday. I bet you thought I didn’t notice. But I did, Harry. I noticed everything about you.”</p>
<p>Harry watched, awe-struck, as Draco sang only for him. </p>
<p><em>Wuthering Heights</em>, by Kate Bush. The pure emotion in his voice; that wasn’t something Draco could fake. The wizard was word-perfect. Draco never one looked at the lyrics. Instead, he gazed at Harry as he sang, communicating raw need with every note. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Harry,” Draco whispered as the song ended. “I was wrong.”</p>
<p>~@~</p>
<p>Harry rushed his friends home before returning to Grimmauld. He didn’t need a <em>Lumos</em> to know that Draco was waiting for him; Harry could feel the subtle difference in the wards. </p>
<p>“Kate Bush? Really?” Harry asked, approaching Draco with a bemused smile. “I never knew you paid me that much attention, Draco.”</p>
<p>Draco looked up, his face meditative. “Of course. <em>How could you leave me when I needed to possess you? I hated you, I loved you too?</em> Those words could have been written about us-”</p>
<p>“They could,” Harry agreed, pulling Draco his arms. “But Cathy and Heathcliff were doomed never to be together.” With a careful hand, Harry cupped Draco’s jaw and tipped his head back. Moving close, their lips met for a heated kiss. </p>
<p>“And we deserve our happy ending, love,” Harry murmured.</p></div>
