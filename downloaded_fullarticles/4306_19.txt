He only had eyes for Draco.<br/> <br/>He wrapped his arms around his boyfriend. "Can you believe it?" he whispered in Draco's ear. "Just last year you gave me our first kiss."<br/> <br/>Draco nodded. "It's been a crazy year."<br/> <br/>"A good one, though," Harry retorted, tightening his grip. "I wouldn't change it for anything."<br/> <br/>"Me either," Draco said firmly. He stared into Harry's green eyes.<br/> <br/>"Three, two, one…"<br/> <br/>"Happy new year," Draco said, crashing his lips into Harry's. Harry returned the kiss with equal vigour, savouring every sensation.</p></div>
