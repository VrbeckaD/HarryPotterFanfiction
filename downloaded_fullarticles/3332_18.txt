    <p> </p><p>Harry is, for all intents and purposes, an unassuming looking wizard. Slight of build and of average height, if you’d seen him from behind you’d never have known that this was the boy who’d marched to his death for the people he loved.</p><p>But if he turned, and you met his eyes–</p><p>Hermione knows that even if someone obliviates her, spins her around, and apparates her to another continent entirely; even if ten years pass by and she never touches magic again, she could never forget the green of Harry’s eyes.</p><p>She knows the sheen of them when he holds back tears; she’s seen them darken in anger and determination; she knows the color of them in sun and in shade; she could pick out Harry from a hundred other people by that green alone.</p><p>Hermione’s had the privilege—<em>the pleasure</em>—of learning every one of Harry’s looks, but here, now, standing on a Muggle street corner in the heart of London, she finds she doesn’t recognize this new combination: the pupils blown so wide that only a ring of myrtle green is left; the mad glint that promises he’s decided something and no man or god could change his mind; the tilt to his head as he stares down at her mouth.</p><p>Just before he dips his head, Hermione realizes that she’ll have a whole new world of expressions and looks and shades of green to explore before her. And if Harry’s eyes and heart and soul are what makes him extraordinary, well, Hermione’s mind has always been something to behold.</p><p> </p>
