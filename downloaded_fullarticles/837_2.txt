          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Are we broken up?"  </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto">
  <p>Harry watched as Hermione looked up from her book for what must've been the seventh time. She leveled an exasperated look at him- one that was normally saved for Ron's most tactless moments. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"What?" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Harry shifted, painfully aware of his warm face. "Me and Ron." </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Hermione rolled her eyes and looked back down at her book. "Harry, this is just a spat. Everything will be fine soon. You know that he-" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She paused and Harry frowned. "I know that he what?" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She gave him a quick, nervous glance, like she almost just let something slip, before looking away again. "Uh, nothing. Nothing." Harry opened his mouth to question her again but she continued speaking. "Besides, I think you should be more focused on the task."</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Harry pouted, drooping slightly. He was trying <em>not </em>to think about the task. Actually, he was trying not to think about the task and not think about Ron's face every time they saw each other in class or how it felt when Ron would deliberately sit with Dean instead of him.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"I miss him Hermione." He admitted. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Hermione, unsurprisingly, simply rolled her eyes. "You boys are absolutely ridiculous. If you miss him so much, just <em>talk </em>to him!" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"He doesn't much want to talk to me, now does he!" Harry snapped. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Hermione frowned and Harry winced. "I'm sorry 'Mione, but he's just- he's just so <em>frustrating!" </em></p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She nodded, reaching for Harry's hand. "I know Harry, I <em>am </em>dating him after all." Harry stuck his tongue out at her and she laughed lightly before sobering. "Just know this, he does care about you. He couldn't not." </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Double negative." Harry pointed out, causing Hermione to smile. "And anyway, he's got a funny way of showing it doesn't he?" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Well, so do you." She raised an eyebrow at him. "I hear you've gone and thrown a button at him?" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Harry nods. "I <em>did. </em>I figured he'd want one." </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She shakes her head, her black hair going all over. "That wasn't smart." She chided. "You know he hates those things." </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Actually. I don't." </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She paused. "Oh. Well. He doesn't like them." </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"That's a great comfort. Thanks." </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Don't get all worked up now, you were just about to cry a second ago." </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Harry balked. "Was not!" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Were too!" Hermione grinned. "Your eyes were 'glimmering with the ghosts of your past!'" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Harry snorted and Hermione followed suit and for a brief second, the worry over his standing with Ron and the anxiety over the daunting first task faded. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>...</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Harry was getting a bit tired of almost dying. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>He'd tried looking on the bright side- you know, at least the danger was always varied; he'd never gone up against a <em>dragon</em> before- but still. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>He was still sort of shaking in the med tent after Pomfrey tended to his wounds and it was purely due to nerves. He kinda wanted to take a spin on his Firebolt except this time, it'd be without the addition of the Horntail. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>He stood to go, ignoring his shaking legs and two people hurried into the tent. Hermione, with red eyes and flushed cheeks and Ron, looking deathly pale and a bit ashamed. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Harry!" She immediately threw herself at him and he only just got himself together enough to hold them both steady. "You were amazing! The spell- oh, you were absolutely brilliant!" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She pressed a kiss to his chin but Harry's eyes were on Ron, who was watching him with what seemed to be a pained expression. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Hermione-" Ron's voice was hoarse and Harry sort of wanted to cry at the sound of it. He <em>missed </em>him. "-watch his shoulder, he's hurt! Are you okay, Harry?" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Hermione moved back quickly with a squeaky- "Oh!" and Harry swayed slightly. Almost instantly, Ron was there, placing gentle, large hands on Harry's uninjured arm. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Y-you alright mate?" Ron asked, his blue eyes searching Harry's face for even a stitch of discomfort. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Harry blinked rapidly. Was he alright? <em>No. </em>No, he wasn't. He couldn't be. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p> Not when he was just almost eaten by a dragon. Not when Hermione was watching the two of them with tearfully wide eyes. Not when Ron was so close and yet so <em>far away.</em> </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Ron must've taken Harry's stunned silence as anger because he stepped back, ducking his head. Harry unconsciously swayed towards him, but it had less to do with the lack of balance and more to do with the lack of <em>Ron. </em></p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Harry, I- I was stupid. I should've realized. You never would've put your name in that goblet." Ron's eyes grew hard. "I reckon someone here is trying to do you in and-" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"What's new?" Harry cut in impulsively. He didn't need the apology- he could see it in Ron's slumped shoulders, in his downcast expression, in the way he refused to fully meet Harry's gaze. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Ron nodded, taking a step back, obviously taking Harry's remark as some sort of dismissal when it was entirely the opposite. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Harry grabbed for Ron's hand. "It's fine. It's alright. Forget it." </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Ron frowned. He still took Harry's hand, their fingers lacing together like he couldn't help it. "No, I should-" </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Forget it." Harry stressed. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Ron paused, then grinned nervously and Harry grinned back before moving closer so he was in Ron's personal space. Harry let out a small sigh when he didn't move away. He let himself slump a bit onto Ron, who immediately supported him and curled a hand into his messy black hair. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Hermione made a noise from behind Harry and soon there were thin brown arms curling around his middle, hugging him from behind. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Oh, you two are so stupid!" She cried. Harry felt Ron move to reach for her and her sobs quieted. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Naw, just me." Ron chuckled. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Me too." Harry said into Ron's shoulder. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Not me." Hermione sniffled. "Maybe stupid for liking you two so much." </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>"Definitely." Ron and Harry said together and Harry allowed himself to relax in the arms of the people he trusted most. Whatever was to come, he'd be fine. He <em>would. </em></p>
