  <strong>---</strong>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">When Percy woke up this morning, it was to half a dozen missed calls and a good hundred text messages sent by his parents and, for some reasons, some of his friends. Him having to answer to a lot of people first thing in the morning was not exceedingly rare, in fact, it was part of his job, as Private Secretary<b> </b>to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to always be in contact with everyone in his department and outside of it. However, he did most of it on his work phone.</p><p align="left">Considering this, he was understandably confused when, half-way through writing a polite reply to a random text he had gotten, he realised that he was holding his personal phone and that the person he was texting to was his mother, and not some annoying MP, like he had originally thought. It took several seconds of blearily blinking at his phone, which was still intermitently buzzing with each new texts he was recieving, to figure out that something was not quite right, and that he probably should start worrying it about it.</p><p align="left">God, couldn't this have waited until he had had his coffee?</p><p align="left">Wearily, he dragged himself out of his bed and made his way towards his kitchen, full set on making himself a triple-shot of espresso to get him through the wall of texts he was just starting to read through. According to what his parents and older brother sent him, something had happened during the night, something that was, apparently, so important that they <em>absolutely</em> had to contact him as soon as they learned about it, no matter that it was his first day of vacation since he landed his job under the Minister.</p><p align="left">But then, considering the fact that he barely saw his family nowadays, it was very likely that they didn't even know that he had the day off. They didn't talk that often.</p><p align="left">
  <strong>&gt; Mum (7:11) Good morning, what's wrong? Everyone's been texting me.</strong>
</p><p align="left">He sent the text to a few of the people that had contacted him during the night, noting distantly that, when he pressed the button to text Cedric, a sound chimed in the man's room, which meant that he had decided to end his bar-crawl by coming back home. Since he had texted him until quite late in the night, Percy decided not to wake him up. They had only been flatmates for a few weeks, better not ruin their relationship so soon.</p><p align="left">After finishing his first cup and utterly failing to wake himself up (he had stayed up reading until one am the night before, intending to sleep late the next morning), he made himself a new one, answering a few work-related messages while it brewed.</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Mum (7:25) Percy!</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Mum (7:26) Good morning, how are you feeling darling?</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>&gt; Mum (7:30) I'm fine. Thank you for asking.</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>&gt; Mum (7:31) Why did you text me?</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Mum (7:35) Oh, you haven't heard about it yet?</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>&gt; Mum (7:36) About what?</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Mum (7:40) Here : <em>www.thesun.co.uk/news/9078674/oliver-wood-soulmark-revealed/</em></strong>
</p><p align="left">Cringing a bit at the fact that he had to read an article written by <em>The Sun</em>, of all newspapers, Percy nonetheless clicked on it, finishing the rest of his espresso. When the page loaded, he was treated to a large picture featuring a nice set of abs and a flashing headline that said :</p><p align="center">
  <strong>[BREAKING NEWS:] Oliver Wood's soulmark revealed!</strong>
</p><p align="left">The shots having worked his way to his brain by now, he didn't have any trouble recognising the large ink owl that was spread out on the man's chest. After all, it was the exact same one he himself bore, in the exact same place. The two marks were perfectly identical, down to the smallest feather and, in the world they lived in, it could only mean one thing.</p><p align="left">Oliver Wood was his soulmate.</p><p align="left">Upon realising this, the first thing Percy thought was '<em>Fuck</em>', because having a soulmate and being in politics was a double-edged sword and one he would have gladly avoided wielding. On one hand, it made you much more popular in the eyes of the public and him, being the youngest MP in Parliament, needed as much popular support he could get, but, on the other hand, it made you much more vulnerable.</p><p align="left">And, of course, since he was just 21, he was already quite vulnerable, than you very much.</p><p align="left">The second thing he thought of, however, was less calculating and a bit more genuine. It was, quite simply : <em>'Who even is Oliver Wood?'</em></p><p align="left">Because Percy, who had never opened a tabloid before in his life (except once when he was sick and it was the only thing available at the doctor's office), did not know anything about celebrities, at least when they were not of the political sort. He could only name a few popular singers and knew the faces of barely a dozen or so actors. As much as his friends tried to make him spend time with them, he did not go to the movies often, nor did he listen to much music.</p><p align="left">Now a bit curious despite himself, because it was <em>his soulmate</em> he was thinking about, he typed the man's name online and, once the twenty or so articles that had popped up during the night about him accidentally revealing his soulmark at a party (<em>and how stupid was that?</em>) were passed he found his Wikipedia page. The fact that his soulmate had one was not that impressive, of course. Every B-list celebrity had a Wikipedia page, hell, even <em>he</em> had one. And Fred and George too. And Ron's mate Harry. Wikipedia pages seemed to be a norm around him, rather than an exception.</p><p align="left">
  <strong>  Oliver Wood</strong>
</p><p align="left">  Oliver Wood (born 23 November 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays as goalkeeper both for English club <strong>Manchester United</strong> and for the <strong>England national team</strong>. At   21 years old, he is already considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world (he won the <strong>IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper</strong> award in 2017) and is considered one of the main driving   force behind the England national team return to power.</p><p align="left">  Despite his age, Wood is suspected to be next in line to become captain of the national team, due to his recognised ability to strategise and command his teammates during games.      In January 2018, he was named "Best Young Player in the World" by the Guardian and has been internationally praised for his talent.</p><p align="left"><strong>  Contents</strong> [Hide]</p><p align="left">

</p><p align="left">Alright.</p><p align="left">So.</p><p align="left">His soulmate was a professional football player, and a famous one at that.</p><p align="left">Well, his siblings were going to be delighted once they heard about it. Which at least some of them had, going by the texts Charlie and Bill had sent him earlier this morning. Thankfully, he had not flaunted his mark around the younger members of the family so, with a bit of luck, maybe Ron and Ginny wouldn't remember what it looked like or make the connection with Wood's. They would be unsuferrable if they learned that he shared a mark with a football player.</p><p align="left">With a bit of annoyance, he noticed that, when he scrolled down to reach the "Personal Life" part of the page, a picture of Wood's soulmark had already been included, it being considerably more blurry than it had been in the Sun's article. He stared blankly at the six-pack for a moment, thanking the lord that at least <em>something</em> was appealing about his soulmate, then turned back to his text app, in which his mother had been harassing him with questions and exclamation marks for the past twenty minutes.</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Mum (7:55) He's quite handsome, isn't he?</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Mum (7:58) I can't wait to meet him!</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Mum (7:59) He looks like such a polite boy</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Mum (8:02) Did you know that he used to live in Scotland? :D</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>&gt; Mum (8:05) No. Is that important?</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Mum (8:08) Of course! Scotland is beautiful! Fred and George took me here last summer! :)</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>&gt; Mum (8:10) How are they doing anyways?</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Mum (8:15) Oh no darling, this isn't about your brothers, this is about you! I can't wait to tell your siblings.</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>&gt; Mum (8:19) Bill and Charlie already know</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Mum (8:24) That's too bad :( but Ginny and Ron will be delighted :P</strong>
</p><p align="left">At the reminder that his younger brother and sister would soon be made aware of his situation, Percy groaned loudly and burried his face in his arms. This was supposed to be his day off, he had planned to spend it reading and watching stupid romance shows, not dealing with his siblings and their collective madness. Or with his soulmate for that matter. Why did he have to flash his abs anyways? It's not like his soulmark was in a very obvious place, like his wrists or his face, he could just have kept his shirt on and things would have been much better.</p><p align="left">"I want to die." He whispered, head still on the wooden table.</p><p align="left">The sentiment was one he was used to having, as dealing with the other MPs often woke up his latent murderous tendencies, as well as his depressive ones, but this time it was much, <em>much</em> worse. Because while MPs were only a temporary part of his life, his soulmate was here to stay, or at least he was supposed to, according to everything he had been taught since middle school.</p><p align="left">Why did it have to be a footballer? Why couldn't it have been an accountant, a teacher or someone with a semi-respectable job? Footballers were crazy, footballers were...</p><p align="left">They were kind of hot.</p><p align="left">His soulmate was kind of hot.</p><p align="left">Kind of very, very hot.</p><p align="left">Flushing despite himself, he couldn't help but remember the picture of the man's chest. The guy was clearly fit, which was expected of a professional athlete, the kind of thing you only saw in movies or in magazines. In all of his life, Percy had never dreamed of being with someone who looked like this when he himself was one of the least seductive persons he knew, and that included the crusty MPs of the House of Commons.</p><p align="left">Wood was probably used to top models throwing himself at him, what was he going to do with a guy like <em>Percy</em>?</p><p align="left">Bloody hell, this was such a mess.</p><p align="left">Noticing that he was still in his pajamas, he hesitated before going back in his room to get dressed. The thought on wallowing on the couch in his sweatpants and large shirt was tempting for a while but he had to regain some form of dignity, even if it was only in the form of chinos and a sweater. He needed to feel a bit like this was a normal day and not the beginning of a long, painful ordeal.</p><p align="left">He caught a glimpse of his soulmark as he undressed and it made him wince.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">---</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">

Honestly, the one I feel bad for is his soulmate, they're going to have to deal with this shitstorm too, and they didn't ask for it. The one really at fault here is Wood, not the people talking about the situation. When you're in a position like his, you should be careful about what you do, especially if it can impact your soulmate's life like this did.</p><p align="left">
