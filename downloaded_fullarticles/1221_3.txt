    <p>"It's the World Cup!" Ron cheered for the trillionth time that morning. "It's the World Cup!"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes Ronald," Hermione laughed. "We've gathered as much."</p><p> </p><p>"You just don't understand because you're a girl," he said, earning himself a thwack on the head from his father.</p><p> </p><p>"I taught you better than that," Arthur frowned.</p><p> </p><p>Fred and George hid their snickers. Bill and Charlie, did not.</p><p> </p><p>"It's the World Cup!" Ginny cheered, running down the steps to join them.</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughed, shaking his head.</p><p> </p><p>"Now, everyone, this is going to be a very hectic scene," Arthur said over his children. "We need you all to work together to make sure everyone stays together at all times." He gave a pointed look at Harry here, and everyone nodded.</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt himself blush under everyone's glance. He didn't know why it was more important that he was safe than all the others anyway.</p><p> </p><p>"Now Harry," Arthur continued. "You are to never leave Remus' side, is that understood?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes Sir," Harry nodded, still blushing.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't like being babied, but at least if he had to be chaperoned it was with Remus.</p><p> </p><p>They had been close ever since they'd met the year before. He always told him stories about his parents, and not just the exciting, trouble making stories that Sirius told. He would tell him things like the way his mother had been sick for most of his pregnancy, or that his father had made up songs every day to cheer her up.</p><p> </p><p>Remus had told him that because Harry had been born with a Werewolf in his close group of friends, that he would always be more welcomed by werewolves then others. "It's something to do with scent marking," he'd explained.</p><p> </p><p>"We're not expecting anything to go wrong," Arthur said, giving Molly a reassuring look, "But we need to be ready."</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The match had been thrilling and the crowds had been endless. When the Dark Mark graced the sky and the energy shifted to horror, and all the crowds turned to stampedes, Harry was truly scared. He didn't understand the fear. He'd never seen the mark before, and all he knew was that something wasn't right.</p><p> </p><p>They all ran. They were scattering. Harry tried to stay with them, but when he saw a woman lose her grasp on her young child's hand he'd pulled back to help. He swooped the child up to rest on his hip and pushed through the crowd to the sobbing mother.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you! Thank you!" she cried, pulling her child from him and disappearing again into the swarms.</p><p> </p><p>"Harry!" Remus gasped in relief, pulling him tight into his side. "We need to go!"</p><p> </p><p>Just then a group of twenty men in dark cloaks and silver masks appeared thirty feet before them. Their wands were drawn and they were throwing off offensive spells like candy at a parade.</p><p> </p><p>Harry saw the largest of the men grab a child from the crowd and start ripping at its flesh with his teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Horrified, Harry reached for his wand just as Remus was struck by a blast of red light. He was down. As Remus was struck unconscious Harry felt a sweep of magic fall from him. It was as if something had been un-cast upon him.</p><p> </p><p>The bloodied, child-eating, man's head jerked up and his eyes locked directly on him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry gasped, at the intensity of his stare. He felt his heart speed up. Harry fell to his knees and tried to shake Remus awake as the man moved closer.</p><p> </p><p>As the man was upon them Harry raised his wand and was immediately disarmed.</p><p> </p><p>The man knelt down beside him and removed his mask. His face dripped blood.</p><p> </p><p>Harry could feel himself choking to take in a breath. He fell back trying to push away from the man.</p><p> </p><p>“Hush now Little Pup,” the man said softly. Harry could barely hear him other the crowd and his own ragged breathing. “Come here,” he grinned, grasping Harry’s arm and pulling him closer, lifting Harry as if he were a ragdoll.</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt hot tears run down his face. He was sure he was about to be torn into by this beast of a man.</p><p> </p><p>The man pushed his nose into Harry’s neck and inhaled deeply. “It’s really you,” the man breathed, pulling back to grin madly at him. A fact that only made Harry cry harder, seeing his sharp teeth covered in blood.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Harry begged. “Please let me go.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be scared Little Pup,” he said, drawing Harry into his chest as he inhaled his scent again. The man stood and lifted Harry with him. Harry kicked and screamed, trying to free himself, but the man simply lifted him higher and tossed him over his shoulder as one might a sack of potatoes.</p><p> </p><p>“Remus!” Harry screamed. “Please! Help me!” he begged, still pounding his fists on the large man’s back.</p><p> </p><p>He felt the man carrying him falter, and growl. “Remus Lupin?” He turned back to spot the unconscious werewolf. “Notts!” he shouted, and another of the cloaked men appeared by his side. “Grab him,” he said, pointing to Remus. “I’m heading back.”</p><p> </p><p>And then there was a sharp jerking sensation at his navel. Harry gasped and clung to the man holding him.</p><p> </p><p>They landed, and Harry felt instantly sick. He was disorientated; having just traveled through space while dangling upside down over someone’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Here you are Sweet Thing,” the man leered, dumping him ungracefully onto a large bed.</p><p> </p><p>Harry quickly righted himself and pulled himself farther up the bed away from the man. He swiped at his tears and tried to calm his racing nerves.</p><p> </p><p>“Breathe easy, Puppy,” the man grinned. “I’m not going to hurt you,” he said, falling into a large armchair facing the bed.</p><p> </p><p>Harry jumped from the bed and ran to the door. Locked.</p><p> </p><p>He ran to the window. They were at least two floors up.</p><p> </p><p>The man didn’t try and stop him. He just watched him with excited eyes, tracking his every movement.</p><p> </p><p>Harry wondered if this was some sort of game for him.</p><p> </p><p>He tried the next door and found a closet.</p><p> </p><p>The final door was a bathroom. Harry closed himself in and locked the door.</p><p> </p><p>And still, the man did not stop him.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be scared Puppy,” the man called through the door, only making Harry more afraid.</p><p> </p><p>There wasn’t much in the way of furniture in the bathroom, but what Harry could find he pushed to the door to block the man’s entrance. Then he walked to the far corner and sank to the floor. He pulled his knees to his chest and cried again. He was trapped here with no signs of escape.</p><p> </p><p>He’d literally seen his captor eat another person, for Merlin's sake!</p><p> </p><p>He was stuck here, wandless, and no one in the world knew where he was.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Harry jerked awake as there was a knock on the bathroom door.</p><p> </p><p>He cursed himself for having gone to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you hungry Puppy?” the man asked kindly. “You don’t need to come out if you don’t want too. I can send in a house elf.”</p><p> </p><p>“A house elf,” Harry whispered. “Dobby!”</p><p> </p><p>No reply. Harry guessed that there was some sort of ward keeping out foreign magical creatures.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to come out now?” the man asked. “You’d be more comfortable out here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ha, as if,” Harry huffed.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re choice,” he shrugged as if responding. “Let me know when you get hungry.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s stomach growled.</p><p> </p><p>There was a chuckle outside the door. “I heard that Puppy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not a puppy,” Harry growled, under his breath.</p><p> </p><p>“You are definitely the Puppy,” the man answered.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s head snapped up. How had he heard him? Was he using some sort of sound enhancing spell to spy on him? Harry wondered if he was being watched too.</p><p> </p><p>“Leave me alone!” he snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine. Just ask for food and you can have it.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry stubbornly remained silent.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>By the next day, Harry felt like his stomach was eating itself.</p><p> </p><p>“Just ask, Puppy,” the man sighed, leaning against the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop calling me that!”</p><p> </p><p>“Why won’t you eat Little One?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t reply.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>After two more days, Harry was fading in and out of consciousness. He was so hungry he slept just to help ease the pain.</p><p> </p><p>“Silly thing,” he heard the man whisper, as he was being lifted off the floor of the bathroom. He tried to protest, but his limbs were too weak.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop,” Harry whispered hoarsely.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s time to stop playing these games Puppy,” the man sighed, sitting down with Harry across his lap. “Daddy will take care of his baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t understand, but as a chunk of meat was pressed to his lips he didn’t really care. He opened his mouth and allowed himself to be fed.</p><p> </p><p>Every few bites the man would ruffle Harry’s hair, or lean down to kiss at Harry’s crown. “There’s my good boy.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry would try to pull away, but the temptation of more food was too rewarding. As he regained his strength he started to sit up more fully, pulling away from where he’d been leaned on the man’s broad chest.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want?” Harry asked suddenly, lifting his eyes to meet the man.</p><p> </p><p>The man grinned widely, showing off his teeth again. “You.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt his stomach drop. “I’m- I’m not who you think I am,” Harry said shakily. “I’m not a puppy. Remus, he’s just my friend. I’m not a werewolf.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that,” the man nodded. “But you are my Puppy,” he grinned. “I can smell it.”</p><p> </p><p>“You- You’re a werewolf?”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t know who I am?” the man asked, surprised. “I’m Fenrir Greyback.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Harry said, his stomach seizing with nerves. He’d heard that name before. “You work for Vol- er - You Know Who.”</p><p> </p><p>The man nodded. “And you, little Pup, are Harry Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s jaw clenched. “Please-” he pleaded, tears coming to his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not going to hurt you,” the man, Fenrir, said again. “No one is going to hurt you.”</p><p> </p><p>“But you-” Harry stammered. “You work for-”</p><p> </p><p>“And you are my Puppy,” he said seriously. “That outranks any work loyalties.”</p><p> </p><p>“Voldemort will kill you,” Harry whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Fenrir laughed. “I’d like to see him try.”</p><p> </p><p>“But-”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re safe Puppy. Daddy will protect you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not my dad,” Harry frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“I might as well be.”</p><p> </p><p>“No!” Harry said angrily. “You’re not my dad!” he yelled, jumping up from the man’s lap.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, alright,” Fenrir sighed, grabbing Harry around the waist and pulling him back to his lap. “I’m not your dad, but I am your Alpha.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not a werewolf,” Harry said, pushing at the arm that held him in a vice grip, to no avail.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t know what the Puppy is, do you?” Fenrir asked suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby dogs,” Harry scoffed, giving up on escaping, for the time being, folding his arms across his chest angrily.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Fenrir laughed. “But you’re not <em>a</em> puppy, you’re <em>the</em> Puppy.”</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t make sense.”</p><p> </p><p>“I would have thought Lupin would have taught you this.”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe he didn’t teach me because you’re wrong,” Harry sighed. “I’m not a puppy.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re-”</p><p> </p><p>“And I’m not <em>the</em> Puppy,” Harry added in a huff.</p><p> </p><p>“How do you know that?” Fenrir asked suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>“Because!” Harry scoffed indignantly. “I’m just not.”</p><p> </p><p>“You are.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” Harry huffed. “Prove it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Gladly,” Fenrir nodded, with a grin. He then tucked his nose into the crook of Harry’s neck and inhaled deeply. He released a giant sigh of relief. “There. See? You’re my Puppy.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not proof!”</p><p> </p><p>“It is for me,” Fenrir laughed. “Nothing on Earth smells as sweet as the Puppy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, that means nothing to me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” Fenrir shrugged. “Smell me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Smell you?” Harry gawked. “No. I mean- no. That’s just- I’m not a werewolf remember?”</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Fenrir grinned. “Just do it,” he said, nudging Harry to prompt him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt his cheeks heat, as he nonchalantly leaned his face into Fenrir’s chest to smell him.</p><p> </p><p>He blushed even darker as he felt himself leaning into it. He jerked his face away from him.</p><p> </p><p>“And so?” Fenrir smirked.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Harry said, in a clipped tone.</p><p> </p><p>“Liar,” he laughed. “Tell me the truth.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not lying. I didn’t-”</p><p> </p><p>Fenrir fisted a handful of Harry’s hair and pushed his face into his chest. “Smell me for real.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry whimpered and tried to blame the way he pressed his face closer on Fenrir because he smelled… so good.</p><p> </p><p>Harry couldn’t describe it. It flooded him and he could feel himself relax. He felt safe. He felt warm and tingly. He felt wanted, and needed, and loved.</p><p> </p><p>“Now tell me, Puppy,” Fenrir whispered, “what do I smell like?”</p><p> </p><p>“I-” Harry croaked. “You-” he bit his tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Fenrir didn’t press him for an answer. He soothed Harry’s hair, and let him push his face into his chest.</p><p> </p><p>Without realizing what he was doing Harry started rubbing his face back and forth across Fenrir’s chest and up into the crook of his neck.</p><p> </p><p>Fenrir sighed in relief, enjoying the contact with his Puppy.</p><p> </p><p>Harry froze at the sound and blushed madly.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh hush, sweet thing,” Fenrir said softly, leaning down to kiss Harry’s forehead. “You’re scent marking. It’s the most natural thing in the world.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not a werewolf!” Harry groaned, hiding his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop it,” Fenrir suddenly growled, lifting Harry’s chin. “Don’t shame yourself. This is normal, Puppy. Do not be embarrassed.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not-”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not a werewolf,” Fenrir sighed. “I know. Would you like to be? Would that make this easier for you?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Harry said automatically, shaking his head.</p><p> </p><p>Fenrir pulled Harry back, so his face would press into Fenrir's chest again. Harry only fought him a little.</p><p> </p><p>After a few moments of breathing in his intoxicating scent, Harry let his eyes flutter shut.</p><p> </p><p>"What is a- <em>the</em>- Puppy then?" he asked sleepily.</p><p> </p><p>"The Puppy is a very special creature. Loved and respected by all magical creatures. The Puppy is Pup of the Alpha."</p><p> </p><p>"Doesn't make sense," Harry frowned, his eyes still resting as he nuzzled into Fenrir, breathing him in deeply.</p><p> </p><p>Fenrir smiled down at him softly.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you know about pack dynamics?"</p><p> </p><p>"Alpha, Beta, and Omega," Harry replied.</p><p> </p><p>"Right," he nodded. "Alphas are the leaders, Betas make up the majority of the pack, Omegas are the outcasts or lone wolves without a pack. But there are also two other groups. The Subs, which are the bitches, a wolf that keeps the pack happy, and then the Pups. Pups are the babies of Alphas."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not a baby," Harry huffed, half-heartedly.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes you are," Fenrir smirked.</p><p> </p><p>"Not," Harry said sleepily.</p><p> </p><p>"So," Fenrir continued, smiling. "Pups are the babies of Alphas, and you, <em>The</em> Puppy, are the baby of me, <em>The</em> Alpha."</p><p> </p><p>"Why are you the Alpha?"</p><p> </p><p>"I'll explain in the morning," Fenrir said, standing with Harry cradled against his chest. "Sleep Puppy."</p><p> </p><p>"Sleepy," Harry nodded, falling into a deep slumber.</p>
