    <p>Ginny was 35 years old, happily retired from professional Quidditch, utterly fabulous, and completely unhappy in her marriage.</p>
<p>This was, perhaps, somewhat to be expected. Getting married to someone you had idolised your entire life at the tender age of 21 is generally considered to be ill-advised. In fact, Ginny might go so far as to say that going on to marry someone whom you had met in school nearly immediately after fighting in a war together was all-around a bad idea.</p>
<p>Still, she couldn’t begrudge her years with Harry. Not totally, anyway. She adored their two sons, James and Al, and their daughter, Lily. She adored them more than she adored the whistle of wind in her ears when she was diving after the Quaffle. She adored them so much that she had been willing to give up her career with the Holyhead Harpies to educate them full-time. Harry, of course, had refused to allow her to do this. “They need to have some kind of Muggle education. You’ve seen the way that Ron keeps the accounts at Weasley Wizard Wheezes. Our children need to have some understanding of maths, Gin,” Harry had said. Ginny didn’t know exactly why maths were so important, but this argument wasn’t worth rehashing over and over again. Ledgering charms worked perfectly well on their own household accounts, but Harry wouldn’t listen.</p>
<p>So, Ginny had bit her tongue and signed her children up for the nearest primary school.</p>
<p>Convincing her children to get behind the idea had been a whole other challenge, but that’s best left for another time. Also, the struggles and tantrums involved with wrangling three children under the age of ten to a primary school when they can make your hair permanently frizzy in a fit of pique (and no amount of Sleekeazy’s could turn it right again) are not the travails of the utterly fabulous. No. This she left to Harry, whose hair was already untameable.</p>
<p>Ginny had tossed around the idea of becoming a Quidditch reporter for the Daily Prophet, had even covered the 2014 Quidditch World Cup for them (and been lambasted by that old hag Rita Skeeter when Harry had shown up to the match with a giant cut and matching bruise across his face – she’d told him to drink a Wiggenweld before leaving that morning, but he never did listen), but had decided it wasn’t for her.</p>
<p>Now, she mostly kept herself flush with the odd product endorsement and guest commentator gig, mainly in the American Quidditch League. She’d always loved playing across the pond, as the Muggles said, where she was known as “the most brilliant Chaser in history” and not simply “Harry Potter’s wife.” It was completely gratifying to be known for something other than marrying her schoolgirl crush.</p>
<p>She was Ginny Weasley-Potter, and she would do something fabulous with her time.</p>
<p>This did not include picking up her husband’s dirty socks, his blood and mud-covered Auror’s robes, Lego bricks and stray play-potions ingredients left around by her children or cooking for a horde. And today was the day that she was going to tell her husband that.</p>
<p>“Wotcher,” Harry said as he stepped out of the fireplace that evening. He was always a bit of an awkward duckie, but “wotcher”? Seriously? After 15 years of marriage?</p>
<p>Ginny sighed through her nose, not bothering to rise from her squashy armchair in the sitting room. “I know that you’re having an affair,” she said simply, crossing her arms across her chest.</p>
<p>Harry had the grace to look ashamed. “Listen, Gin, I can explain,” he started, but she cut him off with a glare. Harry swallowed nervously, his Adam’s apple bobbing. If she strained her eyes, Ginny could just about make out the love bite forming under his left ear.</p>
<p>“Save it,” Ginny said. “I know that you’re having an affair, and have done for years. I’ll leave you to find a way to explain to our children and our family that you’ve been sleeping with Draco Malfoy behind my back.” Two light spots appeared in Harry’s brown cheeks. He was blushing now, and it took all of Ginny’s willpower not to find this charming. She would not be charmed by this man. Not when she was this miserable. “I’m not angry anymore. I just don’t want to keep living like this, with an unavailable and uncommunicative husband and three children sapping the life out of me with no help from their father!”</p>
<p>Ginny watched Harry’s hackles rise. “That’s not bloody fair, Gin, and you know it,” he said hotly. “I do all the school things, even now that I’m up for promotion and the head has just been looking for reasons to disqualify me. I’ve never been a neglectful father – I’ve never spent even an evening away from them, which is a right sight more than what you can say.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry that the American Quidditch League doesn’t hold matches in the back garden, dear,” Ginny said, her heart thundering in her ears. “Nevertheless, I’m leaving. The children are nearly old enough to be at Hogwarts. That’s quite old enough to understand that Mummy is leaving because Daddy doesn’t love her anymore.” Ginny took a deep breath, smoothing her hair back from her face as her voice rose. “I’m certain that it’s for the best. You and Draco can go on and have a relationship in public, especially since Malfoy’s wife left him last year.”</p>
<p>Harry raked a hand through his hair, making it stand up on end in wild tangles. “I can’t believe that you’re leaving me,” he said, collapsing onto the sofa. “I always thought that – ”</p>
<p>“That you’d leave me?” Ginny said bitterly. “Or that we’d live forever in marital bliss promised to the Chosen One after saving the entire Wizarding World from a racist megalomaniac?”</p>
<p>“No,” Harry said forcefully, hanging his head and bracing his elbows against his knees. “I just – I just thought that – that we were happy. That you were happy.”</p>
<p>Ginny sat back in her chair. She had the impulse to suck on the ends of her hair suddenly, just like she did when she was a child. There was a long silence, and she thought she could see Harry staring over at her from under his brows. “No, I’m not, Harry,” Ginny said finally. “But I will be. That’s something that I know for certain.”</p>
<p>With that, Ginny rose from her chair and crossed to the fireplace. She’d tucked her trunk into the corner. Her entire life was contained in that trunk. Ginny took out her wand, and levitated the trunk to her side. Harry shot up from the sofa just as Ginny was about to reach for their little flowerpot full of Floo powder on the mantle. “You can’t possibly be leaving already,” Harry said, a faint note of panic in his voice. “You’re leaving me to tell the children? Your parents? All alone?”</p>
<p>“Yes, dear,” Ginny said. She reached into the flowerpot and felt the powder run through her fingers. “You’re a clever man. I’m sure you’ll think of something appropriate. Cheers, love.” Ginny stepped into the fireplace with her trunk in her hand, having tucked her wand into her bun. She’d never quite broken herself of that particular bad habit.</p>
<p>Could she truly do this? Could she truly leave her husband and her children and go off to live on her own?</p>
<p><em>No, Ginevra, stop this</em>, Ginny told herself. <em>You are fabulous. You are going to France. You are going to live your best life like one of those retired AQL Seekers after a </em>Felix<em> scandal.</em></p>
<p>She took a deep breath and cleared her throat. Ginny didn’t want to end up in Marseille on the seedy side of town. Again. “Chateau Baie-des-Anges,” she said clearly.</p>
<p>It was time for Ginevra Weasley-Potter to have some fun for a change.</p>
