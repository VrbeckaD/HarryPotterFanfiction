    <p>Ch. 1</p><p>Severus sat at the table listening to the meeting as it went on. He was anxious and wanted to return to his quarters. His mind kept wandering to what he and Dumbledore talked about earlier. What he must do, but he didn't want to do it.</p><p>"Severus," a voice broke through his thoughts. Severus looked up and locked eyes with blood ruby red ones.</p><p>"Yes, M'Lord?" Severus replied.</p><p>"You seem distracted tonight, anything you need to share?" The Dark Lord replied.</p><p>"Dumbledore has been acting strange lately. I believe he is planning something," Severus replied folding his hands together in front of him.</p><p>The Dark Lord hummed and laced his fingers together as he placed his elbows on the table and resting his chin on his hands, "Keep an eye on him, Severus, and notify me as soon as you know anything."</p><p>"Of course, M'Lord."</p><p>"You are all dismissed, Severus, please stay behind if you will," the Dark Lord dismissed everyone as he stood. Everyone followed his lead and soon it was just he and Severus left in the room.</p><p>"Accompany me to my quarters?" The Dark Lord asked holding out his arm.</p><p>Severus slowly made his way over to him and gently wrapped his arms around the one offered. The Dark Lord placed his other hand over Severus' and smiled as they walked from the room.</p><p>They made their way through the headquarters is silence, Severus in fear and the Dark Lord in what looked to be calm peace. As they entered into the Dark Lord's quarters and as soon as the door closed, the Dark Lord's glamors dropped to reveal Tom Riddle and his lips were on Severus' neck.</p><p>The fireplace, to the left of the room, lit up the room and casting their shadows against the silver and emerald green damask wallpaper and the ebony wainscot. The herringbone ebony floor shining in the light like onyx gems. The dark ebony furniture with the emerald green tuff. A couch, two armchairs, and a coffee table sat in front of the fire. Two ebony bookcases flanked the walls on either side of the fireplace. A desk sat cocked in the far left corner and looked down on the garden below through the floor to ceiling windows that span the length of the wall with silver sheer curtains and thick heavy emerald green ones. A four-poster ebony bed sat to the right of the room with matching curtains like that of the windows and an emerald green and silver bed set to cover the bed. The large silver chandelier with the emerald and onyx gems glittering across the room.</p><p>"I couldn't wait for that meeting to end so I could have you in my arms."</p><p>The Dark Lord lifted the smaller into his arms and carried him over to the bed to the right of the room. Leaning over the foot of the bed to trap Severus between it and him, he looked into Severus' eyes.</p><p>"Now, tell me, Severus, are you sure you want to continue?"</p><p>Did Severus want to continue? Dumbledore told him to do whatever it took to get close to the Dark Lord, even if it meant sleeping with the monster.</p><p>"Yes, I'm just nervous. It's my first time." It wasn't a lie, it was Severus' first time. No one ever wanted to be with him, he wasn't beautiful.</p><p>The Dark Lord smiled a gentle smile and brushed the hair away from Severus' face, "I am flattered to know I will be your first and know that I will be gentle."</p><p>The Dark Lord moved them farther up the bed until they were both lying on the massive king size. The Dark Lord began to slowly take Severus' clothes off as he kissed his way down the exposed flesh. He opened the shirt and ran his hands over the pale flesh. Running his thumbs over the light pink nipples making them harden under his touch, he smiled when Severus arched into the touch.</p><p>"I see I've found one of your spots." He leaned in to whisper in Severus' ear, "I plan to find more."</p><p>He banished both of their clothes to the floor and devoured Severus' neck with his lips. Severus moaned and his eyes fluttered closed. He didn't want to enjoy this. He was only doing it because Dumbledore ordered it, but he was in complete bliss. How could someone this evil be so gentle with him?</p><p>The Dark Lord moved his way down Severus' body until he took one of those nipples into his mouth. Severus didn't notice one of the hands traveling down his body, but he jerked when he felt something wet touch his hole. He never notices the Dark Lord casting a lube spell on his finger until he started stretching the Potion Master.</p><p>"I didn't want to hurt you," The Dark Lord replied as he looked down at the man under him he was slowly stretching.</p><p>Severus' throat clenched up as the man continued to be gentle with him. The Dark Lord bent his head down and gently kissed Severus' lips. He broke the kiss with the Potion Master and then made his way down the other's body until he came to his cock.</p><p>Making eye contact with the Potion Master, he licked a stripe from Severus' balls to the head before swirling it with his tongue and taking it in his mouth. Severus arched into the mouth and gasped in pleasure. The Dark Lord bobbed his head up and down Severus' cock as he added another finger into him. Severus grasped the sheets below him and stared up at the textured ceiling as his mind went back to what Dumbledore told him as the Dark Lord finally penetrated him with his cock.</p><p>The Dark Lord lifted Severus up from the bed until their chests were touching and sat Severus cock completely on his cock. He rested his forehead against the Potion Master's and looked into his eyes. Severus lost time in those eyes and didn't notice when the Dark Lord started moving, but all he knew was that he was in bliss. He wrapped his arms around the Dark Lord's neck while the Dark Lord supported him under his arms. Everything was speeding up around him and before he knew it, he felt something warm fill him inside and his own seed splattered against them.</p><p>Severus became limp and allowed himself to be lowered down to the bed. The Dark Lord cast a cleaning spell over them before lying down next to him. He covered them both with the silk silver sheets and green duvet before they both fell asleep with the Dark Lord curled around Severus.</p>
