    <p>There’s a moment of silence as everyone stares at Hermione holding Meissa.</p><p>“Bloody hell, when did that happen?” Ginny asks, and Daphne rolls her eyes.</p><p>“Very tactful—now let’s just head back to the wedding,” the Beta snaps, and she links her arm in Hermione’s. Meissa blinks at Daphne, her eyes lingering on the Beta’s white-blond hair. The group slowly begins to make their way back to the marquee—Tarow takes a minute to put Molly in the Burrow—and the Werewolves speed up to look at Meissa.</p><p>Hermione’s daughter looks up at them, and she leans toward them, taking tiny sniffs in their direction. Tarow grins at the action, and she blows a puff of air on Meissa’s head.</p><p>“I like your pup’s eyes; they will certainly scare her enemies into submission,” the Alfā Werewolf declares, and Leilaki nods.</p><p>“She’s a very beautiful pup,” the Omega Werewolf adds, and she looks down at Ginny with a wishful expression.</p><p>“Speaking of pups, we need to talk about our packs,” Tarow murmurs into Hermione’s ear, and before Hermione can respond, the Alfā Werewolf herds the others off to their own seats—even pulling Daphne off Hermione’s arm. Hermione just goes with the flow, and she makes her way back to her seat, sitting down just as soft instrumental music cues up and the talking silences.</p><p>Hermione glances at the violinist, and she’s mildly surprised to see Katie’s the one playing the very traditional Veela bonding piece. Although the Veela Alpha’s music is soothing and calm, her disappointed expression clearly states her feelings on the wedding. However, Bill, who’s the closest to her, is oblivious to her feelings, as he’s smiling widely.</p><p>Suddenly, there’s the sound of people turning around in their seats, and Hermione turns as well. Arthur and Molly appear, the latter still looking frazzled but she puts on a decent mask to cover it.</p><p>The couple walk down the aisle, smiling and waving, and they take their honored seats in the front row. Not a minute later, Charlie and one of Bill’s coworkers walk down the aisle in fancy dress robes, and they take their place on Bill’s right. Another minute later, and Kate strides down the aisle, a bouquet of white flowers in her hands, and she takes her place next to her cousin.</p><p>Ron walks stiffly under the weight of all the guests’ stares, and the pillow carrying the two rings shake as he awkwardly takes his place next to his brother. Finally, Gabrielle appears, tossing handfuls of red and white petals before her as she walks. She stands with Kate, who gives her fellow Veela Omega a small fist bump.</p><p>In the corner of the marquee, she sees Err’sh half-hidden in a large plant, and Tyche coiled around the chains of chandeliers, over looking everyone. Then, the music strengthens, and Hermione sees Fleur.</p><p>The Veela Alpha is a picture of elegant beauty; a simple, flowing, white, shoulderless dress that ripples with every step, and the lace near the top accents her swan-like swoop of her clavicles.</p><p>Sparkly, light-purple eyeshadow dust Fleur’s eyelids, giving her an ethereal snow goddess look. Her silver-blond hair is piled high atop her head in a braided bun, diamond strings lining every lock of hair, and Hermione realizes she recognizes that hairstyle. The whole marital image pierces a dagger straight through Hermione’s heart, and heartache burns strong in her.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Hermione, Meissa breaks her stare from Fleur to look at her mother, and she cocks her head. Those heterochromia iridum eyes flick between her mother and the Veela bride, and she carefully places a hand on her mother’s. Hermione glances down, smiling weakly at Meissa, and her daughter stares wide-eyed at her.</p><p>‡<em>Ssshe family?</em>‡ Her daughter hisses ever so softly, and Hermione sighs.</p><p>‡<em>Yesss . . . Ssshe’sss family of the heart,</em>‡ Hermione hisses back, and Meissa scrunches up her nose in confusion.</p><p>‡<em>Aunt?</em>‡</p><p>‡<em>No,</em>‡ Hermione hisses, watching as Fleur’s mother escorts Fleur down the aisle, and Hermione sees her father silently crying tears of joy.</p><p>‡<em>Nieccce? Cousssin? Sssisster?</em>‡</p><p>‡<em>No, no, and no. You sssee Petite Corbeau [Little Raven], Fleur isss . . .</em>‡ Hermione trails off as Fleur passes by her without a glance in her direction. Meissa pokes Hermione impatiently.</p><p>‡<em>Isss what?</em>‡ She demands, but Hermione’s attention is diverted when Draco leans over to her.</p><p>“Didn’t you have the ssame hairsstyle for the Yule Ball?” He whispers, and Hermione nods. Fleur and her mother part ways, and the Veela Alpha takes her place across from Bill, both grinning shyly at each other. The sight burns a twisted feeling in Hermione’s chest as she forces herself to watch the bonding ceremony.</p><p>As soon as Fleur and Bill kiss chastely on the lips, chimes, balloons, and exotic birds are released by the Weasley twins. As soon as the guests start to get up to go to the party tent, Hermione’s out of her seat and striding away from the marquee to distance herself from the wedding.</p><p>Meissa looks up at her curiously, but her daughter doesn’t say anything as she merely opts to place her hand on Hermione’s. Walking up a small hill with a large tree, she crests it, and takes a large breath.</p><p>‡<em>Sssroosss-Sssueensss-Sssirasss? [Brood-Queen-Mother?]</em>‡ Meissa hisses, and Hermione looks down at her daughter. The sky’s gradual transition into sunset colors make her baby’s skin turn a light gold color.</p><p>‡<em>Yess?</em>‡</p><p>‡<em>Isss Fleur other Mother?</em>‡</p><p>Hermione blinks at the question, and hurriedly shakes her head.</p><p>‡<em>No, ssshe’sss not, Bellatrixxx isss your other Mother,</em>‡ she hisses, and Meissa sighs frustratedly.</p><p>‡<em>How Fleur family of heart?</em>‡ Her daughter demands, staring up at Hermione expectantly. Hermione purses her lips, thinking about it. What is Fleur to her? Not lovers anymore, not with the marriage in the way . . . Friend is too simple a word to describe their relationship, and best friend seems a little pretentious.</p><p>‡<em>We were loversss onccce . . . You would have been a little sssissster,</em>‡ Hermione hisses softly, and Meissa’s eyes get big.</p><p>‡<em>Little sssissster? Where big sssissster?</em>‡ Her daughter asks innocently, bouncing in Hermione’s arms excitedly. Hermione can’t help the pang of sorrow that flashes across her face, and Meissa sees it. She stops bouncing, and she looks concerned for Hermione.</p><p>‡<em>. . . No big sssissster?</em>‡ She hisses slowly, and before Hermione can answer, someone behind her speaks.</p><p>“Enjoying the sunset?”</p><p>Hermione’s shoulders stiffen a little, but she turns around to face Fleur in her full glory.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione simply stares at the absolute vision before her, lit up in the golden hour rays; she’s a goddess. Fleur squints, and raises a hand over her face, subsequently allowing her to see Meissa.</p><p>“Oh,” is all Fleur says, and Hermione wills herself not to shift nervously.</p><p>“Oh my goodness, she’s so adorable!” Fleur coos, and she quickly closes the distance between them to smile at Meissa.</p><p>“May I hold her?” The Veela Alpha asks, and a little stunned, Hermione does. Meissa gasps when Fleur holds her, and she reaches to touch the Veela Alpha’s hands to steady herself. Hermione wars between watching Fleur like a hawk to make sure she doesn’t drop her daughter and impinging Fleur holding their daughter.</p><p>Hermione blinks when she realizes that Fleur is talking to her.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that,” Hermione says, and Fleur rolls her eyes playfully.</p><p>“I said, who are her parents? She’s such a darling, I wouldn’t let her out of my sight if she was mine,” Fleur says, and Hermione runs her fingers through her hair.</p><p>“She’s mine,” she murmurs, and Fleur tenses.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>There’s a moment of silence, and then Fleur looks up.</p><p>“May I ask with whom?”</p><p>“Bellatrix Black.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Hermione says, and she looks away from Fleur’s intense,penetrating gaze.</p><p>“Is she here?”</p><p>“Uh, no.”</p><p>“Well. What’s your daughter’s name?” Fleur asks, and Hermione feels a little whiplashed by the stilted conversation they’re having.</p><p>“Meissa, Meissa Astra Bellatrix Black,” Hermione replies proudly, and her daughter smiles when she hears her name. Throughout the conversation, she’s been playing with Fleur’s hair, fascinated by it.</p><p>“Is it wrong of me to envy her?” Fleur whispers to herself, looking down at Meissa, and Hermione takes a cautious step forwards.</p><p>“Her?” She murmurs.</p><p>“<em>Bellatrix,</em>” Fleur growls, and Hermione slowly cups Fleur’s face.</p><p>“Why do you envy her?” Hermione asks gently, and she rubs her thumbs along Fleur’s cheekbones. Meissa switches her gaze between Hermione and Fleur with a little smile on her face.</p><p>“I . . . I don’t know? I just feel so <em>angry</em> at her for some reason,” Fleur looks up, confusion swimming in her cerulean-blue eyes, and Hermione has to force herself to not lose herself in them. With the sunset light casting shadows over Fleur’s face, it’s hard not to lean in closer, but a glance at her white dress smacks the reality in Hermione’s face, so she changes the subject.</p><p>“I seem to remember my hair looking like this during the Yule Ball,” Hermione drawls, tugging on a loose lock of hair, and Fleur blushes a little.</p><p>“It looked so beautiful on you, so I thought I might try it,” the Veela Alpha admits, and Hermione grins.</p><p>“You look jaw dropping gorgeous,” she murmurs, and Fleur smiles, and then she shifts Meissa to one arm so she can reach up to Hermione’s chest.</p><p>“Do you still have it?” Fleur asks softly, and Hermione has to take a few breaths to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>calm her heart since the Veela Alpha’s hand is resting right between her breasts. Hermione reaches under her suit, pulls out her <em>Violet Eyes</em> necklace, and Fleur’s fingers twitch at the sight of the necklace.</p><p>“You actually kept it,” Fleur murmurs, amazed, and Hermione chuckles under her breath.</p><p>“I keep everything you give me,” she says, and lays a hand on the back of the Veela Alpha’s neck, leaning them close so their foreheads can rest on each other’s.</p><p>“Really?” Fleur mumbles, looking up at Hermione through her eye lashes.</p><p>“Really,” Hermione replies, and a thought occurs to her.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve given you your wedding present,” she says, and Fleur frowns slightly.</p><p>“That’s okay, you being here is the best present I could have.”</p><p>“Nonetheless, I still want to give you something,” Hermione replies, and she slowly lifts one of her necklaces over her head, and then over Fleur’s. The <em>Madisntic’s Necklace</em> looks out of place against the Veela Alpha’s wedding dress, as it rests right in her cleavage, and Fleur gasps when she holds up the dog tag to the waning light.</p><p>“Hermione, I can’t, this is—” the Veela Alpha splutters, but Hermione places a finger against Fleur’s lips, instantly quieting her.</p><p>“I can, and I want to. Besides, now you have a piece of me, and I have a piece of you,” Hermione says with a sad smile, and Fleur looks like she’s on the verge of crying.</p><p>“I don’t know why I’m like this—why do I feel so <em>devastated</em> yet so terribly <em>happy?</em>” Fleur sniffs, and silent tears start to run down her cheeks. Meissa blinks at the Veela Alpha, a little startled to see a grown woman crying. Hermione doesn’t say anything, but she wraps Fleur in her arms gently, carefully minding that her daughter is still held in Fleur’s arms between them.</p><p>The Veela Alpha rests her head against Hermione’s chest, and she can feel the tears dampen her suit, so she holds Fleur tighter.</p><p>»I’m so sorry ma Loutre [my Otter], I can’t save you right now, but I swear it, I shall do what Mini required, and then I’ll free you,« Hermione says in Velian, knowing that Fleur in her current state can’t hear her. The sun finally sets, casting them in wide swaths of darkness. As Hermione starts to pull away, Fleur grips her sleeve with her free arm, mumbling something so soft that Hermione almost doesn’t think she heard it.</p><p>“Don’t leave me here alone.”</p><p>Hermione and Meissa lock eyes, and her daughter places her hand on Fleur’s cheek, her eyes glowing a little. Instantly, Fleur gasps sharply, and she snaps her head up at Hermione, startling her. Hermione stares at the familiar, fierce look in the Veela Alpha’s eyes, and Fleur grabs Hermione’s tie, sending a thrill through her.</p><p>“Hermione, I l—”</p><p>“Honey?! Is that you?!”</p><p>Hermione and Fleur look down the hill to see Bill awkwardly fumbling in the dark towards them. Meissa drops her hand, the glow in her eyes stop, and Fleur shivers a little. Carefully, she hands Hermione’s daughter back to her, and disappointment soars in Hermione when she sees the off look back in Fleur’s eyes.</p><p>“Yes Bill! Hermione and I lost track of time talking about her daughter!” Fleur says cheerfully, and she makes her way down to her husband.</p><p>“Really? Anyway, it’s time for the father-daughter dance,” Bill says happily, and Fleur giggles at him. So wrapped up in themselves, the couple walk arm in arm to the party tent, leaving Hermione and Meissa alone.</p><p>‡<em>Fleur wrong,</em>‡ her daughter hisses, and Hermione growls under her breath.</p><p>“I know.”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione lets Daphne hold Meissa during Fleur’s dance with her father. Watching the Veela Alpha, Hermione feels a pang of loss, and soon, it’s time for the mother-son dance. She idly follows Fleur with her gaze, watching her speak with her parents a little off the dance floor, and the memory of Mini’s request bubbles up in her mind.</p><hr/><p> </p><p><em>‡</em>Mini,<em>‡ Hermione interrupts the Locket before she delves into another lecture.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>Yesss?<em>‡</em></p><p><em>‡</em>Doesss a magical cure-all exxxissst?<em>‡</em></p><p>
  <em>Mini thinks for a long moment, and then she sighs.</em>
</p><p><em>‡</em>Yesss . . . There isss . . .<em>‡</em></p><p>
  <em>Hermione sits up at once, staring down at the Locket intently.</em>
</p><p><em>‡</em>And? What is it?<em>‡ She hisses, and Mini frowns.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>If I tell you, you mussst ssswear to accomplish something for me in return,<em>‡ Mini hisses, and Hermione raises an eyebrow.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>What would that be?<em>‡</em></p><p>
  <em>Mini growls to herself, and crosses her arms.</em>
</p><p><em>‡</em>I literally <em>can’t</em> disclose the “cure-all’s” identity without collateral to ensure its complete, and utter safety!<em>‡</em></p><p>
  <em>Now Hermione’s wary and intrigued, and she wars with herself about accepting Mini’s unknown, dire request or throwing caution to the wind to help Fleur.</em>
</p><p><em>‡</em>I ssswear to asssssissst you to the bessst of my ability,<em>‡ Hermione hisses, and Mini sighs.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>I sssuppossse that’sss good enough . . .<em>‡ the Locket trails off before staring at Hermione.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>Alfā Hermione Eto Mendonica, I want you to dessstroy the ressst of Ouroborosss’ Horcruxxxesss.<em>‡</em></p><p>
  <em>Hermione’s jaw drops.</em>
</p><p><em>‡</em>That’sss what you me to do? He could have hidden them anywhere in the world!<em>‡</em></p><p>
  <em>Mini snorts, and waves her hand dismissively.</em>
</p><p><em>‡</em>Oh pleassse, he’sss only got three left, ssseeing asss your ssseer already dessstroyed the one I <em>told</em> you to get rid of,<em>‡ Mini snarks, and Hermione takes a steadying breath.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>I asssssume you know where all three are located?<em>‡ She hisses, and Mini scratches her head.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>Well, I know where they <em>originally</em> were hidden,<em>‡ Mini amends, and Hermione rubs her eyes.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>That’sss a ssstart,‡ she grumbles. ‡Now, tell me about the cure-all,<em>‡ Hermione orders, and now Mini looks apprehensive.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>To control Magic itself, one mussst control Death, and in order to accomplisssh that, you must asssssemble the Deathly Hallowsss to become the sssupreme Massster of Death,<em>‡ Mini hisses softly, her words bringing forth an ominous tension in the Grimmauld Place. Hermione feels a phantom touch trail down her spine, and she shivers.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>What are thessse Deathly Hallowsss?<em>‡</em></p><p><em>‡</em>There are many versssionsss of what Wizarding people think the Hallowsss look like, but in reality, the Hallowsss merely conformed to the ssshape that the original three ownersss could comprehend,<em>‡ Mini explains, and Hermione leans back so she’s lying on the floor again.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>Who were the ownersss? Who created the Hallowsss?<em>‡ Hermione asks, and Mini laughs.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>The three Peverell brothers of course; they sought to cheat Death himself, but Death always wins, so He made the Hallows from Himself as “gifts” to kill them,<em>‡ Mini pauses, and then looks in the direction where Hermione’s room is.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>Dumbledore possessed a Hallow; it is the pinky finger of Death’s left hand; and now, you have it . . .<em>‡</em></p><hr/><p> </p><p>“You really don’t want to be here, do you?”</p><p>Hermione blinks out of her reverie, and looks down at Daphne.</p><p>“Not really,” she says, and she looks over the festive wedding. Most guests are dancing to their heart’s content, and some are simply mingling with other guests. In the corner of the dance floor, Hermione sees Ginny dancing wildly with Leilaki. Surprisingly, she spots Narcissa standing with a cup of wine amiably next to a nervously twitching Astoria.</p><p>“Do you want to leave then?” Daphne asks, and Hermione opens her mouth, but Tarow suddenly appears by her side.</p><p>#We need to talk about our packs,# the Alfā Werewolf woofs gruffly, and Hermione nods.</p><p>“Can you watch Meissa for me?” Hermione asks, and Daphne stands taller.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Hermione gives her a once over, then follows Tarow to a more secluded spot of the tent.</p><p>#What did you want to talk about?# Hermione barks, and Tarow looks over at Ginny.</p><p>#She’s part of your pack, yes?#</p><p>#Yes,# Hermione answers, a little confused at where the Alfā Werewolf is directing the conversation.</p><p>#As her Alfā, will you let Ginny become part of my pack?# Tarow asks, and now Hermione understands.</p><p>#I don’t see why not, as long as she’s treated with the respect she’s due,# she replies, and Tarow grins.</p><p>#That’s good. Truthfully, I didn’t want to fight you over this matter—#</p><p>Suddenly a white Patronus crashes through the top of the tent, and the wedding comes to a halt as everyone stares at the silver Hare.</p><p>“The Prophecy prevails; the Half of Death has crossed; the Ouroboros flies free,” Luna’s dreamy voice says, and then the Gamma’s Patronus looks directly at Meissa.</p><p>“All hail, the Raven King,” the Patronus says dreamily, and it bows its head as it dissolves.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>Hermione’s slithering lazily on stone, and a pair of shiny, black boots walk next to her. There isn’t anyone around them, and Hermione realizes she can’t even detect the sound of torches. However, the snake doesn’t need any light to see, and neither does the snake’s companion. They stop when a door comes into view, and the snake looks farther down the hall. She wants to go down further, away from the person next to her.</em>
</p><p><em>‡</em>Not again, Nagini,<em>‡ Ouroboros hisses, annoyed. Hermione feels hiss rumble deep in her throat, and Nagini twitches.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>If you’re not going to behave, you’ll have to wait outside,<em>‡ Ouroboros continues, opening the door. The giant snake hangs her head, and follows him.</em></p><p><em>‡</em>I thought ssso.<em>‡ He hisses smugly, and Hermione feels a sliver of anger slice through Nagini’s mind towards the dark Alpha. Diving into the serpent’s thoughts, Hermione thinks she sees the beginning<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of a Familiar bond, but one that was either half-assed or was never sealed properly.</em></p><p>
  <em>However, there’s something else too, something not quite right, and when Hermione swims closer to the tangled threads of magic, she’s out of Nagini’s innermost thoughts abruptly when a rough prod of foreign mental presence spears into the snake’s mind. Nagini hisses reproachfully, and slithers away from Ouroboros.</em>
</p><p><em>‡</em>I know Nagini, I do apologizzze, but sssinccce you’re not talking to me, how elssse am I sssupposed to know what you’re feeling?<em>‡ Ouroboros hisses. Hermione rolls her eyes at the poor excuse of an apology, and she wonders how a snake like Nagini is tied to Ouroboros. Nagini likewise doesn’t seem to appreciate it either, for she doesn’t spare Ouroboros a glance.</em></p><p>
  <em>Ouroboros grunts, and then suddenly light starts to seep down into the room they’re in, illuminating the black walls. Nagini hisses softly, squinting up at the light, and Hermione gasps. Suspended in the air above them are seven, giant, glowing crystals. Six slowly revolve around the room in an hexagonal shape as the seventh circling in place in the middle, but that’s not the thing that made Hermione gasp.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s the fact that four of the crystals have bodies imbedded in them. One holds the late Alpha James Potter, still wearing a St. Mungo’s hospital gown and bearing a still bloody stab wound right above his heart. Another holds her Great-Grandfather, still wearing his prison garb and a peaceful smile as rivulets of blood drip from his slit neck.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In another, Alpha Albus Dumbledore’s fried corpse remains unchanged, except for the the thinnest of cuts secreting blood from his gut. Finally, upon seeing the body in the middle, seventh crystal, Hermione lets out a silent croak of horror. Nagini curls around herself, and fixes her gaze on crystals. Ouroboros starts chanting under his breath, and he places his hands in the middle of an ancient runic circle burnt into the ground.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione struggles to tear her gaze away from the body, and to the hundreds of thousands of more runic circles lighting up with magical power. Nagini flicks her tongue nervously, feeling the air shimmer with the densely charged, Olde Magick. Suddenly, the crystals holding the corpses start glowing brilliantly, and Nagini has to look away from the blinding light.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ouroboros’ chanting gets louder, and Hermine can distinctly hear the muffled sounds of flesh tearing and blood spurting against crystal. Suddenly, Ouroboros roars, and Nagini convulses in terror as the corpse of Alfā Etoilnaiphas Mendonica screams.</em>
