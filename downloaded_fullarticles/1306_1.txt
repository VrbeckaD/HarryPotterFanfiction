<p>
  <em>Enrollment</em>
</p>
<p>I don’t remember.<br/>
I don’t remember the sound of his voice anymore, or the feeling of warmth from his rare hugs. I don’t even remember his face that much anymore, even though I dream about him almost every night. I barely notice the gigantic portrait hanging in the northern hallway whenever I walk past it, not caring to check if that really is my father, like uncle claims it is.<br/>
It’s a funny thing; loss. To spare myself for the constant grief from losing someone I love, my brain has almost completely washed him away from my memories. Just to turn off the sadness a smidge. It's not an uncommon thing, not at all… for traumatized children, who are too young to process the facts of life. And here I am, a nineteen-year-old woman pretending to be anything but the broken girl I truly am. 
I know I’m fucked up, I have always been fucked up in the head; but telling myself that is also a stupid excuse for my thoughts and behavior, because I’m not fucked up. Not really. I function normally for a woman my age with my circumstances, or so my muggle psychologist tells me when I visit her every Thursday. But she doesn’t know everything, not all of my ‘circumstances’.<br/>
It’s been fourteen months since his disappearance and thirteen since the reappearance of his bloody pocket watch in a brown envelope with no name on it. 
The blue sky had been clouded the whole morning that day, never letting the sun cast its rays on my cold face. Uncle found me in the attic, gazing out into the nothingness of the grey skies through my favorite window. I tensed up when he opened the door, oh so carefully, not wanting to disturb me, like if I was some sort of wild animal he didn’t want to spook. 
I didn’t have to look his way, to see his sad green eyes, to know that he knew something about father. 
Uncle walked over to me, placing the brown envelope beside me on the windowsill and left the attic again, leaving me with my own destructive thoughts and the last thing I wanted to be confronted with. Death. But I had known deep in my bones that the day he had disappeared would be the last I ever saw of him. A woman’s intuition maybe? After what must have been at least half an hour, I had opened the envelope just a teensy bit to gaze at the content, fearing to find a finger or maybe an ear, but what I found was much worse than that.<br/>
Okay so maybe I remember him. Or at least his death and the days I waited for him to return, but not his face. Never his face. And it drives me to madness, every night. </p>
<p>No. “<em>No.</em>” I say out loud, voicing the thoughts echoing in my head. No way in hell is my uncle joining me to see the headmistress, no matter how scared he is of me fucking up this meeting. Uncle Bobby looks as if I frightened him with my stern voice, and he quickly backs down, stepping away from the stairs leading up to the headmistress’ office.<br/>
He opens and closes his mouth a couple of times as if trying to find the right thing to say but he just looks like a helpless fish and it makes me regret using such a stern voice. “I think it’s best if I do this myself.” I tell him truthfully but with a bit of sugarcoat, hoping this will make him look less startled and uncomfortable. It seems to work wonderfully as Bobby nods, understanding and accepting my decision. 
“Of course, you should do this yourself.” He repeats and looks at me expectantly. His weary, green eyes shine of something like worry and fright, but he smiles delicately at me, and he suddenly seems way older than what he is.<br/>
Grey strands of hair have fallen down from his neat hairstyle and into his eyes on the way to the school, but he doesn't seem to notice that yet. We stand there looking at each others. Bobby looks tired and used up. Like a bit of butter smeared over far too much bread. He hasn’t even been my legal guardian for one and a half year so an official thing like this feels oddly out of place.<br/>
I decide to take the initiative, setting down my large suitcase beside the stairs and slowly walking over to him with opens arms; asking for a hug. Bobby surprises me by meeting me halfway in a quick stride, embracing me fully and pressing my smaller body into his. 
He hugs me tightly, and I him, and we just stand there in the empty hallway, letting nothing but Bobby’s almost silent sobbing and our heartbeats break the silence. We let go after what seems like an eternity, and Bobby is walking down the hallway way before I wanted him to, but maybe that’s for the best. We aren’t parent and child after all.<br/>
With resolve in my steps I leave my suitcase behind and walk up the stairs, stepping closer to the woman who will be the judge of my enrollment in Hogwarts. It’s the day before the train arrives with all the students from all the years and all the houses, so the whole school is empty besides the teachers, the caretaker, the game keeper, headmistress, matron and so on. I don’t spare my suitcase a second thought as I continue walking up the stairs, which are elevating me as I go, helping me reach the very top of the tower, where I meet a large wooden door.<br/>
The stone walls around me makes every sound bounce off and echo, and it scares me to hear my own heavy breathing so clearly.<br/>
Without lingering too long in front of the door, I knock hard against it, making my knuckles ache slightly. “Come in.” someone responds immediately, while I’m still knocking against the wood, and I press my hands against the doors and push.<br/>
It opens with ease, swinging right open to reveal a large, circular room. The pressing heat from an unnecessarily lit fireplace, hits me like a wall. It is the 31st of August, late summer and plenty warm outside, but the owner of this office clearly thinks otherwise. “please step inside.”<br/>
As soon as I enter the room with only a few steps, the double oaken doors slowly close behind me, taking away my escape route. 
The sheer normalcy of moving stairs or doors still intrigue me after so many months, but they are nothing compared to the decorations of this room. Small, old models of old planes fly around in circles under the roof along with what looks like models of planets that I know and a few that I don’t, mingling among the planes.<br/>
Several portraits of old men and women hang around on the stone walls, apparently all dozing off or watching me with drowsy eyes. <em>Old people</em>…<br/>
“I will be with you shortly.”<br/>
My attention instantly snaps away from the old wizards and witches and train in on the only other <em>living</em> person in the room. A woman in long golden wizard ropes stand over a desk further into the room, her back facing me. It seems like she is writing something on a piece of parchment in quite a hurry, based off the rapid jerks of her right hand. I let her be, not wanting to disturb her, and walk further into the circular room.<br/>
Many of the walls in the back are covered in bookshelves from the floor to the ceiling around a slightly elevated part of the room. The elevated part seems to be the working space of the headmistress since a large desk and chair occupies most of the room in the back, and this is also where the woman is standing. Her desk appears to be covered in books, tomes and many trinkets, and on the floor, several rolls of parchment lay abandoned.<br/>
I try to stay silent as I step towards the middle of the room, taking in the smell of old books and wet wood.<br/>
A large, round and sturdy wooden table stands right in the middle of everything, right in front of me. Around me there are some other small desks and shelves aligning with the walls with all kinds of curious objects placed upon them. Some spin, puff smoke, bounce and hum, but the table in the very middle seems far too empty compared to everything else in here. It’s by far the largest table in the whole room and it intrigues me. The only thing on the table is a piece of yellow paper with green ink.<br/>
“that paper is what allows you to stay here.” The woman suddenly speaks, and I see that she has turned around, facing me with all her glory. The headmistress is as intense as Bobby had described to me on the way here. Her golden robes match her golden hair to perfection as they seem to melt together, encasing her whole body in gold as her long hair reaches past her hips. Icing blue eyes swallow me whole, nailing me to the spot and I seem to have lost my voice on my way up to the office.<br/>
The headmistress is supposed to be a seventy years old lady, but this woman doesn’t look a day over forty.<br/>
“I am headmistress Parrish.” Her voice is hard yet very smooth and beautiful, and I want to compliment it, but her face says <em>‘don’t even’</em>, which makes me continue to shut up. She simply fills out the silence of the room by continuing talking since I’m clearly not going to speak any time soon. “miss Winters, you must know how peculiar this situation is.” Parrish starts out, circling around the large table with the paper, to stand in front of me. “and I don’t like peculiar, because peculiar means that I have very little knowledge of it and therefore I don’t know how to handle this situation, professionally.” She squints her eyes slightly. “You need to help me with that.”<br/>
The intensity of her voice makes me gulp as she clearly commands me to do… something? “help you? How? What do you mean?” Parrish tilts her head back slightly, assessing me with her eyes from a new angle, as if that would help her answering my question. Her eyebrows furrow slightly and I’m just standing there, waiting for her to speak again.<br/>
“yes, help.” Parrish walks around the table again, standing on the other side while facing me with the same stern face as before, eyes resting on me. “you’re a very special case. I want to open my school to you and greet you with open arms like every other student, but you’re different... unstable.” 
Her words cut through me with such little effort that I gulp again. Ouch, right on the spot. “but after that being said ---”, Parrish looks like she is regretting everything in her life right now and I’m considering running out of the office before she can have the pleasure of rejecting my enrollment, but she interrupts my train of thoughts. “--- I trust Bobby Winters and therefore I trust you. This paper will be our contract, just between the two of us. To keep everyone safe, including yourself, I need you to sign this piece of parchment.” The woman gestures towards the yellow paper on the wooden table in front of me and quill and ink appears out of the thin air.<br/>
Adrenaline rushes through my veins as I pick up the quill while she explains the contract. I train my focus onto nothing but her voice just to keep myself from getting distracted by the mere idea of enrolling into the legendary school of Hogwarts. The school of my dreams. “by signing this, you’ll be accepting that the origins of you and your powers must stay hidden at all costs. You’re not to utter even a single explaining word about your ‘condition’, <em>am I clear?</em>” her aggressive undertone makes my skin crawl as she watches me closely, marking my every movement and breath, I’m sure. 
This woman is frighteningly intense.<br/>
“yes, professor Parrish.” I mumble as I fidget with the feather of the pen between my fingers. She clearly doesn’t seem too convinced as she starts repeating herself: “you’re not to speak or write even a single explanation to anyone here in my school, under no circumstances whatsoever. And if you do, <em>this</em> will let me know immediately.” She gently taps the top of the parchment with a bony white finger, forcing my attention to travel from her piercing blue gaze, to look down at the contract.<br/>
Seconds ago, I was so ready to just write my name and then accept the consequences of that some other time, but she makes it sound so grave, which scares me. I know that people might react badly to the news of my powers, so I was prepared to keep it a secret anyway, but this is a bit more extreme than what I had imagined. “I promise not to tell, professor.” I want to swallow my words even before I finish saying them because Parrish doesn’t seem happy with just that. “your verbal promise isn’t enough; I need it on paper.”<br/>
She turns her back on me and starts pacing back and forth right in front of me as if she’s impatient and want this to be over with just as much as I do, but out of fear that she might somehow now what I’m thinking, I shut out everything and zoom in on the little line that says <em>‘signature’</em> at its beginning, in the very bottom of the paper.<br/>
The sooner I’m out of here, the better. Parrish is too intense for me and it makes my stomach curl, even though she is the living miracle-maker of my dreams. What a complicated admiration I have for her...<br/>
I tighten my grip on the quill, dip the tip into the ink bottle, which conveniently opened the lid by itself, and then write my signature with delicate letters. As soon as I finish the last swirl and lift the tip off the paper, the parchment, bottle and pen all vanish as quickly as they had appeared mere minutes ago. “good, now go down to the hallway again and you’ll find that the caretaker has brought your suitcase to your new dorm room. This---“, a golden ribbon from Parrish pocket flies out at her command and lays itself down on the table, right in front of me, “---will lead you to it. Just follow the ribbon. Should be easy enough.”<br/>
Parrish is already on her way up to her massive desk and chair, as if dismissing me from the office, but as I reach the oaken door, I look over my shoulder and see that she has seated herself in the massive clawfooted chair behind the massive desk. 
She looks devastatingly beautiful in all her golden glory as she just sits there, watching me with a careful expression on her face. Our eyes meet again. 
Blue clashes with green. “one wrong step and we’ll have to talk again, Norah Winters. Enjoy Hogwarts and enjoy Slytherin.”</p>
