          <div class="userstuff"><p class="md-end-block">On Monday morning, the Queen fell ill;</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">on Tuesday morning, she wrote her will;</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">on Wednesday morning, the doctors said,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">"She'll be in pain, and then be dead."</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">The King didn't let this be a bother: </span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">after one wife, there comes another.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">And all in all, he said with wit,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">he was the Eighth - she but the sixth.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">His people whispered, the wise took heed,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">could it be poison that did the deed?</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">But why use poison, someone would ask,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">when two queens' necks had met the axe?</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">Yet sure enough, the strangest things</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">would happen now there were no queens.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">The voices whispered a black-clad maid</p><p class="md-end-block">had grabbed the King and had him swayed.</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">Plink, plink, went the blood,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">dripping down into the mud.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">Young Mary's head could not be found,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">until they went to check the hound.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">Plink, plink, went the oil,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">dripping down into the soil.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">Little Liz was roasted well,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">as scorched as the souls in Hell.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">Plink, plink, went the rain,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">dripping down into the drain.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">Eddie floated, purple with bloat,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">the moat a sea, and he its boat.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">And so a King with no more heirs,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">with too much fat, too many cares,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">must do what he knows must be done,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">and find a wife to give him a son.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">A wife he found, he knew the drift:</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">in fact he was awfully swift.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">A black-clad maid with endless guile,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">light dancing hands, the sharpest smile.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">"She'll be my Queen!", the King said,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">and since they all loved their head</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">they kept their counsel, and went along</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">with what they felt was awfully wrong.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">For the black-clad maid gave them a chill,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">her hungry eyes were forged of steel;</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">but when she spoke, her voice did sooth</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">all of their doubts about the truth.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">One word she said, no need for more:</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">they'd go to sea, they'd go to war,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">they'd walk and conquer lands unseen,</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">they'd give their life for their new Queen.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block"> </p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">"My lords," she spoke, "it is a joy</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">to have you be my faithful toy.</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block">
  <span class="">This wife won't be like the first six,</span>
</p><p class="md-end-block md-focus">
  <span class="md-expand">so pleased to meet you: I'm Bellatrix."</span>
