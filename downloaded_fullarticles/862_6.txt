  <b>. . . Flash Forward . . .</b>
</p><p>Hermione winced from the light, rolling over in bed to avoid it stinging her eyes. She quickly regretted this action because it caused a pulsing pain in her head; she chided herself never to drink again. Rubbing her forehead, she tried to recall the reason she had been drinking in the first place. <em> Oh right, the company Christmas do. </em></p><p>Sitting up slowly, attempting not to worsen her headache, her hair draped over her eyes, useful at least to block out some of the light. As she sat hunched over, she noticed that the sheets that covered her legs were not hers, nor was this bed. Staring down at the grey covers, she concluded, <em> Oh right, I'm at Ginny's </em>.</p><p>As she stretched, something began to slip down the side of her body. Looking down, she realized that it was a towel, and it was the only thing between her and her nudity. Gasping quietly, she urgently pulled it back up, hoping in her modesty that Ginny was still asleep beside her and did not get a private show. She squinted her eyes, curious as to why she did not borrow a nightgown from her friend.</p><p>She glanced over to see the space beside her, empty. At first Hermione was relieved, but then she remembered that Harry had recently moved in with Ginny. She chastised herself for taking the couple’s bed; they were likely to be out on the couch in the living room.</p><p>Sleepily looking to the floor for her missing clothes, Hermione’s gaze paused at a pair of chair legs, which bracketed a pair of bare feet. Hermione flinched back, startled, gripping the sheets close to her body. Her eyes peeked past her hands as she remained slouched, hoping she did not wake whoever had occupied the chair. </p><p>Gaining the courage to sit up slightly, she scanned the figure fully. Immediately she clamped her hand over her mouth, muffling her breath. The chair was occupied by someone completely unexpected, but thankfully they appeared to be in a deep slumber. She took this opportunity to study him, watching his bare chest rise and fall. Glancing around the room to be sure there was no one else to witness her, she leaned forward to see if he was fully clothed. There was a brief relief to find that he was still wearing pajama bottoms. She, on the other hand, did not have anything on her bottom. Clenching her towel even tighter around her body, she was unable to decide on what to do next.</p><p>The throbbing in her temple intensified from the shock, and she reflected on what she had drunk the night before. This attempt to recall the nightl made her panic, because she found a series of disconnected memories from the Ministry Christmas do. The internal questions that held no answers nearly made her sick. <em> Why am I naked? How did I get here? What in the name of Godric’s ghost happened last night?  </em></p><p>
  <b>. . . Day of the Office Christmas Do . . .</b>
</p><p>Hermione paced up to the canteen near her Ministry office, eager to get some caffeine in her system before having to listen to another one of Harry’s seminars on how to avoid another dark lord uprising. Over a decade had passed since their school days, and now they were all in top positions at the Ministry. Harry had his heart in the right place, but requiring a bimonthly attendance was a bit excessive. If only he had been this diligent in his classes back at Hogwarts. </p><p>There was plenty of pushback by colleagues on spacing out his seminars, but he persisted on their importance; his counter-argument being that dark wizards tended to gain a foothold exactly when no one was paying attention.</p><p>Distracted by her thoughts on what Harry would bring to the table today, she wandlessly levitated a clean mug from a high shelf above, narrowly avoiding an office memo zipping past her arm. </p><p>As Hermione made her way to the small coffee machine that reliably sat on a spindly-legged table, she stood aghast to find a huge work of machinery filling an entire wall instead. This was a monster of a contraption, with intertwining bronze pipes, and gadgets and nozzles galore. She hesitated, studying it closely, just wanting a simple coffee. After a few moments, she nearly gave up, but internally chastised herself,<em> I must learn new things, plus I really need something extra today. I just don’t know why we need something this fancy.  </em></p><p>She scanned the large ‘coffee machine’, inspecting every option available until she finally discovered the switches to use for a simple breakfast drip. After tinkering with button pressing and knob twisting, it began to make erratic ticking noises. This was followed by ridiculous musical whistles, all before it finally started to percolate. Realizing that she was still holding onto her mug, she hastily jogged to the very end of the machine to place the cup under a very tiny spout. </p><p>Eagerly waiting for the large machine to fill her cup, she was startled to hear someone clearing their throat behind her. Turning to glance at who else was in the room, she quickly turned back again to face the coffee machine upon discovering who it was. She was not mentally prepared to deal with <em> him </em> . Perhaps he was not clearing his throat <em> at her </em> ; she tried to reason. After all, it did not take her <em> that </em> long to conquer the beastly coffee machine towering before her. Maybe he did not even see her struggle, at least not from where he was sitting, some hidden nook in the canteen. He sat leaning back in his chair at a cafe table with the Daily Prophet blocking his face. Just the sight of his platinum blond hair slicked back with pride made her feel as if he was judging her already. Hermione tapped her foot anxiously, trying to rid her mind of the image of his long fingers holding some part of her anatomy, instead of the newspaper they currently gripped. </p><p>Tightening her eyes, she immediately became annoyed with herself. <em> It’s too early for such things Hermione.  </em></p><p>Still her cheeks grew warm from the off the color thoughts of him that she pushed far back in her mind. He had become more mature, and with that, new memories of him began to replace ones from the past.  When she was able to block those more seditious and far fetched thoughts, she then grew more embarrassed that perhaps he had observed her childish discovery of the Ministry’s exuberant coffee maker. He always caught her at her most vulnerable moments such as these. Like the time she was unable to control a slew of memos that had gotten out of control, and he spelled them to pause mid air right before they dove into her hair. It was not often that people saw her in a state of confusion, why did it have to be him? In those briefest of moments she found that he was kind and observed a sort of softness in his eyes, but it all changed when a coworker was present, and he was back to teasing her. Maybe he did not change after all. Hermione sighed. Perhaps she did not either, because it was unlike her to treat anyone differently, especially in a professional setting. Had another coworker passed her, she would have greeted them with respect, so she took a deep breath, she muttered as politely as she could muster, </p><p>"Malfoy..."</p><p>Still facing the large coffee machine, she heard him adjust the newspaper as he replied smoothly, </p><p>"Granger..."</p><p>His voice was low, and only then did she somehow manage to detect the musk of his cologne over the brewing coffee. She was not sure if she associated the notes of cedarwood to the sound of his voice, or if she really could detect his scent. </p><p>Not wanting to make conversation, she kept her eyes on her coffee mug waiting for it to fill. She glared at the ridiculous coffee maker, mentally willing the blasted machine to move faster. Finally the steamy liquid streamed into her mug and she grabbed the handle to pick it up as soon as it was full. The tiny refrigerator that sat nearby appeared pathetic now, completely overshadowed by the giant contraption. </p><p>Just as she was about to grab the handle of the refrigerator, Draco grazed past her. She suspected he did that on purpose, nearly spilling the overdue cup of coffee she possessed. It stood to reason that he did this in an attempt to show his dominance from their last bickering session, because there was plenty of walking space in the kitchen, regardless of the wall to wall contraptions. Why did he always try to pick a fight over useless information with her in every meeting? Was it just to rile her up? Remind everyone where they stood? She did her best to appear professional though, never complaining to Harry, though perhaps a bit too much to Ginny.</p><p>Brushing him off, and wanting to get out as soon as possible, she began to hope that they would not be out of cream - one of her pet peeves. Opening the door as wide as possible, as if it would help her search, she strained to recognize the little white carton of creamer amongst juice bottles and a few questionable chinese takeout boxes, grumbling in despair, "Seriously, who keeps using it all up?"</p><p>Draco turned slightly as he made his way back to the table. "Just make tea, and use the milk like everyone else.”<br/><br/>Hermione grew frustrated, it was true that she was one of the rare few that enjoyed a bit of cream in her coffee at the Ministry. So who would kept using it up? Of course, the massive band of tea drinkers always had milk readily available to them. When she thought on it further, she was possibly one of the first to use the ridiculous coffee contraption, unless Malfoy had already. She scowled, glancing to the adjacent wall that contained another outrageously complicated machine for the tea drinkers. Who would be using the cream then? </p><p>Draco continued as he sat back down, rustling his newspaper, “Surely you can have one cup of coffee without cream, Granger."</p><p>Frustrated that someone as spoiled as a Malfoy would imply that she <em> go without </em>, she closed the door to the refrigerator, rounding on him. "How did you know- Oh, was it you then?"</p><p>Draco sat down, lifting his nearly matching coffee mug as proof, "No, I drink mine <em> black </em>."</p><p>Hermione sneered back, "Figures..."</p><p>Draco mumbled to himself as he lifted his paper up to read again, "Don’t be so bitter.”</p><p>A wave of heat radiated within her, as Hermione did not see herself as a bitter person; she just liked things a certain way. He would not win another work spat between them - not today. She had a long day stretched ahead of her, and she just wanted a blasted cup of coffee <em> with </em> cream. </p><p>Walking up to his table, she leaned down, touching the tip of the newspaper to make eye contact for emphasis, then gestured to his cup of black coffee, "Bitter? Funny, since it appears, that is <em> exactly </em> how you like it." </p><p>His eyes slowly trailed from her finger where it dented the top edge of his paper, until his grey eyes met with hers. Proudly, and before she could ruin her own sass, she tilted her head, turning to walk away toward the sink. Confidently she poured out her drink, curtly placing the mug down and began walking out of the room, having decided to get coffee elsewhere. Though she expected him to be highly annoyed from her retort, he did not reply as quickly as usual. Momentarily breaking her ‘smooth’ exit, she peeked back to see his reaction. It was curious, to find him grinning into his mug before he took a sip of his coffee.</p><p>
  <b>. . . Mid-Morning . . . </b>
</p><p>Finally, after back to back meetings that left her feeling like she wasted her morning, she was able to break away, specifically to the ladies room. Hastily, she entered a stall to use the loo, and just as she locked the door, she heard the clicking of heels from the entrance of the bathroom. Hermione deduced there were two witches; she heard one woman use Draco’s name as they entered. This of course caused Hermione to freeze, listening quietly to their conversation.</p><p>"Nora, I think you’re missing the point."</p><p>"Oh please, enlighten me, Jadis."</p><p>"Draco is <em> always </em> late. He thinks he can just get off on his good looks and inheritance, and now that he's the head of his department- I should have never approved it."</p><p>"Jadis, you weren't the only one who chose to put him there. Relax. You are still <em> the boss </em>."</p><p>"Yes well, then I shouldn't just <em> let him </em> come in late without consequences. <em> This </em> is a professional workplace. It insults us <em> all </em> that an <em> ex-Death Eater </em> comes in and does what he likes, when he likes."</p><p>"Well, do what you must! Hey, if you do it before the Christmas party, I can swoop in with some sympathy, if you know what-"</p><p>"Yes, unfortunately I do know what you mean. I don't know what you see in him. I don't think he belongs here, so maybe... he won’t any longer.” There was a short pause until she continued, “Bloody hell, another Potter seminar, we better hurry or he’ll conclude that being <em> late </em> is some sort of <em> dark magic </em>."</p><p>Hermione heard their faint giggles and the clatter of their heels retreating as the bathroom door swung open and closed again from their exit.</p><p>After using the loo, she creaked open her door, now in deep thought, approaching the sink to wash her hands. <em> I should warn him. </em> Pausing as the water ran through her fingers, she looked up into the mirror at her reflection. <em> What good will that do? He did this to himself. </em> She turned the tap off, walking over to dry her hands on a disposable paper towel, still debating, <em> It's not like she can really fire him for being late, the protocol would be to issue a warning first. </em>Then it occurred to her that maybe she already had. </p><p>Not truly aware of how long she might have been standing there, Hermione was startled by someone entering the bathroom. She wadded up the paper towel and tossed it into a bin. <em> Don’t involve yourself, stay out of it. </em> As she left the bathroom, she wavered, scanning the office, her eyes studying the the stairs that led down to Draco’s office. Frustrated, she sighed to herself, <em> Why am I like this? </em></p><p>
  <b>. . . Later that day . . . </b>
</p><p>There was a heavy knocking at Hermione's office door and she responded, "Come in..."</p><p>Looking up, she wandlessly paused her Quick Quill to find Draco opening the door. "Granger, you wanted to see me?"</p><p>She straightened up slightly, folding her hands on her desk. "Yes. Please, come in."</p><p>When he stood waiting, Hermione gestured for him to sit down and he reluctantly obeyed, taking the guest seat in front of her desk. "Granger, this better be good. You’re aware that no one <em> actually </em> works on the day of office parties, right?"</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath to calm herself. "Look Malfoy, I think you ought to… try to be on time for meetings from now on."</p><p>Draco looked away, shaking his head, clearly miffed by the topic. "Did you <em> seriously </em> bring me here to <em> lecture </em> me, Granger?” He stood up abruptly, shoving his hands into his pockets. “You know, you're not my boss, <em> right </em>?"</p><p>Hermione stood up to match his stance. "I certainly know that Draco but-"</p><p>"I know you <em> wish </em> you could be, so you can have some kind of <em> control </em>over me-"</p><p>Again, that wave of heat radiated throughout her. "That is <em> not </em> why I-"</p><p>A knock at the already opened door interrupted her, and Blaise popped his head in. "Hey you two, at it again? Sorry, just going to steal Draco. We're about to leave for the Christmas do."</p><p>Draco glanced back at Blaise, then back toward Hermione,</p><p>"We done here, Granger? Don't be late, blah blah blah..." He wafted his hand in the air as if to wandlessly wisp the topic aside.</p><p>As she opened her mouth to respond, he was already striding away; Blaise gave her an unsure look before he followed behind Draco. </p><p>Hermione bit the inside of her lip, wondering if there was anyone near enough to hear her scream, or if she should place a silencing charm and just let it all out.</p><p>
  <em> Forget it, I'm never going to bother warning him again. If he could only just shut his face and let me finish! </em>
</p><p>She fell into her chair, slightly startled when another visitor approached her door. To her relief it was only Ginny. "Hermione, you ready? Everyone is leaving, I heard the Ministry went all out this year-oh hey, what's the matter?"</p><p>"Oh nothing, just… <em> Malfoy </em>..." she grumbled under her breath.</p><p>Ginny held her bag close to her, clearly ready to leave work already; instead she politely settled in the seat Draco had briefly occupied only a minute ago. </p><p>"Right, what happened this time?"</p><p>"I just tried to help him and-” her voice began to rise, before she caught herself, closed her eyes, and paused to take a deep breath in through her nose, letting it back out through pursed lips. Ginny didn’t deserve the rage that was beginning to explode within her. “There is no helping him, I swear!”</p><p>"Whoa, help him with what?"</p><p>Hermione caught Ginny up on the bathroom chat from Draco's boss, and Ginny appeared overly shocked by the information. "Oh, and you tried to warn him? That was actually really sweet of you."</p><p>At first Hermione was more than happy for her friend’s empathy, but she paused, inspecting Ginny’s behavior, as she appeared almost too easy in her support. Perhaps Ginny just wanted to get to the party.</p><p>"Well, it doesn't matter, he can dig his own grave, I'm not going to get my hands dirty."</p><p>Ginny stood up, leaving her bag in the chair, and walked over to Hermione, getting close enough to pet her hair gently. Hermione scrunched her nose at the gesture, as Ginny quietly spoke, "Hermione, you say the same thing, every time. Can you just admit that there is something going on there?"</p><p>Hermione edged away from Ginny’s hand, half suspicious of her, and half annoyed at how right she was. Quite possibly, Ginny was fed up with Hermione's denial, and hearing all the repetitive complaints. "Right… I just…” Letting out a moan, Hermione began to rub her forehead. “I just don't want to say it out loud. I’m not <em> there </em>, yet.”</p><p>Sighing loudly, Ginny shifted her hand to Hermione’s shoulder. "The deepest truth burns on the way up, Hermione."</p><p>Hermione cocked her head, assessing the other witch, then chose to respond blandly, "Right, thanks for that Ginny. You're so wise."</p><p>"Fear makes the wolf bigger than he actually is."</p><p>Hermione’s hands fell onto her desk, sure that she knew what was going on. "Right, how much have you had to drink already?"</p><p>Ginny swayed, smiling lightheartedly. "To not know, is the pinnacle of imagination."</p><p>Unfortunately, her friend was only half invested in this so-called dilemma. Getting up to collect her things, she grabbed Ginny’s arm to guide her out. "Alright Socrates, let's go."</p>
