    <p>
  <span>Madison stared at the book, trying to get the words to register in her mind, but she wasn't succeeding. No matter how hard she fought to get them out of her head, thoughts of the war kept invading, making it difficult to concentrate. How was anybody supposed to do anything anymore? She could still hear the echo of screams and the sound of her father dying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a groan she snapped the book shut, tossing it onto the floor and leaning back against the wall behind her mattress. The refugee home was, she knew, a safe haven for muggleborns like herself but eventually you-know-who would find out where it was, and when he did, every single person in that house was doomed to die. Painlessly, but they would die just the same.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With Harry Potter, Dumbledore, and the minister dead, it was all only a matter of time. There was no one left to fight the death eaters except small pockets of resistance, but they were slowly getting weeded out. The house she was sitting in at that moment was the last one, other than the Order, and it was almost empty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Somewhere, in another room, was the rightful head of Hogwarts, Minerva McGonagall, but instead the school was being run by Dolores Umbridge, the woman who'd begun the prosecution of muggleborns and half breeds. Nobody could believe when she was first given the job of helping shape the next generation of the English magical community, and many had protested, but she'd been there for four years now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A knock on the door finally pulled her from her thoughts and she stood, opening it just a crack. Standing on the other side was Molly Weasley, the founder of the house. "Hey," Madison said, opening the door further. "Um, was there something you needed, Mrs. Weasley?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes dear, I was wondering if you might come down? Theodore Nott is here to see you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theodore Nott. That was a name she hadn't heard in almost two years. They'd gone to school together, him in Slytherin and her in Ravenclaw, but they'd never spoken until he'd left you-know-who's side, not even an hour before it was discovered Potter had been killed, and had to flee. She too was fleeing, and they went together. They spent a year in a cabin, just the two of them, but he'd decided that hiding wasn't for him, and had gone to rejoin the fight. She hadn't seen him since. Letters were too dangerous, and he didn't visit. Their brief romance was, it seemed, over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Theo?" She could only stare at the woman who'd saved dozens of muggleborn lives. "Did he say why he was here?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The once-redheaded older woman shook her head. "No. Just that he wished to see you." She went to move past her, but Mrs. Weasley gently touched her arm. "He's changed, dear, do be prepared. He's in the dining room."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Madison walked slowly down the stairs to the first floor. The refugee home used to be the home of Remus Lupin before he'd died, and the home had passed to his son, Teddy, and Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks, who had in turn given the place over to the Weasleys after her death. It was a grand home, roughly half the size of Hogwarts, but only she and three other people still lived there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Theo?" She entered the dining room, and saw him seated at the huge table. She couldn't help it; she grinned. "Hey."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiled at her sadly, his face pale. " It is good to see you," he murmured, slowly standing up with a wince. "It's been too long." He took a step in her direction and stumbled. She rushed to his side, aiding him back to his seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What happened to you?" she whispered, sitting down next to him and taking both his hands in hers. "You're..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Different?" he let out a snort, much like his old self. He cleared his throat. "Dark magic. A curse in the same family as the Cruciatus curse, but it lingers more, stays in the body for months after. I've been sent here to recover."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sent by who?" She didn't know who was running the Order of the Phoenix anymore, or if even the Order still existed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Weasley. Ron," he added. "He's a good strategist, he and Granger both are leading now. Everyone else is either dead, here, or joined them."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh," she said quietly, biting her lip. "I hadn't- I didn't know." They were silent for a moment. "Who cursed you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Lucius Malfoy."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That bastard," Maddie murmured, shaking her head slowly. She had never met Lucius Malfoy in person, but she'd heard about him, the things he had done. His name was connected to some of the more brutal muggle murders that had made the papers before you-know-who had completely taken over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next silence was broken by Percy Weasley entering, a heavy book in his arms. "Hello Percy."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Evening." He dropped the book down at the table and sat across from them, looking serious. "I'm glad you're here, Theodore. Madison."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Madison raised her eyebrows. She and Percy didn't exactly get along. He'd been several years above her in school, and once he graduated, he'd joined the Ministry. She didn't think she'd exchanged ten words with him in all the years they'd lived in the same house, so it actually came as a surprise he knew her name, let alone was pleased to see her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why's that?" Theo questioned, leaning forward to peer at the book. He saw the title and let out a snort. "Time travel?" He asked the practical Weasley. "Why in the name of Merlin are you reading about that?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I've found a spell," Percy stated, pushing up his glasses. "One that would end the war."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"A time travel spell?" Madison was shaking her head. "Percy, the past is set, we can't change it. Even with time turners, it's already happened before you make the decision to go back an hour or two. Besides, there are no time turners left."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I said a spell, not an object." He flipped open the book and slid it across the table. Madison stared at the page, reading and rereading it. "With this spell, our souls would go back in time, not our bodies. We could stop you-know-who before he returns." He looked over at Theo. "You were with my brother searching for his horcruxes, were you not?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theo nodded, looking thoughtful. "I was. But we never found them all, and gave up about a year ago. Ron decided to just try and eliminate as many of the death eaters as we can before regrouping and trying again."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Horcruxes?" Madison looked between the blonde and the redhead, confused. "What are horcruxes?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theo tightened his grip on her hand. "They're pieces of his soul, Maddie. With them, he can't be killed. Not permanently. It's how he was able to come back eight years ago." He looked back over at Percy. "I don't know what that has to do with - Oh."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy nodded, an intent look on his face. "If we do this, we'll be able to find the horcruxes he had before his return, and destroy them. He'll be able to be killed. It'll be difficult, but I think we could do it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why us though?" Madison questioned. "I mean, Theo knows where they are, but why not an adult? Or... rather, someone who would be an adult then? We'll be children if we go back before he returns. At least Theo and I will be. You graduated the year before."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If the spell fails," Percy said, pulling the book back towards him. "We could die. And the adults here are needed to keep this safe haven running. Without it, more people would die." He paused. "But if we don't even try, what then? What if the spell doesn't fail? What if we succeed? Thousands of people have died in the past five years, wizards and muggles alike, that's thousands of lives we could save. Harry, Dumbledore, my brothers, my sister-" He looked sad. Only he and Ron were left of the seven Weasley children.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay, great, then why me? You two seem like you have it handled. I mean, yes, if it would work, I want to do it, but I don't understand why you want me to."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Three heads are always better than two, right?" Percy grinned at her. "Here was my idea."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How long have you been thinking about this?" Theo interrupted. "It sounds like you've given this a bunch of thought, how'd you even know I was going to be here?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Trelawney." Madison made a face, and Percy sighed. "She's not as much of a fraud as people think. She foresaw you coming here."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay," Madison sighed this time. "Let's hear your idea."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If we go before you two begin at Hogwarts, you'll be able to be sorted differently." They both stared at him. "Theodore, if you ask the sorting hat to put you in Gryffindor, it will. And Madison, a muggleborn in Slytherin would go very far in helping relations."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you joking?" Madison stood up, knocking her chair back and shaking her head. "I am not going into Slytherin. I'll go into Gryffindor, gladly, but I'll be killed if I'm sorted into Slytherin."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"She's right," Theo said. "Some of the older students would kill her, and make it look like an accident. Not many would risk it, mind you, but one or two might."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If we're going to do this, let's all stick together," Madison begged. "Gryffindor, all of us. Theo would still have connections in Slytherin, a lot of the people he grew up with are sorted there, like Draco Malfoy, and that way we could help each other." She sank back into her chair. "Are we- are we actually talking about time travel?" She couldn't help but feel a little overwhelmed. "Are we seriously debating this?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am," Percy told her. "I'm in for this, whether the two of you are or not. You know who is winning. Hell, he's won. We could stop that from happening. We could win instead."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay," Madison said after a long silence. "I'll do it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theo let out a deep breath. "I'm in," he said finally. "You knew I would be, I'm sure, but yeah, I'll help. Problem is, my magic isn't very strong at the moment."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We'll find a way to work around that," was Percy's response. He peered at the book. "Now, it looks like a complicated spell, but the main question is, are the two of you willing to be resorted? If so, that sets us back two years. If you'd rather stay in Slytherin and Ravenclaw, we can return to after I graduated, when the two of you are starting your fourth year. You could help Potter more that year."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But he won't trust us," Madison pointed out. "I never once spoke to Potter while at Hogwarts. I was preoccupied with my studies and Granger annoyed me. If we want his trust, we would have to go back before we get sorted, otherwise -"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Potter hated me. Course, I was a right git back then," Theo said, with a little grin. "I agree with Maddie. I'm prepared to be sorted into Gryffindor. My father won't like it, I'm sure, but considering I no longer give a damn what he thinks, it doesn't matter."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So we have to go before you get sorted. We agreed?" Madison and Theo nodded. "Let's get started then."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wait, we're doing this now?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"With you-know-who out there, we may not get another chance," Theo stated, looking her in the eyes. "If we want to do this, we're going to have to do it now." </span>
