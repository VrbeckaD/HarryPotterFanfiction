    <p>Harry was just about to say no to Voldemort, to spit all sorts of insults and defilement, when he reminded himself of what Luna had said to him about his temper, and he counted to ten. Then he stopped to really think about the Dark Lords offer, and decided that, actually, it wasn't that bad. </p><p>Being the blind Boy Who Lived absolutely sucked, after all. For goodness sake, he had been entered into the TriWizard Tournament! Who in their right mind would enter a blind fifteen year old into a deadly competition! And had any of the professors tried to help? Had Dumbledore? No, no they had not! In fact, Harry was fairly certain that they expected him to somehow announce his blindness was a ruse, whip off his dark glasses, and suddenly see, just to suit their weird expectations and to win the competition for Hogwarts. And then they probably wanted him to march right off to fight the Dark Lord, too. </p><p>Well, too bad for them. Because somehow, aside from Luna, Volde- bloody-mort was the first person in the wizarding world to neither treat him as an incompetent, like Snape or the other professors and the headmaster, nor expect the world of him, like pretty much everyone else. No, he had talked decently to him, after of course having someone cut up Harry's arm for some reason that Harry couldn't see, pun intended. </p><p>And it said something pretty bad about the Wizarding world if the only ones who could talk decently to a blind boy was a dreamy, half crazed Ravenclaw, and the evil overlord who had made said boy blind in the first place, because apparently it was the overlord's idea of a fun night to destroy himself and leave scars all over an one year old boy's eyes in the process. </p><p>".... yeah, alright. Sure. I'll join you. But let me clarify; I get to kill the Weasley girl." The little brat had attempted to smash his glasses in third year, insisting that they were the only reason he couldn't see, and that obviously he wasn't really blind, he was too perfect for that, and anyways, their love would heal anything! Bullocks. Plus, the whole diary incident in second year hadn't impressed him to her much either. As opposed to the diary, which had greatly impressed him with its apparent ability to transform it's written replies into any language it's reader spoke, including even braille. Pity it had been evil, he'd have preferred to keep it as a sensible companion in a place where he was surrounded by mentally challenged walking wizard cliche's. </p><p>And speaking of second year, what sort of headmaster even let something like a giant snake slither about when there were blind students around? Harry could have met eyes with the thing and not even noticed. Or for that matter, what sort of person could allow a possessed teacher to teach, an escaped convict and a bunch of dementers to be on the grounds, or allow this competition to take place in the first place, and still call himself a competent adult? Idiot. </p><p>Oh, yes, joining Voldemort would be fun, Harry decided and walked towards where he was fairly certain the Dark Lord stood, the other stunned into silence by his actual agreement. After all, maybe if someone sensible was finally in charge, they would at least put warning rails on those devilish staircases.</p>
