    <p>Harry looked happily at the entrance to his land, a pokemon ranch for pokemon breeding and research into it. The now seventeen year old couldn’t believe he’d done it, when he’d ended here at age fourteen after the resurrection of Voldy... he hadn’t known what to do.</p><p> </p><p>This world.. was a paradise for him, sure he missed his world but here.. he was himself.</p><p> </p><p>“Mine, all mine,” he said happily, seeing his pokemon explore there new home.</p><p> </p><p>Charizard nudged him gently, its fiery scent surrounding him.</p><p> </p><p>He knew about the pokemon world, heck it was a game in his world. But it was also quite different, for pokemon breeder bred themselves with pokemon and carried the young. Not all humans could breed with pokemon, and had to prove that they could breed.</p><p> </p><p>Twenty years ago a plague had wiped out a lot of pokemons ability to breed with other pokemon.</p><p> </p><p>He blushed remembering his test, and how amazing the test pokemon had been.</p><p> </p><p><a name="firstHeading" id="firstHeading"></a> He placed a hand on his belly, swollen heavy with <span>Haxorus’</span><span>s child, becausee of movement and how long the pregnancy he knew this first pregnancy would not be an egg.</span></p><p> </p><p>
