  <strong>Harry P.O.V.</strong>
</p><p>After war things seem to be getting better for us. Ron and Hermione are together despite their quarrels. As we expected, Hermione wanted for us to go back for our seventh year, but Ron and I both had enough of school. That so we started working towards being an Auror. After fighting with Voldemort for 7 years I guess it was expected of us. Hermione, being herself, went through the seventh year and joined the Ministry and now is working for her SPEW campaign. After two years of pushing, she finally got a law pass in that lets elves have a day off. And as for Ginny, she started playing seeker for England's Wizarding team and excelling.</p><p>As for me and Ginny, we did get back together after the war. Everything was going well between us, but there was a couple of things. We would fight. Fight about things that did not bother or even matter to us before the war. Like the money, she wants to move to a place that is huge while I want to get a place that is cozy and comfortable. Then there is the fame or what I like to call it "The wizarding world that can't stop asking what Harry Potter is doing these days." Ginny loves the idea of people and journalists following us, I do not. But this is not the only things that make me feel uncertain about our relationship. I first heard it when Ron and I were about to go on a mission:</p><p>That day Ginny and I had one of our fights but I decided to be the bigger person and tried to let it go.  Later Ron and I walk past a group of our colleagues talking. That when I heard my colleagues discuss Ginny. I swear I heard one of them say that 'Ginny was a nice shag maybe the best.' That was the reason enough for me to lose my temper and go and confront them but, Ron was there. He stopped me by convincing me that it was not my Ginny they were talking about. I let it go once more, just to stay positive.</p><p>Now a few days later, I'm in Three Broomsticks to have some firewhisky and I'm seated beside a group of France's Quidditch team, and I'm hearing the same talks. This time I know that they are talking about Ginny. It was the only Ginny that they associated with England's Quidditch team. I left the Three Broomsticks that day not wanting another headline for the Daily Prophet.</p><p>Days later Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and I went to a ball for the fallen of the war. Ginny and I pose for every camera that wanted a picture of the 'blissfully in love hero and his beautiful girlfriend,' but after a while, she disappeared. I asked around to everyone, but no one in the ballroom knew. I run out to the hallway looking back and forth and only found Hermione listening through a closet door. I go up to her and ask if she has seen Ginny. She answers with a finger pointed to the door. Moans and groans come from the closet that sounds highly like Ginny's voice and someone else's. Before I swing the door open in rage, Hermione grabbed on my arm and looked into my eyes with a pleading look of help.</p><p>With all my blinding fury and impatience, I ignored her and open the closet door. Hermione and I found Ginny and some other bloke in a very embarrassing position. Well embarrassing for them but heartbreaking and insulting for me. I immediately run off and apparate back to 12 Grimmauld Place, with a voice calling out my name from Hermione. I had no time to talk to any of them that night.</p><p>It might have been for the first time that I was so disheartened after getting proven right. I didn't hear from Ginny until the next day. I guess she wanted me to cool down before being in her presence again.</p><p>When she met me again she was pleading, proving that this was not her first rodeo and she had been sorry.</p><p>"Listen, Harry, I'm so sorry."</p><p>"Ginny, don't think you should come back here ever again," I demanded.</p><p>"What are you saying, Harry?" Ginny stressed. "Are you breaking up with me?"</p><p>I said nothing in response. I was fed up with everything she has put me through.</p><p>"Okay, fine Harry. I'll leave, but you will regret this."</p><p>With watery eyes, I saw Ginny leaving my house for the final time. As much as I wanted to make myself believe that it was not true, the pain of betrayal was making it impossible to. It was like being hit by the cruciatus curse, again and again. I can't keep myself from wanting to beat myself up for not seeing it sooner.</p><p>Why? Why did I not see this sooner? I was losing my infatuation with her a few weeks ago when she started to stop caring about me, but she was still very pretty and I still loved her dearly. I guess that's the reason why I kept the faith that would work because this was the longest I have been in a relationship. I carried myself to my room and laid down on my bed in a very depressed mood.</p><p>We were starting to work on living together in the now nonexistent future. Quidditch players' posters, our photos at different hotspots, and her clothes from when she used to come for an overnight stay. <em>Ugh!</em> This hurts more than it should. This thinking of people like Malfoy bragging their affairs to my face makes me sick to my stomach. There's a photo of us on my end table near the bed. Repulsed by it I turn it face down and told myself to burn it later.</p><p>I rolled over to my side and stared out the window as I thought to myself all the good times Ginny and I had together, but it was getting harder as I started reminiscing our time. Then I realized that Ginny and I had started to put together vials of our best memories to rewatch in the pensieve when things got sour or dyer. This was the only saving grace to the relationship I had.</p><p>I got up out of my bed and went to the pensieve room down the hall. Scanning the cabinet of vials, I found a vial with her handwriting saying "Morning After." I smiled a little at the title and remembered this was the first time that Ginny and I shagged. I poured the contains into the sitting pensieve in the left side of the room. I dunked my head to watch the scene unfold:</p>

  <strong>After Ginny &amp; Hermione's graduation, 1999 </strong>
</p><p>Ginny and Harry were together in bed in her room back at the Burrow. Her sheets pulled over them and</p><p>"I am happy that you liked also for charming your room because your moans were loud and most certainly someone would have known what we were up to."</p><p>"Maybe we could go to your place later and we could have more fun there."</p><p>"Yes!" I agreed as I got up and found my clothes on the floor, and headed to the loo.</p><p>"I'll go out first so one will notice." I wince as I notice my head getting heavier. "I think I am getting a small headache. Do you have any potions for a headache?"</p><p>"Just go down stair and I will give it to you when I get there." Ginny smiled sweetly at me. I put on my shirt and pants and walked out to the loo.</p><p>Leaving Ginny alone in her room, she squealed out her excitement. "Harry, you are the best lover I have ever had." She quickly put on her long shirt on and gets up out of her bed to find a potion hiding in her drawer. Then she looked under her bed and grab her diary and started to write. I looked over her shoulder and read what she wrote.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Diary,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I finally did it with Harry last night. He is such a good lover than I ever imagined. My childhood dream is coming true! He is all mine! Now I can't even get enough of our night together of my head. Maybe I'll tell this night to Hermione. Oh, Merlin! I want to feel that again! All I have to do is keep this going! Hope he doesn't notice this at all. I can't have him find out. I will talk later. I am going to meet him downstairs to plan my graduation day together.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>~Ginny</em>
</p><p>The scene started to change before my eyes to the kitchen in The Burrow: my home other than Hogwarts. Mrs. Weasley was cooking breakfast all the while pestering younger Harry about his plans for the day.</p><p>"I think that Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and I are going to either Hogsmeade or something that both Hermione and Ginny would enjoy for their graduation."</p><p>While Harry was having that conversation with Mrs. Weasley, 17-year-old Ginny was coming down the stairs quietly in the hope to not stop the conversation. She scowled and got to Harry as Mrs. Weasley served him a cup of tea. As the conversation continued, Ginny quietly went up to Harry's teacup and poured the potion into the tea. Harry noticed her presence and smiled and kissed her lovingly on the lips. Mrs. Weasley cherished the love that they had for each other. After he took a sip he started looking more content than back in her room a light pink glow going around him soon after.</p><p>"You are simply gorgeous, Ginny" he gushed putting a hand on a side of his face. Gazing at his true love like a young schoolboy staring at his crush.</p><p>"Thank you, Harry." Ginny brightened at those words, "Maybe we should do something as a couple today."</p><p>"Ginny!" Mrs. Weasley warned.</p><p>"What?" Ginny replied to her mother, "It's a potion to help with Harry's headache."</p><p>Mrs. Weasley didn't push any further, but she did have an inquisitive look on her face that said: "I think you're lying."</p><p>"Yes, that sounds fun!" Harry replied.</p><p>The scene changed to Hogsmeade with Ginny and Harry walking hand in hand. As they went into The Three Broomsticks Inn, ordered butterbeer and sat in the corner.</p><p>"Are you going to take the Auror job?" Ginny asked. "I think that you would be brilliant at it!"</p><p>"Really?" He asked. "I was thinking to just lay low for a while."</p><p>"No, don't. You will be great at it! Also, we have to go to the Quidditch World cup this year it is going to be brilliant!"</p><p>"Okay, anything for you! Wait I thought that they canceled it because of the war."</p><p>"Well yes and no. They were going to cancel it if the war continued on, but since it ended it is back on again." She smiled brightly.</p><p>There was a pause. My 18-year-old self was looking at Ginny in awe. It was always like that. She was so brilliant and beautiful that I couldn't keep my eyes or hands off her.</p><p>She blushed at the sight, "Harry, do you want to go back to 12 Grimmauld Place? We can have some time for ourselves and no one has to know."</p><p>"Right now?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Harry paid the tab hastily and practically running out of the Three Broomsticks with Ginny. They apparated to his inherited home of the Black Family. They had a repeat of previous night rendezvous, but without any charms to mask what they were really up to.</p>
<hr/><p>That was a good memory, but why was the conversion with Mrs. Weasley and Ginny so conflicting? What did she think Ginny was doing?</p><p>After watching this memory, I couldn't stand for more. I collapsed on the floor holding my head by both hands.</p><p>What happened actually? Where was the Ginny in the memories? One who was so enamored with the idea of boy-who-lived, who loved me so much that she would fight anyone to win for the man of her dreams…</p>
