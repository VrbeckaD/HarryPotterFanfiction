    <p>The days ended faster and faster. She could tell winter was coming from the ice sharp pains she would get from the cold breeze. She sat on the cold sidewalk begging for spare change. Her aunt still hadn’t returned, and it had been hours. Soon it would be dark, and she knew she wouldn’t survive the night if she didn’t find a place to sleep fast.<br/>
“Hello, there little one.” The tall man stood over her. He stared down at the wild curly brown hair. “It’s freezing, and it is getting late where are your parents?” She looked up to him with big heart stopping green eyes.<br/>
“I don’t have any.” She spoke in a quiet whisper. He froze and glanced up and down the street. Everyone was walking around them minding their own business or just ignoring them.<br/>
“Okay well how about I take you somewhere you’ll get food and stay warm.” She looked up at him not believing a word but desperate for warmth. She took his hand and he smiled and led her to were he promised. At the London town Orphanage, she ate three meals a day and stay warm throughout the night. The man or boy works there after school. His grandmother runs the orphanage and when he graduates college he would be taking over. It was a decent environment for little as everyone has started calling her since no one knew her real name or age, not even her. Everything was okay, but she wanted more, and the dizzy rich pamper prat that just walked in would be perfect.</p><p>Phoebe Heart was in trouble. Her mother was ill but that wasn’t the reason she was worried as she walked to her mother’s manor.<br/>
“Lipsy.” The small elf popped up welcoming her back with a smile. “Take me to my mother.” With a snap, she was in front of her mother’s bedroom. She could feel the dark magic pouring from the doorway. It didn’t scream death but it did make her nervous.<br/>
“Is there anything Lipsy can do for you mistress Heart.”<br/>
“No Lipsy just stay away from mother’s room until you are called for.” The elf bows and disappears. She opens the door and shivers her mother was not happy.<br/>
“Phoebe come closer.” The voice cracked and whined but Phoebe knew better. That was how her mother finished off all her prey.<br/>
“Mother before you start, I should tell you.” The room filled with pressure and Phoebe hit the floor.<br/>
“You should tell me YOU SHOULD TELL ME!” She was furious, and her magic showed it. “You have failed me time and time again. If you don’t give me a reason to allow you to use my money you will find yourself homeless.”<br/>
“Mother do I have to do to prove to you that I am mature and wise enough to stay in your will.” Her mother would threaten it time and time again. Even if she didn’t say it this time doesn’t mean she isn’t thinking about it.<br/>
“I want you married and working. I want a grandchild to love and pamper before I die can you do any of that before the end of the year?” Phoebe knew her mother was serious and freaked out. She didn’t want to work or even marry just yet, so she said the least hate thing on the list.<br/>
“Mother you are a grandmother remember.” Every house elf was loyal to her, so they would lie for her except for Nigs.<br/>
“Lady Heart she be lying she had no child.” But Nigs was old and barely worked anymore. He preferred to stay by my mother’s side and retrieve things she needs and let his son Lipsy do everything.<br/>
“Mother Nigs hasn’t seen her. She has been sickly remember. She is tiny with curly dark brown hair and the loveliest eyes you will ever see.” She was freaking out even more since she couldn’t even have children where was, she going to find one.<br/>
“Really then bring her here I wish to meet her.”<br/>
“Of course, mother. I’ll drop by this weekend. I wouldn’t want to disturber her education.” She gave her mother a kiss and fled the room. Making plans to visit the local Orphanages for a child. As long she supplied the basic needs to it then she would be fine. It also has to be a magical child. “Shit, what am I going to do?”<br/>
It was early in the morning when Steven was awoken by a knock on his front door. Rushing up he expected the worse when instead he came face to face with a beautiful middle aged woman. She had straight brown hair and gray eyes, He could tell she came from money just by how she stood and walked into the building.<br/>
“I’m looking for a little girl. She has brown hair that is wildly curly and is tiny.” She spoke as if she was looking for a child that was lost. “She has been missing since she was a baby. If you see her you might feel a strange feeling from her.” She read the young man's face in seconds.<br/>
“She hasn’t given any names, but she might know her.” He was nervous but decided to give her a chance and told her to come back in two hours. He would have the children that she described lined up with little one front and centered.<br/>
When she returned, she froze the room for a second causing two children to look around and rub their eyes before she dropped it.  One girl was a bit chubby filled with baby fat with blond hair and grey eyes. she had the similar grey eyes her family has shared for generations, but the other child fit the description perfectly even without the grey eyes. Coming up with a name on the spot she runs to the girl screaming.<br/>
“HEAVENLY!”</p>
