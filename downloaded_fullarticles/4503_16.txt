    <p>The start of summer comes with an eerie silence.</p><p>The days are unusually warm, the heat blisteringly hot. There is mild panic from the citizens, constant talk of sunburns and the daily reminder to apply sunblock, to wear a hat, to stay out of the sun for extended periods of time. Harry’s skin has gone from a barely there tan to a dark golden hue, a color he finds ironic yet, befitting of the golden boy status he’s received over the years. The house is quiet, filled with soft sounds of the television in another room, the obnoxious laughter of Dudley, faint and muffled through the walls.</p><p>Green eyes slip shut and there’s a stray thought about Ron and Hermione, of Ginny and the rest of the Weasley’s. He can hear the soft patter of rain against the window, metal bars long since been removed. His freedom to come and go as he pleases has increased over time – yet his relationship with his relatives will never be anything more than a formality. Harry rolls over on his best, curls his arm up beneath his head. He stares at Hedwig through the crooked and tilted frames of his glasses, and smiles at the soft cooing sound she makes.</p><p>The light sound of rain increases, the patter against his window covering the sound of the god awful show his cousin is watching. His aunt and uncle are out, at some dinner party that needed to be attended. It was something Dudley had thrown a fit about – had wanted to stay home so he could watch his favorite shows. Harry thinks that if it weren’t raining he’d send Hedwig out with some letters, see how his friends were doing. He knows that the owl would appreciate stretching her wings, hates the few months of summer, of spending more time in a cage then out.</p><p>It’s like this, that he starts to doze off, in the eerily calm setting of his room. The gentle tapping against the window, the quiet calm of the house lulls him into a half awake state. Scattered thoughts, barely beginning dreams and a sudden sharp tap against the window jerks Harry awake. Green eyes open, glasses crooked and hair sticking up in the back. He stares up at the ceiling, thinks that he should get ready for bed regardless of the time.</p><p>Another sharp sound against his window has him sitting up, turning towards it.</p><p>Hedwig ruffles her wings, restless. She makes a soft sound and Harry shushes her. He runs his hands through his hair, pushes the back down as he leans towards his window. Squinting to see in the dark against the bright lights of the house, Harry looks out across the yard, and can make out a figure beneath the tree at the edge of the property.</p><p>Something hits the window, sharp and startling, has Harry jerking back fully awake now.</p><p>He flicks the light in his room off, looks out into the dark. The figure in the yard he knows all too well. He feels a heavy weight in his chest, a cold chill run over him. Pale skin and even paler hair, sharp eyes and a tongue that could cut deeper than any knife he’s ever seen. Harry unlocks his window and pushes it up, leans out into the all too warm summer air. It’s stifling, humid from the rain and he feels like it takes his breath away.</p><p>Beneath the tree he sees Draco, blond hair wet from the rain, dark clothes sticking to his skin.</p><p>Of all the people to visit him, Harry can’t fathom why Malfoy would be there. He leans against the window sill, can feel the rain against his skin, speckling his glasses. Draco is staring at him, hesitance in every feature, uncertainty over flowing. The weight in Harry’s chest drops to his stomach, the flutter of nerves and adrenaline filling him.</p><p>“Is…” He starts, doesn’t want to shout, doesn’t want Dudley to grow aware of the visitor. “…Is something wrong?” The soft patter of rain, the constant drizzle is all Harry is met with in response, leaves him achingly curious.</p><p>He knows the family Draco comes from, knows his father, what he’s done – is capable of.</p><p>And yet he can’t seem to feel threatened, to feel worry in this moment. There’s only concern filling him, what with the way Draco is there, in the dark without his usual scowl and sharp words, pointed eyes. With a lingering glance Harry leans back inside of the room, tugs the window down. He starts towards his bedroom door, a flutter of wings from Hedwig, a loud squawking sound pulls his attention to the owl.</p><p>“It’s raining.” He starts, but the owl tilts her head, looks at him and then at where he keeps his wand.  Harry unlocks the owls cage, is unsurprised as she moves to sit on his shoulder, feet digging in just hard enough to maintain balance. He turns back to the door and Hedwig ruffles her feathers again, true concern and it leaves him smiling. Harry takes his wand and tucks it against his back, beneath his shirt.</p><p>He steps carefully through the house and to the backdoor, knows what steps to avoid in order to keep from being heard. The air outside is warm, stifling almost and Harry is torn between hurrying over to Draco and holding his ground.</p><p>When clear grey eyes look up and meet his own, he feels his chest tighten.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>There’s a small unsure smile on Draco’s face and Harry can’t help but like the sincerity of it, the genuine nature.  By now he’s halfway across the yard and Hedwig has flown up into the tree, wings stretching with the movement. The blond leans back against the tree heavily, has this drained expression on his face, tired.</p><p>“You really are a fool, Potter.”</p><p>Harry stops, just out of arms reach. The words surprise him, have him stalling in his movements, a flicker of worry filling him, of doubt, of <em>maybe I really was wrong?</em> Grey eyes lock onto his own again, and Harry doesn’t reach for his wand, doesn’t move. He can see the lack of malice there, of too much emotion, and despite all their years fighting Harry takes a step forward.</p><p>Or maybe it is because of their history.</p><p>Draco smiles, small but a slight upturn at the corner of his lips.</p><p>“…want to do something different – this summer?”</p><p>Harry stills, and it’s because he doesn’t know what to make of this, doesn’t know how to interpret the other’s words, the tone of his voice. There’s confusion on his face, rain matting his hair down, sticking the dark locks against his forehead, his neck.</p><p>“Why are you here Malfoy?”</p><p>The soft patter of rain, of an unrelenting drizzle that is just loud enough to fill the silence, echoes in Harry’s ears. He watches as the blond shifts, head tilting to the side, of pale hair sticking to skin, of silver eyes staring back at him, and he thinks he’s never seen something so –</p><p>
  <em>“Run away with me.”</em>
