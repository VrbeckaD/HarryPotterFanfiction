Everyone was reading piles of papers, with expressions ranging from amusement to outright horror.</p><p>Dumbledore was munching on licorice and chuckling to himself.</p><p>Hermione jumped up. "This is ridiculous! I'd never snog Neville!"</p><p>Neville looked up from his chair and said, "At least you're not with Malfoy. What's up with that?"</p><p>Draco smoothed his luxurious hair, marked now with a black streak from a scar he had incurred serving the Dark Lord. "What's wrong with that? You could do a lot worse. I'll have you know the Malfoys are legendary lovers."</p><p>Lucius laughed. "That's what your mother always said, anyway."</p><p>"Ewww!" Everyone turned to Ron to find out what had set him off.</p><p>Harry grinned. "Ewww because of the mental picture; or ewww because of who those fanfiction people put you with?"</p><p>Ron look at Harry, horrified. "They've got us snogging, Harry."</p><p>"Ewww!" Harry snatched the chapter from Ron and crumpled it into a ball.</p><p>Professor Snape scowled and said nothing.</p><p>Bellatrix snorted. "This is preposterous. Look, someone has me with Lucious and Snape at the same time. I have much better taste than to get with Snape."</p><p>Lucius raised an eyebrow. "I had no idea you felt that way. You shouldn't complain too much though. I think I've been put with most of the people here; including Snape."</p><p>Snape grimaced. "I think not, Lucius. If I could, I'd hex every one of you for even being in these stories about me."</p><p>McGonagall grinned. "Why don't you just take house points away, Severus?"</p><p>"You know that doesn't work anymore. I tried yesterday, just for good measure."</p><p>Hermione groaned. "My goodness. They even have some stories that have me and Ginny together; not to mention a particular disturbing reference to me and McGonagall."</p><p>Ginny burst into tears. "It could be worse; this says I love Draco and Lucius."</p><p>Draco laughed. "I read that one. It's really well written. Want to get a bite to eat later?"</p><p>Ginny ran from the room, her face in her hands.</p><p>McGonagall burst out laughing raucously. She walked over to Snape's chair and put an arm around his shoulders. "Severus, love, can you really do this? If you can, I must apologize. I've been underestimating you all these years."</p><p>He took the paper and read for a few moments; then handed it back. "I am not in the habit of discussing my sexual proclivities, Minerva."</p><p>Harry fell off the chair, laughing.</p><p>Ron looked green.</p><p>Snape turned his piercing gaze on Harry. "I wouldn't be so smug, Mr. Potter. Some ... imaginative individuals have us in some very compromising situations."</p><p>"Ewww," now Harry looked green.</p><p>"Ewww indeed, Mr. Potter."</p><p>Hermione chipped in. "This one's not so bad. I married Ron."</p><p>Ron smiled. "Oh, wait," Hermione said. "You die and I end up with ... Snape?"</p><p>Snape looked her up and down. "Humph. Apparently, I have intimate knowledge everyone here, and I've even broken a large number of hearts."</p><p>Dumbledore looked up. "Really?"</p><p>Snape sighed. "Really."</p><p>Sirius Black walked into the room. "Hey, check this out. Tons of people think I should shag Remus."</p><p>"What does Remus think about that?" McGonagall asked.</p><p>"He's outside getting really drunk."</p><p>McGonagall smiled. "Isn't that how several of these stories started in the first place?"</p><p>Everyone laughed. Snape even chuckled a little.</p><p>At that moment, Tom Riddle walked into the room with an apron and barbeque tools.</p><p>"Hey, quit reading that mess. There's Mohito's on the patio."</p><p>Everyone got up and headed to the patio. As they were leaving, Snape draped an arm over Hermione's shoulders.</p><p>"You're looking particularly dashing this evening, Miss. Granger, especially for a dead person. Would you hold a dance for me later this evening?"</p><p>Hermione looked him in the eye for a minute. "Sure," she said. "What's the point of being dead if we can't have some fun?" She leaned in and said, "I just have to know; can you really do this?" as she handed him one of the chapters she was reading.</p><p>It was the first time anyone could remember seeing Snape grin.</p><p> </p></div>
