    <p>Harry breathed in the fresh smelling air as he stood on the balcony over looking the land. Some days he still couldn't believe that all this was real, that he could live in a place like this that felt straight out of a fairy tale. The sound of his bedroom door creaking open caused him to turn. He smiled as his eyes fell upon his beautiful sister.</p><p> </p><p>"Good morning Harry", she said, as she stepped up beside him on the balcony, linking her arm through his and leaning her head against his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>"Good morning Artemis", he replied, kissing the top of her head lightly, breathing in her familiar scent.</p><p> </p><p>"Fleur asked me to come tell you that we need to get ready".</p><p> </p><p>"You mean she ordered you to", Harry said chuckling as he received a light swat to the shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>"You know how she gets when mother isn't home. Don't blame me for trying to be polite".</p><p> </p><p>"Did she say when mother would be back"? Harry asked, watching the swans paddling in the fountain in the front garden.</p><p> </p><p>"Only that she will likely not be back till after we're already on the train".</p><p> </p><p>"Fleur's not going to be happy", Harry sighed.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>"Are the two of you ready"? Asked Fleur as she took hold of her own bag and tossed some Floo powder into the fire place.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes mother", replied Harry and Artemis together, which caused Gabrielle to giggle from her chair, where she was surrounded by books, and Fleur to harrumph in annoyance before a fond smile spread across her face.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright, go on through, I'll follow you".</p><p> </p><p>First Harry and then Artemis stepped into the huge fire place, before they reemerged on a busy train platform. They stepped forward and out of the way as Fleur came through, looking around at the pact platform before turning to address her siblings.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, I'm affraid I don't have long as I need to get to school myself. That being said", she put her bag on the floor and held out her arms.</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Artemis smiled as they dashed forward, wrapping Fleur in their arms. Fleur smiled and rolled her eyes, bending down to place a light kiss on Artemis' cheek, before rising onto her tiptoes to do the same to Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Giving a squeeze to Artemis, she let go of her younger sister, turning her full attention to Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"You will be alright"? She asked, a hint of concern spilling into her voice.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I'll be fine. I've got Artemis with me after all", Harry looked to Artemis, the two of them smiling at eachother at his words.</p><p> </p><p>"I know, and I'm glad mother allowed her to go with you. It's just you've never left the chateau without me before. I worry about you Harry".</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled gently at Fleur, bringing his hand up to her face to wipe away a tear that fell from her eye and rolled down her pale white cheek.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm okay Fleur. I'll write to you whenever I can. I know you wanted me to go with you to Beauxbatons, but this is where I'm meant to be. Where I want to be. There are people here that knew my mother. People that can finally answer my questions".</p><p> </p><p>Fleur closed her eyes and nodded at what Harry was saying. Taking a deep calming breath, she opened them again, bringing her arms around Harry's neck and bringing his head down to rest on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>"I hope you find what you've been looking for my sweet", turning her head, she placed a lingering kiss on his temple, before pressing a briefer one on the corner of his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Pushing him away, she wiped a hand across her face, brushing away the tears that had fallen.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright, of you go you two".</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Artemis smiled and waved to Fleur as they took their bags and boarded the train.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked up from his book as a knock came at the compartment door. Looking to the bench across from him, he saw Artemis sat with her legs crossed and a book of her own on her lap. She held her wand as she seemed to be practising some Transfiguring, a small button held in her other hand that had previously been black, was now a bright pink.</p><p> </p><p>Looking to the door, the both nodded to the girl stood on the other side, giving their ascent to her coming in.</p><p> </p><p>Sliding the door open, the girl walked in, closing it slightly behind her.</p><p> </p><p>"Is it alright if I sit here, the only other compartments that aren't full seem to be occupied by people more focused on my blood than going to Hogwarts". </p><p> </p><p>Harry snorted in ammusment and replied that it was fine.</p><p> </p><p>"Muggle Born then"? Harry asked as the girl sat down next to him.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. That's not a problem, is it"? Harry frowned as the girl looked like she was about to stand back up.</p><p> </p><p>"Not at all", he said.</p><p> </p><p>"Not as if we can say anything", piped in Artemis, "I'm not even a human".</p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean"? Asked the girl, seeming confused.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm a Veela", Artemis said.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I've read about those".</p><p> </p><p>"Really"? Asked Harry and Artemis at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I know they're not really talked about till like 6th year, but I saw a book on magical beings at Flourish &amp; Blotts and just had to read it. Is it true that the Allure can affect anyone"?</p><p> </p><p>Artemis smiled at the girl being so fascinated by her. "Not everyone. Only those that are attracted to girls. If the Veela in question is especially powerful then she could probably affect just about anyone, but that power is very rare".</p><p> </p><p>"Fascinating", the girl gushed. "Oh how rude of me. I'm Hermione Granger by the way", she said, holding out her hand for Harry and Artemis to shake.</p><p> </p><p>"Artemis Delacour", Artemis said.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, that's a beautiful name. I've always loved Greek mythology", said Hermione, turning to Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"Harry Evans", said Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione's eyes widened for a second before going back to normal.   </p><p> </p><p>"Nice to meet you", said Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>They sat in silence for a few moments before Artemis' wand caught Hermione's attention.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, were you doing magic? Can you show me"?</p><p> </p><p>Artemis smiled before nodding. Pointing her wand at the button in her hand, she whispered something. The wand tip flashed and the button seemed to shimmer in the light, before turning from bright pink, to a sky blue.</p><p> </p><p>"That's amazing!" exclaimed Hermione. "I've not been able to practice any at home myself. Was that French you spoke? I thought spells could only be, well, spelled, in Latin".</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, pretty much any magically powerful language can be used to cast spells. French, Latin, Gaelic, Old High German, Old English and so on".</p><p> </p><p>"Fascinating", muttered Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>As the three friends stepped off the train, they came face to face with a giant of a man.</p><p> </p><p>"First years this way!" The man called.</p><p> </p><p>The three of them looked to each other, shrugged, and went to stand next to the man.</p><p> </p><p>"And what're your names eh"? He asked them.</p><p> </p><p>"Artemis".</p><p> </p><p>"Hermione".</p><p> </p><p>"Harry".</p><p> </p><p>"Well, it's nice to meet you. My names Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds. I'll be leading all of you up to the castle for the sorting".</p><p> </p><p>He looked away from them then when some more first years approached, greeting them just as he had with Harry, Artemis and Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>"Ravenclaw!"</p><p> </p><p>Artemis smiled as she stood from the stool and went to sit at the table of Blue and Bronze.</p><p> </p><p>"Ravenclaw!"</p><p> </p><p>Harry's face split open in a wide smile as he practically ran to sit next to Artemis, giving her a one armed hug as he sat down.</p><p> </p><p>"Ravenclaw!"</p><p> </p><p>Hermione was practically elated as she saw Harry and Artemis clapping and cheering louder than anyone else as she approached to sit with them.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>"Boys rooms up those stairs, and girls up there", said a beautiful 5th year girl who had introduced herself as Penelope. "Please all be down for half seven tomorrow morning, myself and my fellow 5th year prefect will take you all down for breakfast so you can learn the way. Goodnight everyone, I'm sure you're all tired".</p><p> </p><p>Harry turned and gave Artemis a hug as he went up stairs to his rooms, giving Hermione a wave as he went.</p><p> </p><p>Artemis and Hermione then went up to their own room, changing into their pyjamas and going to bed.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
