    <p>“Look,” Pansy finally snapped, levelling a rather impressive glare at the blonde standing next to her. “Clearly I’m not good enough <i>company</i> for you, so-”</p><p>“What?” Draco managed to blurt out, turning his head around towards her, narrowing his gaze slightly through the alcohol and haze of the room. “What are you talking about?”</p><p>Pansy huffed and crossed her arms over her chest, not immune to the way Draco’s eyes flicked down over her body. Well, at least she still had <i>that</i> going for her. “As if I haven’t noticed that you’ve barely listened to a single thing I’ve said in the past twenty minutes!”</p><p>“That’s-“ Draco sputtered a little, shaking his head slowly. Pansy could almost see the wheels in his head spinning, processing her words. “I’ve been here with you the entire night, Pans.”</p><p>Pansy’s glare only seemed to intensify at this. “Here with <i>me,</i> but your eyes have been on <i>him.</i> Do you even know what you want, Draco?”</p><p>Before Draco could react, Pansy pushed herself off the bar and stormed off into the crowd of bodies on the dance floor in front of them. Here she thought she had finally broken through, convincing Draco to come out with her. In the four years since the war, Draco had barely left his apartment. The first year he was under house arrest at the manor, and then he’d bought himself a flat in muggle London and practically disappeared. When he finally responded to one of her owls, Pansy thought she’d broken down whatever wall he wanted to build. Sure, a muggle club wasn’t exactly her idea of a stunning first date, but she had figured it would be good to catch up at least.</p><p>Instead, Draco had downed three drinks in near rapid succession and then his attention had caught something in the crowd, and that was that. Well. Pansy wasn’t one to be upstaged, at least if she could help it, so she figured it was time to take matters into her own hands.</p><p>“Hey!” she shouted over the music, and the man who Draco had been staring at turned.</p><p>It was a good thing she had left her drink on the bar, or she would have dropped it.</p><p>Bright green eyes blinked over at her, and before Pansy had a chance to react the man shifted uncomfortably, lifting a hand up to brush a mop of slightly curly hair away from his eyes and flashing the edges of an all-too familiar scar towards her. When had Potter gotten so… fit?</p><p>“Parkinson?” he half-shouted back, and Pansy swallowed a lump in her throat.</p><p>“Potter,” she confirmed, and he nodded once, uncomfortably.</p><p>“How did you find me?” Harry asked next, and Pansy couldn’t stop herself from glancing back towards the bar, where Draco was still leaning, his silver eyes nearly molten as he watched them both.</p><p>Pansy shook her head. “I didn’t actually… know. That it was you, I mean.”</p><p>Harry frowned, and Pansy wondered if his contemplative look had always been this intriguing. “Then… why did you come over here?”</p><p>It took her less than a minute to decide what to do, and Pansy couldn’t stop the small smirk that tugged at her lips.  Her plan might be crazy, but, with the amount of alcohol they had all clearly consumed… it also might be exactly what they all needed. “Well, you see. My date over there,” she gestured back towards Draco and watched as one of his eyebrows quirked up. “Couldn’t seem to take his eyes off your arse. And I decided I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, see, because usually when I wear <i>this</i> dress I tend to keep most people’s attention a little more… focused.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes flicked down in much the same way Draco’s had done and she watched as he swallowed hard at the sight of her. “I’m sorry, I’m really not sure what’s happening here.” he finally admitted.</p><p>Pansy reached out and caught one of his hands, and then turned to head back over to Draco, tugging Potter along with her. “I think,” she began, as she watched the way Draco’s eyes widened at the gesture, “the three of us could have a <i>very</i> interesting night… don’t you?”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said, looking from her to where Draco was now pushing himself away from the bar, and Pansy felt the way he squeezed her hand a little tighter in what she hoped was anticipation. “<i>Oh</i>.”</p>
