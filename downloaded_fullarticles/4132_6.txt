    <p>Sirius Black tried to run but ropes shot the end of his mother’s wand and grabbed him by the ankles. His hands were still free for a moment or two but he had left his wand upstairs. He cursed his lapse as he tore at the ropes with his hands until one of his fingernails broke in half and his mother bound his wrists as well.</p><p> </p><p>'I am tired of your insolent melodrama Sirius,' she screeched as the ropes flew back towards her in the air, dragging her son with them. 'You will do as you're told.'</p><p> </p><p>Regulus and Orion were still standing by the sofa where they had sprang to their feet when the heir to the Black name had made a break for it. Narcissa looked furious at the scene her cousin was creating in front of that Malfoy boy she’d brought over.</p><p> </p><p>On his knees and trembling Sirius was jerked backwards by his mother’s hand on his head. Walburga Black slashed her wand and Sirius felt his long hair start to fall away. His face burned with the humiliation as Orion sat back down with a chuckle.</p><p> </p><p>He should have just done it himself when it first got brought up, at his horrific birthday dinner a week ago, it would have saved all this. But Sirius couldn’t stop himself from lashing back at them. Punishing his family in all the tiny small ways he could.</p><p> </p><p>The carpet was covered in his hair now. Walburga pushed her son’s head away and sat down beside her husband. The ropes fell away from Sirius’s arms and legs. Kreacher the house-elf appeared with a snap and began to tidy up.</p><p> </p><p>'No, no, Kreacher,' Walburga smiled. 'Sirius is going to clean up his own mess. You get me a drink.'</p><p> </p><p>Sirius gathered his own hair off the floor and threw it into the fireplace before leaving the room. He hoped the singed smell would choke them.</p><p> </p><p>That was when he decided. Once he left for Hogwarts he was never coming back in Grimauld Place. Even if at the end of Sixth Year he had to sleep in the Forbidden Forest or in Kings Cross station. Sirius said all this out loud to himself in his room. Laughing and rubbing what remained of his hair.</p><p> </p><p>'Though maybe James will let me stay with him,' Sirius pretended that this was just his backup plan and not his only real option.</p><p> </p><p>Because what if James or his parents said no.</p><p> </p><p>'He won't,' Sirius told himself. But his hands were still shaking from the ordeal downstairs and the marauder felt a lot younger than sixteen.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The first thing Sirius saw on the far side of the barrier at platform 9 ¾ was James Potter. Sirius felt three stone lighter right away. James was the same, all easy grins and messy hair. James was the same kid who had offered to curse his father out the train window in their second year. James was his best friend and would not abandon him.</p><p> </p><p>He raised his hand to wave but James was not looking right at him. He was staring wistfully off to the left, to where Lily Evans was standing talking to Marlene McKinnon. For once James wasn’t trying to get her attention or impress her. For a second he looked lonely. James Potter lonely? Impossible.</p><p> </p><p>Regulus collided with Sirius’s back because in his daze he had not moved out of the way of the entrance.</p><p> </p><p>‘Burn it,’ Regulus swore pushing his older brother out of the way. ‘Wake up, will you?’</p><p> </p><p>Both Black brothers hurried out of the way before their parents swept through next, followed by Kreacher pulling the trolley containing their trunks.</p><p> </p><p>James spotted him by now and waved cheerily, all signs of his melancholy melted like snow. Marlene waved too but Lily had disappeared into the crowd. She was not with Snape. Sirius could see him standing with a group of Slytherins that Regulus was moving towards. Sirius shuddered. He had heard the rumours. He might not be able to claim he loved his brother much but what he was hearing about these “knights” that were obsessed with blood purity; it frightened him. Snape patted Regulus on the back and glared in Sirius’s direction. The eldest Black son was filled with the urged to just cursed him right there and then on the platform, consequences be damned. But he couldn’t, if Sirius got expelled he would have to be sent home. That was not an option now. But all the same, he wanted to <em>hurt</em> Snape.</p><p> </p><p>He turned stiffly and said goodbye to his parents before getting on the train. His mother made some comment about not disgracing the family too badly this year but the blood was pounding in Sirius’s ears so loudly he could barely hear her. This was it. Once he walked away from them this time, there was no turning back, he would never go back to Grimmauld Place.</p><p> </p><p>James dragged him along by the arm. ‘Come on Pads, Wormtail went ahead to get us a compartment. Have you seen Moony? I can’t find him.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Maybe he’s not well,’ Sirius gently pulled his arm free of James, not liking how the tugging reminded him of home but kept following.</p><p> </p><p>‘Nope, I checked,’ James peered in through a door. ‘What the hell?!’</p><p> </p><p>Remus and Lily Evans were sitting side by side in an otherwise empty compartment. They were leaning together and talking in low voices. Sirius watched a parade of emotions march and switch places across his best friend’s face.</p><p> </p><p>Further up, Peter Pettigrew stuck his head out of a compartment. ‘Come on, you two!’ He called. ‘I had to tell Finius Gib that you had cursed your seats to keep him out.’</p><p> </p><p>Sirius shoved his friend along and they piled into the compartment Peter had been guarding.</p><p> </p><p>‘What wrong with you two?’ He asked.</p><p> </p><p>‘Nothing,’ Sirius answered for James. ‘Wormy, could you go have a look on the platform for Moony. I can’t if the parents are still there.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Sure,’ Peter frowned, suspecting that they were leaving him out of some scheme, but he went.</p><p> </p><p>‘Prongs,’ Sirius started as soon as their friend left the compartment.</p><p> </p><p>‘I don’t care,’ James snapped.</p><p> </p><p>‘You don’t know there’s anything to not care about,’ Sirius countered. ‘Moony knows how you feel about Evans. They’re probably just talking about all the extra summer homework they took on. Have you ever seen Remus chat up a girl? I mean, try to picture it?’</p><p> </p><p>James’s scowl flickered for a second and then he laughed. ‘You’re right. That’s pretty ridiculous.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Exactly, Moony would never do that,’ Sirius could not tell his best friend why he was so certain; the one secret between them.</p><p> </p><p>Peter and Remus appeared at the door and slid exhausted into the seat opposite their friends just as the train started to move.</p><p> </p><p>‘I nearly missed the train looking for this idiot when he was two compartments down!’ Peter gasped.</p><p> </p><p>‘I said sorry Worm,’ Remus panted, grinning a little.</p><p> </p><p>He caught Sirius’s eye and if Sirius did not know him better he would have said that Remus <em>leered</em> at him. Blood flushed through Sirius’s cheeks and he stared out the window to hide them. James had curled up on the seat beside him like a cat, his robes draped over him like a blanket.</p><p> </p><p>Peter blinked at Sirius as though seeing him for the first time. ‘Pads, what did you do with your hair?’</p><p> </p><p>‘I cut it, obviously,’ Sirius snapped with such venom that Peter physically recoiled from him.</p><p> </p><p>Peter muttered to himself about not meaning it in a bad way and pulled what was left of his summer homework from his bag to finish. Once his nose was buried in a book, Remus stretched his long legs out until his feet were resting on Sirius’s ankles.</p><p> </p><p>James woke up a little after and the other three got changed into their robes. Sirius sat in his corner and wondered if he would fit into any of James’s muggle clothes if he did go to stay with him. He fussed with the sleeve of his robes, they had been uncomfortable all day.</p><p> </p><p>‘Ow,’ something sharp stuck into the flesh above his elbow.</p><p> </p><p>Remus appeared beside him and pulled a straight pin from the fabric. ‘How in Merlin’s name, did this get on you?’</p><p> </p><p>‘Bloody Kreacher, Sirius muttered. ‘He’s burning hilarious.’</p><p> </p><p>The sweets trolley came by and James indulged a bit enthusiastically. He and Peter ended up leaning back to back on one of the seats, clutching their stomachs with their sugar and chocolate stained hands before falling asleep. Remus settled in next to Sirius with a smiled.</p><p> </p><p>He leaned his head against his shoulder. ‘Are you glad to be going back to school Padfoot?’ He whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius snorted. ‘I’d be glad even if they had made Filch headmaster.’</p><p> </p><p>They shared a chuckle. Remus toyed with the ragged ends of Sirius’s hair. ‘You really made a mess of this, Pads, do you want me to fix it after the feast?’</p><p> </p><p>‘Leave it alone,’ Sirius pushed Remus away. He did not want to associate the memory of Remus touching him with his public humiliation.</p><p> </p><p>But Remus crumpled into his a little and shuffled to the other end of the seat, burying his nose in a book.</p><p> </p><p>‘Moony I didn’t…’</p><p> </p><p>‘It’s fine.’</p><p> </p><p>Sirius cursed silently and stared out the window. He saw Peter reflected in the glass. Grinning a little maliciously, Sirius pulled his wand out. With a few quiet words he had turned Peter’s hair electric pink. Remus watched him closely, frowning behind his copy of Advanced Charms.</p><p> </p><p>‘It’s just a joke,’ Sirius said defensively. ‘They’ll think it’s funny when they wake up.’</p><p> </p><p>‘If you say so, Sirius,’ then they spent the rest of the journey in silence.</p><p> </p><p>It was true James fell onto the floor laughing when the slowing train woke them. Peter laughed too, but it was nervous laughter, a little too loud and brittle. His cheeks turned nearly as pink as his hair as he tried to figure out how to undo it. Remus said the counter-charm under his breath just as Peter attempted something else and let his friend think he had fixed it himself. Sirius felt Remus’s judgement between his shoulder blades the whole way to the carriages.</p><p> </p><p>James talked enough for all of them. But for the first time, as the great castle came into view above them, Sirius was not completely happy.</p>
