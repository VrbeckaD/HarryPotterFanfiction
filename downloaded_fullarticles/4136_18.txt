    <p>Harry stood behind the stage, waiting for his song to come on. It’s been the same song and dance for him since he was eleven. His Uncle Vernon had given him over to this Omega Whore house as to pay off a debt that his father collected before his death. Harry hated his uncle for giving him to this club, hated his father for racking up such a high debt, and most of all he hated the owner of the establishment Lord V. Now twenty-one Harry was still untouched, and he hoped to stay that way until he earned enough to buy his freedom back. As far as Harry knew he was the only Omega in the whore house that was given suppressants by Lord V and was allow to wear contacts when he performed. The black leather panties dug into his skin as he listened for his song to come on.</p><p>            “Now give it up for Virgin Omega Harry!” The DJ announced over the speaker system. Loud cheers and applause came from the audience.</p><p>            Harry knew he was the most popular Omega in the club, and he hated every time the DJ announced he was still a virgin. It made his job harder as he had to watch the horny Alpha’s that have had one too many drinks. As the music picked up, Harry grabbed a hold of the pole and began his routine. The heels Harry was wearing clicked along the stage as he moved his body seductively, twirling, and going down just enough to have the Alpha’s going crazy. Through the lights he watched as he fellow workers were out on the floor, being manhandled in a way that he had never been. As he continued his routine, he watched on of the younger Omega’s a new girl, he thought her name was Luna or something, was being passed between three Alpha’s. It broke his heart because he knew the highest bidder of the three would be able to get her for a while. He shook his hips and pulled the leather panties down a little bit more, revealing more of his hip bone, and that caused the horde of Alpha’s around the stage to toss handfuls of twenty’s at the stage towards him. It didn’t matter how much money was on the stage, or how much he made, Lord V took a good deal away to help pay off his father’s debt. Whatever Harry was able to keep, he made sure to keep safe and not touch. He wanted to have enough to be able to buy his freedom back and still get a small place of his own. Harry gave seductive looks out to the Alpha’s as he began to crawl on his hands and knees towards one Alpha, and took the twenty out of his hand with his teeth. Harry then took the twenty and rubbed it along his chest and slipped it into his panties. He watched as the Alpha fought against jumping on the stage to have a piece of Harry. He did a few more moves and then finally his song ended just as he dipped down and pulled the panties down enough to reveal his ass and untouched hole. He quickly pulled his panties back up and walked off the stage, much to the growls and whistles coming from the Alphas. Harry had just taken off his shoes to go back to his room when Crabbe stepped in front of him.</p><p>            “Boss wants to see you Harry. Now.” Crabbe sternly told the Omega. He crossed his arms over his chest, blocking Harry’s path towards his room.</p><p>            Harry let out a sigh as he placed his shoes on a shoe rack and walked down the opposite hallway. When Lord V wanted to see him, it was to tell him that another portion of his father’s debt had been paid and Harry could keep a little bit more money. He made his way down the hallway slowly, each footstep he took echoed throughout the quiet hallway. Finally, Harry reached Lord V’s door and knocked three times, waiting for the clearance to enter.</p><p>            “Come in Harry.” The voice hissed through the door.</p><p>            Harry opened the door and walked with his head bowed to the center of the room. He quickly dropped to his knees, hands on his thighs, head bowed down. “You wanted to see me Lord V?”</p><p>            “Yes Harry.” Lord V hissed out. His face was sunken in, but his presence was one of a strong Alpha. Lord V lifted his head from the paperwork in front of him to stare at the Omega kneeled in his office. “You are released Harry. Tonight was your last performance. The outfit has been laid out for you and your meager possessions have been packed.”</p><p>            Harry felt a smile creep on his face, hearing he had been released. Yet something else the Alpha had said had made Harry curious. “Alpha, sir. If I am released, then why has an outfit already been picked out for me? Shouldn’t I get to choose what I wear on my first day of freedom?”</p><p>            Lord V stood from the chair and made his way to where the Omega was. “I’m sorry, I thought the message was clear. You are being released from here Omega, and into the custody of an Alpha. He is buying you as a birthday present for his Alpha son. Actually he has owned you since you were fourteen. Why else do you think I’ve went through all the trouble of making sure you stayed on suppressants and turned down offers that would have paid your father’s debt off in full twice over.” He watched as Harry started to ball his hands into fists.</p><p>            “I’ve been working hard to buy my freedom Lord V!” Harry hissed out. “I don’t want to be sold off like one of the other Omega whores. I have money saved! And Sirius is working on helping get out of here as well! You can’t just sell me off.”</p><p>            “My dear Harry, you have been sold since you were fourteen. You signed a contract.” Lord V spoke. He walked back to his desk, grabbed the contract, and held it for Harry to see. “You know my business partner, Lucius Malfoy? His Alpha son, Draco, just turned twenty-one. And you are going to be his Omega Harry. As for that small some of 5,000pounds you were saving, it has already been turned over to the Malfoy’s and your Alpha will decide on what will happen with the money. Personally I would consider it a dowry. As for the convict of a family friend…”</p><p>            “He’s innocent!” Harry hissed out. All his hard work, all that money he had saved and had hidden was gone. He could feel tears stinging his eyes, yet he refused to cry. He and Sirius had to be close enough to buy Harry’s freedom, and now all gone.</p><p>            Voldemort clenched his fists. “You’re lucky that you no longer work here. I would have just smacked you across your face for that comment.” He stepped closer and tossed the contract on the floor in front of Harry’s face. “As I was saying. It will be up to your new Alpha whether or not he lets your weak Alpha godfather talk to you still or not. Now go and get ready. The Malfoys are sending someone to collect you once the club closes.”</p><p>            Harry wanted to argue, wanted to say he was working to be a free an Omega, but he slowly rose and kept his eyes cast down as he left the room. He kept his hands in a tight fist as he made his way back down to the worker’s wing. Another Omega quickly ran up to him and embraced him. Harry braced back since it was his friend Ron. “So you’ve heard.”</p><p>            “Yeah, bloody Crabbe and Goyle been down here making sure we all knew.” Ron informed his friend. “Why couldn’t this wait a little longer?”</p><p>            “What do you mean?” Harry asked. He took out the contacts that he had been wearing and took his glasses from his friend. “I’ve been bought by this Alpha apparently since I was fourteen Ron.”</p><p>            Ron grabbed Harry’s arm and brought him into his room, looking around before closing the door. “You know the Alpha that has been exclusively using me?”</p><p>            “Yeah, Hermione Granger is her name right?” Harry asked. “She’s a lawyer of some kind right?”</p><p>            “Yeah.” Ron enthusiastically spoke. “You see; I’ve told her about the lot of us. How a majority of us have been taken from our families, or given against our will. Turns out that she’s been trying to get this place and others like it shut down for a while. Hermione said that if I agree to testify, that it would help her case. She also said that she would take me in once this place gets raided. I also told her about you and she said if you’re a friend of mine, she would let you stay with her as well.”</p><p>            Harry shook his head, not believing what he was hearing. “Ron, what difference does it make. I signed a contract saying I belong to the Alpha. I have no choice. Also I was given to pay off a debt, so wouldn’t the law see it as equal payment or something.” He watched the ginger head shake back and forth.</p><p>            “I don’t know mate, but that will be something I ask her.” Ron pulled Harry in for another hug. “You better hurry though Harry. The club closes soon and I don’t want the Alpha hurting you at all.”</p><p>            Harry held tight to his friend before he broke them apart and left Ron’s room. The journey down to his room seemed like a march of death, with all the Omega’s in the hallway just staring at him, either with pity, remorse, or joy. Once he was inside, he quickly closed the door, and set about to get ready. His first stop was at his dresser where he searched through the drawers, heart dropping once he realized that Lord V hadn’t been lying. They took all his money that he had saved, and any hope he had of freedom with it. Harry just shook his head, feeling the anger burn in him, before he walked back to the bed. Slowly his eyes drifted to a spot on the bed where he saw the small bag that had been packed, and as he walked towards the bed, he saw a pair of green panties laid out for him. He picked up the clothing, feeling the silk in his hand, shuddering as he thought about how this would look on him. Quickly, Harry slipped off the black leather panties and slipped the green silk ones on, hating how they felt on him. Just as he was walking towards the mirror to look at how the panties looked on him, his door swung opened.</p><p>            “That’s him.” One the intruders said. The three Beta’s quickly walked towards the Omega.</p><p>            “Who the…mmmph!” Harry tried to ask. Before he could finish the question, he had been forced down to his knees, a gag was forced over his mouth, and he could feel his arms being forced into a strange sleeve. He forced his eyes to look towards the mirror and saw that the gag was green, and as the intruders were forcing him to stand, out of his peripheral vision, he saw the sleeve was also green. <em>What is with all this green? </em>Harry thought. He had to admit that all this green brought out his eyes. He didn’t have time to think much about anything as he was forced to walk out of the room, only catching one of the Beta’s grabbing his small bag off the bed.</p><p>            Harry kept his head bowed, not wanting to make any eye contact with the Omega’s that were watching him, whispering about him, and he hated it. He tried to keep his breathing even and his heartrate under control, but he was scared, for this was not what he wanted. All Harry wanted was to earn enough money to buy his freedom back, and find a nice place for him and Sirius to live. He hated that his uncle brought him to the hospital when he started to present as an Omega, hated that that was how Lord V found him. The worse part was Uncle Vernon didn’t need more than five minutes to think about it before he gave Harry over to the man. Harry shook his head, not wanting those memories to come back. He heard music still playing and he could feel his breathing coming faster and his heartrate picking up, for he thought he was going to be taking after the club closes, not while patrons were still in the back. Harry’s eyes darted up to see Lord V standing in the hallway.</p><p>            “Take him out the back way.” Lord V informed the guards. He approached Harry and touched the Omega’s face. “I should have had you wearing green from the start. It brings out your eyes, and I’m sure I could have made more money.” He removed his hand and moved out of the way of the Beta’s.</p><p>            Harry was thankful that he was going to be taken out the back way, for he didn’t think he could live with the humiliation of all the patrons seeing him bound and gagged, being taken away towards an Alpha. He thought about resisting, about making it more difficult for the guards, but he decided against it. Harry darted his eyes up when they exited the building and saw the black van waiting for them, and saw two more guards standing next to it.</p><p>            “Damn he is a fine looking young Omega.” One of the guards leaning against the van spoke. “Master Draco is going to love him.”</p><p>            “Well he should, he’s been waiting to have this one since he was fourteen.” One of the guards holding Harry spoke. “Lord Lucius was only waiting until Draco turned twenty-one to give his son this Omega.” The guard’s holding Harry forced him to walk to the van.</p><p>            Harry kept his head down as listened to the guards talk about him, and offered no resistance as he was brought to the back of the van. As he heard the doors opening, he forced himself to look up and saw that there was a cage and his flight or fight response took over. He started to struggle, not wanting to get into the cage, finally understanding what the cage meant. Harry yelped as he felt the hands tightening their grip on him, which only caused him to struggle more. It was hard with his hands and arms restrained in the sleeve, but he had to try. He didn’t want to go without at least putting up a fight. Harry watched as the two Beta’s that had been leaning against the van came around to help the three that were having trouble. He smiled behind the mouth gag, for he was glad he was giving the Beta’s so much trouble. A small yelp escaped from behind the gag when felt his legs had been grabbed, and through panicking eyes behind his glasses, he watched as his body was forced into the cage. His heart sank when he realized he could not escape once the cage was closed and locked. Harry slowly forced himself to readjust himself into a kneeling position, for the cage was large enough to allow him to do that. He watched as three guards climbed into the back with him, closing the doors, and then the other getting in the front. Harry felt the van start up and slowly start to take off, taking him to a life he never wanted.</p><p>            The ride, at least for Harry, was not a smooth ride, for each bump had him tossing around in the cage, causing him to groan out in pain. Harry could feel color rushing to his face as he listened to the guards laugh at him. He could feel the bruises start to form from his body being tossed around the small cage, and he felt tears stinging his eyes. Yet he refused to cry, for he knew it would end up with the Beta’s laughing at him, not understanding where the sadness was coming from. He thought about Sirius and all the plans they were talking about, how they thought they were close enough to buy Harry’s freedom back, and how Sirius spoke about Harry staying with him if he couldn’t afford a flat. Sirius also said to help Harry adjust to life outside of the club, he would personal do what it took to help. He also had told Harry that he would screen any Alpha that Harry was interested in, to make sure they were worthy of such a sweet kid. Harry dropped his head in the cage as he thought about those times, and how they had filled Harry with so much hope and joy. Now this van was taken him away from those ideas, from Sirius, and all the happiness that might have been. Soon the road became bumpier and it tossed Harry around more in the cage. The whole van was filled with the Beta’s laughing and scoffing at him, and Harry felt the tears so close to falling. Finally, the van stopped moving and he heard doors opening and closing. Harry’s heartrate raced faster as he realized that they had arrived at their destination, and his new prison. He decided he would give the Beta’s a hard time when they tried to remove him from the cage, only to discover the top of the cage could be opened. Harry did try to struggle as the hands reached in and grab him pulling out of the cage and directing him out of the van. Soon Harry was being forced to walk towards the mansion.</p><p>            The gravel hurt his bare feet, and the cold wind nipped at his skin, causing the Beta’s to laugh at him. Harry couldn’t believe that the stone of the steps were colder to his feet as he was forced to walk up the steps and being guided into the mansion. It was huge, and Harry didn’t have time to study his new prison before he was being forced to the stair’s and being forced to walk up them. Everything was happening too fast for Harry, and he felt his world spinning, barely aware that they had entered a room, or that he had been forced to his knees and a collar and chain had been attached to his throat. He forced himself to calm down enough to see that the chain was connected to the floor, and he tugged at his arms that were trapped in the sleeve and could tell that they had been somehow attached to the floor. He felt a small prick to his neck, wondering what they had done to him. <em>No, please let this be a dream. </em>Harry thought as he listened to the guards leave the room. Alone in the room, Harry forced his eyes to see what they could, and the bed that he was facing scared him more than anything else could in the room. He knew that that was where he was going to be taken against his will, where his dreams will truly die. Harry dropped his head and let the tears slowly fall down his face. He wondered how long he would have to be like this, and after sometime, he heard the door open.</p><p>            “Happy Birthday Draco.” A cold voice spoke. Harry shivered as he recognized the voice as Lucius Malfoy, Lord V’s business partner and associate.</p><p>            “Is it the same one that I’ve wanted since I was fourteen?” Another voice asked. It wasn’t as cold as Lucius’s, but still cold enough to cause Harry to shudder. It had to be Draco. “The Omega with the green eyes and the wonderful mouthwatering scent?”</p><p>             Lucius laughed slightly. “Smell the air and tell me yourself.”</p><p>            Harry listened as he heard Draco take a deep breath of air, and listened as footsteps slowly approached him. He jumped slightly when he felt a hand entangle itself in his messy hair, and a nose pressed right into his scent glandes. Harry could help the small whine that escaped from behind the gag as he felt a tongue run across his scent glandes. The hand released his hair, and he was thankful for it.</p><p>            “Thank you Father.” Draco spoke. “He will do nicely, and he is at a breedable age. I will be able to continue on the Malfoy name with him.”</p><p>            “That was why we waited until you were twenty-one Draco. Perfect age to start reproducing pups, and this is also a strong and capable Omega. He’ll produce you strong pups.” Lucius spoke. “Now if you excuse me, I know the guards gave him a shot to induce his first ever heat, and I do not want to ruin your first time with him.” With that, Lucius turned heel and walked away.</p><p>            “You look so lovely in green Omega, and I can’t wait to take you when the drug takes effect.” Draco joyfully spoke.</p><p>            Harry couldn’t believe what he just heard and hoped that he had heard wrong. He had been taking suppressants, there was no way a drug could force his body into a heat. Harry moaned out in pain as he felt a cramp roll through him, and his hole slowly start to produce slick, and he couldn’t believe that he was entering a heat. He forced his green eyes to look up, and all he saw was grey eyes staring back at him, ready to devour him. Harry shivered as he knew what was coming next.</p>
