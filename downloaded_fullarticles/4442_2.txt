    <p>Queenie was fourteen years old, her blond hair falling in waves to her midback. Her legilimency was exceptional, but she had learned to hide it. She was developed for her age, her long eyelashes and cheeky smile meaning that half of the alphas in Ilvermorny were after her.</p><p>But she shared a room with Teenie, and that meant she knew she was safe. Her older sister was her protector and her best friend, and kept the other students away by threatening to tear anyone who touched Queenie without her permission limb from limb. Queenie didn't mind. She found it funny, how her sister would launch in to defend anyone who needed it, how Tina would protect her without even thinking of it. </p><p>"You do need to calm down a little Teenie." She teased as she braided her sister's dark hair. "I don't mind the boys talking to me. I kinda like it." <br/>"You have no idea what they want to do to you Queenie."<br/>"Course I know silly. I can read it in their mind and in their eyes. But they ain't going to get a chance to do it. Anyone tries something, and I'll threaten to let their greatest secret out. They back away when I do that." Queenie carefully spelled some ribbon into flowers, and settled them in her sister's hair.<br/>"There you go." She waved her wand, and called the mirror over. "Pretty as a princess. Any boy would wanna ask you to the ball."</p><p>Teenie looked a little nervous, and Queenie heard her thoughts loud in the silence of the room.  Sh paused, and then smiled brightly. "Any girl would either .."<br/>"You don't mind?" Tina asked, and Queenie shook her head. She felt the terror that filled her sister's thoughts giving way to hope that she wouldn't be hated, and an overwhelming sense of relief. <br/>"I don't mind at all." She promised. "Now, I need you to do my hair."</p><p>***</p><p>Tina stepped out with a couple of the omegas that Queenie knew. She spent a couple of months dating a girl in Thunderbird who was in Queenie's year, but eventually it didn't work out. Tina started training to be an auror, and Queenie passed her exams. She didn't get exceptional grades. Didn't particularly want them. Her focus was on some of the alphas in the school, and her friends. She stepped out with a few of the guys, but it never got too serious.</p><p>She wasn't the kind of girl who wanted to bond. Even when she got older, and the parties started serving fizzy shots of giggle water, she was clear on that. Sex was fun, sex was great. But whoever she was sleeping with would let her into their thoughts, and that would chase her away. She was seen as the kind of omega you messed around with, not the kind you mated, and she heard that in thoughts often enough. People would look at her and think she was beautiful, and that was all they cared about.</p><p>Eventually she joined MACUSA, making tea and fetching and carrying in the wand permit office. It wasn't a challenging section, but there was an omega deputy in charge who was a sweetheart, and who was too busy day-dreaming about his husband to send a glance her way.  She got to bring the aurors coffee, and that meant she met all the people in Tina's stories.</p><p>Teenie always smiled whenever Queenie waltzed in carrying a tea tray, and that never failed to brighten her day. Abernathy would comment on her dresses and say how nice she looked, and when he said it there was no double meaning, no insincere perversion hidden in his words. </p><p>She got home earlier than Tina, but that meant she could make a start on dinner, floating the food to the table as her sister stepped through the door. One day Tina's smile was brighter than normal, her mind drifting. A sense of warmth and comfort flowed from her, and Queenie smiled, glad her sister was happy.<br/>"You found a new omega?" She asked softly, startled as the mental walls her sister built but rarely used all slammed into place.<br/>"Leave it." Tina muttered, eating. The rest of the evening was tense, and Queenie went to her bed feeling conflicted. She knew Tina was happy. After years of Tina dating girls it wasn't a surprise. She wondered who the new woman was.</p><p>Tina wasn't going to say, and to Queenie that meant it was time to investigate for herself, and prove to the world that Tina wasn't the only clever one. She followed her sister, taking up coffees and watching her at lunch time. She asked around and tried to listen in, but no one was talking. No omega was joyously walking around the office the way they normally did when they had found themselves a new mate. </p><p>The answer came when she went to bring Director Graves a coffee. The alpha was sitting at his desk surrounded by a mountain of paperwork, the president beside him deep in conversation. She paused there for a moment, holding the tray, unsure where to put it down.</p><p>"Miss Goldstein?" The President spoke, and she nearly jumped, startled her name was known. <br/>"Yes ma'am?"<br/>"I do hope you can speak to your sister about our conversation yesterday." The president had thick mental walls but for a moment Queenie felt warmth from her as the President gazed into her eyes and let the barriers drop for a second.  Queenie nodded and scurried away, shock across her features.</p><p>"So, this lady you've got an eye on?" She asked Tina that evening. Tina shook her head.<br/>"Leave it Queenie."<br/>"I want to know. They're in MACUSA right?"</p><p>Tina glared, but Queenie tried to hold her gaze. It took a moment but Tina's resistance dropped, and Queenie was met with a sense of anger and self-disgust, the emotion of someone who had hoped that they could hide what they felt.</p><p>Then, after a second, an image of the President floated into view, along with Tina's shame.<br/>"She's an alpha." Tina whispered after a moment. Queenie reached out and squeezed her hand.<br/>"She is. And she likes you."<br/>"The President couldn't date another alpha. It's not proper-" Tina protested, squirming a little. Queenie arched an eyebrow and shook her head.<br/>"Teenie. You could be happy with this. Don't... don't throw it away over worries about what other people might think."</p><p>"You're too good at this." Tina protested, but she smiled as she spoke, so Queenie suspected she didn't really care as much as she made out.<br/>The next day, when Tina came home late with the brightest smile Queenie had seen in months, she knew that Tina didn't mind at all.</p>
