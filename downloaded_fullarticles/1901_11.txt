"Same as always. No exciting events like when you and your friends broke in using polyjuice, dad."</p><p>Ron smirked. "Hey, that was for a good cause."</p><p>Hugo said, "I know."</p><p>Lavender told him, "I called you here for another reason. I have some news I think both of my boys will want to hear."</p><p>Hugo sighed. "Please don't tell me you started calling dad Won Won again, mum?"</p><p>Ron reassured him, "That will never happen again."</p><p>Lavender smiled. "I'm pregnant."</p><p>Hugo gasped. "Already?"</p><p>Ron grinned. "That's wonderful news, Lav."</p><p>Lavender pulled them into a hug and beamed, "I can't quite believe it either, but we're going to be parents again and you're going to be a big brother."</p></div>
