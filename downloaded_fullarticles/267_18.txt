    <p>Part I: Fall 1943</p><p>September the first and it was hotter and swampier than a hippogriff’s arse. Walburga Black had spent a full hour in front of her Venetian mirror only to have her makeup start melting off as soon as she stepped foot outside.</p><p>“Let’s go, it’s nearly half-eight!” Her mother, Irma, stood on the pavement, shrieking and making a general fool of herself. “Cygnus! Where is your trunk?”</p><p>
“Kreacher has gone off somewhere,” came her brother’s obnoxious voice through the open door from the foyer of Number 12 Grimmauld Place. “Can one of you levitate it out here? I’d like to keep my robes scuff-free.” </p><p>“Walburga, go help your brother,” Irma sighed. “Make it quick and don’t you dare App—”</p><p>Walburga was already gone, squeezing through tiny particles until she was wobbling on her heels in Cygnus’ bedroom. No way in hell was she traipsing up the stairs like a muggle idiot in those.</p><p>She held out her manicured hands for balance as the room filled with whistles, smacking of lips, and “hey, handsome!” Then it cut sharply off as the posters of females—both witch and mermaid—realized it was she and not her brother. </p><p>Walburga spared a glance around, wrinkling her nose in disgust, before her eyes fell on Cygnus’ trunk. It was open, his neatly-folded robes and stacked textbooks on display. All the doing of Kreacher, the house-elf, of course—Cygnus didn’t know how to fold a handkerchief. Walburga slammed the trunk closed and pulled out her willow and thestral-hair wand. <em>Wingardium Leviosa!</em> </p><p>The trunk rose and hovered a neat six inches off the ground. She waved her wand and sent it out the door, throwing one last look of contempt at a particularly slender mermaid giggling and splashing in crystal-blue water.</p><p>No sooner than Walburga had stepped foot into the corridor, Cygnus barked from the bottom of the stairs, “Oi, Walburga, what’s taking you so long?”</p><p>“So sorry, your highness,” she replied in a sickly-sweet voice, feeling her temper rise. “Here, let me speed it up.” With a sharp flick of her wand, she sent the trunk zooming down the stairs.</p><p>Cygnus stood frozen dumb for a moment, jumping away just a second too late as the trunk crashed into his chest, knocking him to the floor. A loud “oof!” filled the corridor along with the <em>thump </em>of his rear connecting with the creaking wood.</p><p>Walburga opened her mouth and let out a raucous <em>hah-hah-hah</em>, stretching her cheeks with the first grin she’d had in weeks. Not much fun to be had in the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black.</p><p>“You sodding shrew!” Cygnus howled, jumping to his feet and smoothing down his robes.</p><p>Clomping down the stairs, Walburga thought of a response to add insult to injury, but then Irma’s heels advanced and she appeared in the archway of the foyer a second later, foaming at the mouth. “For heaven’s sake, Walburga! Are you a pureblood witch or a monkey playing with a stick?”</p><p>“The latter,” mumbled Cygnus as he walked out, wincing and guiding his trunk. </p><p>“You could’ve seriously injured him! Just what was going on in that empty head of yours?” </p><p>“Alright, Mother, don’t have a cow,” Walburga snapped, rolling her eyes. She pushed past Irma and headed to her own trunk, next to her younger brother Alphard’s. He stood nearby, simply gazing around Grimmauld Place until a sleek black Ministry car pulled up to the curb.</p><p>“Oh, there they are—POLLUX!” Irma screeched, causing all three of her children to cringe. “Where on Earth is he? You lot get in the car <em>now</em>.”</p><p>The passenger-side door opened and their uncle, Arcturus, stepped out, solemn-faced as usual. “Greetings, children. Reginald will collect your trunks into the car. Please have a seat alongside Lucretia and Orion.” </p><p>As if on cue, the driver’s side door swung open, revealing a stout man with a pointed mustache and top hat. “Yes, I will take care of the trunks, Sir Black.”</p><p>Irma came back outside, huffing and puffing. “…and that damned house-elf has cleared off somewhere, right when we need it…” Her tight-lipped husband, Pollux, ignored her and slammed the front door so hard the brass doorknocker and windows rattled. Apparently, Irma had given him an earful in the parlor.</p><p>Hurrying to get away from her parents, Walburga clasped onto the car door handle and pulled it open. “Hello, Walburga,” her cousin, Lucretia, called cheerfully as she climbed in and slid her rear next to hers. “You look quite lovely. As do you, Cygnus and Alphard.” </p><p>“Mm,” Walburga said, not in the mood to exchange pleasantries. Especially with Cygnus’ stupid leg nearly crushing hers. “D’you think you can move over?”</p><p>“Not a chance, dear sister,” he replied in a sing-song, further grating her nerves. </p><p>Thankfully, it was a short ride to King’s Cross, since the Ministry car could weave through the muggle traffic. Walburga assumed Reginald would simply deposit them in front of King’s Cross, but he accompanied them to Platform 9¾ to help load the trunks onto the Hogwarts Express.</p><p>The sight of the train was rather welcoming to her after a long, dull summer stuck with her family. Though she was of-age and free to Apparate wherever she pleased—well, behind Irma’s back—she had nowhere to go.</p><p>The Blacks had arrived late, so the goodbyes were hurried. Cygnus went first, of course smothered in hugs from Irma and words of encouragement regarding OWLs from Pollux. Alphard got a condensed version of that, and then it was Walburga’s turn. She did not expect any encouragement about NEWTs, for her parents couldn’t give less of a damn about her academic performance. Instead, she received lectures from both of her parents, outlining their expectations of her in great detail. </p><p>“Walburga, it is <em>imperative </em>that you find a wizard worthy of continuing the Black bloodline <em>this year,” </em>Irma hissed in a low voice. “You shouldn’t even be attending Hogwarts anymore but because you can’t grasp simple concepts, such as how to be a proper witch, here we are. My patience is wearing thin.”</p><p>This was Walburga’s cue to pretend she cared, so she nodded her head and said in a monotone, “Yes, Mother.”</p><p>Pollux was more pragmatic: “Things will not work in your favor if I have to travel to Hogwarts to explain away your embarrassing behavior. Keep your place, Walburga.”</p><p>She was saved from having to form a response by the loud train whistle, signaling her to get moving. “Goodbye, Mother and Father,” she called over her shoulder. Relief of finally getting away from them swelled in her chest before she heard Irma’s reply. </p><p>“Oh, and you’d do well to slim down your figure a bit!”</p><p>Fortunately, there weren’t many people still on the platform, but the remark was nonetheless mortifying, enhanced by Felix Lestrange saddling up beside her and winking. “Don’t worry, Wally-girl. I think your figure’s just swell.”</p><p>Scowling, Walburga stomped onto the train, deciding it wasn’t worth whipping out her wand.</p><p>A group of tiny little swots convened near the front compartments fell silent and huddled closer together upon seeing her coming. She glared hard at each of their sniveling faces as she passed, nose turned up. She felt like she’d make a good warrior, since almost everyone cowered in her presence. Though that was likely more attributed to her reputation.</p><p>After a few minutes of walking around like a dolt, peering into frosted windows, Walburga finally found the compartment occupied by the upper-year Slytherin girls. She slid open the door and stepped through, feeling the air change as they, too, fell silent and stared at her. </p><p>“Ah, there you are, Wally!” Lucretia called, smiling. “Come sit here!”</p><p>Walburga cringed internally and took a seat, directing another hard glare into Aurelia Parkinson’s murky, pond-scum-colored eyes. The witches were arranged in a certain order in accordance with the pureblood hierarchy: Next to the window were the heiresses of the most pristine bloodlines, Druella Rosier and Lucretia Black, who everyone preferred leagues more than Walburga. She and Parkinson came next, and after them were Beryl Fawley and Semele Selwyn. Selwyn’s two cousins, the Messier sisters, sat next to her, and beyond that Walburga didn’t care to know their names. </p><p>Not a single damn one of them liked Walburga, but of course they were going to tolerate her if only for Lucretia and their family name. </p><p>Lucretia—they were all supposed to be listening to her recent vacation in the south of France. Since Walburga had not been invited due to her near-expulsion last academic year, by default a disgrace to her family, she tuned it out. </p><p>Everyone else was enraptured, of course. Lucretia was the prettier, more charismatic Black heiress. Tall, slim, with sleek black hair, she resembled a French fashion model. Conversely, Walburga looked like a slightly chubbier Alice in Wonderland except with dark, narrowed eyes. She wanted to hate Lucretia, but she was so bloody <em>sweet, </em>even to her wayward cousin no one liked, that it was rather hard to hate her.</p><p><em>It is imperative that you find a wizard…</em>Irma’s annoying voice rang over and over in Walburga’s mind as her eyes strayed out the window to the passing countryside. Lucretia would have no problem finding a husband, but Walburga was a different story. Her reputation wasn’t exactly stellar, and her blood status could only excuse so much. </p><p>I <em>must </em>get it together this year, she vowed to herself, not wanting to imagine being thrown into adulthood without a husband or the family’s gold. <em>I must, I must, I must… </em></p><p>✧</p><p>Like the start of every other school year on the Hogwarts Express, Professor Slughorn had gathered his group of upper-year elites, who he called the Slug Club, in his compartment around a large, wooden table. Horrible name aside, it was this gathering of wizards that would get Tom Riddle to the top, where he belonged.</p><p>The boys were arranged by year, the seventh-years closest to Slughorn. And the food, which did not go unnoticed by Tom after a diet of pea soup at Wool’s all summer. On either side of the rotund professor were Felix Lestrange and Abraxas Malfoy, his ultimate favorites, but Tom had been bumped up quite a few seats. Now he sat on Malfoy’s left, between him and James Avery. The Black cousins, all three of them staring off with dull eyes and blank minds—save for Alphard, the youngest, they really weren’t that bright—sat across the table in front of butterbeer mugs and a plate of treacle tarts.</p><p>Slughorn was talking, relentlessly talking, and Tom felt his own mind wandering to the wondrous events of the summer, the highlights puncturing extreme, intense boredom at Wool’s. The ultimate highlight was, of course, obtaining the treasure that would hopefully become his second horcrux, depending how far he could push the boundaries of magic.</p><p>He twirled the onyx ring on his right hand, noticing Avery glancing at it out of the corner of his eye, likely wondering where he’d gotten it. None of his business, as far as Tom was concerned; he’d already proven his descent from Salazar Slytherin. Avery didn’t need the whole damn history. </p><p>And now, this sweet summer to add. The ring was particularly significant, for it signified the stepping stone from boy to man. Other boys, wizard and muggle alike, considered themselves men just by thrusting into some silly slag, but that was why they were little boys still. Not Tom.</p><p>Briefly, he tuned into Slughorn’s one-sided conversation to ensure he wasn’t missing anything of value. Not even remotely so: he was speaking to the obnoxious fourth-year Felix Murdoch about the Floo Network disruption last month, for the boy’s father was head of the department. Of course, Herbert Murdoch knew sod all how to handle it, but his precious boy sure tried to convince the group that it was all under control.</p><p>Back to that hot summer evening, when Tom had finally pulled the Trace from his body and Apparated to a village called Little Hangleton that might’ve been charming if its two most well-known inhabitants weren’t pure scum. </p><p>The first was his inbred uncle, Marvolo Gaunt, owner of the onyx ring. The man had been sitting in his filthy cabin in a dumb, drunk stupor, and yet he’d been useful, directing him to that worthless waste of air Riddle and relinquishing his wand, although not voluntarily.</p><p>Another dip into the present—Slughorn was now speaking about the Holyhead Harpies, nothing worth paying attention to—and back to one of Tom’s fondest memories. The manor house upon the hill, the initial anger at how his filthy muggle father was living in extravagance while his powerful wizard of a son was crouching in an orphanage during the air-raids—</p><p>No, enough thinking about Wool’s, he scolded himself. <em>You will come of age in four months and never have to return there. </em>He should burn it to the ground for good measure.</p><p>Next to him, the left-handed Avery lifted his mug at the same time as Tom, bumping into his elbow and spilling a splash of butterbeer onto his lap. You’d think the fool would’ve learned to control his anomaly by now, Tom thought, but he couldn’t be too irritated, for the flash of fear in the boy’s eyes was worth the spot of damp on his leg.</p><p>“So sorry, mate,” Avery whispered urgently. “Here, let me…” He reached for his handkerchief, but Tom held up a hand, dabbing his own against his lap. </p><p>“Not to worry, James. We’ll be changing into our Hogwarts robes soon.” </p><p>“Ah, yes, reckon we should do that now, as it’s getting dark already,” said Lestrange, breaking an apparent lull in the conversation as Slughorn stuffed his face with treacle tarts. “What do you think?”</p><p>He directed the question at Tom rather than Slughorn, who also waited along with the others for an answer. Tom shrugged carelessly and nodded.</p><p>The last compartment on the right was empty and waiting for them, since everyone knew it was usually reserved for the Slytherin boys. While changing into their Hogwarts robes, they fell into discussion about which witches had grown more attractive over the summer.</p><p>“Mate, did you see Fawley?”</p><p>“The older Messier’s looking fine this year.”</p><p>“A bit too peckish for my taste. Rosier is something else, though.” </p><p>“Rosier’s mine, fool. Try Parkinson.” </p><p>“Eurgh, no thanks. I’d rather have a hippogriff.”</p><p>The conversation only grew even duller, so Tom revisited the manor atop the grassy hill, stark against the moonlight, the door swinging open easily, quietly, because of course the muggle idiots didn’t lock it. The long corridor of portraits depicting the muggle bloodline he was about to sever. <em>Riddle. </em>One day, he would no longer be Riddle.</p><p><em>Who are you? </em>That was real fear, the sweetest because Tom had craved it since the moment he’d realized his father was still alive.</p><p><em>Goodbye, Father</em>. The burst of green light had been so strong, so controlled despite the foreign wand. All fueled by Tom’s magical ability. He’d departed right after, leaving them limp and dead on their velvet sofas.</p><p>“Lestrange, did you end up going to Versailles?” Malfoy asked, glancing at Tom out of the side of his eye. Now they were going to recount their luxurious holidays, knowing he couldn’t relate. <em>Go on, dolts, enjoy the last little bit of power you’ve got left.</em></p><p>“Nah, mate, we went to Iceland instead. Blimey, it’s beautiful over there. Not hot like here, and at night, these green waves of light start up in the sky! Not too frequent this time of year, unfortunately, but at least I saw them once…”</p><p>Tom didn’t care how extravagant their vacations were. While the others were looking at the northern lights and girls’ arses, he was making himself immortal. One thing his shit life had taught him thus far was that true value couldn’t be bought with status or gold.</p><p>In fact, he thought, turning to the window where the sun was sinking behind the sloping hills, green light filling his head, his own <em>Avada Kedavra </em>echoing in his ears—in fact, he’d had the best holiday out of all of them.</p><p>✦</p><p>While Felix Lestrange prattled on about how amazing Iceland is, with its cool breezes and 24-hour days, Abraxas Malfoy fought hard to keep his eyes off the bloke sitting next to Lestrange by the name of James Avery. </p><p>Abraxas knew he was the one who’d gone to Versailles—he knew quite a bit about Avery through his own doing—but he was prompting him to talk. Except Avery didn’t speak unless it was absolutely necessary, and now with Lestrange taking over the conversation, all hope was lost for the rest of the train ride and possibly the whole evening. The pompous bloke loved the sound of his own voice.</p><p>Next to him sat Tom Riddle, who had gone from scapegoat to leader of the elite seemingly overnight. There had been a reason, of course. Abraxas tried not to shudder as he recalled the cold, dark chamber, low hissing, and rumbling of stone as the beast advanced… The Malfoys were not far from Salazar Slytherin themselves, but Abraxas was perfectly fine not being the true heir.</p><p>Riddle was also not listening to the conversation, staring out the window. Not exactly a surprise, since he’d been stuck in Muggle London all summer, so he had no holiday tales to tell. Plus, sometimes he fell into this quiet trance; the others knew not to disturb him when he was like this.</p><p>Abraxas was glad to have him out of the way, for Riddle was sharp, picking up everything when he was engaged. Now Abraxas could let his eyes stay to the one person he couldn’t get out of his head all summer. </p><p>Tall, dark-haired, with a scowlish mouth and grey-green eyes, Avery would likely land himself on the cover of <em>Witch Weekly </em>one day in the near future. Generally, the wizards featured had to be a productive member of society in addition to being handsome, but the Avery family was so wealthy and well-known, their eldest heir could go on a murder spree and still have witches flocking to him upon stepping foot in Diagon Alley. </p><p>The best part was that Avery was not interested in them. Not if the gathering at the Rosier Manor last month was any indication. </p><p>Concentrating on keeping his eyes on his knees, hoping like hell his face wouldn’t flush, Abraxas brought up the memory of that party. Countless times he’d gone over it since then, but the strength of its effect hadn’t diminished a bit.</p><p>The Rosiers’ manor was on an absurdly large plot of land, which had a patio and its own small lake. Around this, the Rosiers’ 12 or so house-elves arranged a feast on large, round tables. As usual, the gang of Slytherin boys—minus Lestrange, who was in Iceland, and Riddle, who was not answering owls—convened at one of the tables. Abraxas had been seated next to Avery.</p><p>He’d sort of been eyeing the other boy for the past year, but he would never act upon his fancy; that was a great way to ruin the Malfoy legacy in less than a day. Besides that, it was clear Avery wasn’t interested in anyone, since he’d never acted like it—until that evening.</p><p>Everyone had been drinking firewhiskey and Abraxas, woozy and hot, excused himself to go for a walk and clear his head. He’d gotten pissed too fast and did not want to do anything embarrassing. Anywhere outside would’ve caught attention, so he’d gone inside the Rosiers’ house and Avery had found him in the dining hall, plucking a treacle tart from a porcelain plate and taking a bite. <em>Oi, still hungry, mate?</em></p><p>Abraxas had only chuckled, unable to meet his eyes, but Avery was much more forward: <em>I’ve seen your eyes on me quite a bit tonight. </em>A smirk on those pretty lips, a touch of the hand. <em>Don’t be shy. </em></p><p>Then their mouths were connecting and the older boy’s hands were around Abraxas’ waist and all was right for the first time in a long while. But Avery had ended it, without a word since.</p><p>This year, Abraxas vowed to himself, hell, this <em>week</em>, I’m going to get him— </p><p>“Oi, Lestrange, enough already!” barked Cygnus Black suddenly, cutting through the best part of Abraxas’ memory. He blinked and found himself back in the compartment on the Hogwarts Express. </p><p>Cygnus was glowering at Lestrange, while his cousin, Orion, blinked sleepily and wiped a thin stream of drool from his chin with the sleeve of his robes. Riddle was also back in the compartment, watching and listening. </p><p>Abraxas snuck a glance at Avery, but the other was looking at Felix Murdoch, who was poking his head between the glass doors in search of the trolley. “Hello, madam?” he was calling. “I’d really, really like a chocolate frog!”</p><p>“No one cares,” someone called back from down the aisle.</p><p>“Murdoch, for Merlin’s sake, we’ll be at Hogwarts in five minutes,” Victor Mulciber said. </p><p>“Yes, sit down and shut up,” added Icarus Yaxley, the rudest, most egotistical fourth-year Abraxas had ever encountered.</p><p>Mulciber was right: the train stopped a little over five minutes later. As soon as it came to a complete stop, Tom Riddle got to his feet and stalked out of the compartment as if he couldn’t stand the group for another second. Abraxas, to prevent himself from watching Avery, stuck to Riddle’s heels as they hauled their trunks and left the train, beating the chaotic mass of students.</p><p>Outside was no more organized, since it was pitch dark and the Hogwarts groundskeeper was nowhere to be found. Someone stumbled into Abraxas, sending his knees slamming into his trunk. Wincing in pain, he took a step back and nearly knocked over a first-year.</p><p>“<em>Lumos</em>,” he grumbled, finally upright and clasping his wand, swiveling the trunk behind him. Then he faced forward and collided with Riddle standing rigid in front of him.</p><p>“I’m so sor—” he began, but Riddle cut him off without a trace of rancor. </p><p>“Abraxas, do you notice something different about the horse-less carriages this year?”</p><p>“No,” Abraxas replied slowly, giving the carriages a hard look. They appeared the same as they had for the past five years: old wood about to fall apart, guided by their own wheels and reins hovering in front of them, empty.</p><p>He glanced at Riddle, wondering if the elder was giving some type of test that Abraxas was obviously failing. But all Riddle said was, “Let’s get on the carriages before they fill up.”</p><p>They left their trunks in the growing pile, where the groundskeeper finally showed up, and walked to a half-empty carriage. Just as Abraxas was about to climb on, someone bumped shoulders with him—Avery.</p><p>“Sorry, mate,” Avery said tonelessly before stepping ahead onto the carriage after Riddle, leaving Abraxas slightly wounded. Why did Avery have to be so bloody stoic <em>all </em>the time? </p><p>Enough, he scolded himself, stop being such a little girl. After him the rest of the boys piled in, making for a hectic few minutes as they all situated themselves. Murdoch and Yaxley, the fourth-years, were left behind, which no one was particularly fussed about. </p><p>The sight of the castle, a vast, black silhouette against the night sky, lifted Abraxas’ spirits, but that was nothing compared to their journey across the Black Lake when Avery sat right next to him and surreptitiously squeezed his hand.</p><p>Abraxas glanced at him, astonished, and the other boy gave him a small wink before gazing out over the unnervingly dark lake. A jolt of something—need, desire, excitement—stirred in Abraxas’ stomach, reaching between his legs. He wanted Avery to touch him again and he wouldn’t, but at least their legs were pressed together. Good enough.</p><p>Before they stood to exit the carriage, Abraxas sent his vow silently to the back of Avery’s smooth, dark-haired head: <em>This year, I will have you…</em></p>
