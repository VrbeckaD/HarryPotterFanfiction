    <p>Sirius waited at the base of the Dark Tower, idly shooting sparks at summer flies. He’d never tell James but Quidditch drills were dull as hell. A game was one thing. In a game, you had a good chance of seeing somebody take a bludger to the face and you were almost guaranteed a broom crash. James was just trying to coach second years on flying in formation. With Remus tutoring Peter and James on the pitch, Sirius was left to his own, bored devices.</p><p>Not that Sirius minded being on his own. He spent most of the summer alone if he could manage it. In Grimmauld Place, he’d be content to hole up in the attic with a book but Hogwarts had set the bar just a bit higher.</p><p>One thing Sirius Black couldn’t stand was boredom.</p><p>Maybe that was why he caught Snape, sneaking up from the dungeons with his wand drawn. He had trouble tunnel vision as Remus was fond of saying. He twirled his wand between his fingers, sauntering out of the shadows.</p><p>“Alright, Snivellus?”  He barked, pleased at the way the greasy, git flinched at the name. Beady black eyes darted about, looking for the rest. The second he realized Sirius was alone, Snape pointed his wand.</p><p>“<em>Levi-</em>”</p><p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” Sirius snapped, flicking Snape’s wand away from him. “Fuck’s sake, Snape, you should know me better by now.”</p><p>“You’re full of surprises tonight, Black. You’ve never had the nerve to attack on your own before.” The crack in his voice somewhat undercut the insults. “Where’s the rest of the trash?”</p><p>“I’m sure you’d like to know. Don’t think you’re subtle, sneaking around after Remus. What? Evans gave you the boot so you’ve settled on another out of your league Gryffindor?”</p><p>That stung. Snape snarled and looked like he might attack Sirius again, wand or not. That might be entertaining, muggle fisticuffs, but no, Snape was no such warrior. He’d rather hex you with your back turned.</p><p>“I know you’re up to something, you and that half breed scum! I’ve seen you lurking around the willow-”</p><p> “Oh no, you saw us approach a tree.” Sirius clutched imaginary pearls around his neck. “Have you owled Dumbledore yet?”</p><p>“I’ll figure it out and when I do, you all be out of here.”</p><p>“And then you’ll be king of the school, won’t you, Snivvy?” Sirius snorted. “ ‘Cause that’s all that was standing in your way.”</p><p>They glared at each other for a long moment. Sirius never thought he could hate someone quite as much as he hated his family but Snape was so close. Some slime covered blood supremacist with the gaul to target his friends. To target Moony of all people. Couldn’t hold his own in the classroom or the halls so he’d set his shriveled little heart on getting Remus tossed out. “<em>Petrificus Totalus</em>!” He flicked his wand and Snape’s arms and legs jerked together. He fell to the grass with a crunch. Sirius tossed Snape’s wand, next to him, just a couple feet from his greasy head. He thought about kicking him.</p><p>“You want to know about the tree, Snape? There’s a knot on the north side,” Sirius sneered. “Press that and the branches freeze. Just for about thirty seconds, but it’s long enough to slip down inside.”</p><p>Snape’s black eyes twitched in his skull. “I don’t recommend it for you though. Hate for that big, ugly nose to get chomped off. Your death eater friends might get confused.”</p><p>“Sirius!” James came up at a sprint. “What are you doing?!”</p><p>“Not sure yet.” He smiled as James reached them, still in his Quidditch gear. “Any ideas?” He aimed a swift kick into Snape’s frozen stomach.</p><p>“Why would you-” James glanced down at Snape, suddenly wary. “C’mon. Leave him.”</p><p>“Sure? We could-”</p><p>“Now, Sirius.” James snapped, refusing to be amused. He grabbed Sirius’s arm and dragged him to the castle.</p><p>“The hell are you playing at?” James hissed. “You told Snape about The Willow?! Snape!”</p><p>“Relax.” Sirius scoffed. “If anyone deserved a whooping, it’s that greasy git. Did you hear him on about Remus?”</p><p>“You think Remus wants Snape knowing about him?” James snapped. “What the hell were you thinking?”</p><p>“Look, the Shack’s empty 29 days of the month.” Sirius said, suddenly uncomfortable. “Snape’s never getting passed those branches and even if he did, he’s not gonna find anything! He’ll stop sniffing around the tree and we’ll be fine. It’s fine.”</p><p>“You’d better hope it is.” James said with a backwards glance to Snape’s frozen form. “If Remus finds out-”</p><p>“You’re not gonna tell him.”</p><p>James shook his head. “He gets worried enough as it is. We’ll keep an extra eye out at the next moon and hope Snape doesn’t try anything.”</p><p>“Alright,” Sirius said. They slowed down to a walk once they’d reached the staircase to Gryffindor tower. “How’s Quidditch?”</p><p>By the time they reached the common room, James was animatedly describing the hopelessness of his new Chasers and Remus and Peter were contentedly snacking on chocolate frogs. Sirius didn’t think about Severus Snape for the rest of the evening.  </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>Snape used Wingardium Leviosa to get passed The Willow. Apparently, it took a couple of tries but the Slytherin was nothing if not persistent. He’d been watching the Marauders for some time and knew that Remus Lupin only disappeared on the full moon. He had waited until ten o’clock, when the thing was really full in the sky, before heading down to catch them.</p><p>He had never expected the Werewolf.</p><p><em>Not,</em> Remus thought, as Dumbledore explained what happened in the hospital wing, <em>because the signs weren’t there. Because no one would ever imagine a werewolf allowed in a school full of children. </em></p><p>“We are extremely fortunate that no one was hurt. Mr. Potter arrived at the very extremely last second. I assume you told him about your affliction.”</p><p>Remus nodded. It was one of his final memories before the wolf took over completely. He’d been doubled over on the floor of the shack when Prongs suddenly shifted back into James. He swore and raced to the door, open just a crack. Remus caught a glimpse of pasty white skin and the Wolf smelled flesh.</p><p>Later, James would tell him that Padfoot jumped between them, stopping Remus from savaging his best mate, but Remus wasn’t in the mood to hear it.</p><p>“Well,” Dumbledore said, “an understandable, if foolish, impulse. Severus, of course, has been sworn to secrecy.”</p><p>“Am I expelled?” Remus’s voice cracked.</p><p>“Of course not, dear boy.” Dumbledore looked disturbed at the very question. “You, Mr. Black and Mr. Snape all behaved with extreme carelessness and you’ll receive consequences but removing you from Hogwarts is unnecessary.”</p><p>“Sirius?”</p><p>“Mr. Black confessed it was he who informed Mr. Snape on how to bypass the Willow.”</p><p>Remus felt like his insides had collapsed in on themselves. “Why?”</p><p>“It appears the enmity between Mr. Snape and Mr. Black grew beyond what any of us were aware of.” Dumbledore said in a dark voice. “He claims he only wished Snape to tangle with the Willow but-” he sighed deeply. “Did you also tell Mr. Black of your affliction?”</p><p>“He worked it out,” Remus said hollowly. Sirius had been the first to put it all together, half way through second year. More amazingly, he’d kept it to himself until he figured out the Animagus plan and brought James and Peter on board.</p><p>They were sitting in the common room, just the two of them, joking around with a game of exploding snap. Sirius was so casual. <em>Full moon tonight. You want company on the way down to the Hospital Wing or would Pomfrey get suspicious?</em></p><p>Remus had sputtered and made excused but Sirius just shrugged. <em>You don’t have to lie anymore. We all know.</em></p><p>He’d been quick to clarify that only he, James and Peter knew when he saw the terror on Remus’s face. Over the next few months, that terror faded into relief. They knew. He didn’t have to live in fear of them finding out and abandoning him. They knew and they didn’t care. He could talk to them about it and-</p><p>What a fool he’d been.</p><p>Dumbledore seemed to read his thoughts. He put a hand on Remus’s shoulder. “You’re not the first young man to misjudge a friend, Remus.”</p><p>Remus blinked hard, staring down at his bed sheets. Everything hurt, hurt more than he’d thought possible. It was worse than the change. He wished Dumbledore would go and leave him alone.</p><p>“Once you’ve recovered, you will report to Professor McGonagall each evening for detention for the next three weeks.” Professor Dumbledore said, his usual brisk self. “Mr. Potter and Mr. Black are most anxious to speak to you but it is up to your discretion.</p><p>Remus swallowed hard. “I don’t want to see Sirius. I don’t want to see any one.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded. He stood and watched Remus for a few silent moments. “I will inform them. Get some rest, Remus.”</p><p>He turned and left without another word.</p><p>He knew he ought to thank Dumbledore, for letting him off with detention, rather than expulsion or criminal charges. He knew most werewolves never even got the chance to attend school, let alone make friends. He should be grateful. He should be on bended knee, thanking his lucky stars but, alone in the hospital wing, all Remus could do was sob.  </p>
