<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">No one really talked about it. He seemed kind of embarrassed about it, so maybe that was why. Either way, Harry Potter didn't know until the two of them became aurors; until Harry was legally required to know for his safety and the safety of others.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Mr. Potter," Robards sighed. "You know, of course, that you are a... special addition to this department."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry nodded. There was no need for beating around the bush, he knew what that meant.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"You have been assigned a partner whom I hope you will be able to keep an eye on better than some at this establishment. You already know him, so I believe it should make things easier." He frowned. "However."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"However, sir?" Harry prompted.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"However, you should know that your potential partner has given us a bit of crucial information, as required upon entry, about a medical condition."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Alright," Harry replied hesitantly. "What kind of condition?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Lycanthropy."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry's eyes widened. "Oh. That-- won't be a problem."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"As kind as that is, Mr. Potter, I'm not telling you because of the discrimination he may face. I'm telling you in case anything gets out of hand."</p>
</div><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr"><em>In other words, in case he tries to kill me</em>, Harry realized, but said nothing.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"You'll be given a regulation pamphlet explaining anything you might need to know, in general or in emergencies."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry nodded, biting his lip.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"And for obvious reasons, he will be taking three days off work each month during his..."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Transformation," Harry offered before he could say anything offensive or pandering.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Yes." Robards traced the edge of his desk with a finger. "Everything will be in the pamphlet," he said again, casting a charm under his breath. The pamphlet popped into existence in front of Harry, and he cringed at the cliché title: <em>So Your Coworker is a Werewolf.</em> There was a drawing of a wolf with a tie around its neck on the cover.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry forced himself to smile. "Thank you," he said between gritted teeth. "And may I ask," <em>as it's the more important part, I'd wager</em>, "who is my partner?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Draco Malfoy."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">***</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry peeked over the edge of the cubicle, trying to be sneaky.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Hello, Harry."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry started and stepped out from his hiding place. "Oh! You-- you saw me."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Malfoy-- no, Draco; they were coworkers, and even partners now-- looked up at him, smirking. "You're not very subtle."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry swallowed. "Right, well..." he stuck his hand out to Draco. "I've just been told we're partners."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">He expected Draco to sneer, refuse his hand, and make some catty remark. Instead, he smiled and shook Harry's hand.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Glad to be working with you," he added amicably, and pulled his hand back.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Really?" Harry asked.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Really. I'd like to put all of the nasty things I said and did to you behind us." He winced. "I grew up with some pretty bad influences, so I want you to know I'm working on not being such a brat."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry couldn't hold back his laugh. "You really were a bit of a brat, huh?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Draco chuckled. "I hope we get along from now on. I've always thought we had great chemistry."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry had a bit of déjà vu, back to before they had even been sorted, to when Draco had tried to convince him they'd be great friends. This time, Harry didn't feel as wary.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">But then he remembered.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Ah. Right. He also told me--" Harry cleared his throat and leaned close. "If it's uncomfortable for you to talk about," he hissed, "I understand. I just want you to know that I know."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Draco raised an eyebrow. "Know? Know what?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"About--" Harry glanced around and leaned yet closer. "About your condition."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">If it was possible, Draco's face grew even paler. He drew a sharp breath, eyes wide in contrast to his small pupils. "Oh. Yes. That."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry tried to smile. "I'm not against it or anything. I just thought you should know."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Right." Draco seemed frozen, unblinking and staring feverishly up at Harry. "I suppose it's important they tell you that sort of thing."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry nodded. "Right, well, they gave me some pamphlet or something. Might not read it, as long as--" he cut himself short. "Nevermind. He said it was important, so... I should read it. Right. I'll read it."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Draco nodded, but he was clearly somewhere else. "Alright, then."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry swallowed and leaned back into a relaxed position. "So, uh, I guess this is my desk?" He pointed to the desk beside Draco, who nodded again. "Great. Um. Awesome."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"We've got a few files to look over," Draco murmured, the little color he possessed returning to his face.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry nodded and sat at his new desk, feeling about as numb as Draco looked. He opened the file.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">***</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry had almost forgotten. It had been three weeks since he'd started his job, and he and Draco were actually getting along quite well. Then, that Tuesday, Draco didn't show up to work.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry waited a few minutes, looking at the latest case, before growing restless. He slipped out of his seat and walked to Ron's little cubicle.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Hey, mate," Ron said, grinning. "What's going on?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Have you seen Draco?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Ron blinked owlishly at him. "Today's his... you know. His day off."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"What day off?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Ron winced. "You know. That time of the month or whatever?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry's heart leapt into his throat. "Oh. Tonight's the--"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Last night, actually." Ron frowned. "I thought you were supposed to know, being his partner and all."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry blushed. "I guess I expected him to say something... he didn't even acknowledge it yesterday."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Would you?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">***</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Draco!" Harry practically squealed when his partner entered the office after three days of absence.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Draco looked up, caught off-guard. He had dark bags under his eyes. "Hello?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"I missed you," Harry smiled.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Draco flushed.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Ah-- no, that's not what I-- I was worried when you left!"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Draco nodded slowly. "Um... thank you, I suppose."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"I hope it wasn't too bad," Harry added.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"I usually don't remember much of it, so it was fine, I guess." Draco rubbed at his eyes. "Tired, mostly."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry sighed. "Thank goodness."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Draco looked confused. "People don't usually ask."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry shrugged. "You're my partner! Besides, I can't imagine going through all of that. You're super brave."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Draco stiffened, silent.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p></p><div dir="auto" align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry shifted his weight. "I'll try not to make a scene like this every month. Let's get back to work, alright?"</p>
</div>
