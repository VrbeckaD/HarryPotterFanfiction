    <p>"I'm going to kill him! Get off me, Remus, I'm going to fucking kill that traitorous, spineless little rat!" Sirius struggled against Remus as he tried to get free. </p><p>"Sirius, stop! Even if we can't take him home, we can still have visits with Harry, but not if you get yourself locked away in Azkaban. The Aurors will pick up Peter." Sirius kept struggling. "James would want us to be in Harry's life, now stop!" At the mention of his dead friend, Sirius stopped fighting. In fact, his whole body seemed to deflate and he sank into Remus. Putting his arms around the other man, he could feel the shaking of sobs.  After a while of them standing in the broken house, Remus apparated them home. </p><p>Groaning about having just fallen asleep, Remus rose to answer the fervent knocking on the door. </p><p>"Yes?" Remus tied his robe as he spoke.</p><p>"Is this the residence of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black." A gruff man in an Auror uniform stood on the stoop.</p><p>"It is. May I ask what this is about? We've had a long night and-"</p><p>"We need both of you to accompany us to the Ministry," The man's partner interjected.</p><p>"Again, may I ask what this is about?" Remus was beginning to sound annoyed.</p><p>"We've been asked to investigate any connections you two may have with the murders that occurred last night in Godric's Hollow," the first man explained.</p><p>"I'm not sure what connection you'll find, but you may wait here while I awake Sirius and get dressed." Remus closed the door, leaving the Aurors outside. After explaining to a tired Sirius that they had to get dressed to go to the Ministry, Remus dressed. </p><p>"Lead the way," Sirius stood behind Remus, who had greeted the Aurors with a bored look. The Aurors took hold of the men and apparated them to the interrogation room.</p>
