    <p>It was an unusually dark night for November the wind howled around the trees around Privet Drive. Today was probably one of the saddest days for the Wizarding World which was that Lily and James Potter was brutally murdered in their home in Godric Hollow. Some say it was the work of very dark wizards trying to keep a prophecy from ever coming true. However, the dark wizards had failed to kill the child of the prophecy. “Don’t worry little tike, you’ll be safe here.” Albus Dumbledore lied to the little tike he was holding in his arms and placed the boy on the step with a note on top of him.</p><p>Tom looked down at The Daily Prophet a moving picture of a burned out house and several stunned wizards looking at the wreckage.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Boy Who Lived</strong>
</p><p align="center">By: Rita Sketter</p><p>It is with great sadness I must write about the two greatest young wizards getting brutally murdered in their own home. James and Lily Potter two of Hogwarts finest were brutally murdered by dark wizards late last night, but their son, Harry James Potter, had managed to survive the attack. I have a quote from Albus Dumbledore in regards to last night’s attack. “I am deeply saddened by the murder of two students, but Harry is destined to do great things once he grows up. I am afraid that this can only be the work of one Wizard. Lord Voldemort.” Now for those of you who don’t know we don’t really know about Lord Voldemort other than the prophecy about Harry Potter. Dumbledore suspects that Lord Voldemort is a Blood Supremacist intent on killing all Muggle-Born Witches and Wizards which could spell trouble for our kind if there is a Blood Supremacist on the loose with his own agenda. No one really knows how the Young Harry Potter fits into this puzzle but you can guarantee that I will uncover his role in this.</p><p>Severus looked up from his potion book to watch a newspaper catch fire. “Is something wrong?” He questioned his new husband they had only been married for a couple months but with each passing day they fell more and more in love.</p><p>“Dumbledore is being an idiot and trying to pin the murder of that Potter Kid on Dark Wizards, specifically those who still have some of the older values of keeping a line ‘pure.’ “It seems like he is trying to cause trouble between the dark and light wizards.” Tom was infuriated at thought sure he believed in the older values, but the way the article read it seemed like someone wanted a war and that the little baby would play a huge role in it. “Sev with you being Slughorn’s apprentice now is the time to keep an eye on that senile old goat.” Tom glared at the newspaper now smoldering wondering what the old coot had up his sleeve regarding the baby whose parents had just died.</p><p>“I could also be keeping my eyes on Slughorn, I already know more than he does. Need I remind you that I was the best in potions and never once got invited to one of his stupid clubs!” Severus said angrily knowing that he would be a much better professor than Slughorn.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Two years Later</strong>
</p><p>Severus walked to Dumbledore’s office he was on his first year as the Potion’s Professor at Hogwarts and the students absolutely were loving having him as a professor, since he actually knew what he was talking about, unlike Slughorn. He made his way up the stairs and sat in one of the seats waiting for Dumbledore to arrive when an owl flew into the window. Strange he thought grabbing the letter seeing it was from the Dursley’s to those on Dumbledore’s staff knew that was where Harry Potter was. He blanched at the thought of a wizard, actually born to powerful wizards being raised by Muggles. He looked at the Phoenix. “How long do I have before he’s here?” He wondered wanting to know what the letter contained.</p><p>“About ten minutes, I can tell Peeves to create a distraction.” Fawkes said to the Potion Master, everyone thought the Phoenix was loyal to Dumbledore but it was anything but the truth the Phoenix was loyal to Hogwarts and Hogwarts alone. Fawkes had a bad feeling about his current master ever since James and Lily were murdered. He had also seen his current master having frequent meetings with the Weasley parents and writing frequent notes to the people who sent the letter Snape was holding. Fawkes had always liked the potion’s master to the point where he had given Snape a couple of feathers and his tears for potions something he never did for Slughorn. He wouldn’t let Dumbledore next to him for he didn’t trust the wizard even though the old wizard tried. If anything Fawkes was loyal to Minerva, Flitwick, and Severus over Dumbledore.</p><p>Snape tore open the letter feeling his blood slowly run cold and a huge lump appear in his chest.</p><p>
  <em>Dumbledore, Harry has changed beautifully and is now taking the abuse better than usual. He no longer is putting up a fight when it comes to his nightly abuse and we have been starving him like you asked. Vernon enjoys the poor boy, even our own son, Dudley, has started to join his father on the torture. We need some more bone regrowth I’m afraid Dudley hasn’t quite grasped the fact that he is so much bigger than the boy. Please send it soon, since Harry has several broken bones at the moment. He is in a coma and according to rules we are to keep the boy safe and that we can torture him all we want we just can’t kill him. He also has no idea that he is a Pure-Blood, and that he isn’t related to us. </em>
</p><p>Severus looked murderous at the thought that Dumbledore had told the Muggles to abuse the poor boy. He also didn’t like the fact that the boy was in a coma. He sat the letter down on the desk and waved his wand over it transferring every last word to a nearby piece of parchment. He would be showing Tom and keeping it in his records. He had never liked Dumbledore ever since he became Headmaster it seemed like he had his own agenda and Hogwarts had been changing and not for the better. He felt sick that a supposed ‘light wizard’ was allowing this to happen to a child. He shut the original letter and made it look like he hadn’t been near it. He grabbed his copy and folded it and placed it in his robes and pulled out a potion textbook making him look like he had just gotten there for the meeting. He had an inkling about what the meeting was about. Dumbledore didn’t like Severus and it was obvious that he preferred Slughorn.</p><p>“Severus my boy. Care for a lemon drop?” Dumbledore greeted sitting behind his desk seeing the letter which he grabbed and placed it in the front drawer of his desk. “From the Ministry.” He said not wanting Snape to be curious, as a curious Snape wasn’t good for him or his master plan. “The reason for this meeting is that Ministry is worried about your teaching style with you taking over for Professor Slughorn this year there has been complaints to the Ministry over how you teach.</p><p>“Excuse me.” He exclaimed he was eons above his old potion’s professor who had managed to kill a student. “Need I remind you that Professor Slughorn killed a student on his last year of being a Hogwarts’s Professor, let alone was a bloody imbecile. He was more concerned about collecting students who were powerful than he actually cared about making sure students knew how to properly brew. I’ll take the Ministry’s advice into consideration now if you don’t mind it’s the weekend and I would really like to go home to my husband and our son.” Severus said getting out of the chair ignoring the rude look Dumbles was giving him at the mention that Severus had a husband. He walked out of the office and apparated to his Manor with Tom. “We have a problem, get Lucius and Narcissa. It’s time we had our own son.” He said handing Tom the letter along with a vial of his memories for the pensive. Severus knew what he wanted to do was dangerous and if Dumbledore ever found out it would be certain death since they were technically kidnapping and blood adopting Dumbles golden boy.</p><p>Tom read the letter and dumped the memories into the pensive sticking his head in watching at just what his husband had discovered. “So Dumbles approves of child abuse? Well I certainly don’t approve, it’s time we do have our own heir, from this night on Harry Potter is dead.” He grinned evilly wrapping his arms around his husband. “So Dumbles probably killed Lily and Potter for his own reasons and blamed something else.” He teased pulling the Potions Master in for a steaming kiss. “Let’s go to Lucius and Narcissa’s Manor. Judging from the letter we are going to need their help, and this way little Draconius will have someone to grow up with and those two will be unstoppable and powerful once they get to Hogwarts. If Dumbles wants a war, he’ll get a war, a war against himself. Calling himself a ‘light wizard’ Merlin ought to be rolling over in his grave at the thought. Oh Harry will have a great life thanks to us, and Dumbles will get the kiss.” Tom said making a plan.</p><p>“So what should we rename Harry Potter, we will also need to oblivate his memories.” He didn’t want his son to know of the truth if Dumblefuck wanted a war there would certainly be a war. He’s probably thought with all the abuse I suffered I’d turn out be like Grildenwald and I’d become the third Dark Lord. Remember Slughorn tried to get me to create Horcruxes, I’d be willing to bet that Dumbles will try to make me out to be the dark wizard he mentioned in the Prophet two years ago. He’s hoping all the abuse Harry suffers will make it look like Dumbles was his savior.” Tom spat after everything Dumbles did to him and Severus it was a wonder he didn’t turn completely dark with an intent to destroy. He figured his relationship with Severus had kept him sane and his rage at a minimum.</p><p>Severus smiled around his husband’s lips. “Merlin and Morgana are probably both annoyed at what has become of our World. How much you want to bet that’s it Dumbles who want to rid our World of Muggle-Born’s. “Want to follow the Malfoy’s with going with a constellation, go for a family name, do something original. I’m really curious about our linage though and specifically The Potter linage.” He said honestly wondering if Dumbles had possibly hidden things from them like he was doing with Harry. Severus had always been curious as to why Dumble had so many seats on the Wizengamot, since Dumbledore wasn’t technically a Lord nor did he have any Lordships other than Dumbledore. Which wasn’t even close to being a member of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.</p><p>“Perseus?” Tom suggested liking the idea of naming him after a constellation like what Lucius and Narcissa did with Draco. “Scorpius, Orion?” He said mulling over the names of constellations. “I don’t know about our family linage. If we blood adopt him technically he’ll be a Gaunt on my side, it was once a very powerful family, but due to inbreeding wanting to keep the name completely pure and only procreating with other pure-bloods left very little choice. Personally given how dark the Gaunt’s were and how unstable I wouldn’t mind seeing my family line die out.” Tom knew of several sacred families that he wished would die out, specifically the Weasley’s they might have been pure-blood, but they certainly didn’t show it.</p><p>“Oh we will be blood adopting I want the Potter line to die tonight.” Severus announced thinking about the three constellation names. “I think we’ll save Scorpius and Orion, since I’m pretty sure those are Malfoy legacy names. I could see if Cissa and Lucius using either of those names if they have another son. I think one of the Weasel’s might have a son named Percy. Let’s think about it maybe they’ll be a family name of ours that dates back a while and would probably scare the bloody hell out of Dumbles.</p><p>Tom smirked at his evil husband. “I wouldn’t mind watching the Potter line to die tonight, it would make for a great Pensive memory. James was horrible to both him and Severus growing up. “Demetrius? I’d rather not have my son and a Weasley sharing a name.” He said honestly he was never a fan of the Weasley’s growing up.</p><p>“Let’s put Demetrius on the top of the list, I wouldn’t want to share anything with a Weasley or a Potter for the matter.” Severus said really liking the name Demetrius it sounded powerful. “Let’s floo to Malfoy Manor and tell Lucius I’m sure there are several things that man would like to know about.” Severus said knowing exactly just how powerful the Malfoy’s are. “Dumbles called my teaching style into question tonight, that’s why I was in his office and found our first piece of incriminating evidence. I know he prefers Slughorn over me, he’s hoping he can manipulate me till the point I quit. I know the Board loves me, at least Lucius and Abraxas do. I’m sure if you really wanted to with their help you could easily become the new professor for Dark Arts.”</p><p>Tom eyes flashed red at the mention of Severus’s teaching style. There was no doubt in his mind that Severus was the best Potion’s Master to grace the halls of Hogwarts. It wasn’t his fault that they both hated Gryffindor and he knew Severus had a Slytherin and Ravenclaw bias. “I’m sure Lucius, being on the Board of Directors, would love to hear that.” He said stepping out of the fireplace being enveloped by Narcissa while Draco hugged his leg. “Well hello.” He said picking up the child ruffling the young boy’s blonde hair.</p><p>Lucius heard his fireplace roar to life as he saw Severus and a slightly pissed off Tom. “To what do I owe this pleasure?” He asked watching Draco pull on Severus’s robes. “He has you both wrapped around his little finger.”</p><p>Tom smiled at Lucius and evil gleam in his eyes tonight would be fun. “You and Narcissa might want to sit down, it’s kind of a long story and in the end justice will be served. “Lucius how does eventual Minister of Magic sound to you assuming Millicent ever retires?” Tom asked knowing it was a dream of Lucius to become Minister of Magic. He watched a smirk come across Lucius’s face. “Dumbles have been torturing children, and hiding their actual bloodlines from them. Severus managed to find a letter from Harry Potter’s ‘relatives’ in his office.” He handed Lucius the letter watching his face scrunch and his eyes turn murderous.</p><p>“I want Dumbles dead.” Lucius roared no one should do that to a child. “Wait Harry isn’t a half-blood, then that must mean Dumbles lied to Lillian about who she was which probably happened to both you and Severus. I think you might have found something very interesting, I’m sure the Goblins would love to know about this. So what are we doing about Harry?” He sneered at the fact they all hated James growing up, and he never understood why Lillian would marry someone like that. Out of everyone in Gryffindor that year they all spewed about House togetherness yet they sneered down at you if you were anything but a Gryffindor. Yet Lily always broke that rule and would always talk to the four much to James and Sirius’s disappointment.</p><p>“Lilian probably married that git under a love potion, probably Amortentia. She was acting really strange seventh year, always clinging to James and going along with what he said.” Severus said wondering what on earth he might have just figured out. “Who knows how long Dumbles has been doing this.” He looked sick glad that Dumbles avoided Slytherin at all costs preferring to stick with the other three houses minus trying to turn Tom into a Dark Lord.</p><p>Narcissa clung to Lucius’s arm as she rubbed Draco’s shoulder as they learned what had probably happened to Lily. “Oh Lilian I’m so sorry.” She cried surprised she didn’t see the signs. “So please tell me we are kidnapping Harry tonight; I’m sure Draco would love a little brother.” After the birth of Draco, she couldn’t have children since there was a curse on the Black line that a woman could only bear one child afterward the womb was rendered useless.</p><p>Tom laughed knowing just how protective Narcissa was over her family. Everyone thought she was a dainty woman, but behind those blue eyes lied a woman would not hesitate to murder if her family was in danger. “Actually Cissa, Severus and I will be blood adopting the boy. After tonight the Potter line is dead. We have to make Harry’s murder look like it was from abuse. The letter mentioned he was in a coma, it’d be very easy to make it looked like he had brain damage and slipped into a coma and just died in the middle of the night.</p><p>“I’ll go find one of Draco’s old plushies to transfigure into a severely abused child. I’ve honestly never been happier to see a traditionally pure-blood line die. Lucius smiled at his wife. “Let’s let Harry stay here, after all Cissa is a trained nurse as is Bella and it might raise some suspicion if the same night Harry Potter dies, a child shows up in St. Mungo’s with similar abuse. “Let’s go kidnap a boy.” He grabbed Draco and kissed his head. “I love you my son, we’ll back soon with a new friend.”</p><p>Draco smiled jumping up and down at the idea of a new friend. “Uncle Sev has child?” He questioned wondering if that’s what was happening.</p><p>“Yes sweetheart, I’m getting my own heir tonight.” He said kissing the child’s right cheek as Tom went for the left. “I’m sure you’ll love him.” Severus watched as Narcissa kiss him and take him up to his room hoping Draco would sleep through the night under the careful watch of Dobby and Millie.</p><p>“Let’s do this.” Narcissa said not wanting to boy to suffer another minute of torture. She was thrilled that Severus and Tom would finally be getting their own child and heir. She wished she could have another but the Black curse still haunted them. The curse went into effect shortly after Druella had all three of her daughters. She was never able to figure out why but she figured it had something to do with either Druella or Wallburga which she figured that latter of the two were correct. The four Apparated out of Malfoy Manor and on the outskirts of the subdivision the Dursley’s lived.</p><p>They arrived at Privet Drive around midnight. The first thing they noticed were the wards around the house obviously put there by Dumbles. It sickened the four just how many wards their war, yet the house was open for any muggle or Wizard to just waltz into which is exactly what Narcissa did. “Hello.” She greeted the older couple. “I’m Narcissa and I just moved into neighborhood.” She smiled brightly wanting to gain their trust before she let loose a hellfire on the older couple. She was truly a Black if you did anything to hurt a child she had no sympathy for child abusers and judging from the looks of this couple she would certainly be having her fun.</p><p>“You do realize what time it is?” Vernon had no use for the young women in front of her. “It’s midnight my child is trying to sleep.”</p><p>“Yes, leave us alone we don’t like any of our neighbors.” Petunia spat eying the way the women was dressed it was obvious the young woman came from money judging from the high heels she was wearing along with her fit and flare dress.</p><p>“Very well.” She said watching the husky animagus of her husband enter the house who went to find Harry and to probably torture the head of house. She grabbed her elegant wand a twinkle in her eye. “Where’s Harry.” She spoke very angrily she didn’t much care for child abusers as she touched the tip of her wand against Petunia’s throat.</p><p>“There isn’t a Harry that lives here, I don’t know who the hell you are but I want you out of my house.” Vernon said seeing a sudden flash of light and watching his wife get tied up by the younger witch with blonde hair. He was pissed he was getting money from the old wizard to abuse the boy and keep him safe. “I don’t see how you can be here, there are blood wards.”</p><p>Tom smirked at the fat older man. “Blood wards only work if who they are protecting finds the place home. Which means the first time you abused him made the wards dissipate. In all honesty thought the Fidelius Charm is eons better than blood wards.” He went to the bedroom to find a box under the bed full of letters and bank statements from Dumbles. “Severus look at this.” He said handing the stack over to the man.</p><p>Narcissa managed to find the little child in the cupboard under the stairs. “Merlin’s Beard!” She exclaimed as Lucius came running her way. “Oh honey.” She muttered seeing the boy still unconscious with a bottle of Skele-Gro next to his bed. He looked much younger than three and it made her heart ache. She lifted the boy carefully not knowing the full extent of damage to the boy. “Sweetheart.” She cooed to the boy wanting Dumbles head on her mantle after this.</p><p>Lucius uncapped the Skele-Gro and sniffed having a feeling that it wasn’t what it was. “That’s not Skele-Gro, it’s a very strong loyalty potion.” He growled at the thought knowing exactly what it’s intent was and it wasn’t doing a damn thing to help the boy or his injuries.</p><p>Narcissa watched Severus hand the letters to Lucius who showed Severus the bottled of fake Skele-Gro. “It’s bad.” She muttered tears pooling in her eyes. He had several broken bones, a concussion, both of his lungs were punctured, and he was severally malnourished and emaciated. “Severus he’s going to need actual skele-gro, a blood-replenishing potion, calming potion, and more than likely a dreamless sleep once we get back to the Manor but first Gringotts we don’t want Dumbles getting away with murder.” </p><p>“Merlin.” Severus said as Narcissa told him just how bad the damage was he watched as Tom and Lucius tie up the family, which would have very entertaining if not for the sick boy in his lap. He poured a couple blood-replenishing potion’s down the boy’s throat along with pain potions and skele-gro.</p><p>“You will tell me what you have done to the boy.” Tom yelled at the Muggles. “Or I will kill you both.” He said cruelly looking over at Severus who cradled their boy gently.</p><p>Lucius was in the shoe closet making the plush teddy bear look exactly like Harry along with all of the injuries his wife had told him. He also put a brain hemorrhage in there for good measure. To anyone but the four Potter had died of severe child abuse and a brain bleed. He couldn’t believe someone could do this to a child let alone the Headmaster of a school dedicated to teaching young Witches and Wizards. Dumbledore was officially number one on hit list, followed promptly by Fudge. “Tell us what you have done, otherwise I will use Crucio and it won’t be fun.” He said evilly watching Severus and his wife tend to the young child who had a long rode of recovery ahead of him.</p><p>“What’s Crucio?” Dudley asked suddenly very scared at the four wizards in his house not agreeing with what his parents were doing to the other child that lived with them.</p><p>“A torture curse.” Narcissa spoke from her place on the couch mending the punctured lungs with her wand. “Not pleasant, I’ve only had to do it on a spider, I would personally love to do it on child abusers. Lucius they aren’t worth going to Azkaban, do the oblivate and let’s get out of here my clothes smell like muggle.” She sneered at Petunia. “You are a pathetic excuse for a mother.” She cast oblivate and smirked knowing just who would be at fault with the dead body under the stairs. “I hope you rot.”</p><p>Tom smoothed back his child’s hair. “Don’t worry little heir your safe now. Severus and I won’t let anything hurt you.” He cooed watching the child’s eyes open. “Well aren’t you a cute little thing.”</p><p>Harry whined squirming in Severus’s arms. “Who you?” He cried as Severus pulled him closer to his chest pouring another potion down his throat.</p><p>“Hello sweetheart.” Severus kissed his forehead. “We are your rightful parents, let’s get you out of here and get you feeling better.” He tucked Harry into his robes after everything was done. “Now let’s get to Gringotts before Dummy.” He laughed at his own joke and watched the child smile at him. The four of them Apparating to Diagon Alley it was dark in most of the stores, but they knew Gringotts was still open. “Welcome to the Wizarding World.” He whispered putting back his robes as the two-year-old strained his head to look around unsure of his surroundings, he knew to trust the people, but that was about it.</p><p>They walked into Gringotts as a couple of goblin’s looked up in surprise. “Hello Lady and Lord Malfoy.” Ragnok their account manager greeted. “What can I do for you?”</p><p>“Severus, Tom, and their child would like an inheritance test. We have reason to believe their might have been theft from their faults.” Lucius whispered to the goblin who looked furious.</p><p>“My office.” He said a gruff tone in his voice, not at them but from whoever was taking from the goblins. “Severus and Tom Riddle, I was expecting to see you a long time ago, you’re both from a long line of wizards and have a lot to inherit. I know Ironclaw has been trying to contact you guys for a long time in regards to your faults.” He rambled on grabbing the parchment and a bowl. “Who is this?” He asked in regards to the baby, he knew it wasn’t Draco since the Malfoy line was only the Malfoy line and when Lucius past on Draco would be inheriting the Malfoy line and the huge trust fund that came with it.</p><p>“Harry Potter, we would also like to blood adopt him. Dumbledore has been hiding a lot.” Severus saw Ragnok growl at the thought of the old wizard as Harry winced at the goblin.</p><p>“I’ve long suspected him since there have been several lines suddenly become active, without of even meeting the witch or wizard. There is a rule according to the Ministry and Goblins that all muggle-born children should come to us to get an inheritance test, which he knew wasn’t being followed. Several Wizengamot seats have been claimed by that idiot as have several heirlooms.” Ragnok smiled at the tike. “I’m sorry for growling and scaring you.”</p><p>Severus had a feeling that was what had happened. “I know on my mom’s side was a very strong pure-blood family, along with Tom’s. I’m more curious about Harry.” He told the goblin scared of what might be unearthed tonight. “Sweetheart the goblin needs blood.” He cooed sticking the child’s finger and squeezing out five drops onto the magical parchment.</p><p>

He also wondered why his mother being a Burke, was sorted into Gryffindor, since Burke considered a traditional Slytherin house.</p><p>“Ragnok how many seats does that equal on the Wizengamot?” Lucius asked handing the parchment to Narcissa.</p><p>“It’s the reason Dumbledore is Chief Warlock, however since he isn’t of age the seats fall to the parents and they can proxy them to whoever they would like. All together I’d say he holds about 50 seats.”</p><p>“Nobody’s claimed the Lordship of Gaunt, like most of them on the list they are considered a dead house, but as most of you know a lot of the sacred houses are all related due to their being very few pure-bloods. I do know most if not all of those seats are currently active on the Wizengamot along with frequent withdraws from the vaults, but the Lordships have remained inactive. “Now you two mentioned you wanted an inheritance test also?” He said looking at Severus and Tom who looked terrified of the child.</p><p>“Yes please.” Tom said holding out his finger for the goblin to stick.

I think Adrian and I were cousins.” He said knowing there had to be glamour’s on the child, to make him more like a Potter. “Can we also purge Severus and Harry?” He asked the goblin figuring they were both under spells and potions curtsey of Dumbasadoor.</p><p>“Sure, I’ll have Griphook prep the purging room. I’d recommend everyone get a magical purge. I’d also recommend once you blood adopt him you create blood wards once Dumbles realizes his seats are gone he is going to be curious as to why. I can tell you that he doesn’t know all the magical families Harry is related to, but he knows know the kid has a lot of seats, but once Harry dies.” Ragnok made air quotes around dies. “He will have no control over the vaults and they will go to the next available heir. After the blood adoption you both can claim any lordships he has, and pass them down once his older, since there are twenty my recommendation is that you both take ten. Since Tom is also heir to some of those houses obviously they fall to him unless Severus shares them.” He said to the four. “Now let’s see what Severus has been hiding.” He said pricking the potions master’s finger.</p><p>Severus Tobias Snape</p><p>Father:  Silenus Rookwood (deceased)</p><p>Mother: Eileen Snape nee Prince (deceased)</p><p>Blood Adopted Father: Tobias Snape (deceased)</p><p><strong>Heir</strong>:</p><p>Rookwood</p><p>Prince</p><p>Snape</p><p>Wroxton</p><p>Runcorn</p><p>Mordaunt</p><p><strong>Magical Ability</strong>:</p><p>Animagus: black rabbit (registered)</p><p>Severus looked at the piece of paper looking faint he was related to an unmentionable. “Wait every last one of our families is dead.” He said finding it hard to be just a coincidence. “We are all pure-bloods. I was told I was a half-blood!” He exclaimed feeling suddenly sick he had been lied to and deceived. It was when Ragnok handed Severus the long list of vaults the three of them had. “Merlin!”</p><p>Ragnok smiled and grabbed the blood adoption papers. “So do you still want to adopt the boy?”</p><p>“Yes.” Severus and Tom said in unison, the boy was far too powerful to fall into Dumbles hands.</p><p>“Alright I will need more blood.” He said as they all sliced their palms and placed them on the parchment followed by Severus and Tom dripping their blood into opened palm of the child. “So what’s going to be the name?”</p><p>“If we went with your father’s name it would certainly put Dumbles underwear in a twist.” Tom suggested looking at Severus. “Silenus would certainly surprise Dumbledore since for all he knows you still believe you are a Snape.</p><p>Severus shook his head while he liked the name it wasn’t right. “I like Demetrius or Xavier we could use Silenus or Corvinus as a middle name. “Demetrius Silenus Peverell-Snape or Xavier Corvinus Gaunt-Prince?”</p><p>“I like the first one but instead Demetrius Silenus Gaunt-Snape.” Tom suggested he decided after learning he was a pure-blood he didn’t want the Gaunt line to die out, and he knew Dumbles might have a heart attack if the Gaunt line was resurrected since it was known for dark wizards and was the directed descendent from Slytherin meaning that if he had more children with Severus they would be directed lines of Slytherin and would have the ability of Parsel.</p><p>“I thought you wanted Gaunt and Potter lines to die?” Severus said mulling the name over in his head. “I like it. Hello little Demetri.” He cooed watching the baby.</p><p>“Might as well scare Dumbles with the idea of another Gaunt. I might even have to tell Demetri about Helga down in the Chamber of Secrets.” Tom grinned evilly watching the baby suddenly change to look exactly like them. His hair changed from a dirty brown to Severus’s jet black hair, he got Tom’s signature ice blue eyes, and turned slightly pail to match Severus’s completion. Overall the child looked more like Severus with little bits of Tom mixed in.</p><p>Ragnok smiled at the two fathers fawning over Demetri. “I’d suggest we burn the blood adoption papers from this night forward Harry Potter is dead, and Demetrius Gaunt was born August 5<sup>th</sup> 1980, so since males can get pregnant who carried it?” He asked filling out the birth certificate.</p><p>“He looks the most like Severus.” Tom suggested looking at Demetri. “Oh Dumbles might just have a heart attack the moment his name is called for the sorting hat. “Our little Slytherin.”</p><p>“Fine I carried him.” Severus huffed angrily signing his name in delicate cursive under the technical mom slot as he watched Tom sign on the father line. He watched as Ragnok burned the blood adoption papers so that it would never be traced back to Harry Potter. He handed the young couple copies of all the inheritance tests and the birth certificate of one Demetrius Silenus Gaunt-Snape. “Follow Griphook for the purge which should also heal Demetri of all his injuries.” He said watching the four file out of his office with Narcissa now holding the baby. “Have a lovely night, I look forward to seeing what the little tike will do.”</p><p>“We are parents.” Severus whispered to Tom everything suddenly seeming real and not just a plan. He watched Narcissa cuddle her son. “You will be the Godparents.” He said to the two blondes next to him knowing it was exactly what Tom wanted. They sat in the purge room watching as Demetri’s magic go all over the place. His magic creating a tsunami inside the room as the four of them looked stunned they knew he was an elemental it was surprising to see a two-year-old conjure a perfect tsunami.</p><p>The four exited the purge room holding a very knocked out Demetri looking like a very  normal two-year-old. “Narcissa he seems normal; do you still see anything wrong?” Tom asked watching the blonde wave her wand over the sleeping toddler as they walked out of the bank into the cool November air.</p><p>“He seems normal, maybe the magical tsunami had something to do with everything healing.” She said leaning against her husband since this night had taken a lot out of her magic wise.</p><p>The apperation to Malfoy Manor was almost painful after the magical purge. “Your welcome to put Demetrius in with Draco, I’m sure they’ll both sleep through the night.” Lucius said wrapping his arm around her waist not wanting her to fall.</p>
