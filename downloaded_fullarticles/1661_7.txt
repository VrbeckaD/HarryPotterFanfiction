          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Hey, dad?” Scorpius said, timidly playing with the cuffs of his jumper and swaying on his feet. His dad was sat in the kitchen, head in The Daily Prophet as he muttered something about it being bullshit.</p><p>“Yes, Scorpius?” He answered, not even looking up.</p><p>“Would it be okay if-” he cut himself off, stepping a few steps closer to his dad and trying again. “You know that it’s-” again, he cut himself off. He cursed himself for being so stupid. It was a simple question, why couldn’t he just ask? He’d come out to him before now, surely asking to go see his boyfriend in the summer holidays wasn’t asking for that much?</p><p>“Spit it out, Scorpius,” he said, not unkind.</p><p>“It’s Albus’ birthday tomorrow and he’s having a party at the Burrow and I was just wondering if I could go because I haven’t seen him in a week and I miss him, and I’d really like to see him for his birthday and he asked me to go so… can I?”</p><p>Draco finally looked up at him. He pulled his glasses off the end of his nose and studied Scorpius for a short moment. He huffed, pouting slightly before pulling the paper back up to his nose.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Scorpius spluttered, “no?” He was sure his dad would say yes. It’s not like he wouldn’t be safe – he’ll be with a thousand other Weasleys and a bunch of adults he was sure would be responsible enough. And he’s sixteen! He’ll be seventeen that December, surely that meant some leeway in what he was and wasn’t allowed to do.</p><p>“I said what I said, Scorpius. You’re not going.”</p><p>“Why not?” He pushed, stepping forward. Usually, he knew better than to argue with his dad, but this time he didn’t see the problem with an afternoon away from the Manor.</p><p>“I don’t want you to, the Burrow is too far away, and you’ve seen Albus every day at school, you can survive the summer without him.”</p><p>Normally, Scorpius would take it on the chin. Except the answer for what it was. But, normally, the answer was never no. His parents gave him everything, wanted to make sure he was the happiest he could be. But, he was always miserable in this house. Especially since his mum died. He wanted to get out, to be free for just a day. Scorpius took a deep breath and prepared to do something he’d never done before: beg.</p><p>“Please, dad? It’ll just be for the day and you can take me and pick me up to make sure I get there safe and-”</p><p>“What part of ‘no’ do you not understand?” His dad boomed, throwing the paper on the table loudly. Scorpius flinched, stepping back slightly. Memories of his dad in the other world coming back to him.</p><p><em>He won’t hurt you, Scorpius. He won’t,</em> he tried to convince himself. It must have worked a little because he took a deep breath and went back in for the fight.</p><p>“You never let me do anything! You may be happy being cooped away in here, but it drives me crazy, dad!”</p><p>“You know everything I do is for the best for <em>you</em>, Scorpius. Don’t start being ungrateful now.”</p><p>“Ungrateful?” Scorpius raised his voice slightly, but it was nothing that matched Draco’s. “And how do you suppose this is for the best? How do you suppose being lonely is for the best?”</p><p>“If protecting you means you have to be lonely, then that’s what I shall do,” Draco boomed, rising from his chair. Scorpius took another step back and hung his head.</p><p>“I can look after myself,” he muttered. He looked back up defiantly, the next words spilling from his mouth before he could catch them. “It’s not like you did much protecting after mum died, where were you then, huh?” He spat, accusingly. It was a low blow and he regretted the words almost instantly. His heart pounded in his chest, nausea of guilt bubbling in his stomach and his throat.</p><p>Then, something snapped in his dad. His cold eyes burned with a fire. He slammed his fist onto the table, the loud bang echoing throughout the empty kitchen and Scorpius’ ears. And, then, with a cool intensity that leaked anger, he said, “Do not use your mother against me. You do not get to score points that way!”</p><p>And then Scorpius couldn’t breathe. In those cool eyes full of ire, there was only one person he saw. Not Draco Malfoy, his loving dad who would protect him and go to the ends of the Earth for him. But Draco Malfoy, Death-Eater, Head of Magical Law Enforcement, working under Delphi’s orders, killing muggles and muggle-borns.</p><p>The dad who pulled his head down onto a table with an unforgiveable force. Who caused bruises along his neck and jaw. He sometimes still woke with a pain from being pulled at a dodgy angle and forced down.</p><p>That wasn’t the same man who was standing in front of him, yet he looked so much like him and Scorpius couldn’t breathe. He tried, he tried, he tried. But he couldn’t catch his breath and it was like he was drowning, begging for air but his dad was keeping him underwater. Forcing his head down.</p><p>He dropped to the floor, no longer hearing any words accept those same ones over and over. Those same ones his dad – <em>no,</em> not his dad – said to him in the dark universe. The same words now spoken to him by <em>his</em> dad. His real dad.</p><p>
  <em>You do not get to score points that way.</em>
</p><p>And the banging of his fist on the table sounded too much like the banging of Scorpius’ head on the desk. It was those words being repeated over and over and over. Wrapping around his lungs and cutting off his breathing supply. He clawed at his throat, desperate for air but nothing came. The dam blocking the air from him was built ten feet tall and there was no destroying it.</p><p>There was a hand on him, and Scorpius saw the rings. The rings he knew as his fathers. And he scurried away, and he thought he was saying words, but he wasn’t sure what they were. He couldn’t hear anything over his beating heart, his rapid breathing and those damn words being said over and over and over.</p><p>
  <em>Breathe, Scorpius.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Breathe.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s not the man you think it is.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He’s your dad.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Breathe.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He’s your dad.</em>
</p><p>But he couldn’t. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t focus. Another hand on his back and Scorpius screamed at him to go away, scurrying into the corner of the room and burying his head in his knees. The lack of oxygen to his lungs was making him go lightheaded, and it was only a few minutes later when he blacked out for good.</p><p> </p><p align="center">#</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Scorpius woke to the bright lights of the St Mungos hospital room with a mask over his mouth, feeding him oxygen. There was a hand in his, and despite everything, he sincerely hoped it was his dads. He pulled the mask from his face, sitting up slightly and locking eyes with a bright green pair. Not his dad, but definitely the next best thing.</p><p>“Hey,” Albus said, a small yet hopeful smile on his lips.</p><p>“Where’s my dad?” Scorpius asked, searching around the room. He wasn’t on his own, there were others in the beds around him, most still asleep. His voice sounded raw, like he hadn’t had a drink of water for weeks. Albus noticed this and picked up the glass by his bedside table to hand to him. Scorpius took a grateful sip.</p><p>“He just popped out for some air,” Albus assured, squeezing his hand.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“You had a panic attack, a bad one. Your dad said he couldn’t calm you down, that every time he went near you, you ran away again. When you passed out he brought you straight here, then called me.” Scorpius hung his head, the argument coming back to him. The words that triggered his attack. He hadn’t had a panic attack that badly for months, not since his nightmares were finally starting to calm down. It had been nearly two years since the whole time-turning debacle. Scorpius thought he was finally getting over it.</p><p>Clearly, he thought wrong.</p><p>“I need to apologise to him,” Scorpius said, voice cracking. He was far too harsh, bringing his mum into it like that. His dad was right: he didn’t get to score points that way.</p><p>“Just relax for a moment, yeah? Your heart rate is already increasing just thinking about it,” Albus said, stroking his thumb across Scorpius’ knuckles.</p><p>Scorpius couldn’t help the sob that overcome him, tears streaming uncontrollably down his cheeks. “He’s going to hate me, Albus,” he managed. He wiped his tears with his arm.</p><p>Albus stood, wrapping him in a hug. “Your dad loves you more than anything in this entire world, Scorpius. A little argument isn’t going to change that.” Scorpius nodded against him, unable to say any words. They stayed like that until Draco crept back into the room, holding a coffee for both he and Albus.</p><p>“Scorpius? You’re up,” he spoke, a little hesitantly. Scorpius pulled away from Albus, nodding slightly at his dad. “Are you – are you okay?”</p><p>Albus patted his shoulder, leaning down to kiss him on the cheek. “I’ll be just outside,” he assured. He nodded to Draco, who gave Albus a thankful smile and handed him his coffee before walking out the room. Scorpius watched him until he was completely gone, then pulled his knees to his chest and looked at his dad.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” they said at the same time, then both smiled slightly.</p><p>“I am sorry, dad. I shouldn’t have said those things about – about mum,” he swallowed the lump in his throat.</p><p>“No, you were right. I didn’t protect you after she was gone. I should have done better by you, son. It’s just, she always knew what to do, you know? And suddenly she was gone, and I was left with a child who could barely look me in the eye, who was grieving twice as hard as me. You loved her so fiercely. I know I could have tried harder.”</p><p>Scorpius reached over to grab his hand, “you tried your best. I’ve never been angry about that. You were grieving too, dad. I knew that, I understood it.”</p><p>“You always were a perceptive child.” Draco smiled sweetly at Scorpius, before wrapping his arms around him. Scorpius sank into his father’s embrace, basking in it for once. Physical affection was rare between them, so when it happened, Scorpius wanted to hold on for as long as possible.</p><p>“Albus told me,” Draco spoke quietly when he pulled away. “About what I did in that other world. I am so sorry, truly. You’re my baby boy, I would never hurt you.” And for the first time in his entire life, Draco Malfoy broke down into tears in front of his son.</p><p>When Astoria died, Draco never let his grief show in front of Scorpius. It was there, evidently, but the tears were left to fall behind closed doors in the dead of the night. Scorpius had never seen his father cry, and now here he was. And it was all Scorpius’ fault.</p><p>“I’m sorry, dad!” He said, kneeling on the bed to wrap his arms around Draco this time. It felt weird being the one giving his dad comfort rather than the other way around. “I know, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to imply you would hurt me, I know you wouldn’t. I just got scared and panicked, I’m so, so, so, sorry. I love you,” at some point, he began crying himself.</p><p>“I love you, Scorpius.”</p><p>His shoulder was soaked with his dad’s tears, and his dad’s shoulder was soaked with his. And they hugged and hugged for a long, long time. Letting themselves heal with the help of each other. Scorpius always assumed that once he grew up, he wouldn’t need his dad anymore. He was so wrong. He would always need his dad. He was his dad. He was there to protect him. Scorpius vowed to never let his stupid childish ways get in the way of his dad doing his job again.</p></div>
