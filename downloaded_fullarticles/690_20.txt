          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry squinted through his glasses. With a flick of his wand, the photo frame that Draco was holding was stuck permanently in place upon their Living Room wall. </p><p>“What d’you think?” Harry asked. “I reckon that’s hung straight.”</p><p>Draco gave a nod of agreement. “I still don’t understand why you insist of hanging up a picture of <em>that</em> particular holiday. You were as sick as a crup with food-poisoning. I got terrible sunburn-”</p><p>Harry lent over and kissed Draco’s cheek. </p><p>“Yeah? Well, I remember walking on the beach. Lazy mornings in bed. I was with <em>you</em>, Draco. I loved it.”</p></div>
