  <p>Calidara Nefzen knew she was adopted. Her parents had never hidden it from her. They were all too happy to tell her about the day they found her, all bundled in a thick black cloak, on the back step of the hospital where they both worked. After months of looking for the girl's parents, the police and Children's Services allowed Doctor and Mr. Nefzen to adopt her. So, when the tall black-haired woman showed up to inform her and her parents that she had been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, none of them were expecting it.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>In fact, they were beyond shocked that witchcraft existed. Deputy Headmistress McGonagall made them realize that she'd been using magic for years. They could point to several magical happenings where she used to think she'd just been lucky. Edward and Jemma Nefzen didn't want her to go to a school for witchcraft. They wanted her to go to a posh private school and were planning a trip to get her school uniforms.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She begged to go. She pulled her parents out of the living room and begged to go. Down on her knees, tears in her eyes, begged. She never heard of the school before the woman knocked on the door, thought magic was completely fabricated until she read the letter McGonagall handed her, and yet, something in her said she had to go to <em>that</em> school. Not the posh one with the awards for their Science and Maths scores, Hogwarts. Her parents relented when she promised that she'd come home immediately and go to the other school if Hogwarts wasn't everything advertised.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>McGonagall told her to go to Charing Cross Road, to a place called 'The Leaky Cauldron', but the rest of the conversation happened between her parents and the old Scottish witch. She was excited, though, and the next day she took all of her money saved up from her birthdays and Christmases, and walked the half an hour to Charing Cross Station. But she didn't know how to find The Leaky Cauldron. She didn't know how to find where she'd buy her supplies. She didn't see any signs that said 'Buy your witchcraft supplies here!'. What she <em>did</em> see was a gigantic man with a bushy beard and a small brown-haired boy walking up a broken escalator. The boy was pouring over a list just like the one in her back pocket.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Excuse me!" She shouted, running after them. She was breathing heavy by the time she got to the top of the escalator and stopped in front of them. "Sorry, but... do you know where I might find supplies for Hogwarts School?" She left off the rest of the name just in case they weren't looking for the same thing.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh?" The man bent down to examine her. "Yer in the same boat as Harry, then. Professor McGonagall woulda tol' yer parents, o'course, but a lot 'er Muggle-borns have trouble findin' the way to Diagon Alley. Thas where yule be gettin' yer supplies."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Muggles are non-magical people." The boy provided.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh. Okay."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, come 'long. We'll get you to Diagon Alley."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I'm Harry." The bespectacled boy offered his hand, which she took.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Callie. You know, you ought to get yourself some new trousers while you're shopping. Those are falling off."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"At least a new belt, right?" Harry joked, pulling his pants up as he followed the giant. "So, you walked here?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yeah. I only live, like, 2 miles away."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yer parents let you walk alone?" The man called over his shoulder.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, they don't exactly <em>know</em>, but..."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, it's a good thing you saw Hagrid, then." Harry said, flashing a smile.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, how could I miss him?" She laughed. "But, actually, it was <em>you</em> I noticed first. You had the supplies list. Same as mine." She pulled the neatly-folded list out of her pocket and unfolded it. "I am glad I found you, though. Would've been walking Charing Cross forever looking for someplace magical."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So, you didn't know you were a witch, then?" Harry asked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"No. Just always thought I was just really lucky." Calidara laughed. "Big shock to my parents, though. More than me, I think. I'm sure, when they adopted me, they didn't think they were bringing home a witch."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Are they happy about it, though, or-"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, Mum's a bit disappointed. Think she wanted me to be a doctor, like her, but... I mean, I could learn <em>real</em> magic! How could I pass that up?" She refolded her supply list and shoved it back into her pocket. "What about you, Harry? Did your parents flip?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I'm an orphan. My aunt and uncle didn't like it, much, though."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"The great dumb Dursleys tried to keep 'im from even gettin' his letter. To think, Harry Potter wasting away at some Muggle school."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry blushed a bit, looking down at his feet. "Apparently, my parents were a witch and a wizard, and my aunt and uncle never told me."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, at least you know now, right? Probably never know whether my parents were magic, myself."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Guess you're right. Though, I don't know much else about them. The Dursleys didn't like talking about them."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, here we are! The Leaky Cauldron." Hagrid announced, stepping to open a door to an old antiques shop. The children followed him in, and Hagrid pointed Callie to an old woman in the corner, who smiled brightly. "She'll help guide you. It's 'er job to set Muggle-borns on the right path."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Thank you!" She waved at the boy and giant man and ran to the corner, excitedly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You need help with yer supplies fer Hogwarts, dearie?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yes, ma'am!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, come on now, dearie. Let's go to Gringott's first, then." The plump woman moved gracefully out the back of the bar and stepped to a stone wall. She tapped several of the stones with her wand and Callie watched, amazed, as the wall opened up to expose a vibrant, busy street full of people in cloaks and robes, shopping in the many stores that lined the way. "So, where are yer parents, lass?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"They're at work, but I've got money. Been saving every pound since I was 5. Never knew what I was saving for, but now I do."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, maybe someone's got a touch of the precognition. So, we'll go to Gringott's, that's our bank. We'll exchange yer Muggle money fer Galleons, then we'll get you yer robes."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The woman left after getting the money exchanged, pointing her toward the robe shop and saying she'd return once she'd finished her fitting. As she was walking into the shop, a boy her age (obviously a first year, too) was walking out. Like Callie, the boy had blond hair so light that it was almost white, but his eyes were a light blue, almost grey, where hers were dark brown. The boy appraised her with disgust as he passed, and stuck his foot out, tripping her. "Ha! Stupid mudbloods don't even know how to walk."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She glared at him and the back of his stupid blond head, as she pulled herself up and brushed her knees off. She didn't have to ask what 'mudblood' meant. The way he said it, and the obvious negative reference to her blood being dirty, it <em>had</em> to be a pejorative word for Muggle-born witches.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>It must've been her style of dress or maybe the way she'd looked in awe of all things on Diagon Alley that tipped him to her status, so she wore her new cloak over her clothes and kept her enthusiasm down as she bought her books and other supplies.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Are you all right?" Harry asked, walking up to her with an armful of books.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yeah. Why?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You just- before you left The Leaky Cauldron, you looked so excited and you don't, now."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh, well, I got called a nasty name by someone who's clearly known magic and money his whole life, so... brought my enthusiasm down a bit. What about you?" She gestured to the books. "You look like you're almost done."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yeah. Just need a wand. Hagrid said-"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Ollivander's. Mrs. McGuffey said the same."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Where <em>is</em> she? Thought she was supposed to be helping you."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I think she might have a wee bit of a drinking problem. She keeps leaving me in the shops to 'pop back to The Leaky Cauldron fer a pint'."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Wow. Well, Hagrid pointed down here for Mr. Ollivander's." Harry gestured with his head.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hello, dear girl. Garrick Ollivander. You are?" The old man asked, taking her hand as she walked in and set her items down.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Calidara Nefzen, sir."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Ah. The name does not help. A new witch, Muggle-born, anything could happen. Let us try... English Oak, 9 Inches, with a unicorn hair core." That didn't work, so Ollivander moved on to a 'Pear, 11 inch, Dragon heartstring', which didn't work, either. She went through 5 more before Ollivander handed her a rigid Larch wood wand, 12 3/4 inches, with a phoenix feather core. It warmed in her hand and she smiled. "That's the one, then!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Callie loved the wand, immediately. It was long and light-colored wood and it felt like it belonged with her. She couldn't bear to put it down as she paid for it. She smiled at Harry as he stepped up to the counter for his turn. "I suppose I'll see you at school in September, then." Harry nodded, excitedly, as she walked away.</p>
