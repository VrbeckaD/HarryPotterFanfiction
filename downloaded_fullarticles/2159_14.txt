    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The wind that whipped through Diagon Alley wasn't particularly cold, but I still drew my coat tighter around me, as if shielding me from more than the slight chill. I lowered my head more, letting my dark, curly hair fall further across my face to hide the ugly bruise that had blossomed on my right cheek. I was here to do a job, and I couldn't do that while attracting attention. If I let my face show, I might as well just wear a feathered headdress, and that simply would not do.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I walked casually around the different outdoor stalls, pocketing a few things here and there. I knew they wouldn't fetch much, I would have to go for something bigger, but every little bit helped. The only question was which shop to hit up this time. I had just hit J. Pippin's Potions last time, so I didn't really want to go back there again just yet, though it did usually have the easiest pickings. Wiseacre's was hit or miss, depending on what they had in stock. You could spend a few minutes and knick enough to fetch a pretty Galleon, or spend hours in there perusing junk. I always dreaded going down Knockturn Alley; although some shops held far more valuable things than others in the main shopping district, the shop keepers were always a little more on their toes and observant. I only ventured there when I was truly desperate, though perhaps this was one of those times.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I sighed as I regarded my inner monologue. This wasn't really me, I didn't relish stealing and reselling on the black market, but my stepfather gave me no choice. It was this or loaning out my body, and I think I would rather spend a few years in Azkaban for theft.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A shaft of light emanating from a shop made me pause briefly as I looked up to see where it was coming from. I found myself standing in front of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, the famed joke shop that had once been the cornerstone of Diagon Alley during the Second Wizarding War, when most other shops went out of business. I had never ventured in there before, as I had no idea if it would hold anything of real value, but today something made me want to step in, if only for a few moments.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I was almost instantly assaulted by a flying miniature car. After the close call with my head, it headed straight for a wall of shelves before banking sharply and heading for the ceiling. I'm sure my eyes were wide as I stood there in the doorway, in awe of the fantastical energy of this place. For a moment, I even forgot the reason I was there to begin with. I was simply at one with the moment and the calm joy that slowly blossomed inside of me.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I shook my head to shake myself out of my reverie. As much as I would have loved to spend hours looking at everything – and not just to steal – I had a job to do, and my time was limited by the hours that my dealers kept. I carefully skirted the main floor, careful not to draw attention to myself as I quickly catalogued the various products and decided which ones I should pass on and which ones I should go for. There were silly products that had no real worth, like boxing telescopes and screaming yo-yo's. But things like extendable ears and patented daydream charms were interesting enough to be useful for barter. I also nabbed a love potion – only one, since I wasn't sure how strong it was, and that would determine its true worth – and also some decoy detonators and Peruvian instant darkness powder, keeping in mind the sordid types that frequented my dealers. I contemplated stuffing a box of fireworks under my jacket, but decided it would be too bulky. I had spent enough time in the shop as it was, so I let myself come full circle back to the door and ducked out.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If only I'd had the presence of mind, I would have seen a certain red-haired wizard regard my exit and I would have apparated away on the spot, content to gamble the chance of my wares getting me nothing against me getting caught. But my usual cautious self lapsed for just that moment, and that moment was all that was needed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I hurried down the street, head down, thinking of briefly hitting up J. Pippin's on my way out just for some insurance on income when a hand suddenly shot out of a side alley and locked on my wrist. I gasped and jumped, looking up to see who it was, and when I saw the familiar lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead, I knew I was done for.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Come with me.” It was all he needed to say, we both knew it. Mercifully, instead of parading me down the middle of the streets, he guided me down the back alleys to the Ministry office. For this small act of kindness, I was grateful. It was one thing to be a thief caught, it was another for society to know it. There were some criminals who relished that kind of attention, but I was not one of them. I stole only because I had no other option, so I appreciated the discretion of Harry Potter. By the time we made it to the Ministry office, my heart – which had jumped into my throat when he grabbed me – now settled like a rock in my stomach.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The room he led me into was not quite what I was expecting. What I was expecting was a drab grey or brown with stark furnishings. Instead, the walls were a soft, if a bit faded, yellow, and the beautiful carved wood table had a warm quality to it. The chair I was directed to must have belonged to a matching set with the table, as the arms, legs, and back had beautiful vine-like carvings inlaid in them. The scarlet cushion looked slightly worn, but it was still quite comfortable as I slowly lowered myself into it. There were no windows, of course, and I suspected that I wouldn't be able to apparate out of the room if I tried, which I didn't. I knew when it was over, and it was most certainly over.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Despite that knowledge, my heart still pounded in my chest as Potter locked the door and slowly trekked back to the table, eschewing the other chair and choosing to settle on a stool in front of me.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You might be wondering why an Auror such as myself is bothering with a case of petty crime,” he began. I admit, I was slightly curious, as there were many Magical Law Enforcement officers that could have been dispatched to pick me up. “Fact of the matter is,” he continued, “That shop you just stole from happens to be owned by very good friends of mine.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2"><em>Good thing or bad thing?</em> </span>
  <span class="s1">I immediately asked myself, as I always did when new situations presented themselves. My heart sank for a moment before I realized that this was potentially a very good thing. If I had stolen from good friends of his, he would be more inclined to come down hard on me. Maximum sentence was five years … surely my stepfather could self-destruct in that time and leave me free to be once I got out.</span>
  <span class="s2"> <em>Free.</em> </span>
  <span class="s1">What did that even mean anymore?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Show me.” That simple command, soft as it was, held a hard edge of authority behind it, and I immediately emptied my pockets of everything, including the few things I had picked up before I entered Weasley's. After all, if I was going to be sent to Azkaban, I would be searched anyway, so no use in trying to hide anything now. He silently regarded the items I had set on the table before he fixed me with a question. “Why?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I bit my lip and lowered my head. Even if I could speak, I could never tell him what was really going on. That my stepfather forced me to steal to support his illicit habits, that he had no hesitation in beating me if I didn't do exactly as he said, that I was in an inescapable cycle with no way out, no hope. Even if I could speak … which I wasn't even sure I could do anymore. My stepfather had long beat the voice out of me. I hadn't said one word in years; I didn't know if I even could anymore, I hadn't even tried in so long. I felt anxiety every time I thought about it. Would anything come out at all? But it was a worry I pushed away, as there were always more pressing matters at hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter kept talking, but at this point, I blocked him out. Even if I could spill my soul, would he even care? Likely not, no one ever did, so why should anyone start caring now? I just burrowed inward and let him ramble. I had learned long ago that people were going to do what they wanted anyway; I accepted this and gave up without protest, focusing on the pattern in the wood table and blocking out everything else so that the feel of the seat cushion, the rough quality of my coat, and even Potter's voice seemed distant and fuzzy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Suddenly, Potter slammed his hands on the table right in front of me, jerking me out of my haze and making my head snap up. For a brief moment, my hair fell completely to the side, revealing my whole face, including the bruise over my cheekbone. I could tell from the look on his face that the sight had startled him and I quickly looked down again, letting my hair fall over my face, not even pausing long enough to see how he would react. I squeezed my eyes shut, my heart suddenly pounding hard in my chest, making it ache so bad I wanted to rip my ribs apart just for the relief. I don't know why I was suddenly so anxious, but in that moment I truly wanted to melt into the floor. What came next was completely unexpected.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I instinctively flinched hard when I felt a warm hand on my chin and my eyes popped open to see that he stood in front of me, leaning down so we were on eye level. He withdrew his hand when I flinched, but after that initial shock, he reached out again, this time simply moving my hair to the side to reveal the right side of my face.</span>
  <span class="s2"> <em>What are you doing? Just throw me in Azkaban, already!</em> </span>
  <span class="s1">But Potter was a Wizard, not a telepath, and so my silent wish went unregarded.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Who did this?” This question completely threw me for a loop. This wasn't relevant to my case of theft, so why did he care? No one had ever cared before. My eyes darted around the room, not sure what to do. Never before had I been so completely out of my element.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He seemed to regard my silence as an answer of sorts. He wordlessly dropped his hand and walked out of the room, shutting the door behind him. I could hear the locking mechanism click and my heart clenched in my chest.</span>
  <span class="s2"> <em>Good thing or bad thing?</em> </span>
  <span class="s1">I asked myself again, but this time I had no readily available answer, and that scared me more than anything.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Since there were no windows in that room, and no clock, it was impossible to judge time. I couldn't be sure how long I sat in there on pins and needles. It could have been hours, or it could have simply been a few minutes. My stomach did a somersault when I heard the lock click again, and this time Potter entered the room with another man.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The older gentleman had longer hair and distinguished, though greying, facial hair. There was a softness about his presence, though, as if every movement he made was deliberate and gentle all at the same time. I focused on the floor again as he approached me. Unlike Potter, he knelt in front of me and set a hand on my knee, though I instantly flinched again, unable to stop the reflex. He also withdrew his hand and, like Potter, simply reached up to move aside my hair. My eyes shot up just for a second, but I found my gaze lingered on him. His face was kind, and it stopped any further actions of mine. I hadn't seen such a kind face directed at me in years, not since my mother passed, and I eagerly drank it in.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After a few moments, though, the intensity of his gaze was too much and I had to look away. I heard the rustle of parchment and looked up to see that he set a blank piece down on the table in front of me, along with a self-inking quill. When he spoke, his voice was just as gentle as he seemed to be. “Will you tell us who did this to you?” he asked, motioning toward the parchment and quill. Even though I could have very well given up my stepfather this way, my eyes widened at the thought, and I clenched the seat with my hands. The man paused a moment before he asked, “Will you at least tell us your name?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This question shocked me slightly. He wanted to know my name? While I would never give out my last name – Winter was known to be a respected, pure blood name – I eventually decided that my first name would be harmless. My hand shakily reached out and grasped the quill. With a deep breathe, and with every nerve I could muster, I carefully traced out the letters.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Rue</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I pushed the parchment back towards him and he picked it up to see what I'd written. “Rue?” he asked in verification, and I nodded. “My name is Sirius Black. Do you have a last name, Rue?” I firmly shook my head, solidifying my earlier decision not to reveal my last name, especially to another pure blood. He nodded and then stood up, turning and walking out the door, Potter following behind him wordlessly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I felt like my anxiety was going to swallow me whole. I was now completely at a loss, adrift on a sea of uncertainty without even a friendly breeze to guide my sail. My hands shook as I clenched them in my lap, worry gnawing in the pit of my stomach. I felt nauseous and I longed for some fresh air just to keep the queasiness at bay.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Finally, after what seemed like forever again, Potter and Sirius Black entered the room again. This time, Potter spoke. “You're free to go.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This now sent me into a tailspin of confusion. He was just letting me go? A thief, caught in the act, stealing from his friends? I didn't know what to do, but they physically ushered me out of the room and the office itself and back into the street. I stood there for a moment, unsure of everything now. I looked back briefly to regard them standing in the doorway before I apparated away.</span>
