    <p>There’s a scream building in Draco’s throat. The only reason he doesn’t let it loose when Neville comes back with the wrong colour throw cushions, for the third time in a row, is because of the nervous expression on Neville’s face. A lifetime ago, the nervousness would have annoyed him, but instead of throwing a stinging hex, or sneering, like thirteen-year-old Draco would have done, he purses his lips together in a fruitless attempt to hide his displeasure. </p>
<p>“They’re the wrong ones, aren’t they?” Neville says, crestfallen. </p>
<p>Harry pokes his head around the corner and then saunters up the aisle. “They look white to me.”</p>
<p>“Cream,” Draco snaps. “They were supposed to be <em>cream</em>, not white, not off-white, not bloody <em>blue</em>, like you brought me last time. We’re supposed to have a theme in our living room, so that people don’t actually think we live like Hippogriffs.”</p>
<p>Harry rolls his eyes, kissing away Neville’s dejected expression. Draco’s mouth goes a little dry at the sight of them, kissing gently in the middle of the aisle in IKEA. Harry cradles the soft line of Neville’s jaw with one dark hand, and Draco clears his throat loudly as someone rushes past the other end of the aisle. Both of them part, slightly dazed. </p>
<p>“Not that I wasn’t enjoying that, but I don’t think this is really the place for that sort of thing,” Draco says drily.</p>
<p>“This coming from the man who <em>groped</em> me at the last Ministry party in full view of everyone, including the Minister for Magic,” Harry says, rolling his eyes. </p>
<p>“Besides, the pillows still aren’t the right colour, and snogging isn’t going to change that.”</p>
<p>Neville wrinkles his nose at the word <em>snogging</em>, which is precisely the reason why Draco says it, although he’ll never admit to finding that expression cute, of all things. </p>
<p>“I’ll go and get you some different pillows,” Neville says. Draco waits until he’s turned around before wheeling around to glower at Harry, who looks entirely unrepentant. </p>
<p>“I gave you a palette with all the correct colours on it for a reason, Potter,” Draco hisses, grabbing Harry by the jacket while Neville disappears down the aisle, pillows tucked against the soft curve of his stomach. “I swear you’re doing this to me on purpose.”</p>
<p>The smirk on Harry’s face is the only confirmation he needs. Draco resists the temptation to throttle him by focusing on Neville’s ass disappearing around the corner, and then he breathes in deeply through his nose and points Harry in the direction of the trolley. </p>
<p>“You’re in charge of that,” Draco says. “Try not to run over any unsuspecting pedestrians.” </p>
<p>Harry quirks one eyebrow, grinning cockily. Draco <em>hates</em> that expression, because it never fails to ignite a fire in him. He shoos Harry towards the trolley and goes back to examining the lamp in front of him. </p>
<p>“I still can’t believe you agreed to shop in IKEA, of all places,” Harry says, idly kicking the ground with his foot, balancing on the rung of the trolley. Draco eyes the distance between Harry and the ground warily; if the trolley tips over, Draco’s not going to help him. He’s going to point and laugh and commit the moment to memory, maybe pack it away in a pensieve and bring it out at Christmas, or on special occasions. </p>
<p>“Neville feels more comfortable here,” Draco says absently, flicking the price tag over and examining the base of the lamp. He realises his mistake when he feels lips against his cheek. </p>
<p>“Such a Gryffindor,” Harry murmurs, and Draco can’t be held accountable for the way Harry suddenly finds himself sprawled on the floor. </p>
<p>It was obviously an accident. <em>Obviously</em>. </p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“We’re buying this.” </p>
<p>Harry makes a beeline for the most repulsive canvas Draco’s ever seen in his life. He shares a horrified expression with Neville, who looks a little green at the thought of hanging that in their living room. It’s brightly coloured, all different shades of the rainbow, and there are four black pictures of sloths, one in each corner. It looks, frankly, like something that’s been spat out by a toddler. </p>
<p>Neville tries for a placating expression, but it just comes out looking vaguely ill. “Harry, don’t you think that’s a bit… much?” </p>
<p>“It’s bloody awful,” Draco says plainly. Harry snaps his head up to glare at Draco, his green eyes flashing wildly, and then he picks the canvas up off the shelf slowly, making eye contact with Draco the entire time. </p>
<p>“Potter.” </p>
<p>Harry storms towards the trolley. </p>
<p>
  <em>“Potter.”</em>
</p>
<p>The canvas is promptly placed inside the trolley, next to the correct throw pillows. Draco snarls something wordless, pinching the bridge of his nose. Neville is studiously avoiding both of their gazes, and Draco can’t tell if he’s trying to avoid an argument or if he’s just trying not to laugh hysterically. </p>
<p>“Potter, it looks like a rainbow made love to a gumball machine and birthed this monstrosity,” Draco says exasperatedly. </p>
<p>“It was popular in the 1960’s,” Harry says, shrugging. “It’s culture.”</p>
<p>Draco splutters, and so does Neville, but for entirely different reasons. He can see Neville’s shoulders shaking, and obviously Harry can too, because he grins widely. </p>
<p>“You’re just encouraging him, Neville,” Draco mutters, shifting slightly towards the trolley with intent. Harry folds both arms over his chest and adopts a protective stance over the canvas. </p>
<p>“We are buying it,” Harry says, enunciating carefully. </p>
<p>“It can go in the bedroom, so only we have to see it,” Neville offers, still choking slightly on laughter. </p>
<p>“Wonderful,” Draco says. “Just what I’ve always wanted when I go to sleep at night; four sloths staring me down from inside Joseph’s Technicolour Dreamcoat.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Neville is in his element. Draco watches him survey the pots and pans and cutlery and kitchenware with a look of soft delight, his own mouth twitching up into a smile. </p>
<p>“Technically, we don’t really need any kitchen stuff,” Harry says, eyes glued to Neville’s round, slack shoulders. He’s humming as he runs his fingers over different boxes, some Muggle tune that Draco doesn’t recognise, wide hips swaying slightly as he bobs along. </p>
<p>“We have a whole bunch of stuff from my first flat, and you’ve got loads of fancy china that we’re probably not allowed to use,” Harry continues. Draco raises an eyebrow, a sly smile creeping over his face. </p>
<p>“Oh, well, in that case, I’ll just go and tell him that we’re leaving.”</p>
<p>Harry throws an arm out before he can take more than half a step forward, dragging Draco back with a glare. </p>
<p>“Don’t you dare,” Harry says. “You know how much he loves to bake. He could buy two of everything and I wouldn’t care, and neither would you.”</p>
<p>Draco doesn’t deny it. Instead, he curves an arm around Harry’s waist hesitantly, conscious of the fact that they’re surrounded by strangers. Harry leans into him without hesitation, sighing happily, and they both stand and watch as Neville makes a sound of pure delight, having discovered the array of fake fruit. </p>
<p>“I can feel you watching me,” Neville says, after a moment, and they both startle slightly. He doesn’t turn around, but he does hold up a bunch of wax grapes for them to see. “If I buy these, will you both promise not to forget and eat them in a pre-coffee morning haze?” </p>
<p>There’s a slightly guilty silence, and Neville sighs, placing the grapes back on the shelf. </p>
<p>“Thought not.” </p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Neville’s bright yellow fruit bowl – full of real apples and grapes – doesn’t really work with the dark-wood furniture that Draco’s painstakingly picked out, but he puts it on the coffee table regardless, sitting down beside Neville on the couch. The throw pillows are comfortable at his back, even if they are the wrong shade of cream. The sloth canvas does not go in the bedroom like Harry promised, but instead gets pride and place on the far wall, where the sloths can stare directly into Draco’s soul. </p>
<p>Draco averts his gaze, watching instead as Harry throws himself down on Neville’s other side and cracks a yawn, propping his socked feet up on the coffee table. Draco leans over Neville to knock them back down onto the floor, and Neville reels him into a long kiss before he can so much as utter a word. He feels Harry’s hand smooth its way up Neville’s thigh to find Draco’s hand and lace their fingers together. </p>
<p>Draco can’t help but think that none of it should really go together, but for some reason, it <em>fits</em>.</p>
