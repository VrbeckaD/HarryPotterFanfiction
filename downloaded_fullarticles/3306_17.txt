    <p>November 1997<span> </span></p><p>Softly, with the distant clink of the bottles in his carrier bag, Grantaire padded his way through the snow on the main street. The village was quiet, content, sleepy. It always was whenever a blanket of white descended on it, with people preferring to stay inside with their fires and hot drinks as opposed to face the biting cold.<span> </span></p><p>Grantaire was the exception, as he usually was. While everyone else complained about the cold and the snow he revelled in it. The cold was something he could easily shake off, and he liked the tranquility of sitting outside and puffing his breath out with a bottle of wine in hand. Winter brought with it its own beauty, and Grantaire considered himself lucky to be living in a part of England that was far north enough that he actually saw snow.<span> </span></p><p>Predictably, there was no one else out on the main street. The snow was still falling, albeit gently, and the ground was devoid of footprints, so when Grantaire sank his boots into the snow he could hear a satisfying crunch. <span> </span></p><p>He was heading to his favourite spot to sit alone and drink and take in the world, just outside of the actual village where he could see the countryside unfurl around him. His best paintings had been conjured up as he sat and watched the world go by, even if they weren’t landscapes of what he was actually seeing. There was something about being out in the world, being around nature, that sparked in Grantaire’s chest and got his creativity flowing. The small village that he had lived in his whole life had always been claustrophobic to him; he had gotten to the stage where he was sick of seeing the same people and the same buildings everyday. He was itching to finally get across the expanse of fields that he has looked out across so many times, to be somewhere new and inspiring and invigorating. As soon as his gap year was over and he had enough money, he was taking his car and driving to London without a second glance at the place he had grown up. <span> </span></p><p>Everyone else who lived here definitely thought he was an oddball. He wasn’t surprised nor he did he even remotely care. He’d pretty much embraced the fact that he, as a bisexual aspiring artist who was at least tipsy half the time, was never really going to fit in with the church going farmers that tended to populate the village. He’d been aching to get away since a trip he’d made to London with his mother when he was fourteen, just before she’d passed away. The hugeness of the city, the endless possibilities of it all had swept him away. He’d explored virtually every nook and cranny of his hometown, even back then. It was with sharp focus that he had realised that village life was simply not for him. It was too still, too <em>sedentary. </em>Nothing ever changed, and Grantaire hadn’t realised how much he’d craved change until then. Plus, he was never going to get any work or training as an artist in the middle of fucking nowhere, and all the best art schools in the country were in London. It seemed a logical choice, and he was vaguely proud that he at least had some form of a life plan. Even if it was probably one of the riskiest ones; art was always going to be a tough way of living.<span> </span></p><p>Floreal, his co-worker at the small café he worked in and probably his best friend in the village, had reminded him not to stay out daydreaming for too long. He probably worried her to death if he was honest; he was surprised that he hadn’t got hypothermia already. When he was alone with his thoughts time slipped away. He could spend hours with a bottle and the fresh air and occasionally a sketchbook. <span> </span></p><p>He headed off the main road, making his way through the winding streets and alleys that led to the edge of town. He was barely paying any attention to the roads, considering they were dead and that he knew them so well. A lone car trundled down one of the residential streets. The rest of the paths were asleep, despite the fact it was mid-afternoon.<span> </span></p><p>He had nearly made it to his spot when the weird shit started happening. As he was about to turn the corner, he heard cracking noises that almost sounded like whips. Alarm bells started ringing and he wondered, vaguely disturbed, if he was going to round the corner and see some sort of kinky sex act going on in the street. But then there was a shout of “Crucio” and a sharp cry of pain and suddenly Grantaire was racing round the corner.<span> </span></p><p>He couldn’t explain rationally what greeted him, but in the moment all he could see was a young man around his own age with startling blond hair crouching on the ground and an older man standing over him. At first Grantaire thought that he was brandishing a gun, but as he got closer it appeared to be a short stick of wood. On its own, it wouldn’t have appeared threatening at all, but the man had a thunderous look on his face and the blond guy flinched when he raised the stick against him. Grantaire had decidedly stumbled upon the oddest brawl in the world.<span> </span></p><p>And then there was a flash of light which seemed to emanate from the stick—wand?—and the blond guy has his own wand to defend himself with. His back was towards Grantaire, but he heard a cry of “Stupefy” and another flash moving towards the older man, who promptly deflected it with some sort of invisible force field.<span> </span></p><p>Neither man had noticed Grantaire, who was now standing on the corner of the street gaping at the two of them. They were too absorbed in their duel or whatever seemed to happening.<span> </span></p><p>“What the fuck!” Looking back, he definitely shouldn’t have brought any attention to himself and slowly sidled out of that situation, but he was too shocked at what he saw that he couldn’t help but swear loudly; it was his automatic response. <span> </span></p><p>Both of the men broke their focus and stared at Grantaire, seemingly shocked to see someone else on a public street. The blond turned to face him for the first time, and even from afar Grantaire was struck by how beautiful he was. Beautiful was the right word; he wasn’t necessarily hot or fit but he was <em>beautiful. </em><span> </span></p><p>In fact, Grantaire was so distracted by his beauty and still in shock from what he’d just witnessed that he barely registered that he was shouting at Grantaire. “Run, run away, run!” <span> </span></p><p>The older man seemed to use Grantaire’s arrival to his own advantage. He shot a flash of light in Grantaire’s direction, but before he could react to it and move the beautiful blond guy had stepped in the way and had begun firing back. His opponent lashed out and he barely managed to defend himself against the inexplicable streams of green light. One seemed to hit him as he cried out in pain again but he continued firing.<span> </span></p><p>Perhaps it was some sort of reaction to the shout or maybe just the fact that this stranger had just defended him against god knows what, but without thinking he’d found that he’d made his way across the street and was now closer to the fight. Maybe he should have followed the advice and ran away but he couldn’t just leave someone who may well have saved his life to fend for themselves in a fight. And maybe it had something to do with the fact that the blond was <em>really </em>pretty, but Grantaire was getting closer and closer to the fight.<span> </span></p><p>His saviour, the blond guy, looked at him with contempt and utter confusion as he approached the two of them. “What are you doing, you idiot? Get out of here.” Grantaire, who had never been one to follow any sort of order, was now standing right in front of the older man, who had brown hair and forgettable features but was snarling at the pair of them. He moved his wand a fraction, but Grantaire was close enough now to swing his arm back and punch him in the face before he could even lift his arm all the way up.<span> </span></p><p>He went stumbling back, clutching his face and staring at Grantaire with shocked eyes. This earned him a grin; clearly neither of these two had anticipated that Grantaire had taken boxing classes all the way through high school. Whilst he was still too surprised to move, Grantaire punched him again, this time so hard that he fell on the floor, momentarily unconscious with his wand having fallen out of his hand. His knuckles were definitely going to be bruised after this, but it was worth it simply for the look that blondie was giving him as he turned around. It was incredulous, shocked but definitely low key impressed. <span> </span></p><p>“What just happened?” He seemed to be more amazed that Grantaire had punched someone than about the fact that two minutes ago he had been shooting beams of light from a stick of wood. Which made absolutely zero sense, and honestly Grantaire was wondering if what he had just seen was some sort of weird hallucination or something. It might have made more sense if he was drunk or high, but Grantaire was pretty sure that he was currently painfully sober.<span> </span></p><p>“I think I should be asking you that. But before we start with the questioning, we should probably get out of here, before he wakes up or someone else sees.”<span> </span></p><p>Seemingly in a bit of a daze, he nodded at Grantaire’s words and bent down to pick up the discarded wand from next to the unconscious man. Grantaire was priming himself up for running, but before he could take off he felt a hand on his arm. The fingers were gentle but the touch startled him so much that he whipped around, only to find that reality seemed to be melting away. Vertigo, acutely sharp, washed over him as his surroundings blurred and there was a roaring in his ears. The next thing he knew, they were no longer in the small village Grantaire had lived in all his life. They were somewhere new and totally alien, surrounded by trees and not much else. Definitely not the houses and cars that they had been next to a moment ago. <span> </span></p><p>“Okay, what the actual—” He was interrupted by his stomach finally deciding to join the rest of his body in this new location and subsequently forcing all of its contents spewing onto the floor. Luckily, the blond-haired guy had stepped out of the way, so Grantaire didn’t have to deal with the embarrassment of vomiting all over the guy who he’d just saved from a fight.<span> </span></p><p>When he was done and his body felt vaguely normal again, he stood up properly and turned to take a proper look at the other man. He was tall, certainly taller than Grantaire, and slim and slender. He was wearing a startling red coat which was tattered at the edges and jeans which had seen better days. His hair was immediately the feature that stood out the most, with it being a rich blond colour that was almost like gold particularly where the harsh winter’s sun glinted against it. His face was soft, delicate and almost feminine, but his deep blue eyes were steely and determined. Grantaire thought that he looked like a god in the midst of a battle; perfect but in a harsh way. <span> </span></p><p>He was now looking at Grantaire with an expression of apology, but also agitation and maybe the beginnings of anger. There were a lot of things that Grantaire was currently failing to comprehend about this situation, but why he would be angry after Grantaire had essentially saved his life was beyond him.<span> </span></p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said, gesturing vaguely to the contents of Grantaire’s stomach that were spread all over the ground. It was the first time that Grantaire noted that he spoke with a French accent. “It can be a little disorientating the first time.”<span> </span></p><p>It was the fact that he spoke so calmly about the fact that they’d apparently teleporting that set Grantaire off. <span> </span></p><p>“Oh yeah sure, a little disorienting, that’s great. What the fuck just happened?” <span> </span></p><p>He hesitated, as if unsure where to begin to answer Grantaire’s question. “It’s…complicated.”<span> </span></p><p>“Complicated? You were firing light from a stick and we were in the street in Colby and now we’re in the middle of a forest in god knows where. Yeah, complicated.”<span> </span></p><p>He was freaking out a little and he knew it, but the adrenaline that had caused him to punch the other man was fading and now the full gravity and complete bizarreness of the situation was beginning to hit him. He wasn’t even sure if he had punched the right man; for all he knew he’d just run off with a murderer or something even more fucked up.<span> </span></p><p>“I shouldn’t tell you anything, not really. I should wipe your memory and send you back.” He said this with a casual air without faltering, but the look on his face was conflicted. <span> </span></p><p>“You’re not going to wipe my memory.” As soon as he said the words, he knew that they were true. “I saved your life back there, or at least helped you get out of the fight quicker.”<span> </span></p><p>The other nodded, as if only now making up his mind. “You’re right. I suppose I should thank you for that. Although I do explicitly remember telling you to run away multiple times. And you ignoring me.”<span> </span></p><p>“Thank you accepted. And I was never going to run away from a fight; I’ve seen my fair share of bar brawls and I've taken boxing classes, so I know how to handle myself.  So now that we’ve settled that my memories are going to remain thoroughly unwiped, would you care to fill me in on what’s going on? I’m still kind of freaking out over here.”<span> </span></p><p>“I suppose I should.” He stuck his hand out, catching Grantaire off guard. He must have stared for it for few seconds longer than he should have before shaking it slightly hesitantly. “I’m Enjolras.”<span> </span></p><p><em>Enjolras. </em>The name fit him, foreign and fancy. It rolled off his tongue fluidly, and his French accent became more pronounced when saying it.<span> </span></p><p>“Grantaire. Or R, if you prefer. I don’t mind.”<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras smiled as he worked out the pun behind it and Grantaire was struck by how it lit up his entire face. He hadn’t realised just how solemn and serious Enjolras had looked before until he saw what a simple smile had done to his features. <span> </span></p><p>“<em>Parles-vous</em><em> </em><em>Fran</em><em>cais</em><em>?” </em>He seemed much more comfortable speaking in his own language, and Grantaire would be lying if he didn’t say that it made him even more alluring. French was a beautiful language, the language of love if you will, and spoken by a beautiful man sent his heart fluttering a little. <span> </span></p><p><em>"Ma mère était française."</em> His mother had taught him French as a little boy, had dreamed of taking him to Paris where she'd grown up but had never gotten the chance.<em> "</em>But you’re getting distracted from the point. Magic wands? Teleportation? Memory wiping? And just who did I knock out?”<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras shrugged. “The short version is: magic is real. I’ll tell you the long version if you let me cast a couple of spells to protect us from other people like the one you punched and promise not to freak out too much. I figure I owe you that much.”<span> </span></p><p>Grantaire nodded, and sat down as Enjolras took his wand and started muttering things under his breath. He needed a moment to wrap his head around what he’d seen and what Enjolras had just said. <em>Magic. </em>Magic was real. He’d seen magic, actual real magic. Enjolras was <em>literally</em> magic; he didn’t just seem magical and god-like. He was suddenly regretting putting down his carrier bag of bottles on the street back in Colby, he could really do with a drink to take the edge off right now.<span> </span></p><p>When Enjolras had finished and sat down on a tree stump next to him, Grantaire was bursting with questions. Eloquently, the first one he actually asked was, “So… magic?”<span> </span></p><p>“Yes, magic. I’m a wizard.” A part of Grantaire was still expecting this all to be some sort of elaborate joke, but Enjolras said that with such seriousness and sincerity that he couldn’t help but believe it. Enjolras spoke with a sense of absolution behind his words that made him immediately trustworthy to Grantaire.<span> </span></p><p>“There’s a whole magical community across the world that you muggles don’t even know about,” Enjolras continued. “But things are bad at the moment. Wizards and witches and muggles alike are in danger.”<span> </span></p><p>“Muggles?” <span> </span></p><p>“Non-magic people, like you.” Grantaire was unsure of whether to find this insulting or not, but he let it slide. “The guy you knocked out, he’s part of the group of people that are putting everyone in danger. They’re called Death Eaters, and they follow…” He trailed off. “<em>Merde</em><em>.”</em><span> </span></p><p>“They follow who?”<span> </span></p><p>“I can’t say his name; it's been jinxed so that they can track anyone who says it out loud. We tend to call him You-Know-Who, except in this case you don’t know who, or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.” A light seemed to light up behind Enjolras’s eyes as he clearly thought of an idea. “His name is flight of death in French.”<span> </span></p><p>Grantaire’s French was good, but not perfect. Vol de mort? Voldemort? It seemed like an odd name, although maybe it was normal for wizards to be called odd names like Voldemort.<span> </span></p><p>He began to say it aloud, not really registering what Enjolras had just said, but he was quickly silenced by a scathing look. “I just told you why we don’t say his name. So don’t say it.”<span> </span></p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m still trying to wrap my head around the fact that saying a word can allow people to track you. This whole magic thing is still a bit abstract to me, you know?” <span> </span></p><p>Maybe he shouldn’t have responded with sarcasm, but then again maybe Enjolras shouldn’t have scolded him. It earned him an eye roll from Enjolras, but he seemed to get away with it because Enjolras carried on talking as if he hadn’t talked back at him. <span> </span></p><p>“You-know-who is the darkest wizard of our time, possibly the darkest wizard ever. He’s somewhat of a magic purist, meaning that he thinks that anyone who doesn’t descend from so-called ‘pureblood’ families and who doesn’t follow him is automatically a blood traitor. He hates muggles, thinks we should rule over them, over you. And he’s utterly ruthless and frightens the entire wizarding community.”<span> </span></p><p>And this is it. This is what makes Enjolras tick. Grantaire can practically see the passion rolling off him in waves, can it see the way his eyes light up and his hand gestures become more frantic. He <em>really </em>hates this Voldemort guy, but more than that, he <em>really </em>hates the ideals that are driving him. The fact that ‘magic purism’ even exists is abhorrent to Enjolras; the way he says the words conveys his emotions more than any explaining ever could. <span> </span></p><p>It turned out that once Enjolras had started talking about this, it was very hard to make him stop. He had a voice and, more importantly, a passion that completely enraptured Grantaire, making him hang off Enjolras’s every word. He spoke of war, of Voldemort gathering followers and feeding off the prejudices that were already present in the magical community. He talked about the chaos, then about the uneasy quiet after Voldemort had gone quiet. He talked about a boy named Harry Potter who survived the killing curse from Voldemort and who was now sort of the leader and only hope in the fight. He talked about the rise of Voldemort, about the horrors that have followed, about the Snatchers and the deaths and the fights.<span> </span></p><p>It was all still a bit overwhelming for Grantaire, but he was beginning to piece together the world that he’d just accidentally been thrust into. It was alien and a tad terrifying, but he was fascinated by it all. <span> </span></p><p>Mostly though, he was intrigued by Enjolras. Enjolras who, despite talking about such dark and frankly depressing things, retained a hope that things would get better. Grantaire admired his passion, the way he talked about issues as though they were things he could singlehandedly fix, and maybe he wished that some of it might rub off on himself. There was also something about him and his passion that made<span> </span></p><p>The sun was nearly setting, and involuntarily Grantaire found himself shivering. There was nowhere near as much snow here (wherever here was) as there was back in Colby, but it was still the UK and it was still November so it was probably only just above freezing. He may have had his coat on, but he’d lost track of how long they’d been here with Enjolras talking and filling him in on this whole new world.<span> </span></p><p>“Are you cold?” The question startled Grantaire; this whole afternoon had been Grantaire asking the questions and it was to have Enjolras suddenly ask him one, to care enough to ask him if he was cold.<span> </span></p><p>“A little. In case you’ve forgotten, it is winter.”<span> </span></p><p>“You should have said. In case you’ve forgotten, I’m a wizard.” At this, Enjolras produced his wand from his coat pocket. “Incendio,” Enjolras murmured, and a flame of orange fire spouted from the end of it. From his place just next to Enjolras, Grantaire could already feel the heat of the flames.  <span> </span></p><p>“If we get a bit of wood, I can light a proper fire. If you’d like?” Enjolras said, with the last bit tacked on a little uncertainly. “Or I guess, I could take you back…”<span> </span></p><p>“No,” said Grantaire, who still had so much more he wanted to know about magic and, selfishly, about Enjolras himself.<span> </span></p><p>About ten minutes later they had a roaring fire to warm their hands over. There seemed to be no difference to a normal fire, despite the fact that it had been created by magic but Grantaire still marvelled at it. <span> </span></p><p>“So how did a French guy like you end up in the middle of nowhere, England, fighting off Death Eaters?”<span> </span></p><p>If Enjolras was getting tired of Grantaire’s constant questioning, he didn’t show it. “I went to school here for the last two years. Well, technically in Scotland, but still. I saw first-hand what You-Know-Who was doing, how it was affecting the magical community here in the UK. And I couldn’t just go back to France and forget about it all, forget about my friends here. I couldn’t hide, not when there was even the smallest chance to fight against You-Know-Who and the injustices that he stands for. I have to do <em>something. </em>Even if that means nearly getting caught or killed by Death Eaters. So I rallied my friends back in France and we came here because we can help, and we can fight. This is <em>important, </em>Grantaire”<span> </span></p><p>There was a part of Grantaire that wished he was Enjolras in that moment. There was a passion coating his words; Enjolras was fire and hope and freedom personified. Grantaire was just about struggling through his own mess of a life, but Enjolras, this strange wizard he’d met in literally the oddest circumstances, reeked of optimism and a desire to selflessly help others. <span> </span></p><p>Grantaire knew rationally that he should just leave it and agree, but he wanted to hear more. And so he found himself saying, “Okay, I get that. But what can one Frenchman really do in this huge, messy, confusing fight?”<span> </span></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, he sort of regretted them because he wasn’t entirely sure if he meant them. But he could see Enjolras getting a little angry and riled up just from the twitch of his mouth, could see the ticking bomb in him begin to explode. <span> </span></p><p>On anyone else, anger was an ugly emotion. But on Enjolras, this kind of anger just set off that passion and spark he had, and it was so strange but Grantaire was already hooked on the absolute spectrum of Enjolras’s emotions.<span> </span></p><p>“Does it matter? What one Frenchman does? If I can do anything at all, even if that means just slowing down a single Death Eater, I will.”<span> </span></p><p>And Grantaire believed him.<span> </span></p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Grantaire woke up shivering and disorientated, unsure of where he was and how he had got there. At first he thought he’d fallen asleep in his spot, but as he cracked open his eyes he noticed the remnants of a fire, an unfamiliar woodland and a blond man sleeping next to him on the ground. So it had all been real then, the fight and the magic and Enjolras. <span> </span></p><p>He must have woken up Enjolras when he started moving and before he knew it, they were both awake and looking at each other. <span> </span></p><p>“What now?” Grantaire asked. He couldn’t imagine just going back to his own little village and forgetting that this had ever happened.<span> </span></p><p>“Now, I take you back and then find my friends.” Enjolras was nothing if not blunt about it, but Grantaire wasn’t having any of it. He’d made up his mind at some point that this wasn’t going to be the end of whatever the fuck this was. He craved to be around Enjolras and his magic and his politics and his world more than he’d thought possible.<span> </span></p><p>“I want to come with you. I want to see more, to know more. Did you really think I could just go home and pretend now that I know a literal magical war is being fought under our very noses?”<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras sighed. “I can’t take you with me. Not only is it dangerous, but you’re a muggle. You wouldn’t know what you’re getting yourself into.”<span> </span></p><p>“I think you explained it pretty well last night. Evil magic guy with a huge group of followers. A lost leader of the rebellion. Magical duels. That’s enough for me.”<span> </span></p><p>There was a hint of anger behind Enjolras’s words, but not enough to deter him. “Last night you were mouthing off my cause and now you want to be a part of it?”<span> </span></p><p>He shrugged. “Every revolution needs its cynic. It doesn’t mean I don’t believe in what you’re doing fundamentally, I’m just healthily sceptical.”<span> </span></p><p>“This isn’t a revolution, it’s a fucking fight for humanity. But it’s not your fight, Grantaire.”<span> </span></p><p>Maybe it wasn’t. Maybe he was being an absolute idiot by wanting to stay, by being so stubborn with Enjolras but the part of him that just didn’t care had taken over. Life in Colby had always seemed a bit bleak to him, but it would be even bleaker now knowing all of this was happening and he was sitting around doing nothing.<span> </span></p><p>“On the contrary,” he said, “It became my fight the moment I punched the Death Eater.”<span> </span></p><p>He was fully prepared to stare Enjolras down, but something changed in the blond’s eyes and he said “You can stay until I find my friends. Then I take you back, no arguing.”<span> </span></p><p>Grantaire’s smile widened. “Besides, you wouldn’t want to be travelling around alone in such a dangerous foreign country.”<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras did nothing but roll his eyes and Grantaire knew he’d won. He felt a weird sense of satisfaction knowing he’d worn Enjolras down, despite not fully knowing what he was walking into here.<span> </span></p><p>This time, when they gripped hands to apparate, it felt a little strange. Before they’d been in such a rush that Grantaire hadn’t had a second to consider it, but now holding hands with Enjolras made his cheeks go a little red. Which was so stupid, but Enjolras was an attractive man and Grantaire didn’t get the opportunity to hold hands with attractive men very often. Brief flings didn’t really extend to holding hands.<span> </span></p><p>That lurching sensation hit him again, but at least he had expected it this time. The world around him spun and spun, and all of a sudden he was somewhere else entirely.<span> </span></p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>It turns out that being on the run wasn't quite as fun and exciting as Grantaire had initially thought. <span> </span></p><p>He wasn't entirely sure what he had been expecting, but the reality of sleeping in the middle of nowhere as Enjolras tried and failed to track his friends didn't line up with any image he'd had. With anyone else the whole affair would have been the most boring thing in the world, but Grantaire had to admit that any time spent with Enjolras sent butterflies flapping around beneath his skin.<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras couldn't seem to work out a plan on how he was going to get back to his friends, which was honestly more frustrating to Enjolras than it was for Grantaire. He kept lamenting that they should have set up a rendezvous point or some way to send a message, cursing his past self for not thinking about it. It was actually quite amusing, particularly when Grantaire realised that he slipped into French when he was agitated, mumbling in quite colourful language about how much of an idiot he was.<span> </span></p><p>"<em>You do realise that I can understand everything you're saying?" </em>Grantaire said once as they sat in their little makeshift camp in front of the fire as Enjolras was going on a spiel about the advantages of foresight.<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras jerked a little, having clearly forgotten that Grantaire could speak French since all their conversations had been in English.<span> </span></p><p>After a few moments of silence, with nothing but the fire crackling between them making a noise, Grantaire spoke up again. "Tell me about them. About the friends that you're so obsessed with finding again. They clearly mean a lot to you, from the way that you talk about them."<span> </span></p><p>He could hear it in the longing tone with which Enjolras used whenever he talked about his friends. It was more than just desperation in getting back to the safety net of having other wizards around him who would probably be infinitely more useful in a duel than Grantaire would (not that he'd ever admit that to Enjolras). He genuinely missed them; it made Grantaire ache a little. <span> </span></p><p>"We call ourselves Les Amis de l'ABC. Kinda stupid I know, but you're not the only one who likes puns." Enjolras's soft smile gave away his affection for the name, and for the group.<span> </span></p><p>The way Enjolras spoke about his friends had a quiet sort of passion, very different from the simmering rage he had when he talked of the war. He told Grantaire of Courfeyrac, the joker of the group, and Combeferre, the quieter yet infinitely more calming influence who had stopped Enjolras from doing stupid shit on too many occasions. <span> </span></p><p>He learnt about Feuilly, the older wizard that Enjolras had always admired, and Bahorel, who kept conversation flowing even when things were awkward. About Joly, the hypochondriac absolutely dead set on becoming a healer, about Bossuet, who had the worst luck but managed to make a joke of it, about Musichetta, whose laugh was always infectious. He learnt of Marius, who was a bit of a dolt but somehow managed to stumble through life, of sweet Cosette who put up with Marius's shit with a smile. He learnt of Jehan, the dreamy poet who seemed to perpetually live in summer and of Éponine, who had been through a lot of shit but whose heart was still so open.<span> </span></p><p>By the end of it, Grantaire was filled with almost as much longing to actually meet these people as Enjolras had to get back to them. Maybe it was just Enjolras's infectious affection, but nevertheless his friends genuinely seemed like great people. It made him acutely aware of his own isolation in his little northern village where he had one close friend and not much else. Enjolras's group sounded colourful and eclectic and exactly the kind of people Grantaire would get along with.<span> </span></p><p>"So, you all went to school together?"<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras nodded. "Back in France, we all attended the same magical school, Beauxbatons." He pronounced the name of the school softly, his French accent becoming more pronounced. "I left two and a half years ago, after my parents died and my legal guardian became my British uncle who was kind enough to take me in but only if I attended Hogwarts, the wizarding school here in the UK."<span> </span></p><p>There was a silence, perhaps not awkward but definitely heavy. Finally, Grantaire said, "I'm sorry. About your parents. It must have been shit going through that when you were still in school. When my mother died it was absolute hell. I was so close with her, and I've only grown even more and more distant to my dad since she passed away."<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras regarded him for a moment, as if unsure what to say. "I was never exactly close with my parents. We're from an old pureblood family, and they were pretty traditional. They already didn't like my rather radical ideals and abundance of halfblood and muggle born friends, and when I mentioned that I'm gay they were horrified that their pureblood wouldn't pass onto the next generation or similar bullshit. The saddest part was leaving my friends in France to come to Hogwarts, though I'm glad I did so I could be a part of this war and do my bit." He looked at the ground, and then back at Grantaire. "I wish I had a parent who I loved enough to miss, for their deaths to be hell to me."<span> </span></p><p>Silence once again descended on them, but this time companionable. Hearing out loud that Enjolras was gay would have at any other time sent his heart racing with possibilities that would never come to pass, but the moment was solemnised by the discussion of dead parents. Without fully comprehending what he was doing, Grantaire reached out and took Enjolras's hand in his own. His skin was warm and rough, the physical contact grounding.<span> </span></p><p>They sat for a while, hands entwined, ruminating on lost parents and lost friends, and new things to discover.<span> </span></p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>In the next town they passed through, they picked up a radio.<span> </span></p><p>They'd been on the road for a few weeks now, and had taken to trading stories over the fireplace or arguing about both the trivial and the important. If he was honest, Grantaire felt most alive when he managed to spark that anger and passion in Enjolras that had drawn him in in the first place, and every time he could slowly feel himself slipping slowly more into the feeling surrounding the fiery blond that he couldn't quite place but he knew was extremely important.<span> </span></p><p>Naturally, they argued about the radio too. Enjolras insisted that they have it on constantly to try and get into the Potterwatch channel. <span> </span></p><p>"I've been on Potterwatch, I'm friends with Lee Jordan, who runs it. It's absolutely the perfect way to contact Les Amis."<span> </span></p><p>Potterwatch, it turned out, was a radio show used to give news to people against Voldemort about how the fight was going. And whilst Grantaire did think that was a great idea, it was the constant static noise that emanated from the damn contraption that he couldn't stand and argued with Enjolras about. He hadn't managed to work out the password to actually listen to the show, so instead spent half the time tampering with it.<span> </span></p><p>One blustery evening, Grantaire had had enough of it. He swore that even his dreams were filled with static noise at this point, which was enough to drive any man crazy. Plus, he couldn't concentrate; despite being uprooted suddenly he was still keeping up with his sketching, keeping up practicing for art school. He's blushed when Enjolras had asked him what he was drawing so often as he didn't want to admit that his sketch book lately had been filled mostly of the blond himself, along with some sketches and visualisations of magic. <span> </span></p><p>"Look, Enjolras," he said, his tone unintentionally exasperated. "Can you knock it off, at least for tonight. Can we either find a normal station to listen to or switch it off entirely?"<span> </span></p><p>He was expecting an argument, but Enjolras actually switched it over to a station that wasn't constant static. Grantaire gave him a surprised look; he hadn't expected him to be so compliant. Enjolras only shrugged. "Yeah, okay, it is pretty annoying," he muttered, which earned him a laugh from Grantaire, who could tell that admitting that he was wrong was probably akin to dying in Enjolras's mind. <span> </span></p><p>He'd switched it to a normal, or muggle as Enjolras would have called it, station. The radio host was talking, but quickly a song began to play. It wasn't one that he knew, something slow but moving, about a train. The song, though, wasn't what mattered. Grantaire was more preoccupied with Enjolras and his expression, his look of wonder.<span> </span></p><p>"I never listen to muggle music," he said.<span> </span></p><p>"What quantifies wizard music as different to muggle music?" Grantaire said with a smile. "Does wizard music have magical notes or something?"<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras shrugged. "Nothing, really. The wizarding community is just weirdly segregated from the rest of the world on random things. In America it only became legal for a wizard to marry a muggle a couple of decades ago. It feels, sometimes, that we're so far away from your world, especially for those of us whose entire family are wizards."<span> </span></p><p>"Don't you think that's kinda stupid? And alienating?" He knew that this was entering into deeper realms of conversation than music, but he was genuinely curious as to what Enjolras would say. "Maybe it's perpetuating the kind of attitudes that has led to this war. Mass feelings of superiority have to begin somewhere, after all."<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras was looking at him curiously and intently, perhaps more intently than he'd ever looked at Grantaire. He felt like he was being examined, as if Enjolras was seeing him for the first time. "Maybe wizarding society needs a revolution after all."<span> </span></p><p>He knew it had been creeping up on him, knew in his bones that this was inevitable, but the soft look that Enjolras was giving him, made him stomach drop. He was absolutely floored all of a sudden by the utter adoration that had been building up for him. Enjolras was perfect and passionate, full of life and inspired. He was the opposite to Grantaire in so many ways, but that just made him pine even more.<span> </span></p><p>And he knew, in that moment, that despite being a lowly muggle to Enjolras's magic, he'd follow this man to revolution. He might not care or believe or even live in the same world as him, but he would follow him regardless.<span> </span></p><p>It wasn't reasonable, but Grantaire had never been very reasonable. And so, with the lulling beat of that song about the train still playing in the background, Grantaire smiled at him and said, "Maybe."<span> </span></p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>"Wait, so you're saying your school was like, an actual castle?"<span> </span></p><p>It was a cold night, and they had a fire crackling between them. The stars were bright though, and after having drank half a bottle of whiskey Grantaire was feeling looser, if not a tad tipsy. Spending nearly constant amounts of time with Enjolras meant that there were long periods when they didn't talk to each other. A lot of the times they did talk, they argued or ranted at each other. But now, something about the atmosphere of the night had led to easy, light conversation, where they both smiled and laughed and Grantaire's chest felt light. He couldn't deny that he was fascinated by even the small details of his life and all the magic that was so integrated in it. It was so far off his small, village lifestyle, where he'd gone to a half falling down state school.<span> </span></p><p>"Maybe," Enjolras said, his voice lilting with humour. "It's historic. Although I kept getting lost my first week there, since everyone else in my year knew where they were going and I didn't. Plus the stairs move."<span> </span></p><p>"The stairs fucking move? God, my drunk arse would fall down them all the time."<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras smiled at him, and Grantaire couldn't deny that his heart fluttered a little in his chest. "It's weird to imagine you at Hogwarts; I feel like you'd simultaneously fit right in and stand out like a sore thumb. I wonder what house you'd be in."<span> </span></p><p>"House?" His vaguely shitty school hadn't been posh enough for houses.<span> </span></p><p>"Yeah, we had four houses named after our four founders. Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, each one for different aspects of people's personality and values. In crude terms, Gryffindor is bravery and valour, Slytherin is ambition and resourcefulness, Hufflepuff is loyalty and hard work and Ravenclaw is intelligence and wit."<span> </span></p><p>Grantaire nearly asked how the school could possibly determine which house a kid should go in before he remembered: <em>magic. </em><span> </span></p><p><em>"</em>Let me guess, you were in Gryffindor." Bravery and valour seemed to suit Enjolras completely.<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras grinned. "You got me. Although, the Sorting Hat was very divided between Gryffindor and Slytherin for me. I genuinely think what swayed it was my natural affinity for the colour red, which is the house colour for Gryffindor. I don't think I would have suited green."<span> </span></p><p>"Hey," said Grantaire, gesturing to his green jumper. "Don't talk too much shit about green. Green's my favourite colour."<span> </span></p><p>They shared a smile, and Grantaire felt so right; the easy conversation and the stars glittering down on them and the cool wind against his cheeks but the warm fire on his fingertips. He never wanted it to end.<span> </span></p><p>"I'm glad I got put in Gryffindor, anyway. It meant that I could make some really great friends who were already rebelling, already on the right side."<span> </span></p><p>"Let me guess, that leader guy. Harry Potter? You were friends with him?" It would not surprise Grantaire whatsoever to learn that Enjolras had attracted the attention of the leader of the rebellion, of the Chosen One. He would almost be disappointed if he hadn't.<span> </span></p><p>"Yes, I guess." Grantaire thought that he detected a slight blush on those high cheekbones. "The year I joined Hogwarts was the year Harry Potter and his friends set up a group called Dumbledore's Army, with Harry leading it and teaching us how to defend ourselves against the dark arts. It was odd at first, because I guess I was so used to taking the lead with Les Amis. But Harry was truly inspiring. He's lived through some absolute shit, fought against You-Know-Who himself when he was eleven years old, and he still managed to be a great leader, and a great friend."<span> </span></p><p>"Oh my god," said Grantaire, a laugh bubbling its way up his chest. "You had a crush on him, didn't you?"<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras's spluttering was all that Grantaire needed for confirmation, and he let the laugh out, truly amused. It felt so good to sit here with Enjolras and just laugh and joke, like actual friends. <span> </span></p><p>"Okay, so I may have been briefly," began Enjolras, catching Grantaire's eye and giving him a glare. "<em>Briefly </em>enamoured with him. Briefly. Anyways, he's almost painfully straight and spent most of my first year there crushing on a girl named Cho Chang, and then the second a girl named Ginny Weasley. I got over it pretty quickly and learnt to admire him as a friend."<span> </span></p><p>Grantaire grinned. "It's a bit of a cliché though, to fall for the charismatic leader, the source of inspiration," he said, extremely aware of how hypocritical it was for him to say that when he'd essentially done exactly the same thing with Enjolras.<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras laughed a little, his laugh which was rare but as beautiful as he was. "Cliché or not, it did not last," Enjolras said emphatically. "Besides, Harry was never exactly a charismatic leader. He was a great teacher and he's the Chosen One and all that, but he didn't even rally Dumbledore's Army together himself. That was all due to his friend, Hermione Granger, who is probably the person I miss most from Hogwarts, though I can assure you I didn’t have a crush on her for obvious reasons." He smiled to himself, clearly remembering something fondly. "She is perhaps one of the most passionate and feisty people I have met, as well as one of the most intelligent. The year before I got there she had started a group called S.P.E.W to protect house-elves, an issue that no one was talking about or even cared about, and despite the fact that pretty much everyone shunned her for it she carried on anyway. I always admired her for it; she was one of my closest friends in the two years I was there."<span> </span></p><p>"She sounds a bit like a female version of you," said Grantaire. He wondered what the two of them had been like together. Unstoppable was the word that instantly came to mind.<span> </span></p><p>"I suppose you could say that. If anything, it would have been cliché to fall for her. Ron Weasley, Harry and Hermione's best friend who definitely did have a crush on her, hated me inexplicably for about six months until he realised I'm gay and have no interest in her romantically."<span> </span></p><p>Grantaire couldn't help but be reminded of his own cliché crush on Enjolras; hearing him talk about who he had and hadn't been romantically attracted to was all of a sudden a bit too much to handle. He found himself abruptly changing the topic, steering it away from crushes and clichés, mostly to make himself try to forget his own woes.<span> </span></p><p>"So, what house do you think I'd be in then? Use your magical skills or whatever to determine my personality. I somehow doubt I'd be in Gryffindor with you and your mates."<span> </span></p><p>If he was surprised by the sudden topic change, he didn't show it. "R, you forget that I've spent the last few weeks in your presence 24/7. I don't need any magic to know your personality." But he hesitated before actually giving his opinion, pondering for a moment. As with everything, he seemed to be thoroughly thinking about it rather than just throwing out a random answer like Grantaire would have done. "I genuinely think Ravenclaw."<span> </span></p><p>"Wait, is that the intelligent one? You're kidding, right? You do realise I'm an artist, not a scientist or whatever."<span> </span></p><p>"Sure, but art is a form of intelligence. God, R, you wax poetic about classics and mythology, about art movements and brush techniques. You talk intelligently with me about the politics of a world that you're not even a <em>part </em>of. Sure, you argue with me and are possibly the most stubborn person I know, but you're also smart and pick up things so quickly. So yeah, I think you'd be in Ravenclaw."<span> </span></p><p>Compliments like that were not a thing Grantaire received often; in fact, he couldn't even remember the last time someone had said something so genuinely nice about him. It stunned him, left him not really knowing what to say. The fact that <em>Enjolras </em>thought that he was intelligent and not just a worthless drunk struck a chord somewhere deep within him. A rebellious part of him wanted desperately to lean over and kiss Enjolras, to convey what he felt in a way that words can't. He was having more and more trouble reigning in that rebellious part of him that was so enamoured by Enjolras and actually wanted to do something about it lately, not content to just let him pine like the rest of him. <span> </span></p><p>"Enjolras," he managed to get out, but before he could say any more he felt the temperature drop very suddenly. Whereas he had been mildly cold before, he was now shivering, his breath coming out in puffs of steam. Enjolras definitely noticed this too; he'd drawn his wand without any hesitation and leapt up, his whole body wired for impending danger.<span> </span></p><p>The wind was howling in his ears, and there was a tense, ominous mood that hadn’t been here ten seconds ago. There had to be somethings magical going on here, something that he didn't quite understand. "Grantaire," Enjolras murmured, his voice soft and cautious. "Grantaire, get behind me."<span> </span></p><p>He saw it as soon as he started moving, a cloaked figure drifting above the ground and through the trees. It moved with eerie silence, bringing with it a dark sense of dread that pooled in the pit of Grantaire's stomach. The happy atmosphere he'd been enjoying so much had been sucked from the air with the presence of this figure, leaving behind only pain and dread and fear. It got closer, close enough to tower above Grantaire, its skeletal figure cloaked and foreboding and its face still obscure. He didn't know what it was, but it was bringing awful feelings to the forefront of Grantaire's mind; thoughts of his mother dying, of his father telling him that he wasn't good enough, of feeling worthless, of the dread accumulating at having to lose Enjolras and the magic that accompanied him soon. <span> </span></p><p>But Enjolras was in front of him in a flash of red, brandishing his wand and shouting "Expecto Patronum!"<span> </span></p><p>There was a flash of silver, and then an ethereal, silvery lioness was standing between them and the creature, radiating silver energy that seemed to be teeming with happiness and positivity. It was counteracting the horrible, cold feeling that had spread through him before, and the creature was flinching away. It was gone in a few moments, repelled by the lioness that was standing protective of Enjolras and Grantaire. <span> </span></p><p>Finally, the light emanating from Enjolras's wand faded, and then it was just the two of them in their little camp again. Grantaire hadn't noticed how much he'd been shivering, but now he couldn't seem to stop shaking; he was so totally confused but also shaken by what had just happened. <span> </span></p><p>Before he knew what was happening, Enjolras's arms were around him, his embrace tight and warm to counteract the cold, hollow feeling that was stuck in him. The fact that it was Enjolras, the man he'd definitely been pining after for the last few weeks, wasn't even on the top of his mind. He was just glad of the physical contact, of the human connection. <span> </span></p><p>"What the fuck was that thing?" He finally asked into Enjolras's shoulder, when his shaking had calmed down a bit and his heart rate had ceased to shudder through him so violently.<span> </span></p><p>They pulled apart, and Grantaire could see the hurt and anger at what had happened on his face. "It's called a Dementor. They feed off happiness, create darkness and despair wherever they go. They're easily one of the foulest, most horrendous magical creature to encounter, and they've sided with You-Know-Who. God, I wish we'd met a Death Eater rather than one of them, I'm so sorry Grantaire."<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras seemed genuinely distressed, but not just because of seeing and fighting off the Dementor, but that Grantaire had had to experience it. That level of emotion towards him from Enjolras came as a bit of a shock, but he decided that he didn't particularly want to question it.<span> </span></p><p>"It's okay," he said reflexively, even though he was clearly still shaken. He desperately wanted to change the subject though; he wasn't sure that he could stand Enjolras openly worrying about him. "What was the lion thing? It didn't look like your normal magic."<span> </span></p><p>"It's called a patronus charm. It's the only thing that can ward off a dementor and takes the form of an animal made from happy memories to counteract its darkness."<span> </span></p><p>"What memories did you use?" Maybe it was too personal a question, but Grantaire was curious; the lioness emanated such strength and light in contrast to the dementor and it astounded him that Enjolras had made that, had combated it with a spell and his own memories. It had a different feel to the spells he normally used, which required nothing more than a flick of the wand and some vaguely Latin sounding phrases. This charm had had an essence of Enjolras himself in it.<span> </span></p><p>"A memory of Les Amis in one of our meetings back at Beauxbatons. The first time we got the school to change one of the backwards rules about gender." Grantaire should probably have predicted it; of course the things that made him the happiest were his friends and social justice combined.<span> </span></p><p>But Enjolras carried on, looking a little embarrassed, which wasn't something Grantaire ever thought he would see on him. "And, well, this time I thought of you as well. Of quiet nights spent talking, getting to know you better. It all kind of mingled to produce the patronus."<span> </span></p><p>Shock didn't even begin to describe what Grantaire felt in that moment. "You're kidding, right?"<span> </span></p><p>"Why would I kid?" <span> </span></p><p>"I...I just don't see how your memories of camping in the middle of nowhere with only me for company could be happy for you. Could ever live up to the friends you have, to the literal magic that you live with." It was unfathomable to Grantaire; whilst spending this time with Enjolras was amazing for him, he'd always felt like a burden to Enjolras, someone who he was with only because it's slightly better than being alone.<span> </span></p><p>"Grantaire," said Enjolras, his voice more forceful now. "You're funny, opinionated, easy to talk to, and so different from me it's refreshing. Am I not allowed to enjoy your company all of a sudden?"<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras complimenting him was still such a foreign sensation; he didn't really know what to do with all of this praise. "What is this, compliment Grantaire day?" <span> </span></p><p>Perhaps sarcasm wasn't the way to proceed with this conversation, but it was the way which Grantaire knew best, to shield himself from having to confront the multitude of emotions he had surrounding Enjolras. <span> </span></p><p>"Why can't you accept it? That I like spending time with you?" Enjolras's voice was tinged with anger, the voice that he used when an argument was brewing. <span> </span></p><p>All of a sudden, Grantaire was really tired of this. He was always willing to rile up Enjolras, to see that passion flood out, but now he wished that this conversation would just end; he didn't think he could handle more compliments from Enjolras. It sent too much misplaced hope flooding into his besotted heart and made his already painful pining even more so. <span> </span></p><p>It was probably this odd mix of emotions that led to him snapping, "No, because why on Earth would you of all people do more than just put up with me? You're perfect; charismatic, eloquent, passionate, and you have fucking magic to top it all off. What could you possibly want with a <em>Muggle </em>like me, a drunk, a cynic, a man who barely believes in what you do and is only sticking around because he believes in you. Someone who--"<span> </span></p><p>He was cut off by Enjolras's hand encircling his arm, the warmth of the contact startling him. His grip was firm but soft, just like his words as he said, "Grantaire." Hearing his name in Enjolras's voice, steady and grounding, made Grantaire's heart begin to thump even faster than before. "R. <em>You are not worthless." </em><span> </span></p><p>His words had utter conviction behind them; Enjolras genuinely believed what he was saying. Grantaire was stumped, with no idea how to respond without saying something he might regret. <span> </span></p><p>He found he didn't have to offer a response, though. He'd barely opened his mouth when all of a sudden Enjolras's lips were on his, those soft lips that he'd been dreaming about kissing for weeks. His brain temporarily short-circuited; he couldn't quite believe that this was actually happening to him. His mind was racing, running away with the possibilities of what this meant, but his body had gone rigid, not because the kiss was at all bad or unwanted but because it was so surprising that he didn't know what to do.<span> </span></p><p>Enjolras pulled away quickly. "I'm sorry, I--" He sounded frazzled, which was unusual for Enjolras, the most put-together man Grantaire had ever met. "I just couldn't let you believe that I don't like you. I'm sorry if I overstepped my boundaries..."<span> </span></p><p>At this, Grantaire laughed at the absurdity of the whole situation, at the fact that Enjolras genuinely thought that the kiss was something that Grantaire hadn't wanted, when in fact it was entirely the opposite. "Enjolras," he said, and then because he didn't know what words could possibly be effective, he pulled Enjolras back towards him and kissed him properly this time.<span> </span></p><p>It was everything Grantaire had fantasized about and more, the way Enjolras's lips moved against his, hesitant at first but when his hands reached up to tangle in Enjolras's hair he felt Enjolras sigh against his mouth and deepen the kiss. It was undeniably clumsy and imperfect, and Grantaire could practically feel Enjolras's lack of experience, but it still felt electric, in a way that was probably far too cliché but true, in a way that Grantaire hadn't really experienced before with his short flings and quick, frenzied make out sessions while pissed. This was slower, and more grounding; he was hyperaware of every movement Enjolras made, of how his hands skimmed over Grantaire's back, his waist, finally settling on the back of his neck and sending floods of heat washing through him. It was absolutely too good to be true, but even the cynic within him couldn't deny that this was happening, that it was real, that the kiss was just as enthusiastic from Enjolras as it was from him. <span> </span></p><p>When they finally pulled apart, breathing heavily, Grantaire couldn't help but note Enjolras's kiss-swollen lips, his hair ruffled and out of place, his damn red coat askew on his shoulders. Something caved in his chest as he realised that somewhere along the line he'd begun to think of Enjolras as this unnattainable god-like figure, this perfect paradigm of justice and truth that sat above mere humans. But when Enjolras grinned at him, this illusion he'd been maintaining shattered completely as he understood that Enjolras was only human; he didn't deserve to be put on some sort of pedestal. He was human, he was imperfect, he made mistakes and got separated from his friends and cursed himself for it, he'd had a teenage crush on the Chosen One, he kissed clumsily but without caring about it because he was too enthusiastic. All this time, Grantaire had thought that he'd been falling for Enjolras because he'd idolised him, because he'd thought he was perfect, but as he stood so close to him that he could hear his heart racing, as his thumb brushed over Grantaire's cheek in an impossibly tender way, he realised that it was actually Enjolras's flaws that he should have been falling for. Because that made them a lot more equal, more level with each other, made Enjolras actually attainable for him.<span> </span></p><p>"I suppose you actually do like me. Just a little bit," he murmured, his lips still so close to Enjolras's that he was practically talking into them. It earnt him a laugh, that laugh that reminded him of pure gold, and hearing Enjolras laugh because of him made him smile a little.<span> </span></p><p>"I somehow have a suspicion that you like me a little bit too," he replied, smiling back. Like felt like such a tame word to describe the swirling mass of feelings that Enjolras evoked in him, but it would do for now.<span> </span></p><p>For now, Grantaire smiled back and said, "Whatever gave you that impression" before leaning forwards to kiss Enjolras again, still in absolute disbelief that that was now a thing which he could do. <span> </span></p><p>And despite the cold, foul presence of the Dementor still stuck somewhere in his head, this was the happiest Grantaire had felt in such a long time. He wondered, as Enjolras deepened their kiss, if this would be one of the memories he used the next time he produced a Patronus charm, because despite the complete lack of magic in his blood he couldn't imagine anything more powerful than this delirious feeling of something new and hopeful and raw blossoming in his chest with every kiss.<span> </span></p>
