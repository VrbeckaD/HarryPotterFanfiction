    <p>
  <span>Hattie made sure to pay attention to her surroundings, trying to determine the best way to get back to Gringotts once she finally escaped her escort. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hagrid was going on and on about how evil Slytherins were and how good Gryffindors were. It reminded her of Uncle Vernon when he watched the news and ranted about immigrants. He hated immigrants almost as much as he hated Hattie which was a lot. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr Hagrid, you look absolutely parched,” Hattie said, faking her concern, “are you sure you shouldn't get a drink somewhere. I am sure I will manage to get robes by myself.” She smiled politely. </span>
</p><p align="left">
  <span>“Yer right Hattie, all tha’ travelin’ took a lot outta me. I hate them Gringotts Carts” Hagrid agreed, “Might as well slip into the Leaky fer a pick-me-up kiddo. Be back to pick yeh up later.”</span>
</p><p align="left">
  <span>“See you later, Mr Hagrid.” Hattie waved and smiled. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She waited a few minutes until she was sure the giant wouldn't notice her walking back to Gringotts. She estimated she would have an hour or so before he returned and made sure to walk quickly but not so quick as to make people suspicious. </span>
</p><p align="left">
  <span>She had made sure to cover her scar. She didn't fancy being looked at like a zoo animal. Most people seemed content to treat her like one and she resented them for it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt the package she had taken from Hagrid was still in her pocket. She decided to look at it later when there were less people around. Perhaps the Goblins would be able to handle it too. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hattie stepped inside the bank and approached the Goblin who had taken her down to her vault before. </span>
</p><p align="left">
  <span>“Hello Mr. Griphook,” She greeted, “My apologies if I do not know the proper customs but I was raised among non-magical people. Muggles is the term I believe?” Hattie said, “I was here earlier with my escort from Hogwarts, my name is Harriet Potter and I have a few concerns.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A polite witch is not something we see everyday, Miss Potter nor one who remembers our names, I will escort you to your account manager.” Griphook smiled at the young girl. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hattie didn't understand why people were rude to Goblins. Around her she heard people barking out orders to the tellers and complain about needing to wait. Surely they understood being polite was important, especially to those who handled your finances? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, sir.” Hattie smiled back at him and followed him.</span><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Griphook led her to Ragnok’s office, he was the Head of the London Gringotts department and would be a tremendous help to the young witch. Something had been off with the Potter accounts for years and now they could finally prove it and defend their honour. Yes, they would enjoy taking back the money that was owed to young Miss Potter and the bank.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Griphook quickly spoke a few words to Ragnok in Gobblygook and smiled at Miss Potter. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“May your gold overflow and your enemies tremble in fear.” He said the traditional greeting and the girl repeated it.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Well, how may I help you today, Miss Potter?” Ragnok asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had an idea of what the girl would ask. Their seer had warned him to not visit the Moscow department today, something very important was going to happen.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I have two matters I would like to discuss,” Hattie said and placed the key and the package on the table in front of her. “Hagrid, my escort, was carrying both of these items when we left the bank. One is my vault key which I am uncertain he should carry and I have the feeling this package is not his either.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Ragnok opened the package and took out a glowing red stone. He placed it on the table. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“You are most certainly correct. This stone belongs to another Wizard whose vault we found emptied. Gringotts Wizarding Bank is most grateful and will offer any services free of charge today.” Ragnok stated, Magic glowed around them as she recognised the promise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicholas Flamel was going to be furious that Hagrid had the stone! Ragnok had no doubt Dumbledore was behind it and he would make sure to inform the alchemist of this. Gringotts didn't take kindly to thievery and deceiving, things they had discovered Albus Dumbledore excelled in. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“You are also correct that Hagrid should not be carrying your vault key. This is the task of you, your relatives and your magical guardian. Do you know who your magical guardian is?” The goblin asked.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Hattie shook her head, “I only learned I was a witch last night. A man named Dumbledore left me with my muggle relatives. I never even knew he or this world existed. I never met him, only Hagrid.” She replied a little sadly. She would have liked to know she wasn't just some kind of freak years ago. It would have helped her so much to know magic was real and that that was what was happening to her whenever something odd happened.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Dumbledore has claimed he is your guardian and taken money from your vaults. You did not consent to this, correct?” Ragnok asked, frowning a little.</span>
</p><p><span>“No, never.” Hattie confirmed, “I only heard of the man last night. Can we get the money back?”</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Most certainly,” Ragnok said with glee, “with interest, too. I propose we do a few tests on you, Dumbledore seems desperate to hide things regarding you. We should not let him.”</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Indeed,” Hattie agreed, “Which tests?”</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“An inheritance test, a creature test, an ability test, a medical test and a foreign magic test.” Ragnok said, “I propose we check for foreign magic first. I will summon the people needed.”</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Ragnok quickly send a message to Bill Weasley, the only wizard besides Hattie he liked and one of the most talented curse-breakers, healers Nurlok, Buglus and Kraglor, Fradluk of the creature department and Griphook.</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Soon they all arrived in his office. Ragnok waved his hand and made the room a little bigger so everyone had enough space.</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“We have very grave matters to attend to, I think and I proposed a series of tests to Miss Potter. She has proved to be valuable to the bank and our kind and will not be charged.” Ragnok explained, “I propose we do a medical test first and then a foreign magic test?”</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The healers and Bill agreed with this. Kraglor and Nurlok cast a spell which would list all the injuries and illnesses Hattie had had in her life. Soon there were 13 pieces of parchment filled with her medical history. Even though the Goblins were familiar with abuse and also war injuries, what they saw shocked them. No child should have to suffer as Hattie had. With each year things only seemed to be getting worse.</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Griphook cursed in gobblygook and frowned, “Even if I have to curse that disaster of a wizard,” He said angrily, “I will not let Hattie Potter return to those villains. Hattie Potter’s muggle relatives, the abusers are now enemies of my clan.”</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“And of mine.” The other Goblins echoed.</span><span></span><br/>
 <span></span><br/>
<span>Hattie teared up a little. No one had cared before but these wonderful Goblins did. It was the best feeling in the world. </span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Thank you,” She said in a soft voice, “I was scared of being returned to the Dursleys. They truly hate me.” She said sadly.</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hattie Potter's relatives, the muggles called Dursley are now enemies of Gringotts Wizarding Bank.” Ragnok stated.</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The Goblins and Bill decided to do all the tests first before deciding what to do next. So Ragnok asked Bill to do the foreign magic test.</span><span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span><span>Bill asked Hattie to drop three drops of blood on a piece of parchment and then whispered an ancient incantation. To his horror Hattie had several spells placed on her as well as potions in her system and binds on her core. Some of these things weren't even meant to be used together because they were incredibly dangerous. The Goblin Nation had records of children dying because of these binds. </span></p><p align="left"> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bill was horrified. They had used the most terrible things on Hattie and his mother had been a part of it. Ronald was mentioned too, but Bill hoped his youngest brother had no knowledge of it. He couldn't believe anyone could do something this vile willingly, but then again Dumbledore and his mother had. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He supposed in a way he could understand his mother's ability to be cruel. After all she had cast him aside and had tried to disinherit him when she discovered who he had been dating. It was only his father’s interference that allowed him to keep his name and heirdom but he had lost everything else. Right now he was ashamed to even share a name with that horrible woman! </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would someone do all that? Isn't he supposed to be the Headmaster? Why doesn't he want me to learn?” Hattie asked sadly, tears streaming down her face, “I don't even know these people, why would I hate them?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Bill got down on his knees in front of the little girl, “I don't know why this is happening, Hattie but I will find out and do everything to fix it.” He promised, “My mother at the very least is part of this plot and it shames me. More of my family members might be too.” He looked down. “I do not agree with them.” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Hattie surprised him by giving him a tight hug.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“We can't choose our families, mine was pretty terrible too,” She whispered, “All that matters is that we are better, kinder and smarter.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“You are a wise girl, Miss Potter.” Ragnok said, smiling a little. “Gringotts will do everything to uncover this plot and to keep you safe.” He vowed. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Thank you,” Hattie said. She was very glad she had listened to her gut and returned to the bank.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“We must first undo these binds,” Healer Nurlok said, sounding horrified “placing 7 binds on a child? Is that man insane?” She grumbled.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“It is a miracle young Miss Potter is alive.” Healer Kraglor said, “That amount of abuse and so many spells and binds placed on her? Most adult wizards and witches would not survive this.” He said angrily and cursed in several languages. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“He will pay for this,” Griphook said and everyone agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="left">
  <span>The Healers took Hattie into a seperate room and started to carefully take away the binds while healing some of her injuries at the same time. It was a delicate job and they knew that the young girl could die if they even made one mistake, the magic was that complex and volatile. They hated that Dumbledore and hoped their warriors would destroy him and leave nothing but dust behind. </span>
</p><p align="left">
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Meanwhile Griphook searched for the Potters’ will and discovered it had never been read. Again Albus Dumbledore was responsible. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“We will read the Will to the young girl when she is healed. We must also invite several other people.” Ragnok said after he unsealed it and read through the document. “Bill please contact Severus T. Snape, Lucius A.S.Malfoy and Narcissa D.I. Malfoy née Black and Remus J. Lupin for me.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Bill agreed and went to the floo that was in the other room.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Griphook please contact our brother Duelist and Scholar Filius Flitwick.” Ragnok ordered, “And send word to the King.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Goblins had a wizard to destroy and the King would surely be pleased with this development. </span>
