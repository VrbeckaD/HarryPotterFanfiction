    <p>~*~*~*~</p><p>Harry's Pov</p><p>Its cold and empty around him, yet groups of people surround them; he haven't felt this low and down in years. Not since the time of the Dursley's.</p><p>There amongst the crowd was a couple of people who milled through the crowd slowly making their way around checking out the surroundings, eyes glaring into dark corners. They were obviously searching for something, or someone.</p><p>~*~*~*~</p><p>Kol glared out into the crowd, he turned and spoke to the witch which had came with him, “Are you sure the boost of magic came from here,” he growled glaring daggers towards the brunette. <br/>“Yes, it came from here, keep your eyes open whoever it is feeling extremely strong emotions right now I can feel their power buzzing through the air.” she replied eyes going through the throng of humans buzzing around.</p><p>Kol glided through the distracted humans, music played in the background, people wearing various clothing, some clad in hardly any, New Orleans was known for the various people; creatures who cohabited in the city. </p><p>“I can taste the magic in the air, its delicious,” he said eyes finding a lone male, who seemed to notice him too, “Seems I may have found our culprit,” he said with a grin. </p><p>Walking towards the handsome stranger he sidled up until he was in front of him, “Can I help you?” the stranger said his accent was that of someone from England. </p><p>Grinning he leant forward and whispered into his ear, “I'd say so, you've put the witches here on their toes, an unknown powerful force finding themselves here in New Orleans, no notice of arrival or any fathom as to what you're doing here, Id definitely say you can help me young one.” Kol said as he grabbed hold of the emerald eyed man arm.</p><p>Flinching Harry smacked the hand away, a bitter look entered his face as he replied, “I'm anything but a 'young one', Vampire. So I'd watch your tone with me!.” he said venom covering his words.</p><p>Kol had this look enter his eyes, “Ooh a feisty one eh, I like it.” </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes, used to pig headed males thinking they were better than everyone, after all he had gone to school with Draco Malfoy the epitome of someone who thought the world revolved around them. </p><p>“There is nothing to like, what is it you want, last time I heard America was a free country, and as far as I'm aware I can come and go here, and anywhere else as I please.” Harry said removing his focus from the male to the Witch or as Harry would call her, 'Wiccan witch' who stood beside the vampire.</p><p>“What is a Wiccan witch doing with a vampire, I thought your kind hated them with a passion,” Harry said eyeing the witch and the vampire. </p><p>The girl laughed, “Any other Wiccan witch would agree with you but I'm different, I happen to get on with them, well most of them.” she said with a soft smile.</p><p>Harry focused back on the male, even though he seemed a bit full of himself Harry couldn't blame him, he seemed like a person who didn't get told 'No' very often. </p><p>“Don't be like that green eyes, we're basically the welcoming committee, here to help you know the rules of this city, no outright magic, no attacking any vampires, and last of all everyone supernatural is to notify the King of the city they've entered, it's time to meet the big boss of the city, my pain in the arse brother, let go.” Kol said with a slight eye roll holding onto Harry's arm and vamp speeding them out of the open and into the alley opposite. </p><p>“Follow me, we'll be there shortly,” Kol said as he eyed the male, “By the way I totally forgot to ask your name.” </p><p>“Harry; Harry Potter,” he replied with a glare, 'Great, I've ended up in a freaking supernatural pissing match. Awesome, just my luck' he thought to himself as he began to follow the black haired vampire.</p><p>The vampire spluttered, “You're kidding me right? The kid whose been fighting the old Voldemort guy back in England? What the heck are you doing over in these neck of the woods?” he asked eyeing him suspiciously. </p><p>Harry eyed him up, he hadn't thought that the Wizarding worlds business would have reached the Wiccan community, they tended to keep themselves to themselves as the Wizarding community liked to think themselves somewhat better than Wiccans, Harry personally had no such reservations. </p><p>“Yep, that would be me. A friend gave me some tickets to get a way for a while, she said it would do me good. That it would be the best idea I'd ever had. I'm starting to think she was joshing with me.” he said as he came upon a pub with jazz music playing in the background. </p><p>The vampire opened up the door, ushering him inside; once in there the crowd which congregated near the door moved aside as soon as they spotted the vampire who had led Harry in. </p><p>A handsome blonde at the bar swerved himself around to face his brother, “Who have you bought me to meet tonight brother?” he asked as he took in the raven haired male following Kol. </p><p>Kol turned smirking towards his older brother, “This here happens to be Harry Potter dear brother,” he replied </p><p>Klaus' eyes turned gold a growl escaping his lips, “And what does the saviour of the Wizarding world want in my city?” he asked eyeing the wizard suspiciously. </p><p>“Like I told your brother, a friend bought me tickets to visit the city, and as I told him this here is as far as I know a free country where I can visit wherever the hell I want. I'm not here to cause trouble, I'm simply visiting a city I haven't been to before. I'll not be bullied out of a city I wish to visit, not even by you; whoever you may be.” he said as he stared the supposed King down, neither of their eyes leaving the others. </p><p>The crowd seemed to wince, respected breaths could be heard to suck in, the people near Harry practically sprinted away, lest they be in the firing range of Klaus' anger. </p><p>Klaus bared his teeth, “you dare come into my city, speak to me with such disrespect, do you not know who I am?” he said glaring at the younger male.</p><p>“No, should I your majesty.” Harry replied returning the heated glare.</p><p>Kol seemed to float between the two of them, sensing the oncoming argument. “Lets all just relax here, this here is Niklaus Mikaelson the one and only Original Hybrid, I myself am Kol Mikaelson also an Original Vampire. We are the Original Vampires who created all others.” he said taking in the surprise on the young ones face.</p><p>Harry seemed to blanch, “Well, I apologise, but as I said I'm only here for a while, just taking in the sites. I'll stay out of your way, and out of trouble. Well I will try, trouble tends to find me wherever I go.” he said with a slight laugh at the end. </p><p>Neither vampire seemed to find him funny, both were wary of the young wizard, they had heard the stories; stories which had reached their ears was of a young powerful wizard who killed one of the most evil wizards to have walked the earth. </p><p>“Anyway I will take this as my leave, I have places to go, people to see. I'll heed your rules.” Harry said as he made a move to leave the crowded pub. </p><p>Klaus looked him up and down, looking like he wanted to speak again but Kol interrupted him, “We'll be seeing you then Harry, enjoy New Orleans.” </p><p>Harry took that as his queue and left the building, letting out a whoosh of air he shook his head. Why did he have to always find trouble, and why did it always have to follow him. Halfway around the world and he'd already pissed off the wrong people. </p><p>He made his way to his hotel, which wasn't too far from the pub, he walked in smiled at the lady at the front desk wished her goodnight and went to his room where he laid in bed watching films until he was ready to sleep. Today had been eventful for sure.</p><p> </p><p>~*~*~*~**~</p><p>thank you for reading.
