    <p>Hey! Welcome! This is basically just an acclamation of loads of fics and works I’ve worked on but have no clue what to do with now. I hope they can provide entertainment, inspiration, or tips on how to write and how not to write lmao.</p><ul>
<li>I’m putting organization info here, to help people navigate (and I feel like being hyper-organized with this idk why lol)</li>
</ul><p>The works are sorted into three categories so far which you’ll see in the chapter index!</p><p>——&gt; Fan-Fictions, Original Works, and Academic Writing/ Misc. </p><ol>
<li>If you click on these chapters you’ll see a list of the works in that section, their creation dates, and their word counts (These are also specified in individual chapters)</li>
<li>The works are by date; newest to oldest</li>
<li>Please the creation date in mind in regards to the quality lmao</li>
</ol><ul>
<li>I know I probably won’t get many hits due to the essence of this work, it’s not a story, and has more original content than fan-fictions. However, if you do come across this Kudos are really nice. And comments, especially, mean the world to me! Constructive criticism is always, always welcome</li>
</ul><p>Alright that’s all! Thank you, and enjoy~</p>
