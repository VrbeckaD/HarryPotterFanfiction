</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tina was not having a good day. She hadn’t had a good day in months, really, but this day was just that little more dreadful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It started in the morning, when she woke up and had to run to the bathroom to throw up. Granted, she felt better after it, but that didn’t change the fact that she felt thoroughly exhausted. Queenie suggested she’d take a day off, but Tina couldn’t do that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So she went to work, where she skipped her usual coffee in fear of getting sick again. The black tea they stocked tasted like tar on her tongue, but she made it drinkable by adding an indecent amount of sugar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she made it to her desk, Graves was already there. He was usually there, most mornings, ever since he came back to work and Tina had been reinstated as an Auror. While she was very glad for both of those things, that morning Graves tasked her with doing some research for a low-level case they had. She didn’t mind research, but it was a terribly boring subject.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, she did it. She spent the entire day between her desk and the Archive or Library, reading, taking notes, writing a report that could have easily been submitted as a paper, if she were still in school.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grindelwald had escaped their custody four months ago and they had no leads on him. It was terribly frustrating.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sting of the lack of letters on her desk hurt every day, but for some reason, it was worse at that moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie brought her lunch, some toast and crackers which, thankfully, didn’t upset her stomach. She also let Tina know when she left work, but of course Tina stayed back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took another two hours for her to finish her report, and just as she cracked her bones and started thinking longingly about her bed, Graves appeared by her desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Oh, good, you’re still here.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina sighed. ‘I just finished the report for you, sir.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Forget about it.’, he waved a hand. ‘President Picquery is waiting for us.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her eyes grew wide at that, even as her feet started moving, following Graves down the hallway to the elevator.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I don’t know why.’, he said next. ‘I guess we’ll find out soon.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were silent for a while, but once they got on the elevator, Graves finally took a good look at her, and he frowned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Are you alright?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina startled, but only slightly. He was a good man, Graves, and in the past few months of working together, she got to know him, a little. The real him, not Grindelwald in a mask. So she knew that he was rough in his demeanor, a strong man, but a caring one, too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Tina smiled at him. ‘Tired, sir. I had a bit of a rough start this morning.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded and gently grabbed her elbow. ‘I’m sorry to prolong your day, but it’s probably important, if Picquery called for us at such a late hour.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took a deep breath and strengthened her back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Atta girl.’, Graves said under his breath, smirking slightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina couldn’t help but smile back.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She faltered really badly when she got into Picquery’s office, because the President was not the only person in there. Her heart dropped to the floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta Lestrange was wearing bright red and clinging to the arm of a man. Tina had never met this man, but it took barely a second to realize that he was Newt’s brother. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she managed to pick up her heart, Picquery was already making introductions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘This is Theseus Scamander, Head Auror for the Ministry of Magic, and his fianc</span>
  <span>ée</span>
  <span>, Leta Lestrange.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina’s heart dropped again, but only Graves realized it, throwing her a fleeting look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She recovered, smiled politely even in her obvious confusion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Grindelwald is in Europe’, Picquery said without any finesse, ‘and Mister Scamander is in charge of the investigation.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You’re the one who interacted with him the most, Miss Goldstein.’, Theseus said in a surprisingly gravelly voice. ‘If you are willing, I would like to pick your brain about it. As part of my investigation, of course.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That… sounded weird, to Tina’s ears. That last sentence, there was something off about it. She didn’t mention it, and it didn’t take long for Picquery to politely throw them out of her office. Once in the hallway, Theseus asked if there was a pub they could meet up at after they checked into their hotel, to talk in a more casual manner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina bit her lip to keep herself from laughing. She felt oddly detached from what this meeting meant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘We don’t have… pubs in America, Mister Scamander.’, Graves said slowly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘We have speakeasies, and they’re illegal.’, Tina supplied gently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘And quite frankly’, Graves pulled a face, ‘you’d be skinned alive as soon as you step foot into a magical speakeasy.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was clear that neither Theseus nor Leta understood this. With a deep sigh, Tina ended up saying something she was sure she will regret later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Why don’t you all come over for a late dinner? It’s highly unprofessional’, she winced at Graves, ‘I know, but we’ll be able to talk freely and while our home isn’t much, my sister is a very good cook.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘She doesn’t have enough clearance.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina winced after Graves said it, but he smirked, a little. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I was joking, Goldstein. Dinner sounds lovely.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She quickly gave her address and they settled on meeting an hour from then, and she didn’t waste any more time, Apparating as close to her building as she could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took ten full minutes to convince Mrs. Esposito that while there will be men in the apartment, one of them was engaged and the other was her direct superior, so there was no chance of anything uncouth happening. Mrs. Esposito relented, eventually, and promised to stay out of the way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie took one long look at Tina, her eyes growing wider with every passed second, and then, in a very lowered voice, said that they needed more potatoes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was a saviour, because she took charge of cooking and tidying up, as Tina took a hot bath and spent an alarming amount of minutes fretting in front of her dresser. In the end she wore a pair of her work pants and a more casual shirt, but she only felt good about it when Graves came in not wearing a full suit, but a loose shirt with no vest.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first thing Tina noticed when she opened the door was that Leta was wearing a dark blue dress that looked very similar to one that Queenie owned. The second thing she saw was a bit of red sand on the knees of Theseus’ pants.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The third thing she noticed took her breath away, because it was Newt’s suitcase.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Oh no.’, Queenie’s distressed voice came from behind Tina. ‘What happened to Newt?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus’ head snapped to her. ‘Why would you ask me that?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘There’s no way he would have given you his creatures if everything was alright.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus didn’t deny it, looking down at the case in his hand and tightening his fist around the handle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘While that is one of the reasons for our presence in New York’, Leta said gently, ‘it can wait until after dinner. I must admit I’m famished.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That sprung everyone into movement, Tina letting them inside of the apartment, Queenie setting the table, Graves helping Theseus with the case. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina took a deep breath before putting a polite smile on her face. She asked the guests to call her Tina, they weren’t at work, and she did her very best to act like a good host.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They spent dinner talking about work, specifically about the differences between the Ministry of Magic and MACUSA. It was an interesting topic to Tina, and she listened avidly to everything Theseus had to say, but she still noticed that Leta had nothing to add to the conversation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She only spoke once, and it was to ask Tina and Queenie how they met Newt. Neither of them said anything, for a while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Tina arrested him.’, Graves supplied around a smile. ‘Twice.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta and Theseus’ faces were quite funny, but not enough to prompt Tina to start talking. So Queenie took over the story, managing to make it sound like Jacob had a much smaller part than he actually did, probably for Graves’ sake. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the end of it, Theseus was frowining and Leta was smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘That does sound terribly like Newt.’, she admitted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Does it?’, her fianc</span>
  <span>é </span>
  <span>shook his head. ‘Because fighting a vicious wizard head on does not sound like my brother, at all.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie tutted loudly, making every head turn to her. ‘It’s just that Newt didn’t… he wasn’t fighting Grindelwald, he was trying to save Credence. A hurt, misjudged young boy. Doesn’t that sound </span>
  <em>
    <span>exactly </span>
  </em>
  <span>like something Newt would do?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta and Theseus shared a loaded look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’ll make you some tea.’, Queenie got up from the table. ‘And us some coffee.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a deep breath, Tina turned to Theseus. ‘What happened to Newt?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their eyes met, and she didn’t like the emotions she saw flashing in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Tina’, he sighed. ‘I don’t actually know, but I think Grindelwald is involved.’</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus really was in New York as part of his investigation, the search for Grindelwald. As far as his Minister and Picquery knew, he was to meet with Aurors Graves and Goldstein and interrogate them about everything they knew about the dark wizard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was not the only reason he was there, though.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘My relationship with my younger brother has never been an exceptionally good one, but it has always been… civil.’ His hand was in Leta’s, as he spoke, but he didn’t meet anyone’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Throughout his travels, he always sent me letters, at least twice a month. Sometimes it was a page filled with useless details about some rare animal and doodles in the corner, other times it was just two words: still alive.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dread pulled at Tina’s stomach, cold and harsh, she felt like she was going to throw up again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘In the past four months, there have been no more doodles. And as of two months ago, there have been no more letters and I woke up with the case in my living room. I’m beyond worried.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the silence that followed, Tina managed to look up at her sister, who was already watching her with tears in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I told you’, Queenie whispered gently, ‘there had to be a good reason for him to stop writing.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves was evidently surprised by this, as was Leta. Theseus wasn’t, instead he had a sort of pleading look in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘So he has been in contact with you?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina nodded, trying to find her words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I wasn’t sure’, Theseus said gently, ‘but he has mentioned your name several times in his letters, which is something that hasn’t happened since…’, his eyes moved to Leta.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Since our school years.’, she finished the thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina took a deep breath and tried her best to stop her hands from shaking, holding them tightly together under the table. Queenie wordlessly handed her a cup of hot coffee, thus giving her something to focus on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Newt and I have been writing since he left New York. A few times a week if he was in London, a lot less if he was traveling. His letters stopped a week after Grindelwald escaped.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus nodded. ‘Last I heard of him, he was in Morocco.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina shook her head. ‘He went to Paris, after that. In his last letter, he said he found something, but... I don’t know what. He didn’t say.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘May I… I know it’s personal, Tina, but may we see this last letter?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was personal, terribly so. It was the most emotional letter Newt had ever sent her. But he was Theseus’ brother, and she could see the concern in the man’s eyes. If Newt was missing, they had to find him, and maybe she had missed something. So she nodded and with a quick </span>
  <em>
    <span>Accio</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she handed Theseus the letter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew it by heart, but she still listened to Theseus read it out loud. It felt… very wrong.</span>
</p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Dear Tina,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I am writing to you from a boat I have been stuck on the past few days. In just a few hours it shall port in Marseille and from then on, I shall be off to Paris. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>France is a country you would like, I think. Paris has the animated, crowded feeling of New York that you unexplainably enjoy, while the smaller towns in the countryside, they have the calmness and beauty that you crave. There’s also the good wine, fine food and delicious pastries. I really do think you’d enjoy it, and I have to admit I wish you’d be here to experience it.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Do you ever get tired of me writing that? Because I’m sure I have written it in every country I have been to since New York. Can you blame me? I don’t think you can, our adventure has been quite extraordinary. While the work Dumbledore has me doing is exciting and important, I can’t help but think it would be even better with you by my side.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Terribly sorry, Tina, I always get sentimental while I’m at sea. The loneliness feels stronger here. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>‘But you’re not alone!’, you’re probably thinking, and you are right. Dougal is sitting on a chair next to mine, one hand curled around my arm. The niffler (which I most definitely will </span>
    </em>
    <em>
      <span>not </span>
    </em>
    <em>
      <span>name neither Butch, nor Cassidy, but I appreciate your input) is playing with my second best cufflinks by my feet, Pickett has my right wrist in a vicious grip (excuse the poor penmanship, it is all his fault) and the mooncalves are trying to grab my attention by performing a complicated dance.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>You are right, dear Tina, I am not alone. But that doesn’t mean I don’t miss my friends. And I miss you the most in moments like this one, when my case is calm (as can be) and settled (by our usual standards), and Dougal longs for a hug from Jacob, the niffler longs for Queenie’s shiny earrings, Pickett longs for a nap on your shoulder, and I long for all of it. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I wish I could be able to visit you sooner. I’d be in New York tomorrow, if I could. But I have found something in Paris, something that is far more important than my loneliness, or the promise I had made. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I’m terribly sorry about it, but my book will be published in the upcoming week. I am a horrible man, for breaking your trust and my promise, but I will not be able to give it to you in person. You will receive it, expect a delivery on your desk, but I can’t be there. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I wish I could, my dear Tina. My heart yearns it something horrible. But what I’m to do in Paris, it is far greater than you or I, than any creature that walks this earth, that any thought or feeling to exist, no matter how strong.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Please, don’t think you are not important to me. That is as far from the truth as I am from you. You will understand, one day, why it had to be this way. One day, I shall be able to tell you everything, if you’ll be inclined to listen. I hope you will.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I hope we will see eachother soon. I hope you will still smile at me.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Pickett asked who I was writing to, and as soon as I said your name, he waved his hands and made noises that sound like a child’s kiss. I think it means he sends his love. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>In the past minutes, Dougal has been gently running his fingers over the pages I have already written. I think it means he misses you.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>As always, I find myself feeling the same things as my creatures are. They’ve always been better at expressing it.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Be well, my dear friend. Stay safe. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Yours, </span>
    </em>
    <em>
      <span>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </em>
    <em>
      <span>Newt</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>There was a sketch near his signature, a doodle, as Theseus called it, of Newt’s hand, holding a quill, with Pickett wrapped tightly around his wrist. The bowtruckle had his lips pursed, like in a kiss, and Newt’s fingers had small bite marks on them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina felt like crying, but she didn’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta was looking at her with shock clearly written on her face, Graves was looking at her in understanding, and Theseus was looking at her with incredulity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I never thought Newt was capable of so much…’, he didn’t finish that thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You were the only one, dear.’, Leta smiled, a little, before straightening her shoulders. ‘Whatever he found in Paris, it’s Dumbledore’s doing.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I know he is a teacher at your school’, Graves started, ‘but what does he have to do with Newt? Or Grindelwald, for that matter?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus frowned, deeply. ‘Everyone knows-’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Not here, we don’t.’, Queenie interrupted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘We know Newt was expelled from school and that Dumbledore argued against it.’, Tina said, remembering Newt’s file.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus nodded. ‘Newt was Dumbledore’s favorite. Everyone else in school thought my brother was odd and… not up to par with our last name. Dumbledore saw something else in him, and their relationship continued in an amicable manner after Newt left Hogwarts.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie was glaring at Leta, and Tina was trying her damn hardest not to do the same. The woman took it in stride, very pointedly grabbing a hold of her fianc</span>
  <span>é</span>
  <span>’s hand, again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘And as for Dumbledore and Grindelwald’, Theseus went on, ‘I know they were friends, in their younger years. And I know that something horrible happened, something nobody really knows, but it has shattered their relationship and sent them on two very different paths.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘So it’s safe to say that Dumbledore would not act against the person who used to be his friend.’, Graves used a voice that Tina knew well from their debriefs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus nodded. ‘I think so. And I think he trusts my brother enough to send him after Grindelwald.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘And the idiot didn’t even hesitate before doing whatever Dumbledore said.’ Leta’s voice was just on the wrong side of harsh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘We don’t use those type of words in this house, Miss Lestrange.’, Tina said gruffly. ‘Especially in relation to people who have saved us before.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew what happened with Leta and Newt in school. He had told her, briefly in one of his letters, that she was his only friend so he felt complied to take the fall for her, and that it was the last he had heard of her. Which brought another question to mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Does he know about…’, Queenie asked before Tina could, pointing between Leta and Theseus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was the one to nod. ‘Rest assured, he wasn’t heartbroken. Just scared that I will get </span>
  <em>
    <span>my</span>
  </em>
  <span> heart broken.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta took this easily, smiling fondly at him and pushing their shoulders together. There was love in her eyes, but Tina couldn’t help but think about why Newt didn’t tell her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘As riveting as this is’, Graves deadpanned, ‘we have bigger issues at hand.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Yes.’, Theseus squared his shoulders. ‘It’s clear that the next step is to talk to Dumbledore. If you would be inclined to help me, I will be in your debt.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You want them to go with you to London, maybe Paris.’, Queenie said in the silence that followed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘That won’t be possible.’, Graves sighed. ‘As much as we’d want to, we can’t both leave, Picquery wouldn’t allow it.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Then you go.’, Tina was quick to say. ‘We can handle things for a couple of days.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You could’, he tilted his head at her, ‘but in the event Grindelwald resurfaces, things would be far more troublesome.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She agreed with him, unfortunately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘So you’ll go.’, Graves shocked her. He raised an eyebrow. ‘You know Mister Scamander, and you know Grindelwald. Picquery will argue against it, but she’s more likely to let an Auror go, than the Head of Security. And she wants relationships with the Ministry to be held strongly, in times like these.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina’s eyes turned to Queenie, who was already nodding. ‘Go, I’ll be fine. I’ll go stay with someone else while you’re gone.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jacob, she meant Jacob. It made Tina feel slightly better.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘It’s settled then.’, Graves said strongly. ‘I’ll arrange a Portkey for the three of you, probably tomorrow evening.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a few strong nods, the night was over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina wanted desperately to go inside of the suitcase, but she didn’t fight the strength to ask Theseus for it. He was polite as he left, thanking them for their hospitality and their will to help, and he held Leta’s hand through everything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After they Apparated away, Graves lingered, politely asked for another cup of coffee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I think it’s time for us to be honest with each other’, his eyes skipped from Tina to Queenie, before landing on the younger sister. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I know you’re a Legilimens, and I know that Jacob Kowalski remembers what happened.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The world rushed from underneath Tina’s feet, and she tightly grabbed her sister’s hand, as Queenie started talking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Stop.’, Graves smiled gently at her. ‘I’m not gonna rat you out. As Tina said, we’re not at work here.’ He tilted his head. ‘If you think it’s worth it, putting yourself in such danger, then this Kowalski has to be something else.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘He is, Mister Graves.’, Queenie sniffed. ‘He really is.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Your secrets are safe with me.’, the man promised. ‘Just be careful, Queenie. Don’t get sloppy, cause not everyone at work is as understanding as I am.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie nodded, thanking him from the bottom of her heart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then Graves turned to Tina. ‘I worry that your feelings for the younger Mister Scamander are going to cloud your judgement.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her first instinct was to deny it. But in that moment, she trusted Graves. She trusted him with Queenie’s safety, and she trusted him with this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘They won’t cloud my judgement, but they will provide motivation.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves hummed. ‘Motivation to do what?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Find Newt.’, she said quickly. ‘Hex Grindelwald to the Moon and back.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man smirked at that, seemingly proud. He got up from the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Don’t bother coming into work tomorrow, Tina. Rest, pack, prepare.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’ll make sure she does.’, Queenie smiled. ‘I have the day off anyway.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Thank you for dinner, it was pretty darn good.’, Graves grinned at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You’re welcome here anytime, Mister Graves.’, was Queenie’s prompt response. ‘You’re far nicer than everyone gives you credit for.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Best not to start that rumor’, he chuckled. ‘I have a reputation to maintain.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned to Tina, again. ‘I’ll send an owl after I arrange the Portkey. Don’t get stupid, stay safe, and go find your fella.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘He's not my-’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves cut her off with a snort, making her cheeks instantly turn red. He winked at her before he Apparated away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina turned to Queenie, a mess of emotions running through her heart, a jumble of thoughts running through her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Let’s pack.’, Queenie said gently. ‘We might need to sow some hoods on your jackets.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, the English rain. Tina was not looking forward to that, but she was more than willing to suffer through it for Newt. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina did not close one eye that night. Instead, she read Newt’s letters, all of them, twice. And when sleep still didn’t come to her, she picked up her favorite spellbook and went through it quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie woke up and fussed over her, but she also made her breakfast and helped her pack a bag. It was only after that was done, that Tina fell asleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She slept for a few hours, without any nightmares or dreams, thankfully enough, and Queenie woke her up with enough time to eat a sandwich and take a bath before she had to leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’ll be sleeping at Jacob’s’, Queenie said with tears in her eyes, ‘so you either write to me at the office, or you send an owl there.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina nodded, hoping she won’t spend enough time in Europe to account for letters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I hope so too’, Queenie said, ‘but just in case. I hope you find him quickly.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina couldn’t really answer that, the need to start crying overlapping everything. So she didn’t say anything, opting for hugging her sister tightly. She took Queenie’s whisper of ‘Stay safe.’ with a shiver, but a strong nod. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without another word, she Apparated away.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Traveling by Portkey across the ocean was truly horrible, and had they not landed somewhere outside, Tina was sure she would have thrown up. But they were outside, and the fresh air helped. Theseus whispered a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lumos </span>
  </em>
  <span>and the fact that both he and Lena were looking a little pale, it made Tina feel slightly better. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was already night in England, close to 10 o’clock, so Tina couldn’t see much around her. She saw some small lights, in the distance, but not enough to distinguish what they were.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was the direction they headed towards, and when Tina was able to make out the outline of the ridiculously large mansion, she understood that they were on the Scamander estate, where Newt and Theseus grew up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tried to get herself out of the situation, Tina did argue that she had no problem with renting a room at the Leaky Cauldron (Newt had mentioned it before). Theseus wouldn’t have it, saying that Newt would hex him if he found out he let Tina sleep there and Leta gently added that the house was ridiculously large for just two people, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Tina went, looking curiously around the surprisingly luxurious house, picturing a boy with Newt’s eyes and hair running around, trekking mud from the hippogriff stables. Her heart hurt, so she excused herself early in the night, blaming it on time zone sickness. Both of her hosts saw right through her, but let her be.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She fell asleep quickly, even though she felt very out of place in the room, but Tina had a restless sleep, filled with nightmares. She didn’t remember them, exactly, but she remembered Newt screaming her name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which is why she almost hexed the house elf that woke her up in the morning. It was late, the elf said, almost 10 AM, and ‘Master Theseus and his Missus are waiting for you with breakfast’.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina got dressed quickly and all but started crying when she saw that there was coffee waiting for her on the table. They were quiet while they ate, but both Lena and Theseus were throwing her questioning looks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So once she finished eating, she poured herself another cup of coffee, and asked them, point blank, what they wanted to know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus tried to say something, but thought better of it and closed his mouth with a snap, so Leta took over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘It’s just that Newt has never… in all the time I’ve known him -’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘And all the time I’ve known him’, Theseus interrupted, ‘which is fairly longer.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘He’s never shown this much interest in a woman.’, Leta said gently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Never.’, Theseus nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite her blush and the way her heart started beating faster, Tina didn’t back down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘How would you know?’, she asked him, before turning to Leta. ‘Would you? Did you even see how he cared for you?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta looked away, clearly ashamed, so Tina turned to look back at Theseus. There was regret in his eyes, but more than that, there was confusion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina shrugged. ‘I don’t know why Newt… I don’t even know exactly how he… feels.’ Her voice shook too much, but she pushed through. ‘You just met me, you don’t know me very well, you’re worried about your brother, I know. But what you’re asking… it doesn’t matter now. Newt’s my friend and catching Grindelwald is my job. You can trust me to do both.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘This was never a question of trust.’, Theseus smiled, a little. ‘I was just curious of what you saw in my socially awkward baby brother that loves dangerous animals.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina rolled her eyes. ‘Speaking of…’, she bit her lip. ‘Did you feed the animals this morning?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta grinned, shoving at Theseus’ elbow. ‘Told you!’, she all but sang, gleefully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus was smiling, too. ‘She figured you’d want to check up on them, so I waited.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina got up very quickly.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dougal was waiting for them in the shed, and he wasted no time in demanding a hug from Tina. She picked him up, settled him on her hip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You miss him, huh?’, she asked softly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dougal nodded, pushing his head to her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘All the animals, they’re very… subdued.’, Theseus said. ‘Even the niffler’s behaving himself.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina sighed, making her way through the space, ignoring Theseus as he fed the animals, ignored the way how this place had been a happy one, for her, but now it brought her pain. And longing, so much longing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her feet led her to the occamy nest, where the animals were unnaturally still. ‘They miss their mommy.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Mommy?’, Theseus snorted, coming to her side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned to him with a small smile. ‘His word, not mine.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘No, no, it fits. It definitely fits.’, he kept on snickering.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Where’s Pickett?’, she asked next.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus led the way, over to Frank’s enclosure. It still looked like a desert, even if it had been months since the thunderbird has been in the case. That is where Pickett made a little nest for himself, out of small branches and a few leaves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’ve tried to get him back to his tree, but he wouldn’t have it.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina felt tears pricking at her eyes, especially when Dougal got himself out of her hold, and sat down next to Pickett’s nest, easily picking him up in his furry hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bowtruckle was making noises that were very distressed, and they broke Tina’s heart, really they did. She wiped away at her face, as she felt Theseus putting a comforting hand on her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dougal extended his hands, presenting Pickett like a prise to her. She knelt in front of the animals, moved to pet the bowtruckle. He was quicker, jumping on her hand, holding on strongly. She didn’t need to speak his language to understand what he meant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I can’t take you with me, Pickett. It might be dangerous and -’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He interrupted her with a series of very annoyed chirps, and a strong shaking of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Pickett’, Tina sighed, ‘he’ll never forgive me if something happens to you.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dougal’s eyes flashed then, a bright blue that let them know he was seeing probabilities. After his eyes turned back to normal, he made a soft cooing sound and then grabbed the hand Tina had Pickett in, pushing it, gently, to her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Well you gotta take him now.’, Theseus said. Tina couldn’t see him, but she knew he was smirking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Alright, Pickett, you’re coming. But you will behave!’, she tried her best to be stern.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bowtruckle nodded fiercely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Speaking of, Professor Dumbledore is waiting for us before lunch.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded, straightening up and placing Pickett in her breast pocket, extending a hand to Dougal. ‘Where are we meeting him?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Hogwarts, of course.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina yelped, she couldn’t help herself. Theseus laughed very loudly.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta didn’t join them. She didn’t say why, and Tina didn’t ask.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus Apparated them on a stone bridge that led to the castle. It was a giant castle, in the middle of nowhere, and it completely took Tina’s breath away. She stopped walking, looking up at the castle with big eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Yeah.’, Theseus whispered by her side. ‘It does that. Wait till you see the inside.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That got Tina moving. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a woman waiting for them at the gates, who didn’t introduce herself as much as pulled them hurriedly inside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Professor Dumbledore is just finishing up a class. You still remember the way to his office, don’t you, Mister Scamander?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t wait for an answer before rushing away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus thought this was normal behaviour, so with a gentle hand on her elbow, he guided Tina through the castle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was… so very different from Ilvermorny. The portraits on the walls talked, the staircases moved, the four houses were in a competition and the hourglasses kept points. The only reason why Tina did not scream when faced with a poltergeist was because Newt had talked, in one of his letters, about Nearly Headless Nick. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She thought about Newt after that, about how he felt when he had to roam these halls. About all the riddles he had to decipher to get into the Hufflepuff common room, about the hours he spent hidden in the Forbidden Forest, flying on the Quidditch field.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Were you in Hufflepuff?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus turned to look at her, not really masking his surprise. ‘No, all the Scamander's have been Ravenclaws. Until Newt, that is.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course he had been the first one to be different. In more than one way, it seemed. She knew it couldn’t have been easy for him, but Tina still smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They didn’t wait too long for Dumbledore, who was quick to open his office and usher them inside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina was vaguely aware of him and Theseus shaking hands, but she couldn’t really take her eyes away from a corner of the office, where a gold perch stood, and the most beautiful creature she had ever seen was sleeping on it. Its feathers were bright red, speckled with gold to match its beak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Is that a phoenix?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was only when her question was met with silence that she realized how rude she was being.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’m so sorry, Professor.’, she looked to him. ‘I just…’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she didn’t go on, Dumbledore raised an amused eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Professor, this is Miss Tina Goldstein, an Auror with MACUSA.’, Theseus introduced her. ‘Quite evidently, she’s also a friend of my brother’s.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘It’s a pleasure to meet you, Miss Goldstein.’, he politely shook her hand. ‘And to answer your question, yes, that is a phoenix. His name is Fawkes and he was a recent gift from Newt.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Of course it was.’, Theseus grumbled. ‘There have only been a handful of domesticated phoenix birds in England’s history, so of course my brother would gift one to you.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That amused Dumbledore terribly. He went behind his desk and asked them to sit down in front of it, and with a swift twirl of his wand, a tray with tea and biscuits appeared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘While I am very glad to see you, Theseus’, the professor smiled, ‘I assume you’re here on business, and because of Miss Goldstein’s presence, I assume that business is Grindelwald.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Yes and no.’, Theseus said slowly. ‘Newt is missing, unless you have been in contact with him the past two months.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore pursed his lips, but shook his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Last we heard from him, he was in Paris working on something for you.’, Theseus tone was harsh. ‘His letters stopped when Grindelwald escaped and I woke up with the case in my living room. So yes, professor, this is about him. I won’t disrespect you by asking about your relationship with Grindelwald, I’ve read enough in the Daily Prophet. But no, this isn’t really about Grindelwald. My priority is finding my brother.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a few moments, of the two men glaring at each other, before Dumbledore turned to look at Tina with a very hesitant expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She swallowed before she spoke. ‘Catching Grindelwald is my job, Professor. But Newt is my friend.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore blinked, twice. Then he frowned at her. ‘Newt doesn’t usually have those.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An angry chirp could be heard from Tina’s breast pocket, Pickett peeking out just long enough to stick his tongue out at a very surprised Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘He has now.’, Tina smiled. ‘And we all want to get him back. So if you know anything that might help us find him, please start talking knowing that whatever information you give us will not leave this room.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore sighed, deeply. ‘After what happened in New York, it seems like Grindelwald is in search of Obscurials. I caught talk of one in Paris, and I caught rumors of Grindelwald heading there.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina drowned her tea, wishing there was something stronger in the cup. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Do you know where in Paris?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore took a deep breath, refilled her tea cup, and started talking about a circus of oddities.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus took the long way around to the castle entrance, just so Tina could sneak a peek at the Great Hall. The ceiling truly was something magnificent and she spent the rest of the walk thinking about how would that charm work. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I need to sent an owl to the Ministry, arrange for a Portkey to Paris.’, Theseus was thinking out loud. ‘I could Apparate myself, but bringing you along would drain me too much. It shouldn’t be a problem, but the sooner we can leave will probably be tomorrow morning.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina sighed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I don’t like it either’, Theseus amended, ‘but at least we have something to go on. Something more than just knowing that Newt’s missing.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded, pulling her jacket closer to her body. It was a little chilly outside, the Scottish wind harsh against her skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I need a drink.’, she mumbled, feeling only mildly embarrassed about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Me too.’, Theseus snorted. ‘Leta will still be out, so I won’t feel bad for stopping at the Three Broomsticks.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘That’s in… Hogsmeade, right?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus smirked and nodded. ‘We could go to Diagon Alley as well, if you’d prefer.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t control her excited reaction. It made Theseus laugh under his breath, a surprisingly soft sound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He grabbed her elbow. ‘You’re quite cute, Miss Goldstein.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina glared. ‘Shut up, Scamander!’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The last thing she heard before they Apparated was Theseus’ ungraceful snort.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Diagon Alley was a fairytale. They didn’t linger for too long, but it was enough for Tina’s heart to soar with wonder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus sent an owl to the Ministry, then hurried her along to a small pub where Tina had her first butterbear. He also got her a coffee to go, which was nice. Their next stop was Gringotts Wizarding Bank, where Tina got some Galleons, Sickles and Knuts, and they both got some French currency. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After that, he asked what sort of shops she was interested in. Without hesitation, she asked to go to Flourish &amp; Blotts. Theseus rolled his eyes, but did take her to the bookshop. That was the only place where Tina lingered, next to the display of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘He doesn’t know it yet’, Theseus whispered, ‘but I’m confident the book will make it on the mandatory read list next term.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina felt immense pride. ‘That was his goal with this book, wasn’t it? To change how the community regards magical creatures?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Quite.’, Theseus hummed. ‘I can’t believe the bastard actually did it.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina was surprised by the curse word, not because she was unaccustomed with men cursing in her presence, but because it was Theseus who had said it. Him and Newt both, they were so… proper. Raised in a certain way, a polite way that spoke of high society, a way that Tina was terribly unfamiliar with. But in that moment, she realized that even for Theseus, it was a facade, it was something that he had to do. It also became clear that he was getting comfortable around Tina, and she didn’t know what to make of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So she asked him to point her in the spellbooks direction, and maybe magical law.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina left the shop with six books, Theseus with an exasperated, but resigned expression. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They also stopped at a small stall that sold various trinkets, where Tina took less than three minutes to select a bracelet and a pendant to get Queenie. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Leta should be home by now.’, Theseus said with a little hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘We can go, yes.’, Tina nodded. ‘You should spend some time with her until we leave tomorrow.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a grateful nod, he took her elbow and together, they Apparated close to his home.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>///</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta had been out arranging various things for the wedding, apparently. Tina felt disgusted, at first, that Newt was missing and she was babbling on about flowers and bands, but then she realized she had been shopping today, so she really couldn’t judge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt was missing, but life went on, and Leta believed that they were going to find him, sooner rather than later, considering their wedding was three months away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were all around the table, having a late lunch, but once Leta stopped talking about the wedding, her expression turned from excited to something fond, as she regarded Tina.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You don’t like me.’, she said with confidence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina hesitated only a second. ‘I don’t know you, Miss Lestrange. And what I do know, yes, those few bits I don’t like.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Newt’s okay with it, you know.’, Theseus said gently. ‘With Leta and I getting married. I know what you’re thinking, that he only said so because he didn’t want to hurt me, but I know my brother. He’s a terrible liar.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That much was true, Newt really was a horrible liar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I hope that’s true.’, she truthfully told Theseus. ‘I do hope you two love each other, strongly and truthfully for a long, long time.’ She turned towards Leta. ‘And I hope Newt really is alright with it.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘He hasn’t told you, has he?’, Leta frowned. ‘About our engagement?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina shook her head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘And that’s why you’re still on the fence about me. Because Newt hasn’t told you.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Oh, he told her what happened at Hogwarts.’, Theseus said confidently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Yes.’, Tina admitted. ‘But nothing else.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta just looked at her, for a long while. Tina had no idea what she was looking for. In the end, the other woman smiled, a little, and leaned back in her chair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’m sure Newt has his reasons. And knowing him, it’s probably a series of really bad, emotional and embarrassing reasons.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sounded very amused and fond, and it made Theseus chuckle. Whatever Tina wanted to say was interrupted by an owl at the window. Theseus excused himself to write a reply, saying it was work related, but not Newt related. So Tina and Leta were left alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other woman was watching Tina with an interest in her eyes, but she didn’t think it was… evil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘What?’, Tina asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta smiled. ‘Since Theseus and I got engaged, I only met Newt once. The three of us had dinner, and it was all perfectly civil. He was awkward, though, as you’d expect.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina nodded at that, picturing it clearly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘But’, Leta went on, ‘he mentioned you and your sister, once. Theseus said that Newt smiled like that only when he talked about his creatures.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina felt something squeezing around her heart because, once again, she could pictured it clearly. The glint in his eyes, the smile on his lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Queenie says that we’re both weird’, she found herself saying, ‘but different kinds of weird. So we found each other to complete the full circle of weirdness.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta chuckled at that. ‘I think your sister is right. Newt and I were both weird, in school, but we were similar types of weird.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina shook her head. ‘I don’t even know if-’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Yes you do.’, the other woman cut her off. ‘You know how Newt feels, you see it clearly in every letter he sends you. What I don’t know… is weather or not you feel the same.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Around her blush, Tina forced herself to look into Leta’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’m on another continent, working behind my government’s back, ready to act against the greatest dark wizard our world has ever seen, just to get Newt back. What do you think?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly, Leta smiled. ‘I think I like you, Miss Goldstein.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina laughed, feeling tired of all a sudden. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Theseus came back into the room a few minutes later, he found both of the women giggling uncontrollably, watching Pickett taking a bath in Tina’s cup of tea. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina spent the rest of the day in the case, except for dinner, which she spent trying to convince her two hosts that Ilvermorny was far better than Hogwash.</span>
