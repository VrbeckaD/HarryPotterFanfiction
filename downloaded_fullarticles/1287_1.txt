    <p>Harry’s POV<br/>
I couldn’t hold it in anymore. My lust for him overtook my rationality. I slammed him up against the walls of the laboratory and placed my knees in between his.<br/>
“Ha-Harry? Um… you alright mate?” Ron’s voice quavered.<br/>
I stared at him and ravished the sight of him being under me. His beautiful ocean blue eyes and freckles that littered all over him. Beautiful.<br/>
“Harry?” Ron called out to me again. This time, less nervous.<br/>
“Ha-” Ron was quickly cut short when I kissed him on his lips. I devoured his lips like it was the most delicious thing I ever tasted. I sucked and bit on his soft pink lips, making his lips swollen. I tried to enter his mouth but Ron’s mouth was shut tightly and so was his eyes. His hands, which were originally placed on my shoulder to push me away, started clenching my shirt.<br/>
I then slithered my hands under his shirt and onto his nipples. With that action, Ron gasped in shock, which gave me an upper hand. I quickly devoured and explored the caverns of the insides of his mouth. Ron’s breathing started becoming harsher and saliva drooling down his chins. I looked up to see Ron eyes tearing up, this made his eyes even more beautiful. He was flushed and had ragged breathing.<br/>
I then decided to move down to his naped and suck on it, giving him a hickey. While doing so, Ron breathing wavered and his legs started to give out. Oh, what a sight it was. Ron was even more beautiful than before.<br/>
“Har-ry, s-s-top” Ron said in his ravished state<br/>
This had only made me more aroused. I was about to go on when someone pulled me away from Ron and took hold of Ron so that he won’t fall.<br/>
“Who the-”<br/>
“Oh, Potter. What a thing to do to your best friend.” Malfoy interrupted my question and proceeded to glare at me.<br/>
“What’s it got to do with you Malfoy,” I said defensively<br/>
“He said stop, didn’t he. Don’t you the word consent? You might as well be raping him, Potter.” Malfoy said with much intensity.<br/>
“What?! Rape?! Don’t lump me in with that!” I replied furiously. I would never rape Ron. I love him!<br/>
Malfoy snorted and carried Ron away from the lavatory.</p><p>Malfoy’s POV<br/>
I was about to enter the lavatory until I heard harsh breathing and kissing sounds. What in the world do these people think they're doing? Truly disgusting. Deciding that it wasn’t a good time to go in, I took a 180-degree turn and went back. But as I did so, I heard Weasley’s voice. He was moaning while trying to say, ‘Harry stop’. What in the world. Is Potter trying to rape him? How dare him. That bloody prat. With that, I quickly took off towards the lavatory. Inside I saw Potter giving many hickeys to poor Weasley and Weasley was crying and looking dazed and confused. But seeing Weasley in this state was… arousing, to say the very least. But I’m not a stupid Gryffindor who can’t control his libido. I’m a Slytherin for Merlin's sake. I then strutted towards Potter and pulled him off of Weasley. Hmph, Potter looked furious. And oh, poor Weasley he didn’t even have the energy to stand. I took his arms and placed it around my shoulders.<br/>
“Who the-” Potter said with much irritation.<br/>
“Oh, Potter. What a thing to do to your best friend.” I interrupted him and glared at him.<br/>
“What’s it got to do with you Malfoy,” Potter said defensively<br/>
“He said stop, didn’t he. Don’t you the word consent? You might as well be raping him, Potter.” I said with much intensity.<br/>
“What?! Rape?! Don’t lump me in with that!” Potter replied furiously.<br/>
Stupid Gryffindor, does anything even go through your brain? What an imbecile.<br/>
I then snorted and carried Ron away from the lavatory.</p><p>Ron’s POV<br/>
When Harry started kissing me and touching me, my brain was an absolute blank. I didn’t know how to respond. Maybe that’s why Harry thought I allowed this to happen to me. I was mostly confused and scared. Harry’s my best friend… right?<br/>
I tried asking Harry to stop but he looked so...intense. For a moment I thought I was going to die. He looked like he was going to eat me up, his gaze made me shiver. Thankfully somebody stopped Harry before he could proceed any further. But the person was the most unlikely one. Malfoy. My legs were weak and I didn’t know why but it unabled me to walk. So Malfoy helped me all the way to Madam Pomfrey. When we arrived at the hospital wing, Madam Pomfrey gave me a questionable look and decided not to ask any questions. Thankfully. I was embarrassed as it is already. Madam Pomfrey then gave a bloody disgusting potion for me to drink. I did but I gagged doing so. It was atrocious, to say the least.<br/>
“Look out for Potter alright. I know his your best mate but it doesn't mean you can lower down your guard.I’ ll be going now. Take care.” Malfoy said gently<br/>
Is this really Malfoy? That pompous git who insulted my whole family. The Malfoy? He seemed really...nice. Bloody hell.<br/>
“Rest for a couple more minutes and you can go. Now I won’t question your actions but if it happens again please tell a professor or a friend at the very least.</p><p> During dinner, Harry wasn’t there. Was he afraid of seeing me? But he’s the one who did all that touching and kissing, not me! Why should he be afraid?<br/>
“Ron, do you know why Harry’s not here?” Hermione said while scooping mash potatoes onto her plate.<br/>
“Huh? Oh n-no” I replied, a bit startled at the question.<br/>
“Did you guys fight?” Hermione furrowed her eyebrows<br/>
“No, stop asking.” I quickly denied and took some drumsticks and chewed on it.<br/>
Hermione sighed loudly and proceeded to say “You guys are already 5th years, not 1st years. So act like it. But if you have anything to tell me, say it.”<br/>
“Mmm mkay,” I replied, not giving any eye contact to Hermione<br/>
Hermione sighed for a second time and started eating her dinner.<br/>
Should I tell Hermione? But Mdm Promfey said if it happens again then… argh, I’ll just see how it goes.</p><p> When I went back to the Gryffindor tower, Harry wasn’t there. Where the hell was he? I sighed and trudged up to the boy’s dorm to find Harry but to no avail. Deciding that the day's event was enough for me, I quickly retired to bed. </p><p>Narrator POV<br/>
It wasn’t long before Hermione got annoyed with the distance Ron and Harry had. Hermione had relentlessly asked Ron on what exactly had happened between those two but only to be met with either utter nonsense or denial. Finally, Hermione had snapped and forcibly demanded Ron to ‘get it out’. In the end, Hermione became the victor and managed to get the information out of Ron. But that had made Hermione quite surprised - Scratch that - Profoundly surprised.<br/>
“What?! He kissed you?! Is he mad? Oh my gosh!” Hermione scowled at the thought of Harry taking advantage of Ron’s ignorance.<br/>
“Hermione! Lower your voice.” Ron spluttered in embarrassment at Hermione's’ outburst.<br/>
“Now, Ron, what did you do?”<br/>
“What do you mean by ‘what did you do’? Ron raised his eyebrows in confusion. Hermione then sighed.<br/>
“Exactly what I meant” Hermione replied.<br/>
“Well I couldn’t do anything, a-an-d he was gonna go on if not for Malfoy.”<br/>
“So you were basically a damsel in distre- Wait, Malfoy?” If Hermione wasn’t already shocked before, she was now. “ Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. He who continuously called me, a mudblood and you, a blood traitor? The Draco Malfoy?” Hermione bombarded Ron with questions which were said in disbelief. She was at a lost. Hermione Granger, at a lost.<br/>
“Yes Hermione, The Draco Malfoy.”<br/>
“Did he do anything to you?” Hermione asked with a hint of nervousness in her voice<br/>
“Have you lost the plot? Of course not.” Ron then proceeded to storm off to Potions’ class.<br/>
“Wait - Ron!” Hermione, with her books wrapped in her arms, chased after Ron.</p><p>Hermione’s POV</p><p>When I entered the potions classroom with Ron. I saw Harry. He was happily chatting with Nevile without care. That idiot he better repent on what he did. I then tilted my neck to check on Ron. He looked nervous, his fingers were trembling as he looked at Harry’s direction. I sighed, Harry doing that sacrilegious act had made Ron a jittering mess. I then placed my hand on Ron’s shoulder to calm him down but it was met with a backlash. Ron had jolted and dropped his books. This had made the class’s attention move to him. Ron's face began to turn as red as his hair and became even more of a mess. I sighed again and bent down to help with Ron’s book.<br/>
“Th-an-thanks He-Hermione,” Ron said and took his books from my grasp frantically.<br/>
I watched as Ron went to find a sit and obviously not anywhere near Harry. Harry’s face had a hint of disappointment at Ron’s decision. But Isn’t it an obvious thing after what you had done. Gosh, sometimes I don’t even know why I’m friends with him. He can be more of an idiot than Ron at times. I then walked briskly towards Malfoy.<br/>
“Hello Malfoy,” I said with gusto.<br/>
Malfoy was cut short from his conversation and looked at me with surprise in his face.<br/>
“What do you want Granger” Malfoy spat<br/>
Oh so it’s only Weasley he’s kind to. Interesting.<br/>
“On behalf of Ron, I would like to thank you for saving Ron from Harry,” I said with a forced smile.<br/>
Malfoy snorted and meticulously said, “You’re not here for that, what is your real reason, Granger.”<br/>
“Expected of you Malfoy. I would like to understand why you had chosen to interfere with the situation and helped Ron. Don’t you hate him? After all, you always belittled him. Anyways, likewise, what is your real reason Malfoy.”<br/>
At my peripheral vision, I saw Professor Snape and I decided that the conversation can wait and quickly went to another table. But before I could do so, Malfoy grasped my arms tightly and said: “Stay, I’ll tell you why.”<br/>
I could see Professor Snape eyeing in my direction. Clearly amused at my choice of place.<br/>
“Look, Granger, I’ll tell you why but on one condition. Please don’t let Ron near Potter.” Malfoy pleaded.<br/>
It was a first. Malfoy pleading and did he say, Ron?<br/>
“I can’t promise you that and you know it. Ron and Harry are best friends and It’s natural for them to be together. I can’t just end a friendship like that.” I said precariously<br/>
Malfoy took a deep sigh.<br/>
“I understand. But let me rephrase it instead. Keep an eye out for Potter, don’t let it happen again. It was a miracle that I stumbled upon them at that time. And I thank Merlin that, but I can’t guarantee a second miracle. So In my place, protect Ron.”<br/>
I was quite shocked at how much Malfoy cared for Ron.<br/>
“That I can promise. But what about when in the dorms or classes that I don’t have with them?” I said uncertainly<br/>
“I can help for classes but dorms… you figure it out”<br/>
With that, the conversation died and the rest of the period was spent concentrating on class.</p><p>“Hey! Hermione” Harry called out to me<br/>
I sighed and stopped in my tracks to allow Harry to catch up to me.<br/>
“Do you know where’s Ron? After Potion ended, he just disappeared.” Harry said but looked around at the same time to see any traces of Ron.<br/>
“Look, Harry, can we have a talk?”<br/>
“What? Bu-” Harry was clearly displeased at my reply and wanted to find Ron as soon as possible<br/>
“Now.”</p>
