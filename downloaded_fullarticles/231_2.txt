    <p>The desire to sleep had all but left Harry as October slowly ticked toward Halloween, despite the deepening shadows that had become a firm fixture under his eyes – prompting a multitude of quiet frowns from Hermione's direction. He couldn't understand why his rest felt so disturbed. For the last four days he had woken early, drained and uneasy, feeling as if something terrible had happened. Though it was quickly apparent each time that nothing was out of place. At least nothing beyond the usual trouble of his fifth year at Hogwarts…</p><p>It wasn't a case of asking for Dreamless Sleep potion, for he couldn't even remember his dreams by the morning. If he had dreamt at all. His friends had asked, several times, if he was okay. But each time he had felt inclined to say something, it seemed as though there were prying eyes and cocked ears twitching in their direction. He had fallen low enough in the wizarding world's eyes following Voldemort's return; all he needed was more fuel to incense the 'Harry Potter is a crazed liar' fire. So, he said nothing. Said he was fine. Maybe he was?</p><p>Harry was several paces behind Hermione and Ron as he pondered this thought, trying to disguise his yawns as he slugged his bookbag higher on his shoulder – not quite understanding why they were heading to Potions with so much time to spare. Everyone else was probably still enjoying breakfast.</p><p>Sighing at the idea of spending the next two hours with the Slytherins and his irate professor, Harry tried not to drag his feet too much, rolling his eyes as his best friends began bickering about something; drowning out their conversation and glancing around at the oddly empty hallway. They really were early.</p><p>Just as he was about to pick up his step and interrupt whatever argument was brewing ahead of him, his eyes caught sight of a glint of gold shining in the alcove to his left. The small recess was half covered by an old draped tapestry, but something had definitely lit up in the shadows for a moment. Maybe it shouldn't have sparked his interest, but Harry's feet pulled to a halt, his green eyes fixed on the now darkened space; a tingling feeling of familiarity crawling up his neck. It had almost looked like a snitch, in the way the ball sometimes caught the sunlight on the pitch, giving away its location for just a moment.</p><p>Glancing back to his friends, he saw that they hadn't noticed him come to a stop. Ron was waving his hands around in a dramatic fashion, his Weasley stubbornness clearly coming to the fore. Taking advantage of their distraction, Harry approached the alcove and pushed the heavy fabric to the side, peering in at the shadowed and empty space; a cold torch sitting on the wall and a few abandoned cobwebs dropping from the ceiling.</p><p>Frowning, he shook his head. There wasn't even a spider moving around in the shabby webs, never mind glittering gold.</p><p>He really did need sleep.</p><p>Turning to leave, he had just let go of the dusty cloth when something snaked its way around his chest and arms, trapping them to his sides with an alarming firmness. Harry found himself dragged back into the dark, a smooth hand falling securely over his mouth, silencing his startled shout.</p><p>Panic hammered in his chest and he fought against the grip, suddenly aware of a body behind him. The hold on his face was so fierce he couldn't turn his head to look, but he struggled against the arm trapping him, aware that the skin he could feel against his was cool. Something about that turned his stomach and he recoiled as he was pulled farther back against a taller form.</p><p>He was sure his captor could hear the thundering beat of his heart, but they said nothing. Said nothing and did nothing, simply holding him in silence until he stopped fighting, his inhalation laboured as he fought to breathe through his nose, desperate for the wand concealed in his pocket.</p><p>The second he slacked slightly in the tight grip, the arm around his chest uncoiled. But it didn't release him. Instead, long fingers crept up to his throat, teasingly light at first, until they took a firm and painful grip.</p><p>The choking sensation drove Harry into action once more and his arms recalled their sudden freedom, elbows throwing themselves back in a sharp attack. An attack that met nothing. The force he had struck with pulled Harry backwards, a shout of surprise leaving his now free mouth as he stumbled, hitting the stone floor with a resounding smack.</p><p>Bewildered and fearful, he looked up, turning this way and that, aghast at the empty space around him.</p><p>There was nothing. He was alone.</p><p>Sitting on the ground trying to control his breathing was just how Ron found him, his astonished face peering from behind the tapestry, allowing soft light to filter in and reveal his friend, looking worryingly pale and completely out of place.</p><p>"Er, Harry mate? You alright? We heard you shout something."</p><p>He found the familiarity of his friend's voice to be jarringly normal after what had just happened and didn't immediately respond.</p><p>"Any reason you're sitting on the ground behind a tapestry of-" Ron cut off to pull his head back and glance at the scene woven into the front of the fabric. "-Salazar Slytherin? Ugh, bad luck there mate."</p><p>The other boy's voice had taken on an amused tone, but Harry couldn't find it in himself to crack a smile. Nothing about what had just happened was funny. Trying to shake it off, he pulled himself up, stepping out with a suppressed shiver.</p><p>Hermione came into view as soon as he was safely back in the corridor, and he instantly read the concern written across her features.</p><p>"Harry, what happened?"</p><p>"Huh? Oh, n-nothing." He couldn't bring himself to say more, his mouth drying up as he caught sight of Slytherin's face donning the moth-eaten textile in front of him.</p><p>Hermione's face turned down in disapproval, clearly not believing a word. But he didn't want a fight and quickly followed up with the subject he had previously been avoiding, happily distracting her.</p><p>"I just didn't sleep much at all last night. I think I'm a bit all over the place because of it. Thought I saw something moving in there and tripped in the dark."</p><p>It worked. Harry felt a tad guilty as concern flooded her kind eyes, Ron's own expression turning to one of sympathy.</p><p>"It's understandable, mate," the redhead said. "What with everything that's been going on this year."</p><p>Hermione solidly agreed, though Harry could see her expression momentarily flashing with soft suspicion. But she left it alone, too worried for her friend's exhausted state. Taking his arm, her warm hand chased away the feeling of those fingers gripping his throat.</p><p>"You should head back to bed, Harry."</p><p>But he shook his head. Not only because he didn't want to subject himself to sleep, but because in that moment he really didn't want to be alone.</p><p>"Nah, Snape will have my head. I'll have an early night tonight." Likely a lie. But necessary.</p><p>Reluctantly, she agreed, gently pulling Harry along by the arm toward the dungeons as Ron followed suit.</p><p>He tried to push the incident from his mind. Perhaps it was only sleep related. After all, didn't people start to hallucinate if they stayed awake for long periods?</p><p>This explanation didn't sit right with him, but he focused on it all through potions – losing twenty points in the process for blankly ignoring Snape's question regarding puffskein hearts. Though, it was worth it if it kept the thought of unknown hands trapping and choking him at bay.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>He managed to get through the rest of the day relatively unbothered. Even when night fell, for a good hour he was distracted by a game of wizarding chess with Ron, the warmth of the Gryffindor common room keeping him grounded – though slightly drowsy. But then his eyes began to drop slightly of their own accord, getting to the point that even Ron told him to hit the bed. Reluctantly agreeing, he made his way upstairs, ignoring the distrustful eyes of Seamus Finnegan as he passed, diverting to the bathrooms with his pyjamas in an attempt to get away from the suspicious Gryffindor.</p><p>Dropping his crumpled nightwear on a nearby sink, Harry turned on the cold tap, letting the water run for a moment before cupping his hands underneath the icy liquid and splashing his face.</p><p>Lifting his head to glance in the mirror, he sighed at the exhausted eyes in front of him, towelling off the water droplets with a harsh hand, leaving his skin red as a result.</p><p>He had just picked up his toothbrush when the echo of steps on the tiles sounded harshly in the empty space. On red alert after the incident that morning, Harry spun around, though he berated himself for his paranoia when there was nothing there. It seemed as if he really would have to sleep soon, edgy feelings aside. If he kept imagining things, then maybe the Prophet would be justified in some of the things they had started to write about him.</p><p>Turning back to the mirror angrily, he raised his toothbrush to his mouth only for his hand to freeze mid-air, eyes widening and brain short-circuiting as he was met with the reflection of a boy in the mirror. A very familiar boy, standing a few steps behind him, his lips curled in a small smirk; a polished golden badge glinting on his robes. He spun to face him, to ensure he was really there – praying he wasn't.</p><p>"Hello Harry," Tom Riddle said softly, his voice carrying around the space with haunting familiarity.</p><p>The toothbrush clattered to the ground.</p><p>Harry's hands fumbled their way to his pockets, reaching for his wand; apparition or not.</p><p>But he found nothing, slowly lifting his wide eyes back to the young man ahead of him, blood draining from his face as nimble Slytherin fingers twirled Harry's holly wand in pretty motions, light and effortlessly – and wholly terrifying.</p><p>"No wand," Tom said gently, his eyes glinting with an ill intent that didn't match the softness of his expression or tone. "Whatever is our young Gryffindor hero to do?"</p><p>Harry swallowed. Was this even real? Surely it was impossible.</p><p>But the fact remained that he had put his wand in his robe's right pocket, and now it was dancing in the hands of the boy in front of him. A fact that strongly indicated the dreaded figure was at least somewhat corporeal.</p><p>The thought of strangling hands came flooding back to him so suddenly that he just knew, his subconscious connecting the dots almost instinctively. This wasn't some sleep-deprived daydream. Something in his gut told him that this was very real, and very wrong.</p><p>"It was you," Harry whispered.</p><p>Riddle's eyebrows simply lifted slightly.</p><p>"You grabbed me. Earlier."</p><p>There was a slight pause, but then the taller boy laughed lightly. "You were positively beside yourself with bewilderment. It was quite a sight."</p><p>Harry's eyes turned cold, his embarrassed anger chasing away a touch of his fear.</p><p>"How is this even possible?"</p><p>Surprisingly, Riddle looked quite delighted at the question. He spun Harry's wand faster.</p><p>"Now, that really <em>is</em> a fascinating story."</p><p>"You couldn't have survived the diary," the Gryffindor ground out, willing himself to believe it.</p><p>Riddle laughed once more, long and tinged with a playful quality. Harry hated it.</p><p>"Of course not. That version of myself is long gone. I admit, I think he is the reason you see me as I am. And not in my… true form, as it should be considering the time of my birth."</p><p>The words were completely lost on the green-eyed wizard and frustration edged into his mind at the careless explanation.</p><p>"I don't-"</p><p>The twisted smile that now interrupted the handsome face in front of him brought his words to a halt and he fell silent.</p><p>"I'm from far closer than any diary, Harry Potter. You've shaped me, in a lot of ways. It's rather amusing, how well I know you and how little you know of me; I thought you might suspect something by now. But magic has a way of revealing the truth, though even I didn't foresee how much your encounter in the graveyard would affect us both."</p><p>Before he could digest what any of that meant, Harry noted Riddle take a step toward him, destroying his immediate interest in the current conversation and alerting his nerves to the danger he was in.</p><p>He glanced toward the door.</p><p>"Oh, come now, Harry. I think you understand how much worse it could be if you run from me."</p><p>The words chilled him, the handsome face morphing into its snake-like counterpart for just a moment. Dread boiled in Harry's stomach and he furiously tried to think of a way out – one that wouldn't unleash this figure on his friends and the other students sitting downstairs, happily oblivious to it all.</p><p>Riddle had stopped twirling the wand, instead he pocketed it and took several steps toward the younger man. Harry backed up until he hit the sink, stumbling slightly.</p><p>"What do you want?" he asked, trying to instill some bite into the words, but his voice shook slightly on the last one.</p><p>The Slytherin said nothing. He simply stared at him, a hunger building in his expression.</p><p>Harry tried to avoid those eyes, instead glancing down to the pocket where the other had discarded his wand, wondering how he could get to it, knowing it was his only chance.</p><p>As they stood there, caught in an odd stand-off that the young Voldemort seemed perfectly content in, Harry decided to make use of his quidditch reflexes, weighing off the angle he could dive to in order to get to the pocket with the most speed. Riddle was currently unarmed, so this was his best chance. But the second he jolted forward, the other boy seemed to slip to the side slightly, twisting around in an odd sort of dance that resulted in Harry being forcefully spun around to face the sink, his body slammed into it, arms trapped behind him and a vicious fist locked into his hair.</p><p>Despite the manoeuvre and the resulting struggle, there wasn't a ruffled or unkempt thing about Tom's appearance, his expression oddly calm and dangerous, standing behind Harry and gazing at him through the mirror in front. The familiar feeling of the cool hand trapping his wrists left no doubt in Harry's mind that it was this terrifying form that had cornered him that morning.</p><p>"I'm afraid you can't fight me. It's as pointless as struggling against yourself."</p><p>The words halted Harry's movements as he was forced to look back at the remorseless face reflected in front of him, his breath heavy and heart in overdrive.</p><p>"Fighting against you will never be pointless," he said savagely. "No-matter what version of you it is."</p><p>The grip became painful. "You will never win against me. Do you understand?" The voice was calm, but the words were almost feverish in their intensity. "<em>I</em> will be your undoing, Harry. And I am better equipped to destroy you than my current counterpart. I can take you apart, piece by piece if I have to. For I know exactly which parts of you will break away first. That is something <em>he</em> has yet to learn."</p><p>Terror flooded Harry as he listened to the sadistic intent of the monster behind him.</p><p>"<em>What are you</em>?" he found himself whispering, awe mingling with his fright, letting the words form on his tongue without permission. This wasn't the collected and controlled Tom Riddle he had met all those years ago, nor was this the cold and callous creature that Voldemort had become. This… <em>phantom</em> was something different. Too familiar and far too close <em>– </em>his grip severe and nauseatingly intimate, making Harry pull away despite the pain throbbing across his scalp.</p><p>Riddle said nothing at first, simply angling his head to the side slightly, watching Harry's reflected eyes with unbridled intensity. But then he spoke, no smile on his lips, a curious expression dawning on his features – an oddly uncertain look for a boy so scarily sure of himself.</p><p>"What – or<em> who</em> – am I, you ask? Simply take a closer look."</p><p>The words were harsh, as was the strength that forced Harry's face against the ice-cold mirror, his cheek pressed up against the glass painfully as Riddle's eyes grew furious.</p><p>The taller boy leaned in, milliseconds from whispering something troubling in Harry's ear when the bathroom door banged loudly and Seamus and Dean strolled through, towels carelessly thrown over their shoulders, animated chat halting as soon as Seamus caught sight of Harry – their fellow Gryffindor collapsed over one of the sinks. Alone.</p><p>"Harry?" Dean asked, tentatively, unaware of what he had just disturbed, but clearly unnerved by the pasty pallor of the boy in front of him.</p><p>His question and inquisitive look went ignored as Harry quickly righted himself and turned around, desperately searching the tiled space for something, hands scrambling through his pockets – ignoring the toothbrush left carelessly on the ground and pyjamas on the sink as he fled the space.</p><p>His wand was still gone.</p><p>"Hey, wait-" came Dean's voice, with Seamus' hostile whispers underscoring the attempt to draw him into conversation. But he blocked them both out as he threw the door closed behind him and stood in the empty dormitory, leaning against the solid wood trying to control his breath.</p><p>This wasn't happening.</p><p>Stumbling over to his bed, he stopped short upon sighting one of his discarded schoolbooks lying on the covers, his wand neatly placed atop it.</p><p>Shaking hands reached down and picked the wand up, trying to find comfort in the familiar feel of it. Only then did he approach the book, fingers wary as he raised it into the light, as if holding it too hard would cause pain.</p><p>He was right to be cautious.</p><p>Burned across the front in a tidy script his twelve-year-old self had been rather familiar with was a simple, yet darkly effective, message:</p><p>'<em>Not a word.'</em></p><p>He felt sick, dropping it as if it had burned him, looking around with a wild expression that he knew he'd have to smooth over before any of his housemates came to bed.</p><p>What was he supposed to do? How could he even prove that he wasn't just going insane? The words had been etched into the hardcover with his own wand, for Merlin's sake. Dropping down onto the mattress, Harry clutched his head, scrunching his eyes shut, wholly lost and undeniably afraid.</p><p>He needed help.</p>
