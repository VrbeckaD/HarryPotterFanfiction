    <p>Steam was coming off of the Hogwarts Express as it whistled, warning students of various ages that it would only be standing there for so long. Platform 9¾ was bustling, with parents yelling last minute words of encouragement mixed with warnings. Molly Weasley had given her son Ron a look of concern as the boy hugged her absent-mindedly. Ginny shared some of Ron’s gloom and neither of the parents knew what to say to cheer their children up.</p><p>“Well, you better get on before the train leaves without you!” was Arthur’s best shot. It wasn’t of much help.</p><p>“The train wouldn’t be the first to do that.”</p><p>Ron’s hollow words took everyone, including himself, by surprise. He had promised himself to not let the shock and sorrow overtake him, like it had done Neville, who was currently rocking a bright purple stripe in his raven black hair, with obnoxious eyeliner to match. The incident had happened six months ago now, but the wounds were still as fresh as if it had happened yesterday.</p><p>Ginny nudged Ron. “Come on, bro.”</p><p>Mr. Weasley looked perplexed at his daughter’s newfound vernacular, but Molly shrugged and mumbled something that sounded like teenagers. Ginny was starting her third year at Hogwarts this year.</p><p>Ron plopped down in the nearest empty train compartment, leaning his elbow on the windowsill, propping his face on his palm. Ginny felt nothing but empathy towards her big brother. It had been but two years since Harry saved her from V… He-who-must-not-be-named. To her, Ron looked like the remnants of a dementor’s feast. She couldn’t decide whether to leave him some space or to stay with him, but her legs started walking towards the hallway on their own. He looked up briefly, reacting to her movements.</p><p>“Fam, look, I should go check on Neville and Luna… Hermione finna be here soon.”<br/>
Ron nodded at her as she turned around and disappeared into the crowd of students. He had almost gotten used to her new lingo, which she had developed after Hermione had sent her an owl that spoke of some hot muggle artist “Bhad Bhabie”.</p><p>Ron wondered to himself if Hermione had gotten on the train early, as chipper as his twin brothers, and was currently sitting somewhere gleefully waiting for his arrival, maybe chewing on Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans. Ron shut his eyes tight when he saw her smiling in his head. No, he couldn’t think of her like that… she would also be in mourning.</p><p>It was as if he had muttered “Accio Hermione!” when her bushy brown hair stepped into his train compartment. Just like Ron, her face was wiped clean of anything resembling joy. Still, she smiled politely at him, and he smiled politely through her. Crookshanks was in a cat carrier, glaring at Scabbers who was sitting on Ron’s lap.</p><p>“Hey, if you constrain your pet, I’ll constrain mine,” Hermione coughed out. Her voice was thick and mushy. It sounded like she hadn’t talked in ages.</p><p>“Right, sorry.” Ron smiled apologetically for a millisecond and shoved his rat into the pocket of his pants. It felt strange for both of them to agree on something for once. Neither of them wanted to lose one another anymore, not after all that they’d lost recently. Both of them were determined to be as kind and polite to each other as was necessary to stay together. Scabbers tail stuck out and moved around violently, like The Whomping Willow.</p><p>“So… it’s been quite a year, huh?”</p><p>Ron danced around Hermione’s attempt at bringing up the elephant in the room, allowing himself a brief pause before answering.</p><p>“Yeah, the DADA teacher turned out to be a werewolf, Fudge forced Dumbledore to fire him… and that blasted maniac, Sirius Black, was given the dementor’s kiss.”</p><p>“Ron, there’s nothing wrong with werewolves-“</p><p>“Sure, there isn’t, as long as they’re not munching on students! I don’t know what that sick bastard was thinking, applying for a job near children.”</p><p>Hermione gave him a warning glance. “He couldn’t have been that big of a threat, Ron, Dumbledore trusted him!”</p><p>Those last words were enough to shut Ron up. His lips almost twitched into a smile at how close the two had been to bickering again. But Dumbledore was their only beacon of hope now. Ron could not question the only wizard that held a candle to He-who-must-not-be-named.</p><p>“Blimey Hermione, bringing the sage into this?”</p><p>She smiled at him like a wise old lady. The juxtaposition between her mental maturity and her youthful face felt like a dagger to Ron’s chest. They were all too young to be going through this.</p><p>“Wallowing in self-pity isn’t going to bring him back, y’know?”</p><p>“Who said I was wallowing?”</p><p>“Your face did, just now.”</p><p>The two sat in silence for a while, listening to the train’s deep hum as the vast and beautiful Scottish landscape flew past their window. Ron munched on the sandwich that his mother had made him, and Hermione bought some sweets from the trolley. Both of them thought about Harry, who would buy off every single product that the trolley had to offer. But it wasn’t his riches they missed, it was his kind and sharing nature. Ron felt a lump in his throat again, which he told himself was just a piece of the sandwich.</p><p>“I guess we better get changed now,” Hermione said, as neutrally as she could, after having noticed two students walking in the hall. They weren’t wearing their school uniforms nor their muggle clothes. It was funeral wear. Ron nodded, and soon the two were covered from head to toe in depressing, black cloths.</p><p>Somewhere in the corridor, a student mentioned Voldemort’s name. Both Ron and Hermione sat up straight as their eyes glowed with fear. They were worried, amidst the serenity of the crowd. The pair defied nature’s laws of flock mentality. The Daily Prophet had taken Harry’s death to mean that Voldemort would not return. That the rumors of Harry being the only one who could kill Voldemort were false. But Hermione and Ron trusted Dumbledore, and Dumbledore did not believe Fudge, who was the voice of the paper.</p><p>“So many fake news, it’s hard to tell what or who is even real anymore,” Ron said, out of the blue.</p><p>“He was real,” Hermione said, not quite knowing why. It certainly did not cheer either of them up.</p><p>Interrupting the two moody teens, Fred and George burst into the coupe. “Hello nerds! Have you heard the news?” Fred exclaimed, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>“Well of course they haven’t, these two goodie-two-shoes know nothing about gathering secret information, alas,” George said dramatically, holding the back of his hand up to his forehead like a fainting 18th century maiden. “They are doomed to hear it all too late, too late…”</p><p>“Hear about what?” Ron asked, beginning to feel annoyed with his brothers’ theatrics. The twins continued to grin mysteriously. It was clear to Ron and Hermione that they were up to no good.</p><p>“The Triwizard tournament of course, you dweeb!”</p><p>“The tri-what?”</p><p>“The Triwizard tournament… I think I’ve read about that,” Hermione cut in before Fred or George could further mock their younger brother’s ignorance. “It’s a magical contest held between the three largest wizarding schools of Europe – but wasn’t it discontinued due to the high death toll?”</p><p>“Right you are indeed, my fair lady!” George declared, but continued, as his smirk grew impossibly wide; “But this year, they are rebooting it again!”</p><p>“With new safety regulations to keep the number of deceased within an appropriate amount,” Fred said, and Ron sensed a hint of disappointment in his tone. Hermione wondered what exactly could be considered an “appropriate” number of dead students.</p><p>“Yep, the headmasters are imposing an age limit – only 17-year-olds can get in,” George said.</p><p>“Boo!” Fred chimed in.</p><p>“But then, neither of you can participate, right? Both of you are still minors,” Hermione remarked, even though she could anticipate that the two wouldn’t respect these rules.</p><p>“Right again, but you shall see that the two of us can outsmart those old geezers, and we’ll bring home the cup and 1000 galleons!”</p><p>“Don’t forget the eternal glory, Fred!”</p><p>Hermione seemed doubtful of their plan. “How can you two even be so sure that the tournament is this year? Who exactly is your source?”</p><p>The twins burst into dubious smiles. Hermione almost swore for a second that she saw horns appear on their red heads.</p><p>“Dumbledore himself of course! He told Rita Skeeter about the whole thing, really pissed off the other two headmasters.”</p><p>“But they forgave him of course, concluded that the whole point of the tournament is to bring the schools closer together, not drift them further apart. Good times are ahead!”</p><p>Ron had been quiet for a while, but those last few words finally forced his mouth open. “How can you even say something like that after all that’s happened! We’re going to a funeral, for Merlin’s sake!”</p><p>The coupe was awkwardly quiet as his words echoed through the air.</p><p>Fred and George shook their heads. “You have to keep looking forward, kids! Just cause they’re dead doesn’t mean that you gotta let your life go too!”</p><p>“They haven’t even buried the bodies yet,” Hermione mumbled.</p><p>Fred nodded solemnly. “It’s still been months though, half a year almost. They’ve kept them frozen like a… how was it that Dumbledore described them, George?”</p><p>“Like factory produced lemon sorbets!”</p><p>Fred shuddered. “He seemed so delighted as he described them to Rita Skeeter. Quite frankly, I think the old bat’s finally lost it.”</p><p>Hermione’s jaw dropped. Ron stood up, fuming with rage.</p><p>“DUMBLEDORE IS THE ONLY THING KEEPING VOLDEMORT AWAY!”</p><p>The rest of them looked shocked and jolted at the mention of his name.</p><p>“So what? Someone has to have the balls to say it out loud, now that Harry’s… Harry’s gone,” Ron muttered, struggling to say that last bit.</p><p>Fred and George rolled their eyes. “Enough with the emo antics… we sympathized with you during the last bit of the schoolyear, but you’ve seriously made The Burrow the saddest place ever this summer. Nobody could crack a joke without you wailing about how you’ve lost your best friend. And, clearly you’ve affected Hermione too. I mean look at her! She’s marinating in her own depression, just like you! And don’t even get me started on Ginny.” George paused, shaking his head. “Lord knows what this absurd coping mechanism even is. That weak muggle artist overvoiced our own explosions with her terrible rhymes!”</p><p>Hermione shuffled uncomfortably, feeling guilty for introducing Ginny to muggle pop culture. “What explosions?” she asked, hoping to deter the attention away from her own atrocities.</p><p>The twins looked at each other, and for the first time their smirks were wiped clean off their faces. “Who said anything about explosions?” Fred tried.</p><p>“Oh, and cheer up, Ron, don’t you realize that Victor Krum’s school is taking part in the tournament?”</p><p>Both of the twins made cooing noises and fake kissed the air.</p><p>“Oh, how my heart leaps out of my chest every time I see V winking at me on that poster,” Fred quoted.</p><p>Ron blushed deep red and tried to say something, but his voice was lost someplace else. Hermione shooed the two jesters out of their compartment.</p><p>She sat down and sighed. Ron refused to make eye contact.</p><p>“You know, there’s nothing shameful about liking-“</p><p>“I already told you! The diary was fabricated! Or it belonged to Ginny! I DON’T HAVE A CRUSH ON VICTOR KRUM!” he yelled. Students in the hallway and in the surrounding coupes howled with laughter.</p><p>______________________</p><p>The large, grey castle towered above the scenery as The Hogwarts Express made its final stop at the Hogsmeade station. The prefects informed the students that the sorting would take place after the funeral. The confused mass of students followed them and Mr. Filch to the grassy fields. There, the rest of the staff awaited them.</p><p>Ron wiped a stray tear away as they approached the chairs laid out in front of the caskets. Hermione also had tears brimming her eyes. Their loss almost felt surreal. Dumbledore himself lead the pair up to the front rows. Harry didn’t have any living family members, so Ron and Hermione were the next best thing. Next to them sat three muggles, to Ron’s surprise.</p><p>“Crazies, all of them! They’re dressed so strange, even for a funeral!”</p><p>“Hush, honey, you don’t want them noticing us. Imagine if they did m-magic on us…”</p><p>“Daddy, did mommy just say the m-word?” the son of the two muggles asked, with surprising fright. His voice was squeaky and childlike, considering his robust body.</p><p>“Yes! Now be quiet, Diddykins!”</p><p>“I hope you’re well seated and if you need anything, just ask.” A pair of glistening blue eyes stared straight into Petunia Dursley’s own, and her face turned green.<br/>
It did not take a genius to realize that Dumbledore himself had apparated the family to Hogsmeade and escorted them here. The trio seemed to all suffer from an exaggerated level of motion sickness and were all clearly afraid of the old wizard. Ron almost felt like giggling.</p><p>“We are all gathered here today, not to mourn our losses, but to celebrate the lives of Harry James Potter and Rubeus Hagrid. It was a tragic day in March, when an unruly Blast-Ended Skrewt took young Harry’s life in a terrible accident-“</p><p>“What the bloody hell is a Blast-Ended Skrewt?” Vernon asked his wife, and a wave of shushing blew past the audience. Ron and Hermione both rolled their eyes at the Dursleys’ disrespect.</p><p>“- and that same day only turned more tragic, when before dusk could even fall, our beloved Hagrid found himself in such guilt that he took his own life.”</p><p>Ron fell in and out of focus during the ceremony. The most he could remember was seeing the small child’s casket and the bigger, half-giant’s casket being flown off and buried with magic. The beauty of the moment had been spoiled when the Dursleys shrieked upon seeing them rise from the ground.</p><p>As the crowd got up from their seats, the students and the majority of the staff heading to the castle for the start of the schoolyear and the Dursleys heading towards Dumbledore for their trip back, Draco Malfoy found it necessary to describe Harry Potter as The Boy Who Lived – To Be Thirteen. This was in spite of the look of fear and sorrow weighing down his sharp features. Crabbe, Goyle and the whole Dursley family laughed.</p>
