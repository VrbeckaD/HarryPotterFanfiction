    <p>In the depths of his mind, he could remember distant words, whispers that echoed in his head. “I’m sorry I couldn’t do more...” they would say, but he was unable to move. “If I had done something about it sooner...” it continued, but the words would stop there, long lost in flashes and blurs that invaded him when he tried to think further back.</p><p>This was one of his earliest memories, for the rest were darkened by a hazy veil that he could only sometimes cross. He knew that it was the voice of his predecessor, the voice of Death, who had mentored him for many years after he had been created -at least, that’s how Hecate referred to his ‘birth’, ten years ago-. He couldn’t remember much of that time either, only snippets of it, but it was enough to tell him what he was supposed to be.</p><p>He was ‘born’ a godling, not quite mortal, but not a full god either. He was still capable of succumbing to a good blow to the head or a well placed bullet to the heart, but he didn’t grow old and he had a higher stamina than most, immortalized with the appearance that he was given after his creation, with his deathly pale skin and the dark circles under his eyes.</p><p>He was taught that things such as time were supposed to be impractical and inconsequential. Every day was merely a second in their existence and every soul was a cycle that would repeat itself eventually, a process that even the gods would sometimes have to go through after the thousands of years of life they were gifted by the original aspects of light and dark.</p><p>He was an avatar of death, though not a traditional one, for he wasn’t chosen by said primordial force, but rather by his predecessor. Because of this, he, Death would say, was different from the rest. He was special, something that had never been seen before, speaking of him like some miracle of nature, though he felt like anything but.</p><p>He originally thought that it had to do with the fact that, to him, time didn’t feel quite as brief as to other gods. Each day felt absurdly long and painful. Compared to the other gods, time was a concept that he was awfully familiar with and one that, when having a task as dull as his, he would rather not have.</p><p>Maybe, he thought, it had to do with the fact that he wasn’t unaffected by the souls in the way that his creator was. Or, better said, he was affected by them when Death wasn’t. Every time that they visited a warzone to help the angels collect the souls, his heart would ache and his head would be filled with the sound of screams that would last even after the fact, ringing in his ears while he was resting and making his dreams become terrifying nightmares.</p><p>They made him feel an uncomfortable sort of empty, like there was something that was taken from him in the same way that he reaped souls and, to distract himself from it, he liked to lose himself in his thoughts. He’d close his eyes and imagine a life where he wasn’t a godling of death, after all, he <em>had</em> come from <em>somewhere</em>.</p><p>He’d sink into the feeling of the void, letting his mind wander between unlikely and impossible. Worlds yet unseen and never achievable at this point. He’d imagine faces that were imprinted in his inner eye yet vague enough to never fully recognize them. Colors that flashed like tantalizing lights, daring him to take a step closer: red, blue, green, yellow-he was unable to count them all.</p><p>He could feel a familiar buzz, electrifying the air he breathed, beating as one with his own heart. A whisper, much like the one he muttered at his own reflection: <em>who am I?</em> He’d recall strong eyes of storm, framed by a platinum cascade. Ocean orbs that washed ashore in sandy blond. A feeling of safety like he had never known before-</p><p>He snapped back to reality. No matter how much he yearned another life, he was stuck here, forced to live until he gained godhood or he died by the hand of those souls he was sworn to help guide to the beyond.</p><p>However, these fragments brought something within him; change. Awareness. The colors of his day dreamings appeared more and more frequently. There was the green of cunning, seemingly overtaking anything man-made that dared to intrude in its territory through nature; there was the bright yellow of loyalty and it sure felt like the touch of the sun; there was the red of chivalry in flowers, animals and the essence of life and there was the blue of wisdom in both the sky and the sea, both just as endless and unreachable.</p><p>Although his creation brought forth a blank slate, his personality bled with what he could only call memories. He found himself feeling nostalgic at the sight of beautiful plants, not before freaking out at what the gloomy sensation was. He avoided colder climates like they were the plague, for the pricking feel of the freezing breeze would make him tear up and he wasn’t supposed to show so much emotion.</p><p>Which was why he was currently ‘enjoying’ the blazing heat of a desert, though he didn’t know which one. The only thing that he knew about this place was that it harboured a lot of souls and, though he could always leave the task to the angels of death, he didn’t have anything better to do.</p><p>He droned on, sometimes walking for days before he came across a stray soul that he’d transform into a little, white marble so that he could transport it easily to the stream of rebirth. If he forced very hard on both storm and sea, he could flawlessly ignore how the souls screeched as they were torn from the body or how the stray ones weeped until he took them for safekeeping.</p><p>A garble noise enters his field of consciousness, but not enough to stop his robotic movements. Step. Step. Step. The garble noise comes through again, louder, and it wakes his mind a little more and he tries to concentrate on it.</p><p>The third time, the noise becomes clear. It is a screeching-like sound that comes from everywhere at once. He is used to these sort of calls, having dealt with the ‘angels’ of death many times before. He doesn’t show any reaction other than an empty glance at its forehead, where it’s only eye is. He tries not to stare at the empty abyss that are its eye sockets, knowing that he will become sick if he does.</p><p>‘Angel’ is a rather pretty word for something so unnatural.</p><p>“What is it now? Another unexpected uprising?” He asks in an exhausted monotone. Now that he has a slight sense of awareness on his not-quite-immortal body, he can tell that he is tired. How long has he gone without rest?</p><p>The creature stands in place, wings folded back tightly as a sign of submission. It doesn’t speak. It can't without a mouth, but it offers him a hand and kneels. To his credit, he only hesitates for a bit before he takes it. Right away, a wave of images appear behind his eyelids like a hyper realistic film reel. It takes his body a while to adjust and sink into the sensation, the cold of a world without a nearby sun and the pull of gravity that's a hundred times worse.</p><p>-</p><p>
  <em>They stand in the realm of Death, Alfheim. Around them is a beautiful natural crystal cave that glows under the glow of their seven moons and, just a step away, is a hole that stretches and stretches into infinite darkness, where even the light of even the brightest lantern doesn't shine, but they don't need light. They lean forward, the feathers on their arms and legs standing as a sort of static fills their entire being, muddling their mind for a brief moment.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They tilt their head back, listening to what the voices of the pit mumbled. Something was amiss, they told them, someone had been there recently, disturbing the usual stream of souls that are part of the rebirth cycle. Their single eye glares at the nothingness and their feathers rumble with the angered air that flowed from the abyss.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Between one second and the next, they are falling. They aren’t afraid, after all, the angels’ right of passage is given through this very same fall and, after years of existence, they are used to the sensation. They fall and fall for what feels like forever and, just in the last moment, they spread their back wings, catching a current of air and gracefully gliding down. Their single eye is covered by their second eyelid so that they can see more clearly through both wind and piercing black.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Below them is a silver river that divides into hundreds and hundreds of more the further they travel. They close their lone gazing orb and, when they open it again, they can feel the pull of the stream, a cry of help from the voiceless, the non-corporeal. They head into a worrisome direction, since the rivers divide and divide until they stop dividing and there is only the deep deep dark.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The disturbance is getting closer, closer, closer and it is just beyond their fingertips.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There. They drop closer to the ground, where a small lake of golden resides. It doesn't branch like the silver one and the air seems far warmer down here. The souls twist and swirl inside the viscocious-like liquid. There is something in this atmosphere, something that has been there long enough to cause a horrid, putrid, pungent smell. They focus harder, trying to determine what it is.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It is easy: it comes from the whole river. They growl, the sound reverberating with their empty sockets burning alight and their feathers bristling. Tainted. It is the only word in the mundane language that can describe the sensation. Unholy hands had invaded their sacred space and took something. The river was missing balance. The golden was bleeding black and only <strong>now </strong>they had noticed this. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Someone <strong>stole</strong> from us!</em>
</p><p>-</p><p>The vision disappears as soon as it comes, leaving him dizzy. The creature lets him regain his surroundings and then reaches out with a stone slab that he was sure it didn’t have before sending him into its memories. He takes it with uncertainty.</p><p>“Those...those were the blessed souls..." He gasps, his long dead heart beating with anxiousness, to which the angel nods in confirmation. “It took me longer to assimilate the memory, so it was old. Have you been looking for them?” The creature points at the slab. The letters rearrange into something comprehensible, letters.</p><p>He looks down at them and, soon, he recognizes that they are names and coordinates. There are currently two of each, but there are a lot of blackened spaces that, he assumes, will be updated as soon as they are found. He hums and peeks up at the angel, whose arm and leg feathers are bristled with annoyance after reliving their own memory.</p><p>“Do we know who it was? Death never told me about them, so it wasn’t him...” The creature nods eagerly and, through another small touch, a floating, golden palace flashes briefly, quickly replaced with golden strings.</p><p>Of course, it had to be an asgardian.</p><p>“I’ll speak with Hecate about this, but you know that I can't do much." The angel stares at him with its lone orb "...Thanks for the information, you can go back.” It gives him a curt bow before its own shadow rises, engulfing it and disappearing. He soon imitated the action, feeling the coldness of darkness wash over him as he did.</p><p>Now, he stands somewhere new and, frankly, the feeling is less confusing than experiencing an Angel’s visions. At first, he thinks that his shadow-travelling might’ve somehow failed since there’s still sand everywhere, but he can hear voices coming from nearby and, when his eyes turn golden thanks to Death’s power flowing through his veins, he spots the weak whispers of the first blessed soul.</p><p>He focuses his thoughts on the tattoo on his back, a black circle inside of a triangle, perfectly split in half by a thin, vertical line. A second later, he feels as if a wild beast racked against his ribcage. His whole skin is lit ablaze by a tingling sensation and he can’t suppress a groan as he tries to confine it back inside of his body.</p><p>Magic. Thinking about it made his head pound, as if something was warning him against remembering, but he had to. Back then, he had been feeling restless and, when he told Death, he was told for the first time that he had been a human before he was a god and that the thing inside him was that, his magic. He had been cautioned to use it carefully, but it outright terrified him, so he kept it under lock and key at all times.</p><p>In his hand, something appears, detaching itself from both his magic and Death blessing since it was binded to both. He wipes the sweat off his brow and stares at the silvery cloak in his hands. It is one of the gifts that Death gave him when he inherited his power: The invisibility cloak.</p><p>He puts it on and, like that, he is out of sight and walking towards some desert dunes, catching glimpses of movement far beneath the sand.</p><p>There was a cave complex, badly hidden in the desert dunes. Might fool someone on air, but the entrance was wide open and bustling with activity. He wondered why a blessed soul would be in an environment such as this, but he shrugs and enters, going further and further down, not bothering to memorize the way back. He had all the time in the world to find a way out.</p><p>He finds himself in front of a heavy metal door. He closes his eyes and melts into the shadows once more, willing himself inside the room. He stares at the blessed soul which is slowly fading away and, when his eyes return to their original emerald color, he stumbles slightly at the scene in front of him.</p><p>There is a man, gloved hands caked in blood as he reaches into another’s chest with a pair of tweezers.</p><p>Not quite what he expected to see.</p><p>Whatever this person is doing, he doesn’t think that it is very healthy in these nefarious conditions and, evidenced by the weakening soul of the unconscious one, it wasn’t working very much either. Still, there isn’t anything else he can do other than sitting here and awaiting and, if his soul reached its unlatching point...well, he’d just have to jumpstart it again.</p><p>He swears that, for a brief moment, the man that is operating the other turned his gaze at him, but he’s wearing his invisibility cloak, so it was impossible. Unnerved, he moves closer to them, being careful of staying out of the other’s way and sitting down on a nearby table.</p><p>The procedure goes on for hours and, instead of just doing nothing, he closes his eyes, focusing not on the scent of blood in the air, but on the memories of sea and storm that eased his own soul. Eventually, even that gets boring and he decides to take a look at the stone slab that the angel had given him.</p><p>The letters rearrange themselves before him, the familiar telltale of Allspeak, the tongue of the gods. A lot of it is blacked out, like he noted before, which won’t be a problem, but it was still worrying that someone had managed to get past Alfheim’s defenses when the angels were so hell bent on protecting their home...</p><p>“He will live.” A voice stated in front of him, making him flinch.. “His vitals seem to be stable, but I did what I could.” The man that had been operating the other has taken off his gloves, washed his hands and put on some glasses. “...Who are you?” It takes him a couple of seconds to process that the man is staring right at him, but, when it does, he doesn’t bother to hide his genuine curiosity.<br/> “How can you see me?”<br/> “I can’t. I can, however, sense where you are, you know? Your angelic energy.” He said calmly. “Now, will you answer my question?”<br/> “...Harry.” The emerald eyed male announced, although the name sounded foreign, even to him. When was the last time that he had even said it? Nowadays, the angels referred to him as ‘master’ and the two goddesses that he knew, Hecate and Lachesis, called him ‘death’.<br/> “So you’re a new one.” The statement took the Master of Death by surprise.<br/> “New one?”<br/> “A new angel, you guys aren’t usually so talkative.” When Harry didn’t respond, the man sighed and turned on his heel, staring at a nearby, small mirror. “I’m Yinsen, although you probably knew that.”</p><p>As a matter of fact, no, Harry didn’t know that, but when did the angels tell him anything? He didn’t know that they spoke to humans as well. It looked like he still had a lot to learn. Since Yinsen seemed relatively unbothered by his presence and technically disembodied voice, he was going to hazard the guess that he did this often....</p><p>“...Do you know when he will wake up?”<br/> “I can’t really tell, I don’t really have any equipment to measure his vitals with that much accuracy.”</p><p>He nodded to himself and stood up, slowly getting closer to the man that was on the table. His name flashed in his mind, fresh from having read it from the stone tablet: Anthony Edward Stark.</p><p>The name sent chills down his spine.</p><p>He closes his eyes and slumps next to him, letting his eyes flicker golden for the briefest of seconds to check on his overall health. His soul was weak, but it was no longer shrinking in size, so he wasn’t actively dying. A part of him dreaded having to find all of these souls with how prone they were to getting in life-threatening trouble...but alas, a job is a job...</p><p>As he started to doze off, deep in thought, a pair of blue eyes opened, shining, for a brief moment, as if they were fluorescent. As soon as the glow came, however, it disappeared, leaving in their stead a disoriented Tony Stark.</p><p> </p><p>
