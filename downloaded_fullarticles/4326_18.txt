    <p>There he was again. Tall, dark, and smug. She peered at him through narrowed eyes as he sat there eating his dinner, cutting his steak into small pre-measured bites. <em>Who even does that?</em> Tom Riddle was quickly becoming the bane of her existence. He had transferred to Hogwarts from, Durmstrang, a rival prep school at the beginning of the year, and from the moment he had been introduced to her, she took an instant disliking to him. Everything about him irked her, from his perfectly coiffed black curly hair that fell over one eye as if he had done it on purpose, his perfectly sculpted features that could rival the Statue of David, to his utterly perfect grades. Perfect. He was <em>fucking perfect</em>, and it pissed her off to no end.</p><p>She managed to pull her gaze away from him, and stabbed her own steak with more force than necessary, cutting it into large misshapen chunks. As she scooped some mashed potatoes onto her fork before stabbing a chunk of steak, she smirked to herself shaking her head, as the thought popped into her head, <em>'I bet he doesn't even let the food on his plate touch</em>.'</p><p>"Hermione." A voice from across the table called out to her</p><p>She shook herself from her thoughts of Riddle, and met the green eyes of her best friend, Harry Potter.</p><p>"Um…you were doing it again." He said smirking at her as he bit into a dinner roll.</p><p>"Doing what, exactly?" she asked in irritation moving her eyes back to her plate</p><p>"Staring at Riddle." Harry said with a grin.</p><p>"No I bloody well wasn't. Pfft, <em>Riddle</em>. He's a wanker, Harry." Hermione said with distaste, wrinkling her nose for good measure.</p><p>"If you say so." He said wiping his mouth with a napkin and stood up, "I'm heading back to the common room, you coming?"</p><p>She sighed, glancing down at her bag that was full to bursting, "No, I'm on my way to the library from here. If I don't start that paper for Professor Sinestra tonight, I'll never get it done on time."</p><p>"Hermione, you do know that paper isn't due until the end of term, right?" He asked lifting an eyebrow.</p><p>Yes, she bloody well did know that, but there was no way she was going to let Riddle show her up; that twat-waffle probably already had his finished.</p><p>"Yes, Harry, I do. You realize that end of term is next week, right? Unlike you, I don't like to procrastinate." She said as she flung her bag over her shoulder and winced at the weight of her books.</p><p>"Fine, I'll see you later then, I guess." He said as he made his way up the stairs while she continued on towards the library. Surprisingly, for a Friday evening, the library was packed with students. She huffed in annoyance as she made a bee-line towards the back of the library, to her secret study spot. The small private study room, which was in the far corner of the library, was a hidden gem that most students didn't even know existed. Wanting nothing more than to immerse herself in her work without being disturbed, she closed the door behind her and dropped her bag on the nearby chair. The problem with being the Head Girl, was that every student that had a question, or needed help, automatically gravitated to her, often cutting into her own study time. Normally it wouldn't bother her, but ever since <em>he</em> arrived, she had to work a lot harder than usual to remain at the top of the class. Currently, to her great displeasure, they were tied for the top spot, and it would be a cold day in hell that she would relinquish the honor of being named Valedictorian. Seven Bloody years she had held that spot, she wasn't about to lose it now. Tom Riddle would have to get used to the idea of being second best.</p><p>She was so immersed in her reading, she hadn't noticed anyone had entered the room until she heard the door click shut. Without lifting her eyes from her book, she said, "No, the library does not have a loo, and no, you may not enter the restricted section without a pass." flipping the page she had just read absently.</p><p>"While I assure you I have no current need of a loo, I am well aware that the restricted section is called such for a reason, Miss Granger." A smooth voice responded that made her freeze.</p><p>Hermione's gaze slid from her book, and traveled up his freakishly tall frame, to meet his eyes which were looking at her expectantly, his mouth set in a firm line.</p><p>"Riddle. What do you want?" she snapped without any pretense of politeness.</p><p>The corner of his lips twitched at her tone, as he set his bag down by his feet, pulling out the chair across from her and taking a seat.</p><p>"What makes you think I <em>want</em> anything?" he said raising one perfectly sculpted eyebrow at her as he proceeded to place his books and notebook on the table in front of him.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, not missing the way his eyes flitted over her and the subtle implication of his words.</p><p>"This room is taken. Please do close the door on your way out." She said dismissively as if shooing away a pesky insect.</p><p>Looking back down at her book, she missed the look of indignation that flitted over his face before he masked his expression to one of cool indifference.</p><p>"I see no sign on the door with your name on it, Granger, in fact, I think I'll be using this room more often now that I know it's here. It's much quieter than the rest of the library." He said curving his lips into a smug smile; one that she wanted to reach across the table, and slap off of his perfect face.</p><p>"Joy." She said sarcastically and made another attempt to ignore him.</p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, one of the primary responsibilities of the Head Girl is to make new students feel welcome. I'd hate to have to report you, given my rather frosty reception." He said leaning back in his chair with his arms folded across his broad chest, his eyes narrowed issuing a silent challenge.</p><p>Hermione slammed her pen down onto her notebook, and plastered an overly fake smile on her face before she stood, giving him a small curtsy, "Oh, I'm sorry, my lord, I regret that we're fresh out of red carpets at the moment, is there anything else I can get you to make your stay here more comfortable? A foot massage perhaps?" Hermione spat sarcastically as she planted her hands firmly on her hips.</p><p>Tom's lips twitched into a smirk, "We'll, it would be a start, I suppose."</p><p>Hermione let out a frustrated sigh, and muttered something under her breath before retaking her seat that Tom could swear sounded suspiciously like '<em>pretentious douchebag'</em>.</p><p>"Have I done something to offend you?" he asked, unwilling to drop it until he knew exactly what her problem with him was.</p><p>She lifted her eyes to his once again, and felt a pang of guilt at the look he was giving her, until she remembered how he used the very same look to suck up to all their professors.</p><p>"As if you didn't know." She spat, leaning back in her chair to meet his gaze defiantly.</p><p>"Actually, I don't. That's why I asked." He said looking at her expectantly.</p><p>Hermione sighed, "Look, Riddle, I get that you're new here, and you're trying to make an impression and all that, but I've worked too long and too hard for you to come in here and fuck everything up for me."</p><p>He raised his eyebrows at her bluntness, "Fuck what up, exactly?"</p><p>"Oh drop the act, you know perfectly well what I'm talking about. I've been top of the class for the past seven bloody years, and I'm not about to come in second place to some perfect-looking, pretentious, smug, arsehole." Hermione seethed.</p><p>His eyes widened, "What did you just call me?"</p><p>"An Arsehole." Hermione repeated giving him a smug smile of her own as if to say, '<em>yeah, I said it, what are you going to do about it?'</em></p><p>"No, not that part…did you just say that I was…<em>perfect-looking</em>?" He asked leaning forward in his seat, his lips curving into a knowing smirk.</p><p>"No, of course not, I…<em>what?</em>" She asked with a look of dawning horror on her face. <em>Had she actually said that out loud?</em></p><p>"Yes you did, you called me, and I quote, 'a perfect-looking, pretentious, smug arsehole.'" Tom repeated, enjoying watching her squirm for a change.</p><p>"Oh for the love of Merlin, I just called you an arsehole, and that is what you took away from it? " Hermione said shaking her head as she picked up her pen, intent on trying to deflect.</p><p>"You're not denying it though…"he said in a casual tone as he leaned back again in his chair, tapping his chin with his fingertip as he studied her.</p><p>She lifted her gaze to his once more, "Just because I can admit that you are easy on the eyes, doesn't mean that I find you attractive. In fact, your personality is so repulsive, I daresay that if I have to be subjected to your inane comments for another minute, I might just throw up in my mouth." She spat, with a triumphant look as her words wiped the smirk off his face.</p><p>"Well, Lord knows we wouldn't want that, your breath smells bad enough as it is." He retorted wrinking his nose in disgust.</p><p>Hermione's mouth dropped open and she scoffed at his insult, "Yeah? Well, if my breath is so terrible, why are you still sitting here bothering me?" she asked and raised an eyebrow at him expectantly.</p><p>"Because I felt that it was my duty to tell you. Really Granger, haven't you ever heard of a breath mint?" He said rising from his seat and taking a step towards her.</p><p>Not one to back down from a challenge, she stood from her own seat, closing the distance between them until they were practically nose to nose, "Look who's talking, Riddle, everything that comes out of your mouth is utter bullshit."</p><p>His lips crashed into hers with a bruising intensity, and her hands moved up of their own accord to tangle in his hair as she kissed him back hungrily. She squeaked in surprise when his arm shot out and swept everything from the table onto the floor, hoisting her up onto the edge in front of him.</p><p>He tore his lips away from hers, and yanked her head back by a fistful of her hair, dragging his teeth over her neck as he parted her legs to stand between them.</p><p>His lips brushed against her throat, and she sucked her bottom lip between her teeth when he rolled his hips into hers, letting her feel his arousal.</p><p>"If I knew that this was all it would take to shut you up, I would've done it ages ago." He chuckled brushing his lips against the shell of her ear.</p><p>"I swear you love to hear yourself talk, Riddle. I can think of a far better use for that mouth of yours." Hermione shot back and then tugged his earlobe between her teeth as she lifted her legs to wrap around his waist.</p><p>"Why you impertinent little wretch" he said thrusting his hips into hers again, enjoying the way her eyes rolled back and she gasped in pleasure.</p><p>"Yeah? What are you going to do about it?" she said in a husky tone as she grabbed his Slytherin tie pulling his lips down to hers once more. She knew she won that round when he groaned into her mouth his hand leaving her hair to trail down her spine possessively.</p><p>He guided her down onto the table, deftly popping open the buttons of her school blouse as his teeth scraped over her hardened nipple through the fabric of her bra.</p><p>"Lock the door." Hermione whispered as she met his lust filled gaze with one of her own.</p><p>He smirked up at her, before he took a step away from her to make sure the door was indeed locked. When he turned back to face her, she was leaning up on her elbows, looking completely fuckable. Her skin was flushed, lips swollen from his kisses, and he caught a flash of her innocent white cotton knickers from under her short plaid skirt as she shifted to get more comfortable.</p><p>As he approached her once more, he ran his hands up her thighs, pushing her legs farther apart before slipping his hand into her knickers to rub her clit. He practically growled with need when he felt how wet she was for him. Her head fall back against her shoulders as she rocked her hips forward against his hand, letting out a soft moan as his slender fingers slipped into her.</p><p>"Fuck, you're perfect." He whispered against her throat as he pumped his fingers into her, feeling her muscles tighten around him as she shuddered in response. She grabbed ahold of his tie again, pulling him in for another kiss before loosening it and slipping it from his neck. Her hands trembled with need as she clumsily began to unbutton his oxford, while he continued to bring her closer to her orgasm. He felt her whole body tense just before she came with a strangled cry, and she watched him through hooded eyes as he slipped his fingers into his mouth to taste her essence.</p><p>"Please tell me you have a condom" she said unable to wait much longer.</p><p>He froze, realizing he did not, in fact, have a condom on him. He was sure he had some back in his dorm room, but that wouldn't help at the moment.</p><p>"I uh…don't' actually… Have one on me that is." He said gritting his teeth in frustration.</p><p>"Fuck." Hermione said as she let her head drop back down to the table with an audible thump.</p><p>"Apparently not." Tom sighed leaning against the table next to her, annoyed that things had come to a screeching halt.</p><p>Hermione sat up and noticed his still bulging trousers, and bit her lip nervously.</p><p>"I um…I could maybe…you know, help you with that?" she said pointing towards his crotch awkwardly.</p><p>His eyes darkened at the thought, "Have you ever done it before?"</p><p>"Well, no, but how hard can it be?" she shrugged, hopping off the table to stand in front of him.</p><p>"Very hard, I assure you" he said giving her a naughty grin.</p><p>She knelt down in front of him, reaching for his buckle, her brow furrowed in concentration. Never let it be said that Hermione Granger does anything by halves.</p><p>As she unzipped his pants, and pulled his boxers down a bit, she had a small moment of panic when she came face to face with his cock. It was much bigger than she expected it to be, and she realized she had no idea, other than the 'putting it in her mouth' part, how to please him.</p><p>"So I just…suck on it then?" she asked, her small hand wrapping around his cock as he let out a hiss.</p><p>"Christ, Granger, your hands are cold."</p><p>She glared up at him and then refocused herself on her task, "alright then, he we go." She muttered parting her lips and taking the head of his cock into her mouth.</p><p>As soon as her tongue made contact with his cock, he jerked his hips forward practically gagging her.</p><p>"Bloody Hell…" he groaned fisting his hands into her hair.</p><p>She soon found a rhythm he seemed to like, sucking him in as far as she could, and then allowing him to draw back and thrust in again. Periodically, she swirled her tongue around the tip, which to her delight caused him to groan every time she did it. Before long, his movements became more erratic, and his breathing more shallow as he squeezed his eyes shut, leaning back to grip the table with both hands.</p><p>"Fuck, I'm coming…" he managed to say just as she felt the salty liquid coat the back of her throat.</p><p>She wasn't sure what the proper etiquette was in this circumstance; should she swallow it, or wait until he was finished and casually spit it out? Not seeing any way around it, she swallowed, her eyes watering from the effort.</p><p>As she stood, wiping the excess drool from her chin, she picked up his discarded tie and handed it to him with a smirk.</p><p>"Well, you certainly earned your title." He remarked casually, giving her a naughty grin.</p><p>"What title?" she asked in confusion as she buttoned her blouse and smoothed her hands through her riotous hair.</p><p>"Head Girl." Tom chuckled and she slapped him playfully on the arm as he tucked his shirt back in and straightened his tie.</p><p>An awkward silence descended on them, as he watched her pack up her bag, surely there was no way she could concentrate on her paper after what they had just done.</p><p>"So um…I don't suppose you…well, I mean, you don't have to if you don't want to…" he stammered</p><p>She bit back a smirk at seeing him so uncharacteristically flustered.</p><p>"Spit it out, Riddle." She said biting back a grin</p><p>He glanced down at his feet, giving her a genuine smile for the first time, and her heart stuttered to a stop. He had fucking dimples. <em>Of course he did</em>.</p><p>"I was wondering if you wanted to go to Hogsmeade with me tomorrow…if you aren't going with someone else that is…" he said meeting her eyes again with a look that was so hopeful, it made her chest constrict.</p><p>"You want to go to Hogsmeade with <em>me</em>?" she asked in disbelief</p><p>"Obviously, otherwise I wouldn't have asked." he chuckled</p><p>She eyed him speculatively weighing the pros and cons of accepting his offer. There had to be an angle; Tom Riddle did nothing without purpose.</p><p>"Really Granger, it's only Hogsmeade, not a marriage proposal." He said lifting is bag over his shoulder and giving her an annoyed look.</p><p>"Okay then." She finally said and he seemed to relax.</p><p>"Good. I'll pick you up at eleven. Oh, before I forget to ask, did you by chance finish the paper that Professor Sinestra assigned?" He asked giving her a questioning look.</p><p>"No, I was going to start it tonight, but <em>someone</em> distracted me…" she laughed.</p><p>He smirked, "Oh. Well, seeing as how I've already finished, I'd be happy to look it over for you before you turn it in." He said nonchalantly as he turned and opened the door, before he tossed "See you tomorrow, Granger." Over his shoulder as he walked away.</p><p>She stood there gaping after him, wishing she had something to throw. Of course he'd finished the damn paper a week early, the twat-waffle.</p><p>As she headed up the stairs to her dorm that night, she couldn't help but allow herself a small secretive smile at the thought of how she'd thoroughly messed up his perfectly perfect hair.</p>
