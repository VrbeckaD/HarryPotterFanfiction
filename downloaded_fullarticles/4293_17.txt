    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Dudley opened the door to his modest home, grunting slightly as he leaned over to gather the bundle of letters collected under the mail slot. Although he had lost a few pounds since his school days, he was still much more like his father in appearance than his stick-thin mother. His fiancée Grace had yet to arrive home from her day job at the hair parlor in town, for as it was Friday, he was home first. The quiet of the house was both calming and slightly unnerving. Ever since moving from his parents’ home, he had had to learn how to handle a silent room. Between his father’s bellowing tones and his mother’s constant chirps (and his own tantrums, his brain unhappily pointed out), there had been scarcely a still moment within the walls of Number Four. The only quiet one in the house had been Harry, who either wasn’t there at all or was shuffling quietly around the outskirts of the room.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Getting closer to his twenty-fourth birthday, it had been years since Dudley had heard anything from his cousin. Since his stumbling goodbye in his teenage years, the two had barely exchanged a few sentences. In a way, it seemed for the best to Dudley. There was not much he could do to repent for the years of torment he had put Harry through, and he was never much good at apologizing anyway. Harry had sent him a postcard or two, vague on details of his current life but letting him know that everything was going well, and Dudley had responded in kind. Grace had urged him to reach out. She kept telling him that the only way to forgive himself was to reconnect with his cousin. But Dudley knew that as much as he loved her, he didn’t really think she understood the situation. Harry probably wanted to hear from Dudley just about as much as Dudley wanted to talk to Harry—that is, not much at all.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> He wondered why his thoughts were focusing so much on his cousin as he glanced at the photos on the mantlepiece for the one that contained his family, tossing the mail on the table without glancing at it. There was Grace with all of her sisters, photos of the two of them from their university days, and there—the Dursleys. His father and mother stood at his shoulders, smiling emptily for the camera. Harry was squeezed into the corner of the photo, reluctantly included in the face of the judgmental face of the photographer. He was barely smiling, doing the absolute minimum to not be scolded for being sullen. He guessed they were eleven or twelve in this photo. Dudley’s old shirt hung off of Harry’s skinny frame, and his hair was as wild as always.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Dudley let out a huff of a breath and set about making some stew for dinner. Grace loved stew in the winter, and since he had half days at the firm on Fridays he had begun to make them for her so she had hot food once she arrived. He still couldn’t believe he had ever managed to meet someone like her. Once he had moved out of Little Whinging, he had felt lost at university without his gang to back him up. No one seemed to take him seriously at all, in fact. He remembered wishing his mother had never forced him to attend, but she had claimed that he needed to be successful like his father, and that successful men attended university. It was one of the few things she had ever pushed him so firmly towards, and he had had few options in her iron grip. Without his parents’ watchful eyes and his friends’ faithful presence, though, it seemed doomed to be four years of lonely days.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Then, he had met Grace. She was the brightest student in his business classes and he had mumbled some request for tutoring, and she had smiled brightly and taken him under her wing. He knew his mother would never approve entirely of her boundless energy and frenetic lifestyle, but he couldn’t love it more. Besides, as he grew up, he had realized that his parents were wrong about many things. Things like Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> He lost himself in thought as he chopped broccoli and tossed it into the pot, stirring occasionally. He was thinking about one night at the bar closest to the university, hunched over a beer with his now-girlfriend. One of the waiters had messy black hair and glasses, and he jokingly remarked to her that he looked just like Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Who’s Harry?” she had asked confusedly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “My cousin, of course! You know, the one I grew up with.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You grew up with your cousin? I thought you were the only kid in your house growing up. I guess maybe your house was closer to mine than I thought,” she laughed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “No… No, it was plenty different,” he said sullenly, the alcohol making him feel depressed the way it often did later into the evening.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Your parents don’t talk about him much,” she remarked, and he could tell she was probing slightly. He often told her she would make a better psychology major than cosmetology, and she told him to stuff it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “No, they wouldn’t,” he agreed. If she wanted answers, he was going to make her work for it, he thought stubbornly. If he had been more sober, he would have been more tactful—and wouldn’t have brought up Harry in the first place, he thought to himself as he continued to stir the browning greens for the stew. Now, he was glad he had, but at the time he had begun to realize that this was leading to a conversation he didn’t want to have with a girl he really liked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Dudley,” she said with a sigh. “Either tell me or don’t. I’m not going to deal with you being mad at me over something <em>you </em>brought up.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You’re right, you’re right,” he said, hands slightly up in mock surrender. “I’m sorry, I think I just forgot I never talked about him before. It’s a bit of a touchy subject, I guess, but it’s not a secret. You should probably know, though. Maybe it’ll tell you what kind of person I really am,” he said, only very slightly joking.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> She looked at him with curiosity gleaming in her brown eyes. He pinched his nose with his fingers. God, he loved her so much, which was why he didn’t want to tell her his terrible shame.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Go on!” she said, failing to disguise her eagerness as concern. He waved her off jokingly. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Come off it, this is serious,” he said gruffly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “A secret cousin? How could it not be?” she said brightly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I told you, he’s not a secret! His parents died when we were both babies, and then my parents took him in, basically. He grew up with me until he turned seventeen, and then he left.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “So you basically had a brother your whole life? How come no one talks about it? Did he run off with some girl or something? Was he some kind of juvenile delinquent, is that why no one talks about him?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Grace…” he said, sighing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> She examined his face closely. “I’m—I’m sorry. I can tell that this really is serious. I’m a bit drunk as well, I think,” she said, still cheery but more subdued. He smiled at her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “No, it’s okay, I can’t imagine how weird this sounds to someone else. No, he—he went to a special boarding school once he turned eleven, one for—gifted children. So he wasn’t around for most of the year, and when he could he spent vacations away from home. Once he turned seventeen, he just—he um—he walked straight into a job, I suppose you could say. And he never looked back. He and my parents, um, didn’t get on. I didn’t really get on with him either, but that was my fault. I was a right git to him when we were younger. He doesn’t talk to me anymore.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> She looked at him, face full of surprise. “Wow, that was more dramatic than I was expecting, actually. Why didn’t he get along with your family?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> He rolled his eyes. “Have you met them?” She laughed, but still waited for a response. “My parents—they didn’t really want him, you know, because they really had no choice when<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>his parents died. And I know that’s not Harry’s fault, now, but at the time they really just treated him like a burden. They thought he was—dangerous…” He trailed off, completely unsure as to how to explain the situation to her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Dangerous?” she asked bemusedly. “As a kid? Did he like, kill pets or something?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “No, it wasn’t like that,” he assured her. “He was, special. They thought it was bad at the time, and so did I. But it wasn’t. He’s a good guy, really. He saved my life once.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “He <em>what?”</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Oh, yeah, there were some… criminals, near our house. They attacked the two of us and Harry fought them off. He could have left me, and had every right to, honestly, but he didn’t. After that, I… re-evaluated. I realized that my parents had been awful to him for no reason, really, and that I had been a huge arse. And then, a few years later, he left. I tried to tell him that I was sorry, when he did. And I think he knew. He was always smarter than me, I think.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Grace looked at him, eyes seeming to see through all his layers of deception. “Huh,” she said. “That is… not something I would have expected, when I met you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> He chuckled darkly. “Really? You didn’t gather that I had very recently begun recovery from being a horrible bullying git?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> She let out a belly laugh. “No, that part I figured. Secret special brother-cousin, however, I had not guessed.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Dudley smiled to himself in his kitchen, hearing her laugh echo through his mind. He couldn’t believe she hadn’t left him, through all these years. Telling her about his past seemed to make everything simpler, smoothing out rough edges he hadn’t been able to understand for years. Through many late nights of slightly-tipsy confessions, she had tried to help him realize things about his cousin he had never known. She told him she thought that Harry knew that Dudley was just following in his parents’ footsteps. She told him that she thought Harry knew that Dudley was still a child, even if Harry had grown up. She told him, over and over, that she thought Dudley should meet with Harry (totally unmotivated, she falsely promised, by the desire to meet this mysterious stranger who was also, in part, her family).</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Dudley, darling, I’m home!” she called loudly from the front door as it swung open and made a huge banging noise as it hit the wall. She never opened it with the caution to avoid the growing dent in the hallway. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I could hear you from down the block!” he called back jokingly. She walked into the kitchen and pressed her hands to the back of his neck. They were ice cold and he flinched and shivered. “You’re terrible!” he cried in protest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I’m coooold,” she responded. “Stew! You wonderful, wonderful man.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “How was the parlor?” he asked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Same old, same old. Did you grab the mail? I didn’t see it when I came in and I want to check if the electrical company has stopped sending us those—oh there it is,” she said, sentence distracted by sighting the mail on the dining room table. She walked over and flipped through the letters, and he could hear the paper scratching as he had his back to her stirring the stew. It was nearly to the point where he could leave it for a few hours before they ate dinner, when they would curl up in front of the television and watch whatever late-night talkshow she was interested in.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Dudley?” she called in a somewhat strangled tone. “Darling, I—I think you might want to see this.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Her tone worried him instantly. “Is everything all right? What’s the matter?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “No, no—it’s not bad. Just come here.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> He left the wooden spoon leaning against the stew pot and walked into the dining room. Her face was inscrutable aside from the obvious shock, and she was holding a white envelope with delicate gold decoration on it. <em>Save the Date, </em>it declared.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> She handed him the darker gold card that had presumably been inside of the envelope. He flicked it open with no small amount of apprehension, and was stunned at what lay inside.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Harry’s face smiled up at him, next to a beautiful red-haired freckled woman who vaguely resembled some blurry figures in his memory who had once blown up his fireplace. The picture shocked him so much he could barely read the caption. Once he had, however, he felt as if the universe were rooting him to his spot on his hardwood floor, feet feeling heavy with the weight of the words.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Harry Potter</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>&amp;</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Ginny Weasley</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>invite you to join them </em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>for the celebration of their </em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center"><span class="s1"><em>wedding.</em></span> </p><p class="p3" align="center"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Dudley’s mouth hung open as he gazed down at the elegant paper, the cousin he had not seen or spoken to in many years smiling back up at him. Harry looked… older, but not in the way Dudley felt he himself did. When Dudley looked in the mirror, he hated seeing the lines appear on his face. He felt he would never look as energetic as he had when he was a teenager, although he was only twenty-three. Harry, on the other hand, looked better than he ever had. He and his soon-to-be-wife looked like they fit together like two pieces of a puzzle as they stood in each other’s arms. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> He looked at his own fiancée, his shock mirrored on her face. Suddenly, a smile broke through her face. “We have to go!” she declared.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Y-yeah,” he said. “I mean—I’m going to go. I just can’t believe he…” he muttered as he stared at the card. He reached for the envelope from her hands, wanting to touch everything to make sure it was real. Was this some kind of prank, where Harry had magicked the paper to turn into a glitter bomb or something? But Dudley knew Harry would never even have done that when they were kids. This was the kind of gesture that Grace had been urging him to make. An olive branch.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Inside the envelope, he saw a thin piece of paper that she had missed in her eagerness to open the card. There was a short letter penned in a messy scrawl in green ink.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Dudley,</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>I know we haven’t talked much, and this is probably a lot. But we’re family, so if you would like to come, please do. If not, don’t worry, it’s fine and I understand. I heard you got engaged as well, so feel free to bring your fiancée. I would like to meet her, and Ginny would like to meet you. Most people will be writing back by owl post, but you can send your reply to the address on the back and I’ll make sure I get it.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Harry</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>P.S. I’m not planning on mentioning this to Petunia and Vernon. In the interest of preserving whatever good will I have left with them, it would be great if you could avoid the subject with them, no matter what your decision is.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Grace had been looking curiously at the paper in his hands, so he handed it to her once he was done reading. “Jeez, you weren’t kidding. He doesn’t even seem like he expects you to come to his wedding,” she said. “And he didn’t even invite your parents.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “He probably doesn’t,” said Dudley shortly. “And I can understand why he didn’t.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “At least you two are on better terms than him and Petunia and Vernon. You said you left on a pretty decent note the last time you saw him in person, right?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> He huffed a laugh. “I told him I didn’t think he was a waste of space, I suppose. Not sure that quite made up for seventeen years of torment.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Well, write him straight away then. I’ve been telling you, but now he’s made the first move and it’s all moving forward, which is fantastic. It’ll be good for both of you to have a chat, as I’ve been saying. What’s this ‘owl post’ he’s talking about?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Ah,” said Dudley, realizing that perhaps Grace attending this wedding was going to require some explanations he had never quite provided her with the exact nature of Harry’s “special qualities.” He didn’t want her to think she was hallucinating when—when rabbits came jumping out of top hats, or whatever happened at a magic wedding. “I think maybe you should sit down.”</span>
