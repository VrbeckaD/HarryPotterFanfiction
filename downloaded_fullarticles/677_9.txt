    <p>Tom was laying in a boat. Above him thousands of stars looked back at him. He could feel the gentle breeze running alongside his pale face, and playing with his dark hair a little. The ocean was quiet and calm, he could only hear sometines the squeak of the boat as it peacefuly flow on the surface of the ocean. In the water he saw the reflection of the stars.<br/>
He did not know how did he get there, but he didn't have to. He was just enjoying the moment. He closed his eyes and breathed out. Yes he defenetly enjoyed this.<br/>
As he was about to let go all of his problems, he started to feel like the wind become to become stronger. He opened his eyes and sat up curiously to see wats going on. To his surprise, the sky was slowly being covered by dark thick clouds, and the boat's squeaks were no longer relaxing. The water also started to wave faster, and without the stars on it it was dark, cold and scary. Tom felt a shiver run up his spine as a lightning crossed the clouds. The sound was so loud Tom felt the boat trembling. This was not good.<br/>
The waves were growing bigger and bigger, until they rose above Tom's head. Tom's eyes widened as the wave jumped at him like a hungry tiger, tearing apart his boat. He fell into the water.<br/>
The cold cut into his flesh like a knife, and the water soaked his clothes, making them heavier. He tried to advance himself upwards, but once he reached the surface another wave pushed him back into the darkness. As the panic started to spread in him, like snake venom, he felt his mouth open to a scream for help. The black water entered his mouth making it imposible to breathe. He felt the cold liquid fill his throat and lungs, and the more he fought the more pain came. The water stretched his lungs, suffocating him without mercy, and the chill just kept stabbing every part of his body.<br/>
His eyes started to close, and with that his body became numb. And then... the pain stopped. He opened his eyes once again. There was total darkness, and he both felt cold on the insied and in the outside. There was total darkness, and he both felt cold on the inside and in the outside. But these things were no longer frightening. Instead they were soothing. He looked at his hands, amd those  looked like long legged white spiders. His eyes were crimson colored, and his skin was white as well. He felt likeinside of his lungs ice grow, and it started to spreading. The ice covered his heart like a blanket, and his brain was surrounded by the black water.<br/>
He looked up. The stars have returned to the sky, but he no longer wanted to bathe in their light. It was so much better deep in the ocean. There were no waves to push him down, no false light which he couldn't reach. It was easier to be here. So he stayed. In the cold darkness.</p>
