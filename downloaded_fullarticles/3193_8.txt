    <p>I was walking along the platform, pushing a trolley that contained my trunk and a few extra bags full of books. I was looking around at King's Cross and saw nothing that hinted anything magical. I had been out of the magical community since Professor Flitwick had come to my house at the beginning of the summer and told my parents that I was indeed a wizard. My older sister, Josie, had not spoken to me since, worried that I would be about to curse her or something, but  did not. Honestly, I did not know how to curse her yet, but considering how annoying she was, I wouldn't tell you that I would never think about it.  </p><p>  I walked up and down the platform with my mother. We were looking for "Platform 9 and Three Quarters" but we couldn't. I thought that we should ask someone who worked here where to go, but my mother said we would simply look like idiots. I rolled my eyes and continued to walk around. We mainly strolled near platforms 9 and 10, looking for hints of other wizards. Either they were extremely good at blending in with the everyday people wandering around, or there was none around. I puffed. "What time is it?" I asked.</p><p>"Quarter to eleven," my mother said.</p><p>"And the train leaves at eleven?" I asked.</p><p>"Yes," my mother said. I leant my head against the wall and puffed.</p><p>  Eventually, we spotted a little family nearing us. The man was broad, with ginger hair while his wife was stocky with black hair tied back in braids. A few people seemed to be staring at them as they passed, but I didn't know why. They looked perfectly ordinary to me. They had a son and a daughter walking between them. Both were naturally tanned, due to their mixed raced parents, and neither had their father's hair. Both were brunets and they were talking rapidly to themselves. Not only did I hear the girl talk about flying brooms as she past, but also in the boy's trolley was a cage holding a large barn owl. My mother and I walked backwards as the family walked towards us. The mother and the daughter ran through the wall between the platforms before disappearing. I raised an eyebrow.  The man and his son copied them and immediately a group of people followed. "Do we just run?" I asked.</p><p>"It seems so," replied my mother. I bit my lip and ran towards the wall. I closed my eyes and prepared for impact, but I did not hit the wall. Instead, I ended up on another platform. "Wow," my mother said, staring at the red train that was against the platform. </p><p>  As we made our way along the platform, I noticed a large crowd surrounding what appeared to be a pretty regular family. The man was slightly taller than his wife and he had messy, black hair. The woman had ginger hair, like her daughter, while their sons had the father's hair. The crowd surrounding them was blocking our walkway. I pulled my blue beanie over my own ginger hair and the acne littering my forehead as we walked past. My mother took control of the trolley and I walked behind her as she pushed it. When we finally found a carriage where the door was open. "Climb on," my mother said. I nodded and jumped onto the train. My mother pushed the trunk up to me and I began to pull it on. I accidentally hit a short boy with messy, brown hair wearing a woolen jumper. "Watch it," he said.</p><p>"Sorry," I told him. </p><p>"Right," he said, walking over my trunk and walking away. My mother continued to push the trunk until it was fully on the train. "Go get a seat," she said, looking at her watch. I nodded and carried my trunk down the hallway. I looked in one or two carriages and found that they were filled with students, all talking to one another. I made my way back down the train and noticed that in one compartment there were only three boys. They were talking rapidly to one another, but the bench opposite them was free. Slowly, I opened the door and smiled. "Can I sit here?" I asked. The older of the three boys nodded. He had brown hair that lay flat on his head and he was wearing what looked like pyjamas. The boy sitting next to him had identical brown hair and similar green eyes. He was reading a book that was on his lap. The third boy had ruffled, black hair and he was staring out of the window. I awkwardly sat opposite them and stared down at my feet. I looked out at the glass door to see children walking down the hallway. I slowly followed them and found the door where my mother was waiting. I took my bag of books from her and smiled. "I'll write," she said. I smiled again. "I will too," I told her. </p><p>  I waited for the train to begin to move before walking back to the compartment. The older boy was talking to the boy by the window while the third was still read his book. I stared out of the window as the train picked up speed.  "How long is the journey?" the boy reading asked, closing the book on his lap.  "I don't know," the older one said.   The boy by the window shrugged and glanced at his watch. </p><p>  A little old woman pushing a trolley of confectionery stopped outside our compartment about two hours later. The older boy stood up and pulled open the door.  "Three pumpkin pasties, two chocolate frogs and a packet of Bertie Botts every flavour beans," he said, handing the woman some silver coins I recently learnt were called Sickles. "What's that?" the child by the window asked, eyeing the food the older was holding. "Snacks," he replied. "Anything for anyone else?" the old woman asked.  "Can I have two chocolate frogs, two packets of Bertie Bott's Beans, one packet of Fizzing Whizzbees, a packet of peppermint toads and two pumpkin pasties please," said the boy in the middle. The woman nodded and handed the boy what he ordered, taking the money. "Um... can I have um... three pasties and three chocolate frogs?" the third boy asked. The woman nodded and handed him the confectionery. I stood up and studied the trolley. "Um... can I have a pasty, a frog, a packet of beans some fudge flies and a packet of peppermint toads?" I requested. The woman nodded. I handed her a handful of gold galleons and took my food, along with the silver change.  I returned to my seat. "What is this stuff?" the kid by the window asked. He pulled open the packet of Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans and stared within. "Watch those," the older boy said. "I mean it. They mean every flavour and you want to be careful." The boy nodded and put his packet onto the ground, before opening the frog.  "Hey, you," the older boy said. I raised an eyebrow. "Yes," I said.</p><p>"Can I have one of your fudge flies?" he asked. </p><p>"Sure," I said. The boy jumped off his seat and took one of the fudge flies out of my packet. "Thanks," he said.</p><p>"It's okay," I told him. </p><p>"Can I have a toad?" the boy beside him asked.</p><p>"Honestly Adam," the older boy said.</p><p>"Sure," I shrugged. </p><p>"Thanks," he said, taking a peppermint toad out of the packet I had beside me.  "Have you had these before?" the older boy asked, pointing to the Fizzing Wizzbees beside him. I shook my head. "I've never had any of this before," I said. All three stared at me. "Are you muggle-born?" the older boy asked. I nodded slowly. "I guess you're not," I said. </p><p>"Nah, I'm a pure blood," he said. I had learnt from a Professor when buying my school gear that pure blood meant both of the boy's parents were also wizards. "But my brother, Adam here, is half-blood," he said. "His mother's a muggle." I nodded, not sure what to say. </p><p>"I still don't know what those are," Adam replied, pointing to the Fizzing Whizzbees. His brother laughed.  "I'm Jeffrey Norman," the older boy said. "That's Adam," he said, ruffling Adam's hair. "And the guy scoffing his face is Ben Price." Ben nodded at me. Ben was already half-way through his pasty when I had not tried anything yet. </p><p>  Not too long afterwards, the boy who I had seen earlier with the brown hair, accompanied by the older boy from the family who were surrounded by the crowd on the platform. "Um... hi?" Ben said, watching them. The taller boy from the platform nodded. "Don't mind us," he said. "We're just hiding from some fourth years." </p><p>"Why?" Jeffrey asked. </p><p>"My cousin, Vic, is a fourth year, so we decided to bother her for a bit," the shorter boy said. "But her friends didn't seem to like our jokes." </p><p>"Okay," Adam said, turning his attention back to Ben and continuing their conversation. "What year are you in?" the shorter boy asked, as his companion stared out at the corridor. "Fifth," Jeffrey replied. "Yet you're here?" the shorter boy asked. He nodded. The shorter boy stared at Adam and Ben. "Are you guys first years too?" he asked. Adam and Ben nodded slowly. </p><p>  Shortly after the boys left, we changed into our robes. While Adam, Ben and I wore plain black everything, Jeffrey had a red tie and red linings on his robe. "Why is your uniform red?" I asked.</p><p>"That's the colour of my house," he said.</p><p>"The houses are that important here?" I asked. I remembered  being split into houses for sports day in school, but we only really used those groups for sports day. "Yeah," Jeffrey said. "It's how they sort out where you sleep and who you have lessons with and so on."</p><p>"Oh," I said. "How- how do they group you?" Jeffrey did not respond.  "It can't be too bad, right?" said Ben. "I mean, it is a school." </p><p>"True," I said. I glanced down at my shoes as the train slowed. Ben threw a chocolate frog at me and smiled. I nodded.</p>
