  <em>Happy Living Essential Oils is a Multi-Level Marketing Company. MLMs are insanely popular in today’s market and are completely legitimate.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>What an MLM is not and what Happy Living is not is a pyramid scheme. A scheme implies trickery. Pyramid schemes are scams. A scam is a “dishonest scheme or fraud” but there is nothing fraudulent about a MLM! Everything about the business structure is forthcoming and honest. When you go look at Happy Living’s compensation plan, you can see where all of your dollars go. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>When you are purchasing anything from any MLM, what you are doing is not only supporting the company that made a product, but you’re also supporting your friend.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You’re buying local. You’re helping pay for a little girl’s ballet classes &amp; supper for a family. You’re investing in that little boy’s college fund &amp; school supplies for him. You’re supporting families that you know &amp; so many that you don’t!</em>
</p><p><em>An MLM uses the costs that a company would normally use for marketing &amp; gives it to families so they can build their own dreams &amp; create a business for themselves. It is so far beyond paying big bucks to top level execs, but gives everyone an opportunity to create an income for themselves!</em> <em> </em></p><p>
  <em>Buying from your friend instead of another random company is the biggest investment into them to say, “I believe in you”.</em>
