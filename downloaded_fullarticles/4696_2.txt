    <p>The morning of Samhain, 2005, Mary Fitzpatrick Parker awoke to the sound of her younger son, Harrison, crying loudly. Stumbling to her feet, she walked towards his crib to comfort him. Peter, the older twin, was a slim, quiet child with pale, almost snow white skin, light auburn colored hair and pale gray-green eyes. His physical attributes confused both of his brown-eyed, black haired parents, who, aside from never having had a relative with any of Peter's traits, were fairly big-boned, a stark contrast with Peter's lithe frame. Harrison, on the other hand, had inherited his father's dark, curly hair and his mother's naturally tanned skin and was always fussing about something. Having finally calmed Harry down, Mary peered into Peter's crib to make sure that his sibling's cries had not awoken him. </p>
<p>Peter stared back at her solemnly, then closed his eyes. Mary waited for his breathing to even out before she ascended the stairs to prepare breakfast. As she was deep-frying potatoes to make french-fries, the fire in the kitchen flared silver, indicating that someone was attempting to floo into the house without permission. Reaching for her nine-inch oak gryphon's feather core wand, she leveled it at the fireplace. A second later, the familiar taint of corrupt magic snaked out of the fire. Drawing her wand, Mary sent a wordless Patronus message to Richard, telling him to take the twins and leave. Her pale, barely corporeal sparrow shot of like bullet, flying up towards the bedroom. A moment later, Richard appeared at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>"It's him, Richard, go, get the children and leave- I'll try and hold him off!" Mary shouted. Her husband disappeared up the stairwell. By now, the fireplace was spewing ink-black magic, and she knew that the Dark Lord would be there in a matter of minutes. Taking a deep breath, she leveled her wand at the floo exit. A moment later, it flashed blue, and a green figure in blood-red robes stepped out. "<em>Brisingr!</em>" Mary barked, only for the Dark Lord to raise a hand, stopping the spell.</p>
<p>"<em>Andask,</em>" he intoned, and a white light flared around her before she fell to the ground, eyes glassy. He swept up the stairs, breaking the children's room's door open with a whispered, "<em>Jierda.</em>"</p>
<p>"Move aside, fool," he hissed at Richard. The shorter man stood, stubbornly glaring. With a wave of his wand and an "<em>Avada Kadavra,</em>" A green light erupted from the tip of his eleven and a quarter yew and Hydra venom wand, slamming into his opponent and throwing him into a wall. Leaning over the crib, the half-demon smiled a sickening smile, his sharp teeth glinting a un-earthly white, dark horns the same shade of black as his wings and dark electricity dancing across the Necromancer's runes branded into his skin, eyes shining pitch-black. </p>
<p>Reaching out a clawed hand towards Peter, the demon recoiled at the feel of the boy's magic- it was the purest he'd ever encountered, untainted by the sickening mud of <em>Nachtmagie(1) </em>used by the Necromancers(2a), Cryomancers(2b), Electromancers(2c), or the <em>Tagesmagie(3) </em>of the idiotic Herbomancers(4a), Hydro-pyroyromancers(4b), Aero-terramancers(4c), or even the emptiness of Void magics(5) used by the Chrono-spatiomancers(6a), Technomancers(6b), Telepathics(6c) and Metalomancers(6d). This child had <em>pure </em>magic, the kind only told of in legends, given only to, myths said, mortal avatars of the Magic that had created reality itself from - so powerful, it could do <em>anything </em>its user wished. And this meant that the Parker brat was the <em>only </em>thing that could stop him from ruling all of existence. Savitar - for that was the demon-necromancer's name- raised his hand to blast young Peter Parker into oblivion, a black ball of energy gathering in his palm. He flung it at the silent child- only for it to hit the toddler and hover for a moment, changing into a sphere of translucent energy and rebound, smashing Savitar in the chest, flinging his soul out of his body and disintegrating his flesh.</p>
<p> At that moment, a tall, curly haired man shimmered into being, his mental guard down. Savitar's fractured soul latched onto the man's own, decimating it within seconds. Norman Osborne- for that was the man's name- walked over to the cribs, and looked at the two children. Reaching out a human hand to Harrison, Savitar chuckled darkly. "You are nearly a magic-less worm," he muttered, "But if I can manipulate you, you will be my key to winning. You will be raised a prince among princes, your magic expanded and altered until I am the only one capable allowing you to access it." He shot Peter a sneer, "You, on the other hand, Spyder, will be raised by a family who will treat you as less than dirt, oppressing your powers so that, when the time comes for me to conquer reality, you'll be little more than a pesky smudge." That said, he used his host's connection to his familiar to order it to transport the pale-eyed child to the front door step of his mother's sisters' family with nothing more than a note instructing them to never treat Peter with any form of affection.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Thompsons, of number seven, Lakeside, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. Mr. Thompson was the director of a firm called Fox, which made tools, such as drills, saws, and wrenches. He was a small, stocky man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Thompson was heavyset brunet and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors for things to gossip about them with. The Thompsons had a small son called Flash and in their opinion, there was no finer boy anywhere. </p>
<p>The family of three had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Parkers. Mrs. Parker was Mrs. Thompson's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; as a matter of fact, Mrs. Thompson pretended she didn't have a sister because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as abnormal as it was possible to be. The Thompsons shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Parkers arrived in the street. They knew that the Parkers had a pair of twin boys,  but they had never even met them. These boys were another good reason for keeping the Parkers away; they didn't want Flash mixing with a child like <em>that.</em> </p>
<p>When Mr. and Mrs. Thopson woke up on the dull, gray Thursday, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Thompson hummed as he picked out his most boring suit-tie combo for work, and Mrs. Thompson gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Flash into his high chair. None of them noticed a small, green sparrow flutter past the window. At half-past eight, Mr. Thompson picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Thompson on the cheek, and tried to kiss Flash goodbye but missed, due to the fact that the formerly sulking child was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. "Hey bucko," chortled Mr. Thompson as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number seven's drive.</p>
<p>It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a mouse reading a map. For a second, Mr. Thompson didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a small, white mouse sitting atop the corner of the number seven's garden wall, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Thompson blinked and stared at the mouse. It scurried away. As Mr. Thompson drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the garden wall in his mirror. The mouse had reappeared, and was now reading the sign that said Lakeside Residency  -- no, looking at the sign; mice couldn't read maps or signs.</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson gave himself a little shake and put the mouse out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in capes, people with fake wings, even people with horns. Mr. Thompson couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the indecency you saw from young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. </p>
<p>He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together, a fact that made Mr. Thompson enraged to see as a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and sporting emerald-green scales! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Thompson that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Thompson arrived in the Fox parking lot, his mind back on drills. </p>
<p>Mr. Thompson always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it quite a bit more difficult to concentrate on tools that morning. He didn't see the various different species of abnormally colored birds swooping past in broad daylight- though the people down in the street most certainly did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as birds of all shapes, colors, and sizes- purple canaries, green hawks, and silver ducks- sped overhead. </p>
<p>Most of them had never seen more than a lone sparrow in the outside world, let alone this number of them. Mr. Thompson, however, had a perfectly normal, avian-free morning. He yelled at five different people, made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. </p>
<p>He'd forgotten all about the people in strange costumes until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed for an unexplainable reason, they made him uneasy. This bunch was whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. "The Parkers, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their youngest son, Harrison" Mr. Thompson stopped dead, and fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. </p>
<p>He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Parker wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Parker who had a son called Harrison. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure (any) of his nephews were even called Harrison. He'd never even seen either of the boys. It might have been Harvey, or Harold, or even Henry, so there was no point in worrying Mrs. Thompson; she always got so skittish and antsy at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in costumes... He found it a lot harder to concentrate on hammers and screwdrivers that afternoon, and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. </p>
<p>"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Thompson realized that the man was wearing a pair of false violet horns. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. Quite the opposite, it seemed as his, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for the Dark Lord has gone at last! Even Bloodless(7) like yourself should be celebrating this happy, happy day!" And the old man hugged Mr. Thompson around the middle and walked off. </p>
<p>Mr. Thompson stood rooted to the spot; he'd been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Unblooded, whatever that was- after all, he had plenty of blood in him, thank you very much. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination. As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the white mouse he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his other garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. "Scram!" said Mr. Thompson loudly- but the mouse didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal rodent behavior? Mr. Thompson wondered. </p>
<p>Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs. Thompson had had a nice, normal day, she told him over dinner all, and how Mrs. Next Door had been having problems with her daughter and how Flash had learned a new word ("Shan't!"). Mr. Thompson tried to act normally. When Flash had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: "And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the country's avian inhabitants have been behaving very unusually today. Although most birds shy away from human eyes, there have been hundreds of sightings of them in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why our birds have suddenly changed their habits." </p>
<p>The newscaster allowed himself a grin. "Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of birds tonight, Jim?" </p>
<p>"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not only the birds that have been acting funny today. Viewers as far apart as Philidelphia, Chicago, and Phoenix have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Independence Day early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight." </p>
<p>Mr. Thompson sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over America? Birds flying in broad daylight? Mysterious people in costumes all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Parkers... Mrs. Thompson came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. "Erm - Pet, dear - you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?"</p>
<p>As he had expected, Mrs. Thompson looked shocked and angry, pursing her lips as if she'd sucked on a particularly sour lemon. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister. "No," she said sharply. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Funny stuff on the news," Mr. Thompson mumbled. "Birds... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..." </p>
<p>"So?" snapped Mrs. Thompson, her patience obviously frayed. </p>
<p>"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd." Mrs. Thompson sipped her tea through tight lips. Mr. Thompson wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name 'Parker' He decided he didn't dare. Instead, he said, as casually as he could, "Their sons -- they'd be about Flash's age now, wouldn't they?" </p>
<p>"I suppose so," said Mrs. Thompson stiffly. </p>
<p>"What's their youngest's name again? Howard, isn't it?" </p>
<p>"Harrison. Nasty, common name, if you ask me."  she sniffed in obvious disapproval. </p>
<p>"Oh, yes," said Mr. Thompson, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite agree." He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Thompson was in the bathroom, Mr. Thompson crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The mouse was still there. It was staring down Lakeside as though it were waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Parkers? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it. The Tompsons got into bed. </p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson fell asleep quickly but Mr. Thompson lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Parkers were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Thompson. The Parkers knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on - he yawned and turned over - it couldn't affect them.</p>
<p>How very wrong he was.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>The mouse, appropriately named Maus, was not, indeed, an ordinary rodent. He was actually a wizard's familiar- Norman Osborne's, to be precise. His master had sent him to this Bloodless family's home in order to deposit a package. Using an innate form of magic, Maus pulled the child from out of thin air, levitating it towards the front step of the house. On some level, the rodent felt a spark of pity for the child- after all, he would grow up a slave in his own house, unloved, unwanted and treated as less than dirt- but that glimmer was quickly extinguished by the cold need to do his master's bidding.</p>
<p>Having deposited the young Blooded(8), Maus then used magic again, causing a note to appear next to the youngster. Then, task finished, he scampered away, back to his master.</p><hr/>

  <strong>
    <em>(1)Nachtmagie- Night, or "dark" magics(9), these can only be harnessed by "night-creatures" such as demons, vampires, and banshees, and are used either as destructive forces or as chaotic forces, though they are not inherently evil- for example, if a user of Nachtmagie uses night magics to tear a rain cloud apart in order to make it rain in a drought-ridden area.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>(2a-2c)Necromancer- A user of Nachtmagie whose affinity is death related magic. For example, a Necromancer can reanimate and control corpses.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Cryomancer - A user of Nachtmagie who has an affinity for ice magic. For example, a Cryomancer can summon a burst of ice to put out a fire or freeze a tsunami, if they are powerful enough.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Electromancer- A user of Nachtmagie whose affinity is electric magic. Some Electromancers can control electricity so well that they can hack any nonmagical system, if they so wished, and can summon lightning.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>(3)Tagesmagie- Day, or "light" magics, these can only be used by "day-creatures" such as fae, dwarves, and dryads, and are either used as constructive forces or as forces of order. However, Tagesmagie is not inherently good, like Nachtmagie is not inherently evil- one example of a corrupt Tagesmagie user could be one who insists that nothing ever change, so as to keep perfect order.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>(4a-4c)Herbomancer- A user of Tagesmagie whose affinity is plant-based, or botanical magic. For example, a Herbomancer can cause vines to shoot out of the ground and form a protective shield, or ensnare their enemies.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Hydro-pyromancer- Twin users(10) of Tagesmagie whose affinity is fire and water magic. All Hydro-pyromancers are one-half of a set of mentally liked twins, with one controlling water while the other controls fire. For example, Hydro-pyromancers can cause anything to catch fire, and they can also summon torrents of rain.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Aero-terramancers- Twin Tagesmagie users whose affinity is earth and air magic. Like Hydro-pyromancers, Aero-terramancers are always a set of twins, one who can control air(e.g. cause a tornado) and earth(e.g. summon dragons made of clay).</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>(5)Void Magics- Void, or "twilight" or "gray" magics are the balance between Nachtmagie and Tagesmagie, the balance between chaos and order, creation and destruction, and as such they can only be wielded by true neutrals. As such, almost all users remain out of any major conflicts. However, just like Tagesmagie and Nachtmagie users, users of Void Magic users aren't always impartial- case in point, if someone threatens those under a Void Magic wielder's protection, they will fight them to the death. Void Magic users are rare, as it is uncommon for a being to be truly unbiased- the only examples are usually secretive and hermetic, so it is uncertain if it is specific to certain species or if any truly unbiased being is a user of Void Magic.</em>

</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>(6a-6d)Chrono-spatiomancer- Twin users of Void Magics whose affinity is space and time magic. Like Hydro-pyro and Aero-terramancers, Chrono-spatiomancers are always twins, one who can distort time while the other distorts space.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Technomancer- A Void Magics user whose affinity is technological magic. Technomancers excel at creating electronical technology that can be used around magic.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Telepathics- A user of Void Magics whose affinity is mind magic. A Telepathic can help heal the minds of those who have had prolonged exposure to, say, Dementors.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Metalomancer- A user of Void Magics whose affinity is metal related magic. Metalomancers can mold the metal around them into any form; most Metalomancers have one type of metal they can manipulate, such as silver or iron, but some can manipulate more than one type and all can manipulate alloys that contain their metal(s.)</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>(7)Bloodless- Bloodless refers those who are pure human, without any blood from a magical being. While some are given magic, it is so rare as to be nearly unheard of, and they are usually weaker than the average mage.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>(8)Blooded- Blooded refers to those who have blood from a magical being, such as a naga, an elf or a werewolf. Bloodedes are divided into various different positions depending on what type of blood they have and how much- for example, a quarter siren might hold a lower position of power within the siren community than a three-quarters siren, but hold a more powerful position in general than a quarter dwarf. This is due to the fact that a being's power level is determined by what sort of magical being's blood they possess, and some magical beings are simply more magical than others(ie, a vampire has less magical power than an elf, as elves have a better grasp of magic because their bodies are built in order to channel a lot of magic because historically they lead more labor intensive lives). It is not, however, impossible that a normally magically inferiorly blooded being can be born with more magic than a normally magically superiorly blooded being.</em>

</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>(9)Magics- Magics are divided into six different types. The first is General Magic- basic magics taught to all Blooded children. The second is Wordless Magic, a higher level of Basic Magics that allows its user to harness magic without the use of a spell, incantation, or rune. The third is Wandless Magic, the highest level of Basic Magics that allows its knowers to cast spells not only wordlessly but also wandlessly. The fourth is Ancient Magic, a type of wandless magic that uses the true names of all things to do what it's user wants. The fifth is Affinity Magic, or what a being's innate magical skills are, such as the ability to control liquids. The sixth and final one is Hereditary Magic, also called Hereditary Magical Traits, such as being a Metamorphamagus or being a naturally born werecat or vampire.</em>

    <em>(10)All Hydro-pyro, Aero-terra, and Chrono-spatiomancers are twins; however, not all twins are Hydro-pyro, Aero-terra, and Chrono-spatiomancers- plenty of twins share the same Affinity or, say, one is a Necromancer and the other is a Metalomancer.</em>
