    <p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, hi, sorry - <em>excuse me</em>... hey! Hold the lift!” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry Potter was swarmed. In a million ways - completely and utterly swarmed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No doubt when he made it to his office, he would be swarmed with paper work, right now, he was swarmed with hundreds of</span>
  <span class="s1"> reporters and fans, he was swarmed with job opportunities, interviews, and to be completely, fully honest? It was hard - Happy Potter was still broken. He wanted someone to be there for him, someone who actually knew him, and didn’t want to date him for money.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He wanted someone to </span>
  <span class="s2">love</span>
  <span class="s1">him. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Yeah, I know, I know. Call me crazy. He had tons of friends, family and fans! A lot of people loved him. But... somehow? Harry James Potter couldn’t shake the feeling of loneliness. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">As he tried to push his way through the crowd, a thin, pale hand reached out to hold the lift for him. He sighed, gratefully. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Thank you, I am completely buzzed</span>
  <span class="s1"> - oh.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He stopped in his tracks. ”Hi” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The lift door closed, and in front of him, immaculate and striking as ever, stood a smirking Draco Malfoy. His silver eyes twinkled with amusement, and his hair, still exactly the same infuriating platinum white, was pushed back, framing his sharp cheekbones and jaw. He smiled, pleasantly, for a second. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Harry Potter.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry caught a small glance at Malfoy, and saw a sharp, mischievous glint in his silver eyes. They hadn’t seen each other since the battle, four years ago. The wound was still fresh, and both of them were still broken. But god, they’d be damned if they showed it to each other. (Authors note; they are both stubborn shits. sorry not sorry) </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Malfoy. It’s always a pleasure.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He could have slapped that smirk off Malfoy’s smug face at any given moment. He was dressed rather dramatically, Harry observed, compare to his own ruffled jeans and old shirt, in an all black robe, making his skin look even paler (if possible), and his hair a shocking white. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Malfoy hummed, in answer to Harry’s statement. “It sure is. What floor are you on?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Oh,” Harry looked up, catching Malfoy’s eyes again. They were brighter, more silver than grey, more...light? Happy?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unusual? God - what was he doing, analysing </span>
  <span class="s2">Draco Malfoy’s </span>
  <span class="s1">eyes? “Uhm, 93. Aurors Department.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Oh,” Malfoy turned his head to look at Harry, his right eyebrow slightly raised. “Perfect. Me too.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You’re an Auror?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry was shocked. Draco Malfoy, in all his perfection, an Auror? The man probably had a sixteen step facial routine! An Auror? </span>
  <span class="s2">Not possible. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, in fact, I’m headed to see Weasley.” He paused to take another look at Harry, silently begging for the lift to hurry up. “I’m going to find out who new partner is.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Why,” he joked, “did you manage to obliviate your last one?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Malfoy didn’t laugh. He didn’t even smile, he just turned his head to regard him -once again- and frowned. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“She died.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Oh,” he said, stupidly. “I’m sorry.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">By some miracle, they managed to spend the next fifteen painful seconds in silence before they </span>
  <span class="s2">finally r</span>
  <span class="s1">eached the 93rd floor, where they parted ways with an awkward </span>
  <span class="s2">goodbye </span>
  <span class="s1">and </span>
  <span class="s2">see you later.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">Well, </span>
  <span class="s1">Harry thought. </span>
  <span class="s2">That was awkward. Maybe it would’ve been less awkward if you didn’t make a joke, you dumb fuck. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry decided not to beat himself up about it. It was Malfoy, for God’s sake! He would probably see him in ten years time and never have to talk to him again. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Maybe it was the stupid gut feeling he had when he sat down at his desk, which was piled to the ceiling in paperwork, or maybe it was the fact he couldn’t get the arrogant blond out of his head, or maybe the fact his three hours of sleep were torturing him...</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"><em>Maybe</em>. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But Harry knew... he knew something was going to go wrong today. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Mr Weasley,” Draco greeted, opening the door with a charming smile, and shaking the red-heads hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Just Arthur to you, Draco,” he smiled chirpily, as he gestured for them to sit down. Ever since Arthur had spoken at Draco’s court date, things had been... awkward, to say the least, between the Malfoys and the Weasleys. They had been </span>
  <span class="s2">trying </span>
  <span class="s1">to be nice, but it was seeming to be harder than first thought. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Ah.” Draco nodded awkwardly. “Okay.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“So,” Arthur proclaims, smiling widely, as they both sat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We have some good news, more good news, and then some bad news.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Alright.” Draco nodded, licking his lips nervously. Surely it couldn’t be that bad? “Hit me with the good first, I’m sure I can make the best out of this all.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Perfect,” He grinned. “Optimism, I really admire that.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">
    <em>You know what I admire, Arthur Weasley? That I’m managing to sit here and not hit that annoying chirpy smile off your face. Why can’t you be moody? Is it that impossible, or am I just a moody fucker?!? Fuck me. </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Good news, number one. You have been selected for a promotion to head of Auror group one. Congratulations!” Once again, that smile. </span>
  <span class="s2">Ugh. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco should’ve been happy, he really should have. Auror group one? The best group? </span>
  <span class="s2">He</span>
  <span class="s1">was the head of Auror group one? But he was mostly.... confused. “Auror group one? Isn’t that....” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Harry’s group.” Arthur finished for him. “Yes,” He nodded, enthusiastically. “He was considered for the promotion, but your work had been outstanding, and your field work? You’ve taken down -“ </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“More death eaters than anyone ever at the industry,” Draco finished, holding back an eye roll. “Yeah. I know.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">Because I’m not an idiot? Because I know where all the hiding spots are? Because I have a brain? </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Arthur threw his hands up in the air, grinning widely. “Draco, it’s amazing!” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He smiled, nodding. “Thank you. The other good news?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Ah. Well, Mr Malfoy-“ </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">
    <em>What happened to Draco and all of the pleasantries? </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“- it’s a difficult situation.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“What’s so difficult about it?” He snapped, irritably. “Sorry... it’s just, you find me a new partner, and I move on.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Arthur inhaled deeply, rubbing his temples. “The only free partner is Harry Potter.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">
    <em>Stay calm Draco. You know, do that thing your therapist said to do when you feel like this. Breathe in four. Hold for seven. Exhale for eight. </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Draco? Are you alright?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">His breath quivered, and his hands clenched under the desk. He wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his robes. “Yes. Yes, I’m fine.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It should be noted that right now, Draco really longed for Weasley to look at him, and say ‘no you’re not’. But no one notices. </span>
  <span class="s2">No one. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Perfect. So, Harry?” Weasley grinned. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Sounds great. Uh, I hate to be a bother, but- uh- I’m actually still on bereavement leave?” Draco sighed, biting his lip in an effort to keep the tears at bay. His father and his partner had died in the past week, Draco Malfoy - at much as he hated to admit it, was wrecked. Despite everything his father did, Draco still loved him unconditionally. And Ellie? His partner, his best friend, his go to, no matter the problem. Ellie was a different kind of person. So trusting and so kind, Draco longed to share her light - and he did, for a while. Maybe that’s why she died, because she was so kind and trusting. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">
    <em>“Ellie! Ellie, watch out!!” </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">
    <em>Draco saw the green flash of light, first. Second, he saw a familiar death eater, dark hair and dark eyes, his mark happily exposed, and third - third, he saw Ellie’s pale body, brown hair splayed around her head, on the floor. Dead. </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">
    <em>“ELLIE!” </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Later that night, his father would be taken into hospital, and would die two days later. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, Draco.” Arthur Weasley nodded solemnly. “You don’t need to explain,” he smiled, biting his lip. “I understand.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">Right, </span>
  <span class="s1">Draco thought. </span>
  <span class="s2">His son. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Have the rest of the week off, and come in on Monday...” he smiled. “Have a nice long weekend, Draco.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Uh... so - you’ll tell Harry?” </span>
  <span class="s2">Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>
  <span class="s1">Draco hadn’t meant to use his first name, saying it felt... unusual. And he didn’t like unusual. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Weasley nodded, “Yes, of course. And Draco?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He turned, his hand still on the door knob, eyebrows raised. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Whatever Harry says...” he paused, “please don’t take much of it to heart.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Merely nodding, Draco left the room. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">Much of it?</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Malfoy’s blond head was bent over the sink when Harry walked into the 93rd floor bathrooms, and he was taking sharp breaths, arms shaking. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Malfoy?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Despite Draco’s previous beliefs, Harry Potter wasn’t stupid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyone in their right mind could identify an anxiety attack. In a bathroom. Harry shuddered, mind flashing back to the bathroom in sixth year. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Okay Malfoy, I need you to breathe-“</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Fuck off, Potter. T-try not to slice me up th- this time, yeah?” Despite the seriousness of the current situation, his tone was light, yet somehow still serious. Harry didn’t know wether to laugh or cry. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“That’s not fair,” he whispers, crossing his arms. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Malfoy laughs, and breathes in faster, his shaky arms nearly slipping off the sink. He regards Harry with sliver eyes, frowning. “Isn’t it?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry ignores him and places a hand on his back, running smooth circles over it. Malfoy’s attempt to shrug it off are feeble. “Focus on my hand, okay? Every time I squeeze your shoulder I want you to breathe in.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t need your help, Potter-“ </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Yes you do.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Try stay there for five minutes, until Malfoy’s ragged breathing is coming in deep breaths, through his nose and out his mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’s less shaky, and he takes a small sip of water Harry had given him, reluctantly drinking it after Harry had convinced him it wasn’t poisoned. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Are you okay?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Malfoy laughs again, his eyes crinkling in the corners, but there is not one sense of humour in his expression, “since when do you care how I am, Potter?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t know, since when have you been having anxiety attacks in bathrooms?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Sixth year,” he says, flatly. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry winces, “so you’ve been having anxiety attacks for six years?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Malfoy hums, his hand on the door. “Uh, Potter?” He asks, holding the door open. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry raises his eyebrows, in question. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>
  <span class="s1">“...thank you.” </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p>
