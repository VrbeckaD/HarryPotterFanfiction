      <b>THROTTLEBOTTOM FINDS FRISKY FOREST OF PHALLUSES IN FRONT GARDEN</b>
    </i>
  </p>
</center><i></i><p>
  <i>Sources close to the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot have revealed exclusively to the <b>Daily Prophet</b>  that early this morning, while investigating a suspicious noise at his front gate, the respected Mr Balter Throttlebottom, OM, was shocked to discover his award winning garden had been burgled. The bold bandits replaced every bush of blooming roses with a shrub quivering under the weight of what can only be described as blushing, bawdy buds: perky purple penises. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>This reporter understands that the Auror Corps have assigned a team of investigators to get to the bottom of this titillating crime, which some have already speculated may be the work of notorious protest group C.U.M. (Citizens United against the Ministry). Head Auror Ronald Weasley could not be reached for comment at the time of publishing, nor have C.U.M. officially claimed the prank on behalf of their cause. Chief Warlock Throttlebottom has also refused to provide a comment on the matter to the <b>Prophet</b>, and sources have confirmed that he is in fact attempting strenuously to keep the unfortunate incident out of the press. </i>

</p><p>“Couldn’t have happened to a nicer bloke,” Harry murmured, thumbing through the pages of his paper til he found the Quidditch scores. He normally tried to avoid the tabloid press at all costs, and the <i>Quibbler</i> would have his loyalty for as long as there was a Lovegood in the editor’s chair. But Ginny was supposed to be at the family dinner that evening at the Burrow, and Harry had somehow managed to sleep through the sports update the night before on the wireless. If he showed up without knowing the Harpies place on the league table, Ginny would kick his arse, which would be entertaining for everyone other than Harry, and Hermione might accuse him of being a workaholic again based purely on one ill-timed nap. He could frankly live without a repeat of the dreaded intervention of 2008. Hence, the early edition of the <i>Daily Prophet</i>, complete with its unmissable front page headline.</p><p>“Harpies thumped the Prides...best on pitch...Ginevra Weasley.” Harry grinned. “That’s my girl. Now...Cannons, Cannons, Can-...ah. Well, I suppose that’s a topic which might be best avoided.” He pinched the tabbed string of his tea bag between two fingers, and swished it in a slow circle around the perimeter of his cup. A neat stack of toast sat on a plate between himself and his newspaper, and the butter had melted into a warm golden puddle on top. Harry folded the paper in half, then half again, and propped it up against the sugar bowl so he could skim the classifieds, whilst cupping his tea with both hands. The mornings were getting just this side of nippy lately, and he would need to get into the habit of setting a fire in the old potbellied stove again, as the kitchen was large, and he was pants at Warming charms.</p><p>“You going to eat that?” Freckled fingers reached for the toast, and Harry cast a mild Stinging jinx under his breath without reaching for his wand, or indeed looking up from an advert for an extra large cauldron for sale, slightly used. Ron made a yowling noise that Harry was pretty sure he’d picked up from Crookshanks. “I’m Head Auror, you know. I could have you in Azkaban for that.”</p><p>“It would never stick. For a start, you tried to steal food from the very mouth of the Saviour of the Wizarding World. Secondly, you clearly broke into my private home in order to do so. I think I could have <i>you</i> in Azkaban for that, actually.”</p><p>“You’ve changed,” Ron said, staring sadly at the toast. “Time was, you would have spared a crumb of toast for a starving man, who hasn’t eaten in days.”</p><p>Harry took out his wand and circled several suspicious advertisements, the words sucking right up into the tip of his wand from the page. “You have porridge on your robes, you lunatic.” Ron looked down and said several very rude words, then rubbed at the stains with one sleeve. </p><p>“Fuck’s sake. I’ve got a meeting...do you still have a pair of spare robes?”</p><p>“Auror robes? Yeah, but Ron...” Harry aimed, and hit the streak of porridge with a <i>Scourgify</i>. The stain vanished. “You’re a wizard.”</p><p>Ron looked sheepish. “Please come back to the Aurors. I’m begging you.”</p><p>Harry laughed. “Not enough galleons in the world for that, mate.” He gave the paper one last look, then collected it and his now empty tea cup, and took both to the sink, dropping the paper onto the towering pile of old <i>Quibblers</i> beside the stove to use for kindling later. The used tea bag landed with a soggy plop in the rubbish bin under the sink, and Harry gave the cup a brief rinse. “Do you want a lift in? I’ve still got a Ministry car from that job last Tuesday.”</p><p>Harry turned around when Ron didn’t answer, and found him wedging the last triangle of Harry’s toast into his already crammed mouth, looking only slightly ashamed of himself. “Wathabou ith I mathe yoo Heth Auler?”</p><p>“Head Auror...otherwise known as, <i>your</i> job.”</p><p>Ron’s cheeks bulged, and he swallowed with what looked like difficulty. “Yeah, but I’m clearly incompetent. Wouldn’t it be nice to be a department head?”</p><p>Harry shrugged on his outer robe, and patted his pockets for his wallet and wand. “I am a department head, Ron. That’s what that fancy dinner was all about, the one where you ate most of a whole roasted pig?”</p><p>Ron rubbed his stomach absently and looked fond for a moment. “That was some top notch crackling.”</p><p>“Do you want a lift, or not? Don’t you have a meeting?”</p><p>Ron moaned. “Yes. Our dear Chief Warlock has got himself a front garden full of cocks, as you might have heard.” He followed Harry out the back door, closing it behind them, and through the garden to the rear gate. Harry unlocked the old, slightly battered-looking Volkswagen Polo parked in the laneway behind the house, and he and Ron slid in. The interior condition of the car was somewhat at odds with its exterior. The soft leather seats creaked comfortably, and the radio switched on automatically, filling the cavernous back seat with the latest hit from The Sneaky Tweezers. There was a pleasant smell of leather polish and carpet foam, and Ron immediately lifted the lever to ease the seat all the way back to stretch out the entire length of his legs. “Do you mind if I change the station? I can’t stand this Sneaky Tweezer shite. Whatever happened to decent bands, like the Weird Sisters?”</p><p>The engine rumbled to life, and Harry grinned at Ron. “They got old. We’re not so far behind them, you know.” He eased the car out of the laneway and onto the main street, and before long they were cutting swiftly through the quickly thickening Muggle traffic like a hot knife through butter, courtesy of a combination of Disillusionment charms, and the sorts of spells which allow a car to pass directly through the middle of a roundabout, shrubbery and all, without harm. Harry was particularly fond of that part.</p><p>Ron fiddled with the buttons until he found something less offensive to his tender ears. “So, I imagine it’s early in the investigation considering it only happened last night, but any leads on this forest of knobs situation?”</p><p>Ron slouched down in his seat, poking the nearest air vent with obvious annoyance. “Other than those ‘came’ twits? Not really. The guy is exceedingly unpopular, it could have been anyone – it could have been his own <i>wife</i>. He’s demanding just completely unreasonable resources for the investigation. He asked me to recall Shacklebolt. Shacklebolt! Like, as if he’s just been off fieldwork for the last fifteen years, or something. He’s the fucking Minister for Magic!”</p><p>Harry smothered a laugh. “It’s C.U.M., Ron.”</p><p>He looked confused. “What’s come?”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “C.U.M. – the Citizens United against the Ministry.”</p><p>Ron threw up his hands. “C.U.M., go, I couldn’t give a fuck really, as long as I can get on with some actual work instead of wasting my team’s time on ridiculous pranks.”</p><p>The wards surrounding the Ministry parking garage dragged over the car before releasing it, and Harry aimed for a parking space between a sleek silver limousine, and an old fashioned Mini which was the precise colour of peanut butter. “Between stealing my breakfast and ranting about Knobgate, I nearly forgot to ask you if there was an actual reason for your visit this morning.”</p><p>Ron’s eyes widened. “Fuck! Yes – Hermione’s birthday. I need gift help.” </p><p>They discussed Ron’s present dilemma in earnest as they made their way through the car park to the restroom, where in turn they each flushed themselves all the way to the Atrium at the Ministry Headquarters. By the time the lift doors clattered open at Level Two, Harry had successfully talked Ron out of a subscription to <i>Quidditch Weekly</i>, a home brew butterbeer distiller, and a year’s supply of Honeydukes finest Fizzing Whizzbees. </p><p>“I’m telling you, Ron – keep it simple. Take her somewhere nice for dinner, and then a night at a nice hotel. And the Leaky does not count for either of those. Get her some flowers, she likes roses, right?”</p><p>Ron grabbed the front of Harry’s robes. “<i>Please</i> come back and work with me.”</p><p>Harry laughed and patted Ron on the shoulder. “I’ll see you at dinner tonight.”</p><p>The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office occupied a small suite of rooms at the far end of Level Two. Small gold-painted letters marked their territory on the rippled glass of a faded wooden door, opening to a modest foyer that housed two plastic visitor chairs, a dusty potted plant, and a frazzled-looking receptionist behind a narrow counter. Harry’s office was behind the first of four adjoining doors; a meeting room that was barely the size of a broom cupboard squeezed immediately beside it. The third door led to an office shared by his four long-suffering field officers, and the final door led to Harry’s favourite place in the whole Ministry: the lab.</p><p>“’Morning, Vicky.”</p><p>“’Morning, sir. If I may, could I have the car keys back, sir? Fleet have threatened to send a Howler every hour starting at lunchtime if you don’t return them today.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes, and handed over the keys. “You’re a few days late returning one little Volkswagen and the administration is ready to toss you in Azkaban.”</p><p>“Sorry sir, thank you. The files you requested are on your desk. Can I interest you in a cup of tea?”</p><p>“That would be grand, thank you Vicky.” Harry fished out his wand. “I took care of the <i>Prophet</i> check this morning, could you let Devlin know?” Vicky unlocked a battered filing cabinet which had been squeezed with some difficulty into the space between her counter and the wall, and lifted out a shallow bowl which looked something like a miniature Pensieve. Harry tapped his wand against the lip, and all of the collected words tumbled back out, gathering themselves into their correct order before floating gently away into the slightly cloudy depths of the bowl. “Ta. I’ll be in my office going over those files until half-ten, then I’ll be in the lab working on the cursed toasters if anybody’s looking for me.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>Harry closed his office door behind him and wrinkled his nose at the immediate and sour odour of ink, no doubt originating from the tall stack of files now residing on his desk. If Harry disliked one thing about his job, it was the paperwork; but then, he never had been particularly fond of it, not as an Auror and certainly not when he was at school. What he had learned, however, was that if he buckled down and got it done, he could play for as long as he liked in the lab without various department heads breathing down his neck about late reports. He <i>had</i> thought Hermione would be proud when he told her of his epiphany, but instead she worriedly took his temperature and pulse, and warned him that she’d be watching him to make sure he wasn’t overdoing it.</p><p>The very idea was ridiculous, Harry thought to himself, not for the first time, as he sat down and flipped open the first of the waiting files. Hermione’s constant fretting that he was becoming anti-social, was burying himself in his job as a way to avoid dealing with the world at large, and such apparently catastrophic issues as his status as a bachelor, had been steadily driving him up the wall. <i>He</i> was certainly not worried about being single at his age, and thirty-two was still practically juvenile, actually. </p><p>
  <i>Didn’t you just tell Ron this morning that we’re all getting old?</i>
</p><p>“Not the same thing at all,” Harry muttered to himself. So what if he didn’t really go out much? And, yes, maybe it had been a little while since he’d been on a proper date...a few months...or maybe a year. Years. It wasn’t like he didn’t have a perfectly active sex life. Well, actually, he didn’t have anything near an active sex life, unless you could characterise a cursory evening wank in the shower as either ‘active’, or a ‘sex life’. Things had just become a lot more complicated since Ginny. Meeting people who were not secretly weirdoes, fuckwits or Death Eaters was actually a lot harder than it sounded, and he’d wanted to be respectful to Gin, give her time to move on, minimise the speculation about what had caused the end to what <i>Witch Weekly</i> had dubbed their ‘fairytale romance’.</p><p>
  <i>But surely ten years is sufficient time?</i>
</p><p>“Shut up, Hermione!”</p><p>“Sir?” Vicky stood at the door, a cup of tea in hand. Harry felt his ears redden. “Shall I come back at a better time?”</p><p>“Sorry Vicky, just a little internal debate that became external.” He took the cup from her extended hands, and balanced it on top of his Out tray. “You’re a star, thank you.” Vicky left as silently as she had come in, and Harry gave his mental Hermione a stern glare, and turned his mind toward his reports with determination. There was nothing wrong with his personal life, no matter what Subconscious Hermione, or actual Hermione, had to say about it.</p><p>The morning passed relatively quickly after that, and before he knew it Harry was back in his favourite white lab robe at his preferred workbench, with the dissected remains of a Muggle toaster spread before him. His wand dipped and slashed in the space above the appliance, wisps of yellow emerging from the tip and settling, criss-crossed, over the chrome insides. The problem with the toasters had been obvious – they breathed fire, dragon-style, from each of their toast slots, which had led to a number of painful injuries to Muggles, and a few Muggle-born magical folk who had purchased the cursed appliances from a particular ALDI just outside of Barnsley.  And tracking down each and every toaster had also been relatively straightforward, with the application of a spell Harry had developed himself a few years earlier. The toasters had now been rounded up and impounded in a secure storage unit, the victims treated for their injuries, and Memory charms applied where required. The tricky part was figuring out who was responsible, and so it was with great patience that Harry teased at the spellwork, unravelling layers of magic until, hopefully, he would eventually reach what he was looking for: a unique magical fingerprint which would lead them to their suspect.</p><p>“Come on, you little prick...I’ve almost got you...” With a short glass rod Harry pushed aside the now spent threads of yellow spellwork, which dissolved on contact with the safety mat with a quiet sizzle. With great care and precision, a single yellow thread emerged from his wand tip, hardly the width of a human hair, and Harry placed it upon the exposed parts very gently, turning his wand in a careful loop until the strand broke free and settled completely on its target. This time, the toaster pieces themselves turned a shade of mustardy gold, and Harry readied his wand and an empty phial. It took only a few seconds, and the various pieces of toaster simply disintegrated before his eyes, leaving a curl of sallow vapour behind, and a strong odour of sulphur. Harry collected the vapour in his phial with a pleased sound, and firmly pressed the cork back into the neck of it. By the looks of it, that was about the best quality sample he had ever collected, and there should be plenty of the stuff to combine with the tracking charm, which would lead them right to their culprit’s front door. He or she would be in Auror hands by the end of the week.</p><p>The door to the lab burst open and Harry looked up, startled, to find Devlin in the doorway holding an enormous branch from what looked like some sort of flowering bush. Harry pushed his glasses back up his nose, from where they had slowly slid down to hang precariously from the tip. The branch, and Devlin, came back into focus, and Harry realised that what had at first appeared to be flowers were actually large, semi-opaque rubber cocks.</p><p>“Er...thanks, Devlin. You shouldn’t have?”</p><p>Devlin blinked, and looked from his delivery to Harry, and back again. “Oh – yes, good one, Mr Potter. Mr Weasley sent for me urgently, and asked me to bring these samples over as a priority. From the Throttlebottom case.”</p><p>“Mmm, yes, I gathered as much.” Harry squinted at Devlin’s armload of dicks, in no hurry to reach out and claim them. “Did our good friend Mr Weasley happen to provide any further information? I was under the impression that this case was more of a political stunt than anything to do with our sort of investigations.”</p><p>Devlin shifted his cargo from one arm to the other, and fished a file from within the folds of his robes, its cover an instantly recognisable Auror red. Harry took it from him and flipped to the first page case summary. “Apparently there’s evidence suggesting this-” Harry gestured towards a disturbingly wobbling knob. “Devlin, you’d better put those down. So, the Auror investigation has uncovered evidence that this was the result of a cursed Muggle object.” Harry lifted a trio of large crime scene photographs from the file and showed them to Devlin, arms now free of his burden. A dirt-caked dildo was pictured at the bottom of a shallow hole in what was presumably Throttlebottom’s garden; the next was a somewhat blurry shot of an Auror lifting the thing out of the hole, the lack of focus probably a result of the photographer shaking with laughter. Harry recognised the symptoms; nearly all of Ron’s stag night pictures had ended up in the same condition, as Neville had been designated the official photographer, and proved to be an exceptionally giggly drunk. </p><p>The third picture was a close-up of the base of the toy. Most of the dirt had been brushed away, and a row of raised numbers was visible, probably some sort of model code, or serial number, along with a distinct stamp declaring ‘MADE IN CHINA’. Harry sighed. Definitely Muggle. And almost certainly tampered with by magic, if the potato-like roots creeping from the underside were any indication. “Mr Weasley said it was rather urgent, sir.”</p><p>“I don’t want to investigate this,” Harry said mournfully. “I have biting tea cups. I even have biting toilet seats. There’s been a lot of biting action lately and I really don’t have the time.”</p><p>“You could always delegate the biting stuff to the fieldwork team, sir. I know Rosewarne has some experience with biting toilets, and I was around for the tea cup epidemic of 2002.”</p><p>It was, of course, a perfectly practical solution, which did not resolve the real problem which was that Harry had absolutely no desire to be of service to Balter Throttlebottom in any capacity. Throttlebottom was a bully and a bigot, despite what his Order of Merlin might suggest, and Harry had butted heads with him repeatedly over the years in his capacity as Auror. He was particularly enthusiastic about imposing unduly heavy sentences for minor offences, when those offences had been committed by defendants from certain ‘undesirable’ backgrounds. No, it would be infinitely more satisfying to leave his harvest of dicks just where it was, in full view of all Throttlebottom’s friends and neighbours and the world at large. </p><p>“Leave it with me, Devlin,” Harry said, closing the file. Fuck Throttlebottom. Harry couldn’t decline to investigate, but as far as he was concerned this case was not their top priority, no matter Ron had said. “I’ve got something else to handball to you in the meantime – I’ve got a couple of backlogged Extractions that need to be integrated with a Tracker, including this freshly brewed little bastard.” He handed Devlin the toaster phial. “Could you take care of that for me?”</p><p>Devlin held the phial up to the light and watched the substance move thickly within. “It’s still warm.” He closed his fingers around the glass and nodded. “Right away, Mr Potter. Are the others...?”</p><p>“In the usual spot, yes. Much appreciated.”</p><p>Harry waited until Devlin had gathered the samples and left the lab, before allowing himself to take a proper look at the floral arrangement on his workbench. The cocks trembled in concert, quivering ever so slightly in response to vibrations in the air – the sound of Vicky slamming the filing cabinet drawer closed outside in the foyer was faint to his ears, but he could see the bush rustle immediately in response. Harry could only imagine what the rest of the garden looked like, what with the constant rumble of bin trucks and lorries making their way along Throttlebottom’s busy street. It was almost like they were waving to you, inviting you to come over. Harry looked at the closed door briefly, then extended his wand to poke just the very tip against the side of one cock. It bobbed in reply, excitedly. </p><p>The effect was almost hypnotic. It was like watching the gently beckoning tentacles of a sea anemone, each cock around seven inches in length and a translucent purple, which only enhanced the overall impression that this thing was some sort of deep sea-dwelling creature. Harry only realised he had reached out to touch the nearest appendage when he registered the temperature of it under his fingertips: it was warm, which he had not expected. In fact he would estimate it to be about right for human body temperature, and his fingers seemed quite naturally inclined to curl around the shaft of it and gently squeeze. </p><p>There was a loud bang in the offices beside the lab, followed by a chorus of muffled laughter, and Harry nearly fell off his stool in his haste to drop the cock. He could feel his face burning, and he cleared his throat loudly and pushed his glasses as far up on the bridge of his nose as he could without forcing them into his actual eyes. The cock swung wildly on its branch, its brothers bobbing away around it. “That’s so wrong,” Harry said under his breath, eyes darting between the cocks and the door. It wouldn’t do for someone to come in and find him like this, face beet-red and a shrub covered in pricks nodding away at him like an obscene dashboard ornament, regardless of whether they were part of an official investigation. There was a tarpaulin under the bench, and Harry unfolded it quickly and tossed it over the tabletop, covering the dicks and the residue of the formerly fire-breathing toaster in the process. He could hear them batting softly against the tarp. </p><p>“Time for a cup of tea.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>There was a very particular set of sensations which always accompanied a visit to the Burrow. There was the ever present smell of something cooking, and a delicious sort of warmth to the air no matter what the weather was outside. The chairs always felt more comfortable there, squashier, softer, like well-worn tracksuit bottoms. And the inevitable feeling that followed eating far too much, a sleepy contentment that made it possible to ignore how tight the waistband of your trousers had become. Ron wasn’t even pretending to put on airs; his shirt was entirely untucked, with a noticeable drip of gravy on the front, and Harry could only thank the hem of it for saving him from the sight of Ron’s now unbuttoned jeans, and pale, distended belly. Nothing could save any of them from Ron’s belching, however, which he was blaming unconvincingly on the local bullfrog population.<p>Fleur and Angelina had stayed in the kitchen with Molly, where they were all sharing a cup of tea and a sherry apiece, and the remains of a very good trifle. Upstairs, Harry could hear George and Bill wrangling various small children in the bathroom, some of whom belonged to Ron and Hermione, in an attempt to wash custard and jam from sticky fingers. Harry was pretty sure the kids were winning. Arthur was in the sitting room playing a very serious game of Wizard Chess with Victoire. That left the four of them alone in the living room, where Ron was sprawled on an armchair, while Ginny and Hermione sat together on the settee paging through an ancient copy of <i>Witch Weekly</i>.</p><p>“How’s work, Harry?” Ginny stretched out a leg and poked his shoulder with her foot. “Anything exciting happening in the world of cursed Muggle objects?”</p><p>Harry took a swipe at her foot, but she moved away too quickly. “Nothing much. Fire-breathing toasters, biting tea cups and toilet seats. A few weeks ago we confiscated a batch of cosmetics which turned people permanently orange. That almost completely evaded detection over the summer as most of the victims had recently been on hols in Magaluf and looked pretty much orange as it was, between the fake tan and the sunbathing.”</p><p>“Why is it always <i>biting</i> tea cups and toilet seats?” Hermione asked almost absently, examining  a knitting pattern from the early seventies with interest. “It seems like one or the other will surface every few months.”</p><p>“Never mind that – Harry, how are you getting on with Throttlebottom’s cocks?”</p><p>That caught the girls’ full attention, and Harry favoured Ron with his most withering look. “You only sent it up this afternoon. I’ve barely read the case file.”</p><p>“I’m going to go out on a limb here, and assume this has something to do with the lead article in this morning’s <i>Prophet</i>?”</p><p>Hermione answered Ginny, thoroughly amused. “The Chief Warlock is up to his eyeballs in rubber willies.”</p><p>“Yes, and he’ll have to stay that way for a little while longer while my team works through our existing caseload.”</p><p>Ron groaned. “Mate, there is a <i>lot</i> of pressure from above to get this sorted as a top priority. Throttlebottom is already on the warpath with me since I ‘belligerently refused’ to assign the case to Shacklebolt, and haven’t put those C.U.M. clowns in Azkaban yet. Shacklebolt’s actual job as the leader of Wizarding society in Britain is of no concern to him, nor is the fact that C.U.M. have been completely ruled out as suspects.”</p><p>Harry felt a great surge of irritation rise within him. This sort of crap was precisely why he had such utter contempt for Throttlebottom. “Well the problem is, Ron, that there are actual dangers to Muggles and magical-kind that we’re trying to resolve, the kind where actual people are at risk of actual bodily harm, and not just a little embarrassment. The system doesn’t operate in a way which allows the person who complains the loudest to receive priority service just so we can make him go away!”</p><p>“Normally I’d agree with you mate, but most of the time the person doing the complaining doesn’t have half the clout Throttlebottom does. You have to admit, the biting thing isn’t exactly a matter of national security...you can buy a nose biting teacup from George’s shop!”</p><p>“That’s not the point, Ron!”</p><p>Ron held his hands up. “I know! But the point shouldn’t be that you’re fobbing the case off because you’ve got a personal problem with the Chief Warlock, either.”</p><p>“Okay, boys,” Hermione’s voice was soothing, and she moved from the settee to sit on the arm of Harry’s chair, patting him gently on the shoulder. “I’m calling time on this one before things get out of hand. Harry, you’ve got that look in your eyes.”</p><p>“What look?” Harry glared at Ron.</p><p>“The one that used to reduce hardened criminals to custard in the interrogation room,” Hermione replied mildly. Ron wisely kept silent. “Let’s change the subject. How’s your love life?”</p><p>Harry stared at her. “This is the topic choice that is supposed to make me <i>less</i> annoyed? I’m starting to doubt the whole ‘cleverest witch of our generation’ title.”</p><p>“You’re not thinking of Throttlebottom anymore though, are you.” He was forced to admit, he was not. “So. Anyone you fancy at the moment?”</p><p>“Harry, if you’re not seeing anyone there’s a certain massage therapist working for a certain Quidditch team which shall for the time being remain nameless, who has dropped a number of not so subtle hints that he is single and interested. I could set you up, just say the word.”</p><p>“Or if you’d rather someone non-magical, there’s a new dentist at my father’s surgery who is very fit, and very available. He has excellent teeth, of course.”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “I want to go home.”</p><p>“With a strapping young massage therapist? He has magic fingers, Harry.” Ginny wiggled hers in his face with glee. “<i>Magic</i>.”</p><p>“Or a very respectable dentist with a miniature schnauzer named Travis!”</p><p>Harry looked at Ron in appeal. “Help?”</p><p>Ron snorted. “Now <i>you</i> want a favour?”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Monday morning saw Harry up to his ears in paperwork. There were enough referrals on his desk to build a small house, and the results of a number of recent Trackers needed a final review before they were escalated to the arrest stage. Harry’s head was bent over one such report when he realised there was someone standing in his doorway, silently boring holes into the top of his head with their eyes.<p>“Minister Shacklebolt – to what do I owe-”</p><p>“Is that the Throttlebottom case you’re working on, Potter?” Harry cringed. It was apparent by his tone that Shacklebolt knew very well that it was not, and it was equally as apparent that he was fairly unimpressed by that knowledge. The fact that the Minister for Magic was taking time out to make a personal visit at all was hardly a good omen.</p><p>“Erm. Well, sir, I was just tying up some loose-”</p><p>Shacklebolt entered the office with what seemed like a single stride, and leaned both hands on Harry’s desk. Harry resisted the urge to lean backward with some difficulty. “Do you have any idea how many times the Chief Warlock has personally visited my office to bother me about this case, Potter?” Harry opened his mouth, but Shacklebolt did not wait for his answer. “The answer is ‘too many’, Potter. I had thought I had impressed upon our Head Auror the urgency with which I would prefer this case to be investigated, and he had assured me that he had communicated this to you. Perhaps I was not sufficiently clear.” Harry swallowed, and Shacklebolt loomed over him. “Sort it out. Reassign whatever you have to, and take care of this personally, and immediately.”</p><p>“Yes sir.”</p><p>“I’m not joking, Potter. I don’t want to see that man in my office again about this issue.”</p><p>“Yes sir.”</p><p>Harry watched Shacklebolt’s back until he had left their offices entirely, then blew out a sharp breath, and called for Devlin. Within the hour his desk was clear, with the exception of a single red folder. Harry opened it with resignation, and began to flip through the reports within. According to the documentation, the bushes had continued to sprout new growth even after the originating dildo had been unearthed and removed to Harry’s lab. In fact, so far nothing had worked on them, and the Auror’s had tried almost everything in accordance with Throttlebottom’s requests, including poisoning them, burning them, and ripping them up by the roots. The growth rate was rapid, with an individual cock blossoming within twenty-four hours, and an entire bush regrown within three days. </p><p>There were pages of transcripts from interviews with suspects, all of whom had so far been ruled out. It was apparent that this would come down to lab work, and probably some fairly tedious fieldwork. He would have to make a start on some of the tests right away to give them time to develop, if he wanted to get started on his fieldwork. He definitely didn’t want Shacklebolt to come down and shout at him again.</p><p>Taking the file into the lab, he cast a spell to pin the crime scene photographs and the various reports to the cork board at the back of the room. Working quickly, he retrieved two cauldrons, one pewter and the other iron, and set both to heating with a little water in the bottom. Next came the racks of test tubes, and several beakers, and his potions tools, a handsome set of silver knives, tongs and tweezers which Hermione had given him at Christmas, and a tray of glass stirrers. When he could avoid it no longer, Harry grit his teeth and lifted the tarpaulin from atop the cutting Devlin had brought down on Friday, and the cocks rustled gently on their leafy limbs. There really was a quite disturbing sensation that each cock was watching him, each with their single, small eye at the head, and their constant beckoning motion. Pulling on a pair of gloves and frowning down at the nearest dick, he took hold of it, noticing again the warmth of it seeping through the glove, and gave it a sharp tug. It broke free of the branch like a piece of fruit. Harry placed it on a fresh safety mat in front of him, and gave it a few experimental prods before selecting a scalpel from his knife kit. Carefully, he sliced a thin sliver from the shaft, only about a half an inch in length and as thin as an onion skin, and transferred it carefully to one of the many test tubes. </p><p>After a little while, Harry became as absorbed in his work as he usually did, without the thought of the unpleasantness of the client particularly bothering him, and so by the end of the day he had a set of twelve test tubes with samples from the magical dicks floating in a variety of potions and solutions, each designed to reveal particular properties in the magic and material of the specimen. There were four more with samples from the original Muggle dildo, which was all Harry was willing to risk, in case he damaged the thing to the point where he could no longer extract a magical signature from it. At this point, there were no spares, and no reason to believe there were any others out there in the world, just waiting to cause trouble. Three intact knobs had been planted in fresh soil, to see whether they would sprout independently of the original. The remaining branches had been carefully enclosed in a preservation charm, as had Dildo Prime, and there was really little else Harry could do from the office until his tests were complete.</p><p>Ron poked his head around Harry’s door at half five. “Pint?”</p><p>“In what universe do you think Hermione is going to let you get away with having a pint with me, while she’s stuck at home trying to feed, bathe and put to bed those two banshees you call children?”</p><p>Logic only slowed Ron down for a moment. “How about you come to our place, and look after the kids for a few hours while me and Hermione go out for a pint, then?”</p><p>Harry laughed. “Nice try. Listen, would you be free tomorrow afternoon for a-”</p><p>“Pint?” Ron interrupted hopefully.</p><p>“For a briefing on this Throttlebottom business.” </p><p>“I suppose. Did Shacklebolt come down and tell you off?”</p><p>Harry extended a single finger. “Nobody likes a know-it-all, Ron.”</p>

</center>By the time the briefing with Ron was scheduled, Harry had made far less progress than he had hoped for. The cuttings had not sprouted. The various samples had mainly showed only what Harry supposed they ought: that they were made from polyvinyl chloride and bore the hallmarks of some sort of magical intervention, although what that was specifically was still unclear. The objects themselves had not been manufactured with it – they were definitely Muggle, down to the slight ridges from the original mould along the length of it. The spellwork was very subtle and would need further investigation, which was the most disappointing part for Harry, as he’d be fervently hoping it would turn out to be something obvious and easily identifiable, so he could skip straight on to the tracking.<p>A bit of investigation of the serial number on his laptop at home had confirmed the original manufacturers were a company based in China, with no known magical affiliation. They exported their goods almost everywhere, but there were no signs of any reports of dick gardens in other countries; in fact, the Throttlebottom case was the only one anywhere, as far as Harry could tell. He had managed to obtain a list of businesses which stocked that particular model of dong, however, and had run the list through the wizarding division of Companies House, to see if any of them happened to be owned by wizards. As it happened, there were three, and one of them was right in Knockturn Alley. </p><p>“What’s the word?” Ron said, peering under the tarp at the remains of the shrub cuttings, and generally poking at things on the bench. “What does it all mean?”</p><p>“Well, unfortunately it means I’m still not really anywhere near fixing the problem of the cocks in the Throttlebottom’s garden. I still don’t <i>really</i> know what spells are in use, what they’re for or how to counter them.”</p><p>“So, you don’t think the point is just to embarrass the Chief Warlock? Revenge or something, something political?”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “Well, it could still be something like that, but it’s not clear yet whether this thing is just intended as a nuisance, or if there’s something more harmful lurking under there. Digging the garden up has done nothing to stop these things growing back, nor has removing the original cursed object,” Harry gestured towards the dildo, lying prone on a tray on the bench between them. “The fact that the cuttings wouldn’t grow here in the lab is perplexing. I had two planted in soil samples from the Throttlebottom’s garden, and one in fresh soil as a control, and it grew in none of the test pots. I even buried the original and nothing happened, which indicates that there is something very specific about that garden or those people that is directly related to the activation of the curse. I’d be very hesitant to use any sort of magic to get rid of them until we know it won’t backfire and cause even more cock-related disasters. Which means Throttlebottom is probably going to pay the Minister another visit soon, which means the Minister is probably going to pay <i>me</i> another visit soon.”</p><p>Ron looked sympathetic. “Well, what do you do now? What would you do if this was a fire-breathing toaster?”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “I’d make toast. I’d get a toaster as similar to the cursed one as I could find, identical if I could manage it, and I’d make some toast in both toasters and see what happened. Compare them. Observe the behaviour of the cursed toaster, how hot the flames were, and how high, and what exactly was happening magically at the moment the flames burst out of the slots. Are the flames intended to harm the user or just frighten them, or was it a misguided attempt at improving the performance of the toaster? And once I had that figured out, I’d take the thing apart and extract the magical signature, and then I’d use that to track the culprit down.”</p><p>Ron picked up a cock with a pair of tongs, and waved it in Harry’s direction. “So – get on with it. Use it for what it’s designed for, and see if that activates the curse.”</p><p>Harry looked from Ron, to the cock, and back again several times. “You want me to… interfere with a piece of evidence, one that was recently buried under a quantity of well fertilised soil, and before that had Merlin knows what done to it?”</p><p>Ron laughed so hard that the dong fell onto the table with a dull thud. “Maybe not, mate, but Hermione has these anatomical models from her third year Healer training. Maybe she can tell you where she got them.”</p><p>“Great,” Harry pushed his glasses up, and rubbed his chin. “Just what I need on my next expense report – one artificial, anatomically correct vagina. Easy to explain.”</p><p>“There’s an obvious way around that, isn’t there?” Ron pointed the tongs at Harry. “Just order the artificial arsehole.”</p><p>Harry wasn’t quite sure what to say about that suggestion. In fact, he was still thinking about it several hours after Ron left.</p>
