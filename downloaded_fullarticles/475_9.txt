    <p>The DMLE boardroom certainly wasn’t the biggest in MACUSA, but that didn’t inhibit the celebrations any; the administrative assistants from all divisions, from Wand Permits to No-Maj Fraternization, had seemed to band together to decorate the room from ceiling to floor. Even a few of his off-duty Aurors had come in to help setup the celebrations or bring food. There had, at one point, been a slight whiff of Firewhisky that Percival had chosen to ignore in spirit of the occasion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>This year’s qualifying Junior Aurors were had been promoted to the Senior level the day before. In past years it had still been quite a celebration, but as this was the first class promotion since Grindelwald had practically dismantled their ranks…everyone seemed eager to get back to normal. Bring a bit of cheer back to the Department. And Percival couldn’t deny them that. He of all people knew what the memory of Grindelwald could do, though he imagined his own particular brand of Grindelwald nightmares were a tad different than others’.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Weeks, months, trapped in Grindelwald’s silver matchbox. Used as a potion ingredient farm and a punching bag, the worst moments replayed themselves for him without end during his sleeping hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The perfect horror movie, dedicated to waking him with the best reels of his worst memories.</p><p>Percival mentally shook himself, rising from where he was seated behind his desk. Outside, the usual bustle of the department rose in volume and laughter had joined in signaling the beginning of the celebration. Straightening his tie and smoothing any flyaway hairs back into position, he exited his office to join the crowd.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>As he expected, the room looked magnificent. Across one wall, the word ‘Congratulations!’ glittered on a banner, with colorful fireworks exploding across the white backdrop. Music was playing from a large gramophone in the corner, loud enough to dance to but quiet enough that it didn’t drown out the laughter and conversation. The large meeting table was gone, replaced with several smaller tables covered in white tablecloths along the periphery and a couple buffet tables laden with hors d’oeuvres, sweets, and alcohol. The Firewhisky was nowhere to be seen, he noticed, which probably meant it had been mixed into something. He made a mental note to take it easy on the beverages offered.</p><p>It seemed that all the Aurors and their significant others (if there was one to be had) had made it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Senior Auror Belinda Whitakker noticed him over the shoulder of one of the newly promoted Aurors -Richards, maybe?- and her eyes lit up. She waved, smiling.</p><p>“Mr. Graves! Will you give a speech tonight, sir?” This request was quick to expand and be adopted by the others. He huffed out a chuckle, and accepted the drink that was quickly pressed into his hand.</p><p>“Alright, alright! Quiet down. Since you’ve sprung this on me-“<br/>“Louder!” Someone shouted from the back of the crowd. Throwing a good natured glare out over the crowds, he stepped onto the nearest chair. A small cheer resounded. He could put aside a little bit of dignity tonight, for this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“As I was saying…I know this past year has been difficult, considering the circumstances. I’d like to start by saying that I am very proud of how our Department has pulled together to get back on track. It takes sterner stuff to keep together and get back into fighting form the way everyone here has, and that’s something to celebrate. But that’s not why we’re here tonight. Tonight, we’re here to celebrate the promotion of those who join our Senior Ranks. The most promising recruits who, despite the insanity they have endured, have chosen to keep on with us. I know I speak for myself, and President Picquery, when I say that we are thankful. Thank you, all of you, for your continuing service now and in the future. Now, as I am the last thing standing between you and the punch- not you, though, Jacobs, I see you’ve already down a glass- I’ll get off this damn stool and let tonight get on.” He raised his glass in a semi-salute-semi-cheers, and swallowed his drink back in almost one-go.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Time fell into that odd space where it felt fast but slow, dizzying but steady on, as he fell into conversation with his colleagues. It seemed that as one conversation drew to a close, another started up seemlessly. When had he last spent this much time amongst his Aurors, not actively working? Too long ago, apparently. They all seemed pleased to have his somewhat individual attention for their small conversational allotments, grinning under his interest. Even his Senior Aurors, some of whom had been with him for years, were freer with their light ribbing and jokes. Overall, it was much more enjoyable than Percival was expecting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His normal brand of relaxation involved a book or paperwork in his home office, alone except for a glass of brandy and a fire in the fireplace. His house elf, of course, but Misty preferred to be out of sight until needed, even cleaning the rooms when she knew he wasn’t in them. Traditional that way.</p><p>Faces and conversations blurred together until one of the newly promoted Seniors stepped up to him, with a witch at his elbow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Mr. Graves, sir. Are you enjoying your evening?” The young man asked, smiling amiably. He had an almost full tumblr in hand, and his companion a glass of punch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I am. And you, Mr. Travers?” He returned, slipping his free hand into his pants pocket. The younger man’s smile seemed to get a bit brighter at the recognition, and internally Percival chuckled. The young ones were always pleased at a little extra recognition, even if it was just being correctly named by a superior. How long would that innocence last before it was corrupted by the other Aurors’ ribbing, he could only guess.</p><p>“Yes, sir! Oh- I’m bein’ rude, let me introduce my sister here. Mr. Graves, this is my sister Anne-Marie Travers. Anne, this this Percival Graves, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.” The woman beside him blushed lightly as she realized that Percival was, in fact, her brother’s boss.</p><p>“Ms. Travers, it’s a pleasure to meet you.” Percival extended his hand, and she gripped it to shake it. The firm grip was a contrast to the rather slim fingers, he thought, but it was a pleasant surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Please, call me Anne. Everyone does.” She said, smiling. It was that moment that her brother noticed both his sister’s and Percival’s glasses were empty. After taking their preferred drink refills, he rushed off across the crowd. With the atmosphere in danger of turning from comfortable silence into awkward silence, Percival reached for what was probably a safe topic of conversation.</p><p>“Do you live in New York too, Anne?” He asked politely.</p><p>“Oh no, I’m afraid not Mr. Graves. New York is Georgies’ stomping grounds- I’m up in Massachusetts. I teach at Ilvermorny, actually.” She said brightly.</p><p>“Percival, please. What is it you teach?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Charms is my poison of choice. Mostly First through third year classes, my colleague Professor Hicks prefers taking on the higher levels.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Ah, yes. I remember some talk around the office of a new Charms Professor. It was never my speciality, unfortunately.”<br/>“Talk here?” She tucked a strand of brown hair behind her ear as a part of her surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yes, there are a few Aurors here with children in school. There seems to be quite a lot of Thunderbird children from the DMLE, surprisingly.” He nodded, and she grinned.<br/>“Yes, well that does make sense though. Aren’t all Aurors supposed to be thrill seekers and troublemakers at heart?” She teased lightly. He laughed.<br/>“Not all of us. I was a Wampus- which I realize might not be helping my case.” She giggled.</p><p>“Not much to me, I’m afraid. I’m a Horned Serpent, so you’re all hooligans to me!” They shared a brief smile, though the conversation was cut off as George Travers returned with their drinks,</p><p>“Sorry, Annie, the cranberry punch was considerably more alcohol than punch-someone added more vodka, I think it was Heather- so I grabbed you a fruit cocktail. Here you are, Mr. Graves, no ice.” From there, the conversation turned to light work topics and respectful nods peppered with the occasional friendly tease from Anne. Eventually, George brought the conversation to a close, insisting that they mustn’t take up more of his time and that he wanted to introduce Anne to one of his fellow graduates.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It was a pleasure meeting you, Percival.” Anne said quietly as she passed him. Standing so close, he could smell the hint of a warm scented perfume.</p><p>“The pleasure was mine, Anne. Enjoy the rest of your night.” He responded, and watched the next couple steps she took as she walked away. He mentally shook himself just as another joined him, this time one of the more matronly Administrative Assistants wanting to confirm that the presence of Firewhiskey wasn’t going to be punished (“No, not tonight Mrs. Burbage.”). It took him a moment to understand what the woman had been asking, with the scent of Ms. Traver’s perfume still in his nose.</p><p>Later, as he sat in front of his office fireplace with his nightcap in hand, trying to avoid sleep, he mused over the meeting with the young Ms. Travers. It had been a long time since he had noticed a woman’s perfume. Time made longer by his stint in Grindelwald’s matchbox. A younger, less reserved Percival Graves might have pursued a longer conversation, tried a few moves to test the waters. He used to be very good with the ladies, although always making it clear he wasn’t interested in the long term. A night or two was safe. Something long term would have taken his undivided attention away from his work, and he had been so driven to reach where he was now. His longest relationship had been with Seraphina Picquery, and even that was both quite short and over a decade ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>These thoughts saw him to sleep, but nightmarish reruns of whispered <em>crucios</em> left him waking in fits and starts.</p>
