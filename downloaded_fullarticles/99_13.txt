    <p>[Avengers Towers]<br/>
Clint walked in the common room with a nervous look on his face. “What’s going on, Barton?” Sam asked for all of them. “Well, my nephew is visiting over the summer, and I was wondering if he could stay here.” Clint explained.</p><p>“You do realize that would mean he figures out our identities.” Steve frowned. “It’s fine. Dunno how, but he knows.” Clint replied. Tony looked surprised but responded, “If he knows, then yeah, he can stay over.”</p><p>“Ok. Well, I need to brief you then.” Natasha looked amused. “This isn’t a mission, y’know.” “Yeah, well. He’s shy, and wary, so don’t expect him to warm up to you. Try to make it obvious when you stand behind him, ‘cause once I tapped him on the shoulder, and he punched me in the face.”</p><p>“Eek.” Nat said, but she was laughing. “My point is, he has shown symptoms of PTSD, but I’m not sure, so…” added. “Kay. Peter, Ned, Shuri, and Michelle hang around here a lot, so they might become friends.” Tony offered.</p><p>“He’s Irish; lives near London. Has a bit of an accent. That’s all I can think of.” He admitted. “Oh yeah! His name is Seamus Finnigan!” They all laughed at Clint for forgetting this bit of information. The team nodded and they bustled to do what they had been doing.</p><p>[Time Skip]<br/>
“Hey! Seamus, how you doing?” Clint asked his 19 year old nephew who gave him a timid smile. They were at the train station, where Seamus had been sitting for the last 20 minutes. He was carrying a large duffel bag. “Fine.” Was the answer.</p><p>Seamus didn’t look that different from the last time Clint had seen him. His bruises were gone, but the scars that weren’t covered by his sweater were still there. He still had that tired, wary look, but he wasn’t glancing around and staying a good 5 ft away from everyone, which Clint considered a success.</p><p>“C’mon.” Clint said brightly. ‘Where are we going?” Seamus inquired. “Avengers Tower.” Was the answer. Seamus slid in the passenger seat and Clint started the car. They spent the rest of the ride in a comfortable silence.</p><p>After they went through all the security and arrived at the common room, Clitn wasn’t surprised to see the whole team sitting at the oversized dining table. “Hey kid.” Steve said lightly. “#1, Hi. #2, call me a kid and I will break your arm.” Seamus threatened. </p><p>“Well, introductions are to be made.” Sam said in an attempt to lighten the mood. Seamus sighed and took a seat at the table.</p>
