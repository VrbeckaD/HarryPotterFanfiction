    <p>Heloise Selwyn, better known as Hela, was considered quite strange, quite strange indeed. She didn’t seem to fit into the wizarding world or the muggle world. She was considered very unpredictable, which was part of the reason why she was on the run in the first place.</p>
<p>You see, Hela was a spy, a very good one in fact. She had spent the last couple of years working hard and fighting against some darkest forces the wizarding world had ever seen. Unfortunately, her fellow witches and wizards would never know of Hela’s bravery and determination. Usually, Hela was a striking young woman, with hair as black as midnight and sea blue eyes. However, in the current moment, thanks to a good disguise, she had messy brown hair and matching eyes, among various other changes.</p>
<p>On the bright side, she wouldn’t have to wear this disguise after today. Hela had a secret. Despite being a descendant of one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight pure wizarding families, two of Hela’s best friends were muggles. Clara and Leo Blake were two of the kindest people you would ever meet but were also the kind of people that purebloods despised. If Hela’s family knew of her relationship with the Blakes, it would not be pretty, but because Hela was the most unpurebloodish pureblood, she didn’t care. She loved the Blakes for their loving nature and energetic attitude towards life. Hela, herself was never the most open or outgoing person, but that was part of the reason she loved her friends so much. They made her feel happy and content whenever she visited them, which was why she was over the moon when she heard the news.</p>
<p>She was in West Virginia at the time. It was sundown as Hela was heading home after a long day at work. Point Pleasant was well known for its local folklore. Hela found all the stories about moth people very amusing. She believed that the ‘mothman’ was just a transfiguration job gone bad, but due to being in hiding, she wasn’t able to accept all the joke invites to go hunting for the beast, and confirming it for herself. At the time, she would joke with herself that once the war was over, she should come back with the Blakes and Moody, in order to search for the mysterious creature. Another thing Hela found funny, was thinking about how Point Pleasant would react to her witchleyness. If they knew about the waitress, who could turn into a Snow Leopard at will, they would surely lose their minds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The town, however, would never find out, due to the arrival of a beautiful horned owl, carrying a small note. Hela knew what this meant and quickly opened the letter.</p>
<p>Dark Lord defeated.<br/>
War is finally over.<br/>
Potters dead.<br/>
Son lives.<br/>
Sirius Black turned traitor.<br/>
Seek conference for more information upon return.</p>
<p>Despite having an idea of what the letter contained, she was still surprised by its context. ‘Potters son lives’ why would that matter to her? And ‘Sirius Black turned traitor’, she didn’t know why that statement made her feel so heartbroken. She barely remembers the man from school. Why did his betrayal make her feel so sad?</p>
<p>This feeling was overshadowed by the thought of getting to see her friends again! After waiting for what felt like the longest year of her life, she could finally see the people she cares about the most, and most of all, she could finally see little Mathilda again. She quickly made arrangements to get back to Ireland as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As she made her way across the country, she saw many signs that showed the news of the Dark Lord’s defeat. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You Know Who Finally Stopped!</p>
<p>Bless The Boy Who Lived.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was finally over. After all these years, was he really gone? Hela was having a hard time believing it. However, now was not the time for worries, now was the time for celebration! Her excitement grew as she got closer to Ireland.</p>
<p>Once she finally arrived, she saw Moody waiting for her.</p>
<p>“ADRIAN!” she yelled happily.</p>
<p>The two friends ran towards each other and embraced. Hela could see how he had changed while she was in hiding. Both physically and mentally. He had a couple of new scars, a little one on his left eyebrow, and a part of his right ear missing, but Hela could tell that he was still that bright-eyed punk she met all those years ago.</p>
<p>Adrian spoke first. “Merlin Hellzie, I didn’t realise how much I missed you till I saw you.”</p>
<p>“I’ve missed you too, you knob. How are Clara, Leo, and Mathilda?”</p>
<p>“They’re all doing fine. Come on, let’s go see them now.”</p>
<p>The two of them started making their way to the Blake House while discussing the recent events. </p>
<p>“I still can’t believe he’s gone.” Hela stated.</p>
<p>“After all these years, he’s really gone!” Adrian jumped happily.</p>
<p>“But what’s all this talk of the Potter’s boy.”</p>
<p>“Oh, It’s quite a story, I think there’s more to it, but the gist of it is that the boy survived the killing curse and defeated the Dark Lord. Can you believe it, a baby defeating one of the most powerful wizards of all time.”</p>
<p>Hela raised an eyebrow at her friend’s words. “No, I don’t believe it.”</p>
<p>The two of them continued walking and talking until they were interrupted by a familiar voice.</p>
<p>“Hellzie? Is it really you?”</p>
<p>Hela turned to see her oldest friend running towards her. Unlike Adrian, Clara had hardly changed in the year that Hela was gone. Same dark brown hair tied up in a messy bun, same round hazel eyes, and the same style of dress with the ridiculous pattern (this one having various fruits on it).</p>
<p>“Oh my God, it is you! How are you!”</p>
<p>“Same old.”<br/>
As usual, Hela tried to hide her emotions, but Clara’s pure energy made it hard for her not to smile.</p>
<p>“Tell me about America! Was it fun for you’re first time? Did you meet anyone? Did you find any cool magical creatures?”</p>
<p>If anyone else were asking these questions, Hela would have pushed them to the side for annoying her, but since it was Clara, she was more than happy to answer any and all questions she had.</p>
<p>“America was very nice. I felt like I got very lucky for my first time. No, I didn’t meet anyone who was particularly interesting. I saw a lovely flock of thunderbirds near New Mexico, and heard rumors of some kind of mothman, but didn’t see him.”</p>
<p>The three continued to talk, as they arrived at Clara’s home. Before going in Hela stopped Adrian.</p>
<p>“James and Lily. Are you doing alright after what happened?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Honesty, part of me doesn’t want to believe they’re gone. First Marlene and now them. It seems like yesterday, when we were all still idiot kids, running around without a care in the world, and now a bunch of the people I grew up with are just gone.”</p>
<p>Hela looked at him sympathetically. She didn’t have the same history with the Potter’s that Adrian did, but she could understand the feeling of what it was like to lose people. She knew about Adrian being James’ roommate while at Hogwarts and him being good friends with Lily. During school, Hela could never let herself get close to others, like Adrian and Clara. She just wasn’t that kind of person.</p>
<p>Hela’s thoughts were once again interrupted by another loud voice, this time with an apparent American accent. This one belonged to Clara’s husband, Leo. He was a strong-looking, dark-skinned man with dark blue eyes.<br/>
He was very similar to his wife in many ways. Both energetic and both could spread positivity just by looking at you.</p>
<p>“Ah Hela! Good to see you again!”</p>
<p>“Likewise Leo, How’s your baby girl been doing?” Hela asked with genuine curiosity.</p>
<p>Leo and Clara lead their friend over to their growing two-year-old. Mathilda Blake was a perfect combination of Clara and Leo. The young girl had her mother’s eyes and hair, and father’s complexion and ears. </p>
<p>After seeing Mathilda in person, after what felt like years, Hela secretly thanked her lucky stars for being able to be there with the people she cared about the most.</p>
<p>The four friends spent the rest of the afternoon catching up on the time they had spent apart and celebrating recent events. Well, they celebrated as hard as one could with a baby in the house. After the sun had set, Hela and Clara had ended up sitting out on the pouch with Matilda sleeping in Hela’s arms.</p>
<p>“So, what do you think of her?” Clara asked.</p>
<p>“She’s lovely.” Hela replied.</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear because there’s something we wanted to ask you.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Well, I wanted to wait and ask you in person, so now is the perfect time, would you be her godmother?”</p>
<p>Hela felt her heart stop for a second. Did she hear that right? Be Mathilda’s godmother. She didn’t think that she deserved this, but given all her hard work from the past couple of years, she had a sudden burst of courage.</p>
<p>“You know what? I’d love to.”</p>
<p>Hela could tell that her friend was trying her hardest not to scream with happiness. Little did any of them know; this was one of the last times they would all be together like this. Then again, if Hela did know of what was to come, there wasn’t much she could do about it.</p>
