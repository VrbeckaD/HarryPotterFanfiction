I am not hiding Ron’s present in your office. I’ve been in Holyhead the entire afternoon.” Something metallic glittered in her hand as she combed through one of the desk drawers. “I still need to get the damn card.”</p><p>Harry grinned somewhat cheekily. “Will it sing?”</p><p>She tossed an old paper memo at his head.  </p></div>
