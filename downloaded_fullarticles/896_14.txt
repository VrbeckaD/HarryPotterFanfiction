          <div class="userstuff"><p>Gakushuu Asano was a Horcrux. He knew this to be an irrefutable truth: he inspired acrimony in whichever land his person toiled. He didn't need to give any perspicacious elucidation to reiterate it - it was a fact as true as the fundamental that the sun will rise and fall each day. Oh, and did he fall. </p><p>He was noxious , a pestilence that consumed society with unmatched insatiability. There was no light . </p><p>He was a cauldron oozing with molten rancour - everyone around him was bound to burn: Ren, Seo and the othersâ€¦ He was sorry. No, he must not tell lies, he was only glazed in vaneer :incapable of handling abstract nouns of that nature .</p><p>He was a tattered tapestry, threads frayed and rough so much so, that the overall picture was distorted. His was predisposed to be a poor superimposition of his father's personality , inverted to look almost Psychedelic. Utterly enthralling when looked at from the other side of the gallery but not something you would put in the living room with your family, near your children and doting wife. Just an extension of The Chairman.</p><p>Why did he feel so obsolete ? Another trophy. Could he ever be a real boy? No, that place was  for Ikeda, don't be selfish. What is love? Something they will never have if you continue to breed their darkness .Leave,your place is behind desks and paperwork. A good little cooperate slave. Here have some crumbs.</p><p>The waves crash onto the pebble beach.The seas rock with Neptune's virility . The sky is Ruby tinctured. He feels angry . In the distance , a hand  reaches out from the murky waters , trembling as if the arm of an alarm clock fervently pleading to be released from it's misery. </p><p>It's OK. He doesn't need the main body . He's a Horcrux. He shall endure.</p><p>He can finally be a real boy.</p><p>You see the world is full of temptations - inhibitions which guide our subconscious - chipping away at any semblance of restraint until we are feral and submerged in a typhoon of rage.</p><p>He tenderly caressed a mangled rose on the casket , twisting it's thorns until they fell off with a satisfying click . His lips rose into a miniscule smile, eyebrows hiding behind his fringe as his saliva encapsulated the delicate blossom. Crunch. </p><p>I'm alive.</p></div>
