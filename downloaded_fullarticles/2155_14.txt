    <p>Prologue: One Night</p><p>“Sssshhhhh! You don’t want to get caught, do you?” whispered a rather drunk male voice. It was dark, they couldn’t see anything. No lights were on in the room and the night outside was just as dark.</p><p>“Well it wasn’t my idea to come down here, was it?” replied an equally drunk female voice. She couldn’t see him, but she knew he was close. She could smell the strong scent of Fire Whiskey on his breath. It didn’t matter that they’d hated each other since they met. Nothing did, because at that moment she wanted him and he wanted her. At least, for just one night.</p><p>A large hand reached out and touched her shoulder and pulled her forward. He was strong, stronger than she’d guessed. The fact of the matter is that he wasn’t the strongest looking guy. In fact, he was almost lanky compared to the others on the Quidditch team. But tonight, it didn’t matter. Before she’d had the chance to react, his lips crashed down on her’s.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his slim torso as he continued to attack her mouth. The passion in her burst as his hands made their way down her slender waist, trailing heat in its wake. His hands made their way back up to her shoulders, dragging the straps of her dress down. She gasped as his lips trailed from her lips to her neck and then her chest.</p><p>Her hands found themselves unbuttoning his shirt and before they knew it, there was nothing else between them. “Are you sure you want to do this?” he whispered, as his hands ran down her arms. She didn’t even hesitate before whispering her answer.</p><p>“I want to do this, I want to so badly,” she whispered. That was all he needed to hear in order to continue.</p><p>Her eyes snapped open and she groaned. She turned her head and shut her eyes tightly. The body next to her was not someone she’d wanted to see. He was not what you would call very handsome, his body was thin and he was slightly pale. His hair was black and stood out in all different directions and his eyes, those dark emeralds were hidden behind round glasses. A thin lightning bolt shaped scar visible under a lock of midnight hair.</p><p>Her mind raced with thoughts and nervousness. Had she just lost it to Golden Boy Potter? Draco may have been on decent terms with Potter but, he would never forgive what she’d done. They may be bestfriends and she had done things she wasn’t proud of and he’d forgiven but, she was sure that this was not one of those things. Fire Whiskey was a very dangerous substance and therefore, she would never let it touch her lips again.</p><p>He began to stir, and she knew then that she had to get the hell out of there before he opened his eyes. She picked up her dress and slipped it over her head. She knew it was still pretty early and that the possibility of any of the others being awake was very unlikely.</p><p>She picked up her shoes and rushed out of there as quietly as she could. She walked into the Slytherin common room and just about made it to the dorms when a voice made her start. “Well, I’ll be a Hippogriff’s uncle. Pansy Parkinson, just getting in at five in the morning,” Draco drawled, lazily.</p><p>Pansy’s head snapped up and she frowned. “I didn’t think anyone would be up. You look good, for someone who’d just about ingested a truck load of Fire Whiskey,” she replied, wittily.</p><p>“So do you. How is Potter? Did you merely give it to the chap and run? You little minx,” he said, good naturedly.</p><p>“You knew?” she asked, still standing by the door.</p><p>“Pansy I saw you leave with him. The two of you were stumbling out of the Great Hall completely pissed as a fart,” he said, making her groan again. That would explain the pounding headache.</p><p>“Well, it was just one night. It won’t happen again and he won’t even know it was me. Unless a certain platinum blonde twit says something,” she said, smirking.</p><p>“Your secret is safe with me Panse,” he said, smiling back to her.</p><p>“Thanks Draco”</p><p>
  <strong>A/N: Well that didn’t exactly turn out how I wanted. But, nonetheless it seemed okay. I’d had the urge to write a Harry/Pansy for quite some time so, here’s the first. Disregards the DH epilogue. The next couple of chapters may be short. They’re mainly so you can see what they have been up to since leaving Hogwarts.</strong>
