      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <strong>Initial Seduction</strong>
      </p>
      <p>"Class dismissed!" growled Snape.</p>
      <p>No one lingered long enough to incur more of his sour tasting wrath. It seemed that not all decided scampering was an option. Glancing up he noticed that the more tolerable of the Gryffindor's was malingering. Wincing slightly as she bent down to pick up her bag. In the course of the duel Miss Granger had, not only shed her outer robes, but her jumper also, showing the boys exactly what they were missing. It was that sight which had awakened something inside that he long since thought was dormant. Like a volcano he knew she would need to be claimed.</p>
      <p>Flushed cheeks, wild hair that he secretly loved and desired to grasp and unsteady breathing along with shining adrenalin-fuelled eyes caused restrictions in his lower body that was twitching and pulsing beneath his robes. Well, he smirked, he was not going to be teaching her much longer if the old goat was correct – and he had resisted temptation for his enforced career as a teacher. As this was not the first time he had fantasized about this particular Muggleborn this year, and it was only mid September.</p>
      <p>Decision made he cast silencing charms on his shoes and swooped behind her when her back was turned. Hermione felt his presence behind her and realised she was essentially trapped between him and the cabinets. Slowly, carefully, she pivoted on her heel and gulped when she saw the expression of raw desire present in his eyes.</p>
      <p>Somehow that caused her breasts to feel weightier than normal, her nipples taut beneath standard school blouse and definitely non-standard Teal satin front hook bra she was wearing underneath. Nipples visible through the sweat dampened white shirt. Lazily, his gaze swept down to her breasts now restrained just as his viper was inside him.</p>
      <p>Gulping, Hermione opened her mouth to speak only to have the words stuck in her throat as he swept his long fingers along her parted lips.</p>
      <p>"I am tired of fighting," he said to her. "It is exhausting to continually, and habitually, desire what one cannot have, do you not find?" He leaned in and breathed into her ear making her quiver down to her patent leather lace up shoes. "Hermione."</p>
      <p>Her name had never felt so forbidden before as it did that time he rumbled it into her delicate lobe. Gently sucking and nipping the curled edge. Once he reached the succulent flesh, he drew in the lobe with his teeth, tenderly he pulled and suckled like a babe does a teat.</p>
      <p>"Um, sir, is this..."</p>
      <p>"Shush, Hermione, you break rules for others, break one for me."</p>
      <p>Closing her eyes Hermione tried to resist this powerful, older man's seduction by unsuccessfully pushing him away. It did not help when that sinful voice, and those unlawful eyes were scorching her soul. Quivering with pleasure as she felt his large, capable hands grip onto her hips. His tantalising lips trailed long, open mouthed kisses down the column of her neck towards her shoulder.</p>
      <p>"Do not deny me, Hermione," he sighed against her throat as he tenderly sucked in the flesh in the dip of her collarbone.</p>
      <p>Hands had managed to untuck her blouse from her skirt so he could touch her warm, soft quavering flesh of her waist and stomach. NIMUE, she wanted to scream the moment flesh met flesh.</p>
      <p>"I'd be late..."</p>
      <p>"I'll write a note," Snape growled as he fisted her hair in his large strong hands. "I was in love once," he confessed. "A witch just like you. Bossy, interfering, but also like you, compassionate and beautiful."</p>
      <p>Hermione's eyes snapped open at that and willed for the strength to push him away from her – even she knew he'd thank her later for her rejection. Seduction was one thing but love meant he had been thinking about her for longer than she was comfortable with. Then he began massaging back and she was his to command.</p>
      <p>"Um okay, Pro-fess-ah!" his hand was now delving into her... blushing, Hermione wondered if he was thinking she was this other girl. "But sir, you do know I am not this person you loved, do you..." suddenly she felt his lips on hers as his tongue dominated her mouth.</p>
      <p>"I am well aware who you are, Hermione," he growled every syllable in his deep toned, Northern dialect that somehow did more to wet her knickers than before. "I am not using you to make me feel better or worse, I feel thousands type of crap all ready I just," he sighed as he cupped her face in his hands rubbing his thumbs under her eyes making her look at him: "I just need release, Hermione. I do not want a slag, or a victim. I just want some pleasure from a beautiful woman, or is that to be denied me too? I'm the big-hootered bat of the Dungeons. He sleeps in a coffin and hates garlic. Well," he pushed away from her and gazed into her confused expression as she took this for what it was. He did not want to be a Spy, Death Eater – heck he probably despised teaching and was told to teach the son of the boy he detested with a passion. "I happen to love Italian cooking when it is done well, garlic bread is a good staple for Italian dining. I despise mushrooms, I am Northern but was bullied into speaking like this by The Ultimate Sex God of all – Lucius Malfoy – who said my Mancunian tones set his teeth on edge. I eat carrots because it is true," he tilted his head, "they can help Magical folks see in the dark," Hermione looked from him to the door and realised that was a heartless thing to do. Snape needed someone to talk to – But why her? "I have always wanted a string of daughters with good hair, skin – I dreamed of them placed in Ravenclaw – I just wish I had someone who could see that I am not a... not a... a monster." He rushed his hands through his hair and watched with a certain detachment as he observed the locks slide between his fingers. "It is what I am though," he sighed slumping in a chair burying his face in his hands ready to cry.</p>
      <p>Slowly, Hermione walked to the door, pulled down the blind and placed a notice-me-not charm around the door frame. Cautiously, she approached the suddenly loquacious Professor.</p>
      <p>"Do you wish me to fetch Minerva, sir?"</p>
      <p>Shoulders shook and Hermione's heart broke over the sight of tears strolling down his face: "I see it in my head, every night, her death. I killed her, its all my fault. This is all my fault. Want to make things right but don't know what to do when we cannot resurrect the dead. I MURDERED HER GRANGER!" he threw a chair at the wall and it bounced of the wall in one piece with Hermione's quick thinking.</p>
      <p>"Whomever you did wrong too, sir, must have been so important for you to do all what you continue to do for us," she laid a shaking hand on his shoulder. "But seducing a student is not going to make you feel any better."</p>
      <p>Turning he gazed at her with tear filled eyes – Hermione wished she could drink his tears away for him. "Do you have any objections about sleeping with me, Miss Granger?"</p>
      <p>A hitch in her throat showed her true consideration. Did she? Well, obviously not as she was quite happy when his lips suckled, teased, and tasted her throat, ear and mouth. In fact she was so close to spreading her legs for him that she would have not had time to consider the whys and wherefores.</p>
      <p>"No," she sighed, "I do not think I would. In truth," she blushed.</p>
      <p>"Tell me," he teased.</p>
      <p>Slytherin on a pogo stick, Snape was flirting? Hermione shifted uncomfortably in her seat as she thought through her sexual history. She had already lost her virginity, long back to well... Then there was a Muggle boy eerily similar to Severus – even their names were similar – Steven Snape was her old friend. Snake boy, she called him, and he nicknamed her Foxglove. There was also that intelligent English Professor from a few streets down, about ten years older than her. Then, not her finest moment, one night with a somewhat suddenly friendly Theo Nott. Also, how could she forget two glorious months with... And, of course, her strange new choice in paramour. Could her older and darker choices have been leading up to this?</p>
      <p>"Um, I sort have had an older man before – a few older men actually."</p>
      <p>"Who were they?" Snape was looking for a handkerchief. Hermione bought out a packet of Kleenex and offered it to him. "To whom did you lose your virginity too?"</p>
      <p>The sudden change in atmosphere caused Hermione to wish that she had kept her mouth shut. There was nothing she could do to halt the blush that was delicately painting her neck, spattering down to her still straining un-satiated breasts. "ItwasSiriusBlack," she mumbled as she felt his onyx gaze on her.</p>
      <p>"Would you mind repeating that please?" Snape sneered."Slowly."</p>
      <p>Oh gods, she gulped: "I wanted to lose my virginity as I read about the first-time juices could be used as a protection charm extender and I was talking about it with Molly who said that her great grandmother's still around somewhere and can be used to protect still."</p>
      <p>"Slow down, Hermione, take a breath and calm down."</p>
      <p>Hermione nodded as her mile a minute story telling would end up with her in a faint on the floor. "Sorry," she smiled sheepishly. "Anyway. So, I started looking at the Order – out of the members there it was either Charlie, Fred, George, Sirius or Remus," her gaze fell down to her fingers twisting in a kind of invisible cats cradle. A few deep breaths were needed before she continued. Unaware of the slight colour change in his eyes. "I was pondering this then Sirius said he wanted to speak to me alone. It was just to make sure I was fine. I thought to myself that if anyone knows about wanting to protect it's him – so I decided to get a man's," Snape scoffed, Hermione glowered at him, "perspective. I confided in him my problem – he ranted, raved and threw his hands in despair at me – he was furious I had even picked up books from his library particularly the ones that dealt with blood wards. I reminded him that Lily saved Harry due to blood wards. He snarled at me that I was just a silly little girl trying to meddle in things I did not understand. Honestly," she rolled her eyes. "Then I rallied back: <em>Well, if you're going to be </em><em><strong>that</strong></em><em> immature about what I wish to do to protect my parents then maybe I will ask someone else. Someone who may understand blood magic</em>..." here she took a deep breath.</p>
      <p>"You threatened him with me, did you not?"</p>
      <p>Shaking her head Hermione smiled mischievously: "Draco, actually."</p>
      <p>"Ah, right. Hit him in the family, yes?"</p>
      <p>"Precisely," she said, hooking a chair leg with her foot and dragged it next to Snape as she sat down. "Anyway, he said he would not do it with me – so I began what turned out to be a short seduction of Sirius Black."</p>
      <p>"I hope you were of age."</p>
      <p>"I am practically a year older than Harry."</p>
      <p>"Ah yes, a September birth," he had wiped the last of the tears and hoped that in the haze of anger he'd forget his lust but no. She was sitting there, prepared to miss her next class and telling him of how she had lost her virginity to Sirius Black. "So, how did you lure the mutt?"</p>
      <p>"Be nice," she scolded through a smirk. "I ruffled his hair at the table, made sure to look at him with a dreamy smile. Get him hot under the collar – anyway, enforced imprisonment in Grimmauld Place coupled with his 12 years in Azkaban made him as desperate..." here Snape brushed hair behind her ear, leaned in and kissed below her lobe. Hermione sighed. "... Desperate," she continued, "for relief so he capitulated."</p>
      <p>"You mentioned another?" he asked.</p>
      <p>He needed no more details on how this beauty had sullied herself with Son Of A Bitch Black. Severus always loved how his initials were an acronym for his behaviour. It was as if Walburga knew. This time Hermione seemed <em>even more</em> reluctant to talk of whom had been her lover. This definitely piqued his interest. Hermione thought back to those beautiful months before <em>he</em> met his real love.</p>
      <p>"I really must..." she felt a hand squeeze her thigh.</p>
      <p>"Do not leave me, please?" he murmured as he rubbed his nose along the skin of her neck. "Who was your second paramour?"</p>
      <p>"Remus," she sighed.</p>
      <p>A small hope flickered inside her that these tales would cool his ardour, but she did not know Severus Snape. She certainly underestimated his hatred for the remaining Marauders. Not to mention his jealousy. Once it came to light she had been with the dogs Severus was more determined than ever to own her.</p>
      <p>"The wolf?" he sneered.</p>
      <p>First Lily now Hermione? What was it with intelligent Gryffindors? Severus found it hard to contain his fury.</p>
      <p>"It did not mean to happen, just one night we both suddenly found ourselves alone in my home. My parents had gone shopping and neither of us knew until we both desired a cup of tea. We set aside our books and shuffled over to the kitchen," she sighed as she felt his fingers rediscover her soft juicy treasure. "Anyway," she jumped as his thumb brushed her clit. "As he handed me the milk our fingers brushed and we both felt a jolt. Suddenly, instead of the kettle that whistled at boiling point it was us. From that moment on for the next two months he was on Order business to protect my parents and we found places to sneak off too and have a passionate fumble."</p>
      <p>Who'd have thought, Snape smiled. The goody two shoes actually had a relationship with Lupin! That he could understand more than the current woman whom Remus seems to have tuned his heart too.</p>
      <p>"Any others?" he growled as his fingers wished to dig deeper for their prize and open her up for something infinitely superior to his palm.</p>
      <p>Hermione did not want to mention that. Firstly, she didn't want to know his reaction, secondly – it definitely would not cool his ardour any more. In fact it may spur him on. She most certainly did not underestimate a Slytherin's possessiveness. In fact she was not sure if this constituted cheating.</p>
      <p>"Not... really..." she sighed as she felt her legs move so now she was practically sitting on Snape's lap. "Just... no..."</p>
      <p>"Tell me, Granger!"</p>
      <p>Here goes: "First Hogsmeade trip," she fidgeted. "I was on my own as Harry was moping over Ginny being kissed by Dean Thomas, and Ron was moaning about me; anyway, I went into Scriveners – the scent in that shop can calm me down more so than any draught and," interrupted by a hand covering her breast still wanting attention. Snape's mouth leaned in to cover the hardened nipple sucking on it to keep the little girl pleased. "Ooo – we should be..." then his other hand stopped seeking bounty down her panties as he undid her tie making sure she caught whiffs of her own scent to help her senses cave in to the feelings she was denying herself. "I want..." she became breathless with sudden desire to be kissed so deeply she could drown in him. "Anyway, my current... paramour... you called him..." gulping down the saliva that began gathering in her mouth. "Um. Well," he really was not going to like this. "I was looking at a beautifully silver wrought peacock quill. I had been desiring the quill for a while but it would take me," WHAT! Her mind screamed as she felt air hit her abdomen. It was then she looked down and saw her half-naked state. Tie discarded. Blouse chucked on the floor. Now all she had for modesty was a skirt that had been scrunched over her hips and tiny teal panties and front clasping bra: "Anyway, due to us seeing each other in the Slug Club I thought why not."</p>
      <p>She's going to tell me it's Potter! Snape sneered. Why not? He is his father's son: "Be honest, Hermione," he purred as he swiftly unhooked her bra, slowly slipping the bra straps down her arms making sure to gently scrape his nails against her quivering flesh as he did so.</p>
      <p>"Marcus Flint," she admitted. She decided to keep the Muggles and Theo a secret.</p>
      <p>Now Snape stopped admiring her beautifully luminous breasts with darkened pebbled nipples aching for succour from his mouth: "That troll?!" he said incredulously.</p>
      <p>"No he is not," Hermione defended her recent suitor.</p>
      <p>This sat uneasily in Snape's mind. Now the reason for his seduction: Other than the one he gave Dumbledore of course, had come to light. If she was with Marcus Flint and on her own with him then that could only spell disaster. What did she see in him?</p>
      <p>"I can be more man for you than that troll, Hermione," he promised as he swallowed a breast almost whole in his hungry mouth. Sucking, licking and pumping the little girl until her owner was panting and scratching his scalp with her nails. With a murmured spell he had rid them of their clothes and wrapped her legs around his hips. "Can you feel how much more?" he thrust up but not actually entering as he continued playing with her long, luscious locks between his sinewy, thin but oh-so-talented fingers. "Can you, Hermione?"</p>
      <p>Hermione could but she could only gasp, sigh and shudder as his hand glided around her skin now shining with sweat. "Yes, Professor, take me, Sir!"</p>
      <p>"With a great deal of pleasure," he purred as he shoved her against the cabinets – Hermione had not realised she was vertical once again. Her legs now firmly wrapped around her professor's waist as he guided his rock hard manhood into her now slick, open core. Easing himself in as he watched her eyes darken to molten toffee. Filling her with each delicious inch slowly – so she could feel the friction more when he finally decided to thrust – for now it was a genteel push. Not <em>one</em> of her lovers had felt like <em>that</em> before. "So tight, Hermione!"</p>
      <p>"That's because..." she panted as she felt all 8 inches of him nestled inside her.</p>
      <p>"Because what, my little witch?" he growled in her ear.</p>
      <p>His little witch? "W-What do you mean by my..."</p>
      <p>"I intend to <em>own</em> you, Hermione Granger," she looked up and saw his eyes change colour. Instead of whites showing his beautiful black orbs now became full slits of black shiny treacle. "Body, heart, mind and soul," he hissed.</p>
      <p>"Y-you... you're..."</p>
      <p>"A Veela, yes, it has lain dormant for longer than it should. Turns out there is a reason why, my little witch."</p>
      <p>Gulp!</p>
      <p>Hell!</p>
      <p>NIMUE'S KNICKERS!</p>
      <p>"W-when d-did..."</p>
      <p>"Today as you were duelling," he whispered against her tasty neck. "Why do you think I delayed you?"</p>
      <p>"The other..."</p>
      <p>"Was not my mate."</p>
      <p>Hermione processed this information. A Veela, as she knew from Fleur, were possessive of their intended mates. Throw in the fact that Professor Snape was also a Slytherin and could weave grudges into his cloak, Hermione was in for a sticky time.</p>
      <p>"Do I not have to be willing to..."</p>
      <p>"Oh yes," he breathed on her breasts. "I wonder, how old you are Hermione."</p>
      <p>"17 – yesterday," she answered. "I must admit I felt different then. Suddenly I looked at Ron, whom I have been sort of attracted to for a while, and I realised he disgusted me and when he slung an arm around my shoulders I wanted to vomit!"</p>
      <p>"That was my song causing you to reject him. Already your senses were feeling out for their true Mate – what about in the lesson?" this time Snape bent down and suckled the flesh at the edge of her collarbone.</p>
      <p>"I was at once wanting to be alone with you, I lingered and I usually wish to rush to my next class."</p>
      <p>"That is you already knowing, on some level, I desired you."</p>
      <p>Possibly, she thought though that was a sceptical thought: "So," she sighed as he began to slowly move within her. "What do we do now?"</p>
      <p>"Now, my little witch, I have to take you. Once the Veela within activates it needs to be... fed..."</p>
      <p>"Um," Hermione nodded as she continued to gaze into his eyes. Oval shapes of onyx set in his already characterful countenance took her breath away: "This lends whole new meaning to the term... bite me," she smiled.</p>
      <p>"It most certainly does, Hermione, however I cannot do that until I have alerted the staff to this thorny problem, and as we're mates – I wish to marry you legally too. On our honeymoon <em>then</em> I will bite you, my little witch."</p>
      <p>Hermione shivered as she thought of belonging to the Professor in every way when he thrust back inside her bringing her concentration back on the seduction in hand.</p>
      <p>The delicious moans of copulation from Hermione spurred Severus further on with his task as he pumped in and out seeking both hers and his, satisfaction. With grace and fluidity Hermione met his lunges in perfect synchronicity. Severus loved the feel of a slippery vagina encouraging his stirring rod to brew up a passion filled scream from his witch and mate.</p>
      <p>Sweet little moans, slight purrs of desire from his Veela, as it had found joining with his mate to be as wonderful as it had known it would be. The little witch that brought him to life was going to be one satisfied witch indeed.</p>
      <p>"Hermione, you realise once we've mated I will fiercely protect you against anything," he puffed out as he thrust deeper into her making sure she knew what and whom she belonged to now. "I will not take interlopers. This is the only reason why you are permitted to tell your friends of this. I. Will. Not. Tolerate. Boys. Drooling. Over. You. When. You. Are. MINE!"</p>
      <p>The last word yelled as he came inside her, his legs jolting furiously with the might of his orgasm, as Hermione dug her nails deeply into his flesh. The sounds of Hermione's panting was a romantic symphony to his ears, breasts bouncing with every thrust downwards, as she continued squeezing his rod with her own brand of possessiveness. Still seeking her own true fulfilment. Snape, being the unselfish lover that he was, angled down his delicious digits to her clit: "Come, Hermione, come be my mate."</p>
      <p>"Yes," she breathed as he played and rolled her clit around his thumb and forefinger.</p>
      <p>"Repeat after me: I Am Severus Snape Witch, I Belong to no other man!"</p>
      <p>This was cruel, he knew, but he wanted to hear it being said. The Veela demanded to know that it was in control. Panting with darkened eyes that Severus found too captivating, cheeks red and gleaming from their exercise, lips swollen and parted. Snape had never seen anything more beautiful in his life and could not wait to see her round with child.</p>
      <p>"I belong to Severus Snape, no other man shall have me!" she purred.</p>
      <p>"Not quoted directly from the source?" he mocked. "My if this is what Eros Embrace does to your brain I may make you write essays in the throes of passion."</p>
      <p>"You always tell me to paraphrase," she replied. "Please help me come, sir!"</p>
      <p>It was the sir that made him cave in. His penis had hardened within her and he thrust whilst pinching her clit – the harder the thrust the tighter the pinch until Hermione screamed so loud he was certain it went into the veil to mock Black.</p>
      <p>Once the haze had settled, Hermione slowly slipped off Snape and gazed shyly up at him through her lashes: "I cannot wait to be bitten by you, and be yours forever-more, Severus," she dragged his head down by the nape of his neck to kiss him once more before she let go and shakily got dressed. "By the way," she smirked a little, "Black was hopeless in bed – there is such a thing as being too gentlemanly – he was far too <em>needy</em>. You're just right."</p>
      <p>"Because we are meant to be, the Veela within knows this, and does what will only give you the greatest of pleasure, now no one can hurt you without me knowing it."</p>
      <p>Hmm, she licked her lips, so I am now Severus Snape's mate – and I do not seem overly bothered by this. Should this be concerning? Oh Merlin, he said I can tell Ron and Harry – how in Godric's Name – am I supposed to get that into normal everyday conversation? Bewildered by what happened she decided to walk down to the Great Hall and mull things over in her head whilst peering up at the enchanted sky lying flat on her back on the table. If she was told off – she would just move onto the bench.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Once he was on his own, Severus rushed his robes back on and dashed to the Floo: "Albus, gather the Order, I need to make a confession."</p>
      <p>Two hours later everyone was seated around the large sitting room of Grimmauld Place. Severus could feel someone's eyes on him and he turned to see whom it was. Fleur widened her eyes in surprise. Bill turned and nodded at his old teacher as did Charlie. Remus however glared blackly at Snape.</p>
      <p>"Well, Severus, what is this meeting you desired to be about?" Albus blue eyes twinkled.</p>
      <p>"I have been keeping a secret from everyone," Severus sighed. "There was a time when my mother's side of the family were contracted, for a time, to marry Veela's – the eldest son seemed to always succeed in finding a Veela mate. This was centuries ago and suddenly the practice died out. However," he took in a deep breath. "My Veela has been dormant, so much so I did not know it was there. At first it was awoken by a friend of the past but she clearly was not meant to be as..."</p>
      <p>"You would die," Fleur murmured, "yes, it iz sad, no!"</p>
      <p>"Then it went dormant completely after she married someone else, so I thought little of it until today when it suddenly found someone and this time my Veela would not take no for an answer. I have yet to claim her in the truest sense of the word but..." he decided to look at Fleur hoping she could restore the calm for when the torrent of abuse was going to be hurled at him: "I have seduced her thoroughly enough making my intentions known clearly, as my mate is not a dunderhead, she would know the significance."</p>
      <p>"May we know who the mate is?" Arthur asked.</p>
      <p>Good old sturdy Arthur, this would be the point where the Order Meeting would descend into anarchy: "This is the part I am dreading to relate to you, but tell it so I must," he sank down on the chair he had previously been sitting on, "you see," he sighed, "it turns out my mate is... um... Hermione Granger..."</p>
      <p>… Deathly silence rang over all ...</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><strong>AN</strong>: So this idea has been sitting around for awhile now. Four different types of callings. Same witch. One Order Member, one Spy, two Death Eaters... poor Hermione... sigh.. This will be a little more smutty than my usual...</p>
