    <p>The wood of the bar gleamed. Polished to such a high sheen that Hermione could see her reflection, even in the dim light. Funny how she'd never noticed that before. But then, she'd only ever been here with Malfoy before and it wasn't like he left her with much time to examine the decor. No, he was much more interesting than the pub's atmosphere. Even if it did feature a live piano player and more rich leather than a herd of cows.</p><p>She didn't even know why she'd come here without him. Maybe she was just a glutton for punishment.</p><p>"What in the…"</p><p>Hermione looked up from the bar at the bartender's words, one hand clenching her drink even as the other slipped down to grasp her wand. But the bartender didn't look afraid, he was simply staring across the pub, his eyes wide in disbelief.</p><p>Even when depressed her natural curiosity had her turning on her well polished barstool; looking across the opulent room for whatever had drawn everyone's attention. Instantly she found it impossible to breathe. Her heart growing lighter than it had felt in days.</p><p>Had he really…?</p><p>No, he couldn't have.</p><p>She couldn't forget his declarations. He wouldn't do this. He'd made that quite clear.</p><p>
  <em>"What, Granger? You think this can be anything more than it is now?" Malfoy sneered. "Like you really care anything for a washed up Death Eater!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Of course I care! I love you! I'd do anything for you! Hell! I'd walk through Diagon Alley in just my knickers for you! You idiotic berk!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He scoffed, "You'd walk in just these?" His fingers curled around the top of her black lacy knickers. "Right." He tugged her to him, nibbling at her neck, making her gasp when he bit down, leaving another mark on her body. Just one more physical reminder of all the marks he'd already left on her soul. "That will be the day. Just lay off. I came here to shag."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She mustered her strength and shoved away from him. Biting back the tears that came she shouted, "No! Now get out! I — I won't do this anymore!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He stared at her in shock for a moment. Suddenly realizing she was serious. "Gran —"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"NO! Out!" She screamed, pointing at the door.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Fine!" He bit out, grabbing his robes off the floor. When he collected his wand he gave it a swish. "But I'll take those. Can't have you doing anything stupid, can I?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She was thrown backwards onto the bed as her knickers raced off her hips and flew across the room into his hand. He smirked and stuffed them in his pocket before striding out of the hotel room, slamming the door behind him.</em>
</p><p>Still, it was impossible to deny what her eyes could see.</p><p>His glittering eyes met hers and she could only stare back, heat rushing to her face as he swaggered over to her. All eyes in the pub followed his every movement. No one could draw their gaze away from the pureblood's figure.</p><p>No one but Draco Malfoy could walk with such confidence when dressed in nothing but a pair of lacy black knickers.</p><p>Upon reaching her he reached out, his long fingers curling around the back of her neck and slowly pulling her forwards. She didn't resist. She couldn't resist. She'd never been able to resist anything when it came to Draco.</p><p>That was part of the problem.</p><p>His lips met hers, his teeth nibbling at her lower lip, making her gasp. She reached out to grab him, her hands landing on smooth, warm skin.</p><p>He teased her with his tongue, taunting her, making her forget where they were.</p><p>When he pulled away she moaned in dismay. Her heart lurched when he smiled at that.</p><p>"I do love you. It's just hard. Please,will you forgive me for being so terrible?"</p><p>She could only stare at him, her heart pounding in her chest. Hope began to spring up inside of her.</p><p>"Forgive you?"</p><p>"Come on. You know you want to, Granger. I really do love you."</p><p>Tears pricked her eyes even as a grin split her face. She threw her arms around his neck, pulling him into another kiss, not even noticing as he apparated them away.</p>
