  <h4>October, 1987</h4>
</div><blockquote><h5>Dear B.S.,</h5><p>I have been following your career with interest ever since your incisive article in the Daily Prophet a few years back — the one which shone a light on the failure of law enforcement to ensure fair and just trials for witches and wizards based on their family name. It was a great shame when it was pulled, the claims redacted and an apology issued by the paper. What was written was the truth, and there are at least a dozen innocents rotting in Azkaban for it while those more deserving of punishment walk free, as I’m sure you well know.</p><p>My intention in writing you is not to go on about old news, however. To be frank, I believe that we may be similarly aligned. By that I mean to say that you are still publishing various critiques of our government. I approve. It is a government in dire need of criticism. </p><p>As I understand it, good, up-to-date information is hard to find nowadays, with our politicians closing ranks and investigative journalists hamstrung. It just so happens that dirt on the Ministry’s dodgier dealings, fresh from a willing insider, is exactly what’s on offer here. Free of any strings, might I add. No compensation necessary. Yes, that may be hard to believe in today’s world, but I swear it’s the truth. If I get anything out of this, it’ll be either the sweet relief of having something better to read than Skeeter’s tabloids, or the sweet release of death.</p><p>Not that it’s a done deal.</p><p>Should my owl find you — and I have no reason to believe she won’t — she will stay for several hours to await a response. If you accept, then we can begin a working relationship post-haste. In hopes of smoothing things along, have a taste of the sort of things on offer: did you know that the Department of Magical Law Enforcement has been ordered to reduce their presence in Diagon Alley this month? Easy enough to corroborate with a bit of legwork on your part (or so I would hope) and only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Let it be known that there are friends yet in the Ministry of Magic. </p>
<h5>Sincerely,<br/>
A fan</h5></blockquote>
