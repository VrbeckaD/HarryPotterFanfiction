    <p>Madness Descending Chapter 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another gut-wrenching scream echoed off of Hermione’s quiet cell in St. Mungo’s Ward For Disturbed Witches and Wizards. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pressing her hands to her ears, she rocked back and forth as the whispering of voices got louder all around her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No. No. No. Please…Don’t. Go away.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She repeated over and over making her voice sound as small and as weak as possible. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She was broken. They all were. Ever since that day. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That day the war ended and both Ron and Harry had died right before her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> In the last battle, Neville ended up defeating Voldemort but not without Harry and Ron sacrificing themselves for the greater good of the Wizarding World. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Their dying screams echoed in her mind forever and her own thoughts were silenced as she slowly felt herself descending into a most certain madness. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Wizarding World was recovering from the war, and it wasn’t without it’s many casualties. One of them being her sanity. According to the doctors, she suffered trauma related psychosis and wasn’t looking at getting better anytime soon. The voices. They were many and they were loud. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The screams, both from her and inside her head. They echoed around her like the sudden pounding of the afternoon rain on the pysch ward’s roof. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It had been raining that day as well. Hermione remembered. Remembered how the rain came down and the lightening flashed across the sky.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> She was soaked to the bone. And now as she sat in her hospital attire up against the padded wall, she was covered in sweat making her think back to when her time with her best friend’s had suddenly ended. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rocking. Rocking. Back and forth. It was enough. It was all she could do. All she could do to find any soothing effect from the madness within. The rain was light, but in her mind it poured. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another broken scream ripped through her throat sending her into convulsions and just as she felt her body hit the ground and the world go dark.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> A male voice echoed in the barren land that was her consciousness. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> It had been so long since he had seen her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Now seeing her hair and clothes in tatters made his heart ache as he tried and failed to keep his shock to himself. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It had been ages since he finished studying to become a doctor but now it seemed to him that all his apparent hard work and training was failing him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hermione!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco cried as he gently lifted her broken body into his arms and cradled her against his chest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> He knew that if any of the staff saw him he’d be in trouble but at this point in time he didn’t have it in him to care. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Voices. Hallucinations. The same diagnosis that his mother had and effectively died from. He knew where it came from. They all had suffered in one way or another. The war took many prisoners and not all of them were ones you could see.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “For fuck’s sake…What in Merlin’s name has happened to you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> He said softly as he ran a hand through her matted and dirty hair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> She still was beautiful. So beautiful. And he knew he had to do everything in his power to make her well again. If not for her sake, then for the sake of the two boys that had cornered him that day and asked that he take care of her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Always. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry and Ron had known for years about his feelings towards their friend, and on that fateful day when they gave their lives, they knew they had no other choice than to confront him and make sure that their promises were kept. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That was when he knew, in this moment that he was the only one who could help her. Could save her. Gently reaching out with his mind, he caressed hers and spoke softly. Carefully. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hermione, are you in there?”</p>
