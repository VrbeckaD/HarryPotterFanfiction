    <p>I gave Tom a soft smile as he handed me the drink. He walked toward the end of the bar, and I held the glass in my fingers. The Firewhiskey was cold in the glass, and it burned going down, but nothing ever felt so good right now. I needed to feel something. I downed the drink, and Tom refilled the glass without complaint. I couldn’t remember how many glasses I’d had, but the room was moving and everything was fuzzy. I heard footsteps approach my spot on the bar, and finished the glass. </p>
<p>“Give me another drink Tom.” I’d said the words all night, but now they were said with a drunken haze. </p>
<p>“No.” The word surprised me, and I turned to see who’d spoken. The voice had an aristocratic edge to it that Tom didn’t possess. My eyes landed on Draco Malfoy’s signature blonde hair and gray eyes. </p>
<p>“Why not?” I asked, hating that he looked at me with pity. He knew. </p>
<p>Draco didn’t answer, just handed me a glass with water in it. His eyes brooked no refusal, and I swallowed the cold water. I didn’t realize I was sober again until the full force of my hurt slammed me in the chest. Draco paid my tab, and slipping his hand under my arm, led me outside. At the apparition point, he turned on the spot, taking me to Malfoy Manor. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his private wing of the manor, we sat in his room. The silence was deafening as we stood and stared at each other. Draco stood near the fireplace, his gray eyes locked on my brown ones in a mixture of pity and sadness. </p>
<p>“How did you know?” I asked, fighting the tremor that accompanied my voice as I spoke. </p>
<p>Draco grimaced, “I’d rather not say.” </p>
<p>I’m still not sure if it was the fact that he knew or my impending tears, but I placed my head in my hands and sobbed. The whole situation was hard to face, but it was necessary. His words rang in my head as we’d sat in his office. I couldn’t believe I’d let myself fall for Harry Potter. I never planned for it to happen, but it did. </p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, he’d fallen for me too. Or that’s what he wanted me to believe. We had spent the last 10 months in a torrid affair. Yes, he was still with Ginny Weasley, but he kept telling me he was going to leave her and be with me. And like the foolish girl I was, I believed him. His emerald eyes had always seemed so sincere when he said it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was guilty of wearing my heart on my sleeve. I didn’t hide my feelings from him, pleaded with him to leave her. That I could give him what he needed and that I often did. That we didn’t have to live this way. Draco knew about the affair. He warned me that it would end badly, but stood by me in a show of support. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco sat next to me on the bed, wrapping his arms around me as I cried. He made soothing sounds, rubbing my back. “Let it out. Tell me what happened.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In between sobs, I told him how Harry had broken it off for good in his office tonight. How’d he told me that Ginny was pregnant and that he had to do the right thing. How he hated hurting me, but that it was necessary. That everyone expected him to marry her anyway. I was a half-blood like him, but I wasn’t Ginny. He’d made that clear. </p>
<p>I glanced up at Draco with watery eyes and said, “You were right.” </p>
<p>Draco didn’t wear the gloating look one would expect him to. Instead, his gray eyes were filled with sadness. “I didn’t want to be right love.” </p>
<p>He held me as I cried more, soaking his expensive shirt with my tears. And the silence returned, punctuated by my sobs. When I had cried myself out, I pushed off Draco’s shoulder and glanced at him, determination filling my soul. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I knew Draco loved me. Before I’d let myself believe Harry’s lies, I had liked him too. Now, huddled in his arms crying my eyes out over the git who’d broken my heart, I didn’t realize until this moment how he must have felt. Guilt surged through me as I took Draco’s feelings into consideration. </p>
<p>I rose, placing a shaky hand to my lips, “Oh, Draco. What have I done?” </p>
<p>Draco’s eyes flashed, “Nothing.” </p>
<p>I could see the partially hidden anger and resentment in his eyes, but his voice was firm, “You did nothing Charlotte.” </p>
<p>New tears made tracks down my face, “ But here I am sobbing over Harry when I’m acutely aware of how you feel about me.” </p>
<p>Draco ran his hands over his face. He stood, walking to where I stood by the door. He took me in his arms, holding me gently as if he thought I would run away if he moved too quickly. One finger raised my chin to look at his eyes, and when he spoke, his voice was soft and husky. “Charlotte, I’ve loved you even when you got tangled in Harry’s path. I knew what he was doing to you. I knew all along he was using you but spared you because I believed you had to hear it from him. I knew you’d be at the bar when I saw Harry giving Ginny Weasley that ring in his office. I’d locked eyes with him and saw he didn’t feel bad in the slightest for you. Now I’m going to show how much I care about you.” </p>
<p>And he pressed his lips to mine with determination. He kissed me like he was trying to erase the memory of Harry Potter from my life. And in the resulting sighs that followed, he’d succeeded. Now the only thing on my mind was revenge. He needed to hurt as much as he’d hurt me. I remembered the last words he’d said to me. </p>
<p>“Charlotte, you are nothing but a dirty Slytherin, and I never loved you.” </p>
<p>I knew I’d make him regret those words if it was the last thing I ever did.</p>
