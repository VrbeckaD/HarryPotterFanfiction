  <strong>PROLOGUE.</strong>
</p><p>'Afternoon gathered guests. We are gathered here today, on the restored grounds of Hogwarts to bind these two together in Life, in Love, and in Magic on these hallowed grounds, beneath this old weathered tree where shared their first kiss. I, Severus Tobias Snape, by the Ministry of Magic of England, or more importantly by Potter himself, will be doing the honours of this...Interesting match.' </p><p>'Do you, <em><strong>Harry James Potter</strong></em>, take this beautiful Bride to be your loving Wife for all eternity; through sickness, health, heartache and through all the trials you shall face? Through the birth of your first child and through the others that may follow? Do you, Harry, take Luna Pandora Arissia Lovegood to be your lawful wedded wife?'</p><p>'I very much do, Sir.'</p><p>'<em>Good.</em>' </p><p>'And do you, <em><strong>Luna Pandora Arissia Lovegood</strong></em>, take this man, this Defeater of all Evil, Harry James Potter to be your loving Husband for all eternity; through sickness, through health, through the many trials you shall face hitherto? Do you, Miss Lovegood, take Harry James Potter to be your lawful wedded Husband?'</p><p>‘Oh, yes sir.’</p><p>‘Then by this power given to me today, by the trust bestowed in me by these two young adults in love, and the very magic that surrounds us, I do hereby declare Harry James and Luna Pandora Arissia Potter.’</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>‘You may now kiss the bride, Harry.’</p><p>‘Oh!’ Laughter followed this statement as both the groom and the bride took their first married kiss before the many members of the crowd. Harry’s face a rose peach that spread below his white collared shirt and black wedding cloak.</p><p>■□■□■□</p><p>‘<strong>SEVERUS</strong>!’ ‘<strong>SEVERUS</strong>!’ ‘<strong>SEVERUS</strong>!’</p><p>‘For the lover of, what Potter, what do you <strong>WA</strong>…?!’ His angered face paused on the last word as he stood before his flaring fireplace, his mouth opened at the sight that greeted him here. ‘What on—’</p><p>‘Sev-e-Sever-us…I…She…He…They…Huu…I was…I was…It’s my fault, it’s all my fault!’ He started to scream, and Severus took a step back from the younger man’s face; it was a young man that looked half crazed, half blind to anything around him but the fireplace in which he screamed at his Ex-Potions Professor—a young man that was half covered in blood from what Severus dark eyes could see through the green flames.</p><p>He tried for a word in edgewise, but his throat seized up as the man kept going, his downright messy head shaking from left to right with every second word out of his trembling mouth. The words, however, that caused Severus throat to seize were the ones that Harry kept repeating;</p><p>“It’s all my fault”.</p>
