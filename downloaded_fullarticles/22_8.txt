          <div class="userstuff"><p>I'm one of those people who has a million ideas and a million outlines that take hours of research to complete. Then I never actually write the stories because I'm a perfectionist who can never get the words just right. So, I'm looking for a Co-Creator that can write, at the very least, decently. I have most of the information and story covers (For Wattpad) made and done with, I legitimately just need someone to do the writing for me. You'll get credit for the whole story most likely. i just want to be able to enjoy that fact that the stories I come up with are being read by people. Contact me on Wattpad (DeathRose500), Fanfiction (ShadeNight500), or here on this website if your interested.</p><p>Some of the stories are crossovers, some are original, and some stand alone (Novels, short stories).</p></div>
