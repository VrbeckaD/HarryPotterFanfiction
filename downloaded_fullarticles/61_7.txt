    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>We were losing; I could feel it in my stomach as I gathered with the last of the students and Order members in the Great Hall. Voldemort called his followers back and we could breathe for a moment. Bodies littered the Great Hall, some covered in shrouds. Remus and Tonks were mere feet from where I sat in the dirt and rubble.</p>
<p>Beside me, I saw the lifeless blue eyes of my best friend, staring back at me. Ron's normally freckled face was ashen and lifeless. I cradled his hand in my own, pushing his hair away from his eyes, which looked back at me unseeing. I looked away, noticing Harry at the entrance of the Great Hall. He locked eyes with me and I shook my head slowly.</p>
<p>I watched him run over, stopping at Ron's feet in shock, looking incredulous at the sight of the two Weasley bodies on the floor. The remaining Weasley's were weeping over Fred's body, next to Ron's and for the life of me, I couldn't hear it. It's like the world around me had gone silent. Harry's eyes teared up as mine had, but mine refused to fall.</p>
<p>"I watched the memories," Harry's voice broke through my bubble as he crouched by Ron's head, laying a gentle hand to close our friend's eyes.</p>
<p>"Harry-" I started but he cut me off.</p>
<p>"I think you know Hermione, you know what I am," His voice was thick with emotion and I nodded, my tears finally falling.</p>
<p>"I'll come with you," I whispered. He pulled me up suddenly and we walked out to the front hall, away from the mourning of our friends and comrades. Kingsley was there waiting, looking resigned as he put up a silencing charm for the three of us.</p>
<p>"Harry, what are you doing? Kingsley?" I asked the man, as Harry faced me.</p>
<p>"No, you need to stay here, Hermione. I need you to be safe. I couldn't protect Ron, but I can protect you," He spoke determined, looking up at me with hard eyes.</p>
<p>"Harry James Potter, that is not your call to make!" I spoke sharply, "I'm going with you."</p>
<p>"I won't let anyone else die for me. No one should have. Kingsley, keep her here," Harry spoke up, looking behind me.</p>
<p>I tried to follow Harry, but arms circled around my waist, holding me back. I screamed and cried, watching Harry retreat from the Front Hall, heading towards certain death. When Kingsley was sure Harry had gone, he released me slowly. I was frozen for a moment before I realized what I was craving at that moment.</p>
<p>Before Kingsley could catch me, I was running as fast as I could. Up staircases and down hallways, before jumping over the destroyed Gargoyle statue. The door to the Headmaster's office was open and I searched the walls.</p>
<p>"Professor!" I called, rousing his portrait.</p>
<p>"Ah, Miss Granger. I knew I would see you shortly after Harry," The old man in the portrait smiled at me knowingly.</p>
<p>"What did you tell him?" I demanded.</p>
<p>"Only what was shown to him," He gestured to the Pensieve.</p>
<p>"You knew, you knew all along he was a Horcrux but you didn't give him any clue? You sent him to die! A lamb to the slaughter! Ron is dead, and you gave us nothing but a book and a Snitch to go on. You led us on a wild goose chase, all so you could hand him over at the last minute to die! Defeating Grindelwald wasn't enough, was he? You had to outmaneuver Voldemort from beyond the grave. Had to prove to everyone that the <em>great</em> Albus Dumbledore was still the greatest sorcerer who ever lived. Harry trusted you; we all did. You are just a coward who uses pawns to accomplish your goals." I spat.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger, I only told him the truth. I only put him on the right path, so that you may accomplish something the world believes impossible."</p>
<p>"What?" I asked, confused, "I don't understand."</p>
<p>"Your hunt for the Horcruxes allowed us to know the locations, and how they can be destroyed. You'll find on the shelf, next to the Sorting Hat, a box. It is something that will put you on <em>your</em> path."</p>
<p>I looked over, carefully climbing the ladder to where the Sorting Hat once rested. Pulling the box down, I placed it on the desk, opening it slowly.</p>
<p>"My time turner," I breathed.</p>
<p>"Not quite."</p>
<p>"It's not the same?" I asked, still looking at the circular rings surrounding the hourglass. The sand inside was not gold, but red, pulsing with energy. There were runes I knew had not been there before. Predestination, resurrection, sacrifice and a fourth I couldn't place.</p>
<p>"This Time Turner is unlike the ones the Ministry destroyed. It was experimental of Severus and I to change it, but there needed to be a Plan B."</p>
<p>"Snape helped you change this? How far am I going back? I thought bad things happened to those wizards that messed with time?" I furrowed my brow as I looked up at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Severus concocted the potion that imbued the turner with power, to allow it to go back further than the maximum amount of time of the previous models. The runes help guide the Turner. Indeed, bad things do happen to those who tamper with time. But I'm afraid this must be done. Do you love your friends and wish to prevent their deaths?"</p>
<p>"More than anything."</p>
<p>"And you wish Harry had grown up with his parents, loved and happy?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I teared up, feeling hatred for the Dursley's.</p>
<p>"And you'd do anything to see Voldemort fall? Even giving your up own life in promise of his destruction?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I straightened my shoulders, drawing on my Gryffindor courage.</p>
<p>"Then you, Hermione Granger, Muggle-born witch, the Brains of the Golden Trio, the brightest witch of your age, <em>must defeat</em> the Dark Lord. You are armed with all the knowledge of your experiences, of what Horcruxes Tom has created and how to destroy them. You know who will betray whom, and who will need your help the most. You know what to brew and what to save for a rainy day. There will be no return from this choice. Are you ready?"</p>
<p>I thought about saying goodbye, not knowing how far I would be going or if the present would change, depending on what I changed in the past. The butterfly effect was a powerful thing. Would I even exist?</p>
<p>"How far am I going?" I asked again, squaring my shoulders.</p>
<p>"If my calculations are correct, you should land somewhere in the summer of 1977. You would be completing your Seventh Year, during which time Harry's parents were also set to graduate."</p>
<p>I let out the breath I was holding, looking at him in confusion.</p>
<p>"You… you want me to go back that far? I wasn't even born yet!"</p>
<p>"You may find, with this changed timeline, you may not even run into yourself in the future. Or well, our present time. The Time-Turner will destroy itself upon arrival of your intended destination and time, so do not worry about it falling into another's hands, or myself using it again," He explained, "Miss Granger, time is running out. Take Severus's memories from the pensive, and the bottle at the back. You have your bag."</p>
<p>"Yes sir," I nodded, collecting the memory and corking the vial, before grabbing the second. They glowed as I gently placed them in my bag, nestling them with the few vials of potions I still had from our hunt.</p>
<p>"There is a bag underneath Fawkes perch, it may be heavy, but you will need it," He nodded. I went to pick it up, hearing the jingling of coins as I heaved it onto the desk.</p>
<p>"What's in here?" I huffed out of breath, peeking inside and nearly fainting at the sight of a tremendous amount of gold.</p>
<p>"That is the content of my vault before I died. Gringotts has no way of tracing it back, so please put it away safely when you get to where you are going. It will aid you on your quest."</p>
<p>"Of course sir," I answered a little dazed as I cast a Featherlight charm and put it into my beaded purse, "Thank you."</p>
<p>"Hurry now," Dumbledore's portrait beckoned me back to the desk.</p>
<p>I sighed, pulling the chain around my neck, following his instruction to prick my finger and spill a drop of my blood into the sand. It glowed brighter, and I let out a shaky breath, wondering what the hell I was doing tampering with time.</p>
<p>
  <em>I am saving Harry and Ron from this life. I am doing this for them.</em>
</p>
<p>"Sir… what was in the Snitch?"</p>
<p>He sighed, "The Resurrection Stone. It was the stone on the Gaunt ring. It will curse any who try to use it before the Horcrux has been destroyed. Please, when you find the ring, do not let me see it."</p>
<p>"I can promise you, that I won't let you near it."</p>
<p>"Miss Granger, your mission is top secret, except to my past self. I should be in my office, and may not take lightly to a young woman just appearing out of thin air. Use whatever information necessary to convince me. I do mean <em>anything.</em> Twenty one turns."</p>
<p>"Yes sir," I nodded, turning the small dial. <em>One, two, three, four, five</em>…</p>
<p>"Good luck Miss Granger. And remember that while you are on a <em>mission</em>, you have allies. Allies can also become friends, friends become family, and families can last a lifetime. It's what you have been fighting for, it's what we <em>all</em> fight for. Love will <em>win</em>."</p>
<p>…<em>Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one.</em></p>
<p>But unlike the Time-Turner I used in Third Year, it felt more like apparating, using the Floo and a Portkey all at once. I felt the tugging behind my navel suddenly, before I was stumbling to get my footing, back in the same spot.</p>
<p>My head was swimming, seeing the familiar office. I sank to my knees, trying to keep my stomach from heaving from the force of magic surging through my veins and the dizziness it gave me.</p>
<p>"Miss, how did you get in here?" A familiar voice said, and I turned in time to see Dumbledore, with the Elder Wand, pointed at my face.</p>
<p>"<em>Professor</em>," I breathed, feeling my body pitch forward as I lost consciousness.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I stirred as gentle, warm sunlight shone down on my face. I hummed, smelling the familiar cleanliness of the Hospital Wing. We had been in here so many times with Harry, Ron in Third and Sixth Year and myself in Second Year twice, that I knew where I was as I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>"<em>Poppy, has our guest woken?</em>" A familiar voice asked.</p>
<p>"<em>I believe she is just rousing. That scar on her arm, Albus…Whoever could do such a thing to another human?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I know, I will be asking about that. Would you mind giving us the room?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I should go see Professor Slughorn about my supplies for the coming year</em>," The MediWitch's voice replied before I heard the doors open and close behind her.</p>
<p>"Now, my dear. I believe we need to have a little chat," Dumbledore spoke as he rounded the partition around my bed.</p>
<p>"Of course, sir. Would you prefer the Pensieve or Legilimency?" I asked seriously, "Because there is a lot I need to tell you, and some of it requires actually witnessing it, to believe it."</p>
<p>"My dear, I am at a disadvantage. You know who I am, but I have not caught your name. You are skilled Occlumens, even when unconscious," He commented, making me smile knowing my mental shields were holding strong.</p>
<p>"My name is Hermione Granger. I am a Muggleborn, born on September 19th, 1979. I was sorted into Gryffindor in 1991," I spoke, watching Dumbledore's face fall.</p>
<p>"That is not possible."</p>
<p>"Then please, use Legilimency. Because my memories and experiences <em>are</em> real, and I won't be told otherwise."</p>
<p>He regarded me quietly, before pulling his wand out, locking eyes with me once more and muttering, "<em>Legilimens</em>."</p>
<p>I relieved a shortened version of my life as a witch, seeing everything from the Basilisk's reflection, to my recent torture at Malfoy Manor. I saw Harry running from the Great Hall, Ron's lifeless eyes, and myself yelling at Dumbledore's portrait before he pulled back softly.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger… You are indeed far from home," He commented in a small voice.</p>
<p>"No sir. Hogwarts <em>is</em> my home. I'm lost in time," I corrected. He nodded once, studying me once more.</p>
<p>"Voldemort is defeated once, by a mere child. But he returns?"</p>
<p>"He split his soul into Horcruxes. At this point in time, I believe he only has five Horcruxes, but he will make more if he isn't defeated soon. He believes seven to be a powerful magical number."</p>
<p>"That is disturbing. How were they destroyed?" He asked, getting up to pace.</p>
<p>"Basilisk fangs, their venom specifically, or Fiendfyre. And the sword of Gryffindor. It was used in my Second Year to defeat a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets. The sword was Goblin made, and took on the venom, which helped us destroy one."</p>
<p>"He used his paternal grandfather's ring, a diary he kept while in school here, the Locket of Slytherin, the Diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw, and the cup of Helga Hufflepuff," I listed, watching him pale.</p>
<p>"Did you locate them all in your time?"</p>
<p>"Yes. The Locket was in the Crystal Caves, a place he had visited with his orphanage. The Diary may be in Malfoy Manor at the moment, for safekeeping. The Cup in the Lestrange vault in Gringotts. The Diadem is in the Room of Requirement and the Ring is hidden in a shack on the Gaunt grounds, under some rather nasty wards and enchantments."</p>
<p>"My dear, you sound as though you have been through hell."</p>
<p>"I have, sir. But I made a choice to come back, so no one has to go through what I did," I spoke plainly.</p>
<p>He nodded, waiting patiently for me to continue. I told him about the Time-Turner and how Voldemort would eventually gain a sixth Horcrux with Nagini, and then the seventh Horcrux in Harry. How Harry had been abused for most of his life and found a home in the Wizarding World. I explained which Order members would stand the test of time and which would fall before Voldemort did in 1981.</p>
<p>We spoke of who was to be protected and who to distrust. And by the time I had laid all the cards out, he regarded me with familiarity, as if we had fought through a war together.</p>
<p>"I assume you are not of age, and you would be out of school."</p>
<p>"I am, actually. Because of my Time Turner use, I am physically 18, but it would be best to resume my studies, to gain the trust of the Marauders."</p>
<p>"Ah, so their group lives in infamy in the future. They would love to hear that, though not for the reason they would like," He smiled.</p>
<p>"My task involves protecting them. And with that, I find myself torn from wanting to redeem Peter, and save him from his mistakes, or to separate them early to avoid the disaster altogether. He always felt he lived in their shadows, but was he so unhappy that he couldn't see that they loved him like a brother, and would have died for him?"</p>
<p>"I take it you spent a lot of time with the remaining Marauders."</p>
<p>"Remus and Sirius, yes. Remus was our Professor for Defense in our Third Year, and we would discuss books and have intellectual conversations over breaks. Sirius was… childish, but he managed to keep the atmosphere light even when we were surrounded by so much darkness. We would have long discussions when he wasn't spending time with Harry. He was Harry's godfather."</p>
<p>"And this means you are privy to information about Mr. Lupin," He pursed his lips.</p>
<p>"Yes sir, that he is a werewolf. I have, in my bag, the potion instructions for Wolfsbane that can help him keep his mind during his monthly transformations. It was only invented two years from now, so it would remain a secret as to how I developed it. Though, I am at a loss to how I would even begin telling him I already know."</p>
<p>"I believe if you were to present it to him, it would allow him to trust you much faster than if I gave it to him and said you brewed it," He suggested.</p>
<p>"The only issue is that it is expensive to make. It will not subdue the pain, and apparently it tastes awful. It should not be sweetened thought, or it renders it useless."</p>
<p>"Alright, we will discuss the particulars later. For now, I believe we need a cover story for you."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. I can't believe I forgot about that. My name isn't in the Book is it?"</p>
<p>"Nor at the Ministry, I would assume, as you haven't been born yet. I will have to forge you papers, which, is one of my many hidden talents."</p>
<p>"So, who do you believe I should be?"</p>
<p>"Your name, would have raised a flag or two, if you have been born in under three years time, but there is something to be said for the power of a name. My future portrait, as I assume I had passed in your timeline, told you that you might not even run into yourself. You essentially, erased yourself out of existence, while simultaneously implanting yourself here."</p>
<p>"So, my life… won't happen?" My eyes began to water slightly.</p>
<p>"No, my dear. I believe that was the price you must have paid to travel so far back. You cannot be here while existing in the future. You were, plainly speaking, born into existence the moment you appeared in my office."</p>
<p>"So… I'm the orphan now," I mumbled sadly, before giving my head a shake, "Sorry, that was terribly self-important sounding. I did this for Harry and Ron, not for myself."</p>
<p>"I understand you're hurt. I believe my future self must have acted upon that hurt to entice you into this situation, and for that I am sorry," He spoke, patting my hand softly as I wiped away a tear.</p>
<p>"Your apology is for something that has yet to happen, and if I have my way, it will not happen. I will, however, take comfort in the fact, that whatever your future self did to coerce me into this situation will not come to pass, thus canceling out my anger. You do have a habit of coercion though Professor, and I will not put up with it. My mission is defeating Voldemort before he can even get within shouting distance of killing Harry. Right now, that includes protecting Lily and James. The rest of the Marauders, the Weasley's and anyone else that passed in the previous timeline included, come before your ambitions."</p>
<p>He smirked at my bold ultimatum, nodding, "I understand, my dear."</p>
<p>"There is a teacher here that always wished for children but could never have them herself. It is why she chose to teach, and I believe that she would take you in. You could retain your given name of Hermione though. It is quite pretty."</p>
<p>"Thank you. Which teacher?" I asked, confused.</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall."</p>
<p>I sighed, "If she agrees. Would she have to know <em>everything</em>?"</p>
<p>"I believe Minerva could handle knowing what you have told me, but nothing about the Horcruxes. But for now, I believe you should simply be a victim of war, claiming sanctuary. It is a hard enough thing to swallow that you came from the future. We could claim you as a distant niece on her mother's side if she agrees. I will forge transcripts for you from say, Beauxbaton's or even Ilvermony in America."</p>
<p>"I speak fluent French sir, so Beauxbaton's would be the more logical choice. But America is further away, and people are less likely to look into my records, or lack thereof, over there," I pointed out.</p>
<p>"Perfect. We can explain the more pertinent information that you had a run-in with blood purists, Death Eaters and that you wish to fight once you graduate."</p>
<p>"While it is true, I don't believe she will take that easily. She's isn't a part of the Order yet, but she knows how dangerous it is."</p>
<p>"Good, you are aware of the Order. Well, you leave that to me. In fact, why don't I get her and introduce you now?"</p>
<p>"It would be nice to see another familiar face, even if she won't recognize me," I gave a nervous smile.</p>
<p>"Expecto Patronum," He spoke, his Phoenix Patronus taking a non-corporeal form as he continued to speak, "Minerva, if I could trouble you to meet me in the Hospital Wing."</p>
<p>The ball of light flew through the door and disappeared.</p>
<p>"Now, you are a distant cousin, but she may end up asking you to call her your Aunt, to keep things simple. The Ross family, while known, won't notice it because most haven't been in the country for some time. I imagine at one point you may get married in this timeline and you're name will change again."</p>
<p>"Married? Sir, I have to graduate first! I may not even live past this war," I exclaimed, making him chuckle.</p>
<p>"My dear, anything is possible. So you may be a Ross for some time."</p>
<p>"Hermione Ross," I tried out, "Hmm, it would take some getting used to, but I imagine I could do it. And for the students and teachers, the reason I am not in the Ministry records was because I was born in France on a holiday, but my parents moved to America mere months later."</p>
<p>"Perfect. She will, of course, know the truth, that you are simply… on your own."</p>
<p>"Albus," A voice called as the door opened.</p>
<p>"Here Minerva. I have someone I wish you to meet," He smirked at me, a familiar twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall, please meet Miss Hermione Granger," He spoke as she came to stand at the end of my bed. I gave a smile and said, "It's wonderful to meet you Professor. The Headmaster was just telling me how accomplished you are at Transfiguration."</p>
<p>"Oh, well thank you dear. It's is nice to meet you as well," She smiled warmly, "But however did you get in the school? It's the summer holidays."</p>
<p>"Minerva, this young lady was found on the grounds on my walk yesterday evening. She has just recently lost her parents and was happened upon by <em>blood purists</em>. She escaped with the foresight to seek asylum," He spoke slowly and we both watched her eyes light up in worry.</p>
<p>"Oh, you poor child. Were you harmed?"</p>
<p>I nodded, looking down to my left arm, and turned it to show her. The red, angry letters screamed at me, as she gasped. It was still a shock to my own eyes but to anyone that didn't know it was there, it was just as distressing.</p>
<p>"My dear," She said, hand coming to cover her mouth in shock.</p>
<p>"It was a cursed blade. It won't ever heal completely, even with magic. And Essence of Dittany won't let the scar fade," I shrugged, knowing there wasn't anything I could do to change it.</p>
<p>"We would like to enroll her for the coming school year," Dumbledore spoke up, "But she would need a guardian. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind claiming her as a distant cousin, on your mother's side."</p>
<p>"Are we hiding her?" She asked Dumbledore, and I wasn't offended when she didn't question me herself.</p>
<p>"Yes. There is a great deal to Miss Granger that would be useful to our side, as she has already told me she wants to join the fight once she graduates."</p>
<p>"And what year have you completed last?" She asked me next.</p>
<p>"Sixth," I replied. While I was busy in my Sixth Year, my grades were exceptional, despite Harry's obsession with Malfoy and the Half-Blood Prince's potions book. <em>Which I had a chance to copy before Harry had Ginny hide it for him...</em></p>
<p>"Now, be honest, how were your OWLs," Dumbledore asked.</p>
<p>"Outstanding's in Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, History of Magic, Transfiguration, Potions, Charms, Astrology, Care of Magical Creatures, Herbology, and an Exceeds Expectations in Defense Against the Dark Arts. I believe our teacher fifth year had it out for me because I am Muggleborn though, as every other year I received an Outstanding. The classes I took in Sixth were all Outstanding's though. I was set to take the Seventh Year NEWT level classes this year," I concluded. Umbridge really did have it out for me, but because Harry, Ron and I started an illegal dueling club to combat her inability to teach us defensive spells.</p>
<p>Both of the professors stared at me with astonishment.</p>
<p>"I was known as the Bookworm of my year," I explained, "But I can't stand Divination and Muggle Studies was too easy. I need a challenge. I did not take Herbology, Care of Magical Creatures, or Astrology in my Sixth Year though."</p>
<p>"I believe Miss Evans and Mr. Lupin will have some competition," McGonagall smiled.</p>
<p>"Indeed," Dumbledore smiled.</p>
<p>"Well, I would be glad to take you on as my ward, Miss Granger. But may I suggest we not broadcast your Muggleborn name. These are dangerous times," McGonagall frowned in concern.</p>
<p>"We were thinking the same thing. If we were to keep her safe, as safe as we could we would have to claim her as a half-blood at least, on the Ross side," Dumbledore suggested.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not ashamed of being a Muggleborn. I know you must have a few in the school," I offered.</p>
<p>"Yes, but we cannot change <em>their</em> names suddenly to keep them safe. You, on the other hand, would be safer taking on a wizarding name and claiming you are half-blood. It would put off suspicions as to why the Ross name hasn't cropped up, because your mother left the Wizarding world for a Muggle. But you wished to learn magic and Ilvermony was the closest school to you. Which isn't far from the truth of your parents being English and moving to America."</p>
<p>"I would believe it. The Ross women have always gone against the norm," McGonagall smiled at me.</p>
<p>I sighed, thinking to myself I was losing everything that made me Hermione Granger. My parents, my life before whatever messed up magic Dumbledore left behind for me, my last name, my identity as a Muggleborn…</p>
<p>"If you feel it is best."</p>
<p>"We do," Dumbledore nodded, after exchanging a glance with McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Alright. My name is now Hermione Ross, half-blood," I conceded.</p>
<p>"Wonderful. Well, I believe we need to sort you now," Dumbledore smiled and I put on a cheery smile, internally wondering what his future self was thinking of sending <em>me</em>. I was going to mess up and say something I shouldn't; I just knew it.</p>
