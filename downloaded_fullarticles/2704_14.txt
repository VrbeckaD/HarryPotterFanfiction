          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry rarely deals with dementors now but it still a thrill to see his patronus when he does so. He is left aching and tired yet satisfied for hours. It is only as he grows older and his position as Head Auror gets more jaded that the silver stag becomes more problematic for him. Others have seen forms change.
