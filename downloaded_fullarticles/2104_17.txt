    <p>1976</p>
<p>Autumn</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Prime Minister Callaghan will address the Inquiry at Scotland Yard over the riots at Notting Hill Carnival later today… In other news, tensions between increased British troop and IRA paramilitary in County Armagh were exacerbated yesterday by mystery men, who appeared to be neither IRA nor British Army. Described as wearing black cloaks and masks over their faces, they were seen in the area just before the discovery of five Catholics murdered at a desolate roadside. Green fireworks also appeared to have been set off nearby, no word as of yet whether the two events are related. National Security is expected to release a statement within the hour…”</p>
<p>Lily picked up the clunky old wireless in the kitchen and held it under her arm as she slipped up the back stairs to the bathroom on the second floor of number 72 Charnwood Street. She set it down on the toilet lid and turned up the volume, but the news-caster had already moved on. She turned to open the narrow window above the bathtub and lit a cigarette, settling down on the sill and sticking her head out the window as she took a drag.</p>
<p>“--Flooding on several major roadways is due to the torrential downpours that have followed the nearly three-month long drought…”  Lily took another drag.</p>
<p>It was quiet in the house. It had been quiet ever since Petunia had gotten her new job in the typing pool at that drill-manufacturer in Surrey. She liked to say that she simply had to go that far because there was no work in Birmingham. But she had moved out at almost the same time that Lily had arrived back in their parents’ Cokeworth home in June. Anything to get as far away from Lily as possible.</p>
<p>It was just Lily and her dad now. Lily stubbed out her cigarette. It was just about time to pack up the car, get on the road to London. Lily switched off the radio and padded back to her room. Her trunk sat on the floor, open, strewn with school robes, eyelet blouses, tee-shirts, high-waisted jeans, a lacy bra, and stacks and stacks and stacks of books.</p>
<p>Lily kicked a broken quill aside as she strode over to her roll-top desk. She couldn’t help but glance, for the thousandth time that year, at the framed picture that sat on the corner.</p>
<p>A smiling woman with almond-shaped green eyes and dark red hair tucked into a fashionable silk scarf, looking into the camera lens.</p>
<p>Lily turned back to her trunk, threw her clothes in haphazardly, stacked her books on top of them, and shut the lid.</p>
