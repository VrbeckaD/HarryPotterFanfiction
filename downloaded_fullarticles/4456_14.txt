          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus shoved the cup beneath the brooding man’s nose.</p>
<p>“What is that?” grimaced Snape, eyeing the mass of cream and finely grated chocolate. “Is that-”</p>
<p>“<i>Not</i> hot chocolate,” he finished, moving the cup closer. </p>
<p>“Get that out of my face, Lupin,” ordered Snape, glowering at the dollop of cream that leaked down the edge of the cup. </p>
<p>“It’s got a shot of espresso,” he coaxed, waving the cup in front of the surly man’s face. It was do or die, Remus had decided; after three months of being ignored by his colleague, what had he got to lose?</p>
<p>“Lupin!” spat the Potion master, turning his head away from the steaming brew.</p>
<p>Remus shrugged and placed the cup beside Snape, and left the staff room with his own cup of hot chocolate. </p>
<p>When Severus was sure the wolf had long departed, he picked up the cup and sniffed, a small smile edging across his lips. He took a sip and sighed. Mochas were his favourite.</p></div>
