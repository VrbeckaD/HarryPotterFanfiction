          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was a typical Tuesday night in the Malfoy-Potter household.  Draco cleared after dinner, dragging eight-year-old James and six-year-old Scorpius into service with him while Harry put four year old Arthur and two year old Lily to bed.  Afterwards, they retired to the lounge for a while before bed.  </p><p>The boys played quietly with their Legos for a time, then Draco noted that their calm play had turned into whispered bickering and there were a few tugs back and forth with the Lego people clothing accessories.  The quiet was interrupted when James announced loudly, “Scorpius can be a real diva sometimes.”</p><p>Eyes wide, Scorpius turned to James.  “What?!”</p><p>James smirked.  “Yes, Scorpius. A diva is someone who is picky about their cloooothes, and wants things done a specific waaaaay, and has a fit when that doesn’t happen.”</p><p>Scorpius appeared to think for a moment before he responded.   “Oh. But I’m not a girl, and divas are girls like Lily.”</p><p>Now it was Jame’s turn to ponder.  “Hhmm. Well,” James eventually said with a shrug, “perhaps you’re a metrosephial.”</p><p>Draco, who had been listening from the sidelines while he read his book, glanced at Harry before asking his oldest son, “A what?”</p><p>“Metrosephial. It’s a man who likes to look sharp.”</p><p>Draco’s eyebrows rose and he looked at Harry again, just in time to see him slap his hand over his mouth and shrug before turning back to James.  “Ooooh. I think you mean ‘MetroSEXUAL.’ Where did you hear that word?”</p><p>James grinned.  “Papa. I’m a man of the people.”</p><p>Hearing Harry’s muffled snicker behind him, Draco bit his bottom lip hard before managing to reply.  “That you are, son.  That you are.”</p></div>
