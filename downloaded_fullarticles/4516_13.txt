    <p>"So tell me again why I can't communicate with my brother?" Maisie asked, annoyed.</p><p>The corner of Dumbledore's mouth twitched upwards and an amused twinkle shone in his eyes.</p><p>"You'll see him very soon, Maisie. It's just for his own protection. He's just dealt with a minor mishap at the Ministry of Magic due to a run-in with some dementors."</p><p>The pair sat in Dumbledore's office and the castle was otherwise mostly empty. It was the middle of summer, it was almost two in the morning, and Maisie was exhausted. She also had no idea what the hell "dementors" were.</p><p>"Right," she deadpanned. The tattooed girl sighed and rubbed her eyes. "And when will that be?"</p><p>"As I understand it, you're to stay with Sirius until the summer comes to a close. You'll see hi--"</p><p>Just then, a knock sounded on the door.</p><p>"Come in!" Dumbledore called. "Ah, right on time, Sirius! We were just talking about you," said Dumbledore, looking over Maisie's shoulder. She immediately jumped up and turned around, a wide grin breaking out on her face.</p><p>"Sirius!" she exclaimed, launching herself at him in a firm hug.</p><p>Sirius chuckled and hugged her tightly, kissing the side of her head.</p><p>"Well, if it isn't my favorite goddaughter." The two broke apart as Dumbledore smiled fondly at them.</p><p>"Sirius, as we discussed, Miss Potter will be staying permanently at Hogwarts after this summer, at least until further notice. With the Dark Lord on the loose, we simply cannot risk putting her in harm's way," Dumbledore explained.</p><p>"Yes, of course. I'll make sure she's moved in by the end of the summer."</p><p>The three of them talked over the plans for the next half hour until finally, Dumbledore suggested they get some sleep.</p><p>---------------</p><p>It was ten AM the next morning, and Sirius choked on his coffee in a fit of laughter as Maisie told him the story (well, more like the disaster) of her most recent foster family.</p><p>"So the kid picked up the goldfish and dropped it right in his mom's coffee cup, and she didn't notice it! So we were all sitting at the table having breakfast and then she screamed out of nowhere and threw the mug clear across the room!" she laughed, face red and eyes watering. "It was one of the best things I've seen in my entire life."</p><p>"You always have quite the experiences in these foster families," Sirius pointed out, chuckling. He took a sip of his coffee. "What's it like living in America, anyway? I remember when I first heard Dumbledore shipped you all the way to the States I was shocked."</p><p>"I mean, I don't know. It's definitely a lot sunnier than this place. And it rains a lot less. And the beaches are a lot nicer. I still can't believe my whole family is British, accents and all."</p><p>"You're the one with an accent here," he said cheekily.</p><p>"I am not! You sound so proper all the time! 'Sir Reginald, would you like a spot of tea?'" she mimed in a horribly fake British accent. Sirius laughed out loud, amused.</p><p>"I suppose you have a point. But at least I don't sound like a redneck." It was Maisie's turn to choke on her coffee as she laughed, nearly spitting it everywhere.</p><p>"I hate you," she giggled, picking up a piece of bacon from her plate and throwing it at him.</p><p>Sirius dodged it and smirked, his eyes trailing over her newest tattoo-- a realistic black dog on her right forearm, just below the crook of her elbow. His Animagus.</p><p>Before he could say anything to her, she piped up with an excited "So, when's Harry going to get here?"</p><p>"He'll be here tonight. The rest of the Order are on their way now, as well as the Weasley kids and Hermione," he replied.</p><p>"Wow. I haven't seen any of them since I was probably twelve."</p><p>"Well, they're in for a surprise," he winked. Maisie snorted, rolling her eyes.</p><p>"I'll be upstairs. I need a nap since I've been awake for, oh," she looked at her watch, "36 hours. Goodnight."</p><p>She picked up her suitcase and duffel bag, hauling them up the creaking stairs and praying one of the house elves wouldn't appear out of nowhere and scare the wits out of her. She made her way into one of the bedrooms and put her bags down before putting on her headphones and flopping down on the bed. She pressed the play button and sighed in content as music travelled through the speakers, carrying her off into a dreamless sleep.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Maisie was jolted out of her deep sleep by the sound of laughter and loud voices. It was nearly dark outside the window-- what time was it?! Her music playlist had stopped playing, she noticed. Picking up her phone, she checked the time-- 7 PM. Shit. How the hell had she slept for nine hours?</p><p>Maisie sat up, walking to the doorway and flicking on the lightswitch. She needed to look presentable when she want to see everyone. Quickly, she changed out of her sweatpants and band tee, switching them out for some simple black leggings and an oversized black tee. She ran her fingers through her dark hair, detangling it as much as she could before opening the door and walking down the stairs.</p><p>Immediately she heard familiar voices, and a grin broke out onto her face when she heard Harry's. Maisie nearly sprinted down the stairs, almost tripping on the last few steps before launching herself at Harry's unsuspecting back.</p><p>"Harry!" she yelled excitedly as he jumped in fear.</p><p>"Wha-- Maisie?" He turned and hugged her tightly, closing his eyes as he squeezed his slightly younger sister.</p><p>"I told Sirius not to tell you I was here," she laughed. The rest of the Order looked on with amusement at the siblings being reunited.</p><p>"Yeah, he-- he didn't," Harry replied, biting back an excited laugh. For the rest of the night, the group of friends and family talked and laughed and caught up, bonding after a whole summer of not seeing each other.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Maisie sighed as she lay in the bed, staring up at the ceiling. No matter what she did, she couldn't sleep. It was two AM and they were due to go off to Hogwarts that next morning.</p><p>'Maybe I'm just overly excited,' she thought. It would be her first time setting foot in the castle, or really anywhere in the wizarding world.</p><p>Deciding to distract herself, she reached into her bag and pulled out a small lighter and her mostly untouched box of cigarettes, and walked out of her bedroom. She quietly crept downstairs and to the front door, slipping out onto the porch. She sat down on the steps leading up to 12 Grimmauld Place, pulling out a cigarette and setting it between her lips.</p><p>The girl cupped her hand around the lighter and brought it to her lips, lighting it quickly before setting the box and lighter on the stairs next to her. She wasn't normally one to smoke, but a lot had gone on these past few days.</p><p>Maisie took a drag and held it, letting the smoke burn her lungs before blowing it out into the night sky, watching it swirl and disappear. The only sources of light were the moon and the smoldering end of the cigarette. She held it between two fingers and sighed, propping her head on her hand and resting her elbow on her knee.</p><p>Suddenly, someone sat down next to her. Maisie jumped, looking over at the dark figure.</p><p>"I thought you were done with those things," Harry said, staring at the burning cylinder between his sister's fingers.</p><p>"Jesus Christ, Harry, you scared the shit out of me!" she whisper-yelled, punching him in the upper arm.</p><p>"Sorry, sorry. I heard someone on the stairs and just got a bit nervous. Had to check."</p><p>Maisie nodded, taking another drag from the cigarette and holding it for a second, then blowing the smoke out again.</p><p>"I just couldn't sleep. I've been thinking too much." She put the cigarette between her lips and held it there. "What's Hogwarts like?" she inquired, turning to look straight at Harry. His hair was disheveled, his glasses slightly crooked from jamming them on his face in the dark.</p><p>"Honestly, Maisie, it's brilliant. Amazing. You're going to love it," he said excitedly. She smiled around the cigarette, blowing out some more smoke behind her before throwing the dying stick into the neighbor's bushes. Harry scoffed at her and she smirked.</p><p>She leaned over to rest her head on her brother's shoulder, looking down the empty, dark road in front of the house. Harry put an arm around her and she sighed shakily.</p><p>"I missed you so much," she said softly. "Ever since I heard what happened last year-- with that tournament and everything-- I've been worried sick about you."</p><p>Harry sighed. "I'm alright, Maisie. You don't need to worry about me. I'm still here, aren't I?"</p><p>"Yeah, I guess. But still. I'd keep having nightmares about that stupid fucking Voldemort guy and wake up screaming. My foster parents thought I had schizophrenia."</p><p>"I worry about you every day, Maisie. If something were to happen to you..." he was silent for a moment. "The most important thing is that Hogwarts is probably the safest place for us to be with him on the loose. Dumbledore thinks he's trying to use you to get to me, so he had to act fast."</p><p>"I'm just... I'm worried," she sighed.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>Maisie sat up and looked at him. "I can't do magic like you all can, Harry. I-- I'm a Squib, I--"</p><p>"Maisie. That doesn't matter," he said, squeezing her shoulder. "That doesn't make you any less than any of us."</p><p>She frowned. "I guess. I just hope nothing's going to happen."</p><p>"Hey. Look at me," he said softly, tilting her chin up to look at him. Brown eyes met green and Harry smiled. "The only bad thing that could possibly happen is you getting some disease from those cigarettes."</p><p>Maisie rolled her eyes and smiled. "Alright, alright. I'll stop. Promise."</p><p>"Good. Give me the box."</p><p>"What? N-"</p><p>"Maisie," he said threateningly.</p><p>"Ugh! Fine. But I'm keeping the lighter. I'll need fire to survive if the zombie apocalypse happens."</p><p>"Fair enough," he laughed.</p><p>Maisie reluctantly handed him the box of cigarettes and followed Harry inside the house. She thumped him hard on the back of the head when he threw the entire box of cigarettes into the enchanted fire, laughing at his surprised "ow!" and darting up the stairs before he decided to chase her.</p>
