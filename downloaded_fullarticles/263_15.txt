    <p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat in their compartment on the train on their way to Hogwarts like they did every year. Only this time, they had another guest with them. Next to Harry sat a raggedy young man wrapped up in a dirty black trench coat. Harry didn't mind him, since the man was sleeping any way. He wasn't any bother to them.</p><p>"I can't believe you blew up your aunt!" Ron exclaimed, slouching into the seat. Hermione rolled her eyes and pet her cat gently.</p><p>"Ronald, honestly. That's a bit of old news, isn't? I'm sure Harry's tired of it, too."</p><p>"It's fine, 'Mione. And I didn't do it on purpose, Ron." Harry looked over at the man again before leaning on the palms of his hands. Suddenly, the train lurched forward and stopped, the brakes squeaking loudly. Harry got up and opening the door of the compartment, looking out and shrugging at other students. His eyes caught the sight of white blonde hair. Malfoy? He was usually in another section of the train, but he was only a few compartments down from him. Harry sighed and closed the door, sitting back down. Ron leaned against the window, looking out nervously.</p><p>"Ron? What is it?" Harry asked, looking at his friend. Ron backed away from the window toward Hermione. Crookshanks hissed loudly at the door.</p><p>"I don't know, but something's out there, mate." Ice started to spread on the window, freezing over the bottle of water on the window sill. Harry shuddered. His breath made wisps of clouds in the air. It can't be that cold. The door next to him slowly opened, and a dark hooded figure swiftly slid in. It looked over at Hermione and Ron, who cowered in the corner. Crookskanks hissed again, more quietly. The figure then turned to Harry, and he felt a chill go down his spine. He felt terrified beyond compare. Both of this friends looked over at him with worry. The figure took a deep breath, sucking bits of Harry's soul into itself. Harry's body went cold and limp.</p><p>A bright light came from behind him, casting the figure away, and before Harry passed out, he heard a familiar voice calling his name. A blond haired man appeared before him, shrouded in bright light. Draco? Harry thought before he fell into darkness.</p><p>~*~*~</p><p>"Harry? Harry, answer me, please." Hermione's voice called out. Harry blinked himself awake. He saw Hermione's figure in front of him. As he sat up, she handed him his glasses.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"Harry, here. You should eat this." The raggedy man from earlier handed him a piece of chocolate. "Chocolate helps," the man reassured him. Harry nodded and took a bite of it. He glanced over at the door.</p><p>"What was that?" Harry whispered.</p><p>"A dementor, a guard of Azkaban, looking for Sirius Black. Though, it didn't have any right to harm you." The man got up, leaving the chocolate bar next to Harry. "If you would all excuse me, I need to have a word with the driver. And eat, Harry. Trust me, you'll feel better." And with that, the man left, leaving the trio still a little shaken. Harry finished off his piece of chocolate and broke off another piece. All the while, he still stared at the door.</p><p>"Harry?" Hermione looked over at him. He nodded and glanced at Hermione.</p><p>"Sorry, Hermione. Just a little shaken. Did either of you see-"</p><p>"Malfoy? Yeah, we did!" Ron shouted, leaning back in his seat and huffing. "He stayed here for a few minutes, just staring at you with the stupidest expression I've ever seen on the bloke."</p><p>"Ron! He was concerned about Harry. If you ever paid attention in class, you'd know why, too." Hermione huffed at Ron, and she started to pet Crookskanks more intensely.</p><p>"He was covered in white light, 'Mione." Harry gazed at the door again, sighing. He had never seen something more beautiful.</p><p>"Hermione, even if he was concerned, that doesn't excuse what he's done the past two years," Ron said, his temper calming down.</p><p>"Those were childish games, Ronald. We were eleven and twelve. And none of them were extreme, anyway." Hermione looked over at Harry, who looked lost in thought. "I think it's time we stop this children's feud."</p><p>As the trio got off the train, they were bombarded by none other than Draco Malfoy, who came not to taunt them but to look at Harry once again. Hermione let him pass, but Ron wasn't so sure about him still. Who could blame him, seeing as the brat had called his friend a mudblood last year.</p><p>"Malfoy, what do you want?" Ron asked, but was only ignored. Draco maneuvered around him and looked Harry over once. He could feel his heart race a bit looking at the green eyed boy. Harry looked at him with surprise. Malfoy was starring at him intensely, looking him over like a worried mother. It reminded Harry of Ron's mother.</p><p>"Harry, are you alright?" Draco asked, not daring to touch Harry. Harry nodded and looked down at the ground. He hoped his hair hid the blush that was growing on his cheeks. He couldn't believe himself, getting flustered over Draco Malfoy. He hadn't liked him the past two years, but now his mind betrayed him and all Harry could think about was how beautiful Draco had looked earlier. Stop it, Harry. Don't space out, he thought.</p><p>"I'm glad you're alright. I was worried."</p><p>"Draco! Are you done fussing?" Pansy called. She gave a quick smile toward Draco and Harry, as well as Hermione and Ron before leaving with Blaise and Millicent, Crabbe and Goyle not far behind. Draco waved goodbye the the trio before running to catch up with Pansy and the others. Harry was still starring at the ground like an idiot.</p><p>"Did he just check up on Harry?" Ron asked, looking bewildered. Hermione stood there looking like she couldn't believe that Pansy Parkinson had actually smiled at them.</p><p>It seemed like the beginning of a long year.</p>
