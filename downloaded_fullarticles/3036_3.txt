    <p>Germany 1930</p>
<p>She was laughing. He wasn’t even sure if what he said was funny or even that intelligent. The alcohol had clogged his brain, and everything was blurred at the edges. She was just so soft, so pretty, with her blonde curls and confident American twang.</p>
<p>“Oh honey, you’re so funny!” she twittered reaching across the bar to take her hand in his. Her perfectly manicured nails dug into his palm, hard. She lent over, letting her lips brush against his ear.</p>
<p>“Do you want to get out of here? She murmurs slow, seductively.</p>
<p>“With me?” he slurs.</p>
<p>“Why of course,” she bats her eyelashes innocently at him.</p>
<p>“Not too many foreign witches are up for a night with a German wizard,” this is unfortunately true he thinks, shooting the rest of his drink. After the great war, Germany is generally considered the outcast of Europe.</p>
<p>“Well,” she says pausing for effect, “not many witches are like me,” she gives him a girlish wink. He almost falls off his stool in his haste to get the bill.</p>
<p>Her hand falls seamlessly through his, her touch exciting and electric. He wasn’t good enough for her, too old, too balding, way past his prime. She’s bright, bubbly, and beautiful. She extends a delicate tongue into the cold night air, catching snowflakes, eyes dancing with delight. He floats in and out of her mindless chattering, she’s an hypnotising bird and he’s agreeing readily and without a care in the world.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have such a nice time” - “Yes” Yes.</p>
<p>“This is a fancy house” – “Yes” It’s not actually mine.</p>
<p>“You’re a curse breaker, you said?” – “Yes” Did he say that?</p>
<p>“I’ve got a friend coming along, if you don’t mind” – “Yes” As long as she looks like you.</p>
<p>They’re inside now, stumbling through hall ways. She raises her wand elegantly, and charms off her shoes. Then her stockings. Yes. She points her want at him.</p>
<p>“Your turn honey,” and everything goes black.</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>His headache hits him like a train, almost knocking him flat. Or at least it would’ve done, if he wasn’t currently tied to a chair. He grinds his teeth anxiously. A pair of wary, heated eyes study him from a dark corner. They widen, noticing his eye contact.</p>
<p>“Queenie? He’s awake,” his voice is American too, but shaking. Like a leaf in the wind.</p>
<p>“I told you to do it before he woke Credence,” his blonde gives a mothering sigh, “it’ll be harder otherwise,”</p>
<p>“I… don’t want,” the young man shakes his head erratically, fighting a losing battle within himself. Clicking her tongue impatiently,she strides towards the boy- Credence- running a loving hand through his hair.</p>
<p>“For the Greater Good, Credence,” she says softly.</p>
<p>He’s struck cold with fear. No. He was so careful. It’s not possible. It can’t be.</p>
<p>“Nein!” he screams wildly, praying for anyone, anything to come and save him.</p>
<p>“For the Greater Good,” the boy says slowly raising his wand. There’s a flash of green light. Then nothing.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>London 1930.</p>
<p>“And bow…” Newt says, a tentative hand placed on the small of Tina’s back.</p>
<p>“Yes I do know what to do, Newt” Tina whispers amused, but not looking away from the pair of majestic almond eyes, “I’ve been here since she was born,”</p>
<p>“Just in case you forgot,” he shoots back cheekily, “or fell asleep,” Tina aims a kick at Newt’s shin, which probably would’ve hit its mark if she hadn’t currently been in a deep bend. Last week he’d found her exhausted, curled up with the baby demiguises, even at her previous insistence that she ‘really wasn’t tired’. He’s never going to let her live it down.</p>
<p>“I hate you,” she says huffily, after Carol also bent a scaly knee forward.</p>
<p>“Of course you do,” he says disbelieving giving her a quick hug round her waist. She puffs out her cheeks in mock anger, but gives him a small grin. They both enjoy their banter, but her soft smiles make him ache a bit. But they’re taking it slow. ‘As slow as a pair of bloody snails’ as Theseus would say when he’s in a good mood. He’s hardly ever in a good mood. He’s still wearing the traditional mourner’s black, despite the rest of them changing back to colours a few months ago.</p>
<p>Shaking those miserable thoughts away, he holds up a selection of ferrets for Carol to approve as Tina gives the spoilt hippogriff a rub down. It’s Bunty’s day off, and their annual group dinner night, so Tina and Newt are busy finishing off the rounds before Jacob arrives. He likes it- just him and her. An comfortable silence and his beasts. Over the last two years he’s cherished these moments, tucked them away, kept them save. Tina, surrounded by a halo of snidgets, all competing for her attention. Tina’s wet eyes when the diricawl’s last chick refused to hatch. Tina watching him entranced as he helped the Erumptent give birth to baby Susie. She finds everything he does fascinating and he loves her for it.</p>
<p>Carol’s eyes, blink at him, way too often and way too fast for his liking. He stares closer, only mildly registering Jacob’s clattering down the stairs and Tina’s greeting. There’s flecks of dry matter in the corner of each pupil and around each of the beast’s eyelids.</p>
<p>“It’s all right,” he croons, “Mum’s on it,”</p>
<p>“Tina?” Newt calls out, “can I have the eye-“</p>
<p>“Eyedropper,” she confirms, pressing the object into his hand.</p>
<p>“How do you always know?” he hums.</p>
<p>“Magic,” she replies a sweet smile playing around her lips, sliding her fingers out of his.</p>
<p>Merlin, she’s amazing.</p>
<p>“Oi! Love birds!” Jacob cuts in smirking. Tina jumps back from him, biting her lip, face falling into her stereotypical frown. Newt shoots him a look of pure evil, but Jacob just grins. Why is he his best friend again? “sorry to interrupt,” Jacob continues, “but Tina, Theseus is up stairs asking for you, apparently it’s important,”</p>
<p>“Right,” Tina says worried, “I’m on it,” she takes the stairs two at a time. Newt’s found his brother prefers Tina’s company to Jacob’s or even his own. Jacob is too likely to make an ill timed joke, Newt’s too likely to smile inappropriately. Tina’s serious, but caring nature seems to work for him. ‘A bit brash at times, but a nice girl Newt, and a damn good auror,’.</p>
<p>“When did he get here? He asks Jacob absently, finishing tending to the hippogriff’s eyes.</p>
<p>“About the same time I did,” Jacob said, watching Newt shut the gate of Carols pen, and wiping the dirt off his pant legs, “he was pacing on your doorstep. I reckon something happened at work,”</p>
<p>“Lately, somethings always happening at work,” Newt mutters darkly. Already aurors have begun to go missing, all in ‘mysterious’ circumstances. He’s made Tina promise to not take any ‘unnecessary risks’, when it comes to her work. But she only promised half-heartedly, and Newt already knows if something tugs on her heart hard enough she will fight, tooth and nail. It’s one of the things that attracts him to her.</p>
<p>“Have you kissed her yet?” Jacob asks, as they climb the steps in time. </p>
<p>“No,” Newt says simply, wondering whether Queenie ever taught Jacob her gift of legilimency.</p>
<p>“Pal, not to be blunt, but why the hell not?” Jacob sounds unbelieving. Newt’s not sure he blames him.</p>
<p>“There just hasn’t been the right moment yet,” this is not entirely true. There have been many moments. Stolen glances, close foreheads. For Merlin’s sake, in Paris he could’ve kissed her. However, to finally kiss, to take that next step… It’s like they’re both balancing on a tightrope between friendship and something evidently more dear. They want to jump, to catch each other in an embrace. But what if someone slips? What if someone falls? </p>
<p>“We’re taking it slow,” Newt says resolutely.</p>
<p>“Whatever you say mate” Jacob sounds fed up, pushing open the door to Newt’s apartment. Tina and Theseus sit together in an intense conversation, empty tea cups sit forlorn in front of them. A kettle wails impatiently on the stove, and Newt levitates it onto the counter top before it sprays them all with boiling liquid.</p>
<p>“Are you certain?” Tina says, enraptured, her grown out fringe falling excitedly over her eye line.</p>
<p>“Yes. We’ve got to go now. All of us,” Theseus says heatedly, his fingers tapping rhythmically on the table top.</p>
<p>“Go where?” Newt says suspiciously.</p>
<p>Theseus looks up, his eyes wild and bright. He’s practically smacking his lips in anticipation.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore’s finally found someone to break the blood pact,” Theseus announces to Jacobs’ curiosity and Newt’s horror, “he wants us to track them down,”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore,” Newt falls into the chair next to Tina with a thud. Even his name gives him a headache. He’d thought perhaps, that his old professor would forget about their little group. Leave them in peace, give the task to some people more experienced. More willing. But Tina’s eyes are also bright, and excited. A new case they seem to say, a new puzzle to solve. He wishes he had their positivity. This will not end well.</p>
<p>“When?” Newt sighs defeated.</p>
<p>“Hogshead. Five minutes, be there,“ Theseus stands briskly, shooting a glare at Newt “Jacob, Tina…little brother,” and he disapperates.</p>
