  <span>Summer had come to Hogwarts, signaling the end of the school term. Students had retreated outside to bask in the sun and to enjoy time with there friends before departing for the summer. Most of the students gathered on the grassy lawn closest to the castle,  mobbed together in noisy circles while some of the older, braver students poked at the giant squid warming itself in the shallows. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the furthest edge along the shore, almost to the edge of the forest, Hermione saw a familiar blond head,  bent down picking up stones, piling them into his hands, and tossing each one, watching them skip along the surface. For the first time in years, he looked relaxed, the tension in his stance eased. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stepped on a twig that snapped underfoot and his gaze snapped to her. A smirk grew across his features as he turned back to the water. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you upset with me?” She tucked her hair behind her ear as a nervous habit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. I always knew you’d see the world. I knew you’d get the internship as soon as you applied.  You didn’t have to put it in a letter though.” He rolled his eyes and chucked the rest of the pebbles into the water. Making his way towards her he continued “Could have told me you were leaving for 2 years in person. “</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s the thing; I couldn’t. “ she scuffed the toe of her shoe into the dirt. “ I don’t know what that means ...for us.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He held out his hand for her and she took it. Leading them to sloping birch tree he sat leaning against the trunk and pulled her into his lap. Pressing a kiss to her temple she sighed and let herself melt into him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t have to mean anything. I’m going to stay here, start and St. Mungos much to the dismay of the entire wizarding community, and you are going to do your internship and outshine any Curse Breaker to ever take up the title, and you’ll come back because scarhead and weasel can’t function without you. “</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what about you? “ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I’m sorry I thought it was implied that you’d sort out the wonder idiots once I’ve thoroughly had my way with you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She chuckled quietly. “I mean...That’s a very long time to, maintain a long-distance relationship. And we’re both so young…” her throat clicked as her it felt as though her heart was stuck there.  Turning her head more into his chest and inhaling his natural scent, she couldn’t even bring herself to open her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He pulled her in tighter. “There is no one else Hermione. There never has been. 2 years or 20 years it’s always been you. “ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>2 years later. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Leaky Cauldron was packed with people for Hermione’s welcome home party and Draco hated every second of it.  But Potter had planned this before his proposal to Floo directly into his flat so he could ravage her on the sitting room floor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then her last few letters had been hardly more than a few lines. The nagging feeling she’d been keeping </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span> or </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone</span>
  </em>
  <span> from him had been pressing in more and more.  He took a long pull from his butterbeer and felt an elbow nudge his. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, Malfoy? You look as though someone might turn you back into a ferret.” Potter smirked and took a pull from his drink too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine.  Just wished she’d get here already I’m sick of looking at you lot already. “</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What if she turns up with a bloke she met while she was gone?” He knew Potter meant it as a joke but it touched on a nerve but Draco kept his face a mask. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll kill ‘em.” He mumbled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t say shit like that I’m an Auror.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine. I definitely would not kill him and I would not make it look like an accident. “</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter sighed “Or, you could sing that song you made up ...that one night we introduced you to Tequilla. “ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco narrowed grey eyes at him. “ I only have vague memories of that night - “</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Cause all I want to be with, Is a girl called Hermione. “ </span>
  </em>
  <span> Potter sang under his breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now I remember everything in vivid detail. No need to continue. “ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Kicking back is where you’ll find her and me. </span>
  </em>
  <span> It really was catchy Malfoy I didn’t know you were so good at rhyming .” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did write “Weasley is our king” you know. People we’re singing that for years. “ Draco turned back to the bar to order something significantly stronger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The room erupted into cheers as the door to the pub opened. There was Hermione, her hair a glorious windswept mess, skin tanned with freckles dotting all across her nose. She gave a perfunctory smile and wave to the applause but kept scanning for someone, untill she saw him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The smile vanished as she stepped into the pub. The people parted as she worked towards him, not dropping the eye contact. He pushed off the bar with his elbows and met her halfway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In every country, on every continent, someone told me that there was no way we would make this work. They said we were too different or it hadn’t been enough time. That I wouldn’t feel the same when I came back. “ she bit her lip for the briefest of moments, eyes still locked on his, a fire raging behind them.  “ I started to question it myself, until right now. I belong with you Draco.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There were no words for the moment. He closed the short distance between them and Hermione put a hand on either side of his face and kissed him. Fiercely, passionately, as if she’d been saving a kiss for every day for this moment.  He wrapped his arm around her waist and kissed her back with equal emotion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The crowd whooped and catcalled. Potter started singing the wretched song and a few other people joined in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s that they’re singing?” she asked her face starting to flush from the attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s really best not to ask right now. I missed you, so much.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I missed you too, what’s that got to do with the whomping willo- oh” He had dipped her back into another kissing to make the people start cheering again. But they just started singing even louder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco didn’t really care. He had everything now. </span>
