<p> </p>
<p>The 2nd of May 1998 will be a day none in the wizarding will soon forget. It is a day to celebrate the downfall of one of the darkest wizards known, but it is also a day filled with sorrow. So many died during the war and the final battle was no different. There were so many funerals to attend in the weeks following the end of the war. So many broken families to try and console.  There was only one happy thought that most could hold on to. <em> Finally the war was over. </em> Yes the ministry still had some rogue Death Eaters to round up, but most of the high ranking ones were either killed or captured in the Final Battle at Hogwarts.  The few sects that were still in operation were being weeded out by the aurors based on information gleaned from the remaining captured Death Eaters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last day of May is finally here.  The day of Lupin and Tonks funeral. Following her fingers in the mirror as she buttons up her black dress shirt, Hermione’s eyes continue their upward path until she looks into them.  Falling into the black of her pupils she lets her mind wander while her fingers try to smooth down non-existent wrinkles. Thinking back to the last few weeks she has no idea how she is still standing, how any of them are.  How broken George and all the other Weasley’s were at Fred’s funeral, the sobs of Colin Creevy’s mother as they laid him in the ground, Hermione didn’t know if she could take it again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pulling herself out of the depths of her tumbling thoughts again, she impatiently bats at the few tears that managed to leak out while she wasn’t paying attention and realized Ginny was standing in the doorway to their shared bedroom at the Burrow with that look. The look that says Hermione was staring at her reflection for a little longer than normal, the look that says Ginny had been calling her name for a long time now, the look full of pity that Hermione is so sick of seeing.  Tugging at the sleeves of her shirt to make sure they covered her arms, she quickly turns to follow Ginny out of the room and down the stairs so they can leave with everyone else.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lifting her eyes from the toes of her modest heels as she makes it past the last step, Hermione sees Ginny lean in and whisper something to Harry. His eyes lift to search hers for a moment before they quickly dart away, not quick enough for Hermione to miss the pity there though.  She doesn’t even have the energy anymore to try and lift the corner of her mouth. The slight attempt at a smile that would look more like a grimace anyway is too much effort for Hermione to give if she wants to make it through today. This one is going to be the hardest to get through, watching little Teddy who doesn’t even know what is going on would break her heart even more if she weren’t already broken.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While looking around the Weasley’s kitchen without actually seeing anything in front of her eyes Hermione tries to remember exactly when the numbness started. The numbness and anger is almost all she can remember now, and the pain, but now was not the time for that. She has to get through today and then she would take as much pain as she could deal herself to try and not feel so numb today. Numbness was better than anger, she hurt herself with the numbness but she almost hurt other people with the anger. No, she must keep the anger locked inside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shaking herself from her own thoughts again Hermione comes back to the present and immediately notices the heat of Ron’s hand almost touching the small of her back ushering her through the kitchen door and towards the road. A deep breath of fresh air does nothing to quell the anxiety and bubble of anger she is feeling at having someone nearly touch her. Taking a half step to the left she hears Ron quietly sigh as his hand slips down to his side. It doesn’t take long to reach the top of the hill just down the road from the Burrow, all the Weasleys huddle next to Arthur who produces a portkey from his pocket.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Almost time now everyone. Hopefully this will be the last time we have to worry about a gathering like this for a long while.” With that said, everyone starts to lay a finger on the inconspicuous teacup sitting in Arthur’s palm.  With a quick nudge from Ron, Hermione sets her fingertip to the handle of the cup just as it starts to glow. A moment later, with the familiar tug behind their navel’s, the whole group zooms off to be transported right outside the gates of the cemetery in Godric’s Hollow. Harry insisted Lupin be laid to rest near his father. They also erected a tombstone for Sirius nearby, so even in death the three friends can be as close as their remaining loved ones could possibly make them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being fairly used to portkey travel now, it doesn’t take long for the group to recover. Having leaned slightly in to Ron to get her balance back, Hermione straightens up and slowly moves away from the group while smoothing down her black skirt as if it were wrinkled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Giving Ginny’s hand a squeeze, Harry drops it and sidles up to Hermione who is now compulsively tugging at her shirtsleeves with the blank stare she’s had since the end of the final battle.  Harry clears his throat as he approached her, no one reaches out to touch her before announcing their presence anymore after she almost hexed Bill for bumping in to her chair during one of her stupors. Next thing everyone knew Hermione had her vinewood wand to Bill’s throat with a murderous look in here eye.  Once she realized who was at the end of her wand, the apologies started pouring out of her mouth along with sobs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pulling himself out of the memories, Harry notices Hermione looking at him.  He runs his hand affectionately down her arm but instead of leaning into him like she used to, she pulls her arm away and crosses them both across her chest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know it’s been said before, but with this being the last funeral, hopefully we can start looking towards the future now. I’m sure we can start making some happy memories to combat all the bad ones we’ve been dealing with lately. Hermione, I know things look bleak right now but they will get better.” Harry whispers to her, knowing she is paying attention because he sees her hands tighten on her arms as soon as her name comes out of his mouth.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Turning her head to look at him with her dead eyes, Hermione really looks at Harry for the first time in at least a week.  His green eyes are shimmering with tears but there is hope shining behind the sadness, a hope she can’t seem to feel no matter how many people tell her it’s there.  A hope she is starting to resent because how can there be hope when everything looks so bleak. Hermione always had a purpose, whether it was studying, keeping her boys out of trouble, or saving the wizarding world.  Now that most of that is over, she has no idea what her purpose is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a heavy sigh she walks away from Harry, towards the back row of seating for the small funeral without saying anything. She hasn’t actually spoken a word to anyone for two weeks. Not since they all finished their interviews with the Ministry about their parts in the war. Not since Kingsley Shacklebolt, acting Minister for Magic, told her there was no way to reverse the memory spell on her parents. Not since that night when she sobbed into Harry and Ron’s arms begging to have died in the final battle. That was the first look her best friends had at how deep she was sinking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry feels Ginny take his hand again as she walks up to him. “It will be ok Harry, she will come out of this eventually,” she tries to assure him. “It would take me more than a few weeks to get over losing my parents on top of everything else we have had to deal with.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a shoulder bump and a quick peck on his cheek Ginny starts leading them to where her parents and the rest of the family are seated. Harry can’t help but dig his feet in and turn them around to sit with Hermione this time. She sat all alone at the last two funerals and he won’t let one of his best friends sit alone again. Especially when she looked so lost and defeated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the funeral all the Weasleys were talking to Andromeda, Ginny making funny faces at a giggling Teddy who was being held by Molly. Hermione, a few feet away from the group, was looking anywhere but close to them.  Glancing towards Hermione Harry tries to call her over. While working to get her attention he notices a familiar flash of white blond hair and quickly excuses himself from the group as he moves to follow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It didn’t take Harry long to catch up with him. “Malfoy, wait,” Harry says while snagging the shoulder of his former enemy. Pulling Draco to a stop he adds, “I didn’t know you were going to be here, you could have sat with us.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Holding back a sneer Draco replies, “Ginny may have tolerated me for a few dinners but I’m sure the rest of the Weasley clan isn’t quite ready to buddy up to a former death eater.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Leaning against the tree they were standing next to, Harry puts his hands in the pockets of his dress pants, “I thought you didn’t give a shit what people thought of the old you? Or did the whole ‘changing the Malfoy name and reputation’ spiel not actually mean a damn thing? Because I have heard you prattle on about that a bit too much if it doesn’t. And how will you change anyone’s opinion if you hide yourself away?” Harry didn’t mean to but his voice had risen a bit during his rant. Some of the last to leave looked their way curiously, a few whispering to each other.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Calming himself down, Harry clapped Draco on the shoulder, “you won’t change anything if you don’t give people the chance to form a new opinion. Owl me tomorrow and Ginny and I will meet you for dinner like usual. Just think about what I’ve said.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And with that said, Harry jogged off towards Ginny who was patiently waiting while distracting her mother from wondering where Harry had gone off to. Draco watched Harry move towards his friends, family really since the Weasley’s treated Harry like he was one of their own. Draco couldn’t help but feel a bit of envy at what he didn’t have. Trying to tamper down some of the wistfulness he was feeling, Draco eyed Granger. Even from a distance he could tell she wasn’t herself. Harry had mentioned a few times during their dinners that he was worried about her. This thought sent Draco tumbling down memory lane.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Harry caught Draco at Fred’s funeral he invited the latter out to dinner at a muggle restaurant. They were able to talk and also stay hidden from the media, Rita Skeeter was a vulture after the war and everyone was sick of her attempts to get interviews with them all. Harry half expected Draco to wave away the invitation but surprisingly he accepted. Over the the last few weeks there were a few dinners, some owls back and forth, and some flying on the Malfoy grounds. A tentative friendship grew between the two who had once been on opposite sides of the war. Ginny had even accompanied Harry a few times and although Draco wouldn’t openly admit it yet he enjoyed the time he spent with them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pulling himself from his thoughts, with one last glance at a despondent Granger, Draco continued his journey home. Back to the confines of the Manor, his father in Azkaban waiting the kiss as punishment for his role in the war, his mother killed herself after the Wizengamot’s ruling, Draco had no one but the house elves to keep him company anymore. No wonder he was looking for friendship anywhere he could find it.</p>
