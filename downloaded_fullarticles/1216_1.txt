    <p>Hermione clutched the back of Kingsley's robes tightly, her eyes shut tightly.</p>
<p><em>We're almost there. We're almost there. We're almost there.</em> She kept chanting in her mind, each line coinciding with a beat of the thestral's wings. Harry's body felt weird. She wasn't used to wearing glasses unless she was on the beach, and Harry was quite a bit larger than her. Her, or, she thought determinedly, <em>his</em>, arms were much more muscled, a fact she was grateful for as it made hanging on to Kingsley for the long flight quite a bit easier. And his feet! She kept accidentally kicking Kingsley's heels with Harry's massive shoes. Not to mention she had never felt comfortable on a thestral, and the cold didn't help, either. Hermione had been constantly shivering since they’d taken off.</p>
<p>
  <em>We're almost there. We're almost there. We're almost there.</em>
</p>
<p>A few interminable minutes later, Hermione felt the thestral start to descend. She nearly wept in relief as the Burrow came into sight. As soon as the thestral came to a graceful landing, she slid off of the thestral. She stumbled slightly and internally cursed her, or rather Harry’s, trembling legs. The ground had never felt so wonderful before. Hermione wasn’t able to ponder this for more than a second, for Molly immediately rushed out of the Burrow.</p>
<p>'Thank goodness you're all right, Kingsley! I've been worried <em>sick</em>! Have you seen any of the others? Where's Mad-Eye? He was supposed to be the first back so he could patrol the grounds! And you, er, which one are you?' Molly said in one breath, looking quizzically at Hermione/Harry.</p>
<p>'I'm Hermione,' the teenage witch supplied, Harry's voice cracking in relief and exhaustion.</p>
<p>Molly hugged her. 'Well, thank goodness you're here. Come inside. You can wait in Ginny's room until the potion wears off. I've got some soup you can take up as you go; you must be freezing!'</p>
<p>'Thanks,' Hermione said, stumbling into the Burrow. Walking was more challenging than ever due to using unfamiliar legs after having gone on a ride across what felt like the length of Britain. She made it inside without falling, though she did stumble several times. She eyed the stairs with some trepidation. Trying to climb up several flights of stairs was looking like an impossible task right now.</p>
<p>However, Hermione managed to ascend the stairs, her oddly large hand holding tight to the bannister. She collapsed onto her cot in Ginny's room, overcome with hunger. She reached into a pocket of her robes and took out her watch. It was far too small for her current arm, but she hadn't been able to part with it for even a few hours. Her parents had instilled the importance of always knowing what time it was in her, though if Hermione was honest, she wasn't the most punctual person outside of attending classes. Glancing at it, Hermione surmised that she still had twenty-one minutes before the Polyjuice wore off.</p>
<p>The carrot-and-ginger soup, a specialty of Molly’s, scalded her throat, but Hermione didn’t care as she gulped down one spoonful after another. Gradually feeling returned to her toes and her anxiety was replaced by a feeling of fullness. Hermione yawned. She could stay up and greet the others as they came in, but it wouldn't be so bad if she took a short nap. Surely the sensation of the Polyjuice wearing off would wake her, and then she could go down and help out. Stretching out onto her cot in the corner of Ginny’s room, Hermione let herself relax and within seconds was in a deep slumber.</p>
<p>Several hours later, Hermione gradually woke up, feeling better than she had any right to. She opened her eyes, groaned, and immediately closed them. It was daytime! Why hadn't she woken up when she transformed back, unless... Suddenly panicked, Hermione shot upright and forced her eyes open. Gazing down on herself, she hissed in relief when she saw her own body, still wrapped in the overlarge robes she had worn the previous night. She felt a bit weird, though. Like she wasn't quite herself. But that was probably the after-effects of the Polyjuice. Harry and Ron had said that they felt a bit weird for hours after having spent time as Crabbe and Goyle.</p>
<p>'Hey,' came a soft voice on the other side of the room. Hermione looked over to see Ginny grinning sleepily at her.</p>
<p>Hermione tried to smile back. 'Did everyone make it? Where's Ron? Where's Harry? What happened?' she said in a rush.</p>
<p>Ginny's smile vanished. 'Harry made it. Everyone made it back except Mad-Eye and Dung. Mad-Eye's dead, Hermione. Dung panicked and tried to run and Mad-Eye took a killing curse to the face while he was wrestling with Dung. We don't know what happened to Dung; Lupin saw him Disapparate. And George lost an ear, but Mum said he'll be all right.'</p>
<p>Hermione sank back into her bed, a mixture of relief and sadness filling her. She was no fan of Mad-Eye Moody, but his attention to detail and emphasis on security was the only reason their rescue had worked. And Dung could go to hell for all she cared. George losing an ear, though... Hermione reached up and touched her own, then shuddered.</p>
<p>'Where's Ron?' Hermione asked casually.</p>
<p>Ginny shrugged. 'Probably still asleep. He didn't get to bed until after three. He was helping out with George. How are you feeling?'</p>
<p>Hermione thought about it. 'Not bad. A little weird, but I think that's the Polyjuice residue. I'll look it up in a few minutes. Right now, I'm going to get out of these blasted robes.'</p>
<p>She got up slowly, still feeling odd, and rummaged around in her trunk for some clothes that actually fit her own body rather than Harry’s. Finally finding some clean robes and her underthings, she turned her back to Ginny and shed the dirty robe. Six years in a dormitory hadn't been able to rid her entirely of her innate modesty, especially since she was a rather late bloomer compared to Lavender and Parvati. They had developed breasts towards the end of second year, while Hermione hadn't started until the middle of her third year. She occasionally had thoughts of inadequacy when her roommates walked around their dorm topless, their large breasts seemingly taunting her own modestly sized ones.</p>
<p>Hermione banished these thoughts out of her head and quickly shed the overlarge tee shirt she had worn the previous night; an old one of Charlie’s. She quickly donned her bra and picked up her knickers.</p>
<p>She shoved down the baggy shorts she had worn last night and immediately shrieked.</p>
<p>'What?' Ginny said, immediately standing up, her wand drawn. Hermione quickly pulled the shorts back up. 'No, stay away!' she squeaked.</p>
<p>Hermione heard the other girl stop her advance. 'Are you okay? Were you cursed and didn't know it? I'll get Mum.'</p>
<p>'I'm fine!' Hermione shrieked, her hands inside her shorts, feeling the new body part she had mysteriously gained. 'Don't get her!'</p>
<p>'Okay...' Ginny said slowly, and Hermione didn't have to look to know she was very confused. 'What's going on? Can I see?'</p>
<p>Hermione just stood there, peeking down her stomach, her fingers holding the waistband of her shorts away to give her a good look at her brand-new <em>cock.</em></p>
