</p><p>A swirling breeze swept her cream coloured robes around her, and she shuddered a bit as the chill from the ocean made the hairs on her arms raised. She pulled the hood down from her head, letting the salty air blow her curls from her shoulders to tangle themselves. At one point in her life, she would have found the sensation invigorating - making her feel alive like nothing but the wind and the sound of the ocean could do. Now, she felt empty. </p><p>Waves crashed around the rocky cove below the fifty-metre cliff she stood on. She set her eyes upon the horizon, the fading sun leaving behind traces of oranges and pinks across the low hanging clouds. Once upon a time, she would have found the sight beautiful, she would have inhaled the scent of the ocean, and it would have calmed her world. Now, it did nothing. </p><p>The dull and empty feeling of her soul was all she could feel, and that wasn’t much of a feeling as more of a thought. Too much had happened. She had endured too much pain. The war was over, and the people around her were moving on with their lives. They were picking up the pieces and fitting them back together. That wasn’t possible for her. No, she had lost it all, and while many would argue of everything she still had, it wasn’t enough. Her heart had been knifed in two. </p><p>Closing her eyes, she could almost feel the taste of him on her lips. It had been too long since she had felt the warmth of his embrace. A tear slid down her cheek as she choked back a sob at the thought of his broken body lying in the corridor, a pile of stone hiding half of him. She remembered after the battle, watching as his family surrounded his body, grief evident to everyone in the Great Hall. She stood by, not able to do anything but stare on to the man she cared so much for, but no one else knew - except maybe George. But his life was forever altered as well. Fred was gone, and that was the first blow to her heart. </p><p>The second came only two weeks later - her parents were gone too. After painstakingly hunting them down in Australia, she had found out they had died six months previously in a mugging gone bad. The police report she was able to procure left her sickened at the disgusting way her parents were maimed before being left to die in a dark alley. </p><p>There was nothing left; she couldn’t feel the beat of her heart against her ribs. Her limbs were heavy and hard to move, and the rock that had become her stomach lurched heavily in her gut. </p><p>“It’s okay,” Hermione whispered to herself. “The other side is waiting for you. They’re waiting for you.” </p><p>Now, she was just an obstacle against nature; a void against the wind blowing heavily from the east. The feeling of spreading her arms wide and gently falling forwards wasn’t scary or regrettable. This was the first relief she had felt for quite some time. </p><p>The fall didn’t take nearly as long as she thought it would, and as she hit the water, she didn’t feel the cold of the swirling ocean. The hurt that broke her body and dimmed her soul was welcoming; it was like a friend that embraced her. Her mind grew dark, and the tiny spots that danced against her lids were beginning to fade. She gladly let her mind go, and her heart stopped beating.</p>
