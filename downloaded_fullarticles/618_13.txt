  <strong>I’m sorry this is not an update to the others, please forgive me. This is an expanded version of something I posted about 6 moths ago and have taken down as I didn’t like the lack of depth and it felt like there wasn’t enough background. What I wrote then will most likely appear as a chapter down the line but for now this is the start of yet another one. I’m sorry. The others will be updated in due course :)</strong>

</p><p><em>What on earth made you think this was a good idea?</em> Minerva was stood back against the door to her personal chambers, left hand grasped tightly to her teaching robes, right hand fisted as her forearm covered her eyes. Her slow groan of an exhale the only sound in the room, but to her ears the blood rushing through them was as deafening. With each tight chested beat her heart made her body tingle with the pleasurable warmth that she hadn’t felt so intensely in many a year. In fact she knew exactly when the last time her body had felt like this and it had been four years previous.</p><p>She had avoided the cause of her current state, by wit, cunning and on more than one occasion sheer dumb luck. And here she was acting like a teenager with a crush, rushing to her rooms and hiding.</p><p>“You are earlier than I thought darling. Are you coming up to bed?” Her wife, her beautiful, intelligent and committed wife of 22 years was stood atop the flight of stairs beckoning her to bed. “I would have thought with the time you two spent together when she was at school  I thought I wouldn’t see you for hours.” A raised eyebrow was thrown in her direction. One of the things Minerva disliked about her wife was the quirks she had picked up from her over the years.</p><p>Minerva lowered her arm from her eyes and immediately and with half a century to practice hid her ravaging emotions in a split second to smile pleasingly at the love of her life. Well at least that what she had always told herself. That the woman she had courted for 8 years and been married to for 22 more was the love of her life. That was indeed the case until her heart began to flutter at the sound of a certain bushy haired witch, when her ears would prick at the mention by others of her and the butterfly’s that would flap insistently when she was in her presence. Those gorgeous pools of molten brown that she could get and indeed on a number of occasions had been lost in. “I too my love. However as I have the starts of what I believe is a migraine and it is her first night in the castle we thought best to retire early. I’m sure,” the picture of her glorious smile passed through her mind, “that there will be plenty time for us to catch up and engage in the kind of conversations I know bores you to near death darling.” The smile that graced the woman’s lips would light up any room and her wife looked down on her mirroring the gesture.</p><p>Minerva McGonagall very rarely if ever got herself into any trouble. At least not that hadn’t been caused by Albus in their younger years. This however was going to be trouble. Why had she allowed her to come back to the castle. Why did she think the same thing wouldn’t happen again. Of course she was well aware of the insanity of it all but here she was having just welcomed Hermione Granger to the teaching staff having not seen her for 4 years. Obviously when Hermione had been at school there was never impropriety however much she allowed her eyes to wander in the girls last 2 years of education. After Hermione had taken a year to travel to Australia allowing her parents to get to know her all over again Minerva thought she was in the clear. Her wandering thoughts and eyes had a year without having to think about it. And for a year she allowed her mind to occasionally find the pleasing picture of the young woman. Upon her return to Britain Minerva had welcomed her back to the castle with open arms to apprentice in Charm. What she didn’t expect was the waves of attraction to rear themselves with zealousness that rendered her quite teenage like in the young woman’s presence. She of course had to keep a lid on it. Her wife would not find out, could not find out about how she longed to look, to feel and above all to touch. The two years she had spent in the castle had not been the most pleasurable for her and had been the most strenuous of her then 26 year relationship. She had never felt anything like this for her wife and yet she quashed everything down and vented a self loathing and missarble façade in everyone bar Hermione. There were night her wife would leave the castle and not return till morning but she couldn’t bring herself to care nor to ask where she had been. She wanted to give her all the trust she could muster but she was well aware that she was being a miserable sod and wouldn’t have blamed her wife for seeking out someone else.</p><p>All she could think about for those 2 years was the busy hair, chocolate eyes, the smile of a goddess and the curves her fingertips tingled in need to touch. But she refrained, she smouldered in a frustration created by her own need and want. She doesn’t think she has masturbated so much before in her life than she had done over the course of those years. It was an unending frustration to want to feel the young witches’ hands on her and not her own. Her wife failed to do anything to ease the pressure, not that during that time she had even tried. Minerva had spent many nights in their en-suit bathroom with her fingers deep inside herself and grateful for magic, being able to prevent her from hearing as Hermione’s name was wrenched from her lips over and over with every shuddering breath of her release.</p><p>And here she was back in the castle after 4 years working abroad for the ministry. 4 years that had brought her back with a glowing tan, lightening of her hair and with an air of female maturity that can only come with an adventure in finding herself. She was even more beautiful and alluringly tempting. So tempting she had nearly given in, nearly. Almost brought her fingertips up to dance along the jawline, to slip into the hair and draw them closer together. Nearly looked her in the eye, but she knew that would be a bad idea as she would give herself away, and that would not be a good idea. As far as she knew Hermione was as straight as an arrow and had a boyfriend or at least that is what she had managed to gather from the snippets she had tuned into from those they both spoke to. She had never asked as knowing would mean more guilt when she imagined her lips trailing down the smooth torso and she most certainly wouldn’t want to loose her fantasies now would she.</p><p>The problem with all of this…. She could not have been more wrong if she tired.</p><p>Hermione Granger sunk back into her sofa hand over her eyes and signing deeply. She had known that this was a bad idea. Why had she decided it was a good idea to come back here of all places. Why had she thought that she would be able to survive in such close proximity to the woman of her dreams? She had held a flame for the Headmistress for many years and knew beyond a doubt that she would have to suffer in silence. There was no one she could turn to and no one to listen to her maddening thoughts. She had talked Ginny’s ear off when they had been at school about it. She had talked Harry and Ron’s heads off about it whilst she had been apprenticed in the school. However the person she would turn to these days her girlfriend was most definitely not the person to be telling this to. She would not and could not very well turn round to the woman who had given up her life and moved to this country, to be brought to a huge castle in the missile of nowhere and tell her that the urge, the want and the need to be close to, to touch and caress the wonderful woman that was Minerva McGonagall.</p><p> </p><p>Please review </p>
