    <p>Harry and Draco have been together since Harry and Hermione broke up when James was two. The men realized, around the time James turned 9, that Draco was still expected to have an heir. Astoria Greengrass was more than happy to carry Draco's child. Due to pureblood traditions, they had to be married before the child was conceived and through the entire pregnancy. She didn't want children herself, so when she gave birth to Scorpius, she signed away her rights, her and Draco got divorced, and that was that. When Draco had met James, he was just a friend of Harry's. He loved Draco, and Scorpius though he insists that they aren't brothers, but James was perfectly content when Draco was his "uncle". He only had one dad, and that was Harry. He did not like being told that Draco was his father.</p><p> </p><p>*April 2010 (three months before James turns 11)*</p><p>"Hey, Jamie, I have to work late today, so Draco will pick you up tonight," Harry said as he dropped his son at the Zabini house. Despite his feelings towards Draco, James loved his Uncle Blaise.</p><p>"What time will you be getting home?" James asked.</p><p>"After you go to bed."</p><p>"Does that mean he is putting me to bed?"</p><p>"And making sure you take a shower, brush your teeth, say goodnight to your brother-"</p><p>"He's not my brother. He simply lives in the house with us." Harry sighed, but didn't push the issue. He stood up and knocked on the door. "Uncle Blaise! Is Uncle Ron here?" </p><p>"Hey there, little man! He's in the kitchen making you breakfast," Blaise said. James hugged his father and pushed passed Blaise. He turned to Harry, "no Scorp today?"</p><p>"Him and Dray are going to see Cissa. James didn't want to go."</p><p>"Still not accepting them as part of the family?"</p><p>"He says that they just live with us. He didn't have a problem with Draco until 'Mione gave up her share of custody over two years ago. Now he pushes him away."</p><p>"Has he seen any of the Weasleys lately or his mum?"</p><p>"We had dinner at the Burrow last night. Everyone was there."</p><p>"I bet Molly was so excited to see Scorpius. Draco did good with him, my godson is absolutely perfect."</p><p>"Hey, mine isn't bad either!" Ron said, suddenly appearing behind his boyfriend.</p><p>"Yes, darling. James is wonderful. Just get him to accept Draco and Scorp and everything will be better."</p><p>"Yikes. I'm so glad all we do is babysit."</p><p>"Prick. I'm going to work. If there's an emergency Floo Draco first, he'll be able to get here quicker."</p><p> </p><p>Draco had grown oddly fond of his car. It made life much easier. He didn't enjoy trying to Apparate with James and Scorpius, nor did he like using the Floo with them. His car was perfect. Harry had helped him get his license and he never regretted it. When he pulled up to his best friend's house that evening, he could already feel that he was going to have an issue with his stepson. He sighed and got out of the car, grabbed the baby and diaper bag, then walked up the driveway. He didn't bother knocking before entering the flat. "Blaise, I have a surprise for you."</p><p>"It better be a stripper, food, or my godson!" Blaise called from the sitting room. Draco heard a slap. "Okay, fine, no strippers." </p><p>"Jamie what are-"</p><p>"He's probably hiding from me. He's been doing that quite a lot lately," Draco cut Ron off as he walked into the room. Blaise jumped up at the sight of Scorpius and took him from his father. Draco set the diaper bag on a chair.</p><p>"He's so gorgeous and little. Ronnie, I want one," he whined, looking at the eight month old in his arms.</p><p>"Sure thing, love. We'll have a baby. That's if you can find someone who would be willing to get pregnant for one of us and not keep the baby. Ferret got lucky with Tori."</p><p>"This is true, Blaise. Weasel would have an adorable ginger child with anyone, your child would have a gorgeous skin tone, and no one would give up a kid with either of your facial structures," Draco said. Him and Ron were good friends and the rodent names were used out of habit rather than dislike.</p><p>"Did you just admit that I am actually good looking?" Ron asked, stealing Scorpius from Blaise. Draco just shrugged and winked.</p><p>"Hands off, Malfoy. Weasley is mine," Blaise said in a mock-threatening manner.</p><p>"I have had the Savior for almost nine years now. I don't need a pet." The three men held their serious faces for a moment before laughing. "I think it's time for us to go. I still need to feed the boys and get them in bed." </p><p>"I don't wanna go," James said, popping up from behind a chair.</p><p>"That's a shame. I was going to make lasagna tonight. I'm sure Blaise will make you some steamed veggies, if you'd rather stay here," Draco said.</p><p>"I don't have to go with you! I want my dad to come get me!"</p><p>"Jamie, he is your dad," Ron said.</p><p>"No! I want my real dad! That Death Eater will never be my dad!" James yelled. Scorpius started crying in Ron's arms. Draco stood, stunned, in the middle of the room.</p><p>"James, who taught you to say that?" Ron asked, letting Blaise take the baby.</p><p>"Mum. She told Aunt Fleur that Dad left her to get shagged by a Death Eater who isn't worthy of love," James said, feeling proud for remembering every word he heard his mum say.</p><p>"Blaise, love, stay here with the boys. I'm gonna take Draco to Harry's office," Ron said. Blaise nodded as Ron walked over to Draco. He placed a hand on his shoulder. "I'm gonna do a Side-Along, okay?" Draco nodded and Ron Apparated them. They quickly made their way to Harry's office. They were stopped by Harry's receptionist and told that he didn't want to be bothered. Ron began arguing with the woman, but Draco simply stepped passed her desk and opened the door to Harry's office.</p><p>"Ron? Draco? What's wrong? Are the boys okay?"</p><p>"The boys are fine. Blaise is with them," Ron said, stepping into the room. He sat in the chair that was facing Harry. Draco simply leaned against a wall and shut the door. </p><p>"Did something happen to Cissa? Or Molly?" </p><p>"No. They're fine. Harry, how much time does James spend with his mum?"</p><p>"He sees her every other weekend she's not busy with whatever bloke she's with now. He saw her last night at dinner. Why?"</p><p>"She kinda...um...I'm not quite sure how to put this..erh.. she told Fleur that Draco is a disgusting Death Eater that doesn't deserve love. I don't know if James overheard or if she just didn't care that he was there," Ron stuttered.</p><p>"Did he..." Harry trailed off, not wanting to ask.</p><p>"He said, yelled actually, 'that Death Eater will never be my dad.'"</p><p>"I can't believe...why would he...I knew he didn't like him but..."</p><p>"Harry, you need to talk to him. I know I can't say shit about raising a kid, but he needs to understand that Draco and Scorp aren't going anywhere."</p><p>"What about Hermione? I need to talk to her."</p><p>"Not right now, mate. Right now you need to have a talk with your son. Worry about her another time. Trust me, she'll get hers once the family hears about this."</p><p>"You're right. Let's go." Harry let his very upset receptionist know that he was leaving early and the three of them went back to Blaise's house.</p><p>"Scorp, look. It's your Daddy and Father. I don't know why Draco is so damn formal even after all these years," Blaise cooed.</p><p>"Blaise, would you mind watching Scorpius tonight? Everything you would need should be in his bag. If not, we're just a Floo away," Harry asked. Blaise shared a silent conversation Ron that ended with him smiling and the ginger groaning.</p><p>"Ronniekins and I would love to watch him. I can finally prove that I will be a great dad."</p><p>"Ron, make sure you guys call us before Molly if something happens. She'll kill us if she knows we let the two of you watch him before she got to."</p><p>"Dad! You're here!" James said, running down the stairs. He threw himself at Harry, who caught him.</p><p>"Hey, kid," Harry's smile wasn't as bright as it usually is, but it was still present. No matter how upset he was, he wouldn't let James think he didn't love him. "We're leaving your brother with Blaise tonight."</p><p>"So it's just you and me?" James asked.</p><p>"No. Its you, me, and Draco tonight. We have a lot to talk about."</p><p>"Whatever he told you, he's lying," James said. Draco was still silent and expressionless when the kid sent him a glare. Harry turned to look at his boyfriend and was shocked. He hadn't seen him look that numb since the War. He quickly thanked Blaise and Ron before ushering James out of the house, knowing Draco would follow. He felt something being pressed into his hand and looked down. </p><p>"Dray, you never let me drive your car. Are you sure?" The look he was given in return was enough of an answer.</p><p> </p><p>"James don't you dare go to your room. You aren't avoiding this conversation," Harry said. His son sighed, a habit he had picked up from Draco, and went to sit in an armchair. Harry sat on the couch and motioned for Draco to sit next to him.</p><p>"Am I in trouble?"</p><p>"Should you be?"</p><p>"I don't know. Uncle Ron seemed upset with me and Uncle Blaise didn't talk to me while you guys were all gone. Is Scorpius his favorite now?"</p><p>"Blaise doesn't have a favorite. Him and Ron were just disappointed, and from what I hear they have good reason to be." It was silent while Harry waited for a response. James wriggled uncomfortably in his seat, but didn't speak. "James, what did you call Draco?"</p><p>"I called him a....mean person."</p><p>"James Sirius, you know better than to lie to me."</p><p>"I called him a Death Eater." Draco flinched almost imperceptibly. Harry squeezed his hand.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"I don't know. I don't even know what it means, Dad. Honest. I heard mum-" he stopped, not wanting to get his mother into anymore trouble.</p><p>"Ron told me where you heard it. James, someone else saying something doesn't mean it's okay to say. As for Draco being your father, he has been there for you just as much as I have. He has helped raise you. I don't know what has gotten into you in the last few years, but this has got to stop." James opened his mouth to interject, but was stopped when Harry lifted his hand. "You can't blame Scorpius being born. You started shoving Draco away before Scorp was born."</p><p>"I'm sorry, Dad. I just thought...maybe if he wasn't around then you'd go back to Mum. And I thought that if I didn't like him, then you wouldn't either. And Mum was always saying that she was better for you and that everyone else thought so too."</p><p>"Jamie, has anyone else ever said those things?"</p><p>"Aunt Fleur. She hates him. She said that I'm not allowed to play with Tori because of it."</p><p>"What about your Uncles? Or Aunt Luna? Aunt Pansy?" James shook his head. "Papa or Gramma Weasley?" He shook his head again. "See, Jamie? Most of them love Draco. Wanna know why?" He nodded. "Because I do. I'm not going to lie to you, there was a time that I hated him, but I have spent more time loving him. Everyone except your Mum and Fleur have looked passed the things that happened. All the bad things hat he did, was because we were in a war. No one will tell you this except me and Draco, but I did bad things too."</p><p>"Why won't anyone else say that?"</p><p>"Because they want things to be simple. Good or bad. Gryffindor or Slytherin. Potter or Malfoy. They don't want the 'or' to become 'and'. They don't realize that people can be both. I'm going to tell you a secret. The only other people that know are Albus Dumbledore and Draco. You can't tell anyone, okay?"</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"I could have been a Slytherin," Harry stage whispered. The corner of Draco's mouth twitched, he always thought it was funny to imagine his wonderfully Gryffindor boyfriend in Slytherin colors.</p><p>"But you're a Gryffindor! You can't be both. They're opposites."</p><p>"You've spent too much time with Ron and Blaise. Jamie, the whole point is, just because your Mum and Fleur haven't let it go, doesn't mean you need to follow their opinions. Make your own. Tell me, does Draco know your favorite food?"</p><p>"Lasagna," Draco said.</p><p>"Favorite ice cream?" Harry continued.</p><p>"Mint chocolate, same as me," Draco looked at the floor as he spoke.</p><p>"Does Draco hold you when you have a nightmare and I'm on a mission? Has he been just as much of a father as I have?" James nodded. "Then why don't you accept him as your dad?"</p><p>"He doesn't love me," James said.</p><p>"What? Who told you that nonsense?" Draco asked.</p><p>"Mum told Uncle Bill that she thinks you put up with me because you have to and you don't love me."</p><p>"Harry you better keep Granger away from me or I'll end up sitting right next to my Father in Azkaban," Draco whispered. He then stood up, walked over to James, and knelt in front of him. "James Sirius Potter, no matter what anyone ever tells you, I love you. You were my first son, whether you accepted it or not. I have loved you since the first time your dad brought you to see me and my Mum. It was such a wonderful sight. A new life after so many had been taken. James, you were, and still are, a beacon of hope. You mean so much to me. People will tell you that they would die for someone, but dying is easy unless you're the Boy Who Lived, so I would live for you. Even if just to see you every day, or as great as getting to watch you grow up and become an even better man than your dad, to hold you when you get scared, to laugh with you, to help you with Potions because Merlin knows your dad can't. I love you, James. Never doubt that for a second." Silence followed Draco's little speech.</p><p>"I'm sorry," James said, tears running down his face. Draco reached out and held the boy. After a while, he sat himself on the floor and pulled James into his lap. "Do you think Scorpius wants to be my brother?" He asked after he calmed down.</p><p>"I think he already is," Draco replied.</p><p>"Good because I've always wanted a brother." Harry and Draco chuckled. They sat in silence for a while. Draco was stroking James' hair in a way he knew would not only calm the boy, but make him sleepy as well. "Dad, do I have to take a bath?" He asked through a yawn.</p><p>"Not tonight, buddy. But you will first thing in the morning," Harry answered. He moved to take James from Draco, but the child tightened his hold.</p><p>"I want Draco to tuck me in." The men shared surprised looks as Draco carefully stood and balanced James in his arms. He quickly helped James change, and tucked him in.</p><p>"Goodnight, Jamie. I love you," Draco placed arms kiss on his forehead and began to leave.</p><p>"Night. Love you, Father." Draco walked back to where Harry was sitting.</p><p>"You okay?" Harry asked.</p><p>"Yeah. I'm fine. Just...um. James said he loves me." Draco plopped himself into Harry's lap.</p><p>"Right, he's said that before. We've known that for years, but after today I guess that's still a victory."</p><p>"Harry, he didn't just say that. He called me 'Father'."</p><p>"He did?" Harry almost yelled in excitement as Draco nodded. The men held each other for what felt like hours, before Draco remember something Harry had said.</p><p>"Harry."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"You said that people don't like when 'or' turns to 'and'."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Those 'or's were good and bad, Hogwarts houses, and our last names."</p><p>"Mhmm."</p><p>"When did our last names become 'and'?"</p><p>"When we got together."</p><p>"No. That was 'Harry and Draco'. Besides, you were saying that people are one or the other. Good or bad. Potter or Malfoy. Then you said those can change. Good and bad. Potter and Malfoy. How could someone be a Potter and a Malfoy?"</p><p>"Well, I was thinking we could hyphenate."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"You know, when we get married. We could be Potter-Malfoy. Therefore, Potter AND Malfoy."</p><p>"Potter, we aren't even engaged. You can't be planning out last name."</p><p>"Marry me."</p><p>"This is your proposal? A demand while we're sitting on the couch after our son finally accepted me?"</p><p>"Well fine, then, you can wait another 6 months and I'll find another, more romantic, way to do it."</p><p>"What? No. That isn't what I meant."</p><p>"Fine. Let me try again." Harry cleared his throat. "Draco Malfoy. It's been almost eight years. Please fucking marry me already, you prick."</p><p>"That, Harry Potter, is the best damn proposal I have ever heard. Of course I'll marry you." He leaned down to press a kiss to Harry's lips. Harry waved his hand and a ring box flew to him. "Wandless magic and a ring? You really know how to make a boy swoon." Harry slipped the ring onto Draco's finger. It was a simple silver band that twisted into a heart, though upon closer inspection 'Harry &amp; Draco' was engraved along the heart.</p><p>"Do you like it?"</p><p>"I love it. I love you."</p><p>"I love you too."</p>
