    <p>Something was poking me. I was trying to sleep and something was poking me. In an effort to try and escape the poking, I turned onto my side.</p><p>It didn't do much. I got poked harder.</p><p>Whatever was poking me would die. Slowly and painfully. It. Would. Die.</p><p>Poke. Poke. Poke.</p><p>"What do you want?!?! Can't you see that I am trying to sleep and you poking me isn't helping?!" I pulled myself out from my covers and turned to see the face of my prick of a cousin (who honestly, was more like a brother), Scorpius.</p><p>"Well someone is in a bad mood," Scorpius said, smirking. He walked over to my window and opened the drapes, letting the sunlight in.</p><p>"Yeah well I have an arsehole with a death wish poking me," I said, pulling my covers back over my head to block the light. "Now go away."</p><p>"Actually I was sent here to wake you up," Scorpius said and I felt him jump onto the bed and lay beside me. “It’s already ten.”</p><p>"Who in their right mind would send you here to wake me up? Your parents know that’s a good way to die." I pulled my head out of the covers and looked at him. “Maybe they want you to die, Scorp. And here I thought they were such loving parents.”</p><p>"Ha ha,” Scorpius said, with no real laughter in his voice. “But seriously, my mom sent me. She says it's time for you to get out of bed."</p><p>He got off the bed and started walking towards the door.</p><p>"Well I am not getting out of bed," I said, pulling the covers over my head once again and getting ready to fall back into my deep sleep. “There’s no reason for me too, anyway.”</p><p>"Alright. But the End of Summer party at the Weasley's is going to start in an hour so you might want to get up and fix that mess on your head."</p><p>I practically jumped out of my bed upon hearing this. However, this didn't go over well because I was covered in blankets so I ended up landing on the ground, with all the blankets from my bed with me. As Scorpius shut the door, I could hear him laughing.</p><p>What a prick.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>"Addie, is that really what you are wearing?" Aunt Astoria said when I got downstairs. I looked down at my white sundress. I thought it looked rather cute. It was really the best I could do with only one hour to get completely ready.</p><p>"Yes, I wasn't awoken early enough to get completely ready and do my hair. Having curly hair is very time consuming you know," I said, sending her a teasing smile.</p><p>Astoria sighed as if I was aggravating her.</p><p>"Well, I think she looks beautiful," Draco said as he entered the room. He had lost some of his hair, but it was still the signature Malfoy Blonde. Draco was normally the last one to be ready, so it was a little strange to not be waiting for him. "Now is everyone ready to go?"</p><p>"No. Your son isn't here yet," Astoria said, looking at the clock again. "He is still getting ready. Seems like he takes after his father in that department. Must be some sort of Malfoy trait that all three of you got."</p><p>Draco raised his eyebrows at me, knowing that his perfectly punctual wife was very annoyed at the three of us for being tardy. I tried not to laugh as he put on a dramatic distraught face and walked towards her.</p><p>"Oh honey," Draco said as he wrapped his arms around her. "I'm so sorry. How could I have done this to our son? How could my ancestors do this to our niece? How will the Malfoy family survive with our inability to be ready on time? Can you ever forgive me for doing to this our family?"</p><p>Astoria started smiling at this and wrapped her arms around him too.</p><p>“Maybe,” Astoria said. “You’re annoying, you know that?</p><p>“But you love me,” Draco said. “Addison, go get your cousin.”</p><p>“What why?” I said. “I was ready on time, why do I have to fetch him?”</p><p>“Because I want to kiss your aunt and not scare you,” Draco said.</p><p>“You guys are embarrassing,” I said, rolling my eyes and leaving the room to retrieve my cousin.</p><p>When I reached his room, I entered his room without knocking and instantly regretted the decision to do so. It smelled...bad. Not like the normal teenage boy bad but like...I didn't even know. Like there were 30 things of cologne in the air. Also Scorpius was standing in a ridiculous outfit: A tux jacket and boxers.</p><p>I worry about him.</p><p>"Um Scorp?" I said, covering my nose with my hand. "Are you almost ready?"</p><p>"No!!" He threw a pair of pants across the room. "I have nothing to wear!"</p><p>I looked at all the clothes on the floor that proved otherwise.</p><p>"Scorpius it isn't that hard," I said. I walked over to his closet and pulled out a plaid shirt and a pair of shorts. "Wear this."</p><p>He looked at it, looking thoroughly unimpressed. "But this is so plain. No one will think I look good especially not-"</p><p>"SCORPIUS AND ADDISON, ARE YOU READY TO GO YET?! WE ARE ALREADY TWENTY MINUTES LATE!" Astoria yelled from downstairs.</p><p>I guess she has had enough of our lack of punctuality.</p><p>"Wear it. Plaid always makes boys look better. And don't wear cologne," I said as he reached for a bottle. "Your room smells enough that it will rub off on you. Now let's go before your mother kills us."</p><p>We got downstairs and apparated to my best friend’s house, the house of the wonderful Rose Weasley and her wonderful parents and her quiet but I assume wonderful brother.</p><p>"You should let me dress you more often," I said, observing Scorp’s outfit. Astoria and Draco walked ahead of us, Astoria clearly stressing about the implications of us being late. "I do a pretty good job. Every girl will be practically all over you."</p><p>"I don't need every girl. Only one."  Scorpius had a nervous look on his face as he scoped out the other latecomers to the party, as if he was looking for someone.</p><p>"Wait, what? Do you have a crush?!?! TELL ME!" I said, trying to keep quiet so that his parents don't hear even though they were only five feet in front of us.</p><p>"No. I don't."</p><p>“Yes you do. You just said so."</p><p>“No I didn't. And no I don't."</p><p>"Yes you did and yes you do."</p><p>"No I don't-"</p><p>"Well if it isn't the Malfoy family!" I looked up at the door and saw Hermione Weasley standing there, inviting us in. Scorpius ran right in, ready to get away from me and my stubborn question asking.</p><p>“Hermione, I’m so sorry we’re late,” Astoria said. “And I’m so sorry Scorpius just ran in without saying hi. I’ll have to discuss basic manners with him again, I suppose.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Hermione said. “I’m sure he’s just going to try to find Al and the rest of them.”</p><p>I had to resist the urge to roll my eyes and fortunately was distracted by my name being yelled.</p><p>"ADDIE!" I heard and turned around and see said best friend (see above) running toward me, her red hair as red as ever, opening her arms wide only to hit someone in the face.</p><p>Yes, that was my best friend.</p><p>No, you cannot judge.</p><p>I waved to Astoria and Draco and walked towards Rose who, being Rose, made sure the person was alright and even made small talk with them before coming and attacking me with a hug.</p><p>"Rosie, how are you?" I asked.</p><p>"I'm good!!" she said. "I can't wait to be back at Hogwarts though. I love Mum and Dad but they can become overbearing after a while-"</p><p>“Hello there Addie!” said Ron Weasley, who came up to Rose and me. Well stumbled is a better word. He seemed a little tipsy. I looked over at Rose and saw that she looked horrified. “Your aunt and uncle here?”</p><p>“Hello Mr. Weasley!” I replied. “Yes they are, they are over there”</p><p>I pointed over to where Astoria stood, discussing something with Hermione, while Draco stood awkwardly by, looking around for someone he could talk to as well.</p><p>“Your uncle looks rather uncomfortable doesn’t he?” Ron asked. “Might have to go tease him a little and remind him that for our wive’s and kids’s sake, we’re supposed to be comfortable around each other.”</p><p>“Dad, don’t be mean-“ Rose started, but was cut off.</p><p>“I’m not being mean! It’s called teasing Rosie,” Ron said, though this didn’t seem to help Rose’s worry at all. “Although just because you and your mother decided to befriend members of this family does not mean I have to. Obviously Astoria and Addie are great but the other two…” Ron took a sip of whatever was in his cup.</p><p>“Dad, you’re being rude to Addie’s family,” Rose said.</p><p>“I mean he’s not wrong,” I said. “I am the best thing in that family. Scorpius is the worst. He woke me up this morning.”</p><p>Rose sent me a look that said I was not helping things.</p><p>“Dad, Addie and I are going to head outside, why don’t you go find Mum-“ Rose started but was interrupted by her dad.</p><p>“Well Rosie, I hope you and Addie have fun! But Rosie,” He put his hands on her shoulder, acting like he was going to give her great advice. Which meant that whatever he was going to say in his drunken state would probably be hilarious. “I need you to stay away from that Scorpius boy.”</p><p>To say Rose turned bright red at this point would be an understatement. She turned into a tomato. And since her hair was red, she looked really funny.</p><p>“I know you have a crush on him,” Ron said making really funny gestures with his hand. Rose turned even MORE bright red (I didn’t even think that was possible since she was already SO red. But she did. That girl never seizes to amaze me) and I started giggling. “But he is the son of Draco Malfoy. Who is not very good. So stay away from him. Actually, stay away from boys in general.”</p><p>I couldn’t help but giggle harder at this because for as long as I could remember, Rose had only ever had a crush on Scorpius to the point where, besides a small period in fourth year, she never even looked at another boy. While Rose stood there being a tomato and I stood there giggling like a drunk person, Ron stumbled off to drunkenly greet other people. Once he left Rose punched me in the arm.</p><p>“OW!” I said. Because Rose is a lot stronger then she looks. “What the bloody hell was that for?”</p><p>“That was for not defending your own family and for bloody giggling while my dad embarrassed me!” Rose said. “He thinks I like Scorpius. I mean honestly. That’s just…REDICULOUS! How could I even like Scorpius?! He’s so, so…” Rose seemed to have to think about something wrong with Scorpius that would somehow prove she doesn’t like him.</p><p>“So, what Rose?” I said. “So…perfect for you and that is why you like him so much?”</p><p>“Exactly!” Rose said in agreement. Then she realized of what she said. “NO! NO! I didn’t mean that! NO! I DON’T like him!”</p><p>“Alright Rose, whatever you say,” I said, linking my arm through hers and beginning to walk outside. “So since you don’t like Scorpius, any cute boys here?”</p><p>"Just the normal situation. So basically all family for me."</p><p>"And what is wrong with your family, Ms. Rose?" James Sirius Potter came up behind us and asked. "Hey Addie!."</p><p>"James!!" I said and hugged him. James was a year older then me, Rose and Scorpius so I don't see him too often because he is always hanging out with his friends. But that didn't stop James and I from becoming a big brother figure in my life. Partly it’s impossible to be friends with a Potter/Weasley and not gain a bunch of sibling figures in your life.</p><p>He hugged me back and said down into my blonde curls, "Well I sure am glad that our parents don't hate each other anymore. Because then I wouldn't be able to see your beautiful face."</p><p> I laughed until I heard, "Well if you don't get your hands off of my cousin then you might not be alive to see her again."</p><p>Scorpius. Lovely to see you again.</p><p>James took his hands off me and said to Scorp, "Dude, come on. She's like my sister. I would never do that."</p><p>You see, Scorpius tends to think it’s the eighteen hundreds and that I need to be protected from guys because “all guys do is break hearts, I’m a guy I know”. I pointed out that it was sexist to think this way and that I could take care of myself and he said he knew, but that he just wanted to spare me some pain in my life since I already had so much.</p><p>He had not been very kind when my first boyfriend broke up with me because I wouldn’t do more with him than I was ready to. He yelled at him a lot to where my ex broke down into tears before Scorpius realized maybe it wasn’t the best way to handle problems.</p><p>"Come on Scorpius, like Addie would even LET James do that," Rose said.</p><p>It appeared to be the first time that Scorpius noticed she was there. All of a sudden his mean I-will-kill-James thing was gone and he got all shy and started stammering.</p><p>And that is when I knew.</p><p>Scorpius liked Rose.</p><p>It was all I could do not to jump up and down in the air with glee. Because normally Scorp falls for these girls who are not compatible for him in any way and he ends up dumping after a week because he was bored.</p><p>But this time he liked Rose! And they were PERFECT for each other!! I always hoped that they would fall for each other. On their wedding day, when I was Maid of Honor (because no way is Rose not letting me be Maid on Honor. I don't care who has to be "taken care of" I am getting that spot) I would have to make a toast about how I knew they were perfect for each other and how-</p><p>"ADDIE." A hand waved in my face, taking me away from the daydream I was having of their wedding. Whoever is doing this will die.</p><p>Oh it was Rose. She could live. It took too much time to break in a new best friend.</p><p>"Yes?" I said.</p><p>"You were kinda staring off and not paying attention to the conversation," Scorpius said. I tried to send him telepathic messages telling him I knew. I didn't think he is got them though. "You looked like you were going insane or something."</p><p>"Oh she's already insane."</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>No. No. No.</p><p>Not here. I didn't want to deal with this stupid tosser today.</p><p>Please Merlin? I was having a good day and didn't need HIM to ruin it.</p><p>He moved forward from the side of Scorpius. I didn't see him there before. How nice of him to come into the conversation now. NOT.</p><p>Right when Scorpius picks a nice girl to fancy, his idiot of a best friend is still around. Why is Scorpius best friends with him? He is nothing but a arsehole-tosser-prick-know-it-all-Mr.-I-think-I-am-better-then-everyone-because-my-dad-saved-the-Wizarding-World.</p><p>"It's just another thing that is on her bad qualities list." Albus said, flashing me a smirk.</p><p>Thanks for nothing, Merlin.</p>
