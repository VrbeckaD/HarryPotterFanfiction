    <p>Hands were wrapped around his legs and arms, pulling him further and further down into the dark cold water. He wanted to scream but the fear of letting water in was overpowering the need to breath. He kicked out and moved around as much as he possibly could, till he had fallen out of most of their clambie grips. The small boy bobbed his head against the surface of the water, and inhaled. The sweet air filled his lungs, he gasped literally like a fish out of water and lunged forward for the dark island, they were already so close again, an he felt a small touch to his tight and let out a horrifying scream. He was so close now, he could see Kreacher with his gigantic eyes wide in fear. </p><p>“Kreacher!” Regulus screamed, his sentences was cut off by water filling his air ways again as one of the inferis bore its teeth into his leg, dragging him down under again. He kicked it back and broke the water again. “Take the Horcrux! Leave and find a way to destroy it!” Kreacher looked on the break of panic, he was shaking his head frantically. “GO!” Regulus snapped as he was grabbed around the torso, long sharp nails digging into his side.</p><p>He went under this time with no chance of pulling himself out of the Inferis death grip. Sharp teeth where on his arm and shoulder now. He could feel his flesh splitting just around his dark mark. As the mark was broken an unbearable stilking pain went through his body, it felt worse than any Curius curse every thrown at him. He finally opened his mouth and screamed his heart out.</p><p>…. </p><p>By Hudson river, just underneath the first of the two Iron maiden bridges that lead into the brooding city of Gotham the water had started to stur. And out of the waves came a bloodied body. At first eye cast most people would have thought it was just one of the many corpses floating out from gotham. It was a frequent happening in gotham that people would go disappearing in the middle of the night, just to be found days later in the lake surrounding the city. But the boy wasn’t as death as it would seem. </p><p>As his body hit the shore he let out loud gasp, and frantically pulled himself into a sitting position on the cold weat stones. His clothes were soaked to his bones and ripped exposing bite and nail marks. He had been wearing a black warm turtleneck and grey dressing pants as he had entered the cave, couldn’t really call his holed sweater a turtleneck anymore after that incounder. His black hair was dripping and his wand was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>He curled in on himself, he was shaking rather violently, with nothing but the wet cloth in the October weather he was sure he would get hypochondriac. His whole body was hurting so much it was absolutely unbearable, he could feel every little feber of his body screaming at him. But he couldn’t think, he couldn’t do anything other than letting out quiet sobs as his body shook.  </p><p>Fortunately but unnoticed by the young Slytherin a shadow was making its way toward him with haisty steps.</p><p>…. </p><p>Will Regulus survive Gothams citys many crime filled streets? <br/>Does or small star get hypochondria? <br/>Who is the person in the shadow? </p><p>These questions will be answered in the next episode of …..</p>
