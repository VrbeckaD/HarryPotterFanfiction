    <p>
  <span>“I’m going to be the best villain this game has ever seen and help you achieve your happy end while my family falls to ruin!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Behind Harry, Tom watched Harry’s father slap himself in the forehead before dragging his hand down his face. A highly undignified move, but given what Tom’s fiancé had just said upon first meeting him, it was understandable. Though, given the look on the faces of the maids behind them, this wasn’t an unusual thing to hear.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Forgive my son, your highness. He’s been a bit unwell since he hit his head playing last week.” Duke Potter said, placing his hands on Harry’s shoulder and giving them a squeeze. Harry flinched, but Tom didn’t think anything of it. The duke loved his son more than his own life and wouldn’t abuse his children; if anything it was a warning for Harry to quit his talking while he still had a tongue to do so.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s alright,” Tom said, stepping aside and motioning for them to enter the parlor. “Why don’t we sit and have some tea while we chat? I’ve been dying to get to know my future husband and father-in-law.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Unfortunately, I must decline. I have a meeting to attend with the king concerning your engagement.” Duke Potter said, giving Tom a strained smile. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course. May it go well for you, then.” Tom said with his own smile. Of course, Tom knew what business Duke Potter held with the king—canceling the engagement between Tom and Harry before it could take fruition. It was cute, how he thought he could stop a direct request from the crown prince, the king’s precious and beloved grandson.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I sure hope it does.” Duke Potter muttered before turning and crouching down to his son’s level. “Now listen here, young man, I want you to stop spouting such nonsense, especially in front of the prince. It’s not proper and is going to cause trouble. Understood? We don’t want to lose our heads, do we?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, sir,” Harry said with a pout and Duke Potter smiled. He patted his son’s shoulders, gave Tom a small bow, nodded at the maid who would serve as Harry’s escort, and made his exit. Tom thought the head comment was a little unnecessary. The king was the one cut off heads for verbal discrepancies, Tom preferred to rip out tongues.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why don’t we sit and have tea?” Tom offered, trying to make the atmosphere between them a bit more bearable. Harry nodded eagerly and made his way to the table in the center of the room, pausing beside his chair to wait for Tom. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>At least he has some manners</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Tom thought as he made his way to the chair across from Harry and took his own seat. Harry sat as well and immediately began to eat one of the cakes set out while Tom sipped his tea.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His fiancé was exactly what he had expected but still different, as paintings could only be so accurate. He looked like his father in hair and skin tone, but his eyes were a bright green like his mothers. His other features were a perfect blend of his parents, his mother’s almond-shaped eyes and small nose complement well with his father’s bone structure and high cheekbones.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is Nagini, she’s my personal butler,” Tom said, motioning to the woman standing at attention behind him. “You’ll be seeing her a lot, so it’s best to get the introductions out of the way now.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Lord Potter,” Nagini said, laying her hand on her chest as she bowed to Harry, the perfect bow she gave every noble that had them swooning and cooing at her. Harry, however, just blinked at her for a moment before recognition sparked in his eyes and he smiled at her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s nice to meet you too, Nagini. You’re prettier in person.” Harry said happily, pouring what could constitute as an unreasonable amount of sugar into his tea before taking a sip. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you very much, my lordship. You’re lovely as well.” Nagini said, smiling softly at Harry. She had a soft spot for children, Tom knew, if her patience with him growing up was anything to go by. “But, I do believe this is the first time we’ve ever met. Perhaps you are mistaking me for someone else.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, you’re definitely Nagini.” Harry nodded to himself, setting his now-empty teacup to the side, which Nagini filled back up. “A very beautiful butler, never seen without being at the prince’s side, her dedication to his Highness the envy of all those around then! You were my third favorite character!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Character?” Nagini asked blankly before she blinked. “Wait, third favorite?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course! Tom is obviously first and always will be.” Harry said, taking another sip of his tea and looking at Tom with sparkles in his eyes. “You’re such a cute kid, the art didn’t do you justice.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t recall sending a portrait,” Tom said and Harry laughed, waving his hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, you didn’t, I meant in the game. They did art of when all the characters were younger and teased a game where you could be a child befriending everyone instead of seducing. I was so looking forward to it.” Harry sighed, looking wistfully into his teacup. “Raising affections instead of love, building the foundations for friendships and rivalry,</span>
  <em>

  </em>
  <span>A heroines tale before it all!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That sounds…nice,” Tom said, not having any idea of what Harry was talking about. He knew he wasn’t a normal child, far from it as his uncle liked to remind him, but he was sure not even a grown man would understand what Harry had just said to him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It really was.” Harry sighed then paused. “You probably didn’t understand any of that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I did not.” Tom said, taking a sip of his tea. He could see Nagini’s confused face in the corner of his eye and knew she didn’t get it either. The maid Harry had brought with him just looked tired, letting Tom know this was a normal day for her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, I know how this sounds, but this is real. Well, it’s real, but not real to me. Or it wasn’t, not at first. You see, your majesty, I reincarnated and this is just a game from my past life.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom blinked. Nagini blinked. The maid sighed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s okay if you don’t believe me, but I’m not from here originally. I was just a normal college student in London, living out my boring life before I died in an accident. At least, I thought I died because the next thing I knew, I woke up in my room in this world with the knowledge of this world in my mind. Your highness, this is nothing more than an otome game where I am the villainess standing in the way of your true happiness!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom decided that, while he wasn’t nearly old enough to have it, he would very much like some liquor in his tea. No one could really stop him if he wanted to and Nagini would probably ask for some. The maid could probably use a glass as well, seeing as her face was in her hands and Tom was sure she would cry if it was appropriate.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry stood suddenly, jolting the table but thankfully not knowing anything over. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Doki Doki ☆ Magical Academy of Love</span>
  </em>
  <span>, an otome game of love and betrayal! After coming to the academy to learn magic, the player will meet the beautiful demon prince Tom Riddle and fall madly in love with him. Through your hard work and dedication, love will blossom as his cold heart melts at your warm charms. But beware, for his fiancé is a cold person and will stand in your way at every turn. Defeat them at every turn, have them fall into ruin after their misdeeds are exposed, and live a life of love as the queen of the nation!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was a sound behind Tom, like someone trying very desperately to hold down their laughter, and he didn’t need to turn around to know it was Nagini. She was probably enjoying all of the words used to describe him accurately, like “handsome demon prince” and “cold person”.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, your highness.” Harry continued, grinning widely. “I will become a true villain worthy of standing by you. The plot cannot progress without an obstinacy for the heroine to crush beneath her cute little heels, now can it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There were several things that Tom wanted to say at that moment, mainly about Harry’s mental stability, but the door to the parlor opened at that moment, a displeased Duke Potter storming in along with a panicked attendant. Tom quickly hid his shock with a mask of indifference, casually sipping at his tea as the duke walked briskly closer; it had gone disgustingly cold during Harry’s speech and he heated the liquid until it was just steaming with a stray thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Forgive me for the interruption, your highness,” Duke Potter said, not sounding sorry at all. “But my son and I must take our leave. Very important matter to attend to that might take a few weeks, best to get a start now, I’m sure you understand.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom eyed the parcels under the Duke’s arm before he smiled. “Sure, take care of that very important matter swiftly, so I can see Harry again soon.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right. Of course. Will do just that.” Duke Potter muttered, bowing to Tom before looking at Harry. “Harry, say goodbye to his highness so we can go home.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“See you later, Tom! We can talk more next time, I have so much to share!” Harry said happily, giving a quick curtsy before he caught up with his father, taking the man’s hand once he got close. Tom watched as the Duke practically dragged Harry out, the maid following hurriedly behind, and the door shutting loudly behind them. A silence fell over the room as the palace maids moved to clean up, no one wanting to speak after the speech Harry had just given.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No manners, talking about being able to predict the future, informal goodbye, and a complete disregard for the fact that you’re a prince. You certainly chose an interesting fiancé, Tom.” Nagini said, amusement coloring her tone as she grinned at Tom.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I guess he is. This would be a boring engagement if he wasn’t.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>*~*</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dinner for the royal family was always a quiet affair, no one daring to speak for fear of angering the king. Of course, there was always the tension between them all; it put the servants on edge, causing them to make more mistakes than they normally would, and the fear of repercussions for those mistakes making them even more prone to them— a vicious cycle, Tom would admit, but not one he was interested in fixing. The only one unfazed by the atmosphere was Nagini, who was standing at attention behind Tom as she always did, humming a tune just loud enough for Tom to hear as she amused herself by counting the number of tiles on the far wall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom could tell her lack of blinking was starting to unnerve the staff and he made a note to talk to her about keeping up the appearance of being fully human.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How are things going between you and your…betrothed?” The king finally asked after their second course had been served, his voice gravelly and showing his age. “His father requested an audience and it was…interesting, to say the least.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They are going excellent, Your Highness,” Tom said as respectfully as he could manage. His tone still came out strange and strained, tittering dangerously close to apathy, but the king didn’t notice. Morfin, Tom’s father and first prince of the nation, did and gritted his teeth; Tom was always allowed to get away with more than he would and Tom relished in that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Very good. And he is of a good pedigree, yes?” The king asked again and Tom suppressed a sigh, reaching to sip his wine. The king was unusually talkative tonight and it was starting to grate on Tom’s nerves. Morfin looked ready to boil with rage when Tom took a sip of his drink before addressing the king, so Tom supposed that was a small condolence for forced pleasantries.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We are people, not dogs, Your Highness,” Tom said lightly and Morfin gritted his teeth when the king laughed. “And I would say it’s very good. He certainly has the family…unique mental disposition.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The king nodded, satisfied. “Excellent, I was worried that the bloodline was too diluted at that point. I hear that there’s even Peverell mixed in.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“As much as there is Gaunt in it as well.” </span>
  <em>
    <span>which is suffice to say, not nearly enough to matter</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Tom thought to himself. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How can we be sure he even has our blood in him? The line goes back too far to really confirm. Why not the blond one instead?” Mofin spoke up, bitterness clear in his tone. “That one we can at least trace the bloodlines back to us. I would have chosen him.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, we all can’t be child predators, can we?” Tom asked and Morfin glared harder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, you’re a predator all right, you fucking little—”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Morfin.” The king hissed out, making the man in question flinch. “You will not speak to your son that way-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That brat is not my child and you are blind to think so!” Morfin spat before recoiling at the king’s glare. “Forgive me for my outburst, your Highness. I am merely speaking the truth.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“One dinner without your delusions would be wonderful,” Tom said, smiling as he swirled his glass. “Or is that too much to ask, father?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do not refer to me as such you little cretin. I should have strangled you when you were a child!” Morfin hissed, standing and slamming his hands on the table. Tom didn’t even flinch, taking another sip of his wine, and that seemed to only anger his uncle. “That crown on your head should have been mine! I’m the oldest, it’s my birthright. If you hadn’t come along, if my sister wasn’t a fucking whore-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Enough!” The king yelled, making all but Tom and Nagini flinch. “That is enough from you. Return to your chambers and don’t come out until tomorrow evening!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But, father-” Morfin began, cutting himself off at the glare he received. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Chambers! Now! I don’t want to look at you.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Morfin looked like he wanted to argue but simply huffed and stood, his chair scraping across the floor as he did so, and stormed out of the room. Tom watched him go, finally taking a bite of the steak that had been served and made a face. Medium-well, too cooked for his taste.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m retiring for the evening.” the king said, hobbling to his feet. He was far too old to be walking as much as he did, yet he still refused help. The temptation to raise the ground a little higher in front of him and watch him fall grew every day, but Tom resisted giving in. He was far too young to be king and didn’t have the network he would like set up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sleep well, Your Highness,” Tom said, hearing his mother echo the sentiment softly. It always surprised Tom when she chose to speak, seeing as she seemed to make herself smaller and unnoticeable her family was near, like she was afraid to be acknowledged by them. It was pathetic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“One dinner without a meltdown would be nice, don’t you agree, mother?” Tom asked, watching the woman across from his flinch at being addressed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I-I suppose.” The princess said, trembling in her seat, and Tom couldn’t bring himself to feel bad for her. She grew up in this, she should be used to it by now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Father is so unreasonable sometimes,” Tom said lightly, motioning for the maid to come closer before he addressed her. “Have them bring out dessert and send a plate to my dear father. It’s a shame for him to miss all of your hard work. And be sure he knows his </span>
  <em>

  </em>
  <span>son sent it.”</span>
