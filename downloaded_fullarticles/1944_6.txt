  <strong>The Chariot</strong>
</p><p>No one was too surprised when Olymer Khanna brought home a flying carpet from Brazil. He had connections in half the carpet and broom companies in the world,so naturally it was to be expected.</p><p>One day his niece Rowan decided to fly the carpet. Their house elf,Josie,was the only other one there,as everyone else was at Jordanhal celebrating Lee’s 5th birthday. What fun she had,whizzing over the immense lands owned by the Khannas. So much fun that her father never even punished her when he learned (a few years later) of her escapade.</p><p>Rowan never rode the carpet again. Why? Even she didn’t know. But as she confided to Charlie Weasley 12 years later,on their honeymoon night,”Some things just aren’t as fun as they seem.”</p>
