    <p>Draco sighs as he rolls over with a small groan. The boy looks around to see what the hell woke him up when the sun hasn't even fully risen yet. With a frown, he looks over at the bed across from his and sees the body of the boy in that bed convulsing on occasion. He mutters something that may have been "What the fuck?" but it's not fully understandable. As the aggressive sneezes fade, and a small whine comes from the body-shaped lump, he finally sits up to properly address this problem that woke him up. </p>
<p>   "Potter," he snaps, trying to keep his voice down for the sake of the other two boys they share the dorm room with, "what the fuck?"</p>
<p>   The only response is just a groan and the body curling up a bit more into a ball. </p>
<p>   “What are you, dying or something?”</p>
<p>   “Yes.” The voice is muffled, given that it looks like Potter’s face is covered in at least two blankets and a pillow.</p>
<p>   Draco snorts out a laugh. Sadly, he knows he’s not going to be able to get back to sleep, especially with Potter sniffling and shuffling around and sneezing every two goddamn seconds. Draco can’t quite decide yet if the other boy is being a drama queen or legitimately ill. I suppose I’ll find out in a while. He thinks to himself. With nothing better to do, and it still being much to early to be able to get breakfast, Draco heads to the showers. </p>
<p>   The boy has been through a literal war at this point, Draco rationalizes, a little cold definitely won’t be the death of him. It is strange though, how bad he feels for the boy, that is. It’s not like it’s Draco’s fault that Potter is sick, but he can’t help it. He catches himself trying to think of what he could do to help him, maybe take him down to Madam Pomfrey, or bring him up some soup or tea. Draco stops himself in the middle of washing his hair, mentally taking a step back. What the fuck is with you? He asks himself. Why are you so worried about this? It’s just a cold, the boy can take care of himself.</p>
<p>   Feeling refreshed and shaking out the unnecessary and strange concern for Potter, Draco is surprised to see him actually sitting up in bed. It causes Draco to stop in the doorway for a moment to take in the sight before him. Potter looks… not quite pathetic, but much like a mix of a corpse and a very upset, drenched cat. Honestly, it’s a miracle that Draco managed to contain his laughter to only a short exhale of breath and a small smirk. </p>
<p>   “Wow…” he drones, “you look like shit, Potter.” Unlike times in the past, his words have little venom to them, only amusement. Still, there is no response from Potter. The lack of retaliation, or even a reaction from him was actually starting to be worrisome, until Draco feels a pillow collide with the back of his head. </p>
<p>   Draco snaps his head up, a frown on his face, and a taunting insult on his lips, but pauses when he sees that the boy has gone back to his original position; curled up in a ball under his blankets. With a slightly amused sigh, Draco picks up his book bag in one hand, and the pillow in the other. He tosses the pillow, rather gently, back on top of where Potter’s head appears to be before leaving their room to head towards breakfast. He’s still incredibly early, but there are worse things to be than early.</p>
<p>   Like sick, for instance.</p>
