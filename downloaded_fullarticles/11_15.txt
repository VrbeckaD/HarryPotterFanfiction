    <p>Magic is not limitless, as with any other strength it should not last forever, not without recharging.</p><p>With this fact brings into the question of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft an Wizardry, a school that has been open for more that 1000 years, yet the magic inside has stood strong, never faltering, never waning and never needing to be recast. By any account these spells should have been weakened by the procession of time, yet here they last, just as strong as when the school first opened all those years ago. </p><p>There had been many different studies into the school. but no information could be found that explained the phenomenon. That information was known only to the founders who swore no to tell a soul of the tremendous power source that lay dormant in the heart of Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Hermione Granger,  Often called the brightest witch of her age, was sitting in the Griffindor common room finishing her most recent assignment for charms class when she groaned in frustration. </p><p>They had been assigned to write an essay on magical power sources, how certain spells will deplete ones energy more than others and how to identify when you were running out of energy. It was a useful topic especially in an emergency for one wrong spell at the wrong time could deplete your magic and leave you essentially defenceless. It also encouraged one to learn their own limit.</p><p>"But it doesn't make sense, no spell should last this long". The bushy haired girl Slammed shut her copy of 'Hogwarts; a History'. The text said that the magic powering the castle and the wards that protected the school was that of the old religion, a type of magic that has long since been lost to time. But that was all it said, nothing of the Power that fuelled the school for even spells of the old religion would wear down once the caster had died.</p><p> Hermione sighed, she had scoured the library already and found nothing on the subject. She would have to ask a teacher, maybe Professor Flitwick or Professor Binns may have more information, But it was too late now. Looking around she saw the common room was mostly empty now with most student having gone to bed for the night.</p><p>Sighing she collected up her books, walking up the staircase that led to the girls dormitory.</p>
