    <p> </p><p>Music simply made for this chapter: Blindfold by Sleeping Wolf.</p><p>It enraptured me. I recommend, highly so.</p><p> </p><p>Harry fidgeted by the slightly ajar door to the Room of Requirement.</p><p>He’d scurried out the common room as soon as he’d seen Malfoy’s dot move to there not five minutes earlier, going by the Gryffindor Tower, which was their unofficial cue for a meeting. They'd never discussed it, but they both knew the other knew.</p><p>Harry hadn’t thought of anything then - just taken his Invisibility Cloak, wand and ran off immediately, not minding about Ron probably seeing and the <em> look </em> Hermione had given him. He did, however, have a uncomfortable feeling about that look. But Hermione wouldn’t possibly know what he was doing, now could she? Definitely not. But then Harry thought to the conversation he’d had with her a few days ago, which was also the last time he’d seen Malfoy and that specific meeting was the reason he had been so surprised, so immensely happy and glad Malfoy had gone today to their room.</p><p>But now he couldn’t seem able to open a damn door - that was already open!</p><p>Harry rubbed his face and sighed.</p><p>That thing in the boy’s bathroom.. It hadn’t gone that well at all.</p><p>Harry wanted to snort and groan at the same time. He almost killing Malfoy was hardly a feat well done.</p><p>He could still feel the cold dread bite at his insides, squirm around, making the feeling at home. That feeling, that uncomfortable coldness, was partly the reason he’d done that <em>other</em> thing, too.</p><p>Harry wanted to groan again and perhaps bury himself underground, make himself unavailable, maybe then he’d stop doing stupid things.</p><p>Or he could go down to the Chamber of Secrets and rot there along with the Basilisk he'd actually killed - and no one would never find him there, him being the only parseltongue alive, if one didn't count Voldemort. But Harry doubted <em>he'd</em> go down to slimy tunnels just to kill some time.</p><p>That.. Harry suddenly thought, was quite a brilliant idea.</p><p>But then he deflated again.</p><p>He wouldn’t do that. He couldn’t.</p><p>He still had his lessons with Dumbledore and detentions with Snape. And a certain Dark Lord left to vanquish.</p><p>So no rotting in Slytherin Chambers.</p><p>His thoughts reeled back to Hermione’s horrified look when he told her of almost killing Malfoy. It wasn’t like her to be that worried about the blonde git, sure she was kind and wanted no harm done to anyone, but there had been something else, too, like she couldn’t believe Harry’d actually done that. Well, news flash, Harry couldn’t believe it himself either.</p><p>He pushed the door open with the power of feelings rising from his encounter with Hermione that day, she'd been adamant on Harry getting rid of his Potions book and for some reason, apologizing to Malfoy. Well, the latter he'd do with pleasure, once he got there.</p><p>It was the same old room, divan, fireplace and even that godforsaken poker there waiting for him to trip.</p><p>And Malfoy, sitting there like usual, watching the flames flicker and burn.</p><p>He turned when the door opened, silver eyes staring at him, unfathomable in their boundlessness.</p><p>“So you and Weaslette?” was his form of ‘hello’.</p><p>Harry flinched. Yeah, that <em>other</em> thing he’d done. He’d gone and kissed Ginny. While having this thing with Malfoy. Not one of his best moments.</p><p>“It was a spur of a moment thing, you know”, Harry mumbled and tousled his hair in annoyance.</p><p>He went closer, to stand right where he had that first time, watching Malfoy wanking, only to now watch Malfoy’s unreadable expression. Harry didn’t like it one bit. Was he mad or furious or sad or what? Just show it on your face like I do! he wanted to advise, but kept the words at bay.</p><p>“Are you okay?” he asked instead and looked down, biting his lip at the same time, too.</p><p>He was ashamed, anyone would be in his shoes right now, he knew.</p><p>When Malfoy didn’t answer, Harry chanced a look at him. The blonde was still staring at him with that same infuriating emptiness on his face. Harry could see the outline of a silvery scar on his pale skin and swallowed. <em> He’d done that to him </em> .</p><p>“I was of the impression you wouldn’t care”, the blonde said slowly, their eye contact never breaking off.</p><p>“I do!” Harry all but yelled, indignated, “I wasn’t the one who greeted me with a hex right from the get go! I even told you so then, before firing one of my own, but did you listen? No!”</p><p>His temper roared up at Malfoy all the time. Same with Malfoy’s, apparently. Otherwise their ‘little’ dueling in the bathroom would have never happened, really..</p><p>“Well I’m sorry I was a completely caught off guard and slightly out of my mind too! What did you expect me to do when I’m half expecting the Dark Lord to bounce on me for not finishing his task!” Malfoy snapped and reclined his back stiffly against the pillows, turning his eyes defiantly to the flames.</p><p>“So you’re alright?” Harry asked again, wanting relief to the coldness dancing in his veins in so similar fashion as the hot flames did in Malfoy’s eyes as they stared ahead, unseeing. Harry absentmindedly wondered would Malfoy’s touch warm him up like flames catching fire in their intensity.</p><p>He hoped they-</p><p>“I am”, Malfoy’s annoyed huff stopped his mind and their eyes locket again, “Are you sitting down or are you going to stand there all day?”</p><p>Harry obediently sat down.</p><p>A silence settled between them - both minds working on same and different topics, but neither wanting to voice them.</p><p>“I didn’t think you would come”, Malfoy finally stated quietly, looking to the flames again.</p><p>“Because of Ginny?” Harry asked bile rising in his throat. The blonde simply nodded.</p><p>“I’m here, though, not off kissing her”, Harry meant for it to be a joke, and maybe in some level it did what it was meant to do, when Malfoy’s eyes snapped to his and his lip rose into a nasty sneer.</p><p>Harry bristled, it had been a while since he’d last seen that one.</p><p>“Did she like your kiss, Potter, <em> Harry? </em> The one <em> I </em> taught you how to do?” a quiet and impossibly low voice asked and Harry felt lost in feelings so contradicting it hurt his mind to just think.</p><p>And he hadn’t thought, alright, not at all!</p><p>How could he know when all he’d wanted was for that frozen feeling lodged deep in his chest to melt, even momentarily. And Ginny was funny and fiesty and beautiful, no doubt, course he’d noticed! He’d be blind not to see, for God’s sake! And she wanted him. People wouldn’t mind them being together - okay, well Dean and Romilda might but who cared?</p><p>Harry and Draco on the other hand.. Few would give their consent, the first of them being <em>Voldemort, </em>who wanted to use them and then kill them.</p><p>“I’ve no idea”, Harry said quietly, “I wasn’t really thinking about her.”</p><p>Malfoy raised a sculpted eyebrow at that, clearly not expecting those words.</p><p>“What did you think of then, Potter? If not the pretty witch kissing you?” he asked and Harry noted a dark edge in it he’d come to familiarize himself with only here, in these moments in the eye of the storm they were alone with no one to judge, threaten, kill or laugh at them.</p><p>“I was cold”, Harry admitted quietly, “and she was burning. So I was a moth to a flame.”</p><p>He shrugged. There were two of them here, they’d have to work together for once, he reckoned.</p><p>“Why were you cold?” Malfoy’s voice was barely a whisper, Harry could taste the anxiety there, the want to have the answer that appealed to him.</p><p>“You were hurt”, Harry said, almost choking on the words, “And I’d done that. I’d almost..”</p><p>They both knew what he left unsaid. He’d almost killed Draco. If not for Snape and Myrtle. Harry wanted to thank them, but it would raise suspicion, so he did not.</p><p>Harry knew there was a desperate plea in his eyes as he looked into Malfoy’s silvery eyes but he couldn’t, wouldn’t, hide it. Not now. Draco sighed softly and a small smile crept onto his face before he grabbed Harry’s arm and tucked him flush against his body, eliciting a small yelp from Harry's lips in surprise.</p><p>“I get it now. I’m too fabulous for you so you went a bit mad and kissed a redhead”, he said a smirk in his voice and Harry laughed despite himself.</p><p>He also blushed. They’d never been like this before, laying side by side, one of Draco’s arms wrapped lightly around him and Harry's head resting on his shoulder. Because he was Draco now, too, when he did something like this. A warm tickle traveled from his heart upwards, melting the ice as it went. Harry felt warm for the first time in days.</p><p>“I don’t have to be mad to kiss a redhead”, Harry countered and laughed a bit again, “It’s called being a healthy teenage boy.”</p><p>Now Malfoy laughed despite himself and Harry smiled warmly at the sound. It would be okay now; they would be okay.</p><p>“Poor excuse, Potter - I don’t believe you”, he contradicted and tilted his chin to look at Harry with sparkling silvery eyes.</p><p>“Well alright, alright”, Harry laughed and looked to the flames now himself, “I think I might have liked her earlier this year, so it was almost natural when she has been so open with me this year. I know she’s liked me since forever, so it wasn’t about that either. And she’s free, you know? No need to hide. I guess I wanted to try something like that.”</p><p>"Earlier? As in past form? Quite a heartbreaker you are, Potter, to kiss girls you don't like anymore", Malfoy asked and poked him in the ribs, making Harry flinch.</p><p>"Well it's not my fault, y-" but he left it at. Because it was untrodden territory, something deeply forbidden to even as much as mention.</p><p>They fell silent and only lay there for many minutes, both minds definitely wandering to those foreign lands.</p><p>“And all we do is hide”, Malfoy finally stated resignedly.</p><p>“I get it, I do, hell I’d have to be daft not to. And.. I doubt we’ll have much time left.”</p><p>Harry became worried by that final statement.</p><p>“What do you mean? What do you mean by that!?” He asked frantically, raising up to stare at Malfoy, hard. He met his gaze but there was hurt there, dread and fear as well as resignation.</p><p>“You know what I mean”, he only said and closed his eyes, wanting to hide from the world for a while, his face turning to a pained mask.</p><p>“So you got it done, whatever you were doing” Harry flatly said.</p><p>“It was inevitable. Maybe now I’ll get to live a few months more, at least. <em> He </em> would have it done even without me, anyway.” Malfoy said and tried relaxing his tensed muscles.</p><p>“No more depressing talk. It feels like that’s what we only ever do nowadays”, he said then and brushed some blonde hair out of his eyes.</p><p>Harry tried pushing the uncomfortable feelings out of the way and smiled, the pain of this possibly being one of the last times they could have eating at his heart.</p><p>“Sure, who’d want depressing when you could have me?” he said laughingly and Draco smirked, pinching his cheek teasingly.</p><p>“The trouble that is Harry Potter, What a delectable thing, I could eat you up right now”, he said in a rare mood for soft bantering and proceeded to do just that, eating him up. Their lips met and softly tasted each other, much more fragile than they’d ever kissed. Harry opened his mouth willingly for once and he felt Draco shift a bit, surprised by it. He followed with the silent invitation  nonetheless and slipped his warm tongue in to meet Harry’s in a languid and eased battle from which they surfaced breathing raggedly.</p><p>“What’s with that Potter? You’re almost.. submissive..” Draco asked and lifted half lidded silvery eyes to search his green ones for answers.</p><p>Harry blushed, being asked that so bluntly. He took every bit of Gryffindor courage and said: “Maybe I am. Maybe I want you to take me.”</p><p>And his eyes met Draco’s burning with certainty. He knew that desire to be true. He wanted to have this moment between them. Draco searched his face silently for a while, rubbing Harry’s back while he did in lazy circles that brought warmth to Harry’s whole being.</p><p>“No”, he finally said with finality deeply edged into his voice. Harry blinked, baffled. That's not how this was supposed to go, but Draco's next words brought clarity that yes, this was how it would go.</p><p>“I can see what you’re doing there, Potter, you’re leaving me.” He said and Harry felt the earlier conviction slip away.</p><p>“I don’t take that well. So no. I’m not doing you”, Malfoy said and forced Harry to meet his strangely hard and almost angry gaze.</p><p>“Instead, I’ll leave you <em>empty</em>, pining after me even if you stay with that Weaslette. <strong><em>Always</em></strong> thinking how I’d feel inside of you.”</p><p>He kissed Harry, penetrating his mouth with his tongue like he owned it.</p><p>“Thinking how <em>good</em> I’d make you feel”, he gripped Harry’s arse tight, “because it <em> would </em> . I’d make you <em> scream </em> Potter.”</p><p>Another searing kiss on his lips and Harry wanted to cry for losing out on what Draco promised him, because only hearing it made him feel heavenly, panting with want and his erection seeping precum painfully.</p><p>“I’d make you <em>delirious</em> in ecstasy.”</p><p>was whispered softly into his ear and Harry met fragile silvery eyes staring deep into his.</p><p>“Make you <em>completely</em> enraptured in me”,</p><p>he said against his lips, never once breaking his eyes away.</p><p>“But I won’t”</p><p>he said and leaned back, hurt shining in the depths of silver,</p><p>“Not when you’re planning on leaving me. So we’ll just do what we always do.”</p><p>There was finality in that voice, one that wanted Harry to make it go away. So when Draco reached down to touch him, he pushed away, staring down at the blonde stubbornly.</p><p>“No”, he bit out.</p><p>Draco’s expression twitched.</p><p>“No?” he forced out.</p><p>“I don’t think you have much say in the matter, Potter. Not when we’ve been frotting the whole year and suddenly <em> she just comes and takes you away! </em> I don’t do well with that, Potter, didn’t I already say so?”</p><p>Malfoy all but growled before taking a strong hold of Harry.</p><p>“You’re my fucking normalcy Potter! Are you going to take that away from me, too?” the end was but a shaky whisper, so sad it tore at Harry’s heart.</p><p>“What else have I taken from you?” he asked, taking hold of those words, wanting to know, wanting this conversation to go on, because he knew now that it would be the last they’d have, perhaps for a long while.</p><p>“My reason. My sanity”, Draco stated like he was talking of food, not his mentality,</p><p>"Because why else would I still see you here, with <em> him </em> out there only waiting to delve into my thoughts brutally and finding about you, about what we’re doing. And then he’d kill me, or unreasonably use me to get you - but that would be stupid. Because you would never bare your feisty Gryffin fangs for me.”</p><p>His words channeled such certainty in what he’d said Harry had to fight of the feeling of trusting them without objections. Because he had objections. Important objecions.</p><p>“I would”, he admitted and rested his hand on Draco’s cheek, stilling the face that was about to hide away from him.</p><p>“I would bare my fangs for you.”</p><p>Draco stared into his green eyes like he didn’t believe him, silver eyes wide open in shock.</p><p>Harry kissed him on the lips and stated again: “I would.”</p><p>Draco still stared at him like his spirit left him, so Harry repeated it a few more times, to make him see, to make him understand Harry <em> would </em> do it for him. Kiss after kiss, promise after promise, until finally..</p><p>Finally Draco snapped out of it and stilled Harry’s mouth with his hands, Harry noted they trembled a little.</p><p>“Thank you”, the boy only said and looked so much younger than they were, so much more pure.</p><p>Harry cracked a smile so like him and said: “No problem.”</p><p>Draco’s lips curved at that, but they spoke no more, the only words between them that of touches. Caresses along their bodies, searching for something and never quite finding it. Kisses along the jaw, on earlobes and necks, marking as theirs with invisible labels that read their names, so no one would ever know, no one would ever hurt them.</p><p>And they frotted, like Draco had so severely named it such.</p><p>Feeling each others flesh against theirs and committing it to memory, so they could remember it for days past. Harry’s hands holding their twisting flesh, Draco’s outlining his, and switching again so they could touch something more, too.</p><p>They had no hurry now, only kisses, touches and time. Time to feel. Harry couldn’t even remember that cold feeling that had seeped into his bones, it was but a distant memory with Draco’s heat against him, encircling him in his arms, tugging closer until they almost were one and the same. But they never quite were. Because Draco kept hold of his words: he’d make Harry wait. And Harry punished him for that. With surprise bites and nicks that earned him gasps and swats to stop. He didn’t. He kept on giving them when Draco least expected it, his green eyes shining with pride at his own antics.</p><p>Draco’s silver eyes knitted, before Harry caught a small flicker of something that made his breath hitch and the sensations all the more potent.</p><p>There was a desperation to their hands, now, tightly grasping the other for a resemblance of an anchor. A fiery tug on their hearts trying to beat frantically for the other, so close while so far away.</p><p>"Same as always", Draco suddenly said and held Harry's head in his hands. His eyes searched something in Harry's.</p><p>"Same as always", Harry whispered and brought his face closer to Draco's, feeling long sleek fingers so finely framing his face, shyly he touched his nose to Draco's before lifting his eyes to meet his again.</p><p>Emotions left unsaid caught fire between green and silver, burning with a light so bright it almost made them blind. So many were the secrets between them, wanting to be told. But they both knew they could not do that, it wasn't for them, for this moment to uncover the unbound fragility within them. So they only touched, like they knew it all already, like it was to be ingrained in them by the mere memory of this touch of Draco against Harry, of Harry against Draco. So feverish they were, so desperate, yet so slowly it built, holding the time forcibly in their grasp before it all fell out, making the inevitable happen. For it had to come to and end. Nothing lasts forever, they knew.</p><p>And finally the ending came, as it always did, too early.</p><p>For a few minutes more they would have liked to taste each other, steal a couple more handfuls of flesh, but the unbending wave crashed over them and took them mercilessly within. Crashing and burning until they were a depleted mess on the divan, laying on top of each other.</p><p>Eyes closed, wanting to feel that emptiness and contradicting fulfillment for a bit more, tangled with each other.</p><p>“I’m sorry”, Draco whispered as the last warmth had subsided from the air around, only the fire to gift them bits and pieces of warmth.</p><p>Harry didn’t need to ask why he was apologized to.</p><p>He’d find it out sooner or later. He hoped to God it would be later.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shut his eyes tight and only listened; to Draco’s breathing next to his; he felt, how Draco’s chest went up and down, followed by those breaths he heard.</p><p> </p><p>He twined his fingers with the blondes and hoped, <em> prayed </em> that perhaps it would all come to be okay, that Fate was not fighting against them.</p><p> </p><p>Draco grasped Harry’s hand in his and didn’t let go until they went back to their respective beds, one up the other down, one light the other dark.</p><p> </p><p>Such a contradiction they were, such perfection in imperfection.</p><p> </p><p>Harry wouldn't know was that wish futile or not, not until it was time for the ending, or hopefully beginning.</p><p> </p><p>He could only hope, and keep on fighting.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Fighting till the end.</em>
