  <strong>[12 Grimmauld Place]</strong>
</p>
<p><br/>
Sunrays lit up the small room on the upper floor of Grimmauld Place 12. It was late August but the warmth of summer seemed yet to cling onto London and made sure that the last lights were enjoyed and savoured properly.<br/>
The rays landed on a sofa and a table with bowls, two old newspapers, books, several empty cups with coffee stains dried on the sides of them, photo’s of a man with dark brown hair and striking grey eyes, a tree wand and a pair of glasses placed on top of the heap. I pile of blankets rested on of the sofa. A coat hung messily on big maroon armchair and the same armchair a were laid book were placed; the title read <em>‘Albus Dumbledore: The greatest wizard of our time’</em> .<br/>
<br/>
Looking around, one would find that the room had been neat a long time ago. But today the room was untidy, with a large number of letters laying about. Most were unopened and all addressed to a <em>‘Miss Harry Potter, owner of Grimmauld Place 12’. </em></p>
<p>The few that were opened were from a selected few, mainly a <em>Ron Weasley </em>and<em> Hermione Granger</em>. The ones yet to be read were from a multitude of different institutions &amp; newspapers; The New Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet would not get an answer too soon from the receiving party of these letters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything was still and silent in the room, no, the entire house. Even the small house elf, Kreacher, didn’t seem to want to make a noise or disrupt the stillness.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly the pile of blankets moved and shifted slightly on the sofa. An arm emerged from under the heap and reached for the glasses on the table near the sofa.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A girl sat up, with a tired sigh and blinked multiple times. Her short, black hair had traces of sleep in it and she yawned loudly, which effectively put an end to the stillness of this late afternoon in August.<br/>
<br/>
She stood up and stretched, feeling how the bones in her back cracked at the movement.<br/>
“I really have to stop sleeping on the sofa” she mumbled to herself as she turned around and looked at the clock.<br/>
<em>‘Already afternoon uh’</em> she thought <em>‘I should make some kind of snack now that Kreacher is gone’</em><br/>
<br/>
The house elf were allowed to go on errands now and then, as a way to give him more freedom. Although Harry had tried to give the elf an article of clothes it had been refused. Kreacher seemed to had grown fond of her after the Battle of Hogwarts… for what reason she didn’t fully understood.<br/>
‘<em>Maybe he pities me?’</em> she thought dully as she walked to the kitchen. It was a strange thought but Kreacher had made sure to show her some kind of kindness and warmth at the strangest of times lately. After the battle, when all death were confirmed and Harry had to see Weasley mourn the passing of one of the twins, she had no time to rest and catch her breath before all manners of people were looking for her. They wanted to know more, get confirmation, find reason, look for guidance or just to talk to her.<br/>
<br/>
It had stressed her a lot before Shacklebolt approached her and almost ordered her to go to Grimmauld Place 12.<br/>
<br/>
“Since it is yours now” he had told her and chased away the most of papers and photographers. At that point Kreacher had made sure cover all windows, tidied the house and kept a respectful distance. Someone would maybe misinterpret the acts as avoidance but Harry knew better now. She knew so much better after one year in the house, with Kreacher preparing breakfast, tiding the messiest of the rooms and leaving things he found for her to look thought. The photos of Sirius were just one example, which almost had her crying after finding on her bed. Kreacher never mentioned it, only commented on it to be ‘<em>a waste of good tears on no-good-Sirius Black’ </em>(which was the closest he would ever get say <em>‘please stop crying’</em>).<br/>
<br/>
The eggs in the frying pan sizzled pleasantly and reminded Harry how hungry she was. She slept past lunch so naturally she would be hungry. After she had fried the eggs and almost burnt a toast she sat down and looked at the papers. She had read the first page but fallen asleep in the room upstairs as she found that most of the articles were pretty boring. News of the number of dark wizards and witches that had been sent to Azkaban, entries of Quidditch and a lot of gossips and rumours about Minerva MacGonagall as new Headmistress of Hogwarts.<br/>
<br/>
She eyed the titles lazily, turned another page and froze.</p>
<p>McGonagall stared straight at the camera with the same piercing eyes she always had since Harry’s first day at the school. The title were printed in huge, dramatic letters;<br/>
<strong><br/>
Headmistress of Hogwarts looking for guidance</strong>.</p>
<p><em>After months of silence from the newly appointed Headmistress of Hogwarts she spoke up on the matter of the school security. In an official letter to the students and worried guardians she welcomed them to a new school year. </em><br/>
“After last years tragic events and unauthorized usage of Dark Arts in the school it is more important than ever to give students a safe space for education and learning” the official message read. To the media she answered that she also wanted to make changes to the school that would help young wizards and witches to find support and confidence in one another.<br/>
“I will assure you that all staff at Hogwarts have taken precautions and helped to clean out any dark magic in the school for the upcoming year. We have also opened up a new position, a student counselor, and appointed it to a teacher with the intent to teach a subject to help the students process last years events. ”<br/>
She have not specified what precautions she spoke of but another source said she was “Looking forward to meet young Miss Potter again” and “to further discuss the matter and to look for guidance”</p>
<p>
  <em>….</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry didn’t have the energy to read the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to Hogwarts had been a harder decision to make than she first thought. Many memories still lingered. She didn’t know if she had properly processed her feelings or was well enough for education right now. She found out through letters that her friends had the same feelings. Ron’s family had suffered a lot and Hermoine had to reverse her parents after obliviating them. They had fears, nightmares and worries just as she had…<br/>
<em>‘I’m sorry I made you all suffer so much’</em> she thought grimly. She often apologized to them, in letters and in her mind. It was just still so fresh, so incredibly heavy that she couldn’t handle it…<br/>
<br/>
Tears threatened to find their way to her eyes but she fought back.<br/>
She had cried enough.<br/>
… God how she wished her parents, Sirius or Lupin were here.<br/>
But they were all gone now.</p>
<p><br/>
She breathed in and out evenly to maintain control of her feelings and closed her eyes, focused on what was before her.<br/>
<br/>
When she opened them again she found that her eyes met with the intense gaze of Headmistress McGonagall.<br/>
She stared silently back at the older woman. Even if it was just an photo of the woman, she felt like the first time she saw the animagus; old eyes that had seen a lot and would see a lot. McGonagall was striving forward towards the future, seemingly unfazed by the critique and loud voices around her. The older witch was, in every sense of the word, strong.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Master?”<br/>
Harry jumped at the voice and breathed out.</p>
<p>“Merlin’s beard, Kreacher!” she half-shouted at the house elf.<br/>
He looked at her with her usual glaring eyes.<br/>
“Master is reading the papers again” he commented and walked closer to her, to the opposite side of the table she sat at. Harry looked down at the paper and sighed.<br/>
“Just a little, but it wasn’t interesting”<br/>
“Then, maybe Master have more interest in reading this” he said and a letter levitated towards her. She took it and eyed it from both sides. There were no name from the sender and no symbols indicating from were it was.<br/>
“How do you know that the letter is for me, there are no name or address on it?”<br/>
<br/>
Kreacher was already on his way out from the kitchen when he answered.<br/>
“Kreacher received it from a great person to whom Master should listen to” he said and walked out.<br/>
<br/>
At the last comment, Harry was now alone with this lone letter without a name. She stared at it for a moment and hesitantly looked at it.<br/>
Somehow she could already feel who this <em>‘great person was’</em>.<br/>
<br/>
She glanced at the photo of McGonagall one last time before she opened and read the letter.</p>
