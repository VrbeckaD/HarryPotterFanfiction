    <p>On Valentine's Day 1995,</p><p>I was in my dorm room brewing a special love potion to make my long time crush Severus Snape fall for me.</p><p>I knew he wouldn't love me any other way.</p><p>I was planning to put it in a card to him. I knew he wouldn't drink it unless I snuck it into his goblet. So I put in perfume form.</p><p>I stuck a photo of me inside the card and the perfume containing the potion as well would be blown in a kiss from a moving picture of me to him.</p><p>I went to the dungeons and placed it underneath his classroom door. Then I went back to my room and to bed.</p>
