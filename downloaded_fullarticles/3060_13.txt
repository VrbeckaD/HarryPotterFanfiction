          <div class="userstuff"><p>London is…cold.</p><p>Cold in a way that makes him shiver, even though he’s bundled beneath a heavy coat that falls to his feet, even though his boots are heavy with a fluffy sort of fabric that’s just as warm as it looks.</p><p>Cold in a way that makes him feel numb all over, in a way that makes him notice things—the way people huddle together in groups of two or three, laughing as they brush past him, unnoticing, completely ignorant of his presence, as if he’s just a ghost.</p><p>“Pardon me,” says a passing stranger, and he blinks, gazing focusing, attention sharpening.</p><p>He’s standing in the middle of the sidewalk, still as a statue, and the kind stranger isn’t the only one swerving to avoid him. His cheeks burn as he starts walking, hands shoved in his pockets, eyes cast down at the cold gray cement.</p><p>“Sorry,” he calls over his shoulder, but the stranger is gone.</p><p>Credence looks forward, to where the city stretches up to meet the sky, and walks on.</p></div>
