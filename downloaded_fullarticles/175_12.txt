  <strong>Politics and Purebloods</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>27 December 1913; Gringotts, London Magical District, Wizarding Great Britain</em>
</p><p>“Greetings, Grythorn, may your gold always flow.”  Hadrian “Harry” Peverell; Lord of House Peverell, former Boy-Who-Lived, Man-Who-Conquered, and schmuck of a time-traveler extraordinaire, greeted one of three beings in the whole of the world – wizarding or mundane – who knew of his status and the method behind the madness of his presence in the past.</p><p>Harry, six months and six days prior, had made the unfortunate – <em>rookie</em> – mistake of reaching out to steady himself when an explosion caused a bit of a tremble in the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>Only, rather than an innocuous, inert, dust-catcher in Head Unspeakable Croaker’s office, it had been one of the rare artefacts known as Nimue’s Tears.</p><p>An artefact which was well-known in certain circles for transporting individuals it found “worthy” to a time and place where they had a living soulmate.</p><p>Those chosen by the Tears were always markless and <em>always</em> had an impact on both the time and place from whence they came as well as the one to which they were transported.</p><p>In Harry’s case, he was transported back eighty-five years in his own original timeline, to the summer of 1913, a year before the beginning of the Great War, and immediately upon his arrival found himself marked with not just one but <em>two</em> soulmarks.</p><p>As had, it must be noted, his infant godson Teddy Lupin who’d been resting in his baby sling on Harry’s chest when he’d touched the Tear, being gifted with a soulmark upon his right palm in the form of a raven within moments of arriving in the past in the time-travel version of side-along apparation.</p><p>Almost no time at all it seemed passed before the boy Harry had chosen to rescue from a terrible fate, one Credence Barebone, turned Aurelius Credence Peverell when Harry blood-adopted the abused young wizard, had proven with a single touch of skin-on-skin to be Teddy’s soulmate, his own wolf mark on his right palm blooming in a Recognition Bond.</p><p>Together with Grythorn and two Unspeakables – the Head Unspeakable of this era one Isla Black-Hitchens and one of her minions an Unspeakable “Jones” real identity unknown – Harry had carved out and crafted a new life for himself in the past along with his adopted son Teddy and his blood-adopted brother Credence.</p><p>They lived and studied and played and laughed at both the Department of Mysteries and Hogwarts, Harry choosing to return to the school despite being two years older than the other sixth years rather than miss out on much-needed education opportunities, as well as the need to take the measure of a few specific personages currently ensconced at the school, all the while Harry’s seats on the Lords’ Moot, Wizengamot, and the Hogwarts Board of Governors were overseen by his proxy – and once-upon-a-time great-grandfather – Henry Potter.</p><p>Grythorn handled Harry’s business interests along with the law wizard they’d hired, the Honorable Diocletian Bones - a younger son of House Bones, and now that he was on break from school, they were able to have a meeting together somewhere <em>other</em> than a rented room at the Three Broomsticks.</p><p>Which worked, after a fashion, but was hardly ideal with how many irons Harry had in the fire.</p><p>“Greetings, Lord Peverell, and may your enemies tremble.”  Grythorn shot a fang-filled smile at the intriguing wizard he had ended up the account manager for due to the secrecy required when handling a permanently displaced time-traveler.</p><p>“Oh, if only the things I’m fighting were the sort to tremble.”  Harry snorted softly.  “But how does one make prejudice fear, abuse quake, and destruction tremble?  Regardless,” he waved that maudlin thought off.  “Have the renovations on the Peverellshire and southern France estates been completed?”</p><p>Even if a last-minute brainstorm on Harry’s part had completely altered the form the renovations on Peverell Manor in Peverellshire were to take, he was filled with confidence on the goblins’ ability to oblige him, though there was no <em>real</em> rush on that particular pet-project of his.</p><p>There were a dozen – or more – licenses, permits, and even an official Charter or two in the offing that needed acquiring before he could do more than <em>think</em> about his plans for the Tudor-style manor that he would never live in when Peverell Castle in Wales was so much more comforting and hospitable due to centuries of occupation by Peverells, even if the location was far less fashionable than the Manor with its location in the unplottable magical county of Peverellshire attached to it and sandwiched between Oxfordshire and Wiltshire.</p><p>As it would take centuries of breeding like rabbits – or him adopting himself a <em>lot</em> of siblings, cousins, and/or children – to <em>need</em> a secondary house as large as the Manor on top of the even-bigger Castle and the not-as-big but still-solid Keep in France, he felt more than comfortable refurbishing the Manor with an eye towards a different sort of purpose altogether.</p><p>“They have,” Grythorn nodded.  “The full summaries of charges will be included in your end-of-year quarterly statements.  The partnership agreement with Obscurus Books has also been completed and the rights to publishing the latest edition of the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> under the Obscurus imprint as <em>A Collection of Non-Magical Knowledge, 1911</em>, have been obtained along with the additional biography on one,” Grythorn consulted his notes.  The insistence Lord Peverell had had on this one change as well as a foreword noting extreme bias regarding race, religion, or gender in some articles hadn’t made much sense to him.  But he was a goblin and hardly concerned with how wizards, let alone muggles, slandered and denigrated their own.  “Madam Marie Curie has been obtained and verified to be from a reputable source.  The rights to the text <em>Grey’s Anatomy </em>have been obtained as well with Obscurus being granted use of your indexing system patented for <em>Enchantments by Peverell</em> for both muggle works.”</p><p>Harry nodded, pleased.</p><p>It had been a vague idea in the beginning, starting to import and if necessary rebrand muggle works like the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> and <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> along with dictionaries and thesauruses and other reference works in particular plus certain types of muggle fiction that wouldn’t be <em>too</em> scandalous for even the staunchest of purebloods to read.  One spawned by Isla having to send one of her minions – <em>they’re the finest researchers in the Ministry, Harry, hardly <u>minions</u>, </em>she always protested – on a lengthy trip into muggle London to get copies of the two to either help bring Harry up to speed on muggle 1913 – the Britannica volumes – or for his healing elective at Hogwarts since <em>Grey’s</em> was still the premier text on human anatomy whether magical or muggle no matter how loath purebloods would be to admit it.  It was such a hassle, even for muggleborn students, to obtain reference texts from the muggle world at times that bringing them over had seemed like an understandable next step to Harry.</p><p>That those same texts – if read and understood by the right people – would start showing just how <em>far</em> muggles had come in a short amount of time, how dangerous their weapons were becoming, and so on was a side benefit of a sound business decision.</p><p>At least that’s how he sold it to his new partner Augustus Worme of Obscurus Books.</p><p>For the most part Harry intended to be a silent partner, much like he’d been for WWW, with an idea tossed at Gus every now and again spurred by his knowledge of the future and what he believed the wizarding world needed to know.</p><p>If even a <em>fraction</em> of Wizarding Great Britain’s population were exposed to the knowledge that the muggle world has accumulated – in some areas far outstripping the understanding of the magical world – it would make other objectives that Harry held close to the chest regarding the future easier to accomplish.  That they would at least pretend interest due to the new indexing system - a play on linked webpages from the future, allowing a person to "jump" to the required page via the embedded charms or search with a query via quill on the requisite page he'd worked out then promptly patented was a bonus.  Nothing the upper crust hated more than being left behind, and if some grand-dame can't gossip with her fellow nosy old biddies over his system - whether in favor or against it - because of the content it was currently being used on then there would be literal hell to pay for whoever stopped them.</p><p><em>Enchantments by Peverell</em>, Isla’s idea and maneuvering, more than took up the majority of his time not spent on schoolwork or with his brother and son, not leaving him much to spend on other ventures.</p><p>That Gus had jumped all over the idea, smelling galleons in the air, along with that of putting together a wizarding version of the<em> Britannica </em>as a counterpart…well, all to the better.</p><p>Stagnation in the wizarding world was one of the enemies Harry was determined to battle right alongside their age-old prejudices, lack of understanding regarding the dire threat muggles were to both them and the world at large, and doing everything he could to make damn <em>sure</em> that there never was another Credence Barebone, Tom Riddle, Severus Snape, Sirius Black, or Harry Potter left in the hands of abusive as <em>hell</em> guardians hellbent on destroying them or humbling them or beating them down by any means necessary.</p><p>Harry knew that everything he’d chosen to battle, every problem he’d personally felt the lash of eighty years down the line, were not issues he was going to be able to battle on his own and may not see the end of in his lifetime.</p><p>But he could try.</p><p>Whether trying meant <em>literally</em> kidnapping Credence away from his abusive bitch of an adoptive mother and then blood-adopting him <em>himself</em>, championing anti-abuse and exploitation laws that included making it <em>illegal</em> to place a magical child with muggle guardians not their birth parents <em>for any reason</em>, or doing everything he could to pound into the collective heads of the wizarding world that their prejudice was getting them nowhere but alienating a large portion of their society and creating more and more muggleborns with every generations as squibs and muggleborns alike fled into the muggle world, he’d do it.</p><p>Might feel like screaming into a void or beating his head against a marble pillar, but he’d still do it.</p><p>He’d signed up to change the future from the options presented to him when he’d been tossed arse over teakettle back into the past.</p><p>Saving Credence and changing his <em>individual</em> future was only the beginning.</p><p>And, honestly, compared to taking on the institution that was pureblood politics and prejudice, opting to raise and mentor a hormonal alpha preteen with eleven years of abuse under the lash of Mary Lou Barebone would be a walk in the park.</p><p>Harry had never actually <em>done</em> the pureblood political dance, let alone on the level of manners, tradition, and unspoken <em>rules</em> that loomed over everything to do with the wizarding <em>ton</em>, especially as the <em>ton</em> decided more to do with public policy in most ballrooms and formal dinners than ever occurred within the halls of the Wizengamot.</p><p>He had never treaded in the shark-infested waters muddied by generations of feuds, alliances, and unspoken creeds that made up the upper echelons of wizarding society.</p><p>Thanks partly to Isla and partly to his own family and heritage, he’d gotten a taste of it over the summer at the affair that was the Black-Potter wedding (<em>always</em> the Black-Potter wedding, never the other way around he’d been educated, as the more powerful house and/or name <em>always</em> was to come first) with Isla still half-guiding him through from the safety of her positions as his supposed godmother and him a newcomer to Wizarding Great Britain – supposedly – despite the ancient name and house he’d claimed after being dumped backwards in time.</p><p>His story got more than a bit of side-eyeing as it was due to his accent, which was waved away as him simply having a skill with languages.</p><p>Thank Merlin that once they heard him speaking Parseltongue to Eris, his quetzal familiar, most people had quickly lost interest in what his actual origins may or may not have been.</p><p>Gringotts accepted it as true, the Blacks and the Potters – thanks to Isla’s intercession on his behalf – accepted it as true, the Princes and Malfoys due to their connection with the Potters accepted it as true, and that he spoke Parseltongue made arguing his connection to Slytherin at least impossible.</p><p>As the Peverells were the most famous of the families known to have had Slytherin descendants marry in, trying to say he wasn’t a Peverell was likewise difficult.</p><p>Not that it hadn’t been said, it just hadn’t gotten anyone anywhere, especially as more respectable families weren’t about to be grouped in with the ravings of Marvolo Gaunt who took Harry’s claim of House Peverell with extreme vehement disgust over his “audacious lies.”</p><p>Given that despite his old bloodline Marvolo Gaunt was considered little more than the rudest of scruffs not a member of the <em>ton</em> like Harry, he hadn’t actually gotten himself anything but extra helpings of disdain for his ravings.</p><p>With the New Year Ball rapidly approaching, his safety net of being under Isla’s wing was going to be diminished, as there was a certain <em>expectation</em> that came with his NEWT success in several subjects and his owning of <em>Enchantments by Peverell</em>, as well as being a father to Teddy and a brother/guardian to Credence, he was by almost all measures considered a mature adult omega save for his continuing education at Hogwarts among younger students.</p><p>Home-education was still a noted and accepted path for education, especially as the eleven main schools of the wizarding world are different variations on prohibitively expensive with only a handful – if that – of scholarships on offer.</p><p>Except, that was, for muggleborns who had their tuition waved as part of the scheme to get them embedded in the wizarding world and away from the muggle one where they might – <em>did</em> – pose a massive security risk to the Statute of Secrecy, just one of the <em>many</em> issues some purebloods had with muggleborns and the rising amount of them every single year albeit in some areas and countries more than in others.</p><p>Places that treated squibs with decency and respect for their magical skills – as the only thing they actually <em>lacked</em> was the ability to use a wand, their magical core for whatever reason not complementary towards wanded magics – had a much <em>smaller</em> incoming pool of muggleborns every year, as more of their population actually <em>stayed</em> in the magical world instead of venturing out to make lives among the muggles.</p><p>Harry was <em>not</em> looking forward to the fight that getting squibs decent treatment and respect among most of the European wizarding countries would become, but he knew without a shadow of a doubt it was needed.</p><p>Hence having to play the political game and dance the pureblooded dance.</p><p>That he had no intention of settling for a political marriage to an “appropriate” spouse wasn’t going to endear him to anyone, especially as he also wasn’t planning on trying to find his soulmates at the moment.</p><p>He was far too damaged.</p><p>Had too many nightmares or sleepless nights, too many moments of paranoia or raw, unwarranted terror to try and fit not one but <em>two</em> soulmates into his life.</p><p>Acting somewhat normal for Credence and Teddy took far too much out him some days for him to try and shoehorn another person into all of their lives, and that was before he considered that Credence was dealing with a lot of the same issues…except for the murder thing.</p><p>No, that was on Harry’s conscience alone, thank Merlin, Credence’s rage and suppressed magic never having gotten that far thanks to him rescuing the powerful young wizard before his magic truly started to twist in on itself and lash out.</p><p>There just weren’t enough hours in the day to add another person Harry was supposed to give a fuck about into his life.</p><p>Making friends with his “cousins” Atticus – who he and most called Atty – Charlus, and the surprising addition of one shy, sweet Newton Artemis Scamander was honestly a shock to his system with everything else he had going on.</p><p>That Charlus’s burgeoning friendship was accomplished almost solely on a visit or two over the summer and correspondence via owl certainly helped, as well as Atty being quite occupied most of the time with Head Boy duties or his other friends as they were in different years.</p><p>No, it was his friendship with Newt that was the most surprising as with Charlus and Atty at least there was a bit of expectation on all parts that being of a similar age and related that they were at worst cordial.</p><p>And, fuck, did Severus Snape being the poor cast-off relation of the Potter line make entirely too much sense in just about every way.</p><p>Though that whole thing still puzzled him.</p><p>Atty was a genial sort for the most part.  Intelligent, a bit cutting at times perhaps but – <em>Slytherin</em> – so a certain amount of that was expected.  Wicked dueler, decent brewer, skilled with the mental arts.</p><p>How Atty went from, well, <em>Atty</em> to the wanker who tried to arrange his daughter into such a miserable marriage that running away with a <em>muggle</em>, let alone wastrel Tobias Snape was preferable he couldn’t even <em>begin</em> to understand.</p><p>People changed, he knew, and fifty years – maybe forty-five? – could certainly manage turning a pleasant teenager with a sardonic sense of humor into a bitter arsehole of a blood purist but…<em>still</em>.</p><p>He was missing something.</p><p>Or, more likely, the turning point in Atty’s life and attitude hadn’t come yet.</p><p>At least his friends would be at the New Year Ball – all of them but Newt who would likely be ringing in the year with preening his mum’s hippogriffs or some other creature-related endeavor – and he wouldn’t be there alone.</p><p>Were Newt an omega or an of-age alpha, he likely wouldn’t get away with skipping the event.  Fortunately, he was still a couple of months off of the latter and would never be the former so the number of fancy affairs he had to attend due to his status as a gentleman alpha with noble connections through his mother was still limited.  The clock was quickly running out on that, however, and soon his gentle friend would have to face down the sharks of the <em>ton</em> right alongside Harry if not be as fervently sought-after.</p><p>Though at least they weren’t muggles.</p><p>If he remembered his history correctly, had either of them be a muggle of similar birth, breeding, and such, having an occupation would be heavily frowned-upon for Newt (especially one outside of teaching, healing, research, or the aurors) and out of the question for Harry.</p><p>Thank Merlin, Mordred, and Morgana that <em>that</em> facet of muggle life had never made its way into magical society, if he had to pretend to be a vapid arm-ornamentation for some big strong alpha, Harry would hex someone blind or go completely spare in less than a day.</p><p>He might want to have a bit <em>less</em> occupying him in his life, but that didn’t mean he wanted the option to engage in business – or as muggles would’ve put it “dirty trade” – or manage his landholdings directly rather than through a secretary or steward taken away from him due to the circumstances of his birth and dynamic either.</p><p>“Have the specialty greenhouses been completed at Peverell Castle?” </p><p>You’d think he’d know the answer to that given that he <em>lived there</em>, the castle with its warm stone, stained glass, and wooden floors over the original flagstones in the family wing being by far the most comfortable of his three properties in his opinion, but you’d be wrong.  The greenhouses were being raised and warded at the far edge of the castle grounds, right by the village proper of Godric’s Hollow, and were being completed entirely with a combination of goblin and house elf workers.  He honestly had no <em>clue</em> how the progress was going, any more than he knew what to do with half the contents of his vault layered with so many preservation charms he was willing to bet he could leave raw meat just laying out and it wouldn’t go bad for a century or more, and that was in the open <em>air</em> of the vault, not even in one of the further-warded cubbies or containers.</p><p>“It has, and your law wizard has been instructed to accept applications and vet herbologists to find someone to oversee them as your house elves will be able to maintain plants within them but will still need direction for some of the more finicky samples in the preservation vault to be successfully cultivated.”  Grythorn informed him.</p><p>Harry held in a snort.</p><p><em>Finicky</em>.</p><p>That was an understatement if he’d ever heard one.</p><p>Some of those plants had been considered extinct for a century or more, including one that he was relatively certain had been so effective at preventing pregnancy that it had gone extinct in the muggle world back in the era of Ancient Greece and only been extant thereafter for thousands of years in the wizarding world before the last crop of it was destroyed in the Fire of London thanks to shoddy anti-fire warding on a cultivator’s fields.</p><p>“And the production lines at <em>Enchantments?</em>”  Harry asked.  “How are they working out?  Are they keeping up with production and maintaining quality standards or should we revisit the process?”</p><p>As those production lines were his <em>babies</em>, and the backbone of the argument he was going to make to the Wizengamot, Lords’ Moot, and both the ICW and IAN if necessary to improve treatment of squibs in the wizarding world, there better <em>not</em> be problems.</p><p>Squibs were perfectly capable of the rune-work necessary to produce most of his wooden line of safety charms, as long as they were produced using naturally-powered runic circles utilizing the cycles of sun or moon (or from a nearby power-node, which was why he’d put the offices of <em>Enchantments</em> where he had in Godric’s Hollow in an off-street instead of on the main square) instead of relying on wandwork to power them.</p><p>There were some other enchanted items he was in the middle of developing that might not work in such a way to use his squib workers to craft them, but one in particular could use a Potion instead of a wound-cleansing charm so would still be viable for squibs to produce as potions were another area that didn’t require wanded magic.</p><p>Granted, in both runes and potions there were wanded spells that might make a few things <em>easier</em> like timer and temperature control charms for potions and using an empowerment charm instead of a runic circle (or a ritual or blood magic) to power runes, but they didn’t <em>need</em> wanded magic to function.</p><p>Just a magical core.</p><p>“Interest has risen sharply in the safety charms line since one worn by young Fleamont Potter,” Harry’s former grandfather who at this point was all of a whopping three years old.  “Easily absorbed a misfired hex which might have severely impacted his fertility.”  Grythorn, well aware of Harry’s connection to the Potter family and Fleamont in particular, gave a sharp-toothed grin.  He <em>did</em> enjoy when – rare as the moments were – Harry’s meddling with things, intentionally or otherwise, slapped him in the face with consequences.  His client hadn’t – yet – perfected the pureblood mask that would keep such entertaining expressions secret later in his life.  “The lines for the basic <em>Protego</em> shields,” which like many shields only protected against spellwork.  “And the anti-object charms,” which were a shield Harry was still perfecting to work against shrapnel but what they <em>could</em> do at the moment stood up against everything except the speed of a bullet or shards flung about by an explosion…or in the future something like a speeding car or train, not really something he needed to worry <em>too</em> much about at present.  “In particular are popular, which projections on the anti-transport charms,” which would prevent transportation of someone by apparation or portkey, “are high should they be able to be altered to allow a parent or certain magical signatures to be keyed into an exception on the charm.  All in all,” Grythorn knew better than to <em>push</em>, no matter how much that avenue of flowing gold being inhibited by his client’s schedule <em>irked</em> him.  “<em>Enchantments by Peverell</em> is on track to be actually profitable and not operating in the red or breaking even in less than a year.”</p><p>More than, depending on how soon wizards deign to involve themselves in the war his client warned was coming, and whether the enchanted items his client was producing solely to help with life-saving efforts during said war were accepted by the wizards and witches who would be going to fight or otherwise assist the muggles with their senseless slaughtering of each other.</p><p>Goblins were warlike creatures and even <em>they</em> could hardly fathom the sort of casualties his client’s memories and reports spoke of were coming.</p><p>Let alone that a war that might come after it that was significantly worse when it came to the numbered dead.</p><p>If the various Ministries could be convinced to purchase the items his client was designing and equip their people with them, it would save lives of that Grythorn was certain.</p><p>It was convincing them that such items were <em>necessary</em> when they had <em>wands</em> and were smug in their own superiority over muggle weapons that would be the rub.</p><p>The patents Law Wizard Bones was certainly earning his contract fee – along with carrying out other duties for Peverell’s holdings, such as vetting an herbologist for his greenhouses – between his client’s ever-growing and evolving understanding of enchantments and layering various forms of magic to create them, as well as his spell repertoire that was <em>considerable</em> and included more than a few things Grythorn had never seen the like of before.</p><p>Which was at it should be.</p><p>If a time-traveler from the future didn’t know of magics that weren’t yet in use in the past, the future would seem a dull and bleak thing indeed.</p><p>Though if Grythorn wondered over what drove Lord Peverell to patent some things and not others, to use some charms in private but never in public, or easily put together potions that weren’t yet in existence but only for his personal use, that wasn’t anyone’s affair but his own.</p><p>Everyone had secrets.</p><p>Harry Peverell’s were simply greater and more dangerous than most.</p><p>“Excellent,” Harry said, hearing what Grythorn wasn’t saying about some of his inventions – and they <em>were</em> his even if some of the charms, spellwork, and so on weren’t, the laws were quite clear about what made an enchanted item or new spell or potion patentable and what didn’t – regarding the coming war and the gold to be had from them.  If he had it his way, he’d provide the shield-bracelets he was still perfecting for free to every witch or wizard who went off to the Continent or the territorial holdings during the Great War, let alone the enchanted bandages.  But people, especially wizarding people, were easy to predict.</p><p>If he gave away his work, they’d wonder what was wrong with it and be leery to trust it.</p><p>And <em>that</em> he couldn’t have.</p><p>Bandages with embedded wound-cleaning spells or potions, let alone ones with powerful healing charms like <em>vulnera sanentur</em> were only useful if they were actually <em>used</em>, and that was before he got into the ones with the muggle perception filters on them that he’d designed both for use on magical people embedded with muggle troops – if that still happened this time around – as well as for use on muggle soldiers to clean and moderately heal wounds and convince muggles that they weren’t as severe as they might’ve looked.</p><p>The shields were an idea that he would have plenty of time to perfect later after the war if it came down to it and he couldn’t get them finalized and tested and patented before things began.</p><p>His bandages were his babies when it came to life-saving – which, really, knowing he couldn’t prevent what was coming had become his entire focus when it came to the oncoming war.</p><p>Yes, if they were approved and used they would shoot him up into the ranks of wealth like the Blacks and Malfoys – what Grythorn was focusing on.</p><p>All Harry cared about was making sure as many people survived what was coming more or less physically intact as possible.</p><p>Everything else was in the hands of fate, magic, or the gods depending on what one believed.</p><p>With all the shit Harry’s slogged through, he wasn’t willing to bank on <em>any</em> hands having things under control in the chaos that was life in the wizarding world.</p><p>No, <em>that</em> was all politics and purebloods – the same as it’d been for a thousand years.</p>
