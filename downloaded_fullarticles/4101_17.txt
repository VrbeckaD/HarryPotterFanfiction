    <p> </p><p>Dumbledore goes to Godric's Hallow, that fateful night, instead of Severus. Severus is delayed by murdering Peter Pettigrew for betraying Lily.</p><p>This sequence of events changes everything.</p><p>Voldemort is there, waiting for Dumbledore. He does not kill Harry, not yet. Voldemort and Dumbledore duel.</p><p>Dumbledore kills Voldemort, as much as one can kill a wizard with as many horcruxes.</p><p>And Voldemort kills Dumbledore. It's a much more permanent affair.</p><p> </p><p>Without his loyal servant, the Dark Lord is much slower to rise again.</p><p>Without Dumbledore, corruption of the wizarding world is slow, but just as sinister and hard to get rid of, like a bloodstain that grows mold, resurfacing with a vengeance every summer.</p><p>Severus cries over Lily's body. When he finishes, he places Lily next to the man she loved, and takes their son.</p><p>--</p><p>A few hours later, he and Minerva are standing on the driveway of Number 4 Privet Drive. For some reason, Harry is sleeping in his arms, and Severus is strangely reluctant to give up the heavy weight on his shoulder.</p><p>"We must," Minerva insists. "The instructions Albus left—"</p><p>She sniffs and dabs her eyes with a handkerchief.</p><p>"Petunia is ill-fit to be a mother, let alone to Lily's son," Severus protests.</p><p>He doesn't know why he is against this plan, but something about all of this feels very wrong to him.</p><p>Minerva swallows.</p><p>Severus notes with dread that she does not contradict him, and for an instant, his grip on the child tightens. He forces himself to loosen it.</p><p>"Surely, Black could—"</p><p>Minerva shakes her head. "We can't find him. We think that Peter killed him, too."</p><p>She gives a sad hiccup at this, and has to steady herself.</p><p>Eventually, she pulls Harry out of Severus' white fingers.</p><p>She puts Harry in a basket, and leaves him on the front stoop of the Dursley's house.</p><p> </p><p>"The magic, Severus, will protect him, no matter how..."</p><p> </p><p>"..how unloved he may be."</p>
