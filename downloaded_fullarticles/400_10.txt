    <p>Hermione Granger sighed, rubbing her throbbing temples. If she had to listen to one more death eater tell “his side” of the story, she was going to strangle someone. Hermione was tired. In the two months immediately following what the wizarding world was now calling “the final battle,” The Order of the Phoenix began to convene with the Ministry, interviewing death eaters and setting up trials for those involved with Voldemort. On the days Hermione wasn’t at the Ministry, she was spending countless hours back at Hogwarts, doing everything she could to banish the nightmares and restore the castle to its former glory. The truth was that Hermione was simply working herself to the point of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Testifying had been its own draining process. Hermione had stood witness in nearly ten trials, for one reason or another. The most memorable had been the first, the Malfoy trial. The ministry had wanted to convict the Malfoys, but Harry Potter has insisted they be given another chance. Initially, Hermione had been shocked and angry with her friend, but after reflecting on their circumstances, it turned out that she agreed. The witch lost track of the interrogation going on in front of her, lost in a memory…</p>
<p>“Miss Granger, please tell us about your experiences with Mr. Draco Malfoy during your school years.” Hermione was already annoyed with the way that Undersecretary Kellner had been questioning her.</p>
<p>“To be honest, sir, I didn’t have that many encounters with Draco Malfoy during school. We didn’t really run in the same circles. I mostly just saw him during class.”</p>
<p>“So, you two certainly weren’t considered friendly towards each other?” A statement, but he stressed it as though it was a question. Hermione huffed in annoyance.</p>
<p>“Mister Kellner, why don’t you just ask me whatever it is you want to ask me?” A few people in the courtroom chuckled, even Draco Malfoy couldn’t resist smirking.</p>
<p>“Very well, then, Miss Granger. To your knowledge, the Malfoys are known death eaters, are they not?”</p>
<p>“Were.” Hermione corrected. Kellner’s neck nearly snapped in his haste to turn and look at her.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Were.” Hermione repeated. “They were known death eaters. I think we all can agree, their assistance during the battle showed us all that they had no true loyalties to Voldemort.” A few people winced at Hermione’s use of the name, but Kellner wasn’t deterred in the slightest.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I understand, Miss Granger. Are these not the people who tortured you? One would think-“</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, no.” Hermione interrupted, knowing that if she didn’t say something, the Malfoys would never have a chance at a fair trial. “Bellatrix Lestrange tortured me.”</p>
<p>“In front of them, in their home.” He countered.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Hermione replied. Kellner held his hands up as though to say “what else is there?” Hermione sighed. “Tell me something, Mister Kellner, do you have a family?”</p>
<p>“I do.” He replied. “A wife and two girls.” Hermione smirked, knowing she had won.</p>
<p>“You would do anything in your power to protect them, wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Naturally, but I don’t-“</p>
<p>“So, then, tell me…” Hermione interrupted. “If someone like Voldemort had taken over your home and threatened to kill your family, would you have watched a muggleborn like me be tortured? Would you have tortured someone yourself, if it meant keeping your family safe?” Kellner opened his mouth to reply, but Hermione continued. “You see, if you say you would, then it makes you a monster, like them.” She inclined her head towards the Malfoy men. “But if you say you wouldn’t, well… That just makes you a liar.” The courtroom broke into frantic whispers until Kingsley finally silenced the room again. Kellner’s face was red in annoyance as he tried to think of a rebuttal.</p>
<p>“So, you would say these men are innocent, Miss Granger?” he finally asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Hermione replied. “I wouldn’t say that. I don’t think they deserve Azkaban either. They’ve already lost a wife and mother, isn’t that sort of punishment already?”</p>
<p>“So, at this point, what would you suggest, Miss Granger?” Kellner asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm. Hermione pondered his question for a moment before finally answering.</p>
<p>“Are you at all familiar with muggle psychology, Mister Kellner?” Hermione finally asked. He said no. “Well, any muggle psychologist would look at the Malfoys, and most of Voldemort’s followers, in fact, and surmise that they have been conditioned by their environment.”</p>
<p>“Meaning...?” Kellner responded.</p>
<p>“Meaning that many death eaters, especially pureblood families, like the Malfoys, have been raised a certain way by their ancestors; they are emulating what their families have taught them. So maybe the solution isn’t imprisonment. Maybe the solution is to change their way of thinking, a rehabilitation of some sort?” The court was silent as Hermione’s words were absorbed.</p>
<p>“So, your solution is simply to give them another chance then?”</p>
<p>“Not everyone.” Hermione replied. “Certainly not everyone, but some. After all, Draco Malfoy may be an arrogant arse,” Hermione smirked, “But he certainly isn’t a killer. And I don’t think that anyone is truly irredeemable.</p>
<p>“Not even Lucius Malfoy?” Kellner sneered. Hermione glanced at the blonde man across the room from her, momentarily recalling the look of grief on his face when Narcissa was killed.</p>
<p>“No. Not even Lucius Malfoy.” She stated firmly, as Lucius met her gaze…</p>
<p>“Hermione?” The witch blinked herself back to reality as Harry nudged her. “You okay?” he asked. Hermione nodded, turning back to her notes. When the meeting ended, Lupin asked Hermione to stay behind. The pair made small talk while the room cleared. Hermione asked about Teddy, knowing that Lupin was struggling with being Tonks’ death and being a single father.</p>
<p>“I’m always here to help babysit, you know, if you need a day to rest or anything.” Hermione offered.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Hermione, that’s very kind of you. I’ll keep that in mind.” There was an awkward silence and the witch shuffled her feet for a moment. “Alright then, here it is.” Lupin said. “You should know, several war stakes have been cast for you and passed on to me for holding.” He handed her a beautiful oak box that seemed to radiate magic. “Here they are, maybe you want to hold on to them until you make some sort of decision.” Hermione set the box down on the nearby table and looked up at Lupin.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” she said, feeling lost. “I don’t know what that is. What’s a war stake?” Lupin sighed and took a seat at the table, gesturing for Hermione to do the same.</p>
<p>“A war stake is typically invoked after a long period of war.”</p>
<p>“Hence the name war stake?” Hermione asked, grinning. Lupin couldn’t help but smile back.</p>
<p>“Indeed. It is meant to provide extra strength and security to people or families that have been weakened after a battle. Typically, a war stake casts a claim on something, while pledging something in return, usually aid, money, or family treaties.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I still don’t understand, Remus.” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“The war stakes that the Order have received are for you, asking for your hand.”</p>
<p>“My hand?” Hermione exclaimed, standing suddenly. “My hand as in marriage?” she cried. “That’s absolutely medieval, asking for my hand, making exchanges for a bride. Why do you have these? Why didn’t you just deny them?” Lupin shook his head.</p>
<p>“It’s not my right to deny them, Hermione. They have to be presented to you; the decision must be yours. I know the idea seems repelling, but remember, these stakes are meant to bring people together, to form alliances, to strengthen our world.” Hermione was lost in thought for a moment before she sighed, sitting back down.</p>
<p>“Who has cast these stakes?”</p>
<p>“House Nott, House Weasley, and House Malfoy…” Hermione nearly fainted.</p>
<p>“What does that mean? House? And what did they offer in return?”</p>
<p>“Well Theodore Jr. is the only remaining member of house Nott. He pledged a considerable amount of money and family artifacts to us.” Hermione grunted in disgust.</p>
<p>“So, I am to be bought and sold. Wonderful.” Hermione said sarcastically. “And House Weasley. What does that entail? Who would I be marrying?”</p>
<p>“Well a House Wife is exactly that. The wife of a house. It may be something you want to try and research into yourself. Beside that, it was already agreed that the Weasleys have given everything they have to the Order during the war, although the boys did feel it was imperative to pledge donations….” Hermione gasped.</p>
<p>“So that’s really what it all comes down to, then? Galleons? A few galleons show exactly what I’m worth?”</p>
<p>“Of course not, Hermione! But you must remember, the war decimated everything. Money does help in some aspects.” The witch chewed on her fingernails for a moment before speaking again.</p>
<p>“And the Malfoys?”</p>
<p>“Not only did they offer an absurd amount of money, they offered to assist in the rebuilding of Hogwarts as well.” Hermione looked up in surprise. “They also pledged their loyalty to the Order and agreed to help us whenever they are needed.” Hermione’s jaw dropped. Either they wanted to do everything in their power to convince her to choose them, or they offered something absurd because they knew she would never agree.</p>
<p>“So, what happens now? Am I supposed to just choose?”</p>
<p>“No.” Lupin replied. “You don’t have to choose anything right now. You have a six-month consideration period from the time of presentation. After six months you must choose one to accept, or formally decline them all.”</p>
<p>“But if I wait… Doesn’t that forfeit the stipulations of the Malfoy offer?” Lupin shook his head and chuckled softly.</p>
<p>“They have already put forward the money and have been assisting at the castle in their spare time. I suspect they had planned to help with the restoration all along, regardless of your decision.”</p>
<p>Okay… Well, if that’s all…” Hermione bid her old professor goodbye, picked up her box, and made for the exit, feeling uncomfortable. That evening, Hermione did not return to Hogwarts as she usually did. She didn’t even head back to Grimmauld place. Instead, Hermione went home. Unable to restore her parents’ memory after the war, Hermione decided to live alone in her childhood home. She wanted it to help her feel grown up and independent, but somehow it made her feel lonely. That night, the curly haired witch made herself dinner, took a long bath, and curled up in bed with a book and a glass of wine. Eventually, Hermione drifted off into a deep sleep, momentarily forgetting about the wooden box sitting on her dresser.</p>
