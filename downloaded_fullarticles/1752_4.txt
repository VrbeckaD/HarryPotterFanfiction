    <p>
  <span>Remus looked around the small living space, covered in dust. It was clearly a long time ago since someone had cleaned: His mother had been bedridden for a while, and his father had so many other things to take care of. But despite all the dust and the old, worn-down furniture, this was home. The small house, just left to the market, with their tiny garden where nothing had been able to grow since last winter. In fact, the whole town felt like home to Remus. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Can’t believe I’ll be leaving all of this behind,” he muttered. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His father, Lyall Lupin, sighed, putting a hand on his shoulder. Remus had grown a lot over the past year, and he was almost taller than his dad now. “You can always come and visit,” he said. “There isn’t far from the castle to here.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know,” Remus said. “But still… Everything is gonna change, isn’t it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lyall sighed and nodded. “You’ll have a better life, Remus. And that’s all your mother and I want for you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In a way, Remus didn’t want to leave. He hadn’t told his dad, or anyone, about the fear he had. The fear that his mother wouldn’t be there when he came back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had been sick for a while now, and lately, it was getting worse. They weren’t able to afford a doctor and none of the herbs they had access to seemed to help. Remus had thought that maybe, now that he would get to work at the castle, serving the royal family, he would earn enough money to be able to take his mother to a doctor. He just hoped it wouldn’t be too late by then. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Can I speak to mum before I leave?” he asked, looking at his father.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The curtains were drawn closed inside his mother’s bedroom, and the only source of light was a candle on the little bedside table. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus chewed on his bottom lip. Seeing his mum there in bed always made him a little unsettled. It seemed like she got weaker, paler and thinner every day. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She smiled when he entered, gesturing for him to sit down.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How are you feeling, mum?” he asked, sitting down at the small rickety chair next to her bed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, I’m alright.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus knew that was a lie, or at least her idea of ‘alright’ wasn’t the same as his. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I just, uhm,” he looked down at his hands, fiddling with a loose hem hanging from his sleeve, tying nods on it and twirling it around his finger. “I wanted to say goodbye before I leave.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His mother nodded. “Of course,” she said, taking his hand. “Remus.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He looked up, into her eyes. She had a way of making people feel like she was staring directly into their soul with her kind, yet sharp gaze. Sometimes it made Remus want to look away, but not right now. Right now he just looked back, into her deep green eyes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Remember,” she said, squeezing his hand gently. “To always be kind to people. Keep your head low and your spirits high, and stay out of trouble.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus nodded, smiling softly at her, mostly so she wouldn’t be so worried. “Thanks, mum. I’ll remember.” He felt like he was going to cry, but took a deep breath, instead smiling a little wider. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hope Lupin lifted herself up a little on the bed to kiss her son’s cheek. “And most importantly, take care, and remember that I love you,” she whispered. Remus noticed the tears in her eyes, and it made him want to be stronger. For her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I love you too,” he muttered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She smiled at him. “Now go,” she said. “I know you have to get to the castle before the sun sets.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus gave his mother’s hand a final squeeze before standing up, walking back into the living room and kitchen. The house was so small everything was kinda awkwardly pushed together into only a few rooms. This room was also where Remus slept. Or used to. He wouldn’t be sleeping there anymore.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ready to go?” His dad had been waiting for him by the door, holding a small piece of cloth, sewn together to work as a bag.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus answered with a nod. As ready as he would ever be. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His dad nodded as well, then pulled Remus into a hug, which Remus returned. He knew to cherish these moments, partly because Lyall Lupin wasn’t a hugger, and partly because Remus didn’t know when he would get to see his family again. “I’ll miss you, son.” His voice was slightly shaky. He quickly straightened up, clearing his throat, before handing Remus the cloth-bag. “Here, take this. There’s some food for the trip, in case you get hungry.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus nodded. “Thanks, dad.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You better go now,” his dad said. “Goodbye, Remus.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They hugged goodbye one more time, before Remus went out the door, only taking a few steps before turning around and looking back at the house. His dad was still standing in the doorway. They waved goodbye. Remus sighed, turning around. While it wasn’t much, all of this; the village, his home, his family, it still hurt to leave it behind.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius slumped against the tree, letting out a deep sigh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unlike the rest of the castle, the tree at the back of the garden was peaceful and quiet. There were no responsibilities here, outside the castle walls. No one expected anything of him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This was the only place he could really be alone when everyone else wanted to either pamper him and treat him like a baby or drown him in responsibilities and work. Like his father said, being the heir to the throne was both a privilege and a duty. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius scoffed, kicking angrily at the grass. His boot got stuck in the dirt for a moment. Great. Now his boot was dirty. If not his mother noticed it, a maid would. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius leaned back against the tree, taking in a deep breath. He couldn’t waste his very limited alone time on being angry. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He pulled up a dandelion from the ground, the kind you could blow on and make a wish. He did so, and sat for a while and watched the seeds getting carried with the wind. What should he wish for? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There were many things he would like to wish for, but he knew none of them were possible. A stupid dandelion couldn’t take an away his birthright to the throne, or the duties that followed with it. It couldn’t give him a normal life where the fate of an entire kingdom wasn’t resting on his shoulders. The only way that could happen was if he died. Then his brother would take over the throne. In a strange way, he thought that might make his parents happier. They liked Regulus better, anyway. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Finally, he closed his eyes and whispered, “I wish I could get rid of my parents.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius chuckled softly, opening his eyes and looking up at the almost cloudless sky. There were probably many people who wished for the same thing as him: for his parents to be gone. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The evil king and queen. He knew was what people saw them as, and he couldn’t exactly say he disagreed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The sound of leaves ruffling as someone stepped on them could be heard behind him. He turned around, seeing a maid standing there, nervously clutching her apron. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your Highness.” She bowed her head a little as she spoke to him. “The king wants to see you. He’s in the throne room, sir.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius sighed. “Tell them I’ll be right there.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, Your Highness.” The maid nodded before hurrying back to the castle. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Although Sirius would like to stay, he got to his feet and started walking back to the castle. His parents didn’t like to be kept waiting. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When Remus finally reached the gates to the castle, he was exhausted, hungry, and had aching feet. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Two guards were standing outside the gates, no doubt protecting the castle. As Remus got closer, they drew their swords and stepped in front of him. Remus felt a mild sense of panic, and his first reflex was to run, but he didn’t. “I’ve- I’ve come to work… here.” he swallowed, averting his gaze to the ground. “I believe they’re expecting me. My name is Remus Lupin.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The guards looked at each other, grunted, then stepped back, just as the gates swung open. Remus looked up at the towering castle. From down here, it looked like the tallest towers almost reached the sky. Remus had never seen anything so huge before.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Looking around, he saw a boy sitting on the ground, in the process of polishing a sword. He was about Remus’s age, or so it seemed, and he had dark, messy hair.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When Remus hesitantly approached him, the boy looked up but didn’t say anything.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Uhm, excuse me,” Remus muttered. “Can you tell me how to get to the throne room?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy grinned, looking back down at the sword he was polishing. “Well, it would probably help if you went <em>inside</em> the castle,” he said. “You aren’t gonna find it out here.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus sighed quietly. “I’m aware. But do you think you can point me in the right direction?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy shrugged and looked up at Remus again, examining him more carefully this time. “Did you just get here?” he asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus nodded. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy grinned. “I’ve lived at the castle my whole life.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh.” That seemed like unnecessary information unless he was trying to tell Remus something. “Are you-?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Royalty?” the boy prompted him, a playful grin still on his face. “Even better. My dad, Sir Fleamont Potter, is the greatest, most respected knight at the castle.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay.” Remus looked at him, not sure if he was supposed to say anything special to that. “Still, can you show me the throne room?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Although the boy seemed a little annoyed at Remus’s indifference, he got up, placing the sword on the ground where he’d just been sitting. “Follow me, then,” he said, already on his way up the few steps of stairs that led to the castle entrance.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They walked along a hallway. The guy seemed very familiar with the castle. “Are you getting work as a servant?” he asked, eyeing Remus sideways.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus nodded. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy chuckled. “Well, you better hope you won’t have to work for the prince.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why not?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He laughed. “He’s a royal prick. Oh, and if you meet him, you can tell him I said that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They stopped in front of a large wooden door. “This is it,” the boy said. “The throne room.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus nodded, bowing his head a little. “Thank you,” he muttered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Eh, no problem. I’m James, by the way.” He gave Remus a quick smile, before starting down the hallway they had come from. “Good luck!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus took in a deep breath, before pressing down the handle, the heavy wooden door swinging open with a slight creak. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The throne room was the biggest, fanciest room he’d ever seen. A lot of it was just tiled floor and huge windows, the thrones positioned in the back of the room. Which was also where two men were currently stood. The first one to catch Remus’s eye was a tall man with dark hair, wearing black silk and a cape. Remus’s breath caught in his throat for a second. That was the king. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was talking to another, slightly shorter man. Although this man was still dressed in fancy clothing, according to Remus’s standers, it was clear that he wasn’t royalty. Perhaps a royal supervisor, or something along those lines. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus hovered in the doorway for a while, waiting for one of the two men to notice him. His heart seemed to be trying to escape his chest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After a while of talking quietly, one of the two men, the one that wasn’t the king, looked it Remus’s direction. He rolled his eyes visibly, turning back to the king. “Your Highness, it seems that someone, a servant, I think, wants your attention.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The king turned around to look at Remus. He was even more terrifying from the front, with his piercing grey eyes staring down Remus. “Oh,” he said, with a distinct indifference in his voice that showed how little he cared. “What is it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Uh-” Remus bowed his head and cleared his throat. “I-I’ve come to get work here, Your Highness,” he stammered, his voice shaking a little. He knew how it was with the royal family. They were merciless, cruel, and any little mistake could result in harsh punishment. At least that’s what he had been told. “I, uhm, I was offered a job, Your Highness. As a servant. My name is Remus Lu-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, yes, very well,” the king said, waving him off with an impatient hand gesture. “Hey, you there!” he yelled at someone behind Remus. A maid, who stopped in her tracks, bowing to the king. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, Your Highness?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Get my eldest son. Tell him to come to the throne room.” The king still had an air of complete and utter indifference around everything he did and said, as though Remus’s presence, as well as the maid’s, were disturbances, or mild inconveniences that needed to be dealt with. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The maid nodded dutifully and hurried off. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After a short while of waiting, which Remus used looking around the throne room at all the fancy, decorative stuff on the walls, the door opened again and a young man entered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The prince resembled his father in some ways, with the striking grey eyes and defined features, but that’s about where the similarities stopped. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>While the king’s hair was short and greying, the young prince had the most beautiful dark locks, curling around his face to create a perfect frame. There was something careless and daring about him, in opposition to his father’s cold and merciless manners. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You wanted to see me, father?” the prince asked, in a bored tone that suggested he had better places to be.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah, Sirius. We found you a new servant.” The king gestured vaguely to Remus like he was something less than human: a dog, or perhaps a chair, that was to be shown off. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The prince raised an eyebrow at Remus. “It was about time, after what happened to the last one.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His father nodded. “Yes. Now go, I have more important matters to attend.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, father,” the prince said, turning around on his heel and leaving the room. He looked back over his shoulder at Remus. “Are you coming with me or are you planning on standing there all day?” he asked impatiently. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus quickly followed him, almost running across the tiled floor and onto the hallway with the prince. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus knew he it wouldn’t be wise to ask questions but after walking in silence for a while, quietly wondering what the prince had meant by ‘after what happened to the last one’, he just couldn’t help but let his curiosity get the best of him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your Highness?” he asked quietly, glancing at the prince.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He cleared his throat. “Excuse me, but, may I ask what happened to the last of your servants?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He regretted it as soon as the question had left his mouth, but to his surprise, the prince didn’t get angry. “We had to execute him, unfortunately,” he said, in a tone that was way too casual for such a dark subject. “That’s what happens when you’re too curious and find out about things you’re not supposed to.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus swallowed. “Oh.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not much of a loss, though,” the prince said with a shrug. “What even was his name? Severus... something?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They stopped by a nicely decorated wooden door. Remus couldn’t help but smile a little. <em>Even the doors were fancy</em>. The prince opened and stepped inside, waiting for Remus to do the same.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is my room,” he said in that same bored tone of voice. Remus drew in a sharp breath, looking around. The prince’s room was about the same size as his whole house, and so much nicer, obviously. A huge bed, the size of Remus’s old room, with silk bedspreads that matched the curtains. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“In here’s your room.” the prince pointed at a door at the far left of his room. Remus opened it, walking into the small, but still quite nice, servants room. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you, sir,” he muttered, bowing his head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius chuckled. “You seem surprised,” he noted. “Thought we were gonna let you sleep with the rats?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus shook his head quietly, although the couldn’t help but think that, from what he had heard about the royal family, he wouldn’t be surprised. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Anyways.” the prince dropped down on his bed, stretching lazily. “What did you say your name was again?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s Remus Lupin, sir,” he muttered, not quite sure what to do with himself. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The prince nodded. “Remus, I’ve got a job for you.” He gestured to something in the back of the room. Remus looked in the direction, seeing a sword placed carelessly against the wall. “The polishing kit is already in your room, I believe,” the prince said. “I want it polished so well, I can see my own reflection in it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus sighed quietly and picked up the sword. “Yes, sir. I’ll get right to it,” he muttered, already wondering why the hell he agreed to work at the castle.</span>
