  <span>Trees flashed by before his eyes. In the quiet they went away from Little Whining. His home. And that all because of his cousin. What was so dangerous that they had to go away? And why did these 2 freaks think Harry was so important? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dudley shook his head and look around the car. His mother was staring absently forward. His father was driving and sometimes let out a grunt. The woman who sat beside him, Hestia he thought, was watching his father with disgust. The man beside Dudley, whose name he forgot, was the only one smiling. He had his hat in his hands and hummed a song Dudley didn’t know. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dudley stared out the window again. Where were they going? What was Harry doing right now? Was this all a trap to get them out of the house or was there really something going on. “We’re almost there! Just another 4 miles and then stop at the pool thingy!” The weird man said in a cheery voice. “Pool thingy?” Dudley stared ridiculously at the man. “Don’t you mean carpool?” “Oh yes!” Dudley shook his head again. He heard his father mumble. “Stupid freaks.” Hestia was glaring daggers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>5 minutes later the car stopped and they all stepped out of it. “Well, we’re here. What now?” His father stood leaning against the car with his arms folded. His mother was looking around her. “Are we supposed to stay here?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, of course not. Just grab my arm.” Hestia held out her arm but her face said that she rather wanted to leave them here. His mother looked at the arm and then softly laid her hand on top of it. Dudley did the same thing. His father looked like he was going to be sick. But before he could say or do something, the man with the hat, Dedalus he remembered again, grabbed his father’s arm and said “Now!” Suddenly Dudley felt like he was forced between a very small tube and his stomach was twisting. Then they were gone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘This is the worst thing ever’</span>
  </em>
  <span> Dudley emptied his stomach. He was leaning on his knees and took shaky breaths. His mother was rubbing his back and gave him a half hug. His father looked scared and his face was as white as a ghost. Hestia was smirking. Dedalus was smiling. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah sorry. I forgot to mentions that it is not a pleasant experience.” Dudley glared at him. Dedalus however just clapped in his hands and said “Now if you will all come close to Hestia she will tell you the address” “Are we still not there then?” His mother huffed. “Oh we are, you are just not able to see it yet. Now come closer, I do not want to risk anybody else to hear it.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Cautiously, Dudley stepped to Hestia and dragged his mother with him. His father just stood where he was and said “I will not come any closer to you.” “You have to if you want to stay safe, you dunghead!” Hestia clearly didn’t like his father. Miraculously, his father walked towards Hestia. Although it wasn’t because he wanted to. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now you have to look this way and listen to what is say.” Hestia whispered and pointed to a valley. “The address is Mad Valley.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dudley gasped. The ground shook. Slowly a building rose from the ground. It was a big white manor. It seemed to have at least 4 flours and a big garden. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s not much, but it’s ought to keep us safe. Now keep in mind that you will not be the only people here. There are a lot of muggleborns here who are in danger. But I think you will get along just fine!” Dedalus clapped in his hands and walked towards the door. Dudley raised his eyebrow and followed him. The door opened. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Welcome to Hide Manor!”</span>
