    <p>   A toe headed girl sat next to a curly haired girl with two curved horns sticking out the front of her head. Neither of them spoke, the horned one was busy scratching on a scroll with a quill. While the blonde sat glaring at the other, cross armed.</p><p>   The two could not have been anymore different. It was evident in the red and green of their uniforms. Though one of them had always been a girl, where as the other hadn’t. This was her first experience as the female sex. Or his first experience rather. His name was Draco Malfoy.</p><p>   Draco was pretty infamous at Hogwarts. A slytherin prefect with a reputation of being cruel and merciless. Second in his class, he was cunning and ambitious. His pureblood status made him like a god among his fellow slytherins. He was the picture perfect example of a slytherin. At least that is what the world saw.</p><p>   The girl with horns next to him was Hermione Granger. A gryffindor prefect who had saved the school countless times with her two best friends. She was the top of their class and was clever and brave. A brilliant witch, who was definitely going places. She was a muggleborn or as Draco and fellow slytherins would say “a mudblood”.</p><p>   The fact that the two of them were in detention came as no surprise to the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore. What had landed them in detention, however, was surprising to him. In Hermione’s own words she had “Kinda, sorta hit Malfoy with a sex transition hex.”</p><p>   In retribution, Malfoy had casted a horn-growing hex. This had all happened right as Mr. Filch was passing by. Thence the two of them got detention, which consisted of them both writing a 500 word apology to one another. They were not allowed to leave until they had both read the letter written for them.</p><p>   Hermione, having been working hard on it, had already finished. Although she had lots of pride, she understood when it needed to be put aside to do what needs to be done. Beside this detention was cutting into her valuable study time.</p><p>   From the outside it appeared that Draco could not put his pride aside. You see he had lots of pride, that is what happens when you grow up being told you are right, perfect even. Though that wasn’t all to it, people tend to appear more prideful when they are full of self doubt. That was Draco’s case. Even though he was told he was perfect almost his entire life, he always felt wrong. He could never figure out why, so he shoved all the things he thought was bad down. Deep down, any “impure” thought was banished.</p><p>   So it wasn’t the pride that was preventing Draco from writing. For this was the first time in his life, he felt right. He knew that it shouldn’t have been, he was in the wrong body, right? Even still as he looked at his body in female form, he couldn’t help but feel like it <em>was</em> his. After so many nights of staring in the mirror, criticizing, hating, <em>destroying</em> his body. It finally felt perfect. He was switching between glaring at Hermione and admiring his own “<em>right</em>” body.</p><p>   Hermione, getting annoyed, turned to Draco and said, “Are you going to write your letter or not?”</p><p>   Draco glared and snipped, “Of course I will, Granger. Have some patience won’t you?”</p><p>   “Perhaps if you weren’t so busy admiring yourself, you’d already be done,” Hermione retorted, raising an eyebrow. Draco shot daggers out of his eyes at Hermione and proceeded to begin to write “I’m sorry.” over and over again. 250 times to be exact.</p><p>   “I’m not “<em>admiring myself</em>”, I’m disgusted by what you did to me,” He said, continuing writing. Honestly, he'd only said it because he knew it was what was expected of him to say.</p><p>   Hermione scoffed, “Of course because disgust is amoursley looking at oneself.”</p><p>   “Sod off!” Draco cried, throwing the scroll at Hermione. It came as no surprise to her, that he had done the bare minimum. Just as it came as no surprise to him, that she actually wrote an entire essay on why she was wrong.</p><p>   They read in silence, Hermione stopped reading after the 54th “I’m sorry”. Draco only half read, you see he saw the words but didn’t fully process them. Nevertheless, he got the jist.</p><p>   Once again he got distracted by his body. He truly didn’t understand why it meant so much to him but <em>it did</em>.</p><p>   “A body is just a body right? What does it matter if it’s male or female?” He thought. Deep down he knew it mattered deeply. Even deeper down he knew that Hermione was right, he wasn’t disgusted. He was delighted.</p><p>   What he didn’t realize was Hermione was watching him closely. Something about his behavior reminded her of what Luna had described. Suddenly Hermione had the urge to reach out to him, this urge confused her. I mean for god's sake, it was Draco Malfoy. Someone who had tormented her and her friends since first year. Though she did help people in need and well he certainly looked like he was in need. His eyebrows pushed down on his face in confusion, yet somehow he was still pretty. Hermione would be the first to admit this.</p><p>   The features of his or her face were softer than normal. Her nose was less sharp, her cheekbones were not as prominent. Her jawline was softer and rounder. In general, Draco Malfoy in female form was a spitting image of his mother. Other than the hair, which was still platinum blonde but hung in curls around her face past her breasts. The male uniform was ill-fitting in an adorable way, due to losing 3 or 4 inches in height.</p><p>   Hermione noted how comfortable he looked as a girl, she was sure if it were Ron or Harry they’d exude uncomfort. After much internal debate, Hermione finally decided what to do.</p><p>   “Malfoy?” She said, testing the waters.</p><p>   “Yes, Granger?” Although he had the intent to sound intimidating, his voice as a female was more like a sickly sweet poison.</p><p>   Hermione wasn’t sure exactly what to say. Timidly, she asked, “Is there something that you’d like to tell me? I mean I know we aren’t friends but I’m a good confidant and I can try to help.”</p><p>   Draco panicked, had she noticed? Did she know? How could she? Is that obvious that he’s not a boy?</p><p>   Draco scolded himself for thinking the last thought but it still rang true. His entire body knew it. Draco cleared his, her throat. She growled, not very convincingly, “Why would I have anything I’d like to tell you?”</p><p>   Hermione stumbled, “Well I just figured that you might not have someone to open up to and I-”</p><p>   The blonde interrupted her, “Why would I open up to you? Even if I did have something I wanted to tell someone, you’d be the last person I’d tell.”</p><p>   Hermione flinched, Draco felt bad but she had a reputation to uphold. She stood slamming the letter on the table, she turned to look down on Hermione.</p><p>   “How long will this last?” She asked poisonously, gesturing to her body.</p><p>   “A few more hours,” Hermione said, uncertain of the actual amount of time.</p><p>   “Ok, well I’m done reading. Don’t bug me again or we’re going to have an issue. Mudblood,” Draco hissed. For some reason, she felt guilty. That didn’t matter though, she turned and walked out. Hermione sat there for another few minutes collecting herself, before she left as well.</p>
