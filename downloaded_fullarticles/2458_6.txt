          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco never loved Astoria in the way a husband should love their wife. He loved her as a friend. But they had more than most arranged marriages after the war had and that was a lustful appreciation for the other. Astoria is beautiful until the curse begins to take her and it is years before Draco's hairline makes him fret before the mirror. They fill the in-betweens with lustful fucks and polite conversation.  It is better than his friends have; marriages filled with awkward timed couplings in cycles and hardly a good morning. They take what they can get. Gratefully.</p></div>
