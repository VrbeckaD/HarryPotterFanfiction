    <p>“Avada Kedavra!” Voldemort shouted and while Harry saw the curse flying in his direction he couldn’t move out of its path. It came closer and just like the previous few nights Harry woke up when it was just an inch from his chest.</p>
<p>It took Harry a few seconds to reorient himself but then he remembered he was at 12 Grimmauld Place. Only… something was different to the other nights he had woken up in the middle of the night. He could hear more than just Ron’s snores from the bed opposite of his. It almost sounded like – yes, it was some kind of melody.</p>
<p>He knew he wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep anytime soon anyway so he got up to investigate the – admittedly beautiful – melody.</p>
<p>It came from the room two doors down from the one he shared with Ron – Malfoy’s room. But why would Malfoy listen to music in the middle of the night? There was only one way to find out.</p>
<p>Harry just wanted to open the door when he heard the melody stop suddenly.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Malfoy exclaimed. Was Malfoy… practising? Harry had never seen him with an instrument before but he had to admit, the thought was intriguing. In a way the soft sounds fit Malfoy.</p>
<p>Without thinking further about it – because that was a thing he was good at, not thinking things through – Harry went through with his original plan of just barging in before his curiosity killed him.</p>
<p>Malfoy set his instrument against his chin, probably to start playing again after his mistake but when he saw Harry in the doorway he froze.</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you doing here, Potter?” he snapped a few seconds later.</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes. He knew Malfoy was right to ask him that but he still felt like snapping back. “I could ask you the same. How is anyone supposed to sleep with this background noise?”</p>
<p>Malfoy grinned. “It seems you’re the only one bothered by it. Should I play a lullaby for you, Potter?”</p>
<p>Harry knew Malfoy probably only meant it as a joke but he was curious whether he would go through with it.</p>
<p>“Bring it on, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>True to Harry’s expectation, Malfoy seemed taken aback by his answer but he caught himself a second later.</p>
<p>“Maybe you should sit down first. I heard falling asleep while standing up is not pleasant.”</p>
<p>“Are you worried about my comfort, Malfoy?” Harry asked. He was surprised how different Malfoy acted now in comparison to their interactions during the day.</p>
<p>Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “Of course not. I’m just confident in my skills and don’t want to be on the receiving end of anyone’s hexes in case something happens to you while you’re in my room.”</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes again but went with Malfoy’s advice. He should be glad Malfoy hadn’t hexed him on sight and shouldn’t test his luck again so soon.</p>
<p>He went to sit down on the bed that looked the least slept in of the two but before he could sit down, Malfoy exclaimed “Stop! That’s my bed, you heathen. Sit on the other one if you have to.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed. He should have known Malfoy’s bed would look neater than the unoccupied one Molly had only made once, a week ago when Malfoy had first arrived. He did as Malfoy asked but instead of sitting down he lay down on the bed and tucked himself in just to spite Malfoy. Malfoy didn’t comment on it and just started playing once Harry stopped moving.</p>
<p>The lullaby Malfoy played was beautiful, even more so than the melody he had played before. It was incredibly soothing. Malfoy had, at least in Harry’s inexperienced eyes, every right to be confident in his skills. In fact, Harry could already feel himself drifting off and even though he was in Malfoy’s room and had been worried only a few hours ago that switching sides was just a part of Malfoy’s plot to help Voldemort win the war, he didn’t fight sleep. Instead he let it embrace him and just a few minutes later he was back asleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next night, Harry had the same nightmare and once again he woke up to the sounds of Malfoy practising his instrument, though it was a different melody than the ones he had heard the night before.</p>
<p>As Malfoy had neither killed him in his sleep the night before, nor thrown him out in the morning, Harry figured it was safe to go to his room again. This time, though, he knocked and waited for an answer instead of simply barging in.</p>
<p>“Yes?” Malfoy called out.</p>
<p>Harry slowly opened the door and stepped inside. Malfoy was once again standing in the middle of the room with his instrument resting against his chin.</p>
<p>“Potter,” Malfoy greeted him much less surprised than he had been the night before. “You’re back. Is my playing keeping you from your sleep again or will you tell me what is really going on tonight?”</p>
<p>Harry wanted to snap back and tell Malfoy it was none of his business but by coming here Harry had made it Malfoy’s business in a way.</p>
<p>“I woke up from a nightmare,” he admitted after trying to think of a way out of telling the truth for a minute and not finding any. Malfoy had called him out and Harry’s Gryffindor bravery wouldn’t allow him to back down from the challenge. He hoped this general answer was enough for Malfoy because he really didn’t want to go into the details.</p>
<p>Malfoy smirked at him. “That wasn’t so hard, was it? I guess you want me to play another lullaby for you now?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say no to that but I don’t know why you would do that for me. Playing a lullaby for your arch-nemesis isn’t exactly following etiquette, is it?”</p>
<p>Malfoy was silent for a few seconds that felt like an eternity to Harry. When Malfoy finally spoke, Harry thought he would tell him to leave or simply hex him but to his surprise it was neither.</p>
<p>“You’re not my arch-nemesis.”</p>
<p>Those five words surprised Harry more than anything else could have.</p>
<p>“I’m not?” he asked to make sure his ears hadn’t betrayed him.</p>
<p>“No, I… we both made mistakes and now that we’re on the same side of the war I hoped we could have a fresh start and try to be at least acquaintances now.”</p>
<p>Harry was surprised by both Malfoy’s apparent honesty and the vulnerability he could hear in his voice. He had no idea how to fit this into the picture of Malfoy he had painted in his mind during the past years. But maybe it was time to discard that picture and really get to know him.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Harry said and gave Malfoy a small smile. “Is there etiquette for acquaintances?”</p>
<p>Malfoy laughed and Harry had to admit he liked bot the sound of his laugh and the way it transformed his face.</p>
<p>“Well, usually there’s no name-calling but I don’t think we’re quite there yet. Maybe we can try to call each other by our first names and greet each other whenever we cross paths.”</p>
<p>“That sounds doable… Draco.”</p>
<p>“Good. That’s… good… Harry. Now, do you want to hear a lullaby or not?”</p>
