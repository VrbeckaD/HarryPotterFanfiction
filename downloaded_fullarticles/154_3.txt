    <p>Harry was unsure what he had expected upon returning to Hogwarts for his 5<sup>th</sup> year, but it was safe to say that this was most certainly not it.</p><p>Dumbledore was stood at his usual spot, a twinkle in his eyes. The first years had not yet been led in, but the older students had not been permitted to sit down.</p><p>            “Welcome back, students, to another year at Hogwarts! The Ministry has made some education reforms this summer, which are to be implemented immediately.” Harry shared a nervous look with his year-mates; all of them could very clearly remember the last time the Ministry interfered at Hogwarts during their second year. Harry had not had access to the Prophet at all over the summer, so he wasn’t aware of any “reforms” that they had passed but judging from the expressions of Ron and Hermione, neither had they. “Among these changes is the fact that all students are to be resorted after their third year. As such, the second and third years may sit at their tables. Only Fourth years and above need be resorted.” And suddenly, it hit Harry quite plainly what must be happening as he thought back to how angry Fudge had been that Harry was cleared of all charges.</p><p>            Fudge was hoping Harry would be resorted, away from the Gryffindors who would be the group of people that the Minister felt would be most likely to believe Harry about Voldemort coming back. Judging by the twinkle in Dumbledore’s eyes, he had no issue with the plan. Most likely, Harry thought, Dumbledore assumed Harry would go straight back to Gryffindor and should worst come to worst, perhaps he would be able to convince his new House (which, Dumbledore surely thought would be something like Hufflepuff) that Voldemort was indeed back.</p><p>            Harry, however, was not so sure. He thought back to what the hat said to him in his first year: <em>You could do well in Slytherin</em>. He supposed that was no shock- surviving the Dursleys required some cunning. However, what worried Harry was the fact that surviving Hogwarts <em>also</em> required a fair amount of Slytherin traits. As the resort began with the 7<sup>th</sup> years, all of whom looked angry and upset at the possibility of being put in a different House after six years, Harry comforted himself with the reminder that the hat would take his wants into account.</p><p>            The Sorting seemed to drag on for ages. They had finally reached the 5<sup>th</sup> years with Hannah Abbott, who went straight back to Hufflepuff almost the instant the hat touched her head. Idly, Harry wondered what the firsties outside were doing. Perhaps the ghosts were keeping them entertained?</p><p>            “Granger, Hermione!” Hermione walked calmly up to the hat, the exact opposite of herself when she was 11 and had sprinted up to it. The hat once again took it’s time with her, before placing her back in Gryffindor. Harry remembered her telling him that the hat had once debated putting her in Ravenclaw. It seemed the hat still felt that she could be suited to either House, then.</p><p>            “Longbottom, Neville!” Harry watched as Neville approached the hat, far more confident than he had in their first year. This time, Neville was not nearly a Hatstall, but instead was put back in Gryffindor before the hat fully settled on his head. That had seemed to be the main trend; most people went back to their original House. One 6<sup>th</sup> year Hufflepuff had been resorted as a Ravenclaw and one Slytherin had also found themself resorted as a ‘Claw this time around but other than them, most people had gone back to where they had been put before. Interestingly, however, Fred and George and both become Hatstalls. According to the whispers from the other 7<sup>th</sup> years, that had not been the case when they were 11. Apparently the instant the hat sat on their heads back then, they went straight to Gryffindor. Harry, Ron, Ginny and Hermione had all tried to catch the twins’ gazes but each time the twins met their questioning eyes, both just smiled at them and shook their heads.</p><p>Finally, Harry’s own name was called. As he sat on the stool, Harry caught the reassuring gaze of his friends before the hat was slipped on his head.</p><p>
  <em>Ah, Mr. Potter, what a pleasure it is to see you once again. Very rarely do students put me on more than once, and we are here at three times.</em>
</p><p><strong><em>Yes, well, I suppose you have the Ministry to thank for this.</em></strong> Harry thought the hat chuckled.</p><p>
  <em>Make no mistake, I do. Now then... What to do with you? You still have plenty of courage, of course, but your thirst to prove yourself has not diminished either. Oh goodness, but your cunning and your ambition have both drastically become front in center, haven’t they? Yes, there is something you want quite badly, through whatever means necessary.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>You’re suggesting Slytherin again, aren’t you?</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>But of course! You could have done well in Slytherin back then, and you’d do well there now. There is a goal you want, and Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness.</em>
</p><p><strong><em>But I don’t want to be great,</em></strong> Harry argued. <strong><em>That isn’t what I want.</em></strong></p><p>
  <em>Do you not think that defeating Voldemort would make you great? No, even if it is not the glory you are after, you must be great to achieve that goal. </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Slytherin is full of the children of Death Eaters and Death Eater sympathizers. I would not be safe there. I would absolutely not be able to keep people safe if I’m dead.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I think you will find, Harry, that you will be safer in Slytherin then you would be elsewhere.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>I know Godric Gryffindor put some brains in you. Have you lost your mind? At least four of them are the children of Death Eaters, children of the people who tried to kill me only a few months ago.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Children are rarely their parents, Mr. Potter, as you no doubt know.</em>
</p><p><strong><em>They rarely are, but their behavior towards me thus far does not inspire confidence of their benevolence!</em></strong> Harry couldn’t believe this was even a conversation. <strong><em>They’ve been nothing but cruel to me and my friends since we were 11 years old.</em></strong></p><p>
  <em>That doesn’t change the fact that your core values have changed. Your bravery has taken a cooling, I see. Your ambition has become stronger.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Of course it has; I want to defeat Voldemort. He murdered a friend in front of me. He killed my parents. I want to protect people; I don’t want anyone else to die because of me. I want to stop him.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>And Slytherin will teach you the tools to do that.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>No it wouldn’t! Gryffindor is the House of the brave! If I’m not as brave, then surely-</em>
  </strong>
</p><p><em>It is not that you are less brave, Mr. Potter. Quite the contrary. Your desire to keep people safe requires an extraordinary amount of bravery. You are more </em>cautious <em>with your bravery. There is a difference. The adventures you did in your earlier years would not have happened if you were as cautious then as you are now, but that does not make you a coward.</em></p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>So where does that leave us, then?</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Back at the beginning.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>But if I were to keep people safe, I’d need to be recklessly brave. I can’t be selfish in my bravery. Gryffindor will teach me that again.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Mr. Potter, valuing yourself does not mean that you are selfish. Perhaps that is another thing Slytherin can help you with.</em>
</p><p><strong><em>I don’t want to be in Slytherin, though. I thought you took the student’s desires into account?</em></strong> Harry could see that arguing with the blasted Hat would do no good, and so he changed tactics.</p><p>
  <em>Normally I do, however it’s clear to me that you are best suited for Slytherin, and isn’t that what this educational reform was for?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>If you’re trying to tell me that the Ministry is always right, I swear to Merlin I will find a way to bring back Godric Gryffindor so he can undo whatever magic he put in you.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I fear we are getting off topic, Mr. Potter. You need to be Sorted, and I have many more students to get through. My mind is made up. You will do well in-</em>
</p><p>“SLYTHERIN!”</p><p>The Great Hall was deadly silent as Harry handed the hat back to Professor McGonagall. Harry risked a glance over to the staff table and saw that Dumbledore’s eyes had lost their characteristic twinkle. Hagrid was looking anywhere but at him. Flitwick looked intrigued, while the rest of the teachers, save for Snape, merely looked shocked and confused. Snape, however, looked… looked murderously confused. It was an odd combination and Harry fought back a snicker as Snape gestured for Harry to come and speak with him as the rest of the Sorting continued.</p><p>Snape cast a silencing charm before inhaling deeply and exhaling slowly, as if trying to maintain his temper.</p><p>“What, exactly, was that?” The Potions professor demanded, as if Harry knew any better than he did. However, he was wary to answer the Professor’s question. After 4 years of a highly antagonistic relationship, Harry did not feel comfortable telling this man anything remotely close to the truth. Seeing that his new Head of House was growing impatient with Harry’s continued silence, he made the split-second decision to treat Snape as he would Uncle Vernon; with respect but a healthy amount of fearful white lying.</p><p>“The hat felt me best suited for Slytherin this time around,” he said carefully.</p><p>“That is not all of it. You were a Hatstall, meaning the hat would have taken your choice into account. On some level… you desired to be in my House, Potter.”</p><p>Harry shifted, uncomfortable, before deciding a half truth would be best. “The Hat asked me what I wanted. I told it the truth, and it placed me here.” Snape studied Harry with an unreadable expression.</p><p>“Come,” he said, ending the silencing charm. “Allow me to introduce you to your new Housemates.” Harry followed him, although he thought quite darkly, that he did not need any introduction to his year mates. He stifled a sigh as they approached the table, because most of the Slytherins in their year had already been resorted. Blaise Zabini was the last to face the Hat which meant that all the others were staring at him.</p><p>“Slytherins,” Snape began, and although Harry didn’t see the bat cast any spells, there must have been some cast nonverbally and without use of a wand, for the background chatter faded as though another silencing charm was in place. “I understand that some of you have an... Interesting, shall we say, relationship with Mr. Potter here. However, allow me to state a few things that should already be apparent. One, Potter was a Hatstall, in which case the Hat would take his preferences into account; he desired, on some level, to be in this House. Two, as he is now a Slytherin, he is to be treated as such.” Snape’s gaze seemed to lock onto Malfoy, who merely looked bored, as though having his rival resorted into his House was a normal daily occurrence. “If I were to catch wind of any mistreatment towards Potter, I would be... <em>most</em> displeased.”</p><p>Harry fought back a snort at that last phrase; to him, all that meant was that the Slytherins simply would not let Snape find out that they wanted to murder the Boy-Who-Lived.</p><p>Harry sank into the space that had been cleared for him, and Snape – <em>Professor</em> Snape, he corrected himself, stalked back to the Staff Table. His cloak billowed out behind him, in its usual fashion. As he left, the silencing charm lifted, and Harry realized that the sorting had progressed until it was just Ron, and Zabini left to be sorted.</p><p>“Weasley, Ronald!” Harry watched, with a sickening feeling of dread as Ron approached the hat without sparing a glance towards the black-haired boy. As the Hat once again placed Ron in Gyffindor, were he sat with his back to Harry, the boy could not ignore the ominous feeling of foreboding that filled him. If Ron’s reaction was to ignore him, when he had been Harry’s best friend since they were 11, then what exactly would be Sirius’ reaction, when the man had only been in Harry’s life for two short years?</p><p>Harry didn’t want to know the answer.</p><p>The 4<sup>th</sup> years were resorted as well, though the only ones Harry bothered paying attention to were Colin Creevy (Harry was relieved the boy had been placed in Gryffindor again, much to the younger’s clear disappointment), Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood, whom he’d met briefly on the carriage ride over. Ginny had once again gone to Gryffindor, while Luna returned to Ravenclaw.</p><p>Harry ignored the first year Sortings, clapping politely along with the others. He caught a few appraising looks from the others as Harry clapped for the Slytherin first years and Harry wanted to roll his eyes, but he thought better of it.</p><p>“Now then! Welcome, to another year at Hogwarts!” Dumbledore stood at his usual gold owl podium. “I apologize for the wait in beginning the announcements, however, it was unavoidable. To those who changed Houses- I hope you are welcomed to your new House warmly! I would like to remind everyone that people, at their core, are who they have always been and that a new House does not change that...”</p><p>Harry tuned out the rest of the speech. He supposed that bit had been mostly for his own benefit- telling the rest of the school that Harry was still the Boy-Who-Lived. A person to be trusted, despite his new House. Harry was no idiot; he knew that his new House had a reputation. Hell, it’s reputation was half the reason why he’d not been placed here back in his first year. He glanced around and met the questioning gazes of his new yearmates.</p><p>“For Merlin’s sake,” he sighed, “If you lot have a question, could you just ask it?” Nott snorted from his spot catty-corner Harry.</p><p>“Is it true then? What Professor Snape said?” Malfoy demanded, looking a cross between offended and interested.</p><p>Harry nodded slowly, figuring an edited honesty would work with them the same way it had for Snape. “The Hat asked me what I wanted. I told it the truth, and it placed me here.” Everyone looked interested.</p><p>“And pray tell, what did you want, Potter?” Parkinson asked him.</p><p>Harry smiled tightly at her. “That would be telling, wouldn’t it?” To his surprise, the surrounding Slytherins looked approving.</p><p>“A very Slytherin answer. Perhaps there’s hope for you yet, Potter. Don’t think we aren’t all aware of how Gryffindor you are.” It was Zabini who spoke this time, and before Harry could respond, an Eastern Asian girl interrupted.</p><p>“Can we please focus on the announcements now that Dumbledore is finished reminding everyone about the Forbidden Forest?” Malfoy rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Sorry, Trace, forgot you loved to learn every new rule.”</p><p>“All the better to know how to break them,” she quipped back. Judging from their grins, Harry supposed that this was a conversation they had routinely.</p><p>However, her desire to listen to Dumbledore was cut short with a brisk “<em>hem hem!</em>” and Harry could barely believe who stood at the podium. How Harry missed her, he wasn’t sure, because the sight of her made him burn with anger.</p><p>Umbridge.</p><p>The others looked confused as she stood and began talking. Clearly, none of them had noticed her either, or if they had, they hadn’t expected her to begin speaking to them all. The speech largely bored Harry, although he caught the gist of it. “Pruning practices”, and the fact she was from the Ministry, in addition to the education reforms the Ministry had evidently recently passed could only mean one thing: The Ministry was interfering at Hogwarts. The rest of the opening speech passed quickly, and soon everyone was digging into the food.</p><p>“Does anyone know who that toad is?” was the first thing the same Eastern Asian girl had asked.</p><p>Before anyone else had a chance to say anything, Harry spoke up. “Dolores Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic.” Everyone turned to look at him.</p><p>“How do you know her?” The girl, was her name Davis? Tracey Davis? demanded.</p><p>“She was at my hearing.” He glanced at the woman in question, “She’s vile. Terribly disappointed I wasn’t found guilty. I imagine she would have tried to get the sentencing up from expulsion to Azkaban if she could.”</p><p>“Trial? You, Saint Potter, had a trial? For what? Did you finally murder someone?” Malfoy asked, with only a hint of a sneer.</p><p>“No,” he said shortly, and he tried his best to shove Quirrell’s screams from his mind, “I did magic in front of a Muggle, so I suppose they were trying to get me on breaking the underage magic law and breach for the Statue of Secrecy. Although, that bit is utter tripe- The muggle in question is related to me; he already knows about magic. I would not, however, put it past that toad to Obliviate him just to make that charge stick if she could.”</p><p>Silence followed this, then-</p><p>“Paranoia isn't a good look, you know,” Malfoy sneered. “Not everyone’s out to get Perfect Saint Potter, you know.”</p><p>“Given that Dementors have no business in Surrey and that my trial should have only been with Madame Bones, and not the entire Wizengamot, yes I suppose I am a bit paranoid.”</p><p>“Back up,” Zabini said, “Dementors? You got tried by Wizengamot? Potter, what on Earth <em>happened</em>?”</p><p>Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. “A couple of Dementors attacked my cousin and I near his home in Surrey. I couldn’t- couldn’t just leave him, you know? Those things are vile, and I couldn’t let him get Kissed... So I cast a Patronus, and they fled. Dudley, my cousin, was a right sight though. I had to carry him back to our house. Once we got there, I got an owl saying I was expelled for using underage magic in the presence of a Muggle. I challenged it, and I won.” He glanced up at Dumbledore, and then at Umbridge before turning back to his food.</p><p>More silence.</p><p>“Do things like this happen to you often, Harry?” Harry startled at the use of his first name. He turned to look at Greengrass, who looked vaguely concerned.</p><p>“Things like what?”</p><p>“Things that put you in danger, of course.” She seemed aghast that Harry didn’t immediately know what she meant.</p><p>“Yeah, I suppose so.”</p><p>Malfoy sneered. “It’ll be an interesting year then.”</p><p>Harry sure hoped that that was neither a prophecy nor prediction. </p>
