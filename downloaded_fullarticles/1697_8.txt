    <p>The Hat dropped over Harriet’s eyes, too big for her head. She sat in darkness, the din of the Great Hall strangely soft now, like she was listening to the seashell that the science teacher in Little Whinging kept in her classroom.</p>
<p>“Well, well, what have we here?” said a little voice in her ear. “Harriet Potter, is it?”</p>
<p><em>Not you, too</em>, Harriet thought in despair.</p>
<p>The little voice chuckled. It had a dry, almost sarcastic rustle to it. “I can read your mind, young one; it’s what you expect them to say. Now, where shall we put you?”</p>
<p>Harriet thought of Hermione bouncing up from the stool, beaming but pale, as the hat had shouted <em>Gryffindor</em>; Hermione on the train, rushing up already wearing her plain black robes and saying in a rush, <em>Do you </em>know<em> how many books you’re in;</em> Hermione in Ollivander’s, her hand shaking as she took a wand out of its dusty box and golden sparks dropped like glittering rain from the tip.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” asked the small, rustling voice. “You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head – and Slytherin will help you on the path to greatness, no doubt about that. No? – well, if you’re sure – better be GRYFFINDOR.”</p>
<p>Heart flipping with relief, Harriet pulled off the hat and was almost knocked off the stool by the noise exploding from the Gryffindor table. Percy the Prefect even got up to shake her hand, and Fred and George Weasley were throwing their hats in the air and yelling, “We got Potter!”</p>
<p>Hermione flung her arms around her as soon as Harriet squeezed onto the bench next to her.</p>
<p>“I knew it! Didn’t I say!” Hermione said in her ear.</p>
<p>Harriet grinned. She felt like only Hermione’s grip on her arm was keeping her from floating off the bench. “This is the start of you being right about everything, isn’t it?”</p><hr/>
<p>Severus watched Lily’s daughter be absorbed into Gryffindor with more fanfare than any other student he could remember in the last twenty years. Of course it would be Gryffindor. Any other option would have been ludicrous.</p>
<p>The feeling that he’d just had a narrow escape could only be paranoia.</p>
