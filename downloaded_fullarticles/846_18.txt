  <em>Cam - Burning House</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">     </p><p align="justify">       The flames were licking the midnight sky, free from the moon and the stars. The sky not long ago covered in thick November fog was now black as tar and hovered above the barren soil, wrecked and scarred as an old wound. The fire had been burning for long hours without any sign of dying out as if some foreign hatred and the sorrow yearning from the very soul were feeding it with everlasting power. The house was old and haunted. The oldest house in Merlin-forgotten district was standing like a sign of shame and pain of a life once lived here. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">         The fire was dancing merrily on the molded walls, on the peeling paint, and on the broken glass piercing into the night. He hated this house - the forever reminder of his broken past and hopeless future, but having no place to stay, he kept returning to this embodiment of pain, humiliation, and darkness. Now The Spiner's End was burning and the owner of the house was nowhere to be seen. The night gazed indifferently at the flaming fire. Flames slowly, as if trying to taste, crept up to the wooden windows, licked off the rotten wood and carefully looked inside. Both the night and the flame had long been the full owners in this house, which had seen a lot in its miserable lifetime. The only owners. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">       They met a couple of years after the war. She stumbled upon him in the distant corner of Knockturn Alley where she came in search of a very rare and forbidden magical plant that would help her to brew a potion to restore her parents' memories. She was looking at him determinately while he was trying to mock her, rather out of habit than really out of a sense of mockery. She stopped being his student as he stopped being a teacher. There was no need to play The Snarky Professor in front of her. He kept playing nevertheless. She did not care about his attitude, her job of a Healer in St. Mungo's taught her to deal with the worst cases of the behavior of the victims of War, so she just looked him in the eyes and asked for that rare plant she came to the Apothecary for. Several weeks later he received an owl with a letter thanking him for his help with her parents. He muttered something about insufferable former students and forgot about it. Three days before Christmas he spotted her in some dark corner of the Knockturn Alley crying silently about something. He came closer and touched her shoulder. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">   "Miss Granger, what are you doing here?"</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">   "Wallowing in my misery or so it seems. Go where you've been going, Professor, I have neither will nor desire to play wits with you" she snapped in reply making him almost laugh with astonishment. She had really grown up after all. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">  "Get up, Miss Granger, we wouldn't want Rita Skeeter to recognize us, would we?" he asked helping her up. She muttered something rude but followed. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">   "I don't recollect you speaking obscenities before"</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">  "Working with hopeless cases makes a person tough", she replied quietly. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">  "I take, something didn't work as intended?"</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">  "Why do you care?" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">  He had never seen her so angry and so broken before. Hermione Granger was anything but broken. Determined, insanely brave, highly intelligent and forever curious. He could not recognize her now while guiding her to his Apothecary. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">  "So, what's gone wrong?"</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">  "Why do you care?" she repeated stubbornly and stood in front of him, her chin in the air. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I've seen you stubborn and determined, curios and quiet, fierce and thoughtful but I've never seen you hopeless, Miss Granger, that's why I want to know what happened" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was she who fought for him with Wizengamot authorities and drove the Ministry crazy to get him pardoned, and Snape knew about it. It was she who stayed by his side in the middle of the Final Battle to keep him alive and conscious, and he remembered it. It was she who kept his wand safe and returned it to him on the first occasion, together with the keys of his house in Spiner's End, and he never got the chance to pay her back. Snape, after all, was a man of his word. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I've been working with Longbottoms so far, trying to restore their memories. The potion I bought from you worked miraculously well and they seem to gain consciousness. You know, despite your hatred to Neville, he is a truly kind soul and a very brave one, mind you..." </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Snape just sneered in response and added after Hermione glared at him. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"True, Miss Granger, I owe him for killing Nagini. So, if everything is turning to be okay with his parents, why are you so broken? Has something else happened in between? And, please, do not tell me to mind my own business, after all, it was I who sold you that highly effective and illegal potion" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"You never change, would you, Professor?" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"That's highly unlikely" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I kept working with my parents. I wished to bring their memories back to them, so after testing the potion on wizards, I took the Portkey to Australia... I never managed to get to them. Call me pathetic and hopeless, but I saw that they were having a happy life with good career and a charming white-fenced house there and my mother was eight months pregnant. I returned here, I have no place in their life anymore" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I hope, you found your solace in the arms of your supposed fiance?" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hermione gaped at Snape, and he just shrugged in response. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"We broke up after a couple of months of muddling through and I started my studies for Healer" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"You always had a soft spot for stray animals, hadn't you, Miss Granger?" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I doubt that you were some kind of a stray dog when I was trying to save your life at the Shack, struggling between keeping you awake and sewing your wound with rough threads." </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"About that, actually... I never had a chance to ask you why you were struggling so stubbornly to save my life? I would never believe you had faith in those hero-worshipping rumors they spread after the Battle" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I wanted everyone to have another chance and another life, free from darkness and mistakes. You may call me foolish and naive but still... Longbottoms, for example, they are extremely happy to have their son back but they lost two decades of their life, it's hard to fit back into the world that threw you away so indiffirently" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"That's the reason of your crying?" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I've nowhere to go, Professor, no one wants me anymore. I try so hard but I keep failing. I lost my parents, I parted with Ron, I closed the doors to my childhood house because it doesn't feel like home anymore. I fight but I see no end of my fightings" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"The world itself owes you for saving it, you've never fully understood your own potential" Snape muttered with annoyance. Hermione let a small smile touch her lips. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"About finding your place, though, I've been in need of an assistant, Miss Granger, so if you consider my offer, I might have a spare room above the Apothecary..." </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She blurted her agreement and Snape smirked inside his head. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He owed her for saving his life and he always paid his debts. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> - The end of the first chapter - </p><p align="justify"> </p>
