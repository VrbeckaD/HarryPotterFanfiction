<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">After an exhausting day of traveling Harry and his twin brother Chris were laying down watching the watch on Dudley's wrist. There was ten minutes left until the hand struck twelve. Ten minutes until Chris and Harry turned eleven. The twins lay there and watched the as their birthday got closer and closer. At five minutes til Chris thought about everything that had led them to this moment. He thought about the letters that appeared one day in July. He thought about how Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had suddenly started treating them differently. How they'd started paying closer attention to what the twins did and where they went when they left the house.</p><p align="left">Even though Uncle Vernon didn't let them read the letters he still freaked out. Everyday more letters arrived and everyday Uncle Vernon would freak even more. He burned the letters and the nailed the letterbox shut, but the letters kept coming. They came with an increasing force for a week straight, until finally Uncle Vernon had enough. When close to sixty letters came flying down the chimney on a Sunday, Uncle Vernon told everybody in the house to pack some bags and get in the car. Harry grabbed some clothes while Chris grabbed clothes and his sketchbook. Uncle Vernon took them to a forest and then to a hotel, but when two letters arrived the next morning they left almost immediately. Uncle Vernon's last resort was to a small building in the middle of the ocean. He drove to a river and then grabbed a boat and steered them to an island in the middle of no where. </p><p align="left">Chris looked back at the watch. One minute to go and he and his twin would be eleven. Thirty seconds...twenty seconds...ten-nine-he grabbed his brothers hand and gave it a squeeze-three-two-one-</p><p align="left">BOOM.</p><p align="left">The whole shack shivered and the twins shot up from the floor, watching the door. Someone was outside.</p><p align="left"> </p><p> </p>
