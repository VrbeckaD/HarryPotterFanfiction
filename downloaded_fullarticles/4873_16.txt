  <span class="s1"> Tonks never mastered the talent of secret-keeping. For others, she held their confessions fiercely close and quiet. For herself, she carelessly wore her heart on her sleeve—at least, that was what her mother said. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You and your uncle,” she’d huff. “You are both un-shuttable books.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Nature or nurture, it didn’t really matter, but Tonks certainly shared a few traits with her beloved uncle Sirius. His rebellious, tactless, and flaunting lifestyle inspired quite a few people who came across him. But Tonks got along just as famously with Sirius’ husband, someone who actually kept his emotions and secrets close to heart. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Sometimes Tonks tried to be less open, but she found it much more fun and less stressful to just be. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Just let me <em>be</em>, mom,” she’d say.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Be what?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Be. Just let me be.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks had been fairly fortunate as a young questioning woman. As a child, she received a lot of smack for all the questions she spouted, particularly at authoritative figures. And then a particular set of questions began happening, even before puberty, and they never stopped, really.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “So you are,” a person would trail off, waiting for Tonks to confirm or deny homosexuality—as if that was the only other sexuality. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Questioning,” she stated, proudly, without confusion. If people became annoyingly persistent, she’d change her answer to “fluid”. Gender, sexuality, romanticism—any of her orientations. She wanted to be free to change. So she was.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> And beyond that. Life yearned to be limitless and she intended to tap into that potential.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> As someone “different” in such a stagnant society, Tonks recognized how fortunate she had been. Sure, she got looks, a few comments, but she lived in a place where people claimed to be “accepting”, “progressive”, “we’re all humans”. Behind doors, behind their faces—that was a different story. She felt uncomfortable growing up but never that unsafe.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> All except once. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> It had been her first girlfriend—two weeks secretly together as eleven-year-olds—and they pressed their lips together, clumsily, behind an ice cream shop. Two girls a few years older than them saw and began harassing them, insulting them for being <em>perverted. </em>Naturally, Tonks threw a punch, gifting someone and earning her own first split lip.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Then, from the heavens, descended the Angel of the Gays. Also known as Mrs. Sprout, the school gardener.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> It was amazing, infinitely better than the mediocre kiss minutes prior—the <em>shade</em> Mrs. Sprout could throw. Tonks’ inner Sarcastic Savage™ grew like Jack’s bean stalk solely from that one experience. Those two girls went running for the hills.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Afterwards, Tonks wouldn’t settle for anything less than bi-weekly Sunday tea with Mrs. Sprout, now Pomona, and her wife, Minerva.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Oh for goodness' sake,” Minerva had sighed, though with more amusement than Tonks’ mother had said it when Tonks walked through the front door at seventeen and a half years old.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You wear your heart on your sleeve, dear,” Pomona had said, “but you sure do wear sex on your face.” She promptly fell apart into giggles.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> When Pomona was admitted to an elderly home, unable to care for herself, Tonks wanted nothing more than to be there for her but life had other plans. Things spiraled, Tonks spiraled, thinks went crazy, Tonks went crazy. They lost contact.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> At twenty-two, Tonks met a sweltering summer wrapped in grey, gloomy clouds trapping in the heat. Her uncle Sirius and his husband Remus wordlessly welcomed her into their home with no expectations. Something in Remus—gorgeous as ever—reminded her of the solace she found in her Pomona.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> In ripped, baggy black jeans, Tonks borrowed the car at early dawn and drove North for three hours. Boasting Sirius’ friend’s shirt—dark maroon with <em>Shove this up your Ass</em> accompanied by a pair of antlers—Tonks made her way through that elderly home, claiming to be Pomona’s niece.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I think you’ve lost a few marbles,” Tonks said.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Pomona, her face wrinkled with peace like the leaves of her well-loved greenhouse plants, said, “More than a few. Not the good ones, I hope.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks hummed, stretching her body out in pretend contemplation, her chair tilted back on two legs. “I think you may have one or two good ones left. The rest, I’m afraid, are fairly rotten.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Pomona smiled. “Splendid.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks forgot the moment she met <em>her.</em> Maybe it was the time they crashed in the hallway, a surprise when rounding the corner. Perhaps it was when she silently popped into Pomona’s room to clear away dishes and trash.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> All Tonks remembered was that at one point she held her hand out, a cheery introduction on the tip of her tongue, and the girl stared at Tonks’ hand in a vague, distasteful manner before brushing past her. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “What’s up with her?” It came out as an uncharacteristic grumble, but Tonks itched with a renewed curiosity. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Miss Fleur?” Pomona stroked her thumb over her sweet potato sprout. She plainly said, “Oh, she’s lost more than she’s loved.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Lost more than loved </em>made its way onto the Lupin’s fridge, stuck to it with a magnet. Remus had a strange habit of sticking certain phrases or words in places. Tonks’ favorite was the most messily scrawled, barely distinguishable as Remus’ handwriting, <em>pigeons poop daily</em> with a giant period after each word. He tried to throw it away several times but Sirius always, always found it and re-taped it somewhere.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Remus raised a challenging eyebrow when she snorted at the reiterated words of Pomona, shared to him by Tonks yesterday.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Maybe I’ll put up something, too,” Tonks said, a slow smirk gracing her face. “I know I heard a few interesting phrases when I passed by your bedroom door last night. Maybe I’ll even share it with Teddy.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Sirius entered the kitchen, lazily holding a sleepy Teddy. “You know,” he said, “you’re kinda an asshole.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Stealing the toast from Remus’ hand and taking a bite, Tonks smiled broadly. “But I put the kind in<em> kind</em>a an asshole.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Ah-hol!” Teddy repeated.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Even without the written reminder on the fridge, the explanation ran through Tonks’ mind tirelessly. It might have been futile, Pomona may have been spewing nonsense like she was now prone to do. Tonks shamelessly took the words to heart from a woman that left grapes by the door for supposed mice that came at night.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> She wondered if “Miss Fleur” had overheard the conversation or if she was a mind reader—how <em>wicked </em>would that be!—because she clearly sensed the intrigue and her unspoken answer was a firm no.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Not necessarily steering clear of Tonks, Fleur ghosted around her, still tall and proud but with an almost feral skittishness. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> For the first time in her life, Tonks became tangled in true frustration that seeped deep into her bones.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Fleur was the type of beautiful that old people said could get a girl in trouble, had a large black mole on her collarbone, and a blank face that perfected hiding everything.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> It was like that stupid poster in Tonks’ old English professor’s classroom, the one of an ice berg showing the small tip above the water and the enormous extent of ice beneath. A metaphor for analyzing text past the surface.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks saw the slimmest spread of Fleur's ice but she could sense the depth beneath it. She imagined herself as the Titanic, skimming and crashing into Fleur’s iceberg and falling apart completely.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> The thought sounded mildly pleasant.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Morning, Miss Fleur,” Tonks greeted at the front desk. She made no move to sign in on the open binder.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur stared at desk’s computer screen for roughly two minutes. Tonks knew this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>because she made it about halfway through Nicki Minaj singing Anaconda inside her head. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Violet’s not really your color,” Fleur eventually spoke. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks instinctively touched her short, colored hair. A chuckle escaped her mouth. “It makes me look peaky, doesn’t it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur’s eyes flickered to Tonks and Tonks took it as surprise even though her expression hadn’t changed. This would be difficult. Tonks would need to hone in on her observation skills to be able to bounce off Fleur’s mood and reactions. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Unapologetically, Fleur said, “Yes.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> This time, Tonks noticed the thick french accent cloaking Fleur’s voice. She’d heard before that the French hated them but she decided this brashness was just Fleur as herself. Tonks had the impression that this mysterious woman rejected all and any influence from others. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks didn’t mind influence, herself. She liked people, liked trying on new attitudes, learning and picking up habits here and there. She found that everyone had something to offer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Signing in, Tonks watched Fleur pull out a piece of gum.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Whaddaya think?” Tonks asked, twirling around with her arms wide. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur blinked several times and Tonks noticed her hands tighten slightly around the cart of food trays she was pushing. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Better?” Tonks prompted.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur maneuvered around her. When their bodies aligned next to each other for a brief second, she muttered something in French. Tonks considered it a compliment to her new bubblegum pink hair.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “What’s this girl to you, anyway?” Sirius asked, pushing toy trains with Teddy, who was naked for no reason.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks lied on the ground with her legs stretched up against the cool wall, her ass pressed firmly against it. Tilting her head back, she blew a raspberry and Teddy, upside-down from her view, clapped his hands. “How come Mother never taught me french? Wasn’t that a,” she pitched her voice into a stuffy superior tone, “<em>Black tradition</em>?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Sirius mimicked the voice. “<em>Ah yes, the good old cult customs</em>.” He dropped it. “I don’t know, I don’t look like your mother, do I?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yes, you do,” Tonks said, thinking how any picture of a Black's face looked identical.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “But I’m <em>much</em> prettier. I don’t know, maybe she wanted to get away from all that traumatic stuff. I know I did. French is still quite useful to me though, isn’t it Moony?” Sirius raised his voice at the end.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Remus peeked out of his little office, dorky old man glasses perched on the end of his nose. “What?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Sirius spoke a long string of sentences in French and Remus’ face instantly bloomed pink before his head disappeared and the door slammed shut. Tonks raised and dropped her arms onto the floor for emphasis. “See? Even Remus knows French.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Oh, Remus doesn’t know a lick of French.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> When it hit her, Tonks gasped loudly and said in a scandalized fashion, “<em>Remus</em>!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> A muffled <em>I hate you both</em> came through the wall. Sirius and Tonks burst into laughter and Teddy clapped along.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Why do you come here every day?” It was more of an accusation than a question.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Got nothin’ else to do,” Tonks said. She noticed Fleur’s eyes darted down to Tonks’ belly button piercing for a split second. Today, Tonks wore shorts, a horrid shade of green, that could be zipped into pants and a cropped yellow tank top with a Bob Dylan design. She hadn’t really listened to his songs or had an opinion on him, but the design on it had looked funny at the second-hand shop. She wondered what clothes Fleur wore outside of the pale blue work uniform. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You mean avoiding,” Fleur said. She flipped her long hair over her shoulder in a way that seemed like she wasn’t aware of how sassy it was. She walked away, sashaying like she wasn’t aware of how her hips moved, either.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Or like she wanted people to think she didn’t know what she was doing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks came into Pomona’s room multiple times while Fleur read to her, but each time Fleur had stopped and left.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “She <em>reads</em> to you?” Tonks had asked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “She has a beautiful reading voice and soul,” Pomona had said. “Plus, she has the most hilarious critiques on characters.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur frowned—not physically, still a blank sheet, but Tonks could feel it—and Tonks smiled, waving the bouquet of tulips from the doorway. Pomona placed a shaky hand on Fleur’s wrist, stopping her from shutting the book in her lap.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “No, go on, dear. If you don’t mind.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur’s response was defiant and immediate. “I do not.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Not wanting to make Fleur more uncomfortable, Tonks pulled up a chair a good distance away and closed her eyes as she listened. Fleur stumbled on the first word but never again after. Even though she read slowly, pronouncing each sentence like she had difficulty deciphering words, her voice was hypnotic. Tonks took in little of the actual plot, except the ending, a brilliant twist that she easily saw coming.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Pomona fell asleep by the end.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Is this a favorite of yours?” Tonks whisper-asked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur wrinkled her nose, an actual expression, offended at her taste being associated with John Steinbeck’s <em>The Pearl</em>. “This? I took it from some old man’s shelf.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “A thief, huh?” Tonks teased, inwardly delighted. The potential in a great friendship between them grew.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> A jaw muscle ticked. Fleur smiled blandly before stepping away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I didn’t mean to insult you,” Tonks rushed to say, “and I won’t say anything. I’ve stolen <em>lots</em> of stuff, well I’ve nicked, I mean, as in pranks—”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You have not hurt my feelings,” Fleur interrupted. “If you excuse me, I’m going to return this.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks stared helplessly as Fleur left, and then at the shut door for a good minute or so.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Well, that went horribly,” Pomona piped up from behind, in the armchair she had supposedly fallen asleep in.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Holy shit,” Tonks whispered to herself.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Language.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Holy fuck!” Tonks’ spoon clattered to the floor, flinging cornflakes with it. She gaped at the window, at the small figure walking down the street. “That’s her!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Who?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “The girl from Pomona’s. I was looking out the window, waiting for Richard to show up so I can cat-call him, and then I saw—I saw, she,” Tonks trailed off, pressing her forehead into the glass, with her hands on either side of her head. Fleur came to a stop in Tonks’ foggy exhale on the window.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Human interaction begins with actual interaction. Just a helpful tip,” Remus said from the kitchen.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Human compassion begins with actual compassion. Just a helpful tip,” Tonks fired back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Really? Hm. And all these years I thought it began with sarcasm to thinly veil love. Tonks, I’m serious—don’t say it—go and say hello. Invite her up.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Aw, you love me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I’m tired of putting up with your ugly personality. Go make a new friend. Have some compassion for me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Okay,” she whispered. “Okay. I’m going to do it.” Tonks stared out the window three seconds longer, making sure Fleur was still there. She popped up and hurried to the door, grabbing a coat off a hanger. “I’M DOING IT!” she shouted. A muted Sirius <em>YAY!</em> came from down the hallway somewhere.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Hurrying down the apartment complex’s stairs, Tonks physically crossed her fingers, hoping for the best. A friend would be nice. Everyone else in this part of town seemed to be old and older.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> A burst of hot air ruffled her short hair as she pushed the lobby door open. “Hey, Miss Fleur!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur took a moment to search the street, looking for Tonks. She acted to not be caught off guard but Tonks noticed the tiniest flinch when she first called out. Tonks jogged across the street, waving stupidly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Hi,” she said again. “Good morning.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “It’s almost noon,” Fleur deadpanned. “You should look before you cross a road, you know.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “So, whatcha doing? Do you usually go on walks on the weekend? Are those bird seeds?” Little grains littered the ground before them and Richard pecked at them. “Richard!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Richard?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yeah, he comes here every morning with a stick in his beak and gives it to his lover, Larry. I don’t see Larry today, though.” Tonks scanned the surrounding area. “Hm. Maybe they had a fight.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur openly stared at Tonks. When she regained composure she said, “I carry bird seeds in my pocket for my walks. So, is this what you do, then? Creep on pigeon relationships and be babysat by Mrs. Sprout?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “That’s adorable. Sorry, I’m still caught up on the bird feeding part.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> A sudden wetness hit Tonks’ shoulder and she cussed, twisting around and looking up to see Sirius hanging out the window, holding a water gun. He shook it at her. “Far shooting! Neat huh? Come on up, French Girl! Remus made cookies and I need someone else to help pretend they taste good.” Sirius threw on his charming smiling-smirk, bright enough to see even from this distance.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks glanced at Fleur apologetically and hopefully. “That’s my uncle. He’s a pain in the ass, but he’s cool.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Insanity runs in the family, then?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks laughed. Fleur blinked, and Tonks guessed she appeared almost proud. “C’mon, come with me. For support. The cookies really are awful.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You people have a strange way of persuading.” Fleur crossed the street without checking for cars.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Why are these everywhere?” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Cookie and random-food-in-the-fridge time had been a little chilly and awkward at first but Sirius and Tonks together made an excellent team of barreling right through any tension. Remus and Fleur bonded in quieter conversation and he even made her smile once—which Tonks was resolutely jealous about, though unsurprised.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> The terribly gross married couple went to wash the dishes together, clearly giving the two girls time together alone. Tonks had led her down the hallway toward the guest room she had snuggly settled in. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur’s fingers hovered, tempted to touch, over the slip of paper on the wall that said <em>“no!”</em> with a scribbled date next to it. She raised an eyebrow at Tonks, waiting for an answer. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Oh, Remus does that. Just hoards words. That’s Teddy’s first word.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Their son?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yup,” Tonks popped the p. “Remus’ dad is watching him right now but he’ll probably be back soon.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur nodded absently and Tonks moved them back into action, leading the way to her room and kicking open the ajar door. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Welcome to my humble abode. Sorry ’s bit messy.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Colorful,” Fleur commented, neutral.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks cocked her head. She had never thought of it that way, but she supposed it was. Oranges, reds, yellows, pinks. Sitting on the swivel chair at the desk, she spun around and grinned, gesturing for Fleur to have a seat on her bed. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “So, how come a nursing home? Are you an old soul who only connects with old people,” Tonks joked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Need money,” Fleur said, her voice a hint bitter as she sat down. Huh. Tonks had been under the impression Fleur came from big money. Her clothes looked expensive. A pale grey romper, high lacy white socks, cute little brown shoes. Tonks’ question of what Fleur would wear was finally, partially answered. “And no,” Fleur continued. “Despite the cliche view of working with old people being cute and enlightening, they can be quite rude and difficult.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I’m sure some are sweet. You must have made a few friends.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Mrs. Sprout is…spritely. On her good days.” Her voice had a softened quality to it. The effort it took to catalogue and analyze every small difference in Fleur was exhausting. Rewarding, too. “I can see why you get along.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You’re saying I’m spritely, Miss Fleur?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Maybe<em> unfiltered </em>is a better fit.” Fleur stood up and went to look at the figurines at the bedside table. With her back to Tonks, she added, “It’s not bad.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> When Fleur insisted on leaving, Tonks insisted on having the water bottle peeking out of her bag be refilled. With the heat outside, one needed to stay hydrated. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “What’s this mean?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks finished pouring cold water from their Brita filter. Her heart jumped, seeing Fleur trace her finger over the words on the fridge.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I don’t know,” Tonks softly answered. “You tell me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur’s hand dropped from the words <em>lost more than loved.</em></span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>=</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Ayyyy Rich-ARD lookin’ good today,” Tonks called out the window the next morning. “You bring wingman to a whole other meaning!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur opened up, a flower’s petals unfolding one by one, after that. She held conversations that were more than a few sentences and shared the times she read to Pomona.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> She even started muttering her insults at certain characters, which never failed to make Tonks laugh in some way.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tilting her head, Fleur scrutinized Tonks' face. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “What do you think? We acted out Peter Pan for Teddy last night and I was Hook. I <em>love</em> it. Not really good with makeup but I watched some videos and I think I did pretty good.” Tonks made a flourishing movement with her hand around her lower face, showing off the beard she had drawn on with Sirius’ eyeliner.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur wrinkled her nose in distaste. She held up a finger and left, leaving Tonks with a sort of sinking feeling in her stomach. She never gave people the power to make her feel uncomfortable but for some reason, this stung. Touching her face, she even considered wiping it off.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> When Fleur came back she held up something in her hand. “Here,” she said, uncurling Tonks’ fist and forcing a blue liquid eyeliner pen in her hand. “This color would suit your face much better.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks caught Fleur smoking a cigarette around the back of the nursing home building.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I don’t know if you’ve heard,” Tonks walked forward at a leisurely pace, her hands in her pockets, and Fleur eyed her warily, “but those can actually lengthen your life. Magic.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur’s lips twitched. Tonks came close, so close, and she noticed a small freckle under Fleur’s left eye. Reaching out, she plucked the cigarette, her fingers brushing those pink lips. She brought it to her own lips and sucked in, promptly coughing out the smoke with watery eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks would never forget this next moment and she’d look back on it lovingly until the day she died. That night, she’d simply write down the date and an estimated time, pinning it up on the wall next to Teddy’s first word—Fleur’s first laugh.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> A grating, barking-like sound erupted forth and Tonks' mouth parted as Fleur hunched over, snorting with laughter. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks’ face protested the power of her smile but she kept widening her grin, exposing her teeth in delight. She dropped the cigarette, uncaring, which she had intended to do anyway.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I thought you’d be good at that,” Fleur said, her voice sweetly breathless. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks shrugged, not offended. “Nah, never really my thing. I’m a surprise.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Nodding, Fleur exhaled a half-laugh, loose sarcasm in her voice when she agreed. “Yes. You are—what’s the word,” Fleur licked her lips, thinking. “How do you say it? Clumsy.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Clumsy?” Tonks laughed. “If I gained a year of life every time I heard that, I’d never die.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Clumsy,” Fleur repeated. “In life.” She leaned against the building wall and a gust of wind—hot as ever—rippled her hair, a strand crossing her face. She didn’t reach up to push it away. It struck Tonks how beautiful she was. “You knock into everything—knees all bruised, yes. But clumsy in life, too. With people. With how you move in,” Fleur tapped her own chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks thought she understood. “Good clumsy?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur’s lips tipped upwards. She slid down the wall, coming to sit on the ground. She patted the space beside her, inviting Tonks to follow. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Coming down, a thrill ran through Tonks. She crossed her legs, noticing that the strip of exposed skin above Fleur’s ankles was covered in hair. Personally, Tonks liked shaving her legs at this point in time, such a soft feeling. She wondered if Fleur never shaved. She wanted to reach out and touch. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Pomona’s having a tough day,” Fleur said. Her accent came out thicker the more she talked. “Heart aches.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks’ gaze dropped and she folded her hands, twisting a silver ring. “Minerva.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Her wife?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yeah. She was brilliant. Pomona-level brilliant. Harsh and fantastic,” Tonks said. She missed Sunday tea days. It took a minute for her to meet Fleur’s gaze. Her face had tightened back to that blank look, making Tonks realize just how relaxed Fleur had been moments before. “Death is weird.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur shook her head. “Not weird. I don’t fear it all. The pain beforehand maybe, but not the death, not dying.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I constantly shift. I don’t know what I think.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Clumsy.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks laughed. Fleur smiled.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Something wet dropped on Tonks’ leg and she narrowed her eyes, wildly expecting Sirius and his best friend to be spying somewhere with their water guns. Another droplet hit her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Is it raining?” Fleur asked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Right? I think I felt something.” The rain became visible, slow at first and then soon turning into a downpour. They sprang up and pushed back against the wall, trying to use the tiny overhang of the building’s roof for protection. “Well, fuck,” Tonks mumbled. She turned her head, finding Fleur already staring intensely at her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> They locked gazes, their heavy breathing softly audible over the sound of rain. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> They didn’t look away for a long time.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I always wanted to be an old straight woman saying ‘you’ll see one day’ to two people interested in each other,” Pomona said, eyeing Tonks.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You’re not straight. And I don’t think a straight woman would say that to a non-hetero couple.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Pomona raised her eyebrows at Tonks, rearranging the flowers in a crappy ceramic vase Remus made.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks made an outraged sound when she realized. “I didn’t mean we’re a couple! I don’t see her like that. <em>She</em> doesn’t see me like that.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You’ll see one day.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur joined Tonks on a walk to the park with Sirius, Remus, and Teddy. They walked a little bit behind the small family. Tonks ignored her bitterness toward Sirius chatting easily with Fleur in French—the way she had perked up excitedly when he spoke. How strange, all these new feelings Tonks experienced. Envy and such had never been her thing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Teddy is adorable. I love his hair. Very unique.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks tripped over a sidewalk crack and expertly kept walking like it hadn’t happened. “Thanks. I did it when they were having a date night and I was babysitting.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “What were their reactions?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I took a great Polaroid of their faces when they walked in. I can show you next time you come—if you come back to the flat. They’re pretty chill but still shocked. I just used some blue food dye.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You’re trouble.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks grinned. “You should see Rem and Sirius’ friends together. That water gun was nothing.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I’m not sure I’m ready for that.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks laughed at Fleur’s expression. “Nah, I think you’d have fun. We’d be a good team. I see you, Miss Fleur. You can fool people and easily sneak up. You’re not a prim princess.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Expecting Fleur to smile and duck her head, Tonks was surprised to find she was the one to hide her reddening face. Fleur’s smile was a deadly thing. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Are you his favorite aunt?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “His only aunt, really.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “What?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “What?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You had a funny look on your face. I never expected you to hold something back.” A fond taunt—an easy opening to confess or drop the subject. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Slowing her pace, Fleur copying, Tonks said, “I’m actually his mother.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “His mother?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yeah. Typical ‘teen trash’ story. Knocked up the second I left home, uninterested biological father. It fucking sucked, I do <em>not</em> recommend being pregnant. Especially the last month. Sirius bought me a whale costume for Halloween because I was so big.” Tonks lifted her shirt and pointed out the silvery stretch marks. “I thought about abortion but I don’t know. Remus and Sirius struggled with being on a waiting list to adopt a child. And at the time, they almost had a child but it fell through at the last minute. The thought popped into my head and I just offered it without thinking and I’m glad I did. I love Teddy but I love being an aunt. My mother was pretty good about it. But she can be suffocating and I got post pregnancy depression or whatever. Went to school, dropped out, went to school, dropped out. Remus offered me a room here to sort things through.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur listened quietly, her face pleasant—no pity, no judgment, no shock. “Does Teddy know?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “No. I don’t think he’d understand, anyway. He’s only two. I don’t usually tell people. Actually,” Tonks thought about it, “I’ve never told anyone. Everyone around me at the time knew, obviously. I lost all my friends. Well, I guess I had to tell my mom but she looked at my face and basically knew.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Clumsy. Open heart.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks eyed her with a burst of affection. She wanted to make her laugh again. “I told her she chose the wrong name for me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “My real name is <em>Nymphadora,</em>” Tonks used the stiff voice she and Sirius did and stuck her tongue out. “Our gross blood family loves stars. But there’s, like, a Saint Nymphadora that’s a virgin or whatever. I mean, she knew I had sex and stuff but I felt like this was the next level of not being my name.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur didn’t laugh but she did snort unattractively. Tonks adored it. “That’s a stupid joke.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks shrugged. “I’ve always hated my name. So I go by my last name.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I think it is fitting.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Why?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Like a Nymph.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Are you calling me a magical creature?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur was silent. Her fingers briefly brushed against Tonks’ as they walked. “Maybe.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> They started having Sunday hang-outs at this coffee shop near the flat. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Ah, the subtle dance of love. You remember those days, Moons dearest?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Sirius, you’re about as subtle as smashing a rock into someone’s face. You literally hung up mistletoe over my bed while I slept. In July.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You guys are disgusting and <em>we’re not dancing</em>.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I don’t get it. It’s not like you’re having a gay crisis. Is she having a gay crisis and blind? Are you both blind? Do I need to get out the mistletoe?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Bring it out as long as you’re happy with it getting shoved up your ass.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur eventually met the rest of the crew—Sirius’ platonic soulmate James, Lily, Peter, and Lily and James’ son, Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I see what you meant,” Fleur whispered, watching with light alarm as Sirius and James wrestled on the ground. “It’s strange.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “How?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I’m not used to this.” Tonks looked at Fleur curiously. She refused the urge to smooth away the crease between Fleur’s beautiful eyebrows. “I don’t really have family. I lost my parents. Gabrielle—my sister, we were in homes and other homes and then we got separated.” Fleur licked her lips. She watched Harry and Lily hold Teddy’s hands and swing him in the air. “I was homeless for awhile.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Do you live somewhere now?” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yes. Not nice like this but any place is a good place.” Fleur scanned Tonks’ face and Tonks’ heart hammered in her chest. She wondered what Fleur looked for, what she saw. “I had an accident and had very bad amnesia. I don’t remember them much. Gabrielle a little.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You never re-connected?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur shook her head. “Maybe one day.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>What do you have to be scared of?</em> Tonks thought. <em>What do you have to be ashamed of? You’re strong and smart and vibrant and lovely and you secretly pick up grapes a crazy old lady leaves so she can believe dancing mice take them—</em></span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “This is so strange,” Fleur said again, surveying the bubbly love in the room. “I don’t know what this is like.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks swallowed. She took Fleur’s hand, laced her fingers with Fleur’s long ones, and tugged her into the throng, determined to replace lost with loved.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Nymph,” Fleur said. “Do you want a hot chocolate? I’ll pay for it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks blinked. The cashier of their coffee shop coughed, annoyed that they were holding up the line.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Nymph?” Fleur asked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Um, yeah—yes.” Tonks had no idea why she said yes to a hot chocolate in this fucking sweaty summer but—no one had ever called her that before.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Tonks knew if anyone else said it, her cheeks would have burned with annoyance.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> They were still burning but for an entirely different reason.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I wish Min could be here to see this,” Pomona said one day after Fleur left the room.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Me too,” Tonks said.</span>

  <span class="s1">=</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Nature or nurture, Tonks was open and recklessly transparent and careless about throwing herself head first and lacking all subtlety.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Fleur was wearing loose overalls and Tonks' stupid ugly Bob Dylan yellow crop top and you could see her armpit hair sticking out and she gestured weirdly as she talked about birds and—</span>
