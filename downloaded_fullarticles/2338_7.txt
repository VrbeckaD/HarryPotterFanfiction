    <p>The summer heat was unbearable. It was the beginning of June, the dampness of spring rains had dried, only to be replaced by the now overflowing stickiness of sweat. The light wind dragged lazily through the dry, yellow grass and he wondered how much hotter it'd have to become for a wild park fire to scare away nuisance below.</p><p>Dispassionate dark eyes swept over the park below. The thing that held his ire was sprawled upon the dead grass beneath his balcony. A small group of teenagers lay sweating and baking under the clear sky, writhing and crawling in an attempt to communicate, but doing nothing more than squirming like oversized worms. His eyes were drawn to one in particular. A blonde boy, certainly the largest of the group, lay slouched against a park bench. A brown eyebrow quirked as a meaty palm slapped against the pavement in a few different spots before it dropped to the ground and the boy let out what sounded a wail - fitting, the observer thought briefly, a wail from a whale - groaning about his lack of refreshment. </p><p>Snorting the observer, a tall young man, turned from his balcony door. The whale had outlived his entertainment value. The man stretched and grimaced, even with his windows and balcony door open his clothes still clung to him, and he wasn't wearing much having already stripped down to his vest and shorts. He refused to step one foot outside in his state of undress, not with the wretched woman living diagonally above him. She often leant out her window to oogle him, and try and engage in what he assumes is a form of flirting, but it's so dreadful it was hard to tell. He only knew she was after him due to that incident just before Christmas; he'd been leaving his flat and was about to head down to a little festive market in town when the woman had pounced on him. He'd been searching for his cat for hours that day, and his questions about its whereabouts were answered when the bat had swung the poor thing, dressed in a small elf ensemble, around in a garishly pink stocking. She had then manhandled him against his door whilst brandishing a sprig of holly. That was a Christmas he'd rather forget, but it was this incident that led to the perfect name for his cat - the creature had managed to squeeze itself from the costume and proceeded to rip the oversized sock -and her hand- to shreds. He fled from death at the hands of an insatiable old witch with a taste for younger men. Voldemort, an apt name for a cat so skilful, and as someone fluent in French he was thrilled with himself. It was for this reason, and this reason alone that he didn't report her to the landlord for inappropriate behaviour, pets weren't strictly allowed in the complex, but if he said nothing then neither would she. A mutually beneficial arrangement - though that wouldn't stop her trying something else in the near future. </p><p>Sighing, he glanced once more at his balcony door, shuffling his possessions - a box of matches, a large candle and a journal engraved with the name Tom Marvolo Riddle, into their proper place, before his attention was caught by the very creature that'd saved him from the crone's clutches. Voldemort stood proudly upon his kitchen counter, tail raised high, and surveying a room like a king would his dining hall. He was certain that the only reason he kept the creature now was as a deterrent for the menace, he disliked it and it disliked him, and showed him so on a regular basis: his bookshelves had pale scars lining their dark wood, a chunk was also missing from the second bottom shelf of the case nearest the living room door, and he can't remember the number of cushions he's thrown out from Voldemort had decreed his litterbox was below him. There was nothing but mutual contempt on both parts, so it truly would be best for the creature to be rehomed.</p><p>The cat raised its flattened face to stare at him. He stared back. It's long, fluffy twitched behind it in agitation, his fingers twitched in anticipation. They stared, frozen in place, staring each other down. The beast pounced, deftly leaping from counter to the sofa arm, to the furthest cushion, but the man was ready. He sprung forward, tossing every soft furnishing over his shoulders, before grasping the corners of the latest designated litterbox and ripping it out from under the beast. It was launched from its seat and landed on the coffee table, back arched and snarling before darting through the balcony door. </p><p>Tom stared after it for a moment before letting out a strangled yelp and rushing after it. Gripping the metal railing, his eyes swept the grounds below him, no signs of Voldemort's demise and no sign that the lumps had been disturbed - the beast hadn't lept from here. Flight From Death indeed. Then how- where had the wretched thing gone? The young man ran a hand through his sodden hair, it clung to his neck and forehead dropping slow trails from their tips. Tom took a sweeping look around, carefully avoiding being in sight of the balcony diagonally above when he noticed another set of balcony doors set ajar. His heart stuttered. What was he supposed to do now? The cat had wrangled itself into another flat, how was he supposed to get the beast back? It knew he was a man of solitude, never once had there been anyone but them in his home -his sanctuary- but now the cat had escaped the occupier of the flat it fled into would have to return it. No one was so important to enter here. Tom was often told he was arrogant and distant, but if his home was his place of solace, no one had the right to breach it.</p><p> No. There was only one thing for it, he'd have to take the bloody thing out of that flat himself. He'd heard the occupant leave earlier in the day, and usually, it was a while before they came back, he'd be in-out, and no one would know. Tom clenched his hands on the railings once more and squeezed his eyes tightly shut, and for the first time in his life, he said a silent prayer, mourning his dignity as he set his foot securely on the top rung of the railing. He launched himself over, arms flailing, in nothing but his vest and underwear, before flopping down on the balcony diagonally below, knees bruised and hands skinned. He was humiliated, peering over the edge, the only consolation he had was that the lumps below were still engrossed in their burning to notice his glorious indignity. He sneered, picked himself up and slipped into the flat. </p><p>His eyes were met by utter chaos.<br/>
Voldemort was already at work, what looked like a gordy red and gold vase, or used to be, lay shattered next to a black leather sofa. Voldemort was wreaking havoc in the kitchenette, shredding maroon tea towels and trying his best to open the fridge door. </p><p>Tom, once he surveyed the room and decided that the person living here had no taste, slowly advanced on the beast. He'd trap it, grab it and drag it back hissing and scratching before it did any more damage. Tom only wished it'd be that simple: he lunged for the beast, who screamed, darting to the top of the fridge, to fly down over the dining table and dived under the sofa. The man dived with him, down on his knees, his clothed arse swaying in his effort to drag the cat back out</p><p>"Well, I didn't expect this when I popped to the shops", Tom jolted, hitting the back of his head on the bottom of the seat and lost his grip on the cat. He didn't move. His head was still stuck under the sofa and his arse was still in the air, and, he thought is utter despair, he was still only dressed in his vest and pants. The front door dragged itself closed, shutting with a resounding clunk, as the beast tore itself from the sofa and settled itself back out on the balcony, tail swirling in the air behind it. Tom heard a chuckle and watched trainer-clad feet travel to the front of the sofa before it shuddered under the force of the person that had now flung themselves upon it. </p><p>"Why, may I ask, are you in my apartment?" There was a note of amusement in an otherwise stern voice, an attractive voice. It was smooth, and warm and masculine. And laughing at him.<br/>
Tom's head shot up, his dark eyes blazing up at the newcomer from between brown hair flopped in seaweed tendrils: how dare this man mock him, him- but as he took sight of green eyes before him his thought process stuttered to a halt. </p><p>"I'm not a burger!" Fuck. He didn't know why that was the first thing he said, "fuck the cat!" â€¦ and why that was the second. This has got to be the most inarticulate moment since he had no teeth to articulate with, no wonder the man was laughing! His head -gloriously messy black hair- tossed back and teeth gnashing, Tom glowered at him from his knees on the floor behind the sofa, while the man calmed and leaned forward on the front, he folded his arms on the back of the seat and looked down at him.<br/>
"Well, with your face down, arse in the air in nothing but your undies, I didn't think you were" green eyes rolled, "unless of course, the standards have significantly lowered, no. I thought perhaps you were one of dear old Dolores's friends who'd simply... gotten lost."<br/>
Tom couldn't hold back a snort, dear Dolores indeed.<br/>
"She does seem terribly friendly, especially when she tries to assault me with mistletoe" he bit out. The man grinned at that, looking pleased with himself.<br/>
"Aaah, so you're him with the demon cat", he glanced around thoughtfully gesturing to the scraps of cloth on the floor, "the demon cat who for whatever reason ransacked my tea towels and- is that my vase?!" He deftly leapt over the back of the sofa and gathered up the shards of that ugly piece of pottery mournfully.<br/>
"In that respect, he did you a favour" he got a glare in return for his opinion on that matter, oh well, it just proved him correct, the man had no taste.<br/>
"I suppose I can't hold it against him, he did maul darling Doloresâ€¦" he carefully placed the pieces on the sideboard and grinned over his shoulder, "I'm Harry, by the way. What's your name burglar?" Tom swallowed, shifting from his knees into a more dignified, cross-legged position.<br/>
"Tom. Tom Riddle", head held high, he may as well try to look like he had pride left, despite it fleeing the moment he was caught here. Harry, such a plebian name like his own, sauntered over to him once again, and leant against the seat, a hand ruffling through his hair.<br/>
"Well then, Tom Riddleâ€¦" he dragged out his name, raking his eyes over his bedraggled form - maybe he did have taste after all - "I suggest you have a shower, I can lend you some clothes, you'll help me tidy up this mess your cat has created ..." Harry leant down, eyes glittering with malicious glee,<br/>
" And then we can plan our darling Dolores' next meeting with 'the demon'".</p><p>Maybe he'd keep Voldemort after all..</p>
