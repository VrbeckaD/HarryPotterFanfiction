  <strong>DOMINIQUE</strong>
</p><p>"You know what I've heard?" said James, whispering conspiratorially to his cousins. <em>What</em>, mumbled Fred, eating what was probably his tenth butterscotch. "I've heard that this year," he paused, "there's finally going to be another Triwizard Tournament."<br/> Dominique furrowed her brows. "Coddswallop," she said. "They're never going to bring it back. D'you even remember what happened, last time?" the girl asked.<br/> "Yeah, considering my dad won it, I think I bloody do, thank you," her cousin replied, with a mocking, longlashed gaze.<br/> Dominique narrowed her eyes, in annoyance. "Well then you'll remember that your dad almost bloody <em>died</em>?" she asked him. "And that Diggory did die?" she continued, lowering her voice at the mention of a name that she knew still pulled at her aunts' and uncles' heart strings.<br/> James remained unconvinced. "Yeah, but they had a mass murdering maniac after them, didn't they?" he asked. "We don't."<br/> Fred cut in. "You don't know that."<br/> "What?" asked James.<br/> "You don't know that." Fred repeated. "We could have. A mass murdering maniac after us, I mean."<br/> After a second of silence, James elected to ignore his cousin's contributions to the conversation thus far. "Anyway, as I was saying, my sources tell me that this year," he continued, giddy with excitement, "they're really going to bring it back!"<br/> "Your <em>sources</em>?" said a voice, from behind them. It belonged to Dominique's older sister, Victoire, sitting snuggly in the other corner of the sofa with a book on her long legs. She was always the least impressed by James' shenanigans, and that evening was no exception.<br/> "Yes, my <em>sources</em>," insisted James, with a hint of aggression in his tone.<br/> Roxanne, who had been watching the conversation with silent excitement, could control herself no longer. "Come on, James! Tell them what it's gonna be like this year!" she said, ecstatic.<br/> James smiled, deeply self-content. "Well, word on the street <em>is</em>," he began.<br/> The voice of their older would-be-cousin, Teddy, suddenly imposed itself. "Word on the street is," he said, smiling like a condescending older brother, "you're a silly little bugger who believes anything he hears." At James' indignant look, Teddy continued. "There's not going to be a tournament. Don't you think I'd know? I am the only one here who's old enough to compete, after all," he explained.<br/> "Well my dad competed when he was..." intercut James.<br/> "Your dad had a mass murdering maniac after him, didn't he?" said Teddy, with his signature crooked smile. "We don't." Seeing that young James was becoming distraught at having his fantasy ruined, Teddy changed his approach. "Settle down, Jamie, you don't need a bid international tournament on your first year at Hogwarts to make it a good one," he said, ruffling James' hair. <em>Sure would help</em>, the boy mumbled.<br/> Roxanne smacked her cousin on the shoulder. "You bloody said there'd be a tournament!" she complained.<br/> Teddy intervened. "Well, there won't be, Roxanne, but you know what there will be? This year, at Hogwarts? A brand new, stronger than ever Hufflepuff Quidditch team, sure to win the cup. I'm sure you two will be cheering for it hysterically, as you'll no doubt be sorted into my great house," said Teddy, half-joking, half-not.<br/> Fred snortled. "Fat chance. Besides, Hufflepuff has as much of a chance of winning as I do of..." His face was immediately covered by one of Teddy's large hands, provoking laughter in James, Roxanne and Dominique - and even in Victoire, if Dominique's peripheral vision proved accurate.<br/> "Don't listen to him. Poor boy doesn't know what he's saying."<br/> Fred managed to free his face of Teddy's grasp. "I do, actually?" he rebuked. "Because this year, both the Gryffindor and the Ravenclaw team are about to get astoundingly better," he said, smirking with symmetrical dimples that he shared with his younger sister.<br/> "Oh yeah?" Teddy asked. "And could that be because they are getting two <em>riveting</em> new players?"<br/> Dominique smiled. "You got that right." Though her separation from her cousin at Hogwarts had once been a source of great dismay, it soon became the exciting promise of a real Quidditch rivalry. Besides, though Ravenclaw and Gryffindor did not always have coinciding schedules, they managed to spend time together on most days.<br/> "So Hufflepuff's task is about to get a whole lot more difficult," said Fred.<br/> Teddy laughed. "I'm shaking already," he said, having in the meanwhile begun to walk away, heading towards the adults.<br/> Dominique watched him go. He'd grown even taller, measuring at a little over six feet. But there was nothing left of his awkward, teenage lankiness, Dominique thought, as she saw him seamlessly slip into Uncle Harry and Uncle Ron's conversation about Ministry business. He could almost look like a Ministry employee himself, if it weren't for his bright blue hair, tight jeans and denim jacket covered with patches of weird bands Dominique had never heard of. A weird one, that Teddy.<br/> Dominique sighed, as her mind wandered elsewhere. Though her cousins kept chatting gleefully about this thing and the other, the young twelve year old girl's thoughts were wrapped in aprehension.<br/> She did want to join the Ravenclaw Quidditch team. She'd wanted to be part of a Quidditch team ever since she was five years old and had ridden a broom for the first time. During her first year at Hogwarts, she'd died of anticipatory anxiety, thinking about when she actually would get to try out for the team. <em>Next year, next year, next year</em>. Now next year had come. And though Dominique deeply wanted to be a part of the team, she was not too certain that she'd be joining the right team.<br/> Being sorted into Ravenclaw had been...a mixed experience. Her sister's tight, proud hug had felt asfixiating, and had filled Dominique with the overwhelming dread that she had been put in the wrong house. She had been a hat-stall, after all. It was perfectly possible that the Sorting Hat had got it wrong. But she had told herself - <em>no point in bloody wondering. You're here, you're here. You must be here for a reason</em>.<br/> A year past, she still had no clue what that reason was, though. I mean, yes, she was smart, and quite a promising witch, alright, but so had Aunt Hermione been! And she'd been sorted into Gryffindor! Dominique could find absolutely nothing in common with the girls in her house. To her they all looked like a large mass of pretty faces, prim poses, and petty spirits - especially her cousin Molly. Though of the same age and house, the two simply could not get along - Dominique's messy, loud self got on Molly's nerves like no other. Though there wasn't much that <em>didn't</em> get on her cousin's nerves. It was no wonder that the petite, freckled girl didn't have any friends.<br/> The same could not be said for her sister Victoire, of course - who, though beautiful and obsessively neat, was, in Dominique's opinion, a very nice and moderately sociable person, with whom she generally got along, despite their differences. And there were <em>a lot</em> of differences - one could almost say the Veela gene had skipped her.<br/> Truth of the matter was, Dominique was boyish, brutish, and boisterous - most days she felt like an ill-shaped chicken fluttering amongst long, elegant flamingos. Always falling short of her mother's expectations - unlike Victoire and their younger brother Louis, who lived to meet them.<br/> "Dinner's ready!" yelled Grandma Molly, from the kitchen. James bolted from his seat beside her.<br/> She did have a rather close-knit relationship with her father, though. Dominique's cool, war hero, curse-breaker-in-Egypt father more than made up for her lack of a connection with her mother. Even if he was away at work most of the time. Dominique hardly even noticed it, anymore, since she had entered Hogwarts. But she supposed it must be hard for her mother.<br/> Regardless, her parents looked as lovey-dovey as ever, sitting at the dinner table far closer than they necessarily had to. Dominique slumped into her seat.<br/> "You alright?" her cousin Roxanne asked, from the seat beside her. It was very considerate of her to be so observant, Dominique thought. She liked Roxanne quite a lot - and the fact that they got along so well thoroughly validated Dominique's femininity. Roxanne was a girl, too, and she was just as roudy and sporty as Dominique was. She wondered what house her cousin would be sorted into. Probably Gryffindor, just like her older brother. And so would James, no doubt. And everybody would be in bloody Gryffindor and Dominique would remain the weird, drifting plastic bag that she was, in an ocean of tall, skinny, proper jellyfish.<br/> "Yeah, I'm alright," she replied. "Bit tired, is all."<br/> "Roxie, James, you two excited?" asked Uncle Ron, as he simultaneously tried to convince his daughter Rose not to help her younger brother use his cutlery. <em>Well he needs to learn</em>, he whispered at his protesting wife.<br/> "Yeah!" answered James, a bit too loudly. "Loads!"<br/> Roxanne nodded in agreement. Dominique knew she didn't quite like it when people called her Roxie.<br/> "You have a big legacy to follow, you know," Uncle Ron told Roxanne, pointing at her father with his elbow. "And since your brother isn't living up to it," he added, with mocking disapproval, "I guess it's all up to you and James."<br/> "Well and I have a big legacy, too!" James protested. "I'm also named after a famous prankster," he said, before being shushed by his mother. Dominique cringed internally. In those rare cases when someone did let slip a reference to their deceased uncle Fred, a heavy silence fell upon them which lasted for several minutes. Thankfully this was not the case, Dominique thought, as she saw that her Uncle George had been all the while busy discussing Wizard Wheezes products with Albus and Louis.<br/> "They might not even be sorted into Gryffindor, though," her sister Victoire added.<br/> Uncle Ron wagged his fork at her. "Victoire, I will not have that kind of negativity in this house," he warned, jokingly.<br/> Grandma Molly intervened. "Well <em>this house</em> is not yours to govern, Ronald," she admonished. "Besides, I'm sure James and Roxanne will make a wonderful addition to whatever house they're sorted into," she said, smiling. "Though, hopefully, Gryffindor," she added, provoking laughter in those who could hear her amongst the familial chaos. Thankfully, Teddy was not one of them, even though he was sitting right next to Grandma Molly - because he had, for the past few minutes, been attentively listening to one of Lily's whimsical theatre plots. Though only seven, the youngest of the Potter family had a personality that could fill up a room. That is, if everybody could hear her in said room - which was definitely not the case, at that moment.<br/> "This is good," Uncle Harry told Grandma Molly, pointing to the food on his plate. Everybody immediately agreed, putting a smile on the matriarch's face.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>VICTOIRE</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, come on, Victoire, my dear, do grab a bit more roast!" her Grandmother said, urging her towards the colossal tray of home-made lamb roast, topped with butter gravy and a wide assortment of vegetables. Victoire smiled uncomfortably, unsure of how to reply.<br/> "There, there, Molly, don't you see our young Victoire is watching her figure?" joked Teddy, who had just finished listening to one of Lily's stories. Victoire became even more unsure of what to do, and cursed her pale, blushing complexion.<br/> Mrs. Weasley made a sound of disapproval. "Watching her figure! Girl's barely fourteen years old, she needs to eat, needs to grow!"<br/> "Gonna grow sideways, if she doesn't watch it," mumbled James, before being elbowed harshly by his cousin, Roxanne.<br/> Mrs. Weasley persisted. "Here you go, dear, some nice vegetables." Victoire sighed in defeat, cutting up the additions to her plate into smaller bits. If she ate slowly enough, she could make them disappear discreetly, she was sure. <em>Not to worry.</em><br/> "Victoire," her cousin Molly said. Sitting right next to her, the younger girl had been dead quiet since the beginning of supper - though that wasn't entirely unexpected, when it came to Molly. "Could I ask you for a rather big favour?" she asked, tucking her short, pin-straight red hair behind her small, delicate ear.<br/> "Sure," Victoire replied. It wasn't everyday that she got to interact with her cousin Molly, who was a very reserved (and often times not very nice) person, in general. Victoire was deeply curious as to what her cousin wanted.<br/> The girl was clearly taking advantage of the ruckus around them to speak without being heard by anybody other than Victoire. "Well, as you know, I'm quite competent at potion brewing, for my level," she began, and Victoire nodded automatically, though a part of her cringed at the lack of modesty. "But I'd like to be even better. I'd like to be quite extraordinary," she said, with intense, dark green eyes. "I'm very passionate about potion brewing," she explained, breaking eye contact.<br/> "Alright," Victoire replied. "How can I help?"<br/> "Well, since you're two years older than me, and you are, as far as I can see, quite competent yourself, I'd like you to tutor me. Throughout this school year," Molly laid out.<br/> The question of "Why not ask Professor Munkwell?" arose in her head, but immediately found an answer in her thoughts: she wanted her teacher to think her merit bigger than it actually was. Victoire frowned internally. This was not entirely morally correct. But, on the other hand...this was her cousin, her anti-social, generally not-very-happy-looking cousin. And it wasn't like Molly would be cheating off of Victoire's tests. She'd simply be learning from her.<br/> "Yeah, sure," she finally replied. "I can do that." This would be good; it would give her an opportunity to finally connect with her cousin, and perhaps help her in some non-academic way.<br/> "Thank you," Molly smiled, with pearly, sharp teeth. "I'll owl you closer to the start of term, to arrange the specifics."<br/> Victoire nodded. Her cousin's rigid, somewhat petulant formality had always struck her as slightly ridiculous. From what she could see, she had gotten it from her father, her Uncle Percy. And probably from her mother Audrey as well, though the woman didn't quite match her husband's level. Molly's younger sister Lucy, however, retained not a drop of this feature - though perhaps, at nine years of age, it was too early to tell.<br/> "Are you excited for your other classes?" Victoire asked, taking this opportunity to get to know Molly a little bit better. The Percy branch of the family was the one she was least familiar with: they were quiet, reserved, and often absent. Victoire had often wondered why.<br/> Molly hesitated, but decided to humour her. "Yes, terribly. Second year is a very important year, after all," she said.<br/> Victoire nodded. "Last year before you choose your electives. Have you thought about which ones you'll pick?"<br/> Molly drew the hint of a smile. "Haven't really thought about much else all Summer. So far, I'm set on Arithmancy and Ancient Runes."<br/> Victoire smiled brightly. "Arithmancy is fantastic."<br/> "Yes, well, eitherway, I just don't really see the point of any of the other electives," Molly continued. "Divination is pure rubbish. Care for Magical Creatures is irrelevant to my interests. And, to be honest, I don't even know why we still have Muggle Studies," she confessed.<br/> "Well, some people are quite interested in Muggles," noted Victoire. "You know, like our grandfather," she said, nodding towards a smiling, aging Arthur Weasley.<br/> Molly was unconvinced. "Yes, well, he's rather the exception, I think."<br/> Victoire was afraid of arousing displeasure in her cousin, and of ruining the precarious geniality recently formed. "Perhaps," she conceded.<br/> For a moment, she thought she could spy out of the corner of her eye an observant Teddy - but when she turned her head to look, he was talking amiably to Grandma Molly, and seemed to have been doing so non-stop for the last few minutes.<br/> Victoire, too, took advantage of the loud mess around her - and managed to lay her napkin on her lap, spilling bits of buttery vegetables onto it. As her father made a point of complaining loudly about another one of Uncle Charlie's absences, Victoire slowly folded the napkin on her lap and tucked it safely away in her pocket. She breathed a delicate sigh of relief.<br/> "And now: dessert!" announced her Grandmother, running off to the kitchen. Victoire restrained herself from rolling her eyes.<br/> "It's a very special dessert," said her Aunt Ginny, "because Ron's made it."<br/> Her Aunt Hermione turned to look at her husband, astonished. "Always the look of surprise," Uncle Ron said.<br/> Aunt Hermione chuckled. "Make dessert more often and the look will go away," she joked.<br/> "Maybe I will," her husband rebuked.<br/> Uncle Harry intervened. "Hermione, I really think you should try the cake before striking that bargain."<br/> "Well think of it this way," proposed Teddy, stretching in his seat. "If it's bad enough, you won't have to live with the consequences of your bargain, because you'll be dead," he said, making James roar with laughter. Victoire did roll her eyes that time. James was always so impressionable when it came to Teddy's silly jokes - well, he was impressionable when it came to Teddy, in general.<br/> "I'll remember that," said Uncle Ron. Teddy only smiled, his green, almond-shaped eyes crinkling with small laugh lines.<br/> "Here it is," said Grandma Molly, laying a five-tier, multi-coloured cake on the table.<br/> "Blimey," said Uncle Harry. "It looks very...festive."<br/> "I was feeling inspired," Uncle Ron admitted.<br/> Grandpa Arthur reached out to cut the cake into slices. "Well, let's hope your inspiration reveals itself in the taste, as well," he said. Aunt Hermione was smiling tight-lipped, whilst stroking her husband's upper arm.<br/> The whole family having been served, they dug in. Victoire took the smallest bite she could manage without drawing unwanted attention. She was sure she could pass on eating the whole thing without much harrassment, though.<br/> "It's...good," Aunt Hermione said, making her husband smile, tentatively.<br/> "It's absolutely bloody rubbish, mate," said her Uncle George, earning a smack on the arm from his wife Angelina. "Well, it is!" he protested. "He's got to know, I can't just let his family suffer! I wouldn't be able to live with myself."<br/> Uncle Ron was looking expectantly at everyone else, his ears red as a beet. Uncle Harry cleared his throat, earning his life-long friend's full attention. "Well, it could use some improvement... but it's quite alright," he said, though Victoire was positively certain he was lying.<br/> "Thank you," Uncle Ron said, looking side-eyed at Uncle George - who was about to pitch in once more before his wife decided to intervene.<br/> "I think it's quite lovely, Ron," Aunt Angelina said, smiling sweetly.<br/> "Most importantly, though," said Teddy, who had abstained from commenting on the cake, "have you prepared your actual speciality?"<br/> "Yes I have, Teddy, thank you for reminding me," her Uncle said, and left the table only to return a minute later, levitating a large number of glasses filled with the traditional, alcohol-free firewhiskey.<br/> <em>Ah, good, more sugar</em>, Victoire thought.<br/> "My son occasionally likes to pretend he's drinking the real thing," Aunt Ginny said, nodding towards a disgruntled James. "Acts all roudy. It's the funniest thing," she said, smiling along with her husband Harry.<br/> "I do not!" James protested.<br/> "He can't possibily get any roudier than he already is, Ginny," said Teddy. "I think you've misunderstood your child." James agreed, emphatically.<br/> With a drink in their hand, the family began to disband, flocking in groups to this corner or the other. Seeing that Molly was planning on sticking close to her parents, Victoire decided to join her sister Dominique and their cousins James, Fred and Roxanne by the stairs.<br/> "We need a bloody plan," Fred sighed.<br/> "Plan?" asked James. "Plan for what?"<br/> "Dominique and I, I mean," Fred explained. "For the Quidditch try-outs. We need some sort of plan."<br/> "Honestly, I think we'll be fine," Dominique said.<br/> "Well but what if they throw some sort of curve ball at us?" Fred asked, with slumped shoulders.<br/> "Surely they won't," Victoire replied. "And even if they do, I'm sure you two will deal with it exemplarly," she reassured them. "You're both excellent fliers," Victoire said, smiling.<br/> Her sister made a prolongued Awww sound in response.<br/> "Cheers, Victoire," answered Fred, though sadness remained in his expression.<br/> "Wish we could go practice now, though," Dominique said.<br/> Roxanne was enthused at the idea. "Yeah! Let's go! Why can't we?"<br/> "Because it's nightime, you silly git," her brother said, slapping her delicately on the shoulder. "We'd crash onto the bloody roof."<br/> "Alright, everybody, gather round, gather round," said Uncle George, loud enough for the entire Potter-Weasley family to hear him. He was holding a mysterious bag in his hands, which drew the crowd in. "The game's the following: we all sit in a circle. Come one, sit in a circle, quickly."<br/> Victoire hurried near the fireplace - alas, Teddy had had the very same idea. Realising her hesitation, he said, amused: "I won't bite." She frowned slightly at him, sitting with crossed legs and a perfectly straight back.<br/> "Now, on the count of three, I'm going to throw this set of enchanted coins into the air," he said, revealing the contents of his bag, "and they're all going to start flying around each other, faster and faster. One of them is going to turn blue eventually, though it will harder to spot as time goes by and the coins move quicker and quicker. The first to grab hold of the blue coin, wins. The first to get tragically punched in the nose also wins. Begin!" he exclaimed, gleefully, as he threw a fistful of coins into the air. What followed, naturally, was chaos. To Mrs. Weasley's utter outrage, many of the child-friendly firewhiskey glasses had ended up spilling onto the floor, and the game finished with a hissy fit from Hugo, who had not only managed to grab the blue coin but also to be smacked in the eye by his cousin Lily. Despite his Uncle George's best efforts to explain to him how he had been twice a winner, the small, freckled seven year old boy remained unconvinced.<br/> Victoire rose, ready to join an already departing James, Roxanne, Fred and Dominique - but was enveloped in her mother's embrace before she could do so. "Alrrright, ma chérie?" she asked, and Victoire nodded as she felt her mother's intense, floral perfume. Holding her closer, her mother switched to French. "I think you do very well to watch your figure," she told her. "Don't let Grandma Molly bully you into growing all chubby. You're beautiful as you are, delicate and small," her mother said, planting a kiss on her temple.<br/> "Oui, mama," Victoire replied, gently pulling away from her arms. She wasn't sure whether to take this as validation or an insulting forewarning. Victoire pondered on it as she shuffled slowly towards her cousins.<br/> "Ohhhh, where's Teddy? He promised he'd help me with this blasted record player," complained Mrs. Weasley, pointing to a pitiful-looking record-playing device, unceremoniously ostracised to a dusty corner underneath the stairs. "Victoire, dear, could you please go find Teddy for me?" she asked.<br/> Pulled abruptly from her thoughts, Victoire nodded, and began to scan the room. In the midst of blonde, brunette and red heads, there was no Teddy to be found. <em>Must be outside, then</em>. "I'll go look for him outside," she announced, though Mrs. Weasley had since become distracted with a rather weepy Lily, who had scraped her knees running up the stairs.<br/> The night was warm, with only a gentle, late August breeze. Victoire dreaded the winter to come; like her mother, she had always been much more fond of warm weather, delighting in their yearly holidays in France.<br/> She spotted something.<em> Blue hair. Teddy</em>! What was he doing, mounted on his broom?<br/> "Teddy?" Victoire called, looking up, and the older boy turned his broom around to face her. "Grandma's looking for you. Says you promised to help her with the record player."<br/> "Ah," remembered Teddy, with a dramatic turn of his head. Was he drunk? How was he drunk? "I did promise...That can wait, though, night's still young. I'd like to go for a ride right now." Victoire frowned at him.<br/> "Did you... spike your own drink?" she asked him.<br/> "Yes," he replied. "Indeed I did."<br/> "And now you're mounted on a broom. At night time," she said, still frowning.<br/> " 'Twould seem that I am," he agreed. "Would you like to join me?" he asked, lowering himself onto the ground.<br/> Victoire staggered, unsure of what to say. "It's dangerous to fly at night. Low visibility. Mum would kill me."<br/> Teddy gave her a mischievious grin. "Well I won't tell if you don't." Victoire smiled tentatively, at that. "Plus, we're not really going to go far. Just...twirl around a bit."<br/> Victoire laughed. <em>Oh, what the hell!</em> "Alright, I'll join you for some moonlight twirling," she said, at which Teddy seemed genuinely pleased. She hopped onto the broom and put her arms around his waist with what she hoped was casual grace.<br/> Victoire was amazed at how an intoxicated Teddy could fly around which such control and finesse, delivering the promised twirling motions amid the occasionally-croaking frogflies. He seemed to take pleasure in making her giggle by taking slight dips downwards, only to swerve his broom back up right after. The night was getting chillier, but the colder air felt pleasant against Victoire's skin. After a while, he tired out, taking them both to the Burrow's highest roof, and dismounting with a satisfied sigh.<br/> "That was nice," he said, leaning back against the tiles.<br/> "It was," replied Victoire, propping her chin on her hands, elbows supported by her crossed legs. She couldn't believe she'd just done what even her little sister and cousins were sensible enough not to do. "You're an excellent flyer."<br/> "Thank you. You should come watch the Quidditch matches more often."<br/> She smiled. "D'you ever consider being a professional Quidditch player?"<br/> "Nah. Not a life I'd want to live. Too much competition. Too much emphasis on the physical. All a bit degrading, if you ask me."<br/> Victoire pondered on this. She'd never thought of it like that. She didn't think anyone did see it that way, besides Teddy. "Then what life do you want to live?"<br/> "Dunno. Haven't really thought about it. Or, I have, but I'm not too pleased with any of the options."<br/> "Don't you know what you're going to do after Hogwarts?" Victoire blurted, aghast.<br/> "Blimey, girl, have you been talking to my grandmother?"<br/> She recovered from her shock, and gave a short chuckle. "No. Just seems odd to me that someone could be on their final year at Hogwarts and not know what they're going to do next. I've known since my second year."<br/> "Yeah? What are you going to be, then?" asked Teddy, turning sideways and propping his head on his hand.<br/> "I'm going to work in the Ministry. In the Department of Mysteries. I'm good at Charms, and I'm good at Defense Against the Dark Arts. And I'm only fourteen; I still have time to improve. I think I stand a chance."<br/> Teddy smiled. "I'd say you do as well."<br/> Victoire turned away from his gaze, in an attempt not to blush. "Wouldn't you like to be an Auror?"<br/> Teddy's smile faded. "No," he said, lying down on his back again.<br/> "Why not?"<br/> "Because I wouldn't want to kill anyone."<br/> "Oh."<br/> There was silence after this. Victoire had the growing sensation that she was bombarding him with questions, but she didn't know what else to do. "What does it feel like? To be a metamorphmagus?"<br/> Teddy let out a short, high-pitched laugh. "Excillerating. And absolutely terrifying at the same time."<br/> "How so?" asked Victoire.<br/> "Well, I can change into whatever shape I want, and that's great. I could just... slowly morph my features into more handsome shapes through the years and everyone would think I just got hotter. But, on the other hand... there's no... Teddy. Teddy is this, Teddy is that, Teddy can be absolutely bloody everything. But if Teddy can be absolutely bloody everything, then there's nothing that separates him from the rest of the world. Where's the line? Between me and what lies outside of me? There is none, there is no me. There's a personality, sure, but our physical selfs are... you know, embodied manifestations of our personalities. Or end up being, through the years. Laugh lines, from a good sense of humor, scars, from a foolhardiness, dark circles, from insomnia or irresponsability. I can change all of that in the blink of an eye. Maybe one day I'll forget what I even looked like at all."<br/> Victoire thought this strange, too, though she had begun to expect strange things from Teddy. "You could try constantly looking at yourself in the mirror. Then you wouldn't forget."<br/> "No, I hate looking at myself in the mirror." Victoire bulged her eyes at this. <em>Is he blind? Does he not see his perfectly square jaw, berry-red lips and perfect cheekbones?</em><br/> Teddy continued. "But yes, I do suppose it is rather nice to be a walking amorphous blob." He smiled, lightening his previous tone. "Endless possibilities. A bit chaotic, really. And just <em>too</em> easy, to be honest with you. Anything I don't like about myself I could just...change. No need for any character-developing insecurities."<br/> Victoire chuckled, thinking out loud before she could stop herself. "Don't see how you could have them, anyway."<br/> Teddy sat up and caught her gaze. "Have you got a <em>crush</em> on me, Victoire?" he asked, smiling.<br/> "No," she replied, in a panic.<br/> Teddy laughed. "Ha, well, your lovely blushing cheeks say otherwise." The compliment only managed to deepen the redness of her cheeks. "You're lucky I'm a bit drunk, or I'd tell your mother."<br/> "Oh, shut up."<br/> Teddy laughed. "So would <em>you</em> like to be a metamorphmagus?" An almost mute <em>Yeah</em> was her reply. "What would you change about yourself, hmm?" he asked.<br/> The answer came to her too quickly. "Make myself skinnier," she said.<br/> "Oh, come on. I was only joking, earlier. Come on, have you looked at yourself? With that blonde mane," he described, making Victoire's stomach twist into a not. "Those big Veela eyes. And that figure. Not bad for a fourteen year old, not bad at all. I tell you, I'm rather flattered to be crushed on by such a sweet young thing," he said, jokingly.<br/> "I <em>don't</em> have a crush on you," she insisted. How cruel of her to mock her so.<br/> "No? Then why are you blushing? Hmm?" he asked, alternately grabbing hold of both her arms inbetween gentle pokes to her stomach. "Why is sweet, prim Victoire blushing?"<br/> "Stop it, stop it!" she said, in what could only be described as panicked giggles.<br/> "Alright, I will stop it," he said, his voice barely audible because of Victoire's laughter. "But under one condition only: you've got to give me a kiss."<br/> Victoire stared at him, wide-eyed. She couldn't tell whether he was joking or not.<br/> "Just one," he repeated, dark-eyed. It would seem he was serious.<br/> "Just one? And you'll leave the matter alone? And you won't tell anyone?" asked Victoire, hesitatingly.<br/> Teddy made a mock face of utmost sincerity. "I swear it on Merlin's beard." His hold on her wrists had loosened.<br/> She timidly moved forwards for a small peck - but before she could complete the motion, Teddy caught hold of her surprised face and brought his lips swiftly to hers. His kiss was gentle - and strangely elegant, considering his state of inebriation. It was like he was leading her to exactly where he wanted to go, in a steady, carefree rythmn, his tongue probing her mouth ever so gently. She couldn't hear the frogflies anymore; the kiss was all that there was, at that moment. And Merlin, did it feel <em>wonderful</em>. As the seconds passed, she felt him getting closer and closer to her, until there was nothing standing in between their bodies and his hand was around her waist, holding it firmly. Probably catching hold of himself, he slowed his pace, bringing their kiss to an end with a gentle bite to her lower lip. They faced each other with their eyes closed, for a few seconds.<br/> "Tribute accepted," he said, snapping Victoire out of her daze. "Come on. We should be getting back," Teddy concluded, grabbing hold of his broom. "That record player isn't going to fix itself."<br/> It took her a few seconds to move - but she did, jumping onto Teddy's broom in stunned silence. He flew them swiftly downwards and waited for her to dismount before jogging gracefully towards the Burrow's main entrance, leaving her in his wake.</p>
