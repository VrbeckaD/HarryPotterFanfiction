    <p>You never know how long a war is going to last. When he was still a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, James Potter had an abstract idea of what a war was. He had noticed the way his mother’s eyes hardened during the summer break before his seventh year, or how her hugs became a little longer and tighter. Inside the school, he had felt the rising tension, had heard the whispered secrets and endless rumours, all the names people were being called. Being Head Boy, he had been aware of every incident and attack on muggleborn students and could not ignore their increased frequency. He had volunteered to be part of the Order of the Phoenix before he had even graduated. But still, the castle walls had offered protection and a kind of blissful ignorance he would never get back. Nothing could have prepared him for the reality of the war.</p><p> </p><p>It was the end of June now, almost a year since he’d joined the Order. His life now comprised of hours of intel gathering, order missions, and the Marauders’ weekly mandatory visit to <em>the Pixies. </em>After about a month of fighting in the order, Peter had declared it an obligation for his mental health, and James had to admit that during particularly grueling weeks, just entering the wooden walls of the bar made him feel like he could breathe again. At the beginning, they’d tried to implement a <em>no-talking-about-the-Order</em> rule, but they’d soon found out that they needed to talk about it. Besides, they really didn’t have much else to talk about, except when Remus talked about his garden, or when Peter started reminiscing about their school years. But James didn’t like to think about the past too much. There were things from his Hogwarts days - one thing in particular, if he was being honest - that he’d rather forget.</p><p> </p><p>Today was <em>Pixies</em> day and James needed it. He’d had a long day, standing around in front of someone’s house for hours to ensure their safety. He knew it wasn’t the healthiest way of seeing things, but without a doubt, he preferred the more dangerous missions. Dueling was exhilarating. It made him feel alive, but most of all, useful. Today nothing had happened, like most days, and James didn’t even know whose house he had spent six hours guarding. Maybe he hadn’t even protected a person but an object. Or maybe there was nothing there, just a way to confuse their enemies. Dumbledore liked to speak in riddles, to keep all the necessary information to himself, and James understood that it was to protect their organisation, but he still came home from these missions feeling frustrated and useless. Fighting a war was a lot of waiting. That’s one thing he hadn’t imagined when he was still Head Boy.</p><p> </p><p>Even now, he was waiting. He’d come back from his mission almost an hour ago, and had been tempted to go home without reporting to Dumbledore - nothing had happened anyway – but Frank had told him that the old man wished to speak with him. So there he was, sitting in front of Dumbledore’s office, hearing only muffled voices and hoping these voices would hurry with what sounded like a fight. He could recognize the old man’s disembodied voice, but the wizard seemed to be speaking to a woman James couldn’t identify. He clearly knew the voice, but it wasn’t Dorcas, or Marlene, or even Mary, who rarely raised her voice at anyone anyway. James knew the person speaking, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it.</p><p>Not one to give up easily, he was getting closer to the door to try and figure out who the mystery voice belonged to, when the conversation in the headmaster’s office stopped and James heard footsteps getting closer. He jumped back to the chair in front of the door, looking down at his hand and back up, already painting a surprised look on his face. Growing up with Sirius had taught him to be a decent actor.</p><p> </p><p>However, his expression soon morphed into real surprise when he saw who had opened the door. Pale skin scattered with freckles, dark red hair, shorter than in his memory, and green eyes, wide-open. It seemed Lily Evans had not planned to see him either. Before she could talk, James got up and spoke, hoping his voice wouldn’t betray how much he was feeling right now. She didn’t deserve to make him feel things. Not anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, it’s <em>you</em>.”</p><p> </p>
