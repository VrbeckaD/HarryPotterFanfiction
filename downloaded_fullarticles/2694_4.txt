<hr/><p> </p><p>„But what if they don’t like me?“ He muttered nervously, fumbling at his navy blue bow tie as he did.</p><p>You only shook your head as you gave your boyfriend a shy smile and then gently took his hand to squeeze it lightly.</p><p>“They will <em>love </em>you, Newt. But I have to forewarn you… my mother is very… passionate about Christmas. She always exaggerates with the decoration and the food and all.”</p><p>“That’s fine.” Newt smiled kindly. “It’s been a long time since I celebrated Christmas with family.”</p><p>And it was exactly why you had brought him to meet yours this year. Newt and you had been a couple for about half a year now. Just out of Hogwarts, your new job allowed you to travel a lot lately, which one day led to you stumbling upon the infamous magizoologist. You had heard about him before, for apparently he had caused a huge mess in New York with his suitcase full of magical creatures and then saved the city from Gellert Grindelwald himself; and it didn’t take you long to fall in love with the soft Hufflepuff. Quickly, you had learned that despite he had Pickett and Dougal and Frank and so many more incredible creatures, he was lonely.</p><p><em>“People avoid me.”</em> He had told you. <em>“I annoy them.”</em></p><p>Well certainly, Newt didn’t annoy you and after raving about him whenever you visited your parents in London, they had become quite curious to be introduced to the young man. You had no doubt, whatsoever that they would like him. He really was a charming and kind man, after all.</p><p>You smiled as you squeezed his hand once more. This was going to be the most wonderful Christmas yet.</p>
<hr/><p>“(Y/N)! It is so great to see you! Oh and you must be Newt Scamander! (Y/N) has told us <em>so much</em> about you! Such a handsome young man!” Your mother shouted happily when she spotted Newt standing next to you in the threshold, hurtling towards him with a red apron around her waist and immediately pulling him into a tight hug before cupping his cheeks.</p><p>Newt, seemingly surprised, gasped for air before he politely returned her warm smile.</p><p>“It is a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. (Y/L/N).” He said as he shook her hand and then let her hug you briefly.</p><p>“The pleasure is all mine. Please, call me (Y/M/N). There’s no formalities needed. It’s Christmas after all and besides, you’re already part of the family, now aren’t you?”</p><p>“Oh, I… I would be honoured to be considered…” He didn’t get to finish his sentence, having you shrug apologetically.</p><p>Eagerly, your mother tucked her arm into his as she dragged him into the living room. You hadn’t promised too much. As usual, every single piece of furniture was equipped with Christmas decoration, the whole house smelling like cookies, cinnamon, tea and mince pies.</p><p>“Please, my dear, come in. Dinner will be ready in a few minutes, you have come <em>just in time</em>.” And with that, she disappeared back in the kitchen, a cheerful Christmas song on her lips.</p><p>In the middle of the room, there was a huge Christmas tree, decorated with silver candles, moving ornaments, candy canes, laughing snowmen and silver stars. Neatly wrapped presents underneath it completed the gorgeous picture.</p><p>The most breath-taking aspect, however, were the floating silver candles high up in the air and drowning the whole room in a cosy and Christmassy atmosphere.</p><p>Your father was sitting on the old leather couch, flipping the pages of today’s newspaper. He looked up with utter interest when Newt entered, politely nodding his head in his direction as he watched him putting it on the small table next to the couch and then getting up to greet your boyfriend properly.</p><p>“Mr. Scamander, am I correct?”</p><p>“Yes sir.”</p><p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you, please come in. Make yourself at home.” Shaking his hand respectfully, he gestured into the living room.</p><p>As you watched him seating himself rather shyly on the leather couch, a grin appeared on your lips. Giggling, you put the presents you had brought for both your parents and Newt under the Christmas tree and then sat beside him, taking his hand to comfort him a little. Although he was still obviously nervous, it had been a good start already.</p>
<hr/><p>“So, Mr. Scamander… (Y/N) said you are writing for a living, is that correct?” Frowning slightly, you swallowed the piece of pie in your mouth.</p><p>“Yes sir, I am writing a book about the magical creatures I am studying.”</p><p>“And are you being successful thus far? Surely, you have a profession beside that.”</p><p>“Ahhh, I don’t sir, I have dedicated myself to my creatures. I am travelling a lot, you see. But I make ends meet. I have already handed in the first few chapters and thus far, the reactions have been <em>very</em> positive.” Instantly, you felt yourself smiling again as you watched your boyfriend talk about his book. He was so dedicated, so passionate. It was one of the many things you loved about him.</p><p>“But don’t you think you should settle down at some point? How do you want to guarantee my daughter safety like this? You can’t know if you will be able to <em>live </em>with the earnings of your book.”</p><p>“<em>Dad</em>, please…” You began quietly, looking down at your plate rather embarrassed. You knew your dad wasn’t trying to be rude or mean, however, he had always been very concerned about your well-being.</p><p>“We are fine, Dad. I travel with him. If only I could tell you about the many places of the world we have seen already. Newt’s suitcase is… well, it’s like a little… well, a <em>huge </em>apartment. It’s where we live when we’re on the road and when we’re not and when Newt is working on his book, we live at my place.” You explained quickly, gently placing your palm on your boyfriend’s thigh under the table to calm him down a bit. You had noticed him tensing next to you and it kind of seemed like he had lost his appetite.</p><p>“E-exactly, Mr. (Y/L/N). Also, I have a lot of savings at Gringotts. I promise you that I will take good care of your daughter.”</p><p>Your mother smiled cordially. “You’ve heard him, (Y/D/N). I’m sure these two lovebirds are doing absolutely fine, isn’t that right, Newt?”</p><p>“Yes, Ma’am.”</p><p>“Now, let’s clean up. (Y/N), will you help me? It’s late already, we should be getting to handing out the presents before it’s time to sleep.”</p><p>“Of course. Will you be okay?”</p><p>Newt nodded bravely. Being left alone with your dad wasn’t exactly what he preferred but given he didn’t want to appear impolite, he jumped in at the deep end. You, however, knew that he didn’t have to sweat it at all already. Your dad liked him, whether he showed it like your mother did or not.</p><p>And it worked out quite well. After any and all plates, glasses and cutlery was hovering in the air to be cleaned magically and you and your mother returned to the festively decorated living room, Newt and your father were having an eager and exuberant conversation about snitches.</p><p>“We should prepare the tree, sweetheart.” Your mother told your dad intently as you walked towards Newt to join him in the threshold of the door, smiling in a relieved manner as you did. Your father obliged immediately, granting the two of you a little privacy.</p><p>“See?” You whispered, taking his hands into yours. “They love you as much as I do.”</p><p>“It feels great to be accepted.” He admitted shyly, crossing his still sweaty fingers with yours.</p><p>Smiling, you stood on your toes to sweetly press your lips against his. Above you, there was a dew-fresh mistletoe. You giggled when Pickett, who just peeked out behind Newt’s collar, approved by clapping his branch-like hands. “Merry Christmas, Newt.”</p><p>“Merry Christmas, (Y/N).”</p>
