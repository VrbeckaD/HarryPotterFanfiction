    <p>This story is set in an AU where three and four way relationships are normal and not that uncommon. Another not so uncommon thing in this AU is a relationship between two family members that can not actually have a child (father/son, mother/daughter, ect). I will not accept any hate what so ever on this story. If this story does interest you the first chapter will be out at some point this evening (probably about 7ish GMT). Oh and there's Alpha/Beta/Omega dynamics.</p>
