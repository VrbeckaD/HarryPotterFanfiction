    <p class="p1">
  <em>Green flashed in the corners of her eyes, and Narcissa knew she was dreaming again. She wished she didn’t know; it did nothing to stop the terror.</em>
</p><p class="p1"><em>Moonlight reflected off the tombs of the graveyard, and she felt sick. This was worse than she or Orvan had speculated. Peter Pettigrew—spineless Pettigrew, who didn’t have a single thought in his head that James Potter did not put there—was a Death Eater. He’d been a Death Eater for a long time, apparently, and how could she have not </em>known <em>that. Pettigrew, who her cousin Sirius Black was supposed to have killed. Siri, the bullheaded traitor who she’d been forbidden from speaking to, and who she’d hated since he’d proven to not only be a blood-traitor, but a disloyal one at that. He hovered in the dreamscape, behind Potter and Diggory and just to the side of where she was hidden, and he winked over at her.</em></p><p class="p1">
  <em>“Prissy Cissy, hiding like a naughty kid?” he whispered, grinning.</em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em>“I’m sorry!” she wanted to wail, but couldn’t force herself to move. If Pettigrew hadn’t gone completely mad, then he was holding what remained of her ex-husband’s Lord, with the intent to revive him again. </em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em>“Kill the spare!” </em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em>The Killing curse collided with the tombstone she’d summoned in front of the Hufflepuff champion, in real life, and he’d ducked at the sight of the chunk of stone flying towards him. This time, she blinked, and Siri was in front of him. Siri was dead, body hovering just above the ground and smirking even in death, and both Potter’s and Diggory’s bodies lay under him. She’d done nothing to stop it. </em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em>The scene flipped and the Dark Lord was in front of her, fully returned in a body twisted horribly by Dark Magic. Cedric and Harry were tied to the gravestone, as they had been in life while the Pettigrew fought her and completed the ceremony, but here they were husks. A cold hand grabbed her chin, and jerked her back to stare into red eyes. Theories about the how and what Dark Magic could do to the body flashed in front of her eyes, unhelpful as the world closed in around her.</em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em>“You think to defy me?” he whispered. Harry’s head slowly creaked towards her, face dull and a chalky grey-brown. ‘Run,’ rigid lips mouthed. ‘Run!’ </em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em>“Crucio!”</em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em>She screamed. It was all she could do.</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Cissa! Narcissa!”</p><p class="p1">She startled awake. Someone was hovering over her, and she jerked back, curled into a shaking ball until the person’s blurry lines resolved themselves into Kingsley. He was still in the loose robes aurors wore around the office, though his cap was missing, and he’d taken his earring out. He was kneeling in front of her. Her legs felt itchy and uncomfortable, and she realized she was wearing a muggle pencil skirt and their thin, impractical stockings. She was on his couch, and they were in his living room.</p><p class="p1">Why were they in his living room?</p><p class="p1">“Do you want to talk about it?” Kingsley asked tentatively.</p><p class="p1">She shook her head. Behind him, on the coffee table, were two clear cylindrical boxes with steaming plates of pasta. One had an even smaller box with a cupcake inside. They were tied together with a ribbon, deep purple with shining white doves flying from one end to the other. “Riti’s?” she asked.</p><p class="p1">“Well,” Kingsley shifted uncomfortably, though a smile tugged at his lips. “Since you sounded serious when you said we needed to talk, I thought it might help if I buttered you up a bit.”</p><p class="p1">The reason she was here came back to her. Tomorrow was going to be her first day back as a consultant after the Tournament, and Kingsley was still acting guilty around her. She’d asked if she could come over to talk, since both their working and romantic relationship was being weighed down by both the events leading up to the Tournament, and those during. She’d even walked to his home, a flat in the middle of muggle London, to give herself time to form what she wanted to say.</p><p class="p1">She snorted. “It would work better if you hadn’t told me you intended to manipulate me,” she told him.</p><p class="p1">He opened his mouth to protest, then closed it and shrugged. “It is not my strong suit,” he admitted.</p><p class="p1">“It <em>is</em> mine, however.” She smiled as she helped him to his feet. “Come up here so we can eat.” She got to her feet as well, and hooked her fingers under the ribbon to grab the boxes as he led her to his tiny kitchen table.</p><p class="p1">As they ate, Narcissa’s mind wandered. If she’d been told as a child that she would be perfectly content being divorced at over forty and eating barefoot with a man at a worn, muggle-made kitchen table, she would have lamented at losing her mind in adulthood. As an adult, however, there was no place she’d rather be. Even with the strains in their relationship, this was the most comfortable she could remember being in the presence of a partner.</p><p class="p1">The clink of Kingsley laying his fork down brought her back to reality. “So,” he said, folding his hands in his lap and gaze resting solemly on her. “You wished to talk?”</p><p class="p1">“Yes,” she nodded, gathering her resolve. Her shoulders and waist felt cold; she’d be much comfortable if Kingsley were holding her. There was the chance that she would stay silent, though, if he did. “Yes. Do you trust me, darling?”</p><p class="p1">Kingsley blinked. It seemed to take him a moment to realize that this was the conversation she wanted to have, and his eyes widened when he did. “Of course! Why would—there’s no—” He took a deep breath. “Of course I trust you.”</p><p class="p1">“When Mitch and I came to you,” she began, but Kingsley interrupted.</p><p class="p1">“Idiocy. I was being an idiot, and it won’t happen again,” he promised, leaning forward and extending his hand towards her. She glared, and cleared her throat. “Ah—my apologies for the interruption. Continue.” He leaned back in his chair. His hand stayed on the table.</p><p class="p1">“You might realize that now,” Narcissa continued, folding her fingers together to stop herself from taking his hand. “But there was a reason you didn’t trust us. You <em>didn’t</em> trust us in that moment, Kingsley, don’t try to deny it! And I’ve been going over that conversation in my head, and the moment you stopped even trying to consider our argument was when I brought up the information I got from Lucius.” Her former husband had looked awful, and vengeful, when she came, and it had been a short conversation before he’d led half the floor in taunting and jeering at her.</p><p class="p1">“I…” Kingsley swallowed, and fell silent. The line of his jaw was tense.</p><p class="p1">“Did you not trust me, with him?” she asked. He grew even more tense, and her heart sank as that gave her the answer. “Kingsley, look at me.” He slowly raised his head, mouth twisted as he met her eyes. “Tell me.”</p><p class="p1">“I don’t think you’d cheat on me,” he burst out. “Not then, and not now. As I said, I trust you. I just—you were married to him, for twenty years, and I wondered if you didn’t have a…blind spot, in regards to him. It sounds—”</p><p class="p1">“Reasonable,” Narcissa cut him off. Kingsley quirked an eyebrow at her. She blushed, but defended herself. “I called for this conversation, I get to break my own rules about interruption.”</p><p class="p1">This got a bark of laughter out of Kingsley, and he finally relaxed. After a moment, he grew serious. “Reasonable, you said?”</p><p class="p1">She nodded. “I would ask you to trust my judgement in regards to him, in the future, since presently I regard him with nothing more than contempt. But your worries are not…unfounded.” He blinked, and frowned. “I loved him, especially during the first years of our marriage. Even if I didn’t care for him the same by the time of the World Cup, we were still a team, as close as you and any other Auror are, and if Draco hadn’t been hurt I likely would have stayed loyal to him even as the Dark Lord started his reign again. You’d have every right to question my judgement, in that light. But Kingsley, how do you think you fare, in comparison?”</p><p class="p1">Kingsley’s frown deepened, and he looked horribly confused. “I…I’m aware that you love me,” he said. “Obviously, Lucius and your son Draco take up more space in your heart than I do, since your relationship has lasted longer. Your son will stay that way, of course, and I…I hope that we will come to be a team in the way that you and Lucius were, in the way that I think you want. I’m content now, though, with just knowing you love me.”</p><p class="p1">Narcissa sighed. Her heart was in her throat, with what she was about to admit. “In the years between our wedding and the time Draco went to Hogwarts for the first time, Lucius and I have only had one disgreement. Lucius wanted him to go to Drumstrang; I did not.” She’d wanted her son close, yes, but she’d also thought the Drumstrang Headmaster was a self-serving coward, with no loyalty to name or family. Any connection Lucius thought he had, she knew would fall through the second Karkaroff was pushed. Dumbledore, even if they’d both agreed he was a Muggle-loving fool, stuck to his convictions and strived to protect Hogwarts as a whole. “When we fought, it was a rancorous battle. We dueled, and refused to listen to each other for months. My own home was a frigid war zone. I won, but only through threatening and stubbornness. Not once did we work together through it. To this day I don’t know why he prefered Drumstrang over our old school, besides connections he might have there.”</p><p class="p1">“Why are you telling me this?” Kingsley asked slowly.</p><p class="p1">“To say that,” Narcissa swallowed, and pushed herself to say what she meant. “To say that despite our love not being as…nurtured as mine and Lucius’ was in the beginning, we are already a team in a way he and I never were. You are important to me, Kingsley. Please know this.”</p><p class="p1">Kingsley blinked, still looking lost. “You consider the argument we had…”</p><p class="p1">“It should have been as bad as that,” Narcissa said. “I half-expected it to be that bad. But you came to me, and we talked calmly, and not once in these months have I felt you weren’t prepared to listen after the first time.”</p><p class="p1">“That one time nearly got you and Mitchell killed,” Kingsley said gruffly, and he was tense again.</p><p class="p1">“Not even Mitch or I accounted for a crazed escaped criminal having the actual Dark Lord on his side,” she told him firmly. “We’ve both already forgiven you, darling.”</p><p class="p1">She finally reached across the table and took his hand, rubbing her thumb across the back of it until he relaxed again. “Fine,” he said. A smile slowly grew on his face. “Fine!” He suddenly flipped her hand, reaching over to grab her waist with his other hand, and she shrieked as he pulled her around the table into his lap. “We are a team?” he asked, laying a quick peck on her lips before she could answer.</p><p class="p1">“Yes,” she giggled.</p><p class="p1">He kissed her again. “We trust each other?”</p><p class="p1">“Yes,” she said, smiling, and kissed him deeply. She shifted, so she was fully straddling his lap.</p><p class="p1">He pulled back, eyes nearly black and the inside of his bottom lip pulled to a deep red. “And you love me?”</p><p class="p1">She nodded, pressing her body closer to his. “And you?” she whispered.</p><p class="p1">“I love you,” he said, kissing her deeply before pulling back, laying a trail of kisses across her face, down her neck, and further. “Love you, love you, love you…”</p><p class="p1">---</p><p class="p1">Dirt, Harry thought, was the only thing in his life that he could trust right now. He shifted in the flowerbeds below the living room window of Number 4 Privet Drive. Ron and Hermione were both apparently too busy with their summer to write him about what was actually happening in the wizarding world. Draco was off vacationing with Blaise Zabini for the first part of the summer—something about studying the magical flux at the northern lights—and couldn’t get his owls anyway. Cedric Diggory, though he said he believed him and would support him publicly, hadn’t answered a single owl he’d sent.</p><p class="p1">Not even the muggle news was trustworthy—he’d been kicked out of the living room while Vernon and Petunia while they watched it, since they thought it was suspicious that he was interested in the goings-on of the world. He’d taken to sitting out in the flowerbeds unter the living room window, trying to hear even a hint of anything unusual, but there was nothing.</p><p class="p1">Draco’s mum, of all people, was the only one who came close to telling him anything.</p><p class="p1">Narcissa, as she insisted he call her, wouldn’t tell him what she was working on, but at least let him know she was working on <em>something </em>to fight Voldemort, even if covertly. She also told him of how Fudge was reacting, and how she thought the departments were responding to that, and talked a lot of the politics of it in general. He didn’t always understand everything Narcissa talked about—he nearly wrote to ask Hermione if she had any books on magical law and politics, but then remembered he was mad at her, and got angry at both her and Ron all over again—but he had an idea.</p><p class="p1">The best parts were when she talked about the curses she was studying. The first time she wrote, she told him the paper she’d sent was cursed to melt the skin of anyone who wasn’t the person it was written to, and to respond on the back of it. He’d wrote back eagerly, asking her what other curses she was studying, and if there was anything to fight Voldemort. She’d said no, but she had a few ideas, and from then on each letter had a general description—not enough to get her in trouble, she assured him, after he’d expressed his worry—of the tomes or cursed objects she was reviewing. Her last letter was tucked in his back pocket, since he hadn’t finished writing down the things he wanted to research (In code. He thought she’d appreciate what he’d come up with, and resolved to tell her the next time they talked in person.), and he liked to take it out and imagine jealously what it would be like to work with such things.</p><p class="p1">A bang broke him out of his thoughts, and he shot up. This turned out not to be a good idea, and he let out a yell of pain as his head cracked against the windowsill.</p><p class="p1">There was a scramble from inside, and Vernon Dursley leaned out of the window.</p><p class="p1">“Wha—boy!” He grabbed a fistful of Harry’s hair and pulled him up. “What the ruddy hell are you doing out here?”</p><p class="p1">“Listening to the news,” he grit out, trying not to struggle. “Like I <em>told</em> you.”</p><p class="p1">“Again!” Vernon’s face twisted up in a scowl.</p><p class="p1">“Well, it changes every day,” Harry said blithely, and Vernon shook him.</p><p class="p1">“Don’t take that impudent tone with me, you little—” His uncle looked over Harry’s shoulder, and choked on his sentence. “Hello, Mrs. Duhigg!” Harry turned in the limited radius Vernon gave him, and they smiled until Mrs. Duhigg was out of sight. Vernon turned back to Harry. “I don’t know what funny business you’re hoping to see, but you won’t get it in my house. Go, boy, and I don’t want to see you back here until dinner.”</p><p class="p1">He shook him again, and then let go. Harry stumbled to his feet. “Fine,” he groused. “News was boring today, anyway.”</p><p class="p1">He forcefully walked down the road, but then slowed as he knew he was out of sight from the house. There was another reason he was so hungry for news. The houses of Privet Drive were more stifling than they had ever been, even when he’d come back from his first year at Hogwarts. There was a constant feeling of choking, of itching, whenever he allowed himself to actually stop and think. His thoughts always turned back to the one place he didn’t want them to go in these times, too.</p><p class="p1">The Triwizard Tournament.</p><p class="p1">The graveyard.</p><p class="p1">Voldemort.</p><p class="p1">Harry had thought he was an alright duelist, after practicing with Hermione and Draco, and later with them and Ron, but Pettigrew had disarmed and bound him easily, and would have killed Cedric if Narcissa hadn’t followed them. Narcissa herself had struggled to fight off Pettigrew, who had Voldemort whispering in his ear and clutching at his skin and robes. Cedric helped for a while, before Voldemort had laughed and blasted them back. He’d been toying with them. Harry had tried to struggle away, but couldn’t stop Pettigrew taking his blood. Couldn’t stop Voldemort from being ressurected. Couldn’t stop the call of Death Eaters. Couldn’t keep Draco’s mum from being tortured into unconsciousness.</p><p class="p1">He, in possibly the worst showing of a Gryffindor ever, had only been able to let ghosts fight his battles. He could only run, while they helped him, over to where Cedric and Narcissa were bound. He could only grab at their bindings and summon the championship cup.</p><p class="p1">He sighed, kicking at a pebble in front of him as he walked. Draco’s mum was already unconscious. Cedric was already terrified. What had he done, really?</p><p class="p1">Another bang, like the one earlier, had him pulling his wand out and pointing it at the figure that had appeared two houses up from him. “Mister Potter!” it gasped, walking quickly towards him. He blinked, and the figure resolved into Narcissa Black, running across the road to him in a heavy looking brocade robe and high heels.</p><p class="p1">“Mrs.—Narcissa?” he gaped. She stopped a couple feet from him, holding up her hands placatingly. “What are you—how do you know where I live?”</p><p class="p1">“I don’t,” she said. “I just—I hope you’ll forgive me, Mister Potter, but I’ve placed a few other spells the paper our correspondence is on.” She looked around worriedly. “I imagine Headmaster Dumbledore has the very best protection around you, and I didn’t intend this particular spell for <em>you</em> but more to tell if your mail was captured, and by who.”</p><p class="p1">“What are you talking about?” Harry demanded. “You’ve been spying on me?”</p><p class="p1">“No!” Narcissa said, eyes widening. “I merely placed a spell to detect Dark objects in the vicinity of the paper, and a loadstone that allows me to apparate if I feel it necessary, though I wouldn’t know where I’d apparated to.”</p><p class="p1">Harry blinked, intrigued despite himself. “Detects Dark objects?” he questioned. “Wouldn’t the letter have to count itself, then?”</p><p class="p1">“A fascinating bit of spellwork to allow for that exception,” she told him. She grabbed his shoulder and started marching him in front of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“One I am happy to explain to you, once we are back wherever your residence is, since from the signature I thought I’d end up outside Azkaban.”</p><p class="p1">Harry stumbled, but guided them back towards Privet Drive. Then, his brain processed what she was implying, and he stopped and turned to face her. “The letter detected something? Is Voldemort attacking?”</p><p class="p1">“Harry!” she snapped, and he turned back around.</p><p class="p1">“Right, yeah,” he said, and waved for her to follow him. They started walking again. “Definitely something dark, then. My house is this way, though I can’t say you’ll get the warmest welcome. The Dursleys, my mum’s muggle family, don’t take all that well to wizards, and you’re kind of all wizard-ed out. You probably—”</p><p class="p1">A hair-raising yell interrupted him, and as they turned the corner, Harry’s blood went cold. Darkness engulfed the whole street, and two dementors hovered as boys he recognized from Dudley’s gang ran in the opposite direction. Under them, limp and splayed across the ground, was Dudley.</p>
