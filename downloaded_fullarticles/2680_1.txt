<p>"My potion shop is in <em>Knockturn</em>."</p>
<p>"My book shop is in Diagon," Hermione said from the depths of the window display. "And your shop is connected to mine through that door." She gestured absently toward the back of the shop. "Logically, that means your shop is in also in Diagon."</p>
<p>"Lies. I never agreed to this."</p>
<p>She ignored him. "And you are my boyfriend and therefore you are participating. I picked out that costume specifically for you. It's perfect. Pale, spends most of the time in a dark room, strange clouds of smoke drifting through doorways." </p>
