  <span>Title:Bane’s Judas</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Summary:</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magnus Bane never expected to take in a baby, let alone a Warlock baby.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yet Ragnor showed him a boy who had nothing no protection and no parents.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Ragnor hadn’t found him the boy would have been raised to become a weapon for a war he was born into, yet it all changed when Magnus took the boy into his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had promised to raise him, keep him safe. Christening the boy Judas James, James in memory of his mother and her husband. A man who had been so accepting of a boy that wasn’t his, granted the man didn’t know his son was a warlock.</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Private Drive was a peaceful neighborhood, so quiet that nothing had dared to disturb it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was until this night came to be when a warlock visited the street late at night the air was cool and filled with the scent of crisp leaves falling from trees to the cold earth. The street lamps were the only things illuminating the road, his eyes gazed upon the peaceful neighborhood stopping on the home of number 4 the warlock was known to many as Magnus Bane one of the oldest warlocks’ to be known.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a simple home from what Magnus could see, barely looking any different than any other home on the street. An old friend of the warlock’s stood underneath the light, his arms cradling a bundle of blankets with such care to anyone else they would have thought the bundle was the most fragile item in the world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ragnor, it’s been a long while.”He called out, his voice carried through the air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve kept me waiting Magnus, we were suppose to meet at Godric’s Hallow” the man replied with a tone of annoyance and a hint of stress. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You had claimed to have found a child born between a descendant witch of Merlin and an ancient, a far rare breed it would even be just a wistful whisper of a mad man’s dream. You cannot expect my doubts of such a union Ragnor.” Magnus spoke during the conversation he had stopped a couple feet from Ragnor. His eyes moving from contact with the warlock’s to the bundle, a peek of a soft cheek flushed a little from the cold could be seen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you expected me to slipped into madness? I would have thought myself as well one year ago, if it weren’t for what I witnessed and the secrets I found hidden away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>You remember the war that held on this land recently?” Ragnor spoke his eyes never leaving Magnus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The terrorist Tom Riddle causing havoc in the Ministry of England, not as grand and terrifying as Grindelwald you have to admit but he does have more creativity.”was the response Magnus gave, Magnus had kept tabs on the war only to see how far Tom had gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Being able to make anybody fear to say your name took time and manipulation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This war was different, Albus crossed the line this time” Ragnor spoke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Crossed the line you say?” Now Magnus was interested. In his long experience of knowing Ragnor Magnus has never seen him so easily scared, the deep paranoia and fear that any of their kind felt from not mortals or shadowhunters’.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let us get out of here, return to my cottage where it is warmer and out of the ears and eyes of this place.”Ragnor spoke, his eyes glancing towards a house where an inch of curtain was drawn back. I would seem Albus had already placed eyes around this neighborhood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magnus with ease created a portal, letting Ragnor pass he stopped his friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You seriously aren’t thinking of taking this child?”His humor filled smile slipped from his face at Ragnor’s expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mundanes aren’t capable of taking care of the kind of being this child is.”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>As Ragnor walked past a small piece of the blanket shifted revealing the babe’s small arm, the mark looked similar to a tattoo, a triangle surrounding a circle and a line going through the said circle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Following his friend closely the portal closed behind him leaving no sign of the two or the babe they had taken with them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once into the warm homely cottage Magnus moved to stand by the fireplace,he stared at his friend who sat down across from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Explain.”was the only word Magnus said, even if it was just some word the heaviness behind it was all the hint Ragnor needed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A year ago, I was walking through the Forbidden Forest in Scotland to enjoy stretching my legs. It wasn’t long until I realized the forest was silent, as if something was roaming around that could kill you even if you breath.Naturally I went to inspect what could have caused such a silence in a forest of magic, I followed dozens of tracts till it ended at a clearing. I approached with caution and saw a young witch arguing with Albus, I recognized the young woman being an old student at his school Lily Evans a muggleborn witch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I stayed and listened hearing about Albus explaining he could help her and James have a child. ” Ragnor looked down at the child when it shifted and gave a soft sound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So an old headmaster was helping his student get pregnant, and this made you think this child could be one of our kind? Ragnor I fear you are falling into paranoia.”Magnus said, slipping out a child shifting his weight from one leg to the other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Trust me on what I say Magnus I thought so myself,” with that Ragnor went into explaining how he had found out about James Potter becoming sterile, how James convinced Lily to approach Albus. How Ragnor met her later on, listening to where she heard of him and asking to see if he could recover her memories of ever getting pregnant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To find out who had sired the baby inside Lily’s womb. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I believe Sammael had sired a child that night.” those words caused Magnus to tense with agitation, he gave a frown to the warlock.</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“He’s dead Ragnor, Lilith spoke he had been wounded and died.” Magnus spoke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know there is a chance he could be alive.”The older warlock spat back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ragnor it could have been another demon, even if Sammael survived he wouldn’t have the strength to manifest into the world from the veil for a long time to even arrange anything!” Magnus’s voice rose in volume as he paced around the living room, agitation was itching at his skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whether you deny it or not Magnus his mark is on this child.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ragnor pulled the blanket away to reveal the now awake toddler, his hair was a dark chocolate brown, eyes wide and jade green.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no denying his features, the description that held record from Lilith’s own mouth was fitting with the features on the child’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sharp nose, dark hair and sharp eyebrows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yet there were features that were of his mother’s, her complexion, lips, eye shape and cheekbones even if Magnus never met Lily Evans in person he could see it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If the Clave finds out they would have him killed, his sire is too dangerous to have spawn.”Magnus spoke finally after a long while of silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He is still of our kind and deserves to live.” Ragnor spoke. “Magnus you have to take him, Albus will use him in the war. He has no one else except for mundanes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magnus took a step back his eyes flashing to their cat amber as they darted to glance at the child then back at his friend.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“You can’t be serious Ragnor.”he spoke raising an eyebrow.</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“You are one of the most powerful warlocks of this time, if he is safe with anybody it would be you.”Ragnor spoke standing up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I live night after night attending parties, that’s no life for a child, I’m not ready to take another one.”Magnus said taking a few more steps back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He has no one Magnus, he was placed on the doorstep of his dead mother’s mundane relatives and would have been shaped into nothing but a weapon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>You are his only chance.”Ragnor was nearly shaking at this point, emotions were flying across his eyes. “Please Magnus, I know you have been through dark times this child needs you and I dare to say you need him as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magnus Bane always had a witty comeback to say, something to make even the most intellect scholar’s words seem ridiculous. But yet here he was rotted in place speechless for once, deep in his heart he knew Ragnor was right.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He always helped a downworlder get used to their life, his mentoring of Raphael in 1953 rose in his mind, the lost look the boy had. Even of the little son of Lily Potter didn’t grasp the situation he was in a worse spot than his adopted vampire son.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Raphael still had family, this boy didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ok,” the reply was soft and a bit shaky as he looked into Ragnor’s black eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The High Warlock of London slipped out a breath of relief, moving closer he deposited the boy into Magnus’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“His name is Harry, it would be best to change his last name in case.” Ragnor whispered out as the boy’s jade eyes looked up at Magnus’s cat like ones.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An innocent smile appeared on his lips as little Harry reached up to touch the man’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magnus was tracing the boy’s soft features, only taking note that Ragnor was opening a portal to Magnus’s home in New York.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll make sure he’s safe Ragnor.” was the last words Magnus said to the other as he walked into the portal, Magnus had always kept his word and he wasn’t intending to break it any time soon.</span>
