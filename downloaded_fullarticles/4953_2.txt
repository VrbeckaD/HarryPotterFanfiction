    <p>“Merlin, Ron! You’re on fire tonight.”</p><p>Ron bit his lip in concentration as he lifted himself up and down on Harry’s cock, sending jolts of pleasure through his body as his lover’s rod battered his prostate mercilessly.</p><p>“Missed you, baby,” Ron whispered hoarsely. “Missed your fat cock.”</p><p>“D-don’t stop.”</p><p>“Not my intention,” Ron said, furiously stroking his prick, while bringing Harry closer and closer to orgasm.</p><p>“Fucking hell!” Harry cried out. “Close!”</p><p>“Daddy, what are you doing with Uncle Ron?”</p><p>Harry’s erotic blush on his cheeks rapidly changed into the pristine colour of their sheets. Harry winced a bit as Ron uncoupled himself rather recklessly, while covering their naked bodies with a blanket.</p><p>“Sweetheart,” Harry said with an unnatural high-pitched voice as his daughter walked shyly into their bedroom, holding Mr Stardust, her teddy bear, close to her. “Why aren’t you in your bed?”</p><p>“I couldn’t sleep,” Lily pouted. “There was so much noise.”</p><p>Harry and Ron looked at each other and blushed. They had forgotten to use a Silencing Charm.</p><p>“We have to cut down the drinking,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, smiling forcibly to his niece/stepdaughter.</p><p>“What were you doing?”</p><p>“Daddy had a sore back, dear,” Harry said.“From Auror training.”</p><p>“And I tried to loosen up the tight muscles,” Ron added.</p><p>“Is Al following Auror training, too?”</p><p>“Al?” Harry said, frowning.</p><p>“I think he has back problems, too. He was in pain yesterday.”</p><p>“Did Albus tell you that?” Ron said worriedly.</p><p>“No, I heard him screaming,” Lily said softly.“When that boy was here.”</p><p>“What boy?” Harry said sharply.</p><p>“That blond boy who is with him when you two are working,” Lily said. “Al was in so much pain that that other boy wanted to shoot his load. Do you think he wanted to kill Al?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, sweetie,” Harry said. “Al is fine. Go back to bed. I’ll talk to your brother in the morning.”</p><p>“Good night, Daddy and Uncle Ron.”</p><p>“We have to teach the boy to use a Silencing Charm,” Harry said, when Lily was out of earshot.</p><p>“And we have to put away the bezoars, because I have a Malfoy to kill,” Ron hissed, clenching his fists.</p>
