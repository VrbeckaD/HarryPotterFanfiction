    <p>Credence had never planned to join a yoga class. He didn’t even have any interest in yoga to begin with, much less being trapped in a tight space with thirty other people. <em>Strangers</em>. Not his favorite thing. But somehow, it happened anyway, with a sense of sweet inevitability.</p><p>It all started because he was bored, and poking around where he shouldn’t. He was at the gym, lurking in the upstairs hallway near the supply closet as he cooled down from his run, avoiding any more small talk with the two chatty women who had been next to him on the treadmills and waiting for Tina and Queenie to finish with kickboxing, when he idly drifted past the foggy glass wall separating the yoga studio from the rest of the floor and caught sight of the class in session. Well, more accurately, caught sight of the instructor. The man was wearing soft-looking peacock blue yoga pants that were currently molding themselves indecently to the muscular curve of his ass as he bent himself into a perfect forward fold. He was very flexible, and there were freckles in the small of his back where his shirt was falling up.</p><p>Credence nearly dropped his towel.</p><p>He was grateful that nobody on the upstairs exercise machines appeared to be looking in his direction as he drifted automatically closer, fascinated. It looked like most of the class was doing fairly well at mimicking the teacher’s pose, but nobody was as graceful as the man himself. His arms were lean and strong, and his form didn’t shake at all as he planted his palms on the mat and moved his feet back to hover smoothly in one long, flat plank, his biceps bunching and the smooth pale skin of his throat just barely gleaming with sweat. And then he dipped his body down further, still holding himself up with his arms (there were freckles, Credence noticed, all over those long arms, especially his shoulders) and then his head was rising again, his spine arched backward in an elegant curve as his arms stretched out and his neck grew long, his eyes looking up toward ceiling. The man had a soft smile on his face, a genuine expression of pure delight that made Credence feel something fluttery and delicate in his stomach. He was young, probably just a few years older than Credence, with laugh lines just beginning to etch themselves around his mouth, and his hair was a tousled mop of reddish curls.</p><p>He was possibly the most beautiful thing Credence had ever seen. </p><p>Credence’s spellbound eyes slowly took in the delicate dip between his collar bones, the tight planes of his chest under the gaping collar of his loose tank top, the curve of his jaw, the gentle stretch of his smiling lips, the… Oh, no. The man had turned his head minutely, waiting for the rest of the class to copy his movement, and now he appeared to have noticed Credence. His eyelashes were very long, and his cheeks were slightly flushed from being upside down, and Credence abruptly realized he was just standing there staring, one hand leaving a sweaty palm-print on the glass, his mouth hanging slightly open. </p><p>His heart jolted as if he had been stung by something sharp, and he scurried immediately out of the hallway and down the stairs, his pulse pounding, trying to convince himself the man hadn’t actually seen him gaping like an idiot. The main floor of the gym was cooler and less stuffy than upstairs, and Credence sucked in deep breaths of air as he passed between the rows of equipment. It was coincidence; the man had glanced over, but he was probably looking at something else. Credence shook his head slightly, the lingering image skittering helplessly through his mind of the man’s elegant long-fingered hands pressed against the mat and the lean muscles bunching in his arms, the beautiful open joy on his face. The memory filled him with a vague sort of hunger, along with a sharp feeling of panic.</p><p>Come on, Credence. No reason to be so jumpy. Not anymore. You didn’t do anything wrong.</p><p>Then Tina was calling his name from over by the changing rooms, and it was time to go home.</p><p>Credence could feel himself acting distant during the car ride back the apartment, his mind off swirling through indistinct thoughts of freckles and happiness and forbidden things and long, bendy legs while he half-listened to Queenie tease Tina about some woman in their kickboxing class. By the time she was laying dessert on the table, his cousin seemed to have noticed something was off. </p><p>“Credence, honey, you’ve been quiet all through dinner. Is everything okay?”</p><p>To his horror, he found himself blushing heatedly, which unfortunately gained him Queenie’s immediate full attention.</p><p>“Oh my! Credence, what have you been thinking about?” She asked delightedly. “Is it a good thing? Can you tell us that much?”</p><p>Tina was watching him carefully from across the table, curiosity and hope rising in her dark eyes. He knew how acutely they both worried about him, and how much they wanted him to be happy living here.</p><p>“Yes,” he said quietly, still slightly mortified, pinned by their expectant stares. “It is a good thing.” They both beamed at him, and Credence was filled with an unfamiliar floaty tingling, half pleasant and half disorienting. </p><p>To be honest, he wasn’t sure if it was good or bad. If the yoga instructor had seen him staring, that was a bit embarrassing. But, he reminded himself determinedly, he hadn’t done anything wrong either. So what if he had been caught looking? For all anyone knew, he had just been thinking about trying the class. And even if his interest wasn’t strictly… professional, there was there was no sin in looking at that man, no sin in wanting him.</p><p>No sin at all. He had freed himself of that rhetoric when he’d stopped living under Ma’s roof. There was nothing wrong with being attracted to men, or with looking out for his own happiness. Tina had certainly told him that enough times that it ought to have sunk in by now. </p><p>“More strudel, honey?” Queenie beamed as Credence blinked up at her, the soft approval in her eyes making it seem almost as if she had heard his internal pep talk. </p><p>He found himself opening his mouth. But instead of responding to her question, an entirely different sentence somehow tumbled half-involuntarily off the tip of his tongue and landed in the quiet of the dining room.</p><p>“I’m thinking of trying the yoga class.”</p><p>Tina looked up in surprise. “Really? The evening one? That could work, I think it ends around the same time as kickboxing.” She was chewing slowly, brow slightly furrowed in thought. “Maybe you can mix it up with your runs. It could be um… what do you call it?”</p><p>“Cross-training,” put in Queenie. “I think it’s a great idea.” She nodded at Credence. “My friend Tori swears by yoga, and she’s a runner like you. She’s in that class, and she says the instructor really knows his stuff. Gave her some specific stretches to help loosen her leg muscles and prevent injuries, or something. He studied massage and physical therapy for a while, so he really knows his anatomy.” Credence could never really tell with Queenie, but that might have been a hint of well-hidden innuendo. He tried not to blush at the sudden mental picture of the gorgeous yoga teacher calmly helping him stretch after a run, his elegant hands wrapped around Credence’s legs as he pressed him down onto the mat.</p><p>Tina made a noise of comprehension. “Oh, is that the guy she was going on about a few weeks ago at your birthday thing? The one who helped her with her tight hamstrings? She kept gushing about his tattoo and his freckles, and I lost track of where she was going with her story,” Tina said dryly.</p><p>“Yeah,” Queenie said carefully, “apparently she thought he was a real picture.” Credence studiously did not meet her eyes, focusing on finishing his strudel, blocking out the part of him that was internally screaming. He had a <em>tattoo</em>. Ma would have hated him. The thought made him impossibly more attractive.</p><p>Oblivious, Tina went on. “Well, Tori’s crush aside, they wouldn’t have him teaching at the gym if he weren’t an expert. I suppose you will be in good hands, sweetie.” Credence swallowed. He would very much like to be in those hands, actually, even though the thought of it simultaneously thrilled and terrified him. “Why don’t you try the class out for a week and see what you think? And then whatever you decide after that will be fine.” There was a slight crease of concern in Tina’s brow, her eyes intent on his face. “I think it is wonderful that you want to learn something new,” she added quietly, “but if you don’t end up feeling comfortable in there, you can always leave. It’s… it’s going to be full of people, and the air can get awfully stuffy upstairs.”</p><p>Credence could hear what she was really saying. Remember. You’re free now; you don’t have to be trapped anywhere you don’t want to be. If you feel like you are being crushed in on all sides again, you find a way out, just like we practiced.</p><p>She briefly nudged his arm with the side of her hand. “I’m proud that you are branching out.” A grin was twitching in the corner of her mouth, which Credence shyly returned.</p><p>“I agree!” chirped Queenie. “Creedy’s gonna be as bendy as a straw soon! Our own little yogi! Ooh, and we gotta get you some of those fancy yoga pants that all the soccer moms wear to the café to get their coffee. I guess they’re so comfortable that they don’t wanna take ‘em off after they leave the gym.” </p><p>Tina huffed. “I think it has more to do with showing off their legs, Queenie. And other things. Have you not noticed how tight those pants are?”</p><p>Queenie waved her hand. “Well, sure, but they’ve also gotta be pretty comfy. And Creedy isn’t gonna be wearing them around town, just in the yoga studio where everybody else is wearing them too.” She turned to him eagerly. “It’s up to you, of course, honey, but I’d be happy to take you shopping after work tomorrow if you don’t mind skipping your run. My treat. It can be an early birthday present.”</p><p>Credence was helplessly reminded of the yoga instructor’s long muscular legs encased in soft blue fabric, the material pulled taut over the firm curve of his ass. Somewhat awkwardly, he nodded. He didn’t think he would look half as good in them as the teacher had, but it would be nice to have something to wear other than the loose shorts he wore to run in, which would probably slide embarrassingly up his thighs during some of the poses. “Thank you, Queenie. I’d appreciate it.”</p><p>“No problem, sweetie.” She kissed him on the cheek as she rose to collect their dishes from the table, and Credence suppressed the automatic urge to take over the task for her and go wash them. It had taken many iterations of ‘we all take turns with the chores, Credence, you don’t have to do housework every night’ to ease the instinctive panic he felt any time he let someone else work while he relaxed. But Ma was no longer here to punish him for being lazy.</p><p>“What’s Jacob been baking this week?” asked Tina as the soft rushing noise of water filling the sink issued out of the kitchen, followed by quiet clinking. “Another crazy new pastry in the shape of a… I don’t know… a flying horse?”</p><p>Credence grinned. “No flying horses yet. But I’ll tell him your suggestion and he might make them next.”</p><p>His boss had a tendency to design his baked creations in the shape of animals, and lately fantastical creatures, which was part of what made working for him so enjoyable. He had even started including Credence in the brainstorming process, always interested to know his take on a new idea. In fact, Jacob had been one of the first people who really seemed to put stock in Credence’s opinion, and consequently was one of the only strangers in his whole life who had crossed the difficult and elusive boundary into being his friend. </p><p>Queenie and Tina didn’t really count, since they were family, even though his Ma had tried her best to make sure they saw as little of each other as possible after her big fall-out with Aunt Beth. They’d been mostly estranged for over a decade, living on opposite sides of Washington State, and yet his cousins had still opened their home to him when he had nowhere else to go, in the disorienting fog following Ma’s arrest. </p><p>He knew deep down they would’ve offered him their help even if he weren’t adoptive flesh and blood, even if he was just a lost outsider. It was just who Tina and Queenie were. He’d been a broken soul with nowhere to go and no high school diploma, despite the fact he was old enough to be out of college. No prospects for work, no job experience outside of helping Ma with her sermons and handing out her pamphlets on the street, no savings of his own, and far too old to go into foster care with Chastity and Modesty. If his cousins hadn’t taken him in, Credence didn’t know what would’ve become of him. At that point he’d been far too angry and afraid to build enough momentum to find a job or follow the social worker’s emphatic advice that he enroll in a GED program. He’d been locked up inside himself.</p><p>But Tina and Queenie had taken a moody, erratic young man into their home and shown him all the familial affection he’d been lacking until that point. And somehow, the burdens of the past had eventually gotten lighter and he had approached something that looked quite a bit like happiness. He had his GED now, his job at the bakery, regular visits with his little sisters over in Bellevue, and his online classes through the community college to get him started toward a degree. Not that he had any idea yet what he wanted to study. Ma would have said the only education he needed was in the bible.</p><p>Tina squeezed his shoulder as she got up from the table, heading in the direction of her tiny office, which she slept in at night. “Alright, you keep me posted on those flying horse pastries. It’s good Queenie convinced me to do this kickboxing class, otherwise all of those chili chocolate dragons I’ve been eating would mean buying pants a size up. Those things are ridiculously good.”</p><p>Credence grinned. It had been his idea to spice up the chocolate pastries with cayenne pepper to fit the theme of fire. The effect was quite nice - spicy and rich and sweet all at once. Jacob had clapped him on the shoulder after the first bite and said, ‘You’re a genius, kid! Got the instinct. That’s a real talent right there.’ The next day the pastries had become a bestseller and Jacob had given him a raise.</p><p>Credence could at least be proud of that. The pastries brought people happiness, and his paycheck meant that he was contributing to the household, making the strain of fitting him into Tina and Queenie’s postage-stamp-sized Seattle apartment less stark. He could cover the cost of his own clothes, which he mostly got at the thrift store, and chip in for the groceries and the rent, although he strongly suspected that his cousins were charging him far less than a third of the total. And his online classes were mostly covered by a need-based financial aid scholarship, which he had qualified for by virtue of having nearly nothing to his name at the time he applied.</p><p>Stretching slowly, Credence got up from the dining room table and headed to the couch, which folded out each night to become his bed. He booted up his laptop and dutifully got started on a paper for his English class, in which he was comparing different literary examples of magical worlds and the social issues the authors may have been commenting on metaphorically through the role and operation of magic in their work. It was actually quite fascinating, and Credence quickly fell deep into his essay, losing himself happily in the politics of Oz and the biblical overtones of Narnia.</p><p>When he next looked up from his computer, Tina’s office was dark and the kitchen was quiet and he realized he needed to get to bed so that he wouldn’t be dragging at the bakery tomorrow. His eyes felt slightly gritty from staring at his computer but his essay was mostly complete.</p><p>Feeling satisfied, he quickly did his nighttime routine, brushing his teeth, rubbing lotion on his face and throwing on some soft sweatpants to sleep in, and then folding out the couch bed. As he curled up under the blankets, the panic he had felt earlier had dulled and in its place was only excitement. He would try yoga, and get to stare at that beautiful man for an hour three times a week. And maybe something about being near him would bring Credence the same joy that the man seemed to have found, maybe after a few weeks Credence would be the one smiling so peacefully, doing the poses with grace and strength. And maybe the man would notice.</p><p>Credence buried his face in his pillow, embarrassed at his fantasy but pleased all the same. He knew none of this was likely. He probably would look like a wobbly mess in the class, nothing like the elegant perfection of the teacher. </p><p>But he could hide in the back where nobody else would be watching him. It would be fine.</p><p>His fantasy returned, and Credence allowed himself to imagine what might happen if he already was an expert at yoga, catching the eye of the teacher with his confident skill. And then maybe the teacher would come around and correct everyone’s form, and he would slide his hands up Credence’s hips and help him press further into downward dog, bending over his back to murmur, ‘great job, you are doing so well.’ And maybe after class he would offer to massage Credence’s legs, and stretch his tight hamstrings, his lean arms flexing intimately while their bodies pressed close together, and Credence might get to see what color his eyes were underneath those long lashes.</p><p>Surreptitiously, one hand snuck out from under the blankets to grab a tissue from the box on the table next to the couch, before the fantasy continued. The man might have Credence lay flat on his back while he loomed overhead, pressing his legs into a stretch, one of Credence’s ankles over his freckled, strong shoulder as he bent forward and effortlessly folded Credence in half like a taco. And then, with their bodies so close, what if Credence reached out and touched his chest, felt his heart beating through his thin tank top, ran his fingers over hot skin and firm muscle, up to the delicate dip between his collar bones and along his pale throat to his beautiful face, cheeks slightly pink and his soft lips in a genuine smile. He imagined the man looking down at him, smiling, the full force of his joy centered only on Credence, his lovely eyes focused on his face.</p><p>Credence was touching himself furtively under the blankets, his soft gasps stifled into the pillow. The man might kiss him then, tenderly, while letting Credence’s leg slip off his shoulder to wrap around his hips instead. And he would whisper sweet things, murmuring how he found Credence beautiful and how much he had wanted to touch him ever since he saw him in class, while his long-fingered hands ran through Credence’s hair, caressing his face. And their bodies would be pressed together so intimately and their chests so close that Credence would feel the man’s heartbeat, could feel the expansion of his lungs, the vibration of his voice. And then Credence would gasp as the man began to rock his hips, rubbing them together through the material of their pants where he was so sensitive and aching, the man bending to kiss him again, to whisper right up against his lips, ‘That’s it, baby. You feel so good.’ And Credence would arch into him luxuriously, sliding both hands down his slender back to squeeze that spectacular ass while the man’s wet mouth sucked at his neck, their hips smoothly thrusting together and Credence letting out increasingly desperate moans, held safe and secure in the man’s strong arms.</p><p>The real Credence was silent as he came, mouth open in a soundless moan, catching his mess in the crumpled tissue while he slowly jacked himself through the aftershocks, his heart thundering in his chest and his breath coming in quiet pants. As his heart rate slowed back to normal, Credence blinked in shock at his own daring. He had been so caught up in his fantasy! But his cousins were right down the hall, and what if they heard–</p><p>But, no, he knew he had been quiet. And the heavy, wrung-out euphoria after orgasm was making it hard for him to regret it as he crept to the bathroom and carefully wrapped the soiled tissue in another fresh one and tucked it far down into the trash can, easing the water on silently so that he could wash his hands. He padded back to the bed and slid under the covers, his body feeling pleasantly loose. </p><p>He had never dared touch himself under his Ma’s roof, and his sexual experiences for a long time had been pitifully limited to desperate fumbles alone in the bathroom at the community center, when his hormones were driving him crazy and Ma was out there giving another sermon to the uninterested crowd on the many sins of today’s society. His climax had always felt like something terrible back then, an act of betrayal, the ultimate treason of the flesh, even months after he was out from under Ma’s thumb and freed from listening to her voice condemning the sins of lust every morning at breakfast. It was only after Tina had started taking him to see a therapist and his eyes had been opened to several different ways of thinking that he had dared to try it again. Maybe it wasn’t a sin after all. And, good lord, had that been a memorable experience. Without the self-hatred and fear in the way, his orgasm had thundered through him like a freight train and left him trembling for what felt like hours on the floor of the Goldsteins’ tiny bathroom, until he had finally heard the sound of the elevator door signal their return from the store and had rushed to compose himself.</p><p>His body sank a little deeper into the couch mattress in warm embarrassed pleasure as he remembered the flurry of self-exploration that had followed that discovery, and the absolute paradigm shift that had come with the gift of his very own laptop and access to the vast mire of the internet. There had been so much coarseness and mortifyingly delicious obscenity, and he had devoured it with wide, shocked eyes and a heart that felt as if it would beat right out of his chest. He hadn’t had the courage to tell Juliet, his therapist, about anything specific, but she seemed to glean the meaning of his awkward, fumblingly vague questions. No, it wasn’t wrong to be interested in sex. It was healthy to be curious, and good to discover what he liked, to think about what he would want when the time came and he found someone he felt safe trying it with. And no, it wasn’t a sin if that person was a man. His salvation felt like it was handed to him right there in Juliet Kowalski’s kind brown eyes as she calmly told him that there was nothing wrong with men like him, who wanted other men. Nothing wrong at all.</p><p>When she had helped him come out to Tina and Queenie, they had been so supportive it almost hurt. There had been a painful pinch of regret boiling in his chest, a wish that he’d been living with them all along, that he’d never had to listen to Ma spew hate speech about homosexuals over the dinner table and shout bible quotes at men holding hands on the street. </p><p>But he couldn’t change the past. He could only move forward with the future and cut the ghost of Ma’s prejudice loose from his soul.</p><p>He was drifting off to sleep now, warm and safe. He was going to buy those yoga pants tomorrow, maybe in some bright color that Ma would hate. And he would wear his hair long, no matter that she’d call it too effeminate, and he would bake delicious pastries that brought people happiness, no matter that she condemned gluttony, and he would study whatever he wanted in college and join the yoga class and have as many sinful thoughts about the teacher as he liked. And there was nothing she could do to stop him. He smiled softly, and then he was well and truly asleep.</p>
