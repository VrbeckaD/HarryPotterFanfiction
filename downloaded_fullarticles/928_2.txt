    <p>“What’s going on with you?”</p><p>It was only after a moment of silence followed the question that Oliver realized he was being spoken to. Turning his head from where he’d been staring at his bed hangings, he found Percy standing at the edge of his own bed, watching him.</p><p>“What?” Oliver asked, feeling stupid for having missed the question.</p><p>Percy’s mouth twitched upward before he returned to his usual straight-faced expression.</p><p>“I asked what’s going on,” he said in his prefect voice that Oliver had grown to despise.</p><p>He placed his school bag carefully on his bed and pulled his books out one-by-one into a neat stack beside it.</p><p>“Why would anything be going on?”</p><p>Percy paused in his unpacking to give Oliver a pointed look.</p><p>“You only sulk like that after you lose a game, and there was no game today.”</p><p>Oliver watch him for a few moments.</p><p>“I’m surprised you knew that.”</p><p>The words had been genuine, but fire sparked in Percy’s eyes.</p><p>“It’s hard to miss a Quidditch match at Hogwarts,” he said.</p><p>Oliver supposed that was true, but he didn’t say anything until Percy had finished with his bag, slung it over it’s hook, and moved his books to the foot of his bed to make room for himself.</p><p>“I focus too much on Quidditch.”</p><p>Percy’s posture was stiff as he focused his attention on Oliver.</p><p>“Okay?” he said slowly. “Why’s that bothering you?”</p><p>“I realized I’ve never kissed anyone.”</p><p>Percy squirmed, his cheeks turning a light pink.</p><p>“You only realized that now?” he asked. “Out of the blue?”</p><p>“Well, no. Or yes, I guess I did. At least, today was the first time I really thought about it.”</p><p>Percy nodded, though his brow was wrinkled in confusion. He didn’t say anything else as he grabbed the top book off his stack and began paging through it.</p><p>“What about you?” Oliver asked, raising one eyebrow when Percy cringed at the question. “Have you kissed anyone?”</p><p>Percy looked up from his book with narrowed eyes.</p><p>“You know I had a girlfriend all of last year, right?”</p><p>Oliver’s lack of a response was the only answer Percy needed. He snorted, closing his book with a snap.</p><p>“Maybe you’re right. You do spend too much time on Quidditch.” </p><p>Oliver wanted to retort that maybe he just didn’t care about Percy enough to know about his love life, but that felt too mean. Besides, he only felt offended because he agreed. As much as he didn’t want to admit it, he watched Percy too often to not have noticed a girlfriend.</p><p>When he didn’t answer, Percy shook his head.</p><p>“If it’s bothering you, you shouldn't have any trouble finding someone to kiss. Just ask someone.”</p><p>“Like who?” Oliver asked with a furrowed brow.</p><p>His ego wasn’t large enough to believe there were people waiting around to kiss him, but when Percy averted his eyes to his comforter, cheeks bright red, Oliver realized why Percy was confident in his prospects.</p><p>“Percy,” he said slowly, regret already poking at his thoughts, “do you think I'm attractive?”</p><p>Percy spluttered, flipping the pages of the book in his hands frantically. </p><p>“Anyone would. I have eyes. It’s not a big deal.”</p><p>Oliver grinned as his stomach fluttered.</p><p>“Percy, would you be my first kiss?”</p><p>Percy stiffened. His eyes found Oliver again, glaring.</p><p>“That’s not how it's meant to work,” he said.</p><p>“Sorry,” Oliver said despite not actually feeling sorry. “I figured if you thought I’m attractive, and I think you’re attractive, why not ask?”</p><p>“You think I’m attractive?”</p><p>Oliver let his eyes rove over Percy’s form with more freedom than he’d ever allowed himself before.</p><p>“Yes,” he stated simply.</p><p>He saw the shaky breath Percy took from across the room and smirked.</p><p>“Is that a yes?”</p><p>Percy gave a short nod, and Oliver jumped out of bed, earning a strangled laugh from Percy as he got up to meet him in the middle of the room.</p><p>When their lips touched, Oliver felt butterflies, but it wasn’t as earth shattering as a kiss in his dreams would have been.</p><p>“How long did it take you to get good at this?” he asked.</p><p>Percy grinned.</p><p>“I don’t remember, but you’ll figure it out.”</p><p>Oliver didn’t waste any time pulling him back in.</p>
