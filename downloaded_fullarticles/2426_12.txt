    <p>“Uncle Lucius,” I ask as my uncle, Draco and I walk down Diagon Alley,” Can we go to Flourish and Blotts?”</p><p>”We need to get your school books anyway, so I guess we can,” Uncle Lucius replies, heading towards Flourish and Blotts.</p><p>I smile at Draco as he shakes his head with a grin. I walk through the front door of Flourish and Blotts, rushing up the stairs to go find a new book. I hear Draco following after me, laughing softly.</p><p>”Geez, Briar. You’re excited,” Draco says, grinning at me.</p><p>”If it’s a chance to get a new book,” I laugh, scanning the shelves, “I’ll always be excited. I love books, you know that Draco.”</p><p>”That’s a horrid reasoning,” Draco mummers.</p><p>I spin around, smacking his arm,”You’re mean.”</p><p>”Never said I was nice,” He grins, rubbing his arm.</p><p>”No you didn’t, doesn’t mean that you can’t be,” I growl.</p><p> </p>
