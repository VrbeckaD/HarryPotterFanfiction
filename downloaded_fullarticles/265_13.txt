          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Is that my shirt?” Harry asked, looking Draco up and down appreciatively as he came out of the bedroom.</p>
<p>“So, what if it is?” He smirked, waltzing into the kitchen wearing Harry’s favourite Holyhead Harpies shirt, leaning against the counter while Harry brewed their tea. He had let his hair grow out since their days at Hogwarts, and it hung loosely around his shoulders, surprisingly untangled for someone who had just rolled out of bed.</p>
<p>“It’s comfy isn’t it,” Harry said, as he spooned the tea bags out of their cups.</p>
<p>“Very, I might have to keep it for myself.”</p>
<p>Harry glowered playfully, “you’re lucky you’re cute.”</p>
<p>“Very lucky,” Draco simpered, moving around to press kisses down Harry’s shoulders. Draco’s hair soft and tickling against his bare back.</p>
<p>“Do you take sugar and milk?” Harry asked, trying to ignore the rush of feeling running down his abdomen. He liked his own tea strong, with just a touch of milk, never sugar. </p>
<p>“I like sweet things,” Draco smiled against Harry’s skin, wrapping his arms around Harry to dole out his own amount of sugar, stirring it gracefully.</p>
<p>“I like sweet things, too,” Harry said, turning around playfully to press a kiss to Draco’s lips. He buried his face into Draco’s shoulder, enjoying the mixture of his and Draco’s scents combined. He could get used to this—waking up to Draco and his sassy remarks, making tea for them every morning, figuring out what Draco liked. It wasn’t Draco that was lucky, he thought, but himself. </p></div>
