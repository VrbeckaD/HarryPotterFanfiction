    <p>Frankly when he thought that this year would be any different, he should have known that it would be anything but. It was the enigmatic disarray of the Order that should have tipped him off at the end of the summer. The lack of letters and the lack of communication besides the Dursley's was disturbing.</p><p>And there was nothing he could do but just to sit and wait for them to respond, to even give a damn. He was there and they knew it, but for reasons he didn’t know, his two best friends in the world cut him off and he was alone once again.</p><p>But that wasn’t anything knew unfortunately, he was used to talking to himself and responding, it became a game to him to figure out what other people would say to him, practiced and executed right in his too small bedroom. It was angering that his conversations would lead to places he didn’t want to travel. His loss of contact has made anything he imagined too dark for him to either ignore or accept as some type of truth.</p><p>Why would his friends leave him here when they know. From his difficulty eating each new year at school, to his quaking scars. Honestly, it was like Hermione forgot everything that the muggle world taught her and everything that Ron’s father discovered in his long ministry years. He was in pain in his too small leftover bedroom and everything he thought of didn’t leave his mind settled, but made everything the worse for the wear.</p><p>The wear that cannot seem to leave him or his thoughts, nor the tingling scar every so often. As not all his scars are simply physical, his godfather, the one thing that has ever given him his solace at life. The one comfort and the single most traumatizing tragedy in his brand new 16 years, even considering what else had happened at Hogwarts. His mind for once was in a state where he could not dissolve the problem with a conversation, a walk, or a letter to a friend.</p><p>He was here at a place that put bars on his window, he was being fed by people who slung a belt like it was the new sunscreen in the rising temperature. His trembling frame shook going back to this place every year, but this year took the cake. He was alone grieving the only family he ever knew, even for such a short time, it was some of the most powerful moments in his life, the memories that would fuel his Patronus, but no longer. They would only get him in trouble for crying, and as Ron has said multiple times every year he woke up in the infirmary, crying is for girls. So he held it, to feel the emasculation that he felt was the only thing left, strength that has lead him here and through many battles.</p><p>Those battles are also the reason he is here, fighting for Dumbledore got him here and his godfather dead. All he has left now is Moony, but he was sure he knew where he was now, behind the tall frame of Grimmauld Place, the house that housed his would be godfather and gave him his own terrible memories that let him be enveloped by the Potter’s embrace.</p><p>He was at a loss at what to do now that, while calm, everything was not right. It was a sight to see his best mate following the rules for once, not even surprised by Hermione, even after years of rules breaking for the betterment of something that started long ago.</p><p>The war was still fresh, now even after a year of Voldemort being resurrected, he felt that it was his job to keep the mantle up in a way. But he shook his head at the naivety. It was not his war. It took too many people, and what was he good for other than cannon fodder at this point. He has nothing to go on with after the war is to be ended. All he has been doing is fighting, all he has been doing is breaking with no one there to put him back together when he came ‘home’.</p><p>‘Home is where the heart is”, they say, but he hasn’t the faintest to where his is now, he can’t talk himself out of this one now that it is there in the forefront of him mind, body, and soul.</p><p>The hemorrhaging is becoming palpable though, at this rate, putting himself back together won’t be possible anymore. The mirror that he looked upon so long ago is becoming once again a dream, but instead the final one.</p><p>He doesn't want it to be so. What is he to do but become a lamb to the slaughter. He chuckled morbidly at the imagery he produced, thinking back to his third year to where most of his agonizing love came from. The Hippogriff  and that adventure. His godfather is everywhere a this point, as he hadn’t had much of a life before Hogwarts.</p><p>Why can’t the world leave him be, hiding had always done him well before he met his friends and the occasional outing to the school’s dungeons. Being a ghost was his forte, and it was a skill he wasn’t ready to let go of for his own purposes and the Quidditch he loved so much.</p><p>Crawling further into himself on his bed, he sighed. The small blanket didn’t do much when the summer heat left the air, now that he was accustomed to the heat, it was a freezing hell that no one was the wiser of. Shivering every so often, his thoughts kept trying to many other directions but most lean to the fact that he was alone and along for someone else's ride.</p><p>He was here to be a weapon and that was the only real purpose he had left at the moment, softly stroking his fare skin on his hand, he knew that the calluses were there through hard work, and hard work alone brought food to his belly and was the reason that he still breathes. He stopped for a moment. If work kept me alive, how much more do I need to put into to be free.</p><p>Freedom as a silly thought though, watching Snape was proof enough. He himself has two masters as Harry does. One to Dumbledore and the other to something darker, in Harry’s case, it was himself.</p><p>The longer he was left alone he knew that his mind was wearing down and stray thoughts of dangerous things kept filtering through. Was this how Bellatrix thinks, or even Padfoot. They were both in such a dark place for such a long time., the thoughts they had must have been deadly.</p><p>Turning on his side to hold in some warmth, he thought of escape, but took the notion out of his head. The only way he was getting out of here with his wand down stairs was to do a bout of ‘accidental’ magic, and he really didn’t need another Dobby situation to ruin everything all over again. Worse than it ever had been, the Ministry would jump at the chance to break his wand, the tournament really didn’t show them his good side.</p><p>And another road he can’t let himself fall down. His mind refused to wirl down this path and he was thankful. The memories were too harsh to even think about. Here the Order was letting him to suffer too.</p><p>All around suffering, it was torture to be left alone with these specific thoughts, a murderous intent was spewing and he couldn’t think to laugh at the irony of SPEW. What his friends were, was ridiculous in every sense of the Bogart term.</p><p>Rolling to the other side to stop the aching from his ribs, his scratched his head. A shower would be nice, or a piss bath. Eventually one will come. Not the good one he would wager.</p><p>Simple niceties didn’t come easier to the Saviour Of The Wizarding World though. He had to wait two months then waste some on recuperation to not stunt the heath he was slowing gaining back. He also knew that every member of the Order Of The Phoenix knew about every detail of his life too. It was to the point that the sides of this war were blurring and the impossibility of both was making him angrier at each moment. They were still using Sirius’ house too, ransacking his memory with their dreadful colours and useless objects that he had to step back for a second. They were desecrating that last tangible thing he had left of Sirius.</p><p>The hot rage he felt made the lack of layers seem like the summer heat once again. He stood up and paced the room with little progress as to stop whatever might be happening. It was not as if to disturb them in the sense that he would kick them out, but who was he kidding, it was exactly what he wanted. He wanted back his father in everything but blood. And that old decrepit house was the way to do it.</p><p>He felt the smooth skin of his hand and then felt the ridges that marred the other. He won’t ever tell lies again, but only to himself. He was only able to survive by telling lies. They were another moment in time the let him know that he just might be making the right decision. The assurance that he usually got from his friends was left vacant in the air, but he could imagine what they would think and that was quite frankly enough on multiple accounts. Enough was enough and the magic that thrummed under his veins was all the assurance that he would ever need for this moment. He needed to stop lying to himself and his magic of what he might really be.</p><p>He connected the dots, the misuse of magic here at the Dursley’s was an excuse. The misuse of magic on his aunt was also an excuse.</p><p>Might as well give them another, eh?</p><p>His hand rose from his place in his room and wished a Bombarda on top of a Silencio. With all his might, with all his dreams and hopes of an actual future, one happy with a family, his magic for once obeyed him and his whims.</p><p>The blow back was awing, considering he didn’t use a wand and had never used wandless magic before in his life. Lowering his right hand, he peered at it. The hand that was unmarred was the reason he had hope for a family, the smooth dainty skin held a name that has been there longer than he could remember. The name gave him hope beyond hope that he could now have a life past Sirius, and he was determined. After hiding this hand so long behind sleeves and gloves, he was ready to approach the person who he knew had his own in the same spot.</p><p>No matter the past or the possible future, he would find his soulmate. Hope was there that his soulmate might help him piece himself back together too.</p><p>But in the meantime, he picked himself some trousers and a shirt with a jumper that might help him outside. Still hyper aware of the blown open door, and the silence that surrounded everything that could have touched or have been felt by it.</p><p>He slid out of his demolished door frame, and started to step quickly down the steps to the landing. Arriving to the cupboard, he stopped then started again after throwing his hand back into his hair quick enough to not stop his task. Unlocking the dead bolt with a silent Alohomora, praising his new found talent, he packed up everything and prayed that Hedwig was still alright spending more time with the Weasley’s. He told her to wait for a response and not to leave till then. It's been just over a week since.</p><p>Casting a prayer to her, he grabbed everything he needed and headed out the front door, knowing that the only way he would return would to be in a urn that the Dursley’s would send their thanks with a mix of shite and a dead animal that Petunia found in her prized garden. Simple enough though, he would do just the same to be fair.</p><p>He walked to the same stop he was at the first time he met his Godfather, and the first time he took the Knight bus. Hailing it is simple, anyone is allowed to do it, age or not. The stranded part really helps in the description of the service, and the beds too.</p><p>Flipping his hood up and telling Stan his destination in a lowered voice, he sat down until he would arrive at Diagon Alley. He needed to find a room in the Leaky Cauldron, and take out some galleons at Gringotts to make his stay last longer than one night from the cash he had on hand. He made the forethought as to have it in the immediate things he needed each year. Transportation and a place to stay was imbued into his soul. A floor has become something he doesn’t want to experience any longer when Vernon gets angry, or his friends think it was time for practical joke and hunt around the castle.</p><p>The rise on the bus was especially shaky that night, it seemed that Erney was having more than a sandwich up front, and while yes he did trust, it was only to a mute point. Harry was counting down the seconds and hoping his stop would be next, and not more old ladies who thought that it was a good idea this time of night to go galavanting through the inner alleys of London.</p><p>It was exhausting to be worrying about so many things at once, but there wasn’t much to help it. He ended up stoking his hand, a habit he recently picked up when the name became more than a possibility, but a future. A future that he was now very willing to start on and just change things to finally go his way.</p><p>Above all, the number one rule in this bus was once you know you face plant, you can never not do it again. So here he was after another jarring impact, not unlike the one two years ago. He picked himself up and looked to the conductor Stan.</p><p>“ Here’s your stop, mind ye head”</p><p>Harry passed over the sickles and knuts, and clambered down off the bus after the wretched breath of the man passed all over his face. It was enough to make him gag, almost too hard to work through. Straightening his shoulders and his hood, he head to the entrance of the Cauldron and headed for Tom the barkeep.</p><p>“Mind if I get a room for the night, maybe more?”, After twirling out of the way of some of the more, famished patrons.</p><p>“Sure thing young man, but mind the neighbours, most came back from the Weird Sisters concert. They are a tad, excitable at the moment.” Resigned Tom, he wasn’t even phased from the hooded Harry and the low call of his voice, Tom at this point must have been used to it. Harry took it as a win in his books, no matter how small. He couldn’t risk people knowing who he was and the possibility of waking up with the Prophet in his bed.</p><p>That was a bedbug no one in their right mind would want biting at their neck for the next juicy story to dissolve and prepare for fanatics.</p><p>What he wanted right not though, was a bed and some dreamless sleep potion, but at the moment only one of those are not tightly regulated, so asking Tom for a charm, he followed his only belongings in the whole world to his room. Stepping inside we was able to see even now how much of a step up he took going to a moderate pub and night cap.</p><p>It was just a feeling but even as the sounds of partying guests filtered through the walls and from every other direction, they were sounds that he welcomed. Turning on his side once again with the monster house behind him, he was ready for the next day.</p>
