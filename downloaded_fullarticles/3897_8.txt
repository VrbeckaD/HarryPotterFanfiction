    <p>How had it come to this? Harry asked himself as he lay awake and sweating on his bed. The furnace in the centre of the room lay dusty and unused. The early autumn air filled the room as the stained-glass window by Harry’s bed stood open. <br/>Harry looked around, all his class mates slept soundly, the breeze caressed the bed hangings. He sat up and held his stomach, the pain he felt was the reason he woke. Or at least that is what he told himself. However, he couldn’t help but think "Not another one". Last night Harry had dreamt his third dream about the object of his affection.<br/>He couldn’t allow himself to rehash such a thing. To allow them to wonder into his mind while he slept was one thing, to give them substance, to give them life in broad daylight was quite another.<br/>A while later when Harry and Ron walked down towards breakfast they met Hermione, who stood waiting by the Great halls large open doors.<br/>"Come on! I don’t want to miss post!" she ordered.<br/>Ron rolled his eyes. Hermione was still good quill pals with "THE"  Victor Krum, and this annoyed Ron no end.<br/>"Who still writes to someone they met two years ago. I mean it’s not like they had much to talk about in the first place, is it?!" Ron asked Harry in a whisper as they followed Hermione.<br/>The only response Harry gave was a shrug. Usually Harry pitted Ron and was often sympathetic but today Harry was in too much pain to care.<br/>"I mean what do they find to talk about? I mean take you…."<br/>Suddenly Harry became aware that he would have to pay attention to the next thing Ron said.<br/>"You defeated you-know-who what? Six times! What’s he done? Flown around on a broom big deal, call the daily prophet!" Ranted Ron.<br/>"Maybe she just wants something a bit different. You know less predictable?!"<br/>For a second Harry thought Ron looked hurt.<br/>"Bet Krum isn’t afraid of stupid spiders". Muttered Ron.<br/>"What?" asked Harry as they both sat down on their bench.<br/>"Nothing!" said Ron sitting down and smiling an awkward shut-up smile.<br/>They were barely two months into their sixth year and already today would be the team’s first match, between Gryffindor V Hufflepuff. Though this match was just a friendly, a way to train, and therefor would not count towards the quidditch cup. Which was probably a good thing as Ron was yet to settle into the role of Keeper. He had not saved many quaffles in training and today’s game would give him extra practice. Today Ron seemed calm and collected though the letter Hermione received from Krum was probably distracting him.<br/>Harry still couldn’t quite get over the images his dream had left carved into his head. Without meaning to, Harry looked around towards the Slytherin table. Still no Draco he told himself. When he realised what he was doing, Harry looked away.<br/>"You’re not worried about getting ahead of Slytherin for the cup are you?" asked Ron before stuffing a full rasher into his mouth. Apparently, his mind finally starting to drift towards the game.<br/>"No!" Harry answered honestly even if he hoped Ron thought he was lying.</p><p>O0o0oo0o0o0</p><p>It was a blustery day on the pitch. The few spectators that had come to watch could barely see anything. Most gave up and went inside where it was warm. Coloured capes were the only distinctive feature. Even the players became confused, at one point McLaggen almost unseated Ginny.<br/>McLaggen tried to apologise but he couldn’t be heard over the sound of the wind. <br/>By the end of the game only Hermione, Dean and Luna remained in the bear Gryffindor stands. On the Hufflepuff side there had been a few more spectators. Three girls had been huddled together, Harry recognised one of them as the Hufflepuff seekers girlfriend. There had also been a group of boys who seemed to be betting packets of exploding snap cards on the outcome of the game.<br/>And yet Harry still felt the need to look for Malfoy.<br/>"You coming? It’s brass monkey’s out here!"  Ron said as he rubbed his hands together.<br/>"I guess." Muttered Harry with disappointment in his voice.<br/>"Ah come on mate. It was only a friendly! There was no way they will beat us for the cup." Ron said encouragingly as he put an arm around his friend’s neck.<br/>Ron had obviously mistaken Harry’s mood to be about the game. Harry didn’t correct him, and also noticed that Ron and cheered up even though Hermione had received a letter from Krum and they had lost the match.<br/>"Hopefully we won’t have weather like this when we play against Slytherin. I want to see Malfoy’s face when we beat them." Added Ron.<br/>It was supper time before Harry caught sight of Malfoy. He sat at the Slytherin table as usual, but something did seem odd. At first Harry couldn’t tell what but then it became obvious. Malfoy sat quietly playing with his food. This was not like Malfoy at all, usually he would be the centre of attention at the Slytherin table.<br/>Harry looked at Draco’s face, what was it showing? Definitely not his usual cockiness. Worry maybe?! Was that worry. Was he paler then usual too? Was that even possible?<br/>"Didn’t he Harry?"<br/>"Um, what? sorry!"<br/>"McLaggen? He was all over the place!" Ron Repeated.<br/>"Yeah, sure". Said Harry only half listening.<br/>"I was there Ron!" Hermione said, not for the first time. <br/>Harry turned his attention back to the Slytherin table but Malfoy was gone.<br/>Thanks Ron Harry thought.<br/>Where was it exactly that Malfoy spent all of his spare time Harry wondered. It certainly was not with Goyle, Crabbe or Blaise who all stood there looking just as annoyed to notice Malfoy’s absence as Harry was.<br/>Within weeks of being back at Hogwarts for their sixth year, Harry noticed a change in Draco. Crabbe and Goyle no longer seemed to tail Draco around the castle these days. In fact, Harry rarely saw Draco outside of classes. Harry would hear the courtyard clock chime and by the time he looked up the hem of Draco’s cloak would disappear around the class room door and out of sight. Harry Began to wonder where it was Draco spent his time.</p>
