  <b>Chapter One</b>
</p><p>
  <span>In August, Headmistress McGonagall had sent letters to all remaining seventh years who had missed a proper education at Hogwarts and invited them to complete an extra year. Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger happily agreed to attend and soon were buying above-grade level textbooks and new robes for themselves at Diagon Alley. Ron was complaining about having to take classes with Snape, and Harry was ready to retort by saying something along the lines of their Professor not surviving Nagini’s bite. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione eventually stopped Ron by saying that Snape was a hero for protecting and helping Harry last year. Ron didn’t agree, but stopped complaining. Since Harry didn’t live with the Dursleys anymore, and the blood wards had long ago fallen, he resided in the Weasley’s Burrow for the summers until he found somewhere else to live (which was exceedingly difficult). Hermione had tracked down her parents and restored their memories but visited often. Sometimes they had nightmares, and Harry’s were often worse than his friends’, but his scar never hurt again. He was relieved. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He and Ginny were still walking on eggshells ever since they seperated, but their love still burned. It was scarce when they managed a kiss because Ron was still overprotective of his little sister and didn’t want to make things awkward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even with all that, Harry was glad he had the friends he knew. They calm him when his nightmares force him to scream awake; Fred and George still cracked jokes and made new inventions for their joke shop; Molly was the best guardian of a mother he could ask for, and so was Mr Weasley. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, you alright?” Ron asked, waving a hand in front of his friend’s face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry blinked. “Oh, yeah. I’m good. Just thinking.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron made a noise and turned to his girlfriend, Hermione, and asked what else was on the list McGonagall had provided them with. As they talked, Harry let his eyes wander and saw Draco Malfoy walking into Madam Malkin’s shop. They made eye contact and Malfoy gave a respectful nod and disappeared. They had both accepted that they weren’t going to be best friends, but still held a tolerable attitude towards each other. Harry had stood up for him in the Ministry trials of the remaining Death Eaters, resulting in the lesser sentence of no magic for the year instead of a few months in Azkaban. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ever since Voldemort’s death, Harry’s scar hadn’t hurt at all since. Sometimes his nightmares would make him relive visions of his connection between him and the Dark Lord, and several times he had to convince himself that Voldemort was dead and Harry had his own soul. Nothing else. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Hermione quipped, bringing Harry out of his thoughts, “it looks like we’ve gotten everything we need, except replacement wands (which we don’t need), so now we can do some free time.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How about we visit my brothers’ joke shop?” Ron asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled at that. “Sure! I’d like to see more inventions of theirs.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They left from where they had stood in the middle of the street and headed down an juncture, coming upon the Weasley Wizarding Wheezes joke shop. They entered under the hat-welding Weasley with the rabbit upon his head, and was greeted by a crowd of witches and wizards with George up on a balcony and Fred coaxing a kid to take one of the puke-inducing sweets from a great bucket. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>George waved a hand from above. “Ronikins! How is our sweet little boy doing?” Fred took notice and laughed along with his twin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron’s ears turned red and his expression sour. “I’m doing fine, you dimwits.” Fred approached from the kid who’d snuck away and George raced down the stairs to greet the trio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aw,” George cooed, “that’s not nice!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron’s face turned red. “Will you stop?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fred went up to Harry and Hermione and smiled. “How are you doing, you two? You get McGonagall’s letter?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled and so did Hermione. “Yes,” he said, “we’ve actually just finished shopping now. Have you guys done anything?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>George turned from tormenting Ron and joined his twin. “Do we have to keep telling you? We’re done with our education, Harrykins.” At that, he batted his eyelashes and gave an innocent smile. Harry looked away, blushing as Fred’s eyes widened and he gasped dramatically. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? What is it?” Harry asked suddenly, bewildered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You like blokes?” Fred stage-whispered. Harry looked scandalized. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” He protested as Hermione laughed and Ron gagged. “Ginny and I are still a thing!” Fred chuckled at that and said, “If you’re sure…” Harry didn’t have a retort for that one and only looked away, gritting his teeth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The trio proceeded to purchase fake wands and fake make-a-broomstick kits for future pranking on others. They weren’t very keen on it, but every once and a while it was nice to do something fun. Besides, if one of them forgot their purchases, another could abuse that and prank them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They left the Weasley’s joke shop, left Diagon Alley through the Leaky Cauldron and Apparated to the Burrow. With hands heavy of shopping parcels, the trio made their way and greeted the rest of Weasleys as they did everyday. </span>
