    <p>“Straight through there?” Jacelyn Johnson asked incredulously. </p><p>“Yes, Jace, straight through the barrier. I promise, you won’t just bang into it.” Mervin Johnson pushed his daughter forward, impatient. “Go on.” </p><p>Jacelyn stumbled and grabbed her trolley for balance, sighing. She looked at the very solid, very real barrier and shook her head to calm her nerves. She took a step forward, then another, slowly building up speed. Eventually, she broke into a full out run and collided with the barrier. </p><p>Or, she should have collided with the barrier. </p><p>Instead, she found herself on a bustling platform full of people, owls, trunks, and excitement. Jacelyn couldn’t help her smile as she looked around. She found herself lost in everything around her - she’d never been allowed into the Wizarding World before except to get her wand. </p><p>“Agh!” </p><p>Jacelyn cringed as she felt a body slam into her. </p><p>“Stupid girl! Can’t even get out of the way when you know others are coming through behind you!” </p><p>The brown haired girl flinched as she saw her father raise his hand. “Wait! I’m sorry! I was making sure nothing fell after I stopped!” Jacelyn glanced around, hoping someone, anyone, would come through the barrier behind them. She then trained her eyes back on Mervin and watched as he looked around at all the other people around them, and slowly lower his hand. </p><p>“You better be glad you’re not coming home today,” he muttered in her ear. Then he stood, grabbed her trunk, and stalked off towards the train. </p><p>Jacelyn rubbed her arm as she followed her father, a safe four paces behind him. When they reached the train, her father merely thrust her trunk in her direction. Then, with a grunted farewell, he was gone.<br/>

Jacelyn sighed as she pulled her trunk onto the train with her, trying to find an empty compartment. She decided she was having a lucky day when the first compartment she came to was unoccupied. The girl threw her trunk up on the seat next to her, hoping people would take the hint like they did on the school busses and leave her alone. It was the first time in her life she could finally be free of her father, and she did not want some kid ruining it when she would have to spend all her time with them later. </p><p>As the minutes ticked by and nobody opened her compartment door Jacelyn got comfortable, leaning against the window and bringing her feet up on the seat to join her. She was just thinking that maybe she’d have some alone time when a bushy haired girl walked in followed by a chubby brown haired boy. Jacelyn shrugged as the girl motioned to the seat opposite her, and the pair sat down. </p><p>“Hi, I’m Hermione Granger,” the girl said. </p><p>“And I’m Neville Longbottom,” the boy added. </p><p>Jacelyn looked at them for a second before sitting up. “I’m Jacelyn Johnson.” </p><p>The bushy haired girl - Granger, she’d said her name was - nodded. “Are you a first year, too?” </p><p>Jacelyn nodded. “Yeah, but my father has been teaching me magic since I was little.” </p><p>Granger’s eyes lit up and she smiled. “Really? That’s amazing! I wish I had parents who could teach me magic, but neither of my parents are wizards. I’ve been trying to read up as much as possible, though, so I don’t seem underprepared when we get to school.” </p><p>“Ah, you’re a muggleborn. Must have been amazing to find out wizardry is real after all the stories muggles tell about us.” </p><p>“A muggleborn?” </p><p>“Y’know, someone born from two non-wizards. C’mon, Granger, your books must have at least taught you that.” </p><p>“Hermione,” the other girl corrected automatically. “And I guess I just didn’t read about it. Maybe it wasn’t an important topic.” </p><p>Jacelyn frowned. Blood status wasn’t important to her but it definitely was to a good amount of people. “Hm,” was her reply. Then she leaned back and stared out the window, wondering what school would be like. </p><p>They sat in silence for a time before an exclaimed, “Trevor! Trevor no! Come back!” was heard. Neville ran out of the compartment before running back in. “Hermione! Can you help me find Trevor? My nan gave him to me.” </p><p>Hermione immediately stood and ran out of the compartment with Neville. Jacelyn took that time to change into her school uniform and her robes. They’d be reaching Hogwarts eventually, after all.<br/>
~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~</p><p>The train pulled into the station and students were herded out of the compartments. They were told not to worry about their trunks, as the House Elves would take care of that. As Hagrid motioned them toward what looked like a small fleet of rowboats, Jacelyn lost Hermione and Neville. Instead, she ended up in a boat with a boy who introduced himself as “Malfoy, Draco Malfoy,” and some kids who seemed to be his sidekicks. The brunette laughed as she was reminded of James Bond, except James Bond was much cooler and wasn’t eleven years old. </p><p>The group walked up the entrance to the castle and the doors swung open to reveal Professor McGonagall, as she was introduced. The first years followed her past a large doorway, where Jacelyn presumed the rest of the school would be, from the noise. Instead, they were brought to a large empty room and told about the Sorting Ceremony. McGonagall explained the four houses, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, and that they should wait there for the sorting process to begin. </p><p>While they were waiting, a ghost popped in and Jacelyn’s eyebrows rose. She’d never seen a ghost before. McGonagall came back and ushered them out before Jacelyn could get her nerves back and talk to the ghosts. As they were leaving, Hermione noticed her and came over. </p><p>“I wonder what’s going to happen…” </p><p>Jacelyn simply nodded and stood in line as the Sorting Hat began to sing. After, she heard McGonagall instruct them all again, this time telling them that they were to come up and sit when their name was called. Easy enough. </p><p>The first to go up was named Hannah Abbott, who ended up in Hufflepuff. The next was Susan Bones, who also ended up in Hufflepuff. Jacelyn began to zone out until she heard “Granger, Hermione!” She figured she should pay attention, maybe she would end up in the same house as the girl. She would be a good study partner. </p><p>“Gryffindor!” </p><p>Jacelyn heard a groan from a redhead down the line and shook her head. That was no way to react to a sorting. She did feel a little let down, though, because she knew there was no way she was getting sorted into Gryffindor. </p><p>“Johnson, Jacelyn!” </p><p>Jacelyn moved and sat on the stool, chanting “Not Hufflepuff. Not Hufflepuff,” in her mind. Her father would never let her live it down if she was sorted into Hufflepuff. </p><p>“Hmm…,” said a voice in her ear. “Not Hufflepuff, huh? What’s wrong with the ‘Puffs?” The hat paused for a moment before seeming to read her mind. “Ah, your father. Well, you do seem to be quite a clever kid. And ambitious too…” The hat paused again, and Jacelyn could tell the Hall was confused about what was taking so long. “Well, I guess I’ll place you in… SLYTHERIN!”</p>
