    <p>Elphaba’s delight and dread were indistinguishable, both tugging incessantly at their gut and making this whole experience way to confusing. This was first year. It was freedom, but with a good chance of solitude. The weird looks and whispers followed them everywhere, and children were the least subtle offenders. A year among that… but it was also a whole year at Hogwarts. With libraries to scour and feasts to enjoy and quidditch games and classes and maybe… well, maybe friends.</p><p>Elphaba eyed the Hogwarts Express, gleaming and steaming in the crisp London air, and gathering the students off the platform and into its carriages. As they stepped through the crowd it parted like it always did, people turning and stepping back; apprehension, confusion, disgust. Without engaging the whispers, they lifted their trunk onboard and hurried to the closest empty cabin, shoving the door aside and finding refuge alone.</p><p>As the hour ticked closer to Eleven the platform began to empty, the last stragglers hurrying onboard. Elphaba watched them all, wondering at their lives and their feelings and their attitudes to green.</p><p>There was no one to wave them goodbye. Nessa and Shell and Nanny were back home and Frex was… whatever. It wasn’t like they really cared. But it might have been nice.</p><p>There was a clunk and the door to the cabin pulled back to reveal a short boy with mousey blonde hair and a round, open face. His smile flickered as he looked Elphaba over, and they prepared for some insensitive question or cruel remark.</p><p>“Mind if I set with you?” he asked, voice still bright. He wore a funny little cap and a t-shirt that read ‘Tutshill Tonrnadoes Quidditch’. Harmless enough. Elphaba nodded.</p><p>“Thanks,” he grinned pulling the door open further and shuffling inside and then pausing, biting his lip and offering his hand. “I’m Boq. Boq Hardings.”</p><p>Elphaba gave it a firm shake. “Elphaba.”</p><p>He slid his trunk away and took the seat across from them.</p><p>“So…” he started awkwardly, and Elphaba figured they may as well get it over with.</p><p>“You can say it.”</p><p>“You’re… green?”</p><p>“Birth defect.”</p><p>Boq nodded and glanced out the window. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to…”</p><p>“You won’t be the first,” Elphaba shrugged. “It is what it is.”</p><p>“So, ah… what house do you think you’ll be in?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” they lied. “You?”</p><p>“Hufflepuff, I hope,” he grinned, and Elphaba had to work hard to suppress a snort. Of course this guy was a Puff.</p><p>“That’s cool.”</p><p>There was a soft knock and the cabin door opened again to reveal a boy with dark eyes and deep skin and the most extraordinary electric blue tattoos shining across his shoulders and face.</p><p>“Any spare seats?” he asked with a disarming smile, and Boq sat up a little straighter.</p><p>“Plenty,” he nodded, and the new boy pushed in to offer Boq a hand.</p><p>“Fiyero Tigelaar, at your service.”</p><p>“Boq Hardings.”</p><p>“Elphaba,” they nodded, letting him take the seat next to Boq and hoping he’d stop staring soon.</p><p>“I’m guessing that’s not makeup?” Fiyero asked brazenly, and Elphaba bit back a pang of frustration.</p><p>“Birth defect.”</p><p>“Wow,” Fiyero raised his brow, staring blatantly.</p><p>“That’s one way of putting it,” Elphaba looked away, trying not to look too uncomfortable with his gawking.</p><p>“Would you change it?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I mean if there was a spell to change it, would you?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m not answering that.”</p><p>There was a horrendously awkward pause in which Elphaba glared out the window and Fiyero pretended to get comfortable.</p><p>“So,” Boq began again, failing to hide his discomfort. “Do you guys have any… ah, brothers or sisters?”</p><p>“A sister,” Fiyero grinned. “Older. You?”</p><p>“A bunch, but I’m the oldest,” Boq beamed, and they both turned to Elphaba expectantly.</p><p>“A sister and a brother. Both younger,” they offered, silently thanking this kid for his heart of solid gold.</p><p>“So, umm…” he rubbed the back of his neck, looking to Elphaba but refusing to meet their eyes. “Elphaba, right? So um, what pronouns do you prefer?”</p><p>Elphaba blinked at him, their heart lurching unexpectedly. That was… he had bothered to… too late, they realised a long moment had passed and they hadn’t said a word. Boq’s face fell.</p><p>“Sorry, I mean I didn’t mean to offend you or anything I just…” he blabbered.</p><p>“No, it’s cool,” Elphaba cut in, giving him a small smile. “I just didn’t expect… but um, it’s they/them.”</p><p>“So you’re, ah, non-binary or…?” Fiyero asked, genuine curiosity peeking through his uncertainty.</p><p>“Yeah. I mean I was already green so I figured what the hell,” they shrugged. Boq grinned and Fiyero let out a bark of laughter, and Elphaba let themself smile just a little again.</p><p>That was… surprisingly painless.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>“Galinda Arduenna,” Professor McGonagall read, and a girl a head shorter than Elphaba, with perfectly coiled blonde hair and posture to kill, broke from the crowd and pranced up to the stool. Her confidence was almost insulting, but her bright smile was not quite sincere. She didn’t look eleven, she looked about thirteen, but it was all in the pomposity and stride. Professor McGonagall lowered the Hat onto her head and it scrunched its worn face up, huffing.</p><p>“Well, that’s interesting, isn’t it? Not a hard one though. Slytherin!” the Hat declared, and something other than confidence twitched in the curve of the girl’s lips. Something like doubt, but in a second it was gone and she gave another beaming smile as the Hat was taken from her brow and she stalked toward the table of cheering green.</p><p>The names flittered by and Elphaba barely paid attention, their dread rising as the list grew closer and closer to the letter T. There was a Pfannee Hall who giggled her way to the Slytherin table, and Boq seemed pretty thrilled at being sorted into Hufflepuff. After one Avaric Tenmeadows was sorted into Gryffindor, and the Great Hall had fallen quiet again, there came the “Elphaba Thropp” they had been dreading.</p><p>The crowd parted as they moved forward, eyes flicking to them, growing shock evident as Elphaba lowered themself onto the stool. As the hall came into clear view, it fell very, very quiet. Then the whispers started.</p><p><em>Are they really green? I thought the Thropp family was pureblood, what the hell happened with that one?</em> <em>Do you think it was an accident?</em> <em>A curse? They look like a damn vegetable.</em></p><p>Then the hat was resting on their head, surprisingly heavy, and it began its muttering conjecture as it dug through their thoughts.</p><p>“There’s a heart in here, that’s for sure. Brave too, without a doubt, but you’re no fool, no fool at all. But there’s something else… hmm… Understanding. That’s what you seek. Understanding, and to be understood. A rare soul, you have. Hmm, yes, I know where you belong. Ravenclaw!”</p><p>There was a polite cheering, and they slipped from the stool, and walked tall toward the Ravenclaw table, trying to hide the shaking of their hands and the relief on their face. A few girls slid aside and introduced themselves with uncertain smiles and faces full of questions.</p><p>“Fiyero Tigelaar,” Professor McGonagall called, and the Sorting continued as Fiyero strutted over to the uproarious Gryffindor table.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>“Girls to the left, boys to the right,” the Prefect instructed, and Elphaba’s whole heart sank.</p><p>As the rest of the first years scattered to their dorms, chattering excitedly, they hung back and waited for the Common Room to clear.</p><p>“Um, Alban?” they stepped toward their prefect tentatively, and saw recognition flash in his eyes.</p><p>“Hey, yeah. You must be Elphaba, right?” he gave a confident smile and they nodded. “Professor Flitwick said he wanted to see you asap. His office is just down the hall. Come on, I’ll show you.”</p><p>He wasn’t lying, it really was just a few steps outside of the door. Alban gave a firm knock and Flitwick’s voice squeaked “Enter.”</p><p>“I’ll see you round,” Alban grinned, and pushed the door open for Elphaba to enter.</p><p>“Ah, Elphaba Thropp, isn’t it? Come in, come in,” Flitwick waved a hand and the door clicked shut as he shifted a stack of books to clear Elphaba a place to sit. He was a lot shorter up close. Elphaba wasn’t sure if that was an offensive thing to think but it was definitely true. “I received your letter, and I must say I’m very grateful you took the initiative. I’m afraid I wouldn’t have known what to do otherwise. As it stands, I’ve done a little preparation.”</p><p>“Preparation, Professor?” Elphaba asked, lowering to the offered seat.</p><p>“Yes, yes, preparation!” He rustled around his desk before producing a piece of parchment and passing it over. “I compiled a list of alternatives titles. Now if you could just take a look and tell me which you would prefer?”</p><p>“Well, I think the easiest for everyone else would…”</p><p>“That was not my question,” Flitwick cut them off with a firm but kind look, and Elphaba bit their tongue. “What would <em>you</em> prefer, Elphaba?”</p><p>They took a proper look at the list. <em>Misc, Tiz, Mir, Mx, Ind…</em></p><p>“Mir, Professor,” they decided. “I would prefer Mir Thropp.”</p><p>“Well then, Mir Thropp, I’ll be sure to inform the rest of the staff. If there are any issues, my door is always open. Figuratively, of course.”</p><p>“Thanks, Professor.”</p><p>“Don’t thank me yet! I’m sure you’re aware we usually split the dormitories into girls and boys but that just won’t do.”</p><p>“I was thinking I could...” they began again, but Flitwick cut them off with another wave of his hand.</p><p>“No, no, hear me out first. Actually,” he snapped his fingers and the door sprung open. “Best to show you, I think.”</p><p>Before they could respond he was up and hurrying for the door, and he didn’t stop until they were back in the Common Room, standing in front of the statue of Rowena Ravenclaw and the entrances to the dormitories.</p><p>“I’ve discussed alternatives with the Headmaster and we’ve agreed this is the most suitable,” Flitwick said with a decisive nod as he raised his wand. “<em>Revelio!</em>”</p><p>There was a small flash and the wall began to fall away like sand in an hourglass, carving itself out. Elphaba realised with a small grin that it was shaping itself into a third door in the blank space between the other two.</p><p>“For yourself, Mir Thropp, and any future students who would prefer it. Now if that is all, I think I’ll leave you to your unpacking. Your bags will be waiting inside.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir,” Elphaba nodded, swallowing hard against their rising emotions.</p><p>“I will see you in Charms, Mir Thropp. Until then!” the Professor said in his rather high voice, and then departed with a satisfied nod.</p><p>Elphaba took in a deep breath and pushed the third door open. Their door. For now, it was just theirs.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>All things considered, their first week was going pretty well, and by the third day the snide comments of their peers were generally missing their mark. Rather unexpectedly, there was a strange solidarity among the Ravenclaws that formed around Elphaba. The other first years hadn’t exactly leapt at the chance to sit near them or strike up conversations, but whenever some idiot from another house started throwing insults, there always seemed to be a Ravenclaw nearby to leap in and throw them right back, or to offer Elphaba a seat, or a kind smile.</p><p>They had Charms with Boq and the Hufflepuffs, Flying with Fiyero and the other Gryffindors, and now History of Magic with…</p><p>“Wrong house, Green Bean?</p><p>Oh, History with the Slytherins. Great.</p><p>They looked up to see who’d spoken, and found Galinda, the blonde girl with perfect posture, smirking across the classroom at them from her seat on the desk. Around her were arrayed Pfannee and Shenshen and a bunch of Slytherins she’d clearly collected. Third day and she’d already planted herself firmly at the top of the pile. She worked fast.</p><p>A few Ravenclaw heads turned at the insult.</p><p>“No,” Elphaba shrugged nonchalantly. It was hardly an original. They eyed Galinda, gaze lingering on the green of her tie and the group of Slytherins, not bothering to hid their disgust. “I think the Hat got it just right.”</p><p>Something darted across Galinda’s face, but all too quickly it was replaced by a cruel smile. “Perhaps you’re right. I’m sure you’d clash with our green. Besides, we wouldn’t want a Thropp dirtying up the Common Room.”</p><p>Elphaba tensed, and glared across the classroom, preparing a dozen biting remarks before they felt someone tugging at their sleeve.</p><p>“Hey, forget her,” came a voice, and Elphaba glanced down to find another Ravenclaw they half recognised. “She's not worth it. You’re Elphaba, right?”</p><p>“Yeah,” they nodded, trying to quash their rising anger and keep their eyes from drifting back to the blonde's posse.</p><p>“Here, I’m not waiting for anyone,” the girl smiled, sliding across and offering Elphaba the seat beside her. They took it gratefully. Galinda seemed to have already lost interest.</p><p>“I’m Sarima,” she offered her hand, and Elphaba shook it. “Sarima Ko.”</p><p>“Elphaba.”</p><p>“It’s cool to finally meet you.”</p><p>“Take your seats, take your seats!” came a voice from the back of the room, and an old Faun clopped his way to the desk up the front, dropping a stack of books onto the table and turning to face the quieting room. “Good afternoon class. I am Doctor Dillamond, and I welcome you to History of Magic.”</p><p>The hour flew by. Elphaba absorbed every word Dillamond spoke and when he began to wrap things up they could hardly believe the time had passed at all, and were already searching their timetable for when next class was. Thursday. Thursday couldn’t come sooner.</p><p>Dillamond dismissed the class and the others filed out, leaving Elphaba lingering behind.</p><p>“Doctor Dillamond, sir?” they asked, stepping toward the Faun’s desk as he turned to give a warm smile.</p><p>“Ah yes, Mir Thropp, isn’t it? A pleasure.”</p><p>“About what you were saying on the Gargoyle Strike of 1911…”</p><p>“Ah, yes. A fascinating period. Unionized gargoyles and all that.”</p><p>“I was wondering if there was somewhere I could read a bit more on it. Only our textbook is pretty thin on the subject.”</p><p>“Extra reading already, Mir Thropp?” Dillamond chuckled, peering over his glasses at them. “I do believe we will get along splendidly.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Classes were easy, but that was nothing new. Having their own room was a surprising and welcome bonus. No one to bother them at three in the morning when they were still up reading, and no one to tell them to pick up their socks. Not that that needed being said. They’d always been a pretty neat person.</p><p>Friends were another matter. They didn’t exactly have friends (at least, they didn’t think so) but they had a fair few acquaintances. The novelty of green person got tiring pretty quickly, and everyone sort of got on with it. Boq seemed absolutely determined to be their friend, seizing ownership of the seat next to theirs in Charms and never letting go. They didn’t mind. He was irritatingly persistent, but it didn’t absolutely suck.</p><p>Sarima stuck by them in History of Magic, and Fiyero was friendly in Flying. Mostly though, it was just avoiding the sharp words of the catty Slytherins and occasional brash Gryffindor and finding a decent book to occupy them until next class or next meal.</p><p>Plus, they threw themself into extra study. A lot of it. When Professor Sprout found them in the Library late one night hunched over a third year textbook, she let out a hearty laugh before summoning a well-worn hardcover and placing it down in front of them, saying only that this would prove far more interesting. She wasn’t wrong.</p><p>When the first break arrived and most other students were preparing to head home, Elphaba found themself looking forward to a mostly empty castle ripe for exploring. When Boq bounced up to them in Charms and announced he’d be staying over the break too, they didn’t actually mind the thought of company.</p><p>The holidays came and went, and Elphaba was surprised to find themself becoming rather fond of Boq. He was a pretty decent kid, and after the first time, had never mentioned their skin again. In fact, they’d even heard second hand that he’d been defending them behind their back when others started muttering, which was more than they probably deserved.</p><p>When the sun was out and Boq insisted, Elphaba sometimes found themself on the grass by the Black Lake (as far from the water as they could manage without suspicion), sitting with Boq and a few of his friends. Sometimes that included Sarima, sometimes Fiyero and the boy named Avaric. Most unexpectedly, whenever one of them couldn’t figure out their homework or got stumped revising, they came to Elphaba. It was a strange thing, to be needed. Most still glanced at them funny when they thought Elphaba wasn’t looking, but they were long since used to it. Still, they had a place. They were the nerd, and everyone pretty much assumed they had an answer to every question, and they usually did.</p><p>When the marks came out at the end of the year, no one batted an eye when Elphaba came top of almost every class. Almost, being fairly key. They weren’t even near the top of Flying, but that was pretty unsurprising. There was a bunch of Quidditch wannabes that were battling for top and they didn’t mind conceding that class.</p><p>What was surprising was Defence Against the Dark Arts. They’d been top all year, with a few close seconds, but when Professor Nikidik announced the exam marks, one Miss Galinda Arduenna had beat them for the top score by half a mark.</p><p>The Slytherins threw a bunch of snickering glares and snide words, but when Elphaba had glanced at Galinda, the blonde girl only gave them a soft nodded. Not cruel or malicious, just a simple acknowledgment of victory and defeat. Elphaba gave a nod in return, and that was that. It was the most harmless interaction they’d had all year. Sure, it sucked to lose, and to lose to Galinda Arduenna, Queen of the First Year Slytherins, sucked even more, but fair was fair. She must have been smart. Way smarter than she let on, anyway.</p><p>When Professor Sinistra dropped their marked Astronomy exams on their desks in the final class, Elphaba was annoyed to find they’d scored second yet again. Second to Galinda Arduenna. Second by a full mark this time. It seemed they had a rival they hadn’t prepared for.</p><p>Everything else though, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, all went to Elphaba. A couple of people even asked quietly if they’d be willing to help them out next year. At first they’d been too flustered to respond, but after the third person, they’d just nodded and said yes.</p><p>Even with all those victories, their thoughts stuck on Galinda. After the first few weeks, she’d had little to say to them. The insults dried up and she seemed to lost interest in the Green Bean. She still didn’t step in when her cronies had thrown insults, but she hadn’t exactly joined them either. It was a weird middle ground that Elphaba couldn’t figure out, and really didn’t enjoy. That was, until one late night early in their second year, when everything had settled back into the rhythm of school and Elphaba had accidentally broken curfew. Again.</p><p>The sun had set without them even noticing, and when they looked up and realised they were already breaking about six school rules, they considered the repercussions. Getting caught now would be kind of bad. Probably at least a detention. Getting caught in two hours’ time? Probably the same.</p><p>They crept out of their hiding place and into the library proper, still warm but absolutely pitch black. It might have been suffocating, but Elphaba found it a comfort. It was easier to sink back into the shadows when you were green.</p><p>They lifted their bag close to their chest and set out toward the back, where the full moon light would be shining through the arched windows, just enough to read by. When they rounded the corner, the soft padding of their shoes barely audible, they stopped dead still and blinked rapidly.</p><p>There, with books strewn around her and blonde hair irritatingly luminous in the moonlight, sat Galinda Arduenna.</p><p>Elphaba sunk back, a part of them ready to turn and flee this intrusion, but a bigger part wondering what the hell Galinda was doing studying after curfew in the library. Sure, she was smart, but she’d never shown any sign of investing in it. She was too cool to be seen studying. Too cool to actually care. At least… well, wasn’t she?</p><p>They remained fused to the spot, eyes unmoving from Galinda’s pale face. She frowned in concentration, an expression Elphaba could only describe as adorable. What cruel intentions lay beneath that soft exterior? What malice did she hide? Would it hurt to show themself? They were both breaking curfew, after all.</p><p>They stepped out from the shadows and into the moonlight, letting their bag fall to their side and making as much noise as quietly possible.</p><p>Galinda jumped, books clattering to the ground as she scrambled back, eyes darting up.</p><p>“Sweet Merlin, Elphaba,” she breathed, taking in a deep breath, and saying their name as though she'd ever used it before. “You didn’t have to sneak up like some monster in the night.”</p><p>“I thought I was the Green Bean,” they replied, tone level, and noted with some satisfaction the way Galinda winced.</p><p>“Yeah, I…” she trailed off. Elphaba waited expectantly for her to finish, only to be met with no answer. “Were you hear to study or…? I mean I know it’s past curfew but…”</p><p>“It’s fine. I won’t tell anyone you were here,” they said, turning to go.</p><p>“Really?” Galinda asked, and Elphaba realised it was the first time she’d ever sounded anything less than absolutely confident.</p><p>“Who would believe me, anyway?” they shrugged, and left without another word. They could study back in their room without Galinda Arduenna being… whatever she was being.</p>
