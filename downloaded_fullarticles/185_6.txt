    <p>The silence is what woke Remus, although it wasn't totally unusual for him to wake up before his alarm went off. The room was still a soft and welcoming golden orange from the sun just rising, already warming up his small, shared dorm space to a pleasant temperature. It was still summer though and it was only a matter of another hour or so before the heat climbed an uncomfortable high. He carefully turned over in his bed to the opposite of the room, attempting his best to be quiet, where he saw that his roommate was in fact not still asleep, but not there to begin with.</p><p> </p><p><em> ‘That can’t be good,” </em> Remus thought to himself before he rubbed the sleep from his eyes and slowly clawed his way out of bed onto his feet. He couldn’t remember if there had ever been a time he had seen Evan out of bed before he absolutely had to wake up, and wondered if this early disappearance had something to do with his now <em>third</em> detention he had been given yesterday afternoon in only the first week into the school year.  Remus decided not to bother himself with thoughts on his distasteful roommate right now, rather enjoying being able to get ready without dealing with constant taunts and digs that get thrown at him for simply existing.</p><p> </p><p>He walked into the small, white and sea foam green tiled bathroom that was big enough only for one person to be in at a time, which often ended in Remus getting thrown out the second he got out of the shower, as Evan demanded he needed it more and would quickly lock himself inside. Remus preferred not to push it and ask why, because he really didn’t think he wanted to know the answer. </p><p> </p><p>The boy splashed cold water onto his face as a fast wake-me-up and ran his wet hands through his longer, almost shoulder length, blonde curls. He was rather fond of his hair, feeling like it was the closest he could ever get to looking like the rock stars he idolized on TV at home. It took a lot of convincing his father not to make him cut it, with much help from his mother, and even more for the Headmaster to not suspend him until it was a standard length.( It helped that Headmaster Albus seemed to favour him from the rest of the boys at St. Godrics.) </p><p> </p><p>Remus didn’t believe himself to be much to look at with his slightly crooked nose and teeth, heavily freckled face that had been marked by a large scar that ran across a whole left cheek, and a far too skinny figure. So, unknowingly, it had become a sort of security blanket for him in the last year. He ignored the insults and jabs that the other boys flung at him throughout the day despite being often self-conscious and, truthfully a <em> tad </em>overly-sensitive, because it was really the only thing he liked about himself at this extent in his life.</p><p> </p><p>He trailed out of the bathroom over to his small, cherry oak wardrobe provided by the school and ran his hand across his limited collection of school clothes. Just the year before it would’ve been overflowing with sweater vests, dress trousers and white button ups but with the end of last summer came the beginning of his growth spurt. He was oddly discouraged when only a quarter of his school attire was replaced with his new, proper size, but he understood his parents just didn’t have the money to spend. At least he still had his many cardigans, that no matter how tall he gets, always seem to look like they’re consuming him whole.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Getting dressed was a thoughtless dance at this point, buttoning his shirt and tucking it into his trousers, throwing on his tie and stuffing one of said cardigans into his school bag just in case he were to get cold in class (he always does), and sliding on his polished oxfords before finally slipping out of his room without a single glance in the mirror. </p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>To put it simply, Remus was a boy of routine and habit. Every morning he has porridge mixed with a raspberry jam that he eats with lightly buttered wheat toast. Once he finishes the bowl, he sets it aside and pulls out his homework he completed the night before to revise to the closest form of perfection he can manage at 8:30 in the morning while sipping on a cuppa. At 8:50, he puts all his belongings away back into his bag and sets off to his first class of the day - History.</p><p> </p><p>History was gladly one of his favourite subjects, as it often felt like an escape from his own rather dim and tedious life, pulling him into much more exciting worlds of the past. Often learning about wars, which wasn’t a basic idea he fancied, but more just the concept of something much more wild, dangerous even, being a reality that once happened. ‘<em> Still happens’ </em>he supposed, the combat in Vietnam only ending last year. </p><p> </p><p>Listening intently to the Professor while scribbling his notes as quickly as possible, letting out a cough here and there, he felt perfectly content and in his own world. Time flew by as always in the early part of the day and class was dismissed in what seemed like minutes to Remus. He began packing his books and notepads away, the comfort of what he considered an ‘easy class’ falling, dreading the next class. <em> Maths.  </em>He sighed and walked out off the classroom and down the hallway. He always tried not to bring too much attention to himself, but he was a bit of a people-watcher against his own willpower. He found people to be rather fascinating. He'd stare at whoever caught his attention until he was forced to stop either due to them looking back, or him walking too far past. Sometimes he wondered if he ever caught peoples attention.</p><p>Once he had gotten to Professor Binns door, he gave another sigh, which turned into a cough and walked inside begrudgingly.</p><p> </p><p>Remus was a wonderful and bright student, devoted most his days outside of classes to studying, revising and quizzing himself. But maths were never his strong suit, and it certainly didn’t help that his seat was next to a stirring mess of uncertainty named Peter Pettitgrew who religiously asked for Remus’ help despite constantly telling the other boy he understood just as little as he did. </p><p> </p><p>Remus should’ve been more annoyed by him honestly, but he always ended up feeling too bad for the short, scruffy boy to tell him to piss off completely,  even if when he wasn’t whining over his perplexed mental state he would be practically bragging about his, <em>“Very popular</em> <em>friend</em> James Potter!” As if Remus didn’t know who the rugby captain of the school was! </p><p> </p><p>James Potter was just one of those boys who really, truly believed they were invincible. He barely ever studied outside of exam periods and always made excellent scores, he had girlfriends who would sneak on grounds during classes that he’d skip and somehow always talk his way out of detention once caught, he was beloved by his classmates and idolized by the underdogs (i.e. Pettigrew). Worst of all, he also had a best friend who couldn’t just be as bad, but somehow impossibly worse..</p><p> </p><p>Sirius Black. The heir of the Black legacy, he would one day be the beneficiary of an ungodly amount of money and the business that made all of it. Sirius was undoubtedly handsome, a natural born aristocrat who moved in a blundering, contradictory grace. Always louder, always witty, <em> always </em>the center of attention. He and James were a cocktail for disaster and proved it practically everyday with their immature little pranks, rattling conversations at dinner of obscene and gaudy subjects, and never to forget how they live and breathe for rugby. </p><p> </p><p>And <em>Peter</em> who followed them around like a little dog with no backbone of his known, allowing himself to be used as a dummy and take any blame. Remus didn't like to be mean, even in his own head, but he thought if anyone were more pathetic than himself it would have to be Peter. The three of them were rather vile, but especially the two dark haired ones.</p><p> </p><p>Chairs screeching from being pushed back pulled Remus from his thoughts, as students started making their way towards the exit of the classroom. He groaned softly and ran his fingers through his hair, annoyed. He hadn’t paid any mind the whole class, too distracted thinking about the those complete ponces he aims to avoid every waking moment he’s in school. He’d have to ask Frank, the closest thing to a friend Remus has, to help him study again later, hoping he won't be to grouchy about it cutting in with his phone call time with his <em>girlfriend</em>, Alice. He quickly packed up and made his way to his next class, already wishing for the day to be over.</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>Dinner was always something else it seemed. Remus would sit across from Frank, they would talk lightly about their day while eating their meals and sometimes Remus would tell a joke or two which always earned him a laugh from his sort-of-friend. He didn’t really consider Frank a friend due to the fact they both never talked outside of dinner and study sessions. Remus liked him well enough, sure, but they just didn’t ever seem to become anything more than acquaintances. They never talked about their personal lives and never seemed to care much to do so, they just worried about schoolwork and kept each other company during supper.</p><p> </p><p>“Remus, you really are quite funny sometimes, I dunno why you're so quiet--” And just like that, like everyone was waiting for it, Frank and anyone else in mid-conversation was cut off by the famous duo making their entrance into the dining hall laughing like mad and carrying-- </p><p> </p><p>“Oh good god, are those bloody fireworks? How the hell did they even get those?” Remus asked seemingly to himself. He broke his stare on the two deviants that were taking the spotlight of the room, Peter a few feet behind them with an uneasy look on his face, then looked back at Frank. They both sighed, shrugged, and slowly crawled underneath their table wordlessly, knowing that when those boys walk in laughing like animals the only thing that's going to follow is inescapable chaos.</p><p> </p><p>Remus really wondered how neither of those boys had been expelled yet as they paraded around the dining tables, aimlessly going on and on to each other,</p><p> </p><p>“James, you know what this terribly dull excuse of a dining hall could use?” Sirius asked loudly, not looking at his friend who was strutting right next to him, only grinning from ear to ear making eye contact with any other boy in the room. It was a strong mix of half the boys laughing and beginning to cheer them on, and the other half deadly quiet, wishing whatever was going to happen to already be done.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I’m not so sure my friend,” James laughed out, “What did you have in mind?” </p><p> </p><p>Sirius comically let out a thoughtful hum, before snapping his fingers and turning to his friend,</p><p> </p><p>“Ah! I was thinking possibly a <em> flare </em> of some sort would really brighten this <em>drab</em> space up--”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Boys! </em> ” Remus heard Professor McGonagall voice rip through the room. “If I were you two and fancied not getting a months detention, I would dispose of those <em> dangerous </em> and <em>illegal </em>contraptions and lower your <em> voices.”  </em></p><p> </p><p>He peeked his head back above the table just to see the two boys slowly look away from the Professor, to each other, wicked smiles plastered on their faces. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> One. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Oh Minnie,” Sirius purred, “You know you <em> love us. </em>Well-” he reached into his pocket, giving out a bark of a laugh.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Two. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I know you love me the most.” Sirius flashed a devastating smirk, flicking at his lighter, bringing the flame to the strings of the fireworks James was holding.</p><p> </p><p>McGonagall went to scream once again-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Three! </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>  --</p><p> </p><p>When Remus finally reached the door to his room he practically spilled into it, desperately wanting nothing more than a shower and sleep, but there on his respective bed, flipping through a magazine, was Evan.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.” Remus paused in the doorway, “Um. Where were you this morning?”</p><p> </p><p>“None of your business, poof.” </p><p> </p><p>The blonde grimaced at the smear, but kept his mouth shut, quietly grabbing his pajamas and making his way to the bathroom. He locked the door, a precaution related to who he lived with, and started the water. It was rare Evan did get physical with his aggression's, he stuck mostly to words as he was on a last line with the Headmaster ever since his last beating on a 4th year who was “in his way”, but Remus didn’t want to take any chances. He kept his mouth shut around the other boy and his valuables hidden.</p><p> </p><p>Once out of the shower, dried off and changed he came back to the bedroom only to find Evan gone once again. He felt a strange twist in his stomach, knowing something wasn't right, but he tried to push the feeling away, deciding to use the opportunity to write home for the first time in a couple weeks. Far too long as Remus was concerned for how close he was to his parents. He sunk to the floor next to his bed and fished out his record player, his one big secret he sneaks in every year, and quickly flicked through his record carrier deciding on - Station to Station.</p><p> </p><p>He smiled his first genuine smile of the day as he carefully laid the needle onto the vinyl. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The return of the Thin White Duke </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Throwing darts in lovers' eyes </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff </em>
</p><p>
  <em> From where dreams are woven </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Here am I, flashing no color </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Tall in this room overlooking the ocean </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth </em>
</p><p>
  <em> There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stays </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The record had been an early birthday present from his mother previously in the year, right after the album was released. Most of his records were actually gifts from one of his parents, only a few he bought himself seeming he didn’t really have much pocket money other than the small allowance his parents could afford to give him. He pulled out his stationary set as he hummed along to the song, laying out his favourite paper and pen, turning the music down to a low murmur and began writing-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> ‘Dear Ma and Pa, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I’ve only been back for a week but it already feels like ages. I really do wish I was back at home, dancing in the kitchen with you both to that bad contemporary music Pa likes. School is fine, it’s always only fine which is why I guess I miss you both so much. Home always seems more exciting than this place. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No new friends, since I know you’ll be asking. Maybe later in the year, we’ll see. Cough hasn’t gotten worse either. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Please give me a call sometime during free period, I’ll wait in the front office. I really do miss you both. I don’t care if I’m acting like a little kid. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Love- </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Remus </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> P.S. You know those boys I tell you about? They got fireworks somehow- they ended up being duds, so nothing got burnt down thankfully but they have weeks of detentions now though. Just thought you'd find that funny.’ </em>
