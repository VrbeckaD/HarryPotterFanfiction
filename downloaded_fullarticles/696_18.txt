    <p>“Can one of you please explain why the Christmas Tree is melted?” You groaned, rubbing your temples as you looked at the two men standing in front of you.</p><p>“Love...”</p><p>“Dear one..”</p><p>Both men began to speak at the same time and then glared at each other once they realised what had happened.</p><p>Ares growled low in his throat and shot Remus an angry look before trying again, “Dear one, it went something like this….”</p><p>*Flashback*</p><p>“I don’t see why we must do this.” Ares muttered as Remus hauled the Christmas Tree into the lounge room.</p><p>Exasperated, Remus turned to face him, “We’ve discussed this.  We are doing this because (Name) and I celebrate Christmas.  We agreed to have a Winter Solstice festival for you and we’re doing this because it would be a nice thing to do for (Name).  She’s been busy and hasn’t had the time to put up the Christmas Tree – I know it’s been bothering her.”</p><p>Ares refused to say or do anything in response as Remus decorated the tree.  The silence suited Remus rather well and then he attempted to put the Angel on top of the tree only to find it just out of his reach.  He was just about to Summon it to him when it zoomed into Ares’ outstretched hand instead.</p><p>Ares leant on his cane as he stood up, “I believe it’s my turn to put the Angel on the top of the Christmas Tree.”</p><p>Remus was somewhat used to Ares and his moods and usually, he would have let that go.  However, the full moon had been two days ago and not only was Moony still close to the surface, Ares had complained the entire time about the amount of attention you’d given Remus.</p><p>“Finally getting into the Christmas Spirit are we?” Remus snarked as he crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>“It was your turn last year.” Ares replied, moving to put the Angel on the tree.</p><p>“And yet, if memory serves correctly, you complained about it then too.” Remus remarked dryly as he Summoned the Angel into his hand causing Ares to summon it back to his hand, “So much so that (Name) settled the argument by putting the star on the top of the tree herself.  You know, for a God, you complain a lot.  You really don’t like it when other people get attention, do you?”</p><p>“Careful wolf,” Ares hissed, proving Remus right and causing Remus to tense, “I was present when my Father punished Lycaon for his impudence.”</p><p>“Thank you so much for that; we both know how well that turned out.” Remus hissed in the same tone and Ares tipped his head mockingly, “It’s ironic that you talk of his impudence when you were accused of being exactly the same, if not worse.”</p><p>“The laws of men do not apply to the Gods!” Ares snarled, creating a fireball in his hand.</p><p>Remus imitated him by creating a fireball of his own, “So that’s why it was okay to kill your Father?  Seeing as the laws of men don’t apply to you?”</p><p>“Like Father, like son. After all, Zeus killed his Father who had killed his Father.”  </p><p>“You were left a wonderful legacy.” Remus scoffed sarcastically.</p><p>Ares gritted his teeth, “I’m not the only one whose Father left a legacy that impacted my life.  Let’s see how much your wolf nature protects you now.” With that, Ares threw his fireball.</p><p>Remus moved out of the way and threw his fireball at Ares’ cane which melted on impact.</p><p>An angry roar was the only warning Remus had and he dived away the Christmas Tree to avoid the incoming fireball.  Remus began firing off spells as fast as he could and he also fired off as many combinations of spells as he could.  Ares countered them without breaking a sweat and even enhanced the spells before sending them back at Remus.</p><p>The smell of something burning caused the two men to stop fighting and turn around to face the melted remains of the Christmas Tree.  They shared a nervous look just as you entered.</p><p>*End flashback*</p><p>“Then you saw the Tree.” Ares finished.</p><p>Your eyes were transfixed on the melted remains of the Christmas Tree and without looking at either of the men, you turned and walked away up to the bedroom.  Ares and Remus could hear you muttering about purchasing a smaller Christmas Tree, placing it on top of the fireplace and decorating it yourself.</p><p>From the melted remains of the Christmas Tree, Remus wordlessly created a cane for Ares to replace the one he’d incinerated.  Without looking back, Remus followed you up.</p><p>Ares leant his weight on the cane as he too walked up to the bedroom and when he paused at the doorway, he saw you cuddled up to Remus on the bed.  Ignoring the sudden flashes of anger and jealousy, Ares placed his cane by the bedside table and laid down on the bed facing your back.  Gently and wary of his own enhanced strength, he traced your spine with his finger, “Perhaps it would have been better if my family had created counselling instead of drama.”</p><p>You leant back into him and Ares took that to mean you accepted his version of an apology.  He met Remus’ eyes over your head and nodded slightly.  They both had to fix this for you.</p><p>The next day when you came home, there was a new, beautifully decorated Christmas Tree in the lounge room.</p><p>*Extended ending*</p><p>You sat in between Ares and Remus with your head resting on Ares’ shoulder and Remus’ arm around your waist.  You were enjoying the quiet until it was broken by Remus who narrowed his eyes at the Christmas Tree, “Why are there miniature balls of fire around the tree instead of lights?”</p><p>You felt Ares shrug, “You got to put the Angel up on the tree.”</p><p>“The Angel doesn’t burn what it touches.  Miniature fire balls do.”</p><p>“Have they burnt the tree yet?  No.  Will they burn the tree? No.  I fail to see what your problem is; it’s not like I put bolts of lightning on the tree.” Ares defended. </p><p>“Speaking of putting things, I know for a fact that I put mistletoe over our bedroom doorway.  Just something to think about.” You said as you stretched and moved out of the lounge room.</p><p>Remus was up in a flash, “I guess being a werewolf does have some advantages.”</p><p>Ares was up just as quickly, “Not as many advantages as being a God has.”</p>
