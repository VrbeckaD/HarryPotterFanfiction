    <p>
  <span>The great hall was buzzing, it was evening and everyone was enjoying the feast when suddenly the lights began to flicker, there was a rumbling sound and the tables vibrated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The professors were the first one’s out of their seats, wands at the ready for any attack as the students panicked and looked around to see what was causing all this to happen… then suddenly there was a bright light, a loud thud, then it all stopped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>everyone watched in shock of what laid before them… two boys.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“AL! I TOLD YOU WE CAN'T KEEP MESSING WITH EVERYTHING WE FIND!” yelled the blond one frantically to the other as he untangled himself from him “well we didn’t die did we?’’ the other raven head remarked while rubbing his head from the fall “no but i'm pretty sure…” they watched as the blond looked up and became silent… he looked in complete shock. The other boy on the other hand wasn’t paying attention “pretty sure...and?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mom?’’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As soon as he heard those words he looked up to find they were in the great hall full of students… only they were on break and it seemed to be full… he turned his head to see what silenced his friend and his eyes grew… there she was, Astoria Greengrass… Scorps mother.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He and everyone watched as the blond began to stand up shakily… Albus got up just in time to catch his friend from stumbling over… “mom… it's me… is, is it really you?” he walked over to a shocked girl, yes she looked like his mother, but she also seemed to be around their age.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I’m sorry, I don’t know who you are…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mom” his voice began to crack and eyes began to redden, “it me…” Al could feel his friend shaking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then suddenly an unfamiliar voice spoke “I don’t mean to break up this supposed reunion… but i must ask for the sake of the professors, students and myself, who might you children be?’’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At this both boys (scorps hessiently) turned to see an old man with a long beard and robes sitting in the headmaster’s seat…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It couldn’t be…. </span>
  </em>
  <span>They thought, but it was, </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus Dumbldor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well” Albus began, pieces start to fit together “you might not believe this, but we’re from the future” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“LIES” snarled a fully black dressed man with a hook nose.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now Severus please…” Albus began “their obvious liars, children, Time traveling? unheard of!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From afar two Gyfindors looked at each other, Harry and Hermione knew about time turners, but they've never seen these children before, the time turner cant take someone so far back… can it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now Severus, how can you tell these boys are lying? And for Merlin’s sake lower your wand, their children!” Mcgonagle bellowed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine… under one conditution, let us check if they're telling the truth” he slightly lowered his wand with irritation in his voice “do you mean?” “yes.” the lady looked at Dumbledore who only shook his head and motioned to allow it… what were they planning on doing?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No one moved  as Snape went to fetch whatever he was planning on using, everyone froze and were looking at the boys who were now standing up front facing the headmaster.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was sudden whispers…</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span> “hey, doesn't that one boy look kinda like Harry?” “I was thinking that too!” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“That blond kinda looks like Malfoy” “yeah but on the verge of tears”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I wonder why he called her mother…”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“That boy looks exactly like Harry! Minus the glasses of course…”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then suddenly Snape burst through the doors holding a vile, silencing all the whispers at once.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One,” he began as he looked down at the boys and sneered… </span>
  <em>
    <span>looks like Potter. </span>
  </em>
  <span>“...of you will have to drink this and answer any question we give you, understand? This is a truth potion, so do not attempt to fight it… you will lose.” both boys nodded, obvious fear for the man standing in front of them. “Well now, who will be the lucky boy?’’ the blond opened his mouth but the Raven head spoke first “I’ll do it” “but, Al…” “it’s alright, they’d find out sooner or later, plus you’ve experienced enough, shouldn't make you also have to sacrifice yourself” the blond opened his mouth, but only nodded with a quiet thankyou. Al sighed and grabbed the bottle, and in one motion drank it all down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” began Dumbledore, “Let us begin by asking your full name, your age, and what year you're from?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Al felt himself speak before he could think,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“ My name is Albus Severus Potter, I’m 16 and from the year 2022”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Gasps began to fill the hall, everyone was now questioning his name, and 2022?!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“SILENCE!’’ everyone silenced.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You said potter… by any chance are you related to him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, he is my father.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry, from the gryffindor table could be heard spitting out his pumpkin juice, there was some gasps and some chuckles.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who's your mom?!” one student from the hufflepuff table yelled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ginevra Weasley.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All of a sudden there was an uproar near Harry, “HARRY YOU GIT, YOU KNOCKED UP OUR SISTER?!” three red headed boys yelled at the poor victim of the events “oh sod off it didn’t happen yet!” yelled hermione, it was true… “well,” started George, “at least it’s not some stranger.” the other ginger begrudgingly nodded their head in acceptance, but Harry knew this wasn’t the end of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“WHAT’S YOUR HOUSE?!” yelled a gryffindor, another Potter for the win right?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Slytherin.” he replied in monotone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There were Gasps everywhere, even some professors, Snape was still in shock that Harry even named his kid after him… now he’s also one of his snakes… what happened in the next few years?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That can’t be right! Your a Potter!’’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure Harry’s your dad?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“SLYTHERIN?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“SHUT UP!” Al yelled furiously gaining their attention “YES I'M A POTTER IN SLYTHERIN! BUT WHO THE BLOODY HELL ARE YOU TO SAY I DON’T BELONG THERE OR THAT I’M NOT POTTER’S SON! HONESTLY I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT ALL YOU SHITS, I’M DOING THIS FOR SCORP AND SCORP ONLY, THE REST OF YOU COULD JUST SOD OFF AND GO TO BLOODY HELL!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Everyone watched in horror… this was the saviors son?....</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Al looked like he was about to say something again when the blond rushed up and covered his mouth with his hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He… um… he didn’t mean what he said right now…” the blond nervously laughed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s on a truth serum right now” yelled a student from the back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.. we-well that’s… you guys understand, He’s just, he’s Al ya’know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a silent “no” floating through the air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, now that one of you introduced themselves, how about the other, who might you be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“OH!” the blond beamed, ALbus gave an angry huff but stood back to give the other space.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My name is Scorpius Malfoy!~ and I'm 16! My parents are Astoria Greengrass and Draco Malfoy!!! Hi Mommy! Hi Daddy!!!” he beamed brighter than the sun.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a second there was just silence, then the hall eurrupted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“WHAT?! YOUR A MALFOY?!” there just loud bantering and questions, how was it possible that </span>
  <em>
    <span>Malfoy </span>
  </em>
  <span>not only had a child, but one that seemed… well nice, there had to be a catch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy just glared, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s no way that boy is my son, I mean look at him, does he not know how a Malfoy should hold themselves, all disheveled, messy hair, and whatever the hell he called me…” he began to mumble, but only loud enough for those around him to hear. Pansy snorted in laughter “yeah,” she began, “also, with that Greengrass girl? Please!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius just smiled and nervously laughed, he wasn’t a fan of this much attention and Albus noticed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“COULD ALL OF YOU SHUT THE HELL UP?! DO NOT BE TALKING CRAP ABOUT THIS CINNAMON ROLL! I’LL PERSONALLY SLIT THE THROATS OF ANYONE WHO EVEN DARES TO LOOK AT HIM ILLY!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This came with another shock, it was strange to see someone looking so much like their Potter not only threaten someone, but to do so for a Malfoy… it wasn’t a surprise when the red head of the trio decided to voice his opinion</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The BLOODY HELL you doing with a</span>
  <em>
    <span> Malfoy?” </span>
  </em>
  <span>he ended with a sneer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh look,” AL smirked “a volunteer”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius stopped Al from walking over to presumabably murder his uncle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Al! You can’t just go murdering people in the past!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why the hell not?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well for one thats your uncle!” Scorp threw his arms up in exaggeration.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Albus only humphed in response and backed down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bloody hell mate… your kids’ a bloody psycho…” Ron whispered to Harry, Hermione elbowed the ginger but Harry didn't seem to notice, he was more focused on this boy who claims he’s his son, but couldn't be any more opposite from him. He stared in suspense… what more about this boy doesn't he know?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius began to speak up again, giving another nervous smile “yeah, I kinda expected that reaction, haha…. Anyway Al isn’t usually like this” he rubbed the back of his head “ it’s just, he can get like this sometimes, we didn't have the best first years here you see… so he ended up being a bit… well a bit like this” he smiled and gestured at an armed cross, glaring Albus, “he’s actually really sweet aren't you Al?!” he beamed </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...yeah...haha” Scorpius felt his soul leave his body a bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone just continued to watch in disbelief, there's no way this was true… It couldn't be… It must be a Weasley twins prank… yeah.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well hasn’t this become interesting” Dumbeldore began, clapping his hands together, twinkle in his eyes. “But, it seems despite the Veritaserum not many of the students seem to believe you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” started a Hufflepuff `` plus how does a Potter and Malfoy become friends? There's no way you guys are telling the truth.'' There was a chorus of agreements, Albus seemed to be boiling again, but Scorpius placed his hand on his shoulder to calm him down, it seemed to work.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From afar two other students thought this to themselves, Harry and Draco caught eyes and glared, how can any of their heir stand the other? It seemed unnatural.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, you see it's a long story…” started Scorp</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We have time” yelled in agreement, another wave of agreement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“B-but it's kinda hard to explain, I would have to show you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well why don’t we just do that?” Dumbldore suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Everyone quieted down to this. Was that possible?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that possible?” asked scorp</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well yes, of course, but i wouldn't do so without your permissions, but it may be the best way to clear up any  misunderstanding and doubt, it will also allow us to see how you managed to travel this far back in time”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well” scorp trialed off..</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The hell?” started Al again, “what do we look like? Free entertainment?! We don't have to prove nothing to you people…” “Al,” scorp interrupted him “it may be our best chance to clear things up, and help us get home… plus” this caught Al’s attention “ I want them to know how a Potter and Malfoy can be friends” he smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“B-but scorp… I dont want you to go through….” he looked at Astoria, who just froze up, staring back in confusion “... through that again..” he lowered his voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Everyone watched as Scorp looked down shakily… what had happened to him to make him so afraid of his past? Even Draco was curious… had he turned out like his father… he felt a slight chill. “Ha” he whispered “apple doesn't fall far from the tree after all” he looked back up at the trembling boy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry” started Dumbldore “during the spell, you two will be asleep, I’ll make sure you will only have to relive the good memories, I promise” he smiled slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Al squinted his eyes, not sure if they should believe him, but scorp grabbed for his hand, nodding slightly “it wouldn't be bad to relive all our happy moments together” he smiled. Al, still skeptical just nodded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You best be telling the truth old man”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Those around who heard cringed at the disrespect toward the headmaster… this potter sure had an attitude.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, if that's that, let us begin,but, be aware students,” he turned to the students sitting in the great hall, “once we began there's no going back, we will have to see this through, whoever wishes to leave, you may do so now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No one moved, everyone was curious about the future. Harry felt himself and his friends beside him straighten up and lean forward, all eager and curious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, now that that's settled, Severus,Mcgonagle, if you may please assist me.” the two Professors made their way toward Dumbledore, both still trying to process the situation, Severus let out a sneer, he had to watch the Potter’s brats memories… though he’d be lying if he said he wasn't curious on how the brat ended up in Slytherin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The students and visitors watched as the headmaster and professors lifted up their wand and mumbled a enchantment, once Dumbledors wand became a glowing blue, sucking out all the light of the room, he lowered it to the Boys, and slowly, they leaned down, laying on each others back for support, slowly their eyes shut, and when they did, the whole great hall went black, startling all the students.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then, a bright, warm light eloped them, and suddenly they found themselves on platform 9 ¾.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
