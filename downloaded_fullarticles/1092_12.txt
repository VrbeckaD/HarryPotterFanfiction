    <p>
  <span>In reality the Department of Mysteries was far more of a shifting maze than a rationally laid out structure, more a cobbled together patchwork of brick and mortar that had (through no admitted fault of its own) achieved some rambling semblance of sentience; the space rearranging as </span>
  <em>
    <span>it</span>
  </em>
  <span> saw fit, more so than any request or intention on the Unspeakables part. Case in point; Hermione had knowingly left through the same wide door that she had seen Harry and Luna sprint through, and yet somehow she had found herself walking into another hallway somewhere else entirely without either of them in sight, their voices now coming from </span>
  <em>
    <span>behind</span>
  </em>
  <span> the door she had entered through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whole of it defied time and space, rationality and reasonability, the layering of corridors and rooms even further obfuscated when somehow (against all logic,) Bellatrix Lestrange wandered in through the same door as Hermione, even though she had seen her leave via </span>
  <em>
    <span>the completely opposite side of the Prophecy Room.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Madness. Pure, simple, unstoppable madness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sudden fight that erupted? No so much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Within a second of meeting Bellatrix’s eyes, Hermione was pushed immediately to show off her rather underdeveloped abilities; the Dark Witch choosing to duel her with just as much gusto and strength as she would have spent on someone considerably older and wiser, leaving Hermione no recourse but to draw herself into a losing battle. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kill, or be killed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>None of her movements or feints were quick enough; Bellatrix was as fast as greased lightning and as pinpoint accurate as a viper, one minute she was here, the next she was there, always at the ready to send a new hex or gaping curse at the younger witch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>None of her attacks were strong enough; Bellatrix was quick to dodge or bat away each and every stunner that was sent her way, nimble enough to dance around while pushing forward with relentless speed, a lopsided grin stretched across her face and mania dancing behind her dark eyes, cackling all the while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ground around her was rapidly running out; Bellatrix managed to control the pace and direction of their duel until they were both shoved off into a secondary room, this one filled from top to bottom with bottles and tubes, arcing lightning stretching out around the ceiling. They only had a few meters of space along either side, and with nothing at all to slow Bellatrix’s onslaught, Hermione ducked and hid behind a large glass tube whose insides were filled to the brim with crackling red vapors and innumerable sparks of hidden light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course none of this was helped by the fragility of the room, and soon enough one of Bellatrix’s spells ended up missing its intended target, the glass it impacted shattering into a million tiny shards that buffeted them both at the same time that whatever had been </span>
  <em>
    <span>inside</span>
  </em>
  <span> the tube found its way </span>
  <em>
    <span>outside.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It flew at them both, bundled them all up, shoved its way past their mouths and down their throats until the stench of copper and smoldering moss filled their senses-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually (as was expected) </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone</span>
  </em>
  <span> found the duo. In this instance the pair were found by </span>
  <em>
    <span>two</span>
  </em>
  <span> someones'; Farric Avery, his robes half singed off and desperation in his eyes, and a supremely disoriented Nymphadora Tonks, her normally iridescent hair a shade of muted chartreuse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both wormed their way in within a second or two, a temporary peace treaty agreed to by solemn eyes and a nod of their heads, wary but in agreement that their only reason for meeting was the rescue of their respective fighters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Farric knew that he could best the little Auror, he knew he would most likely best any kind of dueling spirit that she put up; but that would end up stealing away what little time remained, leaving him open and easy pickings for the other Auror’s soon to arrive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nymphadora knew that Avery could beat her, that he would likely smash any of her defenses to pieces; and if she failed Hermione in this it was likely she would be taken along as well, as a hostage or a corpse. She let it go, far too worried about getting the unconscious witch some much-needed medical attention than she was eager to strike one final (and ultimately ineffectual) blow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neither of the two noticed the swirling mist that lingered against the mouths of the unconscious witches.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neither noticed the ebb and flow of a magic far more foreign than anything they had ever dabbled in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And that made all the difference.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The world greeted Hermione through the thick film of what must have been the single worst headache she had ever experienced; the stumbling and fitful process of rejoining the living made all the more arduous by the immediate realization that yes, she would much prefer to remain dead to the world. Unfortunately the blistering pain behind her eyes wasn’t giving up without a fight, and seemed to throw itself into a frightening pain at the mere thought of being banished. Her pulse throbbed within her temple, nausea deep within her gut boiling and roiling around, her body twisting and turning as she fought to shove her face deeper into the pillow underneath her. Bits and pieces of her last memories fell into place as she lay there in the midst of pretending she was fine, laborious and annoying as she attempted to correlate what she remembered with where she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simple reasoning would say that she was either back in her bed at Hogwarts, napping at the Infirmary, or lying in her own bed at home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, she could strike two off that list.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no insistent pressure as Crooks attempted to worm his way beneath her covers towards the warmth of her body heat, nor was there any indication that her dorm-mates were up and about. Neither could she hear the soft voice of Madam Pomfrey as she made her rounds, or the bickering and jostling of either Harry or Ron by her bedside; a constant presence since her second year, she was quite certain that were she there, then they would be as well. The last nail in the coffin was the warm rays of sunshine pouring through a window at her side, the long rays heating her to a comfortable temperature in such a way as to indicate she wasn’t near Hogwarts at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No; this heat was far more likely streaming in through the massive window at her home, the bedroom was built to face the east and filled up with more than enough light to give Crooks a perfect place to nap whenever they were home. Though it </span>
  <em>
    <span>would</span>
  </em>
  <span> be unusual for her to be back at home so early after that fight, unless Dumbledore had made the decision to send her home after all was said and done. After all, they had been waiting around until the last moment to fight back against Umbridge, and Harry’s vision had managed to coincide with the night before they would leave for vacation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In its own way it made sense that Dumbledore might want to send them all home as soon as possible, likely in service to keeping any rumors or lies from spreading beyond the boundaries of the Ministry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course that now left her with an unbearable headache and nothing to fix it with; Muggle pain relievers were oh so less effective than the simple Wizarding counterpart, and so much more frustrating to use. Hermione sighed into the pillow beneath her lips as she stretched and pulled at uneven muscles that were screaming through a blanket of pain and soreness, her exhales more a moan of lingering pain than anything else. She worked on flexing her fingers, her toes, testing as much as she could within the rather constricting confines of-</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘What.’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Dark eyes flew open to stare at the rather unusual sight of a canvas stretched across a four-poster bed; the material a shifting green that seemed to sway and reflect the soft light that bounced in from the window to her left. She twitched, rolling onto her back at the same moment that she bit her lip in trepidation, hands moving ever so slowly with a shake and shiver as she pressed warm palms against her abdomen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fabric; material twisted tight and rigid across the plane of her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lace; frills and accompaniments just as excessive as a garnish on a meal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Metal; steel bones running top to bottom, a row of silver clasps running down the center</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘I’m… I’m wearing a corset. To bed.’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione tilted her head to stare down the length of her torso, headache thinning around the edges while colors blossomed into existence in a sparkling radiance that timed itself to her movements.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> wearing a corset.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dark. Black, even. And beneath it she was clad in a dress of the same color, legs free and clear beneath the wispy fabric. One foot was stuck halfway inside a boot, her other foot left bare and free to wriggle atop the bed. The strangeness was a compounding issue, each and every question that she </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> been asking were suddenly replaced with new ones that locked themselves up somewhere in the back of her mind. The headache only aggravated things, her eyes swimming as she fought to pull herself from the swirling and churning eddy currents of pain mixed in with confusion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A grunt of pained exertion and two seconds of tilting vertigo left Hermione pulling herself up, her still booted foot rolling side to side until the offending item dropped down to the floor below her, lost somewhere at the edge of the bed. Her arms strained with soreness while her eyes clamped shut, the headache building to near blinding proportions as she moved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first thought to make its way past her fogged mind was that she was most definitely hallucinating; obviously her mind was obfuscating what she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>really</span>
  </em>
  <span> seeing, wherever she truly was, and locking it all behind the thin veneer of a temporary madness. That would easily explain both corset and her garb, as well as the particular decor of this room. Pearly off-white walls, a green bed, a mahogany wardrobe that sat opposite to a matching vanity mirror and dresser. There were two doors sat into perpendicular walls; one closed and painted in white with an ornate silver serpent as a handle, the other much the same except opened to reveal a bathroom that lay beyond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Decidedly </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> her first choice in home decorating, that much was for sure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately that didn’t help her in regard to how </span>
  <em>
    <span>real</span>
  </em>
  <span> all of it felt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione could </span>
  <em>
    <span>feel</span>
  </em>
  <span> the way that the corset dug into her hip bone when she bent at an awkward angle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could </span>
  <em>
    <span>feel</span>
  </em>
  <span> the bunched up lightness of the lace draping over her legs, the coolness of the lengths that sat hiked up around her knees as well as the skirt that was itself all soft and silken.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pillows piled up behind her back, the striking comfort of the down comforter that she was laying on; she could feel each and every bit of this, she could taste the sterility of the room, she was-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The faintest sound of knocking began against the closed door, all of Hermione’s questions and confusions brought to a standstill as she waited with bated breath. Her face reshaped into a mask of incredulity when a distinctly feminine voice (one that she remembered all too well,) spoke beyond the room, “Bellatrix? Dear? Are you decent?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pulling herself up from the realm of Morpheus was a chore; not because the effort was hampered by any sort of pain or unease, no, she was reluctant to rejoin the waking world for one simple reason.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix was comfortable. Completely, and totally, at ease. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For what must have been the very first time in nearly twenty years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was nothing in the world that could pull her from the peaceful lull of a good night’s rest, all the hard work behind her and nothing left to do except-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix’s eyes opened up to a bleary world filmed with the last dredges of her good sleep, the voice bringing her a mild confusion as she waited on it to begin again. She ran a hand through her curls as much she could, languid and tired even as she questioned what she had heard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” the speaker shuffled and moved closer to her, “Hermione? You alright there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘What in the Hell is this? And who in the buggering fuck is </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>Hermione</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span>?’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The longer she thought on it, the more the name began to feel somewhat familiar; it felt as if she had most definitely heard it at some point in time (even if she had no idea of when), but as she lay there thinking the person standing by her bed took her silence as leave to begin speaking again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You gave us one helluva fright there ‘Mione, Tonks said that you were almost a goner ‘fore she got there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix wiped her eyes as she prepared to lean up and tell whoever was having their conversation to </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck the fuck off,</span>
  </em>
  <span> when the name that had passed by his lips managed to reach the logical portions of her brain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tonks.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Tonks.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>Tonks!</em>
  </b>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix’s heart began to slam against her ribcage, the sudden thought that she had been captured rooting itself in her mind-</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Dementors,’</span>
  </em>
  <span> most likely guarding all the doors, </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘They’ll send me back to Azkaban!’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>A bright flash of light sparked its way into existence within the center of her mind; twin points of green and red commingling and growing from a faint shadow to a blinding flash that moved forward to eat away at everything within her. She could feel strong arms wrap themselves around her shoulders, two bodies managing to just barely haul her back down onto the mattress, whispering (or perhaps shouting, she couldn’t rightly say which it was,) </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span> into her ears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t tell, couldn’t know, the light overpowering her sudden headache into a pain the likes of which she had never once encountered.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘I’m Bellatrix-</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘I’m Hermione-’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bellatrix? Bellatrix please, I know you’re in there. Let me in, please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘How did I end up here? </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>Why</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span> am I here? </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>Why in the name of bloody fucking Merlin is Ms. Malfoy at the door?!</em>
  </b>
  <span>’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione stood on wobbling feet, her balance all off and body listing to the side as she made her way towards the vanity mirror, and her first chance at seeing herself since battling the madwoman the night prior. Or had it been more than a night? The thought struck oddly at her sense of time and space, not helped along at all by sudden feeling of </span>
  <em>
    <span>wrongness</span>
  </em>
  <span> accompanying her movements. She had her suspicions on what had happened, had worries and fears for sure, but a quick glance at the mirror would sort it all out-</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘No…’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s rage and sorrow filled a scream that rolled throughout the Manor; the tone and tenor so offkey that Narcissa had no recourse but to smash the door inwards with a sudden </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bombarda,</span>
  </em>
  <span> not even waiting to wonder </span>
  <em>
    <span>why</span>
  </em>
  <span> she had screamed. Her arrival couldn’t have been more fortuitous however, entering the room with wand out and blue eyes wide at just the right moment to catch Hermione as she fell backwards into unconsciousness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the attack, or seizure, or whatever the bloody blue blazes was happening to her began to stop and recede back into the depths from which it came, Bellatrix could do no more than lay backwards into the cot and sigh. Her body had been strapped down against the bedframe with thick loops of white cotton braid that brought her more memories of good times spent in her bedroom with various daughters of the political hierarchy than something that Auror’s would use, more reminiscent of a make due control rather than cautious safekeeping. Her ankles and wrists chafed at the material where it held her down and pulled her tight, the hold just limp enough to allow her uninterrupted blood flow without compromising her inability to move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But she could still see, she could still hear, and within only a few moments she ceased her efforts and started to profusely (if vaguely) apologize to whoever was in the room beside her, no matter the lack of any real sincerity.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She wasn’t herself.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew that now; knew it as the truth from the moment she stopped to think on why they had been uttering </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> name, and only saw it confirmed by the view of bronzed skin stretched over a weak musculature that left her panting in exertion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She </span>
  <em>
    <span>was </span>
  </em>
  <span>Bellatrix Lestrange; scion of the Black Family, Right Hand to the Dark Lord, Brightest Witch of the Age.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And </span>
  <em>
    <span>now</span>
  </em>
  <span> she was Hermione Granger; a Mudblood, a child, usurper to one of her titles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was also the brain that powered The Boy, her Lord’s Ire; One Third of a Trio, and ingratiated beyond reproach to their little group.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘... I can make this work,’</span>
  </em>
  <span> she mused in the safety of her mind, toiling almost instantly at plans and options, </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘I can make this useful…’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It was more a wonder than a certainty that led her to blanketing her mind with Occlumancy, a surprised hum burbling from her throat as she felt her shields fall thick around her Inner Self; all in the nick of time as well when the Old Goat fell into her vision, his appearance marked by a stunningly impertinent probe as he tried to look inside her mind. He was buffeted, pushed away, cut off from any point of access and left scrabbling against her walls as she drowned his attempts in the seas that ringed her Fortress, an ugly smirk turning up one corner of his lips in a flash that was quickly settled back into the mask of Grandfatherly kindness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix knew she needed a plan, she knew she needed one fast; there was absolutely no way that she could proclaim herself to be the Mudblood, no way that she could trick them all into thinking that she was fine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That, unfortunately, left her only one option.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix sucked in a lungful of air as she lifted her head and looked around as much as her bonds would allow her, “Not that I don’t appreciate all the help, but… Who exactly are you lot?” That shut the whole lot of them up right quick; six pairs of eyes all turning to scrutinize her with so much force that Bellatrix couldn’t hold back the cold shiver that wormed its way down her spine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The redhead coughed, face a pained grin, “What’re you talkin’ about ‘Mione?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘The Weasel,’</span>
  </em>
  <span> Bellatrix noted, her eyes burning holes as she stared back into his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, now, let’s all not crowd the poor girl. Off you lot go, I’ll call you back in a minute or two.” The woman who spoke pushed the group before her bed off to the side, her eyes and words brokering no argument or diversion. The woman was tall and matronly; all gussied up in a nurses uniform but wizened beyond the point of being anything other than an aged crone. Soon enough the Old Goat, Minerva, and the Crone remained, each of them once again staring at her with pointed eyes and downturned lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Old Goat seemed to shuffle in the unease before smiling down at her, “Now Ms. Granger, could you please tell us what you </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> remember?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Is this a test? Or does he buy it?’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes, well,” Bellatrix’s voice fumbled to a stop as she really </span>
  <em>
    <span>listened</span>
  </em>
  <span> to herself for the first time. </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Do I- does </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>she</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span> really sound like that? Gods, I’m so young!’</span>
  </em>
  <span> She mouthed silent pleas before continuing, “Well I know where I am, Hogwarts Infirmary. I know that you’re Albus Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall- I, I’m sorry to say that I don’t recognize you Ma’am,” she inclined her head at the old woman, “Though I have to admit you seem familiar.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Crone smiled, eyes shifting nervously back towards the Goat, “Well my name is Madam Pomfrey, I run the Infirmary and I’ll be at your service should you need it. Anything else?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know who I am, besides my name at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The clustered group of staff members all turned to look at one another after she said that, her heart rate rising slightly as she took it all in.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘They believe it!’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione was having one hell of a very bad day; her looks, and the accompanying feelings, all proved it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione had almost immediately been levitated to a neutral weight after falling backwards into unconsciousness (and Mrs. Malfoy’s surprisingly strong grip), body lifted up to float beside the witch as she was maneuvered into a settee amid one of many sitting rooms; her body resting and recovering as her mind slowly filtered back up to itself.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘I’m Bellatrix-’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Somehow, someway, she had found herself residing in the body of a Dark Witch. Polyjuice? Perhaps, but unlikely. The effects of the potion weren’t meant to be long-lasting, and she failed to think of a single moment during which she could have been dosed. Unless it happened after she was rendered unconscious during the fight? But why? What advantage or purpose would that serve?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Transfiguration? Once again, unlikely at best; if she had been the target of strange magics that twisted and formed her to match the Dark Witch, if she had been purposefully changed to match the woman then there would have been quite serious drawbacks beyond the headache and general soreness. And to top that off she would have still had access to </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> magic, not this horrid miasma of darkness that swirled beneath her veins. The grasping heat of it pulled her backwards into languid introspection despite her precarious position on the settee, heartbeat pounding and spiking until it was fast approaching a trot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, surely this was a darker magic, something stranger and more unknown. It still made little sense for exactly </span>
  <em>
    <span>why</span>
  </em>
  <span> she would find herself here; the only reason she could make out was that she must have become Bellatrix’s doppelganger at some point before the fight at the Ministry was over. Surely her own friends wouldn’t have abandoned </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> while she was there, and she could see no reason at all for why the notorious Death Eaters would bring her along.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And all that ended up bringing her to another question, one that she lacked any real ability to determine.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Where the Hell was Bellatrix Lestrange?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately the chance to solve that particular riddle was interrupted by the pragmatic reality of </span>
  <em>
    <span>keeping her fucking mouth shut,</span>
  </em>
  <span> as Mrs. Malfoy returned to asking questions at random intervals, all of which she could only stare through with half closed eyes and an open mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Until </span>
  <em>
    <span>He</span>
  </em>
  <span> walked in.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Voldemort. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Tom Riddle. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione stared at him with and open mouth and opened mind, unable to keep herself stuck to the role she had been assigned. His red eyes were narrowed, head tilted, a hand shoving forward through her mind to stick and muck about the middle of her thoughts, another in the long line of pains that she found herself inundated with. There was no hope of saving her memories, no hope of hiding it all away; she knew of Occlumency and had been working on practicing the skill but this was no mere feint by an untrained Legillimens, and thus she had no hope of stopping it. Certainly she wouldn’t be successful at this, not untested and untrained as she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ms. Granger,” he hissed out in a tone that leaned more towards amusement than displeasure, “What a pleasant surprise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Bellatrix sat down, thought about it, and was honest with herself, she had expected… </span>
  <em>
    <span>More. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Or she had at least expected something more than </span>
  <em>
    <span>nothing</span>
  </em>
  <span> from the so oft esteemed Light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no Veritaserum.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were no overt requests to scan her with Legilimency.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even the Old Goat had immediately backed off once he had run into her barriers; either shame or reluctant admiration for her skills now keeping him in check, no further attempts or snide remarks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course that wasn’t to say that there wasn’t at least </span>
  <em>

  <span> unlocking many of her memories from the time before she had served the Dark Lord, and a multitude of endless agony that had been lost to Azkaban.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course Pomfrey remained confused at the situation, Severus as well once they roped him into the room, but with no clear avenue to make a clean escape she was stuck with propping up this ridiculous charade. An attempt on the Boy’s life was a tempting prospect, but he belonged to her Lord after all. A quick Avada might have solved all their issues but he was the Dark Lord’s prize, not hers, and so she was left with nothing else to do but sit there and respond to their questions with the same answers said in a multitude of different ways.</span>

  <span> an improvement borne on mangled Latin, focused so that it only fractured the mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione had a front row seat to witness just how much Voldemort liked both spells, just how intensely he craved the absolute domination of another’s mind and will. He twisted, sneered, forced wicked thoughts and images down into her mind at a rate and volume that left Hermione a panting mess, broken through and through with splayed limbs and shallow breaths. It was Hell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But oh had he seen things, things only Merlin would dream of; a depth and breadth to Magic that he forced inside her cranium with all the grace and gentleness of a jackhammer that left her feeling fit to burst with it all.</span>

  <span>Hermione broke. Fell to shards, a twisted remnant of who she had once been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Upon the marbled floor of the Manor, with her head cradled in Narcissa’s lap, Voldemort standing tall above her, Hermione Granger shattered into a spiderweb of pain and mental anguish.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are you?” he asked, his voice sibilant and soothing, Narcissa’s hand on her head rubbing calming motions to her screaming mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” she replied, all honesty and truth, “I don’t know.”</span>
