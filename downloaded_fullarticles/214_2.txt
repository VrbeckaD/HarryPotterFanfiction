    <p>He looked outside the window. The park, that was his front yard, laid empty before his eyes. Sometimes he wondered if he should order the house elves to plant something here, apart from the plain grass and neatly cut hedges. Then again, he was never a friend of roses. He didn’t spend much time in his gardens, but whenever he was there, he didn’t want to ruin his clothes, ripping them through thorns. Never mind that grand elaborate gardens were not just expensive but also meant a lot of work.</p><p>The house-elves would only use it as an excuse to work less in the house. They already complained, that there was too much work. Not to him of course – never to him, but whenever he wasn’t around or when they thought he didn’t listen, they started mouthing off about the working pressure. He didn’t want to hand them one more excuse to do even less in the house.</p><p>Thus, added to the new flowers, he’d also have to buy a new house-elf – and those were hard to come by these days – or he’d have to employ a gardener… who on the other hand he’d have to pay. In the long run, a house-elf would be cheaper. And more capable! At least they hadn’t had the idea to ask for insurances and structure themselves into unions to demand better treatment or more money, just for doing the work they were hired to do in the first place. If he had bad luck a human employee would even demand to get a doxy-bite-vaccination paid. And if Lucius didn’t want to follow these safety precautions, he was sure one Arthur Weasley would gladly use that pathetic pretense, to issue one of his obnoxious house searches. No, no, he’d rather stick to house-elves where the ministry did not have a great catalog of rules and regulations on how to treat them</p><p>Again, he glanced through the window. Anyway, rosebushes – and in general just about any fair flowery plant – were not the right thing for him. He didn’t have anything against that briary, but any halfway capable – or wealthy – Muggle could put some greenery into their gardens. He was a Malfoy and his gardens had to represent that.</p><p>A few years ago, he had entertained the idea of keeping swans in the lake behind the manor. When he was still young, every now and then wild geese had settled there for a season before moving on. Pesky migrating birds. It hardly helped to shush them away, they’d return the next year, anyway! Swans, he had thought, would maybe dampen the mood for those ugly ducks. It had never evolved into more than just a vague idea. He had never done it. Mostly because swans were quite aggressive when you closed in on them during the wrong time of the year – and Lucius preferred to have access to his lake all year round. He didn’t swim, but he liked to sit at the shore – not least of all because that was where he had asked Narcissa to marry him. This was a part of his gardens that he didn’t want to share with swimming poultry, no matter how beautiful it was.</p><p>Still, the swans had inspired another idea. Peacocks. Peacocks, those were truly magnificent creatures. When he was a child and less intimidating than he was now, his classmates had sometimes called him a “strutting peacock” and they had probably thought he should take it as an insult. Maybe they had never seen a peacock before. Why would anybody feel insulted for being compared to those most wonderous of all birds? There was nothing insulting there. Peacocks where beautiful animals – he had never heard anybody proclaim otherwise. He liked peacocks. They were like him.</p><p>And surely, he was not just an ordinary peacock. He was a pureblood, thus only the purest peacock should live in his gardens. On the spur of the moment and without a second thought he took out his quill and a scroll of parchment.</p><p>Three days later the majestic bird arrived at the manor. White was his gown. Bright Silver like the hair on a Malfoy’s head. A magnificent animal. Purity was a beauty. A bird made for the Malfoy patriarch, the seller proclaimed. And he was right of course. Mephistopheles was his name, but Lucius could change it anytime if he wanted to, he was told. The Malfoy had only smirked and kept the name. The name of the devil. A bit of self-irony was never a bad thing. It would remain a secret between himself and the bird, after all.</p>
