</p><p>"What the fuck? Come again." Harry mutters, her eyes wide in astonishment. There is certainly something wrong with this man. One day he is trying to take her clothes off. The very next day, he is trying to hurt her and today he is asking her to- "You want me to marry you. Are you nuts?"</p><p>"No. No. I said that I want you to fake marriage with me. You have to live in the Manor with me as my wife after our fake wedding." He says and she stares at him. She can not understand this man at all.</p><p>"Why will I do that? Are you drunk Malfoy?" She asks him and waits for his response. All right, she thinks that he is a bit cute with his honest eyes, and quite handsome with his broad shoulders, muscled abs and lean yet strong thighs but he is a real asshole. His dressing sense has improved since Hogwarts. Mostly, he is seen in muggle clothes now. That doesn't change the fact that he is tripped her yesterday.</p><p>"No, look... it's really very important."</p><p>"Harry. Harry." Mom calls me and Harry replies, "Mum, I am talking to someone."</p><p>"Come here at once Harry." Mum yells at her and she yells right back, "Don't disturb me. I am busy with my brewing and apothecary. I am already running low on many potions."</p><p>Malfoy just stares at her. She snaps her fingers in front of his eyes and mutters impatiently, "I have to get back to my lab, Malfoy. As you can see, I am out of potions and I have no time to brew."</p><p>"You are a potions mistress." The words are spoken in a desperate voice. She stares, trying to understand him. A few seconds ago, he wanted her to marry him.</p><p>"Your parents... they didn't want you to work for the ministry or something." He asks and looks almost curious. But she had always been able to see through him. He really wants to know, "I heard that your father was an auror and that now he is teaching defense. Doesn't he want you play Quidditch or become an auror. There have been no potions masters or mistresses in your family or forefathers."</p><p>She answers carefully and slowly, as if explaining it to a child, "Malfoy. You don't understand. I really don't have time for this. I am already running out of time. I am tired and I have to meet Ron and Hermione in about three hours. That leaves me with just enough time to brew four batches of just one potion. To answer your question, they were against it and are still against it. They don't help me at all but I handle it myself. Will you fucking leave me alone." Currently, she is standing in her apothecary. The shop is not very large and she has employed a girl temporarily. She can't really afford it yet but she can't brew and sell at the same time.</p><p>He is wasting her precious time.</p><p>"But, I really need you to marry me. It doesn't have to be real. It will be fake and I will not touch you at all. Please, just say yes." He presses, his eyes desperate. She stares again. Talk about not touching her. He is always trying to take her clothes off, whether it is in a club or in an empty alley where they happen to cross paths.</p><p>"I will not hurt you. I just need you to do it for me. Please Potter." He pleads her and she stares incredulously at him. Just yesterday, he tripped her in the middle of the street. Everyone was laughing at her and her knees had started bleeding. Bloody asshole. He had said that he hates her.</p><p>She doesn't get it.</p><p>"Potter." He presses and she sighs impatiently, "Look... meet me at 'The house rocks' at about nine, all right. We will talk then."</p><p>His face lits up as if Christmas has come early as he mutters, "Thank you."</p><p>There is a smile on his face as he leaves the apothecary.</p><p>Shaw, her temporary receptionist turns towards her and mutters, "Miss potter, I think you must return to your brewing. We are loosing customers."</p><p>Harry huffs in annoyance and storms towards her lab.</p><p>"HARRY." Mom screams and Harry screams right back, " DON'T DISTURB ME. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP THEN AT LEAST STAY OUT OF MY HAIR. I AM BUSY."</p><p>Mom doesn't reply and Harry slams the door behind her before taking a couple of breaths to calm herself down. She really really needs help. This way, she will loose all her customers.</p><p>XXXX</p><p>Draco stares longingly at her apothecary wishing that he had one too. But father doesn't want him to open it. He wants Draco to work for the ministry, to gain contacts and to help him with his business. He is always trying to live Draco's life for him. He doesn't leave Draco alone for even two minutes. Thank Merlin, Draco had gained his potions mastery in secret. Otherwise, father would have wrung his neck.</p><p>Marrying Potter can help him out of it. Potter is not like Draco. She is bold and he knows that things will be better if he is at the manor. At the top of it, she is a potions mistress.</p><p>Draco hates his father. He walks towards the apparition point but thens starts feeling dizzy so he has to stop and lean against the wall before closing his eyes, knowing that he will not open eyes as himself.</p><p>XXXX</p><p>Draco opens his eyes and stares ahead, smirking to himself. So finally his stupid, coward of an alter has convinced Harry to meet him in private.</p><p>Thank merlin he is good at something at-least. He could turn back and go back to flirt with Harry but the woman is really busy and will just throw him out so there is no point. So he wanders aimlessly in the streets, knowing that father will punish him if he is late. How does it really matter. He will not be the one getting hurt. It will be their third alter and he is made of really hard stuff. He smiles to himself and hums while walking leisurely, his hands in his pockets.</p><p>XXXX</p><p>Please review</p>
