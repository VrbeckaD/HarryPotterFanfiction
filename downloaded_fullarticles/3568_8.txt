          <div class="userstuff"><p>Severus stopped when he heard Harry.</p>
<p>"I dunno Draco."</p>
<p>"Just hold it Harry."</p>
<p>"Yours is bigger than mine."</p>
<p>Severus heard a rustle of clothing before,</p>
<p>"Look at size of mine. Don't touch it!"</p>
<p>"Relax Potter, I know it's for yours and Severus' hands only."</p>
<p>Severus growled.</p>
<p>"You can let go now Potter, I need this for later."</p>
<p>"You do? "</p>
<p>"Oh yes, how much pleasure this brings me and others."</p>
<p>Severus blasted the door open and sent Draco crashing to the floor. "Mine!"</p>
<p>"Severus!"</p>
<p>Severus turned to see Harry holding two wands.</p>
<p>"I bet I know what you thought." Draco smirked.</p></div>
