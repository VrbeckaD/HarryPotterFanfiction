I have to go, I’m watching star wars and my best friend is getting mad that I’m on my phone.</em><br/> <em>8:08pm: I hope your night improves.</em><br/> <b>8:10pm: Thanks, Teddy with blue hair from London.<br/> </b> <em>8:11pm: no worries, male blob wearing a Chelsea jersey and a smug grin who is probably out for a run in London or doing something else gross right now.</em><br/> <b>8:12pm: I’m rolling my eyes at you.</b></p><p>
