</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s flat was in utter shambles; Hermione had come by in the middle of her work day to help him restore order.</p><p>Some time last night while he had been out having a pint with Ron and Dean Thomas, somebody had come into his London apartment and trashed the place. </p><p>Not just <em>somebody</em>, though — it had been Emily, the cute little blonde-haired witch he’d been dating a year now, who had turned out to be not so much cute and little as she was needy and suffocating. This disaster was the proof, if he’d needed it.</p><p>With a wave of his wand, Harry repaired an electric lamp that had smashed into a million pieces across his hardwood floor, sending it flying back into place on an end table. The leather sofa beside it had been slashed to ribbons, as well — the stuffing had been <em>everywhere </em>— but Hermione had already taken care of that one, and an hour later it looked good as new.</p><p>“I suppose this means we’re not dating anymore, does it?” said Harry, lifting an eyebrow as he surveyed the flat, trying to spot anything they’d missed. Hermione finished straightening the clock that sat on top of his mantel and then turned to look at him.</p><p>“That seems like a safe bet considering the 'WE'RE OVER' in red lipstick on your bathroom mirror,” she agreed sardonically, looking exasperated. “What <em>happened</em>? Just a fortnight ago Emily was telling me she thought you might be thinking of proposing. How do you get from <em>that</em> to <em>this</em>? I mean, my <em>good</em>ness, Harry.”</p><p>“Proposing?” he echoed, latching onto the word and ignoring the rest of Hermione’s question. “She said she thought I’d be <em>proposing</em>?”</p><p>“Well, yes.” Hermione took a seat on the newly-repaired sofa, brushing some hair out of her eyes and fixing Harry with a probing stare. “You’ve been together a year and a half now, she seemed to think that was the direction it was heading. I did, mind you, bring up the fact that you continue to refuse to move in with her, which hardly bodes well for a marriage, but you know Emily.”</p><p>“Selective hearing,” said Harry dourly. He felt his irritation mounting. “Well, bollocks to her, then. Crazy wench.”</p><p>“Harry!” </p><p>“Sorry,” he mumbled, though he <em>wasn’t</em>. He was confused, yes. Monumentally pissed off, absolutely. But sorry? Not even a little bit. “Good to be rid of her, to tell you the truth. Couldn’t bloody stand it having her here every time I came home from practice. Didn’t even let me take a bath without bringing me a sodding tray of tea and biscuits. Like I can be arsed to eat biscuits when I’m trying to have a fucking soak.”</p><p>Hermione, to his surprise, had started chuckling.</p><p>“It’s not a bloody joke, Hermione! <em>You</em> try having a relaxing bath with soggy bits of food floating around the bubbles.”</p><p>“Why hadn’t you broken <em>up </em>with her, then?” </p><p>Realizing he didn’t have much of an answer, Harry merely shrugged. </p><p>“So, then, what <em>was</em> it?" she scoffed. "What could you possibly have done to provoke the bedlam we just spent an hour cleaning up?” </p><p>“It wasn’t just one thing,” he said, rolling his eyes as he sat down beside Hermione. She lifted an eyebrow. “She’s been cross with me all week. Last Saturday night it started, because of that Ministry event. The fundraiser one, can’t remember what it was for.”</p><p>“The one you didn’t show up to,” Hermione said dryly.</p><p>“She went off on me like you wouldn’t bloody believe when I told her I wasn’t going,” he went on, ignoring Hermione’s tone entirely. “Should’ve heard the things she was saying. Told me that I haven’t got my priorities straight and I ought to start living up to my name.” </p><p>A hand flew up to Hermione’s mouth, suppressing what was clearly laughter. Harry didn’t bother hiding his own grin. </p><p>“It was really something, I’ll tell you that much. I guess what finally did it, though, was, er — well, I may have forgotten we’d had a date the other night and gone out with the team after practice. It wasn’t on <em>purpose </em>or anything, though!” he said quickly. “Not like I deliberately blew her off.” </p><p>“<em>Harry</em>,” Hermione deadpanned, reminding him forcefully of their years at Hogwarts together. He might have blown off a Transfiguration essay for all the reproach that was soaked into her voice. “While I don’t condone this tantrum she’s thrown, I really do think you owe her an apology. That was incredibly insensitive.”</p><p>“I know —”</p><p>“And if you were so fed up with her, you should have just broken <em>up </em>with her —”</p><p>“I <em>know</em>, Hermione —”</p><p>“I mean, really, Harry, there’s just no point, you’re making yourself as miserable as you’re making her —” </p><p>“I <em>know</em>, Hermione!” he barked, exasperated.</p><p>“Well, why didn’t you do it, then!” she retorted immediately, looking beady-eyed and disapproving. Any trace of humour had drained from her countenance. “You could have saved us the trouble of repairing your entire flat this afternoon!” </p><p>“I dunno, do I?” he said irritably, standing up from the sofa and dragging a hand through his wildly messy hair. This was a lie, though — he did sort of know why, he just wasn’t keen on discussing his aversion to engaging in any sort of serious conversation. “I didn’t want to deal with it, I suppose. I’d bet you a hundred Galleons she’d have done the same thing if I’d broken up with her, anyway, she’s barking. At least this way it saves me a row.”</p><p>Hermione made a throaty noise of disbelief. “What, you think you’re just never going to <em>talk</em> to her again? Harry, you still have to properly end it!” </p><p>“You’re joking, right?” Her face made it very clear she was not. Harry scoffed. “This is what she did to my <em>house</em>, Hermione. Imagine what she’ll do to <em>me</em>.”</p><p>“You know, Harry, you <em>are </em>being a bit immature about this —”</p><p>“Oh, not you too,” Harry snapped, mood plummeting the instant the word ‘immature’ had left her mouth. His temper was not easy to stoke these days, quite the opposite of the way he’d been before the war — although Harry supposed that might have had something to do with the fact that, in the last few years, he’d stopped taking anything all that seriously. “Like the <em>Prophet </em>isn’t bad enough.” </p><p>“I’m just talking about your <em>relationship</em>, Harry,” Hermione said sharply. She stood up now too, and there was a stern look on her face like she’d moved past exasperation and on to genuine annoyance. “But, you know, if you want my honest opinion, I <em>do </em>think you’ve been acting incredibly immature these last couple years, and it’s only been getting worse.”</p><p>“Funny, I don’t remember asking your honest opinion,” he sniped, but Hermione, apparently, had had enough.</p><p>“I knew something like this was going to happen,” she snapped, gesturing around the flat which had only an hour ago looked like a nuclear test site. “It was bound to, eventually, the way you’ve been acting! Like a — a —” </p><p>“Go ahead, say it,” Harry bit out. He knew the word she was dancing around — it had been used in conjunction with his name for months now in the media, ever since some sneaky, pathetic reporter had stalked him long enough to get a candid of him hitting a joint, and then sold it to the <em>Daily Prophet</em> for what Harry was sure had been a very large sum of gold. </p><p>“Like a teenager!” she yelled, face pink with emotion. Harry scowled. “You miss nearly every Ministry event you’re invited to, and when you <em>do </em>go, you end up completely sloshed and saying something controversial; you get caught doing <em>Muggle </em>drugs and don’t even make a statement about it, not even an <em>attempt </em>at smoothing things over; and now you’re blowing off dates with your girlfriend and driving her to <em>destroy your flat</em>! <em>Honestly</em>, Harry! I’ve been maintaining for years now that you need to go about this post-war stuff in your own way, get it out of your system, <em>whatever </em>this is, but … but this is where I draw a line! Harry James Potter … I am <em>disappointed </em>in you!”</p><p>“Great!” Harry yelled, and his unchecked emotions caused the lightbulb in the electric lamp he’d repaired to explode. Hermione jumped. “Brilliant! Only would you mind being disappointed in me somewhere else? I was looking forward to lighting up a couple joints and premeditating my next really <em>immature </em>publicity stunt!”</p><p>Hermione swelled like an angry cat. “Oh, I can’t <em>stand </em>when you get like this! It’s completely useless arguing with you!” Snatching her purse up from a chair, she marched over to the fireplace. “I have to get back to work. <em>Do not forget </em>to be at the pitch at six tonight for the first dry run. The other team will be there to see the stadium and the Israeli Head of International Wizarding Relations will be there as well to meet Kingsley. And Malfoy, since Bosley won’t be there.” </p><p>The name sent another burst of irritation flooding through Harry’s veins; in a fit of childishness that the <em>Prophet </em>would dearly have loved to know about, he grabbed a nearby candle and chucked it across the room, where its glass holder shattered against the opposite wall. Hermione rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Remind me again why <em>he’s </em>going to be there? Did Bosley and everyone else in the Department <em>die</em>, or something?”</p><p>“Bosley’s got a terrible case of dragon pox, so he’s appointed Malfoy to go in his stead. <em>Do not </em>start a fight with him, Harry, I have never been so serious in my life. So help me god, I will hex you within an inch of your <em>life</em> if you make us look bad in front of the Israelis. It’s unprecedented for the Cup to be held in the same country twice within such a short time span, and since the last one here was in —” </p><p>“Ninety-four, yes, I’m well aware of that, Hermione, thanks.”</p><p>“Then you know you need to be on your best behaviour if you expect it to be hosted here again within this <em>century</em>!”</p><p>“I’m not gonna start anything with him! Merlin’s fucking tits. I thought you had to get back to work, I’ll see you tonight.” </p><p>Hermione, lips pursed and eyes narrowed, took a handful of Floo Powder from a vase on the mantel and disappeared into the green flames. Harry looked around at the glass all over his floor and, with a deep, resentful sigh, went to clean it up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>The Cup was especially exciting this year; not only was it being held in Britain, but the English National Team was playing. Hermione, who had quickly risen to become Senior Undersecretary to the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement in their years after Hogwarts, had been deeply involved in the process of getting ready for the 424<sup>th</sup> Quidditch World Cup.</p><p>Traditionally held every four years, the Cup had been postponed in ’98 due to the British Ministry’s need for recovery following the end of the war. Spain had been the winners of the last Cup in 1999, and with Britain in place now to nab the 2003 trophy, Harry had been feeling the pressure from all sides, particularly Fancourt — the Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports — who never missed a chance to let Harry know he’d be counting on him in August.</p><p>And now it <em>was </em>August, the Cup was a week away, and the only thing spoiling what should have been the best week of Harry’s life was Draco sodding Malfoy.</p><p>After finishing a makeup year at Hogwarts and graduating with only one less N.E.W.T. than Hermione, Malfoy had, in spite of his déclassé name (and because of his excellent marks), managed an entry-level job at the Ministry in the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Within four years, he’d risen far enough that he’d become a prominent figure in the Department, and had apparently been hand-chosen by the Department Head — Cadmus Bosley — to represent him tonight when his Israeli counterpart came in.</p><p>The stadium was in exactly the same place as it had been when Harry had gone to see the World Cup at fourteen. Only a week away, hundreds of witches and wizards from all over the world with cheap tickets had already begun to gather on the campground outside. Harry arrived at an Apparition point specifically for Ministry officials and the players themselves.</p><p>It was ten after six when he walked out onto the pitch, flooded with lights. He saw a good deal of people high up in the air, soaring around the stadium on their brooms, while those in more professional-looking robes were standing in a group in the centre of the field. The only immediately-recognizable one out of the group from a distance, white-blond hair shining like a beacon, was Malfoy.</p><p>“There you are!” Hermione said when she saw him, looking incredibly exasperated. Kingsley shot Harry a wink, and Harry smirked at him in return. He glanced once at Malfoy, who lifted an arrogant eyebrow, and then looked away again with every intention of pretending he didn’t exist. Fancourt grabbed Harry’s hand in his turn and shook it once, firmly, with a jovial little “Good to see you, Harry, good to see you!” With those greetings (or lack thereof) out of the way, Hermione directed Harry’s attention to the Israeli wizards. “Harry, this is Moshe Mizrachi, the Israeli Minister for Magic. Minister, this is Harry Potter, our Seeker and Captain.” There was the inevitable lift of eyes to take in his scar, and Harry only just managed not to scowl. “And this is Noam Peretz,” she went on, indicating a second wizard, “their Department Head for International Wizarding Relations. Mr. Peretz, Harry Potter.”</p><p>“Delighted, Mr. Potter, truly,” Mr. Peretz said warmly, shaking Harry’s hand and looking up at Harry’s forehead once again. When he tore his eyes away, they landed back on Hermione, then shifted to Malfoy. “I was hoping to go over security details, then …”</p><p>As the talk shifted back to business, Harry figured he’d be allowed to sidle off and join the rest of his team, a few of which had landed once they’d seen the Ministry officials wandering off. Harry spared one last glance at Malfoy, who was pointing something out in the stands to Mr. Peretz, before turning and spotting Killian Vance — one of their Beaters — landing a few feet away.</p><p>“All right there, Harry?” he said, grinning brightly. “Bradley and I were taking bets on whether you’d show up or not.”</p><p>“The hell kind of Captain do you think I am?” Harry scoffed, halfway between amusement and guilt. It was always fairly easy to ignore what the media had to say about him, but when his reputation began cropping up like this, among his friends and his colleagues — when he was forced to face the consequences of his rapidly-deflating sense of responsibility — Harry always felt a small pang of uncertainty.</p><p>But he didn’t like to think too much about that if he could help it.</p><p>“You’d’ve got away with it if you hadn’t,” Killian said, and judging by the conspiratorial wink, he thought he was paying Harry quite a compliment. Harry tried not to let his exasperation show.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Harry was engrossed in a deeply complicated conversation with Jeremy Fowler, England’s Keeper, revolving around tactics for the game next week. This made it even more irritating when Malfoy interrupted them. </p><p>“Potter,” he drawled, cutting Fowler off mid-sentence, and Harry felt his hackles instantly rise. Fowler looked nonplussed, and after going back and forth a few times between the looks Harry and Malfoy were giving one another, he apparently decided scarpering was prudent. “We need to discuss —” </p><p>“I was in the middle of a conversation, Malfoy,” Harry snapped. “You’ve got no fucking manners, do you?”</p><p>“Language,” Malfoy said breezily. Harry clenched his jaw and forced his fists to remain at his sides. Malfoy seemed to have noticed them, because a look of dark amusement crossed his arrogant face. “As I was saying, we need to discuss your behaviour over the following week.” </p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“Your <em>behaviour</em>, Potter. I’m referring, of course, to your penchant for acting like a moronic teenager every time you’re out in public these days.” Harry opened his mouth, ready to start yelling if he wasn’t allowed to throw a punch, but at the very last second managed to swallow back everything he wanted to say. Hermione was about twenty feet from them with the Israeli Minister, and she’d given him a sharp look after having spotted him with Malfoy. He could feel his nails digging into his palm and wondered if he’d broken the skin. Malfoy watched him through all of this with narrowed eyes, perhaps waiting for his outburst; a smirk touched his lips when he appeared to have decided it wasn’t coming. “Very good, Potter. You’ll want to continue exercising discretion until the Cup is over. I know the only thing that comes naturally to you is acting bull-headed and reckless, but if you embarrass the Ministry this week, there <em>will </em>be hell for you to pay. Is that clear?” </p><p>“If that’s the case,” Harry retorted sharply, “you should stay as far away from me as possible, since <em>you’re </em>the only thing that’s making me feel like doing something <em>reckless</em> right now, Malfoy.”</p><p>“I’m flattered, truly,” Malfoy said with an ostentatious roll of his eyes. “Do I have your word, then, Potter? No drinking in public, no <em>Muggle drugs</em>, no —”</p><p>“What, I can’t smoke <em>any</em> weed this <em>whole</em> week?” he said, mock-surprise colouring his voice with sarcasm. Malfoy’s pouty lips thinned with irritation and Harry could see a muscle working in his jaw. “I dunno, Malfoy, I really can’t promise something like that. You know me, bull-headed and reckless is all I know. Besides, how else do you expect me to relax? It’s like me telling you not to take it up the arse anymore — would you <em>really </em>be able to give that up, Malfoy? Be honest.” </p><p>The sight of Malfoy spluttering incoherently was so satisfying it nearly made up for the destroyed flat that morning.</p><p>“That’s what I thought,” Harry said solemnly, ridiculously proud of the way he was successfully holding back his laughter. <em>Laughter</em>, of all things — to think he had been only seconds away from getting drunk instead of coming to this thing seemed impossible now. “Before you ask me to give up something <em>I</em> love, think first about how you’d feel if someone asked <em>you</em> to give up something <em>you </em>love —”</p><p>“Shut the <em>fuck </em>up, Potter!” Malfoy shouted; then, seeming to come back to himself, took in a deep breath and let it out slowly. Harry <em>thrilled </em>to know how quickly he’d gotten right underneath Malfoy’s skin.</p><p>“<em>Language</em>, Malfoy —”</p><p>“Potter, I swear to god, one more word,” Malfoy snapped. Harry’s teeth clicked shut and he grinned broadly over them. “Since you are utterly incapable of taking anything seriously —”</p><p>“That’s not fair, Malfoy,” Harry interrupted him. Malfoy looked ready to tackle Harry to the ground. “I would <em>seriously </em>love to eat your arse right now —”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Malfoy threw his hands up in capitulation, cheeks positively <em>flaming</em>. Harry simply couldn’t hold back a bark of laughter. “You’re completely fucking incorrigible. You know what? See if I care. In fact, I <em>hope </em>you make an arse out of yourself, Potter; then Hewitt can play instead of you.” </p><p>“You’d rather see me put in my place than win the game?”</p><p>“Oh <em>please</em>, arrogance looks terrible on you, <em>Scarhead</em>.” Malfoy made a <em>tch</em>-ing sound of disgust in his throat. He looked completely flustered, the blush on his face having spread down his neck, and Harry was only mildly interested to note a stirring of arousal in his belly. Arrogant and intolerable as he might have been, the reality of Malfoy’s physical appeal was unavoidable, and he looked especially delicious right now, worked up on nothing more than Harry’s taunting. He supposed he really wouldn’t have minded eating Malfoy’s arse, in fact. “Anyway, seeing as this is utterly pointless — good<em>bye</em>, Potter. I so look forward to seeing you watching from the sidelines next week.”</p><p>Harry didn’t bother saying anything else, and Malfoy didn’t bother waiting anyhow. His eyes found Malfoy’s arse as he sauntered away, a smirk twitching at the corner of his mouth. Shagging that contemptuous sneer off his face was unrealistic, maybe, but <em>thinking </em>about it suited Harry just fine.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>He’d only smoked marijuana three or four times since the incident six months ago when that incriminating photograph had appeared in the paper, and before having had his row with Malfoy, he’d had no intention at all of lighting up between now and the Cup. </p><p>Of course, there was nothing so tempting as the forbidden fruit, and Harry had always been particularly susceptible when it came to things he wasn’t supposed to do. </p><p>There were two things on his mind that night as he sat drinking a lager amongst a rather large group of his friends, in a pub just down the street from Ron and Hermione's flat: Malfoy, and the eighth of weed trapped inside an airtight jar in his bedroom closet. </p><p>The latter briefly shifted to the back of his mind, however, when the former walked into the pub ahead of a nameless, dark-haired bloke who was holding the door for him.</p><p>Nobody else seemed to notice Malfoy’s presence; Malfoy saw <em>him </em>within moments, though, and Harry smirked as soon as their eyes met. </p><p>For having chucked a glass candle-holder across his flat that morning, he was remarkably pleased to be seeing Malfoy now. And perhaps he <em>was</em> acting like a teenager, to be getting off on something as trivial and petty as a schoolyard rivalry; maybe it <em>was </em>immature to be thinking about how good it would feel to have his cock buried in Malfoy’s perfect arse when he <em>should </em>have been thinking about keeping his head down until the Cup was over; but for the first time, it occurred to Harry that maybe, if it meant enjoying himself this much, he rather <em>deserved </em>be childish while he was still young.</p><p>Didn't he?</p><p>He swigged back the rest of his beer and banged the empty glass down on the table. Dean hollered cheerfully.</p><p>“Harry, that was your <em>third</em>, wasn’t it?” Hermione said in a voice of forced casualness; beside her, Ron snorted into his own glass. She shot him a quick, disgusted look before leveling her watchful gaze back on Harry. “Just remember you’ve promised to cut yourself off after three —”</p><p>“Oi! The man just got dumped, Hermione, let him live a little tonight,” said Dean, to which Harry laughed and Hermione merely scowled. “What’s he gonna do, go streaking through London?” </p><p>“Don’t make me out to be the bad guy, Dean!” Hermione snapped. Harry rolled his eyes, but nobody seemed to have noticed. “<em>I’m</em> looking out for him. Something which I hope <em>you </em>take into consideration,” she added suddenly, whipping around to look at Harry with blazing eyes. “Getting broken up with was a <em>direct </em>consequence of the way you’ve been acting and you know it.” </p><p>“Yeah, well, you know what?” said Harry tightly, standing up from the table. “I’m only <em>twenty-three </em>fucking years old, Hermione. I spent eleven years in a cupboard under some stairs and the next seven working up to the task of killing an evil fucking <em>maniac</em>, so guess what? If I feel like acting like a teenager, then I’m gonna act like a bloody teenager, all right?” </p><p>“<em>Harry</em>,” Ron said stiffly, standing up as well and dropping a protective arm across Hermione’s shoulders. “Slow down, mate.” </p><p>Hermione, for her part, looked completely gobsmacked and even more horrified; a pinch of guilt settled in Harry’s stomach immediately and he let out a little sigh, thumb and forefinger lifting to pinch the bridge of his nose.</p><p>“Look, I’m sorry, Hermione — I just … <em>really </em>need you to lay off me for a bit. It’s a bloody pain in the arse being hounded by reporters and having my life splashed across the news for everybody to judge at their own fucking leisure. It's worse than ever with the Cup around the corner.” He paused, saw Hermione’s lower lip wobbling precariously, and sighed. “I’m sorry, ‘Mione. Really. It’s not your fault I’m on edge.” </p><p>“It’s all right, Harry,” she said softly. One of her small hands found his arm and squeezed. “I … well, we can talk tomorrow. Go on and get another drink.”</p><p>He flashed her a grateful smile and, not needing to be told twice, headed off towards the bar.</p><p>Malfoy’s back was to Harry, facing the bloke he’d come in with; he looked positively edible in a tight pair of trousers that clung to his arse <em>perfectly</em>, and his date seemed to be well aware of this, for there was a hungry look in his eyes. Harry was a <em>little </em>surprised by the surge of irrational possessiveness this created, but only a little. </p><p>Three beers in and having only that afternoon been reminded of the sort of passion Malfoy could inspire in him, Harry thought it was actually rather <em>unsurprising </em>he should feel jealous of anybody else commanding the blond’s attention.</p><p>When he got to the bar, Harry ordered loudly enough that Malfoy would hear, and on cue he spun around. Harry laughed delightedly even as his groin tightened.</p><p>“Brilliant,” Malfoy sneered, sizing Harry up with narrowed eyes. “Front row seats to watch you make an embarrassment of yourself <em>once </em>again, Potter. I’ll just get a letter ready to send to Fancourt, shall I? He’ll be devastated — I know for a fact he was looking forward to wanking himself raw at the sight of you on your broomstick next week.”</p><p>“Are we talking about Fancourt or <em>you</em>, Malfoy?” Harry said pleasantly. Malfoy scoffed loudly, his eyes going impossibly wide. He had turned to fully face Harry now, having apparently forgotten the bloke standing behind him. “Because Fancourt has kids; meanwhile, <em>you</em> were blushing like a schoolgirl at the thought of me eating you out today, so …” </p><p>“Potter!” Malfoy screeched. The blush had returned, and Harry barely managed to keep from punching the air in triumph. <em>God</em> but Malfoy looked good like that. His date was scowling deeply now, but Malfoy still did not turn back to him. “You’re an uncivilized fucking <em>brute</em>.” </p><p>“You’re blushing again, Malfoy.”</p><p>Malfoy spluttered, and the flush deepened prettily.</p><p>“Erm — <em>Draco</em>?”</p><p>Malfoy turned a withering glare on his date, who shrank back in surprise. “I’m in the middle of a fucking conversation, Connor,” he said hotly. Harry didn’t bother hiding his laugh.</p><p>“Well excuse the fuck out of me!” Connor scoffed. “We’re supposed to be on a <em>date</em>, are we not?” </p><p>“Meaning what?” said Malfoy, sneering. “I can’t talk to anyone but <em>you</em>? Merlin help me if <em>that</em>’s the case.”</p><p>Connor looked to be somewhere right in the middle of bewildered and angry. </p><p>“I’ll just bloody leave then, shall I?! Since you’d so much rather flirt blatantly with Harry fucking Potter in front of me!”</p><p>“<em>Flirt</em>?!” Draco screeched. The barkeeper set Harry’s beer down in front of him — Harry took it with a little nod and a smile and leaned back against the bar to watch Malfoy ream into his date with an expression of polite interest and his free hand stuffed casually into his jeans’ pocket. “Don’t be an <em>idiot</em>, Connor. First of all, I came here with you tonight because you asked me out <em>four separate times </em>and finally wore me down like some useless, lumbering moron. Second, that was <em>fighting</em>, not <em>flirting</em>, halfwit, but it’s no wonder you can’t tell the difference. And third, even if I <em>were </em>flirting with Potter, I hardly think it’s within your jurisdiction to get upset about it, so you can shove your indignant little tirade <em>right</em> up your arse, Connor.”</p><p>Wide-eyed and dazed-looking, Connor seemed unable to form speech for a moment. Harry took this opportunity to chime in.</p><p>“If I were you, I’d hightail it out of here,” he suggested mildly. </p><p>Malfoy glared at him. “<em>You’re </em>next, Potter.”</p><p>“And I’m beside myself with enthusiasm, Malfoy, believe me.” </p><p>With another scoff and a resentful sweep of Malfoy’s body, Connor slammed his drink down on the bar and stalked away. </p><p>“Was that completely necessary, Potter?” Malfoy said waspishly.</p><p>“<em>Me</em>?!” Harry laughed incredulously. “The hell did <em>I </em>do?!”</p><p>“You stood there like an arrogant <em>toerag</em>!” </p><p>This gave Harry pause; he blinked rather owlishly at Malfoy, who spotted the look and scowled. </p><p>“As vapid as ever, aren’t you, Potter?” he said. But Harry wasn’t really listening; a smile was coming over his face, for a memory had surfaced — or rather a memory <em>of </em>a memory. At one time, it had caused him greatest despair to know what his mum had once thought of his dad, but as he’d gotten older, and as he’d learned how little black-and-white there was to the world, he’d grown rather fond of knowing his parents had overcome a history of … not getting along.</p><p>His mother had once referred to his <em>father</em> as an arrogant toerag — Harry could recall it perfectly now, it had been one of Snape’s memories, he and Lily in their fifth year at Hogwarts.</p><p><em>I know James Potter’s an arrogant toerag</em>, she’d said. <em>You don’t have to tell me that</em>.</p><p>He didn’t know why it should feel so delightful that Malfoy had unwittingly described him the exact same way Lily Evans had once described James Potter. It just <em>did</em>.</p><p>“Malfoy, d’you wanna have a cigarette with me?” he asked suddenly. Malfoy blinked several times in succession.</p><p>“<em>What</em>?” he said finally.</p><p>“A cigarette. Do you want to have one. With me.” </p><p>“Wh —” he started, and then broke off, looking irritated and a little bit interested, although Malfoy probably didn’t intend for him to see that last bit. “A <em>cigarette</em>?” </p><p>“<em>Yes</em>. With <em>me</em>. I don’t know how else to explain it, Malfoy.” </p><p>“Don’t be a smartarse, Potter,” he snapped. Harry grinned. “Fine … since you’ve done away with my date for the night anyhow. Lead the way, then.”</p><p>Harry drained the rest of his beer and gestured towards the door with his head. He pulled a pack of Marlboros out of his back pocket and waved it at Hermione, who had spotted him and Malfoy from across the pub and looked puzzled. She looked like she very much wanted to follow him and ask what was going on, so he was relieved when she didn’t get out of her chair or alert anybody else at the table to what was going on.</p><p>He and Malfoy walked to the edge of the building, where a very thin alley divorced it from an overflowing diner. Pulling two cigarettes out, he placed both between his lips, used a Muggle lighter to spark the ends, and then handed one over. Malfoy took it with a strange, indecipherable expression on his face. </p><p>“What’s <em>that </em>look?” Harry half-laughed, cigarette between his thumb and first finger as he took a long drag. </p><p>“Nothing,” Malfoy insisted too quickly. His cheeks reddened, and Harry knew he’d realized how it had sounded. “You’re being irritatingly charming.” </p><p>“Aw, you’re just saying that, Malfoy.”</p><p>Malfoy scowled. “It was an <em>insult</em>, Potter.”</p><p>“How was that an <em>insult</em>?” Harry laughed.</p><p>“Because I’m saying you’re not usually charming!”</p><p>“Malfoy, you don’t even <em>know </em>me, how can you say what I’m usually like?”</p><p>“I’ve known you since we were eleven, moron.” </p><p>“We’ve spoken three or four times in the last <em>five </em>years.” </p><p>“Exactly — there’s not much to know about you, Potter. You’re all surface-level.”</p><p>“Is that why you’ve been blushing around me so prettily all day?” Harry smirked. </p><p>To his credit, Malfoy rolled his eyes rather believably, but the instant color in his cheeks was a dead giveaway. He must have felt it there, because he scowled again.</p><p>“Think what you want,” he said, sucking on the end of his cigarette and letting a lazy trail of smoke out from between his full lips. Harry was visited by a sudden, powerful urge to lick inside Malfoy’s mouth and taste the acrid, bitter tobacco on his tongue. “I would never pay you a compliment, Potter — it would give me <em>hives</em>.”</p><p>“You know, you’re really rather cute when you’re annoyed with me.”</p><p>“I’m not <em>cute</em>, Potter,” Malfoy said tetchily. “And I’m <em>always </em>annoyed with you.” </p><p>Harry leaned one shoulder against the brick wall of the building and flicked away the ash at the end of his cigarette. He said nothing, and watched in amusement as Malfoy began fidgeting under his scrutiny. How had he never noticed before how <em>responsive </em>Malfoy was, how beautifully he reacted to Harry’s relentless teasing? He wondered now how far beneath Malfoy’s shirt that flush had spread. </p><p>“Why did you ask me to come out here with you, Potter?”</p><p>Harry considered the question a moment, and then he pushed off the wall and tossed his half-smoked cigarette into the street. Malfoy’s eyebrows drew together. Grinning, Harry plucked the cigarette from Malfoy’s hand as well, cupped his soft cheek with his free one, and without even a suggestion of reluctance leaned in and kissed him hard on the mouth. Malfoy froze, but within seconds he began responding to Harry’s coaxing, drawing his lips apart with a gasp and letting Harry slip his tongue inside. He felt a moan vibrate between them and threw down Malfoy’s cigarette so he could get a hand on his waist instead. </p><p>It tasted bitter from the tobacco and whatever he’d been drinking, but underneath that was the distinctly sweet taste of <em>Malfoy</em>, and it was this that Harry couldn’t get enough of. Their tongues twisted and curled around each other, panting breaths passing frantically between them as they devoured one another. Harry bit down sharply on Malfoy’s pouting lower lip, earning a hiss and a shove in his chest, but Harry held him close and fused their mouths back together impatiently. Malfoy actually <em>whimpered </em>into the kiss, hands fisting in Harry’s worn-out <em>English National League </em>t-shirt.</p><p>“Come back to my flat,” Harry said against his jaw, kissing and nipping his way down to Malfoy’s neck now, <em>itching </em>to taste that flushed skin. Malfoy shivered and tightened his fingers; Harry felt sharp nails piercing him through the thin material of his shirt.</p><p>“Why?” Malfoy demanded croakily. Harry slipped his hands down from Malfoy’s waist to the swell of his arse and squeezed, pulling their hips together. He could feel Malfoy’s hard cock slide against his own and groaned into the juncture of his neck and shoulder.</p><p>“Why the fuck do you think, Malfoy?” he growled. “I can’t eat your arse out here in front of The Red Lion, can I?” </p><p>“You’re very <em>presumptuous</em>, did you know that, Potter?” Malfoy said breathily.</p><p>“D’you really want me to back off?” he mumbled into Malfoy’s neck. “Because I will.” </p><p>Malfoy didn’t answer right away; his head tipped back slightly to expose his long, pale throat as it was sucked and licked at, and Harry chuckled against his skin. </p><p>“No,” he said finally, in a weak, helpless sort of voice. “I don’t.”</p><p>“Brilliant. Take my hand.” He pulled away and held his palm out, meeting Malfoy’s eyes challengingly with a smirk — after a moment of hesitation Malfoy took it and they spun on the spot, Harry leading him through the unbearably tight pressure of time and space to his flat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>He Apparated them directly into his living room, and they weren’t there for more than a few seconds before Malfoy pounced on him.</p><p>He laughed delightedly, twining his arms around Malfoy’s slim waist and pulling their bodies flush, hips slotting and cocks rubbing together through their clothing. Malfoy moaned into his mouth, having apparently abandoned any reserve he’d still been holding onto back at the pub.</p><p>Harry licked hungrily between his lips, tasting the silky-smooth lining and marveling, somewhere in the back of his mind, at the fact that just this very morning he’d come home to find the living room in a state of utter disrepair — a present from his ex-girlfriend. And now here he was, in the very same room, backing Malfoy up towards a sofa which had been slashed to ribbons before Hermione had mended it.</p><p>“This is <em>completely </em>moronic,” Malfoy breathed, even as Harry began hurriedly popping the fastenings on his shirt. When his fingers slipped for the third time, he growled low in his throat and simply tore the shirt open, buttons flying haphazardly and landing noisily all across the hardwood floor. “Potter, you fucking <em>barbarian</em>, are you kidding me!”</p><p>“First of all,” Harry said lightly, nipping at the corner of Malfoy’s jaw as he pulled the shirt off his bony shoulders, exposing an unearthly amount of gorgeous pale skin. Striped gruesomely across his front were the faded scars from a hex cast long ago in a Hogwarts bathroom. Harry determinedly ignored them for now. “I hardly think <em>moronic </em>is the word to use; second, I’m obviously <em>not </em>kidding, and if you promise to stop whingeing long enough for me to get my mouth on you, I’ll repair the bloody shirt for you later.”</p><p>“As if I’d trust <em>you </em>to handle silk —” Malfoy started, but he cut off with a beautiful little gasp when Harry cupped him through his trousers, squeezing lightly around the outline of his cock.</p><p>“Malfoy?” Harry said into his ear, stroking him slowly, nowhere <em>near </em>enough. Malfoy whimpered, hands lifting helplessly to Harry’s shoulders and digging his nails in. “<em>Shut up</em>.”</p><p>And finally, Malfoy did.</p><p>Harry kissed him soundly, sucking at his lips and biting teasingly at the lower one, a vivid shock of heat coiling his belly tighter when Malfoy started fingering at the hem of his tee and then lifted it over his head. Those delicate, slightly cold hands immediately started mapping out his hard torso, but Harry didn’t give him long to explore before he was pressing Malfoy back onto the sofa and falling to his knees between his legs.</p><p>Malfoy arched up obediently to let Harry drag his trousers and pants down his long, slender legs, and at the sight of his stiff, leaking cock curved up against his tight stomach, dribbling pre-come onto the sparse trail of fine blond hair leading down from his navel, Harry felt a little bit of his sanity drain away.</p><p>“<em>Shit</em>, Malfoy, you look so fucking good.” He lifted Malfoy’s legs under the thighs, propping them securely over his shoulders and using his thumbs to spread his arse immodestly, the sight of his tight, pink little pucker making Harry’s cock throb painfully where it was still trapped in his denims. He leaned forward and breathed hotly across it, in reaction to which he felt a full-body shudder move through Malfoy’s willowy frame.</p><p>“Potter,” he moaned weakly, shifting his hips like he was trying to get Harry’s mouth on him faster. “This is … this is …”</p><p>“Long overdue?” Harry supplied cheekily; he used the pads of his thumbs to stretch Malfoy’s hole just <em>barely</em>, too tight to open him up much more than that. Malfoy made a high keening noise that brought a satisfied smirk to Harry’s face.</p><p>“I was going to say <em>absurd</em>.”</p><p>Harry snorted but didn’t reply — instead, he passed the flat of his tongue hard across Malfoy’s clenching hole, cock twitching at the sharp, musky taste of him. He groaned and tightened his grip on the fleshy globes of Malfoy’s perfect arse, holding him open and prising his hole as far open as he could. He used the tip of his tongue to trace around the rim and had to redouble his efforts when Malfoy bucked against his face.</p><p>He took his time, ignoring his fattening cock in favour of paying his full attention to working Malfoy’s dusky hole open with his mouth. He stabbed the pointed tip of his tongue shallowly inside, dipping slowly, methodically in and out, only stopping long enough to place a glob of spit onto his twitching pucker and then work it inside with his tongue. Malfoy let out a wrecked sob that went straight to Harry’s cock.</p><p>“<em>Don’t </em>touch yourself,” Harry snapped, having seen Malfoy’s hand snaking down to his prick, slim fingers an inch away when Harry spoke. “Keep your hands where I can see them, Malfoy, or I’ll stop.”</p><p>It appeared to cost Malfoy a great deal to comply, but the fact that he <em>did </em>made Harry feel dizzy with lust. His cheeks were filled with a pretty pink color and some of his golden blond hair had fallen in his face, giving him the appearance of some beautifully-debauched angel, one which Harry was frantic to continue tearing apart.</p><p>He pushed in farther this time, dropping his jaw open and pressing his tongue as deeply inside as it could go. He felt Malfoy clenching spasmodically around the wet muscle as he fucked him with it, his hands now gripping his thighs both to assist in holding himself open, and because Harry could see them there. Saliva dripped copiously out of the corners of his mouth and slicked Malfoy’s arse, making the slide easier and loosening him by degrees.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em> … Potter, if you don’t stop I’m gonna — god, I’m gonna <em>come</em> …” The last word was elongated into a devastating moan. Harry’s fingers dug into the meat of his arse but he pulled himself back, swiping a thumb across the loosened hole and rudely dipping it inside, all the way to the knuckle, causing Malfoy to buck and cry out.</p><p>“Stop moving,” Harry said, mild yet brooking no argument. Malfoy let his head fall against the back of the sofa, chest heaving, eyes shut, golden lashes brushing his effeminately high cheekbones. He looked like he was praying for patience. Watching him closely, Harry pulled his thumb out and replaced it with his middle finger, gliding it in easily through the wetness he’d put there. Malfoy keened but stayed still. “You’re doing so good,” Harry breathed, stuffing a second finger in beside the first and placing a wet kiss to the inside of Malfoy’s thigh.</p><p>He built up a rhythm with two fingers, occasionally leaning in to add more spit and ease the friction. Malfoy gasped and moaned beautifully each time Harry brushed deliberately across the sensitive little nub of his prostate, making sure to give it a firm rub on every third or fourth stroke, keeping Malfoy at the very edge of an orgasm.</p><p>“Potter!” he sobbed out when Harry squeezed in a third finger and only sped his pace up further. “I’m serious, if you don’t stop I’m gonna —”</p><p>“Good,” Harry bit out, slamming his fingers into Malfoy’s arse with brutal enthusiasm, reveling in the slick squelching noises they made. Malfoy’s prick was bobbing helplessly, untouched, smearing pre-come across his hard belly with nothing to rut against but air. “<em>Come</em> for me, then. Go on.”</p><p>Harry looped an arm around Malfoy’s thigh, using the leverage to hold him down, and stilled his fingers deep inside his arse, rubbing relentlessly against his prostate. Malfoy’s back tried to arch off the sofa only to be held in place by Harry, a moan ripping savagely from his throat as his body convulsed through what looked like an immensely powerful orgasm, ropes of come shooting out of his twitching prick and landing on his chest and his chin. Harry pumped his fingers through it, slowing down as Malfoy’s body first loosened and then began trembling.</p><p>“S-stop, please, <em>stop</em>,” he gasped, trying to fumble away from Harry, but Harry continued to hold him down, moving his fingers leisurely through Malfoy’s still-clenching hole. He sobbed weakly, the muscles in his stomach fluttering visibly beneath the skin.</p><p>“Did you just say <em>please</em>?” Harry smirked. Malfoy scoffed feebly and Harry finally pulled his fingers out. He got to his feet and bent over him, brushing their lips together.</p><p>“Fuck <em>off</em>, Potter.”</p><p>Harry laughed against his mouth. “It’s terrible manners to cuss at somebody who’s just given you an orgasm.”</p><p>“Have I told you how much I hate you?”</p><p>“Not recently, no,” Harry said, kissing him again. Malfoy lifted his neck into it eagerly. “I gathered as much, though,” he added, smiling and pulling back. “Get up on your knees and turn around for me.”</p><p>Malfoy let out a tiny huffing breath that seemed as though it was meant to convey annoyance but really just sounded adorable. Harry grinned dopily to himself as Malfoy lowered his legs and shifted onto his knees, turning to face the back of the sofa and tentatively resting his hands on it.</p><p>“You’re unreal,” Harry said reverently, leaning over him to sweep some of the hair away from the back of his neck and press a kiss to the warm skin there. Malfoy mewled and arched back into him, but Harry stopped him with a firm hand on his lower back.</p><p>His cock was <em>painfully </em>hard at this point, and it was with an audible groan of relief that Harry finally pulled it out of the confines of his jeans and divested himself of the rest of his clothing, wandlessly conjuring lube onto his pulsing shaft and stroking the length of it several times before stopping himself. Malfoy, he saw, was looking over his shoulder, eyes wide and rosy lips parted as he watched, the pink flush of his cheeks deepening to a hearty red that made him look much younger.</p><p>“Jesus, Potter,” he exhaled, a whiny quality to it that made Harry’s cock twitch in his hand. “What the <em>fuck</em>.”</p><p>In spite of himself, Harry laughed as he grabbed Malfoy’s arse again and spread his cheeks, pushing his cock between them slickly.</p><p>“You couldn’t just be the bloody Chosen One, could you?” Malfoy said weakly, hands gripping hard at the back of the sofa when Harry gripped the base of his straining cock and lined it up with Malfoy’s loosened rim. “Couldn’t just be sodding Boy Who Lived. You had to have a massive prick too, didn’t you?”</p><p>Instead of responding to this, Harry tightened his hold on Malfoy’s hip with one hand, and with the other guided his thick length past the twitching muscle of his hole. Malfoy let out a wrecked moan as Harry sank into him, slow but steady, not stopping until every last inch was being relentlessly squeezed by Malfoy’s sinfully tight walls. His pale hands were gripping the back of the sofa so hard they lost what little colour had been there in the first place.</p><p>“Shit,” Malfoy hissed, even as he pushed his hips back, forcing Harry’s cock deeper. “Shit, shit, shit …”</p><p>“That good?” Harry laughed, bending forwards to press a series of wet kisses between Malfoy’s sharp shoulder blades. “Fuck, you feel <em>fantastic</em>. How are you so <em>tight</em>?”</p><p>“Because I’m not a <em>slag</em>, Potter.”</p><p>Harry pulled out slowly and then rammed back inside, wrenching a gut-twistingly erotic gasp out of the slim blond beneath him.</p><p>“Are you insinuating that I <em>am </em>a slag?” Harry asked casually. He’d stopped moving, buried to the hilt inside of Malfoy’s arse; he could feel Malfoy shivering, and without really knowing why he was doing it, he found himself stroking his fingers soothingly down Malfoy’s sides. Or perhaps worshipfully was a better word.</p><p>“Yes,” said Malfoy, though the biting sarcasm was lost amongst the trembling of his voice. “That is <em>exactly </em>what I’m insinuating. Now do me a fucking favour and start <em>moving</em>, you utterly incorrigible <em>twat</em>.”</p><p>Grinning broadly, Harry slid his fingers through the back of Malfoy’s hair and gripped hard, pulling his head back so his throat was bared vulnerably. It was a devastatingly appealing sight to behold. He could see Malfoy’s eyes widen, could even feel his breathing increase again, but didn’t let go.</p><p>“Do you think demanding things is going to work out for you right now?” Harry whispered, leaning over his body and letting the heat of his breath ghost across the side of Malfoy’s neck. “Because from where I’m standing, you have very little leverage at the moment, kitten.”</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em> you, Potter!” It came out as more of a whine than anything else. Malfoy must have been aware of this, because he let out a shuddering breath. “Fuck, just … <em>fuck me</em> already!”</p><p>“Can you say please again? I quite liked the sound of it before.”</p><p>“Who the fuck <em>are</em> you?!” Malfoy ground out. He tried to thrust his hips back again, but Harry held him steady with the hand not tangled up in his hair. “Just move your cock!”</p><p>“That didn’t sound like a ‘please’,” Harry said lightly, and for good measure rocked his hips, knowing by the way Malfoy shuddered that his cock had passed across his prostate. “Come on, kitten … it’s not hard. Just say it, and I’ll fuck you stupid.”</p><p>“Stop calling me that!” But again, Malfoy’s words came out as more of a whine than anything really forceful or commanding. Harry let go of his hair and instead moved his hand so his fingers were wrapped gently around Malfoy’s throat; not tightly enough to feel pressure, but <em>firm </em>enough so it would be impossible not to imagine what the pressure would have felt like. To his utter delight, Malfoy responded to this beautifully, arching his back and digging his fingers deeper into the sofa.</p><p>“Say it,” Harry breathed into his ear. Malfoy whimpered. “I know you wanna come again. I’ll make it so good for you. Just <em>say it</em>.”</p><p>He tightened his fingers minimally and felt Malfoy’s Adam’s apple bob when he swallowed.</p><p>“<em>Please</em>,” he rasped.</p><p>“Please what?”</p><p>Malfoy made a sound halfway between a moan and a garbled wail. “Fuck me, you bastard! <em>Please</em>, please fuck me!”</p><p>Grinning in triumph and with a powerful surge of possessiveness making his spine tingle, Harry let go of Malfoy’s throat, gripped his hips hard, and started pounding into him with little abandon. Malfoy’s hands scrabbled frantically before gaining purchase and he looked to be holding on for dear life as Harry incessantly pulled out and slammed back in, ceaselessly burying his aching cock in Malfoy’s perfect arse with a reckless sort of urgency. The slick, wet squelching sounds of the lube and Harry’s own pre-come with each devastating thrust only heightened the whole experience.</p><p>Malfoy was making the most delicious gasping sounds each time Harry pounded into him, his cock hard again and beading pre-come at the tip. He seemed to have figured out that Harry wasn’t going to let him touch himself, because he wasn’t even trying. At the edge of his own orgasm, Harry waited until he felt Malfoy start shuddering and shaking beneath him to pull out all the way. This earned him a high, mewling sound of protest out of the blond.</p><p>“What the fuck!” Malfoy sobbed, pressing his forehead into the sofa as his body shook. Harry could feel his heart slamming into his ribs and took several deep breaths, sweat dripping down his back.</p><p>“Turn over,” he said a bit breathlessly. Malfoy looked over his shoulder and Harry saw that his full, sensual lips were bitten raw.</p><p>“What the fuck are you talking about?! Why did you stop, I was … I was so fucking <em>close</em>!”</p><p>Huffing out an impatient breath, Harry manhandled Malfoy onto his back, lengthwise across the sofa, and climbed on top of him, between his spread thighs. Their cocks slid together when Harry bent over him, crushing their mouths together into a searing kiss that Malfoy instantly deepened with his tongue.</p><p>“I can’t fucking stand you,” Malfoy breathed when he pulled away for air, and even as he said it his fingers were twisting around the black mess of hair at the back of Harry’s head, tugging lightly. Harry chuckled and nipped at his jaw, moving his hips, dragging their pricks together wetly.</p><p>“Ask me how much I care.” Harry licked a broad stripe up the side of Malfoy’s neck and shifted his hips, using one hand to line himself up again and start pushing inside that unbearably tight heat.</p><p>“There’s not much you <em>do </em>care about these days, is there, Potter?” Malfoy said faintly, voice breaking as he was stuffed full once again. His back arched up off the sofa, hands coming around to Harry’s back where his nails dug in sharply. Harry hissed at the pain.</p><p>“Sure there is,” he said tightly, bottoming out and rocking his hips, biting his lip to hide a grin when Malfoy gasped, knowing he’d found his prostate again. “They’re just not the things everybody <em>expects </em>me to care about.”</p><p>He started up a tedious rhythm, pressing in deep and then pulling out just as slow, savouring every sensation, every little nuance as Malfoy opened up for him and let some of his uptight façade fade away. His eyes kept fluttering shut despite an obvious effort not to let that happen, something which tugged strangely at Harry’s chest. His nails dug into Harry’s back each time his prostate was grazed.</p><p>“Fuck …” Malfoy whimpered after several minutes of this, moving his hips impatiently and bringing his hands around to Harry’s chest, digging his nails in there instead. “God, Potter, I’m close again … faster, <em>please</em> …” The bratty, demanding quality had almost entirely disappeared from his voice, leaving him sounding breathless and desperate and <em>fuck</em>, the sound of it went straight to Harry’s cock.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” he said gruffly, losing his own teasing tone as well, the orgasm he’d only temporarily pulled back the reigns on creeping up again with a vengeance. Malfoy’s slender cock was straining between them, smearing their bellies with slick, and Harry finally wrapped a hand around it, tearing a broken cry out of Malfoy’s swollen pink mouth. He dragged the foreskin down, exposing the sensitive, reddened head, and flicked his thumb across it. Malfoy’s hips bucked and his nails dug into Harry’s skin harder.</p><p>“Don’t stop,” Malfoy whimpered frantically, and this time, Harry had no plans to. He increased the speed of his thrusts and tugged relentlessly at Malfoy’s throbbing, weeping prick. “Don’t stop, oh my god, I’m <em>coming</em>, d-don’t <em>stop</em>!” Indeed, the words had barely left his mouth when Harry felt his walls clenching down around his cock, body tense and jerking as Harry worked him through his second orgasm, sharp nails drawing blood where they’d latched onto his biceps. It took only moments for Harry to tip over the edge as well, burying his face in Malfoy’s neck as his cock pulsed and throbbed and spilled out what seemed to be an endless amount of come into Malfoy’s clenching hole. It was leaking out around him as he slowed, rocking his hips each time he bottomed out, and finally stopping altogether even as his heart continued to throw itself feverishly against the walls of his ribcage.</p><p>He lifted his head when he’d gotten some semblance of a normal breathing rhythm back and looked down at an oddly open-faced Malfoy, whose grey eyes were, for the first time in memory, not cold and calculating but bright with wonder.</p><p>“That was … something,” he said, and Harry laughed before he’d even realized he was going to.</p><p>“Something,” he echoed, nodding his head and letting his eyes roam freely across this new Malfoy’s face. “Yeah. <em>Definitely </em>something.” He paused, and then leaned down slowly to kiss him again, glad when he met no resistance. It was messy and unhurried and utterly opposite to any other kiss they’d shared so far tonight. When he pulled away, he felt something essential shift between them, and he couldn’t find the necessary will power to stop himself asking, “D’you wanna smoke a joint with me?”</p><p>He expected scoffing at the very least, and so was extremely surprised when he received nothing worse than a lifted eyebrow.</p><p>“You’re not serious?” Malfoy drawled.</p><p>“Er — I think I am, actually, yeah. It’s great after sex, and I’d really like to see you high.”</p><p>“<em>Muggle </em>drugs, Potter?” Malfoy lilted. “Really? You’re supposed to be <em>refraining </em>from doing anything stupid until the Cup is over.”</p><p>“C’mon, Malfoy, just this once? It feels great, I promise. I won’t tell anyone.”</p><p>Malfoy scoffed. “I should <em>hope </em>you wouldn’t. I’ll hex your bollocks off if you tell anyone about <em>this</em>, either.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes but smiled. “Wouldn’t dream of it. So is that a yes?”</p><p>Malfoy paused, looking up at him uncertainly, and finally said, “How long does it last?”</p><p>“Dunno, like … couple hours, I guess. Definitely no more than that.”</p><p>Another, longer pause. “Fine,” Malfoy said suddenly, and Harry nearly whooped with enthusiasm. He could plainly see Malfoy holding back a smirk even as he rolled his eyes to the ceiling.</p><p>After Vanishing their messes, Harry pulled nothing more than his pants back on and waited with a smirk on his face as Malfoy tried to put his shirt on as well, only to have Harry grab his hand and pull him away.</p><p>“I’m cold, Potter!” he said as he was dragged to Harry’s bedroom. Harry pulled a jumper out of his dresser and tossed it to him. “What is this?” Malfoy asked, and Harry looked over his shoulder to see him sneering at the Nirvana logo on the front.</p><p>“Muggle band,” he explained. He pulled a glass jar from the back of his closet and brought it over to the bed. “You can sit down, you know.”</p><p>Malfoy did so hesitantly, his eyes fixed on the jar Harry had just opened.</p><p>“What’s that called again?”</p><p>“Weed,” said Harry, pulling an already-rolled joint out and closing it back up to set on his bedside table. “It’s <em>really </em>not a big deal. Muggles have got some really nasty shit they do; this stuff is harmless.”</p><p>“So it’s legal, then?” Malfoy asked sceptically.</p><p> “Well … no, but —”</p><p>“Didn’t think so,” he said airily, but Harry definitely thought he could see a smirk lurking beneath the arrogance. “You’ll never change, Potter. If there’s a rule, you’ll find it and break it.”</p><p>“Yes, well, all the <em>fun </em>things are against the rules, aren’t they?” He crossed the bed to where Malfoy was sitting and held the joint up for him to see. “Look, it’s like a cigarette, except it’s got weed in it instead of tobacco. Tastes better, too.”</p><p>“I’ll be the judge of that.” He narrowed his eyes at it suspiciously. “What does it feel like?”</p><p>Harry stuck it between his lips, grabbed a green Muggle lighter off the nightstand, and sparked the end to life with a few deep puffs. He held it in several seconds and then blew it out in a hazy cloud.</p><p>“It, er — feels sort of fuzzy, I guess?” he said thickly, holding it out for Malfoy to take. “Try not to take too big a hit, though. It’ll burn your throat first couple times.”</p><p>Malfoy took it daintily between his thumb and first finger and held it to his lips. Harry knew immediately that warning him had been the wrong thing to do, because Malfoy had clearly taken it as a challenge and sucked in a deep breath that immediately came back out as a hacking cough. Trying his best not to laugh too loudly, he Conjured water into an empty glass and handed it over.</p><p>“I <em>told </em>you that would happen,” he said, grabbing the joint and taking another hit for himself while Malfoy soothed his throat and came down from the fit.</p><p>“That’s fucking <em>bollocks</em>,” Malfoy rasped, and snatched the joint to try it again.</p><p>It took only fifteen minutes for Malfoy to wind up on his side, cheek pressed into a pillow, eyes bloodshot and half-lidded. They’d smoked through the whole joint and Harry felt as pleasantly buzzed as Malfoy looked.</p><p>“You have really soft pillows, Potter,” Malfoy sighed, nuzzling his nose into it briefly and then letting out a highly contented sigh. Harry smiled and scooted closer, tangling their legs together and even boldly dropping an arm across Malfoy’s waist. Malfoy didn’t seem to mind one bit. “It’s like … a cloud or something. Did you Charm them to feel like clouds?”</p><p>“No, you’re just really fucking high,” Harry laughed.</p><p>“Oh.” Malfoy wrinkled his nose, and then he did something Harry couldn’t have anticipated: he moved even closer, and kissed Harry right on the mouth. “I can’t believe we fucked.”</p><p>“I dunno,” Harry mused, brushing a piece of silky hair away from Draco’s face. “I can sort of believe it. I mean, we were eventually gonna either fuck or kill each other, don’t you think?”</p><p>“I think you’re too charming to be the real Harry Potter.”</p><p>Harry snorted. “I’m going to take that as a compliment.”</p><p>“Take it however you want, Potter,” Malfoy saw around a yawn. He’d begun rubbing his foot against Harry’s leg. “Can I ask you something?”</p><p>“Sure,” he said. “I reserve the right not to answer, though.”</p><p>Malfoy rolled his eyes, but it was half-hearted. “When you said earlier that you don’t care about the things people expect you to care about … what did you mean by that?”</p><p>He hadn’t been expecting that, and for a moment it gave Harry pause. He dipped his fingers beneath the Nirvana jumper and trailed them lazily across the warm skin of Malfoy’s back.</p><p>“Just … the whole thing, I guess,” he said finally. “It’s like they expected me to keep being the fucking Chosen One even after the bloody thing I was <em>chosen for </em>is done. I mean, look, I’d fight Voldemort a hundred more times if that was what I had to do, but that doesn’t mean I wanna spend my life being everyone’s personal goddamn hero.  I just want a fucking break, y’know? They want me at all these stupid fucking Ministry functions just because it gets people interested when they know I’m there.”</p><p>“Typical,” Malfoy drawled.</p><p>“Yeah, it <em>is </em>bloody typical. Fancourt would probably <em>pay </em>me to settle down with some bird and start a family. Every interview I’m forced into, that’s the question: ‘When are you getting married?’ and ‘Will you be an Auror when you stop playing Quidditch?’ and ‘How many kids do you want?’ It’s never-fucking-ending. I’m only <em>twenty-three</em>, I mean, <em>fuck</em>. Give me a fucking minute to enjoy the first time I’ve <em>ever </em>been able to do whatever the hell I want, you know?”</p><p>He realized suddenly that he’d worked himself up and let out a long, slow breath. His head was still fuzzy, however, and it wasn’t difficult to bring himself back down. Especially not with a high, sleepy-looking Malfoy right there, curled into him.</p><p>“So was this some sort of rebellious act, then?” Malfoy asked. There was something unreadable in his eyes when he said it. “Bringing me back to your flat and fucking me?”</p><p>“No,” he said at once, studying Malfoy’s pretty face and delicate features while something utterly familiar but long since felt began growing in his chest and making it tight. “You are … wonderfully unexpected, Draco.” </p><p>The use of Malfoy’s first name was a tangible presence between them, especially potent when their eyes met. Harry tried his hardest to ascertain what was going on in his head but found it impossible to read his expression.</p><p>“What <em>do </em>you care about, then?” Malfoy said; it could have been a deflection, but Harry fancied there was a note of genuine curiosity in his voice.</p><p>“I dunno … enjoying myself?” He shrugged one shoulder as best he could when he was lying on his side. “Just … living, y’know? Having fun. It’s why I decided to play Quidditch instead of becoming an Auror. I guess maybe one day I might do that, but I doubt it.”</p><p>“What’s ‘one day’?”</p><p>Harry heaved a sigh and removed his hand from Malfoy’s back, using the pad of his thumb to drag down that bitten lower lip he’d been so focused on all night. Malfoy nipped lightly at the tip, bringing a fond smile to Harry’s face.</p><p>“No idea,” he said. “I’m only twenty-three. I’ve got time to figure it out.”</p><p>“Fair enough, I suppose.” Malfoy yawned again, the fingers of one hand idly tracing a scar he’d found on Harry’s chest. “As long as you win us the Cup, you have my permission to make an arse of yourself however you see fit.”</p><p>“And that’s all I need, is it?” Harry said, smiling helplessly. “<em>Your </em>permission?”</p><p>“If we’re going to continue shagging, then yes.”</p><p>Harry’s chest seemed to expand and he knew that if he could look at himself, he’d see a hopeless tenderness in his eyes as he raked them over Malfoy’s face. “And are we? Going to continue doing this?”</p><p>For the first time tonight, Harry saw a hint of something uncertain, even <em>anxious</em>, appear on Malfoy’s face.</p><p>“Only if you want to,” he said quietly.</p><p>Without hesitation, Harry leaned in and kissed him; he felt Malfoy smile into it and a hurricane of butterflies erupted in his stomach.</p><p>“I definitely, definitely want to.”</p><p>Malfoy nodded, clearly trying to suppress his grin. “You know, Potter, those Muggle drugs are useless.”</p><p>“Why do you say that?” Harry laughed.</p><p>“Because all it’s done is make me tired.”</p><p>“And adorable,” Harry added, smoothing a thumb across one pink cheek. “<em>Really </em>adorable.”</p><p>“I’m always adorable, Potter. Don’t be stupid.”</p><p>With that, his grey eyes disappeared behind his lids, and Harry felt his heart must surely burst right out of his chest when Malfoy tucked his head under Harry’s chin, let out a deep, satisfied-sounding breath, and went to sleep.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>He managed to make it all the way to the day of the World Cup without any bad press, although Harry thought this probably had something to do with the amount of time he and Malfoy spent in his bedroom. The ease with which they fell into a comfortable routine of being around each other might have been eerie had it not felt so utterly, <em>perfectly </em>natural.</p><p>True to his word, he didn’t say anything even to Ron and Hermione. It didn’t bother him, mostly because his evenings spent shagging Malfoy breathless had brought him around to the conclusion that he <em>liked </em>him — quite a lot, in fact — and had every intention of making him his boyfriend before August was over. It was a refreshing feeling, being <em>so </em>into somebody, for he realized now that he hadn’t felt this way since he had dated Ginny. The fact that it should be Malfoy to make him feel this way again became less surprising the more he thought about it and the more time they spent in each other’s company.</p><p>On the day of the match, there wasn’t much time to see one another. Malfoy was up to his ears with work to do and Harry was busy talking his team through their repertoire of plays one last time. However, just ten minutes before the crowds were due to be let into the stadium, Malfoy pulled him away under the guise of needing to speak with him; they went up to the top box, empty for now, and Harry wasted no time at all shoving his tongue inside that sweet-tasting mouth.</p><p>He was absolutely, unequivocally convinced that it gave him his edge during the game, and when they won by a landslide (Harry catching the Snitch forty-five minutes in, when his team was down twenty points), he screamed himself hoarse sixty feet in the air with the weakly-fluttering Snitch clasped tight in his fist and his head full of Malfoy.</p><p>One of England’s Chasers, Nerissa Murray, hosted a celebration at the enormous flat she shared with her girlfriend, and it was here that Harry was finally able to get Malfoy alone. </p><p>The flat was on the twenty-fifth floor of a building in the heart of London; it was nearing midnight when Harry, clutching his third beer, pulled Malfoy away from a bloke who was attempting to chat him up and out onto the balcony. </p><p>The view was stunning, and yet all Harry found himself looking at was Malfoy.</p><p>“So,” Malfoy said airily, leaning back against the railing and looking far too pretty to be allowed, “Defeater of Dark Lords and now World-Famous Quidditch Star to boot. Not bad, Potter. Not bad at all. You <em>might </em>even say I’m impressed.” </p><p>“Oh yeah?” Harry laughed, digging his pack of smokes out of his back pocket and handing one to Malfoy. As was his wont, he used his green Muggle lighter to spark the end of it before lighting his own. “That’s my lifelong goal realized, then.”</p><p>“You’re <em>very </em>funny.”</p><p>“That means a lot coming from you, Malfoy,” Harry teased, blowing out a long stream of smoke and then kissing his soft cheek. “I have something for you, by the way.” He pulled the Snitch from the game out of his jumper and pressed it into Malfoy’s free hand.</p><p>“What — the <em>Snitch</em>? Potter, this is … this is your <em>World Cup </em>Snitch, don’t be ridiculous. It’s a trophy in and of itself.”</p><p>“Yeah, well … I figure, you know, you’ve never got to touch one before, have you? Seeing as I always beat you to it in school.”</p><p>"Oh, ha bloody <em>ha</em>," Malfoy scoffed and elbowed Harry hard in the ribs. “Twat,” he added, but when he tried to hand it back, Harry closed his hand around it again.</p><p>“I’m taking the piss, Malfoy,” he chuckled. “Really, I want you to have it.”</p><p>“<em>Why</em>?”</p><p>“Because I <em>fancy </em>you, you great bloody git. Fuck, why do you have to be so difficult all the time?”</p><p>Malfoy’s jaw hung open and there was a suspicious look in his eyes that couldn’t entirely hide the burgeoning hopefulness Harry saw underneath. It made him feel warm all over and he had to use a massive amount of willpower to stop from kissing him again.</p><p>“Remember you said if I won the Cup for England I’d have your permission to make an arse of myself however I wanted?” he said, tapping some ash off his cigarette over the railing. Malfoy merely lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>“I … might recall having said something of that nature. However, I was <em>indisposed </em>thanks to your stupid Muggle drugs, so I can’t be held accountable for any claims I made.”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” Harry said pleasantly. “You said it, and I caught the Snitch that won us the game. Now I’m going to exercise my right to make an arse of myself.”</p><p>“And what is it, exactly, you plan on doing?” Malfoy drawled.</p><p>“I was thinking I’d ask you on a date, for starters.” He grinned widely when once again blatant shock registered on Malfoy’s face. “Maybe see if you wanted to do dinner tomorrow night after you’re done with work. Go from there, see what happens.”</p><p>“This is arse-backwards, Potter!” Malfoy hissed, voice low to avoid anyone inside hearing them (although it was doubtful over the blaring music). Fist still clutched around the Snitch, he whacked the back of his hand into Harry’s shoulder. “You can’t just fuck me for a week straight and <em>then </em>ask me on a date!”</p><p>“Well, why the hell not?” Harry retorted. “Never heard you complaining while my cock was up your arse. Besides, I wasn’t supposed to do anything reckless until <em>after </em>the Cup, remember?”</p><p>Malfoy opened his mouth like he was going to argue and then seemed to fall short of anything to say. Instead, he smacked Harry’s arm again, harder this time.</p><p>“You bloody wanker,” he said, and a moment later he’d crushed their mouths together so hard Harry dropped his cigarette in surprise. He laughed into the kiss and wound his arms around Malfoy’s waist, pulling him close and working his tongue between those ludicrously addictive lips.</p><p>“Is that a yes to the date tomorrow?” Harry said against his mouth a minute later, delighting in the little irritated huff Malfoy let out in response.</p><p>“You’re very persistent, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Only when I’m serious about something,” Harry hummed, and for good measure slid his hands down to Malfoy’s arse and squeezed. He leaned forwards again and brushed their lips together, loving the way he could feel Malfoy shiver in his arms. “C’mon … say yes. I’d <em>really </em>like to take you out, Malfoy.”</p><p>Malfoy must have dropped his own cigarette as well, because he lifted the hand that wasn’t closed around the Snitch and brushed some of Harry’s fringe away from his forehead, not scowling anymore but not smiling either. He looked contemplative now.</p><p>“When you say you <em>fancy </em>me …”</p><p>“I mean I really, <em>really </em>like you,” Harry said.</p><p>“You said yourself we don’t know each other, Potter. All you’ve done is shag me the last week, you can’t know you <em>like </em>me.”</p><p>“Well, that’s why I wanna take you on a date, isn’t it?” Harry pointed out, eyebrows raised. “To get to know you better?”</p><p>For a long minute, Malfoy said nothing. Then —</p><p>“All right.” He gave a little nod, and Harry broke into a megawatt grin.</p><p>“You mean it?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>, you insufferable, gorgeous <em>prat</em>. I mean it. And you’d better take me somewhere nice, or the deal’s off.”</p><p>“Brilliant,” Harry laughed, and nearly lifted Malfoy right off his feet when he kissed him again.</p><p>The hell of it was, maybe twenty-three wasn’t going to be so bad, after all.</p></div>
