    <hr/><p align="center"> <em><strong><u>You</u></strong></em></p><hr/><p align="center">There comes a point in life where choices become irreversible. A moment in time when the lines are blurred and there's no clear difference between good and evil. It's the moment when the world isn't simply black and white; right or wrong. But, rather—one of survival.</p><p align="center">This was one of those times.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>One moment his voice was thundering off the walls, the next—utter silence. And she had been the one to cause it.</p><p>The sight that lay before her was sickening. A grandiose display of both her fear and hatred for him. But also—entirely accidental. </p><p>There was a continuous stream of blood trickling out of the numerous wounds on his body. Paired with an overpowering stench of iron that permeated the air and it made her stomach convulse at the scent. Her father's breathing was labored and slow as he tried to cling onto the last shreds of life that were rapidly slipping through his fingers. His eyes blank and unresponsive as he stared directly at her.</p><p>His lips moved, but nothing came out. Trying in vain to formulate the questions that circled his mind out loud, but not having enough strength to do it. He wondered why she had done this. Why she would hurt him. His thoughts were interrupted when he started choking on the blood that was filling his lungs and he gasped for air, but it was to no avail.   </p><p>In mere moments, his struggle for air ceased to an abrupt stop and the silence in the room became deafening. The body that had been moving only moments before now lay in a widening puddle of crimson; never to move again. The young girl, who had been watching the scene before her in shock, started to shake uncontrollably. Her mind desperately tried to catch up—to comprehend what had just happened.</p><p>She had killed him. </p><p>A sniffle could be heard behind the quivering girl and she froze. She turned around to check on her mother and was met with the ghost of the person she once knew. The woman that lay before her was devastated; broken. A hollow shell crushed by the death of her husband as thick tears flowed in cohesive streams down her face.</p><p>Tentatively, her mother got up and brushed past to stand in front of her husband. She bent down to clutch the lifeless corpse in her arms and her body convulsed in grief. She wept for the love of her life. Her sobs pierced the stillness of the air around them like a knife before she turned to glare at the girl. When their gazes met, the growing fury in her eyes made her take a step back. </p><p>“What have you done!?” Her mother cried. Desperate for answers (Y/N) couldn't give.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to. I swear—” She said sniffing as tears started to pool in her eyes.</p><p>“You killed him! How could you!?”</p><p>“I don’t know what happened—” </p><p>“After all we've done for you," She pointed a finger in her face, droplets of spit flying out with every word. "this is how you repay us!? We should have never taken you in the first place!” </p><p>“I’m sorry. I—”</p><p>“You—! You're an evil spawn of the devil! You're a monster!”</p><p>“Please, I’m sorry—” (Y/N) tried to apologize for the second time, but it was no use. </p><p>She stormed toward the tiny figure with a vengeance, her actions were unpredictable; hasty. Raising her hands, her mother intended to strike her and all the little girl could do was lift her hands up in defense. The fear and adrenaline inside (Y/N) had continued to build up to an almost unbearable force and what little control she had was beginning to slip. Just like a cornered animal would lash out to protect itself, the magic inside her released.</p><p>Flames exploded out of (Y/N)'s hand and it instantaneously lit her mother on fire. The agonizing screams shook the inside of her skull and all she could do was watch her mother burn in horror. Watch as her clothes and hair started to singe and curl up at the edges with the intensity of the heat. The room started to permeate with the putrid smell of burning flesh and hair before she finally disintegrated right in front of her eyes. The ashes floating down to the ground in a massive heap and the room became silent once again</p><p>‘No—stop’ She pleaded. Everything was happening too fast. It felt like electric currents were leaving trails of fire in her veins and she couldn’t control it. It was overwhelming and it terrified her. </p><p>(Y/N) wished at that moment that none of this happened or that she could forget everything up to this point. Both of them. Gone. Just like that. And...she—murdered them. She was the one who stripped them of the very breath from their lungs. They would never live to see another second because of her. </p><p>In her panic, she hadn't noticed that the sparks from her hands had begun to set the room on fire. The carpet, the wallpaper, the ceiling—all of it had already started to blacken with the heat. Within seconds, the room was ablaze and it continued to spread with the ruthless tenacity of wildfire. Beams started to collapse and (Y/N) quickly looked around for a way to escape, but every exit was blocked. There was no way out.</p><p>Terror started to fill her lungs when she realized she might die there. The toxic smoke was cruel and unforgiving and her limbs started to weigh heavily with every intake of breath. An overwhelming sense of dizziness started to swarm her head and she fell to the floor with a thud. Tired eyes sliding shut and her mind drifting away into nothingness.</p><p>When the Ministry of Magic first got word that under-aged magic had been used, they weren't expecting this. </p><p>The cloaked figure stood in the front of the remaining shambles of a house. Clouds of smoke and ash saturating the air as the gold embers burned faintly in the night. When the haze started to clear, he staggered at the sight. </p><p>This wizard had seen destruction first hand, he was used to dealing with it by now. But nothing could have prepared for something like this. The sight of complete and utter devastation of both home and person alike nearly made him expel the contents of his stomach. He had to be strong. He had a mission to finish. He was to extract the girl and bring her to the Ministry. It was then they would decide what to do with her. After all, she was too dangerous on her own.</p><p>He found (Y/N) unconscious amongst the rubble of what was once her home. Her body was covered in ash, but as far as he could tell—she sustained no injuries from the fire. He knew she wasn't normal. That thought alone unnerved him to the core. </p><p>The wizard approached the body with a practiced caution. Assessing for any signs of movement from the girl. When he found none, he grabbed her limp wrist and apparated her to the Ministry.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, several wizards had gathered into the office of Cornelius Fudge for an abrupt meeting. All of them there to decide the fate of the young girl. They had been sitting at a standstill for several moments now. No one sure of how to proceed and it made the entire room stiff with the unreleased tension.</p><p>“Dumbledore," Cornelius said in a gruff voice, running a hand through his balding hair in frustration. "This little girl took out the entire block within a quarter-mile radius. It’s going to take weeks, maybe even months to repair the damage she’s caused." </p><p>"I am aware of that fact, Cornelius," Dumbledore said calmly while looking to the aforementioned man.</p><p>"Why on earth are you so calm about this!? She murdered dozens of people and injured hundreds. You know that many are going to wonder who or what caused it." Dumbledore didn't speak and instead deemed a slight nod in reply. "Now, over half of the Ministry’s wizards have to go to all the families as well as the authorities and come up with a plausible reason for what happened. Or the alternative would be to erase their memory of the incident entirely. Neither of which is an easy task. Either decision will result in mounds of paperwork for Ministry!"</p><p>"Not to mention she broke several rules and she's an underaged witch!" Lucius Malfoy said in absolute distaste. "We don't tolerate that type of rule-breaking behavior here. Not now—not ever. She deserves to be in Azkaban or executed."</p><p>"But she's only a child! It was an accident!" Minerva McGonagall finally spoke up. Completely baffled by his cruel disregard for the girl.</p><p>"She is a (L/N)! You know what they did all those years ago and yet, you still defend her!?" Lucius said while sending an accusatory finger in Minerva's direction.</p><p>"She should not be held responsible for the sins of her parents!" Minerva shot back in annoyance. </p><p>"Maybe so, but she is proving to be just as dangerous, if not more than they ever were." </p><p>"Enough!" Cornelius interrupted both of them and then sighed deeply. "Dumbledore, I know you've been planning something. Would you mind presenting your solution with the rest of us before we tear each other's heads off?"</p><p>"We can take her," Dumbledore answered simply and the room went into utter pandemonium.</p><p>"Have you gone mad!?" Albert Runcorn said in outburst.</p><p>"And risk something like this happening again!?" Rufus Scrimgeour added with equal fervor.</p><p>Dumbledore held up a hand to silence them and they all reluctantly quieted down. "We can show her how to hone her powers—to use them in a more beneficial way. We will, of course, take all the necessary precautions to keep her from hurting anyone else. At least this way, wouldn't have to be inhumane by sentencing a child to death." At that, Dumbledore glanced at Lucius and the pale-haired man glared in return at the wizard. </p><p>"Hmm," Cornelius rubbed his chin in thought. Going over all the alternative options and finding none. "I suppose you have a point."</p><p>"What!?" Lucius snarled, his brows furrowing in anger. "This won't solve anything. You're just prolonging the inevitable."</p><p>"Perhaps," Cornelius said in reply while absently rubbing the side of his head, trying to assuage an oncoming headache. "But, there is also the possibility that nothing will go wrong. I couldn't live with myself if we sent an innocent child to her death."</p><p>"She is anything but innocent—"</p><p>"Enough, Malfoy! I have made my decision. We will vote.” Cornelius didn’t stagger at the death-glare Lucius shot at him. “Although, you might still get your wish if enough people vote against Dumbledore's proposition. Now, all those in favor—"</p><p>Dumbledore, Minerva, and Kingsley all raised their hands in turn. "All those against, please raise your hand." Lucius' hand shot up almost immediately, followed by Rufus and then Albert. That left the deciding vote in Cornelius' hands and he hoped he wouldn’t regret this decision. "I vote for."</p><p>"This is completely outrageous!" Lucius spoke vehemently. "I can't have her attend the same school as my son!"</p><p>"Not to worry, Lucius. I have an idea." Cornelius then turned to Dumbledore. "I want you to perform the memory erasing charm on the girl. She must not remember anything about the events that have occurred these past several hours. In addition, I want you to place a binding spell on her magic to prevent anything like this from happening again. Those are my conditions for her to attend Hogwarts."</p><p>"As you wish." Dumbledore nodded in reply.</p><p>"Good. This meeting is now adjourned."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>"Dumbledore," Minerva said while looking to the wizard in question. "Are you sure we should do this?"</p><p>"Minerva, this girl has been through hell," Dumbledore said frowning and glanced down at the girl that sat strapped to the chair; looking at the many scars that littered her body. "She's been abused for years. It would be a mercy to erase that part of her past as well as what she did." </p><p>"I agree, Dumbledore. But we must take into account the gaps in her memory that choice would create. Not to mention it could take hours to do.</p><p>"I'm well aware. The less she remembers—the better, I think." Dumbledore looked at her questioned gaze and added in an attempt to persuade her. "Would her parents have wanted this?"</p><p>"No—no, they would not." Minerva took a deep breath and closed her eyes, trying to assuage the sorrow that suddenly settled in her heart. </p><p>"It's for the best, Minerva."</p><p>"I know, but it doesn't make it any easier to see her daughter like this."</p><p>Dumbledore drew his lips in a thin line, silently agreeing with her. He waited a moment before looking up to Minerva. With her nod of consent, he lifted his wand and started the grueling process of eradicating the little girl's memories for good.</p>
