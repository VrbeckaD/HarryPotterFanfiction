    <p>Soulmates.  Such a beautiful, immutable concept.  Ties of invisible red thread knotting and binding two people together for eternity.  Never broken and never to end.  A legacy granted to humanity and all other races.  Soulmates; something so transcendent and interwoven with fate is the most magnificent and imperfect notion.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Harry Potter, the Chosen One and the Boy who lived once enquired to his Aunt Petunia about soulmates.  Fascinated emerald eyes glittered, observing people stride by with ebony markings gracefully crawling up their limbs and winding viciously around their hearts.  Flawless names or initials carved neatly into flesh. </p><p>She responded that soulmates were a timeless link between two people; that someone would recive a blurry marking when young and enhancing any emotion towards a soulmate would cause their mark to grow.  Little Harry Potter checked his skin daily, just yearning for the sight of telltale ink that would tether him to someone forever.</p><p>While growing up, and besides not having a soulmate, Harry also discerned that he was different.  Not his looks, but getting implicated in peculiar occurrences.  Often, snakes whispered to him in the garden under the blistering sunlight, murmuring about mice and other amazing delicacies.  When replying, it startled them while then starting to chatter excitedly about a speaker and mythical paradises.  Once when Dudley had been Harry hunting, a pipe from above fell and knocked him out; a shortcoming in the pipe workings found as the subject. </p><p>An accident.  Another occasion was when sprinting Dudley’s band and suddenly emerging onto the roof with no resolution.</p><p>Aunt Petunia labeled these “coincidences” as freakish and abberant. Thus the family claimed him as one.  Hating the label, but full-heartedly agreeing as such coincidences didn’t just develop.  These coincidences happened when Harry desired something.  Harry realized he was extraordinary, and he not only cherished it, but he thrived knowing he was someone.</p><p>Taking short strides out Diagon Alley was surreal with his school items, and a beautiful Holly wand connecting him to a wizard so terrible that none spoke his name.  Wonder had filled Harry as he eventually caught sight of the wizarding world for the first time.  A striking adventure with hundreds of witches and wizards, fascinating little shops, and an overflowing goblin bank of gold.</p><p>Carried with him was also the knowledge of his family’s executioner; Harry had acknowledged that he was unique, but in defeating the Dark Lord built a pedestal of expectations to be satisfied.   Truly a regret, but Harry understood and struggled to refute he would never truly belong. </p><p>That absence of belonging was highlighted with the fact that his lifeblood surging through his veins was smoldering.</p><p>Assembling at a table draped in gold and red while surrounded by clamoring witches and wizards, Harry had never felt so alone in his life.  Lobbed his way were questions, and while wearing a tight smile, he answered them dutifully.  Although encountering others on the train, Harry had no inclination to befriend them but maintained harmonious relations.  He had no connection with any and likewise had no wish to prove himself to others.  </p><p>Professor Dumbledore wearing his obnoxious robes was eccentric, and perhaps a bit more than senile, obviously showing off the restricted third-floor corridor, just enticing students to explore it.  Professor Snape with his hooked nose and incredibly unpleasant glare leveled squarely at Harry.   However, locking eyes with the timid Professor Quirrell was unusual as the lightning bolt sliced across his forehead throbbed.</p><p>Overcome by the abundant magic and child-like thrill of being at Hogwarts, joy flitted through his veins, like a bird first encountering freedom.  Dragging himself from his thoughts and his excitement, Harry gazed above to the starry sky and drowned himself in the endless babble.</p><p>Christmas break was a remarkable and painful affair in corresponding measures. The Gryffindor tower was uninhabited save few older students.  Harry was content with the precious opportunity to remain at Hogwarts, compared to the wretched Dursleys.</p><p>For the first time in his life, Harry received gifts.  Some recived from individuals he knew; most were from those he didn’t.  Many gifts including chocolate, a knitted sweater, and some books.  Upon receiving an invisibility cloak paired with an un-unaddressed note, Harry gently folded the family heirloom and buried it at the bottom of his trunk.</p><p>As to why had many acquaintances, but no real friends; Harry had pushed the brash Ron Weasley away from himself.  Ron had befriended Hermione Granger (the girl attacked by the troll on Halloween) and Neville Longbottom, always persuaded to partake in adventures. Although always cordial in person, Harry subtly strayed clear of the trio to avert the inevitable trouble they involved their housemates in.</p><p>Passing his classes with impressive grades with well-created essays painstakingly written in a messy scrawl because of having incompetence writing with a quill;  Harry was very content.  Being completely detached from the wizarding world, hehad taken it upon himself to do self-studying.  When he discovered the library overflowing of immeasurable tomes, he realized he needed knowledge more than a man hooked on heroin whom desired the lethal poison.  Harry devoured books like they were promptly going out of style.  Everything was so amazing, yet peculiar with much of a new society Harry had to learn.</p><p>His classes were particularly impressive.  Transfiguration was complex, however very delightful as transforming one thing to another went completely against what Harry had learned before Hogwarts.  Before magic, physics and universal laws were bent and broken.  Charms, Flying lessons, Potions, and History of Magic were his other classes.  Professor Snape despised Harry with an immense passion, so potions were quite an unpleasant experience.  History of Magic was as boring as anything could be: with Professor Bins droning on and on about goblin wars, while time dragged its feet constantly. In comparison, Flying Lesson were extemly eventful; and although Harry didn’t have an interest in being flying, the sensations of being weightless and the air hitting his face were utterly exhilarating.</p><p>Hogwarts herself was tranquil.  Snow fell gracefully outside in the frigid air, while the fires smoldered in the numerous fireplaces.  Blooming to memory came the eternal and ever-beautiful Mirror of Erised.  From the depths of his heart, the desire to be with someone forever was elucidated on the mirror; a shadow standing beside Harry, arms wrapped securely around him, painting an ageless picture.  To escape sinking further into the alluring dreams of having his non-existent soulmate, Harry flung himself into the library, reading many books on the various aspects of the Wizarding World until break ended.  After all, beautiful lies are just as excruciating as painful revelations.</p><p>Emerald and silver tapestries emblazoned with serpents transformed into crimson and gold ones, whose lions sewn into the fabric roared with pride.  Joyful cheers burst from the Gryffindor table, their blasting roars echoing immensely in the enormous Great Hall.</p><p>First, Slytherin had earned the cup, however, it changed last minute to Gryffindor.  Harry found this extremely odd and became wholly convinced that Dumbledore was biased to Gryffindors, clearly disliked Slytherins, and enjoyed encouraging children into dangerous situations.  Unquestionably a mad nut, that one.  </p><p>The cup passed to Gryffindor as Weasley, Granger, and the cajoled Longbottom saved some important artifact from a treacherous thief.  Weasley had gone on about his adventures; dancing perilously with death around carnivorous plants, massive multi-headed monsters, and horrifyingly fatal poisons.  Granger, although more reserved about her escapades, acted very cocky with her nose in the air, radiating pride fullness in coming unscathed from danger.  Longbottom was like normal, so a nice reprieve from the alternative two prideful members of the trio.  </p><p>In Harry’s viewpoint, such prideful behavior was coarse and redundant, as the act of stopping a criminal didn’t demand such turmoil.  A notable accomplishment, yes, however very dubious that the professors couldn’t stop the thief.  Very corrupt school indeed, but Harry put that all aside as he loved Hogwarts as it was.  Hogwarts was his home, and he wouldn’t let anyone take him away.</p><p>Another development was the absent Professor Quirrell.  Allegedly, he had an emergency to deal with however, most didn’t believe this and constructed some remarkable conspiracies.  Although unknowing what to think of the timid professor, Harry instinctively knew he had some connection with Quirrell; his scar burning evermore and his blood forever-spiraling within his veins.  Truly a pity Harry couldn’t ask Quirrell, whom he had some connection with.</p><p>Stirring the food on his plate with abandon, Harry’s mind sunk with discontent as he would have to go back to his relative’s house.  They called him a freak, which he abhorred with every smidgen of his being.  To have to leave this magnificent place of magic, to go to another place of the complete opposite, was misery.  </p><p>Previously, Harry had begged Professor Dumbledore if he could reside at Hogwarts over the summer, but was promptly rejected with a somewhat worried expression on his face.  It stung that he couldn’t remain at Hogwarts because she was home to him, and there was no reason Harry couldn’t stay over the summer vacation.  </p><p>Dreading to leave for Surrey, numbness overcame his frame as he stared at the gloomy sky above, mourning the loss of magic for the summer.</p>
