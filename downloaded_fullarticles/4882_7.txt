    <p>     The motorcycle roared as Sirius pulled away from the ghastly scene at Godric’s Hollow. A whimper sounded from the car seat Sirius had magically secured to to the back of his flying motorcycle.<br/>
     “It’s going to be all right, Harry,” he said over his shoulder. “I’ve got you now.” He dragged a hand down his face, steering the motorcycle one handed through the quiet night air. </p><p>     “You did what?” Remus asked again, incredulous.<br/>
     “Well, I was going to kill Peter…” Sirius began before Remus stopped him.<br/>
     “I got that part, and a damn fool decision it was too!”<br/>
     “But James… And Lily… He, he…” Sirius broke down, not even able to finish the sentence. Remus sighed.<br/>
     “Sirius, how are we going to take care of a baby? It’s not like we can ask my mum, or your mum…”<br/>
     “Hell no!” Sirius growled.<br/>
     “And James and Lily’s parents are both gone, and her sister…”<br/>
     “We’re not letting that snooty, magic-hating muggle raise my godson!”<br/>
     “What about your cousin Andromeda?”<br/>
     “Andromeda might help us out,” Sirius agreed. Both men jumped when an owl tapped on their window. Remus stood to open the window while Sirius clutched baby Harry even closer to his chest.<br/>
     “It’s from Dumbledore,” Remus said,     “Addressed to you.” Sirius grimaced.<br/>
     “At least it’s not a Howler,” he said. Remus poked his shoulder.<br/>
     “Even if it’s not going to explode, you should still open it.” Sirius broke the wax seal and began reading the letter out loud. </p><p>      Sirius (and Remus, as I’m sure the two of you are together),<br/>
It has come to my attention that you have taken James and Lily’s son. It is the decision of the Order that Harry be placed with his Muggle aunt and uncle. That will keep him out of harm’s way, and away from any Death Eaters who might be looking for him. Please meet us at Number 4 Privet Drive to deliver the child to his relatives. This decision has been made for the safety of all involved.<br/>
     Dumbledore<br/>
<br/>
     “There’s no way,” Sirius growled. “I’m his godfather. They specifically said… James and Lily said… If… If anything… Happened… If anything… Went wrong… We have to take care of him, Remus! We promised! I can’t, I can’t, I can’t break my last promise to James!” His voice hitched, and Sirius blinked furiously to hold the tears at bay. The baby whimpered in Sirius’ arms, immediately drawing his attention.<br/>
      “It’s all right,” Sirius cooed. “Uncle Sirius’ got you, it’s going to be all right. We’ll take care of you. Shhh, shh,” he hummed, rocking the child back and forth in his arms. It would be adorable if the situation weren’t so heart breaking, Remus thought. The owl fluttered impatiently by the window, waiting for a response. Remus grabbed a scrap of parchment and scribbled a reply.<br/>
     “What did you say?” Sirius asked, looking up.<br/>
     “No,” Remus answered. “There’ll be hell to pay for this, you know.”<br/>
     “Of course there will. We’re going against Dumbledore’s express wishes, after all. How do we keep Harry with us?”<br/>
     “Are you up to ten years of dodging Dumbldore, and whoever else in the Order agrees with him?” Remus asked. Sirius ran a hand over his face, still rocking Harry with one arm.<br/>
     “We’ve pulled off a lot of mischief, Remus, but do you think we can actually do this?” Sirius asked. All of his normal swagger and bravado was gone. They’d always known the risks, but the now-orphaned child of their best friends brought reality crashing down more than anything else had. It wasn’t just about them anymore. Sirius had never really cared if he lived or dies, but now… Now that wasn’t an option. He had to take care of Harry.<br/>
     “How long do you think we have before Dumbledore comes after us to make me ‘see reason’?” Sirius asked.<br/>
     “About as long as it takes that owl to reach him,” Remus said.<br/>
     “So he can choose to believe I’ll cooperate up to that point,” Sirius muttered. “Send an owl to my cousin Andromeda. Our communications should be safe for the moment. The Death Eaters should be in disarray with the death of You-Know-Who. And Dumbldore doesn’t know we’re not going to cooperate yet. Help me pack?” Sirius asked.<br/>
      “I’ve already started,” Remus said, brining out a half-full suitcase with a flick of his wand. “Whatever happened tonight, I knew we wouldn’t be staying here.” He looked sadly around the little flat.<br/>
     “We?” Sirius asked.<br/>
     “Don’t be daft. Of course I’m coming. We’re all that’s left of the Mauraders.” He drew a shuddering breath, trying not to focus on the absolute tragedy and betrayal that tore their group apart.<br/>
     “Are we waiting for a response from Andromeda or just going?” Sirius asked.<br/>
     “I, er, essentially just told her we were on our way and needed a place to crash. No details about Harry, or James and Lily… Though she’s probably heard something by this point,” Remus said.                      "You know the news is going to spread like wildfire.”<br/>
     “Do I risk taking the bike? Can you put a car seat on a broom?” Sirius muttered.<br/>
      "Sirius Black, we are not attempting to magic a car seat to a broom. You made it here on the bike, so at least we know that works. I’ll take the bags on my broom. That way if the sticking charm doesn’t hold it’s just the luggage we’re losing.”<br/>
     “You always were the most sensible, Mooney.”<br/>
     “It just seems that way because I actually think before I act,” Remus retorted. “Pack what you need. It’s probably not wise to stay here for too long.” Sirius sighed as he pointed his wand at the closet.<br/>
     “You’re right, as always.”</p><p>     Andromeda was waiting for them.<br/>
     “I didn’t bother to owl you back, I didn’t think you’d be waiting for a response.”<br/>
     “Well, you were right,” Sirius said, muttering a spell to release the car seat and sliding it over his arm. Andromeda ushered them inside.<br/>
     “We should talk, but not until we get inside.” She cast an uneasy eye around the quiet neighborhood. She locked the door, tapping the knob with her wand to activate the protection spells.<br/>
     “Tea?” She asked. Remus and Sirius shook their heads, but Andromeda ignored them. “No, you need tea. It’s good for the soul. Dora! It is so far past your bedtime! Upstairs, now!” A small exasperated sigh and footsteps disappeared up the back stairs.<br/>
     “Nymphandora,” Andromeda said by way of explanation. “Her curiosity might be the end of my sanity,” Andromeda chuckled. She herded the exhausted boys into the living room, pushing a mug of tea into Sirius’ hand as she pried the car seat holding the miraculously still-sleeping Harry away from him.<br/>
     “Now, talk to me. The rumors and owls are already flying, but I want to know straight from you what happened.” Sirius clutched his mug as if it would give him the strength to tell the story.<br/>
     “I… I was supposed to be James and Lily’s secret keeper,” Sirius paused, and Remus put a hand on his shoulder, offering strength. “At the last moment, I convinced them… I convinced them… To change to Peter. I thought… I thought they would be safer, with him. But he betrayed them! He, he, he,” Sirius choked back his sobs. “He betrayed them to Voldemort. I… I went to Godric’s Hollow to kill him. But he wasn’t there. But Harry was. And alive! And, and I couldn’t do anything for… For James and Lily, but I couldn’t leave my godson! They trusted me! How could I let them down again?” The tears ran unchecked, but Sirius pressed on. “So I took him. Then we get an owl from Dumbledore, and he wants to give Harry to Lily’s awful Muggle sister! You should hear Lily talk about her! I can’t, I can’t let that happen to Harry. I can’t… I can’t let them down again,” Sirius whispered.<br/>
     Andromeda didn’t say anything for a long moment, while Sirius tried to calm himself down.<br/>
     “So you’re running from Death Eaters and from the Order?” Andromeda asked.<br/>
     “Essentially,” Remus grimaced. “But how can we go against our friends’ last wishes?” Andromeda studied the boys, so young, yet trying so hard to do the right thing.<br/>
     “You can stay for now. I’ll put out some feelers, see how badly Dumbledore wants Harry with his aunt, and why. But while you stay in my house, you are safe. Now, to bed, both of you.”<br/>
     “But I need to take care of Harry…” Sirius protested.<br/>
     “Do you trust me, Sirius? I’ll take care of Harry for tonight. You’ll thank me later, a toddler is no easy task. Let me take care of all of you for tonight,” she said softly. Too tired to argue any further, Sirius just nodded. Andromeda led the nearly asleep-on-their-feet boys upstairs and settled them in her guest rooms. For Harry, she set up Nymphandora’s old bassinet in her room. Just for tonight. Sirius would want Harry in his room tomorrow, she was sure. Now, she had several owls to send. </p>
