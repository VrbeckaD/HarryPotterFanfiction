    <p>Hermione stormed through the door to the meeting room and tossed a thick envelope onto the table, skewing the papers underneath. Moody, the lone occupant of the room, looked up at her with slight indignation. She merely raised her eyebrows before he sighed and reached for it. That was one of the few advantages of this seemingly endless war. There was hardly a need for words when they knew each other well enough that a shake of the head or a furrow of brows could tell them all they needed to know. It was quicker, and in times like these speed was of the utmost importance. Some days it seemed speaking wasn’t necessary at all.</p><p>She waited patiently for him to read the letter through twice. That was the thing about Moody, given no strict time restraints he liked to be thorough. Which meant he needed to go through everything more than once. So to occupy her time, she perused through the papers on the table she did not recognize. Free time was not a luxury anymore. She couldn’t waste any second sitting there and waiting. There was always something to be done.</p><p>“Well?” she asked without looking up from the strategy document. She knew by his shifting that he was ready to discuss.</p><p>“Another Death Eater spy could come in handy. Snape has always been reliable, but who knows what else we could learn, especially since we know this one sees the frontlines of battle frequently.”</p><p>“It’s a lead worth looking into, at least.” she agreed, flipping the page. “But what if it’s a trap?”</p><p>Silence. She knew better than to repeat herself.</p><p>“Always a risk, but a risk worth taking at this point. I assume you agree, or else the letter would never have made it to the table.”</p><p>Finished reading through the document, she picked up a quill and began to make her edits. Ron was an amazing strategist, but sometimes he had difficulty working with their new battle set up. It was something they would need to discuss at the meeting tomorrow.</p><p>“You want to go.” It wasn’t a question. Maybe they knew each other too well.</p><p>“Considering the Death Eater, I am clearly the best option.” She laid the quill down, folding her arms across her chest as she looked to his eyes.</p><p>Moody shook his head. “You are unbinded.”</p><p>“As are you.”</p><p>“As someone who was never bound, my strength has been unaffected. Unlike you, who has recently lost their partner to the killing curse and is therefore weaker than she was before the binding.”</p><p>Hermione took a slow breath in order to reel in her anger. If she wanted to do this then she needed to keep a level head. </p><p>“I am one of the Order’s strongest duelists.”</p><p>“You were, and then your partner died and now you are asking to be put into a dangerous position knowing you are vulnerable.”</p><p>“Perhaps you’d rather send Ron,” she snapped. “Or maybe Pansy? I’m sure he wouldn’t think that was a trap.”</p><p>“You know very well how important it is that we keep the Slytherin members protected and out of risk as much as possible.” Moody stood then, hands on the table.</p><p>“Exactly my point. And seeing as Harry is too valuable, that puts his partner out as well. Who’s left now that you think could salvage this chance?”</p><p>Moody merely shook his head. “We’ll bring this to the meeting tomorrow.”</p><p>Hermione let out a huff of breath and stood, heading towards the door. She knew a dismissal when she heard it, and she was taking the tabling of this discussion as a win.</p><p>---</p><p>“Malfoy wants to become a double agent?” Ron’s voice climbed an octave with each word.</p><p>“It seems legitimate, he even sent us a slew of useful information to show he was serious,” Hermione tossed the envelope over to the lead strategist. “Snape was even able to verify it all.” She then turned to answer the onslaught of questions she knew would be coming.</p><p>“What if it’s a trap?” Harry asked, fiddling with his glasses nervously. </p><p>“Then we plan accordingly,” she answered, looking towards Ron, who was already in deep discussion with Kingsley and Moody about which disenchantments would work best.</p><p>“He wants to meet one on one with a high up Order member,” Hermione continued on, knowing Ron would be listening in as he planned. “Which means that anyone in this house would do. Clearly, Theo and Pansy are out, as they are thought to be dead and we can’t put them at risk for this. Harry and Luna are out for the obvious. Any Weasley would be a poor choice due to their history.” </p><p>“So who does that leave?” Ginny sat beside Harry, a protective hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“I’d like to volunteer myself.” Logically, she was the best person for this task. She knew how hard she needed to work to convince her best friend of that though. </p><p>“Hermione, you can’t.” Harry looked her in the eyes for the first time since Hannah died. Honestly, you’d think it was his partner who had perished, the way he’d been acting. But Luna sat there beside him, largely unscathed from the previous battle. Hermione tried not to feel bitter.</p><p>“Harry, I understand where all objections are coming from, really I do. But I’ve thought this through since receiving the letter yesterday, and I can’t think of anyone else that would be better suited.”</p><p>“We need to bind you first—” he began, but Hermione shook her head.</p><p>“I will not take anyone that I am less compatible with than Hannah.” </p><p>Part of her knew she was being stubborn. Hannah Abott and herself had a decent compatibility, and she had been excited to use the spell she had spent the past three years developing with the help of Luna, Harry and Snape. Nothing had prepared her, however, for the feel of actually being binded. Her magic felt whole, even though she’d never felt like anything had been missing in the first place. Their first battle together, Hermione could practically feel it sizzling beneath her skin. Never had she felt such power, never had she been so sure in the field. It was euphoric. </p><p>She tried not to remember what her death had felt like.</p><p>“If we have our A team behind me, at least at first, then there should be no reason to worry.” Hermione felt adamant about this. She knew this was her mission to take on.</p><p>Ginny tucked a piece of hair behind her ear. “And what about when Malfoy asks for a smaller audience?”</p><p>Damn Ginny. She was too smart for her own good.</p><p>“I am prepared for the consequences of that. If he kills me, then at least I am unbinded.” True, this meant she wasn't as strong, but it also meant the Order was losing a weaker link than if they sent someone who was bound.</p><p>“And if he chooses to try and capture you?” Ginny asked, chin in the air.</p><p>“I am a skilled Occlumens and have been captured and Crucio’d enough to know they will never get anything out of me.”</p><p>To this, there was only a silent nod of heads. As a Muggleborn, Dean and herself had seemed to be the focus of all Death Eater captures. This made them skilled in the art of torture and escape. Eventually, after the first few times, they became experienced enough fighters to evade. </p><p>She rubbed her index finger over the scar Bellatrix had gifted her with all those nights ago in Malfoy Manor. She refused to glamour it; refused to hide it under long sleeves. To her, it was a reminder and every glance at it only strengthened her resolve that the war could only end in one manner. After all, it wasn’t the only word she had carved on her. </p><p>“Hermione’s right,” Fred eventually broke the silence. “If Malfoy were to see any of us there, he would probably flee on sight.”</p><p>“All in favor of Hermione Granger meeting with the Death Eater turned spy?” Kingsley spoke for the first time, more apt to watch than voice his opinion unless he found it necessary.</p><p>There was a flourish as wands raised in the air and people cast their votes, after a moment a bright light shifted to form the words yes. Hermione smiled.</p><p>“The meeting is later this evening.” she said, clearing the table to make room for new parchment. “We need to make a plan.”</p><p>---</p><p>Hermione stood by what she could only assume was an abandoned cabin in the woods. It looked like at one point it had been nice, but years of no one living in it had allowed it to fall into disarray.</p><p>She didn’t need to look behind and to her right to know there was a group of her friends disenchanted, holding their wands at the ready, even though she hadn’t heard them apparate in. Something about the war made her keenly aware of other people’s presence, even if there was no reason she should know.</p><p>For this reason, she knew Malfoy would know as well.</p><p>A small pop behind and to her left sent goosebumps up her arms and she knew it was him. Order members didn’t give off such a foreboding presence. Only Dark Magic would do that. She refused to turn around and meet him halfway.</p><p>She wouldn’t be intimidated.</p><p>“Merlin, can you send the press away? If I wanted to Avada you, then I would have done that on the Hogsmeade battle a few weeks ago.”</p><p>She still refused to turn, but she made a sharp gesture with her head. She felt the presence of her safety net vanish and she relaxed a bit. Without an audience she really felt like she could work this through.</p><p>“Malfoy.”</p><p>“Granger.” </p><p>His words were clipped, but they didn’t seem to hold the malice they had back in their Hogwarts years. </p><p>Neither moved for a moment, but eventually Malfoy sighed and she heard crunching leaves under his shoes as he walked towards her.</p><p>“Always a pissing contest with you Gryffindors, isn’t it?” he bit, walking past her to stand by the stairs of the cabin. </p><p>She refused the bait. “What can you offer the Order?”</p><p>He rounded on her, a few feet away. He was taller than she remembered. Much older than she felt a 21 year old should look, though she knew the same could be said for most of the Order members. </p><p>“A spy. Clearly you need one, if the way the tides have been the past few years are any indication.” He crossed his arms and smirked. </p><p>He was confident. Or so, he wanted her to believe. She so badly wanted to snap at him and crack his fragile exterior, but something told her it wouldn’t be as easy to do as it was in their schooldays. </p><p>“While an informant could be beneficial, it’s not what we solely desire.”</p><p>Malfoy barked out a laugh. “You think you’re in a position to bargain?”</p><p>“Tell me, Malfoy, how many Death Eaters were lost in the last battle?”</p><p>His smirk dropped into an unreadable mask. She itched to see a sneer, to know she’d gotten through and made him mad, but this would have to do for now. </p><p>“Why would you choose now to switch sides?” The answer was obvious, but she needed him to know that she was the one with the power here.  </p><p>Still, he remained silent.</p><p>Hermione let a devilish smile cross her face. “Then I think we are in agreement that I, as one of the Leaders of the Order, have the power to set our terms.”</p><p>His face scrunched into one of disgust. “You can pretend all you want, but we both know how desperate you are for the information I have as a high up Death Eater.”</p><p>It seemed that he was unaware of Snape’s loyalties and she thanked the gods for that, but she couldn’t deny that he had a point there. Malfoy had been steadily climbing ranks and, as Severus had now found himself as an important brewer and caster for Voldemort, he no longer saw the frontlines like Malfoy did. Between the two of them, they would almost be able to fully put together Voldemort’s plans.</p><p>“But you’re more desperate for your life.”</p><p>Hermione, over the years, had learned the art of manipulation. Pretending to be weak had gotten her out of many captures. Acting scared and confused had allowed her to best more than one Death Eater. She quickly vowed to make this one of her skills. </p><p>Draco however, was a master himself.</p><p>“And you’d give up yours in order to save the rest of the world.”</p><p>Yes, yes she would. But they were getting off task.</p><p>“We need fighters. I assume you’re not shite at dueling?”</p><p>He scoffed. “Would you like a demonstration?”</p><p>She would, but now was not the time.</p><p>“You will continue with your Death Eater duties,” she listed, beginning to circle him slowly. “You will report to us any information.” She paused and glared. “Any.” </p><p>He gave a roll of his eyes but nodded anyways.</p><p>“In addition, you will come train with us in our hybrid program to prepare for the next battle, which you will be fighting with the Order on.”</p><p>“You’ve gone mad, have you?” Malfoy’s voice had raised and Hermione fought the urge to flinch. She had checked and this place was properly warded. No one would be able to find them.</p><p>“We’ve seen what you can do, and your ability to climb past Death Eaters who have been loyal since before you were born merely testifies to it. We need firepower like that.” </p><p>Malfoy ran his fingers through his hair. “And how do you suggest we accomplish any of this? Once I fight with the Order, the others will see it and I won’t be able to go back. You’ll have lost your spy.”</p><p>Hermione released a breath and prayed he couldn’t see the shaking of her hands.</p><p>“The next battle will be the last.” She tried to meet his eyes, but they were glued to his boots. She continued on. </p><p>“We’ll need to draw up a schedule. You’ll need to come to our location, where you’ll make an Unbreakable Vow and learn more about what our program has in store. We can discuss the rest afterwards.”</p><p>Malfoy’s brow furrowed. “Why can’t we talk about it now?”</p><p>Hermione knew he would ask that, and also knew he would be resistant to come with her without any additional information. Unfortunately, this is what the council had agreed was the extent they could mention without the Unbreakable Vow being set into place. Snape had confirmed last week that Voldemort remained ignorant to their experiment. The longer that remained true, the more of a chance they had of winning. If Malfoy refused to come, then at least she hadn’t given anything vital.</p><p>“It’s top secret. You will get nothing more from me unless you agree to apparate with me and make the Vow.”</p><p>“What if I get there and decide I don’t want to do it?”</p><p>She shrugged. “Then we’ll kill you.”</p><p>“Some light side you are,” Malfoy muttered.</p><p>She could feel her cheeks tinging with pink as her anger flared.</p><p>“This is war, Malfoy. Do you expect us to spare you simply because we’re fighting for the Light?”</p><p>He sneered. “You can walk around with the facade of being a war lord all you want, Granger.” He walked forward until he was just a few inches away. Hermione refused to step back. “But we both know this fight will kill you emotionally, even if your body still breathes.”</p><p>She wouldn’t react. Not now. He didn’t even know the half of it. “Are you coming, or not?”</p><p>He paused, before grabbing onto her outstretched arm. “Not like you’re giving me much of a choice.”</p><p>She apparated before he could change his mind.</p><p>---<br/>
They appeared right inside the door of Grimmauld Place. At first the Order wasn’t sure if it was a good idea to bring Malfoy to headquarters, but after a bit of back and forth they agreed that if they felt any suspicions, they would merely not allow him to leave. Now that he was here, he was under their mercy.</p><p>Malfoy stayed silent as they climbed never ending stairs, up until they reached the rooftop, which seemed to expand far beyond the actual set of apartments. It was enchanted to be large enough to simulate battle.</p><p>Hermione glanced around until she found Harry and Luna fighting against Lavender and Bill, spells and shields flying faster than was visible to the eye. Out of the corner of her eye she noticed Draco’s eyebrows raised. She bit back a smirk.</p><p>“Harry,” she called out their approach, lest a rogue spell come at them.</p><p>Harry stopped casting, which caught Luna’s attention and they both waved on approach. Hermione smiled at the synchronicity of the movements.</p><p>The two bid goodbye to the other bound pair and stopped to onceover Malfoy.</p><p>“You look tired,” Luna noted at Malfoy. Hermione shook her head, never quite aware of her awkwardness until there were new people around.</p><p>He nodded once in her direction. “Lovegood.” He looked at Harry. “Potter.”</p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry nodded back. </p><p>Hermione looked between the pair. “We’ll need to do the vow now, if possible. I need to get back down.”</p><p>Harry nodded and pulled out his wand as Hermione extended her hand. Malfoy hesitated.</p><p>“You won’t be babysitting me?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head. “Harry and Luna are more than capable of taking it from here.” She offered no more information, and it seemed he knew better than to ask.</p><p>His large palm encompassed hers, but Hermione stood straight and listened as the man she had thought of as an enemy swore to protect the Order, to never give away their secrets and to always fight to take down Voldemort and Death Eaters alike.</p><p>When it was over, her palm was tingling and she fought the urge to wipe it on her jumper. She glanced again at Harry and Luna, who seemed to be silently communicating. Feeling eyes on them, they looked over. She raised her eyebrow, and they both shot her a thumbs up. She nodded and left without another word.</p>
