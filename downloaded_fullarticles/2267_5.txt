  <em>Godric’s Hollow</em><br/>
<em>Summer of 1889</em>
</p><p>	It was night and a heaving rain was falling from the skies. With tremble hands, Albus knocked at the door. </p><p>	“Albus,” Gellert muttered in surprise. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>	“I think it’s pretty obvious. I’m here to see you,” Albus replied. Drops of rain covered his body. It was really cold outside and he was shivering.</p><p>	“C’mon, Albus, get in,” Gellert said and Albus walked into the house. </p><p>	“Where’s your aunt?” Albus asked.</p><p>	“She’s sleeping,” Gellert replied with a shake of his head. “C’mon, you’re wet. I’ll get you a towel and some dry…”</p><p>	“Gellert…” Albus muttered.</p><p>	Gellert looked at him confused. “Albus, what’s happening? I’m worried… What…”</p><p>	“Do you love me?” Albus asked.</p><p>	Gellert blinked in a mix of fear and surprise. “I…” his voice faltered. He developed feelings for Albus, but he never thought the other wizard would ask him something like this. “I don’ understand…”</p><p>	Albus embraced himself, his face flushing pink. His head was telling to not go after Gellert, but his heart kept telling him to go and answer the question that was buzzing through his head. “You understood me very well, Gellert,” he said in frustration. “I want to know if you love me… I saw it in your eyes, but I need to hear it from your lips…” </p><p>	Gellert swallowed hard. He couldn’t admit his feelings for Albus. It would be too dangerous for them both. “You’re my friend; of course I do love you…”</p><p>	“I see…” Albus cleared his throat. “Sorry for coming here at this hour. It wasn’t my intention to disturb you,” he said too embarrassed to face the man in front of him.</p><p>	“You didn’t,” Gellert said quietly. “Please, let me get a towel and some dry clothes for you… It’s still raining… Please…”</p><p>	Albus reluctantly nodded. He couldn’t help, but feel like a fool. “Fine…”</p><p>	“C’mon,” Gellert said softly. “Let’s go to my room.”</p><p>	Albus followed Gellert and nodded in gratitude when the wizard gave him a towel and dry clothes. </p><p>	“I’ll give you some privacy,” Gellert said and walked out.</p><p>	Albus slowly dried himself and pulled Gellert’s clothes. He stared at his face in the mirror and wondered what the hell he was thinking. </p><p>	“Albus? Can I come in?” Gellert asked.</p><p>	“Yes,” Albus muttered.</p><p>	Gellert walked into the room and looked sympathetically at his friend. “Albus, I…”</p><p>	 “Don’t,” Albus waved his right hand. “I’m really sorry, okay? I made a mistake… It won’t happen again.”</p><p>	Gellert lowered his head and clenched his fists. “I really care about you, Albus… You don’t know how much,” he said.</p><p>	Albus walked to him and caressed his face. Again Albus could see a sparkle in his eyes. Gellert loved him, but he was afraid to say it. “So you care about me…”</p><p>	Gellert cleared his throat and looked away. “You’re really important to me, I just…”</p><p>	Being impulsive, Albus cupped Gellert’s face in his hands and pressed his lips against his mouth. When a gentle hand touched the back of his neck, Albus knew he won this battle. </p><p>“You’re mine,” Albus whispered almost unconsciously, as they finally broke the kiss.</p><p>“No,” Gellert stepped away. “He won’t like it…”</p><p>“He?” Albus’ face contorted in confusion. </p><p>Gellert swallowed hard. “I’m confused… Albus, this is a mistake…”</p><p>“Gellert, please trust me…” Albus said softly.</p><p>“Please, leave,” Gellert said, breathing heavily. “We shouldn’t see each other anymore…” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Hogwarts</em><br/>
<em>Four years later</em>
</p><p>	Albus Dumbledore stared at the Mirror of Erised and sighed. Four years had passed and he couldn’t forget Gellert. Like always he saw Gellert’s face in the mirror. The wizard was the most desperate desire of his heart.</p><p>A week after that night, Gellert left Godric’s Hollow. His aunt Bathilda explained that Gellert’s father appeared and asked him to go back home. He remembered that Bathilda had dark circles under her eyes. Gellert's aunt certainly had been crying. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>”Is Gellert okay?” He asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The witch bit her lips. “He…”</em>
</p><p>
      <em>Albus looked at her in angst. There was something wrong. “Please, tell me where they live? Maybe…”</em>
  
</p><p>
  
    <em>”No… He won’t like it…</em>
  
</p><p>  A tear streamed down Albus’ face. He was too young and his family needed him. So he just let it go. He tried to forget Gellert, but he always missed him. Today, however, he was feeling this hole in his heart.
</p><p>
  
    <em>“He won’t like it…”</em>
  
</p><p>
  The memory was now buzzing through his head. Gellert was scared. Really scared <em>of him.</em> And Albus feared that <em>him</em> was in truth Gellert’s father.
</p><p>
  Albus stared at the mirror again. Gellert was still in his heart and he would find out what happened to him.
