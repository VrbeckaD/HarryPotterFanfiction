It was just something he did every once in a while. He never thought it would get out of hand. He never thought he'd be hospitalized or have to sit through months of therapy just because one asshole couldn't take no for an answer. And had brought friends.</p><p>So what if he wanted to be held down? So what if he wanted it a little rough? Sometimes, he didn't want to have to ask for it out loud. Sometimes he needed that and it wasn't any of their fucking business. One bad night doesn't make him wrong for needing it the way he needs it.</p><p>End.</p>
