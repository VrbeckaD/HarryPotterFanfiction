    <p>The great hall is packed within a foot of the stone walls. There are students everywhere, and Albus feels a little like he’s drowning. </p><p>It‘s the first night of third year, and he just can’t seem to figure out why it’s feeling so much different than the first two. </p><p>The sorting has already been done, Dumbledore’s six or seven words already said. Scorpius is at his left and Lorcan at his right. </p><p>Nothing has changed. </p><p>And yet, it feels like something has. </p><p>They‘re talking over him about something that seems to be exciting – to them, at least. But Albus isn’t focused on their words – not really.  </p><p>He spots Lily, grinning into Rose’s robes as they embrace. He wants to smile proudly because he had known all along that she would be in ravenclaw – that she was smarter than both of her brothers combined. </p><p>He doesn’t smile though; it feels as though he can’t. </p><p>Something is clawing at the back of his throat, and his hands are clenching further and further into themselves as the seconds tick by, and it feels as though he can’t breathe anymore, and–</p><p>“Al?”</p><p>Albus snaps his eyes over and finds Scorpius staring over at him, a soft sort of look in his gaze. </p><p>Albus feels something sticky in his palm. </p><p>“Al, is everything alright?” </p><p>He chances a quick look – he glances down and feels lightheaded.</p><p>He hears three people yell about the Holyhead Harpies game the week before but he thinks that it might be best to ignore them. </p><p>His hands are bleeding. </p><p>“Albus?”</p><p>They’re bleeding badly. </p><p>“Yes. . .yes, everything’s fine,” Albus clarifies – quickly, before the interval of time has started to make Scorpius suspicious. </p><p>But Scorpius already does look suspicious, and it makes Albus feel more uneasy than he already does. </p><p>“Albus–“</p><p>“I’m going to head up, alright?”</p><p>A shadow of concern sweeps over Scorpius’s face, and without warning, he reaches out a hand to press gently against Albus’s forehead. </p><p>He shivers under the coolness of Scorpius’s hand. </p><p>“Are you ill?” </p><p>Albus is quick to shake his head, so Scorpius drops his hand. </p><p>Albus, for reasons he doesn’t want to confront, finds himself missing the contact. </p><p>“No, no, it’s only a headache.” </p><p>Albus glances around himself, then back to Scorpius. He wonders how he is going to be able to get out of the packed room. </p><p>Scorpius’s eyes are worried, he notices, – so dreadfully worried.</p><p>So Albus clarifies again, voice holding the finality that it had apparently been lacking before, “I’m alright. Really, I am. I–I’ll see you later on.”</p><p>It was the first time he had ever gone to bed with crescents dug into his palms.</p>
