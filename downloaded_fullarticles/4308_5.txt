  <span>Draco grabbed at the front of Harry’s robes and shook him rough enough to make the healer beside the bed glare at him and tut disapprovingly, to which Draco paid no heed at all, riding high on fury. ‘Alone?’ was all Draco said, but it was more than enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry gringed and gasped at the rough handling, but he knew Draco well enough to not placate him with empty words, and he knew well enough that he had no-one to blame but himself for his current predicament. ‘I’m sorry, Draco.’ Harry looked at the healer by his bedside and she shuffled off, maybe convinced that Draco might not kill his fiancé if she gave them some privacy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco slumped down onto the chair beside Harry’s hospital bed and put his head in his hands, his voice was small when he spoke next, after a few minutes. ‘I can’t do this anymore…’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry reached out to touch him with a painful effort; he was more interested in lucidity than being completely painless, especially when he had realized, upon waking up, how very angry Draco would be with him and with good reason. ‘Draco…’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco shook his hand from his shoulder with a snarl and pierced Harry with the look that had the power to both arouse and cow him, depending on the situation. ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>I can’t</span>
  </em>
  <span>. You have to promise me right now that I won’t have to get another bloody owl telling me you’ve been hurt because you </span>
  <em>
    <span>went off alone! </span>
  </em>
  <span>You don’t need to do it alone anymore, this isn’t the War. I’m not entirely sure I want to be home after the next time this happens, if it does happen.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stared at one another and Harry would have read all of Draco’s worry and anxiety from his cracking composure even had he not heard the words. ‘I promise,’ Harry told him, reaching out and smiling as Draco deigned him to take hold of his hand, and this time, Harry intended to keep his promise, for the potential of losing a suspect because he couldn’t go after them alone was of less import to him than losing Draco because he had a hero complex.</span>
