    <p>It's painful, is the only thing Severus can really think or comprehend. His hands tears into something soft and thin and pliant, and his heart (you don't have that anymore) wrenches terribly, his eyes flying open (how does he have them, he wonders) and he lurches upright.<br/> <br/> Thing is, Severus doesn't <em>r</em><em>emember </em>having a body to lurch upright in. Not right now when his thoughts are only of pitch blacks and gradients and monochromes, of a long, empty hallway that's turned into a wide open field in the park, with swing sets and an enormous old oak tree, all of it bleached of color but like with  <em> negative </em>  bleach, some sort of thing that eats away at both light and color until it's nothing but vague outlines and staggering shadows. He remembers staggering down these not-paths with swimming vision and a hand clutched to his neck. How he'd taken his hand away and had seen the only color left in the world smeared across his fingers, the violent, acidic emerald green he associated with ambition and cunning and the very fiber of his character.  <br/> <br/> Oh, yes, he regretted what he'd done, but he  <em> was </em>  a Slytherin to the end, a cunning, ambitious snake, but a snake who wanted nothing but to right the world and his own wrongs. When Albus said, "sometimes I think we sort too soon,” it was like a blow to the face. Like Albus Dumbledore truly believed that all Slytherin's were evil. Severus had been their head of house long enough (had been <em>o</em><em>ne of them </em>long enough) to know that that was completely false. You don't have to be a Gryffindor to be brave. <br/> <br/> Slytherin wasn't a word pertaining to fairy tale villainy or real-life horrors--It was a childish thing to think that at all. No, the only  <em> real </em>  evil in the world were those who killed without care or compassion or any sensations in their empty heads and chest cavities, the ones with red eyes and sharp teeth and high voices. <br/> <br/> Even Grindelwald had loved, if his inkling as to Albus' past was anything to go by.  <br/> <br/> Not Voldemort. <br/> <br/> He still feels a terrible, awful pain in his neck and his forearm, unable to draw breath because he's still there, isn't he? Walking those lonely halls and pathways and always just close enough to the only safe place in the world to  <em> almost  </em> touch it, and how he longed with all his aching, dead-and-rotting heart to step over the threshold of reality into that evergreen field that's lovingly dubbed  <em> our spot </em>  in his memory and say  <em> I'm sorry, I'm so </em><b><em>so</em> </b> <em> sorry, I'm so very </em> <b> <em>sorry</em></b><em>, (he wails, brays, crows) </em> but the world is not fair, and it is not kind, and he does not expect anything less than to always be one step out of reach of such a commodity. <br/> <br/> But why does he have a <em>body </em> ? He'd left that behind so long ago, with gentle hands on his face and Lily's green eyes boring into his from her sons face. <br/> <br/> He doesn't know how long he'd wandered the streets of purgatory bleeding emerald green blood and dripping it behind him before someone had stood before him and told him in a coaxing, dangerously sweet whisper,  <em> A moment, Severus. </em> <br/> <br/> It is Lily, but drained of color and light just like everything else. He wants to scream and kick and sob and curse because  <em> hadn't he done enough </em> ? He'd sacrificed his life and his sanity to try and save as many as he could, to strike the red from his ledger.  <br/> <br/> If this hell is any indication, he'd failed. And suddenly he feels no overwhelming, white hot compulsion to  <em> move, keep moving, never stop,  </em> and he slumps to his knees with a distressed cry which echoes disorientingly through this forgotten wasteland.  <br/> <br/> "You aren't her." Severus snarls, lurching from his knees --and this world may or may not be real, this may be his punishment, his hell, and he  <em> deserves it </em> , he does, but it's  <em> his </em>  hell and  <em> he will not </em><b><em>stand</em> </b><em>for them distorting </em><b><em>her</em> </b><em>image </em> -- and his wand is in his hand, another glimmer of color because it's not <em>his</em>, it curls around itself in a sickly, ramrod straight spiral and the handle has tarnished silver wrapped around it. It hums in his hand like his own never had, and he feels <em>power</em>, sharp and terrible and  <em> exhilarating,  </em> more of his green life essence flooding from the chunk Nagini had torn from his neck, and hexes her with something bizarre that he hadn't known existed, and she sways and laughs. <br/> <br/> "Such spirit, such <em>fire </em>in a man of ice and secrets." She hisses with Lily's lips, Lily's lungs, Lily's  <em> air </em> , but not her  <em> voice </em> .  <br/> <br/> It's not a language he's ever spoken, but he hears it and understands it as clearly as English, doesn't even realize it isn't, it's  <em> ancient </em> , hissing and melodious like some haunting, demented song. He speaks it back. <br/> <br/> "Stop wearing her face, you miserable <em>wretch </em> --" his voice sounds like honeyed liquor and velvet, and this unfamiliar language fits in his mind and his soul like no other he's ever spoken.  <br/> <br/> "I thought it would put you at ease. Certainly, you aren't a simpering, death-fearing sow like the rest of your kin. Impressive." She purrs the last word, and warps into something looming and otherworldly, a thin, skeletal outline shrouded in mist and black fabric.  <br/> <br/> Severus has spent so long in hell (he'd never left or entered it, it's been his life and his death, from the moment he'd been born and his father had kept the beatings coming, from the moment four schoolboys had picked up where Tobias left off, from the moment he came home to his mother with a shattered beer bottle sticking out of her face, from the moment he'd rocked Lily's lifeless body in his arms) and death is <em>welcome </em>in his existence. It's always been there. It's a comforting constant in his twisted heart of hearts. <br/> <br/> He does not simper and cower, he does not curl into a fetal position and beg for mercy like he knows <em>damn well </em>Voldemort will do or has done, and a million billion  <em> trillion  </em> before him since the dawn of time both animal and human no doubt has. He does not flinch and does not flee; he stands with his strange wand and his vivid green blood oozing from his wound and he <em>stands his ground. </em>He is not a coward anymore. He never will be again. <br/> <br/> Death meets his unwavering black eyes and sets its feet on the not-ground. Severus' robes, the same cut and style as in his life (sharp and simple, showing off his scrawny, young form while lending him imposing lines and ridges) but made out of the same shimmering not-fabric as Death's, whip in the wind as they stare one another down unwaveringly, not hostile or amiable. <br/> <br/> Then death starts to laugh. It's a chilling, melodic thing that freezes the green blood in Severus' not-veins quite literally, stopping his bleeding in its tracks. It cackles until Severus is thoroughly unnerved, and yet he still watches the thing expectantly. <br/> <br/> "<em>What? </em> " He spits, and green flies from his lips where it had gurgled up his throat.  <br/> <br/> "It's just so <em>delightful </em>that the one man in this petty war who wished to die is the one I must choose to live again." Death purrs, as death is always, <em>always </em>delighted by ironies. <br/> <br/> There are few people who truly wish to die. Oh, there are people who <em>think </em>they do, and who later regret it as they face death, mewling and whining pathetically in the face of their own mortality, rebuking their foolish notion that Death was black, blissful nothingness.  <br/> <br/> Severus Snape is one of the few men to prove to death that there  <em> are  </em> always people who do not fear death in its tried and true form.  <br/> <br/> "You know," Death rumbles, it's echoing three tone voice reverberating in Severus' chest, "there were once four people of magic who came to me, and each and every one of them was like you. Content and unwavering in their strengths and beliefs, strong enough to summon their wands in the face of death itself no matter whether their fate was white or black, and who stared me down as you do now. They refused my offer to go back, to fix things I asked them to fix. They still do, at every turn. But they died old, and regretless, and do not yearn for knowledge and the strength to protect the long dead as you do. You are the youngest to manifest your magic in this place. The youngest to bleed a color other than black or white." Death tells him, smiling a skulls smile. <br/> <br/> Severus watches it with fervent, unwavering willpower.  <br/> <br/> "And what is it you ask them for?" Severus says surely and easily in this foreign, haunting tongue. "What is it you seek from them, and from me?" <br/> <br/> Always ambitious, always cunning, and always, always willing to find any chance to undo his wrong doings, even in death. <br/> <br/> <em> The strength to protect the long dead </em> <br/> <br/> "Tom Marvolo Riddle has stolen time from me. Others have, in the past. But these you would not be able to find, these, you would not be able to recover my time from. Riddle, you can. Even if he does die, he dies too late and he upsets the balance. What I seek from you is to make certain that Tom Marvolo Riddle dies when he should, on the very same day that you turn 31. And in return, I will give you what you wish for most." Severus sneers, knowing a trap when he hears one. It's like genies and Faeries--what you wish most is never <em>actually </em>what you want. <br/> <br/> "Understandable of you to doubt me, Severus Snape. No, what you truly wish I already  <em> know </em>  of. You will not need to tell me, and fret over wording and loopholes. I will simply <em>show you, </em>and let you decide for yourself." <br/> <br/> "And what's the catch? I <em>want</em> to defeat Voldemort. There's always a price to these things." <br/> <br/> "The price? Your peace of mind. The price is that you will <em>always remember </em>that other life of yours. You will <em>always </em>remember these yawning eons in which you limped and staggered through the walkways of the afterlife, bleeding and in agony. In return, I will grant you full access to your abilities which not even Albus Dumbledore had seen. Wizards are never able to reach their full potential, to access their entire range of talent. You would have it. You would outpace Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, Voldemort and Grindelwald and all those other petty figures. You have the will, the strength and the heart and the wisdom to stand with the founders of Hogwarts, with Merlin and Salazar and even dear Lucinda Meredith Prince, your ancestor who still lives on my time in exchange for striking a Dark Wizard who evaded death from the history of Life. Just like you will. And you will have done me a service. Those who do this for me live cyclic lives, they are the very reason for myths of soulmates and reincarnation." <br/> <br/> "How is Voldemort’s death worth such a thing?" He asks, now sounding rather frightened. <br/> <br/> "I am a benevolent master, Severus Snape. All I will ask is that you eradicate those dark and light wizards which I direct you to. Having a loyal, semi-immortal servant who respects and trusts me is the most valuable thing death could ask for."  <br/> <br/> Severus searches its empty eye sockets, and he somehow manages to tell--whether through Legilimency or intuition--that it's telling the truth. "Is the supply so short, to in turn create such a demand?" <br/> <br/> "Most are happy to die and be dead. That is because all magic comes with sacrifice, even the light sort, and those who sacrifice the most, who are so very weighed down by death and loss and terror as you have been, sink. They are beyond courage and redemption, beyond my offers. Even though the ones who sacrificed the most are the only ones capable of carrying out my will. As I said, these people like you come once in an age. Each and every one is worth my time."  <br/> <br/> Severus swallows thickly. "You said soul mates--" he chokes on the words. He wouldn't be selfish enough to force Lily to be with him through twisted, celestial intervention.  <br/> <br/> "Lily Evans once loved you dearly. In this life, you will be wise enough to show her your love in return. She will understand you, and she will be your anchor. Without them, my servants tend to crumble."  <br/> <br/> "I..." he thinks severely, weighs the options. Death is ever patient, and it may take years or decades, but he nods abortively. "You said you'd show me." He hedges. <br/> <br/> "Indeed. But one more thing, Severus--" death pauses, finding it's words in its eerie language. Severus wonders if he'd still be fluent in it upon living again. "You may think it easier to work for the light through the side of the light, but I must warn you. Keep the timeline similar. Not the same, but similar. The dark magic your kin so reviles is simply thought of as dark due to sacrifice. Most of your power will come from said darkness. But it does not need to be used for dark things. No matter how tempting, stay with Slytherin, stay close to Hogwarts, and most of all, take the mark. The timeline will change, your memories will become untrue, and in order to defeat Voldemort you will need to be at his side, in order to know what, exactly, has changed."  <br/> <br/> "But--" <br/> <br/> "Sometimes, the world does not need a shining light. Sometimes it needs a shadow."  <br/> <br/> And Severus finds himself plunged into a different world, free of the pain in his bleeding neck and the dark monochrome. The light blinds him, and he can feel Death's bone hand on his face, and then he can see. <br/> <br/> Lily, laughing and dancing with him in an empty square, leaves fluttering around them. His hair and face are healthy, and he wears nice clothing well suited to his thin, lanky frame. Lily's taking lead, and Severus had always been delighted to let her as a child. This adult Lily seems just as delighted by the trust he places in her, no matter how frivolous the display of it is. And then, in a different frame of time, Severus stands in front of Dumbledore's desk, dark and looming and serious in comparison to the magnanimous, twinkling lightheartedness of Albus Dumbledore, and they speak like comrades and equals rather than a general and his spy, his subordinate, his student, and Severus has the same strange wand in his hand there as he does now.  <br/> <br/> Then, even later on, Severus murmuring to Lily about something embarrassing that he'd always been ashamed of in the dimness of a bedroom, a biological quirk of the Prince family that left him feeling just like Petunia's always said and Potter'd always taunted despite not liking blokes,  <em> freak, Nancy, git, disgusting little-- </em> , and then Lily taking a potion to change herself to match his bizarre, freakish biology, with some of her own because <em>I want a child, Sev, </em>followed by <em>I'm sorry, Lily, I can't give you one, not like that</em> and then-- <br/> <br/> A girl with curly black hair, a smattering of dark, earthy freckles and evergreen eyes, wide and sparkling, accompanied by a younger boy with wide black eyes and hair like a licking, curling fire.  <br/> <br/> Blurring images of friends, someone with glasses and a goofy grin, begrudgingly ruffling his not-so-greasy hair, a man with scars and skittishness ingrained into his being kissing him on the cheek just to see him shriek his name indignantly and punch him in the shoulder, a tall man with blond hair laughing and congratulating him on the announcement of a third child on the way, and he'd never wanted a big family but he knows somewhere in his heart of hearts that Lily probably would've done, and that him in the vision looks so  <em> happy,  </em> and the blond man laughs in a familiar voice and hugs him like a best mate would, and their black tattoos shows because their sleeves are shucked up and  <em> no one is looking at it </em> , and it looks so happy and domestic it makes his heart ache in longing.   <br/> <br/> He's dragged out of it, and blinks in the melancholy din that death calls its home. "What, no war, no battles?" <br/> <br/> "You know already what those look like, Severus Snape. I was simply showing you the good things you will have that you didn't before. The bad will be much the same as last time, but it will be balanced with the good."  <br/> <br/> Severus swallows thickly.  <br/> <br/> "Last time, Riddle stole more than a decade from me. This time, should you kill him on the day you're supposed to, you will become immune to my judgement in terms of stealing time." <br/> <br/> "And if I don't?"  <br/> <br/> "You will. They all do."  <br/> <br/> That's reassuring, at least. <br/> <br/> "What will your answer be, Severus Tobias Snape?" <br/> <br/> "Yes. Yes, alright." He chokes, and lurches upright again, his heart and lungs seizing and his eyes snapping open.  <br/> <br/>"Sorry, my dear. Waking nightmares, awful things." A familiar women’s voice says, and his world, for the first time in eons, plunges into the true depths of unconsciousness. </p><p>

  <strong> <strong> </strong> </strong>
</p><p>It's painful, is the only thing Severus can really think or comprehend. His hands tear into something soft and thin and pliant, and his heart (you don't have that anymore) wrenches terribly, his eyes flying open (how does he have them, he wonders) and he lurches upright. This time, it's real, it's not just a phantom feeling the edge of his awareness as it had been in Death's realm. <br/> <br/> His thin chest heaves, and when he looks down, he finds himself still lean and gangly but shorter, and he blinks hard. His hands tear at the sheets, and he tosses and kicks them to the floor without care, yanking up an unfamiliar shirtsleeve to find no dark mark. He feels dizzy, sick with lightheadedness, and sinks carefully back into the headboard lest he fall off the bed. He combs his long fingers through greasy hair and grimaces as phantom pain sears the tendons and veins of his neck. He senses the wand (deaths gift to him, one of many) sitting in the bedside drawer. <br/> <br/> "Mr. Snape! You're awake, oh, dear." Says Poppy, rushing into the room. His mind says she's a colleague, a friend, but Severus has been thrust into situations where cover is imperative by Voldemort and Albus alike, so frequently that he quickly slams down his shields and contorts his face into what it would be all those years ago (ruffling through boxes of old memories shunted to the back of his mind, he was always bored and melancholy, his father made him used to hospital visits).  <br/> <br/> She examines his face, and he feels for the first time a burning pain in three centers of feeling on it. <br/> <br/> That three toned voice rumbles in his head, for his ears only,  <em> I've given you a head start for your pluck, Severus. </em>  And Poppy's eyes well with tears as she does a standard scan with her wand. He wonders what on earth death could mean, and then she says, gently and kindly, "What do you remember, Severus?" Death has him covered. And old, outdated memory spans his peripheral, warped by the hands of his new master.  <br/> <br/> <em> Frozen in terror at the entrance to the shrieking shack, hands trembling on his wand even though he knows it's pointless, a feeble shield that claws sweep through. They catch his face and the world goes white and black and static with pain, searing, white hot agony. His throat raw from screams that he can't remember making.  </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Potters frantic  </em> Oh, god, oh, Merlin, oh fuck, what have we done, there's so much blood <em>  and jostling, being carried.  </em> <br/> <br/> And above all, rage and a sick, bubbly feeling that it isn't quite Remus' fault. He knows now, that it'd very nearly torn the marauders apart when he  <em> hadn't  </em> been physically hurt. Ice water rushes through his veins at the thought of Lupin being put to death for one of Sirius Black's stupid, reckless actions. He trembles. Werewolf scars don't heal. <br/> <br/> "Oh, dear, what's this then?" Poppy splutters, gently tugging aside his shirt collar. He can't angle his head right to look, but he can imagine.  <br/> <br/> "How bad are the ones on my face?" He rasps. Poppy's still examining what he assumes is Nagini's bite mark, however odd it is to be there, but she does accio a mirror, looking quite morose. He doesn't turn it over for a moment.  <br/> <br/> "Go on, dearie. It's not as bad as you think."  <br/> <br/> <em> Liar </em> , Severus thinks, and then swings the mirror around in his hand. Staring back at him is his own face, youthful and thin with poverty, and now three thin, jagged lines run diagonally across his face.  <br/> <br/> They aren't so bad as what he remembers Lupin having, and they don't detract from his already terrible-- <br/> <br/> "What happened to my <em>nose</em>?" He asks, bewildered as he reaches up to touch it. It's still long and aquiline, but it isn't ugly and crooked anymore, with bumps and ridges along the bridge. <br/> <br/> Poppy looks at her feet. <br/> <br/> "It had breaks that weren't set right, Mr. Snape. I took it upon myself to remove the built-up cartilage and bone that results." She's looks at him kindly. "It was the least I could do."  <br/> <br/> He sighs shakily. Eventually, he decides to take his eyes off of his face, which is still awkward and gawky--he still has watery eyes and too-plump lips and a long, beaky nose with a weak chin and a sharp jawline, but it isn't snarled and awful, and it does do a bit to make him not <em>too </em>disgusted with his face.  He glances at Poppy before tugging his collar aside, tilting the mirror so he can better examine his neck. <br/> <br/> Thin angry red lines crawl over the skin from four pockmarks like a spiderweb, and they writhe through his veins like lightning. His black eyes trace the pattern made by her venom. <br/> <br/> Its fifth year, he's fifteen, he's covered in scars, and he won't have said the <em>word </em>to Lily until the owls this year. He shudders.  <br/> <br/> "I..." he trails off, lost for words. What does a teen say to being irreparably scarred by another student?  <br/> <br/> "Albus will be in shortly to talk to you, dearie. He's wrapping things up in his office. A quarter hour." She tells him. Severus can't help but panic a bit. Why on earth would Lily love him now, scarred and ruined as he is. He nods absently, and Poppy retreats to her office. <br/> <br/> He doesn't know how long he sits staring at the wall before Albus comes in, trailing bright periwinkle robes behind him. "Mr. Snape." Albus greets solemnly. <br/> <br/> Severus knits his shields tighter, just as strong as the ones he uses with Voldemort.  <br/> <br/> And death hisses in his ear,  <em> show him. He will help you. Help us. </em> <br/> <br/> He hesitates. What the headmaster does now with decide if Severus can truly trust him.  <br/> <br/> "Headmaster." He returns, threading despondency and defeat into his voice. He knows how to manipulate Dumbledore now, just a bit. He learned from the best, after all. And what better way to slap Albus' inaction directly into his face than a blatant display miscommunication and show him how little Severus distrusts him (or did, the first time around). "Will I be expelled?" He asks, with enough resignation masterfully sunk into his tone that he sees Albus flinch from the corner of his eye.  <br/> <br/> It scares him, how well his shields are holding. Putting his anger, fear, and anxiety in the deepest recesses of his mind so that he can levelly lie to Albus Dumbledore. He's been a spy for too long. <br/> <br/> "Mr. Snape, what makes you think you would be expelled? You are the one who was attacked." There's a bit of bewilderment layered beneath the concern and sympathy of Albus' grandfather act. He expects Severus to spit and scream at him, for his pale face to go blotchy with anger. A truly fifteen-year-old Severus would. (Has). <br/> <br/> Now, Severus allows himself more of his typical caustic behavior back. He sneers, "It's never stopped you before. The four of them have made my life hell--" he chokes on his words, his eyes stinging and his throat tightening. If James Potter and his cronies hadn't taken away what little sanctuary he had, would he have turned out differently? Would he have been with Lily the first time around? It doesn't matter, because he must stick to the timeline, and he's not far enough back to prevent it anyways. "And you have done  <em> nothing </em>  about it." <br/> <br/> But Albus isn't listening, his eyes are fixed on Severus' scar. Not the ones on his face, no. The one on his neck. He tugs his collar up self-consciously. <br/> <br/> "Mr. Snape." Albus says calmly. His twinkle is gone. "You have a few options here. I cannot, and will not, expel an innocent student for being attacked. But I cannot in good conscience reveal to the Ministry Mr. Lupin's involvement. They would--" <br/> <br/> "Kill him." Severus finishes frigidly. Albus watches him, eyes hardening. <br/> <br/> "And you would want that Mr. Snape? Truly?"  <br/> <br/> Severus meets his eyes, and he knows that Dumbledore expects him to say  <em> yes </em>  but he's giving him a  <em> choice </em> . Last time, he'd assumed that Severus had wanted Lupin dead without even asking him his side of the story and would blab to the ministry at the first opportunity. Therefore, binding a traumatized fifteen-year-old boy with an unbreakable vow. He must ask, though. Must know if Albus Dumbledore truly values Lupin's life over his own.  <br/> <br/> "If my answer was yes, would you allow me to press charges?" He asks Albus. Some of the kindness leaves his face, but Severus hasn't said yes or no, and he humors him. <br/> <br/> "I would." <br/> <br/> The words are truthful, he can see it plain as day with his legilimency. Severus lets out a tremulous breath. "I do not wish to press charges on Remus Lupin for attacking me."  <br/> <br/> He continues, after a moments pause in which Albus stares at him, obviously reeling. <br/> <br/> Severus stares at his hands. "I would like to impose a magical restraining order on James Potter and Sirius Black instead." He says, and it's a  <em> compromise </em> . A good one. Magical restraining orders don't limit how close to someone you can get, like muggle ones. Instead, any spell the subject of the order sends at the one who poses it will backfire. He hadn't known they existed, back when this happened the first time. And Albus hadn't been willing to discuss much of anything, let alone compromises.  <br/> <br/> "It could take almost the entire school year to procure one of those, Mr. Snape." The headmaster says. Severus knows this.  <em> Keep the timeline similar.  </em> His worst memory will still happen, but after that the Marauders will have no choice but to back off. <br/> <br/> "I just want that on top of whatever punishment you're already going to give them, Headmaster." <br/> <br/> "Of course, Mr. Snape." <br/> <br/> "So you'll do it?" Severus asks, a little shocked despite having figured he might agree when Albus nods. <br/> <br/> He passed Severus' test. Albus Dumbledore wasn't needlessly cruel or contrary to him, he didn't give the Marauders a slap on the wrist and bind him in an unbreakable vow.  <br/> <br/> "Headmaster?" He asks, watching him curiously as Albus gazes at his scar. <br/> <br/> "What exactly made that, Mr. Snape?" <br/> <br/> Severus shrinks back, but he knows he'll need assistance with things regarding this situation. Instead, he reaches into the bedside drawer. "Mr. Snape..." his hand pauses, and he looks at Dumbledore expectantly. "I'm afraid your wand was broken in the shrieking shack." He says, obviously trying to be gentle and falling short.  <br/> <br/> Severus nods and resumes his hands motion, pulling the blackened, twisted wand from its hiding place. Unlike in deaths realm, the wand doesn't flood him with power. No, he was  <em> already  </em> flooded with it when he woke up. It's a wonder Dumbledore hadn't sensed it.  <br/> <br/> Albus stares at the wand with raised brows, and then his expression drops into something confused and wary.  <br/> <br/> "Where did you get that?" He asks sharply, with something like fear. It's sharp and acrid like Nagini's venom. Severus sighs shakily and, with trepidation, releases his mental shields. The cold, foreign feeling of someone in his head shivers its way down his spine.  <br/> <br/> <em> Such a loyal servant, Severus. But I'm afraid...you've outpaced your usefulness. </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Pain, and Lily's eyes staring at him from her sons’ face. "T-Take them."  </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Agony, Cruciatus was better, he'd take it any day.  </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Blackness. </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Green blood shimmering on his hands, soot and white ash fluttering down from the sky, a crowing, insistent voice urging him to keep moving no matter what. </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Hide them, hide them  </em> <b> <em>all</em> </b> <em> .  </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> YOU SAID YOU WOULD PROTECT HER! </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Lily and James put their faith in the wrong people, Severus. </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> What would you give me in return? </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <b> <em>Anything.</em> </b> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Lily, after all this time? </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <b> <em>Always</em> </b> <em> . </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Burning, searing pain in his forearm, in his neck, a writhing snake beneath pale skin, staring at his face and loathing himself. </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Choked by soap bubbles, spluttering, hexing the daylight out of them in return with what little willpower he has left. </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> His father screaming and throwing spittle in his face. In hospital, broken clavicle, "He fell outta a tree, stupid boy."  </em> <b> <em>Liar.</em> </b> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Rocking Lily's body in his arms and weeping, destroying Albus' office in a fit of blind, all-encompassing fury.  </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Such spirit, such  </em> fire <em>  in a man of ice and secrets. </em> <br/> <br/> <em> The power to protect the long dead. </em> <br/> <br/> <em> The vision, of children and happiness and Lily and he dancing in an empty town square. Of Lucius and he embracing over good news, dark marks dim but not gone and not forgotten and not  </em> <b>cared about </b> <em> on their arms.  </em> <em> <br/> </em> <br/> <em> His mother, severe but kind under the surface, too cowardly to leave and too weak to stay. </em> <br/> <br/> <em> It's just so delightful that the one man in this petty war who wished to die is the one I must choose to live again. </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> I just want to apologize, I'll sleep out here on the floor if I have to. Just  </em> please <em>  tell her I'm here.  </em> <br/> <br/> <em> Lily's face drained of all light and color, laughing and swaying, speaking an ancient, forgotten language in three different voices. </em> <em> <br/> </em> <br/> <em> His pants come off next, after his trousers, and everyone bellows and laughs, angry tears sliding down his upside down face, his inner thighs littered with perfectly horizontal scars that give some of the laughers pause, but he'd seen Lily, seen her stifle a giggle before she noticed them, the old silvery lines and the new pink ones. He can't cover them, or they'll see how much of a freak he really is, he can't move his hands from shielding himself. She  </em> <b> <em>laughed. </em> </b> <em> He doesn't need rescuing from someone who  </em> <b> <em>laughed</em> </b> <em> .  </em> <em> <br/> </em> <br/> <em> He can help you, show him, tell him, he can help you-- </em> <br/> <br/> <b>Mudblood!</b> <br/> <br/> <b>Snivellous! </b> <br/> <br/> <em> A portrait in the headmasters office, sneering derisively, spitting that awful word, "Mudblood--" and it's been years, decades, but it burns his blood and steeps his vision in red, </em> <br/> <br/> <b>DO NOT SAY THAT WORD!</b> <br/> <br/> <em> Horcruxes? </em> <br/> <br/> <em> Keep the timeline similar. </em> <br/> <br/> <em> Yes, Horcruxes.  </em> <br/> <br/> <em> Muttering beneath his breath at sixty words per minute as Harry struggled to keep on his broom. </em> <br/> <br/> <em> Drinking himself into a stupor, hating himself all the more, with every sip a vision--his mum, beer bottle in her face, her lips blue and the tile red,  </em> <b>cold, lifeless</b> <em> --and a man with short cropped black hair and an ugly, angry face, nothing like Severus but  </em> everything  <em> like him. </em> <em> <br/> </em> <br/> <em> Remembering Lily's death, the prophecy, his begging, his sick, dizzy realization.  </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> <br/> </em> <em> Watching a poor muggleborn woman, his  </em> <b> <em>friend</em> </b> <em> , not Lily, but something more than an acquaintance killed in cold blood, unable to reassure her or apologize or object. </em> <em> <br/> </em> <br/> <em> I killed her. </em> <br/> <br/> <em> In the Evans' house, at the dinner table when Petunia says, I bet he'll be just like his father, you just watch! And a lightbulb pops and crackles above their head, sparks flying and tears hot on his face, it's the first time Tuney'd made him cry. </em> <br/> <br/> <b>I am NOT my FATHER.</b> <b><br/> </b> <br/> <em> Lately? Only those I could not save. </em> <br/> <br/> Albus pulls out of his head with a sharp breath, and Severus looks at him and is horrified to see tear tracks on the old man’s face. His breath shakes, and Albus just sits there, staring at him for a moment. Severus wonders what he's going say, what he's going to do. What do you say to a man died and returned? <br/> <br/> Albus doesn't say anything.  <br/> <br/> Instead, he  <em> hugs  </em> Severus. The tight embrace terrifies him. His face lax with shock, Severus eventually lets his shields fall completely. He weeps.  <br/> <br/> No man can die without shattering, at least a bit. <br/> <br/> Albus can tell the difference between a false and true memory, but none he'd seen, not even his own, were so vivid and clear. <br/> <br/> Albus had seen Severus' conversation with death. <br/> <br/> <em> The price? Your peace of mind. </em> <br/> <br/>He believes death wholeheartedly in that Severus will never forget any of the things he's seen.</p>
