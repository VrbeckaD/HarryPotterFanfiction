    <p dir="ltr" align="left">Neville Longbottom stared at the bloodied sword at his side. Even after everything, he still couldn’t believe that it fell out if the Sorting Hat and thus allowed him to destroy Voldemort’s last remaining Horcrux, the snake Nagini. Honestly, he couldn’t even believe that he had swung the blow, it almost seemed like the sword swung his arms. He knew that it was a moment which would change his life forever. Already he was beginning to sense it. Every two seconds or so, some cheering person, half-drunk on butterbeer (an accomplishment in itself, it must be said) would come up and slap him on the back and yell some variation of “That was amazing, mate!” in his ear. At first he smiled and thanked them profusely, he even let them sit by him while he ate and chatted with them, but now, sitting half-hunched at the normally Gryffindor House table surrounded by students and teachers and adults of all Houses alike, he was just tired and slightly annoyed with all of the compliments. He just remained silent, stared at the sword, and kept his eyes on it even as their a-bit-too-hard slap on the back jolted him forward. His back was actually starting to hurt now that he thought about it, never mind the countless other injuries he had sustained both before and during the battle at the hands of the Carrows, Crabbe, Goyle, and various other Death Eaters. Plus his hair was somewhat burned due to the Sorting Hat having been on set on fire by Voldemort before Neville’s moment of triumph. He wasn’t even sure if the Sorting Hat survived its ignition. The thought worried him but he was too tired to want to do anything about it. In short, Neville looked, felt, and otherwise resembled, a mess.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> The congratulating crowd had started to thin out. Neville had recognized this and so decided to take it as a sign to get up and go to bed. The fact that many of his friends were lying dead at the other end of the Great Hall wasn’t making him feel any better about the present situation. He got up, grabbed the sword and tucked it inside his rather worse for wear robes. He was just passing out of the Great Hall when he heard a voice behind him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Neville!” called a soft, musical voice.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> Neville turned and saw Luna Lovegood coming, pushing her way through the crowd towards him. He put on the widest smile he could muster.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Hi Luna,” he said when she had reached him, “I was just about to head up to bed. You can walk with me if you want.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Okay.” she said knowingly.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"> </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">“Nice job with the Blibbering Humdinger there.” Neville said with a chuckle.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> Luna chuckled with him, “Can I let you in on a secret?” she said mischievously.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Of course.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “There wasn’t really one there, although I would be very happy if there were, but truthfully Harry just wanted a distraction so he could have some time to himself.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> Neville nodded understandingly, “Wish you were next to me towards the end of my meal. I could’ve used a distraction.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> Luna looked at him slyly, “How many times do you honestly think I can make people look for things that aren’t there?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Oh, I believe you could convince anyone that there’s a Wrackspurt in their vicinity any time, in any place.” Neville said.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"> </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">“There’s actually one floating right behind you.” Luna said quite seriously. “I saw the light shift for a split second.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> Neville looked at Luna oddly but she turned from him and kept walking. Now Neville felt a kind of sickness in him. He thought about how Luna seriously believed in such things as Wrackspurts and Blibbering Humdingers and Crumple Horned Snorkacks and he thought about how even though Hermione said they didn’t exist and that he had certainly never seen any of those things for himself, Luna was one of the most honest and unbreakable people he’d ever met and he was starting to doubt his own intuition. Luna had that effect on people. During his time in his seventh year at Hogwarts, keeping the D.A. alive under the Carrows’ noses with primarily Ginny and Luna’s help, he had heard more than a few members of the D.A., both returning and new, talk quietly about how Luna freaked them out. Yet they couldn’t help but think of her as one of the strongest people they had ever seen. Neville walked on with her, still looking at her, unsure.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"> </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">“Can I talk to you about something?” Luna asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Anything at all,” Neville said, “that’s what friends are for.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> Luna smiled at him and said, “I know you’ve probably heard this as many times as Harry, but that really was an amazing thing you did out there.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Honestly, I’m not sure how much of it was me.” Neville said earnestly, “This thing,” he drew out the sword (Luna took a quarter step away) “really seemed like it knew what it needed to do, it seemed like all I really did was hold it. It was one of the strangest moments of my life.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “I’m not just talking about the snake, you and Ron taking down Greyback, the armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, taking those beatings for hours at a time. That’s rare in a person.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Okay firstly,” Neville said, “Ron was helping with Greyback, plus Greyback didn’t have a wand so it was almost too easy. Second, Venomous Tentacula is really easy to handle if you know how to. And thirdly, Seamus was more busted up then I was, and I really don’t think the amount of scarring we’ll have on our faces really counts as an achievement.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Okay then, what about going to the Room of Requirement when you were trying to run away from the Slytherins and Carrows. You need some imagination to think of something as brilliant as that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “That was all the Room, all I asked it to do was give me a good place to hide.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Fred and George did the same thing, Ginny told me, and all it turned into for them was a broom cupboard. You are something special, Neville.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “I know you believe that,” Neville said solemnly, “I want to believe it too, but the fact is, I had help for all of it. The Sorting Hat, Ron, Professor Sprout, whoever enchanted the Room. I’m only a person who helps other people do things. I just take all of the credit because I did more of it. All I am is lucky.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Come off it!” said Luna, “Even Dumbledore said you had something special. First year, remember?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Yes, and it was all because Hermione put a Full-Body Bind on me when I wouldn’t let them go fight Voldemort. That was just pigheadedness.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “No, it wasn’t. Hermione told me how you talked about worrying that they would get Gryffindor in trouble again and lose more points. You were taking pride in and defending your House, even if your friends weren’t going to let you stop them. That really is bravery, Neville. You represented the value of your House. That’s why Dumbledore gave you those points, Neville. Bravery, not stupidity.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “You’d be surprised how often those two ideas can be applied to the same action.” Neville said glumly.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “I don’t care, Neville. And apparently, neither does the spirit of Godric Gryffindor. After all, you’re holding his sword.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Again, if it wasn’t for the Sorting Hat, Voldemort would’ve killed me after the Hat burned out. And if his charm hadn’t broken, I’d have died unable to even try anything. It’s all luck. Sheer dumb luck.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> Luna stopped talking. They’d arrived at the Fat Lady’s portrait, but she was not in it, so someone had helpfully propped it with a stool. Luna looked at Neville blankly.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Well, if you say so.” she finally said, before floating away without another word, leaving Neville feeling guilty and sad, but he climbed through the portrait hole, taking care to not tip the stool over. Upon entering, he found Hermione and Ron asleep on the couch, his head upon hers upon his shoulder. Neville tiptoed as quietly as he could past them and creeped up the stairs to the dormitory. He sat on his bed with the sword across his lap, staring at it for a while, until Harry crept in as well, with a weary smile on his face. He was halfway across the dormitory before he noticed Neville.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Oh, hullo, Neville.” He said, exhaustion unhidden in his voice.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Hiya, Harry. You sound like hell.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Oh, I know. But I’m actually okay for now.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Really?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Yeah. Fixed my wand.” He held it up.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Really? I honestly didn’t even know you’d broken it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Yeah. Long story, but I used Malfoy’s to stop Voldemort.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Wow. That’s cool!” Neville noted that he didn’t unconsciously flinch when he heard the name anymore.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Yup. So now I’m feeling like I’m whole again.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Good feeling.” Neville chuckled.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Yup. See you’ve got yourself a new toy.” Harry chuckled.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “I guess so.” Neville patted the pommel of the sword. “It is what it is.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “What it is,” Harry said, a bit more seriously, “is one of the most powerful objects in magic. You should be careful with it, and also proud to own it. Means you’re a true Gryffindor, my friend. Dumbledore told me that after it fell on my head second year.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Whoa, really?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Yeah? Didn’t I ever tell you that I used it to kill the Basilisk?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “No!”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Oh. Well, I did. That’s the only reason why it could kill the snake. Basilisk venom’s one of the few things that could’ve and the sword’s goblin-made, so it absorbed that when I stabbed the basilisk in the roof of its mouth.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “That’s crazy!” Neville said, reverting to his pre-5th year shock and awed self.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “I guess.” Harry said, laying back on his bed. “But it’s yours now.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> Neville stared down at it. “I feel even more honored now that I know what it’s been through.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> Harry smiled. Neville turned to him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Harry, mate, can I ask you a weird question?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Go for it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “What’s it gonna be like now? Being famous and all that? I’ve already gotten more praise than I ever wanted tonight and it’s only gonna increase. How do you do it?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Mostly I just learn to not listen or notice when people whisper and stare.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Well, for someone who’s only ever been the object of stares of ridicule, that’s gonna be different.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Yup, but it’s not so bad after a while.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Thanks, mate. What’s your take on all this?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Well...I think you’ve done something extraordinary, and you deserve to be thanked for it. You certainly saved me.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “How?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Distraction. And you killed the last thing keeping Voldemort from dying, so thanks.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “...No problem. But it was all luck, and planning on your part. If you hadn’t told me what to do, I’d’ve stood there while the hat burned my head off.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Yeah, but everything I’ve done has been luck too, so I’ve just come to decide that luck, whatever that means, is kind of the story of life.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “But...where does that leave me? I’m no one special.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> “Maybe that’s life trying to tell you that you are, Neville.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> Neville sat silently for a while. “Thanks, Harry…”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/> He put the sword in his trunk, Stuck its lid on, and got into bed. Harry watched him while he did so and smiled knowingly before falling deeply asleep. Neville lay awake for several hours before he did the same.</p>
