  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The first day at Hogwarts, Harry woke up early as a side conditioning from his years living with the Dursleys, he swore that once he got here he would find everything he could about himself, magic and escaping the Dursleys. If his parents were the heroes that Hagrid had told him, why did he go there with the Dursleys in the first place, why did Voldemort go after him specifically there must have been others things that he could’ve done.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He finished tying up his shoes and looked over at the bed where his new friend slept, Harry decided not to wake him up, as something about him just seemed off. He was grateful for the Weasleys for helping him find his way through the platform, but if Ron had an older brother, wouldn’t his mother remember how to get on? Also, why did she yell it out loudly the train address, along with the name that most magical call non-magicals surely that broke some sort of law? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He decided that he would check in the library for all of those things, he grabbed his bag along with some of his books, the Dursleys hadn't allowed him to read any of his books ahead of time. Claiming they didn't want the neighbors to see his freakish ways, he headed out of the Gryffindor tower and toward the Great Hall. He grabbed a quick breakfast (eggs and bacon taste better hot) grabbed his time table from his head of house. The stern Scottish woman is known as McGonagall, and head out to the library. Looking at the times, he figured he had at least 2 hours before his first class. Which was ironically with his head of house , the very same woman professor McGonagall </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once at the library, he talked to the librarian another stern woman, yet Madam Pince was kind to those who sought knowledge and were not disruptive so she sent him on his way. Harry found a table and set up his stuff, his textbooks, the book on magical law enforcement and his note-taking items. He looked around and saw the older students also coming in to get a headstart on their work, the majority were from Ravenclaw another house. Actually last night he had only chosen Gryffindor as a way to escape the blonde boy who seemed terribly rude, he knew nothing of the houses nor the people within them. Sighing, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I'm really unprepared for this, but that's why I'm here to study, to live as my parents wanted me too. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cracking open his Transfiguration textbook, he began to read quietly the material,  unbeknownst to him he was being watched. Not by a stalker fan wanting to know more of the boy-who-lived but by his fellow year mate curious of the person underneath the title. Hermione Granger stood behind a row of books, her bag slung over her shoulder and her copy of Hogwarts a History clutched tightly against her chest, she looked at where he sat and was wondering whether or not she should sit with him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She bit her bottom lip with her large front teeth still at war with herself, ultimately she decided not to sit with him and found a table right in front of him and set down her stuff began to read from her book. She internally cursed herself, as she could've made a new friend, but her rational side was winning the argument by telling her that she would've distracted him from his reading. A small more hopeless part of herself told her that he wouldn't want to be friends with her in the first place, given that he was Harry Potter the infamous boy-who-lived and she was nothing but a bossy girl with overly large front teeth. She sniffled and wiped away a lone tear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When she sniffled that in turn caused Harry's attention to shift from what he was reading and too look up to see he one of his year mates wiping away a tear. He remembered that girl was the one who just yesterday burst into his compartment looking for another boy's toad and she was the one who pointed out that the ceiling was enchanted. Though she seems to have a very bossy and had a haughty tone Harry could tell that it was an act, her eyes seemed to radiate a type of pain and loneliness, one that he could empathize with. Though he couldn't see her eyes right now, he could tell just from how she was sitting that she was feeling it again the loneliness and the pain. Making up his mind he pushed away from his table and went up to hers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He stood in front of her table and she looked up in shock. "May I sit with you if you don't mind?" She looks up hopeful for a brief moment before a mask slips on and she takes on an air of apprehension, fear, and distrust. “Yes, that would be alright.” She focuses her attention on her book, nearly pushing her nose into the pages so she doesn’t see him. Harry quickly grabs his things and sits down in front of her, he goes back to his work. She looks up after some time, “ need to catch up?” She comments, Harry looks up at her, “yeah, my family wouldn’t let me read back at home, I had to wait till we got here. I remember you saying that you read most of the books back on the train.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione freezes for a moment before blurting out, “you remembered me from the train?” Harry nods, and pulls off his glass gesturing to them, “yeah thank you by the way you fixed these up really well.” She nods and a small genuine smile appears on her face, “ you’re welcome… Harry.” "No problem Hermione Granger." He gives her a smile as well, and the two children go back to their books feeling happier than they have before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a while the two finish their studying and decide to head to class, Hermione pulls out her timetable, "seems we've got Transfiguration first with Professor McGonagall, do you know which way to go?" Harry nods no, "though I'm glad that the prefects showed us the way to the tower, I wish that they could've taken the time to show us the way to class." At that moment an older student, the Ravenclaw prefect walks out of the library as well to hear the two students. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Lost?" they stiffen and turn to her, "I'll help you find your way, where are you two going?" Hermione spoke up first, "we're trying to find a way to the transfiguration classroom, but we don't know where we're going." She gives them a small smile, "I'll help you two, my name is Penelope Clearwater I am a fifth-year Ravenclaw prefect, and you two are Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. If you don't mind me saying it's strange to see two first-year Gryffindors in the library. Sure from the Ravenclaws, it’s expected of them but not from the Gryffindors.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She gestures for them to follow, and Hermione speaks up again, “actually the hat debated whether or not to put me in Ravenclaw, it ultimately decided to put me in Gryffindor.” She said proudly, her mask slipping on again. Penelope nodded calmly and looked at Harry. “ The hat originally wanted to put me in Slytherin. The hat said that I would do great things there, but having met Malfoy on the train I asked if it could put me in Gryffindor.” Penelope and Hermione looked shocked, Hermione as she could consider Harry being the odd one out in the house of the cunning and snakes. While Penelope was wondering why the hat had tried to put him in the same house as the wizard who killed his parents, as well the same house that several suspected and acquitted death eaters from. Though she knew that not everyone who was in the house was considered to be a future death eater in the making, the odds were very high up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know Harry I remember hearing that your parents were some of the best people from Gryffindor.” With that little tidbit, Harry stopped and stared at her with eyes full of pain and want, “ were they really?” He said quietly causing the others to halt as well, at that moment he looked much like a little boy that was lost wanting to know more about his origins and the family he never knew. Penelope bit the inside of her cheek to stop herself from crying as she looked at his eyes so full of pain, while Hermione with eyes growing misty was debating on whether or not to hug him. Whenever she was sad a hug from her parents went a long way in helping her brighten her mood. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry had never had that option, he had always wanted it. How many times had he dreamed in his cupboard that one day his family would come to him, say that it was all a mistake that he was placed there and take him home. Penelope kneeled down in front of Harry and looked at him in the eyes, “if you’d like maybe Professor Mcgnocall has more information she was their head of house when they were here. Also, I heard that a Seventh Year Hufflepuff by the name of Nymphadora Tonks might have known them so ask around for her.” He nods his eyes swimming with tears, “thank you.” He says in a voice so full of gratitude. She moves away from him and Harry is nearly thrown off of his feet by a small brown bushy-haired missile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione wraps her arms around him, he stiffened once before finding out that he liked it, this version of someone wrapping their arms around him. He pulled his hands up once Hermione had loosened her grip and wrapped them around her as well. They were nearly the same height, and their cheeks were mashed together yet both of them felt secure both of them had needed the hug. Penelope looked at the cute sight before and bit her cheek again, only this time to stop herself from saying anything that would embarrass the two. They appeared to be very cute right now and at peace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eventually, they let go of one another, Harry looked at her eyes and Hermione back at his they were both blushing quite a bit. Hermione then looked at her feet, “I'm sorry for grabbing you like that Harry, I just thought you needed a hug. I won’t do it again if you don’t like it “ Harry quickly reassured her “Thank you, Hermione, that was really nice and I needed it, not liking it… that was brilliant and I don’t mind it.” Hermione flashed him a bright smile, “ really then maybe I’ll give you some more hugs later.” Harry smiled excitedly at the prospect of receiving another hug from Hermione. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Penelope then cleared her throat, “come on I’m supposed to be leading you two to class.” She then begins to walk away, and to her amusement and shock, Hermione pulls Harry forward holding his hand. Harry doesn’t seem to mind it at all. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They entered the classroom to see Professor McGonagall getting everything ready, she turned in surprise to see the fifth year Ravenclaw prefect and two of her Cubs. She let out a rare smile at seeing Miss. Granger girl was holding Mr.Potter's hand, "good morning to you three, unless you've brought them here for some other reason Miss. Clearwater?" Penelope shakes her in negation, "no ma'am I found these two in the library this morning, and I offered to show them the way to class. Are they early?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"By nearly ten minutes, thank you for your kindness, Miss. Clearwater ten points to Ravenclaw." She says curtly and goes back to setting up the lesson, Penelope waves goodbye to the two first years and they do the same. Hermione still leading Harry they find a seat at the front and put down her things, and Harry does the same sitting right next to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It is then Harry broaches an uncomfortable subject, "uh Professor McGonagall, Penelope tells me that you knew my parents." She stops what she's doing and turns to face him, "I knew them well, I was their head of house at the time when they were in school.' Harry takes a deep breath before continuing, and it's only a momentary and reassuring squeeze of the hand from Hermione that gives him the strength to continue. "Professor, is there any chance that you could tell me more about them?" He sounded semi-confident while on the inside he was practically begging for the older witch to tell him anything </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>McGonagall stops again, and with the back of her hand quickly wipes away a tear. "Mr. Potter perhaps after your classes, I'll have someone call you to my office so that we may talk." "Thank you, ma'am, do you happen to know a Nymphadora Tonks, according to Penelope she might also know my parents.” She nods, “yes she’s in my N.E.W.T Class, a little clumsy but a bright witch. With her, I recommend you send her a letter using your owl.” Harry nods, “thank you, ma’am.” McGonagall nods as well, she looks over her shoulder to see the young witch calming down Harry with just holding his hand, “Mr. Potter perhaps Ms. Granger would like to be there as well for our meeting. It’s always nice to have a friend to support you in difficult times.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looks up and turns to Hermione with wide pleading eyes, Hermione bites her lower lip as she contemplates it for a brief moment, “ yes Professor if Harry doesn't mind.” Harry nods happily and turns to the Professor with a bright smile which she returns with a small one. Harry then turns to Hermione, “Hermione thank you.” She looks at him, and with a shy smile says, “anything for a friend.” Harry squeezes her hand, “I’m glad that you're my friend Hermione.” She returns the squeeze, “I’m glad that you're my friend Harry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They turn to the front only to see a cat sit on the desk, with no sign of McGonagall anywhere. It took Hermione all of eight seconds to figure out where she was, while it took Harry fifteen seconds. They turned to one another, nodded and went back rereading their textbooks. The classroom suddenly began to fill, as the other students began to arrive, right as class was about to begin Ron Weasley came running in. “Thankfully Old McGonagall isn’t here yet.”  With that statement the cat leaped up and went from a cat into the Professor, she had an unamused look in her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron had his mouth gaping wide in shock, “that was bloody cool Professor!” “Yes I assume it was, yet perhaps next time I should transfigure you a watch or a map so that you don’t get lost and arrive at class on time.” His ears got red as he could hear the sniggers coming from the other students, “but Professor it’s not my fault, no one woke me up, so I got up late and couldn't find Harry, ate breakfast then I got lost.” “Mr. Weasley if you're searching for Mr. Potter perhaps you should look to your right.” Ron turned right and saw Harry looking pensive at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry mate there you are, come on what are you doing sitting up here for. There's probably still some empty seats in the back.” He motions for Harry to follow him, Harry furrows his brows in confusion. “Ron I’m staying here.” Ron looks at him surprised, “what do you wanna do that for, don’t you know that the front of the classroom is for bookworms and teacher's pets?” Hermione shivers right next to him remembering all of the insults from her earlier years, she is surprised when Harry lays a calming hand on hers. She looks up at him in shock, and he gives her a small smile which she eventually returns. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ron I’m staying up here so I can learn.” Ron sneers, “fine be a bookworm and a teacher's pet then.” Professor McGonagall then looms over Ron, “if you two are finished, then please find a seat Mr. Weasley I would hate to take away points from my own house so early in the semester.” His ears redden again as people begin to snigger again, “fine.” He spits out and goes to find a seat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once he sits down, Professor McGonagall begins to go on a lecture on what the art of transfiguration is, what they will be learning for the first semester and some basic charms. Throughout her lecture both Harry and Hermione take notes, careful to not miss a thing. Every so often Hermione raises her hand to ask a question, even stranger Harry also has his own questions for the Professor. While Hermione’s are more on the practical- side, he is more on what they can with use with the brand of magic that they are studying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione seemed to chastise herself after one of Harry's questions she quickly realized the difference between the two of them. While she was more of bookish learning, Harry was someone who learned from example. All the magic and wand movements she had learned from her books and practiced quietly on the train. Harry, on the other hand, is much more a quick study, being able to pick up on the material on the fly. She smiled to herself thinking that her friend might be as smart as her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After their first day, McGonagall made good on her promise and told Harry several stories about his parents and their time there he looked so grateful he might’ve hugged her. Hermione sat with him and was happy just at seeing Harry look so happy, once at the tower the mood quickly died. Ron looked so sour at not attending the meeting that he kept glaring at them, it ruined the good mood that both of them had. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Throughout the week, Harry woke up early, waited for Hermione and they ate breakfast together and studied before classes. He sat next to her in class, taking notes, asking questions in class, and excelling in some of the exercises proving that he is quite powerful in terms of practical magic. He had sent a letter to the Nymphadora Tonks in hopes that he could contact her about his parents and still haven't gotten a reply back. However, he did get a letter from Hagrid inviting him to tea on Friday after his classes, which he did feel really grateful for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron still had certain problems with Hermione so he never really spoke nor sat near him unless it was during lunch and dinner. Even then he had to keep his distance given how much the boy is a messy eater. At one point he had tried to make fun of Hermione by calling her a know-it-all before Hermione could react Harry stepped up to defend her. He merely said, “ that’s not a bad thing actually, in fact, it’s probably the handiest skill ever.” She smiled so brightly for the rest of the evening while Ron looked disgruntled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While Harry kept up his facade as the perfect student, he was doing his side project in the library. Researching the way the government of magic Britain works, the departments and who’s in charge of what. He had to know why his parents had sent him to the Durselys if they were as popular as everyone had been saying wasn’t there anyone else that could’ve taken him. He was also researching the supposed “Lord Voldemort”, the villain who had murdered his parents and nearly destroyed magical Britain. He had found that he had certain followers known as Death Eaters, who were mostly identified by a black tattoo on their wrists that resemble a skull with a snake and a vast majority of those followers had been freed due to something known as the Imperious curse. He would research the rest of that later.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On Friday, they had double potions with the Slytherins.Ron had again tried to accost Harry and move him away from Hermione. "Harry mate come on we gotta find a good seat, heard from Fred and George that he's tough on Gryffindors that are late might as well hurry if we wanna get good seats." He reaches over to wrap his arm around Harry's shoulder,  only for Harry to slip out and turn to Hermione. “Hermione let’s go, you heard Ron Snape doesn’t appear to be a very polite man when it comes to people that are tardy.” Hermione huffs, “Professor Snape, Harry and you’re right let's go.” Once again Hermione grabs his hand and pulls him towards the Dungeons at a fast pace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron growls and follows them. Once at the Dungeons, the classroom layout is that the tables are pushed together so that they create a group of four. Both of them take a seat at the front again, Ron takes the seat to Harry’s right, and a round-faced boy takes the last seat. Harry looks up at him and attempts to remember the boy’s name. “Hey, Neville right?” Neville is shocked at the fact that Harry Potter knows his name, he is even more shocked at the fact that he is talking to him. He nods meekly, “Yeah I’m Neville  Longbottom, pleasure Mr. Potter.” Harry shakes his head, “Neville you can call me Harry, we’re roommates right, for the next 7 years so we might as well call each other by our first names.” Neville nods, “right thanks, Harry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When the classroom starts to fill in, Harry recognizes the blonde boy Malfoy his name is. He looks positively smug and full of himself once he struts into the room. Harry looks away from him and pulls out some parchment and a quill getting ready for the lesson to begin. At that moment like a great big bat, Severus Snape comes flying into the room. His sneer on full blast as he scans the room full of students then he finds him the one whose very existence of his worst enemy., You are here to learn the subtle art of potion-making, there will be no foolish wand movements in this class, I hardly expect any of you to understand the complexity of this course….</span>
  <b> I can teach you to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death.” (JK. Rowling Pg 137) </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His sneer is trained on the spawn of James Potter, “</span>
  <b> Potter what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” (JK. Rowling Pg 137). </b>
  <span>Harry remembered it from his readings earlier that morning, “Draught of living death, sir.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He is undaunted by the answer that is given to him, he is determined to humiliate the boy of his enemy. “Where can I find a bezoar?” Harry grows contemplative, he can feel Hermione right next to him her arm still in the air. She begins to fidget as she knows the correct answer, yet the teacher pays her no mind. “It would be found in a goat's stomach sir.” “Well, it seems that you aren’t exactly like your father. “ Any other comment that he was about to make, dies in his throat seeing the pained expression in Harry’s eyes at the mention of his father. He then moves to the last question only this one is addressed to everyone in the room. “What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?”  At the last question, Harry has no answer, Snape smiles internally. He sighs seeing Hermione fidget as she knows the answer. He looks around the room and sees that she’s the only one.“yes Ms. Granger.” “Well, sir they are the same plant commonly known by the same name aconite.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the answer that was given he was stunned that a first year would know that, begrudgingly he had to admit that she deserved something for that answer. “A point to Gryffindor.” He spits out before heading to the board. “Follow the instructions on the board, when you finish take a sample and leave it on my desk.” He waves his hand over the board creating the instructions for the potion, then begins to go around the room, looming over the shoulders of the students trying to see if they are doing what he says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At a certain point, Harry looks over to see Neville about to drop porcupine quills into his potion prematurely, which would mess up the entire potion. Harry reaches over to stop him, poor Neville appears to be so afraid and nervous. “Neville don’t add that to your potion yet, wait till you move the cauldron off of the fire.” Neville looks down and drops them as if they were on fire. “Thanks, Harry.” Snape then hovers above both of them, “well Potter it seems that I misjudged you again, take another point for Gryffindor.” At the end of class, everyone leaves off a small vial of their work.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once everyone leaves, Severus is alone to his thoughts. </span>
  <em>
    <span>He looks like Potter, yet his eyes how much they look like Lily’s. Have I been wrong in my hatred of him?</span>
  </em>
  <span> He holds the small sample of Harry’s work, </span>
  <em>
    <span>almost the exact color of a perfect potion. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>*******************</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the four of them walk out, Neville fidgets uncomfortably, then turns to Harry. “Thank you for your help there.”  Harry shakes his head in negation, “it’s fine Neville you would have done the same with me.” He gives him a small smile, which Neville returns. Ron, however, is still stunned by what happened in class. “ How the hell did you two manage to do that?”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry and Hermione look at one another, “ do what?” Hermione questions nervously. Ron looks at both of them in shock, “that... have Snape give you guys points. According to my brothers he almost never gives Gryffindors points, Ravenclaws maybe, but never Gryffindor. How did you guys do that?” “We just did the work, kept quiet, answered the questions that’s it.” Ron still looks at both of them incredulously, “well maybe being friends with a know it all isn't that bad." Harry glares at him for saying that to Hermione. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right well what are we gonna do now? We could play chess or we could talk about quidditch. In a couple of weeks, we're going to have a class on broomstick riding. Can't wait for that!" He looked so excited at the prospect of riding a broom again, though he didn't have the newest top of the line broom back home he still missed having the option to fly. He can see it now, next year he'll apply for the Quidditch team, possibly as a keeper or as a chaser. He won't make it in, but he'll show his interest in the team, from then he just has to bide his time until he's made Quidditch captain get spotted by someone from the Chudley Cannons and then he'll ensure his team becomes the number one.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione bites her lower lip, something she usually does when she's nervous. Harry is quick to notice that, “are you alright Hermione?” She looks away shamefully, "I don't know if I'll be any good on a broom, plus there's the matter that I haven't properly researched anything about broomsticks, and there's probably loads of theories and such about them….and….” Harry raises his eyebrow questioningly, “and…?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She whispers and he has to strain his hearing in order to hear her, “I’m afraid of heights.” Ron looks at her flabbergasted, “what’s all that about eh? Theories about riding a broom… pure rubbish all you need to do is to get on top of it, and kick-off, simple as that.” Harry looks over at him with raised eyebrows, “well what if you kick off too hard? Then what you’ll be too high up and can’t get down.” He says while trying to assuage Hermione’s fears and Ron’s dismal of them. It’s Neville that speaks up next, “My Gran never let me fly a broom, I'm also afraid of heights so I’m with you there Hermione.” Hermione nodded in gratitude, while Ron continued to stare at them as if they were mad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sensing that the conversation was over both Harry and Hermione began to walk away, only for Ron to call out to him. “Harry mate where are you guys going?” “Hagrid’s place, he’s invited me to get some tea, I asked Hermione if she wanted to come earlier and she said yes.” Ron rushes over to them, “I wanna go, my brother’s are always telling me that Hagrid’s a really great guy.” Harry sighs softly, “sure, Neville wanna come with us too?” He says spotting Neville about to leave, Neville looks at him shyly, “I mean if you’re sure I don’t wanna be a bother.” Harry gives him a small smile, “no bother Nev, I’m pretty sure Hagrid won’t mind the company.” Neville smiles back and walks out with the rest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They exit the castle and make their way to Hagrid’s hut, a small hut out on the edge of the Forbidden forest. Harry knocks on the door and they hear a dog barking on the other side, Hagrid’s booming voice commanding the dog. “Fang get back!” Hagrid opens the door and looks down happily to see Harry and his eyebrows are raised up and nearly lost to his wild mess of hair as he sees the rest of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“These your friends ‘Arry?” Harry nods happily, “yes this is Ron Weasly, Neville Longbottom and Hermione Granger.” Hagrid smiles at his young friend, “well come on in, I made tea and some rock cakes.” Harry comes in while both Neville and Hermione mouth to one another, </span>
  <em>
    <span>rock cakes? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Ron, on the other hand, looks happy at something to eat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once inside they realize that the rock cakes were aptly named after Ron almost broke a tooth on them. Hagrid moves the tray hoping to offer one to the others, “Weasley huh? I know your brothers, good men, Charlie’s my favorite, cause he works on a dragon preserve, a lucky man he is. Getting to work with those beautiful creatures. Your twin brothers on the other hand, they’ve given me so much trouble. Pair of demons those two are.” He goes to Neville next who refuses the rock cake. “Longbottom eh, shame what happened to your folks. Good people they were.” Neville nods proudly, while the others stare at him and wonder what had happened to his parents. When he gets to Hermione she refuses as well only she has an explanation. “My parents are dentists, it's a type of muggle doctor for teeth.” Hagrid nods thoughtfully while remembering another Potter with a bright muggle-born witch and wondering whether or not history will repeat itself. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Well, I can hope I guess. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He asks Harry how his first week had been going, to which Harry answered with a bright smile. “It’s been so great Hagrid, I’ve been working hard in all of my classes even Professor Snape managed to give me a point. Professor McGonagall even told me a lot about my parents, even told me that a student by the name of Nymphadora Tonks might know them.” Hagrid stops drinking his tea and looks at him warily, “might wanna be careful with her Harry, she’s related to Sirius Black.” Ron and Neville stop drinking their tea and look at him in shock, both Hermione and Harry look at the other’s confused. “Who?” “He was You-know-who’s right-hand man back during the war, he’s the reason why your parents were killed, we all thought he was trustworthy then he goes around and tells You-know-who where your parents were. In fact, when another friend of your Dad… what was his name, Peter Pettigrew, tried to fight him, Black killed him and thirteen muggles. He’s been in Azkaban ever since Nymphadora Tonks is the daughter of his cousin.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looks contemplative then looks right at Hagrid, “did he have the Death Eater tattoo, that the other’s had? Did you see it during the trial?” Hagrid’s eyebrows furrow making it look like they are one giant fuzzy caterpillar. “Uh well I didn’t see it, but he was a follower of You-know-who.I mean everyone heard Peter blame him when he caught the bastard.” Harry still looks confused, “but what about his trial, what was his part to say? I mean if he was a follower of Voldemort…. (everyone but Hermione gasped.) did he have the mark?” Again Hagrid’s brows furrow, “no, but Harry he’s a bad guy and don’t say that name.” Ron and Neville nod in agreement, while Hermione glares at them. “Fear of a name will only increase the paranoia behind it,” Harry nods agreeing with his friend's statement, “besides he’s dead anyway so what’s the point of still being afraid of him or his name.” Hagrid now looks contemplative, “reckon your both right… no use fearing a dead man eh?” Ron looks like he wants to argue, while Neville agrees with the others. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s at this moment Harry looks over the newspaper on Hagrid’s stove, “ Hagrid what’s that?” “Oh this, it’s the wizarding newspaper called the Daily Prophet, here take a look.” He passes it to Harry who checks out the first page, </span>
  <b>“BREAK-IN AT GRINGOTTS.” </b>
  <span> Harry’s eyes widened in alarm remembering what Hagrid had said to him when they first went to Gringotts. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>You’d have to be crazy to break into Gringotts.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He also remembered Ron mentioning it on the train, now this his chance to see the full story. Hermione notices his friend’s panic and moves to his side. The two read through the article, attempting to digest what is being said. “Hagrid why does this vault sound familiar?” Harry says feigning ignorance, knowing full well that the vault that had been robbed was the same one that Hagrid had went to the day they visited. “You remember Harry that’s where I went to grab that thing for Dumbledore.” He says proudly while the other’s stare at him with raised eyebrows. Hagrid furrows his brows again, “shouldn't have said that I should not have said that.” Harry rereads the article and looks at the date of the break-in, it was the day after he had gone to Gringotts just like Ron had said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Something in his mind then clicks, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Gringotts maybe the Goblin’s might know something about my parents, they did have a vault there. Actually Professor McGonagall mentioned that my dad had a group of friends, but she never mentioned their names. She said that information was best saved for another day… I wonder… </span>
  </em>
  <span>“uh Hagrid Professor McGonagall mentioned that my dad had a group of friends, what do you know about them?” Hagrid looks at him proudly, “of course ‘Arry there was the traitor, of course, Sirius Black, the small one Peter Pettigrew and Lupin.” Harry raises his eyebrow’s questionably, “whose Lupin?” “No that wasn’t his first name it Remus Lupin, he was a great friend of your Pa, the four of them were a group. You know something the year that he came in that’s when the Whomping Willow was planted.” “The Whomping Willow? What’s that Hagrid?” Hagrid gestures to his window. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great big violent tree, somewhere near the entrance of Hogwarts.” He sighs, “ruddy violent too. Now then Harry how was your first week at Hogwarts?” With that, the conversation turns to their first week, yet Harry’s mind is on other things, such as how to contact the goblins about his parents and how to find Remus Lupin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>**************</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the visit, Harry quickly penned two notes, one for Lupin and the other to the goblin that showed him around Gringotts, Griphook his name was. He was on his way to the Owlery when someone quickly paired up next to him. He looked shocked at seeing Hermione there, she had a bit of paper in her hands, she gave him a shy smile. “Hello Harry, where are you going?” Harry quickly smiled back at her, “the Owlery, I’ve got some letters for Hedwig to deliver, and you?” “The same place, I wanted to send a letter to my parents telling them of my first week here.” She then gave him a strange look, “Hedwig?” “My owl, remember you’ve met her.” Hermione nods remembering a beautiful white owl.“Would you like Hedwig to deliver your letter for you?” “If you’re sure about it, I don’t want to overwork her.” Harry shakes his head, “don’t worry we’ll ask her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once the two first years arrive at the Owlery, Hedwig is quick to fly down to greet the two of them. She nods her head happily in Harry’s direction, then turns her gaze to Hermione. “Hedwig this is my friend Hermione Granger, now I’ve got two letters to deliver, would you also mind taking Hermione’s letter to her family?” Hedwig stares at Hermione, so much that Hermione looks away bashfully before she lets out a low bark. “You wouldn't mind?’ Hedwig nods, “ I just didn’t want to overwork you.” Hedwig barks again only this time it’s in annoyance, “sorry I should’ve just known that you could handle it.” She nods and holds her leg out. Both Harry and Hermione give her the letter’s and she flies off to deliver her work. The two wander off and watch her from the large window. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione then looks at Harry, “Harry how will Hedwig find my parents home?” Harry looks at her flying away, “according to the man who sold me her, the owl will always deliver the message. He also said that she can lift twice her own weight.” Hermione's eyebrows are raised up in surprise, “Really, how’d they get them to do that?” Harry shrugs, “magic probably.” She huffs, “honestly magic is not the answer to everything.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry laughs and points behind him, “just don’t let them hear you say that they’ll probably lose their minds.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>She laughs as well, the stops and looks down and bites her lower lip, knowing that her curiosity has won out. “Harry, may I ask who you were writing too? Your relatives?” Harry’s expression hardens and he looks bitterly away, “not a chance.” His face then softens as he sees Hermione look at him shocked, “sorry it’s just I don’t have a good relationship with them. They don’t like magic, and they aren't really nice people.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, after my parents found out that I was a witch, both of them read my textbooks with me so that they could try to understand what I’m learning.” Harry gives her a small smile, “that’s good… they wanted to learn where they were sending their daughter. I was sending the letter to the other man that Hagrid mentioned Lupin.” “Why?” Harry coughs attempting to come up with a lie, one that is believable for someone as smart as her. "I still want to know more about my parents, if he was their friend then well I want to know what he knew about them. About Sirius Black and mostly where he's been. How come he's never visited me." He said the last part sadly looking down at a crack within the stone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione wraps her arms around him, hugging him softly. Harry lazily wraps his arm around her, "thank you." He says to her, she smiles back at him. "If he was half as loyal as Hagurd said, I assume he's been feeling guilty for not visiting and must have a good reason for not doing so." "Do you think he'll like me?" "Yes, I assume he will." He sighs happily, then Hermione's curiosity wills out and she asks another question." Harry what about the second note?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looks away worriedly, he attempts to keep his voice even but fails. "Its a thank you letter to Mrs. Weasley, Ron's mum. I wanted to thank get for helping me get on the platform." He looks straight ahead, as he owns that Hermione might've been able to see through his lies. Hermione looks at him and studies him intently. Though she knows that it's a lie, she somehow knows it's nothing bad. Her curiosity is attempting to blurt out, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry you're lying, tell me who it really is?" </span>
  </em>
  <span>She is afraid of losing his friendship, within her first week at Hogwarts she's managed to do something that was impossible in the normal world. She found a best friend, one that would stand by her and defend her "unnatural" study habits, she didn't want to lose that despite how loud her curious side was yelling at her to ask that question. So she silenced it and looked out at the window staring at Hedwig fly away. </span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <span>She promises to herself, </span>
  <em>
    <span>one day Harry Potter you'll be able to trust me with anything, I'll win your trust, and for that, I swear to be your friend forever. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Meanwhile, Harry thinks to himself, </span>
  <em>
    <span>one day Hermione Granger I'll tell you everything. I swear it, I'm glad that you're my friend and I promise to be your friend forever. </span>
  </em>
  <span>The two first-year oblivious to the promises that either has made in their head, hold one another offering comfort to the other watching as the owl flies away. </span>
