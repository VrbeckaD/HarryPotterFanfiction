    <p> I don’t own Harry Potter.</p><p>Violet Potter. Stared up at the castle that had been her home for so long. She’ left only two years before and now here she stood back again. She sighed and walked up the walkway and made her way into the castle. Finally ready to find out why Minerva wanted to see her.</p><p>“Minerva.” She smiled meeting the other woman in the entrance hall. It still felt weird calling the other woman anything other then professor McGonagall.</p><p>“Violet dear thank you for making time to see me.”</p><p>Violet laughed as she followed Minerva. “Well considering my Auror career never really took off because of my lack of enthusim to continue hunting down dark witches and wizards I have nothing but time on my hands.”  She internally sighed thinking of how her career had went up in flames and how she’d pulled away from her friends Ron now working with George in Weasley Wizard Weezers and Hermione quickly climbing the ladder at the ministry.</p><p>“Well that will hopefully be our gain.” Minerva told her peaking her curiosity.</p><p>“oh.” She mused as they got to the Gargoyle guarding the entrance of the Headmistress’s office.</p><p>“Wheezers.” This caused Violet to laugh again as the gargoyle stepped aside.</p><p>“Please don’t tell George that’s my password.” Minerva grimaced. Violet just smiled she always knew Minerva had a soft spot for the twins.  She settled into the seat across from McGonagall’s desk.</p><p>“So what can I do for you Minerva?”</p><p>“Well the thing is we need a Defense teacher. Sadly Professor Levi has to leave to attend to some personal business.  Not that he was any good.” Minerva muttered.</p><p>Violet tried to stifle her laughter. “So what you want me to be the DADA professor.”</p><p>“Yes.” Minerva nodded. “You’re perfect for the job.</p><p>“Well I’m not so sure about that and what would Severus say about this.” She arched her eye brow.</p><p>“He’ll just have to deal with sharing the castle with you again. Violet sighed she was sure that was better said then done. As she thought back to her 8<sup>th</sup> year at Hogwarts Voldemort defeated and Snape and her in the castle only this time both as adults. He’d given up his post as Head master never wanting the job anyway and slunk back down into his dungeon</p><p>
  <em>“Severus you can’t just live in the dungeons.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m not.” He snapped. “I come out for meals and I teach all the classes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh really because I see Draco teaching many of them.” She smirked. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Leave me alone Miss Potter.  You may have saved my life but that does not mean we have to be friends.” He snapped. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Really.” She sighed shaking her head. “You almost die and you think that is what makes me want to be your friend. Not the fact that you gave me the sword or saved my life or just that you’re a good person. Even if you do act like an overgrown bat. Sometimes.” She muttered. Pushing her red hair from her face. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh miss Perfect Potter.” He sneered. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Fine sulk down here see if I care.” She snapped. “Cry over your dark mark and learn to never live.” She shook her head in disgust. I’m disappointed in you.”  With that she turned on her heel and left. </em>
</p><p>Violet shook her head sadly as she came out of her memory.  That may have only been their first confrontation of the year a month after term started but it certainly wouldn’t be there last and things would explode by the end of the year. She gently brushed her fingers against her lips getting an odd look from McGonagall. She had said he wouldn’t like her here and that was true but could she stand being in the same castle as him again?</p><p> She looked at her old head of house. She bit her bottom lip and knew if she didn’t take this chance she’d regret it. “Okay.”</p><p>“Thank you Miss Potter. I will have a contract written up for you and send it to you to sign with in a few days. You will be expected to report to the castle by the feast on the night of September first but may come at any time starting on the first of August if you wish to take more time to get settled.</p><p>“Thank you Minerva I look forward to hearing from you.” Minerva surprised her by hugging her.</p><p>“Thank you for agreeing Violet I know you’re the best person for this position.”  Minerva whispered in her ear. With a smile the two woman separated. Violet made her way back to the great hall but before she could get out the door she bumped into the very man she was trying to avoid.</p><p>“Severus.” She looked up at the man. “Still dressing like the bat of the Dungeons I see.”</p><p>“Miss Potter.” He sneered. “What are you doing here”</p><p>“Well that’s for me to know and maybe for you to find out. You gave up the right to care about what is going on in my life. Severus.” She snapped whirling around and storming out of the doors and down the path.</p><p>He watched her go lost in thought.</p><p>
  <em>“What are you doing here Miss Potter?” he looked up from the essay’s he had been grading. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“well since you once again seem determined to sequester yourself away in this office I thought I’d bring you some tea.” She held up the cup and walked towards his desk setting it down. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He looked at it oddly. “Thank you.” He finally got out. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Don’t worry I didn’t poison it.” She heaved a sigh and rolled her eyes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I didn’t think you did.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yes you did.” She giggled. “Admit it the thought crossed your mind.” He hadn’t dignified that with a response and she’d just shrugged leaving the office. He hadn’t meant to but he’d watched her walk away. </em>
</p><p>He shook his head coming out of his thoughts of the past. Why was she here?” he had a sinking feeling he knew why and wasn’t sure how to process that if it was true life in the castle would be even more torture then they had been years ago during her eighth year.</p><p> </p>
