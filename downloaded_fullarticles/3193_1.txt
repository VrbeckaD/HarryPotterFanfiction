    <p>Hogsmeade was already covered in snow, but it didn't stop the weather to add a little more powder sugar to the view. It was snowing again, not that anyone would mind in the village. The shop windows were full of with reindeers, Santa Claus and fairy lights. The streets were filled with Christmas carol and the smells of freshly baked gingerbread. These little things inevitably reminded everyone that there were only a few weeks left until Christmas.</p>
<p>Severus Snape wrapped his hands around his mug. He took a deep breath, and his nose the smell of cinnamon, orange, clove filled his nose; It was Rosmerta's perfectly made mulled wine.</p>
<p>He held his mug a bit tighter. The hot what was coming from the mug warmed up his fingers <span>slowly.</span> He was still wearing his fingerless gloves. It even surprised himself how much he loved this piece of clothes. It was a present from Minerva last year. He hated to wearing gloves. He hated that he couldn't move his finger freely; he felt lame, he couldn't make a simple task in gloves, like opening the door or use his wand properly. So he didn't wear gloves, but in the cold his skin got dry, and his hands turned to red. He also hated it. When Minerva gave him these fingerless gloves, he was unsure about it.</p>
<p>"It's a win-win, Severus" explained Minerva "It's like you wearing something, but your fingers are almost free."</p>
<p>And it was true. Of course, these gloves didn't keep his whole hand warm, but it was better than nothing.</p>
<p>He took a sip of his mulled wine and watched the people. Outside two boys, who were wearing Hufflepuff uniform, were kissing and giggling. They certainly didn't need to hold a mug of hot drink to warm themselves up.</p>
<p>"Severus?"</p>
<p>A soft, lovely, oldish voice brought Severus back from his thought, but he couldn't tear his eyes away from the young couple. They were tossing and pulling each other, throwing snow in the other face, and then laughing and kissing. They were so happy, so enviable. Severus hated to admit, but he envied them. Before he could be lost in his thought again, somebody gently squeezed his hand.</p>
<p>"You're thinking about him again, aren't you?" asked Minerva quietly. She also saw the happy couple outside. Who doesn't? They were a cheerful picture.</p>
<p>Severus sigh and he finally managed to look away. "Is it that obvious?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, only for me," She chuckled "Have you talked to him yet?"</p>
<p>Severus shook his head. No, he hasn't. That would be the first step, but this little step terrified him. Because speaking carried the possibility that he would be rejected. And Severus would rather face the Dark Lord again than to hear 'No'.</p>
<p>"Why don't you invite him to dinner? Surely, he wouldn't say no for that"</p>
<p>"I don't want to disturb him. I heard, these days, the Aurors have a lot of work. They are overworked and exhausted."</p>
<p>"Yes, I heard that too, and that's why you should ask him. I'm sure he's dying for a quiet evening. Take him to your favourite restaurant."</p>
<p>Severus shook his head again. "He'll say no, I know."</p>
<p>"You don't know that, Severus." said Minerva seriously "Besides, if you never try, you will never know. You have to start somewhere, and I think dinner is a good start. Harry respects you, Severus. He won't say no for a dinner invitation."</p>
<p>Yes, It's the respect why he wouldn't reject him, but that wasn't enough for Severus. He didn't want to spend an evening with Harry just because he didn't want to be impolite to say no.</p>
<p>"Are you finished with your mulled wine? Great! Let's go, help me find the perfect present for Poppy."</p>
<p>"She is your best friend Merlin knows how many years now and it's the same story every Christmas... What to buy for Poppy?"</p>
<p>"Because It's so hard to find a gift for her!"</p>
<p>"Then buy nothing" suggested Severus while he was paying for their drinks.</p>
<p>"That would be rude!"</p>
<p>Severus was so grateful that Minerva had this special ability to distract him. Sometimes the distraction annoyed him, but he didn't mind it. While he was busy to listing all the gift ideas for Poppy, he hasn't been thinking about that he would rather wandering with someone else on these streets.</p>
<p>They were so deep into their conversation in the whole time, and they didn't even notice that someone overheard them. A woman, with brown hair, watched the other two leave the place. Her eyes were burning in a maniac, insane fire and she was rubbing her hands together. There was a kind of sly smirk on her face; even the Devil would step out of her way.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Two days have passed since his meeting with Minerva and Severus couldn't get out of his head what she has said. A dinner... Actually, a dinner wasn't a bad idea. But... Severus couldn't picture himself as he walks into Harry's office and says: Are you free tonight? Because I'd like to invite you to dinner. Please say 'yes' 'cause I won't survive your 'no'!</p>
<p>Pathetic! It was pathetic! He was pathetic!</p>
<p>He slapped the phial down on the table, thanks to the protection he didn't crush it. He leaned over his cauldron, and he was surprised to see that the potion was green. It was supposed to be red at this stage... Did he messed up, or did he created something new? Did he put the dried lizard tails in it? What the hell was he doing in the last half an hour? Certainly not what he should have to... This whole thing was slowly driving him crazy. Severus sighed deeply; he needed to concentrate. He began to examine what was in his cauldron; it looked like he has created a new potion. Excitement washed over him, and the world ceased to exist.</p>
<p>That was the reason why he didn't see that somebody was behind him, pointing a wand the middle of his back. The spell hit him unexpectedly. He fell on his knees; his hands were tied together behind his back. Before he could turn around to see his attacker a hand grabbed his hair and pulled his head back. A spell forced his lips open, and his mouth was filled with a potion, another spell forced him to swallow it. He immediately recognised the taste of the potion; it burned his throat. He wanted to scream but...</p>
<p>"You can thank me later!"</p>
<p>That was the last thing what he had heard; then something covered his mouth and eyes.</p>
<p>The world turned black and dangerously quiet around him.</p>
