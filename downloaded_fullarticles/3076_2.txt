  <em> Slip. </em>

  <em> Clash! </em>
</p><p>Harry's body froze, his lungs failing him. He was defenceless. Small. <em> Lost. </em></p><p>“Harry. Harry, <em> breathe. </em> It's okay.”</p><p>He nodded, but his eyes refused to move away from the floor. It was all too familiar—the broken dish, the food seeping in between the floorboards. He could almost hear the screams; could almost feel the dread of being trapped between cramped walls again.</p><p>Warm arms embraced him; tender lips kissed his shoulder. A wand moved behind him, twice—the mess in front of him vanished, and Elvis started playing on their old gramophone.</p><p>“See? It’s okay, love.” Draco’s voice was like a lullaby. Calming. Grounding. <em> Safe. </em></p><p>They rocked to the rhythm of the song. Harry leaned against the familiar body he’d long ago learned to trust and closed his eyes, sighing as the fear started to fade away.</p><p>“You’re not that boy anymore,” soft lips murmured against his neck. “You’re a man now. My man.” Draco sniffed Harry’s hair, which made him chuckle—Draco could never get enough of his scent. “You're safe, Harry.”</p><p>“Yeah...I am.” Harry smiled. “And I'm home.”</p></div>
