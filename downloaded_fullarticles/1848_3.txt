    <p>“All right Neville, you just have to take your time and read everything through twice. Don’t get bogged down in the steps. Take it one at a time.” Remus heard Regulus’ calming voice as he entered Potions Master’s room. It made his stomach turn a bit.</p><p>They were now entering the third month of school and he still couldn’t get over the fact that he was working with his ex-boyfriend’s supposedly evil brother. September and October were rather mundane, er, well, outside of the fact Remus had to stop a Dementor on the train from trying to give Harry their dreaded kiss. That was the last way he wanted to see the boy for the first time in ages who was supposed to grow up calling him Uncle Remus. Seeing Harry twisted something in his chest that he long thought was dead. It killed him every day that the boy had no idea who he was. He had tea with him that day very day in fact. Remus wanted to tell him everything but just couldn’t.</p><p>On top of having to deal with the inner turmoil of teaching Lily and James’ son, he had to work with Regulus Black. The brother of his ex-boyfriend. The boyfriend who may or may not have murdered three of his best mates in cold blood. Remus was fairly sure that he didn’t. At the start of it all, he thought Sirius did. They had broken up because they both were accusing one another of being the spy. The more Remus thought about it rationally, the more it didn’t make any sense. The only thing was, he couldn’t be sure because how else could everything be explained? He just hoped someone could explain it all to him properly one day, even if Sirius had committed such a betrayal. It could possibly be Sirius seeing the man managed to escape Azkaban… if anyone could it would be Sirius.</p><p>“But sir, I do read it twice. I sometimes read it five times!” Neville sounded pained, Remus almost felt bad for interrupting but he needed his Wolfsbane. “Oh, hello Professor Lupin.”</p><p>“Hello Neville, how are you today?” Remus smiled, looking to see there were a few other students in the classroom getting help. It was a Sunday, so it was interesting to see. He didn’t even make himself available for more help on a Sunday.</p><p>“Huh, it’s time for you all to get going. If you need more help, come back tomorrow. My goodness, it’s the Halloween Feast tonight. You’ve spent far too much time studying today, enjoy yourselves.” Regulus said to the students.</p><p>“I’ll never get this.” Neville said, packing his things up. His face was long and his overall demeanor said that he was completely frustrated by his slumped shoulders and clenched jaw.</p><p>“Neville, I was complete pants at potions when I was your age.” Remus told the boy. He was another kid who had wished he could tell more about himself to. He was close to Frank and Alice, especially when they were in The Order together.</p><p>“Really? Did you get better?” He asked eagerly.</p><p>“Well, I improved but it was never my strongest suit. I got a lot of help from my friends and the professor at the time. Your professor seems to be more than willing to make sure you achieve, so keep putting in the work.”</p><p>Neville groaned and nodded before taking off. The poor kid.</p><p>“Professor Lupin,” Regulus greeted him as the last of the students exited the room.</p><p>“Professor Black,” The words still felt weird on Remus’ tongue. In the dark light of the dungeon, Regulus looked too much like Sirius. He was a bit shorter than his brother but the Black family’s features were so prominent. That bloody pureblood line and its inbreeding. After all these years, he still missed Sirius desperately. He still missed James, Lily, and Peter as well. It didn’t help that now he worked at Hogwarts and was reminded of them all each day.</p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t realize what time it was. I would have had things ready. I get so carried away with things.” So didn’t his brother.</p><p>“It’s fine.” Remus nodded as he followed Regulus into his office. The supplies were on the table awaiting them. It always baffled Remus that Regulus, who was a former Death Eater (or current if some people were correct) was making him a potion that could easily kill him if something even so small went wrong. Though, Remus had faced worse in his life and if he died, well, there wasn’t much for him on this earth. It was a miracle he was there anyhow.</p><p>“Excited for the Halloween Feast? I can tell you it’s just as good as it was when we were young lads.” Regulus smiled. Remus hated how nice he was but Regulus was always nice, even when Sirius was telling Remus that he wasn’t.</p><p>“Is that why you came back here the other year?” Remus joked. Regulus started teaching the year Harry started at Hogwarts. Remus thought that rather odd.</p><p>“The food was a big draw. I wouldn’t say it wasn’t.” Regulus began to make the potion, picking up some vial. Remus was still pants at potions.</p><p>Remus partly hated the Wolfsbane, it tasted horrible but it did make things a bit better. It didn’t solve all of his problems but it made him worry less about killing someone accidentally. Part of the draw of coming to Hogwarts was being able to get the Wolfsbane and have someone who was willing to make it for him. He was happy to work for Marlene and Dorcas at their shop in Coventry since he returned from his travels a few years back but it didn’t exactly pay a lot or have that extra luxury.</p><p>“Well, this bothers my stomach so I don’t think I’ll be eating much.” Remus frowned. It was not the first time his furry little problem put a damper on things. He had missed feasts and holidays and birthdays before due to it.</p><p>“Yes, it can do that. We could wait til afterwards for this.” Regulus stopped what he was doing.</p><p>“No, that’s mad. I’ll be fine.” He waved a hand.</p><p>Regulus gave him a concerned look that reminded him far too much of Sirius’ so he had to turn away. Remus occupied himself by looking at Regulus’ bookshelf. How was he going to survive any longer with this Black? He had no idea how to interact with Regulus. Everything was stilted and strange whenever he was near him. Remus knew that Reg still believed that Sirius was the murderer — or that was the front he was putting on at least. They hadn’t talked about it but he heard him talking with some of the other professors the other day. It made Remus wonder if Regulus had any doubts about Remus. He knew what their relationship was before.</p><p>The younger Black had caught them snogging when Remus was supposed to be on prefect duty and they ended up in the area Reg was patrolling. The look on Regulus’ face made Sirius laugh so hard that he almost knocked himself out on the stone wall behind him. Reg said he was going to report them but nothing ever happened. This was after Sirius had run away from the family, so he said that he hoped it got back to Walburga and Orion to give them both heart attacks. From what Remus understood, both Black parents had died so he hoped that they had that knowledge before their passing. Their son was snogging a bloke who was not only a mudblood but a dark creature. Not that Regulus knew that about the last part at the time of the events. Well, if he did he never said anything.</p><p>“All set, here you go, Lupin.” Regulus held out the goblet to him.</p><p>With one big gulp, Remus took the potion then burped. Purple smoke came out from his mouth. He put his hand on his stomach then told Regulus he would see him in a few at the feast. Remus went back to his room to make a cup of ginger tea for his stomach. When he did it would remind him of his mother would do so when he would be recovering from the full. He missed her since she was killed during the war. The relationship with his father was extremely strained and his health wasn’t doing well. Remus wished that he had some familial connection still but there was no one left. He was lucky enough to have Marlene, Dorcas, Mary, and Gid still around. He couldn’t imagine what his life would be without them — even if he had pushed them away for the longest time.</p><p>Down at the feast, Remus tried his best to enjoy himself but his mind was on the past, as it had been lately. For years, Remus was able to keep most of those thoughts at bay. He traveled the world, looking for a place to settle. Nothing ever felt right and whole but he didn’t dwell as much as he had been since stepping back on to the Hogwarts grounds. When he looked at the Gryffindor table, he couldn’t help but see four carefree boys scheming their next prank. When he would go down to visit Hagrid he remembered the time James nearly killed himself on the steps down the hill in the ice. When he would wander the halls in fits of insomnia he would look at each hallway and remember planning the map, hiding from Filch, or snogging Sirius. There was just so many memories, he was tempted to obliviate himself.</p><p>The feast ended and Remus went to go make his way back to his quarters. He was actually tired, and he hoped tonight he would get some sleep since he tended to want a lot as the moon approached. Except for tonight it didn’t look like he was going to get much sleep because he heard a commotion coming from the direction of Gryffindor. Remus groaned because for some reason, he knew it was going to have something to do with Harry. The boy, much like his father, had a knack for getting into the middle of trouble.</p><p>He headed that way, bumping into Minerva McGonagall. “Professor, what’s going on?”</p><p>“It’s,” She paused looking somewhat sad, “It’s Sirius Black, he’s gotten into the castle and tore the portrait of the Fat Lady to pieces.”</p><p>Remus closed his eyes and took a deep breath. If Sirius was innocent why was he coming into the castle with a knife? Why was he trying to get into the tower, if not to kill Harry? “Really? It was him?”</p><p>“She said so herself, dear,” Minerva patted his arm. “We need to search the castle. Oh! Professor Black, why don’t you and Professor Lupin take the dungeons.” She gave Remus a look as if to say Remus knew enough about them. “That is if you’re up to it?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m fine.” Remus said. He wasn’t sure if Minerva was referring to Sirius being back to possibly kill Harry him or the upcoming full upsetting him.</p><p>“Come on, Lupin.” Regulus looked more annoyed than anything. Surely his supposed evil brother coming back to kill one of his students was more than annoying. Maybe they were working together?</p><p>Remus pondered that as they searched through the nooks and crannies of the dungeon. They never got on, Sirius and Regulus. They were different sides of the same coin. Sometimes Remus wondered if it even was the same coin. Sirius seemed to resent his little brother for being the one that their parents loved. Deep down, Remus knew that Sirius wanted to have a brotherly relationship as they had when they were little. Remus and Sirius had talked about it at length a few times. It was one reason Remus thought he might have turned, for Regulus.</p><p>“It’s daft, isn’t it?” Regulus said, making Remus realize that the man had bad been speaking to him as they walked down a hallway.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Sending two people together who have the most connection to Sirius to search for him? It makes no sense, doesn’t it?” Regulus complained. “It could be both of us, it could be one of us.”</p><p>“I’m hoping that it’s neither of us.” Remus said, not looking at Regulus as he checked behind a tapestry. Too bad he didn’t have the map, it would have been much easier.</p><p>“It’s not me, Lupin.”</p><p>“It’s not me either,” He looked the younger Black in the eyes now.</p><p>“I’m here to protect Harry.”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>“Then let’s be sure to do that.” Regulus stopped to turn into a classroom. “You get the one across the hall.”</p><p>Remus agreed before going into the classroom across the way. He gave it the once over but knew Sirius wouldn’t be in there so he stopped for a moment. Sirius Black wasn’t stupid, he also knew every single secret passage around the grounds of Hogwarts. Plus, he was probably running around as Padfoot. Sirius was long gone now to who knows where unless Azkaban made him daft. That didn’t seem likely. Whatever Sirius was up to, good or evil, he had twelve long years to scheme and plan. Whatever he was up to, Remus had to protect Harry like he never had a chance to do so before.</p>
