    <p>Albus Severus Potter sat down in a compartment with his brother, James, and cousin, Rose. Outside the train on the platform, he waved to his parents and Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron. He watched as his father followed the train to the edge of the platform, waving all the while. Albus waved until he could no longer see his father.</p><p>James stretched out next to him.</p><p>“Finally off to Hogwarts, Al,” James smiled at him. “It’s all real now. No going back.”</p><p>Albus smiled back at him. “Excited for me to beat you in classes now that I’m here?”</p><p>James laughed. “If anyone will beat us, it’ll be Rosie here. I’m sure Aunt Hermione is all ready to have Rosie follow in her footsteps.”</p><p>Rosie rolled her eyes. “You’re just jealous that both Albus and I will outscore you on your exams from first year.”</p><p>James smiled, “Well I will admit, exams are not really my cup of tea.”</p><p>“Quidditch is his cup of tea,” Albus pretended to whisper to Rose.</p><p>She giggled. “Still can’t believe you thought you would get on the Quidditch team as a first year.”</p><p>James crossed his arms gloomily. “Dad did it.”</p><p>“Uncle Harry is Harry Potter,” said Rose, pulling a book out from her bag. “He did things you’ll never dream of.”</p><p>Albus smiled at his cousin. Albus liked quidditch, he was a big fan of the Brazilian Quidditch team, but he wasn’t sure if he wanted to play at Hogwarts yet. He thought it would be fun to play with James. Or against, if he was sorted into another house.</p><p>No, thought Albus, Dad said I could be Gryffindor if I wanted.</p><p>But, was that what he wanted?</p><p>Before he could continue that thought, the compartment door opened. It was another one of his cousins, Fred. Fred was a fourth year and James’ best friend. Albus had lost count of the amount of times his parents had received owls that reported on the amount of detentions James got with Fred. Uncle Ron had once said that James and Fred rivaled his older brothers, Uncle George and Uncle Fred, in pranking.</p><p>“But never let Uncle George here you say that.”</p><p>Fred and James high fived as Fred sat down next to James.</p><p>“A whole new year of pranks Jamie! I’ve come up with loads of ideas this summer!”</p><p>James reached under his seat and produced his backpack and began rummaging through it. “I’ve gotta show you something! I’ve just made our pranking life a lot easier!”</p><p>He produced a folded piece of parchment. It was an older piece of parchment and Albus recognized it immediately.</p><p>“James!” he gasped. “Dad’s gonna kill you. You aren’t even supposed to know about it!”</p><p>James smiled. “Dad’s not at Hogwarts anymore, and it was wasting away in his office. I’ll put it to better use than he would.”</p><p>Fred looked at the parchment quizzically. “What are you on about? It’s just parchment.”</p><p>“Au contraire, my friend, this is the greatest magical object in the world. Watch.” James pulled out his wand, with Fred and Rose leaning over to watch,  and tapped the parchment. “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”</p><p>Ink began to appear of the parchment, spelling out the phrase Albus was already acquainted with:</p><p align="center">

  <strong>
    <em> THE MARAUDER’S MAP </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>Fred’s draw dropped open. “WICKED!” He snatched the map and opened it up. He looked up at James with a mischievous gleam in his eyes. “We just became the most unstoppable pranksters ever.”</p><p>“Damn right!” James and Fred high fived.</p><p>Rose plucked the parchment from Fred’s hands. “This is advanced magic. I wonder where Uncle Harry got it from.”</p><p>“From my dad ‘course,” said Fred taking the map back. “Dad said he and Uncle Fred gave it to him in his third year.”</p><p>“Yeah but where did they get it? Who made it?”</p><p>Fred shrugged, “Said he nicked it from Filtch’s office. And who cares who made it? We have it now, that’s all that matters.”</p><p>Rose looked like she was going to add something, but the compartment door opened again. James quickly muttered “Mischief Managed” and shoved the parchment back into his bag. The two newcomers were two more of their cousins, Molly and Lucy. They were Uncle Percy and Aunt Audrey’s children. Molly was a sixth year and was the captain for the Hufflepuff House quidditch team. Lucy was a fifth year and had just been appointed a prefect for Hufflepuff.</p><p>“We wanted to come see how you were settling in,” said Molly to Rose and Albus. “These two aren’t trying to corrupt you already are they?”</p><p>James scoffed. “You act as if I’m a horrible role model.”</p><p>“You are,” rang the compartment. James glared grumply at his cousins and brother.</p><p>“I’m not afraid to send an owl to Uncle Harry and Uncle George,” said Lucy. “Or take house points from you two.”</p><p>“We’ll be perfect angels this year, Lu,” Fred said and crossed an X over his heart. “Promise.”</p><p>Lucy and Molly exchanged looks. “Alright well, see you at the feast.”</p><p>As the left, Fred raised his hand, where he had his fingers crossed. “Promise negated.”</p><p>///</p><p>The rest of the ride was pleasant with Fred and James discussing pranks, as well as the recent quidditch matches with Albus. As the sun began to fall, they quickly changed into their school robes.</p><p>When the train finally pulled into Hogsmeade Station, Fred and James said goodbye.</p><p>“Hey Al, hold up!” Albus turned back to James.</p><p>“He’ll catch up with you Rosie.” Rose nodded and started off to get off the train. James looked down at Albus.</p><p>“I know I was giving you a hard time about the Slytherin thing earlier but, i dont care what house you’re in. Whatever that hat says you are, then that’s it.”</p><p>Albus bit his lip, his worry returning. “But.. you know how everyone-”</p><p>“Yeah, Slytherins have a bad rep but if you get sorted in you’ll be the first great one ok? Just trust the hat.”</p><p>“Ok.”</p><p>James ruffled his brother’s hair. “Go on or you’ll be swimming to Hogwarts.”</p><p>Albus laughed, punching James in the shoulder and ran off the train. He saw Hagrid immediately and made his way over, finding Rose standing close by. Hagrid saw Albus and waved at him.</p><p>“All ‘ght you lot! Follow me to teh boats! Wa’ch yer step now!”</p><p>Hagrid led them to small four-person boats. Albus and Rose secured a boat with a red haired girl and a boy with deep dark skin.</p><p>As the boats began to move, Rose whispered to Albus, “That’s Draco Malfoy’s son.” She indicated to a platinum haired boy in the next boat over.</p><p>“Whose that?”</p><p>Rose stared at him. “Draco Malfoy? The guy your dad went to school with? The.. you know.. <em> Death Eater </em>.” She whispered the last part of the sentence.</p><p>“Oh.” Albus did remember Draco Malfoy. He remembered one summer after James’ first year and he had commented on the Malfoys. Albus’s dad had told James that he shouldn’t judge people on their past, but on what they were now.</p><p>Albus looked over at the platinum haired boy. He saw that the boy was quite pale, and that his hair wasn't platinum, but just very light blonde. He wasn’t talking to the others in his boat, just holding the lanter and looking ahead.</p><p>Albus heard the first round of gasps and knew they were coming into view of the castle. Albus glanced up and joined the chorus of gasps. The castle, which he had seen multiple pictures of, was nothing but extraordinary. It seemed to radiate magic. It was alite from every window and looked gorgeous against the night sky.  </p><p>Albus’s face broke into a smile as he gazed up at his new home.</p>
