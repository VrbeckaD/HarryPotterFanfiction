    <p>The meetings were supposed to be helping them.</p><p>At least that's what old McGonagall kept saying every time he threatened to not come back, which admittingly happened after nearly every session. Still, he came back, grumbling under his breath but taking the same chair in the same place around the circle with the other handful of Year 8 Gryffindor and Slytherin students working through their issues together.</p><p>Draco Malfoy refused to call them what the flyers around the school did- suggested group therapy. Besides it being an obviously Muggle term, calling the meetings anything more than that would only add to the shame he was already carrying. There had to be therapy because there had been a battle, at his school, with him on the wrong side for most of it.</p><p>That none of the students had quit yet was a shock to him, but he assumed the Headmistress had a lot to do with the attendance.A year ago, many of those now gathered hated each other and he was pretty sure more a couple of them still harbored anger towards him if the glares that followed him when he took his seat were any indication.</p><p>He had tried to leave, damn near begging McGonagall to at least let him into the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff group where he sure cooler heads prevailed. Of course, she didn't listen to his complaints, only offered him a biscuit before leading him back into the classroom where everyone else was waiting.</p><p>"Mr. Malfoy?" He looked up startled to see the Headmistress looking down at him with one eyebrow raised. "Did you hear me? The group is splitting into partners for this next exercise."</p><p>"Partners?"</p><p>"Yes, <em>partners</em>. As I was saying, it now it looks like Mr. Weasley is without someone to work with," she said crossly.</p><p>Ron Weasley looked back at him with wide eyes before he started scooting his chair closer to where Dean Thomas and Pansy Parkinson were sitting together. McGonagall turned to chastise the now sputtering ginger before brandishing her wand to scoot his own chair across to where Ron sat.</p><p>"Ah, that's better. Now, turn to your partners. Your <em>exercise</em> partner, Mr. Finnigan, I'm sure Mr. Thomas will do just fine without you. Attached under your chairs you will find a series of questions. For the first round, the Gryffindors will be asking the questions and listening <em>with intention</em> to the answers. I will be monitoring and available for anyone who needs it. You may begin," she paused to turn an hourglass on the desk beside her. "<em>Now</em>."</p><p>At first, neither Ron nor he said anything, both looking down in their own laps. He was sure Weasley hated him most of all and as much as Draco did want to move past a lot of what happened during the war, he wasn't sure if this was the right place to start. The group was five sessions in and through that time, neither of them had spoken much more than they were forced to by the Headmistress. They hadn't said a word to each other since the start of the term.</p><p>Draco heard the sounds of parchment opening and snuck a look up to see Ron frowning at the page.</p><p>"Problem?" he asked.</p><p>That earned him another heated glare. Draco suppressed a sigh and slipped his hands under his legs as his gaze went back down to examine the floor.</p><p>"Alright. Let's get this over with, eh. Question one- er- well that's not a question, really but er-," Ron's knees were bouncing as he spoke. Draco kept his focus on them to avoid looking up again. "Number one- Tell me of a time you have felt unwanted."</p><p>Draco felt his back stiffen at the bluntness of the question. So far in the group, they had skirted around most issues, focusing more on the present concerns as Year 8 students and except for the time Lavender Brown had broken down talking about her lycanthropy, discussions had remained relatively on the surface.</p><p>He swallowed hard, deciding in that moment to just give in to the honesty expected of him and met Ron's hard stare again. "A time I felt unwanted? It would be easier to list the times I've felt wanted. It would certainly take less time."</p><p>McGonagall chose that moment to walk back where Draco and Ron sat staring awkwardly at each other, her hand reaching out to grasp the other wizard's shoulder. She knelt down to whisper something in his ear, which Ron quickly repeated, and walked back to another section of the room.</p><p>"When was the <em>last</em> time you felt unwanted?"</p><p>A hot, prickling sensation hit the back of his neck. Draco pushed his chin forward, gathering the courage to say the thing he'd been trying to convey for a while now when asking to leave the group meetings. "I feel unwanted in every room I walk into. This one most especially. I deserve that, I suppose… for what I did. Still doesn't feel nice."</p><p>To his credit, Ron blinked but said nothing more. After a moment, he looked down at the parchment and asked the next question. "Er- number two: What has been the most challenging part of being back at Hogwarts?"</p><p>Draco thought about lying. He thought about slipping into his old smirk and making a comment about never being challenged enough. He thought better of it.</p><p>With his hands pressing more firmly against the chair as leaned more of his weight on them, he said softly, "It should look different than it does. I keep seeing corridors and alcoves I know I fought in ...and they made them look just like before. Slughorn even has me re-taking Astronomy. I'll probably fail it because I can't go up there for observations at night." He took a deep breath before continuing, the look in Ron's eyes softer than he'd seen before. "No one should have to be up there."</p><p>A new type of silence stretched on between them. Draco could hear sniffles and shaking voices in the room around him but he couldn't make his head turn to see which of his classmates were making the sounds.</p><p>Ron fumbled the parchment sheet in his left hand again, his free hand reaching up to rub the side of his nose. He seemed more hesitant to ask the next question. After another minute of his twitching reluctance, so Draco pulled one hand from where it had been tucked and leaned forward to gently take the sheet away.</p><p>There on the page was written: <em>What regrets do you think about the most?</em></p><p>"I don't want to answer that."</p><p>Ron nodded. "I didn't want to ask it."</p><p>A chime sounded to indicate time to switch asker and listener but they stayed quiet. This time without anger or unwillingness but with an unspoken agreement to simply sit together. Draco watched as Ron continued to rub the side of his nose every few minutes. The third time he went to repeat the nervous gesture, Draco almost darted his own hand out to stop him, but thankfully he hesitated and the Gryffindor didn't seem to notice.</p><p>At last, he spoke, leaning forward again to catch Ron's attention. "I think what you did was brave, you know. You saved us...right along with Potter and Granger."</p><p>Ron shrugged and then nodded, his light eyes watering a bit, a detail Draco might not have noticed if they hadn't spent the past several minutes staring at each other.</p><p>"You did good, too, Malfoy. We could- I should- treat you better for it." Ron fumbled with the edges of his sleeve for a moment, looking up with a grim expression after a while. "I've just needed someone to be angry at. 'Suppose I was used to that being you."</p><p>A wry smile twisted Draco's lips. "Yeah, we had a good thing going over the years. As far as school rivalries are concerned."</p><p>Ron twisted his head to one side, he followed where he was looking. Professor McGonagall was standing back at the desk as she scanned over the small groups. "She wants us all to be friends now."</p><p>"Bugger her," he joked.</p><p>A scoff that almost could have been a chuckle sounded from Ron. He didn't say anything else but Draco could feel the tension lessening between them, if only a fraction.</p><p>An idea struck him, one he was sure would be turned down but he felt compelled to try it anyway. After cleared his throat, Draco shifted position, sliding down in the chair in a more stance that made him almost feel like his old self. Carefully he folded the page shut and then again until it made a neat square shape. "You think if we asked the Headmistress together she'd let us out of here early?"</p><p>Ron gave him a confused look, his eyebrows drawing together. "And do what?"</p><p>"I haven't beaten you at the pitch in a while. How about some keeper practice rounds? Loser buys the winner a round at the next Hogsmeade weekend."</p><p>The way Ron lit up at his suggestion made the entire uncomfortable session of forced conversion worth it. "You're going down, Malfoy!"</p><p>His hand shot into the air, waving their Headmistress over with renewed enthusiasm while Draco stuck the parchment sheet back under his own seat and grinned. <em>Maybe group therapy isn't so bad after all.</em></p>
