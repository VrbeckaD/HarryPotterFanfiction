<p>
I realized immediately something was very very wrong.</p>
<p>
I also realized I'd have to take stock of this later and needed to get away NOW.</p>
<p>
I spread my wings and darted off at my best rate of speed, folding my legs close to my body to increase my speed. I had a glimpse of a very startled technician's face as I zipped past him through the ICU doors he'd just opened.</p>
<p>
I darted around obstacles quickly and paid attention to the instinct that kept telling me to head up. All the windows were closed, hospital after all, but there were stairs leading up to a fire door that I found quickly.</p>
<p>
I opened my mouth, blasted a hole through the door, then went through and rapidly darted around as quickly as I could.</p>
<p>
It wasn't until I came to a stop on a tree branch about three miles from the hospital that I was able to crane my neck and determine what exactly I was.</p>
<p>
I was maybe a foot long, counting a long neck and tail. Other than that, I was about the size of a pigeon. A six-limbed pigeon with grasping talons on my forelimbs as well as my rear limbs. Not quite bat-wings.</p>
<p>
Good color vision. In fact, I was getting a bit of a headache from extra colors and information. I'd find a place to sleep some and finish adapting, but first I needed to find something to eat.</p>
<p>
What DID I eat? I ran my tongue over my teeth to check. Pointy teeth in front, flattened teeth in back. Omnivore, probably. Huh.</p>
<p>
There were skyscrapers nearby. So I quickly took to the air again, sailed around briefly and caught thermals in order to conserve energy, spotted a pigeon that was almost as big as me, then did what came natural. Instincts rose to the occasion. Apparently I ate things that I cooked with my own fire. Needed some practice though, as my first shot ended up with the pigeon getting a hole drilled through it and bursting into flame thereafter.</p>
<p>
Apparently dragonfire was more like the exhaust of a fighter jet than a flamethrower. It hadn't been obvious to me in my need for escape when I'd gone through that door to the roof, but I'd probably slowed by more than half by throwing that fire-beam out. I had to wonder how freaking hot it was when I thought about it. Metal doors meant to contain fires shouldn't have holes melted in them by a fire, should they?</p>
<p>
What WAS the melting point of steel anyway? That might give me an idea of how hot the concentrated flame was.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, as a small dragon - there wasn't much I could do about looking up such information. I'd imagine libraries would at the very least look askance at a fire-breathing anything that showed up on their doorstep.</p>
<p>
I sighed, sending a puff of smoke out, then finished off the second pigeon I'd managed to bring down. The first one, of course, more resembled a messy piece of charcoal.</p>
<p>
Well, at least there were plenty of pigeons about. I'd probably need to grab another and then sleep to digest them. One good thing about being this size was the number of hidey-holes one could use to take a quick nap in.</p>
<p>

<p>
There was a moment of disorientation when I woke, but I was able to crawl out of the drainpipe on the roof of the bank building and stretch myself. I heard a buzzing noise briefly and then spotted a camera.</p>
<p>
I have my mischievous moments. I went to a position clearly in view of the thing, stretching out legs and tail and wings briefly. Then I attempted to say something about what a big eye it had.</p>
<p>
What emerged from my mouth was a hiss, a gronk sort-of-noise, and finally a bird-like trill.</p>
<p>
Okay, I was going to need practice to speak or else I didn't have the right kind of vocal chords. Lovely.</p>
<p>
So I rose to my hind-legs, mimed that I had a hat, and did the frog routine from the old Warner Brothers cartoons. THAT should be surreal enough that even if they were watching a livefeed, they weren't going to believe their eyes. I believe the approach is called "Refuge In Audacity" and it sometimes works.</p>
<p>
Following that, I leapt off the roof and spread my wings to catch an updraft.</p>
<p>
Let's see. Oooh. A paper blowing in the wind. Might give me some much-needed information.</p>
<p>
I missed it the first time. It was entirely too easy to lose track of instinct and the result was I'd barely managed to stop myself from crashing in on a board meeting on the seventh floor of a nearby building.</p>
<p>
Literally.</p>
<p>
Finally I did manage to catch the thing in my mouth and glide to a table outside a street-level cafe where I could spread it out and read the thing.</p>
<p>
"Uhm, excuse me?" asked someone with a cup of coffee halfway to his mouth.</p>
<p>
Unable to actually say anything, I simply trilled at him, smiled briefly then tried to read. May 27, 1985. Paper didn't look too old so probably within a week of that date.</p>
<p>
"Excuse me, but are you... a dragon?" asked the businessman.</p>
<p>
I turned my head to him, nodded, and went back to look at the paper. Not really enough data to compare with any of the worlds I'd previously been on, and I wasn't that familiar with British news anyway. Bangladesh had been hit by a cyclone and was still mopping up.</p>
<p>
There was a smash of glass and both me and the businessman turned to a waitress who was standing there holding nothing in her hands. There were the remains of a coffee decanter near her feet though.</p>
<p>
I trilled briefly at her, trying to convey an apology for disturbing her day.</p>
<p>
"Well, at least you're a polite dragon," said the businessman.</p>
<p>
I nodded at him again before I leapt up and began beating my wings again, rapidly leaving the cafe behind. Maybe I could find my mission objective. Have to see what resources I could scrape together.</p>
<p>
Now there was -</p>
<p>
[Ping! File Recovery!]</p>
<p>
I almost collided with a window, though I recovered quickly and found a place to land that was a bit out of the way.</p>
<p>
[Status Screen Recovered]</p>
<p>
Okay, that was hopeful.</p>
<p>
[Race: Greater Dragon - Celestial Sundrake]<br/>
[Category: Hatchling]</p>
<p>
Okay, that wasn't particularly helpful. Greater Dragon just meant that there was a local species of dragon that was not sentient. Either that or there were wyverns or something.</p>
<p>
Let's see. Maybe if I...</p>

<p>

<p>
I wondered about that Telepathy because not being able to speak at all was going to be a major pain. What limits? And I had a poison in my bite?</p>
<p>
A breath weapon that was purifying fire? Made sense for a celestial creature that could be expected to encounter intrusions from a lower plane but how did that actually work?</p>
<p>
Well, if I could choose my spell domains, I'd go with Sun and Healing.</p>
<p>
For now though, I had both eaten and slept. I had now an idea of WHERE and WHEN I was. I now needed to find out where I was supposed to go.</p>
<p>
It was going to be rather difficult keeping a low profile though.</p>
<p>
I settled into a good spot and then wove magic into a form that felt right. Show The Path, which was a fairly simple spell that lacked the precision of a typical divination spell.</p>
<p>
This might take awhile though. Fortunately, being as small and unremarkable as I was - it would be fairly easy to fly under the radar. So to speak.</p>
