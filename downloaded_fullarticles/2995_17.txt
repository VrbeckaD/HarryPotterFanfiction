    <p><u></u>“So, tell us, Granger. Who’s the lucky sod?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione glanced up hesitantly from the book she’d been absorbed in mere seconds before. She instantly regretted her decision to study in the Gryffindor common room. Had she cloistered herself away at her favourite table in the library, she knew she would not now be gazing up into the laughing eyes of Fred and George.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Beg pardon?” Hermione posited, attempting to look befuddled. She had a fairly good notion what they were on about, but she didn’t need <em>them</em> knowing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fred looked cheekily at his brother before taking Hermione’s book, casually leafing through it. “Look at that, Gred. The brightest witch of her age, trying to play dumb.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Now, Forge, she’s got a right to play dumb. She doesn’t know we’re ‘in the loop,’ as it were.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione took a deep breath, roughly yanked her book back from Fred, and chose to address only George, steadily feeling the heat rising up her neck and into her face. “In the loop?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, come off it, Granger. We know you’re in love with some bloke, who clearly hasn’t been giving you the time of day.” Fred stated. “What we don’t know—”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Is who it is, and why the bloody hell you asked Neville to help you make the fella jealous.” George completed, grin steadily widening. At this, both boys descended upon her with a barrage of inquiries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So who is it?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And why didn’t you just ask us for help?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We’d serve much better in that capacity.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Right! You could use one of us.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Or both."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We wouldn’t mind.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione’s head was spinning, and she was beginning to feel nauseated. Of all the people for Neville to tell, it had to be the Weasley twins. “Why on earth is he telling people? When I get through with Neville, he won’t know a Mandrake from Dittany, and he’ll likely need the Dittany!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In one swift movement, she found herself quite unceremoniously lifted into the air, before being pulled back into the seat from which she’d just been removed. Fred had pulled her into his lap, and had comfortably wrapped his arms around her waist. She found she liked this situation, perhaps a bit too much. At this thought, she realized she didn’t wish for Fred to know how much she was enjoying being wrapped up in his arms. However, as she struggled to extricate herself, she found his strong arms held her firmly in place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Now, now. Can’t have you harming Neville. He wanted advice, and we were all too happy to help.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having given up on freeing herself, Hermione relaxed into Fred’s embrace, but his grip stayed just as firm. Clearly, she would not be going anywhere any time soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>George sat across from the two, a look of sincerity on his face. “Granger. Neville wasn’t a good choice for this task. He’s overly anxious around birds, at the best of times. What with Umbridge stomping about these days, he’s even more of a quaking pup than usual. Let Freddy help you out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I thought you said I could have both of you, if I wanted.” Hermione narrowed her eyes at George. Generally, when he became serious, he was genuine, but just now, she wasn’t sure whether or not she ought to trust him. Never mind the fact that Fred would most certainly <em>not</em> be helpful in this capacity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, ordinarily you could, but Angelina and I just started dating, and I don’t think she’d overly care for it much.” George rubbed the back of his neck, looking shockingly contrite.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione felt her hair being brushed to the side, and glanced behind her at the still smirking Fred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Don’t worry. You’ve still got me, and I’ll do a bang up job. I do think it might help the act if I knew who you’re aiming to turn green.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At that moment, Ron and Harry traipsed into the common room, laughing boisterously. Something about yet another run-in with Malfoy, from the sounds of it. Ron turned to see Hermione then, still sat in his older brother’s lap. Hermione had only seen Ron turn this particular shade of fuchsia once or twice previously. Seeing the look in Ron’s eye, an idea began formulating quickly in her mind. She did not, however, have time to tell Fred of her plans. So Hermione Granger, intelligent as she was, rapidly whipped herself around, and planted a kiss firmly on Fred’s mouth. Luckily, he went along with it, releasing her once the kiss had ended. She grabbed her things, and escaped to the girls’ dormitory steps, yelling over her shoulder to the twins that she’d see them later.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione could hear Ron yelling, even from the door to her dorm room. This would surely be a mess, she knew, but if she worked the angle right, perhaps this <em>would</em> work out better than had she utilized Neville’s assistance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The key would be to not let Fred know that Ron was not the target of her affections, but rather, it was Fred himself. At least, not for now.</p>
