    <p>It was a taxing day, and some of his body parts still hurt. Sighing, Remus opened the door. Sirius, James and Peter were already awake, and were crowded around a book. Remus glanced at the title, and swallowed. They knew. They knew. They knew.....</p>
<p>"You know." he managed to whisper "You know what I am."</p>
<p>He wanted nothing more than to pretend it never happened. He sat down on the bed. He felt like he was going to faint.</p>
<p>Sirius, James and Peter surrounded him in an instant.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it. We won't tell a soul." Sirius promised "And if anyone finds out, we'll make sure they won't tell either."</p>
<p>"I have a better idea." James said "Why don't we swear an oath? An oath of friendship. An oath of Marauders."</p>
<p>"What kind of oath?" Remus raised his head, somewhat interesting."</p>
<p>"I swear to stick by my friends through thick and thin." James grinned "No matter what."</p>
<p>"I swear never to abandon a friend in need." Sirius joined in "No matter what that need may be."</p>
<p>"I swear never to run away from this responsibility." Peter said "To find the courage to uphold it."</p>
<p>"I swear I will remain true." Remus concluded "Until the bitter end."</p>
<p>"We solemnly swear." all four said "The Oath of Marauders. Our oath of friendship."</p>
<p>Then Sirius, James and Peter turned to look at Remus once more.</p>
<p>"It's time for class." Remus pointed out "You need to be there."</p>
<p>"We just swore never to abandon a friend in need." Sirius said bluntly</p>
<p>"And right now, that's you." James added</p>
<p>"The next class is Potions." Peter said "I could ask Lily......for it. I can help in my own way."</p>
<p>"Right." James nodded "You go do it. We'll keep the fort here."</p>
<p>With a nod, Peter gathered his things and left the dorm.</p>
<p>The doors closed, and Remus opened his mouth to say something, but Sirius shut him up.</p>
<p>"You helped us." Sirius said "You helped me overcome my fear of my family's reaction."</p>
<p>"You helped me with homework." James added "And when Peter was bullied, you saved him from that."</p>
<p>"So let us help you in return." Sirius gave him an earnest look "Let us help you deal with your little problem."</p>
<p>"A furry little problem." James corrected </p>
<p>And Remus laughed.</p>
<p>"You need to laugh more often." Sirius announced "And we'll make sure you do."</p>
