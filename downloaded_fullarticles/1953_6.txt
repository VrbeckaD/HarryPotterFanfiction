    <p>“Ugh, I’m so glad you’re here, I am exhausted” Theo groaned as he saw Hermione sitting down in front of him</p><p>“Sorry, sorry I’m late, Pansy kept insisting for another 5 minutes of cuddling and I can’t say no to her” Hermione took off her jacket and sat down </p><p>“No, it’s fine. What are they doing tonight?”</p><p>“Well, Pansy will be going out with Draco to the bar again to flirt with Harry, Blaise and Ron will be there with Harry, as planned, and Ginny’s there just for the Firewhiskey. I’m just too tired to participate in it”</p><p>“Thank Merlin, I know it was a last minute plan but I don’t know who else to call, and I know Pansy likes to matchmake a lot so I don’t wanna interrupt her scheme” Theo rolled his eyes and sipped on his margarita, which he has also ordered one for Hermione. They have all been friends since Hogwarts, magically, but it may have something to do with their jobs, Harry and Ron have become Aurors as expected, Pansy and Luna were journalists and editors for The Quibbler while Hermione, Theo and Draco were Healers at St. Mungo, and Ginny has been coaching Quidditch at Hogwarts, plus Pansy and Hermione have been a couple now, it was a surprise to see them all this close, Theo would call it a miracle </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s fine, she’ll understand” Hermione took a sip on her cocktail and said “It’s been a year, and they are still pining over each other, I don’t understand, even Pansy and I become a couple before them, then Blaise and Ron, it’s just…they are so stubborn” She mumbled and pinched the bridge of her nose</p><p>“Tell me about it. This is why I called you here so we can have a private gossip night together” Theo sighed and received a text from Ginny from his Muggle phone “Ugh, Ginny is trying to set me up with another, again. Why did you teach her to use a Muggle phone?”</p><p>“Because she insisted” Hermione rolled her eyes and laughed “But seriously, you’ve been playing the field for quite long now” </p><p>“I do not” He mumbled and the waiter arrived, he had ordered steak and fries while Hermione just wanted an Fettuccine Alfredo, after they were done ordering their food, someone walked in and Theo completely went frozen on the spot</p><p>“Theo?” Hermione called “What is it?” </p><p>“Is that…?” He pointed to the door and Hermione turned around, she gasped a bit as well</p><p>“Oh my god it’s Neville” She turned back and whispered “I haven’t seen him in…years, well, Ginny did mention him to me sometimes, Pansy said he was teaching Herbology at Hogwarts since she visited there a few times” But Theo? No…he hasn’t seen him in… a long long time, he has changed, a lot, he still has that shy vibes going on, but he looked so mature, he was wearing a deep blue tailored suit and his hair was much better than before. He was smiling and—</p><p>“Oh” Theo said and Hermione turned around again, she reacted the same</p><p>“Oh” She repeated. He looked again at them, he was leading another brunette bloke behind him into the restaurant, they seemed…lovey-dovey…like a couple, they were coming in their direction, oh shi—</p><p>“Hermione” Neville said suddenly and Hermione stood up, hugging him</p><p>“Neville, I haven’t seen you for so long. How are you?” She smiled and he kissed her cheek in a friendly way</p><p>“Oh I’m good, really, Ginny told me about you guys a lot” Neville beamed and turned to Theo, who was still sitting, he looked up at Neville and put up his best smile, the charming one he always used for blokes, he stood up gracefully and looked at Neville</p><p>“Skip the formal stuff, call me Theo” He said and Neville stood there, staring at him, and oh he knew that look, the look blokes always gave him when they first saw Theo, but there was something else in Neville’s eyes that Theo couldn’t quite grasp, something else…</p><p>“The-Theodore Nott…” He stuttered and held out a hand, Theo looked down at his hand and arched an eyebrow</p><p>“Really?” He said and stepped forward to pull Neville in a hug, he hugged Neville tightly and finally let go when he heard someone clearing their throat</p><p>“Oh, you must be…his friend?” He said. Why did he say that? The guy looked kinda like him, a brunette, good fashion sense but was showing it off way too much, even fashion knew its limits. And his eyeliner was way off, he didn’t know why he got like this? He knew the guy was Neville’s boyfriend </p><p>“I’m his boyfriend” The guy said and glared at Theo, then he pulled Neville back so they stood close together while Hermione just stood there looking at the three of them…</p><p>“Oh…this is…my boyfriend, Alex” Neville said </p><p>“Alex” Theo repeated and smiled brightly “What a nice name” He said and sat down with Hermione, then Neville and…Alex sat down as well, and not surprising at all when Theo saw that their table was right next to his. He tried to focus back by began talking to Hermione again</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>“…-and I said that ‘Just put them in a room’ then, but Pansy wanted to make up this crazy plan to make them meet each other repeatedly like it’s a coincidence, sometimes I’m afraid of how my girlfriend’s mine works” Hermione chuckled</p><p>“But you love her” </p><p>“But I love her” Hermione smiled and blushed lightly, messing with her empty plate</p><p>“Oh you’ve become a pillow princess because of Pansy, haven’t you?” Theo grinned and accidentally pushed his knife on the ground, Neville saw it and it was on his right, so both of them bent down to pick it up, sure their hands might have touched…just for a bit though, before Theo looked up at Neville and thanked him, then he looked to the other guy and Alex was glaring at him intensely. He turned back to Hermione and she stared a him before pushing her knife on the ground to her right</p><p>“Theo, would you mind pick my knife up with me?” Hermione smiled and signalled him to bent down</p><p>“Are you flirting with Neville?” Hermione’s eyes widened and she whispered at him</p><p>“What? No!” Theo protested “I didn’t”</p><p>“Seriously? You hugged him! And ‘You must be his friend?’, not to mention ‘What a nice name’? I know your sarcastic voice, you are flirting with him” She smacked his arm and he hissed</p><p>“I am not” He snapped “It’s just…when it comes to guys, I just automatically act like that, plus, that Alex is glaring at me every single second like I was going to eat Neville up”</p><p>“You are!” Hermione glared at him “Stop! If Neville is single, then I approve, but he’s not, so Theo, stop. I think Pansy have mentioned you having a thing for Neville in Eighth Year but I didn’t think it was true, so for the love of Merlin, keep it in your pants” She whispered softly</p><p>“Okay, I won’t” He finally softened up and continued “But just so you know, talking like this, Neville could very well see my arse and we all know everyone loves my arse” He grinned wickedly and Hermione shushed him before getting on the table again</p><p>“Ah, found it” She said and turned to Neville’s table, giving them a lopsided smile “It was really hard to find”</p><p>“Yeah, sure” Theo snorted and Hermione glared again “Anyway, remember my ex boyfriend? Sam?”</p><p>“The blonde one?” Hermione asked and he nodded “The super clingy one? Won’t stop calling you and standing at your door when you got home? And you have to call Blaise and Ron so they’d go home with you? The one that cried in the middle of Diagon Alley when you broke up with him? The one that hugged your leg and won’t let go? Until Pansy immobilised him?” He nodded again “The one that I said you should have the Auror banned him from coming too close to you?” He rolled his eyes and laughed </p><p>“Yes, that one” He sipped on his red wine and sighed “I know I’m a piece of art, but that guy is just too crazy” </p><p>“He has always been crazy” Hermione said “We all said that, but noooo, you stayed because he has a…”</p><p>“Big cock” Theo said and Neville choked on his wine, both Hermione and him turned to look at Neville, who was coughing like crazy, his boyfriend, Alex, turned and glared at Theo, again. What was his problem?</p><p>“But seriously, you have got to see it, it’s so huge, like…okay sure every ex boyfriend of mine has a big cock, but he was so good at sex, I swear I couldn’t help screaming when I cam-…”</p><p>“Neville what’s wrong with you?” Alex shrieked and leaned over since Neville was coughing again</p><p>“Are you alright?” Theo extended his hand and put it on Neville’s shoulder, he nodded at Theo and couldn’t even meet his eyes, Alex remained there and stared at Theo’s hand on his shoulder, so he retreated it again and turned to Hermione</p><p>“That doesn’t matter, Theo” She said “The point is, he’s crazy, and you deserve better”</p><p>“Yes, I know, but you know, maybe getting back together with him…”</p><p>“No!” She warned him “No, well it’s lucky that he doesn’t have anger issue, or else it’d be one of those stalker that can’t get over their exes” </p><p>“Alright, I won’t, but Hermione, this is the longest time I’ve gone without a boyfriend, I miss the feeling of…it…buried deep inside me” He mumbled and sighed dramatically </p><p>“Okay horny boy” Hermione laughed “Maybe it’s good for you, you being single…may make it better, people will want you more?”</p><p>“I guess” He frowned and messed with his fork “Maybe what I need is a guy that could stick”</p><p>“Of course, and I’ve seen at least five guys that can’t stop looking at you since we got here” She winked and waved at the waiter “Even the married ones. What dessert do you want?”</p><p>“Really? And the chocolate lava cake, she’ll have the chocolate soufflé” He told the waiter and Hermione nodded at him “Well, obviously, I have my charm”</p><p>“Yes, I know” Hermione rolled her eyes “I have seen a patient asking for your name…while being examined” She let out a playful laugh </p><p>“Oh yeah, I remember that, it was s—…”</p><p>“Will you marry me?” Theo’s eyes widened and turned to look at Neville, who was kneeling on the ground with a ring on his hand, even Hermione let out a big gasp. Some of the people there even looked at them, Neville was smiling brightly and Theo wondered when would he be able to be on Alex’s position, being proposed to…probably a long time</p><p>“No” Alex replied and the people in the restaurant gasped, Hermione made a small “Oh” sound and Theo looked at Neville’s face, his smile dropped and there was definitely a frown there instead</p><p>“What? Why?” He stuttered and Alex stood up, grabbing his jacket</p><p>“I’m sorry, Neville, actually, I was going to break up with you today” Wow, Theo did not expect that “I…I’m seeing someone else”</p><p>“Oh no” Hermione whispered but Theo couldn’t care about her, all he saw was Neville’s face, which looked distressful</p><p>“Good bye” Alex said and walked out of the restaurant, leaving Neville still kneeling on the ground, other people have got back to eating but Hermione and Theo were still looking at him. He finally sat back in his chair and sighed</p><p>“Oh Neville” Hermione said and switched her sit to the chair Alex sat earlier, she grabbed his hands and Theo remained in his spot</p><p>“I’m so sorry” She said and Neville shook his head</p><p>“No…no, I should have known” He laughed sadly and messed around with the ring box “No one goes to the gym that much, you know?”</p><p>“Don’t be sad, Neville, you deserve better” She comforted him and he nodded, then her phone rang and she answered the call</p><p>“Hey…yeah? What’s wrong?.....What? I’ll be right there, hang on” She ended the call and put her phone in her purse, Theo stood up and asked</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Harry got into a fight at the pub, a mistake in Pansy’s plan, that’s all Ginny told me, I have to go there now”</p><p>“I’ll come with you”</p><p>“No, no, stay” She said and titled her head down, signalling to Neville, who was looking down on his ring quietly “You do that…I’ll go and tell you everything later” </p><p>“But—…” It was too late, Hermione rushed out of the restaurant and disappeared quickly. Theo sighed and looked back on their table, the waiter had just come with their desserts, Theo’s chocolate lava cake and Hermione’s chocolate soufflé, he then looked to Neville, who was still acting all quiet. Alright, no big deal, just…dealing with sad people, he was never good at it, once Daphne cried over a breakup she had and he had said ‘I’m so sorry Daphne, do you want to go have lunch with me and my boyfriend?’, which apparently only made her cry louder and began throwing stuff, so no, he was never good at comforting people, but he could at least try, right?<br/>
Theo cleared his throat and pulled his chair closer to Neville’s, then he sat down and leaned over, whispering to him</p><p>“Don’t worry, you’ll get over it” He began rubbing Neville’s back in circles and Neville wiped his face with his hand, Theo began panicking “Oh no, are you crying?”</p><p>“No, no, it’s just…” Neville replied, still keeping his head down “I can’t help it” </p><p>“No, it’s alright, I cry all the time” Theo said, well he lied, he didn’t cry much, but he had dealt with crying people a lot, he cupped Neville’s face and face him, Neville’s eyes were watery and he couldn’t help but feel sad over it, so he wiped the tears off by his thumbs and shushed him</p><p>“It’s alright, it’ll be okay” He said softly and pulled Neville into his arm, Neville’s head was now buried in his neck, his tears were on Theo’s new shirt he had just bought this morning, but it was for a good cause…right? Pansy always did this stuff when someone cried, she would wipe their tears and hugged them, then she would kiss their foreheads and said soothing stuff, Pansy might look like she didn’t care, but it was rather the opposite, she always care, that was why she made this plan to matchmake Harry and Draco up, maybe he could learn a few things from her</p><p>“Are you okay?” He whispered into Neville’s ears and he nodded, then he tilted his head up and…kissed his forehead, he pressed his lips on Neville’s smooth forehead and gave him a kiss, then he smiled</p><p>“He doesn’t deserve it, it’s a waste of time to stay with someone like that. Plus, he has horrible fashion sense” He said and Neville huffed out a sad laugh</p><p>“Look, I see the way he treated you, okay?” Theo finally said it out loud, and yes, he did notice it, he was observant, that was all “He’s controlling, he ordered for you, when you said you wanted steak, he ordered salmon for you, he told you which wine should you drink, which food should you eat, which dessert should you have, and I’m pretty sure this suit was a result of his decision” </p><p>“Yeah” Neville answered “He said I’d look better in this”</p><p>“See? He’s very controlling, and I even see him gawking at the waiter, that’s not a good boyfriend, Neville, he even glared at you for saying stuff about your plants, I don’t think I’ve heard you telling any story of you at Hogwarts to him, only him telling about himself, he expected you to care about him, but he didn’t even bat an eyelid when you choke on that wine, I think he even snapped at you”</p><p>“He said he doesn’t want me to talk about work” He mumbled softly and Theo shook his head</p><p>“See? That’s the problem, he took you for granted” Theo grabbed Neville’s hand and held it tightly “Okay, you know what? I’m going to make you forget about him”</p><p>“How?” </p><p>“Well…okay, eat” He took his dessert plates from his table and put it on Neville’s table, the he took a big piece of Hermione’s chocolate soufflé and brought it up to in front of the blonde’s face</p><p>“Come on, eat”</p><p>“Well…” Neville replied hesitantly </p><p>“Don’t make me put it in you. Please?” Theo nagged a bit and Neville finally opened his mouth, he gave Neville a big smile when he swallowed it</p><p>“Okay now, tell me about your day” He gave Neville another spoonful of chocolate soufflé and pouted “Come on, I won’t be bored of it, I promise, some of my exes were reporters from the Daily Prophet, you cannot believe how much they talk a day” </p><p>“I-…okay…” Neville said and fiddled with his fingers “Well, today the First Year studied with the Mandrakes”</p><p>“Really? Wow, I think you fainted that time” Theo chuckled and Neville’s eyes glistened</p><p>“Y-you remember?” </p><p>“Of course, I have a great memory” He smiled “So how was it? Did anyone faint?”</p><p>“Yeah, two actually, one messed with it and got bitten” He said “They’re all alright”</p><p>“Anything else?” </p><p>“Well…one of my students, a Gryffindor asked me about another Slytherin student in my class and he asked me tips to flirt with him, his crush, but well, I couldn’t, I don’t know how to flirt” Neville sighed </p><p>“Don’t say that, anyone can flirt” Theo waved it off and ate his chocolate lava cake</p><p>“No, I really can’t…Alex…he flirted with me, I don’t know how to flirt”</p><p>“Oh stop, you can, come on” Theo shook his head again and cleared his throat “Now, pretend I’m your date, what do you say?”</p><p>“Well…I’d normally combine words that don’t make sense up and ends up saying ‘I’m Long Nevbottom instead’, and it had happened once” He chuckled </p><p>“No no, don’t be shy, now, tell me I’m pretty or something, if you can make me blush, then you’ve nailed it. That way, you’ll get a new boyfriend in no time, compliment me” He encouraged Neville and sipped on his wine “Okay, go!”</p><p>“Er…I…okay” Neville swallowed hard and ruffled his blonde messy hair, then he looked up at Theo with his hazel eyes and Theo thought his heart skipped a beat “You…are really beautiful, not pretty, beautiful, and I know that because…I’ve…I kinda admire you back in Hogwarts, you were really…popular in Eighth Year and you have always been beautiful” He was getting more confident, but Theo wasn’t “You are so smart too, you nailed in Astronomy and Divination, you are funny, you were so great in those parties that Pansy and Hermione planned in Eighth Year, I-I have always wanted to talk to you…but every time I think about it, my mind just makes up a lot of scenarios where you’d laugh at my face and walk away, and I…I’m not confident, you are way out of my league and just…seeing you here tonight, it’s like being in Hogwarts again, you’re not only beautiful from the outside, but you’re beautiful on the inside too, you’re…you’re like…the moon…people see you as pretty and nothing else, but you’re so much more, I’d…I’d happily be the first one to…to explore you and find out what’s inside you. Do you know…er…Neil Armstrong? He’s the…”</p><p>“First man to step on the moon, I know” Theo whispered and Neville nodded</p><p>“Yeah, and if he’s the first human to step on the moon and put a flag on it…then I-I’d be the first person to get to know you and well…I-…” He looked around and saw his ring box, he opened it and pulled the ring out. Oh no, what was he going to do? Neville then held Theo’s hand in his and continued “I’d be the first person to put a ring on you too…” He then put the ring on Theo’s palm and smiled, looking up at Theo “If you’d let me” Then he noticed something and reached his hand up to Theo’s face</p><p>“You got a…bit chocolate here” He wiped the chocolate off the corner of Theo’s lips and then licked it, then he somehow returned to his normal self, he smiled shyly at Theo and scratched the nape of his neck</p><p>“Ugh, I told you I can’t flirt. That was horrible, right? I knew I shouldn’t have said those” He mumbled and Theo was still trying his best to compose himself. What in the hell had just happened? Did he just propose to Theo? Did Theo just fall in love with Neville? Or was it both? He noticed his cheeks warming up, which meant that he was blushing, and oh it was bad, it was so bad</p><p>“N-no, no” He said quickly “It was amazing, seriously” He confirmed again at Neville’s shocked face “If you keep that up, you’ll have a new…boyfriend…really quick, don’t worry”</p><p>“Really?” Theo nodded at him </p><p>“I’m sorry if it crossed any line, Alex hates it when I say cheesy stuff” Neville blushed and looked down</p><p>“Well, he’s not here anymore, right?” He cupped Neville’s face and sighed “Neville, you are amazing. You’re kind, you’ve always been kind, I’ve watched how much you care about your plants, you’re so brave too, you killed Nagini! I could never do that, but you did, you are funny too, you have your own charm and I’d kill to have a boyfriend like you, anyone would kill to have a boyfriend like you, if you can make me laugh, then you’re perfect boyfriend material already, there are so many people that will want you, maybe they’re right in front of your eyes, you just don’t know it yet” And when he said that, their eyes locked, Theo have never felt so intense before, his heart raced and his cheeks flushed, his hands were still on Neville’s face and oh he wanted to kiss him so much, so so bloody much.</p><p>“Can I kiss you?”</p><p>“What?” Theo stopped breathing for a second at Neville’s sudden question. What did he say? </p><p>“Oh god no, I’m sorry” Neville pushed Theo’s hands and began stuttering like a teenage boy talking to his crush “I-I’m sorry. I thought we just had a moment, Merlin I’m so stupid, sorry, you must be so shocked” Theo quickly thought of something to stop him from panicking, yeah sure, he had seen Blaise sometimes shutting Ron up by attacking him with kisses, so he did exactly that. He grabbed Neville’s face and smashed their lips together, he could feel the blond’s lips pressing to his, he was shocked, he definitely was, but at least he had shut up now. Right, he had expected that Neville was a clumsy kisser, but he wasn’t even moving at all, so he let go, their faces still close together</p><p>“Let go and just kiss me, you idiot” Theo whispered against his lips and leaned in to kiss again, this time, he has decided to move, he sucked on Theo’s bottom lips and the brunette was actually shocked by his movements, the way he slithered his tongue inside Theo’s lips, he could taste everything that Neville had eaten earlier, he realised he could smell Neville’s scent since they were so close, and the blond didn’t use any cologne, that was certain, his smell was more…natural and fresh, and…woody in a way, maybe he had been in the Green House all day in Hogwarts, it felt…familiar. Neville’s big strong hands slid in his hair and Theo might have shuddered, he let out a small moan when Neville’s kissed him harder and there was a sound of someone clearing their throat, so Theo let go, his lips felt swollen and hot, he turned to see Hermione standing on the spot with her hands on her hips, arching an eyebrow at them</p><p>“I was gone…for half an hour, and you’ve already kissed him?” She said “Luckily I forgot my jacket” She grabbed the jacket she draped over the chair earlier and put it on “Theo! He just broke up! Neville, really?”</p><p>“Mione listen, I know it’s fast but…”</p><p>“Theo!” Ginny appeared from behind Hermione and smiled at them “Oh Neville! You’re here?”</p><p>“Ginny?” Both Theo and Neville said in unison, the redhead just nodded at them</p><p>“I thought you were at the pub?” Theo asked her</p><p>“Yeah, so you see, some guy flirted with Draco and danced with him, as soon as Harry saw the guy grabbing Draco’s arse, Harry just lost it, punched the guy, knocked him right out, now Draco’s taking care of Harry in St. Mungo, we came back here because Hermione forgot her jacket” She gestured </p><p>“Where’s Pansy?”</p><p>“Paying the bills” Ginny winked at their dumbfounded faces “She paid the bloke to flirt with Draco and get hit by Harry, was a bit extreme, I know, but oh well, at least Harry and Draco are a couple now”</p><p>“Bit?” Theo asked and Ginny shrugged</p><p>“Only one punch, and the guy was happy he was beaten by the great Harry Potter” Ginny laughed “But it’s alright now. Hey Theo did you get my message?”</p><p>“About my blind date?” Theo sighed “Gin, seriously, I don’t want you to matchmake me like Pansy, Merlin knows what you’ll do t-…”</p><p>“Oh no!” She cut him off and continued “Actually I meant to matchmake Neville with you”</p><p>“What?” Both of the guys said in unison again</p><p>“Yeah, I didn’t think Neville had a boyfriend until Hermione told me on the way here” The redhead shrugged “Well but at least it still worked out, we gotta go back now, see you tomorrow, Pansy’s hosting brunch at her Manor, hope you two are there” She winked and started pulling Hermione out “Come on Mione, your wife has been asking for you”</p><p>“I’ll have a serious talk with you tomorrow at brunch, Theo” Hermione glared and pointed at him “Remember what I told you about settling down, bye” She walked out of the restaurant with Ginny and there were now only the two of them left</p><p>“Well…” Theo began where they left off and put his hand on top of Neville’s “That was nice”</p><p>“I-…I’m sorry if I did anything over the line” </p><p>“No, don’t say that, I love it, and I really wanted you to kiss me” Theo smiled, leaning over to kiss him on the lips gently </p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Really, now, do you want to head over to St. Mungo and see what happens or…should we go to my house and see what happens?” He grinned at Neville’s blushing face and cupped his face “It’s settled then. Come on, I’ll try not to charm you into my bed” He stood up and pulled Neville up with him</p><p>“You’re very charming, so it’ll be hard” </p><p>“That’s what you’ll be too when we get there” Theo smiled brightly at Neville’s red face again. He loved seeing Neville all red like that, it was adorable, absolutely adorable. He might have to deal with Hermione’s wrath tomorrow but if Neville was with him there tomorrow, it would totally be worth it too.</p>
