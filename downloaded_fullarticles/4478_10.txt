<p>The light glows brighter as he rounds a corner, and he sees her. The tall shelves loom all around her, making her seem strangely small and fragile. Her face rests on the mess of jumbled parchment in front of her, and her wild hair has broken free of its clasp and spills madly over the books. Ink stains the hand that hangs empty at her side and the pale skin of her cheek.</p>
<p>For what feels like an eternity, he stands watching her soft breaths ruffle her hair. Hesitantly he steps forward. One step, then another. Almost close enough to touch her.</p>
<p>A hand reaches up, ghostly pale even in the warm candlelight. Closer. His heart is pounding in his throat.</p>
