    <p>Lily believed herself lucky, as well as blessed, though her situation was rather dire; she had a loving husband, her dream house and the most amazing son. What more could a woman wish for?<br/>
Not much, if it wasn’t for the war tearing the world apart, leaving it cold and very lonely; trust, a luxury one couldn’t afford anymore.  She shook her head, not wanting to think of such things, before looking down at her sleeping son; Harry was clinging to his two favorite stuffed animals; a grey wolf and a black dog. </p><p>“Should I make tea? I could use a cup before bed…” Lily turned her head to smile at her husband, who had the tenderers look, ever, in his eyes as they fell on the sleeping baby.</p><p>“Sounds good, Luv, I’ll just clean this and then I’ll be down.” James nodded with a proud smile before going down the stairs, Lily turned to look at the wrecked room; the before mentioned teddies had been on the shelves where Harry couldn’t reach so he had made a small frustrated scream with his small hands reaching toward the bookshelves… everything on the shelves had moved towards Harry, burying him but she hadn’t needed to worry as Harry had had the biggest smile on his small face and the teddies in his arms.<br/>
She took the nearest thing and placed it on its place before taking the next, a small smile on her lips at the clear display of her son’s powers. She could hear James move about downstairs, closing the house down for the night, she did a last check on Harry and as she was tucking him in tighter – he kept kicking his blanket off – she heard a crash from downstairs.</p><p>“Lily! He’s at the gate!!” Lily froze in her forward bended position, fear creeping in on her but she shook it off before it could sink its teeth into her soul; unfreezing she hurried to spell the door closed. She could hear James struggle hard but knew that he would kill her if she left Harry, so while moving furniture in front of the door, she kept muttering a prayer she had not used since her eleventh birthday; when her sister had told her that witches got struck by lightning if trying to enter a church. </p><p>“Blessed be the Child, innocent and fresh… blessed be the Mother, fertile and loving… blessed be the Father, protective and warm… blessed be the Lord, wise and kind…… blessed be Magic, forever reborn…” Just at the end of her prayer she heard the two most feared words getting shouted and it hadn’t been in James’ voice! By now, all the noise had awoken Harry, who was staring at her with big frightened eyes – so much like her own – so she kneeled by the crib, and through the bars, stroked his hair to calm him. Hearing the stairs creak she grasped Harry’s small hands in her own and silently repeated her prayer while trying to push all her motherly love into the words, ignoring the sounds of the furniture’s being dragged away from the door by unseen force, finishing her prayers just as the door banged open.</p><p>“Out of the way, Mudblood, and I shall spare you.” Lily raised herself enough to kiss Harry before fully standing to face the magical world’s greatest fear, holding her head high she stood her ground in front of her son – a hand touching his head to keep him calm. “Now, Mudblood!”</p><p>“No.” Lily gave her best death glare at the monster, who raised a hairless eyebrow in what she guessed were surprise. “You’ll have to kill me.”</p><p>“Your bravery will be rewarded with a quick death for you both.” Voldemort slowly raised his wand, giving her ample chance to move, but to his surprise her confidence and pride only grew more the higher his wand came while her death glare intensified.</p><p>“One day you will pay, Tom Marvalo Riddle, nothing can cheat death forever; not even magic – you will die and pay for your misdoings.” </p><p>“So they say.” Lily held up her hands so he paused, puzzled he watched as she turned and whispered something to the child who was staring un-naturally focused at him, as she was turned back around he began chanting. “Avada… Kadavra…”</p><p>“You will die, Tom…” She smiled as the sickly green beam hit her; the mocking smile stayed on her beautiful face, forever frozen in death.</p><p>“He’s already dead.” Voldemort almost glided over the floor to the fallen woman; her dead eyes mismatching the smile so he closed them with his bare foot. Feeling eyes on him, still, he turned to the child who was totally focused on his every move which he found unusual for such a young age – but on the other hand, what did he know of such things? Raising his wand again he saw how the child’s green eyes followed the movement. “Avada kadavra!” </p><p>What happened next went so blinding fast that neither had any time to react; the beam flew towards Harry but before it even hit its target, it made contact with a form of shield and bounced off with a green/white light before ricocheting back at its maker, going faster than human eyes could track, and Voldemort only managed to raise his wand before it hit him straight on… and this is where things gets really weird.<br/>
Instead of dying on the spot, he felt a pain like no else centered in his chest where his soul – what was left – tried to fight the curse that wanted to end his existence but as his soul wasn’t whole it weren’t possible so instead it tried to tear apart the remaining fragment. He felt himself shatter like glass exploding, leaving him a weak ghostly fog, so he fled the scene leaving the unconscious child with a bleeding wound on his forehead… the spot that Lily had kissed moment before.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BREAK &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>Albus Dumbledore was a well-known, well liked and, possibly, the most trusted man in all of Britain though where he was going to they would have no idea of whom he was and had they been awake to see him, they would have avoided him like the plague – good thing it was late night. He calmly walked towards a plain looking house, surrounded by equally plain looking houses – the only difference was the cars in the driveways…as well as the cat looking at him from its seat on the stone fence of the house he neared.</p><p>“Ah…. Minerva … I should have guessed….” Inside the house, a person woke with a start, used to listen for the smallest sound coming from the nursery, the person slowly sat up while straining her ears for whatever that woke her up. Hearing voices on the street, she slipped out of the bed and leaned against the wall beside the single window, hoping to recognize the culprits so she could bitch in the morning for lost sleep, to their parents. She glanced out slowly, like in those ninja movies her husband loved and she had had to stand for years, she nearly fainted – as well as having a heart attack – at seeing the three people standing outside her fence; oh she recognized them alright! That was her sister’s teachers from her boarding school, what could they possibly be doing outside her house instead of her sister’s?<br/>
She observed silently as the white bearded man walked through the fence gate to her front door, a bundle of old blankets in his arms. A minute later, he returned to the others, a stern looking woman and a huge bearded man. They looked at whatever they had left before they vanished on the spot, making her gasp and trip which woke her husband, Vernon, who sat up in surprise with a confused look in his eyes as he looked around.</p><p>“Tunie, what ya’ doing on the floor?” She shook her head as if to shake the thought out of it. “Darling, what’s wrong?”</p><p>“I-I’ll b-be rig-right ba-back!” She rushed out of the bedroom, as if Hell’s Hounds were after her. She didn’t have to worry about waking up her son, because luckily her son was a very heavy sleeper. Her brain tried to reason with her newly acquired memories of what had just happened; her memory screaming that it really happened while her brain was screaming back that it wasn’t possible. She reached the front door, her hand halfway raised to take the handle but fear of what might be on the other side halted her. Finally her hand rested on the handle, but any try of actually opening the door failed.</p><p>“Tunie..? What’s happening, why are you standing there… you’re not even wearing your slippers, you know you’ll catch a cold…” Vernon stepped up behind her, hugging her close around the waist, to give some warmth as she was shaking from cold and something he believed to be fear – should he get her inhaler? – with that thought in mind he tried to lessen her tight grip on the handle so he could take her to the kitchen, but she resisted through her shaking, and tightened her grasp even harder, Vernon gave up but reached behind them for her long winter coat which he laid over her shoulders – this made her come back from the tornado of feelings and regained her focus, which she turned to her husband.</p><p>“Vern……there’s something I have to tell you, you might not believe me but please…. Just listen?” Vernon grunted his agreement, his hands rubbing her cold stomach in comforting circles. “I’ve never told you I have a sister, mainly because I’d believed I would never see her again and by that anything connected to her…….should have known better…..”</p><p>“Why is that, Darling?”</p><p>“At first I was jealous… hurt and I believed the worst of her, shameful to be related to something so un-natural…” Vernon felt her shake more and knew she was holding back tears. “….back when we were kids... I’d noticed her doing things but I shook it off as only a child do… it wasn’t before she turned eleven the year after me, I finally understood. My sister was a witch.” She felt Vernon tense and she feared he would start screaming, he stayed silent as he promised. “My conviction of never being reminded of her was broken tonight; I’ve just seen three of her teachers outside our house, they left somethings on our doorstep…” She hung her head; a burden lifted from her shoulders though it were replaced by a new weight on her heart; would he believe her or have her admitted at the loony bin?</p><p>"Then we better have a look at what it is." Vernon 'helped' her to remove her hand from the handle before he himself opened the door a little, they both held their breath when he opened it wider.</p><p>"OH! Jesus Christ!" They stared shocked at each other for a moment; Petunia looked back down at the bundle which contained a baby boy with the darkest black hair she'd ever seen as well as a bleeding wound on his small forehead. "Get the kit!" Vernon wobbled off towards the kitchen while she bend down to lift the baby into her arms, she noticed something so she looked at second time and saw an old fashion letter like the one Lily received on her birthday.</p><p>"I have it, Darling."</p><p>"Coming." Taking the letter she hurried to close the door and make the short walk to the kitchen where Vernon had made a make-shift changing table. "First we need to get the bleeding stopped, press this… here… hold still." Vernon did while she found a disinfection serviette and a roll of cotton. "Let's see then…" The bleeding had mostly stopped so she cleaned the cut gently before wrapping it up for the night, turning to the blanket around him she got her second shock that night; he was only clad in thin summer pajamas! "That's irresponsible… and a little weird… you would think he had at least a bruise…"</p><p>"What's this?" Vernon studied the letter but she snatched it, suddenly desperate for answers. "Hey!"</p><p>"Oh hush." During the three minutes it took her to read the rather short letter she made five enraged growling sounds, it came to the point of Vernon having to rescue the letter from her twitching hands before guiding her to a chair. "The nerve of that man!" Vernon rubbed her neck in a calming way but as he read further the rubbing turned to a twitching of his fingers – as if strangling someone; who ask anyone to harm an innocent child?<br/>
"Just wait till I get my hands on him!"</p><p>"Shush … you'll wake him." Harry had indeed moved but settled quickly when she took his small hand in her own. "This man seems to be a powerful man, how else could he suggest such a thing, so maybe it would be for the best if he believes we will do this...?" They looked at each other, years of marriage making them able to talk through looks, and a silent agreement passed between the new caretakers of one Harry James Potter – Savior of everything Light.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX break XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>The first few years went normally with a few incidents here and there but Petunia and Vernon's care, encouragement and, most of all, patience as well as the given safe, stabile home life made Harry able to control most of his Releases to controlled actions such as summoning his bottle when Petunia was busy with a fussing Dudley or making a copy of whatever toys him and Dudley argued over.<br/>
By the time he went to kinder garden at the tender age of three he had already learned to control his magic enough to no longer having Releases, he had been strictly advised to not let anyone catch him doing things there just couldn't be explained logically. The funny thing about kids is that they are expects at finding either loop-holes or they simply change a few words or a meaning here and there and vupti; Harry simply made sure the other kids kept quiet by unknowingly binding them vaguely to their promise of silence, when they grew up and forgot the bind would disappear.<br/>
Petunia thanked God for the money coming yearly from Harry's future Headmaster as Harry had an thirst for any knowledge and life experiences he could get his hands on, he joined all kinds of things so he went to at least one if not two or three things each day and the list so far at his age of nine was; swimming, boy scout, chess, spelling bee, singing and instrumental lessons, dancing, horse riding, self-defense in the material art, surviving trips with the Military, paper boy, language lessons and the latest was ice skating in which he showed a natural talent even though he had only done it for a few months he had yet to fall.<br/>
He had also shown an interest in cooking and the last few weeks he could always be found with Petunia whenever it was time to make food, she was amazed at his seemingly endless thirst but even more with how much that small brain could contain as she quickly discovered that she only had to tell or show him something once and he remembered – he once recited the complete recipe of Fried Chicken legs and baked potatoes with veggies… in his sleep.</p><p>It was by this age (Nine) that Petunia decided to take Harry to Diagon Ally so he could get some books from that world, she knew Albus would be angry as he properly wanted Harry ignorant of Magic until starting school but there was no fucking way she would send her brilliantly bright nephew (Son!) to a big school without making sure he knew the basis to said school.<br/>
So they went; Harry had to point out the pub from Petunia's memories as Muggles first saw the building when entering, they slipped through unnoticed but this was where they hit a brick wall – literary! She really had to dig deep to remember the combination but after a few tries they succeeded with Harry staring open mouthed as the bricks moved aside into a wide archway.<br/>
At the Bank they met further complications as they had no key or papers but luckily Harry had a minor tantrum, screaming at them for being thieves refusing him his money and it ended with them being led to the Director's office where the goblin did a few scans and a blood test. They got the next complication with the discovery of Albus taking money monthly as well as being his legal guardian, at this Petunia raged – arguing that it was her and her husband there had raised him with no word from Albus except the letter under Harry. The goblin snapped his fingers and papers stating everything to do with legal and law stuff concerning Harry landed on the table; it stated that Mr. and Mrs. Dursley were indeed the legal guardians of mentioned wizard though things concerning the Magical world were to go through his Headmaster, who would then bring on the news. He was quickly banned from taking more money and any existing keys were nulled, they had a credit card made there worked in both worlds as well as a new key. They also asked to receive a monthly update on the card's activity.</p><p>"Why would my headmaster steal my money?" Petunia turned to her nephew (Son!), he was staring heartbroken at her with his big green blaming eyes so like her sister's. "What have I done him?"</p><p>"I don't know yet, Hun, but we will." The rest of the day went with visiting every shop, spending half of the time in different bookstores, Harry made quick friends with Olivander and for an hour, they sat listening attentively to the story of the First War of Magic and the terror reign of Mr. Riddle AKA Lord Voldemort – He Who Must Not Be Named. They both laughed out loud at the ridiculous long name, as they were about to walk out through the door a shelve began shaking until a box shook free and flew straight at Harry but he merely caught it with a coy smile.</p><p>"Great things we can expect of you. The question will remain whether it will be for the Light or the Dark side." Petunia studied her foster son, who gave a rather wicked grin to the old man.</p><p>"Who says it can't be for both?" Then he saluted before strolling out like he owned the place, leaving Petunia alone with a chuckling Olivander.</p><p>"An interesting personality for such a young lad…"</p><p>"You only know half of it." He waved after her as she followed Harry, who was heading towards the Pet store. "No rats!" He gave a wave to show he heard her before entering.<br/>
