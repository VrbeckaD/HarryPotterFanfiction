    <p>Harry just followed the huge man around until he suddenly disappeared. There were too many people walking around and he had no idea where he was. Harry made a face, looked down at his list and looked around, trying to figure out where he was going. He should have gotten a map. He took a step and slammed into someone, crashing to the ground. He looked up and saw a man, all dressed in black with black hair and black eyes. He had no idea what the man was muttering about as he finally stood up. He brushed off the dirt and looked up.</p><p>"Well, where are your parents?" Why didn't children watch where they were going? He didn't have time to be picking them up off of the ground.</p><p>Harry tilted his head. He knew he missed what the had to have been saying as the man had an annoyed look on his face that he recognized. "Dead. 
You tall."</p><p>"Thank you for stating the obvious." The boy's speech sounded weird. The sounds weren't clear. He looked at the child. He saw the boy make a face. The boy realized he wasn't happy. "I suppose you are here for your supplies?"</p><p>"Yes, huge man left me." Harry held out the supply list. "Help?" Harry watched the man make a face as he looked at the list, he waited. It was amazing at times how that one word worked with a helpless look.</p><p>"Can you hear me?" He noticed that unless he looked directly at the boy that he didn't answer. He hadn't heard of any deaf wizards arriving at Hogwarts this year.</p><p>"No, you face me, I read lips." Harry proudly stated. It had taken him a long time to learn that skill. He still didn't always get everything correct but he knew most of the time he did. He still needed to master people with facial hair.</p><p>"Can you sign?" Great, just what he didn't need right now, he had a lot he needed to get done today. The boy was deaf but at least he could read lips which would be very helpful. He hoped he didn't have to teach the boy to sign.</p><p>Harry signed. *Yes, learned school.* His teachers had given him a lot of sign language books.</p><p>*My name is Professor Snape, I will help you. Do you know you brought you here?* He wondered what professor would leave a child, never mind a deaf child, alone in Diagon Alley. He knew it couldn't be Minerva, she would be hovering over the child. </p><p>*No, he had a lot of hair and I couldn't see his lips. He didn't like the carts where the little men were.*</p><p>*What is your name?* Good, the boy had been to Gringotts and that would save him a bit of time.</p><p>*Harry* He showed him his special sign for his name. It was an H combined with the sign for green, because of his eyes.</p><p>*Potter?* No, this boy couldn't be Harry Potter. He was small, too skinny, he certainly didn't look like a Potter. He didn't even have glasses like his father. He didn't look like Lily either. He had her eyes. He wasn't sure who Harry had gotten his looks from.</p><p>*Yes. Why does everyone know my name?* Harry's face reflecting his confusion. Everyone kept crowding him when they found out his name and grabbing his hands.</p><p>Snape guided him over to a quiet corner. *What do you know about your parents? Magic?*</p><p>*My parents died in a car crash, gave me this scar." Harry lifted his hair and showed him the lightning bolt-shaped scar. *It took my hearing. I didn't even know magic existed until today. My aunt and uncle don't like magic.*</p><p>Snape was furious. He had been told the boy knew all about their ways, their traditions, how advanced he was in regard to his training. He got an idea. *Harry, I want to take you back to the bank. I want a healer to look at you."</p><p>*Healer?*</p><p>*Like a doctor.* Harry's eyes went big and filled with fear. *You will be safe. I promise and I never break a promise.* Including the one to protect you. He could tell Harry didn't care for the idea. He felt the boy was inclined to go with him. *I promise you, you won't be hurt, and nothing will happen to you.*</p><p>Harry finally nodded his acceptance and held out his hand. Snape took his hand and guided him back to Gringotts. When he entered, a goblin greeted him. "Professor Snape, we tried to stop Hagrid from leaving with Mr. Potter. We have things we needed to discuss with him."</p><p>"I am sure. However, he needs to see a healer." Snape felt Harry tugged his hand. He signed what was just said.</p><p>Snape followed the goblin to the healer area. They took a seat while the goblin went to inform a healer they were needed. Two hours later, Harry left with his eyesight fixed, just slight nearsightedness, a few broken bones that healed wrong repaired, along with numerous cuts, bruises, scars, and nerve damage. It was the type of damage that would have prevented him from mastering the skills of making a potion as well as some of the more advanced spells. After they were done they were escorted to Griphook. Griphook was the Potter family account manager. "Please have a seat. I have a few concerns. One of them is the numerous reports regarding abuse from the muggles. We have had numerous squibs report it but nothing was ever done. Also, we were informed that Mr. Potter's key was in the possession of Hagrid instead of his magical guardian, Albus Dumbledore. The key is now in Mr. Potter's possession which will allow him to select a new magical guardian."</p><p>Snape translated all of the information. Burying his own fury at what Dumbledore allowed to occur to Harry. He was willing to give the man the benefit of the doubt but hearing that there were numerous reports concerning abuse showed him that Dumbledore knew. Snape thought Dumbledore most likely wanted it to happen. He wondered what the old man's game was. Harry signed. *Who left me aunt and uncle's?*</p><p>*Albus Dumbledore.* Snape knew this wasn't good. He wondered what Dumbledore was thinking of, leaving Harry Potter with Petunia. Dumbledore knew what that harpy was like. Lily had warned him so many different times. He knew there had to be a reason.</p><p>Harry pulled a folded envelope out of his pocket. He pointed to the name on his letter. *Same?*</p><p>*Yes.*</p><p>*I decide how?*</p><p>*You give your vault key to the person you want to take care of you. They will become your guardian if they agree.* </p><p>Harry pulled out his key, looked at it, looked at Griphook and to Snape. He held it out to Snape and pointed. Snape was a bit surprised. He thought for a few minutes. He realized Harry was making his decision on how Snape had taken care of him since they met. It was more than anyone else he had encountered in his life. Even Hagrid abandoned him. *Harry, I will be your guardian, many will tell you I am not a nice man. Actually, I'm not.* He would have to explain Death Eaters, Voldemort, the reason he was put with the Dursley family.</p><p>*You protect me. You helped me. I want you if you want me.*</p><p>Snape saw Lily's eyes and he couldn't resist. The promise was strong and he couldn't hate someone who had his dearest friend's eyes. *I accept.* Dumbledore was going to have the biggest bird he ever hatched but it was his own fault. He shouldn't have left Harry to be abused by his aunt. He also knew Harry wasn't deaf when he was dropped off. The damage, however, was done. They finished up with the goblins and finished shopping. Severus knew he should find Hagrid and tell him he had Harry. However, the man deserved to panic for leaving a child alone in Diagon Alley. They made their way back to Hogwarts. School started in a few weeks and he had a lot of work if he was going to get Harry ready for the start of term.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________</p><p>Snape walked Harry into the Great Hall with him. He was a wee bit later than he normally would have arrived at but he wanted to make sure everyone was in attendance. He already warned Harry that there was going to be some upheaval and not to worry about it. Harry seemed fine with it. Harry said he would read while they argued. Snape was almost tempted to smile. They would be arguing that was for sure. "Severus, where did you find him?" Dumbledore had been frantic. Hagrid was still out looking for Harry. He quickly sent off a Patronus letting him know that Harry was at Hogwarts.</p><p>"In Diagon Alley by himself." Severus was still a bit upset about how Harry was treated.</p><p>"I am sure it didn't warrant removing him from Hagrid's care. He is old enough to find his way around." Dumbledore tried to reason as he saw Minerva's displeasure about hearing Harry was left alone.</p><p>"Really, you expect a child on his first visit to Diagon Alley to be able to handle everything by themselves? Go to the correct stores? Avoid dangerous areas? Handle all the crowds? Know who to trust?" Snape pulled his chair out after he summoned one for Harry. Harry had placed his book on the table. Severus noticed it was the same potion book he had been reading earlier.</p><p>"He should have gone with a Professor." Minerva snapped. She had been very vocal about Hagrid leaving Harry and reminded Dumbledore of the rules.</p><p>"Hagrid was picking something up for me and it seemed like an ideal solution." Dumbledore wasn't about to admit he made a mistake.</p><p>"Yes, sending Hagrid to deal with a deaf child. A child who can't read Hagrid's lips because of his facial hair. I had to explain about wizards, our world. I found him lost in Diagon Alley. Yes, sending Hagrid was an ideal solution." </p><p>"Deaf?" All of the staff seemed shocked.</p><p>"Yes, deaf, thanks to his relatives. Not to mention the numerous broken bones, malnutrition, scars, cuts, bruises, nerve damage, and of course, deafness." He stressed the word deafness. Snape reined in his temper as he remembered the scan from the healer. "All of it with the exception of the deafness has been fixed by the healers at Gringotts." He wondered if Poppy would have noticed. She wasn't a healer and it wasn't a requirement to have her examine any student unless they were injured. He knew Minerva didn't require her first years to be examined and Dumbledore certainly wouldn't want Harry examined.</p><p>"They can't fix it?" Poppy asked.</p><p>"No, it's been too long. Healer Ratchet said it stems from the numerous ear infections that were never healed. His relatives never took him to see a healer. Harry had to get all his shots. He was totally deaf by the time he was three." Snape was going to find a way to make Dumbledore and Harry's relatives pay for the abuse.</p><p>Minerva glared at Dumbledore. "I warned you." She was seething. "I told you they were the worst sort of muggles."</p><p>"He had to be there the blood wards would protect him." Dumbledore wasn't going to admit the truth.</p><p>"Blood wards only work if they love him." Filius responded. "Clearly, they didn't."</p><p>"I am sure we can find a family to take him in. The Weasleys would welcome him in."</p><p>"He has already selected a new guardian." Snape could see Dumbledore already planning on how to keep control over Harry. He wasn't going to allow that to happen.</p><p>"Who? He doesn't know anyone in the magical world." Dumbledore was trying to figure out who Harry could have given his key for guardianship. He didn't give it to Hagrid as Hagrid forgot to get it back. The half-giant didn't even understand the importance of holding that key truly meant.</p><p>"Contrary to what you told us. I believe you informed us how he was getting tutored in magic, training in our culture and traditions. Who exactly was teaching him?" Snape began to plan which potions Dumbledore would be testing for him.</p><p>"Well, I was going to once he returned." Dumbledore didn't like where this was heading. He realized he should have moved this up to his office.</p><p>"I see. All the times you informed me of how he looked like James, all the training he was getting, was pure fiction? Oh, by the way, all those books, every piece of the Harry Potter brand, and including those unauthorized stories, all those royalties will be returning to his vaults. As well as all of the funds that went to his care. Every book, every item, will be returned." Snape looked right at Dumbledore. He hoped the man understood his message. A message that was informing Dumbledore that he knew about the items he had withdrawn over the years from the Potter vaults. All the books, all the artifacts, and the money.</p><p>"We can deal with that later. We need to find out who has guardianship of Harry." Dumbledore couldn't let this be known. There were too many dark powerful families would want to get control over Harry.</p><p>"I believe, Severus does." Filius really wondered about Dumbledore at times. The man was always so focused on the big picture he missed the little details at times. He should have known it was Severus as soon as he started to list off account details.</p><p>"Well, if you will pass me the key, I will resume guardianship." Dumbledore grinned, putting on his best grandfatherly act.</p><p>"No. I am keeping it. You lost your right when you left him with Petunia. You knew what she did to Lily and you left a baby in her care. Harry showed me his envelope, did you know his bedroom was a cupboard under the stairs?"</p><p>"No." Gasps were heard from numerous members of the staff. He got the staff's support now.</p><p>"The poor bairn. I am glad you took custody of him, Severus." Minerva stated. The rest of the staff was in agreement, except for Dumbledore. He looked like he was planning on how to regain custody.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Snape was watching the sorting. He had guided Harry over to Draco, who had visited a few days during the week over the last two weeks. They seemed to get along. They had started to teach Draco sign language. They were fine until Ron Weasley pushed Draco out of the way and started yelling, "HELLO HARRY, I'M RON, WE ARE GOING TO BE FRIENDS."</p><p>Harry made a face. "Why he screaming?" He was looking at Draco as Draco was glaring at the red-haired boy.</p><p>"Because he thinks if he yells loud enough you will amazingly be able to hear him." Draco spoke slowly and directly to Harry.</p><p>"No hear no matter what level you speak." Harry looked at Draco. Draco shrugged his shoulders to show he was just as confused.</p><p>"You don't want to be friends with a future Death Eater and snake." Ron was still slightly louder than normal, causing several people to look at him in shock.</p><p>"Mr. Weasley, five points for disrespect from I am going to say Gryffindor." Minerva said from where she stood by the stool. They were almost up to the letter m.</p><p>Draco went to Slytherin and gave a smile to Harry. Harry watched Draco who was going to tell him when his name was called. He ignored the screaming redhead and waited for his turn. He walked up to the stool. A hat was placed on his head and when it spoke he knocked it off of his head. "Oh, dear, we didn't tell him that did we?" Poppy asked. Harry's eyes were wide and his face was full of fear.</p><p>"No, let me explain it." Snape got up and walked to face Harry. He had forgotten that the hat would scare the boy. After all, you don't expect to hear a voice in your head when you can hear, never mind a voice in your head when you don't even remember hearing. He quickly got Harry relaxed and he signed what was going to happen.</p><p>*Hat will talk to me?* Harry wanted to make sure he understood.</p><p>*In a way, only you will hear him. He will be speaking only to you.*</p><p>*May I talk to him later?*</p><p>*I am sure we can ask.*</p><p>Harry smiled. Minerva replaced the hat on his head. "Mr. Potter, I didn't mean to startle you."</p><p>"Hi, what is your name?"</p><p>"Murray."</p><p>"Hi, Murray, Professor Snape said we can ask to speak to you later."</p><p>"I would enjoy that a lot. Now, let's see, brave, yes, smart, yes indeed, loyal, but only to those you trust, oh, cunning and ambition. You want to be with your friend and Professor Snape, well then it better be...Slytherin." Harry took off the hat. Remembering Snape's warning, he walked to Slytherin and sat down next to Draco.</p><p>___________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Harry made a face. Something smelled really bad. He had stayed late in the library and was on his way to the Great Hall. He felt the floor vibrate and wondered what was going on. He turned the corner and saw this huge smelly giant being standing there. It looked as confused as he was. He waved. The giant smelly thing waved back. Harry tilted his head. "Lost?" The giant smelly thing nodded. "I show out." The magical world sure had strange creatures and things in it. He would see if he could find a book about the giant smelly thing later. He walked past the giant smelly thing and waved his hand for it to follow him. The thing started to follow him. He walked it to the huge front doors. He stopped. "Bye." He waved bye. The giant smelly thing waved bye and ambled out the door.</p><p>"Did I just see him walk a troll out the door?" Minerva asked.</p><p>"Yes." Filius, Severus, and Dumbledore responded.</p><p>Harry turned around and seeing everyone he beamed a smile and ran to Snape, wrapping his arms around his legs. He let go and started to sign. *The giant smelly thing was lost. You help me find out what he was?*</p><p>*Lost? Why weren't you in your common room or the Great Hall?* Snape asked.</p><p>*I was in the library and walking to the Great Hall when I found him.*</p><p>Snape closed his eyes for a second. *Next time, don't and I mean this, don't walk up to a troll.* He was so thankful that they weren't scraping up Harry. At first, he had been furious seeing him near the troll. His anger turned into confusion as he was getting ready to kill the troll when he realized Harry was walking the troll out the door.</p><p>*He was a troll?* The shock was on his face. Snape answered him and explained to the others what happened.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Snape couldn't believe it. He was staring at the face of Voldemort. The golden idiots of Longbottom, Weasley, and Granger didn't make it further than the potion test. He had to give the antidote to Granger as Weasley was left behind on the giant chessboard and Longbottom fell from the broom. He had sent the three of them to Madam Pomfrey by an emergency portkey. Harry had followed him down here. Snape didn't want him to come but he knew Dumbledore was expecting Harry to be here. He agreed it would be best if he went with Harry. Harry was staring at the back of the bald head of Professor Quirrell. "How you on back of head?"</p><p>"What?" Voldemort was confused. </p><p>"How?"</p><p>"I possessed him."</p><p>Snape signed what Voldemort meant and how it happened.</p><p>"You need body?" He asked.</p><p>"Yes. I need a new body. I can't survive long in this body."</p><p>Harry and Snape had a discussion in sign language. They came to an agreement. After a year of putting up with Dumbledore and his attempts to gain control over Harry and his lies, they figured a sane Dark Lord was better. "Oh, yes, then you need a new body. Dumby be angry. I fix." Harry held out his hand for Quirrell to take the stone. Voldemort ordered Quirrell to take the stone. Voldemort ordered Snape and Quirrell to make it look like there was a fight. Quirrell and Snape didn't argue but set the stage. Quirrell put some colored crushed stone on the ground, burnt a bit of the stone. Snape dented the mirror. Severus summoned some rope which he burned a bit of it. "Ashes." Harry said.</p><p>*Ashes?* Snape asked.</p><p>"For a body." Voldemort explained. "I believe using Lily's protection would convince Dumbledore I was defeated. We say that Harry touched me causing Quirrell to burn to death. It would work instead of me just turning to vapor." The stage was set. Snape and Harry were covered in ash when Dumbledore made his grand entrance.</p><p>___________________________________________________________________</p><p>"No, Albus, he is coming home with me. I already told you that." Snape was glaring at Dumbledore. </p><p>"Molly has experience with raising children. He can have others to play with." Dumbledore reasoned.</p><p>"I am aware of her brood. However, I am his guardian and we are going to my manor for the summer."</p><p>"What about your associates? You know it would be dangerous."</p><p>"No one but you knows where my manor is. My former associates all believe I still reside at Spinner's End." He wasn't going to inform the man that they were going to be spending a lot of time with the Dark Lord and the Malfoy family.</p><p>"We have to keep him safe. I still don't like him being surrounded by all the children of Death Eaters." </p><p>"They are in his house and they have been helping and protecting him all year." Snape defended his students. "Now, I am going to make sure Harry is packed. We will be leaving after lunch."</p><p>"He needs to take the train." Dumbledore tried one more time.</p><p>"No. As my ward, he doesn't." Snape didn't want to add that Harry hated the idea of riding the train. All the crowds of people at the station had scared him when he had seen the students leaving for the Yule holiday and arriving at the beginning of the new term. "I will see you at lunch."</p>
