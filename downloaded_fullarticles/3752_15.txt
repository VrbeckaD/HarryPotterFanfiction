          <div class="userstuff"><p>Lily Evans was in a mischievous mood. This was pretty rare if she did say so herself, so it was okay. Especially if the person she was teasing just happened to be Sirius Black of all people. </p><p>“So your name is?”</p><p>Sirius gave her a look but he shrugged. “Sirius.”</p><p>”And your boyfriend’s name is?”</p><p>”Remus,” said Sirius without missing a beat. Lily smirked. And then he realized what he said. “Wait! I didn’t hear you. I thought you said best friend. Remus is my best friend.”</p><p>Suddenly the Common Room door burst open. </p><p>“YOU BASTARD!”</p><p>Remus was mad because he was his boyfriend, thank you very much. And James was mad because he was Sirius’ best friend!</p></div>
