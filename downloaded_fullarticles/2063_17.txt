    <p> </p><p> </p><p><br/> A grand procession of people could be seen parading down the street. They were all dressed in festive red and gold, the characters for good luck, wealth, and happiness stamped prominently on their clothing and the many chests they were carrying.</p><p>“Look at that dowry! Which family is sending their daughter off so extravagantly?”</p><p>“You didn’t know? Why it’s Potter <em>Hou Fu</em>!”</p><p>“Ah! It can’t be that they’ve finally found a match for Miss Gloria? Who is the lucky groom, to wed the most beautiful and talented daughter in the capital?”</p><p>An exasperated sigh. “No, you old geezer. It isn’t the second miss Potter but the first!”</p><p>“The first?”</p><p>“The <em>di</em> daughter of James Potter and Lily Evans.”</p><p>At the mention of James Potter, the two men drew silent. The older man shook his head wearily, no longer quite as eager to gossip about the affairs of the noble families, but wanting to see his questioning through to end, he said, “This first miss hasn’t been seen in the capital for so long, I’d forgotten about her.”</p><p>“You and everyone else. Supposedly, the Potters had sent her to live with her maternal family all these years.”</p><p>The old man watched the Good Fortune Matron cry out lucky blessings and toss flower petals all along the street. “And now they’ve brought her back.”</p><p>“Brought her back-” the younger man leaned in, “to marry a <em>junwang</em>.”</p><p>The older man looked up in shock. “I didn’t think the Potters were so ambitious.”</p><p>“If they were marrying her to a <em>qinwang</em> or even Ning junwang, maybe. But they are marrying her to Xian junwang.”</p><p>“The sixth prince - the one with the cursed reputation and no position in court? Why would the Potters waste their di daughter like this?”</p><p>“They had no choice. The emperor decreed the marriage.”</p><p>An extravagant bridal sedan passed by the two townspeople, followed by the last of the procession. They were headed to the gates of Xian <em>junwang fu</em>.</p><p>In the sedan, Harriet Potter, the first miss of Potter Marquis Fu, was stoically examining her nails. They had been filed, buffed, and then lacquered with a subtle pink. It was hard to believe that just days prior, these same nails had been filled with dirt and horse shit.</p><p>“Doesn’t it feel like a dream, Hedwig <em>mama</em>?” Harriet stared out the window, not so close as to expose her supposedly noble face to the masses, but close enough to peek at the bustling capital. Her bridal veil had been pushed aside slightly, though she didn’t dare remove it under Hedwig’s golden glare.</p><p>“They would have brought you back eventually. Your name is still Potter after all, no matter how much they wish it wasn’t so,” said her nursemaid. Hedwig was much older than her sixteen year old charge and the prematurely white hair coupled with her talon like grip only served to reinforce her matron-like qualities.</p><p>“And I’ll soon shed that name for a title.” Harriet tested the name <em>junwang fei</em> and didn’t know if she liked the sound.</p><p>Arriving at Xian junwang fu, Harriet stepped off the sedan and was soon placed onto someone’s back to be carried into the prince’s estate. She was surprised to find it wasn’t the joy matron who was carrying her, but a male. It was only when the man spoke did she realize this wasn’t some random manservant but her husband-to-be.</p><p>“Wife, we are entering the door.”</p><p>The voice was a smooth baritone, very pleasing to the ear.</p><p>Harriet didn’t say a word, just nodded her cheek against his shoulder.</p><p>Xian Junwang was his title but his given name was Tom, she remembered. The sixth and youngest prince at age twenty, he was like all his brothers, incredibly handsome. Even though his maternal family was exiled by the emperor and his mother had given birth to him while confined in the cold palace, he still drew many admirers for his gorgeous face and perfect manners alone.</p><p>Entering the gates of the junwang fu, Tom put her down and took the red ribbon from the joy attendant. One end was tightly held in his hand, the other was held by Harriet. He then carefully guided her to walk in.</p><p>They passed through many doors and corridors, receiving well wishes everywhere they went. Underneath the veil, Harriet’s expression was completely unreadable.</p><p>Walking into the main hall to bow to the world, she decided to throw away her misgivings. As they waited for a messenger to finish reciting the Emperor’s congratulations speech, she could only think that marrying Tom and entering the snake pit that is the imperial family couldn’t be as bad as living with the Dursleys. The ceremony continued as they kneeled to the heaven and earth and bowed three times. They then moved to kneel to a set of empty chairs on a dais meant to represent their parents. Harriet thought it was ironic for them to complete the gesture when neither of their parents were present – her parents and his mother no longer among the living and his father not bothering to honor an unfavored son. Nevertheless they bowed three times to their absent parents before they turned to each other as husband and wife, kneeled, and gave the final three bows.</p><p>After completing the ceremony, the Good Fortune Matron escorted Harriet to the marriage chambers so she could rest and wait for her husband. He would be receiving the guests’ congratulations and celebrating until the well wishers left.</p><p>The only people in the marriage chambers were Harriet, her nursemaid Hedwig, and the three servant girls the Potter Hou Fu had sent as dowry. It had only been her and Hedwig for so long that she didn't quite know what to do with them yet. The idea that the Dursleys would have ever provided her with handmaids was laughable. But it was just like the Potter family to send her servants to manage like a noble miss only after they had spent the greater part of her life refusing to give her a lady’s education.</p><p>Nothing could stand before Imperial might.</p><p>That was the difference imperial favor made. With it, a neglected daughter could marry into the Imperial house. Without it, who knew when the Potter hou fu would have let her out to see the light of day?</p><p>A joy attendant suddenly announced Xian junwang’s arrival.</p><p>Harriet's spine straightened and hidden in the sleeves of her bridal phoenix cape, her hands clenched unconsciously.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
