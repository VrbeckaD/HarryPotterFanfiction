    <p>
  <span>Pain was a terrible thing. The feeling was pure, undefeated by any other sense as it radiated through his body. Bruises and cuts coated his too thin body, much too small for a 16 year old. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not for much longer,” His voice was raspy, almost as if he had been recently choked, “In a few minutes, just a few more, I’ll be 17. I can leave this place.” He spoke, smug, replying to his thoughts only he could hear. Staring at a blank ceiling with no other sound would make you do that. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He could feel it; the settling of his core, the curse keeping him from doing magic outside of school without trouble slowly disappearing, his upcoming age rushing at him with the ticking of a clock. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The smugness wasn’t all him, he knew. He could feel the sick joy coming from his “family.” The joy that he was old enough to be kicked out, that they wouldn’t have to “care” for him anymore, even though they also lost their communal punching bag. Then there was that little spot in the back of his mind, the voice, somehow connected to Voldemort. Voldemort was smug too, the spell keeping him from his target was soon to end. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Then there was his own smugness. He could finally </span>
  <b>leave</b>
  <span> this place, he could take his few belongings, leave this shit family and fake friends, and be safe. Yes, he would be leaving his few true friends and Hogwarts. He was sure Hogwarts wouldn’t accept him after what he was about to do.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Giggling, he lifted his hands, pressing the palms roughly against his closed eyes, a wide grin spreading his chapped lips. He could laugh forever at the idea, ridding not only himself of the horrid family, but the whole world. They deserved what was coming to them. He didn’t know who he would start with, but he knew who was last. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Petunia, his loving Aunt, the only one that was his actual blood. She may not of ever actually caused him physical harm, but she was the one who withheld food, that forced him to cook and clean. She was the one who stood by and watched what his uncle and cousin did to him. She would be last, after seeing her family, her darling husband and little “Duddiekins” die by his hands. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He laughed again, his legs kicking up and down against his “bed.” Three minutes now. . . Now two. . . And finally one. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As his core finally settled into adulthood, he twisted suddenly, sitting up on the cot, his feet pressing firmly against the floor. He pulled his fingers down his face, scratching with his blunt nails as he felt something else in his mind </span>

  <span> out of place. Bouncing a few times, he stood, his body slumping, moving slow and awkward. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I-” he paused, licking blood off of his lips, “I am Harry Potter. I am now 17, an adult in the wizarding world. I am free of this place.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Laughing once more, he jumped a few times, reveling in his new found freedom and opening the door to his room without lifting a finger. The carpet felt plush against his feet, one of the few body parts that weren’t singing in pain as he stepped. He scraped his hands against the walls of the hallway, dragging dirt, or was that dried blood?, across it. Aunt Petunia would be cross.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry would have skipped down the hall towards the stairs, if Dudley hadn’t chosen that moment to leave his room. He looked shocked at seeing Harry, opening his mouth to state his concern, but Harry refused to give him the chance. Rushing forward, Harry pushed the fat boy back into the room, his hand clamped against his mouth. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They tumbled to the ground, Harry feeling Dudley’s head crash against the ground as he crouched on top of him. He sat there a moment, waiting for Dudley’s wits to return, wanting him to feel everything. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now, now Dudley. You wouldn’t want to make this harder on me, would you?” His grin was terrifying, he could see his reflection in Dudley’s quickly widening eyes. He was shaken, confused, and that was exactly what Harry needed. Usually Dudley could quickly over power him- not now. Not when Harry had his full magical strength and was filled with excited adrenaline. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry let Dudley begin to resist, begin to fight him, letting him have hope, before moving in. He moved slowly, his face leaning down against Dudley’s neck, almost as if they were lovers, before sinking his teeth into the skin there. He felt every rip, every tear as Dudley screamed in shock and pain. Blood rushed into his mouth, and he pulled back quickly, skin still latched firmly in his teeth. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry closed his eyes, bathing in his cousin’s screams. Blood flooded from his mouth as he spit skin and muscle on Dudley’s face. Blood was flowing quickly, Dudley’s fighting slowing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, I did bite deep enough. I almost wasn’t sure, your neck is so fat. . . But, your artery is split! How beautiful. Probably the only time you’ve ever been pretty.” Harry laughed, watching Dudley convulse on the ground. He wanted to watch all of it, but sadly, he didn’t have time. It would have been hard for the others not to hear what transpired. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He could already hear steps from the staircase, light and smooth ones. He could tell it was Petunia before he heard her voice asking Dudley what was wrong, before she made it to the doorway, before she started screaming. Harry turned just in time to see her sprinting clumsily back down the stairs. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry casually stood, stepping almost gracefully down the stairs, the spilt blood already rejuvenating him. He silently locked all of the doors, not letting there be a chance his prey would escape. And, there they were, huddled by the front door together, trying to make it budge.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Petunia screamed again when Harry arrived at the bottom of the stairs, Vernon moving to shield his wife behind him. Tutting disappointedly, Harry sat on the couch, staring at his Aunt and Uncle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Uncle Vernon, you're not the one I want here. I just want the bitch that let all of this happen,” Harry spoke, his voice showing no sign of the insanity, the rage, burning through his skull. His legs crossed, almost instinctively as Vernon seemed to actually be thinking. For once. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fine! You can have her, just let me live,” Vernon pushed Petunia forward, her voice suddenly becoming a disbelieving squeak. She stood, shaking as Harry looked them over.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I never said that, Uncle Vernon. There’s no peace for someone who would give up someone else to save their own ass,” Harry smiled, almost sadly, as he lifted his hand in the direction of the fat man. He felt his magic constrict around the man’s throat, squeezing with no chance of release. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry looked peaceful as he watched Vernon’s face quickly turn blue, then violet. Blood vessels popped in the man’s eyes as he fell to his knees, his hands scratching at his own throat as he gasped for any air possible. Harry held him there, even after he stopped struggling, even after his eyes exploded in a mass of blood and gore. Harry held him there until he finally had his fill of seeing the abusive shit with a purple tinted face and lack of eyeballs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He felt a great thrill in seeing the body slump and sag against the floor, blood spreading against the once fine carpet, but anger flooded his senses when he noticed his darling aunt was no longer in the room, having run out as soon as the torture started. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry followed her to the kitchen, smiling in amusement when he noticed her hiding in the corner, her arms outstretched towards him with a knife. The sad thing was, he knew he didn’t have long before the order showed up for him, so he knew he couldn’t drag it out as long as he wanted. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He didn’t say anything as he forced her to lift her arms and plunge the knife into her own stomach. Nothing, as she moved her arms mechanically, her face and voice showing the true her as the knife slid past her skin again and again. Blood splattered against the walls, her arms moving more and more violently, her screams turning into gurgling mumbles as she began to slump, her body finally giving in to the pain. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry released a joyous shout, tears finally falling as he knew he was finally free of the horrid family. They were gone, would never come for him. No one could, where he was going. He was free, free to be himself, to let his true colors shine. He was free to let the voices telling him what to do to take over. He didn’t need this world anymore.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His laughter stopped as soon as it began, his face falling flat, removing all emotion. He had just killed the only family he had left, and could never return to his friends. He was lost, but at least he knew where to go.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Pops sounded outside, the sign of apparition. It was now or never for him as he escaped out the back door, climbed over the fence, and sprinted with bare feet into the woods. He knew where to go, a place he had hidden a few times before, a place no one else knew about.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He let his thoughts release themselves, moving in autopilot as his feet pounded against the muddy ground, sticks and rocks poking and slicing his skin. He didn’t care about that anymore. He was home. </span>
