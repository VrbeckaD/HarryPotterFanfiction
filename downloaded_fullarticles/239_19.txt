    <p>"New York? What the hell are we going to go do in America that we can't do here?" Harry asked his bedmate, both naked as the day they were born.</p><p> </p><p>"Trust me, love. Once we get there, I can show you pleasures you've never even dreamed of," Sanguini whispered into Harry's ear, kissing his neck in the process.</p><p> </p><p>"And why can't you show me these pleasures in this bed?" Harry asked, setting himself on the vampires’ strong lap.</p><p> </p><p>"There's something… someone you must meet," Sanguini said erotically.</p><p> </p><p>"If you wanted a threesome, I could've just gotten a hold of that werewolf Romulus from the pack in London. I'm sure he could ignore the whole," pointing to his own teeth, "vampire thing."</p><p> </p><p>Chuckling, Sanguini used his vampire speed to scoop up Harry and push him against the wall, his legs wrapped around his waist. "Trust me, love. This man is more than just a normal bed partner."</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>"This is the last bloody time I sleep with a fucking vampire," Harry grumbled to the pair driving the van he was being transported in.</p><p> </p><p>"Werewolves? They're fantastic in bed and are very nice to cuddle with. Wizards? Clingy and annoying, but very kinky. You lot, the American wiccans-witches-warlocks-whatever the hell you call yourselves? Second worst of the bunch. The one guy was so pretty but he wouldn't just shut his arse up about how my kind abuse nature and-"</p><p> </p><p>"Shut. The. Fuck. Up!" The witch yelled, tightening the strength of the binding spell on his chains, making it much more uncomfortable than it already was.</p><p> </p><p>"Can you at least explain to me why the two of you showed up after Sanguini left me high and dry in New York?" Harry snarked back, making sure to distract them from the magic he was pouring into breaking the lock that bound him.</p><p> </p><p>The woman of the pair looked at her companion with a very unflattering sneer, silently communicating whatever it was that these types of lackeys did. Harry wasn't under the illusion that they were independent; far more menacing and deadly have tried the boy with too many damn names.</p><p> </p><p>"Your services are needed. For whatever reason, our master thinks he needs your powers to help him…" She said, her sarcasm evident in what he could only explain as an audible eye roll.</p><p> </p><p>"So, your… master couldn't hire some sell-wand here in America?" Harry asked.</p><p> </p><p>It seemed as their short conversation was the limit of their exchange, as the two continued to ignore his incessant questioning. Once Harry got the gist, he ceased his mouthing off, instead, focusing on trying to escape.</p><p> </p><p>That is until a wave of dizziness hit him, and the last thing he saw was the smirking faces of his captors.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <em>"Phesmatos Ensomnos"… the lighting of a flame… the opening of a box… "Elena"… </em>

</p><p>Harry tried his best to open his eyes and get up, but the fatigue and exhaustion his body was plagued with did very little to assist. His breathing was uneven, and his senses were on fire. The only thing he could make out with clarity was the magic in the air; whoever was casting had to have been doing something killer for them to generate that much energy.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, I see our guest of honor has decided to join us in the waking world!" An accented voice flitted through the air.</p><p> </p><p>Harry supported himself the best he could to try and sit up, but it took the assistance of a foreign arm to lift him all the way. And unfortunately for him, that arm was an ounce too strong and left him disoriented sitting up.</p><p> </p><p>When he came to, he could make out in the room, two women and two other men. The two he recognized as his kidnappers were hanging in the back, while the other woman was off to the side, looking with withheld fascination.</p><p> </p><p>"And here I am not even dressed accordingly," Harry said, trying to mask his unsureness of the situation with his beloved brand of British sarcasm. "And here you are not even introducing yourselves…"</p><p> </p><p>"Who the hell do you think you are talking to-" the woman ranted, shutting her mouth at the flick of the man’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>Kneeling to eye level, the admittedly attractive man smirked before speaking, "my name is Klaus Mikaelson. That lovely lady to your right is Katerina Petrova, and the two in the back are my loyal assistants Greta and Maddox."</p><p> </p><p>"I figured they were lackeys, not even enough juice to bind me up and knock me out on their own. Had to channel a damn vampire and yet they still couldn't do it comp-"</p><p> </p><p>"Silence!" Greta yelled, holding up her palm in what he assumed was casting a spell. Though, with the pitiful amount of magic she used to fuel it, he couldn't fathom a vampire outsourcing for her talents.</p><p> </p><p>With a quick shrug and sharp stare, Harry used his wandless magic to bounce the spell back, causing her to crumple to the ground. Surprisingly, none of the other occupants even bat an eyelash. In fact, the handsome man, Klaus as he now knew, chuckled and hadn't removed his eyes from Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"Aren't you going to help out your witch friend? Her kind doesn't do well when they get their arses handed to them," Harry said, canceling his spell and watching her lie still.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh well, seeing as she's the one knocked out now, I guess that means she deserved it. Besides, she's not that important to the big picture," Klaus said, charisma and cockiness oozing from his velvet-smooth voice.</p><p> </p><p>"And what is the big picture?" Harry whispered.</p><p> </p><p>"You'll find out soon enough. I just need to make sure I can get all my pieces in place. Tonight is a full moon, you know?" Klaus said, standing up to walk towards the unconscious man he now realized was across the room.</p><p> </p><p>"The bloody hell does that mean…" Harry whispered, knowing the man would hear him.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>I Don’t Think There’s Much Left of Me</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>"It's me! It's me! I swear!" Alaric said, his hands up in surrender, explaining to the crowd gathered in the Salvatore foyer that he was no longer possessed. After an intense turned awkward proofing of self, Alaric was led to sit and rest while the others gathered.</p><p> </p><p>"Why the hell did he send you back then?!" Damon Salvatore asked his drinking partner.</p><p> </p><p>"To give you guys a message. It happens tonight, the sacrifice happens tonight," the man confessed, frowning as he glanced at Elena's form, her body visibly shaking.</p><p> </p><p>"Dammit! God fucking dammit!" Damon yelled, throwing a liquor glass to the opposing wall as the group moved into the main room.</p><p> </p><p>Flinching as the glass shattered, Elena looked on as the chaos that had always followed her began to encroach on her last sanctuary of peace.</p><p> </p><p>"That's not helping, Damon," Stefan said, coming to stand next to where Elena had chosen to take a seat.</p><p> </p><p>"And standing around while this fucker continues to play us like chess pieces isn't helping either, brother!" Damon yelled, taking out his aggression by pouring himself another big gulp of bourbon.</p><p> </p><p>"My brother is a creature of habit when he wants to achieve his goals. Spontaneous and sometimes monstrous he may be, but sloppy and unplanned he certainly is not. Frankly sending a messenger isn't that surprising. He has his pieces, he only needs to make his move," Elijah explained, walking away from the crowd to stand in front of them.</p><p> </p><p>"You sure about that?" Alaric interjected, earning a look from them all. "Cause there might be a new player."</p><p> </p><p>That got the group to halt all complaints and earned Alaric a confused but composed look from the Original.</p><p> </p><p>"New player?" Elijah asked.</p><p> </p><p>"I couldn't get a name, but it seemed like Klaus had him express delivered to my apartment. At least, that's what I overheard one of his minions complain about. I think… he might be a witch," Alaric supposed.</p><p> </p><p>"Great! Now we have three witch henchmen to fucking deal with!" Damon sarcastically said.</p><p> </p><p>Ignoring him, Alaric continued on, "he was young, probably around Elena's age, maybe a bit older; had black hair and these crazy green eyes. He seemed to be just as confused to be there as I was."</p><p> </p><p>"And you came to this conclusion how?" Elijah questioned.</p><p> </p><p>"The look on his face. When Klaus shoved me out, he gave me this look. I don't know what it was, but… it didn't seem like he was there of his own free will, is all I'm saying," Alaric finished.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, this is all so damn interesting, but I don't get how psychoanalyzing an extra backup witch is going to help Elena not die!" Damon insisted, irritated at the conversation being detoured.</p><p> </p><p>"It means that things have changed… or will change. All the curse needs to be broken is a werewolf, a vampire, and a-"</p><p> </p><p>"Doppelganger," Elena filled in herself, her voice as shaky as ever.</p><p> </p><p>"-and a witch to cast the spell. If he's gotten another piece on the board, it means we cannot be one hundred percent certain his course of action will remain the same. Is there anything else you can give us?" Elijah finished, questioning the history teacher turned hunter.</p><p> </p><p>"Something about a wand… I think? Or maybe it was another word, I don't know," Alaric said, missing the pensive look on Elijah's face.</p><p> </p><p>"I see… well, I must agree with Damon, then. We cannot dwell on this any longer with the ceremony happening tonight."</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>I Don’t Think There’s Much Left of Me</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>"So… why does sexy psycho vampire have you hauled up in this place?" Harry asked Katherine, crossing his arms as he eyed the devious minx.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, let's just say you don't piss off someone who can hold a grudge for centuries," she snarked, wanting the inquisitive boy to leave her be.</p><p> </p><p>"What? Did you spill tea on his favorite pantyhose back in the day or something? Kill his puppy? Fuck his father?" Harry asked with equal snark.</p><p> </p><p>"If I wasn't compelled, I just want you to know that if I could, I would tear your throat out with my teeth, stick it back down your puny human esophagus, and watch and laugh as you choke on your own throat," Katherine threatened, annoyed at his incessant babbling.</p><p> </p><p>"How does that whole compulsion thing work, since I'm guessing by your violent threats, you're also a vampire?" Harry said, ignoring the woman's threat.</p><p> </p><p>"You… really don't know who the hell you're dealing with, huh?" She asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Like I said when tweedle Dee and tweedle Dumb left, I don't know why the fuck I was brought here. Since you seem to know a lot about him, I figured maybe you could fill me in!" Harry answered back.</p><p> </p><p>"He's… Klaus is trying to break a curse…" Katherine started before Harry interrupted.</p><p> </p><p>"There's always some damn ancient curse, isn't there. If he knows about my kind, I don't know why the hell he couldn't just hire a curse breaker," Harry said, mumbling the last part to himself.</p><p> </p><p>"Your kind?" Katherine asked, doing what she did best: observing and planning twenty steps ahead.</p><p> </p><p>"Well-" Harry tried to say before the door to the apartment swung open to reveal that the man had returned.</p><p> </p><p>"No need to waste your pretty voice on someone like Katerina anymore, Harry," Klaus said with a smile, bypassing the boy and going eye level with Katherine, "you'll stop pestering Harry now, love. Now go to that room and don't come out until you're told."</p><p> </p><p>At his command, Katherine got up and walked towards the bathroom, closing the door behind her. "Now then, we're all alone."</p><p> </p><p>"Under different circumstances, I feel like I'd be much more positive about being alone with someone like you," Harry said, earning mirth filled laughter from Klaus.</p><p> </p><p>"Agreed, love. But time is of the essence and I need your help," Klaus said.</p><p> </p><p>"Katherine said you had a curse you wanted to break. And if you know what I am, you'd know there are probably a thousand others who actually are in that line of work that would go <em>willingly </em>with you," Harry said back.</p><p> </p><p>Placing that sinful mouth of his by Harry's ear, the vampire whispered, "No… it needs to be you, boy who lived." At his title, Harry stiffened.</p><p> </p><p>"Not even a year old and already passed through the Other Side. In my millennium of life, never have I heard of any supernatural being to come back all on their lonesome. But here was a boy, born of the witches and wizards who choose to keep away from us lot, thinking themselves as high and mighty, a hero to the masses," Klaus's arm began to slide down Harry's arm, with a sensuous touch, "once again passing through and back. It's hard to keep up with you lot, but when you know who to ask…"</p><p> </p><p>"What does… that have to do with your curse?" Harry whispered carefully.</p><p> </p><p>"Everything," Klaus said, sending chills through Harry's body.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, I'm sorry to say I don't work well with people who kidnap me!" Harry said, steeling his nerves enough to fire off a <em>Stupefy.</em></p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it seemed as though Klaus' vampire speed was enough to dodge the spell and give him time to shove Harry against the wall before he could fire off another. Smirking like the devil, Klaus trapped the boy in his grip, ghosting his fangs on the boy’s carotid artery.</p><p> </p><p>"One bite and you'll be bleeding out on the floor, love, so I suggest you listen and make a wise decision," Klaus said as his hand traveled below Harry's waist, causing his breath to hitch. "You may be powerful, but you are nothing to a predator like me. So, how's about it? Help me break my curse and I'll give you <em>whatever </em>you want<em>.</em>"</p><p> </p><p>"…Like… hell…" Harry said between heated breaths, before casting a <em>Repulso </em>to get the man off of him.</p><p> </p><p>Smirking, Klaus took a moment to drink in the disheveled wizard before vamp-speeding to get Harry into a chokehold. "Feisty lover, huh? Just my type."</p><p> </p><p>As if trying to physically squeeze out the air in Harry's lungs, Klaus pressed as hard as he needed before he was begging for air. At the sign of feigned resistance, Klaus let him go and knelt while Harry tried to catch his breath.</p><p> </p><p>Leading his head up gently, Klaus stared into Harry's emerald eyes, his pupils dilating, "now listen, love. I'm going to need you to do some things for me when the time comes…"</p>
