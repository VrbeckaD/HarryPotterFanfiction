    <p>Sirius woke up at five thirty in the morning – unusually early for him, as he was normally not a morning person. It took him a few seconds to remember what day it was, then grinned excitedly to himself before rushing out of bed to wake up James and Peter – also checking on Remus, who was still asleep. </p><p>He woke James, clamping his hand down on his mouth before he could cry out and possibly wake the other two boys. James glared at him, but didn’t do much else, just struggled around, trying to wriggle away from Sirius grip. He succeeded with a smile but didn’t say anything. He stood up and straightened out his pyjamas, beckoning for Sirius to follow him to Peter’s bed. </p><p>After waking him up, James and Peter started getting dressed and showering to give Sirius some time alone with Remus. They did remind him, however, to put a silencing charm on the bed before doing anything, which just made him grin mischievously and roll his eyes. </p><p>He carefully opened Remus’ bed curtains, ignoring the wolf-whistles from James. He closed the red curtains again, then slid under the covers to join his werewolf boyfriend, who grunted in annoyance at the disruption of his sleep and turned his back to the other boy. Sirius just laughed. </p><p>“Happy birthday, Moony,” whispered Sirius in Remus’ ear, making him laugh a little too. </p><p>The werewolf grunted again but turned back around to hug his boyfriend close to him, closing his eyes sleepily after just being woken up. “Thank you, Pads. Love you,” he mumbled. </p><p>“I love you too, Moons. My Moony. I love you,” said Sirius, grinning. “I’m so lucky to have you. Today’s gonna be all about you, I promise. You deserve everything good that happens today.” </p><p>“You’re so cute, Pads,” said Remus, opening his eyes just to look at the smiling boy in front of him. He was gorgeous even this early in the morning and after having just woken up too, with his shoulder-length black tucked nicely behind his ears, his misty grey eyes sparkling in the minimal sunlight reaching the couple through the curtains.</p><p>“Will you two lovebirds hurry the fuck up, please?” called James. “I know it’s a Saturday, but I would like some breakfast today.” </p><p>“James, it’s five fucking A.M. on my bloody birthday,” replied Remus, a smirk on his scarred face. “If I wanna spend it with my twat of a boyfriend, then I will.” </p><p>“Alright, Moony,” said James. They could hear in his voice that he was trying not to laugh. “Happy birthday, by the way, mate!” </p><p>Remus thanked him, then after a final hug, with a lot of kissing, Sirius dragged his boyfriend out of the bed to open his presents and cards before breakfast. Remus agreed reluctantly. He couldn’t help laughing along with Sirius as he hurriedly tried to get the other boy dressed and ready for the day. Remus had to admit – it was adorable. </p><p>After everyone was showered and dressed, Sirius excitedly stacked the presents on the end of Remus’ bed, making a little pyramid. Remus beamed in awe, and Sirius couldn’t help giving him another birthday kiss. James rolled his eyes while Peter looked away, a small smile on his face. </p><p>“Go on, then!” said Sirius impatiently. “Open them!” </p><p>“You know, you really are like an excited little puppy,” said Remus with amusement, moving toward the mound of wrapped gifts – most in crimson and gold (Gryffindor colours) paper. “Your Animagus form makes a lot of sense.”</p><p>“Open mine last, cos I want you to spend the longest looking at it,” said Sirius and Remus agreed, with a little confused shrug, but said nothing else. </p><p>He got books and chocolate from both his parents and Lily. Marlene and Dorcas got him an array of sweets with Chocolate Frogs and BBEFB. Lily and Mary had chipped into the sweet collection too – buying a range of muggle treats as well. James, Peter and Remus’ parents had all come together to buy him a new gold watch as it was his 17th – a wizarding tradition according to James. Peter had bought a big hardback copy of a muggle book he’d asked for as well as more chocolate, and James had got him a denim jacket and a few books Lily had recommended. </p><p>He’d left Sirius’ present until last, as demanded, and his boyfriend was now literally jumping up and down with anticipation. Remus glanced suspiciously over at him, then James, who just shrugged. He sighed then tore off the paper, a look of confusion on his face when he found an ordinary hardback copy of The Essential Defence Against the Dark Arts by Arsenius Jigger. </p><p>Remus frowned, looking to Sirius for help. The other boy was still smiling eagerly, waiting for the big surprise. “Turn to page 394,” he said mysteriously, making Remus even more confused and suspicious as he knew that was the werewolf page. </p><p>He flicked through the book – every page was completely normal – until getting to the page requested, and a pleasantly exasperated smile spread on his face. Instead of the snarling image of a wolf like usual, there was a picture of a blushing Remus Lupin holding his boyfriend’s hand waving up at him. Sirius had even changed most of the text; he’d changed the M.O.M. rating from a XXXXX to a X with a little note in brackets reading: ‘He folds his socks, for Merlin’s sake, forgive me for not trembling in fright.’ Remus couldn’t help laughing at that.</p><p>“Moony, could you please tell me where one can commonly find werewolves?” asked Sirius, grinning like an idiot as he watched Remus’ expression. </p><p>The werewolf’s eyes darted along the page, skipping over all the other edits (werewolves apparently own fifty over-sized knitted jumpers, and love chocolate, and can’t be frightening even if they try). </p><p>He found what Sirius had asked for, and replied with an amused smile, “In Sirius Black’s arms, hang on, does this say… or bed?” he said. </p><p>“Correct,” said Sirius, still beaming and bursting with excitement. “So, what do you think?” </p><p>Remus laughed a little. “I love it. And I love you. Thank you, Pads.” </p><p>“Love you too, Moony,” replied Sirius with a shy little grin. “And, you’re very welcome.”</p>
