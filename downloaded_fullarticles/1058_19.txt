    <p>CHAPTER 1: November 1, 1981</p>
<p>In the early morning of November 1, 1981, Petunia Dursley got up early to start making breakfast for her husband and toddler.  Upon opening the door to get the paper and set out the bottles for the milkman she was met with a startling sight.</p>
<p>“VERNON!” She screeched and her husband rushed down the stairs to stand in the doorway with her. The two looked down at their doorstep where a dark-haired baby was sleeping in a basket.</p>
<p>“Who is that?” Vernon asked hoping his wife had an explanation for this strange turn of events</p>
<p>“I think it's Hadrian.  But he doesn’t look right...Get the gloves Lily gave me out from under the stairs and start up the fireplace.”  Vernon walks away from his wife to grab the dragonhide gloves his sister in law left on her last visit.  </p>
<p>“Here you are Pet,” Vernon says handing his wife the gloves.</p>
<p>“Thank you.  Get some of Dudley’s old things for him to wear and a fresh diaper from upstairs.  DO NOT touch anything that is on Hadrian right now especially that letter.  I’ll be in the kitchen giving him a bath, then we need to burn everything but the letter.  Lily gave me a safe way to transport it if something like this should happen.”</p>
<p>“Got it.  I’ll be back down in a few minutes and I’ll check to see if Dudley’s awake yet.”</p>
<p>“Thank you!  You know this means we will probably need to move.”</p>
<p>“We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it Pet”</p>
<p>Vernon heads upstairs as Petunia dons the dragonhide gloves that her beloved sister had given her for her birthday.  They were stronger than any muggle gloves on the market and she loved using them in her garden while Dudley napped.  She carried the basket to the kitchen and set on the counter as she filled the kitchen sink to give the baby she hoped was little Hadrian a bath, the dark-haired child started to stir.</p>
<p>“Mummy,” The baby said and Petunia looked over at the child breathing a sigh of relief when she saw Lily’s green eyes, she didn’t know what they had done to her poor nephew but he no longer looked the same as when she saw him 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>“Good Morning Hadrian!  Mummy’s not here, but Auntie is going to give a bath before we have breakfast”</p>
<p>“Duddy? Unca?”</p>
<p>“Your Uncle is getting Dudley up once you are all clean you two can play!”  The dark-haired baby clapped his hands and giggled, excited to play with his cousin.</p>
<p>Petunia got the sink filled and undressed her nephew to put him in the bath.  Hadrian happily splashed in the water as if nothing was amiss.  Petunia smiled at the boy and washed off his tiny body, hoping to get any magic or potions that lingered on his skin off.  She goes to wash his hair and Hadrian starts crying.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, sweetheart?”</p>
<p>“Hurts”</p>
<p>“Your head hurts?”  The teary-eyed toddler nods his head vigorously at his Aunt.  She pushes his hair to the side and sees the lightning shaped cut covering his forehead.</p>
<p>“Poor baby, I’m sorry sweetie, but I need you to be brave for Auntie and let me finish washing your hair.  Once we get you all clean I will take you to the doctor and find your Daddy ok?”</p>
<p>“Otay… miss daddy n mummy”</p>
<p>“I know sweetie, but I don’t think I’m going to be able to find Mummy”  </p>
<p>Vernon brings Dudley and a change of clothes for Hadrian into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Well if it isn’t my favorite nephew!  Is Auntie getting you all clean?”</p>
<p>“Unca! Baf time!” </p>
<p>“Yes, it is little guy!  Dudley and I are start breakfast Pet, I already called work and told them I couldn’t come in today.  Lily’s magic box is on the table.” Vernon kisses his wife on the cheek and places Dudley in his highchair.  He moves around the kitchen starting breakfast.</p>
<p>“Okay Hadrian, I’m gonna do your hair now.  Be brave for Auntie”  The small boy nods his head seriously as his Aunt works the shampoo in and rinses it out as quickly as possible.  She holds the baby up over the sink letting the dirty water drain out and rinsing him one last time with clean water.  After drying him off she dresses him in Dudley’s old clothing and hands him over to Vernon.</p>
<p>“Hey, little buddy!  You ready to have breakfast with Dudley?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I hungry”</p>
<p>Sitting down across from Dudley's high chair with Harry in his lap Vernon gives each baby a mashed banana and some baby cereal.</p>
<p>“who dat?” Dudley asks his father pointing at the toddler in his lap.</p>
<p>“It's your cousin Hadrian, Dudders.”</p>
<p>“No!” pulling at his own hair Dudley says “Ri red, wike aunt Lily!!”</p>
<p>Petunia comes back into the room and sits next to Dudley and says “some bad people hurt your cousin that's why he looks different”</p>
<p>“you fix?” Dudley asks starting to tear up </p>
<p>“Yes baby, Mummy is going to take him to get fixed after breakfast”</p>
<p>Dudley nods looking as serious as a 2-year-old can then goes back to his breakfast.</p>
<p>“I burned everything that he came with except for the letter.  It's in Lily's box.  I'll use the portkey she left me to take Hadrian to Gringotts after breakfast.”</p>
<p>“Alright Pet, Dudders and I will go pick up some things for Hadrian we don't have the right size diapers and I'll get him a few outfits and toys.”</p>
<p>“Good, we have a plan.  Hopefully, the goblins can reverse whatever was done to him and find his father.”</p>
<p>“If not we can take care of him, love.  You know enough about his world that we can contain any accidents when they start happening.”</p>
<p>“How do you know about accidental magic.”</p>
<p>“I asked Lily, in case Dudders has magic.”</p>
<p>“Smart, it does run the family.”</p>
<p>The two finish breakfast in silence while the babies babble at each other.  Once the family is finished with breakfast, Petunia takes Hadrian from her husband “Ok baby, we are gonna go to see Griphook.”</p>
<p>“Otay.  Daddy?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we will see if they can find Daddy.  Vernon, be safe and have fun at the store with Dudley.”<br/>
Petunia kisses her husband on the cheek, settles Hadrian on her hip, picks up the box from the table and the picks up an old coke bottle.  She holds Hadrian and her Coke bottle portkey tightly and says the activation word “Evans”</p>
