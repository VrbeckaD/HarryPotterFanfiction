    <p>Mark leapt into the car the moment it arrived, barely paying any attention to the details except the vital fact that it was his Uber ride. He sank down into the carseat with a miserable sigh. The driver glanced at him with slight surprise, but pulled out into the street on the way to their destination regardless.</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose there’s any chance we’ll get there in time for two?” Mark asked, his eyes on the clock. He knew it was impossible, but still a part of him hoped desperately that somehow it would be possible.</p>
<p>“Hmmm…” the driver muttered, glancing at the map on the satnav display thoughtfully, “What do you need to be there by two for?”</p>
<p>“I have a job interview,” Mark confessed, fidgeting as if his movement could make the car go faster or time go slower, “My absolute dream job and I’m going to be late,”</p>
<p>“Hmmm…” the driver murmured again, shifting slightly in his seat to reach for something just outside of Mark’s field of view, “Bit tricky but I’ll see what I can do. I do know a few short cuts…”</p>
<p>“Really?” Mark said, his hopes suddenly resurrected as he struggled to remain realistic. Even with a few shortcuts he knew that there was no way he would make it on time, though he was at the point of being willing to sell his soul to the Devil if it would shave off a few seconds.</p>
<p>The car drove on, with Mark checking his appearance as best he could using his phone camera, straightening his tie and hoping all the while. Google Maps had claimed that it would take longer than he had available to make it to his interview, even with Uber as the fastest option. He still had faint hopes that he would stand a chance even if he was a bit late. Worry playing at his mind, he kept checking the location and estimated times on his phone. Sometimes it had difficultly locating them, frustrating his frazzled nerves more, their spot on the map jumping around wildly. He hated it when it did that, certain locations just being unbearably erratic. The estimated time until their arrival did seem to be decreasing dramatically though, so that at least made him feel better.</p>
<p>“Bad day?” the driver asked as he carefully navigated his way through the streets, clearly knowing exactly where he was going.</p>
<p>“Awful,” Mark said vehemently, “I’ve been working towards this job all my life and finally got an interview, but today just everything’s been going wrong. You’d think I were cursed or something, it’s been that bad. Alarm didn’t go off, overslept, hot water didn’t come on so I showered in the cold, spilt coffee on my shirt so I had to buy a new one, the whole works. You name it it went wrong,”</p>
<p>“Oh no,” the driver said, sympathy emanating from him in abundance, “Oh that does sound rather like a curse… But you’ll be alright now, I’ll get you there in time,”</p>
<p>Mark sighed, hopeful and reassured by the kind words.</p>
<p>“I’m Arthur Weasley, by the way,” the driver continued, taking a turn that Mark hadn’t realised was physically possible for a car.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you,” Mark said, “I’m Mark, the unluckiest man alive,”</p>
<p>“We’ll break the curse,” Arthur reassured him, a confidence in his tone that surprised Mark. It was almost like he knew for certain that no matter the distance or traffic issues they would arrive on time for his job interview. It sounded almost as if he believed Mark actually was cursed, even though Mark knew there was no such thing as magic or curses.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Mark replied with a shrug. Despite all logic suggesting otherwise, they did seem to be drawing close to their destination, the buildings changing to look like the photographs he had spent hours studying the night before in tense anticipation. </p>
<p>The car drew to a halt as Mark looked at his watch. He had only a matter of minutes to spare, but somehow he had arrived in time. It was as if Arthur was a wizard, somehow able to work magic to defy reality and somehow make the journey with a few precious minutes to spare. It was close, far closer than he would have liked, but it was far far better than he had dared to hope for.</p>
<p>“Made it,” Arthur said with satisfaction, turning to smile at Mark, “Good luck with the interview!”</p>
<p>“Thank you!” Mark cried, the shock at the sudden turn of luck nearly bringing him to tears, “Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>“Let me know if you get it!” Arthur said, his face full of encouragement as Mark exited the car, already running through all the possible questions the interviewers could ask him.</p>
<p>As Mark headed into the building rising before him, Arthur surreptitiously slipped his wand back into his pocket and withdrew his phone to check for any new messages, wondering if any new customers were in need of his service.</p>
<p>Weeks later, when the results came back, Mark hesitated slightly before messaging Arthur. He had never before messaged any of his Uber drivers about anything, but without Arthur he wouldn’t have made it in time for the interview. The old man had been kind and supportive too, so he typed out a quick message.</p>
<p>‘I got the job! Thank you!’ he sent, not really expecting a reply.</p>
<p>Moments later he got a text saying ‘Great! You’re going to be fantastic!’ followed by a photograph. Arthur had taken a selfie, not the most flattering one possible and slightly blurred, but full of emotion. He had a big grin on his face and was giving Mark an enthusiastic thumbs up.</p>
<p>Mark laughed, glad that he’d been lucky enough to get Arthur as his driver and glad that he’d decided to message him with the news.</p>
<p>‘If I ever need a ride against the clock I know who to ask now’ he typed out, happy with the way his life had turned around so completely from the disastrous morning before getting into Arthur’s car.</p>
<p>He smiled as he read Arthur’s response of ’Anytime :)’ and went about his day with a lightness to his step.</p>
