    <p class="western">"Are you ready?" Ginny asked, leaning against the door-jamb to the bathroom.</p><p class="western">"Just about," Harry replied absently as she carefully applied the last of the make-up to her face. “What about Hermione?” she asked, staring intently at her own reflection as she put away the mascara.</p><p class="western">“Already downstairs, waiting,” Ginny said with a grin.</p><p class="western">Harry sighed, a smile tugging on her lips despite her best efforts to keep up a serious expression.</p><p class="western">“Yes, I'm slow,” she said, closing the small handbag Ginny had made her buy the day before, for this very night. “It's difficult to apply make-up with the scar,” she said with a shrug.</p><p class="western">Ginny gave a simple nod, acknowledging that the lightning bolt flashing down her face <em>would</em> make things a tad more complicated. Just the act of painting her eyes would turn into an artistic feat, what with the scar tissue intersecting both her eyebrows and eyelids.</p><p class="western">“So what is this place we're going?” Harry asked, walking with Ginny down the stairs to the ground floor of Hermione's parent's new house.</p><p class="western">“A really fancy club,” Ginny smirked over her shoulder at her, making Harry grimace right back at her. “One of those muggle places you can dance, drink, find a good-looking bloke for a night of fun,” Ginny said airily.</p><p class="western">Harry laughed. “Don't let Ron hear you say that,” she warned with a wicked grin. Ron had been sulking enough over this Girl's-night-out thing, as he so gracefully called it. If he thought Hermione might flirt with strange men, he'd have a conniption.</p><p class="western">Ginny rolled her eyes. “Ron needs to loosen up and trust his bloody girlfriend,” was all she had to say about that. “There's nothing stopping you an' me from having a blast, though.”</p><p class="western">Harry very carefully didn't roll <em>her</em> eyes at that.</p><p class="western">“Everyone ready?” Hermione asked with an excited smile when they entered the kitchen.</p><p class="western">“Yes,” Harry answered, smoothing down the thin, rather flimsy dress she'd let Ginny bully her into buying during yesterday's shopping trip. It was a very dark red, looking almost the same shade as wine, in certain light. Harry was just glad it had a modest cut, and sleeves that went down to her hands.</p><p class="western">A pair of stockings masked the worst of the scars on her legs.</p><p class="western">“Good!” Hermione jumped up from the chair she'd been sitting in by the kitchen table, her mother giving her a fond smile. “Let's go!”</p><p class="western">“I'd think you'd be at least a little more reluctant,” Harry muttered under her breath, making Ginny snigger quietly.</p><p class="western">“Oh, shush, you. I've never done this before, and I think it's going to be exciting,” Hermione smiled, striding towards the hallway.</p><p class="western">“Have a nice night out, and be careful, love!” Dan, Hermione's father, called from the sitting room as they walked past, looking up from his book.</p><p class="western">“Will do, dad!” Hermione called back.</p><p class="western">“Have a nice evening, Mr Granger,” Harry added with a smile and then followed her two friends out the door. “How are we even supposed to dance in these shoes?” she asked as they walked down the street towards the bus-stop.</p><p class="western">“Harry, I have seen you on a broom,” Ginny snorted, eyeing her like she thought she was being an idiot. “You, if anyone, does not have any issues with your balance.”</p><p class="western">“These shoes are nothing like a broom,” Harry muttered, eyeing her admittedly very pretty shoes with some trepidation. The heels on the things could be used as lethal weapons. “And if you hadn't noticed, we are currently walking, while flying does not require contact with the ground,” she said dryly.</p><p class="western">“Oh, loosen up, Harry!” Ginny grinned, looping her arm through Harry's. “We're going to have <em>fun</em>!”</p><p class="western">“You never know, you might even find someone you fancy,” Hermione added with a laugh, treading her arm through Harry's other one, sandwiching her between them.</p><p class="western">Harry groaned. “I'm not letting you two lunatics drag me out for this to find someone to snog,” she said, exasperated and reluctantly amused. “And I wish Luna could have come with us.”</p><p class="western">“No, but you need to relax a bit, Harry. And being snogged senseless is a perfectly relaxing endeavour,” Ginny replied, managing to sound far too snooty to be anything even resembling serious. “Luna can come with us on the next one, when she's gotten back to Britain,” she added a bit more solemnly.</p><p class="western">Harry tried to affect an offended air, but burst out laughing.</p><p class="western">.</p><p class="western">By the time they reached the club, all three of them were in high spirits, laughing and joking and acting their ages.</p><p class="western">All three of them were teenagers, still, even if it was a near thing in Hermione's case.</p><p class="western">In the Muggle world, they'd be counted as something closer to children than adults.</p><p class="western">They weren't.</p><p class="western">After the war, none of them had felt much like their ages any more. Not that the years leading up to it had let them be all that childish, either, but...</p><p class="western">With a determined smile, Harry shoved the darkening thought aside, and took the drink Ginny handed her. It was bright red and sweet, but still leaving a burning trail down her throat.</p><p class="western">The place -club- was surprisingly classy, with plenty of tables and seats along the sides around the main dance floor. It was dark with coloured lights mainly around the broiling dance floor, music blaring from all around and it was warm in a way that spoke of many people packed tightly together.</p><p class="western">“Come on!” Harry had to shout to be heard above the music. “We came here to dance, so let's dance!” And she proceeded to drag Hermione to the dance floor together with Ginny, who was practically bouncing giddily.</p><p class="western">The press of sweaty bodies around them was... not very pleasant, but Harry was rather determined to have a good time. So she fell into the rhythm of the song currently playing, playfully shoving Ginny when she pressed too close and encouraging Hermione to 'let loose'.</p><p class="western">After some time to adjust, it was a surprising amount of fun.</p><p class="western">When all three of them were breathless with laughter and exertion, Ginny dragged the two of them back to the bar area and ordered all three of them shots.</p><p class="western">Harry eyed the tiny glass a bit doubtfully, but downed the liquid it contained, trying not to grimace at the taste. The drink Hermione had ordered her had at least tasted good.</p><p class="western">“Urgh. That's disgusting,” Harry laughed, setting the empty glass on the counter and watching Hermione wrinkle her nose when she took a cautious sip.</p><p class="western">“That's not how you do it, Hermione!” Ginny admonished, having already downed her own glass. “Come on, be brave!”</p><p class="western">Hermione, in response to the friendly needling, raised an unimpressed eyebrow and very calmly tipped the alcohol down her throat. When she had swallowed the last of it, she gave a dramatic shudder.</p><p class="western">“I'm ordering the next round,” she declared firmly, before grinning at Ginny's offended look.</p><p class="western">“I thought Harry would get a turn next?” Ginny asked, moving slightly to the beat of the music, her hair swaying behind her like a smooth, silky curtain.</p><p class="western">“I think I'll get us all a glass of water each,” was Harry's answer to that, making her red-headed friend groan.</p><p class="western">“Stop being so- so responsible! Not even Hermione's doing it! We're here to have <em>fun</em>!”</p><p class="western">“Yes, we are. I don't know about you, though, but I don't want to spend all day tomorrow throwing up and feeling like I've been run over by a herd of Hippogriffs,” Harry snorted, raising a hand to get the bartender's attention. “Here, be a big girl and drink up.” She smirked at Ginny, who grimaced with exaggerated exasperation. “You'll thank me tomorrow,” Harry added with a laugh.</p><p class="western">“Let's get back to dancing!” Ginny declared the moment she had drained and put down her glass, grabbing Harry and Hermione's arms to pull them with her back into the mass of grinding bodies on the floor.</p><p class="western">Hermione yelped and hurriedly put her still half-full glass of water next to Ginny's empty one, complaining about the water that had spilled on her chest, which Ginny was happy to laugh off.</p><p class="western">“It's gonna dry!”</p><p class="western">Harry rolled her eyes and tried to dance in the limited space, happy that it was crowded enough that no one paid attention to her poor attempts at dancing.</p><p class="western">As the night wore on, Harry lost track of the number of drinks Ginny and Hermione took turns to place into her hand, and she danced until her feet ached and it felt like her make-up was slipping off her face.</p><p class="western">When Ginny tried to tug her along back to the dance-floor for the nth time, Harry laughingly disentangled herself from the excitable redhead.</p><p class="western">“Bathroom!” she told her, waving her and Hermione on to go dance. Hermione was already swaying and moving to the music, and she looked like she'd stay and dance right there if it hadn't been for Ginny, who pulled her along with a smirk.</p><p class="western">The moment the bathroom door closed behind her, Harry entered a stall and sat down on the toilet, resting her face against her hands.</p><p class="western">The music was muted in here, and getting a chance to rest her feet felt lovely. Ignoring the way the small space seemed to move slightly, despite Harry sitting perfectly still, she took a deep breath and went about her business.</p><p class="western">When she had washed her hands, Harry took a moment to study herself in the mirror with a critical eye. It looked like most her carefully applied make-up and been worn away during the course of the evening, and she didn't trust her own coordination enough to redo it right now.</p><p class="western">With a slight shrug, she dug out the lip-gloss she'd gotten and put on some of that, at least.</p><p class="western">Satisfied, Harry left to search out her friends.</p><p class="western">The line to the bathroom had gotten longer during the time Harry had spent in there, and it felt remarkably satisfactory to stride past it.</p><p class="western">When she had gotten back to the main hall of the club, she eyed the crowd with some trepidation. It would be close to impossible to find the two witches if they were still on the dance floor, so Harry turned to the next most likely place to find them. The bar.</p><p class="western">Taking care to scan the people she walked past for Hermione's bushy hair and Ginny's freckles, she wasn't paying enough attention to herself and where she was walking.</p><p class="western">Harry peered over to the side where she had seen some particularly bushy hair -it had turned out to belong to a man, so it wasn't Hermione- when she walked into someone else, feeling a glass of some sort get caught between them.</p><p class="western">“Oh, Merlin! I'm so sorry!” Harry exclaimed, reflexively snatching up the glass before it could fall to the floor and shatter. It was a minor miracle that it hadn't emptied it's contents all over her dress, she mused distractedly as she finally looked up and took in the person she had walked into. “I'm so sorry,” she repeated herself, “I wasn't looking where I was going.”</p><p class="western">“That's quite alright,” a deep voice responded, carrying the slightest hint of an accent she'd never heard before.</p><p class="western">When she realised she was staring at the very handsome man the voice belonged to, Harry cleared her throat and hurriedly handed back the glass. “I think this is yours, uh, sorry,” she was very glad it was dark enough in here that she wouldn't feel too self-conscious about her scars.</p><p class="western">The man took the glass with long, elegant fingers. When Harry chanced a glance up at him, his lips had stretched into a pleasant smile.</p><p class="western">“No harm done,” he said simply. “Though I do wonder what could have you distracted enough you didn't see me.”</p><p class="western">“I'm looking for my friends,” Harry explained, gaze flicking around occasionally to continue her search, even while most of her attention was on the man in front of her. “They walked off somewhere.”</p><p class="western">“How unfortunate,” the man mused. His dark eyes were considering her from behind a pair of frameless glasses, and he was wearing a suit.</p><p class="western">Harry blinked a little at his formal attire, though the jacket had been left open and his tie had been loosened slightly from it's more proper place.</p><p class="western">“You could search from one of the tables?” he suggested with a look on his face that made it clear he wouldn't mind at all to talk to her a while longer.</p><p class="western">Harry laughed. “Sitting down does sound like a wonderful idea.” Her feet were aching something fierce and she wished she could take off her shoes. She would prefer to go barefoot.</p><p class="western">“Lovely,” the man said, reaching for her hand and tucking it into the crook of his arm as he <em>escorted</em> her towards one of the tables.</p><p class="western">It was slightly calmer here, and the music wasn't quite so overwhelming.</p><p class="western">Harry sat down with a relieved sigh.</p><p class="western">Then she took a moment to look over the booth-like area surrounding the table. There were several suit jackets discarded on the padded benches and a number of empty glasses littering the table.</p><p class="western">“Here with friends?” she asked curiously when the man sat down next to her.</p><p class="western">“Business associates,” he said, before taking a small sip of his drink. “This isn't the sort of place I usually frequent.”</p><p class="western">“Same,” Harry leaned back, stretching her arms up over her head to ease her muscles a little and then leaned one elbow on the table, supporting her head with her hand. “My friends dragged me out for some fun.” She smiled.</p><p class="western">“I'm Kyōya,” he introduced himself, smiling slightly and looking like he wasn't expecting her to be able to pronounce the name correctly.</p><p class="western">“Nice to meet you, Kyōya.” Harry smirked; the average spell was more difficult to say correctly than his name, “I'm Harry.” She reached out her free hand for a handshake.</p><p class="western">“A pleasure to meet you, Harry,” Kyōya returned, fingers tightening around her slender hand a second, before slowly sliding away from it.</p><p class="western">The next hour was spent talking with Kyōya about anything from the day's news to the drunk people embarrassing themselves around them.</p><p class="western">Harry was pleasantly buzzed, but nowhere <em>near</em> enough drunk to do half the things she had witnessed in the last ten minutes alone.</p><p class="western">Unfortunately, Ginny was one of those embarrassing drunk people.</p><p class="western">She and Hermione had come by her and Kyōya's table, both of them drunker and rather more dishevelled than when she'd last seen them. Ginny had placed another drink in front of Harry, eyed Kyōya before giving her an approving grin and had then dragged Hermione with her out of there. The next glimpse she'd caught of her, Ginny had been wrapped around a bloke with her tongue stuck down his throat.</p><p class="western">She had no idea where Hermione had disappeared off to, but wasn't worried; Hermione could more than take care of herself.</p><p class="western">Harry wasn't sure how it happened, but by the time she'd finished the -rather large- drink Ginny had supplied her with, she was sitting in Kyōya's lap, chatting enthusiastically about... something. It had been quite interesting, but then her mouth was on Kyōya's and she couldn't for the life of her recall what they'd been talking about.</p><p class="western">One large hand was resting on her thigh and the other was sliding up her back towards the back of her head. Harry's arms were wrapped around Kyōya's neck, the fingers of one hand tangled in his hair.</p><p class="western">By the time they broke apart, they were both panting and Harry had somehow managed to shift so that she was straddling the man, dress hiked up around her hips.</p><p class="western">“Wanna get out of here?” Kyōya asked a second later in a breathy voice, hands gripping her hips and eyes intently fixed on hers.</p><p class="western">“Yeah,” Harry breathed before leaning in for another kiss.</p><p class="western">Afterwards, Harry wouldn't be able to tell anyone how, exactly, she and Kyōya had made their way back to his hotel. If she didn't know better, she might as well have apparated them straight into the man's bedroom.</p><p class="western">What she <em>did</em> remember, though, was the door to the suite closing, his lips on her mouth and the way his hand had slid down her hip, the other holding her close to his body.</p><p class="western">Harry herself was busy untucking and unbuttoning Kyōya's shirt, before peeling it off his shoulders.</p><p class="western">The cloth rustled as it hit the carpeted floor and she was kicking off her shoes, toes digging into the plush fabric under her feet.</p><p class="western">She was working on Kyōya's belt buckle when he began to steer them towards the bed, hands roaming with increasing urgency, leaving hot trails in their wake.</p><p class="western">The back of her knees hit the edge of the bed and Harry let herself fall backwards. Sprawled on the bed, she watched Kyōya standing between her knees, naked chest heaving.</p><p class="western">For one long heartbeat, neither of them did anything besides watching the other, studying each other's faces.</p><p class="western">Then Kyōya was slowly reaching for her, bending down to let his fingers caress her legs, sliding up her thighs and bringing her dress up with it, exposing more and more of her legs the further he went. The entire time, he didn't break eye-contact.</p><p class="western">Her heart was beating so hard in her chest, she was half-convinced Kyōya would be able to hear it.</p><p class="western">When his fingers slid over her hip-bones, her breath stuttered slightly and the intensity in Kyōya's eyes sharpened.</p><p class="western">Harry arched her back to help him get the dress off and then raised her arms, assisting in pulling the thing over her head. When she lay back down on the bed, Kyōya let his eyes roam her form before continuing with increased urgency.</p><p class="western">When his fingers caught the waist of her stockings, Harry couldn't keep herself motionless any longer.</p><p class="western">Lifting her hips to let Kyōya peel the thin fabric off her legs, Harry caught his hands the moment he was done and pulled him down for another kiss.</p><p class="western">He was still wearing his trousers, and Harry wasn't completely naked yet, but that didn't stop them from migrating more properly onto the bed.</p><p class="western">She sighed into Kyōya's mouth when one of his hands slid up her stomach and began to explore her chest, pushing the lacy bra she was wearing up to expose the soft, pliant flesh beneath.</p><p class="western">Harry arched up into the touch, finally managing to work the belt open. It was a matter of seconds to get the trousers open the rest of the way and pushed down his hips.</p><p class="western">It was at this point that Kyōya broke the kiss and attached his mouth to the side of her throat, sucking gently on the sensitive skin.</p><p class="western">The fingers of one of her hands tangled themselves into the soft hair at the top of his neck while the other grabbed the man's shoulder.</p><p class="western">Harry had to bite her lip when Kyōya's tongue dragged across her skin, followed by the scrape of teeth, making her insides jolt.</p><p class="western">“Come on,” Harry groaned, tugging on Kyōya's hair, her free hand sliding from his shoulder, down his flat, firm chest, past a nipple, tense abdomen to cross the lining of the man's boxers.</p><p class="western">Kyōya broke off what he was doing to bury his face into the side of her throat, shuddering and pulling in a sharp breath when Harry's fingers danced down the fabric stretched over his very obvious erection.</p><p class="western">With a growl, he worked one arm under her back and had lifted her back up off the mattress before Harry could do more than blink her eyes open. Her bra was tossed aside next, and Kyōya's mouth was pressed on hers in a hot, consuming kiss.</p><p class="western">Harry moaned into the kiss when Kyōya's hips lowered until she could feel him pressing against her. There were two layers of cloth between them, but Harry moved up to meet him, rolling her hips to give friction, anything, because she was so damn-</p><p class="western">Harry untangled her fingers from Kyōya's hair and pushed her panties down, hips lifting and incidentally pushing against the man's very hard, very very interesting cock.</p><p class="western">She eagerly swallowed Kyōya's responding moan and kicked her panties off onto the floor, one hand beginning to tug down his boxers when Kyōya grabbed one of her thighs to hike it up onto his hip.</p><p class="western">She was distracted from her plans and Kyōya's fingers were tracing the slick opening between her thighs before there was a slight pressure, warm fingers sliding in and then moving <em>inside of her</em> and Harry heard him breathe a harsh word that sounded like a curse, and-</p><p class="western">His mouth was on her left breast.</p><p class="western">Harry wasn't sure, but she thought the low, keening noise she could distantly hear might be coming from her throat.</p><p class="western">Kyōya rose so that he was standing on his knees, withdrew his two fingers from between her legs and leaned to the side, reaching for something and fumbling with it a moment.</p><p class="western">Harry's breathing was harsh, rushing past her kiss-swollen lips as she tried to ease it somehow. She slung one arm over her eyes, waiting for her partner to finish with the condom. And preferably get rid of his boxers while he was at it.</p><p class="western">When the bed dipped and Kyōya was leaning over her again, she could breathe a little easier, but she was still hot all over and there was a burning <em>ache</em> for something in her stomach for him to- and Kyōya was kissing her again.</p><p class="western">Harry tilted her head, melting into a kiss that was much calmer and more controlled than she had been expecting, than anything they had shared so far.</p><p class="western">Kyōya's hands wandered down her sides until they were gripping her hips.</p><p class="western">His body almost resting flush against her own, Harry could feel his cock resting hotly against her skin, heavy and straining and she needed him <em>in her right now.</em></p><p class="western">And shit, she might have said that out loud, because Kyōya gave a hoarse groan and happily obliged.</p><p class="western">Harry's head tilted back when she felt the tip sliding against the wet, swollen lips and then slowly, carefully pushed inside.</p><p class="western">A small, helpless sound escaped her at the feeling.</p><p class="western">Kyōya's mouth was branding her throat and it was all Harry could do to breathe because he had sheathed himself fully in her, and she wrapped her legs around him, pressing him even closer.</p><p class="western">He was sucking on her clavicle when he pulled out slightly, the heavy cock dragging against <em>everything </em>inside her making her shudder with pleasure and roll into the movement of him pushing back inside.</p><p class="western">Her arms were wrapped around him, one around the neck and one gripping tightly at his back, nails digging into his skin.</p><p class="western">Kyōya's breath was trembling against her skin and it was all Harry could do to hold on and weather the overwhelming pleasure tearing through her nervous system.</p><p class="western">The tempo remained slow and steady for a while, interspersed with deep, intense kisses that left her breathless and writhing against him.</p><p class="western">When the rhythm increased, she knew she wasn't far off the edge, climbing steadily towards climax. Kyōya had buried his face in her neck again and Harry could hear every single noise he made, which was unimaginably enjoyable.</p><p class="western">Orgasm came with a strangled cry and white hot pleasure washing through her, threatening to sweep her away and under the current.</p><p class="western">Kyōya pumped into her through the wracking waves of pleasure, enhancing it and lengthening the duration of it until it felt like she would black out.</p><p class="western">With one last push, Kyōya tensed, joined with her as closely as possible, before collapsing onto her, a heavy, shuddering weight that seemed to ground her in reality rather than trap her against the bed.</p><p class="western">Harry panted, slowly relaxing her worn out body, easing into the soft mattress under her and pressing small, light kisses against Kyōya's shoulder.</p><p class="western">Her eyes were drifting closed, sleep dragging at her consciousness. She was feeling content and Kyōya's heavy weight pressing her deeper into the mattress should be constricting but she just felt safe.</p><p class="western">Kyōya's eventual stirring was distant, but him pulling out of her made a tremble move through her body and a soft noise of mixed pleasure and loss slipped past parted lips.</p><p class="western">The last thing she recalled with clarity before sleep pulled her under was a gentle press of lips on her own.</p><p class="western">.</p><p class="western">.</p><p class="western">Harry woke up slowly.</p><p class="western">It was such a foreign feeling for her, not jerking awake with bad dreams nipping at her heels, she didn't even register anything else for a long while.</p><p class="western">She was warm and content, relaxed in a way she hadn't been in years.</p><p class="western">Taking a deep, languid breath, Harry pushed her face into her pillow a moment before blinking her eyes open.</p><p class="western">She got only a glimpse of the beautiful room around her before she became overly aware of the arms wrapped around her and everything else became less important. Something warm and solid was pressed up against her back, enveloping her, a pair of strong arms wrapped around her waist and she could feel a slow, even breath against her shoulder in time with the chest behind her rising and falling.</p><p class="western">In a heartbeat, she remember where she was and <em>why</em>, and Harry felt her face heat up with embarrassment. She decidedly ignored the spark igniting in her lower abdomen at the same time.</p><p class="western">Lifting a hand to rub at her face, Harry grimaced slightly at the make-up crusting her eyes. She hoped she hadn't smeared any on the pillow...</p><p class="western">Taking a deep breath, she shifted a little to try and figure out how to escape the arms keeping her close to the other's chest.</p><p class="western">When she moved, the arms tightened around her, and the man they belonged to murmured something she couldn't understand against the back of her shoulder, before pressing his mouth against it in an almost-kiss.</p><p class="western">Harry squirmed slightly, unable to stay perfectly still, despite the arms around her, because she couldn't ignore the small detail that they were <em>both naked</em>. Lying flush together.</p><p class="western">She could feel everything.</p><p class="western">Lifting the covers a little to get a look at the arms curled around her, Harry tentatively began to loosen their hold on her.</p><p class="western">Carefully peeling the arms away from her skin, Harry began to get up, only for the arms to snake back around her and pull her back down. Even more firmly against the man's -Kyōya's- chest this time.</p><p class="western">Giving an aggravated huff, Harry managed to shuffle until she was almost facing the man, prepared to tell him, quite firmly, to let her go so she could get up and go home.</p><p class="western">The relaxed, peaceful expression on his face brought her up short, though.</p><p class="western">He looked... different, without the glasses, was her first thought. Softer somehow. Or that might just be because he was currently asleep and Harry was seeing what she wanted.</p><p class="western">Was she still drunk?</p><p class="western">Didn't feel like it, but... Harry determinedly squashed down the impulse to curl into the man and bury her face in his chest, to fall back asleep.</p><p class="western">“I need to go home,” she mumbled to herself.</p><p class="western">Kyōya responded by pulling her closer again, nuzzling her hair and muttering a long string of words in what she could only assume was his mother language.</p><p class="western">Cheeks burning -she wasn't sure if it was with embarrassment or... something else- Harry finally managed to squirm out of the man's arms and slip off the mattress down onto the floor.</p><p class="western">A slight frown pulled on Kyōya's eyebrows, and he shifted enough that Harry was afraid she'd woken him up. In the end, he finally turned slightly and buried his face in his pillow, muttering something in a displeased manner.</p><p class="western">Harry let out a slow, silent sigh, and climbed to her feet.</p><p class="western">Stark naked.</p><p class="western">With one last glance at the bed, Harry set out to find all her scattered pieces of clothing.</p><p class="western">She grimaced at the thought of getting dressed without a shower, but pulled on her dress regardless. She didn't fancy leaving the room in her birthday suit. Never mind the <em>Hotel</em>.</p><p class="western">Pausing a moment, Harry scowled down at the stockings dangling from one of her hands, but gave in with a sigh and started to pull them on. She hated it when people stared at her scars, and the ones on her feet and legs were no different.</p><p class="western">Who knew flying a broom through a room filled with raging Fiendfyre could be so dangerous?</p><p class="western">Harry mentally rolled her eyes at her own thoughts as she slipped her feet into her high-heeled shoes. So pretty, but she wouldn't be wearing them dancing ever again. Her feet felt like they were about to fall off!</p><p class="western">Glancing over the room one more time, Harry finally spotted her purse.</p><p class="western">It was lying precariously on the edge of a small, delicate-looking table by the bedroom door.</p><p class="western">Had she put it down on the first available surface without even looking? Yes, Harry admitted to herself with a sigh.</p><p class="western">With one last look at the bed and the -very handsome, <em>tempting</em>- man occupying it, Harry turned and silently left the bedroom.</p><p class="western">If the situation had been any different, Harry would have stopped dead, blinking blearily at the extravagant suite she found herself in. As it was, she just frowned a little, and strode through it with determined steps, purse clutched tightly in one hand.</p><p class="western">Before she left the suite entirely, Harry paused, took a deep breath, straightened her back and stared at the door like there were Death Eaters waiting on the other side.</p><p class="western">With one last deep breath, Harry smoothed down her dress, cursed the state of her hair and then stepped out into the silent corridor on the other side.</p><p class="western">By the time she had made it outside, Harry had received too many knowing glances than she cared to think about and took a moment to breathe in the still morning air.</p><p class="western">The sky was still dark and it was <em>very</em> early.</p><p class="western">Harry turned right and went on the hunt for the closest empty alley she could apparate from.</p><p class="western">Thank Merlin you didn't have to know where you were to reach the destination you wanted.
