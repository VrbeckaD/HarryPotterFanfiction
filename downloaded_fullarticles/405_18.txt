    <u>Annabeth POV:</u>

</p><p>Percy was sprawled on the bed, legs laying out both ways, resembling a starfish. He was fiddling with a rubix cube. Frowning at it, and flicking it quickly, before sighing, setting it down for a second. Then picking it up once more, and continuing to fiddle with it. His head bopping along to music he was listening to (with his airpods, no less. Something Annabeth decided she was going to tease him senselessly about).</p><p> </p><p>(Until he had bought her a pair, and she decided they were oh too fun to use to tease her boyfriend about).</p><p> </p><p>“Are you watching me?” Percy asked, his eyes never leaving the cube. One hand turning his airpods off.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” Annabeth hummed, eyes flicking away from Percy to rest back on her laptop. Percy let out a snort, mocking her. “You’re too cute to not watch.”</p><p> </p><p>Percy let out another laugh, setting the cube down and pulling himself up to face Annabeth.</p><p> </p><p>“Want a smoke?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re going to kill yourself with those.” Annabeth replied, Percy laughed once more.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re assuming that these will kill me before Chiron.” Percy replied dryly. He flipped out his pack, a hand fiddling with one. Flipping it over, and over in his hands. “I might go down to the beach.”</p><p> </p><p>“To smoke?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, to have sex with the ocean.” It was now Annabeth’s turn to laugh, Percy getting off the bed and planting a kiss on her head. “I’ll see you in twenty,”</p><p> </p><p>Just as he reached the door, a high-pitched whistled sounded and Percy was rooted in place. Annabeth thinned her eyes, waiting for Percy to continue moving.</p><p> </p><p>But he didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>“You okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” He whispered, shaking his head, one (very shaky) hand running through his hair.</p><p> </p><p>“A reminder?”</p><p> </p><p>“Always,” He responded, moving away from the door and slumping down on the ground. Head against the wall, eyes closed. “My chest is tight.”</p><p> </p><p>Annabeth pulled herself off the bed, sitting criss-crossed in front of Percy, careful not to touch him. “I’m going to touch your legs, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>He nodded, and she gently reached out, placing her hands on his knees, rubbing slowly.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you open your eyes?” Percy shook his head, pursing his lips tightly. Annabeth gently reached across, taking one of his hands and placing it on her chest. “Breathe with me.”</p><p> </p><p>Percy obliged, mirroring her slow, deep breaths. His head still pressing against the wall, his other hand turning his cigarette around and around. His eyes are screwed tightly shut. Just as it seems like he’s calming, a scream erupts from outside, and Percy snaps the cigarette in two, his hands flying to his ears.</p><p> </p><p>“Annabeth?” He spits, his voice strained, shaking and terrified.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m here,” Annabeth responds, her hands already on his shoulders. His eyes burst open but aren’t focusing on her. Flicking around the room quickly, trying to find where her voice is coming from. Almost as though she was hidden by mist. “I’m here,” She said again, thumbs rubbing circles on his shoulders. He moves to pull away, but Annabeth pushed him against the wall.</p><p> </p><p>“Perce, I’m in front of you. I’m rubbing circles on your shoulders. Put your hands on the ground, you can feel the boards. There’s no dirt. I’m going to rub your upper arms, can you feel that?” He nodded, “good. That’s really good. Breathe in, feel the air filling your lungs. Breathing out, feel the air leaving your lungs. This air is clean.”</p><p> </p><p>He nods again, his eyes resting just behind where Annabeth was sitting, “I can feel you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good,”</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t see you.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s okay. Can I pull you in for a hug? Okay, I’m going to move to sit behind you. There we go, and just lean into me. Can you wrap your arms around my neck? Good, that’s good my love.” Annabeth whispered, Percy’s arms clinging tightly around her neck, his head resting on her shoulder. She lifted one hand, threading it through his hair. Her other arm supporting his body.</p><p> </p><p>Slowly, his breathing evened. Turning from rough, panicked breathing, into slower, long breaths. Her shoulder growing increasingly wet as he calmed down.</p><p> </p><p>“M’sorry,” he mumbles into her shoulder, Annabeth rubbed her hands along his shoulders, Percy sitting up, hands wiping his under eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be,” she replies, Percy wiping his eyes again. “Perce, I love you. You don’t need to apologise for having a flashback. Look at me, you’re okay. I’m okay. We’re both safe. We’re together. We’re safe. I promise, we’re safe. We’re together until the very end.”</p><p> </p><p>“Until the end,” he echoed, his head resting once again on Annabeth’s shoulder, his face pressing into her neck. Annabeth closed her eyes, feeling Percy’s breathing grow even calmer, grow more even with every passing second. Turning from conscious, into unconscious. His arms growing slack around her neck.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t help but smile, enjoying every second of Percy being curled in her arms. Enjoying every second of how calm her – usually extremely tense – boyfriend. A soft snore turning Annabeth’s smile into one of a laugh.</p><p> </p><p>A calm, grateful laugh. But a laugh at Percy’s sake none the less.</p><p> </p><p>That was, until, the door of the cabin flung open. Percy was awake within seconds, Riptide in his hands. Annabeth froze, hand on her dagger. Everything in slow motion.</p><p> </p><p>Percy was pushing Jason against the wall, sword against his neck. Barely wavering. Piper was on the ground. Annabeth was up, and over Piper before she could register what she was doing.</p><p> </p><p>Her dagger pointing at her friends neck, Piper’s hands up.</p><p> </p><p>Her dagger tossed aside, pulling Piper up. Hands on Percy, pulling him back.</p><p> </p><p>“Are. You. Fucking. Insane?” He hissed, as Annabeth carefully pried his sword off him, capping it, and fitting it back in his pocket.</p><p> </p><p>“We – I didn’t mean to – I didn’t think –”</p><p> </p><p>Percy laughed dryly, “you didn’t think, Grace? I’m honestly shocked. What the hell were you thinking?”</p><p> </p><p>“Perce,” Annabeth whispered, but he shook her off.</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you here? Oh, don’t look at me like that, Piper. You’re clearly here for a fucking reason, or your dumb blond of a boyfriend wouldn’t have flung open the door with that much vigour. Now spit it out, so I can decide whether or not to kick you two out of my cabin.”</p><p> </p><p>“Chiron needs to speak to you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“He didn’t say. He asked for a meeting.”</p><p> </p><p>“It isn’t heads meeting until Friday.” Percy hissed.</p><p> </p><p>“He didn’t say.”</p><p> </p><p>Percy let out a grumble, flipping his pack out of his pants and stalking out the backdoor of the Poseidon cabin.</p><p> </p><p>“He’ll be there,” Annabeth said, as Jason rolled his eyes. “Just let him cool off.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s gone for a fucking smoke Annabeth.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not blind, Jason.” Annabeth hissed, narrowing her eyes at the boy in front of her. “Let him cool off, and he’ll be there for the meeting. The Big House, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>Piper nodded, and Annabeth nodded a little slower in response. Gesturing for the two to leave, closing the cabin door behind them. Before turning, and following her boyfriend out the back door, following his footsteps and the smell of smoke until she found him. Slumping down, stealing his cigarette and taking a drag.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to really go.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re going.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know. I just don’t <em>want</em> to go.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re ridiculous.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s my middle name, Ms Chase.” He mumbled, taking his cigarette back from Annabeth and having a long drag, laying down as he did. “Percy Ridiculous Jackson.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really rolls of the tongue.”</p><p> </p><p>Percy let out a snort, taking a slow breath in through his cigarette. Handing the cigarette to Annabeth.</p><p> </p><p>“Jason commented on your new habit.” She said, breathing out and watching her smoke billow out in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>“Jason commented on your new habit too then,” Percy counted, taking the cigarette back. “This is mine now, you can use your own.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mine’s back in your cabin.” She complained, Percy shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t care.”</p><p> </p><p>“Asshole.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>

    <u>Piper POV:</u>
  </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so beautiful,” Jason whispered in Piper’s ear. Giving a quick kiss.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re awful at distracting me,” Piper mumbles in response, Jason grumbling pulling his face away. Leaving his arm hanging over her shoulders. “I feel bad.”</p><p> </p><p>“How so?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just opening their door?” She faded off, and Jason pulled her in, kissing her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“We knocked.” He supplied. “Twice. Twenty, and ten minutes ago.”</p><p> </p><p>Piper nodded, bitting her lip harshly. Unable to stop her mind from wandering to seeing her friends. Unable to stop seeing them grinning and smiling together. Seeing Percy teasing her, and poking Annabeth. Laughing at pranks, and calmly teaching students how to fight and speak Greek. Of the times when their students pressure them into fighting each other, and seeing their grins, and looks of hard determination.</p><p> </p><p>But then, there were also the bad days. The days that Percy didn’t speak to anyone – including Annabeth. The days he walked away if anyone tried to speak to him, or the days where he would sit in the strawberry fields and smoke. The days were Annabeth would spend hours upon hours fighting, practising and throwing daggers. Ignoring the world around her. The days that Percy snapped, and the seas raged (until Annabeth forced him into the ocean). The days in which Percy would jump at a sound and freeze the person who scared him. Or the days in which Annabeth snapped, and would fight with Percy for hours.</p><p> </p><p>Jason pulled Piper to a stop, pulling her out of her thoughts. His eyes swimming and connecting with hers.</p><p> </p><p>“They’ll be okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“How do we know?” Piper asked, “Jace, we know that this meeting isn’t going to end well. How can we go in there and drop this on them?”</p><p> </p><p>He shrugged, running his hand through his hair; “I don’t know. We have to. I don’t want to.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to either.”</p><p> </p><p>“We can’t go back and tell Chiron we couldn’t. I doubt they’re going to respond to well to him coming in and demanding a meeting.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Piper mumbled, Jason pulling her in for a tight hug. “Okay, let’s go.”</p><p> </p><p>Jason lead the way in, opening the door, Piper following.</p><p> </p><p>Within the space of a blink, Piper was on the ground, Annabeth with her dagger pointed towards her. Her friend blinked a few times, throwing her dagger on the ground, pulling Piper up (without a word). Piper’s eyes widened seeing Percy, his face dangerously close to Jason’s, his sword unwavering.</p><p> </p><p>Annabeth pulled Percy away, not before he could spit out a few curses at Piper’s boyfriend. Piper looked down, tuning out of the conversation, until a slamming door jumped her out.</p><p> </p><p>“–the big house, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>The meeting?</p><p> </p><p>Piper nodded, Annabeth copying her, gesturing for them to leave. Of which, Piper did gladly, almost pulling Jason out the door. Glad (for once) to leave her friends alone in the cabin.</p>
