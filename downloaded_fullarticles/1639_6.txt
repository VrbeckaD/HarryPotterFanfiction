</p><p> </p><p>“This is insane, brother-mine!”</p><p> </p><p>“But ingenious, don’t you think, oh handsome sibling?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not sure it’ll work.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not sure either, but it’ll be a bit of a wheeze, don’t you think?”</p><p> </p><p>“‘A bit of a wheeze’?!”</p><p> </p><p>“A laugh. A jape. A moment of levity in an otherwise dreary year…”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I’m perfectly aware of what ‘wheeze’ means! We came up with the name together, remember.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s because we’re so clever!”</p><p> </p><p>“We are, aren’t we? I sometimes forget just how terribly smart we are, my good looking partner in crime!”</p><p> </p><p>“And that makes me think that it will work, too!”</p><p> </p><p>“How so?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because we’re so clever, and <em> she’s </em> not bad in the brains department either, so it’s bound to work!”</p><p> </p><p>“She <em> is </em>clever, isn’t she!”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s what all her Professors said, at least.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m inclined to agree with them too.”</p><p> </p><p>“Probably smarter than us.”</p><p> </p><p>“A bit!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh certainly individually; combined we’re probably a little smarter!”</p><p> </p><p>“Just a little, mind!”</p><p> </p><p>“But I’m sure she can follow a script...”</p><p> </p><p>“Play her part well.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think she’ll be perfect for the role, don’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Definitely! And it doesn’t hurt that she’s not bad looking either.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, certainly not. She’ll compliment your own stunning looks, dear brother!”</p><p> </p><p>“Why thank you, though you’re not so bad looking yourself!”</p><p> </p><p>The pair shook hands and clapped each other on the back, while the woman on the doorstep in front of them tapped her foot impatiently, her hair plastered to her head by the relentless rain. Water had trickled down the back of her coat and her umbrella had turned itself inside out halfway up Diagon Alley. She was chewing the inside of her cheek, trying to keep herself from hexing, or just punching, one or both of the tall men in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>“If you two, oh so clever and handsome, <em> idiotic </em> masters of self congratulation are <em> quite </em> finished,” she spat, her patience finally snapping, “I would appreciate you getting out of the damn doorway so I can get out of the rain!”</p><p> </p><p>The twins hurriedly stood aside with a flourish, inviting her over the threshold at last and into the shop. They shut and locked the door behind her as she stalked forward, sweeping her coat off and splashing the pair of them with rainwater. She brushed the soggy mop of hair out of her eyes and fixed the pair of grinning morons with her deadliest stare.</p><p> </p><p>“Explain. Quickly! <em> Without </em> the banter!” she finished, as they both opened their mouths.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>“You're off your trolley, the pair of you!”</p><p> </p><p>Unable to sit still, Hermione Granger stalked around the small office space, five paces one way, five back. Her hair flew out, almost snapping in the air with each spin.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that a no?”</p><p> </p><p>“It didn't sound like a yes, George.”</p><p> </p><p>“But not outright rejection either.”</p><p> </p><p>“This is true, I would hazard a guess…”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione spun around, her finger jabbing Fred in the chest. “You will hazard my foot up your arse if you say another word, Fred Weasley!”</p><p> </p><p>The tall man held up his hands in surrender, before surreptitiously rubbing his chest when she resumed pacing.</p><p> </p><p>“Probably best to let her work through it, Fred…” George began but Hermione turned on him, growling.</p><p> </p><p>“I have <em> two </em> feet, George! Watch it!”</p><p> </p><p>The tall man mimed zipping his mouth closed, his face apologetic, but his eyes danced with mirth. The woman resumed her pacing, angrier now, but the twins could see her working it all through in her mind. They were, all joking and banter aside, a little in awe of the smaller witch's ability to work logically. Though they prided themselves on their talent for jokes and innovation, they knew of no-one who could work out solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems like Hermione could. Their respect for her was unparalleled, so it was no surprise when Fred had suggested her as their best chance of pulling this off.</p><p> </p><p>They watched quietly, not wanting to disturb her, nervous that she might turn them down afterall. If they had to go back to the drawing board…</p><p> </p><p>“This is insane!” she declared again, echoing George's comment at the door. They resolutely remained quiet, Hermione's pacing never faltering.</p><p> </p><p>Finally she stopped, hands on the back of the chair, and the men held their breath, not daring to hope.</p><p> </p><p>“And this is <em> just </em> for two days?” she said at last.</p><p> </p><p>“Tops!”</p><p> </p><p>“No more!”</p><p> </p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p> </p><p>“Absolute limit!”</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes stopped them, their mouths closing with a snap of teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“And you'll lose the deal if this man doesn't believe it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“It could ruin us!”</p><p> </p><p>“Might lose the shop...”</p><p> </p><p>“Certainly set us back massively…”</p><p> </p><p>“Enough!” she cried, scowling at them. Her knuckles were white on the chair back, and the twins found themselves holding hands under the desk, their own knuckles pale with worry. The witch sighed, deflating slightly and lowering her head to the chair back with a gentle thud. “I can’t believe I’m going to say this…”</p><p> </p><p>The twins didn’t give her a chance to finish, surging to their feet with a whoop of excitement, hugging each other and laughing with delight. They parted and ran around the desk to embrace Hermione, almost crushing her between them in their enthusiasm. She felt a momentary twinge of something indefinable as they hugged her. The wild thought, ‘twin-sandwich’, fluttered through her mind, and she couldn’t stop the slight whimper that burst from her throat; George behind her, his chest pressed against her shoulders; Fred in front, his firm pecs mashed against her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>After a moment of shock she wriggled out of their embrace, pushing them away. Two spots of colour burned brightly on her cheeks as she straightened her rumpled blouse. She cleared her throat, avoiding their eyes as they smiled at her.</p><p> </p><p>“So…?”</p><p> </p><p>“Was that a…?</p><p> </p><p>Hermione tried to glare at them, but their enthusiasm was so great that she couldn’t hold the expression. A small smile quirked at the corners of her lips. “You’re both mental, you know this, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Absolutely!” they declared.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine. It's a yes.” She shook her head and sighed as the two high fived each other. <em> What am I getting myself into? </em></p><p> </p><p>“You won't regret this, Hermione! I promise you!”</p><p> </p><p>“I had better not, Fred, or you will be the first to know about it! This was your idea, after all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don't worry, love, this will all go brilliantly!” George chimed in, beaming.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, well,” Hermione said, her cheeks heating slightly at the familiar term. “We had best start planning things then. When is he arriving?”</p><p> </p><p>“Tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>“WHAT!?” Hermione yelled. “What do you mean, ‘tomorrow’?”</p><p> </p><p>“Day after today?”</p><p> </p><p>“Starts just after midnight.”</p><p> </p><p>She growled, stalking towards them forcing them to back away from her. “I know what tomorrow <em> means </em> , you bloody fools! <em> Why </em> is it tomorrow? Why are you only just inviting me into this damn harebrained scheme of yours at the last bloody minute?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” said Fred, shuffling his feet with embarrassment.</p><p> </p><p>“We didn't know if you'd be up for it, at first! Were kinda scared to ask, if I'm honest.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then he had a cancellation and brought the date forward. Sent a man to confirm, so we couldn't delay!”</p><p> </p><p>“He wanted to take an answer back straight away… and I was about to tell him we weren't ready, because he was looking forward to meeting me and my family… you know, wife and such like…”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I figured we might lose the deal if we seemed flakey, so I said that George and his wife would be delighted to receive him tomorrow!”</p><p> </p><p>“Bit of a shock for me too, to tell you the truth.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, George.”</p><p> </p><p>“No harm done, old chap!”</p><p> </p><p>“So we had to come up with a wife for George pretty sharpish, and well… here you are!”</p><p> </p><p>“Tadaaa!” said George, nervously, waving his hands.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione just stared at them for a moment, trying to comprehend the level of stupidity in these two. No, she allowed, it wasn't stupidity at all. They were an incredibly talented, funny, and generally likeable pair… they were just too enthusiastic for their own good. And maybe a little bit stupid.</p><p> </p><p>“Don't worry, Hermione,” said George, putting an arm around her shoulder and hugging her close. “We can wing it!”</p><p> </p><p>“I can't just ‘<em> wing it’ </em> , my dear <em> husband </em>,” she said snippily, “I hate winging things!” She pushed away from him and resumed pacing. “I need to know all about our marriage, how we met, the proposal, holidays, plans for the future, how many children we want…”</p><p> </p><p>“Steady on, sweetheart, we only just got married tonight!”</p><p><br/> “This is not funny, George, and if you are not going to take it at least a little bit seriously, I am out of here, and <em> Fred </em> can pretend to be your damn wife!”</p>
