    <p>Severus had been right when he told Potter that he would need a security detail. When Minerva announced that the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor and Head of Gryffindor house was the one and only Harry Potter, an absolute hush fell over the student body. And then Harry stood up, and the whole hall seemed to collectively realize that that man, standing up, with the black hair and the broad shoulders and the dazzling smile - <em> that was Harry Potter? </em> And then there was an intake of breath, and an explosion of cheering that shook the very walls. </p><p>Severus looked over at him, standing there, waving rather awkwardly, and pursed his lips. That idiot wasn’t going to be able to teach anyone anything. Not a damn thing. They wouldn’t even be able to hear what he was <em> saying</em>. Severus thought back to the pictures of him that had been in all the papers four years ago. Thin, and ragged, and streaked with soot, his robes torn and his hair overlong. Blood on his glasses, but only a little. Well, look at him now. </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“I gotta hand it to you, Severus, you were right.”</p><p>“I often am.”</p><p>They were in the teacher’s lounge, in front of a dancing fire. </p><p>“That certainly wasn’t the reaction I was expecting,” Harry said, and ruffled his own hair. Severus seemed to remember his father doing that a lot. But when James had done it, it had been annoying. This, though … was not that annoying. </p><p>“And what were you expecting? Swooning?” he shot back. Harry laughed out loud. </p><p>“<em>No, </em> come on. I was expecting - I don’t know. Whispering and maybe … maybe some polite clapping.” Severus rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Don’t be daft, Potter,” he said. “You’re the hero of the Second Wizard War. And you’re - what?” Harry was looking at him. And his expression was… shocking. Harry leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, and Severus leaned back, skewered.</p><p>“And what exactly will it take to get you to stop calling me that?” he asked, his voice low.</p><p>“Hero?” Severus breathed.</p><p>“Potter.”</p><p>“You are Professor Potter now, aren’t you?” Harry blinked at him and then sat back, and looked into the fire. Severus positively <em> wilted</em>. </p><p>“I suppose I am,” Harry said, and crossed one ankle over his knee. Then he looked back at Snape. “Withholding my title, then?”</p><p>“My apologies, <em> Professor Potter</em>.” Harry grinned at him.</p><p>“I kind of like that, actually,” he said. Severus kind of liked it, too. He glared. Harry chuckled. “That look really used to scare the living daylights out of me, you know.”</p><p>“Oh? Used to?” Severus asked. “And what does it do to you now?”</p><p>Harry tapped one finger against his lips like he was thinking hard. “Now? Hm. I suppose now it makes me want to slap it off your face.” Severus flushed and looked over his shoulder. The staff room was quite empty. “Yeah.” Harry laughed again when he turned back. “Like that. Shock it right off.” </p><p>Severus did not respond to this at once, but took a moment to steady himself. Funny, how off-center Harry made him feel. With his laugh, and his jawline, and his unbearable confidence. And the way he’d touched Severus’ scars, without fear. And then came <em> back. </em></p><p>“What exactly are we doing?” he asked, folding his hands.</p><p>“You told me I could decide if what we did was a one night stand, and I decided it wasn’t,” Harry said simply. </p><p>“So, what, you’re going to court me?”</p><p>“If that’s what you want.”</p><p>“And what makes you think I’ll be receptive?” Severus tried not to look at him, but he couldn’t resist. Harry was leaning back in the armchair like it was a throne, his legs apart and his eyes hooded.</p><p>“You made some noises that gave me that impression,” he said. And then he brushed his thumb slowly across his lower lip. “Unless you were expecting to get off more than twice. In which case, my apologies, for failing to meet your needs.” </p><p>Severus was blushing. He could feel it. He tried to fight it back. Harry sat forward again, and reached out to hook a finger between two of the buttons on Snape’s collar. </p><p>“You were almost begging,” he said. </p><p>“I wasn’t,” Severus breathed, allowing himself to be tugged closer. </p><p>“No?” Harry asked. “I’ll have to try harder then.”</p><p> </p><p>They were in the bloody <em> staff room.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Severus jerked away, but Harry seized the front of his robes and dragged him back in until they were nose to nose. </p><p> </p><p>“What in God’s name are you doing?” he gasped.</p><p>“Courting you,” Harry murmured back. </p><p> </p><p>The lounge door opened and Harry released him as Professors Flitwick and Sprout walked in, talking animatedly. They spotted the two of them by the fire, and Harry stood up to shake hands. His smile was wide. Severus pressed himself back into his seat, mortified, suddenly recalling in visceral detail the way Harry had knocked him to the wall outside of the Hog’s Head. Without preamble. Without asking. Without even touching his arm, or his back, to see if his attentions were wanted. He’d just gone for it. Like Harry fucking Potter always had. Reckless, bold, pursuing his desires with single-minded focus. ‘<em>I’m not usually this forward,’ </em> indeed. </p><p> </p><p>At dinner the next night, Harry sat next to him. Positively ousted Professor Vector, in fact, and took her seat.</p><p>“Rude,” Severus muttered at him, but Harry just smiled.</p><p>“No manners at all, I,” he answered.</p><p>Absolutely everyone wanted to speak to him, and in a way, Severus was glad. He didn’t like the idea of Harry sitting next to him at the high table, <em> whispering things to him</em>, while the entire student body looked on. Because the student body was looking at Harry, and if Harry was looking at him, they would notice. And <em> then </em> what would everyone think? Scandal.</p><p>He ate quickly, wanting to flee, but when he stood up to go, Harry made his excuses and followed him out. And the Defense rooms were on the ground floor, on the way to the dungeons, so Harry walked with him, seeming quite comfortable, and chattering at him like they were old friends. Severus was just beginning to wonder if Harry was intending to follow him all the way to his rooms, when he was stopped by a light touch on his arm. </p><p>“Care for a drink?” Harry asked. Severus looked around and realized they were just at the splitting of the halls - to the left, the dungeons. To the right, the DADA Professor’s quarters. And that, of course, was Professor Potter.</p><p>Severus had never before in his life been pursued. But that’s what Harry was doing. Pursuing him. </p><p>“It’s late,” he said. </p><p>“No, it isn’t,” Harry answered. “But if you don’t care for one, you can say that.”</p><p>Severus hesitated. “Maybe one.” </p><p>They turned to the right, and outside his rooms, Harry opened the door for him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s personality had already imprinted itself on his staff accomodations. They were light, and airy, and there was an alarmingly large space in the center of the living room without a single piece of furniture. Severus stepped into it. Had these rooms always been so spacious? Harry closed and locked the door and then looked at him. Severus spread his hands as if to say, <em> ‘what in the bleeding hell is this?’ </em></p><p>“I like to stay fit,” Harry said. “Takes space.” He shrugged out of his robes and tossed them over a chair near his dining table, and then moved over to a cabinet in the corner and began rummaging around. “What would you like?” he called out. “Wine? Spirits?” He looked up. “Soda water?”</p><p>“Wine would be fine,” Severus said. Harry pulled out a bottle of red and a wine key. Under his robes he was wearing a v-necked t-shirt and a pair of jeans, and the muscles of his forearms shifted nicely as he uncorked the bottle. “You are aware that you’re a wizard, aren’t you?” Severus asked when he was caught looking. The corner of Harry’s mouth quirked up.</p><p>“I prefer to use my hands,” he said. </p><p>“I’ve gathered that,” Severus muttered.</p><p>“Hmm?” Harry poured two generous glasses and turned back to him. “Cheers.” Severus took the glass he was offered and then held it still to be clinked. “Shall we sit?” Harry gestured to two overstuffed armchairs before a large stone fireplace at the far end of the room, and didn’t wait for an answer. Severus followed in his wake. </p><p>When he settled down in his chair, Harry eyed him over the rim of his goblet.</p><p>“Can I help you?” Severus asked, and took a sip. </p><p>“You look nervous. You needn’t be.” </p><p>Severus pursed his lips and looked into his glass. “You seem to bring that out in me,” he said. “And I’m not very easily rattled.”</p><p>“Ha. Have I rattled you?”</p><p>“Down to my very bones, Po - Harry.” He glanced up just in time to see Harry smile at him in a very uncharitable way. “I mean, <em> Potter. </em>” And then he laughed out loud.</p><p>“I see,” he said. “Trying to annoy me?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“You are. Call me Potter again, see if I care. It won’t change anything. It’s my name for God’s sake. And you’re in my rooms drinking my wine so - I feel like we’re past last name nonsense.”</p><p>“It’s not bad. Your wine,” Severus said.</p><p>“Don’t deflect.” Harry put his glass on the side table and stretched, and Severus watched him do it, remembering with sudden and violent intensity just what he looked like under his clothes. “Don’t you want to take off your coat?”</p><p>“I do not,” Severus answered, looking at the dark fireplace. And then flames burst into life there.</p><p>“How about now?” He was so charming. How did he get so damn charming? Severus looked into the fire for a long moment, and then back at his host, and did not speak. “Don’t be shy, Severus. I’ve seen all of you already. And here I am, back for more. Coat?”</p><p>“Fine,” he said, and set down his glass. But then, as he raised his hands to the long row of buttons on his chest, he stopped, feeling suddenly bold. He met Harry’s eyes, angled his body towards him, and held out his arms. Harry’s expression shifted. It was subtle, but he could see it. A brief narrowing of the eyes. A little heat. A little bit of the look he’d worn outside the Hog’s Head, under the streetlights. Severus swallowed.</p><p>Harry raised his wand and pointed it at him, and the buttons separated from their loops all at once. </p><p>“Thank you,” Severus said, and stood up to slide it off. He folded the heavy cotton, draped it over the arm of his chair, and sat back down. Underneath, his shirt was buttoned all the way up to the top, but even so, the tips of his scars were visible as they trailed up towards his jaw. He had a nervous habit of tugging up his collar, and tried hard not to do it as he felt Harry’s eyes on him. The tendrils of his scars tingled slightly with the memory of his touch. Wanting it, and not wanting it. </p><p>“I have a question,” Harry said gravely. Severus tugged up his collar and looked away. </p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Why do you try to hide them?” </p><p>Severus looked back up. “Why? What do you mean by that?”</p><p>“I mean just what I’ve said. Why. Do you try. To hide. Your scars.” His voice was unwavering. Strong, and fearless. Just like he was. Severus picked his glass back up and took a drink, wondering what he could say that this man would understand. </p><p>“They’d frighten the children,” was what came out of him. Harry let out disbelieving snort.</p><p>“As if you don’t frighten them already. You <em> terrified </em> me, and all of my classmates. And you meant to.”</p><p>“They’re grotesque.” That was more true. They were hideous. Disfiguring. Like everyone could see into his soul. Like all of his sins had been burned onto his skin. Punishment from an angry God.</p><p>“I like them.”</p><p>He <em> what? </em> </p><p>Severus stood up abruptly and turned towards the fire. “Don’t <em> lie.” </em> </p><p>Harry stood up, too. “It’s not a lie. Those scars are a badge of honor. You should have no shame.” What an outrageous thing to say. “Let everyone else be ashamed. Not you.” <em> Intolerable. </em> Severus whirled around to face him.</p><p>“No shame?” he demanded, holding out his hand as Harry tried to pursue him. “You have no <em> idea.</em>” Harry grabbed his wrist, and not gently. </p><p>“I know everything,” he said. “I was at your trial. And I say <em> no shame. </em>” Severus wrenched his arm free.</p><p>“So, what, I can be like you? So blindingly arrogant that you waltz into this school and directly into my life like you own me? Telling me to show my scars with <em> pride.</em>” He scoffed, and turned away, but Harry spun him back around and slammed him up against the wall so hard that it knocked the air out of him. </p><p>“Am I arrogant?” he demanded. “Or am I right?” </p><p>Severus sucked in a shallow breath, his lungs seizing up. And it wasn’t the impact. It was the look in his <em> eyes</em>. It made him almost dizzy, and it was almost like fear. But also - not like fear. </p><p>“You’re <em> arrogant</em>,” he spat, and shoved him off. “How you can be so <em> cocky </em> after what we went through I cannot begin to imagine.” Harry stepped right back into his space with no hesitation, one hand flat on his chest and the other on the wall beside his head. And maybe - maybe that <em> was </em> fear he was feeling. Sick, vertiginous, like standing on the edge of a chasm.</p><p>“Well,” Harry began, and his voice was suddenly calm, cutting through the noise in Severus’ brain. “I won.”</p><p> </p><p>He’d won. He’d faced down an army of Deatheaters. He’d cut down the most feared Wizard in history. He’d <em>died. </em>And he’d come out the other side, a man like this.</p><p> </p><p>It was like two neurons touching for the first time, and all at once Severus went <em> weak </em> with desire for him. And Harry could see it. Could see right through him. </p><p>“I put Tom Riddle in the ground,” he continued, the rumble of his voice raising every single hair on Severus’ body. “And I set you free.”</p><p>“So, what?” Severus breathed, “I belong to you now?” </p><p>Harry did not answer other than to kiss him. It was rough, demanding, and that liquid feeling in Severus’ legs redoubled until he was sure that it was Harry’s mouth keeping him upright, and nothing else. And then Harry’s fingers slid up against his scalp and tightened, pulling the hair at the base of his skull taught, and oh, <em>that - </em>that was more than weakness. It was like his spine had been yanked out, and Severus didn’t even try to hold back the noise that came out of him. It was high, and thin, and Harry jerked him away from the wall and began walking him backwards. Towards what - Severus had no idea. And he didn’t care. Harry could walk him right off a cliff and he would go. Right into a pit. </p><p>In the doorway to his bedroom Harry stopped and held him to the frame.</p><p>“If you want me to be careless with you, you don’t have to piss me off to get it,” he said, and grabbed Severus’ jaw. “You can just ask.”</p><p>
  <em> Get it together. </em>
</p><p>Severus sneered. </p><p>“Is that what I want?” he hissed.</p><p>“Yeah. I think it is,” Harry answered, pushing him further into the room. “You’re pretty transparent.” Severus let out a yelp of terror as Harry threw him backwards, and then flushed as he bounced back onto a bed. Harry’s bed. And Harry was climbing over him, on top of him, right into his lap.</p><p>“How careful do I need to be with your scars?” he asked. </p><p>“What?” Severus breathed, and Harry twisted his fingers into the fabric of his shirt.</p><p>“Your scars,” he said again, and jerked the two sides apart. Severus could hear the buttons hit the walls. <em> Holy - What? What did he ask? </em>“How careful do you need me to be?”</p><p>“Oh - Merlin, I - not that careful.” </p><p>“Good,” Harry purred, and closed his hand over his throat. “Wouldn’t want to hurt you, now, would I?” And maybe if their roles had been reversed, Severus would have called the sound he made as he was dragged up towards the pillows a squeak. Maybe he would have called it that, if it hadn’t come out of his own mouth. </p><p>Harry straddled him, and then sat back to yank his shirt over his head, and Severus reached up to touch him - his stomach and ribs and chest - whatever he could reach. Solid, hard muscle, and that was all. He was just<em> hard</em>, all over, like he was forged from steel. Harry grabbed his hands and pinned them to the bed.</p><p>“Do you want me to hold you down?” he asked, leaning over him. “I think you might like it.” Severus liked it already. He shrank back against the bedclothes, abruptly disarmed.</p><p>“Do you want to?” </p><p>Harry’s mouth twisted up. “Do <em> I </em>want to? You’re so diffident. Who would have guessed?” Severus fired up at once.</p><p>“I’m not <em> diffident - </em> ” he began hotly, but Harry cut him off, his kiss fierce, open-mouthed, and absolutely filthy, and Severus’ mind went blank like he’d been imperiused. What had he been going to say? Something caustic, probably. He moaned instead and Harry’s fingers dug hard into his wrists, and Severus resisted against him, wanting desperately to have his hands free, but there was no give. None <em> at all</em>. He realized that Harry outweighed him - was stronger than he was - and as his kiss went on and on Severus stopped trying to struggle. He sagged back against the bed, his body tingling and slack, and when he did that, Harry spoke against his mouth.</p><p>“You ask if I want to hold you down?” He pressed Severus’ wrists into the mattress, using his bodyweight. “I want to. And, I think,” he kissed Severus’ cheek, whispering into his ear, “I want to make you beg.” It took a moment for this sentence to filter into Severus’ brain. And when it did, the sound he made was pitiful. It was just so humiliating - and he was so <em> hard </em> - and surely Harry could feel it, sitting on him like that. Surely he could feel that Severus wanted anything he had to offer. That Severus wanted to beg. That he wanted Harry to <em> make him. </em> </p><p><em> Fucking say something, Severus. Don’t just - take it. </em> </p><p>He didn’t say anything. Not a single word.</p><p>“Mm,” Harry hummed, and bit gently down on Severus’ lower lip, tugging it. And then he said, “stay still,” and pulled back. “<em>Evanesco</em>.” Severus’ clothes vanished, and he yelped and sat up. “<em>Stay,</em> I said,” Harry repeated, and flicked his wand. This time there was no incantation, but Severus was immediately knocked back flat to the sheets, his wrists stuck fast on either side of his head where Harry had put them. </p><p>“Got a lot of tricks, haven’t you?” he breathed, trying to summon scorn. He was afraid it came out impressed. Or possibly… worshipful.</p><p>“You have no idea.” That little bottle was in his hand, and he climbed back up onto the bed and coaxed Severus’ knees apart. “But I can show you some more, if you want.” Severus felt one slick finger slide between his legs, and then inside him almost at once. No nonsense this time, apparently. </p><p>“Are you going to fuck me like this?” he asked, his voice shallow.</p><p>“Yes,” Harry answered, twisting his finger, thrusting gently in and out. “When I’m ready.”</p><p>“You - <em> Oh, god</em>.” He’d hit that spot inside him, touching it with just the pad of his index finger, absolutely sure of himself. “More,” Severus said. Did that count as begging? Probably not. It was more like an order. </p><p>“More?” Harry asked. “Already?” He sounded so pleased. Almost joyful. Severus flexed his arms against their magical restraints, his hands curling into fists.</p><p>“Yes!” he demanded. “Already!” Definitely not begging.</p><p>Harry laughed and pressed a kiss to his knee. And then there was a second finger. He didn’t move to stretch him, though, but continued to thrust gently in and out, just barely brushing against his prostate each time he pressed inside. A shiver ran through Severus at the light touch, from his toes all the way up through the crown of his head.</p><p>“Harry,” he growled. “Give me. More.”</p><p>“No,” Harry answered, and when Severus tried to pull him in with his legs, clamped his free hand back around Severus’ throat. “No,” he repeated, voice even. Severus dropped his feet back to the mattress. “Better.” </p><p>He moved a little more firmly now, almost like he was rewarding Severus for obeying, and Severus pressed his lips together and closed his eyes, wishing he could cover his face. If someone had told him two weeks ago that he would be allowing Harry Potter to speak to him like this, he would have laughed in their face. Nevermind all of the other things he was allowing Harry Potter to do to him. The things he’d <em> asked </em> Harry Potter to do to him.</p><p>But Harry’s breath was not altogether steady, either. And that made him feel a little bit better - that he wasn’t just being tortured for no reason.</p><p>“Harry,” he said again, more quietly this time. “Please.” The fingers inside him stroked maddeningly and then stayed on target, pressing. Not hard but - hard enough. He tossed his head to the side and snapped his mouth shut, trying to hold back the abject pleading that threatened behind his lips.</p><p>“Please what?”</p><p>“<em>Please - </em> fuck - <em> please.”  </em></p><p>Little circles now. Delicious. </p><p>And then they stopped.</p><p>“Please what?”</p><p>Severus’ arms flexed against the magic holding him, and his legs came back up. “HARRY - ” he demanded, and then Harry’s hand was back around his throat, but <em> squeezing</em>, and Severus’ whole body went rigid and then limp. “ - I didn’t know you were a <em> sadist,</em>” he hissed, trying to seem like he hadn’t just utterly surrendered. Which he had. Maybe even a while ago. </p><p>“I’m not a sadist,” Harry answered, sounding kind, and leaned over him to kiss his ribs. “I’m not hurting you. I know I’m not.” With his mouth there, Severus suddenly became aware that he was panting. His chest heaving. And he was <em> sweating. </em> Harry said it again. “Severus. Please <em> what?</em>”</p><p>Severus looked at the ceiling, expecting the room to be spinning, but it was quite steady. </p><p>“Please, can I have more,” he said slowly, forcing the words out one by one.</p><p>“There.” Harry kissed his skin again, with a gentle scrape of teeth. “That wasn’t so hard, was it?” And then, thank Merlin, three fingers. Severus spread his legs wider and tilted his hips up, and Harry let him do it. And the three fingers were all the way inside him, stroking rhythmically, circling and curling and twisting, and suddenly Severus was struck with the terrible thought that Harry was going to try to make him come like that. With just his fingers.</p><p>He opened his mouth to protest but the sound that came out was more like a sob. Harry pulsed his fingers on the spot and cursed quietly. “Merlin,” he breathed. “I feel like I’ve wasted a lot of time that I could have spent listening to you fall apart.” He brushed his thumb across the taut skin of Severus’ perineum with a touch like a feather, and Severus’ toes curled, his body contracting and releasing once with a piteous whine. </p><p>“Oh - god - ” he moaned, clenching and unclenching his hands. “I <em> can’t.</em>” The touch inside him was relentless. Merciless. Almost <em> cruel</em>, and Severus could feel his cock dripping onto his stomach. </p><p>Harry’s hand around his neck released, and slid down to his chest, and Severus’ head curled up off the bed at once, desperate, gasping, and Harry leaned forward to kiss him.</p><p>“Oh, Severus,” he murmured, and then kissed his throat, and his scars, and then over his heart, which was pounding out of his ribs. “I think you <em> can</em>.” He pressed a little harder, moving a little faster. “And I think you’re going to. And it’s going to tear you to <em> pieces</em>.” He bit down on Severus’ chest, hard, and began to suck, and Severus’ legs started to shake.</p><p>“<em>Fuck,” </em>he moaned. “Harry - oh - <em> please, please, oh please - ” </em>Harry moaned too, almost in sympathy, and lifted his head, turning his face into Severus’ neck.</p><p>“Oh, yes, that’s so good.” He sounded like a <em> master. </em> Like a <em> god. </em> “You’re so close. I can feel it. Let go. Just let go.” He bit gently at the mass of scar tissue over Severus’ carotid artery, and Severus cried out, balanced on the blade’s edge between pleasure and agony. And then Harry’s mouth left his skin, and Severus knew he was being watched, and it was <em> unbearable </em> to be seen like this. He turned his face towards one of his trapped hands, wanting to cover his mouth - wanting to muffle the excruciating noises that were pouring out of him, but he couldn’t quite reach, and then Harry’s fingers dug into his jaw and turned his face back to center.</p><p>“Open your eyes,” he ordered, and Severus obeyed - helpless, obedient - and managed to keep them open just long enough to register Harry’s pupils. They were huge, and dark, and that was all it took - just looking at him - and he was undone. His eyes rolled back, squeezing shut, and he was coming, his cock untouched, his voice cracking, wracked with shudders so violently strong that he thought he might tear off his own arms pulling on the restraints. “<em>Solvo!</em>” The bonds vanished, and Severus lurched upward, clinging, trembling, pressing his face into Harry’s neck, and Harry’s fingers were still inside him, still moving, wringing every last atom of pleasure out of him, until there was absolutely nothing left. </p><p>He fell back against the pillows, gasping, rapturous, and Harry withdrew his fingers and followed him forward, laying over him. And the hand he’d used to grip Severus’ jaw so brutally was in his hair - gentle, no, <em>tender</em> - and everything about him was so unbelievably perfect that it felt like a fantasy<em>.</em> </p><p>And… Harry was hard, pressing against Severus’ hip. Still in his trousers.</p><p>“Can I?” he asked, his breath almost ragged. “Severus. Can I?”</p><p>
  <em> Yes. Yes.  </em>
</p><p>Severus laboriously turned his head to kiss him, slow, sensuous, and when he finally felt he could speak, he did. “Yes,” he said. “You can. Just - not too hard - just yet.” Harry exhaled slowly against his mouth.</p><p>“I can do that,” he said. “I can be careful.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus was so spent, and so yielding, that when Harry pressed into him it was like a hot knife into butter. And he thought, at first, that there was no way he could get hard again after what had just been done to him. He’d thought that. At first. </p><p>“<em>Oh, God,”</em> Harry moaned as he bottomed out, “I really warmed you up, didn’t I?” He began to thrust, his movements calibrated, and Severus could feel in the tension in his body how much he was holding back. Like a coiled spring. Restraining himself. Using his strength for control instead of force. Severus’ fingertips slid in the sweat on his back, and over the ridges of his spine, and he felt like an <em> animal </em> - a primordial creature - muscle and bone and heat and passion wrapped so tightly in skin that it seemed he was on the brink of bursting out. Trying so hard not to hurt him, knowing that he so easily <em> could</em>. And it was possibly the most erotic thing Severus had ever experienced. </p><p>His spine started to tingle, and slowly, slowly, the tingling spread until he <em> was </em> hard again. And he knew Harry had felt it when his hips jerked forward, hard, just once, like he couldn’t stop himself. Then he froze. “Ok?” he asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Severus answered him, grabbing the back of his neck. “Yes, it’s - ” Harry twitched inside him and he broke off. “Ah - <em> fucking perfect.</em>” </p><p>“Severus,” he growled, tensing up. His fingers dug into the bedding like he was trying to stamp on an urge. Severus pressed his nails into the nape of his neck.</p><p>“Take it,” he breathed, and pulled him down into a kiss. “Just - just take what you want.” </p><p>A feral noise rumbled out from Harry’s chest, and in the moment before he began to move, he trembled like a stallion, and Severus felt the potential in him for such incredible savagery that he wondered what it would be like to face him on the battlefield, now. Now that he was like <em>this</em>. And then Harry snapped his hips forward, almost knocking Severus’ head into the wall. He did it again, and his hand slammed into the headboard - bracing himself, Severus realized - the muscles in his arm cording out against his own power - to keep from hurting him. Wanting to <em>protect</em> <em>him</em>, even in this frenzy. </p><p>Severus looked up at his sheltering hand, winded, almost in awe, and then he looked back at Harry’s eyes and found that they were locked on him. A molten ripple of sensation rushed through him. Had he thought he’d seen intensity before? This was overwhelming. It felt like being <em> skinned. </em></p><p>“<em>Harry</em>,” Severus gasped, bracing his own hand over his head to push back, wanting him deeper. Harder. Wanting more of him. All of him. </p><p><em> More more more more more</em>. </p><p>“<em>You</em>.” Harry grunted at the effort, hair falling over his eyes, his fingers digging into the wood under his hand. “You have not been fucked enough.” A drop of sweat trickled down his cheekbone, and Severus followed it with his eyes, wanting to lick it off. He was so - </p><p>“You weren’t here to fuck me.” <em> Was that out loud? Mercy. </em></p><p>“Ah - If I’d known,” Harry’s eyebrows drew down in concentration, and his lips parted around a sharp inhale. “I’d have come sooner. I’d have abducted you - right from the Ministry. Straight to Number 12. Tied you to the - bed - <em> fuck - </em>can you take more?”</p><p>Severus thought he might explode. Might just shoot up into the ceiling and burst apart, like a firework.</p><p>“<em>More</em>,” he choked out, and Lord have mercy, Harry gave it to him. Fucking dragged him to the edge of the bed so he could get his feet on the floor, and pounded into him so hard that the bedframe banged against the wall. Severus hooked his legs around his waist, pressing his heels into his back to try to gain some leverage, and Harry dug his fingers into Severus’ hips, and he was <em> sure </em>there would be bruises. And God, did he want bruises. Black ones. All over him.</p><p>“Pin me - ” The words were almost forced out of him with an upswell of need so hot and deep that it felt like the core of the earth pouring into his body. Need, not want. <em> NEED. </em> “Harry - <em> pin me.</em>” </p><p>A noise came out of Harry then, and Severus had a single frozen moment to wonder if it had been a <em> snarl </em> before - </p><p>Hands closed around his neck. Calloused, and implacable, holding him to the bed, and Severus couldn’t breathe. Not even a little bit. And that wasn’t what he’d meant - or maybe - <em> fuck </em> - maybe it <em> was</em>. He took himself in hand and began to spill over almost immediately, unable to make a single sound, shooting up towards his chest - <em> again - </em> and Harry’s fingers tightened intolerably, and his ears were ringing, but still, he could hear Harry say his name. Could hear him cursing feverishly, chasing his pleasure, and oh, Severus wanted to please him. And <em>b</em><em>adly</em>.</p><p>His vision going grey at the edges, he bore down with his body as best he could, and Harry gasped aloud, and curled forward, digging his forehead into Severus’ sternum. And then, just when lights were starting to pop behind his eyes, Harry’s hands suddenly disengaged from his throat, and sweet, blessed air rushed into his lungs with a flood of endorphins and a rush of delirious euphoria so strong that he was instantly addicted. This man inside of him was so strong, so devastating, so <em> ruthless - </em> how had he never noticed? Merlin, how had he lived so long without knowing that Harry Potter was so fucking <em> dangerous?</em></p><p> </p><p>Harry went slack, his knees unlocking and spilling him onto Severus’ chest.</p><p>“Sorry,” he panted. “You said - not hard. I’m sorry.” Severus forced his tingling arms to lift up to touch him. His hair was damp.</p><p>“Quiet,” he murmured. Harry exhaled a weak laugh against his skin, and levered himself up onto his arms.</p><p>“Did I hurt you? Your - ”</p><p>“No,” Severus interrupted him. </p><p>“But - ”</p><p>“Be Quiet.”</p><p>“Ok,” Harry said, and collapsed back down. </p><p> </p><p>They breathed together, in a sweaty heap, and Severus must have fallen asleep - because when he opened his eyes next he was under the sheets, and Harry was sitting up in bed beside him with a book and his glass of wine.</p><p>“Good morning, beautiful,” Harry said. Severus scowled at him.</p><p>“It can’t be morning.”</p><p>“No,” he laughed, and set his book aside. “It’s only been about half an hour.” Severus stretched and his back and shoulders cracked. “I have your glass, if you’d like it.” He handed it over when Severus sat up against the headboard. It was still almost all the way full. Severus had taken about two sips before getting dragged into bed. Definitely couldn’t blame the alcohol. Couldn’t really blame the alcohol last time, either.</p><p>He let the sheets pool around his waist, as Harry had done, and sitting next to him like that he felt like a sewer rat next to a purebred Irish Setter. </p><p>“What?” Harry asked, looking at him.</p><p>“You’re very…” Severus began, and then stopped. </p><p>Harry looked down at himself. “I got cut up a lot at the academy,” he said. “I think people were gunning for me, at first.”</p><p>“I was not going to say <em> scarred</em>.” Severus rolled his eyes. Harry smiled winningly and flexed his arms. </p><p>“Were you going to say <em> muscular? Athletic, </em>perhaps?”</p><p>He had been. Ugh. </p><p>“You are obnoxious.”</p><p>“I’ve been told that.” He sat back. “Like I said, I like to exercise. I helps me, you know.” He tapped his temple. “Stay… steady.”</p><p>Severus supposed that made sense. Made a lot of sense, actually. And here he’d been thinking that Harry was just magically spared the fallout of all the violence and death. He took a sip of wine, and Harry watched him do it, and after he’d swallowed, Harry took his left arm and turned it.</p><p>“Your mark is gone,” he said. The skin of his inner forearm was blank, and white, and smooth. Had been for four years. Harry ran his fingers over it, and a little shiver fizzed over his skin. Severus was annoyed by it. How did his body dare find energy to feel anything but exhaustion?</p><p>“Yes,” Severus said. “It disappeared that night. When you - after it was done. I didn’t notice until later. In the hospital.” </p><p>“Happy to have it gone?”</p><p>“Yes. I’d have cut it out twenty years ago if I could.”</p><p>“Mm. Too bad mine didn’t go.” He slid his palm over his forehead and up over his hair, pushing his bangs back and letting them fall into place. “I could have disappeared. No more scar, no more Harry Potter.”</p><p>“Not a fan of the adulation?” </p><p>Harry grinned sardonically. “Not too much, no. I’m not that partial to the, you know, cheering and - weeping and stuff.”</p><p>“Well, there’s no escape from that, I fear.” Harry laughed again, and Severus could almost feel it under his skin. That laugh. “Can I ask you a personal question?”</p><p>“I almost choked you out just now. I think you’ve got a free pass to have at me.” Severus looked down at his hands as he felt his face heat. </p><p>“Yes. Well. You’re only twenty-two.” </p><p>“And barely.”</p><p>“How are you so experienced? I mean...” He meant sexually. But he couldn’t quite get the word out. When Severus was twenty-two, he hadn’t even been clear on what his orientation was, let alone been able to take a lover apart like that. Of course, by then, he was already a double-agent for Dumbledore, constantly in mortal peril. And he’d been wracked with fresh guilt for facilitating the murder of his best friend, Harry’s mother. There hadn’t been a lot of time for sport.</p><p>“Oh. Well, I was at the academy. And thank you.”</p><p>“What a non-answer.”</p><p>“It isn’t. The academy is kind of notorious. You know. Bunch of twenty-somethings. Closed up together. Stress. Combat. Competition.... you know.”</p><p>Severus blinked. That was a very vivid mental picture he’d just been gifted. “So, what?” he asked. “You spent three years at the Auror academy just breaking hearts left and right, is that it?” </p><p>“Pretty much, yeah.” </p><p>And now he’d renounced his military career, and he was here, at Hogwarts. And Severus was in his blasted Gryffindor sheets, drinking his wine.</p><p>“And then you came to Hogwarts, and you chose... me.”</p><p>“Seems like it.”</p><p>“I do not understand you at all.”</p><p>“Me neither. I’m very complex.” Harry held out his glass. “Here’s to impulsivity and reckless nonsense.” Severus inclined his head.</p><p>“And with a very low likelihood of horrific death.”</p><p>“Ha! That too.”</p>
