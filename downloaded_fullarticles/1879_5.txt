  <strong>Summer, 1973</strong>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Regulus stormed into his bedroom and closed the door as loudly as he dared. He wanted to slam it but that was particularly unwise considering the state of mind his mother was in lately. Instead, he attempted to satisfy the rage that was burning inside his chest by kicking his school trunk and throwing a green cushion at the wall. He succeeded only in stubbing his toe and sending a few carefully-chosen photographs fluttering to the floor.</p><p class="p1">He loathed James Potter with a passion. And he hated his brother for wittering on about James bloody Potter all summer long. James Potter this, James Potter that — <em>he </em>had just finished his first year at Hogwarts, why couldn’t they discuss that?</p><p class="p1">But <em>no</em>. All Sirius could talk about was how James Potter had made it onto the Quidditch team this year. How <em>amazing </em>James Potter was at flying — as if it was difficult to steer a Nimbus 1000 towards a goal post. Had Sirius forgotten how good he, Regulus, was at flying? Had he forgotten that remarkable dive he had made just last Easter? Regulus was determined to make Seeker for Slytherin in September. And he was even more determined to beat Gryffindor in every single match they played.</p><p class="p1">James Potter was amazing at Charms, according to Sirius. And Transfiguration and Defence. And apparently he excelled at getting Sirius’s head stuck up his arse.</p><p class="p1">Regulus was good at Charms, too. Second in his year, only behind Clementine. He was scoring well in Transfiguration and Defence. He was excellent at Potions and Astronomy, obviously. But apparently Sirius didn’t put much stock in Potions and Astronomy. He’d sneered when Regulus had brought up his own end-of-year exam results, though father had given him a small but approving nod.</p><p class="p1">James Potter was an arrogant arsehole with a head the size of a hippogriff’s backside. He was squinty and stupid and Regulus didn’t know <em>what </em>his brother saw in him. James Potter was loud and boisterous and just plain <em>ridiculous </em>with those irritating pranks that were definitely not funny <em>at all</em>. He was the epitome of a Gryffindor and Regulus <em>loathed </em>him.</p></div>
