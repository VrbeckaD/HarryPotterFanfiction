    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>Harry Potter stared up at the peeling paint on the ceiling of the bedroom he was given. The Dursleys might have let him have it, but that didn’t change the way they treated him. He turned onto his side, wincing at the pain radiating from his back. His uncle had been harsh when he found out that he had not cleaned the back deck. Well, he had, but then Dudley had tracked mud and what else all over it.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he started to drift off until he was almost asleep.</p><p>Flash of green and he was bolting up, scream just barely held in. Breathing hard, he looked out the window and saw the rear lights of a car. The head lights must have triggered the nightmare, and therefore left his heart racing and sweat dripping down his back.</p><p>Standing up, he walked over to the empty cage on his run down dresser, and started cleaning it. His room though sparse and shabby looking was clean and organized. Being locked up for days on end, he had to do something to keep himself from growing crazy.</p><p>Pausing in his cleaning, he glanced out the window, hoping to see a white bird. He had sent Hedwig out on sending letters to his friends. Though all the replies he had gotten back had been almost blank. All the questions he asked, all the information he wanted, was never sent back. Always the same thing,</p><p>
  <em>“Mate, can’t say much, been doing chores but might see you soon.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Harry, I am so sorry, but I can’t say much. I don’t know anything anyways.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Harry, just be patient. Remus and I are working on seeing you soon.”</em>
</p><p>This was the last bunch of letters he would be sending out. No more would he be begging for things. He was tired of always being shut out of everything, even though he was always the one facing Voldemort, always putting his life on the line saving the people who no one else would.  Turning back to the cage, his eye caught onto the notebook open to the latest entry.</p><p>
  <u> <em>The anger has been bleeding through more. Scar itches all the time. Last night dreamed that I was torturing Wormtail, He wanted information on something, an area in the Ministry.</em> </u>
</p><p>Closing the notebook, he placed it into the drawer of his bedside table. He had been recording anything that he got through whatever connection he had with Voldemort. Tom. Whatever he felt like calling him at the time. His mood had been erratic these last few weeks. Ever since he had gotten back to his relatives, after the tournament, after Cedric....</p><p>He wasn’t going there. <em>He wasn’t</em>. He saw it enough when he closed his eyes at night. Tapping at the window startled him out of his thoughts. Hedwig ruffled her feathers, as though she knew he was upset and mad that he wasn’t letting her in to comfort him. Opening the window, he smiled as she nestled on his shoulder and preened his hair. Glancing at the one letter attached to her leg, he sighed. He wasn’t expecting much with this, but his heart still sank at the words.</p><p><em>“Harry, mate Hermione and I have been busy with chores. We don’t really have time to write everything down. But again I think we will be seeing you soon.”</em> And under that was Hermiones tidy writing. <em>“Harry, like Ron said, we have been so busy. Hope to see you soon. Remember to do your summer homework, as I don’t think we will have time to do it once we meet up.”</em></p><p>Crunching it up in his hand, he grits his teeth against the pain of the lack of response from his supposedly best friends. Tossing the parchment to the side, he threw himself on his bed, wishing it would break, he wanted to break something. Anything. This frustration, this anger in him, would not be easily shoved away.</p><p>Knowing he wouldn’t be able to get any sleep before the sun rises, as he could start to see the dusting of pink in the sky, he stood back up, checked on his luggage, and got dressed for the day. He heard the alarm going off in his aunts’ room, and stood ready with his sparse toiletries. As soon as he heard the last lock on his door fall, and his aunt opened the door, he rushed to the bathroom with her harsh “10 minutes boy.”</p><p>Washing his hair as he brushed his teeth, one hand for each, a trick he had to learn to save time. He made it out with maybe 40 seconds to spare. He quickly filled the 2 bottles of water and headed back into his room. He shut the door just in time to avoid his uncle. He could hear the pounding of his footsteps as he neared the room. Breath held he waited as they stopped outside his door, and let it out as he heard the locks being set back.</p><p>This early in the summer break, his relatives tended to leave him alone. If he could prove that he could hold in his “freakishness” they would start to let him back out around the second week. Looking at the calendar, it would probably be tomorrow that his aunt demanded him to cook breakfast or lunch. Never dinners on Sundays, as that was family time for them. He was shoved into his room, with maybe a stale cheese sandwich.</p><hr/><p>It was in fact another week before Petunia came to his door one morning, after Vernon had left for work, that he was left out. A list of chores was shoved at him and he got to work, happy to be out of his room and doing something. Hedwig was starting to get annoyed with how much he was cleaning her cage. Once he was done the indoor section, he headed outside into the hot summer sun to begin weeding the front garden.</p><p>2 hours later, he stretched his aching back as he put away the mower. He felt a lot better getting some hard physical labour done, as it helped him keep his mind on one thing and one thing only. Not passing out. Walking over to the hose, he turned it on and sprayed the garden and grass, to stop it from browning. He checked to see if his aunt was around, not seeing her, he turned the hose on himself and gasped at the cold water encased his overheated body.</p><p>Knowing he had about another 2 hours before he needed to be home and starting on dinner, he put the hose away after drinking his fill. He looked around and saw that most of the people on the street had been hiding inside with the record breaking temperature. Knowing he probably wouldn’t be running into anyone, he started heading towards the park located a few blocks away. There was a sing set he enjoyed sitting on and letting the time pass. Sometimes he would swing as high as he could and let his imagination go wild. As the swing took him forward he would force his mind to think he was taking off on his firebolt and was racing away from this horrid place.</p><p>Stepping over the parks border, he saw that he wouldn’t be alone this time, as there was another kid swinging. As he stepped up, taking the swing on the far side from them, he saw that the kid was crying. Looking closer, he could see why. His nose was crooked and blood coated the front of his shirt, neck and mouth. His arm, that he held on his lap, looked crooked and.... Harry couldn’t place it, but something over all was wrong.</p><p>The kid looked up, and smiled through his tears. “Hey,” was whispered through cracked lips, causing a scab to break open and bleed sluggishly.</p><p>“Hey, are you ummm.... do you need help?” Harry asked, not really knowing what he would do to help.</p><p>The kid looked into his eyes for a long time, long enough to make Harry start to feel uncomfortable. Well more than he already was.</p><p>“No, well, not the help you can offer. Just yet.” A small smile formed on the face. Harry was confused, Help he couldn’t offer yet? Looking closer, he saw that the kid looked to be about 4 or 5. Bloodshot green eyes looked out through lank black hair. He looked familiar, but when Harry tired to place him, he got a bit of a sharp pain behind his eyes. Almost at the location of his scar.</p><p>“Hey Big D, isn’t that your freaky cousin?” a shout from behind him startled him, and he looked behind him. He saw his cousin, Dudley, and his gang marching towards him. Turning around to warn the kid to run and hide, he saw that the swing was empty and moving slightly. Shaking his head, he thought that the kid must have run as soon as he heard the shout. Sighing he got up to face the group of morons.</p><p>Dudley sauntered up, well as much as he could, seeing as he weighed probably the same as a baby killer whale. He shoved Harry down and stepped on his chest. “What are you doing here freak? Mom said you had chores to do today.”</p><p>“Hey Dudders, or is it Big D now?” Harry sarcastically asked, even if it did come out wheezy. The weight on his already injured ribs wanted to leave him breathless and crying, but he wouldn’t give this stupid bastard the joy.</p><p>The foot dug in hard. “Shut up freak. Wait till I tell dad you have been to the park when you know you’re not allowed.” Dudley had gone a bit red in the face at being called Dudders, but it was probably more in anger than embarrassment.</p><p>Wincing at the added pressure, he slumped down and looked away. Better to let them think they had him beaten down, then take more injuries.</p><p>Dudley let him up, but once he regained his feet, shoved him down again among the laughter of his gang. Harry just sighed and stood up and made sure to step back, out of any of their reach. Looking at the sun starting to sink, he knew he should start heading back in order to start on dinner. “Well this has been fun, but I need to get back and start dinner. See you soon <em>Big D</em>.” Making sure to say the last part as sarcastically as he dared he started to walk home. Hearing footsteps behind him, he looked to see Dudley and his gang splitting up, probably hearing dinner and thinking they should get home to eat. Probably to keep up the energy to beat down people half their size, and a fourth of the size of his bastard cousin.</p><p>“So how is that freak school of yours? Is that where you met your boyfriend?” came the sneered question from Dudley.</p><p>“My boyfriend?” Harry asked, not really paying attention. He was to absorbed in watching the coming rain clouds. He thought it was supposed to be sunny for the whole week, with clear skies during the night.</p><p>“<em>Oh Cedric, please Cedric don’t leave me! Not Cedric!</em>” Dudley taunted in a high pitched voice. “I hear you screaming his name at night.”</p><p>Harry whipped around, pulling his wand out and shoving it between the rolls on Dudleys neck. “<em>Never say that name again</em>. You don’t get to talk about him.” Harry shoved it harder, making him wince and pale.</p><p>“You’re not allowed to do any of that freakish stuff, mom and dad said so. Said you wouldn’t be able to go back to all the other freaks.” Dudley paled more, starting to sweat. Harry forced himself to breath, he calmed enough to shove his wand back into his pocket and turned and walked towards the tunnel that would bring them out onto Privet Dr. In his angry haze, he didn’t realize how dark it got. Unnaturally fast.</p><p>Once they entered the tunnel, Harry started to feel cold. Dread filled him, and not just because of the cold and what he thought it meant, dread filled him because thats what Dementors do. They take your happy feelings away. He didn’t have many at the moment, but enough to notice that this wasn’t right. Pulling out his wand he turned towards his cousin.</p><p>“Dudley, I need you to run when I say run ok?” Harry saw that Dudley looked almost like he was crying. “What are you doing Potter? Stop it!”</p><p>Grabbing Dudleys wrist, he started to pull him through the tunnel and shockingly his cousin allowed it. He made it just halfway when he saw the flowing black robes of his worst fear. Grabbing his wand tighter in his hand, he went to turn around, only to see another one at the other end of the tunnel. They were trapped.</p><p>“What are you doing here? You’re not allowed here. Leave.” He tired to sound confident, but it probably came out as a plea.</p><p>“What are you on Potter? There is no one there, now stop this now or I will tell dad to lock you up for good!” Dudley had started to pull his wrist out of Harrys hold, but Harry just held tighter. He hated his relatives, but he wouldn’t let his cousin get his soul sucked out of him, even if he thought he probably didn’t have one.</p><p>“They’re dementors Dudley, cant you see them?” Harry shouted, trying to think how to escape.</p><p>“There is nothing there, now STOP IT!” Harry felt a punch hit him in the face. He fell and hi wand went flying out of his grasp. Getting up he frantically looked around for it, spotting it halfway between him and one of the dementors. Ignoring the pain in his face, he sprinted to his wand and grabbed it just as the dementor took hold of him and towered over him, forcing his face towards its black hooded face. Peering around as much as he could, he saw Dudley in the same position. Thinking on any happy memory he could, he closed his eyes to focus. He could hear his mother screaming, sounding far away, but getting closer. He thought about his friends, but the sting of betrayal ruined those thoughts. Sirius? That also had a similar sting. He couldn’t think of anything! Just as he was about it give up, a song came to mind, a rocking sensation. Focusing on it, he remembered a song, sung with a beautiful voice.</p><p>“<em>Expecto Patronum</em>!” he shouted, and was almost blinded as white light filled the tunnel. By the time he was able to clear his vision, he didn’t see the dementor that had him, so he turned to send his patronus to help Dudley when he noticed that his cousin was already standing up and looking around. Knowing the dementors were gone, he turned to thank his patronus but froze.</p><p>He expected to see the stag, his fathers’ animagus form, but instead he saw a snake and a panther. Not 1 stag but 2 completely different animals. Losing his focus in the shock of that discovery, they faded away. He kept staring at the spot they disappeared until he was grabbed and shoved against the wall of the tunnel.</p><p>“Freak, you are in for a world of pain! What the fuck was that? What did you do? What were those animals!” Dudley was up in his face, almost spitting in his anger.</p><p>“Dementors, they tried to suck our souls out. Those animals, they were the spell to send them away,” Harry was still shocked, he didn’t know what was happening. He barley felt the pain of landing on his butt when Dudley let him go. “Im telling Dad. You’re going to regret everything.” With that, Dudley left the tunnel, to go home and start making Harrys summer that much worse.</p><hr/><p>Harry slowly changed positions. When he had gotten home, he was grabbed and shoved up the stairs by his uncle. The next 3 hours was full of pain. He never knew his uncle could keep going for so long. The lashes on his back had finally stopped bleeding. He probably could have gotten away with just an hour, but shortly after he returned, an owl had swooped in and hit Petunias favourite vase and smashed it. The letter he had gotten was not a shock, but still, it hurt to hear that he had been expelled from Hogwarts.</p><p>Gasping as his back hit the corner of the stairs, he tried to get into a more comfortable position, however the cupboard did not have much room.</p><p>When his uncle had just started going ballistic about owls, another one came soaring in, this time hitting Vernon in the back of the head. It dropped a letter on Harrys lap, and flew out before anyone could react. Vernon grabbed the letter and tore it open.</p><p>“Don’t leave the house? You bet your freakish ass you wont be seeing the light of day for weeks if I can help it.” He threw the letter at him, and Harry scrambled to read it before his uncle decided to take it back.</p><p>
  <em>Harry, please stay inside your relatives house. Headmaster Dumbledore is working on reversing the expulsion. Dont do anymore magic. Maybe seeing you soon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Padfoot</em>
</p><p><em>Dont cause anymore trouble</em>? He was being attacked! What was he supposed to do? Let his soul be sucked out? Harrys anger only lasted seconds before a foot caught him in the side and he curled up in pain.</p><p>Vernon had kicked, punched, whipped him with his belt, and anything else he could do. He thought he probably had some broken ribs, and maybe a fractured arm. His ankle hurt, but he knew it was only sprained. He had been shoved back into the cupboard, however that was over a day ago from what he could hear from outside. He heard the Dursleys get up, and head out for the day. He had blacked out and only came to when He could hear them saying good night and heading to bed. Now he was waiting on them waking up, hoping his aunt would let him out soon, at least to clean himself up. He had, in his unconscious state, soiled himself to his shame. He tried to clean up as much as he could, going against the pain and working in a small space.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, his aunt didn’t let him out, his uncle had been the one to drag him out when he got home that day. He had dragged him outside, and shoved him to the grass. A cold wave of water covered him and in his pain induced state, he gasped but couldn’t fight back. After what seemed like hours, he was finally freed from almost drowning and picked back up. His uncle dragged him to a new shed that had been built since he was last outside.</p><p>“This is where you will stay until we need you boy. “ and with that, Harry was thrown into the shed, and the door slammed shut. Feeling around, he was a little surprised that the floor was just a tarp that covered the ground. He had more room now to move, however it was only enough to maybe straighten out and have his feet flat on one side and his head pushing against the other. In the corner was a bucket, full of cold water. He also noticed that there was a bag of semi hard bread and some of the granola bars that Dudley refused to eat. Knowing they wouldn’t be this lenient with food, he knew he needed to ration this as long as he could.</p><p>He dug a corner out, noticing the shed had been built with a foundation in the ground. So he wouldn’t be able to escape through digging a tunnel. He had heard a lock click when the door was shut so he wasn’t even going to waste the energy to check the door. Laying down, he got as comfy as he could, and decided to use this time to try to rest and heal as much as he could. He hoped he wouldn’t get an infection from his wounds.</p>
