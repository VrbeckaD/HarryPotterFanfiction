    <p>It wasn't a particularly pleasant evening, rain trickled down the windows yet it was still fairly warm. Draco Malfoy walked outside without a jacket nevertheless, his hair slicked back with rain, painting him similarly to his younger, even more arrogant self. He is seemingly wandless, his hands stuffed into his jean pockets and while the rain may mask it to those nearby, he is crying. The reason is almost irrelevant, for it is extremely rare to see the hard faced Slytherin boy cry. It is many hours before he shelters himself from the rain, exhausted but far too tired to sleep. </p><p>A little while away, a tall, dark haired, bespectacled boy is fast asleep, fringe pushed back, revealing the widely known lightning scar going across his forehead. He is dreaming, in which he is watching somebody, somebody he could recognise if only they would turn around, but they don't. While he himself is sheltered in a shop doorway, the mysterious figure stands out in the rain, completely exposed other than thin clothing and a bandage wrapped tightly around their right forearm. </p><p>Harry Potter wakes up shivering, as if he really had been out in the cold of his dream. As he thinks this, he wonders whether it really was a dream, for it felt just as real as this very moment that he ponders. He attempts to shake it off and gets up out of bed, sliding his circular glasses over the crooked bridge of his nose as he does so.<br/>
Ron is stirring in the bed beside him, Harry observes, perhaps creepily,  as he awakes. With seemingly good reason, Ron looks startled upon seeing Harry. 'You alright Harry?' he asks, rubbing the sleep from his eyes followed by a loud yawn along with a single blue bubble left over from binging their Honeydukes purchases the night before. As if not hearing him, Harry continues to stare in Ron's direction. Ron's face crumples with confusion as he waves a hand in front of Harry's face, quickly bringing him back to reality. 'Sorry, yeah I'm fine' Ron frowns, drawing attention to the dark orange freckles decorating his cheeks 'You don't look or seem fine mate'.</p><p>Harry slides his trunk out from under the bed, tracing the HJP with his index finger as he loosens the clasp. He pulls out his uniform and robes as he says 'I'm fine, honestly Ron, I just had a strange dream'. Ron sighs to himself asÂ  Harry closes the curtains around his bed and begins to get changed behind them. 'It wasn't you know who again was it?' Ron finally plucks up the courage to ask. Despite knowing he is hidden behind a curtain, Harry shakes his head vigorously as he says 'No, no, not this time, it was about, in fact, I'm not even sure who it was.' Ron cocks his head to the side in confusion 'Care to explain?' He asks. 'It's just, in my dream, there was this person, stood out in the rain and I was watching them, I could sense that I should recognise them but I didn't'. While Harry may be unaware of this, Ron appears much more puzzled than before. 'What so you mean their face wasn't familiar to you at all?', Harry pauses, hesitating due to the strange nature of his connection to his dream. 'Well the person didn't exactly turn around, is all'. Ron cant help but laugh as he says 'Then how the bloody hell could you tell you didn't know them?'. </p><p>Harry sighs as he opens the curtains of his bed once again, sliding his wand into his robe pocket while running his fingers over the delicate engraving at it's base. The Signum Amoris or as many folk call it, The Soulmate's Engraving. The engravings themselves have no obvious meaning from just looking at them, they seem to be random intricate patterns. Despite this, it is said that every engraving has an identical twin on another wizard's wand. They say that the owners of the matching wands are destined to be together, soulmates, and that due to this, those two wizards may never duel, for each of their wands will refuse to harm the other. Many wizards, Hermione being one of them, claim this to be utter nonsense, believing a different theory concerning the magical trees that the wands are crafted from. Harry himself favours the soulmate tale, he likes the idea of someone being able to love him unconditionally, and that fact being decided by fate. However he doubts the credibility of his views since his constant battle with the dark side makes it very easy for him to run away with the idea of love.</p><p>Harry finally looks up at Ron and attempts an explanation of his dream 'It wasn't so much that I didn't know them, even from the back I had an idea of who it was' he pauses, leaving Ron an opening to express his confusion 'Then what on earth are you talking about Harry? Did you know them or didn't you?' Harry absentmindedly runs his hand through his messy fringe as he says 'When I looked up at them, I felt a rush of positive emotion, like it was someone I should have a strong connection with, but if it was who I think it was, that would surely be impossible,' he shakes his head to himself.</p><p>Ron sits down beside Harry, 'Well who the bloody hell was it then?'</p><p>Harry hesitates before he says</p><p>'Draco Malfoy'</p>
