    <p>
  <span>Hermione ruffled her hand through her frizzy hair, letting out a dramatic sigh. Unfortunately, even a sigh was cause for a sharp look to be sent her way from Madam Pince. The librarian let out a tsk and she looked meaningfully at the brunette from over the top of her glasses. The bookworm took that as a cue to move; Madam Pince must have been in a bad mood. Hermione wandered around the shelves until she found a far more isolated study area, one that she had discovered in her second year before she was paralyzed by the Basilisk. It was at a table far away from the entrance to the library, and by proxy from Madam Pince’s tutting and terse admonishments. Hermione had a few too many reasons to sigh at the moment; the last thing she needed was to add pissing off the librarian to that list. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Chief among Hermione’s sigh-able concerns was her current Potions paper. Well, her angst wasn’t entirely about the paper. It was only a summary of counter-jinxes, after all, nothing too complicated. The new Potions professor (and boy, everyone was shocked that Potions was not being taught by Snape), although demanding and harsh, was showing a small kindness in starting the year by giving the students review work and a chance to refamiliarize themselves with potions minutia after a long summer away. This was a different approach than students had come to expect, but a positive change in Hermione’s book. Snape’s teaching method, though surprisingly effective given the dour man’s apparent hatred for teaching, was somewhat light on theory. The theory was something that his brightest students were able to pick up simply by repeated exposure to different brews and ingredient preparation techniques. However, Snape’s practical-heavy classroom style did leave gaps for those who didn’t naturally make the high-level connections, or those, like poor Neville who were simply too scared by the professor lurking in order to be able to apply any connection they might make.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A review of common ingredient properties and cauldron procedures was very much in Hermione’s wheelhouse. Indeed, it was the type of assignment that Hermione would have normally flown through; it should have involved only light research, taking into account her excellent memory and her drive to self-study in previous years. Except Hermione hadn’t been feeling quite normal for some time. She had been feeling rather… off… since the moment the sorting finished at the start-of-term Feast.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione was shaking her head exasperatedly as Ron was talking a mile a minute. at Harry (and her, she supposed, but given his speed of speech it was hard to tell).</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Oi, mate, Bill was able to take me to see a Cannons practice, not quite the same as a game, mind, but it gave me some ideas for Keeping drills I could practice before tryouts this year, yeah? And…”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>When the redhead slipped into Quidditch talk, Hermione felt her attention wander. She tried her best to show up to House games in order to support Harry, but even despite getting on (and, ok, getting it on) with Viktor, Hermione just didn’t have a desire to learn or talk about the sport. It was dangerous, somewhat senseless, and although the flying maneuvers were impressive, Hermione could care less about who just signed with the Chudley Cannons or whether the Wimbourne Wasps could win the League.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Further down the table, towards where the professors sat, she could see Fred and George and Lee all laughing and whispering. The trio suddenly straightened, turning to stare at the head table with patently innocent expressions on their faces. Hermione followed their gazes and noted that Professor McGonagall was now shaking her head at them slowly.  </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The doors of the Great Hall were flung open, and that was enough to somewhat quiet the students’ chatter, leaving only rolling whispers filling the grand space. It seemed Professor Snape had drawn the short straw and had been forced to retrieve the first years from the front hall. Hermione would have laughed if she wasn’t also worried about the first-years being traumatized beyond the appearance of the House ghosts. The hook-nosed professor seemed to shudder as he walked alongside the children, towering over them. Hermione, no Legilimens, was pretty sure she knew what he was thinking. It probably involved the words “brats”, “irreverent”, and “sticky”. He paused and spoke lowly to the throng of first years, before gliding up to the head table in a billow of black cloth. Hagrid peeled away from his spot at the back of the pack of eleven-year-olds, his job herding the new students complete.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Her attention somewhat divided by Harry and Ron’s chatting, Hermione observed the first-years. They were short, and some of them were pale and nervously shifting their weight as they stood in single file, waiting their turn to be sorted. She clapped and cheered raucously with her Housemates whenever they welcomed a new Lion, unable to really get in the proper spirit when Harry and Ron were whispering about Voldemort’s return and the Order and when they might be allowed to attend meetings. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She did manage to focus when Dumbledore finally stood, clearing his throat. He beamed as he stared out over the student population.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Before we begin our first meal back together, I have an introduction to make.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He paused.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I would like to introduce your new Potions professor…” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The entire hall exploded, staring between Snape and Dumbledore.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Blimey, mate! Is the old bat finally quitting? ” Ron erupted.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“We can only dream, mate,” Harry whispered back.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dumbledore coughed again.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Professor Thomas Riddle!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>A tall, thin man came from the door behind the head table, dressed in a smartly cut emerald robe. Hermione felt her draw drop despite herself.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The new professor was, simply put, hot as hell. He was all angles, sporting prominent cheekbones and a sharp jawline. His hair wasn’t extremely long, but it fell in slight waves over his forehead.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>His eyes were what really did Hermione in. They were brown, but the opposite of warm. They were predatory, harsh. Powerful.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione felt her knickers start to dampen. Unconsciously, her legs crossed a little tighter. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hello everyone,” began Professor Riddle. “I am pleased to be teaching Potions at this distinguished institution. I am hoping to be able to share with you my knowledge and experience gained from my mastery which I completed recently at Ilvermorny under Master Grinnauld Smith.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>His fucking voice. It was smooth, somehow sibilant, and downright sinful. Hermione felt like there was a faucet in her panties; she was dripping. She tried to think very, very unsexy thoughts. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione heard, rather than processed, Dumbledore congratulating Snape on accepting the Defense Against the Dark Arts post. Her head was swimming with thoughts of her new professor. Her young, hot new professor. Her young, hot, well-spoken new professor. God damn it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That night, Hermione had begged off too much socializing, feigning a headache, and had gone through her nightly routine on autopilot, rushing. She threw herself into her four-poster and after a strangled “good night” to her dormmates, she cast three different silencing spells on her bed’s curtains as well as spelling them closed. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione’s fingers dove into her knickers. She ran her fingers along her dripping slit, marvelling at the liquid gushing out of herself. She dipped a few fingers in and out of her cunt, already imagining them being the professor’s slim ones. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Professor.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione brought her other hand down to circle her clit with tantalizingly light pressure.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Thomas.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione slipped another finger inside herself.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Riddle.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione moaned loudly as she came, body going limp. She removed her hand from inside herself and wiped her juices on her nightgown, too boneless to get up and rinse her hands.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Even after moving to a quieter corner of the library, back by the Restricted Section, Hermione couldn’t concentrate. It was all she could do to focus on </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> focusing on her Professor while she was actively in Potions class. At least in class, she could dedicate herself to brewing, to precisely slicing and chopping and juicing and stirring. She could focus on house points and on beating Slytherin in the House Cup and </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> think about the way a pleasant thrill ran through her lower body every time Professor Riddle said “Very good, Hermione. Five points to Gryffindor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alone in the library with just her thoughts, Hermione was a goner. She flopped over her half-finished essay, unable to concentrate on explaining why the process of making hellbore into syrup increased its efficacy when all she could think about was effing Professor Riddle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione glanced around the library. It really was empty in her corner. The only people who would come this way were probably professors; the entrance to the Restricted Sections she was at led to books that contained mostly information about historical teaching practices (well, and torture practices), not something students usually concerned themselves with.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could feel herself dripping, her clit throbbing with a need to be touched. She kept thinking about that day’s Potions class, and the way Professor Riddle had helped correct her potion. She thought about his hands and their long fingers wrapped around her wrist as he guided her through a complex stirring pattern. She thought about the way he had leaned over her, and how she could feel his thighs brushing against her back, and how she could only think about the way his package also felt against her back, and his warm breath near the top of her head, and his musk… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>God, she had literally left a wet spot on her chair when she got up to turn her final potion in at the end of class. She had soaked through her woolen robe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione tried to fight her instincts, knowing that she was in public, that she was in the </span>
  <em>
    <span>library</span>
  </em>
  <span>, for Christ’s sake. But her body had other ideas. It started to rock on her chair, grinding itself into the seat cushion in an almost humping manner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione took another look around before she decided, fuck it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She slouched down a little in her seat, reaching up under her robes and spreading her legs wide to give herself plenty of access. She pulled her knickers down to her knees, knowing that they would only get messy and in the way but loathe to remove them entirely in case she needed to make an emergency getaway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even as Hermione began to furiously rub her clit, a part of her was panicking. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Someone could see me. What if I am caught</span>
  </em>
  <span>? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rule-following voice in her head was freaking out. But another darker part of her just egged her on. The idea of getting caught masturbating in public was a huge turn on for the brown-haired witch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She thrust her fingers in and out of her pussy, her wetness making them slide with ease. She couldn’t help letting out a few mewls and moans as she imagined Professor Riddle pushing his dick into her from behind in the Potions room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor Riddle,” she moaned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, her pleasure reached a peak, and Hermione came, clenching around her fingers. She cast a quick Scourgify on her hands and then wriggled her knickers back over her hips, feeling the damp fabric slide back over her wet pussy lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione gathered up her potions papers into her satchel quickly. She wasn’t going to get anything more done in the library, that was for sure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So hasty was her getaway that Hermione didn’t notice cold brown eyes following her from the Restricted section, focused intently on the way her plump, perky ass bounced as she disappeared around a shelf of books. Those eyes were found in a thin, muscular body; they were attached to a young Potions professor with a throbbing cock that was tenting his tailored robes most impressively. The professor took a steadying breath, but all he could smell was his student’s juices. He threw down the book he was carrying, leaving it lying on the floor as he stalked off to his quarters as fast as humanly possible.</span>
