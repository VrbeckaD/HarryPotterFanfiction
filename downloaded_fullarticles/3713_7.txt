    <p>“Hurry up boys, we’re going to be late!” Let nobody ever say that Lily Luna Potter wasn't her mother’s daughter. James rolled his eyes skyward and cursed the day his parents made the decision to procreate after the birth of their first, perfect child. He and Albus were both already standing by the fireplace, as per usual it was Lily they were waiting on. They shared an exasperated glance, shaking their heads almost in sync, and huffed a sigh each. The only time they ever got along was when they were complaining about their sister, but wasn't that always the way with siblings. </p><p>Harry shuffled into the room, pulling his daughter’s trunk behind him. As soon as he noticed his sons watching he began huffing and puffing, slowing dragging the apparently heavy trunk across the room before dropping it at their feet with a large groan. James turned his head to hide the small smile that had crept across his face, it wouldn't do for a fifth year to be caught laughing at his parents lame jokes. </p><p>Lily flounced into the room not a second later. Harry turned to meet her with a wide innocent grin stretched across his face, which soon turned to a frown when he noticed what she was wearing. Before he could say anything a call came floating down the stairs.</p><p>“Lily Luna, you can turn yourself around and come right back up these stairs, there is no way you are leaving this house in a skirt that short!” Lily grumbled a bit but did it, no one in their right mind would disobey mum when she spoke like that. Dad looked relieved, he hated fighting with his kids, especially baby Lily.</p><p>“Second years these days” Albus mumbled, James threw a grin his way whilst Harry simply chose to ignore them. Within minutes Lily was back, Ginny a step behind her, strolling straight to the fireplace and flooing to Kings Cross. Mum let out a frustrated groan before quickly following her; she hated it when Lily did that, especially these days. Harry picked up her trunk and hurried after them throwing a wink the boys’ way. </p><p>Both James and Albus picked up their luggage, rushing forward, fighting to be the first one through. Albus won and with a cocky grin threw the powder down, disappearing in a flash of green fire. James paused for a moment, taking in the quiet room, their mismatched furniture and the happy family pictures that graced the pale yellow walls. With a small fond grin he grabbed his trunk, and the handle of his owl’s cage and followed his family through the flames.</p><p>***</p><p>The hustle and bustle of the platform assaulted him as soon as he stepped out of the fireplace, he shook his head, disorientated.</p><p>“Jamie, this way” his mother called out, he glanced up just in time to see his family disappearing into the sea of people. He followed after them, knocking into a girl on the way.</p><p>“Sorry!” he called over his shoulder, not even stopping to help her up, he’d feel bad about that later, but now he had to get his luggage on board and score a nice carriage for his friends.</p><p>***</p><p>Halo dusted herself off as Cassiopeia reached down a hand to help her up.</p><p>“It’s pretentious idiots like Potter that really make me hate this world” Cassiopeia only nodded. She’d had a crush on Potter for years now, and she couldn’t quite bring herself to say anything bad about him.</p><p>“Come on, let’s say go say goodbye, maybe we can actually get our own carriage this year.” Cassiopeia pulled Halo through the bustling crowd of people. They had aimed to get here quite early, but like usual they had somehow ended up late. She really didn’t know how it happened, clearly time management was quite poor in this family. </p><p>***<br/>
"Now, Jamie, I want you to look after your sister this year…” </p><p>“This year? Are you implying that I didn’t look after her last year?” </p><p>“No Jamie, of course not” Ginny sighed, eyes locked on Lily as she looked around for her friends (or maybe cute boys, James amended), paranoid that she would try to run off again. James looked over to see Harry muttering away to Albus, turning back to find Ginny half way across the platform after an escaping Lily. </p><p>With a slight shake of his head at his crazy family James jumped onto the train and wandered off in search of an empty carriage. </p><p>***</p><p>“Bye, Mr and Mrs Finch-Fletchley, see you next year” Halo called with a grin as she left Cass to say goodbye to her family and jumped on the train. She knew that at least Lizbeth would already be here, and would probably have snagged a carriage for them. If she hurried she’d be able to stop her from letting anyone else bully their way in. She walked briskly down the hallway dodging the various kids that littered the way. About halfway down the train she saw Liz’s distinctive pale brown, curly hair disappearing into a carriage. With a grin she sped after her, finally this year they would have a carriage, no more sharing with third years, or being squished in with five other people.  </p><p>She was so caught up in the fantasy she almost didn’t notice when she ran into Potter again, right outside the door of Liz’s carriage. </p><p>“Excuse me.” she said politely, trying to side step him. With a mischievous grin on his face, he matched her.</p><p>“You don’t want to go in there, it’s occupied.” He proclaimed, wiggling his eyebrows like a creep.</p><p>“Yeah, by my friend” She insisted, knocking him out of the way and throwing the door open with a snort of derision. It took her a second to comprehend what she found inside. With her mouth gapping open she watched as Liz frantically threw herself back off the lap of the one and only, Hamish Thomas. </p><p>“Told you” Potter smirked from behind her.</p><p>“Oh, hiya Halo, good to see you, had a good summer?” Liz asked, voice slightly shaky as she straightened her short blue denim skirt, retucking in her yellow stripy top where Thomas’ fingers had clearly pulled it up. Halo only raised her eyebrows, her lips slightly pursed, clearly unamused. </p><p>“Right well, we best be off. Gotta go find our friends” Liz continued, trying her hardest to make this frighteningly embarrassing experience as normal as possible.</p><p>“That’s okay babe,” Thomas said as he stood up too. </p><p>‘Babe’ Halo mouthed, eyes locked on Liz.</p><p>“You can have this carriage, we’ll find another”</p><p>“Don’t be silly, you were here first. Come on Halo, I’m sure the others are looking for us” and with that Liz swept out of the room, dragging Halo with her.</p><p>“Babe, babe, BABE!” Halo frantically whispered “What in the hell was that?”   </p><p>“I was going to tell you.”</p><p>“When!?” </p><p>“Well, now, I guess.” Liz tucked a ringlet behind her ear as a blush overtook her face.</p><p>“You could have owled me. And why on earth did you give up the carriage?” </p><p>“Oh, Halo, stop being ridiculous, I’m sure the others have one. Plus he was there first.”</p><p>“Whatever” They continued the rest of the way down the train in silence.</p><p>“Halo, Liz, in here.” Cassiopeia called out from an open doorway before disappearing back inside. Before Lizbeth could step in Halo grabbed her by the arm.</p><p>“Are you happy?” she asked quietly. Liz nodded, a small, besotted smile on her face.</p><p>“Then that’s all that matters.” And with that Liz and Halo followed Cass into the carriage.</p><p>***</p><p>“So, anything new to report this year, girls?” Thalia asked as she munched away on a liquorice wand.</p><p>“Oh, nothing in particular” Halo mumbled with a sly grin Liz’s way. Lizbeth shook her head frantically, wide eyes begging Halo to stop. Halo, like the good friend she was, relented, munching away at her own chocolate wand. </p><p>“Do you know who got prefect?” Cassiopeia asked quietly from her seat by the window. </p><p>“Do you even need to ask?” Catarina laughed abrasively “Obviously it was Miss. Perfect Anastasia.” </p><p>“You don’t know that.” Thalia argued.</p><p>“Oh, don’t I?” Catarina asked, thick dark eyebrow raised almost to her hairline.</p><p>“Actually it was Anastasia, I heard her talking about it on the platform.” Lizbeth piped up, glad for the change in topic.</p><p>“That’s nice for Ana, perhaps we should go and congratulate her?” Thalia suggested, in that way of she had that made it clear it wasn’t really a suggestion. Cassiopeia nodded and trotted after her as they left the carriage. </p><p>“So I might be kinda dating Hamish Thomas.” Liz burst out. Halo couldn’t help but giggle when Lizbeth threw her hand over her mouth as if she couldn’t believe she had said that. </p><p>“You what?” Catarina asked almost snorting her pumpkin juice, dark blue eyes widening in shock. “For how long?” </p><p>“Since the beginning of the summer.” That stupid smile graced her face again.</p><p>“Wait, this doesn’t mean we have to hang out with him and his friends do we? Cause I don’t know if I can handle spending any prolonged time with a bunch of Gryffindors.”</p><p>“Here, here.” Halo muttered </p><p>“Don't worry it's my relationship, nothing needs to change with us. We don't need to broaden our social circle to include anyone else.” Her voice was dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>“I think we have a broad enough social circle, thank you very much.” Catarina argued, affronted. </p><p>“Don't even kid, you hate half our friend group anyway.”</p><p>“Exactly, what on earth makes you think I would want to make it any bigger.” </p><p>Halo tuned out the argument she has heard a thousand times before, and let her gaze drift out to the passing countryside. </p><p>They were interrupted by the opening of the carriage door five minutes later, when Potter, Thomas and two of their friends barged in and threw themselves down on the empty seats. </p><p>“There’s this thing called knocking, and you know, waiting to be invited in, basic manners.” Catarina grumbled, the boys ignored her, focused on Thomas and Lizbeth. </p><p>“So this is your lucky lady, huh?” Wood started, holding his hand out “I’m Bay Wood, this here is Fred Weasley the second, and as I have no doubt you already know, this is James Potter.”</p><p>“Also the second, that’s very important, adds prestige” Potter added with a cocky grin. Liz gave a small smile, but Halo could tell she wasn't all that impressed. Thomas also gave a slight grimace, maybe he was able to read Liz too, either that or he knew how much of a pretentious douchebag Potter was.   </p><p>“We just wanted to come in, break the ice, get to know you a little. The usual.”</p><p>“The usual? So Thomas has dated a lot of girls then?” Catarina questioned harshly.</p><p>Once again the boys ignored her, talking amongst themselves and clearly settling in for the long haul. Halo threw a glance at Catarina but she crossed her arms in a huff and turned her head to watch as the English countryside passed by, she was not going anywhere, not if it meant leaving Liz in here alone with the boys.</p><p>Halo got up and with a gesture at Liz, left the carriage, she wasn't going to spend the rest of the ride to Hogwarts being ignored, no matter how desperate Liz looked, she'd be fine with fierce Catarina. </p><p>Halo wandered down the train glancing absentmindedly into each carriage as she passed, hoping to find one full with her friends. In the second to last carriage, she struck gold. </p><p>“Hello lovelies, how are we all?” Halo particularly sang as she pulled the door open, six stunned and guilty faces swung to look at her. “Uh oh, what have I walked in on?”</p><p>"Oh it's nothing, we’re just gossiping” Renesmee waved her off, flipping her pale thin hair over her shoulder.</p><p>“Ohhh, who are we gossiping about?”  Halo enquired playfully swinging into the room and plopping herself down between Sarah and Jane with a wiggle. Sarah laughed and swatted at her while Jane just smiled. </p><p>“We heard an interesting rumour.” Thalia began, clearly winding up to drive into a long suspenseful story. Portia cut her off.</p><p>“Is Liz dating Hamish Thomas?”</p><p>“I can neither confirm nor deny.” Halo smirked, leaning over to grab a bright purple sweet out of Cassiopeia's bag. </p><p>"So it's true!” Cass exclaimed.</p><p>“I didn’t say that, but what I can say is that Thomas and his friends may or may not be in our carriage right now. Make of that what you will.” With a shrug Halo focused back on her sweet, it was sherbety, similar to a pop rock. Perhaps a fizzing whizzbee, a few seconds later she started floating, definitely a fizzing whizzbee.</p><p>“Yep, it's totally true.” Thalia looked satisfied, as if she had gotten to the bottom of some amazing mystery. Halo wasn't willing to burst her bubble. </p><p>She stared across the carriage as her friends moved on to different topics she couldn't be arsed to focus on, preferring to instead watch as the light streaming in from the small window highlighted the blond streaks in Cass’ hair, turned Thalia’s into a light bouncy golden mane and reflected wildly off the reading glasses perched on top of Portia’s head.</p><p>A few hours later, after a rousing game of wizards chess and a long discussion on the amazing books they had read that summer, the three girls returned to the carriage to change.</p><p>“What do we do if they’re still there?” Cassiopeia wrung her hands together as they moved back up the train.</p><p>“We give them a show of course.” Thalia threw a flirty grin over her shoulder, her blue eyes sparkling. Cass’ eyes almost bugged out of her head “I'm kidding, gosh Cass, as if. No we’ll send them packing, at least Catarina will. If she hasn't already” Thalia finished in a mutter, and sure enough when they opened the door, only Liz and Catarina remained, in a thick silence, noses buried in their respective books. As the saying goes ‘you could cut the tension with a knife’. </p><p>They both looked up, relief gracing their faces. </p><p>“Come on girls, time to change.” Thalia almost trilled, oblivious to or ignoring the tension that still permeated the air. They all shuffled into their uniforms, faking a groan or two at the itchiness of the material and confinement of the shirts, but none could hide the real relief they felt at what the uniforms signified. They were almost home.</p>
