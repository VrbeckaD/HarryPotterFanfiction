          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1">Tom opens the door to their bedroom and finds Harry sleeping on their bed in Tom’s shirt. It looks big on him, reaches all the way to his thighs.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There’s an ache in Tom chest and he immediately goes to Harry, wrapping his arms around the sleeping boy.</span>
</p><p class="p2">If there was one thing he didn’t like about his quest for world domination, it was being away from Harry for too long. He guessed there was the option of taking Harry with him, but that would be too dangerous. And although Tom knew Harry was perfectly capable of defending himself, Tom couldn’t stomach the idea that Harry would ever need to defend himself from anything. No. Tom would never let it come to that. That’s why he was always at home, safe.</p><p class="p2">“Tom?” Harry groggily asks.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom shushes him. “Go back to sleep,” he orders gently.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry yawns and pulls Tom closer to him. He asks for a kiss, Tom obliges. “You were gone for so long.” Harry says, eyes closed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom feels a little bit of guilt. Harry hated being away from Tom too. And Tom knows it’s because he’s been alone all his life, orphaned as an infant, just like Tom. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The taller boy does not know why he didn’t think of this before, of how every time he left, Harry would tell him to come back as soon as he could.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Even back in Hogwarts, Harry never liked to be alone.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When they were in their seventh year, Harry had talked to him one day, blushing profusely and avoiding Tom’s eyes, and shyly asked if he could sleep in Tom’s room one night. The Head Boy room was rather huge and had space. He said that since his dorm mate graduated, he’d been sleeping alone, and the problem was, he couldn’t sleep very much.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They weren’t even together yet. They just knew each other from spending so much time in the library. Harry was all innocence and light magic while Tom was... Tom was the exact opposite. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom didn’t know why, but Tom had agreed to let the boy sleep in his room.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry was never one to back away from first moves. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And it only took a week of Harry shyly grinding and moaning softly against Tom when they started to fuck like rabbits. Harry had spread his legs open and begged Tom for some kind of release. And what was he supposed to do when those big green eyes were looking at him so desperately?</span>
</p><p class="p2">Tom fucked him hard that night, revelling in the experience that his innocent, sweet, shy Harry was so <em>loud</em> in bed. And so wanton. Begging Tom to fuck him harder, begging to taste him and suck him in his mouth, and begging him to <em>please please</em> come inside.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">On nights that Tom went to his dorm late, Harry would be waiting, naked, on all fours, ass up in the air and legs spread for Tom. Or on his knees ready to pleasure Tom with his mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">On nights when Tom was too impatient, he would pull Harry on top of him, knowing in that position Harry would cum almost instantly. Harry was tight, and Tom buried that deep inside him hit all kinds of sensitive spots. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom felt himself go hard at the memories. Harry’s eyes opened wide and he looked at Tom already feeling his bulge against him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Tom,” he whimpers, already aroused as well.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry,” Tom whispers before he sucks on Harry’s neck. Harry moans against his ear, legs spreading so he can rub his own heat against Tom’s.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Tom please just—<em>now</em>—please, I can’t—“ Harry begs, already clawing at Tom’s pants.</span>
</p><p class="p2">Tom spells their clothes away, impatient, and just as hungry for Harry as Harry was for him.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom thinks nothing compares to being inside Harry while the boy tensed against Tom, back arching, and eyes half-lidded in pleasure.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Tom,” Harry whispers. “Please don’t ever leave me again.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom kissed him hard in the mouth, not wanting to hear that kind of sad desperate voice from Harry ever again. Suddenly, he asks himself if world domination really was worth it. What could the world give him that Harry couldn't?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom holds Harry closer and promises, “Never.”</span>
