    <p>Hope Mikaelson was known as the “misplaced Ravenclaw” ever since her first year at Hogwarts. Her manners, the way she carried herself, her cunning and limitless ambition made everyone wonder how the girl ended up not being one of the snakes. The girl always held this mysterious aura with her, and everyone seemed to have an equal amount of respect, fear and admiration when it came to the brunette beauty.</p><p>But on the other hand, the girl was a genius. Not only was she the most talented witch since Hermione Granger, but she made it look so easy. Defense Against Dark Arts was her favorite subject, but she always though Hogwarts only covered the basics, just the defensive and never the offensive, that’s why she got her aunt Freya (at her time, the best witch in Gryffindor) and her uncle Kol (everyone’s worst and best dream and Slytherin troublemaker) teach her some offensive spells she would never perform in school property, but just to be on the save side. Because, don’t let her fool you, Hope Mikaelson had a large history of mischief. Sure nobody knew, she was never even spotted after curfew, she was too smart to be caught and she had the same passion for trouble as her uncle did. But she got caught, once.</p><p>Josie Saltzman, Hufflepuff’s golden girl and head girl. She was too kind, and too nice for her own good, or so Hope though. She had seen her around, admire her really, but she was always round her Slytherin twin, Lizzie, who hated Hope. Josie was the best example for breaking stereotypes, she was kind yes but she could be ruthless when mad. She was very protective with Lizzie for what Hope had seen, she also seemed to put herself down and let the blonde girl take the things she wanted even if it cost her own happiness.</p><p>One night, Hope sneaked out of the Ravenclaw tower and went to west galleries, it was always lonely there, somewhere she could thing and breathe. The girl loved the feeling of the cool air on her skin, it made her thing of home, of her family once so close and now so shattered.</p><p><strong> “You know, you shouldn’t be here.”</strong> A sweet voice caught her off guard, making her slightly jump.</p><p>
  <strong> “What’s up to you, Saltzman?” </strong>
</p><p><strong>“Well it’s past curfew, and you’re not prefect or head girl, so you really shouldn’t be here.”</strong> She explains resting on the wall next to her.</p><p>“<strong>Are you going to threaten me and take away points from my house?” </strong></p><p>
  <strong>“No.”</strong>
</p><p><strong>"Then what do I owe the pleasure?”</strong> the girl asks her, with a teasing smirk making the Hufflepuff beauty chuckle.</p><p>
  <strong> “You seemed lonely today at lunch. You always seem lonely.” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Well I don’t fit in I guess.”</strong>
</p><p><strong> “They say you should be a Slytherin, but I think you’re a great Ravenclaw. I mean you’re the smartest witch that’s ever step in Hogwarts since Hermione Granger herself. You don’t pay attention in class though, must be borin</strong>g.” Josie says looking outside the gallery, at the reflection of the moon on the Black Lake.</p><p><strong>“Are you that observant with everyone or you’ve just been stalking me?”</strong> Hope asks teasing her, the ghost of a smile on her lips as she watched the Head Girl blush trying to not look at her.</p><p>
  <strong> “You’re just interesting, plus my sister talks about you, complains really. And it’s hard to not notice Hogwarts most popular girl.” </strong>
</p><p><strong>“Popular because they think I was a placement mistake. Which I don’t’ mind, really.”</strong> She adds when she sees the little frown on the girl’s face, making her look cute and making Hope feel warm inside.<strong> “Shouldn’t you supposed to be on patrol? Someone’s breaking the rules?”</strong></p><p>
  <strong> “Technically, but it’s a quiet night, everyone is at the party at my house. Nobody’s really ding their job tonight.” “</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>"Why aren’t you there then? I’m sure they’ll miss their princess.” </strong>
</p><p><strong>“It’s not my scenery, not tonight.”</strong> She dismisses it with a hand movement, making Hope turn to her and cock her head to the side.</p><p>
  <strong>“And why’s that?” </strong>
</p><p><strong>“Just rather be here talking.</strong>” She says a shy smile on her lips. <strong>“We’ve been together in every class since we were first years and we’ve never talked before.” </strong></p><p><strong>“Every year?”</strong> she asks and the girl nods in reply. <strong>“Damn, I’ve miss my shot big time.”</strong></p><p><strong> “Not necessarily.”</strong> Josie whispers and they stay in silence, staring at the Lake on the dark night, with only the pale light of the moon shinning above them.But the comfortable, intimate silence they had broken when the voice of the blonde snake started to be heard from the other side of the gallery, calling for her sister.</p><p><strong> “Better go before she finds you with me; she could have a stroke or something.”</strong> Hope jokes making Josie laugh in agreement.</p><p>
  <strong>“Guess I’ll see you around?”</strong>
</p><p><strong> “I’ll see you at the library, like every Wednesday and Friday.</strong>” Hope confirms and Josie turns her head, going to ask how she knew her study habits. <strong>“I guess I did notice you a little bit. See you around Saltzman.”</strong></p><p><strong> “See you, Hope.”</strong> Josie says before turning to her sister, who held an annoyed expression when the Ravenclaw walked pass her.</p>
