    <p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p> </p><p>I am stuck. In a word of pain. In a word of oblivion. Of danger.</p><p>Danger to myself, mostly, but not only. I realize now that because of my actions, I am a danger to others.</p><p>I thought I wanted to be a threat. To them. To you.</p><p>But never.</p><p>You were dead. Lying down in Hagrid’s arms. A cold, lifeless body. Your soul was gone. And all the good that came with it.</p><p>I thought I wanted to hurt you. All those years of us fighting each other. Of making our lives difficult. I thought I wanted to strangle you, pull every single hair out of your Potter head until you begged for mercy.</p><p>I thought a lot of things, Harry. Not all good. Not all innocent.</p><p>It’s no secret, I think, that I am not brave. Courageous, like you are. I have never stood up to anyone that really frightened me. I’ve picked on the weak. I’ve picked on the ones I thought were beneath me. Like your friends. I know how much I’ve hurt them. How much pain I’ve caused. Still it haunts me.</p><p>But that is my burden to bear. My punishment for not seeing sooner.</p><p>Realizing what you are, what you’ve become, it’s a challenge, isn’t it? You know that better than anyone, I think.</p><p>The savior. The hero. I thought it was all a mask, a show you put on. But that day you went to Voldemort, that day you… died, I saw that it wasn’t.</p><p>You’ve saved me more times than I ever deserve. Saved my family, the horrible things we’ve done. You could have casted me out. Could have promised me Hell and I would have understood.</p><p>Why did you save me, Harry? Why, I wonder, again and again, in moonlight, in daylight. The clock ticks, time flies and all I can think about is why.</p><p>But I’ve come to understand that there is never a why with you. Because you believe that people all deserve to be saved. Especially from themselves. You do not need a reason. Humanity is reason enough.</p><p>And me? I am still human to you. In some ways, I guess.</p><p>I write to you because… because I’m trying to figure out what I am now. You’re the only one I can ask this to. The only thing that gives me an idea of who I am.</p><p>You’ve never taken any shit from me, have you, Potter? You’ve pushed me and pushed me and hurt me and I deserved all of it. I can only remember your eyes when you said those things.</p><p>There was truth in them. Anger. Rage.</p><p>You and I, we know what it is to bleed. Perhaps, not in the same way, but we know what it is to suffer. To hold your head between your hands and think, who the hell am I?</p><p>That is why I am writing to you, today. Because I think you’re the only one who’ll ever be able to understand what I want to say. What I need to say.</p><p>Fear. Darkness. They’ve been my only companions until now. However, loneliness has come, trapped here, in that place I don’t know, far away from my home, the very one I can never go back to, never want to go back to.</p><p>Loneliness makes you do strange things. Makes you feel what you lack cruelly. All that haunts your dreams is what you want, so bright, with such burning desire that it wakes you up at night and have you stare into oblivion. The darkness, it comes at night. It comes when you least expect it.</p><p>Do you know where I find strength, Harry? Do you know where I find light?</p><p>No, you don’t. How could you ever know? How could you ever see when I’m only beginning to see myself.</p><p>I’ve tried everything. Alcohol, tobacco, drugs, sports, books, magic, religion. Nothing works. When I close my eyes, there’s only one thing there. One thing I stare at until my eyes cry tears of fury. For the mistakes I’ve made. For the forsaken truth I’ve created.</p><p>I realize I don’t make any sense. I sound mad. I probably am. But, Harry, do you know what I see when I close my eyes?</p><p>I see green, emeralds, so vibrant with life and feeling. I see black, the darkest kind, tangled like storms of fury. I see dark skin, of a color so rich it glows under the sun and shines, so bright, so low, a rumbling fire, a beauty of limbs, of vibrations underneath it all, of a beating, pulsing heart.</p><p>I see you. Harry. I see you.</p><p>I try not to, trust me. Have you ever had your nemesis’ body haunt you in your dreams? No, of course, you haven’t.</p><p>I used to think it was some kind of punishment. My mind, it would relive our years at Hogwarts. To pain me further, to make me understand what I had lost. It took me so much time to realize I was only seeing you. Always you, Harry.</p><p>I can’t… I…</p><p>I think I love you.</p><p>I think deep down I’ve always loved you.</p><p>I think now that we’re apart, now that you’ve started anew, now that you’re out of my reach, I can’t let you go.</p><p>I think I’ll never let you go.</p><p>Sanity, yes, perhaps I’ve lost it. It wasn’t always there to begin with but now, now it’s definitely gone.</p><p>Crudely, I ask you to forgive me. I ask your friends to forgive me. All that I did, I thought was the only way to do it. The truth is I was too scared to take a step towards goodness, towards love, towards joy.</p><p>Emotions, I’ve never been good with them so I’m asking you.</p><p>Tell me if what I felt was real? If what I feel now is real?</p><p>Because, Harry, I am losing my mind. I am drowning in an ocean where there is only you and I cannot surface to take a breath.</p><p>This letter, it’s my only hope. It’s my only breath, Harry.</p><p>I don’t want— I don’t want to be alone anymore.</p><p>There is this one memory, of you laughing in the great hall, that makes me feel like I am more than alone. How do you laugh like that, Harry? How do you feel such joy? Such pleasure?</p><p>It’s all too foreign to me.</p><p>I’ve written more than I wished to say. But, after all, if this is the last confession I make, I wish to tell the truth. The whole truth.</p><p>I am who I am, whoever that might be.</p><p>So let it be known, that Draco Malfoy might, perhaps, be in love with Harry Potter.</p><p>Let it be known that I, in stolen time, for burrowed minutes, have burned for Harry Potter.</p><p>You’re my own hell. My own redemption. My only chance.</p><p>As you know, however, I am too much of a coward to let you try and save me.</p><p>You will never read this.</p><p>You will never know.</p><p>You will never realize, Harry, that there is someone who loves you deeper than he thought he could ever love.</p><p>That there is someone, for so many nights, who has thought only about your eyes.</p><p>Green is all I want to remember. Of us. Of our time together.</p><p>Green is my only punishment and green, green is my only redemption.</p><p>You have saved me, Harry, but you’ve also condemned me.</p><p>You’ve trapped my soul, and I don’t think it ever wants to be freed.</p><p> </p><p>Yours truly,</p><p>Draco.</p>
