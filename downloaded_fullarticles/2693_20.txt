    <p>Blood trickled down her jaw and sizzled as it hit the fresh snow below.  </p><p>All that could be seen of Hermione Granger was her form crouched in the semi-darkness, muscles contracting as her innards heaved to bring up dribbles of vivid, red-stained bile.</p><p>She brought her palms up to rest on the scratchy bark of the tree in front of her as her retching finally stopped. White snowflakes fell in her eyes and a few caught on her lashes.</p><p>The owl perched on the branch above her blinked slowly, eyes flashing in the night like the headlights of a car.</p><p>
  <em>One-Two-One Two-One Two One Thr--</em>
</p><p>Her breathing paused as the crispy snow crunched in the blackness behind her.  Romeon’s wings whipped the air violently as he leaped off the branch and disappeared into the night. As the crunching continued, she tried not to choke on whatever fluid remained in her mouth.</p><p>A growl.</p><p>Frost seeped into her quivering heart, leaked into her arteries and froze her in place.</p><p>Hermione was paralyzed.</p><p>A werewolf was behind her, having caught the smell of her blood.  </p><p>Fenrir Greyback was long gone, but she had never been able to think of lycanthropes without calling forth the image of his flashing teeth and cruel eyes.  <em>I'd say I'll get a bite or two, wouldn't you? </em></p><p> Her attempts at moving her limbs or reaching for her wand were useless. She wondered if the werewolf was also a wizard who had wandlessly petrified her.</p><p>She felt the creature’s presence behind her, and felt it inhale the scent of her puked up blood.</p><p>Silence overcame them as she waited for the lycanthrope to strike, though the cogs of her mind never stopped turning. She knew a few wandless, nonverbal spells. Now was not a good time to reprimand herself for not bothering to properly learn to cast them.</p><p>She waited</p><p> </p><p>And waited</p><p> </p><p>And when she collapsed under the weight of her tensed-up muscles, she knew it was gone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Infirmary at Hogwarts had a stagnant smell, like it was cleaned with plain water instead of disinfectant. Hermione rubs the nape of her neck and smoothes down the front of her robes before making her way towards the stairs at the end of the hallway.</p><p>Although she had reason to visit the <em>hospital</em> wing many times as a student, this was the first time she set eyes on it following the repair overhaul Hogwarts underwent after the war.</p><p>Poppy Pomfrey greets her with an affectionate hug. Her intelligent blue eyes and graying hair gave off a sense of familiarity that helps ease the nervousness that overcomes Hermione.</p><p>“I’m glad you’re giving Hogwarts’ Healing Center a chance, Hermione.  Pursuing mediwitch training at St Mungo’s might have seemed like a better choice, but I assure you Headmistress McGonagall has gone through long lengths to make sure our mediwizard center is on par with some of the best in the country. “</p><p>The new Healing Center was all clean, white hallways with high walls and doors embedded into the wall every few steps.</p><p>“You’ll be training with fellow mediwizards your first year and depending on how well you do on your written exams, as well as in your magical prerequisites, you’ll follow through more specialized studies. I’ve been appointed head of the Nursing Department… which means I’ll be instructing young mediwizards such as yourself the basics of wand healing, topical application of healing potions and the minutiae of healer-patient interaction. You’ll meet your other professors soon enough.”</p><p>Hermione nods, thanking Poppy and clambers up to her new rooms.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s eyes dart across what is to become her living quarters for the better part of the coming year.</p><p>
  <em>Not overly different from the private rooms of a Head Girl.</em>
</p><p>She spends an hour rearranging the bed, desk and rest of the furniture to her liking, lining up the books she brought with her on the shelves, opening up her files and color coding the notes she had taken over the past two years.</p><p>Her first week at HHC feels somehow no different than any other she’d had before, even though she knows it should.</p><p>It’s all the same, wake up at six, shower before the washrooms become a hub of early morning gossip, head down to breakfast, visiting old classes, to lunch, to old classes, to dinner, to her dorms to change and then off to bed.</p><p>It’s mindless.</p><p>Or it should be, if Hermione could stop thinking about <em>it. </em></p><p>That <em>thing</em> that chose not to eat her alive while blood oozed down her throat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few nights later, Hermione is out at a wizarding pub catching up with Harry and Ron.</p><p>They laugh as Hermione looks miserably down at the rum filled cup.</p><p>“It just tastes so foul. Why would I even enjoy imbibing this crap? I can get drunk on something a lot less…concentrated. It smells like something Miss Pomfrey would use to disinfect wounds”</p><p>Ron dodges one of the dancing, sweaty bodies and leans back against their table “Because you’ve been acting like a sissy all through the night and we need you to let go. Now.” He crosses his arms and shoots Hermione a goofy grin.</p><p>She rolls her eyes, and give in. She didn’t quite anticipate how <em>bad </em>she actually needed the crazy night Harry and Ron were proposing.</p><p> </p><p>A few hours later, Hermione, in all her drunken glory, opens the book on her night stand and decides that brushing up a bit on her anatomy won’t be a bad idea right now.</p><p>The blurred letters tell her otherwise.</p><p> </p><p>—————————————————</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>…We mustn’t share secrets that aren’t ours to share, Minerva.” </em>
</p><p>Clipped and… sliky, she thinks.</p><p>Hermione snaps her anatomy book shut at the sound of the voice.</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She walks out of her dorms, into the media-wizard apprentice common room, trying not to trip on the armor to her left. The voices were coming from the hallway outside.</p><p>She walks in on Professor McGonagall and a tall looking wizard. She had owled her previous transfiguration professor earlier that week, and was surprised to see her professor back to Hogwarts so early (McGonagall had told Hermione she was not in the country and would be back when apprenticeships were to begin.).</p><p>It takes her brain a few seconds to realize the man next to her is none other than <em>Professor Snape</em>.</p><p>McGonagall whips around at the sound of Hermione’s drunken stumble, her uptight bun whishing through the air in a graceful <em>wooooooosh</em>.</p><p><em>Woooooosh</em> thinks Hermione, holding back a laugh bubbling its way out her chest. She shakes her head, trying to clear the haze she knows she’s currently in.</p><p>Maybe she shouldn’t have given in to the rum.</p><p>Professor Snape turns around as well, his face as sour as ever as he barely gives her a glance.</p><p>“…don’t even fathom the notion of sharing this information Minerva. Do not repeat that old fool’s mistake” he says in a cold, shard-ice voice, looking back to Professor McGonagall.</p><p>Hermione is surprised to see her former Potions Professor, but she knows she shouldn’t. She hadn’t visited Hogwarts after that deadly battle two years ago. She had heard that Professor Snape had survived, but was surprised to see him, nonetheless.</p><p>She wonders if her former professor recognizes her at all. <em>All the better if he doesn’t, I won’t have to deal with his constant bullying</em>. Being Harry Potter’s best friend had its consequences after all. Professor Snape’s newfound Byronic Hero status did not change his hatred for Harry, and Harry did not expect it to.</p><p>It took another few seconds for Hermione to notice that the two adults were still conversing, and then that Professor McGonagall was speaking to her.</p><p>“…and Miss Granger, I know apprentices have no restrictions as to what time they leave the castle, but please do refrain from staying up late the night before your first day” she says, her grey eyes hardening in displeasure.</p><p>Professor Snape finally seems to fully notice Hermione. He faces her, taking in her lime-green robes. His eyes linger on the emblem stitched on her chest.  A wand and bone, crossed.</p><p> “The Granger chit. A mediwizard.  How pre<em>dict</em>able.” he says to McGonagall.</p><p>So, he <em>did</em> recognize her. She internally curses.</p><p>“I see your two other pets aren’t here to cause any mischief. Although, I do believe the Granger girl is nuisance enough on her own, seconded only by that insufferable Weasley child.”</p><p>It’s been 2 years since she last saw Snape, but Hermione still doesn’t like the way he talks as if she isn’t standing right there.</p><p> </p><p> “You will not speak of my former students in this manner, Severus” Professor McGonagall glares daggers at the man before rolling her eyes. “You will be seeing her in your Potion 220 class, I assume. You <em>are</em> taking Chemical Basis of Medicinal Potions, are you not Miss Granger?”</p><p>Professor Snape shoots Hermione a look so sour she wants to apologize.</p><p>Hermione nods and looks away, wanting to meet neither the pale nor the dark pair of eyes currently fixated on her.  </p><p>She awkwardly pushes back curls that fall down on her cheeks, turning to leave, trying to walk properly as she feels her mind begin to clog up.</p><p>The Potions Master narrows his black beady eyes in suspicion. </p><p>“The Granger girl should avoid imbibing substances which further impair her already lagging reflexes. I wouldn’t trust her with a scalpel” came the silky jibe.</p><p>The <em>Granger girl</em> turns around, finally lifts her chin up, looking straight at Professor Snape’s face. However, she isn’t brave enough to look <em>into</em> the eyes of the older man, opting to scrutinize the pale stretch of flesh between them, still finding the authority his eyes carry intimidating.</p><p>Before she musters up the courage to defend herself, his eyes flick to the wand-bone on her front and they narrow this time in what appear to be accusatory judgment. So do Professor McGonagall’s.</p><p>
  <em>Great</em>
</p><p> McGonagall frowns “Surely, Miss Granger, you do not need your Potions Professor telling you why excessive alcohol consumption can be harmful to your body. You’re off to become a mediwizard after all.”  </p><p>
  <em>Color me surprised</em>
</p><p>Hermione says nothing, just nods, annoyed at what her Transfiguration professor notices <em>only because of him.</em></p><p>What a great start to her mediwizard apprenticeship.</p><p>She frustratingly swivels around, fighting hard to regain her composure like she always does, and unceremoniously trips on Professor Snape’s dark robes before falling flat on her face. </p>
