    <p>He arrives in New York very late at night. It has taken him almost 12 hours door to door to get here and he is exhausted and hungry, though rather than check in to his hotel or find something to eat he had Ubered straight to the bar using the coordinates Sirius had text him, impatient to see him again after so long. Sirius had wanted to meet him at the airport but he had insisted no, he didn’t want to be any trouble and besides, meeting at airports was a thing that lovers did. And they were not that. Not any more at least. And if he had anything to say about it, never again. They had talked about this after it was clear to all concerned that he could no longer put off coming, and they had decided sex was off the table. Actually, they had agreed to keep things calm and professional and then Sirius had added <em>and no sex</em>, and Severus had said <em>what is wrong with you? That goes without saying you reprobate</em>, then had added after a seconds thought, <em>actually that’s a good rule, let’s keep that</em>. At any rate the other way didn’t work, hadn’t worked every time, even during those heady few months when the band looked like it was going to break the US and they had thought that what was an ill conceived, hasty marriage could fix everything that was broken between them. When things went pear-shaped and the band and Sirius had disappeared from his life Severus had missed him as you would a limb. But, what at first was unbearable, over time became a dull ache, until eventually he just got used to it. Though sometimes, absently, perhaps after he had pulled an all nighter returning on the red-eye to his lonely London apartment from Berlin or some such place having signed some pink faced, wide eyed, electro pop art school darlings (who would eventually come to hate him as much as they now worshipped him as some symbol of ‘having made it’), his mind would slip and reach out to him and all at once he would feel, briefly, like something was missing.</p><p>As he steps out of the Uber his impatience has been replaced with something like dread. Quite rightly too, he thinks. He really should have sent his assistant.</p><p>The bar is called Dogstar, which strikes him as derivative and egotistical. As long as he had known Sirius Black he has had a narcissistic streak a mile wide. It is minimally signed and located below street level so that he has to walk down a short series of stairs to the door. Inside, it is narrow, low lit, loud with the sound of guitars, and packed with the kind of glistening, sartorially curated youth that would think nothing of paying $200 out of their barista wage for a pair of bespoke hand rendered locally sourced leather suspenders. He hates it on sight. It’s just the kind of place that he would own, Snape thinks, he is not surprised by any of it. He shudders and pushes his way into the room, scanning as he does so. As much as he is au fait with the hipsters and the art school geeks, he despises this world. Black is actually one of the few people who know just how unhip his tastes really run. His idea of an enjoyable evening is listening to Mozart and reading one of the classics. He considers most of the music he signs to be simplistic, shallow and unpractised, though occasionally he will come across something that he believes to be a real art. (He had thought at the time Gryffindor were that, they are what drew him into the business after all, but that was a lifetime ago). Though, he is good at what he does and is respected for it. Perhaps because he is not a salivating, simpering fan he is able to see more clearly than most what will work, and what won’t. And what will shit so much money that he could practically ask his bosses for a blowjob for Christmas and they would happily get on their knees.</p><p>Sirius sees him before he does, Snape wonders if he’d been looking out for him all evening like he would have done. Perhaps he had because he’s making his way through the crowd toward him and damn if that million watt smile on his face isn’t just for him. His features smooth and he feels what he always feels when he sees Black again after any length of time. Like when you wake up with a throat like sandpaper, and you seize at the glass of water that’s on your nightstand, that very first sip, that’s what Sirius Black has always been to him. (Though it’s perhaps fitting that, in keeping with the same terrible, overwrought analogy, he always takes too much and eventually he always drowns.)</p><p>They embrace and neither of them seem to be in any hurry to let go, it’s too easy to breath in deep, to fill his lungs with him.</p><p>Sirius kisses him just below his ear and says up close so Snape can hear over the noise, “You hate it don’t you?” He can hear the grin on his voice.</p><p>“It’s loathsome.” He replies, raising his voice to be heard over the din.</p><p>Black leads him to a small empty booth at the back near a small shallow stage. He motions to an impossibly pretty girl with a sharp, intelligent gaze and bushy brown hair that Severus hates on sight. She disappears down the other end of the room to where there is a bar along the wall and when she appears again it’s with two bottles of IPA that she sets wordlessly in front of them. Sirius and the girl smile warmly at each other for a second before she sweeps back into the crowd. He wonders if they’ve slept together, and how many times.</p><p>“Stop that.” Black chides him.</p><p>Yes, he reminds himself, business associates don’t care who the other has slept with. And they certainly don’t imagine tripping pretty girls with smooth skin and too easy smiles as they walk past with full drink trays.</p><p>“It’s hard not to touch you.” Black says.</p><p>His heart gives an involuntary throb.</p><p>“Damn you Black, don’t say that shit.”</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>He neither looks nor sounds sorry.</p><p>Even so, he smiles at him. “I’m glad I came.” He says.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Sirius had been in equal parts dreading and anticipating Severus’s arrival for several weeks now, ever since it had seemed likely this would happen. As their former manager and someone who dealt with these kinds of contracts for a living he didn’t blame the rest of the band for approaching his ex to negotiate the deal. He knew them best and, as Peter had argued with characteristic vileness, he owed them. Though that Severus had managed to leverage his position as the manager of a moderately successful early naughties Brit band into a force to be reckoned with within the independent music business Sirius thought said more to his sharp instincts and fierce intelligence than any influence on the band’s part. However Severus must have believed so because here he was, flying half way across the world to negotiate a low level deal for a group of aging, mostly forgotten former rock musicians. Though that the deal was with one of the largest TV studios in the world must have somewhat sweetened the deal for him, Sirius reasoned, Severus was nothing if not canny.</p><p>He’d been looking out for him all evening which was stupid because he knew what time his plane was due. His staff must have thought him mad, he’d been vague and forgetful all evening, and after dropping his third glass Hermione had in her usual straight up fashion told him they didn’t need him out the front tonight after all. Hadn’t he been saying he needed to get some work done? He agreed though only after he had cleared one of the booths at the back by the stage to sit on with his laptop, not that he would get anything done. He didn’t miss Hermione’s scowl at him using up what was prime real estate at this time on a Friday night either, but he ignored her as he usually did.</p><p>When he arrives he sees him immediately, sees him scowl, sees that lip curl. The first thing he thinks is how good he looks, which is a pain, but <em>damn</em>, he would have noticed that guy walking into his bar even if he were a stranger. Though Severus has always turned his head. Used to be a skinny little weird looking thing, hanging around the bars, trying to be noticed. He remembers the first time he saw him, asking James who that ugly kid was staring at them. Severus Snape he tells him. He’d never forget that name. Remembers staring long after James had walked away, so that James had turned around and yelled, “oi Black!” They never stopped staring at each other really, after that. But now he’s not the only one who notices. He can tell that straight away. He’s grown into his looks, he looks powerful, important. Like a man used to getting his way. Same too large, aquiline nose, hair grown out to below his ears, now greying. Other people look, he can see them look. Women. He wonders if he notices. He can’t help but beam at him when he finally spots him and the way he looks at him, it sure doesn’t seem like he notices anyone else at all.</p><p>When they finally sit, he gets them a drink, and Severus tells him he’s glad he came and he lets out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.</p><p>“You’ll stay?” He asks, ”For a bit?”</p><p>“Yeah I’ll stay,” he says, “for a bit. Black, we have to talk about this deal.”</p><p>“Sure.” He says noncommittally.</p><p>“Black.” He warns darkly, in a baritone that he imagines is employed to great effect on poor young things eager to sell their souls for a fist full of dollars and their face on a t-shirt. It’s not ineffective.</p><p>Sirius smiles at him conspiratorially, with dimples. That seems to distract him.</p><p>They talk, though not about business, and the next time he notices the bar is emptying. Severus’s face is illuminated by the candles on the table and the dim red bankers lamps and Sirius can almost imagine they are 21 again in some dive bar in Soho. Sirius tells him how he found this place, how he sunk what was left of his money into it on a whim five years ago. It hadn’t seemed like a risk at the time, what else was he going to do? He could play guitar and sing and that’s about it. There wasn’t many job opportunities for an ex con muso, and he’d used up any Black family favours he might have had getting into the states. And though he’d just been looking for a little place where he could play, and maybe make a little money on the side, he got lucky, when he moved in, the neighbourhood was just about to take off and the place ended up being fairly zeitgeisty, spoke to the general hipster movement that was just starting to be a thing. Now he has another bar in the East Village and they’re just about to open another in Hell’s Kitchen.</p><p>“Black?” He says when Sirius stops talking.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“How’s he doing?”</p><p>Sirius smiles. “Great. Really great. You wanna see him?”</p><p>“He’s here?”</p><p>“Upstairs. Well, he’s supposed to be. We have an apartment up there.”</p><p>“No. No, it’s late. Tomorrow. Or…”</p><p>“No, tomorrow’s fine. Tomorrow’s great. He’ll be happy to see you.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Of course. We have a lot to thank you for, all you did to help get him out here. And from what Harry says that’s not all you’ve done, over the years.”</p><p>“I was just acting on Dumbledore’s instructions, he was not a man you said no to, as I’m sure you know. It was all him.”</p><p>“Oh, I doubt that.”</p><p>“My god can you believe it…”</p><p>“James and Lily’s kid. I know sometimes I really can’t.”</p><p>“Doesn’t he look..?”</p><p>“Just like James? Yeah. But he has her –“</p><p>“Eyes. Yeah, I know.”</p><p>“You still miss her Sev?” There was no love lost between Severus and Sirius’s best friend and Gryffindor lead guitarist, James. But Severus and Lily had grown up together and were as thick as thieves.</p><p>“All the time.”</p><p>Eventually Severus says, “I should go.”</p><p>“Stay? It’s late.” The bar’s empty now save for his staff who are cleaning up around them, pouring knock off beers, and celebrating the general lack of customers.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea, do you Black?”</p><p>“I mean on the couch, you egotistical twat.”</p><p>He raises one eyebrow mockingly. “Sure you did.”</p><p>“Fuck you Snape.”</p><p>“Not tonight sweetheart.”</p><p>“Ugh I forgot about your terrible, obvious jokes.”</p><p>“You mean my quick wit.”</p><p>“No I don’t mean your quick wit you moron I mean that you are objectively an awful person.”</p><p>“You’ve always been too slow for me.”</p><p>He groans, “Weren’t you leaving?”</p><p>Snape laughs. “Yeah. Yeah I am.”</p><p>He picks up his bag and gives him a small, bemused smile before turning to leave.</p><p>“Hey.” Sirius calls after him and he turns.</p><p>Sirius quirks the corner of his mouth up teasingly, “you’ve still got a nice ass Snape.”</p><p>Severus laughs and shakes his head, “idiot.”</p><p>Sirius watches him walk away and he feels… pretty damn good. That went better than he could have even hoped. He feels like they could even be friends. He had half thought they really couldn’t be in the same room without eventually fighting or fucking. Usually both. This has really been such a positive healthy experience for them. He’s bloody proud of them actually.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>It’s after three when Severus finally gets to the hotel. He’s expected of course, his assistant, who was a minor miracle really, had anticipated everything, even the delayed time of his arrival. He’s not sure what he’s going to do without him for the next week, he really should have bought him. When he gets up to his suite, he doesn’t sleep straight away, throws off his jacket and sinks into the couch, he undoes the top few buttons of his shirt and flings his Longines on to the coffee table with less care than he probably should. The watch was a gift from one of his clients who last year he had helped to sell several millions of albums and cost about how much he makes in a year. And he did ok. He still had a lingering distrust of egregiously expensive things like that; Black and Malfoy, richboys both, had always viewed this tendency of his as a curious oddity.</p><p>His over-tired brain tries to process the reality of seeing him again. The last time they had seen each other – God 10 years ago now – Sirius had just been released from prison. Their marriage, their relationship, was long over, had been for years, but Severus had still pined for him madly during the whole two years of his sentence, visiting him as often as Black would allow and shamefully, once more after he told him to stay away during which he had both cried and begged. If Sirius hadn’t rung and told him to meet him at the prison gate he would have been there anyway. He had brought him back to his flat, recently bought, small and basic but it was his, and Sirius had fucked him on his unmade bed. At the time he had thought that he could somehow win him back with a steady job and a walk-up in Camden. Sirius would stay at home and Severus would build him a studio in his spare room and Sirius would greet him at the door at the end of each day, briefcase in hand Severus would kiss him on the mouth and Sirius would say I missed you. For a while he had thought of little else. He remembers Sirius had looked bone tired that day, <em>I’m gagging for a shower, </em>he had said. Severus had said not yet, then stripped and walked wordlessly to his bedroom and his heart was beating fast at the very real risk of rejection, ugly fucker that he was.</p><p>Even though after he had ruined everything.</p><p>Sirius, his darling, had held him after and kissed the top of his head. “I’ve missed you kid,” he had said softly.</p><p>Like a car crash he was powerless to stop Severus had replied, not with, I missed you too, not with, come back to me and I’ll look after you and I’ll protect you from everything, but instead with, “Why didn’t you let me see you? Were you fucking someone else in there?” Even now he finds it hard to say why he would say that. They had both fucked around toward the end, when their marriage was in tatters, and they had nothing more to say to each other, nothing good anyway, nothing that didn't start in "fuck" and end in "you." They had both done it specifically and precisely to hurt the other. At least he had, he had no interest in being with anyone else, it's just that he couldn't be with Sirius either and for some reason it had made sense to both of them to torture each other. Though why it would occur to him to start objecting then, after everything, years after they had broken up, he couldn’t say.</p><p>Sirius had gone quiet then. He got up and started putting on his clothes.</p><p>“You know, Severus, I’m not your fucking boyfriend so you don’t actually get to ask me that shit.” He had said, and Severus had been shocked and confused to see his eyes were glassy with tears. It took him far longer than it should have to figure out.</p><p>Sirius left and didn’t come back and a few months later he hears that he’s moved to America. This was a mistake, he said before he left that day.</p><p>At the time he had been angry, confused, in so much pain he thought he might die from it, he had genuinely assumed they would eventually be together, he had thought that because he loved him so terribly that it would just be so. A lesson well learned, and one that served him well these past 10 years. No commitments, no emotions and clear expectations. His life, like his relationships – sexual or otherwise – is ordered, predictable, no fuss.</p><p>Though against all expectations tonight couldn’t have gone better. Yes Sirius was, as expected, jarringly handsome with his thick dark hair, swept back like a fucking movie star and two day growth along a jawline that you just wanted to cut yourself on, and yes, when they had embraced it had felt a little like home, like a piece of himself clicking back into place. But they had behaved like adults, which was a first for them, there had been very little sniping, no ill feelings and certainly no promise of sex that usually hung in the air between them, thick and choking like smog. When he had walked away he had felt genuinely optimistic he could fit Sirius (because like it or not because of Harry he would have to) into his ordered, drama free life. It was really such a relief.</p>
