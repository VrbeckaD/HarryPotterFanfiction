    <p align="justify">He should not have read them. Those letters were meant to be personal. How would he feel in a reverse situation? Well, of course, it would bother him <em>only in case</em> he found out that somebody else in fact had read through a series of his private letters. And she will not be informed about this.<br/> But still, what a fool he was for not being able to stop himself! All of the letters had been laying in a pile on her desk, and as he absently glanced at them, it became clear right away that those were love letters. <em>To her.</em><br/> And not from him.<br/> After all, the whole goddamn situation was screaming an invitation. An invitation to trespass. To discover the content of them. And Elphinstone just could not resist.</p><p align="justify">„<em>Dear Minerva,...” „My dearest Minerva,...” „...not a day passes without thinking of you.” „I will never cease loving you.” „My dearest Minerva...” „...after all we have shared...” „I would be willing to do everything...” „My dearest Minerva...”</em><br/> Emotionally charged wording, suggesting painful void, heartbreak, asking for clarification, and confessing ever-lasting true love.<br/> „<em>My dearest Minerva...</em>” An evidence of a deep and beautiful, but bygone bond; an unfinished story. Slightly desperate, but sincere attempt to seek explanation of the „incomprehensible”.<br/> „<em>My dearest Minerva...” „I am waiting for your answer.”</em><br/> „Faithfully yours forever, Dougal”<br/> A dozen of letters, dated mid-1950s, not suggesting anywhere that the sender had ever received response in any form.<br/> Elphinstone stood there perplexed and stunned. It honestly never crossed his mind that apart from him, Minerva might have had anybody else in her life. Prior to him or... maybe a potential rival. He himself had never been short of self-confidence, but Merlin, what a fool he was to think that such a captivating, gorgeous woman would not have other suitors!<br/> And who the hell could be that <em>Dougal</em>? What could be „<em>all they had shared”</em>? What is so „<em>incomprehensible</em>”? Elphinstone would have liked to furiously dig into the pile of letters more than anything; to search through them and to understand. Quickly running through the lines from afar did him more wrong than self-restraint would have done. He really should not have read them, gosh darn it! Ignorance would have been bliss, he concluded bitterly as a fraction of a sentence caught his eyes.</p><p align="justify">„.<em>..breaking up our engagement when you love me? All I require is a short explanation, and I promise you, that I will never write you again. Please, understand that I need to know the reason, since you said you loved me even before.</em>..” The lines were peeking from under another parchment. Elphinstone hastily moved the one on the top with a flick of his wand to be able to finish reading the entire sentence. „.<em>..you changed your mind and departed to London. Then why is it desirable to deny yourself, to deny us happiness</em>?”<br/> On the margin of the parchment, with the distinctly elegant letters of hers, another sentence was added which possibly later on – if not only a couple of hours ago –, was rather crossed out so strongly it damaged the parchment. „<strike><em>Then why is it desirable to chain myself for life to remorse and to the all-pervasive, never-subsiding heartache that springs up every time I think about the possibility of what if”? It is not desirable. And never meant to be.</em></strike>” The freshness of the ink was apparent on the aged pages.</p><p align="justify">Elphinstone’s mouth went dry in a second. He did not expect learning about anything of this sort when he crossed her door ten minutes ago. He stroked his beard, taking a look around as if remedy would be at hand somewhere in the room.<br/> On the other side of the desk, there laid another document, seemingly a death notification. He could not read it from where he was standing; it was upside down from his perspective. But before he could move, he heard her footsteps approaching. Not wanting to leave evidence behind, Elphinstone walked over to the other part of the office trying to tame his muddled thoughts. To his surprise, by the time she was there, he did not have to fake tranquillity, a strange numbness calmed him down completely.<br/> ’Earl grey or coffee?’ Minerva appeared from behind the wall separating her office from her dormitory section. ’I don’t have a wide variety of selection, I must admit. Now that the new school year is right around the corner, I must stock up.’ Her voice sounded unusually lifeless and empty.</p><p align="justify">Elphinstone decided not to stay for long, and instead leave her to rest, for she admittedly felt sleep-deprived and was busy in the run up to September.<br/> Before he left, he felt strongly tempted to sneak out some of the parchments from her desk, but he ultimately found this plan undignified and immature to a senior ministry official, moreover, utterly disrespectful towards Minerva. Instead, he planted a kiss on her forehead, and said goodbye preparing to make his way to the door.<br/> Her arms however were around him unexpectedly, she was nuzzling up closely to his stout body. Her hug felt unusually tight around his space-bones, almost clinging. Was she even trembling slightly? After a long and silent minute Minerva released him, and with a painful smile rushed through:<br/> ’Thank you for stopping by. You have no idea how much I appreciate it... and... you.’</p><p> </p><p align="justify">She was crying all night again, unable to sleep. By the morning her tears however dried on their own, and the emptiness returned. It had been the second night in a row when she was drowning herself in unbearable pain since she got notified about Dougal’s death.<br/> Dougal McGregor was the best thing she never had. By her own choice. A choice she never ever regretted rationally, but the alternative cost of which was tremendous. And now that Dougal passed away, the bottle in which her emotions were locked away, first started leaking, and within a day, the pressure resulted in a catastrophic outburst. Her subconscious was gushing the carefully buried and contained memories. Everything surfaced: the half-buried shame, guilt, regret, remorse. And she could not re-live either the beautiful feelings she had been harboring for him, only a distant, numbed ache remained in the place of them – and this latter felt even more like torture. Where had all the wonderful sensations attached to him gone?<br/> The first night was the worst: tossing and turning in self-reproach. Self-reproach for not being able to come to his rescue when he was mercilessly murdered by Death Eaters during a random anti-Muggle attack; and self-reproach for how she had shattered his life and dreams when she ran away, leaving him without the slightest clue and without hopes.</p><p align="justify">By the third sleepless night, she could gain some control over herself, and face the ultimate question which had been in the back of her mind from the first moment she read the notification: <em>What am I grieving</em>? She found herself resisting the question. Of course, she was grieving Dougal! A who, and not a what!<br/> A persistent little voice in her head however, started to ask all sorts of questions. <em>What am I grieving? </em><br/> <em>Who was Dougal for me? What am I vesting him with? What does he truly represent that died with him?</em><br/> ‘Stop!’ she spoke up in the darkness annoyed with herself. ‘This is insane. Lumos!’<br/> The warm light had a soothing effect on her. She intended to wait for the daybreak together with it, like she did last night and the night before that.<br/> For many, many years she indeed thought that Dougal McGregor symbolized the true and pure love she lost. The promise of happiness. But the dismantling, deconstructing whispering voice could not be hold back:<br/> <em>How long had you known each other? For barely two months? How long had you actually been in love with him before you said yes to him? Little over a month maybe? How many times did you kiss him? Twice, probably three times? Did you see him angered, did you know how he acted under pressure? No? Could have he really been your intellectual counterpart? Did you really mean to tie your life for good to somebody you just met at eighteen? Is not it something others call a teenage ‘crush’?</em><br/> <br/> Idealized maybe, crush-like for sure, but it felt like what she thought was love; she was flying with Dougal. They were unearthed, unchained. In conversations with him she was discovering depths of herself and untapped energies she had not known about. She enjoyed the Minerva she became with him. It was core-shaking, soul-touching, deep and… immature love. Immature love, it was she admitted reluctantly.<br/> They were never meant to be. She had known it from the beginning, but she did not care initially, sweeping all the shadows aside, since being with him started out merely as exceedingly pleasant pastime – until he proposed, because then it suddenly stopped being a light-hearted romance. Minerva wondered whether she carried that much remorse in case she would have left behind only a sweet, longing memory of a summer love with pleasant walks under the stars – and not a misled and devastated fiancé.<br/> But marriage and engagement equaled devotion to her, something to be taken seriously: it meant being bonded and destined for life, in her eyes. Caging, self-sacrificing by nature. How come then she agreed so hastily to jump into it?<br/> She let him emotionally too close, therefore making herself too vulnerable: she unintentionally handed over the control to him without either of them realizing it; she was not her own master anymore. And it could never happen again. Love is destructive if mishandled, so is marriage, she had concluded. Her boggart had been a wedding ceremony ever since; tying the knot.</p><p align="justify">But did it hurt when he married another woman and she, Minerva realized she was replaceable?<br/> Yes it did.<br/> And when she suspected that he might have hated her for what she had put him through? Or oh, that he might have been longing for her secretly?<br/> Yes… yes these did hurt back then. Oh Merlin, did they hurt! And do they now?<br/> <em>Do they hurt you now?</em> The little voice nudged. <em>Do they really?</em><br/> <em>No</em>.</p><p align="justify">She let it sink in for a minute.<br/> But then where did this love go? And when did it disappear in thin air? She was glaring into the flame at the tip of her wand. It had been definitely there when she was living in London. It had been around when she started her teaching career. And it had been in Madam Puddifoot’s Teashop with its full effect, when her former boss and her most fond and esteemed friend proposed her the possibility to live the rest of their life together in wed<em>lock</em>.<br/> She felt it’s lingering presence when she first let herself laugh wholeheartedly with Elphinstone – as a gentle reminder that she should not –, and years later in that Saturday morning when she woke up in his bed for the first time. But her ever-haunting love for Dougal started to wane with time – even if she tried to hold onto it desperately – up to the point that in the past couple years its sting reappeared only when a certain proposal came up.<br/> Truth is, she had long outgrown her <em>crash</em> on Dougal, she thought as she was laying back onto her bed sweating and shaking. And it somehow had caused her bad conscience, since the subconsciously imposed self-punishment for how she hurt him was about to disappear.<br/> How beautifully, how tragically had she imprisoned herself while trying to escape imprisonment!</p><p align="justify">However, after this long-due, but ever-dodged inner conversation she felt ready to walk out of her cage; the gates were wide open. She was half-dreaming already, drifting into blissful restorative sleep, but she clearly saw herself stepping out to the fresh air, feeling lighter than ever, more peaceful than ever. Dew was twinkling on the grass as the sun was rising, and a gentle rustling sound wrapped her around. The sound of burning parchment. The smoke of it blended subtly in the morning air.</p><p align="justify">And a pile of parchments was indeed burning in Minerva Mcgonagall’s fireplace a couple of hours later, despite the warm late-August weather. She felt liberation from the last remnants of her past with each and every parchment she tossed into the flames.<br/> By the time she finished, only gratitude remained in her heart for those two summer months of 1954. Nothing else.</p>
