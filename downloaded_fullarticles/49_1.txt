  <span>12 December 1994</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey Potter!  Nice shoes!” a voice came from across the hall.  At first, Harry wondered who the voice belonged to, but as soon as he heard the raucous laughter that followed the words, he knew.  He knew that it was none other than Draco Malfoy, his arch-nemesis and personal torture device. Hermione tried to pull him out of the way before anything more happened to him or any more people noticed what was happening.  No such luck. Malfoy was already swinging his arm over Harry’s shoulder in a way that made his stomach turn over with disgust.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did your mom buy that for you?  Oh sorry, I totally forgot, she’s dead!” Malfoy remarked with a thick layer of haughtiness in his voice, making a show scuffing dirt onto Harry’s previously brand new shoes.  Harry bristled, but realized that resistance was futile. He sighed, removed Malfoy’s arm from his shoulder, and attempted to walk to class, uncomfortably aware of the eyes of his peers on his back and the whispers as he and his friends passed.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Gossiping, loathsome gits,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry thought amusedly in an attempt to make himself feel better.  It sort of worked, but the momentary amusement vanished once Harry realized that he now had to face Potions with Severus Snape.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How perfect,” Harry muttered to himself.  He tried to focus on his professor because, despite their personal disagreements, Harry really wanted to pass Potions.  Alas, his mind was, as usual, preoccupied. His thoughts were almost never happy ones, but it was okay, he was used to that.  If he told himself that it was okay, he had at least a glimmer of hope that one day, it would be. One day, he wouldn’t just be the Boy Who Lived.  One day, he wouldn’t have to deal with Draco Malfoy ever again. He sighed, a little bit louder than intended, at the thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there something you would like to say, Potter?” Snape asked him with a withering look on his face.  From across the classroom, Malfoy snickered. Snape broke his eye contact with Harry to flash a warning look at Malfoy.  “Ten points from Gryffindor for Mr. Potter’s disruptive behavior”, Snape spit out, turning on his heels and billowing to the front of the classroom.  Harry put his head in his hands, annoyed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>15 December 1994</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey Harry, excited to go see your parents for Christmas?” Malfoy asked with a smirk.  Harry turned around to walk the other way, not really wanting to confront Malfoy at the moment.  No such luck, as Malfoy called after him, “I’m really sorry that you don’t have anyone who loves you.  Must be hard,” Harry could hear the sarcasm dripping in his voice. That was the last straw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy, I am going to spend my Christmas break with the Weasleys.  They love me more than your parents ever will, and I’m not even related to them!” Harry snarled, steam practically coming out of his ears.  Malfoy was clearly taken aback, but tried to shrug it off and walk away. Hermione and Ron looked at Harry, slightly in shock, but they quickly recovered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s go,” Harry said roughly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>26 June 2019</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco Malfoy hadn’t been sleeping too well the past few weeks.  Or maybe it was months; he wasn’t exactly sure. Something was bothering him, he knew, but he couldn’t quite put a finger on what it was.  He had narrowed it down that it probably was a result of some of his past actions. Regret had been terrible to Draco, and seeing the fading Dark Mark on his arm did nothing to help.  Sometimes, he wondered what his life would’ve been like, what he would be like, if he had different parents. Not that he wished for that, of course, but still. There was always a nagging voice in his head, always asking </span>
  <em>
    <span>what if…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Next to him, Astoria stirred, and Draco’s train of thought was interrupted.  He sighed, scratched his head, and rolled out of bed. He had no idea what time it was, although he suspected it was probably around 3 am.  He threw on a jacket and scarf, walked to the garage, and started his car. Initially, Astoria had objected to his purchase of his car, but she had eventually come around.  Draco knew that she cared about his happiness, but he also knew that she would never truly understand him, and more painfully, never truly love him. He sighed, opened the garage, and pulled out of the driveway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lately, Draco had found himself driving around in the middle of the night or the early morning.  He never had any specific destination, but rather, he enjoyed the opportunity to clear his head and not worry about crafting the perfect facade for the public.  Not that he would ever admit that, of course, but he knew it, and that was enough. Whenever Astoria asked him where he had been, he would carefully lie and say something like, “the car has been having issues lately, and I wanted to make note of what it sounded like,” or “we had an emergency meeting at work today, I only found out after you were asleep,” or anything else that sounded believable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco knew, deep down, that Astoria didn’t believe him, but he preferred not to think about that.  Lately, she had stopped asking, which, in a sad sort of way, made Draco grateful. Although it had never been said, they both knew that their relationship wasn’t meant to be more than platonic.  This made Draco feel worse. How could she be so good to him when he couldn’t return the favor? Was he even capable of being good to another person? His head was aching, and Draco felt a single tear slip down his cheek.  He stiffened immediately, the words of his father ringing in his ears. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Malfoys don’t cry.</span>
  </em>
  <span>  Three words, three words that felt like a knife twisting in the wound.  Draco choked a little, and despite his best efforts, the tears escaped. Suddenly, alarmingly, he realized that he had been driving for over two hours.  He had to be at least 120 km from Malfoy Manor. He also had the realization that it was pouring rain, and his vision was blurred through tears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco scolded himself for not paying attention beforehand.  He moved his hand to turn on his wipers, and with a sinking feeling, realized that they were broken.  He didn’t have much time to realize he was on the wrong side of the road before the lights of an old, beat up station wagon blinded him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, all was dark and quiet.  Draco felt comfortable, content, and the most relaxed he’d ever felt in his life.  He was rather annoyed when he felt someone pulling on him and heard shouting of his name.  As Draco came to, he realized where he was. Somehow, he was now laying down on the sidewalk, soaked to the bone, with none other than Harry Potter shielding him from the rain.  Harry was breathing hard, clearly shaken by whatever had just happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay?” he asked, fear evident in his voice.  Draco suddenly felt an overwhelming wave of amusement come over him, and all he could do was laugh.  He laughed harder and for longer than he probably ever had, and Harry looked startled. Once Draco composed himself again, Harry swallowed and opened his mouth to speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you feeling okay enough for me to Apparate us to St. Mungo’s?” Harry asked.  Draco, suddenly aware of the searing pain running through his body, croaked out a strangled noise of affirmation.  The next thing he knew, he was in the clean, bright, white of a hospital room, with bandages all over. Startled by the seemingly sudden change of scenery, Draco darted his eyes around the room, taking in his surroundings.  He had yet another startled moment when he realized that Potter himself was snoring in a chair next to his bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here,” Draco snapped, or at least tried to.  His voice came out cracked and weaker than he expected, which only annoyed him further.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter woke with a start.  “After the car accident, I brought you here, and er- I don’t really know why I’m still here,” he mumbled.  “I’ll see myself out now,” he said timidly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait- I have some questions still,” Draco said as Potter stood up to leave.  “What happened last night?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter sighed.  “I was out driving, and suddenly, your headlights were in my face.  I swerved to the other lane, but you didn’t. You crashed into a wall,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco took a moment to process this information, his head hurting with the sudden use.  He chose his next words carefully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why did you stay here?” he asked calmly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To make sure you were okay,” Potter said matter-of-factly.  Draco sighed and closed his eyes again. He had a lot to think about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks,” he said finally.  “I think I’m going to sleep now,” he added.  Potter nodded slowly and stood to leave. This time, Draco didn’t stop him.  It was only once he was on the edge of sleep that he realized that he hadn’t once thought of Astoria since the accident.</span>
