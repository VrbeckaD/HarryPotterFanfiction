    <p>Potter,</p><p>It was good of you to come to the closing performance last week. Pansy hadn’t told me that she and Weasley had invited you so I hope you’ll forgive my initial shock when I saw you backstage after the final curtain. I also want to apologize if that headline in <em>The Prophet</em> went a step too far, I’ve already had my solicitor send them an owl addressing it. You shouldn’t be harangued for attending an event with friends with assumptions and claims such as those. </p><p>I know you’ve had your fair share of headlines written about you—as have I—and I don’t mean to presume to know how you feel; but if we feel the same about it then you are just as tired as I am with it all. The fact that I can’t have tea with a friend or meet for lunch to discuss a new project without being romantically linked to the individual I’m with is utterly exhausting. Lately it feels as though if I breathe too near someone the press thinks we’re shagging. If I’m being really honest, the worst thing is how utterly and completely wrong they have it. It's been such a long time since my last attempt at dating, and I’m extremely reluctant to drag someone else into this circus <strike>that I’m fairly certain my cock is going to shrivel from disuse. </strike></p><p>I must admit that my purpose in writing this letter was two-fold. If, you are as fed up as I think you are, then there is every possibility that you may be amenable to an arrangement that may allow us both to control the narrative while engaging in a bit of journalistic misdirection. Especially since I know how much you loathe Rita Skeeter and I think that being able to get one over on her would be excellent fun. </p><p>So my proposition is this: come with me to the Gala next weekend. It's the biggest event of the year and I’m supposed to be meeting with a new director while there. It won’t do for me to go alone and having you on my arm may benefit us both. We let the press think we’re dating and all the scrutiny in the press will fall on us when we’re together. That means no more speculations over lunch meetings or outings with friends and it means we can both quietly attempt to date without the papers blowing things up before they’ve had a proper chance to start.</p><p>If you’re amenable to this idea then please owl me back quickly as there will be much to prepare before the Gala. If you’re not, well, then let's blame this silly idea on the bottle of Ogden’s I’ve been sampling and pretend I never made it. <strike>I do hope you are amenable.</strike></p><p>Yours,</p><p>Draco</p>
