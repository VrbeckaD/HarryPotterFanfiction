(^^)</p><p>"My name is Albus," he said, hoping that by leaving off his surname that he could avoid a bit of the notoriety that seemed to come along with being Harry Potter's son. The blond boy sighed heavily before raising his eyes from his book. His expression was way too tired to be on any eleven-year-old's face.</p><p>"Let me guess," he drawled as he placed a finger between the pages to keep his spot. "Your parents were on the 'light' side of the war."</p><p>"Well, yeah," Albus replied. He had never really seen any issue with that. "What's wrong with that?"</p><p>"Nothing with that directly," the boy said. "It's more about the unfortunate name your parents have saddled you with. Albus Dumbledore was, from an objective standpoint, just as bad as the Dark Lord. The key difference being that Dumbledore did his misdeeds within the Wizengamot. Did you know that he helped create the Werewolf Registry? He was one of its key supporters, too. My mother actually threw a gala in celebration when Minister Granger got that law overturned and the Registry destroyed."</p><p>"Uh, okay," Albus said, feeling at a loss for what to say that wouldn't give away that <em>Minister Granger</em> was his Aunt Hermione. "Well, my middle name is Severus..."</p><p>"Please tell me you're joking," the boy begged.</p><p>"Er..."</p><p>"And I thought <em>Scorpius</em> was bad." The boy rubbed his face with his free hand, the same way that Albus' father did when he was trying to think before saying something that might set off people's tempers. Then he sighed again, clearly deciding to just say whatever it was. "Do your parents hate you or something?"</p><p>"Well, I didn't think so when I boarded the train today," Albus quipped, startling a chuckle out of Scorpius. He had the feeling it was the start of a marvelous friendship.</p></div>
