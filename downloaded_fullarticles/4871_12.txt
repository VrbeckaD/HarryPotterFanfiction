    <p align="left">“You are by far the worst patient I have ever had.” Hermione grumbled looking down at the paler than usual young man lying in bed. She’d laid a cool wash cloth on his forehead which he promptly flicked off like it had personally offended him.</p>
<p>“That’s a very mean thing to say to a sick person.” Draco muttered delirious with fever. Hermione rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t be sick if you had just done what I told you to do in the first place.” She replied picking the wash cloth up off the floor.</p>

<p>“Our marriage bond says other wise you insufferable git.” She hoped the infatuated smile didn’t take too much away from her annoyance.</p>
