    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Harry was sitting with everyone in the Great Hall, waiting excitedly for the Goblet of Fire to spit out the names of the champions. Almost simultaneously with the release of the fourth name his eyes rolled into the back of his head and his body locked into a stone-like rigidity. By the time his name was called and Hermione glanced over speak to him he was slumped over his plate. Her scream pierced the air and brought most of the staff running.</p>
<p>Harry's sable hair was leaching into a black with a red sheen as tears of blood leaked from the corners of his eyes. Madam Pomfrey and Professor Snape quickly forced everyone back so that they would have room to work. A shuddering breath came from their patient just before his emerald eyes slowly opened.</p>
<p>"Professor Snape? Poppy? But you're both dead," Harry said in a very confused voice.</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of this Dumblydoor?!" Madam Maxine demanded, her voice a mixture of anger and fear.</p>
<p>"If Hermione is here I need to know what year it is and what day it is. I think I've pulled a Doctor Who," Harry said in a slightly raised voice that carried half way across the hall. He made no effort to get up and interrupt Snape's incredulous examination.</p>
<p>"October 31st, 1994," Hermione responded, her voice trembling in shock as she recognized the reference. "Your name just came out of the goblet and it looked like you were having a seizure."</p>
<p>"So the moment I was declared an adult and my body is 14 again.... great. Moody, fuck you for putting my name in the damn goblet and find a different ritual. The one you and your... friend have planed for after the third task robs the great idiot of his sanity. If you need something from me I'll help you get him back to normal so no <i>blood of the enemy forcibly taken</i> crap. Next time you talk to him tell him that my scar is the same as Nagini, the stupid locket, the ring, and the tiara. He'll know what I mean. Oh, and I'm claiming Snape since my mother transferred his boon or whatever it is to me that night," Harry instructed wearily. "I'm gonna pass out now. Hermione, get the twins and Luna Lovegood... Ron's gonna be a git about all of this."</p>
<p>True to his word he was out cold before anyone could move.</p>
<p>Chaos erupted around him as questions were asked, some in panic, some in serious concern. In the confusion a dumbfounded polyjuiced Mad-eye Moody shared a shocked look with Professor Snape as knowledge was instantly passed between them. A silent agreement formed between the two spies as they quickly bundled Harry out of the room, using the confusion as cover, and into Severus' quarters, the false Mad-eye taking up the rear. Once in the potion master's quarters he was quickly laid out on the man's bed and stripped of all but his underwear.</p>
<p>"The stupid eye is showing a glamour," Moody pointed out gruffly. Severus scowled and uncaringly stripped the magic away, both of them gasped at the scars and half healed damage on the small body.</p>
<p>"I thought he was a spoiled brat," Severus said in strangled voice as he headed for the healing potions in his storage cupboard.</p>
<p>"That's what Dumbledore tells everyone," Moody agreed in clear disgust, disgust aimed at a man who would allow so much damage to be inflicted on a child.</p>
<p>By the time Severus got back with the potions it was nearly time for Moody to take another polyjuice dose.</p>
<p>"Since he's blown my cover mind locking down your rooms? I can blame his accusation on disorientation or confusion to anyone else but I know you won't believe that. I'd really like to walk around in my own skin for a while and we have to get the brat put back together before either of us can get answers," Moody suggested dubiously.</p>
<p>In response Severus hit a recessed rune near the top of his bed, tripping a second set of wards around his bedroom. Moody grunted in both satisfaction and amusement before hobbling over to a nearby chair, removing the peg leg and magical eye he relaxed into the return transformation. A small sound of surprise from Snape had his <i>two</i> eyes snapping back open and examining the room.</p>
<p>"Barty?" Snape asked warily.</p>
<p>"I know, I'm supposed to be dead. Mother took my place and my sperm donor has been keeping me trapped under invisibility cloaks and the Imperious curse ever since I recovered enough to be mobile. I got free at the World Cup," Barty Jr. explained with a grin and luxurious stretch now that his body was once more his own.</p>
<p>Severus nodded and they proceeded to work together to heal the battered body of one Harry Potter. Less than an hour later they sat back and watched a mostly healed Potter breathing in and out. Before they could exchange another word there was a knock on the door of the room. A startled look was exchanged as the door opened to admit four hurrying students, the same four Harry had spoken of before falling unconscious.</p>
<p>"Cor, what happened to Harrykins?!" the twins exclaimed in shock, hurrying over to check on Harry. Luna and Hermione hovered near the door, glancing between Harry and the two adults.</p>
<p>"Hello Professors," Luna greeted genially as she carefully steered Hermione over to stand next to the bed and the dramatically concerned twins.</p>
<p>"How...." Barty asked in befuddlement.</p>
<p>"No idea," Severus answered absently as he both eyed the students while checking the wards. To his great astonishment one of them had entered the correct sequence to give them safe entry without disabling his special bedroom wards.</p>
<p>"They will still keep everyone out and I made the others look away while I made the wards safe Professor," Luna informed him airily, answering his unspoken question. Barty laughed hard enough that his answer to Snape's glare was a choked "Seer" before collapsing into a laughter induced coughing fit. Luna smiled indulgently at the man as Harry finally gave a groan, indicating he was waking up.</p>
<p>"What did you do this time little brother?" Fred asked half jokingly.</p>
<p>"Time traveled from a battered 150 year old body back into my 14 year old one," Harry answered groggily.</p>
<p>George spoke for all of them when he let out a succinct "Fuck!" Harry grunted his agreement before forcing his eyes properly open and glancing around at his audience.</p>
<p>"Professor Dumbledore is still planning your death and your return wasn't exactly subtle. I believe you are still required to participate in the tournament but you will probably have to ask to be certain. Sirius... will have to be committed to either Azkaban or St. Mungoes, the Dementors took too much from him during his time in Azkaban and he will only ever see you as James reborn. Remus is aware of the bribes and the mistreatment but currently sees Dumbledore as his alpha. You were kept away from him for too long as was proven at the end of last year when he nearly ate you and Hermione. If he still saw you as his cub Moony would not have been able to threaten you. You can demand a resort at any time and can demand access to anything that is within the rights of an adult or Triwizard Champion," Luna informed him, amusement dancing around her mouth and throughout her voice.</p>
<p>Harry took a few moments to process what she had said before telling them all his idea. "Right... plan is to say it was a prank gone wrong meant for after the name drawing. I will naturally protest that I didn't put my name in but my little tantrum about Barty putting it in instead is going to need covering. Thank god I had the sense to keep calling him Moody. I'm not backing down on my claim over Snape and we can blame that on Sirius slipping and saying he owed James a life debt. I'll invoke the damn thing if I have to to keep him so you lot keep that in mind. Ron... is going to be useless with jealousy this year and I'm not sure I want to rekindle the friendship after his tanty is done. I'll need help watching for love potions and the like. If I start acting like I fancy any girl knock me out with something and get me purged. I may be Bisexual but right now just about everyone at the school except for the teachers count as a child. I won't sleep with children. Before either of you terrors ask, no you don't quite count as children but I'm still not sleeping with you." This easily shut down the obvious interest from Fred and George as soon as he saw the idea dawning on their faces. Luna giggled at their identical pouts and patted them consolingly.</p>
<p>"I don't mind being blamed for helping with a prank. I can use the CONSTANT VIGILANCE act and call it prep for unexpected situations. They'll just put it down to Moody's paranoia. We might need to kill off my father and Karkaroff at some point. Oh! Can I reclaim Winky? I always rather liked her," Barty asked sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Call her, she ought to be here by now. Just make sure she understands that neither your father nor Dumbledore can know about any of this and to call you Moody," Harry suggested, realizing immediately that they were looking to him for both direction and information. He wryly blamed his own loose tongue for practically giving the game away as soon as he realized when and where he had landed.</p>
<p>"What am I doing? I gather that the twins are going to be partly blamed for tonight's ruckus and you might use them to isolate people for talks," Hermione asked in a combination of wariness and eagerness that had Harry glancing at her fondly.</p>
<p>"You will be helping research a bunch of different stuff and helping me revise for school this year. I have to be the very public bait and if we're smart about it we can get Rita to claim I've got two girlfriends, you and Luna. In point of fact you're both only friends and helping me to survive the tournament because Dumbledore doesn't care if I survive or not. We get to start mentioning how much danger the school has been put in because of Dumbledore's choices and his damn attempts to test me. Snape can even decline to comment on things while getting caught muttering about Dumbledore threatening him with Azkaban if he doesn't dance to the goat's tune," Harry mused, his thoughts running wild as he plotted the best way to keep his precious people safe.</p>
<p>"My lord is going to ask what the catch is," Barty pointed out seriously.</p>
<p>"He's going to want me alive until we get a chance to work some things out. By publicly claiming Snape they can't toss him in Azkaban without a damn good reason. I won't force him to do anything but I can shield him from certain political machinations until he can decide what he want's to do. His oaths about me and your master aren't in as much conflict as he believes and I'm going to need a chance to remember the details before I can explain it all. As for the catch... I want to save as many lives as possible and renew our traditions but to make that work he has to be sane and we probably have to take out Dumbledore. As far as the old man is concerned I'm a disposable weapon, especially if it will get your master out of the way," Harry answered seriously. "My best position right now is among the students and most of them need better defense training. I'm considering starting up a defense club or something like what we'll need again next year if Umbridge is the defense teacher.... vicious bitch that she is. Dumbledore.... throwing him off and making it look like I'm still his golden puppet might be a bit on the tricky side with my personality change due to maturity. Think we can blame that on an experimental prank gone bad?"</p>
<p>"If I insisted that we use an experimental brew... possibly. Or someone could have contaminated it during the brewing process because they were interrupted," Barty agreed thoughtfully, really getting into it.</p>
<p>"We can do that," the twins agreed eagerly.</p>
<p>"Our brothers sometimes interrupt us," George offered with a grin.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't take much for something extra to have accidentally gotten into the potion because we have to hide it from mum half the time," Fred agreed mischievously.</p>
<p>"If you do any extra brewing this year it will be under my supervision and you will be giving me the antidotes," Severus insisted sternly.</p>
<p>"You won't stop us?" Fred asked shrewdly.</p>
<p>"Why should I care as long as it isn't used in my classroom and my snakes aren't the only targets," Snape countered smugly. That earned wide grins all around.</p>
<p>"Dumbledore's coming. We have just enough time for Mr. Crouch to become Professor Moody again," Luna said with a hum of contentment. She was glad she finally had real friends.</p>
<p>Barty hastily sat back down and swallowed a dose of potion while Severus chivied the students to the far side of the bed so that Harry was easily visible with his healing wounds on full display. The extra wards on the bedroom were turned off not a moment too soon as the main door to the dour man's quarters opened, letting in the noisy discussion of the tournament officials and the three school Heads. Barty slipped his eye and peg leg back into place with a soft grunt as the last of the changes settled into place, leaving him once more as Mad-eye Moody.</p>
<p>"Severus?" Dumbledore called out from the living room.</p>
<p>"In the bedroom," Severus shot back sourly as he positioned himself at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>The thick oak door easily swung open on slightly creaky hinges, just the way the man liked it, revealing a bevy of officials and the three school Heads.</p>
<p>"Severus, why in the world did you whisk Mr. Potter away," Dumbledore chided, amusement lacing his voice that was chilled to dangerous temperatures by the look in the old man's eye.</p>
<p>"The boy simply had a bad reaction to the experimental prank that I took off the red twins over there," Moody waved away grandly. "It was perfectly timed as a test of the medical reactions at this school. <i>CONSTANT VIGILANCE!!!</i> You know perfectly well that it would be incredibly easy to get in and poison one of the students, Albus. Of course I wasn't planning for it to happen <i>during</i> the name drawing, nor for Potter's name to actually come out," Moody said gruffly.</p>
<p>"You... planned this?" Albus asked uncertainly, the frigidity fading from his gaze.</p>
<p>"Potter agreed to the idea in exchange for extra tutoring in survival that <i>you</i> have been refusing him. Good god man, he's got how many Dark Wizards out for his blood? Then when we got him here for treatment we find him covered in glamours and sporting ridiculous wounds! Senior Aurors don't have that many scars! What have you been doing to the boy that we needed to pour blood replenishers down his throat?!" Moody demanded indignantly.</p>
<p>"And Mr. Potter's earlier comment about you placing his name in the goblet?" Crouch demanded angrily.</p>
<p>"Modified Code for <i>get me out of here</i>. Brat's got a good head on his shoulders and was smart enough to let us treat him before trying to escape," Moody said with a harsh laugh. "The only problem with that turned out to be his <i>other</i> injuries."</p>
<p>"I said I was sorry. No one ever tries to help except if I get hurt here during Quidditch or some insane person tries to kill me again," Harry said sulkily. "I usually snag potions from the hospital wing during the first week but I couldn't this time so they've been healing on their own. I've asked not to go back every year."</p>
<p>These answers had accusing eyes immediately aimed at the old goat.</p>
<p>"I'm sure its just an exaggeration," Dumbledore said calmly, inwardly fuming at Harry's inability to keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>"You can trust Potter's words, one of the healing potions mixed with an ingredient in the prank creates a mild truth serum effect," Severus said dryly. "I doubt he's even aware of what he's saying at the moment."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Aunt Petunia but I didn't break it. Dudley did it so that he could watch Uncle Vernon beat me again," Harry said, rolling his head as if he was so doped up that he couldn't hold it steady.</p>
<p>"Pet... you placed him with <i>Petunia</i>?! You <i>know</i> the spiteful bitch hates magic! She made mine and Lily's life a living hell growing up!" Severus spat, visibly restraining himself from physically attacking the old man.</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked at the potion master's fury filled gaze before taking an unconscious step back. Luna calmly wrapped her arms around his waist, encouraging the others to do the same. This weighed the man down and kept him from lunging for Dumbledore's throat.</p>
<p>"Severus? Are you keeping Mr. Potter and his friends for the night?" Professor McGonagall asked, white faced and thin lipped.</p>
<p>"If you don't mind. I think that Potter needs to stay under observation and the presence of his friends may help him be more coherent at a later time. I will not allow the two youngest Weasleys to be present because of their inability to keep their hands to themselves and remain quiet. The twin menaces I can at least bribe into being quiet and giving me their antidotes," Severus answered her in a low voice of barely suppressed rage.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about them too much Minerva. I'll stay down here with them to make certain they aren't turned into potion ingredients. It is my fault that the boy is in this position in the first place," Moody admitted almost sheepishly. "I can also keep him from trying to kill Albus for the moment."</p>
<p>"Thank you Alastor. I'll have the elves send along night things for the five of them while I have a <i>talk</i> with Albus," Minerva said with an angry growl aimed at the now shivering Headmaster. "If you two wouldn't mind I think that Mr. Potter might like a trip off of the grounds in the morning, perhaps a trip to Diagon Alley? I will of course excuse his four friends to go with him."</p>
<p>"Only these four," Moody cautioned. "I don't know what any of the other students might try. At least these twins can take the younger three and run if it comes to it. They're tricky enough that they probably would get them away on top of it all."</p>
<p>"Agreed," Minerva said without batting an eyelash before turning on Dumbledore with a shark-like grin. "Albus, I'd like a word with you."</p>
<p>"I.. that is... I must be going!" Dumbledore stammered before making a quick exit, the entire group following on his heels howling for clarification. Severus waited a moment before putting the bedroom wards back up.</p>
<p>"They're gone Harry," Luna said with blatant amusement as the four of them cautiously released the potions master.</p>
<p>"Oh, good. Rolling my head like that made me a bit dizzy," Harry admitted, fighting back a yawn.</p>
<p>"What you said about 'Tuny..." Severus trailed off expectantly.</p>
<p>"True, as was the comment about asking not to go back. Thankfully, most of the time I was simply ignored and had to find my own food. Heaven forbid I touch anything meant for her precious Duddikins. The chores were a bit of a problem getting them done daily when I hadn't eaten in a while or managed to get my hands on water after a day or two," Harry said with a casual shrug. He was reconciled with all of it, having more than a hundred years worth of memories to distance himself from the mistreatment. A yawn was the only warning he got before slipping into an exhausted sleep.</p>
