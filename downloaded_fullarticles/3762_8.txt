  <em>To my love, Hermione Jean Granger,</em>
</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>
  <em>Please forgive me, do not expect me to arrive home tonight.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>I have realised that even though I will forever love you to the moon and back, I cannot be your everything. I cannot provide you with the happiness we both wish for.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Know that you are the final piece to my puzzle, and it is you whom I shall cherish always, even when the rest of me falls apart.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Please do not go looking for my light at night; I am a broken lamp.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>I cannot give you smiles, even when you have constantly provided yours for both of us.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>I want to kiss you, and hold you tight; I want to keep you within my arms.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>But even then you are unsafe.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Please move on from me, and do not hold back.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Even when you do not want to let go.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>I cannot be the shoulder for you to cry on, or the one who listens to your stories.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>I want to promise you the world, but even the world is not on our side this time.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Don't let my leaving scar you. Please let it heal you instead, for I have broken you so many times.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>My request is for you to take a worthy man's hand in marriage: one who will be there to witness and love your bright personality, charming intellect, and radiant beauty.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Take someone who isn't cowardly like I am; I'm weak, I'm afraid, and I run away from my problems as a solution.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Hermione, you are my dearest, and though I will never bring myself to forget you, please forget me. Sever all ties with me.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>I wish you the best in life, even though you are my best moment, whom I shall never be able to grasp anymore.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>I love you, and au revoir.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Sincerely Yours, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Draco Malfoy</em>
