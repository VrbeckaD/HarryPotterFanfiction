    <p><em>Ah, another Weasley, </em>the Sorting Hat whispers as it plops onto his head. <em>I can always tell</em>.</p>
<p>Fred grins. <em>That’s me.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Look at your mind. You’ve got a noble heart, and a thirst for knowledge, and your loyalty knows no bounds. You’re talented, creative, and clever. You have passion, drive, the likes of which I seldom see. You could become great, one of the greatest wizards of your time.</em>
</p>
<p>Fred sticks his tongue out and bites it between his teeth, tilting his head from one side to another. <em>I know</em>, he says.</p>
<p>
  <em>You have an option here. There are two houses which you might do well in – you’ll find friends in both places, and you’ll grow in talent and abilities in either, but I think you’ll find somewhat different values in them. Do you have any preferences for house choice?</em>
</p>
<p>Fred grins even wider, confident. <em>I want you to send me where I can become the greatest joke inventor of all time</em>, he says. </p>
<p><em>Excellent choice, </em>says the hat, and then the rim is ripping wide open. Fred doesn’t even wait for the roar before standing up and heading towards the red table.</p>
<p>“SLYTHERIN!” the hat screams.</p>
<p>Despite the size of the Great Hall, the sheer number of people in it, somehow it goes silent. He glances over towards the table where everyone is clad in green. They watch him with blank expressions, mouths in tight lines. Fred can even see some of them muttering. Probably <em>A Weasley? A blood traitor? In </em>our <em>house?</em> They aren’t clapping for him. None of them.</p>
<p>He wrenches his head to the opposite end of the hall, and there are his brothers, Charlie and Percy. Their eyes are wide, their jaws slack, mimicking each other perfectly. Beside them are a pair of empty seats, because of <em>course </em>he and George were going to be Gryffindors.</p>
<p>George. He whirls around to lock eyes with his twin.</p>
<p>Their expressions must mirror each other, he thinks, because his sees his twin’s eyes widened in fear and his mouth slightly open in a soundless question, the same as his own. And then George closes his mouth, and shuts his eyes, grimacing as he turns away. His twin is the last one standing in the line, and Fred flinches at the rejection.</p>
<p>Then a single clap echoes through the hall. Fred looks back to the Slytherin table, where a boy prefect is standing in his seat, his face impassive, as he puts his hands together. Next to him, a girl prefect leans out and grins, joining in with her own enthusiastic clapping. She elbows the girl sitting next to her, and then she starts clapping, too. Unfortunately, it doesn’t catch on. The awkward trio of claps echoes weirdly in the huge hall.</p>
<p>Fred drags the Sorting Hat off of his head and drops it onto the stool before making his way across the Great Hall to the table of students still glaring at him. The girl prefect lets out a whoop, but only succeeds in causing a single other first-year to start clapping. Fred ends up sitting next to him, because he might as well. He’s grateful when the lukewarm applause dies out.</p>
<p>He doesn’t turn to watch when McGonagall calls out, “Weasley, George,” because he <em>knows </em>where his twin will go. Sure enough, it’s not two seconds later that the Sorting Hat shouts “GRYFFINDOR!”</p>
<p>The applause from the Gryffindor table is immediate and loud and Fred sinks down further into his seat when hears it.</p>
<p>Dumbledore steps up and gives a tiny little speech, and then the feasting begins, but Fred doesn’t hear him, can’t stop looking at his empty plate and thinking <em>I’m a Slytherin, I’m a Slytherin, I’m a bloody Slytherin</em>.</p>
<p>The boy sitting next to him – the one who had clapped at the end – pokes him in the ribs. “Hey, mate,” he says. “Tough luck, there. I hear it’s hard when a family’s all been in one house.”</p>
<p>Fred continues to stare down at the empty plate. “They’re going to kill me,” he says. “I’m a bloody Slytherin.” The curse slips out and he doesn't care.</p>
<p>“Hey, watch the tone,” the boy says. “I’m a Slytherin, so we can’t all be that bad.”</p>
<p>Fred finally look over at him. “And who are you?” he says.</p>
<p>“Adrian Pucey,” the boy answers, sticking his hand out.</p>
<p>Fred wonders at what it means to take a handshake from a Slytherin, and then shrugs. “Fred Weasley,” he says, taking the hand.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I kinda put two and two together,” Pucey says, grinning. “Nice to meet you, Fred.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” says Fred, unsure whether saying “likewise” would be too much of a lie for even him to stomach.</p>
<p>“Are you gonna eat anything?” says Pucey, looking down at Fred’s empty plate. “I mean, come on, it’s feast night! Your first night at Hogwarts! You should be celebrating.”</p>
<p>Fred tries to look back to the Gryffindor table, but he can’t see his brothers’ faces in the sea of bobbing heads.</p>
<p>“Hey,” says Pucey. “Food. Eat. Do you like dumplings? How about lamb curry?”</p>
<p>Fred allows Pucey to pile his plate with food, tuning out the sound of his blabbering. He takes a fork, sticks it into a heap of mashed potatoes, and heaves it to his mouth. The buttery flavor and smooth texture are better than what his mom scrapes by at home, but Fred just chews and swallows, putting another forkful into his mouth when the first bite is finished.</p>
<p>He’s a bloody fucking <em>Slytherin</em>.</p>
<p>Despite Pucey’s best efforts, Fred doesn’t end up eating much. He doesn’t even eat any dessert, which Pucey declares is a crying shame immediately before stealing Fred’s helping off of his plate.</p>
<p>When Fred glares at him, Pucey just shrugs. “Can’t let good treacle tart go to waste,” he says, sticking the spoon in his mouth.</p>
<p>With his cheeks puffed out from treacle and a smeared spoon sticking halfway out of his mouth, it’s hard for Fred to believe that Pucey is really an evil pureblood Slytherin. He just looks like an eleven-year-old kid really, <em>really </em>enjoying his dessert.</p>
<p>“Careful,” Fred says before he’s even realized he’s spoken. “Stick that spoon any further in, and you’ll choke.”</p>
<p>Pucey pulls the spoon out with a pop and sighs dreamily. “Ah, but what a way to go,” he says.</p>
<p>Fred decides a kid who will joke about dying from choking on treacle can’t be wholly evil. Maybe it’s just the house that ends up corrupting them. In that case, he’s going to have to be extra vigilant. Not that he wasn’t planning on being vigilant already, because all he can wonder is why was <em>he </em>put in the slimy snake house?</p>
<p>There has to be something <em>wrong </em>with him. None of his brothers are Slytherins.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Pucey says, poking him in the side. “C’mon, it’s time to go to the dorms.”</p>
<p>Fred thinks of Gryffindor Tower, the portrait that Bill and Charlie and Percy had painstakingly painted for him and George with their words, the warm fire, the plush rug, the ability to stick your head out the window and feel the wind rushing past. He’s not going there, not tonight. He might not ever even get to visit. His brothers probably hate him.</p>
<p>The two prefects who’d started clapping for him are rounding up all the other first years, so he and Pucey gather together with the rest of them (what do you call a group of Slytherins? A gaggle? A slithering? A murder?) and follow obediently. The first sinking feeling Fred gets is when he realizes that they are going <em>down </em>a lot more than they are going up.</p>
<p>All Fred can think about, when they finally reach the Slytherin dorms, is that they’re basically in a dungeon, and it’s perfectly appropriate. He’s imprisoned down here, with the Slytherins and Death Eaters.</p>
<p>Pucey wrinkles his nose. “Really?” he whines. “We live <em>here</em>?”</p>
<p>The girl prefect smiles at him. “Oh, just you wait til you get inside,” she says. “I think you’ll find it better than you expect.”</p>
<p>She turns to the blank wall and says, “<em>A posse ad esse</em>.”</p>
<p>Fred’s feet sink into the plush green rug as he steps into the Common Room. The fire glowing on the hearth and the green glass lanterns send flickers of light against the jade-colored walls, which in turn send a million reflections twinkling into the room. Huge puffy green couches and chairs are scattered about somewhat haphazardly, crowded around mahogany coffee tables. Slytherins have already filled the room, their ties and scarves glittering green. Everything is edged with silver, and from a small window above the moonlight filters through the clear water of the lake.</p>
<p>It’s not just magical, it’s like walking into a fairy tale. The room is <em>gorgeous</em>.</p>
<p>“Whoa,” he and Pucey say at the exact same time, and Fred can’t help but turn and grin at him, because for an instant, he thought it was George. Who but his twin would say the same thing at the same time as him?</p>
<p>When looks into Pucey’s grinning face, though, he remembers where he is and why. Fred lets the smile drop and turns away.</p>
<p>The girl prefect – Fred thinks her name is Something-or-Other Lefevre - is standing in what might be considered the center of the room, although with the willy-nilly placement of chairs, it’s difficult to say for sure that’s the center. She claps her hands together once and addresses them. “All right. All you first years are in the third floor down from here, girls on the right, boys on the left. Your luggage has been moved in already, let me know if anything went missing. If you feel you’ve been placed in the wrong room due to your gender identity, or that you require a room of your own for any reason, please contact either me, my fellow prefect Edgar Ballantine, or our Head of House, Professor Snape.”</p>
<p>Then she pauses and gives them a concerned, almost conspiratorial look when she speaks again. “Seriously though, if you need special accommodations, try me or Eddie first. Slytherin House looks out for its own, but some Slytherins look out more than others.” Fred hears a quiet snicker from one of the older Slytherins still hanging around the common room.</p>
<p>She grins brightly. “All right. It’s late, you should probably get some rest. You’ll get your schedules tomorrow morning, they’ll be on your nightstands when you wake up. Don’t lose them, they’ll save your life later on in the week.”</p>
<p>As she walks by, she pats Fred on the shoulder. “Just remember guys, if you need anything, anything at all, don’t hesitate to ask me or Eddie. It’s what we’re here for.”</p>
<p>Fred collapses onto his bed, trying to ignore the green hangings around the four-poster or the duvet that proudly bears the insignia of Slytherin House. The other boys are getting ready, too, and by some stroke of fate his and Pucey’s beds are right next to each other. He lies there and listens to the others breathing for a long moment.</p>
<p>None of them have George’s peaceful, nearly silent cadence of inhale-hold a second-exhale, inhale-hold a second-exhale.</p>
<p>Fred curls up, buries his head in his pillow, and cries.</p>
