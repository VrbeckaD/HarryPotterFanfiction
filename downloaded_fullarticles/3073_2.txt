          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry was an idiot. There was no other explanation for why he was standing on a doorstep in the middle of the night, waiting for his former arch nemesis turned reluctant acquaintance turned amicable coworker turned friend with benefits to open.</p>
<p>“Harry?” a sleep mussed Draco said as he opened the door. “What are you doing here? Didn’t you get home from your undercover mission this very day?”</p>
<p>Harry shuffled his feet.</p>
<p>”Yeah. Yeah I did.”</p>
<p>”So shouldn’t you be at home getting cleaned up? Merlin knows you need it, those clothes look like they could stand on their own.”</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath, forcing himself to look straight into Draco’s eyes.</p>
<p>”I missed you.”</p>
<p>“What?” Draco breathed.</p>
<p>“I missed you. I think I might be in love with you.”</p>
<p>Harry braced himself, waiting for Draco to laugh. But instead his face softened in a shy smile.</p>
<p>”Come on, let’s get you in the shower.”</p>
<p>”So you can get me dirty again after?” Harry asked hopefully.</p>
<p>Draco’s smile turned wicked.</p>
<p>”Who says I want to wait ’til after?”</p></div>
