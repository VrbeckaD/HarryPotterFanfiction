    <p>    Harry had learned that the Dursleys would never contact him. He knew that they would never even bother to learn how to owl, considering how they felt about Hedwig. Even so, he could not help but think that maybe, just maybe, his family would reach out to him. Despite his distaste for them, he desperately wanted somewhere to go. He felt like even more of an outsider with his friends away seeing their families. He tugged at the too-short sleeves of his scarlet, H-emblazoned sweater. The selfish part of him wanted to go to the Burrow, to have Mrs. Weasley make him another sweater. The reasonable part of him knew they were grieving.</p><p>    So now he sat, near the end of Gryffindor table. He was alone in the refurbished Great Hall, and the half empty mug of cider his frigid fingers were wrapped around was gradually losing its warmth. If he had any friends before the war, they’d be distant now. The only people at the long, oaken table were a group of boisterous, burly first year boys and a gaggle of third year girls, shrieking with laughter. There was nobody here anymore, it seemed. At least, around half of Harry's year had opted out of the eighth year. He only lingered because the thought of facing the world alone terrified him. Harry was already considering finding a way to get to Grimmauld Place. There was nothing there for him now, but he wanted to be anywhere but here. He had just made up his mind to leave when he was yanked form his runaway train of thought by an unmistakable voice. Cold, sharp, curt, and with a built-in sneer.</p><p>    "Still alone for the holidays, are we, Potter?" The worn wool of Harry's sweater had suddenly become infuriatingly hot, and he could feel beads of sweat trickle down the back of his neck like wax dripped from the floating candles above his head. Much to his chagrin, he flushed redder than the Gryffindor banners on the walls. He turned his head quicker than Malfoy could lose the snitch to try and hide his blush.</p><p>    "Shove off, Malfoy." Harry stared down at the lacquered table, avoiding Malfoy's piercing gaze. His response, or lack thereof, was met with a tut from Draco.</p><p>    "That's no way to greet someone this close to Christmas, now, is it?" Harry scoffed, rolling his eyes and turning away, picking up a discarded issue of the Daily Prophet. Christmas was indeed a little over a week away, but he was not in the mood to converse with anyone, let alone Draco Malfoy. Reluctantly, as he knew the blond behind him would not leave until he was acknowledged, Harry turned to lock eyes with Malfoy. <em>Needy brat</em>, Harry thought. To his dismay, Draco had taken a seat next to him, his chin resting in his black-gloved hand.</p><p>    "What do you want, Malfoy?" Harry asked, becoming irritated faster than McGonagall could spot a spell-check quill. </p><p>    "Oh, nothing, really. I can't be bothered to converse with them." He paused to gesture to the less-than-desirable remaining Slytherin students, shooting them a glare. "The younger members of my noble house are astoundingly boring. They just don't understand that they could be so much more than the simpering weasels they are." He spoke with such distaste that Harry found himself scooting a bit further away on the bench.</p><p>    "So," Draco continued. "I came to insult you instead."</p><p>    Harry cocked his head, squinting his vibrant green eyes in utter confusion. Where had there been an insult?</p><p>    "You haven't- I mean, not that I kn-" He was stopped abruptly when Draco barked a single, snide laugh.</p><p>    "Well, Potter, if you've looked in a mirror lately, you'll see I don't have to." He stood up with a rather overdramatic flourish of his robes. He snatched a ripe, green apple from a basket on the table and tossed it up and down on his way out.</p><p>    This was not the first time Harry had been frustrated with this particular Slytherin, and it certainly wouldn't be the last. He had become used to Draco approaching him for the sole purpose of stepping on what little was left of his self esteem. Harry set the Prophet down with a slap and headed for Gryffindor Tower in hopes of curling up on one of the sofas to take a nap and ease his turbulent mind. He muttered the password to the Fat Lady, something about mince pie and pixies.

</p><p>     The portrait swung aside, and Harry was greeted with the familiar, home-like atmosphere. A roaring fire crackled in the fireplace, every shade of red, yellow, and orange dancing on the brick. Sweet wrappers, along with a few from puking pastilles, littered the floor and plush sofas. Harry stared wistfully into the fire, clinging desperately to a sliver of hope that Sirius would appear and give him advice with dealing with a certain ferret-faced arse.

</p><p>    "Harry," he'd say, a calm and sincere voice. "Hex him. I mean it. It works every time." Harry smiled to himself at the thought of fatherly advice from his Godfather. He climbed up the stairs and flopped down on his bed, grabbing for a book he hadn't started that Hermione had given him weeks ago. His attention was shifted, however, when a clump of ice hit his window with a resounding <em>smack</em>.</p><p>    Harry blinked in confusion before slowly pushing himself up to see what had launched the frozen projectile. To his surprise, it had been none other than Draco Malfoy. Harry wrestled the window open just as Draco sent up another chunk of snow with a flick of his wand. The icy shrapnel hit its mark, nearly knocking Harry's glasses to meet their unfortunate end far, far below.</p><p>    "Oi, Potter!" Draco yelled.</p><p>    "Bugger off."</p><p>    "I would say I'm sorry, but I'm not."</p><p>    "I can tell." He moved to shut the window, until Draco spoke again. Or rather, shouted.

</p><p>    "Come down here." Harry shivered, but blamed it on the draft. "I'm not waiting all day. It will be this time tomorrow if you don't get a move on." Harry rolled his eyes, but found himself nodding his head anyway. Whatever insult Malfoy had to hurl at him had to be better than some stuffy old book about house elf rights, anyway.</p>
