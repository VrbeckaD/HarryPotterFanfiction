    <p> <em>19 September 1990</em></p><p>"I'm adopted," Hermione said in a matter-of-fact tone to the woman at the door. The woman had been staring at her quite intently ever since she had answered it.</p><p>Hermione Granger had always known she was adopted. Well, she'd known for as long as she'd known that children inherited their looks from their parents, which was somewhat earlier than most children would have known. Hermione Granger had also always been smart. Her parents, for their part, hadn't tried to hide the fact of her adoption from their daughter. It would have been difficult - they were white, and their daughter was black. </p><p>"Pardon?" the woman at the door asked in a strong Scottish accent.</p><p>"I'm adopted." Hermione repeated. When the woman's expression didn't change, she explained further. "You were looking at me the way people do when they know my mum and dad - or even just one of them, sometimes - and they're trying to decide who I am to them. I've never met you before, so I assume you're here for my parents, and you were wondering if I was the child of a family friend or a distant relative. But I'm adopted."</p><p>"Oh," the woman looked a bit flustered, and a bit chastised. "My apologies, miss. You must be Hermione Granger, then?" Hermione nodded, and the woman's brow furrowed very slightly. "I only thought- no, it was silly. My eyes playing tricks. I am here to speak to your whole family about a special school you've been invited to. Are your parents home?"</p><p>As if on cue, Emma and Dan Granger came out of the study to see who had been at the door that was keeping their daughter so long, Minerva McGonagall was brought inside, and the introduction could begin. As usual, Professor McGonagall had to turn herself into a cat before the muggle family believed that Hogwarts wasn't a scam or a joke. All three of the Grangers had questions to ask once the first stumbling block had been overcome, which Professor McGonagall answered as easily as ever. </p><p>"You know, when we decided to adopt we'd imagined how our child might be different from us," Dan said jovially, "We never imagined she'd be a witch!"</p><p>"Will Hermione be the only student at your school who hasn't grown up with magical parents?" Emma asked, slightly more seriously.</p><p>"Not at all," the professor assured her. "Magical children are born to non-magical parents every year. They're called muggle-borns in our society. Hermione's Hogwarts class will be around one-quarter muggle-born. Additionally, around half of the class will be children known as half-bloods, or children with a mixed magical-muggle heritage. The remaining quarter will be from pure-blood families, who have only magical heritage for at least several generations."</p><p>"Is it likely that Hermione is a half- or pure-blood by birth?"</p><p>"No," Professor McGonagall said, once again looking at Hermione very intently, an odd quality to her voice. "Children who are orphaned in the magical world are nearly always placed with godparents or blood relatives. If Hermione was adopted through the muggle system - it is highly unlikely."</p><p>The professor paused. "<em>Not </em>that it makes one whit of a difference to anyone with any sense, in regards to schooling. There is no correlation between blood status and magical ability, or to ability to learn. Some of the children with a magical background may have some understanding of magical theory or familiarity with household spells, depending on what their parents chose to teach them, but others will have gaps in their foundational knowledge which Hermione will have learned at her muggle primary school. The wizarding world has no standardized education prior to age eleven, you see, so in first year we focus heavily on working everyone to a comparable level to their classmates."</p><p> </p><p>At <em>last</em>, Hermione thought, they were going shopping at the magical shopping district, Diagon Alley, that Professor McGonagall had mentioned so early on in their discussion. Her parents had been convinced that a magical school like Hogwarts would be good for her, and that they could send her away to boarding school for ten months of the year without anything horrible happening.</p><p>Diagon Alley, once you got past the pub that Professor McGonagall took them to to access it, was absolutely <em>brilliant</em>. Hermione's active mind was fully occupied taking in the sights and sounds - moving advertisements without screens, broomsticks, owls, people in robes - and she couldn't stop grinning from ear to ear as they made their way to the large marble building the professor identified as the bank so her parents could change over some money to the wizarding currency.</p><p>Gold in hand, Hermione's ever-practical father suggested they start at the end of the Alley furthest from the entrance and work their way back, which Professor McGonagall approved, so long as they saved the wand shop for last. It was a <em>tradition</em>, she told them, to save purchasing a wand for the end of the trip. Hermione was a bit disappointed by that - who wouldn't want to get a wand, after all - but at least the bookshop was still earlier in their trip. </p><p> </p><p>The party of four were approaching the wand shop - Hermione and both of her parents laden down with sacks of books from Flourish and Blotts, which Professor McGonagall had charmed with a lightening spell - when a fiercely whispered conversation caught their ears. </p><p>"It <em>is </em>her, I <em>know</em> it is."</p><p>"I think so too, love, but I don't want you to get your hopes up."</p><p>The first voice turned nearly angry, then. "Luther Braxton, let go of my arm this instant and let me see our Hermione!"</p><p>Hermione, who didn't exactly have a common name, turned to look as she typically did when her named was called out. At the edge of the street, she saw a couple who appeared slightly younger than her parents, the man gripping the woman's arm tightly. When she made eye contact, the woman's breath hitched visibly and Hermione's completely stopped. This woman had Hermione's same eyes, her same nose. She looked to the man, and saw her own cheekbones and chin. Both shared her dark skin. Hermione shook her head slightly, fiercely denying the train of thought that was forming. It wouldn't do to jump to conclusions, she reminded herself. Professor McGonagall had said it was unlikely she had magical parents, and Hermione knew her adoption story. It must be a coincidence - the name, the familiar features, the way the couple was looking at her. The man seemed to be reminding himself of the same thing, while the woman still tried to free her arm from his grip. </p><p>Hermione looked back to the adults she was traveling with. Professor McGonagall was once again looking at her intently, this time shifting her gaze between Hermione and the couple in the street. Her parents watched the whole scene with a visible mixture of confusion, worry, and suspicion. </p><p>"Hermione?" the woman asked again.</p><p>"Professor," Emma Granger said roughly. "What is happening here?"</p><p>"Perhaps we - the six of us - ought to sit down and discuss that," the professor admitted roughly. </p><p>"My name is Gloriana Braxton," said the woman. She had given up on dislodging her husband from her arm, and simply brought the stunned man with her as she approached the Grangers. "This is my husband Luther. Have you eaten? We could treat you to a meal while we talk- I think there's going to be a lot to say."</p><p>The Grangers agreed warily, recognizing the need for answers in each of those present, and the party of six made their way to a nearby cafe whose signs read <em>The Dancing Cricket</em>. </p>
