    <p>Harry Potter loved Hogwarts.  The opening feast had been probably the most amazing thing he had ever seen in his life, with candles floating from the ceiling, food magically appearing and the ghosts; making the boy who lived excited for his new life in the wizarding world.</p><p>Sadly, he and his new friend Ron Weasley did not make the best impression on their first day of classes. The boys had stayed up late the night before talking to their new housemates and had slept in through breakfast. Sadly, no one thought to wake them. Transfiguration had already been in session for ten minutes and their hopes to not be noticed had been squashed by their intimidating Head of House. Who could surprisingly turn into a cat. Thankfully she let them off with a warning and the rest of the embarrassing ordeal was already behind them as the Gryffindors traveled to their next subject.</p><p>“I can’t believe you were late on the first day of classes” admonished Hermine as she walked with the two boys.</p><p>Ron rolled his eyes at her, “It’s not like we planned to be late” he retorted following the mob of students in front of him down to the dungeons.</p><p> Harry had been looking forward to potions. The textbook was one of few that he briefly looked through after his shopping trip with Hagrid. He was slightly concerned about the ridiculous names for some of the ingredients abut was curious to learn what they might be used for. His bias towards the subject changed dramatically when the professor with a large nose, seemed to have a pre-disposition to dislike the boy who lived on the very first day. To add insult to injury Gryffindor had most of their classes with Slytherin and the house rivalry was not helping class dynamics but that would not make Harry’s love for the school dwindle.</p><p>It was lunchtime after potions and Harry pushed thoughts of his greasy haired professor from his mind as he looked forward to what else the new world of magic would show to him. He and Ron joined the Weasley twins for the midday meal and were given some good teasing for their tardiness earlier that morning. It was hot gossip around the castle that the boy who lived would dare to be late to McGonagall’s class.</p><p>“So, have you met the Futures yet?” Fred asked his youngest brother when he got bored with teasing.</p><p>Harry and Ron glanced at each other before shaking their heads, “what’s a Future?” asked Harry.</p><p>“How have you never heard of them? They are the children of some of the most influential people in the wizarding world” stated a surprised voice from slightly down the table.</p><p>Hermine had been trying to get started on her first bit of homework when she had overhead the conversation. Still seeing her fellow first year’s blank looks she sighed in exasperation as she rummaged in her bookbag and pulled out a magazine to show them.</p><p>On the cover was the school’s crest and the young witch flipped through the first few pages before sliding it over to Ron and Harry, “These are the Futures” she said pointing to the centerfold picture of six boys and one girl, “they are the sons and daughter of the most prestigious pure blood families. The future of our generation some say. Their families have held onto department head positions in the ministry for centuries and these students are the heirs.”</p><p>Then Fred nodded at witch’s explanation, “Very good.  Also, they are all first years this year except for one” he added.</p><p>“So, they are just a bunch of rich kids like Malfoy?” asked Ron as turned his attention back to his lunch.</p><p>Before the older boys could answer shouting erupted at the entrance to the hall pulling everyone’s attention. A tall boy with silver hair and three upper classmen were laughing loudly as two small first years picked up the books they had most likely been carrying. Harry and Ron stood up to get a better look but were stopped by the twins.</p><p>“You don’t want to be near that mess mate” said the eldest Weasley present with as much seriousness as he could in his eyes, while the yelling in the background increased.</p><p>Ron looked back towards the obvious bullying in confusion, “Who are they?”</p><p>The Gryffindor prefect, Percy walked over to their group with a stern glared towards the entrance of the great hall, “That is Shougo Haizaki and it would be in your best interest to avoid him.”</p><p>Hermine pulled her magazine towards herself, grabbing Ron and Harry’s attention as she started to read aloud, “Shougo Haizaki is the son of the Shiki Haizaki. Shiki is the department head of Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures” she said then pointed to the silver haired boy in the center fold she had shown them moments ago, “He is the eldest Future and a second year Slytherin.”</p><p>Ron snapped his fingers in memory, “Oh right his dad works with my Dad sometimes.”</p><p>George nodded, “Right-o baby brother, and if you remember he is not a very pleasant man and neither is his son”.</p><p>The laughing by the doorway escalated, Haizaki and his goons had cast a jinx on their victims locking their knees straight so they couldn’t run way. The two boys seemed to be close to tears as the Slytherin’s huddled around them while the bystanders drifted by without even glancing their way.</p><p>Hermine looked to Percy in disbelief, “Aren’t you a prefect? Go help them!”</p><p>Percy glared at the first-year witch, “That would only escalate the problem. Futures can get away with whatever they want as long as a professor is not around. Even then, some of the professors do not want to get involved.”</p><p>Thankfully someone stepped towards the group and placed himself between the victims and Haizaki’s group with a flick of his wand the two boys could move. They ran from the bullies towards the Hufflepuff table with tears streaming down their cheeks as a few upperclassmen quickly tended to them. The hall went silent as the group of Slytherins turned their angered glare towards the newcomer.</p><p>Harry whispered to the table, “Do you know who that is?”</p><p>Hermine nodded and replied just as quietly, “That’s Daiki Aomine, first year Gryffindor, his parents are the heads of the department of Magical Law Enforcement. There is a rumor that he has even helped them on some of their cases.”</p><p>Still getting used to the magical world Harry asked what kind of cases but was shushed as Haizaki levelled his wand on the blue haired first year. After a moment he lowered it with a scoff and turned around back toward the snake house. The hall slowly fell back into its happy atmosphere as Aomine turned towards the Gryffindor house lazily.</p><p>“Hey there blue,” called Fred motioning to the open seat beside him when Daiki Aomine walked towards them.</p><p>The tanned boy rolled his eyes at the nickname but still sat down next to the ginger when he realized there were no other open seats, “Sup?” he asked mostly as a reflex as he started to gather food on his plate.</p><p> Throwing an arm around the tan boy casually George started introductions “We thought we would help you socially awkward first years, this is our baby brother Ron and his friends Harry and Hermine” with an exaggerated sweep of his arm then Fred continued, “and we are Fred and George”.</p><p>The tanned wizard ignored the twins and focused on Harry’s forehead, “So you’re that boy who beat Voldemort?”</p><p>The boy who lived nodded numbly not knowing what to say to someone saying that cursed name so easily. While the others around them seemed to look uneasy.</p><p>Aomine stared at him intensely for a moment before letting out a sigh, “Too bad you weren’t raised with magic, you might have been worth a duel” he said with a shrug.</p><p>The table fell into an awkward silence but it was thankfully broken as owls swarmed the hall and dropped packages and letters to their owners. With no letter of his own Harry looked through the strange magical newspaper, still mesmerized by the moving pictures and changing words. He hadn’t really been focused on the articles until the headline caught his eye. Break in at Gringotts.</p><p>“Hey Ron look at this” he said while moving the paper over to his red-haired friend, “This was the vault Hagrid and I went to.”</p><p>The youngest Weasley just shrugged and seemed more interested in his food so Harry dropped the matter.</p><p>The Gryffindors made their way out onto the lawn a few days later and Ron let out a groan when he saw the green robes of Slytherin already their waiting for their instructor.</p><p>Aomine, unlike the rest of his housemates, casually walked over to the two shortest Slytherins one with dark red hair and the other teal, “Hey Tetsu, Akashi” he greeted casually.</p><p>The houses started to whisper madly as the three boys had a quiet conversation about the transfiguration homework. Hooch was quick to appear and get the lesson started so the whispers did not last for long.</p><p>The professor was impressed by the students who were able to get their brooms in hand so quickly. Harry smiled in triumph at being able to use magic, he was still mentally pinching himself to make sure this wasn’t all a dream. He looked at his fellow lions and saw a blonde boy he had yet to meet had his broom in hand as well as Aomine. The boy who lived looked across to the house of snakes and noted that Draco and the two boys Aomine had been talking to were also holding their brooms.</p><p>The lesson proceeded after the last student got their broom to finally obey and all of the students mounted ready to have their first flying lesson. Neville in his excitement had pushed too hard and ended up with a broken arm leaving the class momentary suspended while the professor took him to the infirmary.</p><p>“Give that back Malfoy” Harry stated when he realized that the blonde snake had Neville’s remember ball thing.</p><p>With an evil smirk the young Malfoy mounted his broom and flew off to the skies. Harry quickly followed determined to not let this rich boy have his way.</p><p>“You really want it back that badly?” asked Malfoy with a raised eyebrow as he tossed the fragile thing around in his hands.</p><p>Still shaky on his broom Harry didn’t loose his determination as he glared at the other first year. With a shrug the Slytherin threw the object as far as he could. Harry zoomed by and Draco chuckled to himself as he watched the brunette try to rescue the trinket.</p><p>“Did you find that entertaining?” asked an unimpressed short red head from Draco’s right side.</p><p>The blonde glared at the other Slytherin for a moment before turning to go back to the rest of the class.</p><p>Harry felt tears in his eyes from how fast he was flying, but he never lost sight of the small ball. At the same moment he grabbed the ball he noticed that there was a window that he was about to crash into. A chill ran down his spine when he realized he had no idea how to stop. In the next blink of an eye instead of feeling glass cut into his body he felt someone tackle into him.</p><p>“Jesus you shouldn’t be flying that fast if you don’t know how to turn” grumbled Aomine causing Harry to open his eyes and see familiar blue hair.</p><p>Glancing around Harry noted that he was still high up in the air and that the window he was about to smash into was slightly to his left. Aomine had his hand on Harry’s broom while his other arm was draped over the smaller boy’s shoulders keeping him on the flying cleaning equipment.</p><p>“Oh, um thanks” said Harry slightly embarrassed.</p><p>The blue haired boy rolled his eyes while letting him go before turning around and returning to the class. The brunette followed closely behind and the Gryffindor’s came running over to cheer for his standing up to Draco.</p><p>The celebration was short lived as McGonagall strode out onto the field calling for Potter.</p><p>Harry and Ron were walking and talking excitedly down the corridors, “You have to be the youngest wizard in the century” the red head exclaimed giddily.</p><p>Harry scratched the back of his head, “Well I won’t be the only first year playing, apparently Aomine was already recruited and the other houses have first years playing too.”</p><p>In the next moment a heavy arm wrapped around his neck while an identical one wrapped around Ron’s, “Congrats Harry. Wood’s just told us” Said George Weasley with a wicked grin that was matched on his twin’s face.</p><p>Not only was Aomine the son of amazing aurors he was also, a prodigy when it came to Quidditch. On the first day of practice the blue haired first year had managed to make their captain goal keeper look like a toddler on a broom. Harry, who was supposed to be watching for the snitch found himself looking after the blue haired boy instead.</p><p>The upperclassmen of the team seemed to be having the same problem, they were happy to have such a great player but they didn’t like how easily this eleven-year-old was besting them. The new Gryffindor chaser was oblivious to the looks as he sped across the pitch a bright smile on his face.</p><p>“That boy is crazy good” Fred said to his brother as they hovered slightly below Harry to watch.</p><p>His twin nodded in agreement, “We may even be able to beat Slytherin this year” he said excitedly.</p><p>Then the twins looked up unison, “Just be sure to get that snitch Harry.”</p><p>The brunette blushed when he realized he had been caught not practicing and sped off looking for the golden ball.</p><p>Charms was the only class that Gryffindor first years had by themselves, Hermine theorized that even though the school promotes rivalries sometimes they need a break.  A few weeks into term the short professor finally deemed them ready to practice a real charm. After lecturing on the basic rules and having them write a paper about the levitation charm that they would be conducting. Even with all of the studying and assignments Seamus Finnigan still managed to catch his feather on fire while Ron could not so much as get it to budge.</p><p>Flitwick clapped in delight as he called everyone’s attention to the back corner of the classroom. Aomine had his feather floating high in the air as he lazily leaned back in his chair almost as if on the verge of sleep. Some of the students rolled their eyes at the display, he was a Future after all. In the next moment another feather joined Aomine’s perking the blue haired boy’s attention and everyone else’s.</p><p>Looking around Flitwick could not figure out who was charming the second feather while the other first years lost interest and tried to get their own to rise. Not wanting to be outdone Aomine concentrated a little more and made his feather do loops in the air, not even after the first loop was done the rival feather followed.</p><p>With a huff of air, the bluenette raced his charm across the room and it was quickly followed again. Getting irritated Aomine cut the charm on the feather and let it float to the ground and levitated his text book next. Thinking he would now know who the other person was Aomine waited for another book to join his and was irritated when he saw Seamus’s.</p><p>“Hey who stole my book?” exclaimed soot covered boy drawing everyone’s attention to the two books floating in the air.</p><p>Flitwick was amazed by the demonstration and awarded Gryffindor twenty points and was asking who the other person was so he could reward them as well but no one stepped forward. Limply another feather floated in to the air.</p><p>“Well done Mrs. Granger” said Flitwick satisfied being able to reward a second student even if it wasn’t the one he could figure out.</p><p>-------------------------</p><p>Afterward Ron and Harry walked through the courtyard towards dinner talking about charms class. Ron was beyond irritated with the witch that they had become friendly with when she tried to teach him the charm. Harry laughed along jokingly with Seamus and Dean as they all felt annoyed with not being able to cast the charm. Hermine shoved her way through them making Ron feel slightly guilty but they continued on their way to the dining hall.</p><p>Harry had forgotten it was Halloween until he saw all of the floating pumpkins and candy filled bowls. The two boys started to devour the sweet treats as their housemates slowly filled the lion table.</p><p>After filling his plate Fred looked a certain blue haired boy next to him, “Hey where’s Momoi?” he asked curiously.</p><p>The pink haired girl was becoming a constant fixture at the Gryffindor table and was always harassing Aomine like it was her job. In a sense it was, because it became obvious to the lion house that the blue haired boy would spend his whole day on the quidditch pitch if she was not there to drag him to classes or meals. Hermine had made friends with the girl on the first day of classes because they had been the only two students in the library doing homework.</p><p>The tan boy shrugged his shoulders as he continued to eat his pumpkin pie, “Something about a friend crying in the bathroom” he said off handedly.</p><p>“It’s not my fault” Ron said defensively when Harry gave him a pointed look.</p><p> “Who’s crying?” Questioned George sensing the potential for gossip.</p><p>Before either boy could explain what had happened a few hours ago professor Quill ran into the great hall yelling about a troll in the dungeons. Dumbledore quickly reigned in the chaos that had ensued, ordering prefects to take their houses to their dorms. Percy went into action and called for Gryffindors attention and lead the first years after him from the dining hall.</p><p>“I don’t understand why we can’t just stay in here? If the thing is in the dungeons we would be able to keep it from entering the one door” remarked Aomine in despair that he had to leave his meal.</p><p>Percy ignored the boy’s words as he shepherded them into a line.</p><p>During the walk back to the dorms, Harry pulled Ron around a corner, “Hermine doesn’t know about the troll” he explained while pulling his friend along.</p><p>They raced through the hallways to find the young witch only to see that the troll had beat them there by seconds. They charged into the bathroom to see a blonde boy standing in the corner of the bathroom with Hermine and Momoi behind him. His wand was at the ready to cast a spell but pushing the two girls out of the way of the swinging club took priority. The stranger nudged the girls under the sink while Harry and Ron threw rocks at the creature to attract its attention.  </p><p>The troll turned swinging his club destroying the last two stalls that had been standing. Not being the brightest creature, the troll thought he had beat his attacker and turned his attention back to the three trapped students. Momoi had her wand ready and called out an unfamiliar spell that had no effect on the troll. In retaliation the beast lashed out with amazing speed, with barely enough time to think the blonde jumped in front of the kneeling girls; the club smashed into the blonde’s shoulder pushing him the rest of the way into the ground with a cry of pain.</p><p>Hermine screamed from the sight catching the troll’s attention again. Thinking quickly Harry grabbed the trolls club as he brought it back for another swing towards the witch. In the next moment the boy who lived found himself on the large creature’s shoulders and holding on for dear life. He tried to cast a spell. Only to realize as his wand ended up in the angered troll’s nose that it was probably not the best idea to swing his wand around while being thrashed about. Without his weapon the troll grabbed the boy by his ankle then tried to turn him into a pinata but was luckily not very good at aiming.</p><p>Ron pulled his wand out ready to cast his own spell but froze while Hermine tried to walk him through the recent charm they had learned in class. Then before they realized what was happening the troll’s club swiftly left his hand and smacked him in the head. Knocking the large creature out cold.</p><p>“Did I do that?” Ron asked in surprise as he looked at his wand for an answer.</p><p>“You would know if you did” remarked a familiar voice from behind the red head.</p><p>“Dai!” yelled Momoi as she ran into the tanned boy’s arms.</p><p>A small groan caught Hermine’s attention, the blonde boy was pulling himself to his feet as he dusted himself off and put his wand away.</p><p>The frizzy haired witch gasped, “are you alright?” she asked as she quickly got to his side while Harry retrieved his wand from the troll’s nose.</p><p>The stranger nodded with a small smile, “Yep I cast arresto momentum so it didn’t hit me too hard, the bruises are going to hurt though” he said with a bright smile while holding his left shoulder.</p><p>Hermine could feel her cheeks warm up when the blonde smiled at her. She stuttered for a moment not knowing what to say but was distracted as professors Quirrell, McGonagall, and Snape rushed into the bathroom.</p><p>“What are you doing here” asked the head of Gryffindor with her stern gaze upon the students.</p><p>Hermine stepped forward to take responsibility before any of the others could explain. After a moment of thought the transfiguration professor accepted the story and quickly dismissed them telling them that they were lucky.</p><p>Once out of sight of the professors Aomine turned on his four classmates, “What the hell were you thinking?” he demanded with a dark glare.</p><p>Momoi wasn’t fazed by the stare, “It’s not like we wanted to fight that thing” she stated with her arms crossed.</p><p>The tension held for a moment while the two friends glared at each other. It was obvious that these two had been friends for a long time because Harry had a feeling that were having a conversation only they could understand in the tense silence.</p><p>“So, who are you?” Ron asked looking at the blonde who was patting dust off of his robes.</p><p>Golden eyes sparkled as everyone turned to look at him, “You didn’t notice that I am in every single one of your classes?” he asked in disbelief with a small shake of his head.</p><p>Ron blushed at the boy’s small smirk and abnormal eyes. He didn’t know why but a had an urge to try and keep this boy’s attention on him no matter what.</p><p>Aomine scoffed, “What’s there to notice?” he asked with a cocky smirk.</p><p>His pink haired friend elbowed him hard in the stomach, “Stop being a jerk Dai” then she gestured to the blonde, “This is your fellow house mate and first year, Ryouta Kise” and then she motioned to the other students, “these are Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Daiki Aomine” she said with a bright smile.</p><p>Kise nodded in greeting to the boys who returned the gesture.</p><p>Then she pulled the blonde into a hug, “Thank you for protecting Hermine and I.”</p><p> “What were you doing in the girl’s bathroom for anyway” Ron asked suspiciously before the blonde could acknowledge the thanks.</p><p>The blonde cast a side glance at Hermine as he untangled himself from the pinkette, “I noticed an upset housemate and wanted to make sure they were alright.”</p><p>Ron had the decency to look guilty while Harry took over the conversation “We’re sorry Hermine, about what we said in the courtyard. You were just trying to help and we were being pig headed”.</p><p>Hermine spared him a brief nod in acknowledgement of his apology while Ron regained his tongue, “Right, what are friends for if we can’t speak our mind?”</p><p>Hermine smiled brightly at the comment and excepted the apology. Aomine let out a loud exhaled breath, clearly showing how bored he was of this whole situation.</p><p>“If you idiots are done I want to go to bed” he said before turning on his heal and walking away.</p><p> Momoi rolled her eyes before her attention back to the others, “We should probably get back to our dorms or the professors won’t be so lenient. See you all tomorrow and good luck at tomorrows match Harry” she chirped before disappearing around a corner.</p>
