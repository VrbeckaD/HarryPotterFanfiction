<hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Draco sneered at the shimmery thickness of the wards before him. His black cloak rippled in the wind as he let his eyes roam the distant ruins.</p><p align="justify">The wind howled, deriding the sweet irony of the joyless sight before him.</p><p align="justify">With a shiver, he pulled the lapels closer to his neck. Even though the pink spring dawn promised a lenient day, nature was roaring her breath across the flank of the mountain.</p><p align="justify">Pulling his lower lip between his teeth, he fixed his gaze on the outline of what once was a safe haven for young minds to be nurtured and cared for. That was until Voldemort had wrecked it, turning it into a grave of sorrow. He had forged it into a prison for Muggle-borns and dissidents - all of them traitors alike.</p><p align="justify">The ancient castle was in shambles. The once imposing Gryffindor and Ravenclaw towers and the Great Hall rested now in a heap of crumbled stone. The only sentinel left overlooking the Black Lake was the Astronomy Tower, and Draco glared at its resilience.</p><p align="justify">The grounds used to be green and welcoming, but they were no more. Slithering its dark limbs right up to the grey sides of the gothic walls, the Forest had taken over every nook and cranny. The malignant plants were like fingers wrapped around a throat, domineering and suffocating. It seemed like a miracle that the West Wing was still standing, although it looked ready to collapse under the weight of the ever growing Forbidden Forest.</p><p align="justify">Prisoners lived and died there, separated from the rest of the Wizarding world. No guards were needed as nobody without a Dark Mark could approach the wards without dying. The inmates bore a special runic tattoo on their arms that allowed them entrance once, killing all the magic within them - a macabre passage to their fate.</p><p align="justify">In his magnanimity, the Dark Lord allowed the Death Eaters free roam of the grounds only for a single day every passing year- Victory Day.</p><p align="justify">The barrier trembled, losing its sheerness and giving off a buzzing dying lament. A thrill of anticipation ran across Draco’s skin, for he knew that it was almost time for the annual Hunt in celebration of their triumph.</p><p align="justify">The Prison of Hogwarts was open, and it was Traitor Season.</p><p align="justify">His Mark prickled as he stepped through the weakened barrier, his feet immediately taking him on a brisk walk over the stony ground descending the slope of the mountain. He knew where to find her.</p><p align="justify">Every year, he stalked her.</p><p align="justify">In the months before the anniversary commemoration, he flew over the Hunting Grounds and observed her as she took the same path through the forest.</p><p align="justify">He hovered above the tall trees and studied her as she set up traps and obstacles for him.</p><p align="justify">She knew he was coming for her, and the mere thought of her preparing for him made his skin crawl with excitement. She was brilliant. Even without the aid of magic, she created the most intricate contraptions. His eyes had followed her labouring hands countless times as she knotted chords and vines, dug holes, and hid weapons that she had sharpened out of wood.</p><p align="justify">Her cleverness drew him to her like the scent of blood tempted a wolf. Too bad, all her effort was in vain. Hidden behind the curtain of the wards, he could map each and every one of her tricks.</p><p align="justify">If it pleased him, he could take his time to flush her out of her hideout. The other Death Eaters wouldn't dare touch her. In recent years, he had secured a claim on her. She was his per Voldemort’s orders, to compensate him for his dedication to his duties. Although nobody had the guts to go against the Lord's command or cross his right hand, he would not linger.</p><p align="justify">He strolled down the mountain, cloak lashing the air behind him, until the path through the vegetation opened to a small clearing. A poor, collapsed shack gave him a cold welcome as it lay there like crumpled parchment. It had once belonged to the half-giant simpleton who loved to play professor.</p><p align="justify">Draco circled the stone wall that enclosed the wild, fallow patch. The plants had swallowed everything in their wake since they had thrived without the ruling hand of the oaf.</p><p align="justify">The immense leaves of the magical vegetables made for the perfect shelter, if only Draco wasn't cheating and didn't know her plans.</p><p align="justify">A low chuckle marked the moment he spotted her. Behind the massive heads of the overgrown cauliflowers, like darkened leaves whipping in the wind, he caught a glimpse of bouncing curls.</p><p align="justify">His boots dug in the muddy soil as he came to a halt. Chest heaving from the excitement, he rolled his shoulders and kept his eyes fixed on the patch of leaves she had retreated in. With deliberate movements, he took off his cloak, the chill completely forgotten. He was buying his time to calm his strained breathing. Moreover, he had appearances to maintain. A Malfoy couldn't be seen panting and lusting like a canine. Although his groin knew that was exactly what he craved, for her to cry wolf while he hunted her down like an animal. The jacket of his suit swiftly joined the other abandoned garment on the ground.</p><p align="justify">“This is getting too easy. It’s like you’re eager for me to find you,” he hissed while he uncuffed and rolled up the sleeves of his black Oxford shirt.</p><p align="justify">A scoff confirmed her position while it shook her chocolate locks, only a little further down than he had thought.</p><p align="justify">“Is this the year? Will you finally give me a fair fight, Malfoy?” Her melodic voice danced in the wind.</p><p align="justify">Draco didn’t answer but loosened the knot of the tie around his neck. Her breath hitched before she spoke again. “Will you finally give me my magic back? Or are you too scared to lose in a fair fight?” She pulled herself up to stand tall as she shouted the last words. </p><p align="justify">At the sight of her, Draco bit his lip. Only a scant dress with thin straps covered her lithe figure. Her choice of clothing was another sweet victory. Short, revealing dresses were his weakness, and she knew it. He was sure that she had thought of him as she dressed that morning, and it was enough to send a flush of blood to his groin. “It would never be a fair fight, love,” he argued as he extracted his wand from his dress trousers.</p><p align="justify">The frown that formed on her perfectly smooth forehead was adorable, and it sent another tingle right to his cock.</p><p align="justify">“Why?” The fire in her eyes burned like flames against a dark sky, and it consumed him.</p><p align="justify">“Because you wouldn’t hit me.” His snicker was low and husky.</p><p align="justify">His witch stomped her foot, her riotous curls swaying as she hurled herself over the enormous vegetables. “Try me, coward!”</p><p align="justify">His chest shook as he decided that it was going to be a good year for the hunt. Some of his platinum locks fell over his eyes as he laughed at her. “Your lies turn me on, love.”</p><p align="justify">Draco could almost see her blood boiling as she glared at him, her pride keeping her from giving in. He could tell that she had missed him as much as he had coveted her for a whole year as though he were a writhing heartbeat in the witching hour.</p><p align="justify">How he loved to rile her up before he pursued her like a prey year after year, but he would wait no more; his own blood was boiling too. He needed her skin between his fingers.</p><p align="justify">“I'll count to ten, witch. Then you'll be mine.”</p><p align="justify">Like lighting hidden among clouds, she zipped back, disappearing into the plants. She reappeared shortly as she jumped over the crumbling stone wall and immersed her petite figure into the forest.</p><p align="justify">He immediately set after her, not even giving her the courtesy of some advantage seconds.</p><p align="justify">He knew she would skim along the big hole she had dug and covered at the edge of the forest, hoping for him to fall in. With long strides, he ran up to the trap and effortlessly jumped over it.</p><p align="justify">"Nice try, love." He couldn't help taking the piss out of her.</p><p align="justify">The frustrated groan from somewhere close gave him the shivers. This was fun.</p><p align="justify">Leaves and twigs cracked under her trainers not so far in front of him, and he followed her trail into the thicket.</p><p align="justify">He dodged a few more traps, each time making a show of his survival skills. Every time, he could hear his lioness growling her exasperation. Although she was hidden from him, he could imagine with certainty how her eyes would glow with annoyance.</p><p align="justify">After he avoided a stretched vine, knotted around two trees, he finally saw the hem of her dress disappearing behind a crooked trunk.</p><p align="justify">Draco didn't like to use magic while hunting. Not in the spirit of fairness for her. Fuck that, he couldn't care less. The satisfaction of catching her solely because of his flesh and muscles, though, was priceless. The only spells he allowed himself were the ones that made the game more fun - for him, of course. He cast a Disillusionment Charm on himself while he hustled in her direction. He felt evanescent while he ran with the wind, as though he were a shadow in the dust. He had trained for this, and there was nothing that could stop him. He could go for hours without tiring, like a restless storm.</p><p align="justify">As he became one with nature, he let his most hidden desires run free. He became the animal that he was supposed to keep at bay, and he began hunting her like prey, panting behind her arse.</p><p align="justify">There she was, in front of him, her pale legs sprinting among the unearthed roots. The dress flew up with every step, revealing a flash of white knickers barely covering her abundant buttocks. Oh, he had missed the sight of that bouncing show. Her curls where everywhere as she eyed behind her in a feeble attempt to spot him. Although he revelled in the pursuit, the best things to savour during the hunt were the few, sweet instants before he caught her. The fear in her eyes as she heard his steps getting closer but saw no sign of him. Her shallow breathing delighted his ears while the scent of her aroused him as he trailed right behind her.</p><p align="justify">He stretched his arm forward, allowing his hand to wrap around a lock of her curls. Just before he could trap her in his grasp, she sprinted forward with a squeal. Oh, that was new. She didn't use to be so quick. Maybe she had trained too, in anticipation of their little kinky game.</p><p align="justify">"You are getting faster, love," he breathed out, his words as ragged as the air that hit his lungs.</p><p align="justify">"Or maybe you are getting slower, Malfoy." She released a giggle as she began zigzagging before him. She turned once, and her fear was gone and replaced with the determination to lose him. She winked at him as if she knew exactly where he was while her body changed direction once more.</p><p align="justify">The little minx was having fun too, and it was a delight to see. He licked his lips as he stayed at her heels.</p><p align="justify">He loved how she reduced him to a bundle of lust and desire. Fuck the Malfoy image or anybody who might see him in this state should the Disillusionment wear off. He was going to take her like a beast. He wanted her to take him too; he desired to submit to her strokes like a tamed wolf. He wanted to be her own animal.</p><p align="justify">With a growl, he pounced forward and wrapped his arms around her thin waist.</p><p align="justify">She screamed, and what a delightful sound that was. The fall on the ground was hard and painful, but he didn't let it stop him from pinning her down under his weight.</p><p align="justify">"Mine," he drawled in her ear.</p><p align="justify">"Not yet, Malfoy." She wiggled her bum underneath him, straining to find an opening to crawl away. The friction against his trousers was delicious, but he focused on stilling her. She scrambled among the leaves on the ground and found a rather large stick. Since Draco's arms were wrapped tightly around her, he couldn't shield himself when she swung the weapon behind her head and hit his shoulder.</p><p align="justify">On instinct, he rolled sideways while she pushed herself up and stumbled away.</p><p align="justify">He sneered as he sat up and stood, watching her arse jiggle away.</p><p align="justify">For as much as he cared about her, if she wanted to play rough, rough was what she would get. After all, in the immediate future, he would need her touch and not her affection.</p><p align="justify">With a low chuckle, he resumed his hunt, trying not to get distracted by the bulge in his briefs that was growing steadily. He found her again at the Whomping Willow's feet. The plant rested as lifeless as the castle behind it. It had died right after the Final Battle. Draco neither knew why nor cared to find out.</p><p align="justify">Granger stopped by the massive trunk, hesitating only for a moment before she disappeared into the tree hollow.</p><p align="justify">Draco laughed. She had just trapped herself. The secret passage leading to the Shrieking Shack had been long before discovered and destroyed.</p><p align="justify">As he entered the dead tree through a crack in the trunk, he squinted his eyes to adjust to the darkness. Humidity and musk entered his nostrils, engulfing his senses. Granger was nowhere to be seen, and a lightning bolt of excitement pulsed through him. "What does the clever witch have in store for the big bad wolf?"</p><p align="justify">A muffled giggle resonated within the cavity, and Draco could imagine her eyes twinkling in the darkness. He was growing impatient with each second passing, his fingers twitching around his wand as he contemplated casting a revealing spell and getting this over with.</p><p align="justify">He bit the inside of his lower lip while he spun around in the centre of the willow.</p><p align="justify">A whipping lash from his right startled him. As he turned his head in that direction, he never saw what was coming from the other side of the darkened room. Something cold and scratchy grasped his bare forearm and slipped the wand from his hold. The weapon fell and rolled away from him, disappearing into the blackness.</p><p align="justify">Draco kept his cool even when the Disillusionment Charm faded away. He knew that the tattoo on Hermione's skin kept her from using his own wand against him. As his eyes recognised who, or rather what was trapping him, more roots sprouted from the ground and coiled up his legs.</p><p align="justify">While his eyes narrowed dangerously at the vines at his feet, the one that had previously caught his left arm wrapped tighter around him and slithered up to his shoulder. The humid, cold flesh of the root made him shiver when it grazed his collarbone and followed his sternum down to coil around his torso. The buttons of his shirt snapped along with the plant's descent across his waist. It didn’t take long for the root to rip his shirt and bind both arms to his waist. The torn fabric pooled at his feet, leaving only his black tie to dangle loosely around his neck. He fought with all his strength. His muscles contracted and burnt with the effort, but the ancient willow was stronger.</p><p align="justify">When he gave up with a growl, he heard Hermione sigh from her hiding place.</p><p align="justify">Draco remained still like a cornered snake, studying his surroundings and trying to find the best way to counter-attack. His eyes scanned the knotted roots and the way they contorted and moved around him.</p><p align="justify">That was when she appeared to him at last, emerging from a hole like the sun peeking from the horizon.</p><p align="justify">"You look fit, Malfoy." Her gaze burnt his skin as it traced the lines of his exposed chest and abs. He quirked his brow once, his mind still racing to find a solution to his predicament.</p><p align="justify">To buy himself some time, he hoped to make her talk. “How do you control the willow without magic?”</p><p align="justify">Hermione's pupils shone in the darkness as she caressed one of the radixes, grabbing the whole girth and stroking it up and down once. The plant vibrated in her palm as though it were purring. The sight stirred his imagination, his cock aching to be the one being pet.</p><p align="justify">“When Riddle burned the library to the ground,” she spat his name with hatred, avoiding the name that still bore a Trace, “he forgot that Hogwarts always has a way to protect its students. The walls of the library are hollow, filled only with stacks and stacks of books that Rowena Ravenclaw hid for anyone clever enough to find them. She duplicated every single tome that the library hosted at her time, then devised a charm to continue the work after her passing. One of the books that survived the fire explained the magic that was used to charm the Whomping Willow. It’s actually a sad tale that includes a werewolf and his Animagi friends, but I won’t recaunt it now.”</p><p align="justify">Draco licked his lower lip as she encircled him, her supple legs climbing over the roots. While she stepped closer at each turn, Draco’s gaze followed the rising hem of her dress. There were some beads of perspiration on her chest, slowly cascading into her cushy cleavage, that made Draco salivate. He gulped as she stopped before him, just an arm's length away. He strained in his restraints, but his arms were growing numb as the plant kept squeezing tighter. “You haven’t answered my question. How are you controlling this fucking plant?” Although he kept squirming his torso, he was unable to escape the ensnaring force of the willow.</p><p align="justify">With a wicked grin, Hermione lightly tapped on a root. Draco felt the ground being swept away from beneath his feet as the magic tugged him backwards until his back hit the wall.</p><p align="justify">"The Willow fell in a dormant state when the castle crumbled. The book explained how to revive it. I’m the second person after the werewolf I mentioned to control this magnificent plant. It turns out that the kind of blood magic I used doesn’t require the casting of spells," she explained it in a disinterested timbre while she stalked toward him. She halted only centimetres from him. Her wild curls tickled his waist as her breath ghosted on his neck.</p><p align="justify">His smart witch was unstoppable. He was almost vibrating with the need to be touched by that glorious body and mind, and she seemed to understand it.</p><p align="justify">Looking up at him, she batted her eyelashes. Then, she pushed herself up so slowly that he thought he could die waiting. He huffed at the dimple of naughtiness that appeared above her plump lips.</p><p align="justify">Her mouth breathed on his jaw, just enough to drive him mad, and she hissed, “Now, Draco, <em> you </em>are mine.” While his given name rolled on her tongue, it looked like sin on her red lips.</p><p align="justify">The sigh of relief that left his mouth when she tugged him down by the tie to press her lips on his own was shaky and breathless. Smiling against his skin, she sucked his lower lip between her teeth, biting lightly, and immediately laved at the sore spot.</p><p align="justify">Draco’s knees liquefied, and he was thankful for the support offered by the roots. That witch had driven him mad for an eternity, but year after year, he had discovered a new aspect of her that brought him down quite literally on his knees before her perfection.</p><p align="justify">The predator had become the prey, and he fully submitted to his new mistress as she unbuckled his belt. “Yes…” he whispered, and his plea of surrender vanished into her kiss.</p><p align="justify">With hurried jerks, Hermione divested him of his black trousers and briefs. The roots pulsed around his calves to slide his clothes down. In all his filthy fantasies about Granger, he had never imagined being stripped by a fucking plant, boots and all. His naked feet dangled just above the ground while she took hold of his freed erection. He gasped, and the loud sound drew a giggle out of her. After one year of dreaming about her hands on him when he wanked himself, he had almost forgotten how soft and small her hands felt around his cock.</p><p align="justify">Exposing his tip, she swiped the drops of lubrication that he knew had collected there and pumped him with both hands, squeezing tightly.</p><p align="justify">Draco stopped snogging her, his brain overtaken by the intense sensation. Her mouth peppered kisses along his chin and neck, and kept sliding lower. Her hair brushed his thighs as she knelt before him. One of her hands abandoned his cock and caressed a root. The willow pulled his legs slightly apart so that his groin could be in front of her gorgeous face - damn his height.</p><p align="justify">Her eyes met his, and he swallowed hard as she smirked.</p><p align="justify">“I missed your penis,” she whispered as she leant forward and rubbed her cheek on his tip. He almost laughed at her clinical, sedulous way to define his prick, but the blissful grin she bore as she worshipped him killed the bubble of laughter in the pit of his stomach.</p><p align="justify">Never leaving his eyes, she kissed him on the frenum, her tongue immediately lapping the same spot. Draco’s hips jerked forward, and she gladly opened her mouth to take him. The wet warmth that welcomed him blackened his sight. He let his head fall back against the wall behind him and relished in the way she licked and worked his tip, wrapping her lips around it and circling it with her tongue. Her hands had been still, but she soon started stroking up and down, driving him deeper into her mouth. Won by the urge to see the spectacle at his feet, he tilted his chin down and opened his eyes. When he could focus again, he looked at his shaft sliding back and forth in her mouth, each time deeper until he felt the back of her throat. He groaned as she gagged around him, his cock barely halfway in and a hand still wrapped around it. A satisfied smirk pulled at his lips.</p><p align="justify">Nothing prepared him for what she did next. She let go of him and took him in almost all the way, choking and gurgling on him. As if that wasn’t enough to drive him mad, Hermione brought her hands on her breasts, fondling and teasing herself.</p><p align="justify">With teary eyes, she drew back to take a breath, and he watched mesmerized as one of her hands slid lower between her thighs. He almost came on her face as her eyes fluttered shut the instant she found her core.</p><p align="justify">“Take that dress off, let me see you touching yourself.” He meant to sound assertive and confident, but his voice came out strained and husky.</p><p align="justify">The naughty temptress shook her head and brought her lips on him again. She moaned on his tip as her fingers worked her clit, and his chest heaved as he started panting.</p><p align="justify">“Granger, free me. I have waited a year to fuck you,” he breathed out. It wouldn’t do for his ego to tell her the truth, that if she didn’t stop, he would explode down her throat like a virginal teenager. Although she couldn’t blame him for it since it had been three hundred and sixty fucking five days, and her mouth felt better than he could dream.</p><p align="justify">Hermione let go of his cock with a pop, licking her lips while her eyes smoulder him like molten amber. She whimpered freely as she kept touching herself and he growled, bucking into his restraints.</p><p align="justify">“Let me go!” His voice thundered, and she finally stopped. The hem of her dress slid up as she moved her hand, gifting him with a glimpse of her soaked knickers. He had to bite his lip to keep an undignified mewl from escaping him.</p><p align="justify">As she stood, he released a victorious sigh, anticipating his imminent freedom. His cock was pulsing, screaming for attention.</p><p align="justify">Hermione stepped back, sliding her underwear down her legs and slipping her trainers through it. With a mischievous grin, she bent over to touch one of the vines. The bark on the wall behind him scraped the skin on his back as his body slumped down, the willow forcing him into a sitting position. The ground felt cold under his buttocks, and he scrunched his nose at the uncomfortable sensation. As a Pureblood gentleman, he was not used to laying bare in the wilderness. As much as he abhorred the thought of filth, he forgot about it steadfast when Hermione approached him. She stopped beside him and climbed over him with one leg.</p><p align="justify">With his head at her stomach level, he could smell her arousal. She was sweet and heavenly. Her hands grazed up her thighs as she rolled up her dress. He hummed when she revealed her glistening lips to him. He dipped his head, licking his lips as he tried to slither between her legs. The roots kept him from her delicious, dripping sex. He had never hated a plant this fucking much. He wished he could incinerate it.</p><p align="justify">“Tsk, tsk, tsk,” Hermione dipped her arse down, lowering herself on him. “I need you inside of mhhh.” Her phrase crumbled into a moan as she took him into her tight core.</p><p align="justify">“Fuck.” Draco looked down at his cock slowly stretching her open. The heat that sheathed him felt like coming home after years of absence. She moved slowly at first, getting used to his size. He cast his gaze up at her; her dark eyes shone in the dim atmosphere. Her rhythm quickened as she bounced on his cock, her feet firmly planted to the ground.</p><p align="justify">She rode him like a goddess, holding herself up by the thick roots of the willow. He wished he could dig his fingers into her hips to slam her down harder, but he was powerless, his hands laying useless at the side of his arse. So he captured her lips and chased her tongue while the walls inside of her began fluttering. Her knees fell forward, and she rocked her hips against him. Draco looked her in the eyes, his balls tingling, as her walls clamped on him and she screamed her release into his mouth. Determined to fuck her himself, he focused on keeping his climax at bay.</p><p align="justify">She collapsed forward, her head nestling into his neck while the vines slid and tangled around them. Her chest was heaving against him as she tried to catch her breath.</p><p align="justify">He didn’t let her. “Get this fucking plant off me, now!” He finally managed to use a commanding timbre, the same he used while speaking to lesser Death Eaters.</p><p align="justify">Hermione chuckled on his skin, but pushed herself off him nonetheless. She stood on weak knees and smiled at his hard, pulsing cock. A light touch of her fingers told the roots to recede, and Draco was finally free.</p><p align="justify">The rush of blood into his limbs made him shiver, the numbness giving in to the burn, but he didn’t mind the pain. In a matter of seconds, he was up and charged her like an infuriated animal.</p><p align="justify">Hermione squealed as he grabbed her waist and pushed her backwards. It was her turn to be pinned against a wall. He assaulted her neck with teeth and tongue while his hands yanked the straps of her dress. While he slid the garment down her arms, his nails scratched her shoulders. He lifted his head and gave her a devilish grin as he spun her around and pulled her wrists above her head where he pinned them there with one hand. She was finally trapped and in his power. He let the other hand trail up her side and moved her wild curls from one shoulder. Leaning down, he whispered in her ear, "Now, Hermione, <em> you </em> are fucking mine.”</p><p align="justify">Sneaking his arm around her chest, he pinched an already hardened nipple. “You better not have any more dirty tricks or-”</p><p align="justify">“Or what, Malfoy?” She squirmed in his grasp and pushed her delicious arse back into his erection. The friction against her velvety skin made him groan.</p><p align="justify">"What will you do to me?" she challenged him as she wiggled her buttocks. The movement brought his cock to nestle between her arsecheeks. He reached down to her core and stroked her clit, eliciting all sorts of mewls and whimpers from her. He kept grinding on her arse and biting her neck and shoulders as he brought her close to the edge again.</p><p align="justify">"You think you are punishing me, Draco?" Her words were strained and breathy, but still cheeky and defiant. Draco growled while he thought of all the ways he would like to deliver his punishment - spanking her came to mind, but he was not willing to put off his own pleasure any longer. He suddenly remembered that his tie was still dangling from his neck. He waited until she was close to coming before abandoning her sleek centre. She whined her frustration which made him snicker.</p><p align="justify">"Don't dare me, love." Draco pulled at his tie, unravelling the knot and slipping it off.</p><p align="justify">Unfortunately, he needed two hands for his plan so he freed her. Flustered as she was, she had no intention to escape him again. She reached behind her, looking for him, probably to pull his mouth onto her neck again. But he evaded her touch.</p><p align="justify">"Now, be a good girl and brace yourself on the wall," he ordered while he wrapped his tie around his right palm. He flung it around her waist and caught it, firmly coiling it around his left hand. She shuddered as the silky material tickled her skin. Winding the tie once more around his hands, Draco yanked her hips back so that she had to bend over and stick her arse out. </p><p align="justify">He positioned his cock at her entrance and slammed inside her with no warning. She cried out as he immediately started pounding into her. Instead of grabbing her by her hips, each of his hands held on to his coiled tie, pulling her onto him with each of his trusts so that he could take her deeper and deeper.</p><p align="justify">She was panting and trying to talk, but only nonsense came out. "Yes...Draco...so good. Ah!"</p><p align="justify">He knew he was hurting her, but she didn't seem to mind the pain.</p><p align="justify">This was by far the hottest fuck they had ever had, and he was struggling to hold his cool. With a delightful moan, she finally came around his cock, and he followed her. Draco spilt himself into her with a low growl, his tie wrinkled in his grasp.</p><p align="justify">When they both collapsed on the dusty ground, he fetched his wand and transfigured a cot out of their discarded clothing. Hermione nestled against his side, and he pulled her close by her waist. Burying his nose in her fragrant curls, he fell into a state of semi consciousness.</p>
