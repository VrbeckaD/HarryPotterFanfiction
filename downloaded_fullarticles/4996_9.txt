    <p>Umbridge walked up to the stone gargoyles and said "Fizzing Whizbees." The Gargoyle jumped aside to reveal the stone staircase. As she walked up the stairs she wondered why Dumbledore would want to speak to her so late at night.</p><p>Today was the day that Professor Trelawney was sacked. Dumbledore was of course outraged with Umbridge about trying to banish her from the grounds. Surely she had expected to be punished, but never this late. She knocked on his doors and after a few moments Dumbledore said "Enter,"</p><p>She opened the door with much struggle. When she had finally given up and pulled out her wand to shut the door she walked in to see Dumbledore sitting behind his desk, as he usually does. Umbridge stepped closer and Dumbledore motioned her to sit, but as if she didn't notice she stood where she was making no movement.</p><p>"I had every right to do what I did, Dumbledore. I am authorised, by the minister himself, to sack any teacher I wish that I don't see as doing a sufficient…"</p><p>"I know perfectly well what you have in authority, Dolores. Alas, that is not why I have called you here tonight." Dumbledore Interrupted.</p><p>"Why am I here then." Umbridge said after a few moments.</p><p>"People think, at my age, that I do not have much endurance left. It just takes the right person to bring it out of me."</p><p>"What are you talking about?"</p><p>"You are that person, Dolores, one of the very few."</p><p>"Are you saying what I think you are saying?"</p><p>"That depends. What do you think I am saying?"</p><p>"I think you are saying… sex."</p><p>"Then we are on the same page."</p><p>"But Dumbledore, I have heard… accusations of your sexuality, that you are…"</p><p>"They are only part true. The only person I loved before you was my dear friend Grindlewald. He was all but giving in our relationship. I can find pleasure from a wide variety of things.</p><p>"You see, I like a woman who can take charge, someone who won't take anything from anyone."</p><p>Dumbledore stood up at walked in front of his desk, face to-to face with Umbridge. Umbridge shook nervously. She had thoughts about the headmaster before, but only the late night fantasies, nothing being this real.</p><p>"Well, what do you say, will you be with me?" Dumbledore whispered leaning in closer.</p><p>"What about the sound? I'm a loud fucker."</p><p>"This room is perfectly sound proof, with some of the most powerful known charms on it. Little known history of Hogwarts… This was the founder's orgy room."</p><p>He grabbed Umbridge around the waist and brought her in closer.</p><p>"Yes," She rasped, caught off guard by Dumbledore.</p><p>Dumbledore leaned in and kissed her for what seemed like hours to Umbridge. It was better than she had ever imagined, his lips tasted of some of Honeydukes best sweets. This was by far one of the best kisses of her life.</p><p>Dumbledore broke off and stepped back, he gestured to his many instruments. "Why don't we start with one of these," He said "They're the best magically enchanted sexual toys in Britain. So well disguised, but even better for the pleasure."</p><p>"Oh Dumbledore," She flustered "I never knew you were so… kinky."</p><p>He smiled. She looked through the shelves and finally settled on a nice shiny silver one that resembled a small sneakoscope with mirrors sticking out on either end.</p><p>Dumbledore crossed the room and removed it from it's shelf. "An excellent choice. I've heard many great things from those who have borrowed it. Pomona seems to be borrowing it every other week. And I won't even tell you how many times Minerva has asked for it. Don't worry, I clean all my toys." Umbridge looked very satisfied with her decision, anticipating it.</p><p>She returned to Dumbledore's desk and cleared off a space which she then sat upon. Dumbledore moved in close to her and started kissing his way down her body. When he was finally on his knees he slipped back her pink skirt. He poked in one end of the device to her soaking privates. She gave a great gasp of enjoyment. As soon as it entered it felt as if it enlarged and moved itself to her utmost enjoyment, like it could read her mind. She edged him to keep going, further and further, harder and harder until she experienced one of the most intense and greatest orgasm of her life.</p><p>She leaned back on the headmaster's desk. "Oh, Dumbledore you really know how to work it down there. Mhhmmmm."</p><p>He took the instrument out of her and placed it on his desk. He reached inside her robes and took out her wand. He took her wand and proceeded to thrust it and out of her. Something about using her wand as a dildo seemed to make it even more enjoyable for her. He started doing various charms while the tip inside of her to make the experience all the better.</p><p>He finally took out her wand from her vagina and placed it in her anus as a butt plug. Dumbledore resurfaced so that she could see him while she lay back on the desk. He leaned down to kiss her deeply again. She could feel a bump in his robes against her body. "Oh, Albus, is that a wand in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?"</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>"Maybe it's both." He said sensually, standing up again.</p><p>"Oh, headmaster, show me what you can really do with that wand of yours."</p><p>"As you wish."</p><p>Dumbledore threw his beard behind his back and undid his robes revealing his already massive erection. "I don't think that will do, not for the pleasure of such a tough woman." Dumbledore removed his wand from his sleeve and pointed at his genitals. "Engorgio. Erectus Gigantis."</p><p>Umbridge looked up and saw his even bigger penis bulging in her direction. "Now, headmaster, please! Please, do me now!"</p><p>Dumbledore bit his lip and slipped his magically enlarged penis in her still soaking wet pussy. She gave another gasp of pleasure and Dumbledore gave a large sigh of relief and pleasure. He started thrusting harder and deeper into her.</p><p>"Oh, Dumbledore!" She screamed. "Now I really know why they call you headmaster!"</p><p>"Oh, Dolores, yes!" Dumbledore moaned.</p><p>Thrusting harder and deeper he picked her up and they moved up the stairs onto the railings.</p><p>"The unbreakable vow! The unbreakable vow!" Dumbledore screeched on each thrust.</p><p>They were tightly entwined, seeming to hold on to dear life, never wanting to let go of each other. It was as if the other were their source of life. They moved their way around the office doing it in as many different places and positions they could.</p><p>"I thought you and the minister, Fudge, were in an intimate relationship." Dumbledore said soon after moving up against his office doors.</p><p>"What Cornelius doesn't know doesn't hurt him." She panted in reply. "Don't stop, no talking, just keep going."</p><p>It was three hours later before Dumbledore released his load inside of Umbridge. Dumbledore had set a charm so he could keep going as long as possible. They lied back on the ceiling where Dumbledore had put a Temporary Sticking Charm on them so they could do it on the ceiling.</p><p>"Oh. Dumbledore. I don't think I will ever be the same again. I think you tore my insides."</p><p>"Well that's an easy fix. Utero Reparo." He said, pointing his wand at her belly. That should do for now. Madam Pomfrey always gives no questions asked care to teachers, she should fix you up perfectly."</p><p>"Good. Dumbledore, tonight was glorious, but you must never tell a soul."</p><p>"Never." He replied looking deeply into her eyes as they both knew if anyone ever knew it would be the end.</p><p>"We must do this again." Umbridge said after a long pause, still breathing heavily and moaning slightly."</p><p>"Mmmm" sighed Dumbledore.</p><p>Meanwhile, Harry Potter had been sleepless that night, and took out the Marauders Map to see if anyone had been doing anything suspicious. That is when he saw the names of Dumbledore and Umbridge rolling around in the headmaster's office. Harry went to investigate under his trusty invisibility cloak. He had been listening to the last 10 minutes of their adventures. When they seemed to have quieted down he silently opened the door and saw Fawkes sitting on his perch looking at the ceiling on the other side on the room. Fawkes looked to Harry with a quite depressed, horrified, scared look. A single tear rolled down Fawkes face, but some how he didn't think the tears would heal this pain.</p><p>Harry had only heard of the theory of memory charms as they were too advanced for him. Though he knew he would have to concentrate and do his best for this moment, for he never wanted to remember this moment, ever. He brought out his wand, pointed at his own head and said "Obliviate." He cast the spell with so much might that no form of counter spell or Occlumency, not even the Elder Wand could bring back the memory.</p><p>Harry recovered from his dazed look and realized where he was and wondered why, maybe he was sleepwalking. He shrugged it off and walked back to the common room none the wiser of what had just happened.</p><p>Back in the Headmaster's office Dumbledore looked at his wrist, "Look at the time, Dolores. I think it is time for us both to be off to bed.</p><p>"Yes." She replied. "Oh, Albus, one more thing." She pointed towards her stomach.</p><p>"Oh yes, of course." Said Dumbledore. "Fetus Deletus."</p>
