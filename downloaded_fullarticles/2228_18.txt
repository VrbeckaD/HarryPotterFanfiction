    <p>Chapter 1- Family?</p><p>It was dinnertime and the Great Hall was filled with the inhabitants of the Castle. The sounds of excited chatter and laughter echoed throughout the Hall. Excited to see their friends again after the summer holidays.</p><p>As usual, Severus Snape sat at the head table, head held high in all his hooked nose glory, scowling down on everyone, while ignoring Minerva McGonagall as she prattles on about something or other.</p><p>"Severus are you listening to me?" asked McGonagall "you have to…"</p><p>She didn't get to finish what she was about to say, as right in the centre of the Great Hall a woman appeared. The entire hall gasped in shock and surprise. The boys stared in awe by her mysterious beauty,while the girls watched in envy.</p><p>She looked to be in her early twenties with a porcelain like face, that was somewhat luminous and delicate, with her high cheekbones. Her perfectly arched eyebrows. Her eyes were a piercingly sharp shade of greenish gold, framed by long dark lashes. Her nose perfectly crafted and dainty. Plump blood red lips. Her entire face framed by long ebony black hair that fell to her hips like curtains. She was tantalizingly beautiful and seemed to give off an air of not only seduction but also power and danger.</p><p>Everyone just stood staring in stunned silence as they drank in every detail of her beauty. She moves forward towards the head table and everyone could not help but notice how she carried herself. With such confidence and elegance. Slender hips moving seductively.</p><p>The same thought ran through everyone's minds as she continues her advance closer to the head table. 'She's like a queen, high and regal'.</p><p>Everyone was so captivated by her they did not notice Snape standing up until he was standing in front of her.</p><p>"Athanasia" Snape said grabbing her shoulders and checking her over for injuries "Are you alright, where are the children?"</p><p>"Severus I'm fine" Athanasia replied "and the children are behind me. I had them hide themselves. Come on out" She called and two small children a boy and a girl, who looked about six or seven appeared.</p><p>Everyone who was watching their interaction with curious eyes,turned their attention to the two children only to gasp in surprise for the second time that night as they saw how much like the woman they looked;the same unearthly beauty and compelling aura, both children held an air of maturity around them; The little boy with his jet black shoulder length curls and his brunswick green eyes that appeared black and bottomless at first glance. The girl with her pale skin, pink lips and her long black curls cascading down to the small of her back, but most of all her pure obsidian black eyes that seemed to penetrate the souls of everyone she looked at.</p><p>Both children looked around the Great Hall impassively before their eyes met Snape’s and the cold expressionless masks melted from the children's faces at the sight of him.</p><p>"Daddy" both children shouted as they ran forward to hug Snape.</p><p>"Hey" Snape said as he picked up the two children,completely dropping any remnants of cold-heartedness.</p><p>"We missed you daddy" the little boy said</p><p>"I missed you too Dom and you too Rae" Snape said kissing both children's foreheads.</p><p>"Severus my boy, what's going on?" Dumbledore asked coming to stand in front of Snape; wanting to find out what's going on.</p><p>"Albus, this is my family" Snape answered</p><p>"Your family? I thought you were an only child" Dumbledore enquired confused.</p><p>"I am.This is.." Snape began only to be cut off by the woman</p><p>"Hello you must be Albus Dumbledore" the woman said receiving a nod from the confused Headmaster "My name is Athanasia Moirai Snape" she continued taking Dumbledore's hand and shaking it "I'm Severus' wife and this is our Son and daughter"</p><p>"Hello I'm Dominic Samael Snape and I'm six years old" the little boy said</p><p>"And I'm Calamity-Rae Snape and I'm also six years old" the little girl added when Dumbledore turned to look at them gapingly.</p><p>"WHAT!" everyone in the great hall shouted after finally coming out of shock at the idea that these people were actually the 'greasy git's wife and kids'</p><p>Dumbledore was still looking stumped at the idea. He just stared at them wide eyed until he realised something.</p><p>'How the hell did he get to marry her'</p><p>‘She’s so Hot!’</p><p>'She's looks so young' people were muttering amongst themselves</p><p>"Those are some interesting names there. Quite negative" Dumbledore stated coming out his shock and ignoring the gossiping inhabitants of the great hall.</p><p>"Ho...How so Albus?" McGonagall asked him speaking for the first time though she was still staring wide eyed at the small family.’If you look properly you can see that they’re a mix of Severus and that woman.How’d this happen?’</p><p>"Athanasia means Deathlessness in other words Immortality, Moirai is Greek meaning Fates like the three goddesses who were the incarnations of destiny, then there's the boy's name Dominic meaning Lord, Samael was the name of a fallen angel, the Angel of Death the destroyer famously known as The Grim Reaper." gasps were heard and mutterings began "The young girls name is more forward and blunt Calamity-Rae which simply means disaster or black sheep" Dumbledore explained.</p><p>"Yes our names are quite frightful and ambiguous aren't they?. I blame my father for corrupting me when I was naming them" Athanasia replied with a small smile that looked so innocent it was scary.</p><p>Dumbledore did not look convinced after all this woman had just bypassed Hogwarts wards; which are known to be the strongest wards ever built,erected by the founders themselves and re-enforced by every Headmaster since. She must be a very powerful being.</p><p>"Oh and who is your father?" he finally asked</p><p>Athanasia looked at Dumbledore with amused eyes as she answered.</p><p>"You may know him head master he is quite popular and an old student of yours. Tom Marvolo Riddle" she answered with a look that would have been described as innocence if her eyes weren't shining in amusement.</p><p>Ok I wrote it from scratch and is only trying to translate what's happening in my head onto paper and it is not an easy thing to do so give me time. Also I don't have a beta so forgive me this is only a test fic and I probably won't get to finish but what the hell it's worth a shot.</p>
