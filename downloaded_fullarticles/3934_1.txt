<p>Oral Fixation</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Must I remind you, we’re supposed to be on holiday.” </p>
<p>“We are. It’s just a…working holiday.” </p>
<p>“There’s no such thing! By definition, a holiday’s time you’re <i>not</i> working. This was some idiot Ministry employee’s idea, isn’t it? And since you’re incapable of saying no—”</p>
<p>“I can say no!” </p>
<p>“Not that I’ve seen.”</p>
<p>“I can! I said no when they wanted to make our new dress uniforms teal.”</p>
<p>“Please. They weren’t serious. Anyway, stop changing the topic. We’re supposed to be relaxing on holiday.” </p>
<p>“Give me twenty minutes. I promise there will be no more work if you let me finish this report and send it in.”</p>
<p>“Fine.” </p>
<p>“Thank you.” </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Stop hovering! Can’t you take a nap or something?” </p>
<p>“I was curious. Wait! It’s a report on local floriography? How did they know where we’d be spending our holiday?”</p>
<p>“…” </p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>“I let slip where we’d be going.” </p>
<p>“So, to be clear, you requested a holiday, and when you got it, got assigned to do a report about local flora in the place you’d be visiting so someone else could have a free weekend?”</p>
<p>“Draco—”</p>
<p>“Sounds like abuse to me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not being abused! Hopkins was supposed to do it, but he hasn’t had time, and when he heard we had a holiday planned in the vicinity, he asked if I’d—”</p>
<p>“What? Spend your holiday doing his job? Of course he did. And because you’re <i>incapable of saying no</i>, here you are!” </p>
<p>“I’m almost done! If you’d stop talking and let me finish, we’d have the rest of the weekend to ourselves.” </p>
<p>“You want me to stop talking? Fine.” </p>
<p>“Brilliant. Thank— Wait, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Has it been that long?”</p>
<p>“<i>Draco</i>? Oh, Merlin!” </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Oh fuck, your mouth—!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Mmm.” </p>
<p>“I can’t believe you did that!” </p>
<p>“Why not? I love sucking your cock, and you love me sucking your cock, it’s a win win.” </p>
<p>“You and your oral fixation—”</p>
<p>“Are you complaining?” </p>
<p>“Definitely not.” </p>
<p>“Wait, where’s my report?” </p>
<p>“I sent it. Wasn’t it done?” </p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“Oops. Well, maybe next time Hoskins will do his own work.” </p>
<p>“Hopkins!”</p>
<p>“Harry? I don’t care. Now, I believe you owe me a suck.” </p>
<p>“Fuck me.” </p>
<p>“If you insist—”</p>
<p>“Draco!” </p>
