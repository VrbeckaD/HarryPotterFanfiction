    <p>Hermione was <em>pissed</em>.</p><p>
  <span>She looked around. This definitely wasn't supposed to be where she landed. She was surrounded by trees, and could see a village in the distance. No way to be certain from her observation point, but she was pretty sure it was Hogsmead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sighed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She definitely wasn't supposed to be here. But let's hope she was supposed to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>now</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She decided to start walking toward the cave she remembers was nearby. Ironically, it was where Sirius spend some time in hiding during her fourth year, to be near Harry. Her heart constricted at the thought. To be in such proximity to the castle stirred a lot of painful memories, and she closed her eyes to stop her tears from falling. She had cried enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pain down her throat seemed to resonate in her entire body. She had screamed so much during the jump. She could barely remember anything besides pain and screaming. She was almost emptied of her energy, and she prayed that the cave was as close as in her memories. Hermione feared that her legs couldn't hold her for much longer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was still on the defensive, though. Years of being on the run printed that reflex too deep in herself that a bout of fatigue would change that. She also didn't forget that she was in the Forbidden Forest. Even if she was not in a time of war, that was still something to be wary about, and she dearly hope that she wasn't in a time of war anymore. To think that all of this would have been for nothing.. But no, of course not. It had to have worked. She wouldn't be there otherwise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not allowing her thoughts to discourage her, Hermione finally arrived to the cave. It was small and inconfortable, but at least it was dry enough that she could hope to sleep and rest for the rest of the night, and be more rested to start planning in the morrow. She flicked her wrist, her wand apparating in her hand, vibrating with the magic of the rituel still. A small smile appeared of Hermione's face before she started casting the most secured blood wards she knew. She guessed that she would have to stay here for a while, so it wouldn't do to skip on the security – as if she would, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, she detached the bag that was strapped on her back, having switch the too noticeable beaded bag for a more advanced and practical backpack. She took out a hammock, and fixed it to the walls of the cave. That ought to do for the rest of the night, she'll add a more comfortable living space tomorrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione closed her eyes, willing to fall into a dreamless sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione woke up at dawn the next day, her body still hurting from everything she'd been through and from the tiredness she had accumulated over the last few years. She was very young still, but she had been through so much that it sometimes felt like she was a hundred years old. Her eyes opened, and she lay still, gazing at the ceiling for a while, trying to shake the worries and fears clouding her mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, time to act,'' she grommeled to herself while standing. "Kreacher !"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The old elf appeared with a pop. Her heart contracted. If he was here, alive, and she could summon him... It must have worked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Little Miss called Kreacher ? But Kreacher doesn't know the little Miss, no, he doesn't..." he said, twisting his hands, his discomfort obvious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hello, Kreacher. It is nice to see you. Calm down, please. Try to focus on your magic."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione had spent a long time researching family magic, after all. She knew of the bound the House Elves had with their families, and how they could sense the magic in them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sure enough, his already huge eyes went even bigger. "Little Miss is a Black ? Kreacher is honored to meet the Little Miss, but he doesn't understand, no, he doesn't..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Focus, Kreacher. Come on. It's not that complicated, I'm sure you will figure it out."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Little Miss is a Black, but... Not from now ?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's right, Kreacher. Well done. Listen to me, I have to ask you not to reveal to anyone that I have called you. It is of the utmost importance that nobody now of me yet. I must also ask you how is your master Regulus."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Master Regulus is very well, Little Miss from after, miss !"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please, call me Hermione. Well, that's good news. Very good news." She let out a sigh of relief. She was not too late, at least : that had work correctly. "Kreacher, I must ask you something else. If it's at all possible, can you bring Regulus here without suspicions of the rest of the family ? I really need to talk to him."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Kreacher will check right away, Miss !" And at that, the House Eld disappeared with a crack.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione decided to use her time waiting by putting down the hammock, and starting a fire at the front of the cave. Her parents always told her that breakfast was the most important meal of the day, after all. By the time she had finished preparing some eggs and bacon, a young man appeared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The young woman sitting next to the fire was quite striking. She didn't look up, even if she had obviously sense him coming. She was obviously a witch, if her clothes were anything to go by. Under a casual robe dress, she wore a most intriguing costume of skintight matte black leather. Dragonhide, if he had to guess, but he had never seen some that dark. He wondered from what type of dragon that might be from. There was a wand holster at her right arm, and another at her ankle. Signs of a fighter, he noted distractly. Her skin was quite dark, and her curly hair was braided away from her face. She was petite, but a feeling of power emanates from her. Definitely not someone he would want to cross in a fight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Who are you, witch ? Why would Kreacher send me here ?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She deigns raising her face, then. She really was pretty, but that's not what Regulus noticed at this moment. Her eyes were a steely grey. He knew this eyes. Those were Black eyes, same as his. Well, this morning seemed to be getting quite interesting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hello. My name is Hermione. I think you might be interested in what I have to say. Would you like some food ? It is still quite early, after all."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The young woman - Hermione - stood up, quite ungracefully, and presented a plate of food to Regulus. Wordlessly, he took it, but didn't sat down. Something was making him uneasy about that place. He let his gaze wander while the woman resumed eating. Something at the entrance of the cave caught his attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The wards... Is that blood wards ?" He choked out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hummed. "Indeed. Notice anything else ?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"They are Black wards."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How ? Are you from a disinherited part of the family ? Cedrella married the Weasley, you don't seem the type. Uncle Marius, maybe ? But you're a witch, he is just a squib. He wouldn't know the ancestral magic."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She snorted. "Not a Weasley, what makes you say that ? Not redheaded enough ?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked at her dark skin with obvious discontent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Answer me, witch."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Fine,” she sighed. "You don't know me, because I'm not from here. You should sit down, this is likely to take a while."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus may not be as hot-tempered as his illustrate brother, but he was still defined by his curiosity. He sat down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What I'm about to tell you is a long story and, quite frankly, is difficult to believe. If it makes things simpler, you may call Kreacher. He will be able to confirm at least the most pressing concern you seem to have about my identity."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If he was surprised by her advice - most wizards disregarded elves - he didn't make it obvious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"My birth name is Hermione Jean Granger. I was born in 1979, or I will be, I suppose. A few days from now, if everything happened correctly. My birthday is on the 19th of september. May I ask what day it is today ?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A look of suspicion passed on Regulus face, but he replied anyway "It's the 8the of september, 1979. I'll need to hear more, if you don't mind."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course. Well. In the summer of 1999, I was -will be ... Eugh, this is more difficult than I anticipated. I'm sorry. I was blood adopted by the last living member of the House of Black. I was then sent here to prevent a lot of things from happening. Strangely enough, it seems to start with you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What... Blood adopted ? This is dark. You shouldn't tell me this like that. This seems to be quite the tell, Miss Granger. I don't know who put you up to this, was it Sirius ?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sighted. Well, that's nothing they hadn't anticipated before sending her back. She pulled a newspaper from her backpack and gave it to Regulus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was dated from August, 1999. The screaming headline read in bold letters : "Supreme Leader successful ! Last Mudbloods Send to their Death in Azkaban, Country Finally Purified !"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked up in shock. "What is that ?! It could still be a false."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, it's not like I didn't see this coming. Kreacher, please come here !"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mistress Hermione called ?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Indeed. Might you be willing to tell Regulus about who I am ? I know you can't lie to him."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mistress Hermione is a Black, Master Regulus, but not from now. Mistress Hermione is from after, Master Regulus, Sir."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus was clearly distressed. This was a lot to take in. He finally sit down, looking pensively at the woman in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, if it starts with me, I think you should tell this story, Miss Granger."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Right. I know you have been researching for the Dark Lord since you left school. Impressive NEWTS records, by the way. Quite a nice work you've done, with the Inferis, I have to say. A simple wand movement instead of a long rituel... How very clever. But soon, your Lord will ask you for a favor. He will want Kreacher for something, and that will end your cleverness for ever. Luckily, I'm here !"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At that, she smiled. It made her look a bit deranged, as if she hadn't smile in a while and had loose the habit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus did not respond for some time. He stood frozen, his brows furrowed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>« You must know I have been... disenchanted by the Dark Lord policies for a long time now. He retranched himself in magic too dark to be sustainable. He is losing grip with reality, only trying to quench his thirst of sacrifices to appease his ever growing dark side. I would not speak of this with anyone, but you seem to know that already. I have succeeded in only participating in the ravels as little as was necessary, and in being seen as better used as a researcher. But don't think I didn't catch what you said earlier, about having been adopted by the last of the Blacks. How ? »</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The idea clearly pained him. She knew family was everything for the standing members of such a Noble and Ancient House. Well, the sane ones, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Fine. I'll make this quick, please don't interrupt me. The Dark Wanker has actually made Horcruxes. That's probably what tipped his remaining sanity down the drain. And yes, you heard right, Horcruxes plural. His goal is to separate his soul into 7 pieces."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus, a most dignified and composed wizard in most occasions, </span>
  <em>
    <span>gasped</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know. You would have found out sometimes at the end of this year, and died trying to get to one of them. Quite heroic, really, but you didn't tell anyone else. In consequence of that, your mother's sanity will crumble, leading to the death of your father. The cause is unsure, but most likely poison. No idea why, sorry. Anyway. The fight between the Dark forces and the Ministry and the Order calm down for a while, and pick up in 1981, when a lot of pureblood families are decimated, even some of the Sacred 28. The war culminated with the death of the Potters and the disappearance of the Dark Lord. Sirius will be sent in Azkaban."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the first time, her voice crack, and she seems to have trouble keeping her emotions in check. Regulus seemed frozen, not a single emotion appearing on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So, you see... To help the House of Black, our House, from descending into oblivion, I will need your aid. And I will need you to help me destroy the Dark Lord."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All Regulus could do was stare.</span>
