    <p align="justify">It was a dry Wednesday morning at Godric's Hollow and Mrs. Potter was hustling in the kitchen making various kinds of treats for her son. James Potter was going to Hogwarts for his first year and was very excited and had got ready before anyone in the house even woke up. He went to the kitchen calling for his mom and said, "Mom!! I'm so excited! I'm sure I'll be sorted into Gryffindor like Dad!!". His mom smiled and said, "Of course you will son! I also hope you'll take a special interest in Potions as our ancestors invented quite some useful Potions." James didn't like the idea of Potions much and kept quite at his Mom's comment. He forgot all about it as he saw his Dad bringing his pet owl. Her name was Swoops. James loved Swoops very much! He'd got her only 2 days back and already loved her immensely. "Good morning Euphemia! Good day Son! Are you ready to go?", Mr. Potter asked. "I've to give him a lot of food to eat on the train Fleamont! James, get your trunk, I'll put all these in." Mrs. Potter said. James grinned at his parents and went to get his trunk. It was a bit heavy and he felt dejected that he couldn't levitate his trunk as Underage Wizards were not allowed to perform magic outside school.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Soon the Potters were ready, and they assembled in front of the fireplace. First Mr. Potter went into the fireplace, taking some Floo Powder with him and announced, "King's Cross Station!", while throwing the Floo Power in. He disappeared in a swirl of green flames. Euphemia and James followed suit and soon the family was at King's Cross Station on the platform nine and three-quarters where the Hogwarts Express was waiting.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Meanwhile, in a dark street of London, at No. 12, Grimmauld Place, Mrs. Black was screeching at her elder son "Sirius!!! Get your trunk here and have breakfast! Don't you ever do anything properly!?" Startled by the screechy voice of his mother, little Regulus peaked out of his bedroom. As soon as Mrs. Walburga Black saw her little son, her demeanor changed, and she started talking to him in a sweet and loving tone and asked him to go back to sleep. Sirius scowled at his Mother and went into the kitchen to have his breakfast. His Dad was reading the Daily Prophet, with his breakfast laid out on the table. "Good morning Dad", Sirius greeted him with no feeling of a <em>good</em> morning. Mr. Black grunted his greeting and started eating. Sirius sighed and sat down for his breakfast. Today was not going to be a good day.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Soon after breakfast, all the Blacks assembled near the ornamental silver jewelry box which served as their portkey. The box was permanently fixed in the center of their dining table when it was turned into a portkey. Regulus was excited for his brother going to Hogwarts, but the same excitement wasn't seen on Sirius's face. Mrs. Black called to the others to touch the portkey. They all did and were swooshed away to King's Cross in seconds.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Far away from such hustle and fanciness, a weary looking Mr. Lupin was trying to convince his son, who was crying and hiding under the bed, that it'll be alright to go to Hogwarts and that he'd already made arrangements with Dumbledore. But poor Remus, though he felt reassured that his father had spoken to Dumbledore, had his own fears.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Nonetheless, he urged himself from under the bed and stood up. "It's gonna be okay Remus. Don't worry. You'll even make good friends" said Lyall Lupin. "Okay Dad", answered Remus, thinking just the opposite. He couldn't even imagine the idea that somebody would want to befriend him. Soon, they were out in the street and his father stuck out his wand. And with a loud BANG the Knight Bus appeared to take them to King's Cross.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Far away from all this Wizarding scuffle, two more young children were getting ready to go to Hogwarts for the first time. They were not the same kind of magical children like James, Sirius, and Remus who were Pure bloods. One of them was a Half-blood wizard and the other was a Muggle-born witch.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">The young Half-blood wizard, called Severus Snape, was very much troubled. His parents were fighting over him once again. He hated his father so much already and ever since he had gotten 'the letter', his father had become even more unbearable and he had started to hate him even more if that was possible.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Nonetheless, he was looking forward to going to Hogwarts, and that too, with Evans. He was jerked out of these thoughts by his mother pulling him towards the door. "Come Sev, let's get out of here! I just can't bear this anymore!!!" screeched his mother and tugged him out into the street. Mrs. Eileen Prince turned towards her son and said, "We're going to Apparate. Hold on tight Sev!". As soon as she said this, Severus clung to his Mother's hand as though clinging on for dear life; and soon he felt the familiar tug at his navel, was swooshed into thin air along with his mother.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Very near to this place, Petunia Evans was having a tantrum. She couldn't tolerate her freak sister going to the freak school and she having to go along to King's Cross to drop her off. Lily was constantly urging Petunia to stop so that they could go to the station on time. "Tunie please! Let's go! I can't miss the Hogwarts Express! Please!!! Lily cried. "Hmpf! I don't care about your freak school you freak! I'm not going! I'll stay at home you go!", Petunia scoffed.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Lily was heartbroken at this and went to tell her mother. Petunia started crying silently as she went to her room. He opened her drawer and glanced at the letter she had got from the Headmaster of Hogwarts - Albus Dumbledore. As soon as Lily had gotten her letter, she had written to Dumbledore to accept her too at Hogwarts. Dumbledore had endearingly replied that she did not have magic in her and hence she couldn't be a witch.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Mrs. Evans opened the door and urged Petunia to come with her and told her that her father and sister were already seated in the car. Resigned to her fate, Petunia followed her mother out of the room.</p>
