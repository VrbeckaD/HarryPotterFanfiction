  <i>13th, November, 1988</i>
</p><p>Well, hell. No, no, it wasn't that bad. He'd arrived two years before he'd meant to. He had wanted to arrive in the fall of 1990, to give himself a little time to do some necessary things and apply for the DADA job, so he could watch over young Harry just a little easier. The fall of 1990 would have given him just enough time and not too much. Too much time could be devastating for the timeline, overall. This could work, though. At least he hadn't gone so far back as to when his parents were still alive.</p><p>Harry sighed. Okay, so...he wasn't exactly in the year he'd meant to aim for, but this wasn't bad -- it was okay. He had work to do, and he'd just...wait. He'd wait out the timeline and fix things that didn't need to be so precise. </p><p>He looked carefully through his bag, just to make sure everything had made the trip with him. After checking thoroughly, he then checked his person. He still wore the charmed and imbued necklace of agate, azurite and tourmaline. He had a little hourglass in his left pocket, a wand strapped (in a holster) to his hip, Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder in his right pocket, and the Elder Wand in a holster on his arm. Only...the Elder Wand wasn't there. Harry took a long, deep breath. He could work around that; he still had his secondary wand (yew, eleven inches, phoenix feather core, inscribed with sigils, tipped in bloodstone). He'd get the Elder Wand back, eventually.</p><p>What could he change first? Sirius! He could focus on Sirius and Pettigrew -- that wouldn't change too much, because there was no way Dumbledore would let Sirius raise young Harry. It wouldn't help Dumbledore's plans or machinations or the greater good.</p><p>What was the best way to capture Pettigrew? Introduce himself to the Weasleys and get invited to dinner. Harry knew that the twins would start Hogwarts in September of the next year (1989), which meant that Percy was already at Hogwarts. So, bumping into them in Diagon Alley next year could work. He could go to Hogwarts, but just showing up there for no reason would be suspicious.</p><p>In order to get started with what he deemed as his mission to fix things, Harry apparated to Diagon Alley. He had a vault to open, a house to secure, an application to file and arrangements to make. There was still so much to do.</p><p>***</p><p>Gringotts had gone as smoothly as it could have -- and better, in some respects, than he'd expected. Little Harry's blood was not on file, as of yet, so there'd been no matching there -- but Goblin magick had detected that he was a Time Traveler. However, since gold and treasure and family was all they were really loyal to, they didn't care. His blood linked him to the Potter line as a direct descendant and successor. Since everyone but the child was dead, it made him the Patriarch of the Line and the rightful Lord and Heir.</p><p><i>Evan Linfred Potter Blackwell</i> inherited the Potter and Peverell Gringotts vaults (of which there were four), the Potter Manor in Stinchcombe (along with its six House Elves), the Potter Cottage in Godric's Hollow (of which he would have to fight for, but since he knew what was in store, he had the Goblins point him in the direction of a barrister), and a ten percent stock-holding in Sleekeazy's. There was also one Black vault (Dorea Black) that he now owned as well. Dorea's vault had been a surprise, but he'd realized quickly that when Sirius had gone on the run in the original timeline, the Goblins must have assigned him any remaining, unclaimed Black vaults. Young Harry wouldn't have known to claim it, and by the time he'd turned seventeen, it would have been dumped into the larger Black vault. Some of its assets were familiar to Harry, but not all.</p><p>Harry deposited his funds in a new vault (only linked to Evan Blackwell) and had the Goblins reclaim any outstanding property, goods or funds for the Potter and Peverell Estates, and then set up a withdrawal book (like muggle checks or muggle credit cards) as well as a monthly accounting (they'd send him a list of transactions each month).</p><p>Lord Blackwell-Potter would take one Wizengamot seat, hire a proxy for the Peverell seat and live in Potter Manor. Hopefully, if luck held out, Professor Blackwell would teach Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Izor, the current Potter accounts manager at Gringotts, had sent his application and letter off for him, for which Harry...er, Evan...was grateful.</p><p>During his shopping in Diagon Alley, Harry made one, immutable, irreversible decision. He purchased a young, Juvenile, Snowy owl and named her Hedwig. He had recognized her instantly and inquired about her at Eeylops Owl Emporium. The clerk had been nice, but not really knowledgeable. They didn't know where she'd come from, exactly, but she'd been too young to be on her own and had been in the shop for several months. She'd reach adulthood, or maturity, in about two years -- but probably wouldn't want to breed for a whole year after that.</p><p>She'd hooted at him conversationally and he'd fallen in as much love as he had the first time he'd met her. He couldn't leave her there. Besides which, saving Hedwig was one of his goals and young Harry having her -- she stood out way too much -- was one of the reasons she'd died.</p><p>***</p><p>It had been three weeks since he'd applied for the Dark Arts post, and he'd finally heard back from Headmaster Dumbledore, who was eager to meet with him.</p><p>Harry pushed open the large, wrought-iron gates and stepped onto Hogwarts campus. He breathed in the familiar air deeply and grinned. He'd missed it. </p><p>He wore professionally tailored dark-blue wixen robes, his long, black hair pulled back in a loop at the base of his head, a thin beard covered his jawline and chin, and a sprinkling of undetectable glamour potion covered the thin, white scar -- all that was left of the curse-scar of his youth. He'd padded his clothes around his hips just a little and had shadowed his eyes very subtly with makeup.</p><p>As he headed in through the front doors, he slipped the hourglass and the little vial of murky brown liquid out of his pocket.</p><p>He turned the hourglass over once while muttering a word in Irish to activate it. Everything came to a halt. Time stood still, except for Harry, everything on his person and the hourglass. He broke the vial, smashing it on the floor. The potion spilled out and, as it hit the air, it vaporized and then Hogwarts was, for a moment, blasted with eerie grey light.</p><p>Satisfied that the hex was broken, Harry vanished the broken glass and then deactivated the hourglass with another word, this time in Greek. Time began at its normal pace again and Harry made his way to the Gargoyle that blocked the Headmaster's office.</p><p>***</p><p>"As you might be aware, Mr. Blackwell," Albus Dumbledore said quietly, "Professor Arrend's contract is up at the end of the school year, in June and she has no desire, whatsoever, to renew. Your application is not only timely, but quite impressive."</p><p>Evan nodded and gave a quick smile. "Thank you, Headmaster."</p><p>Albus leaned back in his chair. "Why is it that you wish to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts?"</p><p>"I think there's a lot to be prepared for," Evan responded. "Children, teens and young-adults all need to have a solid grasp of what is Dark Arts and what isn't. They also need a well-rounded education in creatures, creature law, jinxes, hexes and curses. If they don't get that in school, they'll get it elsewhere -- and often in unsavoury ways."</p><p>Albus nodded, cleaned his glasses for a moment and then said, "Would you care for a lemon drop?"</p><p>Evan smiled, but shook his head. "Never developed a taste for them."</p><p>"I have done some thorough checking on your experience and answers on your application. I can't find you anywhere in England before a few weeks ago, but I am aware that you are related to the Potters, is that correct?" Albus asked.</p><p>Evan nodded a bit enthusiastically. "Enough to very much please the Goblins, in any case. James and I are cousins - though the family tapestry doesn't show the connection."</p><p>Albus raised an eyebrow. "No, it doesn't. No matter, these things get lost sometimes, and the Goblins are nothing if not diligent." He tapped his fingers on his desk. "It's difficult to get accurate records from India, but your reviews and certificates are impressive. Why did you want to come back to England? You seem like you'd have risen through the ranks in Jaadooan."</p><p>"It's my home. I wanted to come home," Evan replied.</p><p>Albus clapped his hands together. "I'll need you to be here by 18th, August. I will have to approve of your syllabus and books for the school year, but how you teach will be up to you. As long as you teach the students what they need to know to pass exams, that's all that really matters. Will you be comfortable living here during term time?"</p><p>"You're offering me the job?" Evan asked.</p><p>Albus smiled. "Yes. I see no reason not to. A year-long contract, with my approval of your syllabus and book selection. You'll have quarters here, on the staff floors, and you'll teach the first through third year students. Do you have any questions?"</p><p>"Will I be working with the other members of my department, or are we all more separate?" came Evan's first question.</p><p>"The department head, which as of this moment is Professor Winters, reviews the syllabus of all of the Defense professors to make sure there's no overlap other than review. She'll let you know if there's something that needs to be changed, after I've approved it," the Headmaster explained.</p><p>"And what is the payscale?" Evan asked.</p><p>"You will receive a salary of 200 galleons a month, for a total of 2,400 galleons a year - that is the starting salary. It's the equivalent of, I believe, $3,000 pounds a month. Deputy Headmistress McGonagall will meet you on 18th, August, in the enterance hall and provide you with a tour, a map, a tour of your quarters and any rules or directions needed," Albus explained. "Staff meetings are mandatory, as is hall monitoring at night. You'll be given a schedule."</p><p>"Sounds great. I look forward to getting started," Evan said as he rose from his seat. "Are there forms to sign?"</p><p>Albus pushed forward a stack of parchment and lifted up a quill pen. "We're glad to have you."</p><p>As Evan signed all the papers, it occurred to him that he'd have to spend the first few weeks pretending he didn't know where everything was. The strangest thing, though, was that in this timeline there was more than one Defense teacher. He wondered how they'd been getting around the hex with that, if Albus expected Professor Winters to still be the head of the department by next fall? </p><p>Well, he was here now. The hex was broken, he had a promising new job, some work to do for it, a house to settle into until August and he wasn't going anywhere -- except to capture Pettigrew. He was determined to see his plan work.</p><p>***************</p><p>TBC</p>
