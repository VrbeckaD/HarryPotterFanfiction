          <div class="userstuff"><p>We two make home of any place we go;</p><p>   We two find joy in any kind of weather;</p><p>Or if the earth is clothed in bloom or snow,</p><p>If summer days invite, or bleak winds blow,</p><p>   What matters it, if we two are together?</p><p>   We two, we two, we make our world, our weather.</p><p><br/><b><em>—</em>Ella Wheeler Wilcox, </b> <b> <em>We Two</em> </b></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It isn’t supposed to happen like this, but sometimes things happen when you’re on the run.</p><p> </p><p>Emotions run high, panic sets in, and there’s that thrilling sense of euphoria when you escape by the skin of your teeth. Running like there's tomorrow, because maybe there won't be one.</p><p> </p><p>Afterwards, when you’re laughing and holding onto each other and trying not to fall down where you stand, there are shared glances and shared memories. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      Can you believe that just happened?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>              No, no, I can’t. We were almost caught! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      Well, we weren’t. But it was a very close call. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>              It’s lucky you were there. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      Same. Same. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>There’s a lot of handholding and quiet times, especially when the night is so dark that not even candles can banish the shadows. The sun seems especially weak, as though it’s fading away next to the horrors pursuing you. The cold is such that not even fire or magic can charm it away; it's in your bones—it comes from that sinking feeling deep within you; it's there to make your teeth chatter, chatter, chatter.</p><p> </p><p>The only spot of brightness is the person with you; if you let go of their hand, it almost seems like you’d be swallowed by the blackness completely. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      Where are you? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>              Here. Here. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      I can’t— </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>              I’ve got you. Hold my hand. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      Hermione… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>              Tighter. Tighter. </em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Even when you should feel safe and surrounded by others, you feel disconnected somehow. Like the levity and raucousness around you is happening to someone else, like they’re someone else’s Pensieve memories, and you’re just walking around in them like an invisible and intangible ghost. There’s only that one other person who’s not one of them, and it’s the only person who understands how you feel when you catch their eye in a crowd. </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes you feel like you’re talking to them across the distance, without any magical means.</p><p> </p><p>Just you. Just them.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      This food is so much better than what we had. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>              Can you believe how much food there is here?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      We could have used some of these spells. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>              You should eat more. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      You too. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It almost seems inevitable what happens after that, as though everything that came before this was divination that you completely missed. Hints that you ignored. Foreshadowing that you dismissed. </p><p> </p><p>In the dark of the night, when everyone’s asleep, snuggled into the kind of rest that comes with living in a house with four walls and a host of other people to protect you, there’s only them. Walking towards you. Slowly. Softly. A wand held up to illuminate the angles and slopes of their faces, as though you wouldn’t have been able to paint them with your eyes closed.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      Couldn’t sleep? </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>                   </em> <em> Yeah. You? </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      I’ll have years of sleep to catch up on if I’m still alive after this. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>                  Oh, Harry… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      Just hold my hand. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>                  Always. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Was it always inevitable, you sometimes wonder? If not for this war, for the things that went before, for all the things that were set in motion before you even existed—would this be where you ended up? </p><p> </p><p>With you. With them. With the two of you against the world.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      Thank you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>                For...what?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      For being there when no one was. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>              I’ll always be here for you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>      Same. Same. </em>
