    <p>Blaise Zabini wasn’t a person who liked to speak a lot. He preferred the silence than the company of other people. Ever since he was a young boy, his mother taught him how to be selfish and it wasn’t a bad thing. If he wanted something then he would try his hardest to get it. If something was taken from him, then he would fight whoever dared to steal from him and would get it back. Blaise prided himself in being a possessive person. He didn’t like to share. Especially when it came to his boyfriend, Draco. He had met the other boy when they were both but seven years old, at his mother’s third wedding. They immediately bonded and became friends. Their bond seemed to grow more and more by each passing year, until Draco asked him out when they were both 14 years old. Blaise could still remember that day clearly. He could still remember how nervous the blond appeared, demanding to go out with him, claiming that Blaise has always been his. </p><p>Now at the age of 17, Blaise was glad that it was his last year of school. After that, he would be able to train to become a Dragons Tamer. While the job clashed with his usual aloof personality, he did have a soft spot for Dragons. They did remind him of his lovely boyfriend, and he would enjoy taking care of these majestic creatures while having a quiet and peaceful life. </p><p>Taking a bite of his breakfast, his eyes followed his boyfriend who was sitting next to him to ensure that he was also eating. It wasn’t that Draco didn’t eat. Oh no. Draco had always had an appetite for food but Blaise still wanted to make sure that everything was alright nonetheless. After seeing his boyfriend take a sip of his juice while speaking with Pansy, he let his eyes wander to the Gryffindor table. </p><p>He could see the smaller boy clearly from his seat. Long, unkempt raven hair that was tied behind his head. Dark circles surrounding those beautiful green eyes. A frown placed on what appeared to be the softest lips he had ever seen. Somehow, he always found himself staring at Potter. The boy had captured his attention ever since he saw him on their first day at Hogwarts. Back then the boy had been different. His hair was short and neat, his face bright with a smile, no shadows haunting those eyes. He couldn’t for the life of him understand what had happened to Potter. The boy didn’t even appear to be keeping his personal hygiene in check anymore. There was something wrong with the Gryffindor. He had watched him as the years went by and he became a mere shadow of the child he was. He noticed the food that was being pushed around in his plate. Potter was never eating; preferring to play with his food instead. </p><p>Blaise could feel a hand placed gently on his own, and he turned to focus on his boyfriend. </p><p>Draco smiled softly. “You’re staring again.” </p><p>Blaise simply rolled his eyes. He knew his boyfriend was not jealous of him staring at Potter. It was a game for them; catch the other person staring at Potter. He kept looking at his boyfriend as he saw Draco glance towards the Gryffindor table with a frown on his face which turned into a quiet growl. </p><p>He didn’t know why they were both bothered with glancing at the Lion. They have never spoken a single word to him ever since they first saw him.  </p><p>He was startled when he felt a tug on his arm, and found himself hauled from his seat by Draco. </p><p>Once they were out of the Dining Hall, they held hands and started walking towards the Potions Lab. </p><p>“Merlin!” snapped Draco. </p><p>“Hmm?” was Blaise’s response. </p><p>“I want to understand, Blaise,” said Draco in frustration. “I don’t know Potter but I still want to know what’s happening. How is no one noticing? The boy is fading slowly and no one even seems to care. And WHY am I so bothered about this? It’s not like I know or care about him.” </p><p>Blaise kept his silence, unsure of what to say. He did agree with Draco that the situation wasn’t ideal. Why had no one noticed Potter’s clear lack of self-care? The smaller boy used to be a bright child with many friends surrounding him, but it seems that at some point he had distanced himself from everyone and shut them out. What was happening to him, and where were the adults in his life to notice? </p><p>“Calm down, Love,” murmured Blaise as he pushed Draco gently close to the wall, his hand running through the blond hair softly, trying to comfort him. </p><p>After he felt his boyfriend calm down, he leaned in for a kiss only to be interrupted by a body smacking into him. </p><p>Turning around, he saw Ron Weasley who was now on the ground, getting up and dusting himself off before throwing them a death glare. Blaise snorted. He didn’t really care for Weasley and his lack of manners didn’t annoy him. </p><p>He saw a small figure exiting from the Dining Hall. Potter was hurrying their way while keeping his head down and scratching his arm. </p><p>Draco stiffened next to him and Blaise took hold of his hand immediately, squeezing softly to reassure his lover and well him to be calm. </p><p>The raven boy didn’t even glance their way as he ran past them. </p><p>----- </p><p>All Harry Potter could think of at that moment was the fact that he needed to hurry to class. He wasn’t late, but it was always better to be present before the class started filling in. When he noticed from the corner of his eyes the two Slytherins standing few steps ahead of them, he bit his lower lip and quickened his pace. He felt as if he was suffocating. He reached the Potions Lab and opened the door so quickly that he startled the person inside. </p><p>“POTTER!” screamed Professor Snape. “What kind of entrance is this? Have some respect!” </p><p>Harry lowered his head in shame as the Professor yelled at him, and mumbled an apology. He wasn’t in the mood to start fighting with someone very early in the morning. </p><p>“What was that?” asked Professor Snape, not hearing what he said. </p><p>“I’m sorry, Sir,” apologized Harry. “I did not mean to startle you.” </p><p>“Take your seat and be quiet,” snapped the Professor, clearly not wanting this conversation to continue, which Harry was glad for. </p><p>He took the seat on the back that was next to the window and stared outside. Hagrid’s Hut could be seen from there and he could clearly see a creature he has never seen before lying outside of the Hut. Hagrid always had some sort of creature with him, which Harry liked to observe. They were always very fascinating. He often went to that Hut to play around with the creatures when he was younger. He sort of missed doing that. </p><p>As he heard shuffling, he focused his attention on the class once again as the students were filing in. His Housemate, Ron, took the seat beside him while he sighed dramatically. </p><p>“I forgot my book in the dormitory and had to run all the way to get it before I was late to class,” said Ron as he looked at Harry who simply rested his head on his palm and looked back at him while chewing his lower lip. </p><p>Ron shrugged and started speaking with another person. </p><p>Harry tensed suddenly once he felt eyes on him. Glancing around the room, his eyes locked with Draco Malfoy. A boy he never really spoke with before. He kept staring at him and blinking, and all he could think of were Malfoy’s eyes. They truly were captivating. Blushing, he turned his head to Professor Snape who started barking at students as usual, trying to ignore the eyes that he knew were still locked on him. </p><p>The class went as it normally does. Professor Snape shouting at Gryffindors and praising Slytherins. Harry didn’t mind all of that as long as it wasn’t his turn this time. The Professor seemed to pick a new target to torment every other day and after today’s incident, the last thing he wanted was to be humiliated by the Potions Master. While the man didn’t, thankfully, signal Harry out each time, he did have a habit of mentioning his father everytime he did so. There was a history between them but Harry didn’t know what kind of history. He never knew his parents or anything about them. </p><p>He suddenly started feeling dizzy and touched his head to keep it from spinning. Shaking his head, he hoped nothing would happen so that he doesn’t cause any scene. The last thing he wanted was to bring attention to himself. Tightening the muscles in his stomach, he could feel the beginning of hunger. He tried his best to focus on what his professor was saying. </p><p>Once the class was completed, Harry left the room, glad that he had an hour break before his next class started, and headed outside. He really needed some fresh air. </p><p>“Harry!” a voice shouted behind him. “Harry, wait!” </p><p>He turned his body towards the sound only to find Hermione Granger. </p><p>“Yes?” he asked softly. </p><p>“Harry, I’m glad I caught up to you,” she said, trying to catch her breath. “You seriously walk so fast! I wanted to ask if you want to be my potions assignment partner. I know that you’re good at brewing, and with me being able to write the project it would be a good deal for both of us. We can help each other out.” </p><p>Harry groaned, and cursed himself when Hermione noticed his groan and flinched slightly. He really didn’t want to upset her. While he enjoyed working alone, it was required of him to find a partner for this assignment, and Hermione WAS one of the best witches in their year. </p><p>“Okay,” he responded. </p><p>“Great!” she exclaimed, and he watched as her face beamed at him with a wide smile. “Should we meet today after we finish all classes? In the common room?” </p><p>“That sounds good,” said Harry. </p><p>“I’ll see you later then,” Hermione said and paused for a bit. “Are you okay?” </p><p>“W-what?” the question did startle him. </p><p>“I noticed that you didn’t eat much today,” she said then blushed. “I mean--- I only noticed because you were sitting right in front of me. Not that I was staring at you or anything!” </p><p>He thought it was a bit endearing how she fumbled around and tried to justify her worry. He wasn’t close with the girl, but she has always been nice and respectful towards him. </p><p>“I’m fine,” he responded. </p><p>Silence fell around them and she turned away in disappointment. </p><p>“Thanks!” he blurted out which caused her to tense, turn to face him, smile, and leave. </p><p>He didn’t know why he thanked her. He didn’t like the attention but somehow it made him feel warm that someone asked him how he was doing. </p><p>Harry walked towards the lake to find a spot for him to sit and read his book while he waited for the next class to start, however he froze in shock at what he saw in front of him, mouth gaping wide open. </p><p>----- </p><p>Draco Malfoy was on edge all day. He wanted to scream and punch someone. Everything was frustrating and he was on edge all day. It was bad enough that he hadn’t slept the night before, and on top of that his godfather, Severus, shooed him out of the Potions Lab when he wanted to talk to him, claiming that he was going to be busy grading papers, and that if Draco needed anything he could come back later. </p><p>He made his way out of the school to go and find Blaise, sitting under a tree with his wand and books thrown around him. </p><p>Once his lover’s eyes turned to him, Draco felt himself calm down. Blaise always had that effect on him. </p><p>He sat down and leaned against his boyfriend, locking his arms around Blaise’s waist. </p><p>“I love you so much,” muttered Draco with a sigh. He would never be able to explain how much he loved Blaise. Blaise was his whole life. </p><p>“I love you too, my beautiful snake,” replied Blaise. “What happened?” </p><p>“I wanted to speak with Severus about Potter’s condition,” said Draco. “The least thing we can do is to tell one of the adults, and I know Severus would take this seriously and look into the whole matter, but he shooed me out without hearing a thing!” </p><p>Blaise chuckled as he noticed the pout on his lover’s face. </p><p>“You will have the chance to speak with him again later,” responded Blaise. He didn’t want to discuss Potter anymore. He just wanted to spend a relaxing time with Draco while they both had the chance. </p><p>He pushed Draco to the ground to lay on his back and started kissing him softly, and when Draco started responding to the kiss, he deepened it. They started making out, hands running through both their bodies; teasing, pinching. </p><p>Draco groaned as one of his hands pulled on Blaise’s hair. “Touch me,” he commanded breathlessly. </p><p>Blaise complied and unzipped the other’s pants and took his erection in his hand, softly tracing the whole thing with his fingers. </p><p>“Stop teasing me!” growled Draco which made Blaise smirk. He loved it when his boyfriend was so needy. It was rare for Draco to give him full control without a fight first. They always faught for control in their relationship which made it very hot in Blaise’s opinion. </p><p>Just as he was about to give his boyfriend what he wanted, he heard a gasp, and turned his head to the noise immediately, ready to shield Draco away. </p><p>As his eyes locked with a rather shocked Gryffindor, he immediately pulled away from Draco, who had frozen in his place. </p><p>“S-sorry!” came Potter’s squeak. “I-I didn’t see anything. I’m sorry I disturbed you. I, uh, I was just looking for... for a place to read. Oh, Merlin! I’m sorry. I’m just going to go.” </p><p>Blaise watched in amusement as Potter kept babbling. This was the first time the smaller boy has ever spoken to him and he found himself enjoying this. He liked that the other boy’s attention was for once on him. </p><p>“Merlin!” he heard Draco curse. Draco had already zipped his pants and sat back up next to Blaise. </p><p>“I’m sorry again!” the Gryffindor blurted. “I’m just gonna go!” </p><p>As he turned away, Blaise heard Draco call out, “Potter, wait.” </p><p>Potter froze on his spot and turned back. </p><p>“Y---” Draco tried to speak. “We...... just.... I.....” </p><p>Blaise was amused by his boyfriend’s reaction. Draco didn’t stutter much and had always had a silver tongue that got him out of any awkward situation. </p><p>“What Draco is trying to say,” he decided to step in and save his boyfriend, “is that it’s not your fault you saw us in this situation. It's our fault, really. For even attempting to do this in the open.” </p><p>He watched, fascinated, as both Draco’s and Potter’s faces turned red. </p><p>“With that being said,” Blaise continued. “Please forgive us for putting you in this situation.” </p><p>After an awkward silence, Potter walked off silently without responding.  </p><p>“Well, this was weird,” said Draco with a blank face then started laughing. “Merlin, you should’ve seen the look on your face, Blaise!” </p><p>“Oh yeah?” retorted Blaise with a smirk, “at least I wasn’t the one who showed his junk to a Gryffindor.” </p><p>“HEY!” shouted Draco as he slapped his boyfriend’s arm. </p><p>Despite the embarrassment this situation caused him, Draco still felt happy somehow that he spoke with the boy he had his eyes on all these years. Potter had always been soft-spoken and Draco found it nice that for once, it was directed at him. That blush was also adorable! He tried to think of something else since he didn’t want to think of Potter. What was the point of all this pining if he was never going to be his anyway? Draco was sure that once they perform the Bonding Ritual, him and Blaise would be declared mates. There was no doubt in his mind. It wasn’t a possibility. Draco was happy and confident that Blaise was going to be his; but a small part of him always wanted the green-eyed boy to be his as well. </p><p>“Oh, before I forget,” said Blaise, cutting Draco’s thoughts. “I wanted to invite you to my mum’s wedding.” </p><p>“She’s getting married again?” Draco asked in disbelief. “And when were you planning on telling me?” </p><p>“She sent me a letter yesterday,” laughed Blaise. “You’re my date, of course.” </p><p>“As if anyone else would want to be your date knowing damn well that you’re mine,” smirked Draco. </p><p>Blaise huffed and laid down, his head resting on Draco’s knees. </p><p>“You do know we have class soon, right?” Draco arched his eyebrow. </p><p>“Just for a bit.” </p><p>Draco picked up his notebook and decided to read the notes he had written in class while his lover relaxed. </p><p>----------- </p><p>Harry Potter made his way to one of the corridors inside the school and sat on one of the benches, trying to calm his beating heart. He didn’t mean to walk in on someone being THAT intimate; and on top of it all, it was the two Slytherins who always gave him lingering looks wherever he went. </p><p>After few minutes of him trying to calm himself down, he sat quietly and kept looking at the people as they were walking around. He was so glad that he would soon finish school and then he wouldn’t have to deal with other people. He would probably get a normal, small job in the Muggle world and live his life peacefully. No one was going to control him anyone and he was going to do as he pleased. If he would have his way, he would spend the rest of his miserable life sleeping and never waking up or dealing with people. It was better that way. People didn’t want to befriend him anyway. He was just a freak, and freaks shouldn’t cause any troubles to anyone. </p><p>He took a look at his schedule just to double check and saw that he had Transfiguration along with the Ravenclaws this time. He liked that house. The students that belonged to it weren’t as nosy as the rest and weren’t as loud. On top of that, they focused on their studies and in addition, made wonderful study partners. Luna Lovegood was his favorite out of all the students. She was a bit weird and quirky, but she also respected his boundaries and never pried on his business. Not to mention, she always had something interesting to say. </p><p>His thoughts took him to his relatives and he wished he could stop thinking about them. He was away from them and knew that they would never give him a second thought, so why was he thinking about them now when he was away? </p><p>His Uncle Vernon was probably at work around this time. His Aunt Petunia would be either at one of the neighbors’ houses gossiping or making a new kind of dessert. He felt a sudden pain in his abdomen and clenched his stomach’s muscles tightly. He could hear as his stomach growled of hunger and tried to ignore it. He didn’t have time to think about that. He needed to distract himself. </p><p>Harry picked up a book and started to read, only for his thoughts to wander once again. </p><p>What was going to happen after he performed the Bonding Ritual? Harry was worried. Who was even going to be his mate, and would the person even want him as a bonded? There was no way anyone would want someone like him, and he himself didn’t want a mate as well. He wondered if he could get away from performing the ritual. Maybe if he pretended to be sick or something. But that would only give him maybe few days until he would be forced to perform it once again. </p><p>He scratched his arm; a habit that stuck with him for years. Everytime he was nervous, his right hand moved immediately to the left to scratch it. It was stupid but he couldn’t control himself. Whoever turned out to be his mate was going to be disappointed. Harry felt disgusting. Nobody was ever going to love him. Was his mate in school? Was he or she even in the same age group as him? Maybe they were older and had a job and a family already. A loving home with a spouse and few children. Was he going to ruin someone’s life? Maybe his mate wasn’t even born yet. Harry would prefer that. At least then he would be left alone like he wanted to. </p><p>“Hi, Harry,” a voice called, making him jump. </p><p>“Hi,” Harry greeted. </p><p>Seamus sat next to him with a sigh. </p><p>“I just had a fight with Dean,” Seamus blurted out. “It was so bad, Harry. He’s refusing to talk to me now.” </p><p>“Oh?” Harry questioned. He didn’t want to sound nosy. </p><p>“Yeah,” groaned Seamus. “It’s all Lavender’s fault. She asked me out and Dean got mad. Even though I said no! Can you believe how childish Dean is being?” </p><p>Harry stayed quiet. He didn’t know why Seamus was telling him this. Maybe he just needed to vent to someone. The other boy knew that Harry wouldn’t really give him any advice or opinion, just like the previous times this happened too. So why was he still trying to vent to him? </p><p>“I heard the headmaster talking to some of the professors today,” said Seamus. “Apparently they plan to perform the ritual soon. It's all everyone in the school is talking about.” </p><p>Harry groaned at that. He was already freaking out about the whole thing without Seamus worrying him even more and telling him that the ritual would be performed soon. </p><p>Glancing at Seamus from the corners of his eyes, he wondered who the other boy would be bonded to. He seemed really close to Dean despite their continuous bickering and fighting. The two boys spent most of their days together, so Harry wouldn’t be surprised if they were mates. From what he could remember, his professor told them before that bonded mates were drawn to each other even before the bond. That is, if they had met before it. It was a pull that they couldn’t ignore. </p><p>He tried thinking of a way out of the ritual again but couldn’t come up with anything. Maybe he would ask Hermione when they met later that day. He had no doubt in his mind that she had learned all she could about it. He had seen her reading a bonding book before. </p><p>It was better that way. If he could get out of it then it would be better. He didn’t deserve whatever love and comfort that could get out from the bond. </p><p>He stood up and walked away without a second glance at Seamus. He needed to get away. Harry decided to go to one of the bathrooms in the school, as he tried to hold his tears in place. The last thing he wanted was for someone to see him cry.</p>
