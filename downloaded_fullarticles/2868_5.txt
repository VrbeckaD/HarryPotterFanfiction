<p> </p>
<p>It would have been a fantastic summer night.  The sky was bright from the waning gibbous moon, the stars winked between each other, dancing through the cloudless air.  Multitude of lights flitted between a hand full of roller coasters, a tilt-a-whirl, a Ferris Wheel, and several other rides that made Remus Lupin slightly nervous.  His nose was bombarded by the sickly odor of deep fried sweets and grease.  His ears pounded with the symphony of carnival sounds, terrified screams of joy, dinging bells and whistles.  He grimaced and lowered his head into his palms, trying to block out the assault on his senses.</p>
<p>“Remus?” a small body plopped onto the wooden bench beside him.  He ignored her, even as she gently rubbed the small of his back.  “C’mon son.  Try to have a good time.”  Hope Lupin was a good mother, sweet and stern at the same time.  She didn’t sugar coat her son’s illness like her husband did, tiptoeing around the subject as if that’d make it go away.  Lyall Lupin stood nearby with a frown, munching on a tuft of pink cotton candy.  His hair was a tawny brown, like Remus’ but streaked with silver.  He too, was tall and gangly and had magical emerald eyes.  And that’s about where their similarities ended.  The accident had turned Lyall cold; he blamed himself and in turn took out that anguish on his family.  Typically, a shy man, he had a temper that could flare at the drop of a hat.  His wife was able to reign in his attitude with a glance, usually.</p>
<p>Remus was intelligent and had his mother’s twisted sense of humor but since his accident, he kept to himself.  “I don’t understand why we had to move here,” he grumbled like the teenager he was.</p>
<p>“This is a good city, love.  And your father’s job promoted him and moved us here.  You’ll finally be able to go to a real school, aren’t you excited?”</p>
<p>“Not the words I would use,” he sighed.</p>
<p>“Headmaster Dumbledore knows of your…. condition.  This school can change your life, Remus,” Lyall said, rolling his eyes in annoyance.</p>
<p>“Sure.  If I don’t eat anyone there.”</p>
<p>“Hush,” Hope snapped at both before they caused an argument and in turn, a scene.  “This is our last hurrah as a family this summer before we ship you off to school and you become too cool for your parents.”</p>
<p>Despite his determination to be in a foul mood, Remus smiled into his hands.</p>
<p>“Go try to have a good time.  I’m taking your father through the tunnel of love, perhaps to give you a sibling.”  Hope wiggled her eyebrows and Remus blanched.</p>
<p>“Yuck.  Please leave.”  He waved them away.  He watched his parents retreating, giggling like they were young lovers again.  It was rare to see them so carefree, especially on the night after a full moon.  Remus rubbed his temples and stood slowly, fighting off the nausea that plagued him with every movement.</p>
<p>A loud voice erupted in his ear, “Oi’ Evans!  Come on!  We need a fourth, we’re an odd number.”  A boy, appearing to be around the same age as Remus, waved erratically at a beautiful red head across the asphalt path.  He shot her a crooked smirk and pushed his spectacles up the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>The girl shot him a murderous look.  “In your dreams, Potter.  Besides, I’m here with Severus,” she gestured to the person beside her.  He had a long, greasy black hair and hook nose.</p>
<p>“We’re way more fun than Snivellus!”</p>
<p>“Please Lily, I’m stuck with these two morons.”  This time it was a short, pudgy boy pleading.  He was rather rodent-ish, with dirty blonde hair and ears too big for his head.</p>
<p>The girl rolled her eyes, grabbed the arm of her friend and stomped away.</p>
<p>“You’re incredibly smooth there, Prongs,” the third boy finally spoke and Remus’ breath hitched in his throat.  The world slowed around him.  He had pale, flawless skin and ebony hair that shimmered like raven’s wings.  His laugh was addictive, a bark and a smirk that sent Remus’ heart straight into his throat.  Feeling eyes on him, he turned to the tawny haired boy eavesdropping on them and sent him a deadly smile.  “Hey there, Scars.”</p>
<p>Remus decided he could die right there, his face heating up.  He subconsciously lifted his fingers to the bridge of his nose where a white, faded scar rested.  The trio looked at him inquisitively.  Remus searched around for his voice, having lost it somewhere between the stormy eyes of the boy and his cupid doll lips.  “Hi,” he finally said lamely.</p>
<p>The first boy took the initiative to step forward, hand extended.  He wore a rugby jersey and tight khaki pants.  His hair flared at every angle, like an untamed monster.  “I’m James Potter.  These are my mates, Sirius and Peter.”</p>
<p>Remus looked down, staring intently at his feet.  “Remus,” he murmured, aware that his hand was also covered in scars of various size.  “Remus Lupin.”</p>
<p>“That’s an interesting name.”</p>
<p>“Says the dude named fucking Sirius,” James smirked at his friend and dropped Remus’ hand.  “Ignore him.  His father is some sort of Astronomer, obsessed with constellations and shit.  He comes from old money, so he lacks basic human decency.”</p>
<p>Sirius laughed again and aimed a combat boot at the shins of James, which was easily dodged.  This time he extended his hand out to the tawny haired boy.  “Care to be our fourth for the night?  We’ve not seen you around here before, you new to the area?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.  My parents and I just moved here last week.”  He shook Sirius’ hand, acutely aware of how rough and warm his grasp was.  When he dropped their handshake, he rubbed the back of his head nervously, his pupils slightly blown out and his heart still residing somewhere in his throat.  “I was homeschooled up until now.  They’re gonna send me to Hogwarts—the boarding school a few hours away? —are you lot in public school?  I’m not quite sure what to expect.  I mean, you lot are the first group of people my age that I’ve ever talked to.  Oh, fuck me, that is not something I should have shared out loud.”  His cheeks flared crimson.</p>
<p>Sirius laughed and punched him in the shoulder, sending a shockwave of post-moon pain down his arm.  He held back his flinch, biting onto his tongue.  “I like you, Scars.”</p>
<p>This time the pudgy boy—Peter—spoke, “We actually go to Hogwarts too.  Most of the kids around these parts do, lots of money to throw at expensive private educations.”</p>
<p>“Come on, I want to ride every coaster at least twice before the park closes,” James said, tugging on the flap of Sirius’ leather jacket.  Remus pulled out his phone and sent a quick text to his parents.</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">Remus: Met some people.  Group of Hogwarts boys.  I’ll catch up with you.</p>
<p align="center">Mum&lt;3: Have fun!  We love you!</p>
<p align="center">Parental Unit: Be careful Remus.</p>
<p align="center">Mum&lt;3: Shut up Lyall.  Let him be a kid for once.</p>
<p align="center">Parental Unit: Why are you texting me?  We are right beside each other.</p>
<p align="center">Mum&lt;3: I want Remus to feel included.</p>
<p align="center">Remus: Omg I’m turning my phone off now.</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>He shoved the device into his pocket and jogged to catch up to the trio.  “—this year my gorgeous motorbike—”</p>
<p>“For fucks sake, Padfoot.  Shut up about your stupid bike.”  James shoved him, causing Sirius to stumble gracefully over his feet.  Instinctively, Remus reached out and steadied him.</p>
<p>“Thanks Scars,” Sirius flashed him a crooked smile.</p>
<p>“You have a bike?” Remus asked, feeling his stomach do a flip.</p>
<p>Peter sighed, “Please don’t encourage him.”</p>
<p>It was too late, Sirius beamed with pride as he prattled on about his motorcycle, burning up the time they stood in line.  Remus hung on to every word.  “I’ll be sixteen this November, so I can actually drive her legally.”  He finished as they climbed into the rollercoaster.</p>
<p>As the night wore on, Remus began to feel as if he’d known these boys his entire life.  It became easy to talk to them, to joke and laugh.  His jaw hurt from smiling so much.</p>
<p>The group hovered around a steel table, stuffing nachos down their throats.  James paced, throwing chips into the air and catching them flawlessly in his mouth.  Peter perched precariously on the table, swinging his feet.  Sirius had turned a chair backwards and sat, resting his head on the cool metal spine.  Remus joined James in standing, only awkward and nervous.  “So.  You gonna tell us about your scars?” Sirius asked bluntly.</p>
<p>“For fucks sake, Padfoot.  Can you fit your foot any farther up your--" James started.</p>
<p>“It’s alright.  I knew you’d ask eventually,” Lupin said, keeping his voice steady, “but I’d rather not go into details.  I was involved in an accident when I was young.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough,” Sirius replied, nodding appreciatively.  “Girls like a man with scars anyway.  Makes you seem tough and mysterious.”</p>
<p>Remus stared at him for a moment and then burst out laughing.  “Yeah, sure.  Minus the fact that I’m sickly.  I’m much more likely to get my pocket money stolen than get a date.”</p>
<p>“Hey mate, you’re one of us now.  No one is gonna mess with you,” James said through a mouthful of cheese.</p>
<p>“Our fourth dorm-mate from last year moved to New Zealand,” Peter said.  “I bet you’ll be bunking with us as his replacement.  Old McGonagall would assign you there if you asked before term starts. Just call up to the school.”</p>
<p>Remus smiled a genuine smile.  “I’d like that. I’ll call first thing tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The three boys exchanged their numbers with Lupin.</p>
<p>A younger boy approached their table, his hair wasn’t as long or shaggy as Sirius' but he had the same eyes and in a few years his jaw would be sculpted much the same as his.  “Hey Siri, we need to get home before mom has a cow.”</p>
<p>Sirius stood and stretched, popping his shoulders and spine.  “Alright Reg, I’m coming.  This is Remus by the way,” Lupin weakly raised his hand, careful to not let the sleeve fall and expose even more of his scars.  “Remus, this is my younger brother, Regulus.”</p>
<p>Regulus eyed him suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Brightest star in the Leo constellation,” Remus offered.  “It also means Prince, or Little King in Latin, depending on the translation you read.”</p>
<p>“Your new mate is a nerd.  Maybe he'll actually knock some sense into you three.” Regulus said before turning on his heel and marching toward the park exit.</p>
<p>Sirius smirked and shrugged.  “As if.  Night guys.”  He waved as he followed his brother.</p>
<p>Remus saw his parents nearby, murmuring to each other and sneaking not-so-subtle glances his way.  “I better go too before they embarrass me anymore than I’ve already done myself,” he gestured to the pair.  “Um, thanks guys for…  you know…  talking to me.”  He walked away before James or Peter could see the blush creeping up his neck and dusting his cheeks.</p>
<p>“They look like nice boys,” Hope said, draping her arm awkwardly around Remus' shoulders; he was a good head taller than his mother.</p>
<p>Remus could tell his father was biting his tongue as he started their car, the engine roaring to life.  “They won’t find out about me,” he tried to reassure Lyall.</p>
<p>The man sighed and ran his fingers through his hair.  “I hope you’re right, Remus.  Just… be safe.  Going to school is your mother's idea.  If I had my way, you’d stay home schooled.”</p>
<p>He felt the anger ticking into his blood stream and he grit his teeth, determined not to fight with his dad.  He pulled out his phone and texted his new friends, tuning his parents out completely.</p>
<p align="center">New Group Message Started</p>
<p align="center">Sirius, James, and Peter added.</p>
<p align="center">Remus:  Wanted to say thanks again.</p>
<p align="center">James: No worries mate.  Feels like we’ve known you forever.</p>
<p align="center">Peter: I'm just glad I’m not the third wheel anymore.</p>
<p align="center">Sirius: you’re definitely still the third wheel, Wormtail.</p>
<p align="center">Sirius: I had fun tonight.  Meet back there tomorrow night?</p>
<p align="center">Remus: Back at the amusement park?</p>
<p align="center">Sirius: Duh, Scars.</p>
<p>Remus looked up from the glow of his phone.  “Hey…  is it cool if I come back tomorrow to hang out with them again?”</p>
<p>“No--"</p>
<p>“Of course you can,” Hope swatted her husband and gave him a warning glare.</p>
<p align="center">Remus: Cool, I'll be there.</p>
<p align="center">James: Sounds good.  G‘night.</p>
<p align="center">Peter: Later</p>
<p align="center">Sirius: Au revoir mes amis.</p>
<p>Later that night, Remus lay wide awake in his bed, flat on his back.  He watched the stars through his window and contemplated.  He ended up falling asleep to the distant sound of barking laughter and the memory of storm gray eyes.</p>
<p>The grass was wet with dew and the air thick with humidity.  Small, bare feet ran, toes squishing into the earth.  Lunar light lit the forest path, moon full and bright.  “Remus!” the voice was far away, deep and with a crisp Scottish lilt.  The laughter danced through the wind</p>
<p>“Can't catch me, daddy!” This was a boy's voice, trapped in the mist.  Giggles floated through the trees.</p>
<p>But then, everything turned heavy.  It was as if the forest froze.  Time stopped.  The little boy slowed, heart hammering.  The color drained from his face.  A bush rustled in front of him.  He took a tentative step forward, swallowing hard.  “Daddy?” he tried to whisper but the noise caught in his throat.</p>
<p>Burning yellow orbs stared through the branches, and the boy's breath hitched as he stumbled backwards, falling hard onto his bum.  A tremulous growl erupted and there was a blur and a flash of gray fur.  Fangs snapped.</p>
<p>Remus Lupin awoke with a start, drenched in a cold sweat.  He clutched his shoulder and side, where his scar was throbbing from the memory.  He trembled and sat up, dawn just beginning to creep through the sky.  He resigned to his fate, swinging his feet out of bed, knowing that sleep would evade him after that night terror.</p>
<p>He padded around the house until his parents got up a couple hours later and put him to work.  Chores helped pass the time and the hours melted away.  Early evening, Hope drove Remus back to the amusement park, stuffed a few bills in his hands, and waved him off.</p>
<p align="center">Remus: I’m here.</p>
<p align="center">Sirius: Sweet, just us for now.  Meet me at the Ferris Wheel.</p>
<p>For the first time Remus saw Sirius in the light.  He felt his heart start hammering all over again.  Sirius Black was tall, not quite as tall as Lupin—who towered over most at 6’2”.  His skin was pale and just as flawless as it had been at night.  Today he wore tight, black jeans with a chain attached to the side.  His t-shirt was well worn, almost threadbare, and a vintage Metallica logo scrawled across his chest.  He wore the same combat boots, polished black and steel-toed.  An intricate tattoo peaked out from his shoulder, a Celtic knot with looping and detailed vines.  Remus briefly wondered how he’d managed to snag a tattoo at his age.  “Hey Scars!” Sirius broke Lupin out of his trance.  “Prongs and Wormtail are about two hours out.  I couldn’t escape my family fast enough.”</p>
<p>Remus rubbed the back of his head, causing his tawny hair to spike.  “Why do you call them that?  And they call you Padfoot?”</p>
<p>He smirked, shaking his hair out and pulling it back into a loose bun.  A few strands fell around his face.  “It’s a long story.”  He shoved his hands into his pockets.</p>
<p>“Let’s go get in line.  Let’s try to get in the very front of the coaster.”</p>
<p>“Hell yeah!” Sirius threw his fist into the air.</p>
<p>Two coaster rides later and the sun was beginning to set.  Sirius' hair was barely contained in the tie any longer, black locks falling to his shoulders.  They met the other two boys at the entrance gates and the night was over in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The boys spent nearly every day at that park up until their term started, eating junk food, laughing, scaring themselves silly.  Remus had never experienced so much fun before, and he found himself latched onto his new friends like a lifeline.</p>
