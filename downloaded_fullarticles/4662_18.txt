    <p>
  <span>Newt sat in the lobby of the hotel waiting for Tina. Things had been going well between them: he had returned to her with a copy of his book as promised, back in August, just in time for her birthday- and with just a bit of help from Queenie and Jacob, things had taken off from there. Between many letters and a few visits when they could manage it, it seemed the next step would be happening sooner rather than later. At least he hoped so. Not tonight, but hopefully in a few weeks. Though tonight might be important too. Tina had hinted that she felt ready for the next physical step…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She was running late. They were in Paris for work-related reasons, after all - well, Tina, mostly. MACUSA, the British ministry, and the French ministry had teamed up to deal with some heavy Grindelwald activity on the continent. Newt was there merely in an advisory capacity, because it was well known that Grindelwald was trying to use magical beasts in his arsenal, and of course, if he got a hold of an obscurial, things could get very bad very quickly. So though Newt wouldn’t see much action unless necessary, he was working in Paris too. It was quite nice that his and Tina’s work coincided this time - they had seen each other almost every evening for the last two weeks. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He heard the whoosh of the doors opening and looked up expectantly - but it wasn’t Tina. Instead, he met a pair of dark eyes that had once been just as familiar and captivating as Tina’s dark eyes now were, but these eyes did not make his heart flutter anymore; rather they made his blood run cold. He was over her, but it still hurt quite a bit, especially with her standing right there in the flesh. Before he fully registered what was happening, she slid into the seat across the table for him, the one that was supposed to be Tina’s, whenever she arrived. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Newt sighed. “What do you want, Leta? I know you want something with me. You always do.” He knew now what Queenie had meant when she’d called Leta “a taker”. Everything was always about her and her own self-interest. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Can’t a girl catch up with her school days sweetheart?” she simpered. She had barely aged since school and she was as beautiful as ever. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Newt was working overtime to remain calm. He thought he was doing reasonably well. “Leta, there’s no going back. You caused a lot of damage, and I’ve moved on. I now have people in my life who actually care about people other than themselves.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s all in the past, really. How do you know I haven’t changed for the better?” she eyed him piercingly.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Even if you have,” he replied steadily, “there’s too much bad history. We’re best off going our separate ways.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“There’s a new witch, isn’t there?” It was a rhetorical question. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes. We met while I was traveling in the United States. I’ve never been happier. Now</span>
  <em>
    <span> please </span>
  </em>
  <span>bugger off, if you will.” He hoped he hadn’t sounded too rude, but since meeting Tina, he’d learned to stand up for himself more, and he was done with Leta forever and needed to make that clear. In fact, now he couldn’t wait to tell Tina: he knew she still harbored some jealousy. He hoped he could now put it to rest for good. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Leta stared at him for a few moments, as his sea green eyes blazed with confidence. She hadn’t anticipated this new Newt, one who stood up for himself and who repelled her charms that had once captivated him so. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, if you’re sure,” she stood up and walked over to him. He stared at her, wondering what would happen next. She bent down and placed a slow, languid kiss on his lips. Newt stiffened, and then quickly recoiled. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Goodbye, Newt,” she whispered in his ear, floating away before he could say anything. As she left his line of sight, his eyes fell on Tina. She had seen (how much, he didn’t know), but hadn’t heard. He could see the look on her face. She turned away and ran out the front doors. He jumped up and ran after her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Tina, wait!” he called out, “it’s not what you think, please give me a chance to explain!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Forget it, Newt!” she choked out as tears streamed from her eyes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Please, Tina, just let me-” but she let out another sob, and then disapparated, leaving Newt standing in the street alone and distraught. He considered going after her. True, he didn’t know where she’d gone, but it was a good bet that she’d gone back to her hotel, to be with Queenie. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He debated with himself whether or not to go there, to knock on the door and beg to see her, to speak with her. But...he and Tina had quarreled before and he knew she sometimes needed her space, and that during those times, she preferred the company of her sister. He decided to talk things through with Jacob first. Jacob was the one who always helped him through sticky social- and romantic- situations. In fact, it was Jacob who had helped him navigate the beginning of his relationship with Tina, and through the few bumps they’d had since. Yes, if Tina was crying on Queenie’s shoulder, he should go get a drink with Jacob. And so he apparated to the muggle inn where he knew Jacob was staying. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>-------</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m sorry to hear, pal,” Jacob put his shot glass down and sympathetically patted Newt’s shoulder after he had finished telling him everything, “but the good news is, this is easily fixable.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“How?” asked Newt incredulously, still nursing his muggle scotch. Not as good as firewhiskey, but it hit the spot.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“For one thing, you’ve done nothing wrong,” explained Jacob, “so you just need to give your side of the story. If anything, she should be happy you got rid of Leta for good!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, that’s what I was hoping, but she didn’t allow me to explain. And what if she doesn’t believe me?” Newt gulped down the rest of his shot, and Jacob ordered another round. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, I believe you. I’ll vouch for you,” Jacob stated emphatically, “and Queenie will know the truth as soon as she sees ya. She’ll insist that Tina hear you out, and she’ll back you up if need be.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Newt was beginning to feel better already. Hopefully Jacob was right and this whole thing would be cleared up in no time. “So, what do you say we finish this round and go over there?” he suggested.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Nah,” said Jacob, “sometimes people need to sleep on it. The world looks better in the morning. Give it the night. And bring a gift - flowers or chocolates or something.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Newt nodded, taking in every word, making a note to pick up chocolates first thing in the morning - Tina wasn’t really into flowers. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, Jacob, I’d best be off,” Newt nodded at him, “and thank you. Really. You truly are the best friend I could ask for.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Aw, thanks pal!” Jacob clapped him on the back, “It’ll all be good! I’ll come by Queenie’s in morning to be there if ya need me. And here-” he handed him one last shot, “one more for the road!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Newt took the shot and then headed out to a side street to apparate back to his hotel.  Jacob had sure seemed  hopeful that it would all be smoothed over tomorrow, so Newt felt it too. He still had trouble sleeping, of course. It wasn’t easy calming down after what had just happened between him and Tina, even if it was fixable. He tossed and turned and played out his plan for tomorrow in his head a hundred times before falling into an uneasy, fitful sleep. </span>
