    <p>        Dan was a mess today. The second year, engineering student was running all around the dorm looking for the papers he had made the night before. He kicked trash out of the way as he moved towards the closet, reaching in and looking around in it. </p>
<p>       “What’s up?” His roommate Gavin asked from across the room.</p>
<p>       “I forgot the team signup forms. I can’t find them anywhere!” Dan said, exasperated.</p>
<p>       As Dan continued to frantically go through his closet, Gavin stood from his bed and walked over the shaking sophomore. He grabbed him by the shoulders and quickly wheeled him around to face his desk. Sitting there, surrounded by empty cans and dirty plates, was Dan’s printer. Sticking out of the printer was the forms. Dan silently cursed himself as he did so. </p>
<p>       “Right there, buddy,” Gavin laughed. “Also, you should probably shave before we go. What if some cute girls show up?”</p>
<p>       Dan rolled his eyes, checking his budding beard. He had joked about growing out a beard before, but he wasn’t quite ready to make the leap. Considering the few weeks it would take, he would look like he never slept, he agreed to shaving. </p>
<p>       As Dan walked into the bathroom, Gavin quickly pulled out a few signs and one of the plastic sticks they had made. It was sleek in design and had a falcon painted as it went up. They called this a broom and Gavin would need it today to show off. </p>
<p>       After a few minutes, Dan emerged from the bathroom, clean shaven. Gavin held out the forms to him. Dan took them and Gavin grabbed the bigger signs as well as the broom. With that, they didn’t want to keep Troy waiting. If he was in one of his usual bad moods, then being early would make sure he wasn’t mad at them.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>	       Arriving outside the student center, Dan and Gavin were caught in the hustle of the event they were attending. Every fall, Crawford State University would host a massive event where every single organization and team would recruit members. This was all free and ran by the school, but each organization was able to manage their own table. It was outside and today was a beautiful day for it. Music was played over loud speakers and everything was covered in Crawford State colors. Since the incoming freshman were told about this event, it was typically the best time to catch new recruits. That was exactly their plan as they saw that Troy already had a table.</p>
<p>	       They were one of the team organizations for a sport. Typically, the usual sports weren’t found here, only student ran ones. They had all done a sport in high school but hadn’t moved on with it. Dan and Gavin were both formerly soccer players as well as track runners. Their tall, muscular bodies really showed off their abilities in a physical sense. They both were about six feet tall, but Gavin insisted he was slightly taller than Dan. Although they were above average population when it came to physical prowess, they paled compared to Tony.</p>
<p>	       Tony Shoeman was a monster of a man. Standing a little under seven feet tall, the man was anything but gangly. His hair was much lighter than the browns of Dan and Gavin, but that was all that was lighter. He often wore much larger shirts than he needed. He had a bit of a belly, but this was a ruse. Underneath those oversized shirts was a strong man. He wasn’t particularly fast, but that had never been a problem for them. </p>
<p>	       Dan and Gavin walked over to the table, noticing that Tony had his signature scowl on his face. </p>
<p>	       “Took you long enough, most of the other organizations are already setup,” he growled in his deep voice. “I brought the hoops and ball bag.”</p>
<p>	       “Sorry, this guy couldn’t find the forms,” Gavin said, immediately throwing Dan under the bus.</p>
<p>	       Dan shot him a look and Gavin just smiled, slipping away to setup the signs. Turning back to face Tony, he handed over the papers. Tony took them, looking at them as he did. He set them down on the plastic fold out table. Since the altercation appeared to be over, Dan slipped behind him to setup the hoop. </p>
<p>	       A few moments later, a familiar voice called out to them. Having finished standing up the hoop, Dan turned to see his favorite twins coming.<br/>
       James and Jamie, the two were quite a pair. At once, basketball stars, they weren’t given any chance in college because of their size. Both were under six feet tall and rather skinny with James having a bit more size than Jamie. They had joined the team almost solely for fun, since being brother and sister, they hadn’t played on the same team before. Their team chemistry was fantastic, and they were quickly assigned to the same position to work together. </p>
<p>       “Oh look, fashionably late as usual,” Tony said, rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>       “Well, she had to do her hair,” the blond male said, pointing at the female.</p>
<p>       “You slept through your alarm. Don’t blame me, sleepy head,” the female replied in kind by pointing back. “Look at his hair, it’s clearly matted. You didn’t even shower!”</p>
<p>       The twins lived off campus with their parents. It was a great resource during their study sessions. Dan and Gavin had met them in their first year of college last year. All four of them had been a part of the newest engineering class at Crawford State. After a few long nights in the dorms, the twins had invited them over to their house to study. Their house was nothing short of a mansion. Their parents were clearly well off. Add that onto the hospitality their mother exuded, and it quickly became the groups favored study spot.</p>
<p>	       With the gang all here, Tony sighed. </p>
<p>	       “Only five returning players from last year,” Tony said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>	       “It could be worse,” Gavin said. “It could be five players and no girls.”</p>
<p>	       “You always know just how to sweet talk me,” Jamie replied, dryly and the whole group laughed.</p>
<p>       “Well, we have nine spots on the travel roster. Since this is your first year of recruiting, I will give you guys the low down,” Tony said, passing a few papers out to people. “As the only senior left on the team, I’m the only one who has done this before. We need to get out name out fast. Open with the sport. Usually we will get a good number of nerds, but if you explain what it is, we are likely to get some good players.”</p>
<p>	       The team nodded. With that, Tony flipped over their massive sign on the front of the table. It rolled out to reveal, in all black and gold, the Soaring Falcons Quidditch team.</p>
<p>	       Quidditch was a fictional sport, originally played in magical books by a great author. However, as people got older, they adapted the rules so that even without magic, anyone could play it. It had quickly taken root in the northeast of the United States and across Europe with many teams playing based on World Cup rules. With that, the collegiate scene had taken off. The Blue Mountain Conference was a specially made conference just for Quidditch teams. That is where the Soaring Falcons came in.</p>
<p>	       The Soaring Falcons was the name of the Quidditch team for Crawford State University. Some teams were comprised of multiple universities while others may have multiple different colleges. For everyone, the rules were simple when joining. You had to be a registered student in college, be at least eighteen years old, and be younger than twenty-four. You also only had four years of eligibility. There were exceptions, but players would have to fill out paperwork for U.S. Quidditch. </p>
<p>	       The strategy would be simple to get new members. Dan, Gavin, and James would spread out across the crowd, sending people back to the table. At the table would be Jamie and Tony. Tony, because he was the team captain; Jamie, because she was the only girl on the team. It was always hard to attract girls, so having one as their face was useful.</p>
<p>	       With that, they dispersed. Dan went towards the front of the event, near the parking lot where students would be coming. Dan went towards the dorms while James went towards the student center.</p>
<p>	       As he placed himself at the entrance to the long line of tables, Dan started shouting out about the Quidditch team.</p>
<p>	       “Quidditch?” A duo of girls shouted out, giving Dan excited looks as they approached him.</p>
<p>	       Dan sized them up as two Hispanic girls approached. They both looked to be a smaller than Jamie, and he silently sighed. Size wasn’t everything in Quidditch, but it helped. Still, one of them was athletic looking. She reminded him of a few of the girls’ soccer players in high school. Long, tan legs that flexed as they walked. Dan shook his head as he quickly looked her in the eyes. She either didn’t notice him staring at her, or she didn’t care.</p>
<p>	       “You guys actually are a Quidditch team?” The other girl squealed, putting her hands on her chest.</p>
<p>	       The second girl was less impressive in the athletic department. Although she didn’t look out of shape, Dan didn’t think she would join the team knowing how much athleticism it took. Despite their height difference, he didn’t think that she weighed that much less than him. Still, he figured everyone deserved a chance.</p>
<p>	       “Yes! It’s a cross between soccer, rugby, and basketball,” Dan explained. “There is a lot of running and aggressive play.”</p>
<p>	       “Rugby?” The larger girl asked. “Like you can hit people?”</p>
<p>	       “Exactly,” Dan explained. “It’s a lot of fun and very competitive!”</p>
<p>	       “Awesome! I’m Charlotte, by the way!” The athletic girl put her hand forward.</p>
<p>	       “Dan,” he said, taking her hand.</p>
<p>	       “Also, this is Quinn! We were best friends in high school and ended up coming to the same school together!” Charlotte said, motioning towards her friend.</p>
<p>	       “Nice to meet you,” Dan said, holding his hand out to her.</p>
<p>	       “Wait, soccer? Is this going to be a lot of running?” Quinn asked, still taking his hand, a look of fear on her face.</p>
<p>	       “Yes. We have an official table. Here take some forms and you can talk to the team captain there,” Dan said, handing them each a form. “His name is Tony and he can fill you in on tryouts.”</p>
<p>	       “Woah! Tryouts! That sounds awesome,” Charlotte jumped for joy. “Let’s go, Quinn!”</p>
<p>	       With that, Charlotte dragged Quinn into the fray of tables. Dan smiled, hoping that they would at least get enough girls to play. He said tryouts, but typically not enough people joined the team to even have those. With fourteen slots available, they probably wouldn’t cut anyone.</p>
<p>	       The remaining day of the event was met with many of the same conversations. As Tony had guessed, a large portion of unathletic people were interested. They would take a form and run off to the table to talk to Tony. He rarely was able to explain it, but he was happy when he saw just how many forms he had given out. Who was he to judge people who wanted to try? Any players were better than no players.</p>
<p>       With only one left, Dan looked for at least one more person. The event was winding down as he noticed a young man start to walk towards the event. He was wearing a high school letter jacket that proudly displayed a patch for football state champions. Dan knew these kinds of people. They didn’t realize that in college, nobody cared what they did in high school. Still, he looked taller and bigger than Dan. A football player wouldn’t be a bad addition. As the guy approached, Dan quickly intercepted him.</p>
<p>       “Care to join the Quidditch team?” Dan said, holding out the form.</p>
<p>       “What?” He responded, clearly taken off guard. </p>
<p>       “Quidditch. It’s a sport that we play with a bunch of other colleges,” Dan said. “It’s like a mix between soccer, rugby, and basketball.”</p>
<p>       The man thought for a second, clearly showing confusion on his face. He looked at Dan before asking his question.</p>
<p>       “I don’t know what Quidditch is,” he confessed. “It sounds familiar, but I really have no clue what you are talking about.”</p>
<p>       “Do you want to join a sports team?” Dan asked.</p>
<p>       “Sure, why not,” he said with a shrug. </p>
<p>       “Then please take this form and head down to the quidditch table. You can’t miss it,” Dan explained. “Our team captain, Tony, will answer all your questions.”</p>
<p>       The man nodded, walking away. As he disappeared into the fading crowd, Dan realized he hadn’t even asked the man’s name. Cursing himself, he kept to his duty.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>	       At the end of the event, Dan walked back to the table. Around him he saw a few tables had already left with many of them starting to pack up what they had. The sun was raising towards the horizon at this point. When he arrived back at the table, he saw that Gavin was already there.</p>
<p>	       “Wow, you got back here fast,” Dan commented. “The dorms aren’t exactly close by.”</p>
<p>	       “When I ran out of forms, I just came back here,” Gavin shrugged. “Somebody should’ve printed more.”</p>
<p>	       “You still could’ve advertised people to come here,” Dan sighed. “That’s what I did.”</p>
<p>	       “Sorry I’m late guys,” James said as he approached, also empty handed. “I ran out of forms. I guess you guys did too.”</p>
<p>	       “How many were printed?” Tony asked, looking at Dan. </p>
<p>	       “I printed like fifty of them,” Dan said. </p>
<p>	       “Well, I hope they all show up to practice. We might actually have tryouts for once,” Tony said with an uncharacteristic smile. “Good job everyone. Head home and we will meetup tomorrow for practice.”</p>
<p>	       With that, the group split up. Dan and Gavin still had a good portion of the day. They went back to their dorm, setting up their favorite game. Sitting down to play it, Dan and Gavin mused about the day.</p>
<p>	       “Get anyone good?” Dan asked.</p>
<p>	       “Not really. I did see a few cheerleaders, but they brushed me off,” Gavin said with a smirk. “I guess my charming good looks weren’t enough.”</p>
<p>	       “I meant for the team,” Dan rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>	       “Oh, yeah. Well one of the cheerleaders looked interested, but they started to make fun of it and she left,” Gavin responded. “She didn’t look that amazing, though. So, I guess it’s fine. How about you?”</p>
<p>	       “I had two really promising ones actually,” Dan said as he kept playing. </p>
<p>	       “Oh yeah? Pray tell,” Gavin asked.</p>
<p>	       “One guy, one girl. The girl’s name was Charlotte,” Dan started. “She looked like a really fantastic soccer player.”</p>
<p>	       “Yeah? How so?” Gavin prodded.</p>
<p>	       “She had long, athletic legs and smooth skin,” Dan said, starting to lose focus. “Her hair was perfect.”</p>
<p>	       Suddenly, Gavin slammed his controller stick and Dan’s character was sent flying to death. Dan gave an annoyed look at Gavin who started laughing at him.</p>
<p>	       “Tell me again how her hair makes her a great soccer player!” Gavin teased, motioning to show off his hair. </p>
<p>	       Dan shook his head in response, deciding to change the subject.</p>
<p>	       “There was also this other dude,” Dan said. “I didn’t really get a chance to talk to him, but he seemed really athletic.”</p>
<p>	       “I saw somebody like that at the table actually,” Gavin said, motioning as he spoke. “Short black hair, African American, a little bit taller and bigger than you, still wearing high school letter jacket?”</p>
<p>	       “Yeah, that’s him,” Dan said, nodding along. </p>
<p>	       “His name is Jayden,” Gavin replied. “He is a bit cocky, but that might be good for our team.”</p>
<p>	       “Let’s hope,” Dan said. “Anyways, I think you owe me a second round.”</p>
<p>	       “Not my fault you got all held up talking about Charlotte,” Gavin said. “I can see it now. Good shot Charlotte, your hair bounced perfectly as you threw the ball!”</p>
<p>	       “Shut up!” Dan said, reaching over and throwing a pillow at his friend who cackled wildly. “You’re an idiot!”</p>
