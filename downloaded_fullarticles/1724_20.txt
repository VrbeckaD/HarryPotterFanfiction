    <p>“Luis, I don’t think that sounds right, but I don't really know enough about transfiguration to disagree with you right now.” Sure, Scott didn’t always pay attention in class, but he was sure he’d remember something like that.</p><p>	“Find me a dead animal and we’ll try it.” Luis grinned at him, making Scott laugh. He was 90% sure you couldn’t transfigure a dead body back to life, but he kind of wanted to see how it would turn out.</p><p>	“Excuse me. Hi, um.” A small, timid voice called out from behind them. “You can’t transfigure something back to life.”</p><p>	Scott turned around, looking to see who had been that into their conversation that they actually butted in. A small boy stood wrapped in a familiar blue scarf that told Scott he was a Ravenclaw. His small stature paired with the fact that he was here at Hogsmeade with them meant he couldn’t be more than a third year. A third year Ravenclaw that knew more than a couple of fifth years didn’t seem so crazy though.</p><p>	“You sure?” Luis frowned, all excitement gone.</p><p>	“Yes.” The boy’s face burned bright red. Clearly he wasn’t used to letting people know he was eavesdropping. Scott held no such inhibitions.</p><p>	“Why not?”</p><p>	“Because.” Scott couldn’t help but smile at the confused look on the Ravenclaws face. Not that many people were used to Luis’ brand of questioning. But Scott was, and he knew about a million more were about to pop out of his friend rapid fire style before he finally accepted the fact that dead bodies couldn’t be transfigured back to life. “It doesn’t work that way.”</p><p>	Sure enough, by the time Luis relented, the small Ravenclaw boy was looking exhausted, even if much more relaxed around them. Looking like he was about to turn around and head off, Scott spoke up for the first time in the whole interaction.</p><p>	“Hey. Did you want to go get some butterbeer with us?” He let his best smile plaster onto his face. Still, the brown haired boy looked like he was about to say no. “My treat. It's the least I can do after that. Not many people handle Luis that nicely. Besides, you kept him from getting on my nerves for a while.”</p><p>	“Uh, sure.” The boy said, cheeks still slightly pink.</p><p>	“I’m Scott by the way. That’s Luis.” He held out a hand to shake, glad that a hand reached back at his. Not that many students his age, and especially younger, liked to shake his hand. The Professors loved it, though.</p><p>	“Peter. I’m Peter.”</p><p>	Climbing into the booth, Peter seemed extremely uncomfortable. It made Scott fidget, too. Uncomfortableness made him uncomfortable. All they needed was to get the conversation flowing. Scott was good at talking. Luis was even better. If it didn’t calm Peter down, at least it would distract Scott. </p><p>	“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you around.” Scott thought his hardest, but he couldn’t remember seeing Peter anywhere before. Sure, Hogwarts was big, but it wasn’t that big. “You’re a third year, right?”</p><p>	“Yeah.” Peter picked at the hem of his sweater, eyes flickering around the pub.</p><p>	“We’re fifth years, Scottie and me. Hufflepuffs.” Luis told him. Neither of them wore anything signifying their house, unlike Peter with his thick blue scarf, which he now unraveled and draped next to him in the booth. It was warm enough inside for Scott to shed off his jacket, too. “Oh look, here are the drinks. I love butterbeer. Thanks, Miss. Anyways, you’re a Ravenclaw? What’s that like? Being a genius?”</p><p>	Scott rolled his eyes. He didn’t know why he thought Luis talking would calm a stranger down. If anything, it was sure to make Peter run and never look back. Instead, he was pleasantly surprised to see Peter laugh it off, taking a small sip of his drink. From the way the boys eyes widened before he took another, bigger sip, Scott figured this must be his first time trying butterbeer. Which probably meant he was from a muggle family. There were plenty of things in the Hogshead alone, never mind all of Hogsmeade that Scott could think of getting Peter to try.</p><p>	“Well, I wouldn’t exactly call myself a genius.” That blush seemed to be a Permanent thing for Peter.</p><p>	“All of you guys are. It’s like, in the code or something.” Again, a laugh from Peter, who was almost finished with his drink. Scott waved his hand at the bartender, gesturing for another. He’d buy Peter a million drinks right now just to see that wonder in his eyes. It was one of the reasons he had so many muggleborn friends. Watching them discover the wizarding world was one of the purest things in the world.</p><p>	“I’m academically driven, yes, but I’m not a genius.” The second glass was placed in front of Peter and he frowned. “I’m sorry, I didn’t order this.”</p><p>	“No, he did.” The big, burly waitress looked down at Scott, unamused, then walked away.</p><p>	“I, um.” Peter started, looking even more uncomfortable than before. Scott figured then it must be a money thing. Re-looking Peter’s appearance, he noticed that his clothes were a little more shabbier than he had originally thought. Sure, Scott’s family wasn’t rich, but they did give him a fair amount of allowance for trips like these anyways.</p><p>	“Don’t even worry about it, Pete. Drink up, they’re good, right? So Luis, did you want to ask Peter that thing you asked me the other day?” They stared at each other for a few seconds before Luis seemed to realize what he meant. Of course it wasn’t like either of them wanted to do the research on becoming an animagus, but he figured Peter might know what to do and have advice to give.</p><p>	“Hypothetically speaking, of course… What can you tell us about becoming an animagus?” Luis tried and failed to be nonchalant.</p><p>	“As a third year, I can tell you everything they told us in class. As a Ravenclaw, I can tell you there’s much more to the process than they let on.” Scott saw a flicker of excitement cross Peter’s face. “As someone who’s very interested in animagi, I can show you all of my notes on the exact steps you need. You know, hypothetically speaking, of course.”</p><p>	Luis elbowed Scott in excitement so hard that he couldn’t contain the groan of pain. Scott, Luis, Dave, and Kurt had been talking about becoming animagi for a long time, without the hassle of having to register through the Ministry of Magic. If Peter had all the steps laid out perfectly for them, it would be worth it to take a look. After all, the only reason they hadn’t tried it yet was because none of them wanted to do the research themselves.</p><p>	“Give us those papers and I’ll take you to Honeyduke’s right now and buy you anything you want.” Scott held his breath, studying Peter’s face, glad when a small smile finally appeared followed by a small, “Deal.”</p>
