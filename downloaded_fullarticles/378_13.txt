    <p>Calypso Ivy Potter-Black-Peverell was laying in her temporary bed at a local Inn when she got a call from her superior. Thankfully, MACUSA had decided to incorporate No-Maj products with Magic after there was a big revelation from the Supernatural communities. The entire world knew about Vampires, Shapeshifters, Witches, Wizards, et c. However, the Wizarding World still mostly kept themselves hidden behind strong wards. The Unspeakables, where Calypso-call-me-Callie worked, usually were sent out on cases that raise a few red flags to the supernatural community or did a lot of research.</p><p>"Unspeakable Phoenix," she muttered into the phone.</p><p>"Hey Callie, I've just gotten new information that I'm sure you'd like to hear, considering who you're looking into and where you are," came the young intern's voice that was working under her.</p><p>She pushed herself up to a sitting position and pushed her feathered hair out of her face.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"A, Laura Hale, was found murdered this morning. Considering you've been looking into the Hale Pack Massacre and are currently residing in Beacon Hills I figured you'd want to be at the Crime Scene."</p><p>Calypso was a bit shocked by what Veronica had just told her but she immediately swung out of bed.</p><p>"Thanks for the information. Do you know where I can find it?"</p><p>"It's in the woods near where the old Hale Pack House was burned down. Just follow the flashing lights."</p><p>"Thanks for the information, Veronica."</p><p>She hung up before heading towards her bathroom after unshrinking her trunk. She took a quick shower before stepping into a pair of her skintight Dragon-Hide pants, an Acromantula silk black v-neck shirt, and Basilisk-Skin boots. Calypso had the sign of the Deathly Hallows etched into the center of her breasts and reached to the middle of her throat on a point. When the three items accepted her as their owner, along with Death, they had slowly begun to appear. She went through a surprise inheritance on the day of the Battle of Hogwarts due to the removal of the Horcrux and the Basilisk venom and Phoenix tears running through her veins.</p><p>Her hair had turned from black to a bright flame red with streaks of yellow, orange, and magenta peaking through. It looked like normal strands of hair at the roots but seemed to take the shape of feathers, due to her magic, near the ends. Her eyes looked luminous green but she could tap into the basilisk and kill with her gaze if she needed to.</p><p>
  <strong>(A/N: If you want a reference to how I imagined her hair, just think about Kumina from Naruto when she got angry and the Kyuubi's aura caused it to split into the nine tails.)</strong>
</p><p>The last thing she grabbed was her Unspeakable robes and flipped the wide hood over her head to obscure her face. She Apparated to the husk of the Hale House before trekking through the woods towards where she heard people. Considering it was still dark out, she guessed it would have to be the group of human police men making that much noise.</p><p>The sound of a branch snapping to her left made her head snap in that direction. She didn't see anything but when she took a long drawn breath she could smell wolf and something she couldn't place from a distance. She would've gone to track down the wolf but she had something else to do at the moment.</p><p>Soon she found the marked off crime scene and walked towards one of the lower ranked deputies standing watch.</p><p>"This is a crime scene..." he seemed to have trouble figuring out whether to call her ma'am or sir.</p><p>"Unspeakable Phoenix. I've been notified that the woman you found is someone that intersects with the case I'm currently working on," she said before she reached out, revealing a dainty pale hand, and procured her identification.</p><p>It was a moving picture which started out with her hood covering her face before she reached her hands up and pushed it back and gave the camera a mischievous smirk. When the man glanced away from the I.D. in shock to look back at Callie, she had already pulled her hood off.</p><p>He gulped in slight fear at the Unspeakable in front of him before gesturing her into the crime scene. Calypso began a steady stride towards two men standing beside a crouched woman. The woman in question was someone who Callie actually knew. Which surprised her.</p><p>At her approaching footsteps the two men turned to her. One was confused and the other, who she assumed was the Sheriff, frowned a bit.</p><p>"This is a crime scene, ma'am. I'm gonna have to ask you to stay behind the yellow tape," the Sheriff said before muttering, "Damn newbies."</p><p>"I'm well aware, Sheriff...." she paused in question before he answered with 'Stilinski' and she continued. "I'm Unspeakable Phoenix. Your victim is someone connected to a case I'm working on."</p><p>Sheriff Stilinksi's frown smoothed out while the other man took on a look of disgust. You win some, you lose some. She wasn't that concerned. As she spoke and stated her title, the woman who was crouching and examining the body had turned in slight surprise. Warm brown eyes on a delicate and pale face stared at her for a second before giving a small smile. She stood up and approached the trio with her long curly black hair swaying behind her from where it was tied high on top of her head.</p><p>"Callie, I'm surprised to see you here," Anita said as she stepped forward.</p><p>Anita Blake was a Necromancer, a Vampire Executioner and also worked for RIPT or also known as Rip-it. She usually worked with law enforcement to solve preternatural crime and most days stayed busy with one of her many lovers. Calypso could sense the Ardeur within Anita but they had never spoken about it. It was a touchy subject for the shorter woman. Anita stood at 5'3" which was 2 inches shorter than Callie.</p><p>"I was in the neighborhood working on an old case and then this sprung up. Can I look at the body?"</p><p>"I don't mind an extra set of eyes," she answered with a shrug.</p><p>Sheriff Stilinski followed them back to the body, or what was left of the body, while the other man stormed off in anger. Calypso ignored the bigot and squatted down on the left side while Anita took the right. She was handed gloves to place on her hands to avoid contamination.</p><p>The body was severed in half and the lower half was missing.</p><p>"It looks like a relatively clean cut. This could've been done by a human with some sort of tool that could easily cut through flesh. They would need to be stronger than the average human though to get the blade through on the first try. Unless it was something Supernatural that wanted it to look like a human had done it," Callie pointed out as she inspected the abdominal slice that had spilled her innards across the forest floor.</p><p>"Yes, however, she had her throat ripped out by something with sharp teeth. Not human. It's also too wide to have been normal teeth. I'd guess it was some type of Shapeshifter. There's too much blood to have been a vampire. Plus, vampires don't usually eat the flesh of their victims," Anita said as she prodded at the woman's neck.</p><p>"Could the missing flesh just have been left somewhere else? Or even a Vampire that wasn't out hunting but simply took pleasure in tearing out their victim's throat?"</p><p>"It could've been a possibility if there weren't four tears where the upper and lower fangs pierced the flesh," Anita answered.</p><p>"The lower cut has less blood than the one at her throat so my guess is that it was done Postmortem," Calypso pointed out as she looked at the darkened forest floor that was stained with old blood.</p><p>She inhaled to try and sort through the different smells surrounding the body, trying to pinpoint what type of shapeshifter had killed the young woman. All she could pick up was werewolf and she wasn't sure if that was the female she was smelling. The smell of ruptured intestines did a good job of mostly masking any other smells she could identify.</p><p>"Did you catch anything," Anita asked as she paused to stare at Calypso.</p><p>"Nah, mostly just shite from the ruptured intestines and werewolf."</p><p>"So, it was a werewolf," Anita asked with a slight tilt to her head.</p><p>"I don't want to say yes because I'm unsure if I'm just picking up her scent or someone else. Although, I did smell a Werewolf on my trek over here. Think it was stalking me."</p><p>That snapped Anita's head up as she begun searching their surroundings.</p><p>"Are you telling me that there may be a volatile Werewolf somewhere in my surroundings and you didn't think to tell us," she asked with steel in her voice.</p><p>"It took off when it found out I could sense it. I haven't gotten another whiff of it and you know I would've said something if it really was close by," Callie said in a placating voice.</p><p>Trying to change the subject, she asked, "So, which of your sexy boyfriends did you bring with you?"</p><p>Calypso had a sly smile on her face as she begun looking for anymore markings on the body. Anita looked mullish as she wasn't that comfortable with discussing her personal life with people but she reluctantly answered.</p><p>"Truth and Wicked came with me as protection and Nathaniel as well as Jason came as... support?"</p><p>"Ah.. I know what you mean. No need to provide explanation," she was going to stop there but quickly added, "Don't worry, your secret is safe with me. And I'm not gonna judge you for it."</p><p>Anita had looked at Calypso in surprise at that last bit but shrugged it off and begun looking at the body again. It must've bothered her immensely to have to feed off sex to essentially live but Callie was glad to change the subject. They both decided to flip the body over in order to check the back. There were two sets of claw marks marring her back.</p><p>"Something must've been stalking her and caught her off guard. She was an Alpha and they don't usually go down so easily. I'm just curious on why she came back to Beacon Hills," Callie said as she stood up and took off her gloves.</p><p>"So, this was a Shapeshifter attack," asked Sheriff Stilinski.</p><p>"There's a rather confusing answer to that but what we can gather is she was attacked by a Shapeshifter and then cut up by either an enhanced human or something that wanted it to look like a human did. However, I don't think that a Shapeshifter would change back into their human form just to cut the already dead body in half. Also unusual is the fact that the Shapeshifter only went for the kill and hadn't eaten the corpse more," Anita answered as she stepped away from the body as well.</p><p>"Who would cut up a dead body?"</p><p>"I don't have an answer for that but it's rather interesting that someone would find the body so soon after the attack to be able to cut it up and then not even report it," Calypso said as she leaned against a tree in thought.</p><p>"Why do you think it was soon after the attack," the Sheriff asked.</p><p>"There's too much blood near the stomach. If it had been a while, say a day or even 12 hours, after the attack, then she would've been mostly bled out by the neck or back wounds. However, she still had enough blood to form a medium sized puddle at her stomach. My guess is that someone wanted this Shapeshifter to attack her and then cut her up as bait. I've no idea what the bait is for but I do know she has a brother and he will most likely come to figure out what happened to her. I'd suggest you put men on him for protection until this case is solved," Callie said as she stood straight and begun walking away.</p><p>Anita agreed with her and said her goodbyes before following her away from the police lights, further into the darkened forest surrounding them.</p><p>"So, what case are you working on? Anything I can help you with," she asked as she sped walked to keep up with Calypso's slightly longer strides.</p><p>"Hmm, you've got more contacts among the supernatural so probably. Want to come back to my room and go over the files I have?"</p><p>".. I'll need to.. feed.. in about two hours before it gets a bit bad," Anita admitted reluctantly.</p><p>Callie tilted her head in thought before saying, "I wonder if I can channel my sexual frustration and magic into you and it would suffice. In a sense your Ardeur is sex magic among my people. It either needs sex or an abundance of magic to overload it. Maybe?"</p><p>"We could try that first, I guess, but if it doesn't work I'll still need to leave in two hours. I also should probably call Nathaniel to let him know where I'm going."</p><p>"Since we've walked enough distance," Callie said before quickly pulling Anita into a hug and Apparated away.</p>
