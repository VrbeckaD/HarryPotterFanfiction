    <p align="justify">Her eyes were pale and unnervingly intense. That was his first impression of the girl they said was his sister. He glanced at his parents where they stood awkwardly, hands clutching the other’s arms as if to keep themselves from convening on the girl. His mum’s eyes were green- a deep bottle green, not like the icy green of this girl in front of them and she didn’t much look like the woman either. She was tan for one thing but not the healthy golden he and his dad sported; she was dusky colored which only served to make her eyes more noticeable. That mess of black hair didn’t help in that regard. It looked even more disheveled than his had ever been and was cut rather short with just enough of bangs to dip into her eyes. Again, only serving to bring attention to them. Besides that, she was small. Actually, that didn’t do justice to it. She was dainty sized small but scrappy looking. Looked like she could pounce on someone and take them down, small size or no.</p><p align="justify">And frankly it looked like she’d already sized up everyone in the room and dismissed them which was worrying. He wondered where she had been all these years. They were already fourteen after all. In fact, if the goblet hadn’t spit out her name they might not have found her at <em>all</em>. What a way to find a long lost sister. Daughter, he thought as he glanced again at his parents. They looked like they would break into tears any moment now and he cringed a little. Just a little.</p><p align="justify">That would be embarrassing. Then he cringed again because that sounded kind of insensitive. They just found a daughter that they’d thought they’d never see again and here he was thinking that their feelings were embarrassing. Honestly, he didn’t know what to really think. He didn’t know her, she was a complete stranger. He didn’t want to say he didn’t care because…Well, this was his twin and all but he didn’t really know what to feel.</p><p align="justify">Aside, of course, from wincing concern that a fourteen year old would be forced to compete in a tournament meant for of age magic folk and that people have died in previously. He looked at her again.</p><p align="justify">Dressed in a scruffy too-big jumper and wearing muggle denim, ratty trainers peeking from them. Several eye-catchingly bright gems crawling up either of her ears and almost impassive faced. She had a nice face, he thought. Not like his mum’s but she looked a bit like Granny Dorea. Except for her colors and hair style.</p><p align="justify">Wild he thought to himself suddenly and he nodded internally. That was a good way to put it. She felt, and looked, wild.</p><p align="justify">“Come in,” the Headmaster called cheerily but it sounded a little strained. The door opened and Jasper watched as Olympe and Karkaroff came in, their champions behind them. Right after came Diggory. Well that’s just <em>peachy</em>; now the office was filled with Ministry officials, agitated foreign schoolheads and more students. The Headmaster was lucky none of his baubles had been knocked over at this point.</p><p align="justify">“There is nothing to be done about Ms. Potter’s participation.” Dumbledore spoke before anyone could pipe in. “The tests have already been concluded. She is bound to compete or lose her magic, and it has been established that she does not wish to lose her magic.” he said with a pointed look after Karkaroff shifted to say something. The man grumbled.</p><p align="justify">“And what of her schooling? She is a student at none of our establishments.” Olympe asked with a frown, her dark eyes landing on the girl. She looked especially tiny and harmless the way she had curled up on the chair, her legs up and socked feet peeking from under her jeans and her chin on her knees. He looked back at Olypme to see concern pulling her brows together and he could see the same sort of protective concern in Fleur’s eyes. Karkaroff only seemed aggravated at the extra champion; Krum looked uncomfortable crammed in so close with everybody. Since he’d just checked them, his eyes flicked to Diggory. In typical Hufflepuff fashion, he looked just as concerned for this small slip of a girl as Olympe and Fleur.</p><p align="justify">“You can’t claim her just because her brother is here,” Karkaroff immediately threw in.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore nodded calmly. “No, that’s not what will be happening Igor.” he said like a professor patiently explaining to a troublesome student. Karkaroff didn’t look amused. “Ms. Potter here is not a student at any of our fine schools. However, there have been instances of similar cases happening in these tournaments before.” he said with a genial smile. “She will not be registered with any schools in this case.”</p><p align="justify">“Is that allowed?” Diggory asked, crossing his arms.</p><p align="justify">“In peculiar cases like this one.” Ludo Bagman shrugged easily. “It has happened before. Which is to say, she can earn points all she wants but in the end only one of the enrolled students can actually win the title. Nevertheless, if her points somehow exceeds her opponents then she’ll be getting half as many galleons as the actual winner.”</p><p align="justify">“So she’s not actually any competition?”</p><p align="justify">“Correct.” he grinned, “She’s only competing because she’ll lose her magic, and she’s under the approved age limit as well. And she isn’t a student,” he said the last bit like a second thought. “Don’t look so worried! There are plenty of new rules in place to make sure no one will end up dying.” and Jasper practically heard the ‘probably’ he left hanging.</p><p align="justify">“We can discuss this another time. For now, I think it’s best we let the Potters get reacquainted with young Jasmine. You’ll be allowed a separate set of quarters here in the castle.” he said to the girl. She nodded easily, delicately setting her feet down as they slipped into her trainers.</p><p align="justify">“Is that it?” Sprout asked.</p><p align="justify">“For now.” Crouch grunted, getting up to go back to the Ministry. Jasmine stood and Jasper watched his parents dart over to latch onto her tightly, regardless of who else was in the room.</p><p align="justify">“Once you’re out of the office, there should be a House Elf waiting to take you to a room.” the Headmaster said kindly and he watched his mum nod against the girl’s head. They didn’t let go even as they moved to the door, making others shuffle awkwardly out of the way. Jasper followed a few moments behind them, leaving a sizable distance.</p><p align="justify">Perhaps twenty minutes later, they were in a tower not particularly used. Well Jasper always knew how huge the school was. Eventually they stopped near an alcove with a statue of a tall man with a strange looking snake on his shoulders that had two heads- one on both ends.</p><p align="justify">“If Ms. Potter be touching both snakey faces at same time, Ms. Potter be opening door!” Malmsi explained cheerfully. He watched Jasmine step closer, then go up on her tip toes. She couldn’t reach so she instead physically climbed on the dais the statue was on and again went on the tips of her toes to touch both. She easily slipped back when the statue moved to reveal a small and slim corridor.</p><p align="justify">“Why did that snake have two heads?” Jasper asked the elf. It was Jasmine that answered, speaking for the first time in his presence.</p><p align="justify">“It’s an amphisbaena. The man was an adventurer from the seventeenth century.” she said. Her voice had a pleasant rasp to it and he eyed her curiously as she examined the entry it had shown.</p><p align="justify">“Really?” their mum asked, looking at the once more stationary statue.</p><p align="justify">“If Ms. Potter be needings Malmsi again, Ms. Potter call for Malmsi and Malmsi will appear!” the elf told her sister.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you Malmsi, you’ve been very helpful. I’ll be sure to call on you again.” the elf looked like she might be delirious with joy at being thanked so politely.</p><p align="justify">“Oh yes, Ms. Potters! Malmsi will wait for Ms. Potter to call on her!” before a loud crack heralded her departure.</p><p align="justify">“He collected a huge amount of beasts and documented most of them- Jorge di Giovanni.”</p><p align="justify">“Do you like creatures then?” James asked her, eager for any scrap of information about her. She glanced at him for a moment before stepping into passageway. They were quick on her heels and Jasper went in after them, watching as the entry was covered again. There was quite a pretty painting covering what was the opening though, and the creatures in it looking at them curiously before playing about in their exotic looking backdrop.</p><p align="justify">“I do.” he heard his sister and looked forward again. “I like learning about them. I like seeing them even more.” she turned her head as she led them to a slim spiral staircase. “Is it true there are thestrals on the grounds?”</p><p align="justify">“There are,” Lily told her quickly. “But I don’t think…” she trailed off. He looked between his sister and their parents curiously. He liked care of magical creatures and all, but he wasn’t that into it.</p><p align="justify">“Thestrals?”</p><p align="justify">“They pull the carriages to Hogwarts,” his dad explained.</p><p align="justify">“Really? I’ve never seen them.” he frowned. “Are they invisible?” and his parents smiled at him warmly. He wondered what he did to get that fond soft look.</p><p align="justify">“They can only be seen if someone has seen and accepted death. Animals can see them just fine and so can most other creatures, but people need to see death of another person and accept it.” his sister explained easily and he shuddered.</p><p align="justify">“That…That sounds awful.” he said.</p><p align="justify">“They’re very placid creatures you know. And horribly discriminated against.” her doll like face moved to show a frown and she gently tucked few wild strands of hair behind her ear. “They’re not evil or anything.”</p><p align="justify">“But you wouldn’t even be able to see them!”</p><p align="justify">“I can see them just fine.” she said and he paused as the implications slid into his mind. He wanted to ask who she’d seen die in morbid curiosity but couldn’t bring himself to because he was more than a little afraid of the answer. Then they were going up the stairs.</p><p align="justify">The immediate room they climbed up to was wide and had a domed ceiling that showed a blue sky with fluffy white clouds in a picturesque way- his sister seemed just as fascinated with it. The furniture, Malmsi had explained beforehand, came from where they placed all of their unused furniture and he had itched to find out where. He had seen the same look on his dad.</p><p align="justify">But the furniture here was light colored and unmistakably feminine. The entire room was done in light blues and shades of soft white with a few bits gray here and there.</p><p align="justify">“It’s like the sky,” she said, “I like it.”</p><p align="justify">“Do you like flying?”</p><p align="justify">“I <em>love</em> flying,” she answered immediately, her pale eyes sharpening. Their dad grinned broadly, dimples appearing. Lily only gave a slightly exasperated but mostly soft look. She shook her head then, pushing the braid she kept her long red hair in over her shoulder.</p><p align="justify">“Of course you would like flying,” she sighed wistfully. “Do you like Quidditch as well?”</p><p align="justify">“Only when I’m Seeker.” she answered, eyes wandering around the room again so she didn’t see the way their dad’s smile got even bigger.</p><p align="justify">“Do you like sports? Do you like football?” Jasper decided to ask. Dean loved football.</p><p align="justify">“The muggle game? I suppose it’s alright. I like skittles more.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh. What about Exploding Snap?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s fun I guess but I think Draughts is better.”</p><p align="justify">“Really? I never really liked Draughts. It reminds me of chess.”</p><p align="justify">“Chess is much more difficult than Draughts.” she frowned. “Draughts is nice and easy. And competitive.” she added as an afterthought.</p><p align="justify">“Are you competitive?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes.” she said almost before he could finish the question.</p><p align="justify">“Does that mean you’ll try to outdo the other champions?” he asked and from the corner of his eye, watched his parents flinch at the reminder. She hummed and plopped herself in a pretty claw-foot chaise. He sat on a loveseat and their parents moved to a sofa.</p><p align="justify">“I suppose if I can I will but I don’t think I’ll go out of my way.” she told him and his lips twisted.</p><p align="justify">“Not interested in eternal glory and fame?”</p><p align="justify">“No. Besides, do you know any previous winners? Not that eternal, their fame.”</p><p align="justify">“You wouldn’t want to be famous?” he asked. Because she will be soon now that they found her. He won’t be surprised when he and his family are on the covers again. They usually were every few months. Be it because of his Boy-Who-Lived status, his father’s achievements as Head Auror or one of his mother’s books.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t see why I should have people prying into my life.” she said and cut him from his musings. He blinked at her.</p><p align="justify">“You’re a private person?” their mum asked with a frown. She tilted her head as she thought about it. And then Malmsi suddenly appeared.</p><p align="justify">“Malmsi not be called, but Malmsi wondered if Ms. Potter and Ms. Potter’s family are wanting refreshments?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes please, Malmsi. Could I trouble you for a Daily Prophet too?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes! Malmsi bringing those things right away Ms. Potter!”</p><p align="justify">“Call me Minnie,” she said absently.</p><p align="justify">“Oh yes Ms. Minnie! Malmsi will do that!” before again leaving via loud crack noise.</p><p align="justify">“Minnie?” he asked.</p><p align="justify">“I’m only ever called Minnie.” She told him.</p><p align="justify">“And you read the Daily Prophet?”</p><p align="justify">“I just like the Fiendishly Difficult Crossword to be honest.”</p><p align="justify">“I can never get even one of the words.” Jasper frowned.</p><p align="justify">“Well it <em>is</em> called fiendishly difficult you know.”</p><p align="justify">“Have you…Have you heard of us then?” and she nodded. “Then why didn’t you-”</p><p align="justify">“Didn’t think I was a Potter.” she said easily. “I don’t exactly look like you and nobody ever talked about a Potter girl.”</p><p align="justify">Jasper and their mum were too busy focusing on Jasmine to notice the way James’ features tightened. Soon enough there was tea and Jasper relocated himself after a few moments of indecision when Jasmine had the paper because really, he wanted to see if she could really find any of the words. Their parents watched fondly and that’s how their first afternoon as a family panned out.</p><p align="center">xXx</p><p align="justify">He was the one chosen to bring her down to breakfast, seeing that his parents couldn’t just stay in Hogwarts though his dad was given days off on the days of the tasks and the night of the Yule Ball. She wasn’t wearing a uniform- another too big jumper, the sleeves almost covering her hands. Jeans that looked worn and pretty feminine flats. There was a headband pushing her bangs back and she really did have a pretty face. Even with that odd lightning shaped scar. She was in stark contrast with the rest of the students with their (mostly) neat uniforms and robes. She was also very quickly under intense scrutiny as soon as they entered the hall. Jasper ignored the stares and whispers as he always did and gently (she really was so tiny, it made him worry) urged her to his usual spot. Ron and Neville were already there and scooted to make room for both between them. He sat her next to Neville, figuring she might be a little more comfortable with the soft-spoken boy.</p><p align="justify">“Guys, this is my…Sister, Jasmine.” he was happy he only hesitated for a moment before introducing her. “Jasmine, these are my friends.” he gestured toward them to get them to start introducing themselves.</p><p align="justify">“I’m Neville Longbottom.” the slightly pudgy boy greeted her with a nervous smile.</p><p align="justify">“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron leaned forward to look at her. “Look at that, you’re smaller than Ginny!”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not that small!” Ginny piped in with a frown before turning curious brown eyes back onto Jasmine. “I’m Ginny by the way. Ron’s one of my brothers.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m Dean Thomas.” the boy next to her piped in, eyes taking in this new girl eagerly. Jasper makes a mental note to warn the boy off before he gets any ideas.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t mind his oglin’,” came the next voice, heavy with the Irish brogue. “Name’s Seamus Finnegan, doll.” he winked and Jasper revised that he would have to viciously prank them both as a warning.</p><p align="justify">“Ignore them both!” another chimed in. “I’m Parvati Patil. Don’t trust any of these Gryffindor boys. Date outside your house, that’s what I say!”</p><p align="justify">“But she’s not really in a house…” Jasper felt compelled to point out. Parvati huffed.</p><p align="justify">“The point still stands. Don’t date a Gryffindor boy. Especially not in this year.”</p><p align="justify">“So cruel.”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t think they’re so bad…Oh! I’m Lavender Brown! Nice to meet you. And this is Faye Arlton beside me.” the black girl who introduced herself gestured to a quiet looking brunette.</p><p align="justify">“Hullo,” she spoke softly, looking around at them with her head cocked to the side. “Why is Gryffindor red?” she asked suddenly.</p><p align="justify">“Fire- it’s our Houses’s element.” Jasper answered automatically. He remembered his mother reading Hogwarts; A History to him as a bedtime story when he was younger and thus knew a whole bunch of weird tidbits. It was more than once used as teasing material.</p><p align="justify">“And what about these other dorms?”</p><p align="justify">“Houses,” he corrected absently as he fixed her a plate- she wasn’t making one up herself. “Gryffindor is fire, Hufflepuff is earth, Ravenclaw is air and Slytherin is water.”</p><p align="justify">“If not for some of his grades, one might think ol’ Jasp here was a ‘claw.” Finnegan grinned. He rolled his eyes and pushed her plate closer to her. She eyed it curiously before obediently beginning to eat. Pleased with her compliance, he turned his attention into doing his own plate. Mostly of meats.</p><p align="justify">“Did you just-?” Parvati just asked, staring at Jasmine’s plate. “Did you just set up her breakfast for her?”</p><p align="justify">“...Yes?” he answered hesitantly, wondering why a few of his friends stared at him. Seamus was the one who broke the silence and it was with gut-jiggling laughter.</p><p align="justify">“You’ll make a fine mother one day!” Dean said before also bursting into laughter at his expense.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t see what’s wrong with it,” he argued hotly but he felt his ears go red and the back of his neck probably.</p><p align="justify">“There’s nothing wrong with it,” Lavender told him, “I think it’s sweet.” she smiled warmly and Jasper sighed. He could see the faces of his dormmates and knew there would be teasing.</p><p align="justify">“What will you do when we have classes?” Neville spoke up, successfully diverting attention for the moment. “And- and what about your actual school?”</p><p align="justify">“I was homeschooled.” she answered after hastily devouring everything on her plate with a ferocity that impressed Ron. Jasper barely noticed how beastly it was (used to Ron’s eating habits and all) and filled her plate again between bites of his own. “And I’ll be doing self-study while your ilk will be in classes.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re not going to be enrolled here?”</p><p align="justify">“That would mess with the tournament and the Ministry still has to flesh out some stuff about her,” Jasper chimed in, filling his sister’s plate again once he saw it empty.</p><p align="justify">“Where do you put it?” Neville asked suddenly. “Your food,” he clarified when she turned her head his way with those unnerving eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Presumably in my mouth.” came the succinct reply after staring at him for a moment or two. Then dug into her food again, her brother already moving to fill the rapidly emptying plate again.</p><p align="justify">“If you eat that quick you’ll be sick,” Seamus said, torn between horror and fascination.</p><p align="justify">“Nope,” she managed, “Food can’t make me sick, got a stomach of steel,” she told them bluntly before going back to the demolition of any food stuffs on her plate.</p><p align="justify">“She’ll give Ron a run for his money,” Dean said, nose scrunched up a little. Well, at least now Jasper wouldn’t have to deal with those two trying to flirt with his sister.</p><p align="justify">“Just because she can outpace me,” Ron spoke up, mouth full of food, “Don’t mean she can eat more.”</p><p align="justify">“If that’s a challenge, I’ll take it.” she answered, leaning forward a little to stare at him and he looked right back.</p><p align="justify">“When lunch rolls around?”</p><p align="justify">“You’re on.” she said, eyes glinting eagerly before turning back to her plate and eating with even more vigor.</p><p align="justify">“How does that not faze you in the slightest?” Lavender asked, still staring somewhat unwillingly at the small girl demolishing whatever food was set in front of her. She’d never seen anyone eat like that besides Ron and even he wasn’t as…Savage.</p><p align="justify">“Because it…Doesn’t?” he asked more than said, looking at his sister while she ate. She didn’t talk with her mouth full and her mouth was closed for all of the five seconds it took her to chew and swallow. It wasn’t unsightly, no food sprayed anywhere and all of the food went strictly in her mouth, none on her face. He shrugged.</p><p align="justify">“Either way, we should get ready for class,” Neville said, not really very hungry after seeing both Ron and Jasmine eating at the same time. Just watching her made him feel full and bloated. Jasper nodded, turning his eyes again to the small girl sitting between the two.</p><p align="justify">“What will you be doing?” he asked and Neville marveled. Jasper was a loud, brash and usually haughty (Neville would never say it aloud) boy. To see him so docile and tame, even a bit domestic after one afternoon with this girl was astounding. Perhaps it was just the shock of it and it would wear off but for now it was still something amazing to see. She looked at him, swallowing her food before answering. Her voice, Neville mused, was pretty nice sounding. There was a sort of dry scratchy tone to it that was remarkably soothing to hear. Still, he felt like if she were to shout or snarl, that pleasantness would turn into something frightening and ominous. He shook the thoughts off; she was no older than they were, a few minutes younger than both he and Jasper and they were only in their fourth year. Regardless of how she might be intimidating, that didn’t mean she was scary or anything. Or intimidating at all- except maybe to food contests and those who kept diets. He could see Faye looking greenish in the face after all.</p><p align="justify">“When do they stop giving food?” she asked and he snorted. Jasper glanced at the involuntary noise, shooting him a dimpled grin before his attention was once more wholly focused on the girl.</p><p align="justify">“In five minutes.” he told her and she paused before shoveling huge amounts of food onto her utensils and viciously clearing her plate one last time before pushing it away. Neville was surprised she didn’t lick it clean but then chided himself for thinking that.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll walk you to class.” she told them. Neville didn’t think it was a request or even an offer. She would and there would be no denying her but he thought he was the only one to realize it. Jasper smiled and nodded, standing and patting her head a little bit. She blinked up at him curiously before getting up, their friends doing the same. Ron complained a little, even as he continued to stubbornly eat, grabbing rolls to take along the way to class. Jasmine seemed to notice and her hands struck out with alarming speed to grab a few rolls as well and she dipped one in gravy as they were heading down the table, Ron following that example.</p><p align="justify">“They’re going to be terrible influences on each other.” Dean pointed out, glancing as the two lingered behind them to grab more rolls and biscuits, Ron shoving some in his bag and the girl in the pouch-pocket on her jumper. Jasper sniggered.</p><p align="justify">“I think it’ll be fine,” Ginny said, looking back again at the girl, pleased that she was no longer the shortest girl in the group. “You figure she always eats like that?”</p><p align="justify">“Haven’t the foggiest. Sure we’ll learn soon.” Jasper assured them. “Oi, c’mon! Can’t be dawdling too much,” he called back to the two who looked up and hurried along, Ron taking his place on Jasper’s right and Neville scooting so Jasper could hook Jasmine’s arm in his to keep her from trotting back to breakfast if she changed her mind. “Will you be alright then, finding your way back to your rooms or wherever?”</p><p align="justify">“If I need to, I can call on Malmsi. I’m going to explore a bit.”</p><p align="justify">“Ah,” Jasper grinned, “If you want, when I have a free block I can take you around too. After lunch I’ll be free.” he offered.</p><p align="justify">“Okay.” she agreed easily.</p><p align="center">xXx</p><p align="justify">When Jasper next found his sister, he and his friends were by the Great Hall entrance. She was surrounded by Hufflepuffs and The Hufflepuff. Cedric Diggory was talking with her animatedly and she listened compliantly. Jasper was quick to push himself over to his sister, not liking the way they were surrounding her.</p><p align="justify">“Diggory! I see you’ve found Jasmine.” he greeted cheerily and the man’s attention turned to him after a moment, a polite smile on his face just barely keeping from being straight up Hufflepuff kind. Which was why Cedric Diggory was The Hufflepuff; he couldn’t <em>not</em> be kind and he was happiest when hard at work. Which was interesting because his father was a total prick.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, she was close to the ah…” he trailed off, rubbing the back of his neck now sheepishly. With his blond hair and always kind gray eyes, Diggory had a sort of charisma that he wasn’t truly aware of. It was because of this charisma that he couldn’t understand what it was like being a normal teenage boy, hence his unpopularity with most of his male peers. That and girls called him things like ‘dreamy’, ‘dashing’ and ‘perfect’. Competition of the highest order.</p><p align="justify">“I was in the basement.” Jasmine piped in. “I was going to start with the dungeons but those are more extensive and I thought I’d save it until I have more time.” she said as though she weren’t talking about wandering around in <em>snake</em> territory. Jasper resolved to warn her away from that sketchy area during lunch. His general intent must have shown on his face because Diggory smiled at him sheepishly.</p><p align="justify">“I told her the dungeons weren’t exactly…A safe place but.” he shrugged helplessly. “I don’t think that I managed to convince her.”</p><p align="justify">“This tournament isn’t safe. I think looking around a school wouldn’t be so bad in comparison.” and he and Diggory both winced at that casual reminder.</p><p align="justify">“No, but…How about you avoid the dungeons, yeah? Save them for last since they’re so extensive.” Jasper told her nervously. He didn’t want her down there. She looked to him for a few moments, eyes watching him before she nodded complacently and he relaxed.</p><p align="justify">She wouldn’t tell him that she would just explore it at night instead. She could just take a pepper-up or nap through the day.</p><p align="center">xXx</p><p align="justify">“Dragons.” he said numbly. “There’s going to be dragons. She’s going to go face to face with a dragon.” he mumbled to himself continuously. His friends winced. When he’d gone out with Hagrid to the forests and come back in a quiet, stricken daze, his friends were quick to pull him aside.</p><p align="justify">“Dragons? Do you mean…The first task?” Ron spoke up slowly and Jasper’s eyes focused a little and rested on him.</p><p align="justify">“There are four of them. I’m not sure what they’re doing with them in the task, but there will be dragons.”</p><p align="justify">And just a few days after he’d finally begun returning to relatively normal, this happens. Neville sighed and shook his head, though he was more than a little alarmed to think there would be dragons.</p><p align="justify">“I need to tell her,” he said, more focus returning to him as he turned, looking ready to bolt to his sister’s rooms.</p><p align="justify">“Whoa, whoa mate! Wouldn’t that be cheating?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s a bloody dragon!” he snapped back, “She wasn’t supposed to even be <em>in</em> this bloody thing, I’m not going to not bloomin’ tell her!” before dashing off. Dean flinched when the portrait slammed shut behind him.</p><p align="justify">“This is not good.”</p><p align="justify">He was quick to make his way to his sister’s room, ignoring anyone he was passing by and only pausing when he was in the right corridor to make sure no one was around. They didn’t need to know where she stayed or how to get in. He took a few deep breaths before swiftly gaining entrance and hurrying up the stairs, wishing they were like the ones to Dumbledore’s office that moved by themselves.</p><p align="justify">“Jasmine!” he called as he almost reached the top, panting as he watched his sister set down a saucer and look over. She had her glasses on instead of those muggle contacts; learning her eyesight was as bad as his and his dad’s was both funny and a little worrying. Learning how one put in these muggle contacts was also kind of worrying but she seemed well versed in it at any rate. Her eyeglasses were dainty rimless pince-nez types. But those weren’t thoughts for now.</p><p align="justify">“Jasper?” she asked, standing and for a few moments, he just stared at her, trying to regain his breath.</p><p align="justify">“The first task,” he managed. “Dragons.”</p><p align="justify">“I know.” she said easily. “Did you run the whole way here?”</p><p align="justify">“You…You know.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes. Come sit, you look a bit out of breath.”</p><p align="justify">Such was how he spent the rest of his day, sitting listlessly on a chaise lounge and staring at his perfectly calm and complacent sister.</p>
