What is wrong with his face?” Bella directs her question to the snatchers.</p><p> </p><p>The snatchers say they found him in this condition.</p><p> </p><p>He pretends to study the boy in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>"Was he wearing glasses?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, was he wearing glasses?”</p><p> </p><p>Bella has taken to parroting his questions back to the snatchers.</p><p> </p><p>“We uh…I don’t think so,” one of the snatchers replies.</p><p> </p><p>“Potter wears glasses.”</p><p> </p><p>He does not say for certain it is not Potter; he does not want to responsible for this later.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, allows them to draw their own conclusions.</p><p> </p><p> Bella’s wild eyes dart his way, questioning.</p><p> </p><p>He meets her gaze unflinching.</p><p> </p><p>He feels her niggling at his mind.</p><p> </p><p>He doesn’t waver, showing her what he wants her to see.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, she relents, believing he is being truthful.</p><p> </p><p>He has become quite the master of deception thanks to her.</p><p> </p><p>Bella has them all sent to the dungeons.</p><p> </p><p>He smiles and licks his lips.</p><p> </p><p>His plan is proceeding perfectly.</p><p> </p><p>He's so hungry, he can almost taste her.</p><p> </p><p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>His heart is pounding as he makes his way to the dungeons.</p><p> </p><p>The Manor is deathly quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Father and Mother have long since retired.</p><p> </p><p>And Bella is unconscious in the playroom.</p><p> </p><p>He satisfied her hunger earlier.</p><p> </p><p>She is shattered and will not be a problem until morning.</p><p> </p><p>In his excitement to have <em>her</em> finally within reach, he may have overdone it with Bella tonight.</p><p> </p><p>He isn’t worried though.</p><p> </p><p>Bella loved every moment of their play.</p><p> </p><p>She craves it.</p><p> </p><p>Her madness is what he loves about her.</p><p> </p><p>He can hear them whispering as he approaches.</p><p> </p><p>He gets to the bars and sees them huddled together with Luna off to the side.</p><p> </p><p>They all stop talking as soon as they notice him.</p><p> </p><p>“Granger,” he says, “a word?”</p><p> </p><p>She does not move for a moment but then she starts to rise.</p><p> </p><p>Potter grabs her wrist. “No. Hermione you can’t.”</p><p> </p><p>The weasel nods his big ginger head in agreement, but Granger ignores them both.</p><p> </p><p>As he knew she would.</p><p> </p><p>“He didn’t identify you for a reason, Harry. Maybe he’s willing to help us. Let’s see what he wants, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>He smiles. Granger always was brighter than both Potty and Weasel combined.</p><p> </p><p>Potter slowly nods, and she gets to her feet and makes her way to the bars where he’s waiting.</p><p> </p><p>He can barely stand the excitement building inside.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, she’s nearly close enough for him to touch!</p><p> </p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>“Malfoy,” she says when she comes to stand before him.</p><p> </p><p>“Granger.” He plays it cool. It will not do to have her see how much he wants this—her.</p><p> </p><p>“Why didn’t you identify Harry earlier?”</p><p> </p><p>He shrugs off her question. “Does it really matter?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, it does!”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” he tells her. “What matters is what I want to continue helping you. That’s what matters.”</p><p> </p><p>“Can you get us out of here?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” he tells her, and it is the truth.</p><p> </p><p>She worries her bottom lip. “What do you want in return for helping us escape?”</p><p> </p><p>Now they were finally where he wanted them to be.</p><p> </p><p>He leans close so her friends cannot hear their conversation. “You,” he says softly, silkily.</p><p> </p><p>He watches her eyes widen but doesn’t stop.</p><p> </p><p>He tells her his deepest desire.</p><p> </p><p>“I want one night with you, given freely by you, and then I will help you and the rest of your friends leave here.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re off your trolley if you think I would agree to that!”</p><p> </p><p>He pauses then shrugs. “Fine. I’ll go upstairs and tell Bella I realize now it<em> is</em> Harry Potter in our dungeons.”</p><p> </p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>He is prepared to walk away.</p><p> </p><p>He needs her willing.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait!” she calls.</p><p> </p><p>He turns around. “One night, Granger. That’s all I ask and then you’re free.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why? Why do you want me? I thought you hated me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t hate you, Granger.”</p><p> </p><p>He doesn’t tell her why.</p><p> </p><p>That will come later.</p><p> </p><p>First, he needs her to agree.</p><p> </p><p>She gnaws on that bottom lip again and he finds it arousing.</p><p> </p><p>He has her. He knows he does. He just needs her to realize she’s caught.</p><p> </p><p>“How can you get us out of here?”</p><p> </p><p>He pauses. Should he tell her?</p><p> </p><p> He decides some truth is in order if he wants her to give herself freely; if he is to satisfy his hunger he will need her to have some trust in him.</p><p> </p><p>“I can summon Dobby,” he admits. “And Dobby can use elf magic to apparate you all from the manor.”</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes go wide. “Dobby! Of course. Why didn’t I—?”</p><p> </p><p>“It wouldn’t have mattered if you had thought of it. The Manor’s ward would not allow you to summon him. I can because Dobby was born here, and I was his original master.”</p><p> </p><p>She looks like she doesn’t believe him, so he tells her to have Harry try and summon the elf.</p><p> </p><p>Potter tries. Over and over he calls for the elf, but as Draco knows, the Manor will not allow anyone but a Malfoy to penetrate the complicated wards protecting it.</p><p> </p><p>He smirks at her. “Satisfied?”</p><p> </p><p>“You summon him," she says. "Just so I know you aren’t lying."</p><p> </p><p>He laughs softly. “Nice try, Granger, but I’m not summoning Dobby until after our night. If I did that, he’d just pop all of you out of here.”</p><p> </p><p>She doesn't really trust him.</p><p> </p><p>He's not surprised.</p><p> </p><p>Granger <em>is</em> bright after all, but he can see her wavering.</p><p> </p><p>He is calm, maintaining his composure and never giving away how on edge he is as he awaits her answer.</p><p> </p><p>Bella's games have come in handy after all.</p><p> </p><p>“One night?” she says, chewing on her bottom lips hard now; it’s red and puffy.</p><p> </p><p>He is distracted by that lip, he wants to bite it, and then lick it, soothing it.</p><p> </p><p>He doesn't hesitate in answering.</p><p> </p><p>“One night,” he confirms with a nod of his head.</p><p> </p><p>“And then you will summon Dobby and help us escape? Luna and Olivander too,” she adds.</p><p> </p><p>He’s not surprised she’s bargaining for the others.</p><p> </p><p>He shrugs. Why not?</p><p> </p><p>“Luna and Olivander too," he agrees.</p><p> </p><p>She takes a deep breath and then let's it out slowly.</p><p> </p><p>She is preparing herself.</p><p> </p><p>He holds his own breath.</p><p> </p><p>Waiting.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>He keeps his smile in check.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve made the right choice.”</p><p> </p><p>She snorts. “What choice? You’re not really giving me one.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I am,” he says, and he needs her to understand this.</p><p> </p><p>“You can say no, Granger and the only thing that’ll happen is I’ll go back upstairs to my room. I won’t tell Bella who you are, and you will be in no worse off than you are now. That is your choice. Do you understand?”</p><p> </p><p>She nods. “I understand.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>But </em>if you say yes. I expect you to give yourself to me. No holding back or saying I forced you.”</p><p> </p><p>This part was important to him. He is no disgusting rapist like Yaxley, Dolohov or Rabastan Le Strange.</p><p> </p><p>“I am not forcing you to do anything. I’m simply giving you an opportunity to receive my help and in exchange I get what I want…which is you. Very simple. Quid pro quo. In the morning I will summon Dobby and your friends will be freed.”</p><p> </p><p>She stares at him for several long seconds without saying a word.</p><p> </p><p>His stomach twists.</p><p> </p><p>Will he let her go if she says no?</p><p> </p><p>Maybe tonight will be the night he finds his inner moonlight and becomes a monster.</p><p> </p><p>______________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>  </p><p>“The choice is yours, Hermione,” he says.</p><p> </p><p>It’s the first time he’s ever called her that.</p><p> </p><p>He likes the way it sounds and tastes on his tongue.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.” She finally capitulates. “I will give you your one night in exchange for you helping us escape.”</p><p> </p><p>He smiles, beyond pleased.</p><p> </p><p>He can hear Potty and the Weasel attempting to question her.</p><p> </p><p>He is pleased at what an accomplished liar she is when she explains to them that they are planning their escape.</p><p> </p><p>Potter does not look like he believes her, but he does not call her out on her lie.</p><p> </p><p>The ginger idiot smiles like a buffoon and tells her to be careful and not to trust him.</p><p> </p><p>Draco smirks. Maybe ginger isn’t as stupid as his face suggests.</p><p> </p><p>he has no intention of allowing Hermione to go, only her friends.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, he does not tell her this as he binds her hands and walks her by the arm up the stairs, away from the dungeon and into the manor.</p><p> </p><p>“You have no idea how long I have wanted you,” he whispers into her ear, before he disapparates them up to his spacious bedroom, anxious to begin their play.</p><p> </p><p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>This is going to be a three-part fic. I’m doing shorter chapters to keep in the rhythm of the story. :)</strong>
