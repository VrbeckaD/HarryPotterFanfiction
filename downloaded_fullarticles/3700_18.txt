    <p>I eyed the women behind my easle critically.</p><p>The sun shone beautifully through the large window front and her naked skin glowed in the bright light.</p><p>Her wide hips were a bit fuller and her skin on her bum and legs wasn't smooth. Little dimples are shown in the light.</p><p>She had silver stretch marks on her tummy and breasts. There were some spots on her back and she was a bit too small for her weight.</p><p>She wasn't perfect.</p><p>But somehow I thought she was stunning. She had long, thick hair, the color of a wild fox. Her eyes were in such a light green that I mistook them for contact lenses at first. She had light freckles on her round shoulders and a nice dip right above her soft butt.</p><p>And the small, insecure smile she wore like an armor made her look like one of the women Peter Paul Rubens had drawn so many centuries ago.</p><p>I sent her an encouragingly and started to sketch her soft features.</p><p>I let myself drift. The scents of oil paints and wooden canvases filled my nose. The warm spring sun on my skin made me feel secure and homely.</p><p>I only concentrated on the quietly noises the charcoal made on the uneven paper.</p><p>That was my life now.</p><p>Nearly five years after the war, the battle in Hogwarts, I lived in Muggle London and studied art.</p><p>And rather successful, if it was allowed to add.</p><p>And the most interesting part was that I loved it beyond everything.</p><p>At first, London and university had been overwhelming. Living in a Muggle flat and being like one, was...frightening.</p><p>Especially with my little problem.</p><p>I had lost my voice, not able to say one word like I had always been.</p><p>Thanks to Lovegood and, surprisingly, Granger I was somewhere around my finals in Hogwarts able to do sign language.</p><p>If anyone would have asked me if I could imagine a life in London among Muggles, studying something such purposeless like art instead of working at the wizardry Ministry for a higher position and talking with my hands, I would have laughed rather cruelly.</p><p>But now it was like this and I wouldn't wish for anything else.</p><p>Emma, my best friend, and little security huskie was lying next to my aisle. Her belly right up in the air and snoring loudly.</p><p>After the war, I wasn't able to function properly.</p><p>The Wizengamot had decided that I shouldn't go to Azkaban, I had been a child when everything happened. </p><p>The testimony of Potter and his minions certainly was a big aspect why they had chosen this.</p><p>But I wasn't allowed to see anyone who had been a follower of the Dark Lord.</p><p>I had lost the meaning of life. With my father in Azkaban and Mother locked up in the Manor, I was alone and terrified.</p><p>Nearly all of my friends and their families had supported the monster who had destroyed my life. The one who hadn't had left the country fast enough, wouldn't want to stay in contact with a known Death Eater.</p><p>I lost my closest friends. Theo was in Azkaban and would remain there for another thirty or forty years.</p><p>Greg....he had killed himself. Hours before the members of the Gamot wanted to punish him for his and his fathers sins.</p><p>A guard had told me. A sly grin on his face.</p><p>Greg had hung himself in the cell right next to me. If he would have called, maybe I had been able to signal him, that I was there.</p><p>Somehow it had broken me the most.</p><p>Blaise being in Italy and Pansy vanished from the earth, I was utterly alone.</p><p>My probation had said I needed to go back to Hogwarts as well. With no friends, no allies and no family, I had been an easy victim.</p><p>And it's not that I couldn't understand the students in Hogwarts.</p><p>Most of them had lost friends or family members as well, much more brutally than I had.</p><p>There was a memorial wall next to the Great Hall. Reminding us all what had happened and who was responsible.</p><p>So when they went after me, I just ...didn't do anything against it.</p><p>Maybe I had hoped that one of them would finish it. Kill me out of justice.</p><p>I certainly shouldn't be in Hogwarts, shouldn't be alive. And I prayed, hoped and begged they would do it.</p><p>But suddenly the attacking stopped and I was still alive, even if I didn't want to be.</p><p>After that anger of being there and others were dead, like this kid Collin, I tried it myself. More than once.</p><p>I didn't want to live, didn't had the energy anymore. The darkness had sought me and filled my inside.</p><p>After I tried to finish me off and woke up in the hospital wing with a stern looking Madam Pomfrey, Granger came and some things changed. She helped me to learn a new way to communicate and to settle in the society after this war.</p><p>The thoughts, the wish for death, however, didn't stop.</p><p>Although I went to visit Healer Melbourn nearly every day and I talked about the shit I went through in the war, nothing changed.</p><p>One day, Mrs. Melbourn and Granger took me to a Muggle Organization and there I found Emma.</p><p>Or, well, Emma found me.</p><p>She had been sitting in one of the rooms and when we went in, I had abruptly a white dog in my lap.</p><p>I couldn't go without her and since this day, I wasn't alone anymore.</p><p>Emma didn't judge me for the things that happened.</p><p>She just loved me, unconditionally.</p><p>And I did the same.</p><p>Still do, by the way.</p><p>I hadn't heard the door and the voices or maybe I had just been too far in my mind and ignored them, so when Mrs. Wilbery, one of my professors, called after me, I jerked out of my thoughts.</p><p>With a last look at the woman and my sketch, I turned around and froze.</p><p>Next to my professor and, surprisingly Luna, were Potter and Weasley.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>They looked...grown up and somehow neat. Different than the last time I had seen both.</p><p>Potters hair was still messy and stood in different directions, but he had lost his awful glasses over the time and the green eyes were piercing sharp.</p><p>Weasley had grown a beard. His red hair had darkened a bit, not the unmistakable copper anymore, but somehow chestnut red. The man had become a bit taller and his shoulders were broad. The muscular arms clearly visible under the shirt. The Auror training had definitely paid off.</p><p>One thing hadn't changed at all: the thousand little freckles were sprinkled over his face. He looked...good.</p><p>They both were wearing the official Auror robes for the Muggle society. All reputable and serious.</p><p>This could mean only one thing:</p><p>My father. Something had happened.</p><p>"Draco?", Amber whispered and I jumped slightly.</p><p>Slowly, very slowly I started to move and Luna went to meet me in the middle.</p><p>She was smiling brightly and I was somehow relieved to see her with them.</p><p>Someone how knew me and understood me.</p><p>I needn't be scared. The panic mustn't rise inside me.</p><p>Everything was good.</p><p>Except, it wasn't...</p>
