    <p>Harry woke up alone.</p><p>That was the first thing he noticed. The silence. He was expecting screams of the wounded or at least some whimmering. The battle in Hogwarts, that must have had just taken place, had coused a great deal of people to be hurt. He wouldn´t have been surprised by a conserned whisper of the adults. He had woken up next to Dumbledore one too many times to not expect it. But the absence of even the usual hospital noices concerned him.</p><p>Harry tried to push the blanket off of him but it felt a lot heavier than anything he was used to. He almost felt crushed by it. That was probably the reason for the sweat Harry felt gliscening in.</p><p>He freed himself oft he massive amount of fluff that he was buried under and only now realized what he was wearing. It was a silk pyjama and had nothing on the soft and light shirt he normaly wore. The blue silk that was draping down his body seemed to fit someone a lot more pretentious. He thought that Malfoy would have loved it.</p><p>The sweat, that seemed to be all over his body, made the silk kling to him and Harry felt the need to take a shower or at least get this horrible material off of him.</p><p>He looked around the room and was shocked by the sheer size of everything he saw including the room itself. It seemed to be a master bedroom he would have suspected in a manor. He couldn´t help but wonder again how he´d gotten here. Nothing seemed to make any sense.</p><p>Maybe one of the authorities had him transfered to a place they found more appropriate for the savior of the wizarding world. Had he been out for long? Where his friends very worried about him? Were they even alive? This thought shocked him. He felt horrible for not thinking of them first. For allowing himself to think more about the kind of clothes he wore then Ron and Hermione who could be dying a door over.<br/>
He had to get out.</p><p>Now having a goal in mind, he knew what he had to do. It was always easier to push himself if he was doing it for someone else.<br/>
Still feeling very uncomfortable in his pyjamas, he slid out oft he bed and walked over to the gigantic wooden door that seemed to dominate the entire wall. Expectig the door to be heavy, he pushed more forceful than he would have had to and promptly stumbled onto the hallway. </p><p>The floor of the hallway was marble and shined like it had just been polished. The hallway itself was just as impressive as the room Harry woke up in. The walls were high and the doors along them were just as old and heavy looking as the one he stumbled from. </p><p>Harry decided on a direction and marched on, keeping himself close to the wall. He did not know if that would bring him any tactical advantages, but it did make him feel more secure.<br/>
He walked through a few of identical hallways and started to come to the conclusion that maybe he was left alone in a giant maze. But then he heard a ratteling noise, that sounded a lot like metal on metal. It reminded him oft he pots and pans in Mollys kitchen that never quite seemed to evade each other as she made them fly. He followed the familiar noise through another hallway whose doors looked slightly smaller and a bit less gaudy.</p><p>Harry opened the door the noises seemed to come from. This door was apparently just as oiled as the one he opened before. It slid open silently. Inside was a kitchen, though it did not look like the normal kitchen he would have expected. It reminded him more oft he gigantic kitchen of Hogwarts, but without the masses of house elfs that wanted to wait on him as much as he would allow, which wasn´t a lot since Hermione´s SPEW campainge. He feared she would cancel their friendship if he dared treating the house elfs less than he would another wizard. Not that he had any intention of doing that anyway. </p><p>No, in this kitchen was only one person. Although by his clothes one could almost assume him to be a house elf, his hight definetly made him out to be a wizand or at least a muggle. He was facing away from Harry and had apparently not noticed him yet.</p><p>The first thing Harry noticed about him was not however his clothes or his bowed posture. It was his long blond almost white hair that hang mattet down his back. He could have recognised these once flowing strands everywere. </p><p>Harry took a step backwards and almost stumbled over his own feet. </p><p>„Lucius… Malfoy…“</p><p>I was not more than a whisper but the figure in the kitchen heard him nontheless. He turned around and Harry almost screamed. It was definitely the older Malfoy, but time hadn´t been good to him. His face looked emaciated. The hollowness of his eyes made it sem like there was noone behind them. If Harry hadn´t known better he would have guessed he´d been starved or tourtured. And to be honest, he did not know better. </p><p>Harry scambled to his feet and ran.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Lucius felt pure horror as he saw who was standing at the entrance of the kitchen, but tried to not let his shock show on his face. His Master had only once before deighed himself to come down here instead of calling Lucius to him and that was one of the worst experiences Lucius ever had the pleasure of experiencing. He was not looking forwand of reliving that night in particular.</p><p>He did not know what he had done to provoke such extreme messures, but he would not need to. The only thing that counted now was to be good to not anger his master further. The last time he had stolen an apple to feed his son with. He of course knew by now that that was very wrong and that he deserved every second oft he following punishment, but the hardest part he was still struggeling with was, that he had not seen Draco since that punishment was carried out two month ago. With the physical pain he could deal, but not knowing how his son was doing and if he was even alive drove him more crazy than any corporal punishment could ever have done. Not even the house elf were allowed to give him the smallest bit of information and would refuse no matter how hard he begged.</p><p>He sank to his knees. „My Lord“ he whispered. Nothing he could do now could lessen whatever punishment was awaiting him now, but that didn´t mean he had to worsen his situation by not showing absolute submission. He only hoped that his Lord would keep Draco out of any punishment he had planed. </p><p>After he heard the footsteps of his master move away he allowed himself the small pleasure of a sigh and called Dobby. He bowed his head as he heard the pop announcing the arrival of the house elf. He was as a slave of the house obviously lower than a free servant of his lord.</p><p>Lucius asked Dobby to look after the food still cooking on the stove and set to following his master out the kitchen. He just cought the pitying look the house elf gave him.</p>
