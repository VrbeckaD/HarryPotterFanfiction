  <strong> ACT I : Three Makes For A Crowded Place</strong>
</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">He enters the stage of her life on a Friday morning as her train is thundering through London’s underground.</p><p class="Standard">Lily is on her commute to work and it’s not pretty. It's 7.11AM and sure, she has put her make up on and she is wearing a smart, navy dress, but last she checked she still looked like a lorry had reverse parked on her face. The tube is filled with tourists, who think they'll be the only ones who thought about getting up early. She assumes they're on their way to snap a photo of Big Ben or some other tourist trap. In any case they're loud and obnoxious and Lily can't wait to get off, even if that means being back at the hospital a little sooner.</p><p class="Standard">Then, as the tube slows down at Westminster Station, something happens that Lily never believed to be real. Letting her eyes wander over the people standing on the platform, her gaze gets stuck on a mop of wild, black hair.</p><p class="Standard">And so time stops.</p><p class="Standard">The hair is attached to a man wearing a classic trench coat over a white shirt and jeans and it takes Lily only a second to decide, that this is the most gorgeous human being she has ever laid eyes upon and that she is, in fact, in love.</p><p class="Standard">In this instant she experiences such a ridiculous high – a rush of euphoria so powerful that her mouth goes dry – that she’s actually tempted to look around herself for whoever must have dosed her with fentanyl, because this is decidedly <em>not </em>normal.</p><p class="Standard">Lily thinks dehydration.<br/>
Lily thinks meningioma.<br/>
Lily thinks neurosyphilis.</p><p class="Standard">Lily thinks she’s being really fucking ridiculous.</p><p class="Standard">But that doesn’t stop her from hungrily consuming the sight of him – from dark rimmed glasses to olive skin – she shamelessly eats him with her eyes, like she has never done to a man before.</p><p class="Standard">When the train comes to a halt, she’s so far gone that she goes stumbling into the people around her, because her arms have gone slack at her sides instead of holding onto a bar, as they should.</p><p class="Standard">Still, time is malfunctioning and as she keeps watching him through her hair floating in slow motion, he does something she thinks she'll never forget in her life: he turns, their eyes meet and this stranger – this beautiful, <em>beautiful</em> stranger – starts smiling at her. It's a slightly crooked smile, the left corner of his mouth pulls up a bit higher, giving him a mischievous air.</p><p class="Standard">It goes straight through her.</p><p class="Standard">It’s filling her with light and warmth and a curious sense of wonder that such a marvelous thing should be bestowed upon her of all people.</p><p class="Standard">Lily has never believed in love at first sight – she barely believes in any type of love at this point – but she smiles back at him, allowing herself to be swept up by the moment. Maybe it’s hypoglycaemia (she’s skipped breakfast again), maybe it’s the exhaustion (Lily is in her second year of speciality training) or maybe, just maybe, this is real and she somehow managed to manifest the man of her dreams in this dirty tube station at 7 in the morning.</p><p class="Standard">Then the train stops and time snaps back to its normal speed.</p><p class="Standard">The doors slide open and people start to push themselves out of the car like lava making its way through the landscape. He's still smiling at her and – oh god – he's moving towards her now, too.</p><p class="Standard">And Lily realizes she doesn't know what to do.</p><p class="Standard">Despite having been forced to watch romantic comedies by the dozen, she has no idea what follows now. Do they break out in song? Is she allowed to jump into his arms dirty dancing style? Will the crowd miraculously move around them as they kiss on the platform?</p><p class="Standard">She doesn't know. She really doesn't <em>know</em>, but she also doesn't care because this is too special, too precious and she doesn't want to spoil the sheer magic of it with her overthinking.</p><p class="Standard">He's almost in front of her now, just a few more steps – and Lily is <em>ready.</em></p><p class="Standard">Ready for whatever this might turn out to be. Miraculously unafraid and, for once, open to letting herself be carried whereever by her feelings. She feels brave all of a sudden, not thinking anymore about what all the night shifts might have done to her face.</p><p class="Standard">Then, as he's only a meter or so away, he –</p><p class="Standard">He –</p><p class="Standard">He –</p><p class="Standard">He bends down to the petite blonde right in front of her – a plain woman Lily hadn't paid attention to at all – and he <em>embraces</em> her.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Tightly. Intimately. <em>Lovingly.</em></p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Lily has to clasp a hand over her mouth to keep from giving a pathetic gasp at the tragic scene unfolding before her.</p><p class="Standard">She quickly steps around the couple, her heart still pumping hard from all the built up anticipation, and walks towards the nearest exit. Her brain screams <em>flight!</em> at her and her field of vision has narrowed in on the «WAY OUT» signs, but right before she reaches the last escalator some cruel masochism apparently inherent to her makes her stop and look back.</p><p class="Standard">They are right behind her.</p><p class="Standard">He has one arm around her shoulder now, pulling her close while they're both laughing at something and Lily tries not to imagine that they're making fun of her. They look like they've known each other for ages – the way she rolls her eyes at him, how he playfully pokes her sides.</p><p class="Standard">It's downright <em>painful.</em></p><p class="Standard">And still, Lily can't stop herself from pretending to study the tube map on the wall until they've passed her and then, because she is truly, extraordinarily stupid, she follows them out of the station. Luckily for her, they seem to walk in her direction, exiting the station and crossing Westminster bridge. Like a fucking creep, she keeps close enough to listen in on their conversation.</p><p class="Standard">“Alright, that <em>is</em> true,” the Blonde says, and Lily can't help but notice what a sweet voice she has, “but I still feel bad, that you came all the way here only because of me.”</p><p class="Standard">“Bollocks, Ava,” he says, “what else would I be doing?”</p><p class="Standard">“I don't know – maybe not wrestling American tourists on your day off, though,” she replies with a disdainful look towards a particularly loud group that is blocking the sidewalk in order to take some photos.</p><p class="Standard">“I'm planning to come back later and photobomb as many of their pictures as possible.”</p><p class="Standard">He looks down at her, seemingly gauging her reaction, but she’s still scrunching up her nose at the group.</p><p class="Standard">“What? No reprimands? No, <em>Don't be mean, James!</em> ?“ he asks amused.</p><p class="Standard">(<em>James</em>? Fuck, his name was perfect too...)</p><p class="Standard">“You know, I might even join you, if they continue to screech like that.”</p><p class="Standard">He laughs at that.</p><p class="Standard">(It’s a beautiful laugh.)</p><p class="Standard">Lily is still trudging behind them, trying not to start crying or otherwise losing her shit, when she notices that they start walking towards the Evelina, the children’s hospital she’s currently working at.</p><p class="Standard">“How about you use your free time instead to come have dinner at my parent’s place?“</p><p class="Standard">“I’m not driving out to Buckinghamshire, if I have to be here at 8 again tomorrow,“ she groans in response.</p><p class="Standard">Lily almost groans, too: Dinner with his <em>parents – </em>ugh.</p><p class="Standard">To make things worse – although she didn’t believe it to be possible – they were almost at the staff entrance now and Ava, for that seems to be her name, turns toward the love of Lily’s life and says: “Well, it was lovely getting walked here, as was the coffee and the danish.“ She smiles warmly at him, holding up an empty wrapper.</p><p class="Standard">Jesus Christ, Lily had been so absorbed by her thoughts, that she hadn’t even noticed that he had brought her breakfast.</p><p class="Standard">He had brought her breakfast. At 7am. On his day off.</p><p class="Standard">Godfuckingdammit.</p><p class="Standard">She suddenly can’t bear it anymore and quickly steps around the two, holds her card up to the reader and slipps through the door the second it opens.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Fuck. </p><p class="Standard">Fuck.</p><p class="Standard">
  <em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p class="Standard">
  <em>   </em>
</p><p class="Standard">It wasn’t fair.</p><p class="Standard">Why would her brain chemistry or the universe or whoever make her believe she had just met the love of her life when that man was clearly busy being perfect for someone else?</p><p class="Standard">She changes into her scrubs, pins up her hair, all the while grumbling to herself, until one of her colleagues appears next to her.</p><p class="Standard">“Morning, Lily,“ Sanam says, checking her headscarf in the mirror.</p><p class="Standard">“Mrhmpf.“</p><p class="Standard">Sanam turns, surprised at Lily’s uncharacteristic grumpiness. “Are you quite alright there?“</p><p class="Standard">Lily is debating for a moment if she should say anything and, if so, what. Sanam and Lily haven’t known eachother for long and the other woman is of a decidedly pragmatic nature. Telling her what she thought had just transpired might certainly result in ridicule and although such would be well deserved, she doesn’t think her ego could bear it.</p><p class="Standard">“I’m just being an idiot,“ she mutters instead, but that doesn’t seem to appease her fellow surgeon.</p><p class="Standard">“You’re not an idiot otherwise you wouldn’t be here, Lily,“ Sanam scoffs and exits the staff changing room.</p><p class="Standard">Lily says nothing but trails close behind her. She is about to tell Sanam a less dramatic version of what just happened at the tube station, when she sees how Mary has decorated the nurses’ station: the whole door frame is covered in red, plastic roses and a big sign reads HAPPY VALENTINE’S DAY to top if off.</p><p class="Standard">“It’s Valentine’s Day,“ Lily chokes out.</p><p class="Standard">Sanam shrugs. “Capitalist hogwash, if you ask me.“</p><p class="Standard">A strange, high-pitched sound escapes Lily and the other woman spins around to look at her.</p><p class="Standard">“Lily, are you sure you’re not sick or something?“</p><p class="Standard">She tries to laugh in response, but it doesn’t sound right.</p><p class="Standard">“Fuck, I might be.“</p><p class="Standard">Lovesick, that is.</p><p class="Standard"> </p>
