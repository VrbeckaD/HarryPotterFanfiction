    <h1>Forest Fairy Percy</h1><p>Once upon a time there was a little forest fairy in the deepest parts of the forbidden forest. He stayed there surrounded by the oldest of trees. He wasn’t completely alone, since the forest was home to many other creatures, but he was the only one of his kind. Long ago he had wandered there from Ireland. Sometimes he felt alone. But most of the time he was happy to be around all the trees and forest creatures.</p><p>That was until a tiny boy found his way into the forest. Deep into the woods that were supposed to be forbidden for the students of the school nearby. But he didn’t look scared. Instead the boy with the reddish hair looked like he was enjoying himself. Eyes as big as saucers. Looking around in wonder.</p><p>Still, the fairy watched the little boy wander around, having been informed by the trees of this change. The fairy had always made sure that the students found their way back to the school, but weirdly enough, this one didn’t even look like he was looking for a way back.</p><p>The thing is, Newt wasn’t afraid of the forest. Quite the opposite. He grew up with Hippogriffs and a forest similar to this one, filled with creatures he had made friends with. And now he wanted to make friends with the inhabitants of this forest too.</p><p>The fairy Percival on the other hand wanted to bring Newt back to Hogwarts. Preferably without being seen.</p><p>Because he had found humans to be mostly cruel. Especially to smaller beings like he was. Butterflies and beetles being stabbed with needles and put onto walls. Animals being hunted just for sport. </p><p>Yes he made sure the children returned to the school, but only in hopes that the parents won’t come and burn the forest down.</p><p>Just with this child he had a real problem.</p><p>Because every time he laid out markers that would have led Newt out of the woods, the boy would deliberately choose the other direction that would lead deeper into them instead.</p><p>He would awe at all the creatures he found, even making friends with a Niffler because he gave him a shiny coin. He would be respectful to anything he came across and for some reason part of the creatures seemed to be curious about the boy too. Percival was confused how the wild creatures of the forest could actually move closer to the boy to inspect.</p><p>Especially something as pure as the unicorn.</p><p>None of them seemed to actually worry about the child.</p><p>Still, Percival didn’t give up.</p><p>He wanted the child out of the woods!!! So he would lay down even more obvious markers. Even going as far as WRITING things down, like: Danger! Go back! Don’t go deeper! I warn you!!!</p><p>But Newt would just look at the writings and smile.<br/>
And of course doing the exact opposite, the little devil.</p><p>By the time Percival was close to give up, his whole dress was rumpled. His hair an absolute mess instead of his usual straight laid back hair. A frown on his face and wings beating even faster than normal, clearly irritated.</p><p>In the end he opted to just fly angrily right into the face of the young boy, chattering angrily that he “should go back, it’s dangerous, he has nothing to do here, LEAVE ALREADY!!”</p><p>But instead of heeding that warning, he actually laughed out loud with a happy: “Finally!!”</p><p>It confused Percival so much that he stopped his irritated noises right away.<br/>
Newt smiled brightly at him, nearly glowing himself and Percival for the first time wondered if this was actually a human being or a creature in its own right.</p><p>“I thought a fairy would live in the woods! After the first hint outside. I really just wanted to meet you! My name is Newt! What’s yours?”</p><p>The boy was talking so fast, Percival was too slow to react to his own mouth voicing “Percival “ in a stunned voice.</p><p>“Hello Percival! It’s really great that you wanted to lead me outside, but I really wanna see all the creatures living here! Are you the only one here? Are there more of you? Can you show me around?”</p><p>Percival was too stunned to react to anything, but silence with all the questions asked, as if there was no tomorrow and without taking breaths.</p><p>End of the story, Percival was too stunned and just couldn’t win against Newt, so he capitulated and instead showed the boy around. Even helped him find certain creatures and make friends with them. Better keep the boy safe while being around him, instead of leaving him alone and maybe let him die by an unfriendly creature.</p><p>It ended with them becoming friends, since Newt really wasn’t good with making human friends.</p><p>But one day, the older boy returned with tears in his eyes to the forest and called for Percival. Who appeared shortly after, happy to see his friend again, only to stop short because of the tears. He finds out that Newt is being expelled for something he hadn’t done, but would keep it to himself to help someone out. And that he is sorry that he has to leave and that he would miss Percival sooooooo much.</p><p>But Percy who couldn’t think of living alone in the forest, without his friend (and secret crush), who had already been thinking to follow Newt when he finished his education, just shook his head.</p><p>“Idiot. You won’t need to miss me, if I come along.” And smirks (which is to hide his own nervousness).</p><p>Newt just stares for a moment, mouth open in surprise, eyes wide and then he suddenly smiles his impossibly wide smile again and crushes the fairy into his chest.</p><p>“Thank you!”</p>
