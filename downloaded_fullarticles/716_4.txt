          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale begins during The Marauders' era at Hogwarts. Peter, Remus and Sirius are trying to teach James how he can be less arrogant in order to win Lily's affection.</p><p>James asked, "Where do we even begin?"</p><p>Remus told him, "Pretend Peter is Lily, if she just approached you right now, what would you say to her?"</p><p>Peter pretended to approach James and put on a high pitched voice, "Hey, James. How are you today?"</p><p>James transformed into an entirely different person. He sort of slouched his posture slightly and his demeanour became more aggressive.</p><p>He smirked. "What's it to you?"</p><p>Remus scowled. "No, no, no. That's why she rejected you in the first place, Prongs. When you're near her, it's like you're not you. Act like you would around us."</p><p>Peter pretended to approach James again and in his girly voice beamed, "Well, hello there James. How are you this fine day?"</p><p>James began to slouch back.</p><p>Remus reprimanded him, "Keep your posture straight!"</p><p>James straightened back up and that aggressive glint came back to his eyes.</p><p>Remus shouted, "Don't look so aggressive!"</p><p>James smiled. "I'm good, thanks for asking Lily. How are you?"</p><p>Remus exclaimed, "You actually said two whole sentences without being arrogant!"</p><p>James gasped. "I did?"</p><p>Sirius who had been silently observing them said, "You did, but for Merlin's sake Moony how is this poor man gonna get a girl with that hair?"</p><p>Remus blushed. "I, uh, hadn't thought of that, Padfoot."</p><p>Sirius turned to James and reassured him, "I can fix, well this fashion disaster."</p><p>James mumbled, "Thanks?"</p><p>Sirius grinned. "You're most welcome! Now, where can I find a hair stylist this late at night?"</p><p>He went away over to his bed.</p><p>Peter suggested, "Why don't we keep practising, Prongs?"</p><p>James stated, "Good idea, Wormtail."</p></div>
