    <p>The ceiling were white, and the smell was sterile, as if the room had been dosed in lysol and bleach. The smell of medicine hanging in the room was overpowering to all the other scences. But he didnt know that. He couldnt decode smells as a normal person could.<br/>
His eyes opened and he looked up to the face hanging above his own. The look on her face was worried, but of course he couldnt tell you that himself.<br/>
"Are you ok? Can you speak?" The voice was soft and gentle. But he couldnt understand a word  she was speaking.<br/>
Tears sprang to the girls eyes as she looked into the void eyes of the man laying in the bed in front of her. He was alive... He had woken up even when all the odds were stacked against his survival.... He had lived.<br/>
A gurgling sound came from the man in the bed as his head turned to look at the new face.<br/>
"Its ok... Im not going anywhere. You will pull through." The girl said, wiping her hand across her face in a futile etempt to dry them. Another gurgling sound came from the man.<br/>
Her hands shook in his, so she gripped them tighter.<br/>
"Its ok, I promise, I will help you... Draco."<br/>
-<br/>
"Draco's condition is stable, but he has lost all of his cognetive abilities. He has to relearn everything... He has to start over from zero." The girl sighed, swiping her hand under her eyes again.<br/>
Narcissas Malfoy looked on the girl with her nerves and worry showing on her face as she waited for the woman to finish.<br/>
"At this point in time, he is nothing more then a newborn." A shaking hand was placed on the white coat on her shoulders in a comforting manner.<br/>
"Astoria... Thank you so much for what you and your father have done. You saved his life..." Cissa said smiling with relief.<br/>
Her baby had made it through the worst... He had survived.<br/>
"Astoria... His memories... Does he still..." Cissa began, but astoria stopped her with a hand.<br/>
"No... He has lost everything Cissa. I just said he has to start over. There is still a possibility that they will return to him one day, but the chances of that happening are very slim..." Cissa nodded her head, then grabbed onto Astoria's hands, looking into her face.<br/>
"Then make me a promise... Please." Cissa began. " Do not tell him. Dont tell him anything about what happened. How he was before... Who he was before... Dont you understand. We can give him a brand new life!" Cissa said, smiling down at astoria. "The dark and unhappy Draco... He is gone. We can make sure that he stays away. He will finally be able to be happy." Cissa shook Astoria's hands for emphasis.<br/>
"Cissa, I dont know..."<br/>
"Please... Astoria. If he were to ever find out, he would forever be trapped in his own darkness. This is a chance for us to pull him out. Give him a fresh new start."<br/>
Astoria knew the feeling deep inside of her was guilt. She knew what they were doing was wrong. But she nodded her head anyways.<br/>
-<br/>
His life was full of Demons he had been fighting since the death of his father, and emotions that he had absolutly no control over. PTSD is a serious illness and not to be taken lightly.<br/>
He had found himself in the eyes of a girl who he had loved more then his own life. A kind of love that strips you down to your barest of bare's and leaves you raw and as wide open as a book.<br/>
If you had told him, he had spent his last memonts as Draco Malfoy with the girl who pieced him together... He would have laughed. Because Draco was of course Draco... But at the moment, even he didnt know that.<br/>
(Hermione: Age 8)<br/>
The soft piano melody filled the room as her little fingers hit each key at the right moment. She had never felt happier in her entire eight year old life. But her heart was tugging in a painful twitch when she looked around and couldnt see her father's face in the crowd of people.<br/>
The final cord was played and she rested her hands at her side, then turned and bowed to the crowd. He aunt Nelly was quickly making her way up the steps to the stage, snatching the recorder that had been resting on the piano, and grabbed her hand.<br/>
"Auntie... Daddy never showed up..." Hermione sniffled, wiping her eyes.<br/>
"Its ok sweetheart. I recorded it. Daddy can listen to it in the car. Come on, he should be outside waiting." Hermione was gently tugged outside the double door where her father was pulling up in his red car.<br/>
"Daddy!" Hermione yelled, running up to her father who picked her up and spun her around.<br/>
"Happy birthday Darling." He whispered, smoothing down her hair and placing a doll in his daughters arms.<br/>
Hermione smiled widely at the doll in her little hands.<br/>
"Do you like your doll Darling?" He asked, then laughed when Hermione's smile got wider, and she nodded her head vigorously. Her brown mop of curls bouncing every which way.<br/>
With a kiss on her head, he placed her into the car and they shortly took to the road.<br/>
"Listen Daddy, you missed my recital." Hermione said, as she pushed the tape with her recording on it into the player and waiting for the melodic music to begin to fill the inside of the car.<br/>
"Well, you sound just as good as Bach himself." Hermione smiled to her father, then kissed his cheek.<br/>
"Of course. Her instructer gave praise to her directly. She had said that Hermione has the perfect hands for a pianist, and is perfect in every way with her performances." Nelly said, smiling widely as her brother in law.<br/>
"Daddy, when are you going to teach me the concerto in G- Major?" Hermione prattled on as they drove downt the road.<br/>
"Which one do you want?" Aunt nelly asked Hermione as she took in each cake in the window before settling her eyes on a big strawberry one.<br/>
"That one." She said pointing to it. Aunt nelly sighed.<br/>
"Alright, but I forgot my money in the car, go ask your daddy to come pay for it while I get it ordered."<br/>
Hermione skipped off to the edge of the sidewalk were she saw her Daddy walking across the road's walkway talking on the phone.<br/>
Hermione saw it before he did, the car that was coming way to fast down the road, it wouldnt have be able to stop.<br/>
"Daddy!!!" Hermione screamed as she watched the car hit her father. He rolled over the hood and fell off the end of the car in a heap on the ground.<br/>
"Daddy!!" Hermione took off running, tripping over her shoe, she landed on her belly beside him, looking deep into his dead eyes.<br/>
Blood seeped from his head and onto the concrete of the road they both layed on.<br/>
Moments went by, and only her tears seemed to be real to her.<br/>
A shrill scream pulled her to her feet. Her aunt nelly ran passed her, kneeling ont he ground.<br/>
"Author!!! Author!!!" Nelly looked around frantically. "Where is the ambulance! someone call the ambulance..." She watched frantically as people walked passed them as if they were nothing.<br/>
Hermione stood in the road and watched, the rain coming down hard on them. The thunder rolled in the distance and lightning struck ahead. People walked by without a second glance and her father layed in the road... Her aunt's frantic pleas for help, and the thunder in the clouds were her only company<br/>

(Two weeks later)<br/>
"Even if we sold everything in this house, There still wouldnt be enough! Who do you take me for you little bitch!" Hermione hid in the corner as her aunt confronted the big men in their house, takin their things away from them.<br/>
"Im sorry, I just need more time to get the money. Please. Let us keep this. Ill pay you back..." A resound crack was heard, then Aunt Nelly fell to the floor cradling her cheek.<br/>
"Time is up." The man said, before signaling for his men to begin loading all of the furniture into the trucks waiting outside.<br/>
The men lifted the piano, and Hermione ran out of her corner, grabbing ahold of the white grand piano.<br/>
"NO! YOU CANT HAVE IT!" She yelled, holding onto the top the best she can.<br/>
"Let go kid!" One of the men grunted.<br/>
"NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!" She yelled, tears streaking down her face as she shook her head.<br/>
"Hermione, let it go!" Her aunt yelled, prying the little girls fingers from the instument.<br/>
"NO! Auntie!" Hermione cried, watching the men cart her most precious posession out.<br/>
-<br/>
(Four weeks later)<br/>
"I want my Daddy!!!!" Hermione stood in the bathroom of a hotel room as her auntie packed her bags back up. "I want my daddy!!!" She yelled, the tears leaking from her eyes.<br/>
"Hermione, Shut up! Why are you crying! Your Daddy is dead! He's Dead!!! I should be the one crying!!! I was stuck with you!! We have nothing!!! No Home! No Money! Nothing!!! Do you hear me!!!! NOTHING!!"<br/>
-<br/>
(Five weeks later)<br/>
The bus was cold and packed. Nelly looked beside her. Hermione had fallen asleep on her shoulder. snoring as if everything was ok. Nelly loved her. But Nelly knew she couldnt give her anything. And probably never will be able to again. But One thing she knew for sure... She would never be able to make anything of herself with a little girl tagging along.<br/>
Softly, Nelly pushed Hermione over to lean on the window, quickly she gathered her bags and ran to the driver.<br/>
"Sir, please let me off here." Nelly said softly, looking behind her to make sure Hermione had not woken up. When she bus came to a stop, she left and didnt look back as it drove away.<br/>
Nelly had not gotten far when she heard the familier sounds of the bus breaks.<br/>
"Aunt Nelly!" Looking behind her, she grimaced and rolled her eyes.<br/>
"What are you doing Hermione?!" Nelly yelled at the little girl. "Where is your Doll." She asked, pulling her bags more securely on her shoulder.<br/>
"I dont want the doll... I want you Auntie." Hermione said softly wiping the tears that fell from her eyes.<br/>
Nelly felt her own tears swelling up in her eyes. With a sigh, she turned and walked away.<br/>
"Well come on then." Nelly said, and hermione ran up beside her. wiping her face with her dirty sleeve.<br/>
-<br/>
(Six weeks later)<br/>
They had been walking on the busy streets of London for days. The smell of food being sold on the sidewalks made them hungrier each day they went without.<br/>
Night was closing in on them fast. And they were setting up for the night when a man walking home from work saw them huddled in a corner of broken down boxes.<br/>
Kneeling down, he smiled at the two.<br/>
"Hello there. My name is Danny." He smiled again. Hermione tucked herself further into her aunts side. The way the man smiled at them made her have bad feelings. She didnt like it.<br/>
"Look at you two. Dirty and starving away..." The man looked as if he was pondering a thought, then held his hand out to Aunt Nelly.<br/>
"Come back to my place. you can both clean up and get something good to eat." He smiled again. His eyes trailing off to land on Hermione who tucked herself away the best she could.<br/>
"No, Auntie... please." Hermione whispered as her aunt took his hand and was pulled to her feet.<br/>
"Hermione, do not be ungreatful. Say thank you and come on." She scolded Hermione.<br/>
So what was supposed to be a one night thing, turned out to be weeks, months... then soon the years flew by.<br/>
Hermione never shook the feeling she got when she first laid eyes on the sinister smile of her, now, uncle Danny.<br/>
But she stayed strong, and worked day in and day out. Saving money to one day go to college and get herself and her aunt out from under her uncle Danny.<br/>
But no matter what she did or how many steps she got ahead... she was always going to be a few steps behind him... Forever living her life running in a circle... Forever playing a dangerous game of cat and mouse...<br/>
Hermione pulled herself out of her daydream, readjusting her bag strap around over her shoulder.<br/>
The bus bumped down the road. Hermione, placed the wine bottle beside her. Grabbing an invelope from her bag, she pulled out her earnings from the day and slipped them into it.<br/>
"Just a little while longer." She whispered to herself, kissing the envelope that held her life savings.<br/>
Registrations fee's were not cheap. And she had been saving up since she was old enough to do an honest days work.<br/>
Lifting her hands up, she stared at the scars that marred them from all of her work.<br/>
Long, slender fingers, perfect for playing the piano, now carried many scars and imperfections. She would be lying to herself if she said she didnt miss playing.<br/>
Playing the piano was the only thing that she could do to feel close to her father.<br/>
Hermione's head shot up when a persistant honking pulled her from her thoughts.<br/>
"Oh... look at that corvette!" Passengers from the bus flocked to the windows to look at the passing car.<br/>
Just then, the bus jerked to a stop. Hermione cought herself on the seat infront of her. Her wine toppled to the floor and rolled down the isle and busted on a rail.<br/>
"No... No no no..." jumping to her feet she ran down to the front, picking up the broken bottle.<br/>
"You have got to be kidding me!" She yelled in frustration, throwing the broken pieces in the trashcan.<br/>
"Im sorry miss, but I didnt have a choice..." She raised her hand and smiled softly at the rattled bus driver.<br/>
"Its ok." She said, walking back to her seat and grabbing her bag.<br/>
Hermione stomped off of the bus and saw a sleek black corvette with the top down parked infront of it. A couple sat in the car having a spat.<br/>
"Draco, What are you doing. I told you im sorry. If you dont want me to except gifts from other men, then I wont. Your all I want baby." The girl in the front seat rubbed her hands down the leather clad arm of the man in the driver seat.<br/>
"Get out." His voice was deep but smooth like velvet. Hermione could feel it crawling all over her, but stood her ground. She marched up to the car.<br/>
"I told you im sorry already baby... how about we go back to my place and... talk about it more..." The girl purred like a kitten.<br/>
Hermione felt like gagging at the show in front of her.<br/>
"Excuse me, could you please move your car. There are people trying to get home." She said, the irritation showing in her voice and face.<br/>
The man in the driver seat looked up at Hermione and smiled a crooked grin.<br/>
"Well Hi there. Call me Draco... Whats your name beautiful." Draco said, pulling his shades from his eyes and winking at Hermione. The girl beside him sputtered a few times before huffing quickly before Hermione could shoot him down herself.<br/>
"It doesnt matter." She addressed toward Draco, then turned to Hermione. "Get lost girl. You dont have what it takes." She said, flicking her hair behind her and shimmying her top lower to show more clevage.<br/>
Hermione blinked once and raised an eyebrow.<br/>
"Excuse me, who are you?" She asked matter of factly.<br/>
"My names Pansy parkinson. Draco's girlfriend." She stated exasperated. Like having to simply answer a question was beneath her.<br/>
Hermione rolled her eyes and nodded.<br/>
"Well, pansy, I would gladly beat it if you could get Draco to move his car. There is a whole line up of cars behind the bus that you rudely... and dangerously I might add, stopped infront of. So move and we can all go home happy. Ok?" Hermione stated.<br/>
Draco's smirk widened. This girl had fire behind her innocent demeanor.<br/>
"You know what pansy, take the car. Think of it as a parting gift from me." Draco said, tossing the keys to her and jumping out of the car walking away.<br/>
"Draco, Wait. Why wont you just talk to me. I can be anything you want. I can make your fantasies come true, just give me a little of your time baby." She said, jumping out of the car chasing after him. She placed the keys back into his hand.<br/>
Hermione had seen enough. This display was rediculous an quite frankly, disgusting.<br/>
"Look, I dont care if you take her to the side of the road and shag her nappy hair from her head, just move the damn car so we can all go home." Hermione said, running up to them.<br/>
Draco looked down into her deep brown eyes and smiled.<br/>
"Why dont you move it." Draco handed her the keys and walked her to the driver side door. Hermione spun around, backing up against the car door when she noticed how close she was to him.<br/>
"I dont know how to drive." She said, holding the keys out to him. He reached around her, opening the door and guiding her inside the seat.<br/>
"Its ok, Ill be right here. Ill tell you how to do it. But it wont move unless you do it. So whats it gonna be? These nice people have to get home." He said, smirking at her scowl.<br/>
Hermione huffed, and slammed the driver door shut beside her.<br/>
"Ok, the first thing you need to do is start the car." Hermione leaned down, placed the keys into the ignition and turned softly. The car purred to life.<br/>
"Good job, see its not so har is it?" He smirked, crossing his arms. "Alright, now place your left foot over the left pedal and press is down, place your right foot ontop of the right pedal and just hold it. pull the gear shift all the way down." Hermione followed his instructions and felt the car jolt as the shifter went into place.<br/>
"Very good. Now your going to have to listen carefully on this one. you have to do it all in one. you ready?" He asked, eyeing hermione.<br/>
Hermione nodded her head.<br/>
"Place both of your hands securely on the wheel..." He started out slowly, watching as she did as she was told. His eyes shown with mischief along with his smirk. But she was to concentrated to notice. When she had the wheel in a death grip he continued in a fast tone.<br/>
"Lift your left foot then stomp on your right..."<br/>
Hermione immidiatly followed his instructions, doing it as quick as she possibly can so as not to make a mistake...<br/>
She luched forward as the car took off, then slammed back into the seat when a loud crash was heard. Looking behind her, she nearly vomited.<br/>
She had just crashed a corvette convertable into a damn street bus.....<br/>
"Im so screwed..." She moaned out, palming her forehead. Looking around, she shot daggers at Draco who was currently laughing at her expence.<br/>
"Good job..." He said, clapping his hands.</p>
