    <p>Harry was sitting on the carpet, besides their large evergreen Christmas tree, trying  his best to untangle a series of multi coloured fairy lights. So far, he was failing, as it was currently wrapped around him. Ginny had insisted that they decorate the tree the muggle way, since it was their first Christmas as a married couple, she wanted it to be extra special. </p><p>"Which colour do you think these baubles should be?" Ginny came in, wearing her fuzzy Weasley jumper, holding an ornament. "I was thinking," She flicked her wand. "Pink? No, red seems to fit the theme more." She flicked her wand once more, then finally settled on an icy silver colour. "Perfect!"</p><p>"I thought you said we weren't going to use magic..." Harry grumbled, pushing his round glasses to the bridge of his nose. </p><p>Ginny giggled, helping him untangle himself out of the mess of garland and lights. "I only wanted to see the different colours. Then we can go full muggle." She kissed his cheek softly. "I thought you would be more familiar with the way muggles do it."</p><p>Harry scoffed bitterly. "Hardly. The Dursleys never let me help decorate their tree. Usually I'd stay in the cupboard and wait until they were done. I've only ever celebrated Christmas with your family." </p><p>Ginny frowned, biting her lip. She didn't know why she said that, she was familiar with Harry's life before magic, but it hadn't really sunk in how truly different their childhoods had been. "I'm sorry." She said, feeling a bit dumb. </p><p>Harry shook his head. "It's all in the past, yeah? I didn't mean to make you feel bad. Come on Gin, let's go make this tree beautiful." His light green eyes twinkled with delight. </p><p>"It already /is/ beautiful. But you're right. Let's." </p><p>By the time an hour had past, the tree was lopsided somehow, and the lights were all dangling to the left. The ornaments were slipping off, one had even crashed to the ground. </p><p>"It's pathetic." Harry chuckled. </p><p>Ginny booped his nose. "No love, it's perfect." She leaned her head on his shoulder. "Okay, it's a little sad." </p><p>The two shared a loving kiss, looking forward to more Christmas decorating in their future.</p>
