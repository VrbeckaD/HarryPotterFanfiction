    <p>I looked around my home for the last time. Well, what was left of it. I lived in my half torn home for a week before any of my relatives responded. My Uncle Xenophilius was the only one willing to take me in on such short notice, or at all.</p>
<p>Last week, one curse is all it took to bring my world crashing down. My family and I heard news from London that Lord Voldemort had returned. But he hadn't been seen since the night of his return, until last week. He appeared out of thin air. My mother rushed my brother Newt and I to the basement. But not before I saw a flash of green light and my mother's body hit the floor. My dad came from behind trying to protect us. But it was too late, he went down as quickly as my mother. Suddenly I heard him. The dreaded snake like voice.</p>
<p>"Your parents were useless, now tell me where he is!" He hissed.</p>
<p>"I don't know who you are talking about! Leave us alone!" I screamed.</p>
<p>He growled and pointed his wand, but at Newt. Without thinking twice, I ran and pushed us both out of the way. There was an explosion and the ceiling came crashing down. That's when everything went black.</p>
<p>I woke up what felt like years later. I looked around to notice my parents lifeless bodies in between the rubble. I started running around looking, but there was no sign of Newt anywhere. I shifted rocks around only to find my wand crushed into pieces.</p>
<p>After the incident, I spent the rest of the week sending our family owl, Daryl, to other members of my family. My Uncle Xenophilius spent no time writing a reply saying he insists I come live with him and my cousin Luna. After that I wrote to my friend, yes singular, that I wouldn't be returning. I also wrote to Ilvermorny explaining my situation. It'll be hard taking my O.W.L's this year at a new school.</p>
<p>I wrote to so many people. With each letter I wrote, it became harder and harder to realize that my life has forever changed.</p>
<p>I woke up the morning of July 31st with my bags packed. I looked around my house and made sure I haven't forgotten anything. I had my two trunks and Daryl in his cage.</p>
<p>I heard a pop and Uncle Xenophilius appeared.</p>
<p>"Ohh my darling Lila, come here!" He engulfed me in a hug. I couldn't control my emotions and started balling into his arms. He comforted me. I knew I was going to be in good hands with him.</p>
<p>My uncle thought it best if I kept something of each of theirs. I kept my fathers favorite watch. It belonged to my grandfather. And from my mother I took her locket. It was gold with a red rose on top. Within it she had a photo of her and my father on one side, and the four of us on the other. These two objects mean the world to me now.</p>
<p>My Uncle and I decided it would be best if we properly buried my parents bodies. That way, if anyone came along, they wouldn't get a nasty shock.</p>
<p>After all of that was done, my Uncle took me to the portkey. With a quick pop we were in his cylinder shaped home. I smelled something cooking from the kitchen. I placed my trunks behind the couch and walked to the kitchen. I haven't been here since I was five, but I still remember the place well.</p>
<p>There in the kitchen was Luna. It's funny that we could almost be sisters with how similar we look. The only difference is that my pale blonde hair has pale pink within as well. Being a metamorphmargis, certain aspects of my looks are certainly out of the ordinary. My eyes are a pale purple, while Luna's eyes are blue with stars because her eyes are always in a daze.</p>
<p>I made a coughing sound because that's all I could muster. She turned around and wrapped her arms around me. We stayed like that for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Luna and I were incredibly close. Even though I've only ever seen her twice in person my whole life. We constantly send owls back and forth to keep up with one another's lives. We were similar in the aspect that we both only had one friend at school. But, we had each other as well and we were both pretty content with that.</p>
<p>"So, are you excited for school?" Luna asked. I forgot how dreamy her voice sounded. It was very comforting.</p>
<p>"I believe I am. It is just going toÂ  be new." I said.</p>
<p>"Ohh I know. But you'll have me." Luna said.</p>
<p>"And I couldn't be more thankful for it. But I just can't help worrying about Newt. He's only 13." I bit my lip thinking of all the horrible situations he could be in.</p>
<p>"Stop worrying. I can see it in your eyes. Newt is very clever. I know he can make it on his own. That's why he was named Newt in the first place. He's probably with a group of magical creatures to keep him calm." Luna laughed.</p>
<p>"That boy does love his dragons. But I feel guilty for being here while he's all the way home in America." I felt the tears form in my eyes.</p>
<p>Luna engulfed me in another hug but then let go as she heard Uncle Xenophilius enter the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Well Lila I put your things in Luna's room. I already conjured up a bed for you." Uncle Xenophilius said.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much. I don't know what I would have done without you both."</p>
<p>"You're family, we stick together until the end. But now I have to get back editing the latest issue of the Quibbler. It's Harry Potter's birthday today and I need to publish it before the night is up!"</p>
<p>Uncle Xenophilius left the room with a kick in his step.</p>
<p>"Why is it such a big deal publishing this issue on Harry Potter's birthday?" I asked.</p>
<p>"We are declaring our support for Harry. Since the prophet is against him. We believe him and that Fudge is off his rocker. We know He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back."</p>
<p>"Well no shit! I really want to meet this Potter kid."</p>
<p>"He's your year at Hogwarts, shouldn't be too hard. But don't get your hopes held too high. He only hangs around with 2 people and one of their families."</p>
<p>"So he's not open to having more friends?"</p>
<p>"He's too busy saving everyone. He's a Gryffindor. Sometimes I fear bravery is all he knows. I mean, I stand behind him all the way but, I don't see him trying to have a normal life."</p>
<p>"Luna, I get what you're saying, but he's Harry freakin' Potter! I bet he has a lot on his mind. Of course it would be nice for him to branch out, but he has people who follow and believe in him. I've heard of his home life, he isn't used to close friendship." Something in me told me to defend him. After all, we are both orphans now.</p>
<p>"Ohh well. Tomorrow is another day."</p>
<p>I helped Luna prepare dinner while her father was busy upstairs. She told me a lot about Hogwarts and I told her about Ilvermorny. She told me of her friend Neville Longbottom. Well, her sort-of friend anyway. He helped her with Herbology last year. He's my year. But not Luna's house. That's where I especially get nervous. Where will I fit in?</p>
<p>I wasn't a well-liked person back at Ilvermorny. Being a metamorphmargis isn't a common thing in America. I was commonly called a freak of nature. Only one person grew to accept me, and I fear she'll never forgive me for leaving her back in America.</p>
<p>I tried not to worry about anything more that night. I just turned down my sheets in my new bed, wrote in my journal, and tried falling asleep to the beautiful view of fields, the stars, and a peculiarly tall home in the distance.</p>
