    <p>
  <span>Upon first receiving the summons to Professor McGonagall’s office, Draco had been incredibly confused. In his four years at Hogwarts, he had never been summoned by a different House’s Head. Part of him wondered if it might be a joke at first, Potter finally trying to get him back for the “duel” in first year, when Draco had tipped off Filch rather than showing up. But finally he decided that it looked much too official to be a prank at the hands of Potter and the Weasel, and so he set off to the first floor corridor, wondering what the hell McGonagall could want with him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He knocked, entered, and was even further confused when he saw Granger sitting by herself near the fire, head buried in a book like it always was. She hadn’t noticed him yet, and Draco almost turned around and walked out. It was one thing to be rude to the girl when Potter and the Weasel were around, but he had never been alone with her before. He didn’t like being the cruel, sadistic prat that he knew they all thought he was. But when he had started Hogwarts, it had been what his father expected of him, and now everyone else expected it, too. So every day, Draco put on his ‘Cruel Malfoy’ mask and hid his true self inside.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As he stood in the doorframe, trying to decide what to do, a voice sounded from behind him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do enter please, Mr. Malfoy. We haven’t got all night.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco jumped, and glancing behind him, he saw McGonagall, accompanied by Cho Chang and another girl, very young, with silvery-blonde hair that reminded him of the Beauxbatons’ contestant. <em>That must be her sister, </em>he thought as he stepped inside, allowing the others to enter. <em>What in the world could McGonagall want with the four of us?</em></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He followed the women into the room. “Do close the door behind you please, Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall called over her shoulder. He did and took the seat that was farthest from the other students, while also trying not to be too obvious about it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Excuse me, Professor, but why did you call us all here?” Granger asked, ever the inquisitive mind. Draco struggled to keep the bored look on his face, but inside he wanted to know the exact same thing. None of them were even in the same house, and the little Veela girl didn’t even attend the school!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well,” McGonagall began with a sigh. “I’m afraid that question, while rather simple, has a bit of a complicated answer.” She glanced at all the students, looking rather nervous in Draco’s opinion, before continuing. “As you all know, the second task of the Triwizard Tournament takes place tomorrow, and it has been determined that you four will be necessary in the running of this event.” She raised her hand to silence Hermione, who had automatically opened her mouth to begin asking questions. Draco smirked. While he didn’t necessarily enjoy being cruel to her, it was still kind of funny to watch the endlessly questioning girl be silenced by someone else. “I’m afraid I cannot say anymore, Miss Granger. The Headmaster will be here shortly to give you further information.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As if waiting for his cue, Dumbledore swept through the door and came to a stop in front of the children. “Thank you for coming,” he greeted them. “Minerva, if you wouldn’t mind, I think I should speak to them alone.” She gave a curt nod and went through a door nestled in the corner which presumably led to her private quarters. Draco was getting more and more curious (and perplexed) as this went on. He swallowed his questions, however, as Dumbledore sighed and settled into a seat facing the students. “Well,” he began. “I’m sure the four of you are quite curious as to why I had Professor McGonagall call you here. The answer, I’m afraid, is not an easy one. The task for tomorrow is one which will greatly challenge our competitors, and in which the four of you will play a pivotal role.” Dumbledore paused, and Draco noticed with surprise that Granger managed to refrain from shooting her hand into the air. “I’m afraid that your positions, though important, will appear dangerous. I assure you, however,” he continued on quickly, “that every possible method to keep you safe will be implemented.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco couldn’t stay quiet any longer. “What are you talking about? What do the four of us have to do with anything? And what do you mean dangerous?” The headmaster held up his hand, and Draco quieted, making sure that he placed the expected scowl on his face. Inside though, he was reeling. Dangerous? The task? He had secretly been relieved when the age limit had been announced; it was the only reason his father hadn’t insisted he put his name in the Goblet. Draco was more than happy to leave the grandiose gestures up to Potter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“All reasonable questions, Mr. Malfoy,” Dumbledore said, interrupting Draco’s thoughts. “I will attempt to answer them as best I can. I do believe the simplest explanation will be best in this case. The task tomorrow will be taking place in the Great Lake. The contestants will each be given an hour to submerge, and return with something which was taken from them. Your roles are dangerous, because you four are what the contestants are supposed to retrieve.” There was silence. It seemed none of the children knew what to say. Draco was particularly bewildered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Professor, if I may,” Granger began. Upon a polite nod from Dumbledore, she continued, “It seems to me like you’re saying that each one of us is being ‘taken’ from one of the competitors, and then the task tomorrow is for our competitor to find and rescue us from the Lake. Is that correct?” Dumbledore nodded, a twinkle of pride in his eye. “That being said, I can understand Gabrielle and Cho. They are to be rescued by Fleur and Cedric, respectively. And it only makes sense that Harry would be meant to rescue me. But,” she hesitated, eyes flitting over to Draco before continuing, “I’m afraid I don’t see how Draco is precious to Krum, sir.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“For once I agree with you, Granger.” He spoke up. “With all due respect Headmaster, what am I doing here?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, I’m afraid that for once Miss Granger is wrong,” Dumbledore replied, that incessant twinkle still in his eye. “Miss Granger will be who Mr. Krum is retrieving. You, Mr. Malfoy, are intended for Mr. Potter.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco stared shell-shocked for a moment, trying to comprehend what he had just heard. “I’m…. what?” he asked, dumbfounded. The Malfoy persona had slipped away, but Draco was too shocked to care. “I don’t…. Potter…. He and I hate each other!” He said lamely. Granger was just staring at him, and he could almost hear her brain cranking, trying to make sense of it all. Dumbledore simply smiled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mr. Malfoy, the human brain rarely does what we might expect, and emotions are even less predictable. It may not make sense now, but I’m afraid that it stands. You were discovered to be considered quite precious by Potter’s emotional center, and therefore, you will be the person he is expected to retrieve.” Draco fell back into his chair, unable to believe what he was hearing. Granger was still staring, seemingly in shock, until she suddenly whispered, “Oh my god,” and proceeded to faint, falling off of her chair.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh dear,” Dumbledore commented. He walked over to the fireplace and Floo called Madame Pomfrey, who reported immediately to the classroom and was able to quickly revive the girl. Once everything was back to normal, (minus Draco’s reeling mind, of course), Dumbledore continued explaining how the task would work for the four of them. They would each be put into a deep, sleep-like state, and given a potion which would allow them to convert any water brought into their nose into oxygen before it hit their lungs. They would be kept in the village of the merpeople, who would be acting as their protectors from other things in the lake, as well as sort of refereeing the champions for everyone up in the stands. They would barely even notice the time passing by, nor the fact that they were underwater. <em>Well that’s all well and good, </em>thought Draco bitterly. <em>It still doesn’t explain why the hell I’m being used as Potter’s bait!</em></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Throughout Dumbledore’s explanation, Granger had been continually shooting glances towards Draco, with a curious and smug look on her face. <em>What the hell is she thinking? </em>Draco wondered, annoyed that she seemed to understand more than he did. Draco snapped back to attention at the sound of his name. “I’m sorry, sir, what?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore smiled patiently before saying, “I asked if you had any questions regarding your role in the task.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco paused for a second, then said, “So, to recap, you’re going to feed us a potion that will put us under for the time we’re in the lake. It will help us breathe, the merpeople are keeping an eye on us until the champions get there, and then when we break the surface we’ll wake up?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That is the extent of it, yes,” Dumbledore nodded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And what happens when Potter sees me and decides he would rather let me stay there and rot?” Draco asked petulantly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mr. Malfoy, I assure you that will not happen. But for your peace of mind, I will instruct the merfolk that should any of the competitors fail to save their target, the chief will be responsible for bringing you back to shore. Will that ease your mind?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I guess,” Draco said, still not entirely sure he wanted to do this. As if he had read Draco’s mind, Dumbledore said to the children, “I understand some of you may be concerned and trying to discern a way out of this. In regards to that, I am extremely sorry that it was not designed with your opinion in mind. I can assure you though, that you will all be completely safe and back to the normal routine of life by this time tomorrow.” With that he stood, smiled at them, and said, “Professor McGonagall should be in momentarily to prepare you for the potion.” He smiled, then swept out of the classroom. The second the door closed behind him, Draco was out of his seat and standing in front of Granger. “What do you know?” He growled at her. “What kind of prank is Potter pulling?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s not a prank, Malfoy.” Granger replied in her annoying, superior tone. “They obviously tested each champion’s emotional center. They can’t lie. Clearly, in some fashion or another, Harry cares about you.” She said this in a way that implied she knew exactly what Harry felt, which knowing her, she probably did.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tell me what you know,” Draco demanded, trying to appear threatening without scaring her away. He could tell by her replying smile though that he had failed at hiding the inner confusion swirling around his head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s not for me to tell. They’re Harry’s emotions. If he wants them shared, he has to do it,” she told him with a gentle smile. Draco gave her his best scowl and stalked to the other side of the room, needing some space to himself. As he sat there, staring at the wall and trying to make sense of what was happening to him, McGonagall entered the room again, carrying four cups on a tray.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The best way to consume the potion is in a drink, so I made tea for all of you,” she said, halfheartedly. It was quite obvious to the students that she really did not agree with the situation, but that she knew there was nothing she could do. She set the tray down, and transfigured four chairs into cots. “I must watch you all finish the tea, then you will sleep here. When it is time to move you to the lake, myself, the headmaster, and two of the tournament officials will use a levitation charm to transport you there. Are there any final questions?” The students were silent. “Very well. Please choose a cot and I will bring you your tea.” Draco stood, and grabbing the closest cot, dragged it into the corner, away from everyone else. He knew he was being childish, but he didn’t care. He was too upset. First, being told he had to deal with this stupid task. Then being told that he was Potter’s “something precious”? <em>What the hell! </em>He thought to himself for the twentieth time in the past ten minutes. McGonagall walked over and handed him a cup. He stared at it for a second, considering throwing it against the wall, but decided it would do no good. He swallowed it, and keeping his eyes on the floor, gave her back the cup.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As he laid on his cot, his back to everyone else, he decided there really was nothing he could do. He would simply have to deal with this. He could figure out what the hell Potter was up to after he was done being dunked in the lake, and maybe even be able to come up with something great to get him back. He fell asleep with a smile, imagining all the embarrassing scenarios he could inflict upon Potter as revenge.</span>
