<p>“I can’t believe we made it,” said Ginny, looking up to Pansy with a grin. “We made a jumper! Quick, try it on!”</p>
<p>
It had been a long and bumpy road, being flatmates and then friends with Ginny.  Draco had developed a close friendship with Potter at the time Pansy was desperate for a place to stay.  He’d told her Ginny was looking for someone to rent her extra room, that she’d accept Pansy as a flatmate.  It was a full-time job, refraining from jumping at each other’s neck, but somehow they felt they needed to stick it through. To build bridges to prove that all that shit with the war, well it didn’t have to happen again.</p>
<p>So there she was, four years later, nervously pulling the freshly knit jumper over her head, hoping it looked even remotely like an upper-body garment because damn it, she really wanted to make something beautiful for Molly.  The woman had welcomed her into her family’s life with a generosity Pansy could never imagine being capable of.</p>
<p>Ginny’s face lit up as she sent celebratory snowflakes out of her wand; the jumper was a success!  Pansy tried to remain cool on the outside, but her heart was pounding. This moment, it was perfect. It was all she could never possibly have imagined, but somehow all she ever wanted.  She gave Ginny a twirl and pulled her in close.  Suddenly the final piece in the puzzle of Pansy’s life fit itself into place.  <i>Pansy was in love. </i> </p></div>
