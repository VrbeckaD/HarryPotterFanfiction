    <p>Tom crossed his arms, what <em>really</em> was the difference between cord and rope anyway? The utility market was getting far too complicated. He shouldn’t need to read descriptions for <em>rope.</em> Ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Tom?”</p>
<p>He stiffened, dread filling him like water in the battery-powered outdoor fountain he passed on the way in. This store was four towns over; <em>no one</em> should know him here. Tom carefully glanced down the aisle only to curse his luck entirely at the sight of a <em>very</em> familiar face.</p>
<p><em>“Harry?” </em>Tom wanted to slap himself. He needed to play it calm, cool and collected.</p>
<p>Two acquaintances meeting at a local<em>-ish</em> store was an utterly regular occurrence. Especially when one of the acquaintances <em>frequently stalked the other</em> and was <em>currently shopping for a rope to tie up their victim with </em>because<em> they were a serial killer copying the murders from their acquaintance’s Crime Novels</em>.</p>
<p>So Normal. So Regular.</p>
<p>“I knew it was you! I almost didn’t recognise you without your lab coat! Always meeting for coffee right after you get out from work <em>does </em>have its downsides it seems.”</p>
<p>Harry made his way towards Tom, and did that sound like more flirting? It sounded like more flirting to Tom. He always froze up when Harry flirted with him.</p>
<p>“And aren’t you filled with surprises? I didn’t know you were into—" Harry paused as he took in the aisle, “Ropes? What would a fancy doctor like you need ropes for?”</p>
<p>Tom’s brain was working a mile a minute. Mostly because Harry’s pleasing and playful smile was <em>very</em> distracting, and it was hard to focus.</p>
<p>But also, because Tom didn’t know how to explain himself at this moment. Which was absurd and completely avoidable because he always had a set plan on what to say to the cashier when they would ask their forced “What project is this for?” and his reply to Harry should be no different. Consistency is key.</p>
<p>“I — I weave rope baskets.”</p>
<p>Weave. Rope. Baskets.</p>
<p>
  <em>Oh no.</em>
</p>
<p>Harry looked like he was trying his best to hold in his laugh, “That’s fascinating,” his voice was shaking. “You’ve got to show me some of your works, Tom. Basket weaving of all things! It sounds so charming.”</p>
<p>Harry maneuvered the bag he was holding so he could jauntily punch Tom’s arm, and it only befell him then how close they’d gotten. Tom silently sighed; Harry was like a magnet, and he couldn’t stay away.</p>
<p>“I’d be happy to.” He said it with a touch more sincerity than he intended, and with far too much commitment to the idea when Tom had zero baskets to show of, but Harry’s delicately flushing cheeks and much smaller and much sweeter smile pushed all of Tom’s worries far far away.</p>
<p>Not wanting to let the mood grow awkward, Tom continued, “And you, Harry? What has you shopping for ropes?”</p>
<p>Harry’s lips quirked up into a secretive smirk, “Oh, me? I’ve got a fun little project I’m starting at home. I want to hang one of those cloth chairs in my living room; I thought it would be enjoyable and relaxing— well maybe after it’s completed. Right now it’s just been a pain to figure out.”</p>
<p>“You’re hanging it all by yourself?” Tom was surprised, and it wasn’t that Harry didn’t seem capable. It was just, well, Harry was slightly on the smaller side and Tom couldn’t imagine writing novels made time for much physical activity.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about me, Tom; I’m stronger than I look,” Harry’s hand settled itself on Tom’s bicep. “I can take it.”</p>
<p>Tom sincerely believed there was no reason to have <em>that</em> much eye contact during that moment, and if he weren’t so forward-thinking, Tom would have sworn Harry’s last sentence leant towards something more salacious in nature.</p>
<p>Tom barely scraped enough energy together for a nod in reply.</p>
<p>“Alright then, I’ll leave you to your rope selecting.” Harry turned toward the shelves and carefully surveyed his options, quickly settling on one white coloured, thinner in thickness rope. Taking two rather large bundles and slipping them into an environmentally conscious reusable bag, he turned back towards Tom and gave a pleasant little wave goodbye and wandered away.</p>
<p>Tom curiously read the description of rope Harry selected and then immediately wondered if he should stop Harry from purchasing it altogether.</p>
<p>‘Strong, flexible, weatherproof, easy to tie, provides abrasion resistance, resistant to many chemicals, and absorbs shock,’ seemed a little much for a living room swing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Though it did seem perfect for Tom’s own needs, and he decided sharing rope selections with Harry was too good a chance to pass up.</p>
