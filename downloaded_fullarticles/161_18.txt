    <p>It was laundry day in the Weasley house hold and Arthur was carrying the bedspreads to be hanged to dry when he heard a familiar voice.</p><p>"Arthur!" Xenophilius <strike>Malfoy</strike> Lovegood had been a friend of Arthur's for many years and now Xeno was at the gate at the start of the property looking distressed and wearing a large coat. His daughter Luna was stood beside him but only barely, the child seemed to be standing as far away from her father as possible, she also wearing a coat but unlike her father she was carrying a beaten up travel bag.</p><p>"Why don't you come in Xeno? You know we always accept guests." Arthur yelled across the field.</p><p>"Not today Arthur, I've had a shocking revelation." Arthur felt miffed at this statement, he knew that Xeno was a little off his rocker, the man had been so since they were very young. The statement meant very little to him, it was another way to say that either the man had some sort of vision and would proceed to go on a wild goose hunt leaving his daughter with Arthur's family again.</p><p>It would be a bit extreme even for Xeno to go on another escapade less than a week after the last and Arthur had always been a curious man so he asked. "What ever is the issue Xeno? That has never stopped you from passing the gate before."Â </p><p>Xeno looked desperate, his voice started to crack, he was shaking and it seemed that he was crying. "I have come with a warning Arthur. My recent trip to China was a terrible mistake. I ask of you to please take Luna in for the foreseeable future, my brother will wish to take my darling moon so I deem you the guardian of her."</p><p>"What the Hell Xeno. What do you mean. 'for the foreseeable future' you'll be back soon right?" Arthur started to approach the gate so that he could hear the man better in case he had misheard Xeno. Xeno backtracked quickly but Luna, Tsuki, Ophelia, whatever the girl's name was anymore, moved away from both Arthur and Xeno.</p><p>"I've contracted the new strain of Dragon Pox Arthur. I might not be coming back and I want you to know that you and Molly are the only ones I'd trust my little moonbeam with anymore. I've left a written a letter to better explain it. I can't be here long Arthur I don't want to transmit it to anyone."</p><p>"Xeno!"</p><p>"I've got to go Arty." Xeno was shaking and Arthur wanted to capture him in hug so badly right then and there. To keep him there to explain. To tell him that everything would be fine. To make him stay so they could take care of him. "Tell the kids and Molly that I love'em, and I love you too. Stay strong."</p><p>Xeno disapparated from the property leaving the child and Arthur alone.</p><p>Arthur shook his head and whacked his head "This isn't come freaky nightmare right?" He asked his, apparently, new child. She shook her head and opened the gate, tears were streaming down her face.</p><p>The bell was rung from the house and Arthur knew it was his wife calling him in.</p><p>"Come on now. It's time for lunch. We can set you up in Ginny's room if you'd like. I guess. I guess she's your new sister. How about that. You've got 7 new siblings isn't that nice." Arthur tried to comfort the girl but it obviously wasn't working so he held out his hand for her bag and they began the trek back home to the Burrow.</p>
