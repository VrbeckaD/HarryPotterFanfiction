    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>5 months since the war ended:</p><p>Things were starting to fall back into place for Harry Potter. In fact, things were the most normal they had been in a long time.<br/>
All the funerals had been long out of the way, and people’s war wounds were healing. Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes was back up and running (Ron had gotten himself a job with George to keep him occupied), Hermione had taken her NEWTS and passed with flying colours even without attending a single day of 7th year, and Neville was now studying Herbology as it was a subject he wanted to go on to take further. Harry, however, was still doing nothing. Every few days, he would visit his Godson Teddy, take him gifts, and spend time with Andromeda (she had lost both her husband and her daughter to the war, so was struggling with loneliness). These were times that Harry held closely to his heart, he adored little Teddy; the six-month old boy had already started showing signs of being a metamorphmagus just like his mother and was heaps of fun for Harry to play with.</p><p>Around a month after the war ended, Harry and Ginny ended things between them. Things were just not working out. There were no hard feelings, things were just different after the war and the feelings that they had before simply were not there. Ron had been slightly annoyed with it when he was first informed of the breakup, but once he realised that both Ginny and Harry were absolutely fine and definitely not heartbroken, he relaxed significantly and was eventually fine with it. Hermione had a long talk with Harry and got him to speak about how he was feeling afterwards, so she too was fine after realising that Harry really was ok.<br/>
Although she tried her best to hide it, Molly Weasley was obviously distraught by the breakup. Her perfect family idea of Harry married to Ginny was certainly not going to happen anymore, and Molly wasn’t too pleased about that, understandably. (“Surely you two can make it work”...)<br/>
Despite all her pointless pestering, Molly was a wonderful woman who continued to treat Harry as her very own son. She was very much the mother he never had. In order to make sure the whole family were as contented as possible, he did as much as he could for the Weasleys: Harry paid for Fred’s funeral and ordered a huge firework display that everyone knew Fred would be proud of, he offered-although this offer was often turned down-to do just about every chore you could think of around the house, and even offered to buy everyone new clothes and do Molly’s grocery shopping for her.</p><p>                               ***<br/>
On a sunny Tuesday afternoon 5 months after the war, Harry was enjoying a refreshing drink with Andromeda in the beaming sun on his regular visit to see Teddy. Through becoming close with the grandmother of his godson, Harry felt that he matured a great deal and learnt that Slytherins, however much he may have previously thought so, were not all bad. She was one of the kindest, strongest and most determined women Harry had ever met, he felt that marrying her late husband when she knew it would get her disowned was admirable, and that caring for her grandson after the death of her husband and daughter was incredible.<br/>
The two were sat basking in the sunlight (with Andromeda keeping a close eye on Teddy) when Andromeda announced to Harry that she had some news.<br/>
Curious, Harry sat up and eagerly awaited whatever the news was, wanting to find out whether it was positive or negative.<br/>
“I have recently got back in contact with my sister, Narcissa.”<br/>
Slightly startled by the news, Harry encouraged her to continue with a series if nods.<br/>
“She wants to meet up and wants to fix things between us.”<br/>
“Oh! Well, that’s good isn’t it?” Harry asked, trying not to sound opposed to the idea.<br/>
Andromeda was wise, so there was no way she didn’t know Harry’s true feelings towards the situation. He was quite obviously uncomfortable when Narcissa was mentioned (her son had been Harry’s arch enemy all through school and her husband was one of Voldemort’s most trusted Death Eaters) but she chose to carry on with the conversation as if she hadn’t noticed anything in order to not make a big deal.<br/>
“I’m quite looking forward to it! I haven’t spoken to her in absolutely years, I haven’t even met my nephew!” Andromeda continued enthusiastically. Meanwhile Harry almost choked on his drink when she spoke about seeing her nephew, Draco Malfoy.<br/>
Of course, Andromeda noticed this. “Everything ok Harry dear?”<br/>
Nodding aggressively to hide his discomfort, Harry exclaimed, “Yes! Yes, everything’s fine, sorry just got something stuck in my throat, carry on!”<br/>
The middle aged woman eyed him disbelievingly, but nevertheless continued, “Well as I was saying I’m rather excited to see her again! I would have kept in contact if it weren’t for the whole being a burden to the family for going against arranged marriage thing.”<br/>
Harry was confused at that. Arranged marriage? She was supposed to have an arranged marriage?<br/>
“I’m sorry, one second,” Harry began, sounding a little confused whilst Andromeda paused to check on little Teddy (who was currently crawling around in a magically closed off area whilst sporting bright blue hair) “Did you say arranged marriages?”<br/>
She scoffed as if arranged marriages were a normal thing for her- which they perhaps were- and answered, “Yes Harry! Merlin, didn’t you know?” Harry shook his head in bewilderment, “Arranged marriages are how purebloods stay pure Harry. Do you really think Narcissa willingly married that awful man Lucious Malfoy? Salazar, no. She just put up with who her family picked and me...well not so much.”<br/>
Harry felt as though hid eyes had been opened just that bit further and he now understood the magical world just that bit more.<br/>
“Oh.” Harry sighed, staring out into the sky and looking as though he was contemplating something, “So, all pureblood families do that?”<br/>
“No, no not all. But ‘higher’ pureblood families like the Malfoys and the Blacks certainly do, or did.”<br/>
Harry squinted again in confusion, “Did?”<br/>
The grey eyed witch laughed again, clearly finding Harry’s lack of knowledge fascinating, “Yes, did. You see Harry, Draco Malfoy is the last in line for both of the families. I doubt my sister would force him into an arranged marriage after the war and all that, and so he won’t be having one.”</p><p> </p><p>A few days later, when Harry approached Andromeda’s door to visit his Godson (who had a different hair colour every time he saw him), he heard muffled voices that were definitely not Andromeda’s which was rather strange because Teddy was only seven months old so could not be talking to his grandmother. Maybe it was Molly...Harry quickly dismissed that thought as it was a Friday and Molly Weasley visits Shell Cottage every single Friday, faultlessly.<br/>
Wondering who it could be, Harry opened the door (Adromeda was used to him constantly walking in and out) and called for her and Teddy.<br/>
“Harry darling, in the kitchen!”<br/>
He heard shuffling around and what sounded like voices whispering after she called him in, so opened the door curiously.<br/>
There, at the kitchen table, sat Narcissa Malfoy with a green-haired Teddy on her lap. She looked happier and her eyes were brighter than usual, and she gave Harry a small smile whilst bouncing Teddy on her lap. Harry noticed that she wasn’t wearing the harsh-black robes he was so used to seeing her in, she was instead wearing more colourful, Slytherin green and light blue, robes which he thought made her look less intimidating.<br/>
Harry’s eyes then came across the person sitting awkwardly next to her: Draco Malfoy.</p><p>“Potter,” the blond nodded towards him, avoiding eye contact and sounding slightly uncomfortable.<br/>
Harry examined his childhood enemy, confused on how he was supposed to act towards him. Draco’s white-blond hair was longer than it had been all through school, falling at his ears and curling slightly at the ends. Harry noticed that he looked less pointy than he had through school, so had probably put on a bit of weight. Eyes flitting to his body, Harry saw that Draco was wearing a tight black turtle neck with a black blazer and trousers that hugged his figure nicely, without being too tight. If he didn’t know of Draco’s past, Harry would have admitted that he looked rather nice.<br/>
After a long pause of what seemed like hours, Harry nodded awkwardly back an abrupt, “Malfoy,” before turning back to Andromeda.<br/>
“Sorry for intruding, I can pop back later-“ he began before she interrupted, “No no Harry! Please stay, what would you like to drink?”<br/>
Taking the seat as far away from Draco as possible, Harry politely requested a tea and shuffled his feet around under the table a bit, clearly unsure on what to say. After glancing upwards for a split second, he saw that Draco was the same, sitting rather uncomfortably next to his mother (who actually seemed quite relaxed).<br/>
Andromeda however seemed completely normal, maybe even happier than usual, and carried on with her task at the kitchen counter calmly, “I was just going to start making us some lunch Harry, your timing was perfect!”<br/>
Harry smiled up at her as she continued, “Is steak and veg alright?”<br/>
Blatantly ignoring the other two people in the room-which was rather difficult since his Godson was merrily perched on Narcissa’s knee- Harry told Andromeda that steak sounded wonderful and politely asked her if she needed any help, to which she dismissed and insisted she’s be fine.<br/>
Out of no-where, Narcissa Malfoy stood up, announced, “Let me help you, I insist!” and before Harry could react, was walking over to him and handing over the now turquoise-haired, wriggling child. Teddy latched onto Harry immediately, but he still felt rather awkward. The mother of his enemy all through school had just passed a child to him as if it was nothing and they did it as often as Ron stuffed himself with food, for example.<br/>
Harry still felt apprehensive around these, well, Death Eaters so sprung up from his seat clutching Teddy to his chest. He hadn’t really thought about what he was actually trying to do before standing up; he stumbled on his words a bit before deciding, “I’m just taking Teddy outside!” and rushing out of the room.<br/>
Harry didn’t know what was wrong with him, but seeing Draco Malfoy there in front of him again brought up emotions that he just couldn’t put a label on: nervousness, unease, guilt, panic all rolled into one. He just didn’t feel comfortable being in a room with him, which he soon realised was completely selfish because Draco had been through things too. Andromeda would think he was being so rude.....<br/>
Inhaling deeply, Harry turned swiftly back around with Teddy, who was now making loud gargling noises, and threw the oak door to the kitchen back open, startling the three inside.<br/>
“Harry! I thought you were going outside,” Andromeda questioned, making different ingredients fly into pots and pans and season themselves with her sister eagerly helping at the side of her.<br/>
Harry glanced around the room and quickly as possible made up an excuse (it was too cold outside, I thought Teddy would be better off staying in) and put a large amount of effort into making it seem believable- he simply could not embarrass himself in front of Draco Malfoy.<br/>
“Well,” Andromeda stated, stopping mid sentence to place the tray of steak into the magically heated oven, “We’re finished preparing the food now so we can all sit and have a chat while we wait for it to cook.” She suddenly (and rather harshly) stared and almost glared at Harry and Draco in turn before pointing to them, “And you two will get on. If you don’t want to talk, suit yourself but sit in silence and don’t even think about causing any trouble.”<br/>
Sometimes, Harry forgot that the kind woman who was so gentle and lovely with him was a Slytherin, so he was taken aback with her straight-to-the-point harshness. He decided the best option was to obey her.</p><p>Jovially, Teddy played around on the kitchen floor (which was padded underneath him so he had no way of hurting himself) inside an impressive play pen that Andromeda had transfigured earlier so that the ‘adults’ could chat without worrying about the mischievous toddler.<br/>
Harry was zoning out and staring at a random spot on the deep blue kitchen walls when he rushed back into a more conscious state after hearing the word “Divorce”.<br/>
Curiously, he glanced towards the reunited sisters across from him, whose previously meaningless conversation had clearly turned more serious. Andromeda had her pale hand resting on top of her sister’s comfortingly and she looked at her with sympathy. Narcissa, however, did not look phased by the subject, instead she looked relieved, so Harry being the ‘nosey’ as Hermione put it person he was, listening in.<br/>
“I spoke to Draco about it first before letting Lucious know what I wanted and how I felt, because ultimately he will be very effected by it.”<br/>
Draco then cut in, “I never want to see the man again, so of course I had no objection.”<br/>
From the information he was able to gather, Harry understood that Narcissa Malfoy was divorcing her husband. Honestly, it was unexpected to Harry; he assumed that Narcissa had no problem with his disgusting ways, but she clear as daylight did and for that, Harry had respect for her.<br/>
“I’m happy for you,” Andromeda smiled, sipping from her coffee contently.<br/>
“It feels like a weight has gone,” Narcissa continued, “I’m free from the man who put Draco and I in harms way.”<br/>
Honestly, Harry felt as though he was intruding on a personal subject that he shouldn’t be listening to, but he was hooked in when Narcissa mentioned that her husband put them in harms way (clearly referring to Voldemort). So they had no choice? Lucious was to blame for the awful tasks Draco was given as a child, and he hadn’t chosen to do them himself?<br/>
Learning information that made the ‘enemy’ seem less, well...evil was strange for Harry. Ever since the war began he never stopped to think that maybe the children of death eaters did not want to be involved and were simply pulled into it. But Draco had a dark mark, a great ugly jet-black skull and snake on his forearm. Harry had seen it! Did that mean he was forced into that too?<br/>
Harry must have been pulling some strange faces whilst zoning out, because he heard the familiar drawl of Draco Malfoy, “Potter, you look like you saw a dementor. Everything ok? Wouldn’t want that now would we, you’d pass out and scream again.”<br/>
So even after the war, Harry gathered from this that they were exactly the same as before, in terms of maturity levels.<br/>
“Yeah, very funny,” he rolled his green eyed at the smirking blond sitting a few seats down from him, “Actually I saw you and now I look a bit queasy because your repulsive face makes me feel sick.”<br/>
Angered, Draco glared back at him, looking bitter and like he’d pounce on Harry at any moment. The two childhood enemies were caught in a sort of bitter staring contest like they were eleven years old again, which was really not how Andromeda had asked them to behave.<br/>
“Wow, really mature...” she drawled sarcastically, reminding Harry of her nephew for the first time ever.<br/>
Shooting one last annoyed glare in Harry’s direction Draco swivelled around on his chair to face his mother, who was looking displeased with his teasing.<br/>
“Draco what did we agree?” she warned, staring sternly at him.<br/>
Letting out a hugely exaggerated exasperated-sounding sigh, Draco turned back to Harry, “I am ever so sorry Potty.”<br/>
“Draco-“<br/>
“Sorry, sorry mother I shall try again. I am very sorry for making fun of you Potter, I sincerely hope you can forgive me,” Draco’s second attempt was much less sarcastic than the first, but Harry could tell there was still his usual sarcasm in there and he wouldn’t have it any other way. He couldn’t imagine Draco ever being nice, it would be strange, weird...<br/>
“Apology accepted, Malfoy.”</p><p>After they had eaten Andromeda’s delicious meal, Harry decided to go and play with Teddy instead so made the play pen larger, allowing him to climb in, too. In his opinion, he was very good with Teddy and was a very fun God father, not to boast or anything.<br/>
As he climbed into the now slightly larger pen, he could feel a pair of grey eyes belonging to Draco Malfoy watching his every move. What a prick.<br/>
What made him think he could invade Harry’s time he got to spend with Teddy? Narcissa couldn’t just invite herself back into Andromeda’s life after being away so long, it was completely unfair.<br/>
Pouting angrily, Harry played reluctantly with his Godson’s various magical toys (including a replica, tiny golden stitch that whizzed around the owner’s head) in order to distract himself from the snobby blond behind him and entertain Teddy.<br/>
“What are you staring at?” Harry turned to face the blond git, exasperated.<br/>
Clearly formulating yet another sarcastic comment, Draco shook his head and chuckled softly to himself, “Just didn’t think you were actually capable of caring for a child, that’s all Potter.”<br/>
“Fuck off-“<br/>
Andromeda raised her voice, frustrated that she had been forced to reprimand them for the second time, “Language Harry!”<br/>
Mumbling a quick “sorry”, Harry turned back to Teddy, whose hair was now long, silver and glistening like diamonds, replicating his grandmother’s. Laughing softly to himself, Harry ran his fingers through the shimmering hair sprouting from his Godson’s tiny head. Since he was only a baby, the hair looked like it would weigh him down if he tried to sit up, so Teddy remained lying on his back in the play pen, grinning contagiously up at Harry. Soon after, Harry heard a laugh from behind him and when he turned around, he saw that Draco was watching his cousin’s child with a joyful (compared to the usual Malfoy look) smirk on his ghostly pale face.<br/>
“His hair is cool.”<br/>
Slightly taken aback by Draco’s comment, Harry spluttered awkwardly as he attempted to respond, “Yeah, Teddy’s a metamorphmagus.”<br/>
Allowing his focused eyes to roam away from the haughty, sneering teen in front of him, he noticed that Andromeda and Narcissa were deep in conversation on the other side of the oak table, seemingly oblivious to the two boys engaging in conversation again.<br/>
“Well,” Draco drawled, raising a blond eyebrow and crossing his lean legs, “I already figured that one out for myself. Obviously.”<br/>
Nodding in response, Harry was terribly embarrassed by his foolishness. Of course the git knew Teddy was a metamorphagus, how else would he have changed his hair like that.<br/>
“Right. Yeah.”</p><p>A couple of long, awkward hours later, Harry decided that it was soon time for him to leave. Secretly, he was hoping that Draco and Narcissa would have left a long time ago so that he could peacefully have some alone time with Teddy and chat with Andromeda, but they did not seem to be budging at all and Harry was supposed to be going out with some of his school friends that night so needed desperately to get ready.<br/>
They were all squished into sofas in Andromeda’s slightly too cosy living room when Harry decided he should leave, He had Teddy (whose hair now matched the colour of Draco’s, much to Harry’s annoyance) on his knee, gargling up at him. So that he could avoid being pressed against a certain Malfoy or his mother, Harry and Teddy sat at the end of a sofa, with Adromeda to his left and Draco and Narcissa on the other end. Harry suspected that an enlargement charm had been used down at their end, because the snobby blond boy on the end of the vintage, mint green sofa looked no where near as crushed against his mother as Harry was against Andromeda. Mentally, he noted that next time it might be a good idea for him to use an enlargement charm, too.<br/>
Both boys had remained relatively silent during their time in the densely packed living room, opting to allow the adults to speak. Occasionally, Harry would babble back to his Godson as the cheerful little child chirruped nonsense up at him and randomly alter his appearance (Harry was rather displeased with him when he developed Malfoy-hair) but apart from that, he was silent and instead intently listened to the conversations of the witches next to him.<br/>
“Yes, but Draco will inherit the Manor either way. Lucious is still on house arrest inside the Manor, but it looks as though he’ll be heading for Azkaban shortly, which leaves the house to us! After the divorce is finalised, we’ll never have to let him back in there again,” Narcissa enthusiastically explained to her sister; she had clearly planned everything to do with the divorce thoroughly and thought it all through carefully before even thinking about telling anyone else apart from her son. Harry had to credit her for this, she was not a foolish woman. However Harry could not help but wonder whether Draco actually wanted to keep the manor, or whether he was agreeing to do so purely to spite his father and assist his mother. Surely after everything that he had seen and lived through at such a young age inside the Manor he couldn’t bare to live in it any longer? Harry was keen to know, but also understood that he and Draco were most definitely not close, so he couldn’t exactly walk up him and demand to know how he could live with himself and the trauma that surely existed in relation to Malfoy Manor.<br/>
Andromeda’s mouth contorted into an encouraging, friendly sort of smile that she reserved only for a very small amount of people, and she supported her sister’s ideas, “I’m sure you can make it look lovely! You always were rather creative as a child,” this comment earned a delighted, reminiscing look from Natcissa, “And Draco will help you, I’m sure.”<br/>
At the mention of his name, Draco seemed to spring alive and he instantly replied, proving that he too had been listening attentively to the conversation, “Oh yes of course I will! We need some colour, don’t you agree mother? It will make the whole atmosphere far less dull and gloomy, and well, evil looking.”<br/>
Harry’s lips curled upwards as his previous question was practically answered for him, as if Draco had read his mind and decided to inform him of his feelings towards the Manor right away. So he didn’t like living inside it, just as Harry had predicted. He couldn’t exactly blame the man; as far as he could remember, Malfoy Manor did not have a welcoming feel about it, and instead seemed like it was screaming wickedly ‘get out or you will suffer!’<br/>
Now, it really was time for Harry to leave, no matter how voracious he was to learn more top secret Malfoy gossip.<br/>
“Andromeda, it’s been lovely but I really must be going,” Harry made sure to sound as grateful as possible as he informed her of his imminent departure, giving Teddy one last squeeze before handing his squirming form back to Andromeda. As he rose from his seat, everyone shuffled along to take advantage of the new space created by Harry leaving.<br/>
“It’s been nice to see you again,” he began, facing Narcissa with a bright smile on his face, “Good luck with the divorce, and please let me know if you need anything at all.”<br/>
“Bless you, Harry Potter,” she gently grasped his outstretched hand and patted it, gratified.<br/>
Taking a large step towards the wide-open wooden door that led to the corridor, Harry waved, “Goodbye Teddy, bye Andromeda! I hope to see you soon Narcissa, and Draco.”<br/>
Satisfied with the curt little nod he received as a goodbye from the blond young man, Harry exited the room, strode down the neatly, grey carpeted corridor, out of the securely closed (before he reached it, at least) front door and stood on the doorstep, deeply inhaling the fresh air. With a crack, he was gone.</p>
