          <div class="userstuff"><p>I first noticed him at the Yule Ball, all those strapping lads from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons and I couldn't keep my eyes off the boy who slept in the bed next to mine for the past four years. His broad shoulders and narrow hips. I can't stop watching him, hoping he'd look over at me but he was focused on his date, leading her through all the dances.</p>
<p>Blaise:<b> Are you coming to the bar tonight?</b></p>
<p>Theo: <i>Yea, I think so. If my date wants to go, I guess. Ugh…</i></p>
<p>
  <i>Do I have to bring her? Tell me I don't have to.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>You don't have to. Plenty of fish in the sea.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Coming alone doesn't mean you'll leave alone. ;)</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I'm so tired of fish, Blaise.<br/>
Obviously I wouldn't leave alone. Who do ya think I am. I never leave alone</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>I know. You're the lucky one.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>What's wrong with that thing's face? His eyes a bit..winky<br/>
Wonky*</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Maybe he's got his eye on someone</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>All the birds want you Blaise. You are always just in your own world when we're out and don't seem to notice.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>The one I'm interested in never seems to notice me.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Well maybe you aren't trying hard enough. Or the in right ways.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>I've been watching them for years. Never seen any signs of interest.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>You should tell your fish you've got plans tonight.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Gods she's so annoying.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I should do that</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>How could someone not be interested in you?</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Most days I don't think they know I exist. Only ones interested are airheads.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Going to be plenty of those at the bar tonight</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Ok I told her that something came up. She's bloody whining at me. Make it stop.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I'm tired of airheads.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Come to my place? We can get ready together.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Sure. Be there in a bit.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Great! See you soon. :)</b>
</p>

  <i>I watch as Blaise gets dressed, and have to help him tie his tie. He never was great with knots. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I feel better after sending the girl home, it's so much easier just with Blaise.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>As I finish the knot straightening it into place, I look up into his face. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Oh. Well. Um... that's, unexpected.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Is it hot in here? I'm suddenly a bit warm, and lightheaded.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>--</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theo helped with my tie and all I could think about was how I wanted his hands all over the rest of my body. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b> </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>It is a bit. Feeling a bit overdressed really.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Um, maybe we should, uh, sit down.<br/>
Drink. I think I need one.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>There's firewhiskey in the kitchen. I'll summon it. Accio Firewhiskey!</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Oh, um, sorry... Tie is all good. I'll just, um... did you want one too? A drink?</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Sure. We can start the party here if you want.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Or..stay in...catch up.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I -- Blaise? Are we... I mean is this... Gods why can't I do the words?</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>It isn't like you to be so unsure of yourself Theo.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cat got your tongue?</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I just, when I was doing the knot, and I looked up... I just don't know.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I don't know. It got really warm, and you looked like you wanted to eat me. Is that weird?</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>OH!</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>No... not weird at all.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Oh, wait. I think... I might... understand. The wonky face, the other birds... the one you want not showing interest…</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Hmm. I might, kind of, be ok with that. Can I try something?</i>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Oh.. uh sure go ahead.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>It might be weird, and if it is... just stop me, ok?</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theo... just do it.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Ok, ok. Don't get your knickers in a bunch. Jeez.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Sorry. I'm just feeling a bit nervous all of a sudden.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Yeah. Me, too. Ok. Here goes.</i>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  <b>Standing by the sofa staring at Theo. My heart is racing. I am hoping desperately he wants to kiss me but he's being so strange that I can't know at all what he'll do next. </b>
</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>
  <i> I take a step closer, looking at Blaise in a different light. He looks nervous, yes. But not like he's afraid. Like he's giddy, but nervous of... after.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I close my eyes and press my lips gently to his. At first he doesn't move, like he's just waiting for me.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>--</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Arousal swelled within me. His lips were perfect. And he kissed me! After years of watching him and hoping my fantasies were finally coming true.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I, um. Well. That was… Can we try that again? </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Can we try that again?! Of course we can. As many times as you’d like. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>--</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>I pulled him flush to me and guided his lips to mine in a soft kiss that quickly turned into a heated snog. My tongue slid along his lips begging for entrance. </b>
</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>
  <i>I kiss him back fervently. Allowing him access as his tongue requests it. Velvety soft, working against mine expertly. Gods the man can kiss. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>--</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>As I pull back for breath I can see in Theo’s eyes that events might be moving too fast. I release him from my embrace and step back. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>--</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Let’s head to the bar. The other’s will wonder if we don’t show up.  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Ok. Ok, good. Blaise, can we…? </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Keep this between us for now? You read my mind Theo. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Thank you. Ok, let's go. </i>
