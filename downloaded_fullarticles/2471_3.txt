"How could I forget, you almost killed me."</p><p>Alastor chuckled. "That's a bit of an exaggeration."</p><p>Barty said, "If you had been stronger when they brought me in, you definitely would have killed me."</p><p>Alastor told him, "When we first met, I wasn't very happy with you. But, then I offered you that deal."</p><p>Barty replied, "That deal saved my life, Ally. If it wasn't for you, I would have rotted in Azkaban."</p><p>Alastor smiled. "I bet you're glad I came to your rescue."</p><p>Barty grinned. "I am, Ally. I am."</p></div>
