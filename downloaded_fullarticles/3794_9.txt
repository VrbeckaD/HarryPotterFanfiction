  <b>Winter</b>
</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">I walk after Scarlett  as she runs into platform 9 and ¾  excitedly. I wish we didn’t have to go to school. I would much rather stay in the muggle school where I can curse people without them knowing. Their reactions are so funny.</p><p>“OH MY LIN!” I hear Scarlett  shout, “LOOK AT THE STATION!”</p><p>I realize that we are already on the platform and sigh, “If you talk like that you’re going to get shot.”</p><p>I notice two girls who I think I’ve seen before, I point them out to Scarlett , “Didn’t those two go to our school?”</p><p>“Oh yeah!” Scarlett responds offhandedly, “They were in my social studies class.”</p><p>“Cool we’re going to tag along with them because everyone else here is either stupid or acts like those wannabe white girls. They seem cool. And one of them has an In the Heights jacket.”</p><p>“I think their names are like Zebra and Gazelle or something.” Scarlett says.</p><p>“Seriously? You have to stop watching nature channel.” I roll my eyes at her.</p><p>We walk over to them while Scarlett complains that she isn’t watching it too much and she is pretty sure those are their real names.</p><p>“What are your names?” I ask as soon as we get next to them, they don’t seem to hear so I taze the one next to me. She has poofy brown hair while the girl next to her has straight dark brown hair like me and glasses.</p><p>“OW! WHAT THE HECK?!” She yells.</p><p>“What are your names?” I ask again.</p><p>“Did you really have to taze me to ask that?!” She seems fine.</p><p>“Kind of.” I shrug.</p><p>“Well, because you were <em> so polite </em>, I’m Willow and that’s April.” The girl, no Willow, replies.</p><p>“Woah. So your names aren’t Zebra and Gazelle?” Scarlett asks, astonished while Willow and April look at each other weirdly.</p><p>“No me diga.” I respond sarcastically.</p><p>“TELL ME SOMETHING I DON’T KNOW!!!!” April screams.</p><p>“Are you a Heighter too?” I laugh.</p><p>“Yeah, me and my sister.” April smiles back, “You too?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” I nod, “Do you guys want to get on the train so we can get a good carriage?”</p><p>“Sure,” Willow says, “then we can find an empty one so no one will tell us to shut up if we sing too loud.”</p><p>We climb into the second train cart and sit in an empty room. I notice that there is a group of boys in the room next to us and another group on the other side of our room. I think that we won’t be that big of a bother to them.</p><p>“So,” April says. “What are your guys's names?”</p><p>“OH! We didn’t tell you?” Scarlett asks.</p><p>“No shit we didn’t.” I smack her on the head.</p><p>“Wait let me guess.” April cuts in. “Giraffe and Hyena?”</p><p>“You bitch.” I know that she is referencing to what Scarlett said earlier, “If I knew you better, you’d be dead by now. I’m Winter and that happy, enthusiastic thing is an Scarlet. We’re twins.”</p><p>“Wait! I think I know you guys!” April exclaims. “Didn’t we go to the same elementary school?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Scarlett nods.</p><p>“I had no idea that you guys were witches!” April exclaims.</p><p>“Well it would be weird if you did.” I laugh, “You know that you aren’t supposed to tell muggles right? And we can’t tell if you are a witch or not without being at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Willow, you still with us?” April nudges Willow, who has been staring off into the distance. She looks up.</p><p>“Sorry, all I can think is “lights up in Washington Heights up-”</p><p>“At the break of day I wake up-” We all join in. “AND I GOT THIS LITTLE PUNK I GOTTA CHASE AWAY!!” We all start screaming. “POP THE GRATE AT THE CRACK OF DAWN SING AS I WIPE DOWN THE AWNING, HEY Y’ALL GOOD MORNING!!!!” We are silent for a moment, none of us wanting to attempt the spanish part.</p><p>“Ice cold piragua!” We hear faintly from another room. We all start screaming and we run out into the hallway to see who it was. It's that group of guys next door. We open the door and run in. They don't even notice at first.</p><p>“I AM USNAVI AND-” They stop abruptly when they see us. We continue for them.</p><p>“YOU PROBABLY NEVER HEARD MY NAME, REPORTS OF MY FAME ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED-” They join in again, “EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THAT MY SYNTAX IS HIGHLY COMPLICATED BECAUSE I IMMIGRATED FROM THE SINGLE GREATEST LITTLE PLACE IN THE CARIBBEAN-”</p><p>“They’re like our male counterparts.” April jokes.</p><p>“That's what I said!” Willow rolls her eyes.</p><p>“You never said that.” Scarlett says.</p><p>“Yeah, you <em> never </em>said that.” April smirks for some unknown reason, then winces. “Okay, okay, please shut up.” She says seemingly to herself. Scarlett and I share a glance. We continue singing. Finally the song ends.</p><p>“Hey.” A boy with poofy hair and freckles says. “I’m John.”</p><p>“Willow.” I roll my eyes when I notice she is staring at John. She sees me looking and blushes.</p><p>“I’m Alexander.” Another kid says.</p><p>“Hey did you know that you look exactly like Lin Manuel Miranda?” I ask him.</p><p>“I get that a lot.” He rolls his eyes.</p><p>“I’m Winter!” I scream in their ears.</p><p>“Herc.” I look around to see who said that and see a short boy wearing a beanie that says Washington Heights on it.</p><p>“April.” She smiles.</p><p>“Excuse our friend, he doesn’t speak English.” Alexander gestures to another boy.</p><p>“Oh shut up.” He says with a strong French accent. “I’m Glibert.”</p><p>“<em> Glibert </em>?” April asks. ‘Glibert’ blushes.</p><p>“<em> GILBERT.” </em>Alexander says loudly and slowly. “Your name is Gilbert.” Gilbert rolls his eyes, still blushing.</p><p>“I honestly thought your name was Glibert.” I cackle.</p><p>“Tais-toi!” Gilbert seems angry.</p><p>“Whah?” I can’t understand what the heck he is saying but my third grade teacher used to speak in French to us sometimes so I think he’s telling me to be quieter or something.</p><p>“Shut up.” April tells me.</p><p>“Excuse me?” I turn towards her, ready to take any of the 7 knives hidden on me out to stab her.</p><p>“He said to shut up.”</p><p>“I WILL FIGHT YOU ‘GLIBERT’! BESIDES, WHAT KIND OF STUPID NAME IS GILBERT?!” I screech.</p><p>“Winter!” April kicks me. “Stop it.” She hisses. I kick her back harder.</p><p>“OW! What the heck?” She glares at me. I smile back innocently.</p><p>“Sorry about Winter.” April tells him. “We haven’t trained her not to kill yet.”</p><p>“Excuse you!” I yell, “At least I can kill you. If there weren’t too many witnesses.” She inches away from me and crashes into Gilbert. I laugh.</p><p>“How cute!” I make kissy faces at them. They glare at me.</p><p>“And I’m Scarlet.” Scarlett says, pretending nothing ever happened.</p><p>“So, you guys are Heighters?” Alexander asks.</p><p>“100%” Scarlett confirms.</p><p>“Or…” I start giggling, “ 96,000%” In a moment of psychokinesis, everyone shouts at once.</p><p>“96,000!!!” We yell. We hear screaming just like the one Willow, Scarlett, April, and I made. The door flies open. Two girls are standing in the doorway, beaming.</p><p>“We can figure out exactly who likes “In The Heights” by singing it and seeing who comes running into our cart.” Herc sighs. “So, what are your names?”</p><p>“Angelica!” A girl with wavy black hair says. “This is my sister, E-”</p><p>“Eliza!” Eliza, a pretty girl with brown hair announces. She suddenly blushes. I look and see Alex. Of course she’s already developing a crush like Willow and April. I roll my eyes.</p><p>“I think that you have a slight problem with your eyes.” Gilbert tells me. “They are rolling around constantly.” Everyone laughs, and I roll my eyes without thinking about it, making everyone laugh harder.</p><p>“<em> Glibert </em> and April, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G! Que bochinche, Glibert and April, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!” I sing under my breath. April hears me and blushes.</p><p>“So, what’s your name?” Eliza asks, looking at Alex.</p><p>“I’m Herc.” Herc says. Eliza looks at him in surprise, not realizing that someone else would answer.</p><p>“Oh, okay.” She turns back towards Alex. Angelica looks at him too.</p><p>“Alexander Hamilton.” He grins. “My name is Alexander Hamilton.” I’m not sure whether to tease Alexander and Eliza or Alexander and Angelica.</p><p>“Yes we get it, your name is Alexander Hamilton. You don’t have to say it twice.” I roll my eyes at him.</p><p>“Hey!” Eliza shouts, “He just wanted to clarify that his name is Alexander! Is there anything wrong with that?!” I raise an eyebrow at her and she realizes that she was yelling. I roll my eyes.</p><p>“You are doing it again.” Gilbert tells me. “You really should see a doctor.” I take out my knife and suddenly it's dead quiet.</p><p>“You’re fucking accent is super annoying and I really wish that you actually didn’t speak English.” I smile sweetly. “Also, your jokes aren’t funny and you-” Scarlett grabs my arm.</p><p>“Winter, please pleasepleaseplease stop.” She whispers. I tilt my head at her. “You can kill them later.” I sigh and put my knife away. The tension in the room deflates.</p><p>“So, what are your names?” Eliza asks the group. We all introduce ourselves again. “Okay, there’s no way I’m going to remember everyone’s name.” She laughs. “I’ll do my best.” Alexander sits back down. Eliza and Angelica both try to sit next to him, but Angelica lets Eliza sit first. John sits down across from Alexander, and of course Willow sits next to him. April sits down next to her twin. I push Gilbert there as well, then I sit on the edge. I almost laugh at Gilbert’s face when he sees me next to him.</p><p>“Scoot!” I order, and push them towards the window. Soon, the four of them are smushed together and I have half of the seat. Nobody dares challenge me though, and I think that they probably enjoy it.</p><p>“So.” John is smiling. “Who’s you favorite character from In The Heights?”</p><p>“The Piragua man,” I immediately exclaim, “because he’s like that creepy stalker that no one notices but knows everybody’s life story. Also because he broke the ice cream truck.”</p><p>“I always thought that he represented the neighborhood.  He is the one who talks to Nina and he talks about stuff that is happening and encourages them and-” Alexander starts ranting.</p><p>“You got him started.” John sighs. “Get ready to listen to this for the rest of the ride.”</p><p>“-Also, he even says that he-” We all sigh.</p><p>“Is he always this boring?” I ask.</p><p>“Excuse me!” Alexander pauses mid-rant.</p><p>“You’re excused.” I reply, I catch a glimpse of the other side of the door and see the candy cart.</p><p>“I am not boring. I have many thoughts to say and I’m trying to explain my thoughts. I’m not boring because-”</p><p>“HEY LOOK! THERE’S THE CANDY CART!” I shout to change the subject. I feel something, no some<em> one </em> rush past me.</p><p>“There goes my twin.” April sighs.</p><p>“Woah, that was Willow?!” Scarlett asks, wide-eyed.</p><p>“Caramels.” April shrugs as if that explained everything.</p><p>“Your twin really likes caramels then.” Alexander says, still gaping at the door.</p><p>“No, not just caramels. Any candy in general. And sushi.” April explains.</p><p>“Great! Now I know how to kidnap her!” I laugh.</p><p>“And dogs.” April adds hopefully. “Please take her!”</p><p>“OOOOOHHHH! I <em> LOVE </em> dogs.” I start saying before the second thing April says gets through my brain, “You <em> want </em> me to kidnap and kill your twin?!”</p><p>“KILL?!?” April exclaims. “NO!” She looks appalled. “That wouldn't be good for either of us.”</p><p>“What?” I am confused by the fact that she said both of them. Then again, some people have strong emotional attachment.</p><p>“I’d be insane without her.” April tells me.</p><p>“What?” I ask again, “Are you two like connected like siamese twins or something? Maybe your heads are connected. Wait no, you can’t be.” April face palms.</p><p>“Nevermind. I’ll tell you later.” She suddenly spots something over my shoulder. “HEY!” I turn and see Willow stumbling back with her arms full of candy. “Willow! We might need that money for other stuff!” April shouts.</p><p>“What could you need other than candy?” Willow grins. “Help?”</p><p>“If you give me some of it.” April smiles.</p><p>“What no!” Willow exclaims. “I don’t have that much.” April scoffs.</p><p>“Okay, then I’m going to buy some candy.”</p><p>“Which ones?” Willow asks.</p><p>“Some caramels probably.” Willow smirks.</p><p>“None left.” She smiles. “I bought all of it.” April screams.</p><p>“NOT AGAIN!!!!!!” She tries to get over Gilbert and I to reach Willow. She is about to climb over me but I give her a look and she goes back to her seat.</p><p>“Butterbeer!” I remember something my parents said about Hogwarts, “You should save that money for the Hogsmeade trip so that you can buy butterbeer.”</p><p>“What’s that?” Scarlett looks at me.</p><p>“Wait, you guys are twins right?” Willow suddenly turns back towards us.</p><p>“Yes and?” I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>“Then how come you guys look nothing alike? And why do you know what Hogsmeade is but she doesn’t?” She wrinkles her nose.</p><p>“Oh…” Scarlett and I respond at the same time.</p><p>“I was adopted into their family when I was 6.” I explain, “I am a Pureblood so I know all that shit about Hogwarts. I learned how to swear in the Muggle world.”</p><p>“Why were you adopted?” April asks and I freeze.</p><p>“I can’t answer that question here.” I answer mysteriously.</p><p>“Ok then…” Willow looks slightly scared.</p><p>“We should probably go back to our cart. It was nice meeting you all.” Scarlett announces. April groans quietly.</p><p>“Bye guys.” She waves.</p><p>“See you at Hogwarts.” Willow adds.</p><p>We head back into our cart and I let out a sigh. I have some questions I want to ask Willow and April since they asked so many things about me. I close the door and turn around.</p><p>“Okay, so are you guys normal twins?” I narrow my eyes at them. Willow freezes when she is about to sit down and April flinches. They are silent for a second, staring at each other. I’m guessing that it is a no. I look at Scarlett, who shrugs. I suddenly remember something our other twin was talking about while preparing for a test.</p><p>“Are you guys lemur twins or something?”</p><p>“WHATNO!” April shouts right away. “WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?” Willow kicks her.</p><p>“Ugh. I mean the word… OH! I remember now! Legilimens?” I explain, “It’s like some sort of mind thing? You guys would be psychic.”</p><p>“NOOOOOO.” April says loudly. “WHAT?”</p><p>“I’m going to take that as a yes then.” I mutter.</p><p>“Sorry.” April apologizes to Willow, who faceplants.</p><p>“We agreed NOT to tell them.” Willow frowns.</p><p>“That's so cool!” Scarlett exclaims.</p><p>“So you won’t tell anyone?” April asks.</p><p>“Of course not!” Scarlett reassures her. April sticks her tongue out at Willow.</p><p>“Nope. Besides, how would that even benefit us?” I tease.</p><p>“See? No harm done.” April tells Willow.</p><p>“Besides, now we are obligated to tell you one thing about why we’re twins. You can ask us any question now.” I say so that it’s even and they can’t hold this against me later. They look at each other, apparently deciding.</p><p>“Why did you need to be adopted?”</p><p>“My parents were murdered by some creepy weird organization.” I shug, looking at the floor. Willow and April look sympathetic. I roll my eyes and lean back. I realize I can hear the boys through the walls. I don’t tell the others, I just listen.</p><p>“Hey!” I hear either Eliza or Angelica exclaim. “Willow dropped a piece of candy!”</p><p>“Can I have it?” I think John asks.</p><p>“I found it first. Why should (we get you these drugs) I give you the candy?” I think it’s Eliza asks.</p><p>“Please don’t tell but,” John pauses. “I kind of-”</p><p>The rest is unclear due to shouting coming from the room on our other side.</p><p>“What was that?” It’s definitely Gilbert because the accent.</p><p>“Some sort of fight or something… Let’s go see!” Alexander exclaims.</p><p>“No. We shouldn’t get involved.” That’s definitely Eliza.</p><p>“Fineee” Alexander whines.</p><p>“What?” Gilbert exclaims.</p><p>“Mannn.” John follows.</p><p>“What was that?” April asks.</p><p>“Some sort of fight or something.” Willow answers. I start laughing, and everyone gives me weird looks.</p><p>“Well they’re disturbing our conversation.” I march out the door.</p><p>“No!” Scarlett calls after me. “We shouldn’t get involved!” I ignore her.</p><p>There are 8 boys in the room on our left and they are all screaming incoherently about something. They are from the same school as we did because they are wearing our P.E uniforms. I recognize a few.</p><p>“Excuse me?” I say, sticking my head into the room.</p><p>“Yes?” A boy with very poofy black hair drawls.</p><p>“Gilbert?” I squint at him. His hair is really poofy when it's not in a ponytail. I see who is sitting next to him. “<em> Herc </em>? What are you guys doing here?” They stare at me, confused.</p><p>“Who?” Gilbert asks.</p><p>“Uhhhh… You?”</p><p>“I’m Thomas.” He gives me a weird look. “This is James.” No accent. I stare at them in confusion.</p><p>“Uh. Hold on.” I run over to the other cart and look inside. Gilbert and Herc are there, and Gilibert has a ponytail still.</p><p>“Too many twins.” I mutter and run back to the other cart. The door is closed, and I slam it open.</p><p>“I don’t know if you’ve noticed but you guys are really loud. Can you, like, BE QUIET FOR THE REST OF THE RIDE?!” I scream at them.</p><p>“Nah.” Not-Gilbert-Actually-Thomas smirks. “Doesn’t sound fun.”</p><p>“Would you like to rephrase that?” I ask sweetly taking out one of my knives.</p><p>“Nah.” He says again. The knife hits right through his hair and he screams. He now has a groove in his hair.</p><p>“Would you like to rephrase that?” I ask more forcefully while smiling and tilting my head.</p><p>“Sure. Okay. Uh-huh. Yes.” He answers.</p><p>“So how would you like to say it this time.” I glare at him.</p><p>“Sure. Okay. Uh-huh. Yes.” He says again.</p><p>“Okay then!” I say cheerfully, “I expect no sound from here unless you all want to meet the same fate as your hair. Have a nice rest of the ride!” Thomas glances at me and sprints out of the compartment, dragging James behind him. James slams the door behind them. I open it and watch them run down to the next carriage</p><p>When I get back to our cart, John, Herc, and Gilbert are there too.</p><p>“We heard the shouting and were wondering if it was you guys.” John explains.</p><p>“Oh <em> we’re </em> fine.” I grin, “Maybe you should check on your doppelgangers!”</p><p>“What?!” They all exclaim.</p><p>“There was some shouting from the other cart.” I explain.</p><p>“Yeah, we heard.” Gilbert says.</p><p>“Well, I went to check on them and two of them look exactly like Gilbert and Herc. Also I threw a knife at the Gilbert look alike because he was being annoying.” I laugh remembering the scared face they had made.</p><p>“Want a piece of candy?” Willow asks.</p><p>“Ooooh, candy?” Scarlett looks excited.</p><p>“I want one!” John holds out his hand. She drops a few bags of jelly beans and a chocolate frog into his hand. “Thanks.” Scarlett holds out her hand too. Willow stares at her for a second, then drops one bag of jellybeans in her hand.</p><p>“What?” Scarlett stares at her.</p><p>“Willow stop pretending that John is your friend we all know that he <em> LUVS </em> you.” I tease her and she throws a bag of jelly beans at my head, rolling her eyes. “Oh thanks for the jelly beans!” John is blushing. I resist laughing because I can easily see who likes who but no one else sees it. I decide to keep quiet about it so that I’m the only person to know, and I can use it to my advantage. Actually, maybe I’ll just tell Scarlet.</p>
