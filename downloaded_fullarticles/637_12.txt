    <p>Hope calls Alaric to pack away all her stuff and burn her records. It was hard, one of the hardest conversations she had ever had. But she knew this next one would test her resolve.</p>
<p>Squeezing her eyes shut, willing her voice to be steady, she pressed the call button. It picked up on the second ring, Hope choking out a breath she wasn’t sure was in relief or regret.</p>
<p>“What mystical lost creature are you hunting now? Or did you just miss hearing your big brother’s voice?” the lightly accented voice teased through the phone. Hope had to throw her hand over her mouth to stop the choked sob that threatened to give her away. It wasn’t quick enough to escape Harry's vampire hearing. “Hope?”</p>
<p>Worry tinged his voice and Hope remembered the last time she had heard her brother like this and she hated herself that she was going to hurt him even more.</p>
<p>She bit her lip, trying to put on a strong front as she willed her voice to steady.</p>
<p>“I love you.” She pursed her lips together immediately after to stop any other sound from escaping.</p>
<p>Why did that sound like a goodbye!? Why was Hope saying goodbye!?</p>
<p>“Hope! Tell me what’s happening! Where are you?” he demanded, voice raised as he realized the gravity of the situation, playful teasing long gone.</p>
<p>Hope found her voice the second time, “I love you but I’m not sorry. This is the only way to stop the monster and protect you. I finally know why we were born and you’ve already given up so much. You deserve to be remembered and loved.” She looked down into the boiling pit of Malivore, eyebrows coming together as her face reflected her inner turmoil.</p>
<p>She heard the sounds of objects crashing on the other end of the line but she kept her focus on the steaming pit in front of her.</p>
<p>“Dammit, Hope! Think about this!”</p>
<p>“I have and it’s the only way.”</p>
<p>“Tell me where you are and we’ll fight Malivore together! If you jump in there – you don’t even know if it’ll work!”</p>
<p>Of course, he had figured it out. He was the one to teach her growing up.</p>
<p>“I can’t. Because if it’s not me, it’s you, and I can’t let that happen. My entire life, you’ve always been the one to save me. Just this once, let me save you.”</p>
<p>Her time was running out. If she didn’t do it soon, there would be nothing to jump into.</p>
<p>“Isn’t family so complicated? This grand heroic gesture of love; sacrificing yourself for your love and your brother. Can you imagine the agony he’ll be in when he realizes you’ve been erased from his memories? First his parents, then your father, and now you…he won’t survive.”</p>
<p>She doesn’t want to believe Clark, trying desperately to remind herself that he is trying to stop her from jumping. He would say anything to stall for time…but she knew he had hit the nail on the head. Harry’s voice ringing through her mind, <em>“Don’t leave me alone.”</em></p>
<p>Clark opens his mouth, glee reflecting in his eyes as a cruel smile makes its way across his face, ready to taunt her again, “I hate my father – I’m terrified of him – so if you’re right about this loophole – can actually kill the bastard once and for all – I’ll be rooting for you. And if you’re wrong…well, you’ll be dead.”</p>
<p>They had followed each other around the platform like predators until they stopped, coincidently enough, right over the pit.</p>
<p>“<em>Imitantor Pupulus</em>,” Hope casts the spell, expression like stone, determination set. She would do this and she would take the one responsible for all of this with her.</p>
<p>Clark scoffs when nothing happened. Hope sends him her own cruel smile as she slaps her hand over her mouth as he goes to speak, Clark mimicking her. His eyes widened in surprise before narrowing in anger, hate shining through clearly.</p>
<p>Hope slowly lowers her hand from her mouth, Clarke forced to do the same.</p>
<p>“How’d you do that? Why did I do that?!”</p>
<p>Beneath them, the mud pit boiled and burst, steam rising as Malivore prepared to gain physical form. Hope knew she had to act soon.</p>
<p>“It’s a basic mimic spell, my brother taught it to me when I was in second grade,” raising an eyebrow up challenging, almost mockingly, Hope stepped up onto the railing, “See, there’s one thing I learned from my family: know your enemy. You, you’re a threat to Landon, to everyone I care about. So yeah, I’ll enjoy this.”</p>
<p>Clarke mimicked her movement, his face contorting in anger and fear as his eyes flickered to the pit that was his father. “You don’t have to do this.”</p>
<p>There was barely an expression on her face, pushing down all her emotions to do this one thing, briefly wondering if this was what her father felt when he sacrificed himself for her.</p>
<p>“I do,” she spoke, voice raw and empty as she took another step, hand shooting out to grip Clarke’s neck, his doing the same, “But at least I’ll enjoy this.”</p>
<p>She pushed off with her left foot, tipping them over the edge, nothing but darkness and fear staring up at her as they descended into the pit, her last thoughts before she hit the muddy pit being fear and not wanting to be forgotten.</p>
<p>And then there was nothing.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry is desperate when the phone call suddenly ends but not before he heard another voice on the other end. He hurries to do a tracking spell so he could apparate to Hope before she erased herself out of existence. It was easy to connect the dots when she started her farewell. She’d only been texting him the last few weeks about Malivore and how monsters that had been erased from the collective conscious were attacking the school. He knew what she was planning because it was exactly what he would do.</p>
<p>In his desperation, knowing he didn’t have long if she was to be erased from his memories, he scrawled across the parchment with the locator spell, Find Hope!</p>
<p>He just needed the coordinates, he just needed to know where to go and he could be there! He just needed more time!</p>
<p>There!</p>
<p>She’s somewhere near the edge of Fort Valley, Georgia!</p>
<p>Harry closed his green eyes, focusing on Hope and their connection, using it as a guiding point to apparate.</p>
<p>A second passed and then another. The moment of a single heartbeat before another. The time it took to inhale and then exhale.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes, confused as to why they were closed in the first place. His mind drawing a blank on why he was about to apparate. Furrowed eyes glance about the mess of a room, wondering why it looked like a gaggle of pixies had been let loose in here.</p>
<p>His hands feather through the loose pieces of papers, trying to piece together what he might’ve been doing before his memory suddenly blanked.</p>
<p>Harry pulled the topmost paper closer for inspection, noting it was a tracking spell. He rotated the paper when he noticed something scribbled hastily. It was definitely his handwriting but he had no recollection of writing it or for that matter, what it meant.</p>
<p>
  <em>FIND HOPE!</em>
</p>
<p>What did that mean?</p>
<p>Why did he need hope? Or was hope a person? Why did it feel like he was missing something?</p>
<p>The only way to find answers was to apparate to Fort Valley, Georgia.</p>
<p>He appears outside a heavily guarded facility. It isn't that hard to get inside, most of the guards are dead or unconscious, another thing that increases his paranoia. He doesn't know what he is looking for but he can feel the magic in the air, the ozone is thick so he follows it.</p>
<p>There is no human sound in the facility beyond a beeping of alarms. He continues to follow the pull of magic, noting that there was no physical damage to the facility. The people knocked unconscious seemed to have been taken out quickly, likely snuck up on.</p>
<p>His unease continues to rise. Either the person who did this knew the facility or was powerful.</p>
<p>He comes to a secured room that looks like it could hide something incredibly secretive. So naturally, he blasts it open and strides in. He had learned from his father that sometimes dramatic entrances were the best distractions.</p>
<p>Speeding into the secured room, Harry narrows his eyes before they widen at the state of the vault-like room, hands coming to rest on the railing that led to the floor.</p>
<p>He is amazed at the destruction in the room, a crater size hole missing from the floor. That must have been the cause of the ozone that permeated the area.</p>
<p>Groaning draws his attention and he finds a boy, a familiar boy that he can't place.</p>
<p>He jumps down to the boy, frightening him as he scrambles back until his back hits the wall.</p>
<p>"I'm not here to hurt you." This does little to calm the kid but Harry wasn’t here to be nice. "What happened here?"</p>
<p>The kid was jumpy – Harry was reminded a little of Neville – his eyes wide as he took in his surroundings.</p>
<p>"Hell if I know! Malivore’s just gone."</p>
<p>Malivore. Now that sounded familiar but once again he didn't know why.</p>
<p>"Malivore – apparently my father! – he devours monsters and the whole world forgets about them."</p>
<p>The world freezes, his lungs deflating at the sudden thought, the cold terror at what that could mean.</p>
<p>The map, the note…it all made sense! Desperately grabbing at his phone, he clicks open the call history, thumb shaking uncontrollably, and right there, only minutes old was a call from Hope. Hope was a person, someone important enough that they called him as their last goodbye.</p>
<p>"Can you call someone to pick you up?" Harry doesn't wait for an answer, jumping into the crater to see what he could find, see if there was any evidence of this Hope.</p>
<p>"Yea…Wait! What're you doing!?" the kid yells down to him.</p>
<p>"Looking for answers." Harry moved his hands along the earth walls, feeling the fleeting magic of something powerful. It was powerful magic, the most powerful he had felt in years. It was potent earth magic but there wasn’t enough to get a proper grasp on the exact properties. The magic was dissipating too fast.</p>
<p>Landon looks at the strange man that had suddenly appeared, wondering if he was friend or foe before hurrying to call Dr. Saltzman.</p>
<p>Harry froze when he heard that name. This was one of the Salvatore School kids?</p>
<p>He jumps back to the kid, demanding the phone, hand held out as his eyes dared the kid to refuse him.</p>
<p>It was a tense moment before Landon hesitantly hands the phone over, not wanting the man to kill him…well, that was kinda dumb seeing as he couldn't be killed, but still!</p>
<p>"Alaric," it is curt and harsh, not at all how Harry is usually mannered but this is an extenuating circumstance. He could be forgiven his lack of manners.</p>
<p>"Harry?" came Alaric’s confused and surprised response at hearing the voice of the boy, well man, that he had been acquainted with over the years, wondering why and how he was with Landon.</p>
<p>"What do you know of Malivore? I need all your information." He turns his gaze back to where Malivore use to reside.</p>
<p>Alaric explained that there's not much, if any information, other than it erases the collective memory of all those who are devoured and that it had been sending monsters to collect objects for the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Somehow, Harry knew he already knew this information which couldn't be true as this was the first time he was hearing about Malivore.</p>
<p>But not if Hope was involved and told him about this. Putting him on speaker, Harry pulled his phone out, going to his messages and seeing the name Hope once again. He pulled up the messages and saw how personal they were, how casual he had been with her. It was when he scrolled a little further that the devastation really hit: Hope was his sister. He had a sister that he couldn't remember!</p>
<p>Chest rising and falling as he tried to regain control of his emotions, Harry knew he couldn’t lose control here – not if he wanted answers.</p>
<p>"Is there a spell to retrieve memories lost to Malivore?" he demanded, still scrolling through the messages until he came across a picture and everything clicked into place. It was Hope with the boy in front of him, Landon. He was giving a hesitant smile that looked more like a grimace as Hope dazzled with a happy smile. Under it was a message asking Harry to come meet her new boyfriend.</p>
<p>"No, we haven't found anything."</p>
<p>That wasn't acceptable.</p>
<p>"I'm coming with the kid."</p>
<p>Landon was hauled to his feet with a firm grip on his bicep and Harry didn't give him a warning before apparating to Mystic Falls.</p>
<p>He would get his memory back and he would find a way to get his sister back. He would bend the laws of nature if he had to.</p>
<p>Always and Forever</p>
<hr/>
<p>When they land in the Headmaster’s office, Alaric hurries over to Landon, checking him over for injuries, recent events shoved to the background in the face of this new concern.</p>
<p>Landon backs away, hands up in front of him. The last few months had been crazy but this was beyond that, "Just…What is going on!? Who is this guy? How did he know where Malivore was? And how did we get here!!!?"</p>
<p>Harry threw the boy an unconcerned look, going to the student records he knew were in Alaric’s office.</p>
<p>"Hey! Mind telling me what's going on?! You haven't been to the school for years and now all of a sudden you just appear, with one of my students!?" Alaric demands. He didn't hate the boy but he also didn't have a decent relationship with most of his family so he had avoided him over the years. Only, Caroline was his friend so his presence wasn't unusual when she was here. "And why’re you digging through school records?!"</p>
<p>Harry ignored him, flicking through all the M names. The file wasn't there. He tried summoning the file but nothing came!</p>
<p>That damn girl! She was covering her tracks to make it easier for everyone to move on. If there was no evidence of her, no one would be hurt by her absence. It was something he would do.</p>
<p>Throwing his hands onto the desk in front of him, Harry looked at the man who had conspired with his forgotten sister.</p>
<p>Alaric felt a shiver of fear travel down his spine, Harry reminding him of his father, of Klaus Mikaelson when he had terrorized the town all those years ago.</p>
<p>"My name is Harry Mikaelson and I want to know why my sister threw herself into Malivore and why you," he directed the last part to Alaric, "Helped erase her from the school records."</p>
<p>The name hit something in Landon's memory but he couldn't remember from where. "Mikaelson, isn't that some vampire's name?"</p>
<p>"Klaus Mikaelson was part of the Original Family of vampires. He was my father and he was a hybrid, making me and my sister tribrids. We are the only ones of our kind in the world. I love and would do anything for my family so I want to know why I can't remember my own sister!"</p>
<p>Objects began to vibrate and Alaric grits his teeth, having forgotten just how powerful the kid was. Well, he may still look like a kid but he wasn't, not anymore. He was a tribrid and the firstborn of Klaus. He held unimaginable power and just because he didn’t use it very much, didn’t make him any less dangerous.</p>
<p>"If it's true that your sister went into Malivore and now it's gone, maybe that was the only way to destroy it,” Alaric tries to placate the angry/grieving tribrid.</p>
<p>Landon speaks up with the information he knew on Malivore, not sure how he knew it, "Malivore was created by three species: witches, vampires, and werewolves. Maybe the only way to destroy it was for," he glances hesitantly to Harry, "a tribrid to enter."</p>
<p>Magic always has to have a balance, something he had learned in the decades surrounded by it. If a triad of species created this beast, magic would require that only the triad could destroy it. If Hope had come to the same conclusion, she threw herself in there on nothing more than a hunch. But it had worked which meant she was gone.</p>
<p>But if she was gone and he had no memories – no, no no no – she was his responsibility, his to protect! He knew instinctively that Klaus had died for them both, had entrusted him with the safety of the youngest Mikaelson. He couldn’t bear it if this was true. He had lost so much already, he couldn’t lose this as well.</p>
<p>Tears fell on the desk as Harry struggled to contain his emotions. His hand coming up to press into his eyes, trying to force away the tears.</p>
<p>Alaric warily looked to Harry, mouthing to Landon to leave. He considered himself an expert on Mikaelson’s and whenever one began to lose control of their emotions, people tended to die.</p>
<p>“Harry?” Alaric moved cautiously forward, eyes darting to his crossbow in the corner…just in case. Surprise crossed his face when he saw red dripping from the hand pressing into his eyes.</p>
<p>Harry refused to look up, trying to will the pain away as his other hand dug into the hard wood of the desk.</p>
<p>“Always and Forever isn’t just something we say. The bond I had with my father…I wanted to <em>die</em> when I lost him. It was like I lost a part of myself, the wolf searching desperately for its pack leader. I felt like I was losing my mind as it split in the emptiness.” Harry looked up and Alaric recoiled at the sight of blood dripping from where his claws had cut into the skin around his eyes. Blood mixing with tears as his eyes changed from the calming green to the yellow of werewolf. “Do you know what it’s like to feel the loss of someone you can’t remember!? It feels like I’m being pulled in two! She’s gone and I feel it but there’s nothing! Nothing! I should have years of memories and there’s nothing there!” he cried out.</p>
<p>Alaric took another step closer, trying to swallow in his suddenly dry throat. He needed to calm Harry down or else he could hurt someone and while he wasn’t sure of his position as head of the school anymore, these kids were still his responsibility.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine what it is you’re feeling but I know something about loss. And right now, there’s a school full of students beyond this door so you <em>can’t</em> lose control.” Nails dig deeper into his desk and Alaric winces, thoughts racing as he tried to calm the distraught kid. Because that’s what Harry was right now, a kid who needed help, the reason why this school had been created. “I’ll help you however I can but you can’t lose control here. You have to stay strong. We have a whole school of books and artifacts, one of them has to hold answers.”</p>
<p>Desperate eyes rose and froze him in place. There was desperation there, desperation Alaric knew meant he would do anything.</p>
<p>And then Harry disappeared with a crack, leaving nothing but blood and cracked wood in his wake.</p>
<p>His shoulders sagged and his chest heaved with the oxygen he hadn’t realized he wasn’t breathing.</p>
<p>He pulled out his own phone, scrolling through for any information on Hope Mikaelson. Why would he help erase her from the school, leaving no record of her existence here?</p>
<p>There had to be something.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry apparates to his home, digging through his trunk, throwing the contents to the floor, until he found the ring he had sworn never to touch again when it had reappeared to him years ago. He could already feel the temptation to use it, the insanity of wanting to know creeping in.</p>
<p>
  <em>Hope Mikaelson Hope Mikaelson Hope Mikaelson</em>
</p>
<p>He turned it in his hand, concentrating on the name like a mantra. If she was really dead, she would appear to him. She would appear and he would beg her for forgiveness.</p>
<p>He stopped the mantra but couldn't bring himself to open his blood-soaked eyes. Couldn't bear to see his failure laid before him.</p>
<p>Swallowing his saliva turn molasses, Harry opened his trembling eyes, breath escaping his lungs as he collapsed to his knees, cries escaping him as his hand clenched at his heart.</p>
<p>There was no one there – Hope wasn't dead.</p>
<p>There was still hope, always hope.</p>
