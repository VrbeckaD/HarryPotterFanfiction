  <span>Firstly how does this soulmate AU work? Here you have it!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As written in the description, a letter appears on the person’s left arm when they turn 16. For each month a new letter shows up and in the end, it says a name. Their soulmates name.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>HOWEVER, there is an exception… If one of them need their soulmate before they turn 16, the first letter will show up on the first day of the soulmate need. You can’t just need your soulmate to feel love because you are selfish, but you can need your soulmate for comfort or for love if you get hate. There is a difference. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now for the signs!</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Writing colour:</b>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Grey: Have not met their soulmate</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Black: Have met their soulmate</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When the writing turns black, an infinity symbol appears under the name connecting to it. This symbol is very important because it changes colour depending on what kind of soulmates they will be.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Infinity symbol status:</b>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Brown: Enemies (The trigger: fight/discussion)</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Purple: Mutuals (The trigger: Handshake)</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Light green: Friends (The trigger: Hug)</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Green/Dark green: Best friends (Can the depend on how dark green it is) (The trigger: A proper hug)</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Pink: Lovers (The trigger: Kiss/Hug)</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Red: Lovers for life (The trigger: Kiss, but in special circumstances, a hug do also work)</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The infinity symbol CAN change colour, however, it is very unlikely. Now onto something special. Bonding. I don’t feel comfortable writing smut so if someone wants to collab for that and do the bonding stories then please contact me. Bonding is the final step of the soulmate ritual (apart from like marriage (which is kind of what this is except it’s not?) and settle down and have kids. But you get me.). When they bond, the infinity marks and the name to the person will get a colour around it determined how strong their bond really is.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Bonding colours:</b>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Pink: Love can be found (Means: this might be the person you are meant to be within this era, but maybe it wasn’t in the last one.)</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Rose gold: Love (Means: This is pretty strong, but again maybe this is not the person you will be within every lifetime.)</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Gold: True love throughout centuries. (I think that says about it.)</span>
  </em>
