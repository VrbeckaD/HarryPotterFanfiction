    <p>
  <span>“Are you sure you’re okay after-,” Remus’ mum cut herself off, then lowered her voice to a whisper. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>The moon?</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p>
<p>She was standing on her tiptoes, tucking one of Remus’ short curls behind his ear in vain and fussing over the new scratch across his eyebrow. Remus swatted her hand away. Her touch stung a little, but he could just pretend that he was embarrassed of being fussed over on the middle of the platform.</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m fine, mum,” Remus insisted, even though his voice was still hoarse and his entire body ached. He was sweating, his school uniform not really appropriate for the hot September air, and it seemed to make the aching and stinging worse.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The last moon had been three days prior, and without James there, it had been rough, and Remus came out with more wounds and bruises than usual. During the full moons at school, when James was with him, Remus would be fine the next day. But the summer were always harder. More howling, more of throwing himself against the cellar walls and scratching himself anywhere he could reach.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your voice is still weak, </span>
  <em>
    <span>cariad</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Hope frowned as she brought her hand back to Remus’ face. Remus held his face out of her reach, taking a step back. “Oh, I should’ve asked your Da for one of those potions.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus gave her a humourless laugh, “I’m okay, Mum. I promise.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hope sighed in defeat and took a step back, standing flat on her feet again. She crossed her arms, then looked up at her son, her eyes teary. Remus smiled. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s just another year at Hogwarts, innit?” he said, putting his hand on his mother's shoulder. “It’s going to be fine.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hope uncrossed her arms and leaped forward to give Remus a hug. Remus groaned as she grazed the bruises and scratches on his ribs, but he hugged back nonetheless. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now don’t you dare get any taller this year,” she said, her tone </span>
  <em>
    <span>almost </span>
  </em>
  <span>scolding. “A mother can only knit so many sweaters, you know.”</span>
</p>
<p>Remus laughed, “I’ll try my best.”</p>
<p>
  <span>He glanced up at the clock on one of the pillars on the platform. The Express would leave in ten minutes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus let go of his mum and grabbed his trunk, “I’ve got to get on the train, but I’ll write, alright?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hope wiped a tear from the corner of her eye, “Seven years and it doesn’t get easier,” she muttered, then waved her hand. “Go on, meet your friends. I’ll see you next summer, </span>
  <em>
    <span>fy lleuad</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Have fun!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus smiled and gave her one last wave before he set off to get on the train. It felt good to be on his way back, even if he just was on the platform for now. </span>
</p>
<p>Remus hopped on the train and began walking towards their usual compartment in the middle, where he would, presumably, meet up with James, Lily and Peter. Perhaps Dorcas and Marlene too.</p>
<p>What had happened between James and Lily last term was somewhat of a mystery to Remus. First they were almost sworn enemies (at least on Lily’s side), and Lily couldn’t even look in James’ direction without rolling her eyes, and then they were all suddenly eating breakfast together, and sitting and talking civilly in the same compartment on the train ride back to London.</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus shook his head to clear his thoughts as he entered the compartment. It was empty, so Remus guessed that the others were being fussed over by their families as well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He threw his trunk up on the rack above the seats, his joints and muscles groaning in protest as he did, then he slumped down in one of the window seats.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus leaned back and let his eyes fall shut, hoping that he would be able to fall asleep before his friends barged into the compartment. He’d have to go to the Prefect meeting as well, but maybe he could sit this one out and have Lily take care of it. He was too tired.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His wishful thinking didn’t last for long though, as James barged into the compartment not even a minute later. </span>
</p>
<p>Remus groaned, but opened his eyes nonetheless, just in time to see James throw his luggage up on the rack, even though he knew it was James from his scent. The earthy smell of grass and dirt, the slightly chemical smell from his shampoo. </p>
<p>That was something Remus both hated and somehow enjoyed at the same time, his sense of smell. It could be overwhelming at times, when he could smell the salty tears of first years who were sitting in the common room when Remus himself was up in the dormitory. He assumed it was a side effect of his furry little problem, as James liked to call it.</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright there, mate?” James asked, slumping down in the seat opposite of Remus. James was also dressed in his robes already, which was odd, because he usually putting off wearing the school robes until the last minute.</span>
</p>
<p>“I was before you came in,” Remus muttered. James snorted and retrieved his battered snitch from his pocket.</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you have a nice summer?” James let the snitch out of his hand, then grabbed it mid air, almost smushing one of the wings.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I was with you for two weeks,” Remus said. “You should know whether I had a nice summer or not.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James shrugged, “You also spent the better part of the summer locked in the Lupin Cottage, didn’t you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus sighed, “It was fine. I played some guitar, scratched myself open in my cellar, got sunburn as my dad forced me to carry around big cement blocks. You know, the usual.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James nodded, letting go of the snitch and grabbing it again. He ran his hand through his hair and gave an awkward laugh, “Something weird happened after you left, actually. Er…-”</span>
</p>
<p>James was cut off by Lily and Peter walking into the compartment. Peter was breathing heavily, and Remus had to keep himself from scrunching up his nose at the strong stink of sweat coming from his friend. </p>
<p>
  <span>He used the term ‘friend’ loosely with Peter though, sure, they’d slept in the same dorm for six years, and they </span>
  <em>
    <span>had been </span>
  </em>
  <span>friends. Not since fifth year though, and now they were more… acquaintances, than anything.</span>
</p>
<p>“Hey,” Lily said, then turned to put her trunk up on the rack. “I thought we would find you here. Peter almost had a breakdown on the platform because he didn’t know where you were.” </p>
<p>
  <span>Peter spluttered as James let out a laugh. Remus snorted, and couldn’t help but think that a breakdown served Peter right.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It wasn’t a breakdown, alright?” Peter said as he shoved his trunk underneath the seats, instead of bothering with trying to get it up on the rack. He sat down close to the door, and Remus knew it was because Peter wanted to sit as far away as possible from him. “I was just… nervous.”</span>
</p>
<p>“Isn’t that just your regular setting?” Remus muttered. Peter laughed nervously, moving closer to the door. Remus glared at him. “Oh my god, I’m not gonna fucking eat you, Peter. Relax.”</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus sank back into his seat, then turned to James, “You were saying something?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right,” James said, holding tightly onto his snitch. “Right, so… Dumbledore made me Head Boy.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus frowned at him, then looked over at Lily, who shrugged. He turned back to James, “He made </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>, of all perfectly competent people, Head Boy.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James laughed, then gestured to the badge on his robes. Remus raised his eyebrows. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s absurd,” Lily muttered. “You’re like the opposite of Head Boy material.”</span>
</p>
<p>“Oh shut it, Ms Head Girl Evans,” James said. Remus’ eyebrows raised even further. Not that he was surprised that Lily was Head Girl, but more about the fact that Dumbledore had paired them together. “I can enforce the rules if I want to, right, Moony?”</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus laughed, a full-on, rib-hurting laugh, then Lily started sniggering as well. Even Peter joined in, albeit a little nervously. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Right, Moony?” </span>
  </em>
  <span>James said again, glaring at Remus. Remus took a few deep breaths and wiped away a few fake tears. </span>
</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah,” Remus nodded, still breathing heavily, his face flushed from his laughter. “Mh-hm, definitely. Prongs and rules, best friends forever.”</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, fuck you,” James said, then he started fidgeting with his snitch again. “Be careful so I don’t throw you in detention, asshat.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus just chuckled and flipped him the bird before closing his eyes and sinking back against the wall. He was tired and achy and he just wanted to sleep through the entire train ride. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, Rem?” Lily asked and put her hand on his knee. He was </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>tired of people asking him whether he was okay or not. He was fine. Or as fine he could be three days after his body had completely rearranged itself, and he’d torn and ripped it apart, only to have it relocated and “fixed” again, all within the span of a few hours.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, I’m fine,” he muttered, then added— “Tired.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He could imagine the looks Lily and James were sharing so clearly that it felt as though he had his eyes open. The pitiful, sad looks that said “I wish we could do something.” The looks he’d gotten far too many times, from far too many people.</span>
</p>
<p>“You wanna sit this Prefect meeting out?” James asked, fidgeting with his snitch. Remus let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>
  <span>“That would be great. Thanks.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s no problem,” Lily said. Remus nodded slowly and wrapped his cloak tighter around himself, even though he was still sweating.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus woke up by loud voices and the bustling sound of trunks being torn open. He groaned and cracked an eye open, and saw Marlene, Dorcas, Peter, James and Lily all doing or talking about something. Dorcas and Marlene were struggling with getting their uniforms out, Peter was trying to close his trunk, but a ruffle of white and maroon silk fabric was hanging out, preventing him from closing the trunk properly. James and Lily were talking animatedly about something, James still fidgeting with his snitch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The sun had set, and the compartment was lit by the yellowish light from the lamp that sat on the ceiling. It still smelled of Peter’s sweat, as well as the sweet smell from the sweets and pastries that the trolly-witch sold.</span>
</p>
<p>Remus sat up properly and rubbed his eyes, James turned to him and grinned. </p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s alive!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A round of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Whoop!</span>
  </em>
  <span>s went around the compartment. Remus scrunched up his face and groaned, then scrubbed his hands over his face. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Peter kept struggling with his trunk, then let out a very frustrated, “Does anyone know why the </span>
  <em>
    <span>hell </span>
  </em>
  <span>we were supposed to bring dress robes?!”</span>
</p>
<p>Remus opened his eyes to frown at Peter, just in time to see James and Lily share a look. </p>
<p>
  <span>“You know something we don’t, don’t you?” Marlene asked, throwing herself down in her seat. James pressed his lips into a tight line and continued playing with his snitch, and Lily dug out a chocolate frog from her pocket as she turned to face Remus. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You missed the trolly, and we’re nearly there,” she said, handing the chocolate frog to Remus. “But I just assumed you wanted some chocolate.”</span>
</p>
<p>As if on queue, Remus’ stomach gave a loud rumble. He grabbed the frog and gave her a weak smile, “Cheers.”</p>
<p>
  <span>He unwrapped the chocolate, handed the collector card to James without a word, then took a large bite from the frog, biting off its head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ey, I got Dumbledore again,” James grinned, stuffing the card in his cloak. “I could make a shrine for him with all the cards I’ve got.”</span>
</p>
<p>Remus snorted, stuffing the rest of the chocolate into his mouth. It didn’t really help with his hunger. It seemed to make it worse, even. He sighed, slumping back against the wall again.</p>
<p>
  <span>He directed his gaze out the window, squinting in the darkness lit by the half moon, only making out trees, that turned into sheep grazing the grass fields, which turned to trees again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was finally on his way back </span>
  <em>
    <span>home. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Where the Wolf didn’t rumble underneath the surface no matter what day or time it was. Where the laughs weren’t short, forced out of him after half-offensive jokes his father made over dinner. (“Slow down, Remus, you’re eating like a wolf.”) Where he could sleep peacefully, where he could run around freely, commentate the Quidditch matches and throw dung bombs at Snivellus. Where no one commented on his eating habits, where he could hide at the Astronomy Tower and have a joint or two. He was finally going </span>
  <em>
    <span>home.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He smiled to himself then turned to James, “Is this whole </span>
  <em>
    <span>Head Boy </span>
  </em>
  <span>thing going to make you a wet blanket?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did being Prefect make you a wet blanket?” James retorted, shooting Remus a mischievous grin. He lowered his voice to a whisper, “I’ve got some great things planned.”</span>
  <br/>
  <span>Remus grinned, and he swore he could feel the stinging and aching subside a little as both the Wolf and his human mind said </span>
  <em>
    <span>Home.</span>
  </em>
