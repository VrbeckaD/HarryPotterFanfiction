</p><p>
  <span>If the stress and flurry of events hadn’t so completely overwhelmed Sirius, he would have been incredibly annoyed— at the Ministry, at Dumbledore, and at the Dursleys, not necessarily in that order.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As it was, his emotional capacity had already been all used up the moment he got out of Azkaban: relief (the so-relieved-you-just-started-crying kind), fury (also the crying kind), hope (crying again), and grief (full-on sobbing) descended upon him all at once, exhausting and relentless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was Remus, he’d learn later from Dumbledore (very nearly driving him to tears once again), Remus who had been on the edge of desperation himself, jobless and loveless and friendless. Remus, one of Hogwarts’ fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>top graduates,</span>
  </em>
  <span> driven to working temporary, low-paying jobs and housework because no long-term employer would </span>
  <em>
    <span>take</span>
  </em>
  <span> him after seeing the </span>
  <em>
    <span>WEREWOLF </span>
  </em>
  <span>stamped on his resume. It was ridiculous. It was </span>
  <em>
    <span>unfair.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus had gone to the Weasleys, Dumbledore told Sirius, to help Molly with the garden and housework and goblin-banishing for some small pay— and then, he’d met bright little Percy and his curious pet rat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius did not have to have Remus tell him the whole story to imagine how things had gone from there.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>ii.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was smaller and skinnier than James was at that age.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or, Sirius inferred that he was. James had always been an unfairly tall person, and Lily too was far from petite.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, that was not the most worrying thing. Harry had a sort of unnatural quiet about him. He had a habit of walking directly behind Remus and Sirius, as though to become forgotten, as though he didn’t like having his back to anyone, wide-eyed, hands curled into the front of his shirt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hardly spoke a word during the entire ride to Remus’ flat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was </span>
  <em>
    <span>unnerving.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius had half a mind to charge back into Petunia Dursley's disgustingly clean house and demand answers. Harry had Lily’s wide, curious eyes and none of James’ unstoppable talk as they climbed up the stairs to Remus’ home. It reminded Sirius of the way Remus had been, on their first meeting—he’d met him in the most cliche possible way, in a rusty compartment on the train to Hogwarts, and Remus had answered all of his questions with hesitant, one-word answers, yes or no or a shrug, and Sirius had not known what to make of it, but still, he had been charmed, in a way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re my—dad?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus, in the process of unlocking the door to his flat, went still at that small voice. Looked at Sirius, who was already looking at him in a frantic sort of way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um,” Harry muttered, “sorry—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” Sirius said, too loudly. He winced. “I mean, don’t apologize, Harry—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus had crouched down to speak to him, eye-level. “I’m afraid we’re not related by blood, Harry. We were close friends of your mother and father, Sirius and I.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When your Mom and Dad had you, Harry, he—I promised to take care of you, in case anything happened to them. But I—um—yeah, technically speaking, we </span>
  <em>
    <span>are </span>
  </em>
  <span>your guardians.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So we </span>
  <em>
    <span>are </span>
  </em>
  <span>family,” Remus amended, smiling, and it was a smile that Sirius had seen very rarely lately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or the closest thing to it,” said Sirius, and he was smiling a smile that he’d felt very rarely lately, too. “We just weren’t… able to take care of you, for a while. So we’re sorry, mate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was blinking at him as though he’d never had an adult apologize to him in his life. “Oh,” he said. “That’s okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Harry said, and finally he was smiling back. “I. I’d always hoped, that, um—” He flushed. “I used to dream that, maybe my </span>
  <em>
    <span>real </span>
  </em>
  <span>family just got held up, or maybe they were looking for me, and, and one day they’d actually come! And I just had to be patient, and, and.” Harry bit his lip, and he was looking at Sirius like he was the answer to some unheard prayer, and fuck, but Sirius didn’t know if he could hold that gaze for any longer. “And you </span>
  <em>
    <span>came.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Silently, wordlessly, because his throat was too tight to speak, Sirius turned the key in the lock, the door swinging open. He stepped in. Turned on the lights. Remus’ flat was very homey, shabby as it was. It reminded him, a little, of the flat he and Remus had shared, before— before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hoped Harry liked it. </span>
  <span>Sirius swallowed past the lump in his throat. “Welcome home, Harry.”</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>iii.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While Harry was off falling in love with Remus’ flat—looking at dusty books and mismatched furniture and his </span>
  <em>
    <span>room </span>
  </em>
  <span>(he seemed very excited to have a room)</span>
  <span>—Remus caught Sirius’ eye, raised his eyebrows, and murmured, “You can’t afford </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>to be a responsible adult anymore, Sirius.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Fuck,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius said with feeling, because Remus was perfectly right.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus laughed at him, bumping elbows companionably, and then he was unlocking the doors to the adjacent bedroom. “Harry’s room used to be my office of sorts. Just books and things—but I’ve put in a bed and a closet for him,” he said. “It’s, well. There’s only one other room, so we sleep there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The redness creeping up his neck and ears and cheeks was </span>
  <em>
    <span>adorable. </span>
  </em>
  <span>“Alright,” Sirius said, grinning. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Nothing we haven’t done before,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he wanted to say, and carefully told himself to shut the fuck up. The palm of his hand itched to hold Remus’; to reach up and cup Remus’ chin and </span>
  <em>
    <span>kiss</span>
  </em>
  <span> him, but—well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There had been an unusual fragility in their relationship since Azkaban, in what they were to each other, in what they had been. Sirius was loath to shatter it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(It was </span>
  <em>
    <span>annoying.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius and Remus had been so many things, but Sirius had never remembered a time where they’d been in this strange limbo, this unfamiliarity, this </span>
  <em>
    <span>awkward.)</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>(He had to fix it, and fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>soon.)</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus sent him a look. “Shut up, Sirius.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t say anything!”</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>iv.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A truth: Sirius was not, in any way, prepared for or in want of a child.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was not that he was too immature or free-spirited to think about ‘settling down,’ in those precious few years post-Hogwarts, pre-Azkaban (he had taken to calling it that now, dividing his life in eras). Although that was certainly what most people assumed of him, that his attitude was not yet suited to adulthood. But the truth was that back then, he had already </span>
  <em>
    <span>found </span>
  </em>
  <span>that—that incredible, wonderful feeling of stability and contentment and </span>
  <em>
    <span>joy</span>
  </em>
  <span>—with Remus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No; the truth was that (if Sirius ever decided to be completely honest with himself, which was not often) the idea of parenting </span>
  <em>
    <span>terrified</span>
  </em>
  <span> him. The truth was that neither Sirius nor Remus were glowing examples of brilliant, happy childhoods, and the idea of another person’s life, a young child’s attitude and manners and beliefs in </span>
  <em>
    <span>his </span>
  </em>
  <span>reckless irresponsible hands—no. That terrified him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the second truth, which was one no less important, was that just because he felt neither ready nor deserving to raise Harry did not, in any way, mean he did not </span>
  <em>
    <span>want </span>
  </em>
  <span>to.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>v.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your home is </span>
  <em>
    <span>super </span>
  </em>
  <span>messy,” Harry said that evening at dinner, eyes bright, then bit his lip as though his comment might not be appreciated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus just laughed. “I know, Harry, I’m sorry. I haven’t had time to fix it up again, though we will soon. Sirius just wanted to pick you up first at the soonest possibility—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no, I meant—” Harry shrugged. “Aunt Petunia </span>
  <em>
    <span>always</span>
  </em>
  <span> wanted everything clean and tidy, so—well, she’d hate it here, but. It’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>really </span>
  </em>
  <span>interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus blinked. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah! She’d hate how old the books are, and how weird the furniture is, </span>
  <em>
    <span>and </span>
  </em>
  <span>there’s no TV—but I think it’s really cool! So, I mean, I—I love it. Here.” And he flushed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Remus said to himself, with a very honest pride. “Well, you hear that, Sirius? My flat is </span>
  <em>
    <span>cool.”</span>
  </em>
