    <p>Chapter 1- The Inheritance</p><p> </p><p>It was a sunny day down in Spinner’s end Yorkshire, an uncommon occurrence as it was. But what happened that day would forever baffle the muggle minds inhabiting that town. You see it was January 9th they were supposed to be deep in the throes of winter with an overcast sky and the possibility of snow. It had been bitingly cold yesterday but today not only was it sunny but it was warm, as in summer warm. And if only they knew the next day would bring the biting cold back.</p><p>Down a way in Spinner’s end house number 2 it was a great day, since Severus Snape wizard had not only turned ten years old that day but he had finally come into his inheritance as a Nephilim. That came as a surprise though he already knew everything needed about it since his family was descended from them only a powerful wizard would inherit the full powers of their ancestors and become a full-blooded Nephilim. Severus was up in his room admiring his new black wings that sometimes seemed to shimmer with a bluish tint so black they were. The same color as his hair that matched eyes of deepest onyx set in a pale face. Severus was tall for his age and thin he was also very sarcastic and could be down right snarky when angered. His best friend was Lily another witch who also had Nephilim Ancestors though it was unknown if the powers would manifest in her. Severus thought they would as she had ample control of their “accidental or natural magic” just as he had.</p><p>They would find out in three days’ time as Lily’s birthday was on the 12th of January.</p><p>“Severus stop primping in front of your mirror and come down here to meet your guests!” the deep voice of Tobias Snape rumbled through the house.</p><p>“Come on Severus dear Lily is here as is Petunia and Hyacinth Evans, I’m afraid Paul couldn’t make it. Besides I know you want to show Lily your new wings” that was his mother Eileen Prince Snape calling.</p><p>“Coming mum” Severus shouted back.</p><p>And with a great amount of noise ran down the stairs and… right into Lily sending them both to the ground.</p><p>“Severus Alistair! What have I told you about running in the house?”</p><p>“Sorry mum” Sev answered with a small groan while helping Lily up.</p><p>Petunia who was eleven and was home for vacations from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic giggled while Mrs. Evans looked as if she was restraining laughing herself.</p><p>“Hey Sev those wings are awesome! Have any more powers manifested yet? Do you know how to fly? Can you fly? What about your magic, is it more powerful?”</p><p>Lily was bombarding Severus with questions in her usual chatterbox way.</p><p>“Just a moment Lily I can’t answer if you don’t let me talk… so first thanks for the wings I love them already, no more powers have manifested, yet, I haven’t been out to try them yet and I suppose I can fly being as Nephilims are half-angels and finally my magic has become more powerful, today I dressed myself with just a simple wave of my hand.”</p><p>Sev answered Lily’s entire questions with an easy grin that he only permitted himself to wear around Lily.</p><p>“Come on let’s go play outside Lil’s want to join us Tuney?” Sev asked</p><p>“No thank you Severus not just yet maybe later and happy birthday” Petunia spoke with a pointed glance at Lily</p><p>“Oh! Yes happy birthday Sev” Lily giggled as she suddenly remembered.</p><p>After brief instructions from the adults about being careful and not showing their powers and after Eileen applied a glamour charm to Severus’ wings they where bade to go outside and enjoy the sunny day which the adults knew being Witches and in the case of Tobias Squib themselves knew had been caused by the awakening of a Nephilim power’s so something similar would happen on Lily’s birthday if she indeed was proven to have inherited the same powers as Severus.</p><p>Severus and Lily played until they couldn’t run anymore, Petunia joined them occasionally but always trying to play the grownup she was more often with the adults trying to catch some juicy gossip. Severus was dying to try flying but they lived in a muggle neighbourhood so people might see them they were already risking enough with some slight magical aspects in his party but if someone were to see him learn to use his wings it would really blow up the Statute of Secrecy.</p><p>“Thank you for coming Mrs. Evans, Petunia, Lily. I had a great time today and thanks for the presents I loved them,” Severus said once the afternoon was nearly over.</p><p>He was looking forward to the 12th of January when Lily’s birthday celebration was taking place.</p><p>“No problem Severus we had a great time as well and I’m glad you enjoyed the gifts, we enjoyed the afternoon here as well see you on the 12th” Hyacinth Evans said.</p><p>She was Lily and Petunia’s mother.</p><p>“Bye Severus hope to see you soon” Petunia said</p><p>“Luv you Sev can’t wait for my birthday to see if I have wings like you. I think I will and besides I get to see you again soon.” Lily called giving him a kiss on the cheek that left Severus blushing.</p><p>On the morning of the 12th the day was once again warm and sunny if possible even more so than on the 9th which only baffled the muggles even more. Petunia had permission from Madame Maxime to stay a bit further in her winter vacations so she could attend her sister’s birthday. When Lily opened her eyes bright and early that morning she nearly made her mother and father have a heart attack from the sheer shout of joy when she discovered her wings, two beautiful appendages a fiery auburn colour with golden wing tips in her primary feathers. The wings almost seemed on fire like her hair. Severus came together with Eileen and Tobias and also had a game full of fun and games, the food was delicious and the games almost seemed never-ending. Lily and Severus created a friendship bond when their wings brushed together meaning they were going to be together for all time. Or at least their parents told them it was a friendship bond when in reality it was the mark of soul-mates and its significance rested in that in the future they would be mates since their love for each other was that strong. Lily and Severus wouldn’t discover the truth until somewhere in their fourth or fifth year at Hogwarts.</p><p>And that is how the story of our two Nephilim heroes begins and all of their adventures together both in Hogwarts and away from it.</p>
