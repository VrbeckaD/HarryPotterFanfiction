</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Standing alone in her living room, Hermione Granger-Weasley stared at the impressive waterfall before her. As much as she missed Ron, this assignment had its perks. Creating her own home in the depths of this ancient cave had been a challenge, but one that she had relished. The timing could not have been more perfect - she needed space and Ron was away on another Auror mission. Since he had passed his three-year intensive training, he had been away on missions all over the world. </p><p> </p><p>Listening to the calming fall of the water, Hermione breathed deeply as her head pounded again. She had felt lousy for the last few days, but today she had had enough. This morning she had been woken by a dull throbbing in her head which had now progressed into a full-blown headache. She had hoped a day of lying on the sofa with the soothing waterfall sounds would help, but no, she felt worse than ever.</p><p> </p><p>Frustrated to the point of tears, Hermione wrapped her arms around her torso and breathed deeply, trying to release the tension which had worked its way into her shoulders when a bout of nausea hit so strong she lost her balance. She stumbled backwards as panic made her heart skip a beat, missing the arrival of her saviour until he was catching her fall.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione kept her eyes closed as she exhaled slowly and relaxed into Draco before she turned and cuddled into his warm embrace, her earlier thoughts of Ron replaced by memories of Draco as he held her tightly. </p><p> </p><p>Their odd little relationship had begun somewhat tempestuously when Draco began working in the Department of Mysteries, hired on as a Dark Artefact consultant to help Hermione with an extremely unusual case. Convinced he was the same condescending twat from school, Hermione had raged, demanding that he be removed from the case. As the weeks progressed, Hermione found herself intrigued by the man before her. They had spent a copious amount of time together and not once had her former tormentor sneered at her. If anything, he had been the perfect gentleman and she had been the bully.</p><p> </p><p>Resolved to change her attitude, Hermione made a consistent effort to involve Malfoy in what she was doing or trying to achieve instead of barking orders and waiting for him to bite back. In return, Draco had offered tiny insights into his life and garnished her with new bits of information relating to the dark artefacts they were studying. Slowly but surely, Hermione’s good intentions began to extend outside of work. A few months later, Draco could be found sitting somewhat uncomfortably between Harry and George at Hermione’s 21st birthday. Thinking back to the beginnings of their friendship and all the progress they had made, Hermione felt her heart swell with pride. Everyone had changed following the war in one way or another, none more so than the man beside her. </p><p> </p><p>Smiling to himself as Hermione released a contented hum, Draco pulled her in closer as she shook. He rubbed soothing circles on her lower back and felt the icy coolness of her skin. “Are you ok?” Draco asked quietly, trying to get a look at her face tucked against his chest.</p><p> </p><p>Instead of answering, Hermione nodded, savouring the feel of his expensive jumper rubbing against her cheek, feebly attempting to keep hold of Draco when he tried to pull away. </p><p> </p><p>Laughing, Draco took pity on Hermione, wrapping her more securely in his coat, “You know we’re going to be late for lunch,” Draco mentioned quietly. Whilst he was enjoying having Hermione wrapped around him, Draco was anxious to avoid the wrath of Molly Weasley. </p><p> </p><p>Groaning loudly at the mention of lunch, Hermione felt Draco’s repressed laughter vibrate through his broad chest. Today they were expected to be at The Burrow for another Weasley lunch, bound to be jam-packed and full of noise. It was far from ideal when all Hermione wanted to do was stay snuggled against Draco. </p><p> </p><p>As if on cue, Hermione’s ward bell rang loudly, interrupting another moment of silence. Reaching out with her magic and feeling Ginny’s presence, Hermione reluctantly waved her hand to lower the wards, curling into Draco for protection as the harsh click-clack of Ginny’s heels echoed throughout the cave. </p><p> </p><p>Leaning down to whisper, Draco asked, “Are you sure you’re ok?” his concern now evident in his tone. </p><p> </p><p>Feeling the room spin again, Hermione ignored Draco’s question, choosing to take deep even breaths as Ginny’s loud voice joined the din created by her high heels clacking against the stone floor.</p><p> </p><p>“Mum sent me as you’re both late,” she announced, joining them in the living space. </p><p> </p><p>“We know,” Draco began, turning to look at Ginny over his shoulder. “I came over to pick Hermione up but as I walked in I’m pretty sure she was about to faint so here we are.” </p><p> </p><p>Disgruntled, Hermione pinched at Draco’s skin through his jumper. No one understood her desire to live in this underground ancient cave and they used every opportunity to tell her it was not good for her.</p><p> </p><p>Sure enough, Draco’s moan of “Ow,” was drowned out by Ginny launching into another rant about the dangers of living underground, almost as if Hermione hadn’t bothered to look them up herself. Forcing herself away from Draco, Hermione shot him a look, turning to wordlessly and wandlessly summon her coat from the closet.</p><p> </p><p>Heading for the exit on unsteady feet, Hermione grabbed Draco’s hand, telling herself it was for his benefit, not hers. Following suit, Ginny turned and made her way back outside, still lecturing even though she knew they likely were not listening. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll see you at the house in a minute then,” Ginny said brusquely before turning on her heel and disapparating. </p><p> </p><p>Sighing, Hermione looked up at Draco. “Don’t you dare leave me with them today,” she said, trying and failing to inject a bit of force into her words.</p><p> </p><p>Draco smirked, “Well…I do have an important meeting I should be at,” he joked lightly before Hermione paled and swayed on her feet again. “Hey - are you sure you’re ok?” he asked, tilting her chin gently so he could look at her properly. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine,” Hermione lied, shrugging to avoid looking into his eyes. Draco had the uncanny ability to read her like an open book. “Just don’t leave me.”</p><p> </p><p>“As if I could ever leave you,” Draco replied tucking her firmly against his side. “Are you ready?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Hermione mumbled as she wrapped her arms around him once more. “Just keep us out of sight in case I’m sick.” </p><p> </p><p>Thinking of their favourite spot next to the old apple tree, Draco secured his grip on Hermione and apparated them both away.</p><p> </p><p>Lunch at The Burrow was a hectic affair, as always. Due to the size of the gathering, they had once again found themselves outside, making use of the family picnic tables. Sitting quietly next to Draco, Hermione enjoyed the refreshing breeze as she steadily ate through the small amount of food on her plate and ignored the looks of concern coming her way every few minutes. </p><p> </p><p>Chatting animatedly with Charlie, George and Angelina about Quidditch, Draco snuck an arm around Hermione’s waist, pulling her close as he thought of the first Weasley lunch she had dragged him to. It had come shortly after the first anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione, along with Harry, had insisted he attend and despite his best efforts, Draco had found himself surrounded by Weasleys. </p><p> </p><p>To say he was daunted by such a thing would have been an understatement, avoiding eye contact with everyone but Hermione. Draco had sat very quietly for the first hour of lunch, that was until Harry had challenged him to a Seeker showdown and everyone promptly began splitting into two teams for the post-lunch match. As soon as the first match finished they scheduled another, then another and another. It was now a monthly ritual for them all to get together and play with whoever was in the country at the time. </p><p> </p><p>Originally there had been a game scheduled for today, but with Angelina heavily pregnant, Harry and Ron away on another mission and Bill and Fleur busy with their renovations to Shell Cottage, Ginny had called the game off. </p><p> </p><p>As lunch drew to a close, Draco turned to Hermione. “I can take you home now if you want?” he offered quietly, taking note of her still peaky complexion.</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m fine, thank you. I feel better here,” Hermione replied, moving slowly to follow everyone else inside.</p><p> </p><p>Naturally, Draco was there to catch Hermione when she lost her balance again. “You’re not fine,” he muttered, holding onto her waist as they made their way into the house. “We’ll stay another half hour, then I’m taking you home.”</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” Hermione mumbled as she sat down on the sofa, impatiently waiting for Draco to join her. Curling up against him, pleasure hummed through her body as Draco began lightly tracing patterns across her arm. How was it she could enjoy this man’s touch so much more than her husband’s? Shutting her mind down before she could overanalyse the feeling, Hermione allowed her body to melt into Draco’s. </p><p> </p><p>Refusing to allow guilt to mar her happiness, Hermione watched as everyone fawned over little Victoire. It was her second birthday next month and she already had the whole family wrapped around her little finger. Arthur was currently entertaining her by letting her bounce all over him, creating a different noise every time her little body landed on his. </p><p> </p><p>Tears pricked in Hermione’s eyes as she wondered if this was what it would be like when she and Ron had their first child - lazy Saturdays at his parents where everyone doted on their son or daughter - when guilt flooded her system. Gods, she was so confused. Being with Draco soothed her, she relished his touch and craved his company, but Ron was her husband. </p><p> </p><p>Ron, who wanted children so desperately it was all they ever spoke about. Ron, who relentlessly pushed the issue until Hermione had caved, even though he knew she wanted a career first. At the time, Hermione had wondered if she was being selfish holding off on having children, but watching the family now, Hermione knew in her heart she was not ready for this yet. Agreeing to try for a baby with Ron when their relationship was just beginning to mend had been a mistake, but how could she tell Ron without him hating her?</p><p> </p><p>Closing her eyes against the tears that threatened to fall, Hermione concentrated on Draco’s hand as it continued its meandering path up and down her arm, convincing herself as she did that she deserved this little slice of happiness. After everything Ron had done, she could enjoy this.</p><p> </p><p>For months their relationship had been rocky, with Ron’s missions becoming longer and longer, Hermione’s old anxieties began creeping back into her day to day life, the respite Ron’s presence was supposed to provide when he returned never prevailed. Instead, Hermione was told tales of how he and his <em> partner </em> had escaped situation after situation by the skin of their teeth and how they were praised for <em> their </em> teamwork, with Ron even commenting once how they were so close they were almost the same person. It hurt thinking of Ron with his <em> other </em> woman. It wasn’t enough that Ron constantly compared the two of them in every conversation, he had to go and stay with her during their separation. He could have gone anywhere but he went to <em> her </em>. Pushing away all her hurt and confusion, Hermione focused on Draco, only Draco - his steady heartbeat, his divine smell and the aura of calm he carried with him. </p><p> </p><p>Draco knew Hermione had fallen asleep against him when her grip on his jumper slackened and her breathing became heavier. Settling further back into the sofa and noticing the tear tracks on Hermione’s cheeks, Draco decided to delay his plans, not wanting to upset Hermione further by breaking his promise. Knowing how much Hermione enjoyed his caress, Draco kept up his smooth rhythm, worrying as he did so about how much putting on a brave face was really costing her. </p><p> </p><p>An hour later as the chatter died down and the group started to disperse, Draco decided it was time to take Hermione home. Moving from the sofa to say their goodbyes, Draco smiled as Hermione reached out for him in her sleep. He thanked Mrs Weasley for her fabulous cooking and carefully wrapped Hermione in his coat before lifting her into his strong arms.</p><p> </p><p>“You take good care of her Draco. From what Ronald tells me they’ll be starting a family soon!” Mrs Weasley gushed as Draco carefully followed her through the kitchen, hoping she missed how his hands clenched possessively on Hermione’s body.</p><p> </p><p>“I always do,” Draco replied, thinking of all the times he had cared for Hermione after something dear <em> Ronald </em> had done to upset her. Mrs Weasley waved them off happily as Draco increased his grip on Hermione and concentrated on the wooded area which concealed Hermione's home before disapparating. </p><p> </p><p>Feeling the welcoming magic of her home pulsate around her, Hermione relaxed in Draco’s arms and reached out with a sleep laden hand to pat Draco’s chest slowly in thanks for bringing her home. </p><p> </p><p>Draco chuckled and made his way through the cave. He entered her spotless bedroom, faltering for a moment as he tried to ignore the memories of the last time he was in there. Holding her carefully, Draco moved the duvet back and swiftly settled Hermione down, removing her shoes before placing the covers up to her chin, just as she liked. Planting a small kiss on her forehead to satisfy his desires, Draco sighed as he stood up and filled the glass of water on her bedside, wishing more than anything he could crawl in beside her. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Hermione sighed sleepily as she felt Draco move away.</p><p><br/>“No problem, Granger, now sleep,” Draco replied, quietly pulling the door closed behind him. Walking back through the living room, Draco’s eye was drawn - as always - to the wedding picture of Hermione and Ron. <em> Stupid ginger git </em>, Draco thought irritably as he scuffed his shoe against the floor. Jealousy was not something he was accustomed to feeling, especially when it came to a Weasley having something - or someone - he wanted.</p>
