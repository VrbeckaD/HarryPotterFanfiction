    <p>It was safe to say he was surprised when he received his letter of acceptance. To Keith, Hogwarts was only a dream, a place he never thought it would be possible for him to reach. And yet, there he was. He handed the parchment over to his mother who quickly skimmed over the letter, immediately looking down at her son after she had finished. She was smiling at him, but Keith could see the worry behind her eyes as she did so. He knew she was genuinely happy for him, he had been wanting to attend Hogwarts since his mother had told him stories about her time there when he was younger. Some kids have fairytales, Keith had school tales. But he could tell what she was thinking, why the worry was residing in her gaze. It was the reason they were both convinced he wouldn’t be accepted in the first place. Keith was cursed with lycanthropy. He was a werewolf. </p><p>Platform nine and three quarters was bustling with children and their families as they said their goodbyes and boarded the Hogwarts Express. Keith, however, was trapped in a tight hug by his mother. And it didn’t seem she would be letting go anytime soon. He wasn’t exactly protesting against this action, but he was eager to join the others on the train. The thought of cabins filling up was bugging him, didn’t want to be squashed next to someone the entire ride. Krolia reluctantly let go of her son after hearing the final call for the train, not wanting him to miss the express. </p><p>“Stay safe, Keith.” She looked down at her son, the look of worry still in her eyes. It hadn’t seemed to have left since his acceptance into the school, but there was more than just worry now. There was happiness and pride. She knew how much he had wanted this, and she had wanted it for him. </p><p>“I will, don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine.” He tried to reassure her. </p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too, mum.” And with that, Keith made his way towards the train. He took one last glance at his mother, waving and smiling like everyone else before completely disappearing into the express. He walked down the isle of the train, searching for an empty cabin. Due to boarding at the last minute, Keith missed any and all opportunities to have the luxury of his own private space. So instead he settled for the closest cabin that wasn’t already filled to its maximum capacity. </p><p>He knocked on the sliding door and carefully opened it, the children inside turned their heads his way. </p><p>“I was wondering if I could sit here? Everywhere else is full.” </p><p>“Oh. Yeah, that’s fine.” A short girl with glasses replied. </p><p>Keith entered the space, sliding the door shut behind him as the others watched him intently. He sat himself down next to a tanned boy with eyes that held almost the same colour as the sky on a bright day. The boy looked at Keith in confusion. Keith hadn’t realised he’d been looking at him a little too long and didn’t hesitate to pull his gaze away. They all sat in a silence that was more than obviously awkward until the boy sitting across from him spoke up. </p><p>“So uh.. well I’m hunk, this is Katie, but we call her Pidge” he said, gesturing to the girl at his side. “And that’s Lance.” He looked across the cabin at the boy sitting next to Keith. </p><p>“My name’s Keith.” He looked down at his hands. He wasn’t the best at conversing, and at that point he would rather have the awkward silence back. But apparently they hadn’t given up on speaking to him. </p><p>“Which house do you think you’ll get?” Pidge questioned. She seemed to be asking everyone but she was looking directly at Keith. </p><p>“I’m not sure. I haven’t really thought about it.” Which was true. Keith hadn’t thought about the houses, he didn’t think he would even be allowed into the school until recently, and before that he didn’t want to get his hopes up by considering which house he would be placed in. </p><p>“I think I’ll be in Gryffindor.” Lance sounded confident in that. He clearly had a preference for Gryffindor. </p><p>“Hufflepuff I guess? I don’t know much about the houses really..” Hunk seemed a little confused about the whole system, which was fair considering they placed a talking hat on your head and he told you where you belonged. </p><p>“I think I’ll be a Ravenclaw.” </p><p>“That’s obvious, Pidge. I’m willing to bet you’ll be one of the smartest people in our year.” </p><p>“No Lance, you’re just a dumbass.” Pidge pushed up her glasses and grinned while Lance feigned hurt. The three of them continued on with their conversation while Keith pretended he didn’t exist, making sure to look at anything except the people around him. Until Lance decided he wasn’t quite done with Keith yet.</p><p>“Hey, earth to Keith.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Why don’t you join the conversation? You’re just sitting there in silence. It’s creepy.” Unfortunately, Keith didn’t catch onto the fact Lance was joking soon enough. </p><p>“Excuse me? I’ll be silent if I want.” He snapped. And only then did the fact Lance was messing around hit him. </p><p>“Whoa calm your jets dude, it was a bad joke. Sorry.” Lance had a slight look of guilt on his face, but his words were filled with sarcasm and he was clearly a bit pissed. Keith, being the social extraordinaire he was, didn’t say anything else. He once again resumed his silence. Finally, after what felt like years, did the train arrive at its destination. By that point, Keith was being a bit more sociable. Sitting in the same cabin with people for six hours can do that to you. And by then he nearly considered the three of them to be his friends. Although Lance was clearly still a little annoyed with him. </p><p>“Don’t worry about your things, they’ve already been taken to the castle.” A large man informed them all as they gathered together, waiting for their next instruction. </p><p>The first years were led to a dock where they clambered into the boats and set off to the castle. Lance and Keith were once again stuck next to each other, but they were so focused on the stars above them and the lights reflecting on the water from the castle that they barely noticed each other’s presence. The boat ride came to an end and students were moving once again. They all set off on their quest to the great hall, where they would be sorted into their houses. </p><p>Out of the names Keith had learned, Hunk’s was called first. He moved towards the sentient hat and was quickly placed into Hufflepuff, just as he predicted. It took a while for the next name he recognised to come. Pidge was next, and in the end she was the first and only hatstall. It took eight minutes for her house to be called out, the final decision being Slytherin. She looked shocked, her plans of being in Ravenclaw had clearly just been destroyed. But she seemed happy with the outcome nonetheless. Soon after it was Keith’s turn.</p><p>‘Ah. A werewolf, hm? It’s very rare that I sort anything other than witches and wizards. I sense bravery within you. Hm.. The best place for you would have to be..’</p><p>“Gryffindor!” Applause erupted from the red table as Keith made his way towards it. He was greeted by the prefects not long after sitting down. He almost didn’t notice Lance walking over to the very table he was sitting at, but when Lance called out his name while grinning, his presence was officially made known. They were once again next to each other as Lance smiled gleefully. He had gotten his wish, he was in Gryffindor. The ceremony ended seemingly fast, and before Keith could comprehend what was happening, he found himself following his new housemates up staircases that would move at random intervals. Keith’s mother had mentioned these when she was telling him the stories of her time at the school. The thought of the staircases moving made Keith uneasy at first, but it wasn’t so bad. Eventually, the group found themselves standing in front of a large portrait. The lady inside the artwork tried convincing the prefect to watch as she smashed a cup with her voice. He didn’t really have much of a choice, though. The Fat Lady tried her best attempt at breaking the glass but failed. So she resorted to smashing it against the architecture inside the painting instead. </p><p>“Cauldron cakes.” The prefect said to the lady. The painting swung open, revealing the common room hidden behind it. The first years were directed to their rooms and Keith and Lance, once again, were placed next to each other. What were the odds? Their beds were exactly next to each other which Keith could tell was going to be great considering Lance’s attitude towards him still hadn’t lightened very much. Then again, even just a small part of him seemed to be warming up to the idea of Keith being around.</p>
