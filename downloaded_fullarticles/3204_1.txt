    <p>Harry nervously advanced on the potions classroom after the Philosopher's Stone debacle and knocked hesitantly on the door.</p><p>"Enter." He heard a terse voice say.</p><p>Harry entered to the scowl of the man he had grown to hate over the course of the last year. </p><p>"What do you want Potter?" Snape growled.</p><p>"I-I..." Harry started before taking a deep breath and swallowing his pride. "I want to apologise for suspecting you were going to steal the Stone."</p><p>"I'm sorry Potter, I didn't quite hear that." The other man said with a smirk.</p><p>Harry scowled but repeated his apology, controlling his breathing all the while. If he was going to do this, he would do it properly.</p><p>Silence had enveloped the room after Harry's apology when Snape suddenly broke it.</p><p>"Anything else Potter?"</p><p>"No, sir," Harry replied. </p><p>At least he tried. Harry doubted that if Snape had been in Harry's position that he would have done the same thing. But oh well, what's done is done and it can't be taken back.</p><p>0o0o0o0o0o</p><p>The next day at the end of Potions class, Harry briefly smiled when for the first time, he turned in a finished potion at the end of class. Maybe he had gotten through to the grouchy old professor after all.</p>
