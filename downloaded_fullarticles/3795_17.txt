    <p>Tina and Newt found him in Central Park, unconscious. After expending so much energy trying (and ultimately failing) to control his obscurus, Credence was drained, physically, mentally and emotionally. He offered no resistance when they went to take him in to MACUSA. </p>
<p>For everyone's' safety Credence was put in a magically induced coma to try and repair some of the damage done. Only when it was evident that his healing could progress no further while he was unconscious Credence was gradually woken up. He drifted in and out of consciousness for 4 days. </p>
<p>Tina had kept vigil for nearly 50 hours before Queenie and Newt forced her back to her apartment to shower and rest. Queenie sat with the boy only leaving when Newt took position by the bedside. </p>
<p>No one knew what to expect when Credence woke fully. Would he remember everything that happened? How would he deal with it if he did remember? Would he lose control again? Newt had delayed his trip back to Europe as he felt he was best fit to deal with the obscurus. The young man was determined to help Credence where he had failed the young Sudanese girl. </p>
<p>The obscurus was not the only threat on the horizon. Grindelwald, while imprisoned, had powerful allies who could decide to capture Credence if they found out he was alive. Various factions in MACUSA were interested in the boy's potential power. Even if the obscurus was removed, Credence was immensely powerful, he had to be to have survived as long as he had as an obscurial. President Picquery wanted to keep a close eye on the boy, Newt knew she had not ruled out imprisoning him yet. </p>
<p>It was with all of these different threats that Newt, Tina and Queenie took matters into their own hands. They stood around the hospital bed and agreed, their number one priority would be Credence. He desperately needed allies in this hostile, foreign world of magic. He needed to learn not only to control the obscurus but to control all manner of magic.</p>
<p>They would be his teachers.</p>
