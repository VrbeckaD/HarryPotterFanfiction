    <p>Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville were sitting in the common room, spewing out ideas to continue this whole D.A. group, absolutely basking in the thrill that they were defying Umbridge. (The skeezy git. Who in their right minds could possibly think her toady-self would actually control these students? Harry Potter, of all-!) </p>
<p>"Should we keep using the Room after Filch found us, Harry?" Hermione had interrupted his thoughts, yet Harry had not been paying attention at all. "Uh, yeah." He blurted, trying an innocent smile at Hermione's obviously exasperated sigh.</p>
<p>"We need to get going to the meeting we already have planned. We can discuss later." He mumbled, getting to his feet a bit awkwardly. The Scar was starting to cause a headache, and some foreign feeling,one Harry had not felt in a long while, was twisting its way around his gut.</p>
<p>Ron lead them out, eyes running over the parchment he'd taken in the midst of Harry's obvious disarrayment. The words "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good" were uttered, accompanied by a tap of a wand to the Marauder's Map, and the thing was working. "Snape is on six. Gotta be careful." Ron muttered before they set off down the hall to the Blank Wall Area, set on Requiring the Room.</p>
<p>"Wonder what Malfoy is doing, wandering around this late without his little posse." Harry commented quietly, which earned him an indifferent shrug from Ron and Hermione.</p>
<p>The group made it to the seventh floor with no complications, whereupon they happened to find the door had already been Required, and simply entered.
Half of the group was there, yet it looked like there were a few newcomers-huddling around Zacharious Smith. "Just bloody wonderful." Harry muttered under his breath as the group caught sight of him and proceeded to give him such scathing looks that would put even Snape to shame.
Harry tossed them a shit-eating grin before he went over to the bookshelves and glanced over their progress list. These defiers would need to catch up on ten lessons, which would be just wonderful to work them through.
After a few minutes, in which the rest of the group had arrived and the chatter was starting to rub his patience to a pulp, Harry blew the whistle. Silence fell at once-except from the group around Smith.</p>
<p>Too tired to mess with it, he gave Hermione a nod, and she performed a-quite glorious-"Silencio!". Ignoring the silent exclamations of protest from the group, Harry started talking.</p>
<p>"Since we've got newcomers, tonight I want to review our basics and see what everyone can remember. Partner up and duel with only those three spells-if anyone is caught by Hermione, Ron, or myself, doing any other charms or jinxes, you're down for the count with a body bind. Understood?" He finished, looking rather worn out from his small speech. When everyone uttered their quiet ascent, he nodded, and they got to work. He made his way over to the group of Silent Screamers with Hermione, and waited for her to undo the charm.</p>
<p>"--how the bloody <i>hell</i> you think you're allowed to do that to me, of all people! Do you <i>know</i> who my father is?!" The one up in Harry's space, beet red in the face, was yelling. Performing the charm himself, Harry sighed, giving them a dull look. "If you'd mind, I'd like to get you started on the training." He snapped, holding a finger up to Neville as he tried to ask a question. "Take out your wands. Do any of you happen to know the disarming charm?"</p>
<p>"Harry... Dumbledore... He's standing in the doorway..." Hermione mumbled to him, and Harry whipped around, the feeling from earlier giving a startling spike up his spine.</p>
<p>"I see you've taken Defense Against The Dark Arts into your own hands, Harry." Dumbledore commented. The first thing he'd said since the end of last term.</p>
<p>"Yes. Please tell me now if you're intending to report us or not, as I've work to get on with." Harry replied in a sharp tone, body gone rigid. The Headmaster simply perked his brow in slight surprise, clearing his throat. "I think we can have a talk about this tomorrow morning after breakfast. You'll be excused from Double Potions for the time I have you. Carry on." The wizard nodded once and shut the door, giving Harry a queazy feeling towards the manner in which Dumbledore had regarded him.</p>
<p>"Well! What are you doing? Get back to it!" Hermione ordered after a few beats of awkward silence. Everyone slowly got back to what they were doing, but Harry was looking troubled. "You alright,mate?" Ron mumbled, and Harry shrugged him off. "Just need a moment. Make sure those... They sign... The... The parchment." He managed before briskly exiting the room.</p>
<p>Ignoring the attempts to get him to stop, Harry shut the door and strode down the hallway, automatically making his way towards the library. He didn't care about the people he passed, any greetings offered, or any sneers directed his way. He was stumbling, unable to really function. Vision blurry around the edges and throat growing tight, Harry finally made it into the library. He made his way to the back, wherein he was blindfolded and pinned down.</p>
<p>Panic spiked-it had to be one of the Death Eaters! Maybe it was even Umbridge herself! What if he di-</p>
<p>Lips were pressed to Harry's, and it felt as if every bit of tension was destroyed at that moment. He sunk back into the shelf, thoroughly relaxed as he kissed the stranger back. He should be worrying, scared out of his wits. But this was a good kisser. Very good.</p>
<p>A few moments later-<i>very good moments</i>-the person pulled back. A low whine escaped Harry's throat and he leaned forward, making to chase their lips. A chuckle, one sounding a bit deep for a female, met his ears as a slip of parchment was pressed into his hand. The next second, Harry was separated from the person. He undid the blindfold and looked around eagerly, hoping to catch a glimpse of the person.</p>
<p>Alas, they had escaped. Remembering the parchment, Harry unfolded it, and stared at the words.</p>
