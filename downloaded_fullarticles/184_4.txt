    <strong>Living in Blood – Chapter 1 (All Set in Motion)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Lily and James Potter could be found in their sitting room with several visitors, but they weren't alarmed who was keeping them company. If anything, they were at ease while making conversation. Even if the topic at hand wasn't the relaxing to have.</p>
  <p>"I'm just saying Lily, that you will all be much safer at one of our safehouses. Can you really trust that man that you're putting your life into?" A slender woman with blonde hair said.</p>
  <p>Lily sighed, "Lucretia, you know why. As much as we like to, it is just not possible right now."</p>
  <p>Lucretia Prewett née Black hissed in anger.</p>
  <p>"Lucretia, you know full and well the answer to that," said another woman, taking a seat near the Potters.</p>
  <p>"Its not like you can stand that old coot either, Cassiopeia," Lucretia snapped.</p>
  <p>Cassiopeia just rolled her eyes.</p>
  <p>"What do you say, Bella?" James turned to look at the dark-haired witch.</p>
  <p>"Its not a matter of thinking, we'd be fools to attract his attention this early. You know the man best, is there a reason why he's so focused on you?" Bellatrix crossed her feet, focused on James' answer.</p>
  <p>"There's been a prophecy…" James started to speak.</p>
  <p>"James," Lily urged when her husband was hesitant to go on.</p>
  <p>"You've never been into believing that hogwash before, why start now? Lucretia cut in.</p>
  <p>"Believe me, you will once you know," Lily mumbled.</p>
  <p>"Lilian, you believe it this?" Ignatius commented, he had after all occupied Lucretia to the Potter's cottage.</p>
  <p>"I do," the red head commented as she nudged James.</p>
  <p>"Albus believes this prophecy may hold some truth to it. He thinks Harrison is destined to defeat Voldemort…" James finally spoke.</p>
  <p>The three Black women looked taken back, even Ignatius.</p>
  <p>"He's not even one yet…" Cassiopeia looked lost.</p>
  <p>"That's not all," Lily replied.</p>
  <p>Bellatrix looked at her friend warily, "what else, Lils?"</p>
  <p>"Albus believes that HE knows as well. But its not like we can confirm that theory," Lily said.</p>
  <p>Bellatrix pursed her lips, "it's hard to say. Something of that importance, he won't be up for sharing. Though his behavior has appeared erratic at best."</p>
  <p>"So, he knows," James sighed.</p>
  <p>"Seems to be that way," Lucretia commented.</p>
  <p>"Promise me something, Cassie," Lily asked.</p>
  <p>Cassiopeia's dark eyes looked up, "what is that, Lils?"</p>
  <p>"If something happens to me or James. Take Harry in and raise him the way I would," Lily pleaded.</p>
  <p>"Lily…" Cassiopeia didn't know what to say.</p>
  <p>"Promise me," Lily begged.</p>
  <p>Cassiopeia nodded before changing the subject, "What about updates for the mission, Bella?"</p>
  <p>Bellatrix cursed under her breath, "under too much of an audience. And not even my relation will let me get close."</p>
  <p>Lucretia replied, "I'm not too surprised, we already knew about the protections to begin with. The manor they're staying at will not be helping us either."</p>
  <p>"Should I be knowing what's going on?" James asked.</p>
  <p>Cassiopeia shook her head, "best not to get involved, its quite lengthy at best. And hits our family at our core."</p>
  <p>James shrugged, letting the matter drop.</p>
  <p>"Have you considered changing Keepers, James?" Ignatius asked, slightly unnerved by Lily's words. Like her, he knew their lives could easily be cut short.</p>
  <p>"The thought has been on my mind, Iggy. And its already difficult to know who to trust given the current state of things," James sighed.</p>
  <p>Ignatius nodded, "Not to worry, James. It probably hasn't helped that Sirius is still on a mission."</p>
  <p>James frowned at the reminder but couldn't help the flash of worry for his best friend. Lily could only reassure him so many times.</p>
  <p>"Lose the look, Potter," Lucretia chided, "Siri is good at what he does. Plus, he would never danger himself to jeopardize his position as Godfather."</p>
  <p>"I wouldn't let it worry you so much," came a strong voice, obviously male.</p>
  <p>James turned to look in shock, "Father?! What are you doing here?"</p>
  <p>"To see my favorite grandchild of course, why else would I be here?" the elder man teased.</p>
  <p>James rolled his eyes.</p>
  <p>"Sirius is in good hands; I believe he is being occupied by Andromeda and Marius. Quite a pair, those two," Charlus replied.</p>
  <p>"I know, but I don't want him get recognized. I rather not increase the risk of THEM thinking he's keeper," James said.</p>
  <p>Charlus nodded, "understandable. I view Sirius as a son, though Walburga may not be as inclined with the death of her dear, Orion and Regulus. Now where is my grandson?"</p>
  <p>Lily chuckled at the fake affronted look upon her father-in-law's face.</p>
  <p>"Harrison is sleeping, but I say he may be awake in an hour or two," Lily commented.</p>
  <p>Charlus gave a big grin before taking a seat. "Now, what is this about Siri being on a mission?"</p>
  <p>"The Mentor has given him a target," Cassiopeia said as she took a sip from her tea.</p>
  <p>Charlus nodded, "I remember when Dorea had her own list, as did my great-grandfather.</p>
  <p>James looked shocked, "you never had it?"</p>
  <p>Charlus shook his head, "the Assassin blood has been known to skip Potters. Which is why it has skipped me and you, James. I have no doubt that little Harrison will be honored with the blood. He has Potter and Black blood that runs through his veins. Not to mention young Lily's blood, he will be quite strong."</p>
  <p>Lily looked thoughtful at that, "my father had it, though it skipped my sister. I believe as did my grandfather before passed last year."</p>
  <p>Charlus looked angry for a moment.</p>
  <p>"Dad?" James was worried.</p>
  <p>"Nothing of it, James. I remember the stories of Andrew Evans; he was a bloody good Assassin. Damn Templars…" Charlus cursed.</p>
  <p>Ignatius had a knowing look on his face.</p>
  <p>Lily looked fascinated to realize something about her family but chose to ask later. It didn't take long to be lost into the following conversations.</p>
  <p>"I would humor Albus for the time being, he can be a difficult man when he wishes to be. He is obviously putting belief into prophecies. They normally would be self-fulfilling, so it is not helping that Albus placing a stake in it," Charlus commented.</p>
  <p>"Surely they would be safer as a more secure safehouse," Ignatius cut in.</p>
  <p>Charlus nodded, "they would. And I would prefer for my son and his family to move safehouses. But this is already a difficult time and I don't want to have a desperate Albus on my hands or yours. It is best to just keep tabs on him; I wouldn't rule him out to being on the other side. Maybe not Voldemort's side, but he could be a silent supporter."</p>
  <p>"The Brotherhood has always viewed him as an imposing threat," Lucretia confirmed, "nobody is aware of how much."</p>
  <p>"The power has been going to his head. With his position within Wizengamot and as Headmaster… For now, he is being predictable, and nobody wants an unpredictable Dumbledore," Charlus spoke with ease.</p>
  <p>James frowned, "I don't like it, I feel we would be walking into a trap. Though he hasn't given us a reason to doubt him just yet."</p>
  <p>"Stay on your guard, both you and Lily," Ignatius warned. "We can't do much with Sirius gone, of course. I will speak to the Mentor about Sirius laying low. He will not be happy, but he will understand why."</p>
  <p>Bellatrix rolled her eyes, "Arcturus will just have to get over it."</p>
  <p>"Would you like to say that to his face," Lucretia goaded.</p>
  <p>Bella wisely kept silent at that.</p>
  <p>Lucretia snorted, "thought so."</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>"JAMES!" Lily screamed at her husband.</p>
  <p>"Go! Take Harry and run!" James yelled, wand firmly in his hand.</p>
  <p>Lily scooped up her precious son into her hands and rushed up to the second level. And not a moment later did she hear the front door blasted open. She only had a moment to send the distress call, she just hoped they would be here in time.</p>
  <p>Even though it would take precious time away from her, she had to do it. The risk was too great not to opposed to the choice of saving them some time. But she huffed in frustration when she realized that anti-apparation wards had been placed. Time would be the only thing she had now.</p>
  <p>It felt like time continued to stretch on as she double and triple checked on her hidden blade. It could save her and her sweet little Harrison's life. She brushed the little hair that Harry had, out of his eyes, softly singing him a lullaby.</p>
  <p>It was to calm her child as much as possible, and her somewhat. She could feel the fear coursing through her blood, anticipation on what was to come as well. She was going to go down in a fight if she had to. She had already set up the most powerful wards and blood magic she knew. It was a requirement as an Assassin, you never knew when it would come in handy.</p>
  <p>Lily didn't scream when the bedroom door was blasted open. Her heart felt heavy, knowing that James was likely dead, murdered by Voldemort.</p>
  <p>"Voldemort," she hissed.</p>
  <p>The Dark Lord didn't look surprised at her defiance, he had come across it more than once in the previous years. "Move witch and you need not to die."</p>
  <p>"Never," she growled. "Take me instead, but do not harm my child."</p>
  <p>"Move aside silly girl," Voldemort's patience was running thin. It was by her third plea that he lost all patience.</p>
  <p>It was obvious that Lily knew the moment that Voldemort was going to kill her. So, she took a chance. She knew that she probably wouldn't live to tell this day, but she had to try. She dived at Voldemort; her hidden blade unsheathed.</p>
  <p>There was a flash of green light and Lily laid dead on the bedroom floor, her blade dripping with blood.</p>
  <p>Voldemort didn't notice his new wound until after casting the killing curse at the infant. He suddenly collapsed to the ground, losing blood rapidly. He hadn't expected a purely muggle move from such an intelligent witch. It didn't matter that the killing curse had rebounded, he was already dying from both muggle and magical means. The rebounded killing curse sealed his fate, for now…</p>
  <p>But nobody knew how long the baby Harrison had been crying before he had been picked up by a man that looked to be a giant. He didn't stop fussing as the foreign hand was holding him. But it soon wore him out and fell asleep.</p>
  <p>Sirius was wearing a pair of dark robes, it either was a dark navy blue or black. They looked to be a bit old fashioned, maybe even traditional. They held a lot of pockets, even place holders for a muggle pistol. His hood was down against his back as he walked silently.</p>
  <p>"Hagrid, hand me Harrison. He's my Godson," Sirius' voice was almost quiet.</p>
  <p>"I'm sorry, Sirius. I have strict orders from Dumbledore," Hagrid's gruff voice said.</p>
  <p>Sirius had a look of shock pass over him and then it was gone. His lips were thinned as his eyes glanced around him.</p>
  <p>"Take my bike," Sirius decided, "I have something to do."</p>
  <p>"I knew you'd understand, Sirius," Hagrid said cheerfully.</p>
  <p>"I don't," Sirius growled, "but I'll be having words with Albus."</p>
  <p>Hagrid didn't know what to say to that, but Sirius didn't give him any chance to.</p>
  <p>The young Black stormed off; he had hoped some of the other Blacks would be here by now. He had lost track of how long the distress signal had gone off. That didn't mean he wasn't going to not enact his revenge. That rat would know better than double cross them.</p>
  <p>Sirius didn't care that there were people around as he found Peter, lurking around like the rat he was.</p>
  <p>Then was the cowardice yell, "you betrayed James and Lily! How dare you!"</p>
  <p>Sirius acted fast, if he had been using his instincts, he would have tried to blend in the shadows more. His hidden blade unsheathed and stabbed Peter through the chest.</p>
  <p>There were screams everywhere.</p>
  <p>"Bloody Merlin," Sirius cursed under his breath. He had forgotten about casting a glamour over the area and anti muggle charms. They were going to kill him… He quickly cast a glamour over the area before disapparating to a safehouse, the one he'd been staying at when the distress signal went off.</p>
  <p>Sirius felt Peter's neck and grinned in satisfaction when he didn't feel a pulse. He didn't care that he probably would get reprimanded. Though he ruffled his eyebrows in confusion. When he had disapparated, he felt something. He ribbed the chain that was around Peter's neck off and what laid in his hand made his blood go cold. It was the insignia that represented the Templar Order. Their suspicions had been confirmed, Voldemort's side were filled with Templars. So, not only was Peter on the Dark Lord's side, he was on the Templar's side.</p>
  <p>Sirius was then being choked and forced to the ground, a blade to his neck.</p>
  <p>"Tell me right now why I should kill you for compromising the Brotherhood," hissed a dark voice.</p>
  <p>The grip slacked to allow him to breath.</p>
  <p>Sirius' hand slid the silver chain into her hands. He breathed a sigh of relief when the blade retracted.</p>
  <p>"What you did was foolish, Sirius. You could have placed several Assassins in danger and revealed our presence to the world," Bellatrix's voice was harsh, but well deserving.</p>
  <p>"I know, I was rash with rage," Sirius admitted.</p>
  <p>"Yes, you were. The Mentor will not be pleased, but his ire will be eased with this information," Bellatrix confirmed.</p>
  <p>"James… and Lily—th—they're dead…" Sirius choked out.</p>
  <p>Bellatrix laid a comforting arm around her cousin's shoulder, "we have all felt their loss, Lily especially. She was one of our own… We have already placed oblivators to the muggles, they will not remember the incident. You are very lucky that we detected them first before the Ministry. Your punishment would have been <em>'harsh,</em>' Sirius."</p>
  <p>All Sirius could do was nod, he knew his actions had been foolish. It may take a while before Arcturus would trust him again.</p>
  <p>Bellatrix would then apparate Sirius back to the Brotherhood sanctuary. Marius was already back from his mission; she would leave him in his hands for now. She needed to get back to her sister.</p>
  <p>"Andromeda," Bellatrix breathed.</p>
  <p>"Sister," Andromeda's voice was soft.</p>
  <p>Cassiopeia walked down to the first level to meet the two witches. "This was found on Lily."</p>
  <p>Bellatrix could hear the heartbreak in her Aunt's voice. She watched as Cassiopeia rested Lily's arm guard with her hidden blade in Andromeda's hands.</p>
  <p>Andromeda had a tear that fell down her cheek, almost cradling the guard. She unsheathed the blade to find it coated in blood.</p>
  <p>"You don't think?" Andromeda started to ask.</p>
  <p>The other two witches looked deep in thought before Cassiopeia went back up to the second level. She needed to check this for herself, cursing herself along the way for arriving too late. She and Andromeda had arrived around the same time to find James motionless body. When she had gone upstairs, she found Lily but no Harry.</p>
  <p>Cassie went to look for Voldemort's dead body and to her surprise she noticed the wound immediately. She should have seen it immediately with all the blood, but she had been more concerned about Lily and little Harrison.</p>
  <p>Bellatrix's eyes went straight to Cassiopeia when she descended the steps once more. They widened when she gave a firm nod.</p>
  <p>"An Assassin up to the end," Cassiopeia's voice was soft.</p>
  <p>"What about Harrison?" Andromeda asked.</p>
  <p>Cassie shook her head, "I don't know, he wasn't here…"</p>
  <p>Bellatrix hissed in anger.</p>
  <p>"Bella?" Andromeda was caught off guard by her sister's behavior.</p>
  <p>"Traces of magical signatures, that oaf of a giant has been here," Bella growled.</p>
  <p>"Dumbledore," Cassie guessed.</p>
  <p>"We must act quickly," a new voice came.</p>
  <p>"Nati," Andromeda said relieved.</p>
  <p>"Andy, Cass, Bella, we must find where Harrison is. Lily would have been devastated to know we lost her only child," Ignatius replied.</p>
  <p>"We need to find Sirius, he's the best at tracking Magical trails," Lucretia said, hovering by her husband.</p>
  <p>"Then that is what we must do. Is Sirius back at his safehouse or elsewhere?" Ignatius asked.</p>
  <p>"He's with Marius," Bellatrix responded immediately.</p>
  <p>"Then we must go to the Sanctuary immediately," Ignatius said. He turned around to face his wife. "You must summon the others, to prepare two shrouds. I will see you soon, my love."</p>
  <p>Lucretia briefly kissed Ignatius' lips, "it will be done. I don't intend to allow their bodies to waste around to ash."</p>
  <p>Lucretia watched as her husband disapparated before summoning the other Assassins.</p>
  <p>While Lucretia was busy with the other Assassins, Ignatius apparated into their wards. As an Assassin, he was keyed into them, otherwise he would be tortured into insanity and eventually death. Assassins were if not wary and thorough when it came to their safehouses and sanctuaries.</p>
  <p>He rushed through the manor with a quickened pace, they had already lost precious time.</p>
  <p>"Igs," Marius greeted.</p>
  <p>"Good to see you, Mars, I need to borrow Sirius for a moment," Ignatius replied.</p>
  <p>Marius nodded, giving his approval. This was obviously a conversation not meant for his ears.</p>
  <p>"Iggy, what's wrong?" Sirius asked once out of hearing range.</p>
  <p>"We need a tracker and you're one of the best with magical signatures," Ignatius explained.</p>
  <p>Sirius frowned; he knew instantly what the wizard and assassin was getting at. "I've already tried, something is blocking the magic. The best I know is that he's still in the country."</p>
  <p>Ignatius started cursing under his breath. He knew exactly who was responsible for that.</p>
  <p>"I got him as far as Surrey, but he could be anywhere now," Sirius' voice was sad.</p>
  <p>"We won't stop looking, I promise you that, Sirius," Ignatius swore.</p>
  <p>"I know you won't, Iggy. And I won't either," Sirius said, his voice hard.</p>
  <p>Ignatius nodded, "Cri should have James and Lily's body with the others. They'll be preparing the shrouds."</p>
  <p>Sirius nodded, he wished he was there with them. But he didn't quite trust himself after his form of rage. And he didn't think Bellatrix would approve of him being there this soon. He just hoped that Arcturus wouldn't be too furious at him.</p>
  <p>They would never realize how many years it would be until they saw Harrison James Potter again.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Harry James Potter felt absolutely miserable. He didn't know what he did to deserve the life he was currently living in. He couldn't recall how many years he'd been living at the Dursleys. They had never even told him his birthday or age. And he already knew better than to dare ask any questions. He had learned his lesson the first time. He winced in reminder of the wounds that night, just thankful they had healed fast. He had never remembered being in so much pain and his 'precious' family left him bleeding on the floor. Yet Petunia had lectured him about getting blood on her precious carpet. Her grabbing him by his locks hadn't helped the pain he'd been in as he was tossed in the cupboard.</p>
  <p>And he was required to clean up the mess later that day and held the threat of punishment if it didn't meet their expectations. Which was set pretty high for a five-year-old. He didn't really think the Dursleys really knew what love and care meant if they didn't have their own son. But for some reason he was seen as an abomination. He couldn't count the amount of times he wished he was in Dudley's place and not where he stood right now. He knew his relatives hated him, but he didn't know why. And that fact hurt.</p>
  <p>For so many years he had wished that someone would rescue him from their clutches. But that day never happened. But that didn't mean that Harry didn't know how to evade their detection. He found it easy that he could blend in with some of the surroundings and his relatives never knew he was there. Though once they found him, he was punished for slacking off his chores.</p>
  <p>Harry didn't think chores was an appropriate term for the list that the Dursleys gave him. He felt like a prisoner in his own house. The list was practically impossible and got worse as he got older. And they seemed to love having excuses to punish him or withholding food from him. Petunia was especially fond of whacking him with her pans if he didn't dunk quick enough.</p>
  <p>His hands and arms were already littered with burn scars. It was around age seven, not that he would know, that Petunia decided to hold his hand to the burner when he had '<em>burnt'</em> the bacon. Because that's what it would feel like on her precious 'Dudder' tongue.</p>
  <p>Harry couldn't recount how long he had been crying as Dudley and Vernon just watched with glee in their eyes. And Petunia forced his hand to stay there as she was burning his hand. Then demanded for him to clean the kitchen, not caring that he had been crying or was hurt.</p>
  <p>Yet this was an everyday routine for him, and he hated it. He hated the Dursleys with a passion and wished they would drop dead. Maybe then he would escape the fear of punishment. He knew he was too skinny, but the Dursleys starved him anyways. They had even made excuses to the school that he didn't like to eat most times no matter how much they tried. Harry hated how the school believed them. And he didn't dare to try again to tell a teacher about his home life.</p>
  <p>Vernon had brought out his belt and Harry couldn't move for over a week. He had never told another teacher again and the one he had told had been fired. So, he tried to stay in the shadows, something he was good at. Even other students and teachers had difficultly locating him.</p>
  <p>Harry grinned when he found out about this talent of his, this was something he definitely was going to use to evade Dudley. Something he knew probably made the bigger boy annoyed and took out on other children in his place. Harry was just glad that this saved him from having another broken arm or leg that the Dursleys refused to let be treated.</p>
  <p>But he did learn that nobody would ever defend him, he had to do that on his own. And so, his hate for his relatives kept increasing as each year passed. And it wouldn't do any good to try to run away, he had already tried that, and he would find himself back in the same neighborhood he'd seen since as far as he could remember. He just couldn't figure out how that happened, it made no sense to him. But he just passed it off as some freak accident he could do, he had a lot of them. So many that he had lost count over the years. But Petunia had always called him a freak, which included the things he could do.</p>
  <p>The only thing that actually improved in his sad and lonely existing life was when the letter first came. It had been the only time he had ever seen fear in his Aunt and Uncle's eyes. And so, the punishments for anything 'freakish' increased tenfold. He had to resort to steal food out of the fridge, because half the time they didn't even feed him. And so far, his aunt and uncle hadn't noticed a thing, probably thought it was Dudley that was doing it.</p>
  <p>Then came the trip to the hotel and island. Harry truly believed that maybe his luck had turned around.</p>
  <p>He was a wizard. That was the reason why everything was happening to him. Vernon and Petunia had stopped associating with him, even to the point of them being afraid to order him around. Harry had been so thankful for small mercies. It seemed what Hagrid did to their son had terrified them. It made Harry wonder what other things could be done with magic. Not that Hagrid had been up for elaborating.</p>
  <p>Harry didn't know what to feel to learn the truth about his parents. All he had known was they died in a car crash. It was the only thing the Dursleys told him when he had asked. He had still been punished for asking though. And now it turned out that everything he had been told was a lie. He didn't know what to believe anymore.</p>
  <p>Apparently, he was famous for killing some dark wizard that was set on killing everyone. But as far as he knew, he didn't do anything. And he didn't dare ask anyone what the green flash in his dreams meant. The lesson of not asking questions was sticking firm. But he had learned about a world he had never imagined was out there.</p>
  <p>There was a school for learning magic?! And apparently, he was going to go, he did wonder what convinced his aunt and uncle of this. Did that man threaten them? But Harry knew just because they didn't dare to make him do anything right now, didn't mean that behavior would last forever. His luck didn't extend that far.</p>
  <p>Harry was still trying to process all the information he had been given. He had even started reading some of the books he bought in Diagon Alley. He wanted to know about this world, a world that apparently his parents grew up in. He just wished that he knew someone that knew his parents and not these lovestruck fans. Then there was the shocker at finding out his age. Hagrid had told him that once you hit eleven, you were sent your Hogwarts letter.</p>
  <p>That's when he reflected back to the conversation he had earlier that day. He had been in some clothing store to get his required robes. He had been alone in the shop with the seam mistress for several minutes before the door swung open. Harry had half expected for his instincts to be shouting at him like they had done in the bookshop. But… his instincts had been calm, almost relaxed. Where the blonde boy he met in the bookstore had reminded him way too much of Dudley and had a look of power lust in his eyes. He did not trust that boy.</p>
  <p>"Harry Potter, I presume," a dark-skinned boy commented.</p>
  <p>Harry had instantly become on guard.</p>
  <p>The boy had raised his hand in surrender, "I mean no offense. I saw your scar and figured I introduce myself. It can't be easy to navigate at your age."</p>
  <p>Harry untensed before giving a small smile, "sorry. Its just people keep wanting to shake my hand because of something I don't remember."</p>
  <p>"I'm not here to gawk. There had been rumors of you living in the muggle world. I hadn't believed it at first, myself."</p>
  <p>Harry nodded and revealed, "It is a bit of a shock…"</p>
  <p>"I'm Blaise Zabini. I'm here shopping with my mother," the Italian gestured to his mother standing to the side, speaking with the attendant.</p>
  <p>Harry gave a shy half wave.</p>
  <p>The beautiful woman smiled, waving before diving back into her conversation.</p>
  <p>"She's trying to get my traditional robes as well. Makes it easier since I'm getting my Hogwarts ones as well," Blaise explained.</p>
  <p>"Traditional?" Harry asked, confused.</p>
  <p>"Certain family names need specific robes. Most of them has to have my family crest on them. She usually has to get me robes for everyday wear and dress robes. I usually have to wear dress robes to special events and parties."</p>
  <p>Harry nodded; he got the concept quickly enough.</p>
  <p>"Do you know what house you want to be sorted into yet?" Blaise asked.</p>
  <p>Harry shook his head, not knowing what he meant by houses. But there were was no judgement in Blaise's eyes.</p>
  <p>"What do you know of the houses?" Blaise asked instead.</p>
  <p>"Nothing really," Harry mumbled, a little embarrassed.</p>
  <p>Blaise waved off his comment, "don't be so embarrassed about it. A lot of students don't know much about the houses unless you grew up with it. Which there's nothing wrong with that."</p>
  <p>Harry noticed that Blaise's last comment was said quickly. Like he was afraid he was going to offend him.</p>
  <p>"Well… there is Slytherin for cunning, sly, and ambition. Hufflepuff for loyalty and hard workers. Ravenclaw is known for their intelligence and being clever. Gryffindor is seen for their bravery and nerve. Most see them as brash sometimes," Blaise counted off.</p>
  <p>Harry looked intrigued; it was better than Hagrid saying that he would learn more about them at Hogwarts. He didn't know which house he would be in though.</p>
  <p>"I wouldn't be too worried what house you'll be in. They're all great, though there will be a lot of wizards and witches that'll look down on certain houses," Blaise warned.</p>
  <p>The conversation seemed to go on for least an hour before Harry could finally jump off the pedestal he'd been standing on. He really liked talking to Blaise and hoped that he would see him at Hogwarts. There was even a hope that they would both be in the same house.</p>
  <p>It would be after Harry had left to go back to the Dursleys, ignoring Hagrid's dark look towards his new friend, that Blaise would speak to his mother.</p>
  <p>"Mother, you need to let the Mentor know," Blaise said once in the privacy of their own home.</p>
  <p>Lady Zabini had looked shocked at what Blaise suggested. "Was that really…?"</p>
  <p>Blaise nodded.</p>
  <p>"I'll be back," she replied tartly.</p>
  <p>It didn't matter what branch of the Brotherhood you were part of, you still reported to one Mentor. And she needed to get hold of some very old friends of hers. It wasn't just the Mentor she wanted to speak with. She needed to speak with a particular wizard/assassin, Sirius Orion Black. It was wide knowledge that the man was the Godfather of Harry James Potter. But she had noticed that Dumbledore had been under fire by the public on why Lord Black didn't have custody of the Boy-Who-Lived. Hopefully this news would bring the man some comfort.</p>
