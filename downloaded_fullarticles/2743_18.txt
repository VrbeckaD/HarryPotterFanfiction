    <p>A thousand stories told, both true and make-believe, <br/> Ten thousand to redeem, the heroes’ lives to give, <br/> A plethora unknown, to pay a ransom-price, <br/> As images of One, in blood and sacrifice.</p>
<p>A captain’s crashing plane or choice to end a fight, <br/> A general’s surrender, clinging to the Light, <br/> A Chosen Boy who Lived who later chose to die, <br/> Smashed wand and shattered sword and siblings saved thereby.</p>
<p>A colonel’s stalwart stance despite a grievous wound, <br/> A half-elf’s risky quest where succor may be found, <br/> A prince and high-school boy give up the ones they love, <br/> A knight risks all, securing justice from above.</p>
<p>Three soldier bands who fight to buy their allies time, <br/> And vigilante groups who battle endless crime, <br/> A great detective falls and proves his burning heart, <br/> An agent, cynical, still bravely plays his part.</p>
<p>A lawyer’s final choice is of his deeds far best, <br/> A captain-general fights, though arrows pierce his breast, <br/> A wounded knight gives succor in true gallantry, <br/> And watchmakers risk much on faith and secrecy.  </p>
<p>A scientist dies well in noble suicide, <br/> A runner falls protecting him who changed his side, <br/> A father’s love believed that he could save his son, <br/> A Roguish band held on until the task was done.</p>
<p>A centaur brave expounds upon a noble death, <br/> A wizard buys one willingly with his last breath, <br/> A king, defeated, seeks the Enemy to slay, <br/> A hobbit and his gardener choose the weary way.</p>
<p>A rich man blithely takes the world’s mockery, <br/> Another cedes his all to set his city free, <br/> A third would give his life, despite his selfishness, <br/> The last, in desperate bargain, risks unending death.</p>
<p>A daughter took her father’s place in battle-strife, <br/> A Vulcan deemed his crew worth more than his own life, <br/> A king in exile tore his bonds to save his friend, <br/> And duty’s call and fire’s burning to the end. </p>
<p>Upon the Table blood is spent in traitor’s stead, <br/> A Ransom’s heel bleeds to crush the Un-Man’s head, <br/> Upon the Hill of Skulls One paid the utmost price,<br/> The Type they all reflect, in blood and sacrifice.</p>
