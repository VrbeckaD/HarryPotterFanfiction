    <p>The name Sameshima has always been respected. The heads of the family were usually women; tall, pale, black haired women who had yellow eyes. It made them look like oni especially as they wore yukatas made from the most expensive materials. The usual traits of the family was always dominant. No matter who they marry their children will always look like them.</p><p>The males married to the heads have no right to call themselves a Sameshima even if their marriage, as rare as it was, was done out of love. They were ordered by the elders to become a part of the family's traditional business, which was a dojo. The women who marry into the family had the same fate.</p><p>Males that were Sameshima by blood become the living blood of the Tendou Security Agency. They were an independent force that acts akin to private detectives and 'handymen' or people who do things others cannot. It ranges to mundane things such as painting a house in a unsafe area to full on capture of a minor villain.</p><p>Sameshima, literally meaning shark island, lived up to it's name. With borderline anger issues in the family, along with the existence of the dojo, it was almost obvious that the members would be bloodthirsty. Their desire to eliminate threats by any means also reminded people of real sharks when one manages to sniff out blood in the water.</p><p>Weakness was obviously not an option when born a Sameshima.</p><p>In terms of quirk, the elders always made sure to check the possible new family member of their abilities before accepting him or her. Weapon enhancement was their pride and power. Quirks that won't mix well with the family line will not be approved no matter how much the two loved each other. They'd rather have a quirkless person get into their family than adding something that might destroy their power.</p><p>The current head of the Sameshima was, unsurprisingly, another woman. She stood tall and thin, a red yukata with black smoke patterns wrapped her body and completely covering her deathly pale skin. She was known as Sameshima Shizuka, the seventh head of the clan.</p><p>In complete silence but of the night, Shizuka stabbed another syringe straight at her vein. She was obviously quite experienced with using medical equipment as she drew out blood. Her face was expressionless at that time but her eyes showed the disgust and rage being hidden within her slightly quivering form.</p><p>She pulled the syringe out as soon as she sw it was full. For a moment, she held up the injection to stare at the red liquid inside. She never knew how terrible blood can be. Within the blood were black particles, almost invisible to the human eyes, that moved around causing a powerful spell of sorts to the infected.</p><p>She sneered at the blood before throwing the entire syringe into the silent flames she conjured in the fireplace. Her face was openly showing her displeasure before smoothing out to her usual look.</p><p>"I... don't have much time", she whispered into the night through gritted teeth. Her yellow eyes almost glowing in the darkness as rage faded and hopelessness threatened to take over.</p><p>============</p><p>"Haruka-sama! Please come back, your mother will be displeased if you skip another lesson!" a female servant yelled out. Her short brown hair was frazzled as her wide caramel eyes darted left and right. One glance at her wristwatch told her that there were only ten minutes left of the young man's lesson.</p><p>She yelled out some more, her voice cracking at the thought of the head of house glaring down at her for her incompetence. The thought only made her cry. It also distracted her of the suspicious tree that she had just passed. The tree itself was unremarkable, but the black cloth peaking from above the branches was out of place. </p><p>Leaning his back on the bark with his legs crossed upon a large branch laid the missing teen. His pale skin and black hair indicating his roots but there was something different about this one boy.</p><p>His eyes were emerald green instead of yellow.</p><p>An adorable smile broke through his face but the look of mischief glinted behind his facade. He was clearly enjoying his time alone on the tree, the sound of other servants joining the one calling him like music to his ears. It was something he wasn't going to admit out loud.</p><p>After the frantic yells of his name faded, the boy twisted his form and dropped gracefully on the ground. His clothing looked a bit ruffled but besides that, there was no hair out of place.</p><p>"Haruka", the said male flinched at the familiar voice. He turned his head to his friend and bodyguard, Tendou Senri. He was tall and fairly muscled for a 16 year old. Haruka couldn't help but find the combination of Senri's dark purple hair, silver eyes, and tanned skin pleasing to his eyes. If only the male would smile a lot more.</p><p>"Your lesson would be over by the time we go back to the library but we can reach it in time for your history lessons", the other male drawled with one of his eyebrows raised as if to ask 'will you dare run away when I caught you?'.</p><p>Well, Haruka was a smart kid. He can already predict his failure if he tries to outrun Senri and he didn't want to have a repeat preformance of the 'Princess Incident'.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Sameshima Haruka, followed his friend towards the main house. At least his history teacher wasn't boring.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>"Very good, I can see that you've actually studied last night", that wasn't right. Haruka studied three days before that, he only ever cracks his lecture books during Saturday afterall.</p><p>"I see no reason for us to continue talking about the Revolution", the man wore the usual dress shirt and black slacks. Despite the expensive materials, his face looked old and a bit wrinkled for his age. 'Seems like Mr. Yamazaki has his hands full of Yukio again', Haruka only gave a small nod, 'then again, they did adopt a child just two months ago. Must be hard for them when they're both busybodies'.</p><p>"What do you plan on doing for High School?" Haruka nearly choked in shock before looking pained. "My relatives will probably let me continue my usual schedule" 'as if they'd let me out of this blasted mountain of a estate for something like school'. The thought only made the black haired male clench his hands.</p><p>Yamazaki only watched his student of ten years in pity. For all those years he had watched the boy gaze at the city visible from their usual study spot in the large balcony of the personal study room designated for the next head. At first he was hopeful, but after a confrontation with one of the elders he lost hope of ever stepping a foot in the city for purposes that was purely for himself. It was always business first.</p><p>He would make sure to mix his lessons with examples he could find in society. It made the boy smile but the light in his eyes were slowly fading away as years go by.</p><p>The thought about his student's lack of friends also worry him. The younger male was always surrounded by adults and when the time comes he wouldn't be able to join the rest of his generation. Alienated and confused, it would give the boy nothing but pain and loneliness. </p><p>Watching his student bow politely before heading off to his other lessons, Yamazaki decided to do something. If the elders only think about the family business then he was going to use his cunning to make them think that letting the boy out would be a good idea.</p><p>==============</p><p>Haruka softly chewed his meal. He couldn't taste the sauce, nor feel the crunch from his steamed vegetables. Only his previous table manner lessons prevented him from  standing up to sulk in his room.</p><p>Yamazaki meant well but surely someone as intelligent as he can see that he was not just an important heir, but also a hostage to his blood's responsibility.</p><p>Family is everything, and as cliche and corny it was, those three words were considered as the top of the family rules. It was a bit ironic with how much foul play takes place during family dinners.</p><p>Unknowing of the glances his mother was shooting him, Haruka could only sigh and smile bitterly. The green eyes that she despised so dark that it made her want to shiver. The usual childlike innocence was missing; not that any of the other people on the dinner table noticed. To them, there was no time for fooling dreams and whatnot. Their duty will always be for their family.</p><p>"Pass me the salt, Haruka", Akira, daughter of the 2nd branch family, demanded. The tone in her voice making Shizuka's blank visage contort in a chilly glare, ironically giving the vibes of cold ice instead of her fire as a secondary quirk.</p><p>Luckily for the 2nd head spawn, Masahito barked out his daughter's name in outrage. His glare and the deflated form of Akira promised punishment. If he didn't do anything then Shizuka might have just interfered.</p><p>Family is priority, but respect will be shown to those who deserved it.</p><p>There is a reason why the main family was chosen as the overall head of the clan and it was not for their glares.</p><p>Haruka on the meantime, merely nudged the salt towards the general direction of his cousin. The fact that he didn't give her a glance was sign enough that he was displeased with her. While Masahito was glad that the infamous temper of his family did not get triggered in the boy, one of the elders named Chifuyu showed her annoyance at the lack of reaction.</p><p>"Why, in my time it was common for us to throw a knife at such rudeness! If they die then it shall be. A weakling has no place where we swim", funny how shark island was even used as an example by the old lady.</p><p>Though the words made Akira cower Haruka only released a sigh. His eyes finally rose from the imaginary spot on his plate before addressing the people.</p><p>"Settle down, we are not children and the dinning table is not the place for such attitude", the way that the boy easily made the older men and women quiet should have been comical. Only, this very boy looked exactly like his great, great grandfather Edel. The only remarkable man out of three that lead the family.</p><p>Chifuyu could only grunt in annoyance. It seems like Haruka was going to be the Edel of his generation. She shouldn't be surprised with how quiet the boy was. Even the reports given to her about how the said boy skimps on his assignments were eerily similar to her grandfather.</p><p>With the tension gone, plates polished and dessert being served, Shizuka brought up the topic that she has been wondering about. Her question made people, even the servants waiting on them, to look at her in shock. The current head did not mind the others. It was her son that she focused her eyes on.</p><p>"Mother..." cue the slight hesitance at the use of her unofficial title that should have been saved for private dinners. "I'm not sure how to respond to that question".</p><p>She raised a fine eyebrow. "Haruka, I am merely asking if you find your current academic background adequate. It is very easy to answer such a question, afterall I cannot ask like how a mother would about how school was", the boy almost jolted out of his seat. Oh no. Did Yamazaki-sensei actually do something? He couldn't imagine his history teacher to go out of his way to walk quite some distance just to go to his mother's building.</p><p>'Is she angry?' he thought to himself. His eyes subtly scanned his mother for signs if she was displeased. Her fingers were relaxed, her lips weren't imitating thin lines, and he couldn't see the wrinkle that appears besides her eyes when she glares. He could only give a sigh of relief, one that he foolishly let the others hear.</p><p>Akira was immediately unabashed at her staring. Her wide grin obviously gives away her thoughts about how he was going to be humiliated in front of their family. She even had the gall to place both of her elbows on the table, something that they were greatly discouraged from doing.</p><p>Her father, Masahito was trying to block out their talks. He was the one that believed in immediate family business to be private matters.</p><p>Chifuyu watched like a hawk. Unlike Akira, she was discrete in her rare glances. Her eyes being the only one that moves to the young heir's direction.</p><p>Mamoru and Mami were both too young to understand anything. The twins were silently talking through their minor telepathic quirk as they playfully push the cherries around their plates.</p><p>Tsunako was politely listening in along with an elder woman named Yona. They were the kind ones and their berely noticeable squirms were akin to nervous grade schoolers. They silently wondered if they were going to have to interrupt the discussion. </p><p>Akito, another elder, along with his 3rd cousin which became his wife Kisana were looking at their dessert. They, along with Ranka were considered the most strict among the elders. Fortunately the latter's seat was empty as he had to visit their agency branch in Kyoto.</p><p>Lastly, Gin was smirking. While his smirk was a usual, the glint in his eyes promised pain and torture to the poor soul which was Haruka. He was the most cruel among them. Surprisingly, the father of the twins and the third family branch head.</p><p>Shizuka and her son were aware of the eyes. The former wanting to ease the strain her son had with the rest of the family, while the latter wanting to run up higher into the mountains to hide. Their lack of contact was making itself noticeable with how the two visibly tried, and falied, to read the other.</p><p>Finally, Haruka broke the silence with a quiet "huh?"</p><p>The woman smiled, or at least tried to. "Do I need to simplify what I just said?" Her pale fingers were now intertwined, her chin resting on them as her elbows supported her head. "I was curious if you find the idea of attending a high school agreeable".</p><p>If she was not from the main family, Shizuka would've let her emotions show on her face. Alas, threading shark infested waters was necessary and she was taught how to navigate at the age of four. The rest of the table occupants, except the elders, were showing either concern, annoyance, or displeasure at her words.</p><p>Her son, a jolt of pain could only flash through her heart, looked lost and confused. His lessons on masking his emotions did not work on his eyes. The emerald gems looked distrustful at her offer yet a flicker of hope was there. Has she been too hard on her son to the point that he looked severely conflicted at her acts of care?</p><p>'Don't lie', intones the voice in her head, 'you hate this boy. He ruined everything, his existence is-'. She released a sigh, irritated at the lack of response. The boy then decided to answer.</p><p>"I would be pleased to attend a high school instead of having private tutors. But if this displeases the family then I will reject", passive agressive. It was a good answer when faced with people who has an issue with him. The fact that he used the family card was enough for the elders and the others of higher age. His cousin, on the other hand, looked positively fuming at the show of favoritism.</p><p>'What does she expect? Haruka is my son', Shizuka made a mental note to have a talk with Masahito. It seems like the meek man's wife was trying to start something. 'If she thinks it would be easy to steal the inheritance then she has not read the history books of the family'.</p><p>The Sameshima head only hummed. Her eyes were tracing her son's features. Her eyes hardened when she noted that his face shape was that of the boy's father. The same fragile and innocent aura that clashes with their eyes.</p><p>"I want you to start making connections", Shizuka forced the other thoughts out of her head. A small gesture summoned one of the main house servants; the man carried a circular tray with a few papers to his lady before placing it on the table before bowing respectfully and moving away.</p><p>Shizuka shuffled through the papers before giving two to her son. On the top left was the logo of UA, a national leveled school that had one of the lowest acceptance rates.</p><p>Haruka then noted the paper was for his student info. Questions ranging from his quirk to his allergies were there. 'How in the world did this piece of paper fit all that? It must be a somebody's quirk'. There was also a box to tick to choose his course. He noted that UA seemed to be well-known for raising powerful heroes.</p><p>He then looked at the other paper, it was a student form for another national leveled school called True Cross. It was a bording school that was known for being the most expensive among the rest. They provide private rooms and research facilities to the students as they encourage support type quirks to get creative. 'They are also known for winning the best school ground award for years', Haruka additionally thought as he recalled a news anchor gushing at the huge rose gardens the school had.</p><p>"Are these my only choices?" Shizuka raised an eyebrow as her son asked her. The two schools she picked were chosen simply for the fact that they were known to be the best; UA for hero training, and True Cross for support class training. She mentally sighed, pushing the silver tray with other school papers for Haruka to choose from.</p><p>The boy picked up the papers gingerly. His eyes shining at what he read from their descriptions. There was World Academy, well known for their worldwide transfer students program to promote world peace by making the younger generation tolerable to other cultures. A school named Samezuka made him perk up, only to deflate at the words 'swimming powerhouse' at the description.</p><p>A school named AA was a bit like the World Academy but had much more character as they accept students from various backgrounds unlike the other which only accepts noble children.</p><p>There was also a school named Gekkoukan High School but, just like Zen Institute, it had no special programs nor courses. They were unique only for either the school council or the fancy interiors.</p><p>Academi High, Charm School, Makare Memorial High were promptly rejected for being suspicious, overly girly, and gloomy. Ouran was rejected when he read that there was a host club and so did St. Marie Academy as it focuses on pastry. Totsuki Academy also got rejected as he was not interested in cooking nor have the time to do so.</p><p>Varia sounded strange to him. The school form ending up as another rejected paper as the suspicion rose as he read about the school looking for quality. The promising students were going to be shipped to Italy anyway and he knows that the elders will not allow such a thing.</p><p>After separating the papers of the schools in half, Haruka then turned to look at his not-rejected pile. His paper habits making a few of the elders smile fondly.</p><p>UA is best for hero courses, True Cross for its positive backing when it comes to support type quirks, World Academy known as noble school, AA for the large student body and the various possible connections, and Logia Termina as the best school for independent research. They all have potential new connections that the family would approve of, and a student base that Haruka himself would approve of. They all had perks and he couldn't really decide, something that he voiced out.</p><p>"It is best to judge when you're there, is it not?" Shizuka's lips curled into a small smile. "UA is just in this city, we have no need to scout it as I've been there before and I certainly approve of it. A Academy is build in an artificial island near the coast of Mizuname. World Academy is located at Tokyo and so is Logia Termina", Shizuka then thought about the last school. Surprisingly, it was Gin that provided information on it.</p><p>"True Cross is somewhere near Kyoto. I do know that it's in the middle of a forest", the intimidating man's words carried the silent approval of the current family head's plan. One by one, the adults gave silent acceptance making Shizuka release a bigger smile.</p><p>Tsunako gave a sigh of relief at the peaceful outcome.</p><p>"Senri will be the one to give you your schedule. The visitations would be sudden but possible within this week. Be punctual to your combat and quirk lessons", that was the silent way of saying 'do not skip your lessons', but seeing as Haruka's secret desire to be out of the mountains got closer to becoming his reality he couldn't help but give a wholehearted agreement.</p><p>After years of deterioration, his hope of having a normal life gave a spark once again.</p>
