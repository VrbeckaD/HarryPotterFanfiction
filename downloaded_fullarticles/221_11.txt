  <strong>Chapter One</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>July 8th, 2015</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry laid awake in bed, clock showing the time was an hour to midnight. For eight days now, he'd been back at Privet Drive, and he was still waiting for Hedwig to return with his friends replies to his request to keep him updated.</p><p>For lack of anything better to do, he was catching up on his summer reading and assignments, an issue of <em> Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them </em>propped up on his pillow, blanket pulled over his head, a small, dim flashlight aimed at the pages and moving illustrations. With one hand, he turned the page; the other was currently holding a quill poised above a piece of parchment.</p><p>
  <em> "Werewolves are among the most savage and dangerous of all humanoid beasts, including vampires, giants, and Inferi, and as such are classified as "XXXXX" by decree of the Ministry of Magic."  </em>
</p><p>Harry smirked ironically as he read that passage. Remus Lupin, his former Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, was one of the most patient and calm people he knew, and was certainly a far cry from the "savage" description in his book.</p><p>Granted, Remus Lupin was the <em> only </em>werewolf he had ever met. But then, Harry supposed, if most werewolves were anything like his former teacher (and he had a suspicion they had to be) then his book really ought get updated.</p><p>With a sigh, he continued to read, adding his own opinions and comments on lycanthropy as he deemed necessary, as he knew Hagrid, his Care of Magical Creatures teacher, would probably be pleased to see that Harry harbored none of the animosity towards werewolves as he knew most of his classmates did.</p><p>
  <em> Tap tap tap. </em>
</p><p>Peeking out from under his blanket and quickly flicking his flashlight off, he silently crept across his room to unlock the window for Hedwig, who held a note in her beak and a package in her talons.</p><p>Harry smiled as Hedwig dropped the letter and package into his outstretched hands, nipping a finger affectionately when he reached out to pat her on the head. He quickly undid the twine around the box and saw a small cellphone within, and a note in Hermione's neat script.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Dear Harry, </em>
</p><p><em> We've been told that now, with the Tournament being over with and Death Eaters on the move, we should expect our owls to be intercepted, which is a very worrying thing to hear. So I went out with Mum and Dad a few days ago and convinced them to get some mobiles for myself, you, and Ron. I figured your aunt and uncle might not get you one, or if they found it by postage, they would confiscate it, so I sent it along with Hedwig. The Death Eaters most likely don't have mobiles, and I </em> highly <em> doubt they know how to use any phone that isn't the one that leads to an entrance to the Ministry, so I figure this is as good a "secretive" form of communication as any, right? </em></p><p>
  <em> I already put in mine and Ron's number, it's all set up and everything. The password is your birthday, 0731, but you can change it if you want. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Call me when you get the chance, and we'll try and catch up as much as we can! (Unless, of course, it's late, in which case please wait until morning, though Ron says you can call him whenever you'd like. I had to teach him how to use the phone, but he picked it up very quickly, and I've had some very interesting conversations with his dad and siblings about the various goings-on right now.) </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Love, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Hermione </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled to himself as he read Hermione's letter, turning the phone over in his hands. He could only imagine how enthusiastic and excited Mr. Weasley must have been to use a mobile for the first time, recalling the delight he had when Harry first showed him how to use a home phone. </p><p>Looking quickly between the letter from Ron and the mobile, he switched the phone on and waited for it to boot up as he opened Ron's note.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Harry </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Did you get that phone thing yet? Dad's gone nuts- Hemione and him talked until the battery died, and then we had to wait until Bill Floo'd in to remind us to plug it in so we could keep using it. Bit obvious in retrospect now, we wondered what the cord thing was for, Dad reckoned it was just a spare part at first. </em>
</p><p><em> Hermione says not to call til morning or late at night, probably so she can sleep or doesn't wake her folks or whatever. But call me as </em> soon <em> as you get this mate, I've </em> <em> loads </em> <em> to tell you. </em></p><p>
  <em> Ron  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked down at the phone, now fully loaded with a bright blue sky as a background, and quickly typed in <em> 0731, </em> as per Hermione's instructions. He found the app with a small phone icon fairly fast, and opened it to find two numbers already plugged into the <em> "contacts" </em>list.</p><p>With a small thrill of excitement, he dialed the number under Ron's name and waited, making sure the volume was down. The only other mobile he'd used was Aunt Petunia's, and even that was only ever once in a blue moon.</p><p>"H'llo? Wh- ... oh, <em> shit! </em> Hey Harry! Finally got the mobile thing?"</p><p>Harry smiled widely as he heard Ron's voice, nodding and then realized he couldn't see him.</p><p>"Yeah, I did. You, er, said you had loads to tell me? In your letter?"</p><p>Harry could hear shuffling on Ron's end, and a door cracking open as he replied.</p><p>"Yeah mate, shit's so fucking <em> crazy </em> right now, like you wouldn't <em> believe. </em>We're in this old, nasty cursed house-" </p><p>"Oi, who the <em> fuck </em>are you talking to at this hour?!"</p><p>Harry bit his lip to contain his laughter as he heard Fred's indignant voice at being woken. Ron, who Harry knew had a bit of a sore spot with the twins pretty much always, did what sounded like jumping on a bed several times as a response, if the creaking springs and muffled <em> thumps </em>were anything to go by.</p><p>"Oi yourself, Harry's on the phone. You want to talk to- hey, don't hit me, arse! I'll fuck you up!"</p><p>"With what skills, brother dearest?" George replied, sounding as if he was speaking into a pillow. (Which was probably very likely.)</p><p>Ron huffed, then sighed as the door creaked again and another hushed voice joined the fray.</p><p>"You numbskulls better keep it down, before Mum finds out and confiscates that thing."</p><p>"Hullo, Ginny." Harry said, feeling slightly awkward as he greeted her, seeing as he couldn't see her and had a few embarrassing moments with her in the past, though less so then he might've a few years ago.</p><p>"Harry says hello to you, Ginny." Ron sounded very exasperated and fed up with his siblings at this point.</p><p>"Oh, <em> Harry's </em> on the phone, Georgie and Ginerva sweetumsies. Well, Ronniekins, why didn't you just <em> say </em>so?"</p><p>"I've been trying!" Was Ron's response, but before he could continue the door opened once again and a familiar, mild voice Harry hadn't heard in over a year spoke.</p><p>"Now, what are you all doing up so late? Your mother told you all to go to sleep an hour ago."</p><p>"Professor Lupin!" Harry said in a hushed voice, mindful of the other occupants in the house, smiling widely.</p><p>"Hullo Lupin. Harry's on the phone, apparently. And Ron and the twins are fighting as usual." Ginny said as way of explanation.</p><p>"Ah, I see." came the amused reply from Lupin. "Well, put him on speaker, and wait for me to get Sirius. I imagine he'll be quite happy to hear from Harry too, and quite cross with us if we were to let him sleep the night away." And with that, the door opened and closed once more.</p><p>"Oi, how do we put this fucker on speaker again?" Ron asked, sounding as if he was waving the phone around his head.</p><p>"Press a button?" Ginny offered. </p><p>"Nah, just chuck it against the wall. That's  how Charlie turned it on, remember?" George said, sounding like he was only half joking.</p><p>Harry decided to pipe in before they turned the phone off, or worse.</p><p>"You have to press- okay, there's icons- those are little pictures on the screen, by the way- on the phone. And one of them will look… kinda like a sideways hat, with two backwards C's going away from it? <em> That's </em>what you want to press to put me on speaker, but make sure the volume's not too high, so we don't wake your mum."</p><p>"Cheers, mate." There was a faint <em> tap </em>and suddenly, Harry could hear the other occupants on the other end more clearly.</p><p>"Hello Harry." Ginny, Fred, and George chorused quietly.</p><p>"Hello," Harry said, leaning against the wall as he listened to his friends. "Ron said that there was a lot to tell me?"</p><p>"Yeah. Like… <em> loads. </em>Dumbledore has made a group to fight You-Know-Who, but he's made the group before, just with different people. Apparently, your parents were in it?"</p><p>He swallowed hard at that, recalling how, just over two weeks ago, he had talked to his parents in the graveyard.</p><p>The graveyard. Where Voldemort was resurrected. Where Wormtail lost his hand, where he, Harry, had been tortured under the Cruciatus…</p><p>He shook his head. Better to not think about that.</p><p>"Really? That's- cool." He said in what he hoped was confident tone. "Er… what's the group called?"</p><p>"The Order of the Phoenix." And <em> that </em>was Sirius, and if Harry was smiling before, it was nothing compared to now.</p><p>"Sirius!" </p><p>"Hey, kid. Remus told me you called, said something about Hermione sending a phone that fits in your pocket over?"</p><p>"A mobile, love." Lupin replied.</p><p>"Right, that. Anyways… how are you?"</p><p>"I'm… okay. Same as usual, pretty much. Privet Drive is really… boring. Only interesting thing that's happened this week is Dudley, my, er, cousin, tried to smuggle a box of donuts into his room by throwing the box through his open window, but ended up striking Aunt Petunia in the face with it. I'm pretty sure that's the closest she's ever come to grounding him."</p><p>Harry heard the others, even Lupin, laugh or giggle quietly at that, Sirius's barking laugh halfheartedly shushed by Lupin.</p><p>"Yeah, so that was fun to deal with… er, so… can you tell me more about the Order thing?"</p><p>"Harry-" Lupin began, sounding as if he didn't want him to know, but Sirius cut him off.</p><p>"Of course, kid. What d'you want to know?"</p><p>Harry thought for a minute, before asking, "What's this Order thing for? Why where my parents in it? Are <em> you </em>in it? What's being done to stop Voldemort, since the Minister is set on ignoring the fact that he's back? And-" he paused, now realizing something painfully obvious. "What are you and Lupin doing with the Weasley's? I thought Dumbledore told you to lie low at Lupin's."</p><p>Harry heard Sirius chuckle lowly. "Got 'em all out kid? Well, let's see… the Order of the Phoenix is a sort of… resistance group against Voldemort. Your parents were in it to fight against him. Remus and I were in it the first time around, and yes, we're in it again. And honestly, the Order is the best we can do against Voldemort, at least until he comes out of the woodwork in all his creepy, snakey glory. And Remus and I are with the Weasleys because we're in my old house…" At this, Sirius laughed, but it sounded bitter. "It's currently serving as the base for the Order, it's got wards and defenses like you wouldn't <em> believe. </em>But it's also filled to the brim with cursed and dark objects, so it's been a pain to try and make this place fit for human occupation when the very air you breathe is saying "fuck you! Die!""</p><p>Harry winced. True, he was fairly okay with doing most chores, but doing chores while everything tried to kill you sounded like it sucked.</p><p>"Sirius…" Ginny began sweetly, and Harry <em> knew </em>that tone. It was the same one she often used on her mother to worm her way out of trouble, or to get something she wanted. "Are you going to tell Harry about what the Order is currently doing, and who is in it?"</p><p>Harry heard Lupin begin to protest again, and, like before, Sirius cut him off.</p><p>"He has a right to know, Moony… he <em> fought </em> Voldemort just over a week ago. We can tell him <em> some </em>things, can't we?"</p><p>Lupin sighed. "... fair. Only <em> some </em>things, mind you. Molly would have both of our hides if she found out we told him everything."</p><p>"Great!" Sirius chirped, as the door opened again, and Harry distinctly heard all the Weasleys and Sirius  whisper <em> "shiiiiiiiit." </em>at the same time, in various levels of worry.</p><p>"Wotcher! We having a midnight party now?" </p><p>The new voice was unfamiliar to him. It was definitely a woman, but not one Harry had ever met before.</p><p>"Nymphadora." Lupin greeted the newcomer warmly, as the woman hissed "Don't <em> call </em> me <em> Nymphadora. </em> It's a fool's name, really. Any name would be better. Like… Hannah. Or Alex. Something nice, simple, not something out of a fifteenth century fantasy novel."</p><p>"Harry, this is Sirius's cousin, Nyphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname only."</p><p>"Oh, he finally got that mobile the Granger girl sent him? Nice." Nyphadora- Tonks, said.</p><p>"Anyway," Ginny cut in, probably before the conversation could derail further. "Harry wanted to know about the Order stuff, right Harry?"</p><p>"Er, yeah. Right." He said quickly. "You said the Order was working to oppose Voldemort? By doing… what?"</p><p>"We-ell…" Sirius began. "Getting people to join the fight against him, first off. It's hard to convince anyone that Lord Bitchface is back, but we've recruited my lovely cousin here, as you might have noticed, and lots of other people besides."</p><p>"Like..?"</p><p>"Hmmm… you know Dumbledore, Moony, and I are in it. Dumbledore has a brother, Aberforth, also joined. McGonagall too. Sprout, Flitwick, Moody, Molly and Arthur, Bill, Charlie, for whatever fucking reason Snape, greasy bastard-" Here, there were quiet murmers of consensus. "Sinestra, an old mate of mine and Moony's named Kingsley Shaklebolt, Amos-" </p><p>"Cedric's dad?" Harry cut in. He hadn't heard from the boy since he was rushed to the wizarding hospital, St. Mungo's, where he was in an intensive care unit for losing his leg to a near fatal curse, courtesy of Wormtail.</p><p>"Yeah." Sirius replied. "He and his wife, Beatrice, joined together as soon as Dumbledore offered."</p><p>"And… how's Cedric?" Harry asked, fearing the worst.</p><p>"Recovering." Lupin said quickly, picking up on the worried tone. "He woke up two days ago, asking for you, but the Minister refused to let anyone go to get you. He- his leg couldn't be salvaged, and he'll be in Mungo's for most of the month and possibly all summer, but I assure you Harry, he'll be okay."</p><p>"Oh…" Harry breathed a sigh of relief. "Thank Christ."</p><p>"Yeah." Lupin said, and the rest of the room was in agreement. </p><p>Sirius hummed, before continuing. "Let's see, who else is in the Order… oh! Mundungus Fletcher, he's a smuggler and seller of, er… less than desirable objects. Dumbledore has him and Jae Kim looking for "very old, and dark, valuables". He won't say what for, though… um, Tonks's mum, and my favorite cousin <em>ever- </em><b><em>ow!</em></b> The <em>hell </em>was that for?" Evidently, Tonks disagreed. </p><p>"She's not allowed to be your favorite cousin, not with her taste in baby names."</p><p>"Alright, alright, <em> fine. </em> " Sirius said. "Andy is my <em> second </em>favorite, happy?"</p><p>"Very." Was Tonks's smug reply. Lupin cleared his throat. </p><p>"Sorry, Moony, it's hard to stay on track.. I'll finish up. Andy- Andromeda and her husband, Ted, er, Cedric wants to join as soon as he's out, um…"</p><p>"-Tulip Karasu, Penny Haywood, Talbott Winger, Chiara Lobosca, Badeea Ali, and Diego Caplan." Tonks cut in, sounding proud. Sirius hummed in agreement. </p><p>"Yup… um, Hagrid, Daedalus Diggle, Emmeline Vance,  Hestia Jones, Elphias Doge, Amelia Bones, Augusta Longbottom, and Arabella Figg… er, did I get them all, Moony?"</p><p>"I believe so, love." Lupin replied, sounding faintly amused.</p><p>"That's… a lot of people." Harry said quietly, sitting down on his bed as Dudley and Uncle Vernon snored away in the other rooms, helping to hide his voice from his relatives further.</p><p>"And we're hoping to get more. Hell, we <em> need </em> more, even if they're not outright members, but spies on the inside, collecting information and intelligence, which is another thing we're trying to do. Shacklebolt, Winger, Tonks, Caplan, and Moody are all Aurors, and Kingsley is assigned to my case, since, y'know, I'm still on the run. So he's feeding them information, or rather, <em> mis </em>information on my whereabouts. Very handy. Lots of the members we have hold ministry jobs, so they come back with lists of important people and things to take note of."</p><p>"Like what?" Fred asked, seeming to poke Ginny in the side, if her squeak of laughter was anything to go by.</p><p>"Who's suspected of supporting Voldemort, who's in favor of Dumbledore, the type of objects they might be trying to smuggle to Voldemort, under the table dealings, blackmail and extortions, stuff like that." Lupin replied, the amusement gone from his voice, now replaced with weariness. "And I, along with Chiara Lobosca, are trying to sway the werewolves away from Voldemort."</p><p>"No <em> way </em> they support <em> him. </em>How can they?!" Harry cried, before remembering to keep his voice down. For one heart stopping moment, he thought he heard his uncle and cousin's snores cease, but then they started back up again, and he quietly sighed in relief. </p><p>"Er, sorry… I mean, <em> why </em> would they?" Harry began again, quieter. "Don't they realize that any offer Voldemort makes he <em> doesn't </em>intend to uphold?"</p><p>"You would think." Lupin replied curtly. "But unfortunately, you do have to remember that many of them have been ostracized and shunned by their fellow wizards. What Voldemort offers- unlimited prey, being seen as equal to the average wizard, promises of Wolfsbane to all that want it… those are offers they've never had before, and don't intend to refuse, in most cases. Some think it too good to be true, others are suspicious as to what Voldemort wants in exchange, but many more are seriously considering his offer."</p><p>"Oh…" Harry said quietly. "Um, Professor Lupin-" </p><p>"Just Remus or Lupin is fine Harry, seeing as I'm no longer your teacher." And Harry was relieved to hear the faint note of amusement back in Lupin's voice.</p><p>"Erm, okay… are you… safe, when you meet with the other werewolves, if they support Voldemort? They're not- mad at you for fighting against him or anything?"</p><p>"Don't worry about me, Harry. I promise I'm okay on my missions, I did this back in the first Order, so I know how to placate them if things start to get out of hand. Plus, I had a lot of practice as a teacher, you know."</p><p>On the other end, Harry heard Sirius grumble faintly, but it was drowned out by the sound of Ron asking him a question.</p><p>"If your mission is to convince the werewolves to stay away from You-Know-Who, what's everyone else's missions?"</p><p>Suddenly, the door opened- on Harry's end. Panicking, he threw the phone across the room into his half empty wardrobe, grateful for remembering to turn the volume down earlier.</p><p>"Just <em> what </em> do you think you're doing up at <em> this </em>hour, freak? Who are you talking to?"</p><p><em> Shit. </em> Aunt Petunia. He forgot she did her cleaning around this time, and must've finished up, only to hear him on the phone.</p><p>"Erm…" Harry scrambled to find an excuse. "I was… talking to Hedwig?" he offered sheepishly.</p><p>Aunt Petunia strolled into the room, a salmon colored dressing gown over her pajamas, stinking of cleaning fluid and flowery perfume.</p><p>"Hrmph… to your <em> owl? </em> At nearly <em> one </em>in the morning?" </p><p>"Erm…" Shit, he hadn't realized it was that late already. This could only end so well.</p><p>With anger and annoyance flashing in her eyes, she grabbed a half broken ruler off of Harry's desk, her other hand snatching his wrist roughly to keep him in place as he tried fruitlessly to squirm out of her grip, and smacked him square across the face, the sound echoing in the small room, along with Harry's quiet cry of pain.</p><p>"Go. To. <em> Sleep. </em>" Aunt Petunia hissed, dropping the ruler on the floor and slamming the door on her way out. Rubbing his cheek and wrist, anger rolling hot in his head and chest, he went to his bed, fully intent on hiding under his covers until morning, until he remembered his phone, and winced, rushing silently to the wardrobe and pulling it out, hiding under his covers with it clutched tightly in one hand.</p><p>"-rry? Harry! Kid, are you okay? What happened?! C'mon, answer! Blast..."</p><p>Feeling guilty now, along with anger towards Aunt Petunia for interrupting what had previously been a very good night for him, Harry took a few calming breaths before answering Sirius, even quieter than before.</p><p>"Sorry, erm… Aunt Petunia almost caught me on the phone. I had to hide it… I think I have to go now, before she <em> really </em> catches me…" Harry trailed off. He didn't <em> want </em>to end the call, but what choice did he have? If Aunt Petunia or Uncle Vernon found his phone, they'd snap it in half or burn it and probably lock him in his room for the reminder of the summer.</p><p>"Harry, love…" Lupin began gently, sounding almost… afraid? "Did… did your Aunt hurt you? Are you okay?" </p><p>For some reason, the thought of Lupin or Sirius or any of his friends finding out that the Dursleys did indeed hurt him caused a knot of anxiety in his chest, replacing the anger with nothing but cold fear. What would they say if they he told them? And besides, how bad was it <em> really? </em> Surely not <em> that </em>bad, not enough to warrant that tone of worry in Lupin's voice. Unwilling for his friends to view him as someone incapable of fighting his own battles, he quickly shook his head.</p><p>"Nah." He lied easily, the words leaving a bitter taste in his mouth. "Hedwig was playing with a rubber band, s'all." </p><p>"Alright…" Lupin replied, sounding dubious. </p><p>"Really." Harry continued. "She likes playing with things, you know how owls are."</p><p>From her place on his headboard, Hedwig gave him the stink eye. Harry looked at her apologetically. </p><p>"Okay, okay… we'll talk in the morning again, yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah." Then. "Profess- sorry, erm.. Lupin, do <em> you </em>have a phone?"</p><p>"I do," Lupin replied, as Tonks said "I do too!" "Would you like my number?"</p><p>"Yes, please." Harry held his phone slightly away from his face, opening up a new slot in the <em> "contacts" </em>list and typing in the name "Remus Lupin".</p><p>When he and Tonks had given Harry their numbers, with assurances that he could call either of them "anytime, for any reason at all." Harry felt slightly better.</p><p>"Thanks guys…" he let out a small yawn, rubbing what promised to be a black eye in the morning. "Goodnight, or, erm… good morning? I suppose? to you all…"</p><p>Harry received a round of goodnights and wishes of good sleep as he hung up the phone. He slid it into his secret loose floorboard, along with his book and half completed homework, already making plans to call later at the park or something similar.</p><p>Humming softly as he crawled back into bed, he fell into a deep, restful sleep for the first time since Voldemort came back.</p>
