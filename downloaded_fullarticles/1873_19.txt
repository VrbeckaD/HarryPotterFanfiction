    <p>A Figure, covered in the most midnight of skin, grinned at me with the most devilish of smiles, the kind of smile that warns of sharp teeth and chaotic Danger. "Welcome, my extremely lucky friend, you have been graciously accepted into a tournament of the likes only happens in imaginations as active as yours!" I sat, bewildered, as it approached my hand with what appeared to be a grey stopwatch. "You have two weeks. Now get as ready as you can be!" It said, dissapearing in an onyx flash, it's smile embedded into my mind. In it's place was a list, written clear as day on white paper placed on my floor. Th...This can't be real, right? As I checked the stopwatch in my hand, ticking down on a fourteen day timer. I stared in horror as I realized yes, I wasn't dreaming.</p><p> </p><p>  This Is A Story Idea I had in which 4 people from our normal world get 2 weeks to prepare for a tournament with a bracket made entirely of fictional characters, other than the 4. Here are the basic structure rules of the tournament.</p><p>  The people selected for the tournament are 4 people selected from a wide pool of people who have a strong connection to the world of fiction, in one way or another. They were all approached at the same time, but will not meet until after the first two weeks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Series Rules:</p><p> </p><p>These 4 people get exactly two weeks notice of the tournament, which can be spent to prepare in any way<br/>
After the two weeks are up, The participants are sent to the “Tourney World” in which they are given another two weeks, in which they have access to any mechanics the other fictional characters would have. The participants cannot die in the tourney world, apart from during a match.<br/>
There are also several facilities to suit the needs of all contestants, including gyms, labs, and forge/workshops. Any contestant may use these.<br/>
There is also a special facility called The Cash Shop, in which doing tasks for the shopkeeper will award you coins to purchase items from other worlds. These deeds are possible and open to any participant.<br/>
As a reward for winning/ placing the tournament, the top 4 participants will receive a wish that carries over into their world, the top 8 may keep any items or powers gained in the tournament. They all retain their memories.<br/>
Once the two weeks in the tourney world are over the matches start, with 3 matches going on a day. These matches are to the death, and someone must die for the match to end. Post match the loser is brought to life, and may continue to watch the rest of the tournament.<br/>
The amount of contestants per series varies heavily, but will always include the series protagonist. There is no requirement for said protagonist or other participants to be good or evil.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Series and Their Participants</p><p> </p><p>My Hero Academia/ BNHA: 26 participants, including 1A, Shinso, Aizawa, Allmight, Shigaraki, Dabi, and Toga.<br/>
JJBA: The First 5 parts Main Cast, each part will get their respective Joestar and 4 of the most combat oriented partners.<br/>
Percy Jackson And The Olympians: This not only includes the 7, it also includes The Kane Siblings and Magnus Chase with Crew as they are all from the same collective universe.<br/>
Overlord: This will include all floor guardians as well as Ainz himself.<br/>

</p><p> </p><p>These are the current series that I think have enough combat for this. I have several other Ideas, possibly HunterxHunter or Steven Universe. If you think any other series should be added or removed, please comment below. I am also heavily interested in co writers, editors, or really just anyone to help improve the concept. This is Currently all on a google Doc With Chapters and Character Descriptions in Progress. Dm me if interested! I am hoping for as much Feedback as Possible.</p>
