    <p>They're at a dinner party in the Black house. Remus might have felt out of place there some time ago, but after training with Orion, he's feeling pretty good.</p><p> </p><p>It might help that his confidence has grown about 100x since he started dominating Sirius. They're standing, talking to some purebloods just a few years older than themselves and Remus is particularly enjoying the thrum of magic linking him to Sirius's collar. It keeps Sirius as if on a leash, close, but a step behind Remus and to the right.</p><p> </p><p>With every minute movement of Remus's Sirius is compelled by the collar to move too. It's such a delicate, subtle domination over Sirius that it makes Remus long for a more secluded place to take his pup.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, he's remarkably contained, haven't seen Sirius act this proper at a party since he was 5." The lady of the couple says, while staring Sirius up and down. She reaches up a hand, like she's going to touch Sirius and Remus moves his right hand to block her, growling out, "Yes, remarkable indeed, but you've lost your chance, so I'd suggest you drop that hand. He might be contained, but I won't be very pleasant if someone tries to touch what is mine."</p><p> </p><p>He feels Sirius shiver behind his hand and smiles slightly, knowing his pup is hard, and aching and no one will ever suspect it, even if his formal robes weren't quite so good at hiding. In any case, Remus is glad they went with sort of standard formal robes, matching, because he can certainly use the room right now.</p><p> </p><p>The lady in front of them does seem to have a brain because she only flushes mildly and makes some excuse and then they're off sucking up the next higher-ranking Blacks'.</p><p> </p><p>Remus leans in close to Sirius and whispers, "didn't I tell you everyone would complement how well I've tamed you?" just to see Sirius have to clench his fists and close his eyes to maintain control. He'd have moaned right there if it hadn't attracted them the wrong kind of attention.</p><p> </p><p>It's soon after when they're called to be seated and when they all gather around the table, Remus sees Walburga frown as she seems to mentally count all the seats.</p><p> </p><p>Remus is quick to clear his throat and address Orion, since that's more proper and says, "I talked to the house elves earlier about not bringing a chair for Sirius, he's just so much more manageable if he's not given equal footing with those ... superior to him, you know?" with a smirk and a pointed look at to his right, where Sirius is still standing just a step back, controlled by the collar. "Don't want him to get any ideas. But a pillow might be nice since it's such a long affair."</p><p>Orion looks the two of them over, knowing every eye is on the of the dinner party and smiles slightly, before calling "Treacher!" and a young horrible looking house-elf appears. "Get Young Master Black a pillow for kneeling on." he commands, and the elf snaps his fingers and a red soft looking cushion appears in Remus's hand.</p><p> </p><p>Remus can tell as he relinquishes control of Sirius movements and spins to face him that Sirius hadn't realised that the title had meant Remus. He'd been used to it meaning himself and was now blushing and humiliated at the reminder that he was now nothing next to Remus, without title, without his own standing, only thing he was worth in a crowd like this was the honour of bearing Remus's heirs.</p><p> </p><p>It thrills them both and Remus doesn't prolong their torture of facing each other without being able to do anything, but drops the cushion next to his chair and then points Sirius to kneel there.</p><p> </p><p>He delights in the graceful way Sirius makes it to his knees and as he looks around, he gets to see the awed faces of people who'd never seen Sirius behave.</p><p> </p><p>The dinner passes, Remus growing ever harder, even with considerable self-control, as Sirius has to sit there quietly, while conversation mulls all around him, sometimes about him, but all Sirius gets to do was kneel perfectly and eat whenever Remus feeds him.</p><p> </p><p>At one point, Sirius seems to be close to growing bored and Remus knows a bored Sirius is never good. He closes off the conversation he’s a part of and concentrates on his magic, specifically the magic connected to Sirius's collar. He makes it thrum and vibrate and even shock a bit, currents very mild, mostly just to keep Sirius on his toes on what might happen.</p><p> </p><p>It works, as he can see Sirius's tense his neck and shoulders for half a minute before relaxing, gone into that lovely space of obeying, with that little reminder of who’s in charge.</p><p> </p><p>After probably two hours, the table’s finally cleared by the house-elves and the crowd invited to the sitting room for drinks and tea. Remus keeps Sirius kneeling with a small touch to his shoulder and makes eye-contact with Walburga as she exits and knows she’ll make sure no-one bothers them for a while in here.</p><p> </p><p>He waits until the doors close and then he turns his chair to face Sirius and gestures for Sirius to do the same, while still kneeling.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, I wasn’t very excited for these parties when I first learned that bonding with you meant I was now the new ‘Young Master Black’, but I got to say, I’m having <em>remarkable</em> fun tonight. I mean, I’ve been hard for most of the evening. Probably stained my robes at this point. Don’t you want to be a good pup for me, and make sure I don’t ruin them completely?”</p><p> </p><p>Remus sees the minute shiver that Sirius makes, and it just makes him harder and more desperate for something. If there's something he knows he's going to continue to hate about these things is the fact that he's here to uphold his image, so there's not much chance of just bowing out early or hiding in corners.</p><p> </p><p>He's just happy that Sirius's mother and father seem to be pleased with how he's taken Sirius in hand, and they're letting him have this moment. He knows they think he's disciplining Sirius. He smiles at that thought, as he reaches to push his robes out of the way. They would never guess how easy Sirius is when he has what he wants. When he gets to choke on Remus's cock once in a while, get fucking ploughed into the mattress, get showered in cum.</p><p> </p><p>They probably think Sirius is a greedy lover, but that's not it. He's so receptive, and yes, that means Remus often focuses on him, but in fact, Sirius would be content and pleased to just pleasure Remus. Probably forever. Remus isn't sure, he's never gone quite that far, but Sirius doesn't get to come often. There's the spells that came with the collar; that they ordered to have with the collar.</p><p> </p><p>Then there's the strange things about Sirius's anatomy. He really was meant for this role.</p><p> </p><p>Remus gets yanked out of his thoughts as Sirius takes down his cock in one glide. Warm heat surrounds him and then there come kitten licks with his tongue.</p><p> </p><p>"No teasing this time, pup. Your Alpha is wanted out there, so make this quick. Just gotta' get something, can't stand to be so hard around all those people."</p><p> </p><p>Remus knew he'd be in for it; giving Sirius those instructions. His pup knows exactly how to please him and is delighted to be asked.</p><p> </p><p>He almost doesn't get time to really enjoy it, it's over so fast, but he still makes note of Sirius's tense fingers, that are clawing at the robes surrounding them at the floor.</p><p> </p><p>He comes right after he sees, and it wipes his mind momentarily blank and then he hurries to get presentable again. He notices some of Sirius's hair is sticking out, he's gripped it, without conscious thought.</p><p> </p><p>He fixes that with a spell and sees Sirius shiver and then orders him to stand by his side and right behind again. The collar is set to that again and they walk into the party.</p><p> </p><p>It's like entering another world entirely and so he braces himself slightly and then he puts on an indulgent smile and walks them over to someone he hasn't talked to much.</p><p> </p><p>**</p><p> </p><p>He doesn't remember again before they're going home and he notices those tense fingers again when he reaches for Sirius's hand to side-along apperate to their own Black estate. He frowns at it, unsure of what is up and angry at himself for not giving them time in after the dinner to discuss it.</p><p> </p><p>He catches Sirius's eyes as they get ready and he feels more uneasy. Sirius looks just as when he's trying not to respond to taunts from Slytherins when he can't afford detention.  </p><p> </p><p>They appear on the grounds, just outside the protective wards, and Remus is glad to see that at the very least, Sirius does relax a little now that they're alone.</p><p> </p><p>He means to say their keyword for the scene to be over, but he stops, startled as Sirius drops to his knees, right as they're inside the wards. They're not even inside the house yet, but Sirius is on the ground, looking up at Remus, eyes frantic.</p><p> </p><p>"Please, Alpha, please, fuck me, take me, please, I can't take anymore."</p><p> </p><p>Remus is all kind of surprised, as he's been thinking over every way something could be wrong, to find out that his mate is ... horny?</p><p> </p><p>"Pup, this is getting to be a weird trend with you. Get me all worried that something is really wrong and then turns out, you're just horny and turned on? What kink did you discover tonight?"</p><p> </p><p>Remus intends to figure this out, but then, instead of answering, like the good boy he is, Sirius just sort of thrusts into the air; which, is sort of strange, because what has Sirius ever fucked with that little clitty, huh? Also, Remus hasn't seen him this desperate since the time he'd combined orgasm denial with leaving Sirius alone for a day or two.</p><p> </p><p>Which. Now Remus really stops and takes stock of the evening. He might have felt like they were there together, but really, it was Alpha and pet, Remus just conversing with the other guests and almost never addressing Sirius. He'd let the collar do most of their communication.</p><p> </p><p>He looks down to Sirius, who looks a second away from throwing his whole body at Remus's feet and it all falls into place.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius was probably turned on as hell by the implications that he was beneath all of them, that he was lesser than, but with every hour added, more and more doubt will have come teasing at the back of his head. More need. And Remus had done little to quench that need tonight.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, pup. I'm sorry. I forgot to take care of you, didn't I? Let’s get inside though, pup. I'm right here with you, but I want to take you to a bed now and pamper you, okay?"</p><p> </p><p>Sirius still looks desperate, but let’s himself be grabbed in a hold and apparated to their bedroom. There he spells the clothes off the both of them and summons the lube.</p><p> </p><p>This isn't the time for spells to help, but just them, Remus's fingers worshipping Sirius before he squeezes his cock into place and gives Sirius what he's been craving.</p><p> </p><p>"God, Padfoot, I'm sorry, just had so much fun riling you up, didn't realise I'd crossed the line."</p><p> </p><p>"Didn't, not completely Alpha. I would've... said something. Just, got hard, you didn't really, touch me. Like, it turned me on so much to have you display your control over me without it, but then it sort of got to be a bad thing too and that got all twisted up into good and bad and Alpha, I can't separate the good and the bad. Can you make it better, Alpha?"</p><p>Remus’s heart aches at the pleading tone of Sirius’ voice. “Of course, pup, always. I’ll make it all better. Come on now, pup, give me a kiss,” he says, leaning down to lick into Sirius’ mouth, pouring all his love into it. He feels Sirius melt under him, but he’s just as passion-filled in the kiss, giving as good as he’s getting, so clearly communicating how hungry he’d been for Remus. “We’ll talk it over before next time. We’ll fix it, so it won’t happen again. I swear.”</p><p>He keeps fucking, slow and steady, making love to Sirius, mapping his body out with fingers, kisses and licks. “All mine, gonna’ make you smell just like you should.”</p><p>He feels Sirius shake under him and he feels his heart crack a bit at the thought of how close he got to breaking Sirius.</p><p>It’s an unrushed but steady trip to orgasm and then he makes to get off of Sirius, but his mate whines, pitifully and hugs him close and mumbles out something about not wanting to part and Remus certainly isn’t going anywhere now. He just hopes he can get Sirius righted before they have to leave the house again. He tries not to berate himself too much, as he knows that tension is going to affect Sirius and that’s the last thing his pup needs right now.</p><p>They fall asleep like that, entwined and Remus whispering loving praise and assurances into Sirius’ skin.</p>
