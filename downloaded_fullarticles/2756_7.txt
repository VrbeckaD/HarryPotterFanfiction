    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p dir="ltr">The Hogwarts corridors were quiet as Alex raced down them with his dressing gown flying out behind him like a cape.</p><p dir="ltr">“Shit, shit, shit, shit” A constant stream of words of that variety were coming out of his mouth.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">The door to the library was large and creaked ever so slightly as Alex snuck in, breathing a sigh of relief having not bumped into Filch or Mrs. Norris. He could do without a detention. Alex walked quickly into the library determined to find the book he needed to complete his essay and get the hell out of there. His pace was quick as he found the aisle he needed and broke into a run as he knew it would be at the end of the shelves. He kept running, blind to his surroundings and only focused on that book until he ran into something solid but slightly soft.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">To say that Alex panicked would be an understatement. He didn’t even need to look up to know he’d been caught by Madame Pince and that he was going to get a weeks worth of detentions.</p><p><b> </b>“Careful there!” The voice was deeper than Madame Pince’s usually was. She must be suffering from a cold but surely she’d have visited Madame Pomfrey to get it sorted out, wouldn’t she? Alex slowly looked up, ready to accept whatever punishment that he was going to be given, into the calm steady eyes of Aaron Burr.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Alex knew Burr. Everyone knew Burr. He was considered ‘the pride of Slytherin House’. Burr was the same age as Alex. They’d both arrived and had both been sorted into Slytherin together. They’d never talked and Alex wasn’t sure Burr even knew who he was. After their first term, it was clear Burr was some sort of prodigy and had been moved up to the second year early. Burr was everything that made up a great Slytherin: pure blooded, sly, intelligent, cunning and everyone in the school knew who he was. He was considered an almost celebrity in the common room.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Alex, however, was not.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr"><em>His parents were muggles, both teenagers when Alex had been born. James Hamilton, his father, had been the heir to a massive fortune and had been encouraged to leave Rachel Faucette, but he initially refused </em>causing<em> him to be disowned by his family. Rachel herself had run away from home and had been hiding in the garden shed (which happened to be the size of a small house) on the grounds of the large Hamilton estate while James tried to negotiate with his parents. In the end, James stole some money from his father and the young couple had run off together. They’d managed to buy a tiny two-roomed flat. ‘Tiny’ was an understatement. The single bed the couple shared took up about half of the room while their kitchen took up the rest. The bathroom had been even smaller.</em></p><p>
  <em> <b> </b> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The local hospital was constantly full of people being rushed in having overdosed on drugs or who had been hit by a car whilst drunk. It was there that Alexander Hamilton had been born. Both James and Rachel had no qualifications having left school to run away and therefore could not get any decent paying jobs. James worked in a factory that packed fish into cans, while Rachel worked at the local corner store. Alex had grown up on nothing.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b> </b> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The year that Alex turned 3 his father had left. James had grown tired of living in near-poverty. He had made his distaste for his surrounding extremely clear. Growing up in a mansion had given him little taste for the smaller things in life and returned home to his family and significant fortune. Rachel had become depressed. At only 19 years old she was alone with a child who she could barely afford to feed. She worked four different jobs and trying to make ends meant leaving Alex with the woman who lived in the flat next door. The summer before Alex was due to start school she had become sick.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b> </b> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>She had died before the first leaves of autumn fell.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b> </b> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Alex had been put into an orphanage and had grown up all alone, never really interacting with the other kids. The day Professor McGonagall had arrived with his letter had been the best day of his life.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b> </b> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">But being a muggleborn in Slytherin house was incredibly isolating. No one really talked to him and Alex didn’t really talk to anyone else. He didn’t exactly feel lonely. He read a lot and wrote a lot to pass the time. However, in the midst of his reading about the formation of the Magical Congress of the United States of America’s stance on the revolutionary war, he’d forgotten to complete the transfiguration homework set by Professor Coranta. Coranta was a stickler for deadlines and Alex had missed so many in the past he was walking on thin ice towards a terms worth of detentions. Burr looked down at Alex with an amused smile on his face.</p><p>“Well hello.” He spoke quietly as so to not alert Filtch of his presence. “I didn’t really expect to see anyone at this time in the morning.” Alex grinned.</p><p><b> </b>“Well I’ve got a foot long essay to write on the principles of Re-materialisation due with Coranta tomorrow morning and I got a bit preoccupied.” Burr laughed.</p><p><b> </b>“I remember doing that essay last year. Coranta was a nightmare when it came to marking it. I think I only got an Acceptable instead of outstanding.” Alex rolled his eyes.</p><p><b> </b>“Only an acceptable?” Burr chuckled. “Anyway is best get started on it. Any book recommendations?” Burr glanced at the large grandfather clock on the wall. It was 1am.</p><p><b> </b>“You know what? Why don’t I just help you? I’m not going to be able to sleep for another few hours at least. I had a coffee at dinner and it’s so well brewed here, I have no idea how the house-elves do it. I swear I have an addiction, and it’s half-messed up my sleep schedule, but like ‘Sleep Less, Work More’, right?”</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Alex was bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet ever so slightly. It took all his willpower to stop himself from interrupting Burr. He didn’t need help particularly, but having another person involved might speed up the process and he could return to his warm bed in the dungeons. He gave a quick nod, pulled his parchment, quill and as well as his inkpot out of his dressing gown pocket, and he and Burr got to work.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">***</p><p dir="ltr">“BURR!” Alex was woken by the library door banging open. His eyes were bleary as he looked around. He and Burr must have fallen asleep as soon as he’d finished his essay. Alex has only meant to rest his head for a second, but now looking at the clock he realised the if they didn’t get out of there soon they were going to be caught by Madam Pince.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">He suddenly became of the three people in the doorway.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">All three were male but that seemed to be the only similarity they shared. On the left, there was a guy who was a head taller than the others. He was massive. His biceps were as big as Alex’s head and his shoulders were large and broad. He would have looked intimidating had he not been wearing almost fluorescent orange Chudley Cannons pyjamas with what appeared to be a bright pink beanie. He was leaning against the door and appeared tired as if he’d been dragged out of bed too early.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">On the right was a man who’s hair showed the telltale signs of being in a ponytail all day (Alex would know) as his hair- which was incredibly poofy- naturally moved in before poofing back out madly. It hung around his face like a giant cloud. He was clearly muttering under his breath but Alex couldn’t hear from his place at the table.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">In the middle, there was a guy with the biggest grin on his face. His hair was pulled back into a ponytail in the nape of his neck. It was extremely curly creating an almost brown bunny tail from the back of his head. Random hairs had curled out of the ponytail and stuck out randomly, causing his hair to appear frizzy. However, it also appeared soft and fluffy. Across his skin was a splattering of freckles. They crossed his nose and his forehead like tiny stars, and they dotted his arms like golden specks against his warm skin. His eyes were a golden hazel and were alive and full of joy.</p><p><b> </b>“This is the fourth time this week you’ve fallen asleep in the library Burr.” The laughing guy was saying. “Breaking into the library isn’t as fun as breaking into the Slytherin common room.” He then seemed to only just notice Alex. “What’s this? Does Burr have… a friend?” Alex shook his head.</p><p><b> </b>“Burr was just helping me with a rather last minute essay for Coranta.” The man’s eyes creased in laughter.</p><p><b> </b>“Burr not being a selfish git? Please. Now tell me how helpful was he?” Alex glanced at Burr at his side.</p><p><b> </b>“Well…” He said sarcastically causing all three to chuckle. ‘Muscle-man’ spoke for the first time since entering the room.</p><p><b> </b>“Burr are you not going to introduce us to your not-friend? That’s extremely rude, I know Slytherin isn’t big on courtesy but still...“ Burr gave out a massive sigh.</p><p><b> </b>“Alexander these are the people who’ve made it their lifelong duty to torment me. They’re also known as John Laurens,” he pointed to the guy in the middle, “Hercules Mulligan,” he pointed to the left “and Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier de Lafayette” he pointed to the right.</p><p><b> </b>“Please, <em>ami</em>.” Gilbert de Motier smiled at him “Call me Lafayette.”</p><p><b> </b>“<em>Vous êtes français?</em>” Alex asked smiling. He hadn’t met anybody who spoke French since he was put into a foster home for 6 months with an old lady who only spoke the language. He’d quickly picked up the language and had carried on learning it long after the lady had died, which caused Alex to be shoved back into his group home.</p><p><b> </b>“<em>Oui c'est ma langue maternelle.</em>” Lafayette smiled at him. “<em>Tu parles bien. Où as-tu appris?</em>” Alex shook his head.</p><p><b> </b>“Unimportant.” Lafayette grinned. John quickly cut in.</p><p><b> </b>“So Alexander any not-friend of Burr’s is a friend of mine so walk me back to your common room? You’re a Slytherin, right? I’ve got a bone to pick with that 4th year George Eaker.” Alex looked at him in astonishment as John grabbed him by the arms and pulled him along in the direction of the dungeons leaving Burr, Lafayette, and Mulligan in the library.</p><p><b> </b>“How the hell did you know I’m a Slytherin? Nobody’s told you that.” John winked at him</p><p><b> </b>“What can I say Alex? I’m a human sorting hat.” Alex burst out laughing.</p><p><b> </b>“Okay, my turn. Hmmm, let me guess? Brash, insane and extremely confident for 5 in the morning. Gryffindor.” John clicked his fingers and pointed two finger guns at him.</p><p><b> </b>“The boy's a genius! A Ravenclaw through and through! Oh no, I guess I was wrong in my prediction.” He held his hand over his head in mock horror causing Alex to burst out in peals of laughter.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">They finally reached the entrance to the Slytherin common room. Alex gave the password and both boys stepped into the room. It was completely empty, everyone still asleep in their dorms.</p><p><b> </b>“It was nice meeting you, Alexander.” John smiled at him. Alex nodded in return.</p><p><b> </b>“You too John.” He then turned and walked up the stairs to his dormitory.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">***</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">John Laurens was exhausted. Running around Hogwarts in the early hours of the morning after staying up late doing homework by the fire did that to you, but he enjoyed wandering the castle. It was large and ever-changing; there were rooms even he after being there for seven years hasn’t found. James Potter appeared suddenly and sat down next to him with a sigh.</p><p><b> </b>“That sister of mine honestly,” James sighed, “Lily has got it into her head that Albus and I are having a massive fight, we’re not by the way, and is trying to get us to resolve conflict that hasn’t even happened.” John laughed.</p><p><b> </b>“Ah, the problems of the Potter family. The father defeats the darkest wizard of all time, the mother is the best chaser for the Holyhead Harpies in a century, the middle child is kidnapped by said dark wizards daughter and James Potter is being tormented by his thirteen-year-old sister.” James elbowed him in the side.</p><p><b> </b>“You’re no help, John.” John winked at him.</p><p><b> </b>“I try. Pass the syrup will you?” James groaned and passed him the syrup which John proceeded to drown the waffles on his plate in. Hogwarts breakfasts were possibly John’s favourite meal of all time. The house elves in the kitchens made every dish you could possibly imagine: bacon, waffles, pancakes, crumpets, toast, etc. The list went on. The Gryffindor Table was easily the loudest out of the four house tables and this morning was no exception.</p><p><b> </b>“<em>Bonjour mes amies.</em>” Lafayette threw himself onto the bench, reaching and successfully grabbing a piece of toast from John’s plate in one flourish.</p><p><b> </b>“I was going to eat that you know.” John rolled his eyes attempting to grab the slice back from Laf, who immediately stuffed the full slice into his mouth winking at John mischievously. “I should tell McGonagall to send you back to Beauxbatons.”  Laf gasped in mock horror.</p><p><b> </b>“But you’d miss me too much <em>mon ami</em>” John laughed.</p><p><b> </b>“I miss my toast more.” Laf faked shock in an overly dramatic manner, nearly knocking some poor first year Ravenclaw’s book out of her hands as she walked past. John sniggered.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">They were suddenly interrupted by a flurry of dark curls sitting down onto the bench next to them. John smiled broadly.</p><p><b> </b>“Well if it isn’t my favourite youngest Schuyler sister!” She grinned at him.</p><p><b> </b>“Morning John, Laf, James.” Her eyes glanced up and down the table and then she raised her head to scan the Hufflepuff table. “Where’s Herc?”</p><p><b> </b>“Do not worry <em>cherie</em>, your prince will be here soon.” Laf joked gleefully. She rolled her eyes.</p><p><b> </b>“He’s not my prince. He said he was going to show me the robes he was working on and I plan to hold him to that promise.”</p><p><b> </b>“Of course! The robes! That is definitely what you two get up to all alone in the Hufflepuff dormitory.” John said sarcastically, which earned him a punch in the arm from Peggy.</p><p><b> </b>“You two are the worst honestly. Now don’t think I didn’t catch you both climbing through the portrait hole this morning. Where did you need to go in the early hours of the morning that couldn’t wait until after breakfast?” John winked at her.</p><p><b> </b>“Nowhere that should trouble a young princess such as yourself.” Peggy punched him lightly on the arm again.</p><p><b> </b>“I’m not a princess John.” John feigned shock.</p><p><b> </b>“You’re not? The Schuyler family isn’t wizarding royalty? Queen Catherine and King Philip with their three daughters? The Princesses Angelica, Elizabeth and alcoholic muggle beverage?” Peggy punched his arm jokingly once more before turning to James.</p><p><b> </b>“So James how are you and Leah? I heard that you took her on a date to Hogsmeade the other day.” James was dating Leah Jordan and they were possibly the most sickly sweet couple in the year being beaten out by Louis Weasley and Kyla Doux. Leah was a Ravenclaw, but she and James had been prefects together and had gotten close during patrols. Now she was head girl and James was head boy. Some of the older teachers said that they reminded them of the original James Potter and Lily Evans, who were head boy and girl during their time at Hogwarts as well.</p><p><b> </b>James nodded. “Yeah, we visited Madam Puddifoot’s. It was nice but then, of course, we bumped into Teddy in the street, which got me into a whole load of teasing from him and then from mum in her letter the next day.” John chuckled lightly.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">His mind kept being drawn back to the mysterious stranger he met in the library in the early hours of this morning. He barely knew the guy but hey he knew he wanted to be his friend. His energy was infectious: the way he spoke so eloquently with perfect emphasis on each word, and the casual way he bantered with him.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">He scanned the Slytherin table for him having to do a few swoops of the table before finding him. Alexander was smaller than most boys his age, which made him hard to notice when he wasn’t talking. Alex was sat by himself while people sat in groups around him. He had a book propped up against a jug of pumpkin juice and was hurriedly writing with one hand while eating a single slice of toast with the other. He was non-stop John thought to himself, amused at the boys work ethic.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Then the post arrived. Thousands of owls swooping into the hall packages clutched in their talons swooping around trying to find their owners. John watched Alex glance up at the post not missing the flash of hope that crossed his faces before being replaced with resignation. Alex obviously never got letters or packages from home and yet he was still hopeful of receiving one. It broke John’s heart. An idea crossed his mind and he quickly grabbed a quill and parchment from his bag and scribbled a quick note signing it with a rather mysterious ‘your friend, J’. He then rolled up the parchment and after removing a letter from his owl, Frances, he attached it to her leg. She flew off back into the sea of owls above before swooping down and depositing the letter right into Alexander’s lap.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">The look of surprise on his face was could probably have made John Lauren’s top 10 people’s faces of all time. He watched as Alexander opened the letter and smiled to himself as he saw a smile grow on Alexander’s face. Alexander then pulled out his own piece of parchment and began writing.</p><p><b> </b>“JOHN!” Peggy clicked her fingers in his face. “Who were you staring at at the Slytherin table? Was it Henry Knox? I bet it was Henry Knox.” John rolled his eyes.</p><p><b> </b>“God no Schuyler. I have standards.” Peggy grinned at him and winked.</p><p><b> </b>“Anyway James was saying that Laf’s new broom couldn’t beat his Cleansweep so they’re going to test it on the Quidditch pitch later. You in?” John nodded.</p><p><b> </b>“Yeah, yeah that seems cool.” He was still watching Alex furiously scribbling away at the piece of parchment in front of him. Alex quickly finished writing with a flourish and attached it to Frances’ leg. He had a mischievous glint in his eye and he allowed the tiny barn owl to join the now dwindling number of owls flying above. It was only then John realised what his plan was. He got up quickly and left the hall, ignoring the shouts of his friends behind him.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Frances caught up to him just as he reached the main stairwell. She perched on his shoulder as he walked up to the common room.</p><p><b> </b>“Beechroot.” he gave the password to the fat lady and entered the empty common room- everyone was still at breakfast. He settled into an armchair before unrolling the letter.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Dear ‘J’,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b> </b> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>I must admit that I was surprised to get your letter. It’s not often that someone writes to me. However, I have discovered a major flaw in your secrecy plan. Your owl is very easily distinguishable from the others due to her small size. She is a lovely owl though. A barn owl right? I’ve never seen feathers like hers. Almost like tortoiseshell. However, her easy distinguishability makes her easy to follow in the crowd of owls. So now I’m sending this letter away to see who your owl (I’m assuming she’s yours. Also what is her name?) delivers this letter to.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b> </b> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>A.Ham</em>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">John grinned and took another piece of parchment and began writing another letter...</p><p> </p>
