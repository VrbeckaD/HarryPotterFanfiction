    <p>In all her years of teaching at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, this was the first time that Professor Minerva McGonagall had to deal with such a situation. It was slowly bringing her a headache, which in itself was a wonder after the troubles of the recent years that escalated in the Battle of Hogwarts that ended the Second Wizarding War. Perhaps it was all because this was really sudden...</p>
<p>With a deep sigh, the aging witch sat at the headmaster desk and looked down at the elegantly written parchment held in her hands as if it could give her all the answers of the world. "Are you sure of this?"</p>
<p>Kingsley Shacklebolt, the new Minister for Magic, stood in front of her with a troubled expression of his own. "We are sure," he replied, glancing around the room to see how every single portrait had their eyes trained on them, silent and attentive. "The poor girl has no safe place to go and the American Ministry of Magic has no idea why the Dementors are so much after her."</p>
<p>Minerva finally placed the parchment on the desk and rubbed her forehead with one hand, trying to alleviate the increasing pressure. "And they thought that Hogwarts was the safest place for her to be. Especially after the recent events..." she said with an understanding nod.</p>
<p>The man standing in front of her gave a small smile. "Can't blame them," he said, referring to the American Ministry of Magic. "The kid got attacked eleven times in the last two weeks, several people nearly died by the Dementors' attacks and one nearly got the Kiss. As much as they try to protect her, the load is too much even for Salem's security..."</p>
<p>The headmistress drummed her fingers on the desk and let her thoughts wander for several long seconds. Taking the girl into Hogwarts would put the entire school in danger – <em>again</em><em> – </em>but the idea of leaving an innocent, young witch at the mercy of one of the foulest creatures of the wizarding world made her insides twist in disgust.</p>
<p>"We're already three weeks into the school terms," she said after a while, finally taking her decision. "But sorting her in a house won't be a problem."</p>
<p>The Minister for Magic gave a smile of appreciation as he handed a few more parchments to Minerva. "I must warn you, though. The girl comes from Amity Park..." he took a pause and watched the witch's reaction for a moment. "You know what the wizardry community thinks of that place..."</p>
<p>Sharp eyes narrowed and Minerva resisted the urge to groan. "Amity Park..." she said slowly, rolling the city's name on her tongue, as if tasting the words. "Wizards and witches avoid that place at all costs... something about the place being full of uncontrolled environmental magic and being haunted by several highly destructive poltergeists..."</p>
<p>And she cut there because she was not going to delve into the rumor of the city disappearing altogether into thin air, dragged away from the world by some powerful poltergeist with the obsession of conquering the world...</p>
<p>"That city," Kingsley confirmed with a curt nod just before giving a deep sigh of his own. "And that is why everyone was surprised and not surprised at the same time to discover that she was a witch despite being already fifteen years old."</p>
<p>The headmistress raised an eyebrow at that and silently motioned for the man to go on while she idly browsed the parchments in front of her, quickly scanning everything that the American Ministry had found regarding the matter. It wasn't much, but it was better than having nothing to work with...</p>
<p>"Even if they detect magically endowed kids, no one sends owls over there. They just get lost or don't even dare to go near it. She would have been ignored altogether if it wasn't for the fact that they found her curled in front of the steps of Salem Witches' Institute, muttering incoherently about big, flying ghosts wearing black cloaks that brought cold and unhappiness when they got close," Shacklebolt was now waving a hand into the air as he got a little deeper into the story. "Took her three days to recover back to normality, but even then she could not recall what had happened to her, nor her own past save for a few personal details like her name, age and where she lived."</p>
<p>Minerva folded the parchments and neatly stacked them in front of her, planning to carefully read them later when she was alone. "A memory charm?" she asked that more to herself than to the man in front of her. Attacked by Dementors and Obliviated so much to the point of barely remembering her own name meant that whoever was behind the attacks didn't want to be discovered...</p>
<p>"We don't know," Kingsley spoke, rousing the headmistress from her thoughts. "No one was there with her when they found her, nor she had any letter explaining what happened. The American Ministry did some investigation, but then the Dementors started attacking one after another and they were too busy fending them off to do anything else."</p>
<p>"And that's why they are asking us to take over," Minerva now understood why the American Ministry was pleading Hogwarts so much to help. The girl was in grave danger and what better place to go than the school that had a heavy hand in defeating Voldemort and its army? She had to give them credit for being so honest with themselves and everyone else and admit that they just couldn't protect the young witch. "Alright, tell them that she is welcomed in our school and arrange a portkey as soon as you can."</p>
<p>"I knew I could count on you, Minerva," Kingsley smiled widely at seeing the witch's eyes. They were full of determination. "I'll get her here as soon as possible."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Being yanked by her navel and then dropped on the ground in a daze was not what Samantha "Sam" Manson called 'comfortable traveling'. They had mentioned to her that the first few times it would be unnerving and uncomfortable, but she had never thought that it would that much. After all, they had made it sound like it was a minor thing...</p>
<p>Her hair was sticking in every direction and her little ponytail was barely hanging on. Her clothes, a black tank top and skirt, dark purple stockings and black combat boots had fared much better in the travel and were only a bit ruffled while her duffel bag was resting at her feet in a twisted fashion.</p>
<p>"Sorry," the man said as he helped the girl up. "Perhaps we're too used to it and we just forget how our first travels were."</p>
<p>Sam narrowed her violet eyes, but gave a deep sigh and smiled. She couldn't hold a grudge to the man that had been stuck with her for two weeks and defended her from those Dementor things. Out of all the people that had been assigned to her protection, the Auror was the only one that hadn't quit yet. She could only be grateful to the wizard, because without him, she would be dead by now.</p>
<p>Patting the man on the back a couple of times, Sam shook her head and grabbed her bag, slinging it over her shoulder. Without being able to remember anything at all and too dangerous to go back to Amity Park, the American Ministry of Magic had kindly provided her with a few clothes to carry around. The lady that had accompanied her to shopping had let her chose what she wanted to wear and paid for it without complaining.</p>
<p>"Sam, are you sure you're going to be fine?"</p>
<p>The young witch looked up at her bodyguard and gave another amused smile as his light brown hair tumbled in front of his eyes. "Oh, don't worry yourself sick, Charlie," she said, moving her gaze to rest on the immense castle sitting on top of a rocky perch in front of an even bigger lake. It was really suggestive and her smile widened. "I bet I'm going to be perfectly fine in there!"</p>
<p>Charlie looked down at the black haired head with a frown, but eventually sighed in resignation. Already someone from Hogwarts was making his way towards them and his assignment to the girl had come to an end. It was a bit sad, though. After two weeks of sticking together and surviving the Dementors, he had come to appreciate the witty banters they occasionally had and her sharp mind whenever she focused on something she believed important.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright," he said, lazily raising his hands halfway in surrender. "You're going to be fine. But I'm going to miss you, kiddo."</p>
<p>Sam shot a glare at him, then rolled her eyes before focusing her attention to the boy striding towards them. He was of an average height and had round glasses on his nose, but what really struck her was his wild hair and the confident walk he unconsciously used. As if he was someone that had fought dangerous battles and had seen the next day to tell them.</p>
<p><em>Just like him...</em> she found herself thinking.</p>
<p>A sudden sharp pain shot through her head and she brought both hands up, clutching at her black hair as she whimpered, feeling an oncoming headache. She tried to control it, to stop thinking about anything, but she couldn't help it. The boy, who was now running to her after seeing her distress, had reminded her of someone. Only problem was that she couldn't remember who he was.</p>
<p>"It's another attack..."</p>
<p>The young witch looked up to see Charlie talk with the other boy, probably explaining what was happening, while green eyes peered down at her. "Don't worry," she managed to whisper as she tried to concentrate on the blue sky behind the black haired boy's left shoulder. Yet, no matter how much she tried, her eyes always found their way back to the green ones and the headache increased exponentially. "I'll... I'll be fine..."</p>
<p>She was so distraught and confused that she never realized that she was led through large corridors filled with animated paintings, nor that dozens of students of various ages turned their curious gaze to observe the odd trio, whispering amongst themselves. It wasn't until she was lowered onto a very comfortable bed that she finally snapped out of her painful trance and looked around.</p>
<p>It was another large room, with tall arches and windows, full of soft light coming from outside and rows of beds against each wall. No one was inside save for her, her two companions and a small kid sitting dazedly on the bed opposite hers, his eyes looking left and right and jumping at every small sound that reached his ears.</p>
<p>"Are you alright?"</p>
<p>Sam rubbed her forehead and propped her upper back against the pillow behind her, her violet eyes focusing on the unknown boy standing to her right. "Yeah... it was a bit stronger than the previous ones, but nothing I could handle..."</p>
<p>Charlie gave a deep sigh of relief and his shoulders slumped slightly. "Alright, kiddo," he said as he placed a hand on the girl's shoulder and squeezed gently. "Is there anything I can do for you?"</p>
<p>The young witch rolled her eyes and would have thrown her pillow at him if it wasn't the only one she had. "I'm fine!" she said with a playful laugh. "I'm just a bit tired, so I'll lay down for a while before I start exploring this place."</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence, then the American wizard took a deep breath and let it out in a whine. "Just... just try to not get into troubles... last time you explored you... ah... you were found in the middle of a totaled room... unconscious I might add..."</p>
<p>Sam crossed her arms and seemed to sink into her pillow, the smile transforming into a frown. "Not my fault that Dementor thing decided to pay me a visit..." she then paused and sharply gazed up at the Auror. "By the way, do you know who chased it away? From what I learned, Dementors don't just give up on a target like that..."</p>
<p>Charlie shrugged helplessly and looked up at the other boy, almost in search for help. "No," he said with a shake of his head. "Everything might have been upturned and destroyed, but nothing indicating to the presence of another wizard or witch was found."</p>
<p>The conversation was interrupted when the double doors at the end of the room groaned open, letting two elderly witches inside. Madam Poppy Pomfrey, healer of the school of Hogwarts, was wearing her usual red and white robe complete with the characteristic nun-like veil on her head to better indicate her role.</p>
<p>"My, my, my..." she said as grabbed Sam's face in her hands and turned it around slightly, her eyes never leaving the young witch's violet ones. "Just some exhaustion. Nothing a night of rest can't resolve."</p>
<p>Once she had finished her examination, Madam Pomfrey smiled and produced a glass and a bottle of clear liquid from the nearby cabinet. "Drink this," she explained as she poured some of the water like substance into the glass and handed it to Sam. "It'll help you sleep."</p>
<p>Without waiting for the girl to drink it, she nodded her head to the presents and turned around to attend to the boy on the other side of the room, talking to him in hushed tones so to not disturb. Sam watched her for a few seconds while sipping the odd beverage, then turned her eyes on the other elderly witch that had waited in silence.</p>
<p>Wearing a black and dark green robe and a tall pointy hat of the same colors adorned with long, dark feathers, her demeanor spoke of a strong and strict woman, but her eyes shone with hidden worry and kindness. She was authority, she knew it well, but that didn't stop her from caring about all the kids in the school.</p>
<p>"I'm Professor Minerva McGonagall," she said, voice firm and clear. Sam had the distinct feeling that this woman was not someone to cross in any way. "Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I'm sure your Ministry of Magic already explained to you about our world?"</p>
<p>The raven haired girl nodded faintly, letting her eyes close for a moment and her mind return to that day when she had been taken to the Ministry. Calling that day hectic was very little. There had been a lot of screaming going around when it came to her odd case and people were so angered at each other that they almost started throwing stuff at each other.</p>
<p>"Yeah..." Sam said after a while with a sigh. "They told me everything they knew, promised me they would help me figure out why I was found without memory at the steps of Salem's Institute... but then the Dementors started attacking and things got out of hand..."</p>
<p>She turned her head to look at Charlie on the other side of the bed and smiled gratefully. She would have never survived for two weeks if it hadn't been for him and his colleagues.</p>
<p>"Headmistress," the Auror lightly bowed his head in respect when McGonagall turned her attention to him. "With your permission, I will leave now. I presume my Ministry has already sent you all the information you need?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I received the papers yesterday morning," Minerva replied with a quick nod. "We'll take over from now on. Rest assured that Samantha Manson is safe here at Hogwarts."</p>
<p>The four spoke for a few more minutes after that until Sam was unable to hold in a huge yawn. It wasn't that late in the day, perhaps mid afternoon, but with the recent events and the change of hours, tiredness was finally taking over.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was the first to notice how weary the young witch was and gave a rare gentle smile. "I believe we can continue this discussion over in my office," she said, motioning for the American Auror to follow her. "In the meantime, Mr. Potter, could you please keep an eye on her? I'm sure that the Dementors and whoever is behind them still don't know where she is, but it's better be safe than sorry."</p>
<p>"I'll let Ron and Hermione know the situation then," the bespectacled boy replied in understanding. After all he went through the previous years, Harry knew how to deal with danger and he was thankful that Professor McGonagall was giving him so much trust and freedom of choice over the matter.</p>
<p>It was a couple of more minutes before the headmistress and the American Auror left to talk more privately, leaving them alone. Madam Pomfrey had already left for her office next to the infirmary and the kid on the other bed was sleeping peacefully.</p>
<p>With nothing else to do and Sam finally succumbing to the sweet call of sleep, Harry Potter, young Auror and temporary Professor of Defense Against Dark Arts sat on a chair and started to read some of the essays he had to correct. That is... until the room became cold and a familiar shaped shadow slowly blocked the fading sunlight from the window at his back.</p>
<p>Wand at the ready, he turned around to face the Dementor that had slipped inside Hogwarts unnoticed. However, when he was ready to cast a Patronus, he found himself facing nothing but a window and the last rays of a setting sun that slowly warmed the otherwise frigid air.</p>
