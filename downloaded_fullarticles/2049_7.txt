    <p>   King's Cross station was crowded as ever. People were running for their trains, carrying large suitcases and sometimes pulling their little children behind them. Whistling noise was piercing the air and constant messages about arriving and departing trains were making it hard to talk with anybody. It wasn't a problem for Daphne Chapman for she was completely alone and had no one to speak to.<br/>
Daphne was a thirteen years old girl sitting currently on the floor beside a King's Cross' wall. She was brushing her dark brown hair with her fingers and observing the crowd that was passing her. No one was concerned about her being there and it was for the best. If somebody noticed her they would probably ask where her parents are. And she really didn't want to think about her mother nor her father. She just left the house, first thing in the morning, only with a small backpack with her underwear, toothbrush, few coins, diary and a half of a baguette for lunch. The moment she left her neighborhood she felt free, happier than ever. Her parents won't wake up for another hour probably. But she still wasn't safe in London, she needed to escape before they knew she's gone.<br/>
   Another train arrived at the station with a lot of noise but she heard the station worker shout it was bound for Edinburgh. <em>Edinburgh must be great</em> – Daphne thought but she didn't move. She just could see her face plastered all over the Scotland's capital with a big red “missing!” written above. No, Edinburgh wasn't a safe place for her. She wrapped her arms around her legs and observed the crowd closely, thinking what their problems are.<br/>
She noticed a big family of redheads and smiled to herself. It was probably nice to have so many brothers or sisters. You would always have somebody to play with and somebody to trust. But Daphne was an only child and she only played with her cat. That is until it escaped from her house and she never saw it again. She hoped she will be as successful as her car in escaping.<br/>
   She turned her attention back to the redhead family just to find out they were gone with a blink of an eye. Daphne stood up curious where they went, but they were nowhere to be seen. Saddened, she sat by the wall and looked at the new crowd. She noticed a boy with a large trunk and a cage with an owl on top of it. The bird was snowy white and it was cleaning its feathers. Daphne was mesmerized – she have never seen such a beautiful creature. And just as she was thinking how cool would it be to be a bird, the boy was gone. The girl rubbed her eyes shocked but he still wasn't there. Am I going crazy? - she questioned herself but continued to look at the people between the platform Nine and Ten. She tried not to blink, yet kids and teenagers were disappearing all the time from there. And they were all carrying enormous trunks and sometimes also owls, toads and cats. It couldn't be a coincidence. She still didn't see how any of them were actually going missing, she just couldn't stop herself to blink, and then they were gone.<br/>
   Daphne stood up and took her backpack, even though it looked weird compared to all the baggage everyone was carrying. Nevertheless she took few determined steps in the direction of a strange column between platform Ten and Nine. She observed discreetly all the new families flooding this area but still she couldn't figure out how were they doing that. It's like they just walked right into the column and disappeared.<br/>
“Having troubles with the gate to the Platform ¾?”<br/>
   Daphne jumped when somebody touched her shoulder. It was a teenage boy, similar to the other missing children – he had a big trunk and a cage with a black cat inside.<br/>
“<em>Platform ¾</em>?” - she thought - “<em>That's the silliest thing I've ever heard</em>”<br/>
   Nevertheless it kind of made sense – the kids were disappearing between Platform 9 and 10 after all. She swallowed, stressed and slowly nodded her head.<br/>
“Yeah, I remember when I got there before my first year. I'm also a muggle-born. And I stood there like a fool until some wizard family helped me. So it's great now I can continue the tradition. C'mon!”<br/>
Daphne felt like she was struck with a lighting. “This lad is a complete psycho!” - she thought, but was too scared to object to anything he said. He grabbed her hand and started running at the wall.<br/>
“<em>Goodbye, cruel world. Yes, it might be for the best I just smash myself on that wall and die.</em>”<br/>
   She ran with the boy and second before the impact she closed her eyes. But there was not impact at all. They just eventually stopped running and the teenager let go of Daphne's hand. She opened her eyes, certain he just decided to spare her or it was all just a prank from the start, and was shocked like never before.<br/>
   In front of her eyes appeared a platform she have never seen before. It was filled with kids with trunks, owls, toads, cats, rats, brooms, cauldrons. Most of them were wearing robes and the adults had pointy witch hats on their heads. Daphne rubbed her eyes like crazy and then she tried pinching herself, but it was all still there – real as everything.<br/>
“Yeah, it's awesome, isn't it? I had the same reaction. Anyway, take care and see you in Hogwarts!” - the boy waved at her and left quickly, getting lost in the crowd.<br/>
   Daphne stood her, clutching her backpack and considered her options. She could just tell somebody she is here by a mistake, she could try going back by herself (which sounded very dangerous and Daphne quickly dropped that idea).<br/>
“<em>Hogwarts</em>?” it just came to her what the boy said. “<em>What in the bloody hell is Hogwarts? Is this like a farming school?</em>”<br/>
   She thought about it again and decided to address the elephant in the room – the boy talked about wizards, and the sight of Platform ¾ just confirmed it. It was either a convention for very engaged geeks - which of course Daphne considered the main option – or it really was about magic. Like a real one. And all the people there were wizards and witches, and they were going to Hogwarts which is like a school for magic people, but with a very stupid name. This option of course was very silly, even for a thirteen years old like Daphne.<br/>
   The crowded was getting smaller, the kids were boarding the trains and adults were waving at them from the platform. Daphne took a big breath, clutched her bag tighter and with determined steps, she got inside the train as well. Her heart was beating like crazy. “<em>What if they check for tickets?</em>” - she thought and started sweating but quickly shook her head. - “<em>In the absolutely worst scenario they try contacting my parents. But then I will run away tomorrow or the day after! Right now I will do my best not getting caught!</em>”<br/>
   She wiped the sweat from her forehead and started walking down the aisle. All the compartments were already full or nearly full. It would be ideal to find a empty one, so no one asks her anything, but she doubted it will be possible. And maybe she could use some company to get more information about where are they going and what for.<br/>
   She stopped by a compartment that was occupied by a girl and a boy around her age. They looked friendly enough so she decided to risk it and go inside. They smiled at her and after she put her bag on the shelf they extended their hands.<br/>
“Hello! My name is Hermione Granger. And this is Neville. We're both in our first year. And you?” - Daphne shook their hands. The girl had a big, messy hairstyle and front teeth a little too big. Her voice sounded bossy, but Daphne didn't mind that much. The boy was a little chubby, with a round face and scared expression.<br/>
“I'm Daphne. I'm also in the first year.” - she lied and sat down in front of them. The conductor whistled last time and the train slowly started moving. Hermione and Neville walked to the window and waved, probably at their parents. Daphne pretended she is very busy watching if the bags on shelves don't fall when the train moves to fast.<br/>
After the train left the station Hermione and Neville sat again but didn't ask if her parents haven't seen her off. Daphne was grateful of course and wanted to start a conversation but didn't really know what to say. She sat comfortably and looked at the ceiling.<br/>
“So... Hogwarts, ey?” - she said, pretending to be deep in thoughts. The other kids wiggled excited and nodded.<br/>
“I've already read most of the school books and even the History of Hogwarts. I don't want to be worse than the others just because I'm a muggle-born” - said Hermione and Daphne looked at her with a big smile.<br/>
“Hey, I'm also a moggle-born!” - she said happily, connecting the facts like a detective. Somehow the girls both looked at Neville, awaiting his response. His face became red in a second and he sunk a little in his seat.<br/>
“Oh... I was raised by my grandma... And she's a witch, so...” - he said in a shy tone, looking at his knees the whole time. Daphne spotted a big toad sitting beside him with its eyes closed.<br/>
“Cool toad” - she commented, hoping to make him feel better. Neville indeed smiled a bit and took his pet onto his lap with a proud expression.<br/>
“Thanks, his name is Trevor. My uncle gave it to me when he heard I got accepted to Hogwarts” - the boy tried to pet the toad but it didn't look very happy about it. After few strokes it jumped from his lap on the floor and trough the open door – outside. “Oh no!” - he screamed, and ran after it. Daphne and Hermione also stood up and followed him, but they found him outside, holding his head with his hands. - “I don't know which was she went!” - he said, panicking.<br/>
“It's okay, Neville. Calm down” - Daphne said - “Go look that way and we will look there.”<br/>
   The boy nodded and walked in the direction Daphne pointed for him. The girls looked at each other, shared a little smile and went the opposite way.<br/>
“I hope you will pick it up if we find it” - said Hermione. - “I'm scared it's kinda gross”<br/>
   Daphne chuckled but said nothing, not sure if she will be okay with touching it. They walked a bit, not bothered to check any compartments since they were closed so Trevor couldn't walk inside. When they reached one that was opened, they peaked inside. There were two boys around their age inside. One with red hair and the other with black.<br/>
“Hey, have you seen a toad? Our friend lost it and we're looking for it” - said Hermione. Daphne opened her eyes wide – the red haired boy was holding a stick which clearly looked like a magic wand. He was in the middle of patting his rat with it, but nothing really happened except few sad sparks. Still it was enough for Daphne to be shocked and ready to pinch herself again.<br/>
“Oh, you're casting spells?” - said Hermione and walked inside like it was already her compartment. She said in front of the black haired boy and took out her wand. - “I read something about it already” - she said in a “Know-it-all” tone and put the wand it front of the boy's face. Daphne's heart was beating so fast now, not ready to witness actual magic. But it happened right there and then. - “Oculus Reparo!” - she exclaimed and touched boy's glasses with the end of her wand. They were clearly broken and taped together before but now they jumped, twisted and placed themselves back on his nose – looking like new!<br/>
   Daphne had to hold to the door, not to faint like a fool. It couldn't be some kind of a fake magic trick. It was real. And she was on a train filled with people who could do that. Oh, she was in a big trouble. She either had to jump trough the window right now or step her game up. Because pretending she knows what a “moggle-born” is won't be enough soon.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>   They kids were now all sitting together – Neville has found Trevor and joined the rest. Harry bought a lot of sweets from the Candy Lady and they were now all trying numerous things. Daphne noticed he paid with something other than pounds – something very gold. She barely had any normal money so she doubted she could exchange it for those gold coins.<br/>
“That's Albus Dumbledore! He's the headmaster of Hogwarts” - said the red-head boy whose name was Ron. Harry, the other boy was just looking at his collector card from a chocolate frog. “They say he's very powerful!”<br/>
   Daphne swallowed. It probably wasn't a great idea to illegally sneak into a magic school ruled by a powerful wizard. But she already decided she will try doing that and she was determined.<br/>
“He disappeared!” - Harry checked the card closely but the man indeed wasn't there.<br/>
“Of course, do you think he has the time to sit there whole day?” - answered Ron like it was the most obvious thing. Daphne noticed that Harry must also be a muggle-born, since he didn't know things about magic world like her and Hermione. She still didn't figure out what that exactly means but she knew there are more people that don't understand magic rules and it gave her an advantage. Every time she didn't know what to say she would just hide behind that title.<br/>
“Do you know what house do you want to be sorted to?” - asked Ron without further explanation. - “My whole family was in Gryffindor so I doubt I will be different.”<br/>
“I heard Ravenclaw is for people who are knowledge-hungry” - said Hermione - “So I will probably go there.” - she smiled proudly.<br/>
   Neville sunk in his seat and clearly didn't want to answer the question. And Harry and Daphne were just very confused so Hermione rushed with an explanation:<br/>
“There are four houses in Hogwarts. You are sorted to them based on your character traits and it influences where you sleep and who do you have classes with. To simplify – Gryffindor is for the brave, Hufflepuff for the hard-working, Slytherin for the ambitious and Ravenclaw is for creative.”<br/>
   Daphne tilted her head in a shock. It didn't really make sense, and it wasn't like nothing in normal school she was used to. She didn't understand the need to divide children like that.<br/>
“I think it's silly. I would call myself all of those things...” - she said, realizing at the end it might sounds a bit arrogant. Before anyone could speak, she followed: - “How do you get sorted anyway? Some kind of personality test?”<br/>
“With a sorting hat” - said Ron, mouth full with chocolate. - “It reads your mind and know everything!”<br/>
   Daphne wasn't that excited, she gulped and chewed on her candy bar – no more question asked. Powerful headmaster, mind-reading hat – it was all getting very scary.</p>
