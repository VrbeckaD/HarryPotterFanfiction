          <div class="userstuff"><p>Sirius woke feeling-- as he often did these days-- warm and safe. Strong arms were wrapped around him, and James pressed his lips to the back of Sirius’s neck. “Morning.”</p>
<p>Sirius hummed, absently snuggling back into him.</p>
<p>James kissed his neck again. “It’s nearly eight.”</p>
<p>Sirius grumbled, an approximation of the word, “So?” coming out.</p>
<p>He could feel James smiling against his skin. “So we should get out of bed and have breakfast.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“I’s my birthday, we’re havin’ a lie-in.”</p>
<p>James sighed heavily, putting on a good show for his uncaring audience. “Well I suppose if I have to.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sirius came to the conclusion that James had gone all-out for his birthday this year, and he didn’t know why. Not that he minded, but it was a bit strange. A lie-in, morning sex, a special breakfast, all of those things were expected. But James had also gotten him a gift, <em> and </em> organised a little party with their friends, <em> and </em> made reservations at Sirius’s favourite expensive restaurant for dinner, <em> and </em> special ordered a cake.</p>
<p>It was… a bit much. After all, if James got him a gift, they normally didn’t go out to dinner. If they spent time with their friends, they either got dinner with them, or ate in. As for the cake? Well, he hadn’t gotten one of those since his first birthday they celebrated as a couple.</p>
<p>He asked James, but he just deflected and kissed Sirius and said, “Can’t I want you to have a birthday you’ll love and remember?”</p>
<p>“You <em> can</em>, but,” Sirius trailed off at James’s bright smile. He sighed and smiled back. “Forget it.”</p>
<p>It was-- to date-- one of the best days Sirius had ever had. Top ten, easily, and he told James so.</p>
<p>James hummed and said, “I think I can make it top five.”</p>
<p>“Do you?” Sirius asked, raising an eyebrow. “The other days in my top five have been pretty damn great.”</p>
<p>James didn’t answer verbally, but he did grab Sirius left hand and run his thumb over his fingers, right under the knuckles. “Ever think about wearing a ring, Si?” he asked, voice intimately soft.</p>
<p>Sirius blinked, starting to understand. “James…”</p>
<p>James looked at him again, smiling slightly. With the hand not holding Sirius’s, he reached into his pocket and lowered himself to one knee. He pulled the ring box out and flipped it open, then turned it towards Sirius. “Marry me?”</p>
<p>Sirius dropped to the ground to pull James to him roughly, kissing him senseless.</p>
<p>“Is that a yes?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be an idiot, of course it’s a yes.”</p></div>
