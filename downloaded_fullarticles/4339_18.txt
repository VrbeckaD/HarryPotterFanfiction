    <p>It was 1:20 in the morning. She was awoken by the sound of her phone. It was a text message. </p>
<p> 	From: Unknown<br/>
Miss Granger<br/>
Expect a letter<br/>
At 6a sharp<br/>
Xoxo D</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who the fuck would be texting her at this hour. She was convinced it was a prank so she went back to bed.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her work alarm went off at 5:45 Am. UGGGH she really didn’t want to go to work today. She rolled out of bed. She was just about to walk into the bathroom to take a shower when there was a knock t the door. She looked at her clock. 6 Am Sharp.  She went to answer the door. Outside was a tall man in a dark gray suit.<br/>
“Delivery for a Miss Hermione Granger.” </p>
<p>She has handed a white box and a red envelope with the words READ ME FIRST on it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Hermione,<br/>
I have a surprise planned for you today. I have already spoken with the Ministry you have the day off please be ready by 8 pm and wear what is in the box. Use this to get your hair and nails done and go to the spa I want you to relax and feel pampered today<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
D</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Attached to the letter was a credit card.  D, who could that be.  </p>
<p>She decided to call her boss. Her boss confirmed that he was told by The Minister of Magic himself that she had the day off for “person reasons” she would also be paid a full day’s wages also. This was getting kind of creepy. She was about to open the box when her phone rang, it was the same number as before.  </p>
<p>“Hello who the fuck is this,8 pm,into” she said<br/>
“Please don’t be scared, I understand this is strange but please listen. I know your hearts truest desire and I know what your dreams are about. I want to make those dreams come true. Please take the card and pamper yourself. There is no limit on the card spend as much money as you want. I will send a car to get you 8 pm be ready at exactly 8 please. We have reservations at 10 pm. You can see me before you even sit down if you want to leave you may but please come it will be worth it I promise. Please do not open the box until tonight when you are getting ready. “ </p>
<p>She knew this voice, it was comforting she knew she could trust them but she couldn’t place who it was. He was right there was no harm in going and seeing who he was. </p>
<p>She spent the day at the spa. She felt like a princess when she left. She arrived back home it was 6 pm. Just enough time to get a shower and get dressed. Was she actually going to do this? Was she actually going to meet this mystery guy? She took the box with her into the bathroom and when she stepped out of the shower she opened it. Inside was a beautiful knee length strapless black dress. There was also a silver pair of heels. She removed the shoes and set them on the floor and set the dress on the sink counter. She looked back in the box to see a green pair of lace panties. She did her makeup and her hair and put on the black dress, Thank goodness it zipped on the side. She pulled the lace panties on. Was she actually going do to do this? Her hair hung down her shoulders and back like perfect crimson waves.  </p>
<p>The doorbell rang her ride was here. Standing at her door was a limo driver “Miss Granger” he led her to the limo she climbed inside and sitting on the seat was a black box with an iridescent emerald silk bow. She opened the box and there was a note on top </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wear this tonight.<br/>
It is beautiful but not  As beautiful as you Xoxoxo<br/>
D</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was the most beautiful diamond necklace she had ever seen. She put it on. She felt beautiful.  </p>
<p>They drove for what seemed like an hour.  They pulled up in front of a fancy Italian restaurant.<br/>
This was clearly an expensive place and she would never be able to afford a meal her in her life.  The driver walked around and opened her door for her.<br/>
She thanked him and walked inside the restaurant. She was met by a host who asked her name.  “Hermione Granger.” </p>
<p>“Right this way Ma’am” They walked past tables of people until they reached a private balcony out back of the restaurant. It overlooked the beach.  She saw him sitting there. He looked like a God just looking out watching the wave’s crash onto the beach, the candlelight made his face light up like angels. She knew who this way. She thought it had to be a joke there was no way this way the person who asked her out on a blind date.  She took a deep breath and opened the door.<br/>
He turned his head and stood up.<br/>
“Welcome, Hermione. I was hoping you would come. Please come sit” </p>
<p>She walked over and sat down at the table.  The waiter came over asked what she wanted to eat.<br/>
“Alfredo please,” she said<br/>
“Tortellini please, and champagne please for us both.” He said </p>
<p>The waiter walked away to put the order  in the kitchen.<br/>


The waiter returned with their food. They ate in silence she was speechless. She couldn’t believe she was on a date with him and he had plans for after dinner with her. She stared into his Grey eyes. She could not believe her on a date with no other than Draco Malfoy. </p>
<p>To be continued… If you want more that is</p>
