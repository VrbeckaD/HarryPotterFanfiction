  <span class="s1">It had been sixteen years since Harry had defeated Lord Voldemort and he finally felt like the universe was rewarding him. He paused while pouring his morning coffee when this thought struck him. He smiled quietly to himself. Taking his coffee, he stepped out the kitchen door into the backyard. Harry never really felt like it lived up to the distinction of a ‘back’ yard. Much like The Burrow the area around the house was circular, a trait that seemed to be quite common among wizarding homes in the country. It was clearly a yard, and thanks to some hard work and a good eye it was a damn nice one. A rough wood fence circled the whole thing, dipping off in the back when it moved over a small hill. Harry could see over the small field that surrounded them and just to the edge of the sea in the distance. He sipped his coffee, the soft thumping of footsteps slowly coming into focus in his mind. He could hear them laughing and busying themselves in the kitchen. He knew they'd all be off to work soon. As much as he loved his days off he loved them a fair bit more when he had one of his men to keep him company. </span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">He heard the screen door open behind him. They came out fast in the morning, especially when they all had meetings. Neville was the first today. He held Harry’s hand and kissed it gently as he passed. Soft grin and messy hair making Harry chuckle to himself. Neville almost tripped over himself as he stepped off the porch into the backyard and disapparated. Shortly behind Neville was Dean. The most quiet of the bunch, Dean also stepped onto the porch with a cup of coffee. Harry didn't hear him but felt his hand as he touched Harry’s shoulder gently.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Good luck with the gallery,” Harry said. “Hopefully it’s a full roster of commissions.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Dean gave a small laugh, but Harry could tell he was nervous.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“See you later.” Dean replied as he leaned over to kiss Harry lightly on the cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">They exchanged one of the deep meaningful looks Dean was prone to engaging in before he smiled and disapparated as well. Seamus was next, throwing open the door and rushing out only partly dressed. He was swearing under his breath, but even in a rush he managed to take a moment to smack Harry hard on the arse as he passed. Just as he turned to disapparate Harry called “Get back here you git!”</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“What the feck do you want?” Seamus replied. “Need a grab before I go?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Seamus turned slightly, posing just a bit so that his round arse was noticeable.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“As a matter of fact, I do.” </span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Harry laughed as Seamus almost bounded over to him, sandy hair crazy in the morning breeze. Seamus stopped short of the porch, forcing Harry to set his coffee down and step of to meet him. Seamus’s eyes were dancing as Harry stepped close to him. He was almost vibrating with excitement as Harry reached around him and began fixing his clothes.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“You’re a respected healer, you can’t go to work like this!” he admonished.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">He finished straightening his robes and had just begun tucking in his shirt when:</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Oh!” Harry said in surprise.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Like it? I decided to forgo pants today. Given that its a meeting day it just didn't seem worth it”</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Harry slowly rubbed his hands over the bare arse of Seamus Finnigan. He continued tucking in the shirt, but much slower and more deliberately now. When he came around to the front he tucked the whole thing in with one hand, making sure to tuck it deep. His hand cupped Seamus’s cock and balls and he gave a soft squeeze. Seamus sighed and shuddered against him. Harry loved seeing Seamus’s eyelids flutter like that. Slowly and deliberately he withdrew his hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Now why'd you go doing a thing like that?” Seamus whined.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Harry leaned close as he buttoned Seamus’s robe.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Because you wanted me to.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Harry could tell those were some kind of magic words. Seamus spluttered a bit and blushed red all the way up into his hairline. Harry laughed and turned him around, giving him a smack on the arse in return to send him on his way.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Ron was last, a normal occurrence when only Harry had the day off. He stepped out of the kitchen with his peanut butter sandwich and wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“What’re you thinking about?” he said through a thick mouthful.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Harry laughed.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“I’m thinking you’re mother will never forgive me if you forget how to chew!”</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">They both chuckled. Then Harry was quiet for a moment.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“I was thinking about this. About this place, about how we got here. Who would have ever thought things would turn out this way?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Ron smiled lightly at him.<br/> “I don’t know, I guess, well it was all there wasn’t it?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“How do you mean?” Harry asked, intrigued.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Like, it was always going to be this way. It’s like we are planting seeds. We know what they're gonna be, and that they will help us, but we don’t know how we are going to make use of them yet. Except now is harvest time.” </span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">He smiled at Harry with a mouthful of raspberry jam and Harry snorted.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Off with you!” Harry said as he playfully swatted at Ron.</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Ron pulled him close around the waist and planted a sticky peanut butter kiss on him, grinning. </span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Alright, but I’ll be home straight after work! Can’t let Seamus get to you first”</span>
</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Harry smiled as Ron stood up. He couldn’t help but think this was going to be a good day. It was then with the crack as Ron vanished that Harry remembered: his kids were coming today.</span>
