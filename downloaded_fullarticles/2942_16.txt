    <p>"Well…this isn't good." Harry muttered quietly, even as he dug out the flying carpet and shoved it at Neville. </p><p>"Ya think?" Neville said sarcastically.</p><p>"Move." Harry barked, not deigning to answer.</p><p>Neville unfurled the carpet and he, Luna and Tom leapt on, while Harry dashed forward to scoop up the impaled woman lying on the ground a distance ahead of them. He was just about to grab her when some sixth sense warned him of danger. He flipped over the woman, just missing being grabbed by a weird plant…<em>thing</em> with a bi-colored face. He twisted and shot fire right into the thing's creepy face and scooped up the woman in time to leap aboard the carpet as it soared past.</p><p>"We've got company." Tom muttered tensely.</p><p>Two of the figures perched on the towering fingertips of the disturbing wooden statue that took up most of the cave leapt down.</p><p>The blonde fellow had a wicked-looking multi-bladed scythe and a blood-thirsty grin. The second man they could only see his eyes.</p><p>Neville managed to get the carpet up, but they weren't out of danger yet. The blood-thirsty blonde flung his scythe and likely would have impaled Luna if not for Tom's quick action in deflecting it. Luna was busy concentrating on the wall of the cave that they were quickly approaching. She flung out a powerful bombarda and blew a hole large enough to fit all of them.</p><p>"Duck." Neville warned as he aimed the carpet towards it. Luna turned around to help Tom fend off the persistent ninjas on their tail-- they'd leapt up out of the cave practically right on their heels and were still following them!--while Harry focused on healing the woman they'd rescued.</p><p>"Head towards the mountains. Ninjas or not, it'll take them longer to cross them than it will us. We can lose them there." Harry suggested.</p><p>"Just what I was thinking" Neville agreed, chancing a glance behind them. "What the hell were they even doing back there? What was that thing?"</p><p>"I have no clue. It's nothing good. I know that much."</p><p>"Is she going to be okay?" Luna asked tensely, still watching their pursuit.</p><p>"Yeah. She seems to have a healing factor or something. Some of her wounds are closing on their own. Those things stuck in her must have been hindering it in some way."</p><p>"Any idea where we are?" Tom asked next, relaxing as the ninjas began losing ground on them as they entered the mountains.</p><p>"Not a clue. We're not in Konoha, but beyond that I couldn't say. I didn’t exactly get to see a lot of this world before, and I only glanced at a world map once. We're going to have to ask for directions or something."</p><p>"Maybe she'll be able to tell us something once she wakes up." Neville said with determined cheer.</p><p>"Hopefully. I just hope Konoha and whatever village she's from aren't on bad terms." </p><p>"She's not from Konoha?" Luna asked curiously.</p><p>"No. See her headband? I don't remember which village that represents, but it's definitely not Konoha. They have a thing that sort of looks like a bird with a spiral in the middle that's supposed to be a leaf. This sort of looks like a side view of the starship Enterprise… It might be Cloud village. We'll have to ask her."</p><p>Harry noted Tom and Luna were both rather twitchy.</p><p>"What? Are those ninjas catching up?"</p><p>"No… I can feel something on me. It's faint, but I don't like it." Luna shrugged.</p><p>"Something on you, you say?" Tom said in interest. "I didn't get that, I just knew something was off. Hold still. I'm going to see if I can find whatever it is."</p><p>"You know…now that you've called attention to it…yeah, there's something different." Neville agreed.</p><p>Harry finished healing what he could of the ninja girl they'd rescued and strengthened the sleep spell he'd put on her--he didn't want her waking in a panic and attacking while they were up in the air, after all-- then closed his eyes and began taking careful stock of himself to see if he could find whatever was bugging everyone.</p><p>"There is something…it's small, whatever it is. I almost overlooked it." Tom noted as he dug around for a container.</p><p>He found a small empty vial in one of his pockets and tapped it with his wand before tapping Luna on the top of her head and then repeating it on himself and Harry who was also in reach. Harry crawled forward to take over directing the carpet so Neville could get hit as well once he switched places with him. Tom held up the vial and frowned.</p><p>"There's nothing in… wait, no, I'm wrong. There is something there, it's just so small I nearly missed it."</p><p>He cast a magnification spell on the vial and held it up to study the contents that he could now see a bit better--a small pile of white dots. Neville leaned in to take a look as well.</p><p>"Looks like plant spores."</p><p>"It must be a parting gift from that weird plant man, though whether it was intended to harm us or track us I couldn't say."</p><p>"Best get rid of them regardless." Luna opined.</p><p>Tom looked ever so briefly pained at the loss of a learning opportunity, as did Neville. Tom contented himself with a few scans which he offered to share before vanishing the lot. Upon consideration, he tapped the ninja girl and the carpet to remove any spores he might have missed and vanished those as well.</p><p>"Looks like a cave up ahead. Someone scan for life signs. We can set up camp for a bit, get something to eat, question our ninja friend here, and take a closer look at the cave and those weirdos."</p><p>"Sounds like a plan. It seems to be clear. The front end might be a bit of a squeeze, but there's space enough for the cabin a bit further back." Tom offered.</p><p>"Any sign of the creeps?" Neville asked.</p><p>"We seem to have lost them for the moment, but we'll have to keep an eye out." Luna replied as Harry brought them to the cave he'd spotted, which was about three-quarters of the way up on the mountain they were passing.</p><p>When they landed, Harry conjured a stretcher to carry the ninja girl, Luna grabbed the cabin from Tom and darted ahead to set it up. Neville grabbed the carpet and rolled it up following after them. Tom layered an illusion to disguise the cave opening and then began laying wards around the cavern to hide their presence and alert them if anyone found them.</p><p>When he entered the cabin, he found the other three gathered around the ninja girl who had been laid out on the chaise lounge in the front parlor.</p><p>"Just in time. We were about to wake her up. I put a sticking charm on her so she can't leap up and try to kill us all. She'll probably be panicked when she wakes, considering how we found her." Harry noted.</p><p>"Maybe we should step back and make sure Luna is the first person she sees. We don't know what all was done to her before she ended up in that cave." Tom suggested.</p><p>Harry and Neville both grimaced and nodded, taking a step back.</p><p>"Maybe we should just take ourselves to the kitchen and get started on lunch and let Luna handle things for now." Neville agreed.</p><p>"Probably not a bad idea. Just let her know how she ended up here, give her a chance to clean up and all. Join us whenever you're ready." Harry nodded.</p><p>"Will do." Luna agreed. "Ennervate."</p><p>The ninja girl continued to lay there passively, eyes closed.</p><p>"Please be at ease. You're safe. My friends and I took you from those people who had you. You're not in danger. None of us are ninjas. We're not from this area, so we're not sure which village you hail from, or how far you are from your home village. We're hoping you can give us some idea of where we are while you're at it. We're in a safe place at the moment, but I feel I should warn you that two of the ninjas that had you chased us for a while. We were on a flying carpet, so we were able to lose them in the mountains, but they may not be too far behind us by now. We've hidden ourselves, so we should be safe enough, so please don't worry."</p><p>The woman opened her eyes and her gaze took in Luna, then darted around, quickly cataloguing all she could see. Luna could almost see her calculating the distance to the door, eyeing the room for possible weapons, and listening carefully to discover who else was nearby and whether she could make a run for it before they could reach her. Luna made a point of staying relaxed and non-threatening, and waited.Sure enough, a moment later she saw her muscles twitch in readiness to escape, only for her brow to crease and her gaze grow panicked for a moment before being swallowed down, her face becoming impassive once more.</p><p>"You're stuck to the chair you're on. You suffered a recent trauma and we feared you'd panic and attack the moment you woke. My friends headed off to make lunch for all of us so you wouldn't be confronted with a whole group of strangers. If I let you loose, do I have your word you won't attack any of us?"</p><p>The woman stared at her for a long moment and then nodded.</p><p>"You have my word." Luna did a silent finite incantatum and tucked her wand away.</p><p>"Would you like to clean up? You're covered in quite a lot of blood. I can lend you a robe while we wash your clothes."</p><p>The woman stared at her again before answering.</p><p>"That would be acceptable."</p><p>"Alright. Follow me. We can join the boys and get lunch once you've cleaned up some."</p><p>The woman's stomach gurgled and she grimaced with embarrassment. Luna's gurgled a moment later, but she just laughed.</p><p>"Goodness. I guess we're both hungry. Oh, I just realized I hadn't bothered to introduce myself. I'm Luna."</p><p>"Yuugito Nii." the woman answered.</p><p> </p><p>Yuugito took a better look around as she climbed to her feet. They were in a large open room that seemed to be divided into a living room and kitchen. Three young men were across the room in the kitchen part. All three turned to look at the two of them curiously before turning back to their own discussion, and in the case of one of them, went back to the stove where he seemed to be preparing food.</p><p>The girl, Luna, led them to the stairs at one end of the room and upstairs to one of the many doors lining the upper hallway.</p><p>"This is my room in here." she explained as she opened the door.</p><p>Inside was a somewhat messy bedroom. A pile of folded laundry that hadn't been put away sat on a shelf across the way, the desk was piled with books and scrolls. Ceramic butterflies painted in bright colors were scattered across one wall, while another held a couple of movie posters. Luna ignored most of the room and moved to the door on one wall, gesturing her through.</p><p>"Here. You can take a shower in there. Put all your clothing in the hamper there and it'll be sent down to be washed. Oh, I should make sure there are towels… Ah, hold on a moment."</p><p>She left the room. Yuugito followed her and peeked out into the hall to see what she was doing. She opened a cupboard door in the hallway and withdrew a couple of thick, fluffy towels and brought them back with her, handing them over when she returned.</p><p>"Oh…I should get you some underwear. You're in luck. I recently bought some new stuff that I haven't worn yet. It's one size fits all so don't worry about that." Luna chattered as she went digging in one of the drawers.</p><p>She withdrew a pair of thin, stretchy pants that looked like they'd go halfway to her knees and a stretchy tube of material that she assumed was meant as a breast binding. She set those on the bed and moved to the closet, where she pulled down a white terry-cloth bathrobe. There were blue and purple flowers embroidered around the collar, the pockets, and the cuff of the sleeves. She laid that out on the bed and took her back in the bathroom where she grabbed a toothbrush in a wrapper from beneath the sink and laid it out, showed her where the soap and shampoo and toothpaste were and how to turn the water in the shower on and off and adjust it before telling her to join them when she was ready.</p><p>"Ah…thank you. I think I can take it from here." Yuugito said, attempting to be gracious.</p><p>Luna just gave her a brief smile and left, closing the bedroom door behind her. Yuugito saw a lock on the door and slid it across, feeling some of the tension in her shoulders decrease once she'd done so. It was a flimsy barrier to anyone determined to get inside, but it made her feel better nonetheless.</p><p>Once the door was secured she sank onto the end of the bed, still clutching the towels she'd been given and focused on just breathing. The last thing she remembered was battling two men in black cloaks with red clouds on them. She'd been confident in her ability to protect herself, at least at first, but nothing she did seemed to be enough to keep either of them down. She'd even transformed, and it still hadn't been enough. She knew, deep in her bones that she had come very close to death, even if she couldn't actually remember it. To wake and find herself with a new group of strangers, however harmless they seemed to be, really did nothing to calm the tension thrumming through her veins and demanding she do something. She sat quietly and she breathed until she no longer felt like she was about to jump out of her own skin. When she felt calmer and more in control, she rose and headed for the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>Once cleaned and feeling marginally more human, Yuugito retraced the path she and the other woman had taken earlier. She took the time to get a better look at the many strange moving photos that lined the walls. There were photos of people and landscapes. The landscapes were unfamiliar, as was the architecture of most of the buildings. She continued eyeing the photos as she went, taking in details so she'd have something to report when she eventually returned home; especially given she didn't remember anything after having been subdued by those two freaks who just wouldn't die.</p><p>Her hands clenched at her sides for a moment, but she made herself relax and keep walking. She was a jounin of Cloud and the host of the two-tails. She would not falter. She could smell food--fish of some sort, fresh bread and tea--and her stomach gurgled again in anticipation. The woman from earlier and her friends were gathered in the kitchen area.</p><p>The eldest of the bunch was peering into a large stone bowl, face blank and eyes vacant. A stocky, tall boy with blonde hair the color of her own was pouring tea, while the woman laid out dishes on the table. The last of them seemed to be in charge of the food. He transferred a pot to the center of the table and then busied himself gathering the rolls that were cooling off to the side, gathering them in a couple of baskets which he laid at either end of the table.</p><p>"Toys away, it's time to eat." he told the guy with the bowl.</p><p>The one with the bowl stirred and shook himself, his face losing the look of vacant concentration. He grumbled a bit, but he gathered the bowl and the pile of papers he'd been working on then waved a stick over the lot, making them disappear--a summoning of some sort? Luna smiled at her when she appeared.</p><p>"Good timing. Everything's ready." she offered, as she began dishing out what seemed to be a thick stew of some sort.</p><p>"It's seafood chowder. You don't have any shellfish allergies or anything, do you? I can find something else if you do." the boy who seemed to be the cook spoke up.</p><p>"No, this is fine, thank you. It smells wonderful."</p><p>It did too. She was half afraid her stomach was going to start complaining again, but it seemed content to keep its peace for the moment as it was about to be fed. She automatically catalogued the exits, what was near to hand that could be used as a weapon, checked for the tell-tale gleam of poison on the dishes and cutlery, and did a threat assessment on the four in the kitchen with her as she took the empty seat nearest to hand. She wasn't actually worried they would attack her; even the two tails seemed unusually quiet and relaxed at the moment--it was simply second nature to her after a lifetime spent as a ninja. Everyone was quiet as they ate, which suited her fine; she was hungry enough that the chance to simply savor the meal in peace was appreciated. When the stew was gone, the cook boy rose and pulled out several small bowls filled with a yellowish substance sprinkled with something.</p><p>"Egg custard." Harry told everyone as he handed them out, while tea boy refreshed everyone's cups.</p><p>"Aang's favorite. You're such a good big brother." Luna teased.</p><p>"I am an excellent big brother." the cook nodded. "I learned how to make ramen in preparation for this trip." he admitted with a self-deprecating grin. "Naruto's favorite."</p><p>"You have a friend named fishcake who loves ramen?" Yuugito asked with a small smile.</p><p>"Yeah, though I don't know if that was the meaning his parents intended when they named him that. He's an Uzumaki, so they might have intended 'maelstrom' which is a nice, strong name…though honestly, unless he's changed a lot, fishcake probably suits him more." he added with a grin.</p><p>"You do seem to have a type." the man at the end said dryly.</p><p>When the food was done, Luna rose and beckoned Yuugito to follow her.</p><p>"Your clothes should be done by now. I would imagine you'd like to get out of that robe."</p><p>Thought the robe was warm and fluffy, she couldn't disagree. She'd feel much more secure once in her uniform again, though she imagined it was in rather bad shape, even newly cleaned, considering the battle she'd recently been in. Much to her surprise, not only was her uniform clean, there was no damage to be seen--not that she was complaining, but she knew for a fact that her shirt and pants both should have several holes and tears in them. Her breastplate and arm-guards had nary a scratch. Even her shoes were clean and undamaged--not a fraying bit of material or blood to be seen. Even the bandages she normally wound around her forearms and the bottom of her legs looked clean and nearly brand new.</p><p>Once dressed she felt more in control and like herself again, but for one thing. Her hair tie had gotten wrecked during the battle, leaving her long, blonde hair hanging free and somewhat in the way. When she stepped back outside, Luna was waiting with a brush and a comb.</p><p>"Would you like me to braid your hair back for you?"</p><p>Yuugito felt a bit awkward at the offer, but accepted graciously even so. Her long hair, an admitted conceit in her line of work, would be a liability should she need to make a quick escape. Best it was dealt with, even if she felt awkward about it. It was nerve-wracking at first having someone so close behind her, but she relaxed in spite of herself. Luna's hands were gentle and she hummed a song quietly as she worked. If her mother had ever done this, it was so long ago now that she couldn't remember it.</p><p>"There. That should do it. You have such lovely hair. Thank you for giving me a chance to play with it."</p><p>Yuugito felt along her head to see what she'd done. Her hair was braided tightly against her skull and then hung in a long, tight braid down her back, secured along its length with several stretchy bands to hold the braid together so it wouldn't start unravelling should she be in battle, which was thoughtful of her…and strange. A civilian normally wouldn't consider things like that, as most civilians wouldn't be doing anything that would cause such a thing to happen, and wouldn't consider what a liability it could be in the right circumstances.</p><p>Luna led them to another room where the others were waiting. It was a good-sized room, filled with books and scrolls --more than she'd ever seen in one place outside the library or the records room. There was a large desk at one end, which is where everyone was gathered.</p><p>"Ah, Yuugito-san, good. I imagine you have questions about how you came to be in our keeping. We thought it would be easier just to show you." the cook boy said as they moved closer.</p><p>"This is what is known as a pensieve. We can remove memories from our minds and place them in here and then immerse ourselves in them." the oldest one, who had been staring into the stone bowl, that was now on the end of the desk, explained. "Your mind takes in a lot of details that your aren't aware of at the time. This allows you to go back and examine everything at leisure."</p><p>Everyone gathered around the end of the desk, leaving a space for her.</p><p>"Just relax and stare down into the bowl. You may feel like you're falling, but that's just your mind connecting with the memories." tea boy assured her. "It's kind of weird, really, but it is very useful."</p><p>Somewhat wary, she moved to stand with the others and glanced down into the bowl. The bottom seemed to be filled with silver mist… She was falling then, and the mist surrounding her darkened and began to morph and twist around her. She crouched warily, scanning her surroundings, only to spot herself, laying in a heap on the floor of a sizeable cavern. She was bruised and bloody, pinned to the ground with a couple of black rods. She froze, simply staring at herself, only to twitch and glance to the side when a glowing circle opened in the air and the four with her jumped out, one after another.</p><p>Cook boy went first, accompanied by a white owl. Luna and tea boy came next, followed last by bowl boy. "Well, this isn't good" cook boy laughed grimly.</p><p>"Yeah, not quite where we planned to land." cook boy spoke from behind her.</p><p>Yuugito twitched and looked behind her, only to spot Luna and the others watching themselves. She turned back around and saw cook boy pull out a rolled carpet and shove it at tea boy, even while he gestured at her body. He frowned and ran forward towards her and then leapt over her body as a freak plant man erupted from the ground where he'd just been crouched on. He gestured and flung a stream of fire into its face, lifted her and leapt onto the carpet he'd shoved at tea boy earlier, which was now flying. Movement from the corner of her eye turned her gaze from her companions fleeing with her body, to spot the two who had captured her leaping down from the massive…thing that took up the rear of the cavern and give chase. Everything froze around them.</p><p>"Any idea what these freaks wanted with you? They seem to be about to do a ritual of some sort." bowl boy asked curiously.</p><p>"It wasn't me they were interested in. They wanted what I hold." Yuugito said quietly and with bitterness as she rose to her feet, glaring at the frozen forms of her kidnappers before turning her gaze on the massive thing and the shadowy forms perched on its towering fingers.</p><p>"What you hold?" Luna asked curiously.</p><p>Yuugito stiffened slightly and turned to face them, her chin jutting proudly as she prepared herself for their reactions. "I'm the container of the two-tailed bijuu."</p><p>"Bijuu?" tea boy asked curiously.</p><p>"Oh, yeah, I remember now…they're like giant animals made of chakra. There's nine altogether. One attacked the Leaf village the day Naruto…" cook boy trailed off his eyes widening in sudden understanding as he seemed to have an epiphany of some sort. "Oh! Everything suddenly makes so much more sense now! I never could understand why… though it still doesn't really explain…but I guess they were still afraid or something…but still!"</p><p>"For those of us who can't read minds?" Luna prodded.</p><p>"I think Naruto must be the host of the nine-tailed fox. That storekeeper we went to the cops about said he was vicious, bloodthirsty demon and so she was perfectly in her rights to treat him however she wanted. We both just thought she was a mean, crazy old lady at the time… that has to be it. He was born the day of the attack, and he has marks on his face that sort of look like whiskers."</p><p>"Your friend fishcake is a host?" Yuugito interrupted.</p><p>"I think he must be, though he had no idea. They must have made it a secret, though everyone old enough to remember the attack knew and many seemed to be holding a grudge about it, which is dumb. Naruto was a baby, a newborn baby at that, the day it happened. He lost both his parents and then grew up alone with people being mean to him for no reason that he knew. We were friends when we were kids. I'm an orphan as well, so I stepped in to help him out." he explained.</p><p>His eyes grew cold as he turned to look back at the monstrous wooden statue and the shadow figures perched on it.</p><p>"Do you have any idea if they're just after hosts in general or was it your bijuu in particular they wanted? We came here to visit my childhood friend in Konoha, though obviously we missed our mark by quite a bit. If these guys are likely to be after him I'd like to be able to warn him… That’s if they haven't gotten him already." he added, voice heavy.</p><p>"That thing has nine eyes… and two of them are open… I'll say that's a yes on them being after all of them. What the hell is that thing anyway?" Yuugito could feel the two-tails roiling restlessly under her skin… "Gedo…mazo?" Yuugito repeated, not sure she'd heard right</p><p>"Demonic statue of the outer path? That doesn't make me feel better." cook boy said sarcastically.</p><p>"How do you think I feel!" Yuugito grumbled back.</p><p> </p><p>After studying the memory of the cave extensively, they regrouped in the living room. Everyone seemed to realize at that point that they hadn't introduced themselves, with the exception of Luna. They got that out of the way and then got to work putting together what they knew.</p><p>"It's a shame most of them weren't there in person. We only have a rough idea of what any of them look like." Neville noted as he went through the sketches Tom had made earlier while going over the memory.</p><p>"We know they're all wearing those black cloaks with the red clouds, they're likely all wearing spats, and have their finger and toenails painted. They all have a ring that corresponds to the glowing symbol on the statue's fingers where they stand for their sealing ritual. And we were able to get village symbols for most of them. That's still something." Luna disagreed.</p><p>"It is something." Yuugito assured her. "Likely if the village of origin were to be contacted they could at least make a good guess as to who it's likely to be. This fellow here" she pointed to one of the sketches "I think might be Kisame Hoshigaki. He used to be one of the Seven Swordsmen of Mist Village. I saw his entry in the bingo book, and I'm pretty sure that's him."</p><p>"What about the two that were there in person? The ones that attacked you?" Tom asked.</p><p>"Them I'm actually not sure about. I don't remember seeing an entry for the masked guy, and the other guy is wearing the mark of a village I don't recognize. The masked guy at least seems to be from Waterfall. They must have some record of him somewhere."</p><p>She looked over the rest of the sketches. Her hand hovered over one of them before gently lifting it.</p><p>"This can't be possible… He has the eyes of the Sage…though the two tails said they're wrong somehow… it must be a trick. I guess whoever it is wants to trade in on the stories of the Sage of the Six Paths to enhance his reputation or something. Rain village. The only strong ninja I can recall offhand from Rain is Hanzo, but that isn't him."</p><p>"That's good to… Tom?" Harry asked, seeing him distracted.</p><p>"Just a moment. I felt something on the wards I put up." Tom said as he rose and left the cabin.</p><p>Yuugito followed them tensely. She was not going to let those bastards take her a second time. She looked curiously at the cabin as they exited. It must be a summon of some sort--a weird but very useful one, whatever it was. Fully furnished and it seemed to be bigger on the inside. They were inside a cave. She found the others gathered at the mouth of the cave behind a barrier of some sort.</p><p>"What did you feel, exactly? Did someone try to come in?"Neville wondered.</p><p>"No. It was a small ripple, it just happened to catch my attention…there. Look. There's something going on out there."</p><p>"Let me see." Yuugito ordered.</p><p>She put a hand on the barrier, but it let her pass. She stayed low as she crept out, not wanting to attract any attention until she knew what was going on.</p><p>"Oh no… they'll kill them." she whispered when she saw the culprits.</p><p>Harry crept out next to her and grimaced at the battle going on further down at the base of the next mountain. "Friends of yours?" he asked.</p><p>"They're a team from Cloud. I don't know if they're looking for me, or they just had the bad luck to run into those guys. They might have attacked them thinking they had me. They're all capable ninja, but those guys took me down with less trouble than I'd like to admit. I can't just leave them."</p><p>"Give us a sec and we'll drop you down."</p><p>"Way ahead of you. Let's go." Neville said as he came out behind them and unrolled the carpet.</p><p>"We'll stay out of the way, but we'll try to hit them if we get an opening." Luna assured her.</p><p>Tom came out last and removed the barrier, which she saw now had an illusion to hide the cave they'd been in.</p><p>The carpet rose and swooped down enough that Yuugito was able to leap off and transform. "Holy shit." Harry said gleefully as they swooped upward. Tom grabbed the back of his shirt to keep him from tumbling off in his enthusiasm.</p><p>"She's a giant glowy blue cat! That is so awesome!"</p><p> </p><p>The Cloud ninjas got a second wind when they saw the glowy chakra monster descending to help them.</p><p>"Uh…that guy just turned into a skeleton…well, not really but…" Neville spoke up.</p><p>"He looks like he's done up in Halloween make-up. He just stabbed himself." Harry noted bemusedly.</p><p>"And that guy screamed when he did… and he's got a hole in his stomach in the same place he just stabbed himself." Tom pointed out.</p><p>"He's on a seal drawn in blood. We need to knock him off that." Harry agreed. "We should probably try to get the guy too. He's going to bleed out otherwise."</p><p>"The other guy keeps spawning tentacle monsters out of his back. One of them just shot a fireball at the ninjas." Luna noted idly.</p><p>"I'm sure they can handle it. Quick, while cat lady is between us and skeleton guy. Knock him off the seal before you do anything else." Tom said tersely.</p><p>Luna nodded and levitated the guy and flung him. Neville took careful aim and knocked him out before bringing the carpet down so Harry could retrieve the hurt ninja.</p><p>Harry glanced back at all of them and moved to the skeleton guy first, shooting a quick cutting curse at him to remove his head before doing so, his jaw and shoulders tight, before hurrying to the downed Cloud ninja who was swiftly bleeding out. All of them twitched in horror when the decapitated head woke up and started yelling at them.</p><p>"You asshole! Was it you that cut my motherfucking head off? I'm going to rip you limb from limb as soon as my head gets put back on! Motherfucking piece of shit!"</p><p>"Tom!" Harry pled as he struggled to keep the ninja alive long enough for it to be safe to move him.</p><p>"Just a moment." Tom muttered.</p><p>He pulled a bottomless bag from one of his pockets, then put it back and dug around some more. "What?" he said off Luna's look. "I don't want a creepy talking head in there. He'd probably bite me when I tried to pull it out again. Ah, here we go. This will work much better."</p><p>He eyed the battle still going on a bit further down warily as he hopped off the carpet and moved towards the head. He flicked his wand at the body, which was still motionless and impaled with several black rods like those they'd pulled from cat girl earlier. The thing's headband, which he'd been wearing around his neck when he still had one, flew over to land on the head, untied itself, settled on its forehead and retied itself to hold it in place. He ignored the head's indignant sputtering and turned back to the body. The head began screaming and cursing a blue streak when its body went up in flames. Tom unrolled the empty containment scroll he'd pulled free and channeled a bit of magic into it, smiling in satisfaction when the head and headband vanished and a symbol for 'head' appeared in the empty space in the center of the seal. A thud and a flare of light behind him made him jump and twist in place.</p><p>One of the tentacle monsters had crept up on them while miss kitty and the other three ninjas were occupied with the rest and had shot lightning at them. Neville had moved the carpet so he and Luna could shield themselves, himself and Harry while they were otherwise occupied. Tom grimaced at the thing, which seemed to just be a mass of writhing tentacles hanging from a mask face. He shot an overpowered bombarda at the mask and grimaced again when it shattered, spewing blood everywhere and released a smell reminiscent of a charnel house while it did so.</p><p>"Come to the ninja world, he said. It'll be fun, he said." Tom grumbled as he climbed back aboard the carpet.</p><p>"I said it should be exciting. Was I lying?" Harry quipped as he climbed aboard as well, tipping the hurt ninja boy off his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So what's with you anyway?" Ino demanded. "You started getting twitchy a while ago. What gives?"</p><p>"I'm not sure." Shikamaru admitted. "I woke up because I felt like something changed…but I have no idea what or how. I suppose I might have been dreaming."</p><p>"See? If you'd stay awake once in a while you wouldn't have to worry about being woken up by strange dreams."</p><p>"Troublesome."</p><p>"Ah, leave him alone Ino. You know he needs plenty of sleep to keep that enormous brain of his running." Choji chortled, kicking Shikamaru playfully in the leg when he flipped him off.</p><p>"Who else is coming? It's not just going to be us, right?" Ino asked, changing the subject.</p><p>"You're a sensor. Can't you just check and see who else is in town?"</p><p>"I'm taking a leaf from Shika's book. I'm being lazy." Ino said cheerfully as she stretched her back out, and then let herself flop down beside Shikamaru where he was reclining beneath the tree, watching the clouds. Chouji smiled at them both fondly as he dug out another bag of chips.</p><p>"Greetings! Team Gai reporting for the most-youthful comrades picnic!" a manic figure in green announced as he appeared in the clearing.</p><p>"Lee, damn it! How can you still have so much energy?!" a pretty girl with brown hair secured in buns to either side of her head complained as she staggered into the clearing as well. A silent, stoic figure in white kept pace behind her--Ten Ten and Neji Hyuga.</p><p> </p><p>They had all first met Ten Ten and Neji when they'd ended up helping them battle Danzo 'the mummy man' Shimura and his goons years before. Ten Ten had been practicing nearby and heard the commotion and decided to help out by flinging kunai at the goons as they chased them. Neji had also been practicing, though in his case he was practicing with his Byakugan and had spotted Hinata pummeling a fake ANBU and had raced over to help out. They all owed the two of them a debt; their timely interference had probably done a lot to help keep all of them alive long enough for the adults in the village to get there.</p><p>Hinata had later confided to Ino that their battle that day, and Neji's involvement, had helped begin the process of healing a rift that had formed in her family four years prior when her uncle Hizashi, Neji's father, had been killed in the wake of a kidnapping attempt on herself by Cloud.</p><p>Lee, the third of their group, none of them had met until he'd become part of Neji and Ten Ten's team when they all graduated the Academy. He had fit right in, for all that he was a bit odd; he was friendly, good-hearted and dedicated, not to mention lethal with his taijutsu when he went all out. He was a good guy to have at your back, something they all appreciated about him.</p><p>"So…what did Gai-sensei have you doing today?" Choji asked warily.</p><p>"We've been on a training journey! We've just arrived back! We ran twenty miles every morning before breakfast with a backpack full of heavy rocks on our backs and then sparred for an hour! After eating, we sparred for two more hours and then climbed a mountain one-handed with boulders hanging from our feet! We then climbed down with the other arm and then had lunch…after that…" Lee began excitedly.</p><p>"Stop. Please. I'm exhausted just listening to you!" Shikamaru complained.</p><p>"Yeah, really. It's no wonder you're such a strong team with a work ethic like that!" Ino agreed, sounding faint.</p><p>"Hey! Why all the long faces? It's because I wasn't here, wasn't it? Well, I'm here now, so everyone get happy!" a smiling figure announced as he leapt down from a tree and landed in the clearing with them.</p><p>"Shisui-niichan!" Ino, Ten Ten, Chouji and Lee chorused. "Shisui-san." Neji and Shikamaru said at the same time.</p><p>"Ack! My adorable little minions don’t love me anymore! How cruel!" Shisui flailed dramatically, as he fixed Neji and Shikamaru with an artful pout. Neji gave him a flat look in return, while Shikamaru just sighed and muttered 'troublesome'.</p><p>"Ah, and here come my adorable baby-cousins!"</p><p>"Shisui" Sasuke nodded.</p><p>"Shisui…niichan" Sai added when he started looking sad, only to sigh when Shisui pounced on him to coo about what an adorable baby-minion cousin he was, though he didn't actually protest or pull away from him.</p><p>Sai had been a member of Root, Danzo's illegal secret army. When he and the other children were rescued from the hidden base they all were stashed in, all those who were unknown were given genetic testing to find family if they had it. The Uchiha clan had taken one look at Sai and had known him for one of theirs. There had been widespread consternation when testing revealed Sai to be Mikoto Uchiha's half-brother, making him Sasuke and Itachi's uncle, and brother in law to the clan head, Fugaku.</p><p>Mikoto was outraged that her father's remains had been violated and had been heard lamenting that Danzo was already dead as she'd quite like to kill him again. Sai was quickly hustled home with Mikoto, who had been surprised but not displeased to get a brand-new little brother at her age.</p><p>Sai hadn't wanted to be parted from the boy he'd grown up thinking of as his brother, Shin.</p><p>Shin turned out of be a Hatake. Kakashi had already fled for the hills when told he had relatives, two of them who were both children, so Mikoto agreed to take him in as well, at least, once he'd gotten out of the hospital. He'd been suffering from a disease that had nearly proven fatal as it had gone untreated. Danzo had felt medical care for shinobi--other than himself, naturally--was a waste of resources.</p><p>"Sasuke-kun! Sai-kun!" Ino cooed in welcome. "Where's everyone else?"</p><p>"Shin is on a mission, Sakura is working a shift at the hospital, and Naruto had some Uzumaki business to take care of." Sai informed them as he sat down.</p><p>He and Sasuke each added the food they were carrying to the blanket laid out in the center of the clearing.</p><p>"Ooops. I forgot to add ours." Ten Ten said with some embarrassment. She popped out a storage scroll and unloaded Team Gai's share of the meal.</p><p>"Uzumaki business?" Shikamaru asked curiously.</p><p>"Tsunade-sama went on a bender and cleaned out their clan account. They all went to the bank to find out what happened." Sasuke grumbled. "It shouldn't have. Tsunade is a Senju even if her grandmother was an Uzumaki. She shouldn't have had access to the thing. They're all really mad--not just because the money is missing, but because they needed it. They've all been saving for a while now to get their home remodeled. The contractors were supposed to be coming in a few days, but now they don't have the money to pay them for all the work they wanted done."</p><p>"Oh no. What are they going to do? If they've been saving for a while, I'm guessing just taking a few extra missions isn't going to cut it?" Lee fretted.</p><p>"Not likely. Naruto's not too worried. They all pooled their most recent mission pay when they found out. Naruto sent a clone to hit the casinos. His luck with gambling is as good as Tsunade's is bad; he's pretty sure he can manage to win all or most of it back, it's just the principle of the matter."</p><p>"It would be nice if we could count on Jiraiya-sama to keep her out of trouble, but he's just as bad." Ten Ten said gloomily.</p><p>"A drunk and a pervert. I cannot help but wonder why the Third was so cruel as to inflict the two of them on Hokage-sama as his first councilors." Neji muttered.</p><p>"Whatever their personal failings might be, they have no interest in hunting down my clan for their eyes, in raising up a secret army beneath Konoha, or any of the other nonsense the last bunch of councilors did, which makes them excellent as far as I'm concerned." Sasuke muttered.</p><p>"He also needed to do something to push his chosen successor through the vetting process. It made folks like the Daimyo and the civilian council feel more secure in the new Hokage, since he's still so young. Jiraiya and Tsunade still have a fearsome reputation, and neither one wanted to be the Hokage themselves. He got them to come back and use their reps to bolster the new Hokage until he was firmly established, and they have been helping clean house." Shisui interjected.</p><p>"Ah, enough of village politics! It's a beautiful day, and we're all here together. That never lasts long. We should enjoy the time while we have it." Ino spoke up firmly.</p><p>"And we should definitely eat!" Chouji added with a grin.</p><p>"That sounds like a good idea!" Lee agreed.</p><p>"Neji-nissan!" Neji, who had been about to join the others sitting around the food, turned at the call and stumbled back when Hinata suddenly pounced on him. Hinata's cheeks were pink, her eyes were sparkling, and her smile could rival the sun.</p><p>"Hinata-sama?"</p><p>"I did it!" she squealed.</p><p>The whole group watched entranced as Neji's normally stoic face creased in a fond, helpless smile. "Well done."</p><p>"What's going on?" Ino demanded.</p><p>"Hinata did well on our last mission." Shino informed every one as he and Kiba strolled into the clearing.</p><p>"She kicked ass, you mean!" Kiba enthused, as he joined everyone around the blanket and dropped off the pork buns they'd brought.</p><p>"Hinata-sama has mastered the eight trigrams one hundred and twenty eight palms." Neji explained with obvious pride.</p><p>"I had a good teacher." Hinata insisted, beaming at him. Neji seemed momentarily stupefied and he turned away, obviously trying to maintain his stoic façade in the face of her enthusiasm.</p><p>"We should join everyone before Chouji starves to death." he said rather than reply. "Ah, nevermind. He seems to have started without us." he added dryly.</p><p>"Sorry. I can't resist Hinata's pork buns!" Chouji apologized.</p><p>Neji seemed to be working very hard to not melt into a pile of goo as Hinata's beaming smile kicked up a notch at the compliment to her cooking. Truthfully, a lot of them were having similar trouble. The very air around her seemed to be sparkling from the force of her happiness.</p><p>A red flash popped into the clearing and resolved into Naruto and his cousin, Karin Uzumaki, who looked a bit green around the gills.</p><p>"I hate travelling like that!"</p><p>"We would have missed all the food if we walked!" Naruto pointed out.</p><p>Karin had once been a ninja for Grass village. They had all met her during their first Chunin exams. Karin had special chakra that allowed one to heal even grievous injuries if you bit her and devoured a bit of her chakra. Her mother's chakra had been the same. Her mother had died from severe chakra exhaustion--Grass had no real medical care beyond biting her for healing, and they had used her up until she died, then drug her then-ten year old daughter out of her bed in the middle of the night and thrust her into the hospital so she could take her place. Naruto had been horrified to find family, only to discover the horrible life she'd been living and had asked her to stay. She had jumped at the chance and never looked back.</p><p>She had joined the other lost Uzumakis--Naruto himself and three children of Danzo's root--and it was soon like she had always been there. The five of them had lived in the Uchiha district for several years, but they recently petitioned for clan status and been granted the land and house that had once belonged to Mito Uzumaki-Senju and Kushina Uzumaki, as well as the relics of Whirlpool that had been squirreled away by Danzo.</p><p>They had been saving up money for years to be able to fix everything up just the way they wanted when their petition was eventually granted…only for Tsunade to clean out the account and go on a drinking and gambling spree. If she had won big, she would have at least been able to pay them back. Sadly, Tsunade was known as the Legendary Sucker for a reason. Her bad luck in gambling was infamous. She'd been deeply in debt all across the Elemental Nations when she'd been forced back to the village. It had taken her years to pay off her creditors. She really should have questioned it when she found what she thought was a sudden unexpected windfall--a half-million ryo she didn't know about, but she was as impulsive as she was unlucky, and had simply grabbed the money and ran with it, only to return a week later with a sore head, a sick stomach, and a new pile of debts to her name.</p><p>"You both made it. So? What's the verdict? How did it even happen?" Sasuke demanded as the two of them sat down in the spaces opened up for them.</p><p>"The jerk at the bank reopened an old account, Mito-baachan's to be exact, rather than set up a new one. Tsunade-baachan, her brother and my mom were all on the account along with Mito-baachan as authorized people. He didn't take any of them off, he just added all of us. Tsunade-baachan cleaned out that account years ago, but went and checked it to see if there was anything left in it when she was short on money after paying off the last of her creditors. She got real excited when she found a bunch of money in there and didn't question it, and they let her take it because she was on it as being authorized for withdrawals. Stupid bastard. We made him close out the old account and forced him to give us ten percent interest for a year on the new just-us account we opened, and then I made a big deposit with my gambling winnings, and the bounties my clones decided to pick up while they were out running around. We're actually better off than we were before Tsunade-baachan robbed us, so we've decided not to kill her."Naruto explained.</p><p>"We're still going to make her suffer though." Karin disagreed.</p><p>"Well, yeah, that goes without saying. Drunken old hag." Naruto grunted.</p><p>"Wait, bounties?" Shikamaru interrupted. "You sent a bunch of clones out to gamble and they decided to pick up bounties while they were out?" he demanded with tired disbelief.</p><p>"Well, yeah. See, I sent one clone and he used our mission pay to win big and then he left the casino, made three clones that disguised themselves, split the winnings and they all spread out to hit a couple different casinos at the same time. They all won big, so they each made three clones and did it again. There was like twenty five of us by the time we were done. We were in a field outside town giving all our winnings to Gamakichi--he's one of my toad summons--and some jerks decided they were going to rob all of us. They followed us when they saw us each win big. Naturally we beat the hell out of all of them, and then we realized a couple of them looked familiar. I turned them in to the nearest bounty station, and reported it to the headman's office in the town. It turns out they'd just sent a mission to Konoha to take care of those guys because they kept preying on folks as they were leaving and they were afraid it would ruin their tourist trade. They were real impressed that Konoha seemingly responded so swiftly, so they gave me a bonus. I told Hokage-niichan when I got back, so I got the mission pay too. They'd just gotten it and it hadn't been handed out to anyone yet. I think I got a commendation in my record for good PR work too." Naruto explained.</p><p>"Only you, Naruto." Shikamaru groaned.</p><p>The all glanced up when a rather majestic snowy owl swooped down from above and circled them before seemingly honing in on Naruto and diving towards him. Naruto squawked in panic and threw an arm up, thinking it was diving for his eyes, only to relax slightly when she landed on his arm and flung her wings out to balance herself. That's when he noticed there was a tiny message tube on one of her legs.</p><p>"A message for me?"</p><p>"Preck." the owl agreed. There was a distinct sense of 'duh, genius' behind the sound.</p><p>Naruto pouted at it in disbelief. It was bad enough he had the Kyuubi in his gut sassing him regularly, he didn't need random owls doing it too.</p><p>"Hold her still. I'll get it." Sasuke offered.</p><p>He handed Naruto the tube when it was removed and then stole the owl.</p><p>"Look at you, beautiful. You're definitely not from around here. Are you hungry?" he cooed to it.</p><p>Naruto huffed at him, and decided to ignore them both. The tube opened and he withdrew a tightly rolled paper that really shouldn't have fit in there which proved to have an intricate storage seal inked across its length.</p><p>"Lovely work." Karin noted, eyeing it. When released, a stack of papers with a rolled up scroll popped out. Naruto picked up the scroll and opened it, half expecting to find another storage seal, but it was actually a letter.</p><p>Karin picked up the stack of papers and began looking through them in confusion. It was a series of pictures, though most were just silhouettes in a cloud-covered cloak. They all seemed to be missing nin to judge by the struck out symbols on the forehead protectors. Behind the last of the silhouettes were three pictures with the details filled in-- a freaky plant guy with a bi-colored face, and two more missing nin that were deceased, all in the cloud cloaks that the rest were. Behind that was a disturbing picture of a freaky…thing…with manacled hands that seemed to have tiny figures perched on its fingertips and symbols in place of fingernails. Behind that was a sketch of two rings, each with a different symbol atop it. There was another seal on that page. Karin opened it and found herself with a two-inch black rod of some sort. There was a note above the seal that said it was a 'bijuu subduing, chakra disrupting rod of unknown origin' She shivered and put it back. The last page was a picture of a giant blue cat with black markings and two tails, seated beside a bull-octopus thing that seemed to be shadowing a woman and man from Cloud that simply said 'Matatabi and Gyuuki with Yuugito and B'. Still confused, she turned to Naruto to see if he knew what all of it was. She found her cousin smiling so hard his face looked about ready to split in two.</p><p>"Naruto?"</p><p>"It's from Hari! I told you about him, remember?"</p><p>"Hari? Wait…that's the ghost boy that used to possess Shikamaru?"</p><p>"What's this?" Shikamaru spoke up, hearing his name.</p><p>"Hari! He came to visit, and he brought friends! He said their gateway opened up in a weird place and they ended up rescuing the two-tails jinchuuriki from having her bijuu stolen. They grabbed her and ran for it, but some of the guys chased them and ended up running into a Cloud team, so they went and helped them. They managed to take out the two guys, but some of the Cloud nins were hurt, so they took them back to their village. He has a flying carpet! How cool is that? Anyway, they got them back and hung out with B and Yuugito--they're the jinchuurikis of the two and eight tails, apparently. He said they're on their way along with a Cloud team the Raikage sent along to escort them and bring a message to the Hokage. He's probably going to call a Kage summit or something. He sent along what they know about the guys that kidnapped Yuugito so I'd know to keep an eye out for them. He figured out about the nine-tails after talking to her and he's worried about me." he said with a relieved smile.</p><p>"Of course he is, dumbass. He's your friend, who apparently traveled across worlds to see you. Somebody who does that isn't going to be put off by a little thing you having a giant chakra beast stuffed in your gut." Shikamaru said with bored disinterest, though his voice was gentle.</p>
