<p>Mikey pushed his foot against the ancient stone, grunting as he shoved with all his eleven year old might.</p>
<p>A long, gritty dragging sound later, and the ages old secret door popped open- swinging out on its invisible hinges and releasing a cloud of tunnel dust with it.</p>
<p>Mikey lost his footing when it did, and slid out the slanted tunnel with a yelp. Thankfully, the house elves of the Ravenclaw towers hadn’t done laundry yet that day, and Mikey landed with a soft <em>"pomf!” </em>on someone’s pile of dirty sheets.</p>
<p>Face down.</p>
<p>
  <em>Eugh.</em>
</p>
<p>Mikey hurriedly sat up, wiping his mouth to get rid of the taste of dusty sheets. The room was empty, like he thought it would be, so he sat for a moment on the dirty laundry.</p>
<p>Now which bed was his brother’s again…?</p>
<p>It only took a moment to find the one covered in books and discarded robes. Donnie’s room looked similar at home, but with even more beakers of potions on the side tables. Maybe a few dozen more books.</p>
<p>Mikey stood up, dusting off his very dirty robes, and reached back up into the passage he’d fallen from. His fingers scrabbled for a moment on the stone, and then found the end of his bag. Mikey tugged it down, catching it in his arms.</p>
<p>To business then.</p>
<p>He kicked his way out of the laundry pile, headed straight for his brother’s bed. Donnie was in class, same as practically every other student, so he wouldn’t be back for hours.</p>
<p>Mikey was technically supposed to be in class too, but he had more important things to do than school work.</p>
<p>Besides, sneaking through his network of secret passages was <em>way</em> more fun than listening to Magical History.</p>
<p>Mikey opened Donnie’s trunk, and started shuffling through the items inside. Book, book, collection of quills, more books, <em>ooh-</em> a definitely illegal dark magic looking thing, more books-</p>
<p>Mikey let out a quiet “<em>ah ha!”</em>, and pulled out what he’d been looking for.</p>
<p>A huge tome looking book, heavy enough it made his arms droop. Wrapped in thick brown twine, and looking like it was at least a hundred years old. It was definitely something Donnie would own.</p>
<p>Of course, what was inside wasn’t <em>quite</em> what one would expect to find in a book.</p>
<p>Mikey opened it, the enchanted binding around it unwinding at his touch, and grinned at the contents.</p>
<p>Packaged sweets, smuggled in under their father’s watchful eye. All for the taking.</p>
<p>Technically, Mikey wasn’t supposed to take from Donnie’s stash without asking. Technically, he shouldn’t have been able to get into the Ravenclaw quarters at all. Technically, Mikey didn’t care about any of that.</p>
<p>And besides, he’d brought stuff to replace the coveted sweets. Donnie needed more variety anyways.</p>
<p>Turned out, Herbology was good for something after all!</p>
<p>Mikey put down the still opened tome of candy, and opened his bag instead. To make room, you see.</p>
<p>One quick empty and refilling of his bag later, and Mikey slunk back into the stone entrance, shutting it behind him with another grating grind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Donnie stared at the mess on his bed.</p>
<p>He’d come to get his next class’ work books. Not deal with <em>this.</em></p>
<p>“Why are there squash and cucumbers in my bed?” Donnie asked aloud. “And tomatoes too for that matter.”</p>
<p>April- who wasn’t quite supposed to be in his room, but they didn’t care about that rule much- peered around Donnie to look at the vegetables. “Maybe one of the house elves decided to get a sense of humor?”</p>
<p>Donnie pursed his lips, and steepled his fingers. “Yeah, but <em>why</em>.”</p>
<p>“Don’t know. They probably think you don’t eat enough greens.”</p>
<p>“None of these are what's typically categorized as 'greens' though.”</p>
<p>April shrugged.</p>
<p>Donnie stared again at his bed.</p>
<p>“Just- <em>why??”</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He didn’t find the half empty tome until later, and couldn’t figure out at all how they’d been pilfered.</p>
<p>He knew who’d done it though, even if Mikey gave him a particularly innocent smile when Donnie glared at him across the dining hall.</p>
