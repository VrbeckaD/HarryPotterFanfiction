    <p>A 21-year-old man with messy jet-black hair and wearing round glasses is standing next to a young, also 21-year-old woman, with fiery red hair and beautiful green eyes. The man was currently cringing in pain as his wife held a death grip on his hand, while the woman screamed at the top of her lungs. The two men next to the jet-black haired man could only wince. One had a lean build with an attractive face to woo the ladies. The other was scruffy-looking, but his eyes had a gentleness that spoke of kindness and friendship.</p><p>“JAMES! WHY?!? WHY DOESN’T THE WIZARDING WORLD HAVE NO PAINKILLERS FOR THIS?!?” The young woman screamed, as Medi-Witches cast spell after spell to help the bedridden woman, with very little effects.</p><p>“Lil’s, *gasp*, the Wizarding World has never *groan* heard of what you suggest.” James trailed off as his wife continued to squeeze his hand harder.</p><p>“AHHHHHHH! I SWEAR JAMES I’M GOING TO RIP YOUR BALLS OFF WITH MY BARE HANDS!!!” Lily screamed.</p><p>The two men paled in horror and backed away from James as James cupped his own genitals and praying to Merlin that she was joking.</p><p>“You can do it Mrs. Potter, I can see the head, keep pushing.” The lead Medi-Witch encourages.</p><p>At 11:53 p.m. the first child was born. At 11:59 p.m. the second child was born. The first boy had a tuft a fiery red hair with James’ eyes. While the other had a tuft of messy pitch-black hair with Lily eyes.</p><p>“Congratulations Mr. and Mrs. Potter, you have two healthy little boys. Given the slight differences, they are Fraternal,” said the Lead Medi-Witch, while wrapping the second born in a blanket and handing him to James, while Lily held the first.</p><p>“Oh, James, look at them. Their so beautiful.” Lily said, as tears cascaded down her cheeks. “They’ll charm the whole school when they turn 11.”</p><p>James chuckled, rocking his second born son, “No doubt about that, Lil’s. Both of them will make all the other boys jealous.” James turned to the two men in the back, Sirius and Remus. “And of course, their uncles will help.”</p><p>Sirius chuckled lightly, “Of course we will, James. They can’t go to Hogwarts without knowing how to properly prank everyone.”</p><p>Remus sighed, “Looks like I’ll have to be the male role model for them if James and Sirius are going to act like man-children.”</p><p>Unknown to them all, five faint lights appeared in the room and hovered over the two boys, spinning rapidly. The five colorful orbs glowed faintly, while observing the two boys. Before finally reaching a decision and enter the body of the green-eyed babe. Faintly appearing on the boy’s chest, covered by the baby blanket a blue circle glows brightly with a chained serpent with wings, then fades away. Followed by a rich green circle with the shape of a tree appears next, then fades into the skin. The third is white and takes the shape of a feline with strange orbs that circle the body, before fading away. A red circle with the shape of a large bird appears, then fades. And a gold circle appears last, with a distinct dragon shape glows brightly and fades away, none of the people in the room, the wiser because of it.</p><p>“Ugh, boys.” Lily says, ignoring her husband’s and Sirius’ quiet protests, as the two boy’s fall asleep. The green-eyed babe smiling from the warmth he felt.</p><p>Remus cleared his throat, “Well Prongs, what are their names?” Sirius was shaking with excitement, waiting for the answer.</p><p>James smiled at the his oldest, when he and Lily exchanged their sons. “Hmm, I think my mini-duplicate should be Charles James Potter. In honour of my father.”</p><p>Lily smiled widely, looking down at her youngest, “And he will be Harry Ignotus Potter. His first name in honour of my Father.”</p><p>“Charles and Harry… their perfect.” Sirius said.</p><p>Lily kissed the top of Harry’s head, “No matter what happens, I’ll always love you both.” Sirius made a slight gagging noise, making Lily send a wandless stinging hex to the man, who yelps at the spell hitting his most precious area, while James and Remus struggle to burst out laughing in front of the two sleeping babies.<br/>
-<br/>
15 months later</p><p>“Lily! It’s him! Take Charles and Harry! Go! I’ll hold him off!” James screams in a panicked voice.</p><p>Lily heard his shout and quickly grabbed her son’s and ran to the Nursery. Holding her children tightly she tried desperately to apparate out. Upon seeing herself frozen in place, she knew that the evil wizard had placed an anti-apparation charm around the house. Forgoing the Portkey, because that was likely blocked too, Lily set both her boys in the crib and began casting the most powerful shield spells and wards she knew. Then casting a disillusionment charm around the crib and ran down to help her husband, only to see him being flung back and hit the wall, letting out a loud pained grunt and falling to the floor unconscious.</p><p>Lily stopped as Voldemort stepped around the corner and saw her at the bottom of the stairs, then he smirked, “Your foolish husband thought he could beat me without a wand. Are you going to try the same?” he laughed cruelly.</p><p>Lily whipped out her wand and launched a powerful exploding curse at the vile man, only for the spell to be blocked by a shield.</p><p>Voldemort laughed, “I commend you for trying to kill me, instead of holding me back. I would kill you, but someone begged me to spare you. And I dare not kill your husband, I need to try to save as much Pure-Blooded wizards as possible.” Voldemort cast a silent and wandless stunning charm, Lily falling to the ground in a boneless heap.</p><p>Voldemort walked around the pathetic muggle and headed upstairs, looking for the room with the one who could defeat him. Checking each room carefully, it was the last that was clearly designed for babies that caught his attention.</p><p>He could feel the protective magic in the room, such a shame that a mudblooded whore was allied to the light, rather than his side. Voldemort dispelled the protections and stared at the two babes. Both were looking at him and crying, calling out for their mommy and daddy.</p><p>He looked closely at the two, but did not know who was the one destined to kill him. Wormtail was not present when the mudblood gave birth, so he did not know who was born last. Voldemort shrugged and pointed his wand at the green-eyed babe first. There was something about his eyes that unsettled him. “One of these brats is destined to kill me… HA. As if I’ll even allow that to happen. AVADA KEDAVRA!” Voldemort shouted. His wand glowing a sickly green and launched at Harry.</p><p>Just before the green light struck, five brilliant orbs appeared. The green and white one forming a powerful protective barrier in front of the boy. While the blue and red clash and pushed back the killing curse. The golden light shines brightly, igniting the room in a precious warmth. Voldemort screams at the sudden brightness and covers his eyes, as his curse is destroyed.</p><p>The lights hear Harry’s terrified cries and react accordingly. All five launch toward the dark man and pierce his body. One through the neck, the heart, the head, the chest, and the stomach. Then exiting the man and growing even brighter, until the dark man screams as his body is torn apart, while being burned to ashes.</p><p>A dark spirit emerges, howling in rage and flees the room. The five orbs glow brightly, before surrounding Harry again and sinking within his skin once more. Harry feels weak and falls to his side as parts of the ceiling fall. Harry loses consciousness. A small wooden board falls from the ceiling and cuts into Charles' cheek, engraving an L onto it. Charles cries at the sudden pain and turn and clings to his brother.</p><p>Aftermath</p><p>Albus shows up, as his devices informing him that the house had been breached. Albus quickly banishes the Fidelius Charm and turns in a readied stance at the loud cracking noise to his left. Sirius comes running, only to stop to see Albus with his wand pointed at him, “Albus, it’s me.” Sirius says cautiously.</p><p>Albus narrows his eyes, “What was the first prank you ever pulled on Minerva?”</p><p>Sirius paused, then shook his head, “I swear, Mad-Eye is rubbing off on everyone.” He muttered, before looking at Albus again, “When Minerva showed off her Animagus form, James and I charmed her fur bright pink and bright orange for a whole week.”</p><p>Albus relaxed his stance and gestured for Sirius to follow him. Both quickly ran inside and see James’ body lying next to the couch. Sirius cries out and rushes to James’ side. Taking out his wand and casting a few charms, Sirius sighs in relief, “He’s alive, just knocked out.” Looking at Albus, who nods and heads to the stairway. Sirius quickly heals James’ wounds and awakens the man.</p><p>James snapped awake and looked at Sirius, blinking a few times, the grabbing Sirius’ arms, “Sirius, it was Pettigrew! He…” he said, before Sirius cuts him off.</p><p>“I know.” Sirius responded, his eyes darkening, “and I promise James, he won’t get away with it.”</p><p>James nods, then sits up abruptly. “Lily!”</p><p>“She’s fine James.” Albus said, walking around the corner and holding Lily, who had regained consciousness. James sighed in relief. “Quickly now, we need to check your sons.” James nods to the old man and the four quickly make their way upstairs. Bursting into the small room, they see Harry sound asleep with Charles shaking his brother and calling out “Harwy!”, while his cheek bled. Albus casts a spell and see’s that both boy’s magical cores are very low.</p><p>“They’re both fine.” Albus said, as sighs of relief are heard, “It would seem that both boys were able to stop Voldemort and end his reign. Though I cannot say which one struck the final blow.”</p><p>Lily quickly stop Charles’ cheek from bleeding and wipes away the blood. When she tried to close the wound, it only scarred over leaving a very prominent “L” in its place. Albus strodes over and looks closely. Then he stood back up and nods his head. “This confirms it. Charles James Potter has vanquished Voldemort and ended his terrible reign. He is the Boy-Who-Lived." James and Sirius look at Charles in surprise and pride. Lily smiles at her oldest son, while rocking her youngest as he sleeps soundly in her arms.<br/>

1985</p><p>The Potter Family. Perfect, Famous, Powerful. That is how the Wizarding World viewed the Potter family. Magically they were strong, and they were very wealthy as the Potter family has existed for over fifteen generations. Even the most powerful and political families will agree that the Potter family is strong. For it is within this house, back in Potter Manor, that the Boy-Who-Lived resides.</p><p>Yes, Charles James Potter, the vanquisher of the terrible Lord Voldemort. His proud Father being James Potter, a powerful wizard, skilled in Transfiguration and Defense Against the Dark Arts. And his gentle, yet terrifying Mother, Lily Potter. A strong and intelligent Witch, skilled in Charms and Runes. It is these two parents that are proud of their powerful son.</p><p>The Wizarding Community only knew that Aiden lived within Potter Manor. Just the one and only child. But wait… what about Harry?</p><p>Harry is ignored by the Wizarding Community and his own family. Ever since his brother was declared as the Boy-Who-Lived, both of his parents started to pay more and more attention to Charles than Harry as the time passed. At first, both boys were shown love and care after they had moved back into Potter Manor. But as time wore on, Harry was slowly fading into the ‘shadows’. Until four years had passed and he was ignored completely.</p><p>Sirius Orion Black was Harry’s Godfather, as Remus John Lupin was Charles’ Godfather. Yet, like James and Lily, Sirius and Remus slowly forgot about Harry and paid full attention to Charles. Not only was Charles famous for stopping a powerful dark lord, but another dreaded matter had arose. The dreaded matter had turned out to be a Prophecy, foretold by Sybil Trelawney. A prophecy that states that the ‘one’ marked by the dark lord will be his equal. And vanquish him once and for all. After hearing that prophecy, they all focused their attention to Charles, to make sure he was strong, brave, and had the will to battle and defeat Voldemort once and for all.</p><p>With Harry growing up in a mansion he had far more time to himself and could hide, whether deliberate or not, in any number of rooms. All Harry wanted was to have his parents love him again, to look and acknowledge his existence. Not to look past him. At a young age, Harry was very perceptive. While he was ignored by his own parents, one Mad-Eye Moody had the decency to stay by Harry’s side and teach him well. “CONSTANT VIGILANCE” was drilled into Harry’s brain. He would always plan before making any action, he would study his surroundings as he wandered through the forest behind the manor. He learned to take of himself when he walked into a room, calling for his mother, only for her to ignore him completely.</p><p>Since Harry was being ignored by his own family, Harry took Mad-Eye’s tactful knowledge to heart and began to immerse himself in books. Studying and learning. He would never be weak or caught unprepared in any situation. Reading through muggle books that his mother acquired, he learns of the human body. Realizing that the magical community hardly bothers to exercise and are unable to enhance their own magic. Therefore, Harry trains and exercises himself to become stronger. As witches and wizards will only stand there, they will hardly dodge, and have no knowledge of Hand-to-Hand combat. Harry takes up Martial Arts, specifically Wing Chun, Kung Fu, and Karate. Harry studies through Charms books, as most can be done Wandlessly. He also discovers that he is an Elementalist. A full one at that! And takes it upon himself to train and read and know his limits, so he can push past them.</p><p>Whenever Harry felt sad and depressed from his parent’s ignorance of his existence, he would travel through the safe part of the forest. Until his fifth birthday had come. When he went into the Kitchen to celebrate with his family and wish his brother a Happy Birthday, he had discovered that he had been left behind. He had searched the manor for an hour, even calling the three house-elves that work for the Potter family, only to discover they had gone with the rest of his family, did Harry feel truly alone.</p><p>So, that day, Harry learned how to cook for himself. Always making Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner in his own room using the few Charm spells he had mastered. From that day on, Harry no longer cared for his family and ignored them entirely. He would do everything himself and get help from no one else.<br/>
-<br/>
1988</p><p>Harry is now eight years old and was going to Primary School along with his brother, Charles. As expected, the rest of the Potter’s don’t even realize he’s there. Charles followed his parents and ignored his younger brother as he thought it was natural, until Charles turned six, he believed himself to be an only child. Harry’s progress in school was remarkable. While Charles got passing grades, Harry was incredible. Harry’s quick thinking and careful planning got him near perfect scores in every subject he took. Harry also chose to learn the Japanese language, as their brand of magic fascinated him. Drawing a character on paper to create certain effects, much stronger than some standard Charms always captured his attention. He also studied the various hand signs to use magic.</p><p>The Trust Fund in Harry’s name was never cancelled by his so called ‘parents’, so his school fee was always covered. Harry took advantage of that. Withdrawing everything, every year into a bottomless coin bag. Even with his own money, Harry still earned a fair bit of coin since his only had 10,000 Galleons, while Charles had 100,000 Galleons. Even after a few dozen cooking books and careful experimentation, Harry excelled in becoming a Master Chef. Producing a variety of foods that appeased the masses. Harry was called to work in the school cafeteria to produce meals for the teachers, all of whom always tipped Harry for the exquisite meals. With that done, he made his own money, gaining even more than what was earned in his Trust Fund.</p><p>Then one day, the school announced a student exchange program between Great Britain and Japan. Harry jumped at the chance to leave his ‘family’ and study the more arcane magic in Japan. He would head there alone, while another student in Japan would head here. Harry magically spelled the permission slip to read something else and slipped it under Charles’ door. When Charles discovered it, he gave it to his Mum and Dad. They agreed and signed the permission slip without a second glance. Later that night Harry slipped into Charles’ room and took the slip, replacing it with the real one for attending a Ministry Ball. And handed over the permission slip to his teacher. With his ‘parents’ covering for him, with a simple lie, Harry was on his way to Japan. To discover the wonders of Japanese magic and to meet the family that he would be living with for the next year. The Izumi Family. Kae, Masami, and their son Koushiro, who prefers ‘Izzy’.</p><p>After ‘borrowing’ one of the multi-compartment trunks from his ‘family’. Harry stored a map of Japan’s Magical District, found in the Library. Everything needed for survival, courtesy of Mad-Eye, and returned to his room to finish packing.</p><p>Harry stored numerous books for survival training, along with a few Herbology books to recognize what is dangerous and what is not. Also storing his magical and non-magical currency. Informing the lead House-Elf chef that Harry would be out for a while and to inform the assisting chef that she’ll be running Harry’s restaurant on her own. And any book that piqued his interest. Books on Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology, even one from Mad-Eye himself on how to combat enemies in any environment. Harry also stored all of his books and scrolls on Wing Chun, Kung Fu, and Karate, so his skills won’t get rusty.</p><p>Charles still had no knowledge of where Harry was going, not that he cared since he pretended Harry didn’t exist. Harry heard James and Lily talk to Sirius and Remus on how they needed to train Charles on every magical theory so he could defeat any enemy that comes his way. Harry rolled his eyes and left the house, via one of the house-elves that still acknowledge Harry’s existence.<br/>
-<br/>
Harry exited the plane and looked around. He had received a final message from the Izumi family that the mother would be waiting for him. Harry spotted a young woman wearing a light green shirt and brown pants, along with a yellow apron, holding a sign that said ‘Harry Potter’. Harry approached the young woman, “Mrs. Izumi?” he asked.</p><p>Mrs. Izumi looked down and smiled warmly, “Yes dear. Are you Harry Potter?” she asked, getting a nod from Harry. “Welcome to Odaiba, Japan. Have you got everything?” Harry nods again, holding his trunk. “Very well, follow me and I’ll take you to my home.”</p><p>Harry nods again and follows her out of the Airport and into a modest Mazda. As she was exiting the parking lot, she struck up a conversation, “So, what made you decide to volunteer for the exchange student program?” she asked Harry, keeping her eyes on the road.<br/>
Harry didn’t see any problem with the question and answered, “I’m fascinated with Japanese culture. I’ve also spent a couple of years learning the Japanese language so I could talk with others properly.”</p><p>Mrs. Izumi chuckled lightly, “Well your Japanese is very good. And goes interestingly with your accent. Your fascinated with our culture you say? Anything else?”</p><p>Harry shrugged slightly, “Your food. There are some recipes I would like to try.”</p><p>“Try? Well, if you’re interested, I do know how to cook and can make anything that you’d like to try.” Mrs. Izumi offered.</p><p>Harry bowed his head slightly, “Thank you, Mrs. Izumi. But I was hoping to cook the recipes myself, that way I can experiment with the recipe to see how I can make it taste even more exquisite.” Harry said, looking out the window.</p><p>Mrs. Izumi pursed her lips. She knew that Harry was her son’s, Izzy’s, age. And yet the child spoke of having to cook at the age of eight. She kept silent on that for now. “Well then Harry, what do your parents think about you coming here?” she asked. She didn’t see Harry’s eyes darkening as he wasn't facing her, but she did see his hand clench slightly.</p><p>“My ‘family’, (she noticed that too), are hard-working people and know what’s best for their son.” Harry responded softly. Before she could ask another question, Harry gasped lightly, (faking of course), “Oh, dear, I don’t think I packed much on toiletries. Can you stop by the Aqua City Mall?” Harry asked</p><p>“Oh, there’s no need to worry about that Harry, I’m sure Izzy won’t mind sharing with you.” Mrs. Izumi said.</p><p>“With all due respect, Mrs. Izumi, but I do not wish to start on your son’s bad side. Please, it will not take that long.” Harry pleaded, using his ‘begging eyes’ that Mad-Eye had him practice to make adults crumble under the gaze.</p><p>Harry could see Mrs. Izumi struggling, until she caved and nodded to Harry. Harry thanked her quietly and turned his attention back outside. A few minutes later saw Harry heading into the mall, after assuring Mrs. Izumi that he would be fine and take less than an hour to gather everything. Harry headed over to the secret entrance, where a security guard, a disguised wizard, stood waiting.</p><p>Harry walked straight up to him, “Excuse me sir, do you know of any mystic stores around here?” Harry asked politely.</p><p>The guard looked at him, “Do you know what you ask child?”</p><p>“I do sir, MahouMachi is quite well known.” Harry responded. The guard tensed slightly before subtly waving his arm around. And relaxing. Harry stared at him surprise, “I didn’t see you go for your…” Harry trailed off.</p><p>The guard smiled lightly, “Yes, something that’s required to learn here. Where are your parents?”</p><p>“Back home in England, I decided to sign up for the non-magical student exchange program and learn all I can about Japan, both magical and non-magical.” Harry responded.</p><p>The guard nodded, “Alright, do you at least have someone waiting for you outside?”</p><p>Harry nodded and the guard waved his hand over a barren wall, revealing several characters. Typing four in quick succession, he gestured to Harry to walk on through, which Harry did. Harry stepped through and gaped slightly at MahouMachi’s magical district in awe. Diagon Alley had nothing compared to this.</p><p>While Diagon Alley had its perks, it was small and cramped and stuck in the past. MahouMachi though, technology worked with magic. And there were several more stores. Harry noticed that fifteen minutes had passed and quickly heads to the bookstore, where he scans the shelves, asking the employee about Hand Seals and the like. The employee quickly points out seven different books, which Harry buys and quickly heads to another store to get the ‘toiletries that he needed. After making his purchases, he heads out of the district, nodding his thanks to the guard and heads outside to see Mrs. Izumi waiting for him.</p><p>“Are you ready, Harry?” she asked. Harry nods and gets in the car and heads to the Izumi family home.<br/>
-<br/>
Twenty minutes later, Mrs. Izumi and Harry pull up to a modest apartment and head into the correct door. Waiting for the two is a young man wearing a light purple button up shirt and dark grey jeans. With ash grey hair and brown framed glasses. He looked up from the T.V. and stood up to kiss his wife, “Welcome home honey.” He said, then looked down at Harry. He smiled again and bend down on his knees, “Hello there Harry, welcome to Odaiba. We’re glad to have you here.”</p><p>“Thank you for welcoming me sir. I hope I’m not going to be a bother.” Harry said.</p><p>Mr. Izumi laughed, “No trouble at all Harry. You can use the guest room we have. But first,” Mr. Izumi stood up and called over his shoulder, “Izzy, come out and say hello to Harry.”</p><p>Harry stood still and waited as a young boy, slightly shorter than he was. Wearing an orange button up shirt, untucked from his tan colored shorts. His socks looked like they might be big on him, since they hung loosely from his ankles. His shoes were purple, with a dark blue binding lace, along with a lightning bolt on the side. He was wearing pale yellow gloves and his hair was a dark brown, that stuck out in all directions, like he had been near electricity.</p><p>Izzy came over and bowed lightly to Harry, “Greetings Harry, welcome to our home.”</p><p>Harry bowed back, “Thank you Koushiro. I do hope that we can get along well.</p><p>Izzy straightened up, smiling lightly, “I hope so too, Harry. And you can call me Izzy.”</p><p>Harry straightened up as well, nodding.</p><p>Mrs. Izumi, clapped her hands, “Alright, Izzy, please show Harry to the guest room and I’ll get started on dinner.”</p><p>Izzy nodded and gestured for Harry to follow him, which Harry did and rolled his trunk behind him. Turning around the corner and heading to the second door on the right, Izzy opened the door and allowed Harry in first. The inside of the room was basic, standard bed, dresser, and a desk. Harry turned and thanked Izzy, saying that he would see him again at dinner. Izzy nodded and left.</p><p>Harry quietly closed the door and started taking out his clothes and putting them away. Along with his toiletries and a few towels that he brought with him. Harry then went into the second compartment and stored his new books in the small library that he brought with him. Harry headed back out and sealed the trunk closed, pressing a few runes to pass for muggle things, in case Izzy’s parents accidentally opened the case. Because Harry was sure that Mrs. Izumi was the type to clean rooms thoroughly. Harry sat on the bed and opened one of the Herbology books and began reading. About forty-five minutes later, Harry is called out of the room by Mr. Izumi to join them for dinner. It was quite a meal. Mrs. Izumi decided to treat Harry with an amazing spread. Consisting of four different Sushi rolls, Tempura, Yakitori, Soba, Sukiyaki, and Miso Soup.</p><p>Harry tried a bit of all and thanked Mrs. Izumi for the excellent meal. After heading to the bathroom to brush his teeth, Harry headed back to the guest room and started reading again. Harry could faintly hear clacking in the next room and looked out the door to see Izzy typing on a laptop. Harry shrugged and went back to reading about plants.<br/>
-<br/>
The next day</p><p>Today, Harry was leaving with Izzy to attend Odaiba Primary School. Since he was eight, he would be attending grade 4. Harry had also learned that Izzy was incredibly smart. Izzy had introduced Harry to his other friends during break.</p><p>Izzy introduces Harry to Taichi ‘Tai’ Kamiya and Sora Takenouchi. Harry’s first impression on meeting the boy is that he’s impulsive and acts without thinking. More along the lines of the typical jocks back in England. Only Tai is obsessed with Soccer. Sora was someone he didn’t want to mess with. Despite the kindness she showed him, there was a tomboy attitude hidden within. Harry didn’t see any problem with the three and decided to try to be more open minded and interact more often with others around his age.</p><p>“So, what’s Japan like?” Harry asked Tai, Izzy, and Sora.</p><p>“It’s pretty peaceful, if you can get used to the crowds.” Izzy answered. Tai and Sora decided to be more detailed about what Japan was like. Even going so far to mentioning a horrible terrorist bombing case in Hikarigaoka that happened a few years ago. Even to this day, the police haven’t found the ones responsible yet. It was the only reason why their families had moved to Odaiba. The parents fearing something like that from happening again, Harry could understand the logic and caution behind it.</p><p>Nodding with interest, Harry tried to get some more information about the case, only to discover that they were too young to remember what happened and couldn’t remember any exact details. Before Harry could suggest a change in topic, Tai asked Harry to play soccer with them. After Harry pointed out that he knew nothing of soccer, the three decided to teach Harry how to play. A few minutes later the four were playing a two on two game, with Harry and Izzy vs. Tai and Sora. At the end of break Sora and Izzy were teasing Tai on how he lost so many goals to Harry, while also asking if Harry never really played soccer because of how good he was. Harry just responded that he was a fast learner. Izzy was the only one who understood that.</p><p>When break ended, the four of them returned to their respective classes and continued their studies. Harry was in Art class with Tai and enjoyed the class immensely. Harry learned how to mix different colors and heard with detail how to make the painting look more alive. Harry had done a simple rose to start off. But when the teacher saw his art work, she gasped in surprise. The detail was so life-like. The paint breathed as though it existed. The red of the rose was rich and sparkled of fresh dew. The stem and leaves were the proper shade of green. The teacher was so stunned with Harry’s progress, that she gave him several art supplies, crayons, colored pencils, and paints. And told Harry to work hard and continue to let his imagination flow.</p><p>Harry nodded and left for class. As he left the school with Izzy, he noticed his painting was on display and a number of students were staring at it in awe.<br/>
-<br/>
The next day, Day 3</p><p>Not much had changed from the previous day, except for the art teacher supplying Harry with some erasers she forgot to give him the first time. Harry met up with Tai, Izzy, and Sora near the end of class when the Principal came into the classroom announcing that they would be going to Summer Camp the next day.</p><p>During the break, Harry and his three friends exchanged stories about Japan and England. Tai, Izzy, and Sora were fascinated in hearing about where Harry lived, though they didn’t hear about the magical part, but weren’t too keen on visiting if it really rained so much. Likewise, Harry was interested in exploring Japan with them if they ever got the chance to show him around, though he was hesitant in visiting Hikarigaoka if there was another bombing case.</p><p>When school ended Harry and Izzy excitedly got a ride from Mrs. Izumi and told her about Summer Camp. Which she agreed to. Harry admitted that he’s never been to Summer Camp as that was never an option back in England’s Primary school.  When the three got home, Harry and Izzy went to their rooms and immediately started packing. Though Harry just pressed a rune on his trunk that popped out most of the compartments except the main one, which held the basics, and turned the compartment into a bottomless bag by pressing on another rune.</p><p>Harry made sure to use the advantage to read on Silent and Wandless magic as he was too young to get a Magical Focus yet. Harry had dinner with the Izumi family and returned to his room to start reading through his Charms book. After reading half the book, Harry closed it, stored it into his bottomless bag and went to sleep.<br/>
-<br/>
Day 4</p><p>The next morning, all students going to summer camp met at the school parking lot, most students saying goodbye to their parents for the month. While Harry politely thanked Mr. and Mrs. Izumi for having him, even if it was for a few days. Mr. and Mrs. Izumi smiled politely and watched Harry and Izzy board the bus with the rest of his friends. Mr. and Mrs. Izumi shared a look before heading back to their car.</p><p>While Izzy, Sora, and Tai spoke with others, Harry was memorizing the techniques for Gum Sao. A simple, but effective technique. While practicing his Martial Arts, Harry has taken to meditation and practicing his magic deep within his mind. Though Wandless and Silent magic cannot be traced, Harry dared not risk it with any major spells. So, practicing safely in his own mind, only he had to deal with any negative backlash and knew how to respond accordingly.</p><p>Since Harry was the only foreign student, Sensei Fujiyama decided to let him remain with Izzy, Tai, and Sora. Since he’s never seen Harry interact with anyone else. A boy with odd blue hair and glasses led Harry, his friends, and a few others to the house they would be staying in and put away their belongings.</p><p>Quick introductions were provided. Joe Kido was the one who led the group. He had a tan bag hanging across his left shoulder. He wore a yellow no-sleeve shirt over a grey shirt. Grey shorts, with blue socks and red and white shoes. Yamato ‘Matt’ Ishida wore a dark forest green no-sleeve shirt with blue pants and brown shoes. He also wore dark grey gloves. His hair was blond and stuck up more than Tai’s but less than Izzy’s.</p><p>Takeru ‘TK’ Takaishi was a little boy whose favorite color appeared to be green. Since his hat, sweater, long sleeve shirt and shoes were different shades. He also wore tan shorts and yellow socks. His hair was the same color as Matt’s and they said they were brothers. Harry figured it was family business between the two and decided not to find out more. And Mimi Tachikawa, the girl clearly loved pink. Since her hat, dress, and socks were different shades of pink. She wore light brown gloves and white and brown shoes. The way her hair was done and how neat her clothes were, showed how much she enjoyed fashion. Especially since she saw Harry’s hair as a challenge when he told her even he couldn’t tame it. Harry mentally shuddered at the look in her eyes.</p><p>Harry and Izzy stayed inside while the others went out to play. Harry studied the techniques in Wing Chun and Izzy was typing away on his laptop. As Harry set the book down to practice the techniques, he saw everyone rush inside, confused at why they came in so soon. Before Harry could ask, he felt a rush of… something unique, and saw a snowstorm! raged out of nowhere. Seeing that everyone was wearing only summer clothes, Harry considered revealing a bit of magic to warm them up, when the storm stops and the wind calms. All of them went outside to find out what happened. Harry grabbed his book and bottomless bag on the way out. He didn’t know why, but something felt like he was going to need it.</p><p>When Harry left, he saw everyone looking up in awe and heard Izzy muttering in confusion. Harry looked up himself, he felt his jaw drop at seeing the Aurora Borealis light the sky. Harry couldn’t explain it. First it was summer, now there’s a sudden snowstorm when it should be 94 degrees outside, and now one of the most awe-inspiring sights is in an impossible place!</p><p>“How beautiful!” Mimi gushed, looking at one of the popular world phenomenon’s with awe written on her face.</p><p>“But how is this possible? We’re too far south to see the Aurora.” Izzy pointed out, his jaw still hanging when he finished.</p><p>“GET DOWN!” Tai suddenly yelled, while looking up.</p><p>Harry barely glanced up, when the snow in front of him exploded in the air. He threw his arms in front of his face and heard everyone shouting in surprise. When Harry felt the snow settle, he lowered his arms. “Is everyone alright?” Harry asked.</p><p>“We’re still here.” Matt responded, crouching down and holding TK.</p><p>“That was scary.” Mimi said, on her knees and holding her hat.</p><p>“What was that?” Joe asked, sitting on the ground.</p><p>“Meteors?” Izzy suggested, looking over one of the holes in the ground.</p><p>Suddenly, the eight holes in the snow glowed brightly and a small device rose from each right in front of Harry and the others. Harry instinctively grabbed the one in front of him, as did the others, Joe almost catching his late. “Ok, so it’s not meteors.” Izzy said.</p><p>Harry opened up his hand and saw the strange device in more detail when the glow faded. Instantly, Harry could feel his magic sing with the device in his hand. ‘What is this? Why do I feel a connection to this device and why is my magic reacting like this?’ Harry thought.</p><p>“Forget the meteor theory, surf’s up!” Tai exclaimed.</p><p>Harry looked up and shouted in fright as a massive wave appeared out of nowhere and swept over them all. Harry could hear the others scream as he did "I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CHEER LEADING CAMP!" Mimi's scream was the loudest, when they fell into the unknown.</p>
