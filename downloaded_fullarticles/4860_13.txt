    <p align="justify">“You’ll get burned, staying out in the sun like this, honey”</p><p align="justify">Credence lazily opens one eye to find Queenie staring down at him. She is holding a pink battered umbrella to shade herself from the unforgiving midday sun of Bellerophone.</p><p align="justify">“I like the sun” declares Credence, closing his eye and reclining back on his deckchair “anyways, it’s not like we’ll be staying long enough for me to get burnt, is it?” he adds bitterly.</p><p align="justify">The Captain had made it abundantly clear, the moment they landed on Bellerophone’s public landing pad, that theirs was to be a short stay. Just as long as it took them to stock on provisions, buy some spare parts for the ship, and pick up a new job from Gnarlack. Queenie and Jacob are now apparently back with the provisions, and Credence himself already got all the parts he needs to keep <em> Serenity </em>up and running earlier on the day. The Captain and Newt are still missing, presumably still trying to haggle the reward prices with Gnarlack, an exercise in futility if Credence ever saw one. That man loves his credits more than Newt loves his pets. Apart from them, the only missing crewmember would be…</p><p align="justify">“Oh, there’s Teenie! She does not look happy” observes Queenie. Credence forces himself to open his eyes. The bright, white glare of the sun blinds him for a moment, but after a few quick blinks, he is able to focus on Queenie’s sister.</p><p align="justify">She does not, indeed, look happy. She crosses the landing pad in quick, angry strides, hands stuffed in the pockets of her signature brown coat, and shoulders hunched up to her ears. Behind her, Newt hurries to catch up, clutching an old looking, hole riddled, case to his chest, and sending her worried glances.</p><p align="justify">“Everything OK, Teenie?” questions Queenie once her sister arrives.</p><p align="justify">“No, nothing is OK, Queenie” she snaps back “Gnarlack is a nasty, evil, <em> cheap </em> piece of shit”</p><p align="justify">“You mean we don’t have a job?” asks Jacob, coming out of <em> Serenity </em>’s cargo bay, where he has been storing their newly acquired provisions.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, no, we do have a job” replies Newt “Tina just doesn’t like it much, that’s all”</p><p align="justify">“It’s a joke! And not even a well paid one, at that”</p><p align="justify">“Animal lives are not a joke” calmly states Newt, clutching the case tightly to his chest. The case mewls in response. “They are as deserving of a new home as you or me, and the price was more than adequate” he sniffs, earning himself a boiling glare from his partner.</p><p align="justify">“You mean you have animals in the case?” asks Credence, eagerly standing up and approaching Newt “Can I see?”</p><p align="justify">Newt beams at him and begins to fiddle with the case’s locks “Sure! Here, let me-” but he is interrupted before he can open the case.</p><p align="justify">“None of that now! There will be plenty of time to look at the blasted furballs once we’re back up. Now, Credence where is Graves?”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know, Captain” responds Credence, eyeing Newt’s case with longing “He was with a client, he did say he would be back on time”</p><p align="justify">“We leave in an hour” declares the Captain, striding into <em> Serenity </em> “If Graves doesn’t return by then, he is more than welcome to hitch a ride with a space liner. Newt, go store the furballs somewhere I don’t have to deal with them, Queenie, with me. We need to talk”</p><p align="justify">Credence watches as Queenie and the Captain disappear into the ship, Newt following soon after, throwing an apologetic glance back at Credence.</p><p align="justify">Credence and Jacob are left standing by themselves in the landing pad. Credence sinks back into his deckchair.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t worry, lad” says Jacob patting him comfortingly on the shoulder “I imagine there will be plenty of time for you to see those beasts Newt has brought on board”</p><p align="justify">Credence smiles thankfully up at Jacob. The pilot, along with his wife, basically adopted Credence as their own child the moment he joined the crew.</p><p align="justify">“Do you think the Captain was serious about leaving Percival behind?” he asks, averting his eyes and feeling a blush stain his cheeks, voice barely more than a whisper.</p><p align="justify">“Ha! She wouldn’t dare” reassures him Jacob “Good ol’ Percy is the only thing keeping this ship respectable. With him gone the Alliance would not hesitate to round all of us up like petty criminals. And, hey! There he is!” he exclaims.</p><p align="justify">Credence eyes snap up to follow Jacob’s gaze, and immediately land on their missing crewmember. Percival is just getting off a shiny hoverpad, a richly dressed beautiful woman hanging off his arm. From the distance Credence cannot quite make out what she is saying, only the flirty pout on her lips and the flutter of her long eyelashes. Whatever it is she says, though, seems to be the right thing, because Percival swoops her up in a long, lewd looking kiss.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, boy” Jacob mutters, and Credence can hear him beating a hasty retreat back to the ship.</p><p align="justify">Credence stays, slumped over in his tattered deckchair, his blush adding a darker shade of red to his sunburnt cheeks. He stays and stares. He follows Percival’s hands as they circle the lady’s delicate waist, rough looking fingers clutching the fine silk of her dress, large palms dragging slowly down her back and over the soft curve of her buttocks, before giving a firm squeeze. He is too far to hear her gasp, but he can clearly see the way her mouth opens, the way her eyelashes flutter close, and her fingers spasm where they clutch Percival’s fancy jacket.</p><p align="justify">Heat pools in Credence belly and makes him cross his legs. His face is burning and he can hear Ma’s voice in his head, telling him what a<em> wicked, sinful boy </em>he is. But he does not look away.</p><p align="justify">Percival is now kissing down the lady’s neck, one hand brushing tantalisingly close to her breast, the other still grabbing her backside and drawing her in against him. The lady’s head falls back, like a puppet with cut strings, before Percival pushes her back up again for another hungry, open mouthed kiss. Credence swallows the whimper climbing up his throat, and watches as Percival slowly and gently disentangles himself, playfully catching the lady’s lower lip between his teeth, hands caressing her body as they leave. A quick swipe off his thumb over her mouth, a few more whispered words, and Percival is turning away from her and making his way towards Credence and the <em> Serenity </em>, his elegant suitcase held in his hand.</p><p align="justify">Once he spots him, Percival catches Credence’s gaze and smiles. Credence awkwardly smiles back, frantically trying to think of an excuse to explain why he is sitting outside, staring at Percival kiss his client like a pervert. He can feel his cheeks burn with embarrassment, the blush now spreading from the back of his neck to the top of his ears.</p><p align="justify">“Too much time in the sun, eh, my boy?” questions Percival as he draws nearer. Credence nods, dropping his gaze to stare at his toes. They are dirty from walking around the pad in sandals all day, Percival’s shoes on the other side, shine like a mirror, black leather polished within an inch of its life. “Let’s get back inside, I imagine Tina is already anxious to leave” he adds, ruffling Credence hair as he walks past him and into the ship.</p><p align="justify">Credence lets out a stuttering breath and turns to watch Percival’s back as he disappears into <em> Serenity </em>. No sense getting worried about being caught looking, he thinks wryly, it is not as Percival sees him as anything but a child, anyway.</p><p align="justify">***</p><p align="justify">Credence arrived to the <em> Serenity </em>in a box.</p><p align="justify">He was part of a job Mary Lou Barebone had commissioned with the Captain and her crew.</p><p align="justify">(He was the job)</p><p align="justify">It was only by chance, and Newt’s unshakable habit of smuggling animals on board, that the crew found out that what they thought was a box full of medicine contained, in fact, a human being.</p><p align="justify">The Captain had gone ballistic at the discovery, ranting against Mary Lou and the Alliance while Queenie tried to calm her down, with little to no success. Meanwhile Credence, just awoken from his artificially induced slumber, found himself sitting in a box, buck naked and surrounded by strangers.</p><p align="justify">Survival instinct had kicked in and he had jumped out of the box, for once not caring about his state of undress or the ugly scars marking his body, and tried to make a run for it. He had managed to get quite far. Queenie and Jacob too busy trying to calm down the Captain, and Newt more concerned about checking whether or not there really was any medicine on the box, than chasing naked boys across the ship.</p><p align="justify">He had climbed up the rickety stairs over the cargo bay, running on unsteady legs across the metal walkways, until he spotted a door to the side. Not thinking twice, he had opened the door and climbed inside, only to find himself in a room straight out of a fantasy.</p><p align="justify">Richly woven tapestries hung over the walls, covering the plain, bare metal of the ship. The ceiling and floor were covered as well, long swaths of sumptuous looking cloth hung from the ceiling, and thick, luxurious rugs covered every inch of the floor. There were several pieces of furniture of mismatched styles, all richer and more beautiful than Credence had ever seen. The room was softly lit by antique looking lamps and a handful of strategically placed candles, giving off a soft welcoming glow.</p><p align="justify">He had tentatively made his way further in, too enchanted to notice the other occupant of the room until a soft voice spoke out behind his back.</p><p align="justify">“And who are you?”</p><p align="justify">Credence had quickly turned around at the words. A man stood at the other end of the room, dressed in a beautifully decorated silk robe, loosely tied at the waist, and a pair of just as beautiful and luxurious silk pants. He wore no shirt and Credence could see his strong chest, dusted with black hair, where the robe gaped open.</p><p align="justify">“I-I’m...I-I..” Credence had stuttered like a fool, walking backwards until his back was against the wall.</p><p align="justify">The other man had frowned, thick, heavy brows giving his expression a threatening air. When he advanced upon him, Credence had, instinctively, dropped to his knees, head bowed and arms raised to forestall the incoming blows.</p><p align="justify">Only no blows had come. Only a deep sigh, followed by a warm, soft blanket being dropped over his head.</p><p align="justify">“Here, you may want to cover yourself. It can get cold in space”</p><p align="justify">Credence had poked his head out from beneath the blanket, which felt infinitesimally softer than his own threadbare one back home. “Space?” He had asked, like a damn fool.</p><p align="justify">“A spaceship, to be more exact” had been the reply, the man now crouching down next to him, a wry smile on his lips “My name’s Percival Graves, I’m a Companion, I rent this shuttle from Tina to use as my… office, let’s say”</p><p align="justify">“A Companion?!” had asked Credence, alarmed. Ma had told him about Companions, sinful, debauched whores, who drove good men and women to sin and disgrace, through witchery and trickery. “I can’t be here!” he had shouted, getting to his feet and stumbling towards the door, feet tangled up with the long blanket.</p><p align="justify">“Can’t be- why?” had asked Percival, brows furrowed in confusion, but making no move to stop Credence’s escape.</p><p align="justify">“This is a den of iniquity!!” had declared Credence, loudly and more than slightly panicked, as he opened the door and tumbled, face down, into the corridor.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, here you are!” had exclaimed Newt from above him, as Credence fought to disentangle himself from the blanket. “Tina wants to speak with you. Hello, Percival” he had added on spotting the other man “Mind helping me get him back to the kitchen?”</p><p align="justify">Newt and Percival had grabbed him, tangled in the blanket as he was, and carried him to the kitchen, where the rest of the crew had been waiting. Queenie had immediately started fussing over him, patting his head and muttering about the unfairness and cruelty of the Verse. Jacob had not said anything, he had just smiled reassuringly at him while offering him plate after plate of warm, delicious food. The Captain had stared at him for a long while, before she started interrogating him. How did he know Mary Low? Had he ever met Mr. Shaw? Did he have any family, friends they could call?</p><p align="justify">(She was his adoptive mother. He had never met Mr. Shaw. He had no family or friends, Mary Lou had been the only one)</p><p align="justify">“I could be persuaded to let you join the crew” had declared the Captain “If you happened to have some skills we could use. Are you a Doctor, by any chance?”</p><p align="justify">Credence had shacked his head.</p><p align="justify">“Shame. We could have really used a doctor, Newt is doing the job now, but he is only a veterinarian, not quite the same…”</p><p align="justify">“I-I’m- I’m good with ships?” had stuttered Credence, hoping against hope that would be enough the let him stay “I used to fix Ma’s ship. Kept the engine running. It was an old Firefly model”</p><p align="justify">The Captain had beamed at him, as if Credence had just announced he would be buying her a brand new ship. “Firefly, you say?”</p><p align="justify">And that had been it.</p><p align="justify">***</p><p align="justify">“Door is open” announces Percival from inside the shuttle.</p><p align="justify">Credence quietly pushes the heavy door open and slips inside, making sure to toe off his sandals before stepping on the plush rugs that decorate every inch of the room.</p><p align="justify">“Sorry for the delay” he excuses himself as he comes into the room. Percival is puttering around on his small kitchenette, loading up a carved brass tray with his porcelain tea set.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t worry about it” says Percival, waving a hand in a dismissive gesture “I was just getting started. Take a seat, make yourself at home, kid”</p><p align="justify">Credence does not need to be told twice. He awkwardly lowers himself into his favourite pouffe, sinking into it, and resting his hands on the top of his knees. Percival, who has just finished loading the tray, carefully deposits it on the low, ornate wood table between them, before lowering himself into the chaise-lounge opposite him.</p><p align="justify">“Is it all okay with the engines?” he asks, a small dent appearing between his brows “If Tina needs you to work on them we can reschedule for-”</p><p align="justify">“No!” answers Credence, a little too fast, definitely to eager “No” he repeats, more calmly “The engines are fine. I was with Newt. He misses the kittens” he explains at Percival’s raised eyebrow.</p><p align="justify">Newt had grown particularly attached to Gnarlack’s smuggled kittens, in the short week it had taken the <em> Serenity </em> to navigate from Bellerophone to Santo. He had begged and cajoled the Captain to let him keep one. <em> Just one tiny kitten, Tina, you won’t even notice her, I promise. </em>The Captain had been unwavering. Newt’s animal collection, she had said, had already grown way out of proportion.</p><p align="justify">As much as Credence had loved the idea of a small kitten, he had to agree with the Captain. The two dogs, the hamster, the parrot, and the toad, were already pushing it a bit too far as it were. The cargo bay was starting to resemble a freaking zoo.</p><p align="justify">“He’ll get over it in no time” declares Percival laying out two cups on the table and, purposefully, but calmly, filling them with tea. He has to hold up the sleeve of his silk robe, least it drags into the cups, and the gesture leaves his wrist bare. Credence finds his gaze drawn to it, the almost delicate looking bones and tendons, moving as Percival pours the tea, the dusting of fine black hairs, over his arm and the back of his hand. Percival, oblivious to his attention, continues “He got over losing the bloody awful <em> llama </em> back in Triumph”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, yes” laughs Credence “It was an alpaca, actually. You absolutely loathed it, poor thing”</p><p align="justify">“It ate my silk scarf!” hisses Percival “It was a gift from Lady Villenies, pure, artisan, embroidered silk. It probably cost more than this damn shuttle”</p><p align="justify">“You can always get her to gift you another one” replies Credence, trying not to sound too bitter at the careless reminder of Percival’s wealth. He picks at a loose thread on his trousers, the knees are discolored from multiple washes. There’s a hole in the left one.</p><p align="justify">“That’s not the point” huffs Percival “Clients usually like it when I wear their gifts. It shows gratitude, and thoughtfulness. Makes them tip more” he adds, smirking.</p><p align="justify">Credence forces a smile back. He does not particularly enjoy talking about Percival’s clients. Although he no longer believes Mary Lou’s prejudiced lies about Companions, and their supposed debauchery, he still feels uncomfortable with the thought of Percival selling his attentions for money. No matter how many times Percival assures him he choses and vetoes, each and every one of his clients, that it is not all about sex.</p><p align="justify">Some displeasure must show in his face, because Percival sets down his cup and sighs “Credence, we’ve talked about this…”</p><p align="justify">“I know” he cuts him off, biting his lower lip, mentally cursing his own narrow-mindedness. It certainly is no business of his who Percival sleeps with, or if he is paid for it. It is not like he has any claim to the man, anyways. “I’m sorry. I guess Ma’s teaching rubbed off on me, no matter how much I dislike it”</p><p align="justify">“It has nothing to do with that woman” says Percival “Some people are just not wired like that, I guess. The others may be better at pretending than you are, but believe me, none of them understand why I do what I do either.”</p><p align="justify">“Why do you?” asks Credence, shyly. For all the discussions they have had about sexual freedom and agency, he cannot remember Percival ever explaining what even drove him to enrol in the Guild.</p><p align="justify">“I was the youngest of four brothers” starts Percival, reclining down on the pillows, clearly setting in for a long tale. Credence wiggles in his seat, crossing his arms over his knees, and resting his chin on them “My parents were well off, but trying to split an inheritance four ways is no easy business, no matter how large the fortune. Sending me to train with the Guild allowed me to learn a respectable profession, that would allow me to make a good living, and removed me from the inheritance battle at the same time.”</p><p align="justify">“Removed you?” questions Credence.</p><p align="justify">“Companions renounce their families the moment they enter the Guild. What possessions we have are those we earn ourselves. I must say, think I’ve done quite well in that aspect” he smiles, waving an arm around, in a grandiose gesture that encompasses the whole shuttle.</p><p align="justify">“A rented shuttle in a rundown Firefly cruiser, you really are living the high life”</p><p align="justify">Percival snorts, half-heartedly “I could have a brand new cruiser all to myself, if I wanted to. Travelling with the <em> Serenity </em> is not only cheaper, but much more entertaining”</p><p align="justify">Credence hides a pleased smile behind his hands “Are you saying you would miss us, if you were to leave?” he teases.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, I would” answers Percival, without missing a beat. He looks serious as he says it, dark eyes fixed on Credence with unwavering intensity. Credence finds himself unable to look away, drawn into Percival’s gaze like a moth to a flame.</p><p align="justify">“I would miss you too” he croaks, mouth dry and face aflame. He would. Terribly. The mere thought of a life without Percival fills him with cold dread. Gone would be their talks in the shuttle, gone would be these wonderful pockets of time where he gets Percival all to himself, gone would be this perfect window into Percival, the man, instead of Percival, the Companion.</p><p align="justify">“Well, I’m not going anywhere” Percival declares, voice rough, cutting his musings short “And, last I knew, neither were you. So I guess you’ll have to put with this poor old man for a bit longer” he jokes, a self-deprecating smile on his mouth.</p><p align="justify">“You’re not that old” protests Credence, because, really.</p><p align="justify">“That’s kind of you to say,” smiles Percival, shaking his head “but I’m gonna be turning forty this year. I’m afraid people usually prefer their Companions a bit more on the younger side. In a few years I’ll be too old, grey and wrinkled to get any clients”</p><p align="justify">“I like your grey hair” blurts out Credence, and promptly blushes like a gorram tomato at Percival’s raised eyebrows “It makes you look distinguished, mature. There are plenty of people who are into that.”</p><p align="justify">“Are they?” asks Percival, smirking. Credence nods his head. There are. One of them is sitting in the shuttle right about now.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know” muses Percival, laying back into his pillows and idly playing with the sleeve of his robe “I always planned on retiring, once I hit a certain age. Settle on some nice, peaceful world, well away from the Core’s politics and backstabbing. Maybe buy a farm”</p><p align="justify">“Percival, you hate animals” comments Credence, amused.</p><p align="justify">“I didn’t say I would actually <em> run </em> the farm, did I?” jokingly protests Percival “I could hire someone to do it for me, I guess. I haven’t thought that far ahead. It is a nice dream, though, isn’t it?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes” agrees Credence “It’s a nice dream”</p><p align="justify">***</p><p align="justify">Gnarlack’s latest smuggling job takes the crew to Persephone. Their potential client, Madame Picquery, will be attending a party there and the Captain is planning to sneak her way in to make contact.</p><p align="justify">“A party, how delightful!” exclaims Queenie, once her sister finishes her explanation “It’s been ages since we’ve been to a party, hasn’t it, sweetie?”</p><p align="justify">“Far too long” agrees Jacob, looking back at her with a besotted smile “It will be the perfect occasion to try on that dress you bought back in Ariel”</p><p align="justify">“Only if you wear the tuxedo” jokes Queenie, trailing one finger down his arm in a flirty caress “I love how dapper you look on it”</p><p align="justify">“Is it mandatory?” blurts out Newt, and quickly lowers his eyes the moment the Captain turns her attention on him, looking to the side and fidgeting anxiously with his napkin “The party. I mean. You know I’m not that, um, great with people.” he mumbles.</p><p align="justify">“You can stay in the ship, if you prefer” responds the Captain, sounding slightly disappointed. Newt gives a quick nod, eyes still flitting all over the room. The Captain sighs to herself and turns to look at Credence “Will you come? You can stay with Newt if you want, there will be many people and-”</p><p align="justify">“I want to come” interrupts her Credence. He is not much better at people than Newt, but he has also never been to a party. Ma always said they were full of sinners, a place for self-indulgence, vice and debauchery. Now that he is a sinner himself, Credence reasons, he may as well attend. “I don’t have a tuxedo, though” he adds furrowing his brow. There has never been a need to buy one, and it is probably not something he can afford to buy on his meagre savings.</p><p align="justify">“I can lend you something” says Percival from where he is lazily lounging on one of the battered sofas, idly scrolling through his holo tablet “I have a few things that would probably fit you”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t want to be a bother-” starts to protest Credence, doing his best to squash his excitement at the chance to be able to wear Percival’s clothes.</p><p align="justify">“You’re not” Percival cuts him short, raising his eyes from the holo tablet and fixing them on Credence. "It would be ridiculous to let something as trivial as that keep you from attending the party. Although, I wonder” he says turning to look at the Captain “how exactly are you planning to enter the party?”</p><p align="justify">“What do you mean?” asks the Captain, annoyed.</p><p align="justify">“A party like this will be an exclusive affair. They won’t let any random riffle raffle through the door. Has Gnarlack provided you with invitations?” The Captain’s angry frown clearly indicates that, no, he has not. “Well, then good luck getting in” jokes Percival.</p><p align="justify">“Unless we don’t need an invite” declares the Captain. Percival arches an eyebrow at her, but she continues, undeterred, a determined glint in her gaze “These shindigs are all about knowing the right people, aren’t they? So we don’t need an invitation for ourselves, we just need to know the right person to get us in like, say, a prestigious Companion. What do you say, Graves, think you can stoop to being on my arm for one night?”</p><p align="justify">“Depends, will you wash it first?”</p><p align="justify">***</p><p align="justify">The party is nothing like Credence had imagined a party would be like.</p><p align="justify">After the excitement of the preparations (trying on a selection of Percival’s luxurious suits, and getting ready with Queenie, the two of them squished into the tiny wash room of the crew quarters, and riding to the hotel in a swanky and modern hoover car) the actual party is a complete disappointment.</p><p align="justify">The vice and debauchery Mary Lou had preached against with such vehemence are nowhere to be seen. The room is decorated lavishly enough, and there is more food than Credence has ever seen before in his life, but all enjoyment is taken away by the stiffness and formality of the whole affair.</p><p align="justify">Elegantly dressed men and women mill around the room, clustered together in little, private groups. Credence had tried to listen in to some of the conversations at the beginning, but had quickly grown bored. Politics, fashion, and local gossip are all subjects beyond his limited knowledge. There is a dancefloor, but it is no place for amateurs. All dancers look elegant and coordinated, not a step, or a hair, out of place, as they move to the tune of the music. Queenie and Jacob had valiantly tried their luck, but had been quickly chased out by nasty glares and bumpy elbows after a few missed steps.</p><p align="justify">As such, both of them have now been relegated to stand with Credence on the sidelines, watching as Percival dances and flirts with one guest after the other. The Captain quickly abandoned Percival’s side the moment they arrived, more concerned with locating Madame Picquery than playing fancy socialite. A gaggle of women had swarmed Percival soon after, and he has had his hands full since then. Probably building up quite the client database, Credence thinks angrily, and then immediately regrets it. <em> Not my business </em> he bitterly reminds himself, turning his attention from the dancefloor to the buffet table, the only element of this whole party that has, so far, lived up to his expectations.</p><p align="justify">As he is piling up his plate with delicious looking cakes and fresh fruits, he cannot help but overhear one young gentleman boasting about his newly purchased <em> Libellula </em> cruiser.</p><p align="justify">“-and it comes with a 4 cylinder, fully automated, <em> Beta-89 </em> engine” he is saying, leaning with his hip on the buffet table and basking on the attention of the small crowd surrounding him “The salesman assured me it is the smoothest running, longest lasting engine on the market”</p><p align="justify">Credence snorts, shaking his head. Smoothest running engine on the market his ass.</p><p align="justify">“Find something funny, boy?” asks the young gentleman, clearly irritated at having his new purchase questioned. His friends all turn and fixate their attention on Credence.</p><p align="justify">“Not at all, sir” quickly responds Credence, clutching his plate closer to his chest “I just- The <em> Beta-89, </em>it’s- it’s not…”</p><p align="justify">“Not what?” pushes the man.</p><p align="justify">“It’s not smooth running <em> at all” </em> declares Credence refusing to be cowed by some posh dandy from the Chore “It has a mean back kick, and the accelerator has a tendency to stall, after a short use. The whole <em> Libellula </em>line suffers from engine issues, they tried to automate too many things and pushed them to Market without proper testing. They are only selling well because of the exterior design” he finishes in a rush. He may know nothing about Chore politics, or the latest fashions, but engine and spaceship are his thing.</p><p align="justify">The young gentleman stares at him, speechless.</p><p align="justify">“Ha! Looks like you got robbed, Joshua!” laughs on of his companions “Should have done as I said and bought the newest <em> Firefly </em> model. Now, <em> that </em> is a good ship. A classic”</p><p align="justify">“Well, the new models have as many engine issues as the <em> Libellula’s </em>” points out Credence, distractedly munching on a delicious slice of strawberry shortcake. “They are not as automated, true, but the powertrain is way too old, and they have not made the necessary changes to it to support the newer engine models-“</p><p align="justify">Without meaning to, Credence suddenly finds himself surrounded by an avid crowd of young, handsome gentlemen, all of them hanging into his every word and nodding along, as he reviews the full catalogue of cruisers, pointing out their strengths and weaknesses, and the best way to get around them.</p><p align="justify">Having so many (handsome) people paying attention to him, would usually cause Credence to blush furiously and start stuttering like a nervous child. Today, however, he finds himself completely at ease. Despite their fancy clothes, impressive jobs and ridiculously huge bank accounts, these men have little to no idea of what makes an engine <em> tick </em>. They listen to his words as if they were the gospel, shyly interrupting him on occasion, to ask for a specific model or feature they have heard about, and oohing and aahing in amazed understanding when he breaks it down for them.</p><p align="justify">He does not even need to worry about re-filling his plate or his glass either, as his listeners immediately hail over a waiter the moment food starts to go low. This, thinks Credence nibbling on his fifth dark chocolate brownie and pontificating on the merits of ancient combustion engines, is what a party should really be like.</p><p align="justify">Of course, that is the precise moment the Verse decides to, once again, shit all over his happiness.</p><p align="justify">“Well, then I challenge you to a duel!” booms the Captain’s voice all across the ballroom.</p><p align="justify">Everything stops. Conversations grow silent, dancers stop moving, and the orchestra abruptly screeches to a standstill. Every single guest in the party turns their attention to the scene taking place in the middle of the room. Using his height to his advantage, Credence spots the Captain, face red with anger, standing across a rat-faced, pompous looking man. Percival is standing behind her, amongst the crowd of curious party-goers, pinching his brow while he slowly shakes his head.</p><p align="justify">“I accept the challenge” sneers the rat-faced man, looking down his nose at the Captain “As the challenged, it is my right to set the time and date of the duel. I thus-“</p><p align="justify">“Time and date?” the Captain snorts “Right here, right now, you colossal dick”</p><p align="justify">She rolls up her sleeves and purposefully advances towards her adversary, only to be stopped by Percival quickly grabbing her arm and forcefully dragging her backwards.</p><p align="justify">“What the- Graves! Release me right now!” shouts the Captain, trying to shake herself free of the grip “I’m gonna punch this asshole’s face in”</p><p align="justify">“You’ll do no such thing” hisses Percival at her from between clenched teeth “Duels in Persephone are regimented by very strict rules. Breaking Duelling Etiquette will land you in prison”</p><p align="justify">“Wha- That’s stupid!” the Captain protests “I don’t need no rules to punch his face in”</p><p align="justify">Percival scowls at her, expression stormy, before turning to face her opponent “Lord Abernathy, state your terms” he says.</p><p align="justify">“Odysseus Park, two days from now, at sundown” Lord Abernathy says.</p><p align="justify">“First blood?” Percival asks, keeping his grip on the Captain, who is still trying to shake herself free.</p><p align="justify">“To the Death” replies Lord Abernathy, a vicious, haughty, smile on his face.</p><p align="justify">***</p><p align="justify">“You know,” Percival says to the Captain “it is allowed to nominate a stand-in to represent you in a duel”</p><p align="justify">The whole crew is sitting in the <em> Serenity </em>’s kitchen, still in their fancy clothes from the party, discussing the best ways to keep their Captain alive after her reckless challenge to Lord Abernathy.</p><p align="justify">“Are you offering, Graves?” the Captain asks, raising a mocking eyebrow, as she slumps back against her chair.</p><p align="justify">Percival snorts “My duelling days are well behind me” he says “I meant you could hire someone-”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not spending my money in some fancy mercenary” the Captain curtly declares, interrupting him “And, I don’t know where you think we would find someone willing to fight for <em> me </em>, especially if it means going against one of those rich pigs”</p><p align="justify">“You never know” Graves says with a careless shrug “maybe one of Credence’s admirers would be up to the task” he adds with a teasing smirk thrown Credence way.</p><p align="justify">“Why? Are yours not available?” Credence snaps, still irritated at having so suddenly been taken from the one party where people seemed willing to speak with him.</p><p align="justify">Percival turns to stare at him in surprise, brows furrowed in slight confusion, at the cattiness of his tone. Credence ducks his head, a self-conscious blush spreading furiously over his cheeks, ashamed of his own rudeness. He knows Percival was just teasing him in good faith, but even his newfound, so-called ‘admirers’, cannot completely erase the memories of Percival dancing with one Lady after the other, all of them decked in the finest dresses and jewelry, and more beautiful than Credence could ever hope to be.</p><p align="justify">“We are not hiring a stand-in” the Captain says, pointedly ignoring Credence’s sulking.</p><p align="justify">“But, Teenie,” interrupts Queenie, brows furrowed in concern as she lightly rests a hand over her sister’s “Percival said the duels are fought with swords. You have never held a sword in your life. Isn’t it a tad too reckless to challenge Lord Abernathy all by yourself, with so little experience?”</p><p align="justify">“Swords can’t be that hard” the Captain dismissively huffs “Graves will teach me”</p><p align="justify">“Will I?” Percival asks, raising an enquiring eyebrow “And why would I do that?”</p><p align="justify">“Because it will mean you get to demonstrate one of those fancy, useless skills of yours, that you always seem so proud of, and you get to boss me around for a few days. Both things that, you will agree, use to make you very happy”</p><p align="justify">“Indeed, they do” agrees Percival “especially the bossing around part”</p><p align="justify">The Captain snorts “And It’s not like you have anything better to do, anyway”</p><p align="justify">“No” Percival says, looking over at Credence “I guess I do not”</p><p align="justify">***</p><p align="justify">Credence finishes his routine engine check and is decides to head to the kitchen for a much needed snack. He would usually go to Percival’s shuttle for some tea and pastries, but Percival has not said a word to him since Credence’s stupid outburst the night before, and Credence has not yet managed to muster up the courage to apologise for his words.</p><p align="justify">In his way he spots Newt sitting on the walkway, legs dangling over the edge, as he looks at something down in the cargo bay.</p><p align="justify">“What are you doing?” Credence asks.</p><p align="justify">Newt does not respond. He just points his head towards the cargo bay down below. Credence follows his eyes to find the Captain and Percival, engaged in what looks to be a fencing lesson.</p><p align="justify">The Captain is wearing a pair of old, faded, cargo pants, and a tight tank top that leaves her strong arms bare. Even from up the walkway Credence can appreciate the defined shape of her muscles, shiny with sweat, as she runs through a series of complicated exercises. Opposite her, Percival is decked out in full fencing attire. The white vest hugs his powerful torso and emphasizes the marked vee of hips. His pants, if they can even be called that, define his legs and stretch, tight, across a perfectly round and muscled ass.</p><p align="justify">Credence swallows, his mouth suddenly dry, and wordlessly sits himself down next to Newt, eyes never leaving Percival’s glorious derriere.</p><p align="justify">***</p><p align="justify">In the end, much to Percival’s exasperation, and Queenie’s relief, the Captain wins the duel by punching Lord Abernathy in the face.</p><p align="justify">She also spares his life, in an apparently magnanimous gesture, that is yet obviously designed to inflict him maximum humiliation. Percival looks absolutely horrified at the sheer number of duelling rules the Captain is breaking but, in a rare stroke of luck, it turns out that her brash, daring, attitude has managed to impress Madame Piqcuery enough to concede them an audience to discuss potential business.</p><p align="justify">This time, when they all sit together in the <em> Serenity’ </em>s kitchen, the atmosphere is festive and celebratory. The Captain keeps retelling, once and once again, how she managed avoid defeat, even after having lost her sword, by going back to basics and punching Lord Abernathy straight into the middle of his rat-like nose. Newt, who is stitching her up, smiles and nods his head, amused, as he re-affirms his admiration for her fighting skills and his firm advocacy of peaceful conflict resolution.</p><p align="justify">“Like teaching a pig how to fly” grouses Percival as the Captain demonstrates once again her winning maneuver and sends half of Newt’s medical kit flying.</p><p align="justify">Credence risks a look at him out of the corner of his eyes. Percival is staring back, a resigned smile on his lips. “I guess you’re the only member of this Gorram Verse forsaken crew with any appreciation for traditional arts, my boy”</p><p align="justify">Credence is quick to return the smile, eager to accept Percival’s subtle olive branch offering. “I don’t know” he says, careful not to break eye contact “I feel like I would not fare much better than the Captain at fencing. I’m not a fighter”</p><p align="justify">“Nonsense” Percival replies “You’re a fighter through and through. Not all fights are about bruised faces and angry fists. Not the ones that count, anyway”</p><p align="justify">Credence ducks his head, hiding a pleased smile “I’d still rather stick with Tea and Poetry as my arts of choice, if you don’t mind. Less of a chance of ending up with a black eye or a broken nose”</p><p align="justify">“And such a glorious nose it is” Percival jokes, leaning over to lightly poke him on the tip. Credence laughs, as he self-consciously wipes a hand over his large nose, too happy to be once again joking with Percival to complain about his obviously unsound flattery.</p><p align="justify">***</p><p align="justify">Madame Picquery’s job is legal, safe and well paid, well worth all the hassle they had to go through to achieve it. By the time they finish, the whole crew is completely unharmed, well rested and in a remarkable good mood. Even their daily disputes about whose turn it is to do the dishes, or the Captain’s and Newt’s regular discussions about the space allocated to his beasts, are tinged with a veil of contentment.</p><p align="justify">Life is good, Credence decides as he lies sprawled over the pillows in Percival’s shuttle, listening to Percival recite some raunchy poetry out of a book one of his last clients gifted him with.</p><p align="justify">From his position, Credence has a wonderful, unobserved view of Percival, reclining on the chaise-lounge across from him. The weather in Triumph, the primitive, yet peaceful, planet they just landed on, is almost unbearably hot, and the <em> Serenity’ </em>s outdated Air Conditioning system does not make much of a difference. Percival started the day in a freshly pressed shirt, cravat and his preferred silk robe. With the shirt and the tie having been discarded sometime around midday, Credence is now eagerly waiting for the robe to follow in their steps. Percival already untied the sash and left it to fall open about an hour ago, giving Credence a delicious glorious view of his chest. He has spent all the time since cataloguing every inch of it, from the way the dusting of black and white hairs in the middle gets thinner and thicker as it descends to his navel, to the enticing curves of his pelvic muscles as they disappear under the waistband of his silk pants.</p><p align="justify">He fantasises about what would happen if he were to stand up and approach Percival. What would his reaction be if Credence crawled up his body to kiss the small beads of sweat forming on his collarbone and sliding, torturously slow, over his chest. He seriously considers risking a quick kiss, a simple peck, and blaming the heat if the reaction is not favourable. It would hardly be a lie. Between the warm, humid temperature of the shuttle, and the tantalising cadence of Percival’s slightly raspy baritone, Credence feels like he is burning from the inside out, limbs heavy and head pounding.</p><p align="justify">He is just scrounging up the courage and the energy to move his limbs, when the Captain bursts through the door, without knocking, as she is wont to do.</p><p align="justify">“Get ready to leave, boys!” she says, looking unreasonably peppy for such a hot day “Provisions have been re-stocked, beasts have been corralled into their cages, and we even picked up a passenger on the way back”</p><p align="justify">“You found a passenger?” Percival asks, voice heavy with disbelief. Credence cannot blame him, Triumph is as poor as it is peaceful, it would be rare enough to find someone willing to leave, nevermind being able to afford the Captain’s passage fee. Although, that would easily explain her cheery disposition.</p><p align="justify">“A professor” she answers “He was here doing some research on local history and lore. His ship broke down, leaving him stranded, and he was quite happy to hitch a ride with us instead of waiting for a commercial cruiser. I offered him the spare bunk in the crew quarters, so I’ll need you to store your mechanic experiments elsewhere for a few days, Credence”</p><p align="justify">“Sure” Credence agrees quickly. He is used to sharing his quarters with random passengers, from time to time. God, he hopes the professor is not a snorer. The last passenger they picker up had been so bad Credence had ended up sleeping in the engine room for the better part of the trip “I’ll clear everything straight away”</p><p align="justify">“Great” the Captain says “I’ll let Professor Grindelwald know. We’ll be having a quick bite in the kitchen before we lift off, I’ll see you there” she starts to make her way out when she pauses, and turns to glare at Percival “For gorram’s sake, put on some clothes, will you?” she snaps, because she is devoid of a libido and has no sense of appreciation for the beauty of the human form.</p>
