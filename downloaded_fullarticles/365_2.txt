    <p>He awoke shivering, the cupboard was pushed open and as the light streamed in from the hall Harry squinted and attempted to cover his eyes.“Get up you useless brat” He could just make out his uncle saying as he attempted to lip read. Before the cupboard shut a hard black boot connected with Harry’s chest causing him to wheeze and grasp at air.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>Severus woke up to a sharp rapping on his quarter’s door. As he answered he came face to face with the stern deputy headmistress.<br/>
“I need you to go check on Harry,”<br/>
“Potter! Why the hell would I go check on Potter?”<br/>
“Just please, I have a bad feeling.”<br/>
“Why can’t you go!”<br/>
“I need to address the letters, just please Severus, just this once!”<br/>
“Fine but I’m telling you nothing will be wrong.”<br/>
“Just check Severus!” She practically yelled at him.<br/>
He had never seen her lose her composure in such a way, maybe there is something wrong. No!? Now, who was he kidding the kid was probably being pampered by his family laying on him hand and foot. He quickly got dressed so as not to face the wrath of Minerva yet again and walked to the edge of the wards immediately apporating to No. 4 Privet Drive- the address given to him by McGonogall before she departed.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>“We’re taking little Dudders to the zoo; don’t even think about leaving your cupboard freak!” Yelled Petunia into the cupboard not that Harry could hear what she was saying.</p><p>Two years ago he had caught an infection and his aunt and uncle refused to take him to the doctors; after all they couldn’t deal with questions about all the belt marks and wounds on Harry’s back. Sat in his cupboard clothed in a big thin t-shirt soaked in vomit and other bodily fluids the infection had soon spread to his ears and left him truly and irreversibly deaf. As Harry felt the world go silent he was occasionally dragged out of the cupboard by his uncle pulled into the garden shed and hit with a plethora of belts and hammers for letting Dudley catch the bug when in reality Dudley was the one who had given it to Harry.</p><p>He couldn’t remember the last time he had any water or food. It felt like months, in reality however it was almost four days since he’d had anything to drink and almost a week since he’d had any food. He curled up smaller as his body was wracked with coughs that shook him and left him wheezing.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>Snape gave a polite knock on the door of No. 4 Privet Drive. No answer. With a discreet alohomora he unlocked the door and slowly made his way inside. The house seemed quiet, no sign of Potter; his family were probably out treating him. He slowly made his way through to the kitchen but stopped upon hearing a sharp, painful-sounding cough followed by a wheeze. He looked down and to his right there was a small cupboard under the stairs with far too many locks to just contain cleaning products. He cast another alohomora and opened the cupboard door; he was instantly hit with the stench of infection and bodily fluids. He looked down and could see a boy of no more than five let alone nine; vibrant green eyes looked up at him.</p><p>Lily’s eyes.</p><p>He instantly grabbed the boy up and hugged him close to his chest; he was too light, he felt like he was carrying merely a bag of bones. He apparated to the edge of the Hogwarts wards and ran through the grounds towards the hospital wing.</p><p>He slammed open the doors of the hospital wing and Poppy Pomfrey immediately ran over alerted by the wards.<br/>
“Save him!” Snape yelled.<br/>
“I can but it’s going to be hard,”<br/>
“Just save him woman” he needed to cling onto the last part of Lily.<br/>
“Okay, you’re no help panicking here go and find Arthur Weasley and get adoption papers”<br/>
“Call Minerva she was the one who sent me”<br/>
“Thank God she did!”<br/>
Severus sent a Patronus to Minerva explaining the situation and the deputy headmistress appeared almost instantly.<br/>
“Is he okay”<br/>
“No, but i can fix him”<br/>
“Who’s signing the adoption papers?” Asked Severus while Poppy bustled around trying to heal Harry muttering a plethora of spells under her breath.<br/>
“Us three, the ministry can hardly object to three competent parents”<br/>
Parents. Severus a parent, he had never thought of having a child but he knew he had a duty to Lily’s memory to look after her son and so he apparated away leaving Minerva with tears in her eyes clasping at the bony hand of their child and Poppy rummaging through a cupboard looking for a potion.</p>
