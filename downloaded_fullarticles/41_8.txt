          <div class="userstuff"><p>“This is ridiculous!” Harry exclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>Tom looked up from his laptop. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“This quarantine!” Harry continued. “We’re stuck inside here for fourteen days! Fourteen days, Tom!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Tom drawled. “Two weeks.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry huffed. “Well - I don’t like it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think you’re supposed to like it, love,” Tom explained, patiently as though he was talking to a small child.</p><p> </p><p>Harry folded his arms. “I’m not sick!”</p><p> </p><p>“Neither am I, love, but it’s for the good of others. If you go outside and you get it, you might spread it without realizing.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s jaw dropped. “Good of others? Did you, Tom Riddle, just say for the good of others?” </p><p> </p><p>Tom nodded slowly.</p><p> </p><p>“The world really has collapsed! My evil boyfriend is doing something for other people!” Harry pretended to faint onto the sofa.</p><p> </p><p>Tom couldn’t help it. He broke down into laughter. Harry was just too cute with his big green eyes and unruly black hair. </p><p> </p><p>“Harry, love,” he said, settling into the sofa next to his boyfriend. Harry leant his head on Tom’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“You realize it would be terrible for my reputation if I was seen out and about when everyone is supposed to be quarantined. I can’t allow myself to become a meme about stupid people out socialising.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked up at Tom. “Of course that’s what it is, dear,” he cooed, and kissed Tom on the cheek.</p></div>
