  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <b> <em>First Year- Introductions</em> </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the threshold of Hogwarts, Jane was still amazed by the view of the castle from the lake: all lit up, towering over the dark water, a huge shape with glowing windows, some large and clearly discernible, others mere yellow dots on a black background. She had heard stories in her family and of course she had seen pictures of Hogwarts, but seeing it like this for the first time in person, it sent thrills down her stomach. She felt so glad and so ready for this new adventure, whatever may come… </p>
<p>-“Bring it on”, she whispered as she passed through the doors of the main entrance with all the other first year students. </p>
<p>A stern looking woman with a tartan gown and a pointed hat with one single long feather was standing at the top of a staircase in front of a huge wooden portal and looked down at them.</p>
<p>-“Thank you Hagrid, I’ll take it from here” she said to the tall man in boiled leather vest. He nodded, waved goodbye to the kids and strode off. “Good evening to you all. My name is Minerva McGonagall. I will be your Transfiguration teacher and for tonight my duty is to escort you to the Sorting Ceremony. Behind these doors, the rest of the school is waiting for you, but first you will be sorted into your house. Please, follow me.” </p>
<p>She turned and the huge doors opened. The Great Hall was impressively tall, spacious and solemn. Two long tables stood on either side of the central isle, decorated with the colours of their Houses. The other students had already sat and were now looking at them. The group followed Professor McGonagall down the central isle to the end of the hall, where a set of steps led to a dais where the rest of the teachers and the Headmaster sat in silence. A stool had been placed at the top of the staircase and a hat stood on it. So that was the famous Sorting Hat... It looked quite the relic, all tattered and worn out.</p>
<p>The Sorting started as soon as McGonagall had instructed them about what to do and after the Hat had sung a little song about the Houses and the founders. McGonagall started calling them in alphabetical order. She felt a wave of anxiety mixed with excitement. She looked at her left to the boy she had met on the train and they exchanged an encouraging smile. Remus Lupin was his name. They had kept close to each other, as a natural result of a train journey spent talking. She had found him in the compartment, reading a book. He was sitting near the window and the first thing Jane thought was that he looked fragile, somehow. Pale, thin, with a bit of blue marks under his eyes and scars on his hands and his neck. At first she didn’t want to intrude on his reading, she considered it rude, so they just introduced themselves. She had brought a book to read, too, so for a while they sat in silence, reading. When the woman with the trolley passed by, they both bought some candy and she asked what he was reading, just to try and chat a bit. She really <em> was </em> a bit eager to meet new people and she thought that was a good way to try. Turned out he was reading <em> The Old Curiosity Shop </em>, a muggle book she had loved, so they ended up talking for the rest of the journey. Jane thought he was nice, soft-spoken and polite and that she liked his smile, which always seemed to be somewhat apologetic. She wondered how he got all those scars. Could have been anything but she suspected it involved animals, as the scars looked quite like claw marks. She had seen that kind of wounds many time. Her family bred hippogriffs, eagles and other birds of prey and supervised a sanctuary for gryphons on account of the Ministry. She had earned a couple of such scars herself…</p>
<p>-“Goldfeather, Jane Charlotte!” Professor McGonagall called out.</p>
<p>Jane stood frozen on the spot for a brief second. What if she didn’t end up in Gryffindor? What if she was sorted into Ravenclaw instead? Or, and she felt her stomach sinking, in Slytherin? She had just realised that no matter how old the family tradition was, you could always be surprised by the Hat. That Black boy, for example, he had become a Gryffindor merely five minutes before. Loud whispering had run across the hall and a girl with chestnut hair at the Slytherin table had shouted a loud “No way!”, looking shocked but amused at the same time. For what Jane knew, the Blacks had been Slytherins for as long as it could be remembered. So… what of her? She glanced sideways at Remus, who smiled at her. She smiled back, took a breath and stepped out of the small crowd of first years. She climbed the steps towards the Hat. </p>
<p><em> -“Come on- </em> she told herself – <em> your family has been in Gryffindor for ever! It’s gonna be fine! You are as good as a descendant!”  </em></p>
<p>This wasn’t exactly true. There was no real evidence of her family actually descending from the Gryffindors or Godric himself. Only, they came from the West Country, like the founder, and with that breeding tradition which dated back for at least a couple of centuries her family had earned the nickname of “The Griffins”. They were also all Gryffindors. Thus, people joked saying that they might as well have sprung from a relative of Godric or he himself. Nobody really knew. They didn’t care for blood status so there was no real records of their lineage. It would have been a joke if the youngest of the Griffins ended up in Slytherin or Hufflepuff… Ravenclaw maybe could still be acceptable. Did her family even care so much? They had never really discussed this topic.</p>
<p>She was now near the stool. She shook away those thoughts and tried to look resolute. She sat on the stool and a moment later the Hat fell on her eyes and all went black. </p>
<p>
  <em> -Oh hey! A Goldfeather girl! </em>
</p>
<p>She felt some relief at the cheerful tone of the Hat.</p>
<p><em> -Worried, huh? </em> -he asked.</p>
<p>-<em> Quite </em>- she thought in reply.</p>
<p>-<em> Ah! Why? Yes, there’s a whole big smart brain here, I’ll tell you. Very smart and refined, that’s often the case with Goldfeathers, but not always… Well, your place from what I see is most definitely GRYFFINDOR!” </em></p>
<p>The Hat shouted the last word and she smiled. Professor McGonagall lifted the Hat off her head and she hurried down the stairs to the Gryffindor table, where she was greeted with cheers and a handshake from both Prefects and Head Boy and Head Girl. She sat down next to a red-haired girl who had been sorted shortly before her, Evans was her name, if she remembered well. The girl introduced herself: </p>
<p>-“I’m Lily! Nice to meet you!” They shook hands, smiling. A hand darted across Lily, who leaned back with an annoyed look, and Jane saw it was Black. She briefly shook it. </p>
<p>-“Sirius, right?” she asked, lowering her voice as the Hall became quiet again.</p>
<p>He nodded, bright grey eyes looking happy, then they focused back on the Sorting. A Corinne Lavelle became a Ravenclaw, then it was Remus’ turn and Jane hoped he would be a Gryffindor, too. He walked to the Hat looking extremely nervous, she thought he was getting paler with every step. When he sat on the stool he closed his eyes, looking somewhat resigned, shaking a little. The Hat, tough, was really fast. He cried out “GRYFFINDOR!” after barely five seconds. Jane cheered with the rest of the table. He came and sat on the bench near her, eyes closed, looking relieved. After a quick round of greetings, Jane patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>-“Hello again, then! Nice we are in the same house!”</p>
<p>He smiled at her, a broad, genuine smile that reached up to his hazel eyes, and nodded. He seemed so overwhelmed with relief that was unable to speak for a while.</p>
<p>As the sorting drew to the end, their part of the table filled with new students and when it was over and the Headmaster had delivered his welcome speech (weird one Dumbledore, in fact. Her cousin Edward was right), their table filled with trays full of every possible food.</p>
<p>Halfway through the first course she was already giddy with the joy, the cheers, the loud chatter and names and faces of everyone. From the other side of the table a voice called her and forced her away from a conversation with Lily:</p>
<p>-“Goldfeather! Hey! Goldfeather!” A boy with spectacles and unruly dark hair was waving at her. She smiled and waved back.</p>
<p>-“Hi, Potter!” </p>
<p>-“Long time no see! How is that old gryphon of yours?”</p>
<p>-“Devon is still fine” she replied, smiling. “Grandpa says he is like wine and gets better with age.”</p>
<p>-“A gryphon?- Black intruded, looking at Jane with inquiring grey eyes. -<em> You </em>have a gryphon? How can it be? It’s illegal!”</p>
<p>-“My family manages the only sanctuary in the country. It’s approved from the Ministry. We mostly leave them be, hiding them from Muggles and only tend to them if they need any specific care, but Devon has a different story and, to cut it short, is very fond of my grandfather. He’s basically a pet.”</p>
<p>Sirius’ eyes lit up.</p>
<p>-“Oh, a sanctuary… I heard of something like that. You are farmers of sort…”</p>
<p>-“Breeders” Jane replied, suddenly cold. Who did he think he was? Calling people ‘farmers of sort’ without even knowing them.</p>
<p>-“Also, the Goldfeathers use mail eagles instead of owls!” added James, with a knowing smile over his second plate of beef pie.</p>
<p>-“Really?” said Sirius.</p>
<p>-“Wait until I get mail, then you’ll see” replied Jane simply. This time it was Remus’ turn to speak, pointing out gently: </p>
<p>-“But you didn’t have any cage with you on the train.”</p>
<p>Jane shrugged:</p>
<p>-“You can’t really cage an eagle, you know…” she replied.</p>
<p>After the dinner, as they were heading to their common room trailing after the Prefects, Lily asked Jane if she already knew many of their fellow students.</p>
<p>-“No, not really- she replied. -I only knew Potter because we’ve met some times before. Trading business matters. They are from our area and his father buys ingredients for potions from my family. You know, hippogriff feathers, eagle feathers and claws and such… We breed them, so we sell a lot of those things… But James and I mostly played Quidditch while our parents were busy bargaining.”</p>
<p>Lily nodded, but looked unsure.</p>
<p>-“I have one friend. It’s Severus Snape, he was sorted in Slytherin. We met Potter and Black on the train, but they were rude.” She furrowed her brow. “Anyway, Sev told me a lot of things about the wizarding world, but I figure there are still so  much I need to know. I have no idea what an hippogriff is!” she laughed a little.</p>
<p>Jane reassured her with a smile:</p>
<p>-“Don’t worry, you’ll catch up sooner than you think!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A couple of mornings later, a huge, golden-brown eagle entered the Great Hall among the other mail owls, causing many cries of surprise and hands stretched out to point it. Jane quickly stood up and moved a little away from the bench and the table where she was having breakfast with her fellow students. The eagle gave a screech and landed on Jane’s outstretched arm. There was a little cylindrical packet attached to her leg and an envelope. Jane smiled in the direction of the table. Many students were looking at her but she meant it for Remus. </p>
<p>She went back to sit and the eagle climbed off the arm to stand on the table. It was a big, beautiful animal. </p>
<p>-“Say hi to Cymru, guys!” she said, cheerfully. </p>
<p>Remus eyes brightened:</p>
<p>-“You named it after Wales!”</p>
<p>-“Yes, but this is my parents’ eagle. Mine is called Eire. She’s probably out there in the forest, somewhere. You can pet him, if you want. Just don’t give him food. He’s greedy.”</p>
<p>While Remus carefully petted the eagle on his neck, she untied the packet from his leg. It was a letter from her parents. They congratulated to her for her sorting and asked about her new classmates and whether she already had some new friends. They also enclosed a picture of the whole family “…<em> So you won’t miss us too much!” </em>. Her father, Robert, his wiry hair and beard a warm auburn colour, and her mother, Ethel, with her long brown braid and smiling green eyes were standing in the middle of it, waving. Next to them, on the left, stood her grandpa Kenver. He had long, snow-white hair tied in a pony tail with feathers attached to it, a broad smile and amber and green eyes that looked almost bicoloured, just like Jane’s. On the right side of her parents stood her uncle Derwyn, who was a Welsh muggle-born, tall and a little lanky, with fiery ginger hair. He had his hands on aunt Chesten’s shoulders. She was short and thin and had long blond hair. They were also waving and were surrounded by their three sons: Ifan, Michael and Edward. Ifan, the eldest, was ten years older than she was and Edward, the youngest, had graduated from Hogwarts the previous year. Her cousins had all taken after the Goldfeather side and Ifan and Michael had the same dark honey-blond hair that grandpa had before going all white, the same as Jane’s; Edward had auburn hair and green eyes. Only Jane had inherited grandpa’s peculiar eyes. In the back, towering above them all, stood Devon. She noticed Lily peeking at the picture, so she gave it to her to look. She probably had never seen a gryphon before.</p>
<p>-“See, this is Devon. He is old, so his feathers and mane are growing white a bit, but he’s still strong” she explained. </p>
<p>Lily looked intently at the picture and gaped in awe. In the picture, Devon was looking in camera with his yellow, keen eyes and his lion tail was whipping the air. Every now and then, he shook his eagle head and opened the beak and Jane knew by heart the low, growling sounds he would make.</p>
<p>-“Pass it here, Jane!” called out Potter. “We want to see the gryphon!”</p>
<p>-“Just wait a sec!” she replied. Lily was still observing the picture.</p>
<p>-“So, you are all wizards in your family? Everyone can do magic?” Lily asked and Jane nodded. “Is your family what they call ‘pureblood’? Severus told me about these things…” Lily continued.</p>
<p>-“The Goldfeathers probably are a pureblood family, right? The name should be quite ancient…” intruded Potter, spreading jam on a piece of toast.</p>
<p>-“They are not” replied Black, rather brusquely.</p>
<p>Jane laughed, a little nervous.</p>
<p>-“Merlin, no! Never really cared much for blood purity” she said. “Grandpa says it’s all trollshit. We just have the habit of letting both men and women pass the family name, if needs be, so it has never died out. Also, we’ve always had a wizard or a witch in some branch of the family.”</p>
<p>-“Yeah, we don’t care much either, I think” said Potter, “but my family is pureblood. Can I see the picture now?”</p>
<p>Jane gave the picture a last fond glance. Despite it being mute, she could feel all of the noise and laughter and bickering they must have made to decide how to stand and where and “<em> Robert stop shouting, she won’t hear you, it’s a picture!”, “Edward don’t make vulgar signs!”, “Oh, please Grandpa leave the chicks, this is already too crowded!” </em> and <em> “Of course, Devon, you should be here, too!” </em>… She had a loud, hearty family.</p>
<p>-“Wait for your turn” she told James, and slid it to Remus.</p>
<p>She noticed Black had an indecipherable look in his grey eyes. Jane hoped he didn’t feel offended by her statement. While the picture was passing from hand to hand because everyone around her wanted to see the gryphon, she opened the packet. Inside there was a dark tawny feather, with copper reflexes, around ten inches long, and a note from her grandfather:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> “This is Devon’s. He is shedding and he thought you should have one before they become all too grey or white. You know he’s a bit melodramatic, but I agree that he may be as white as me in a couple of sheds. Keep it to remind about your old grandpas there while you enjoy the best years of your life, as I’m sure they will be. Fly high, Jane. Always. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Love, Grandpa and Devon.” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jane was trying really hard not to cry. It was going to be really difficult not to miss them now with all these reminders, but she knew they meant well. She caressed the feather, her heart swelling with affection. Then she looked up to check what had become of her picture and saw Potter had it and he was holding it with hands dangerously sticky of marmalade while Black pointed at it with equally greasy fingers and a mouthful of toast.</p>
<p>-“Potter, may I have my picture back?”</p>
<p>-“Just a second. I want to see the gryphon with his wings spread!”</p>
<p>-“You can wait ages then, Devon knows he can’t do that inside the house. Please, give it back.” Jane was getting impatient. </p>
<p>-“You keep it inside?” asked Black.</p>
<p>-“Not really, he comes and goes as he pleases. Picture, please.”</p>
<p>Black looked at the picture one last time, a curious frown on his face, then took it from Potter and unceremoniously slid it back to her. Then he saw the feather in her hand. </p>
<p>-“Is that from your gryphon’s?”</p>
<p>-“Yes, grandpa sent it as a gift.”</p>
<p>-“How sweet. Are you going to braid it in your hair, too, like the shamans of America? You all look kind of weird there…” he said.</p>
<p>-“That’s rude, Black- replied Jane, irritated- We just have traditions… By the way, you have mail, too. Why don’t you mind your own?”</p>
<p>He cast a quick glance at the envelope that a large grey owl had left near his plate and snorted. Jane noticed the elaborate wax seal with the Black coat of arms on it and the thin, elegant cursive writing: <em> Sirius Orion Black </em>.</p>
<p>-“Because making fun of yours is more entertaining” replied the boy with a defiant smile, taking the letter away from the table.</p>
<p>Jane felt vexation rise: </p>
<p>-“Oh, is it? Pray, tell: do your parents call you by your full name?” She snapped back. “‘<em> Seerius Ooreon Black come he-er! Hew are you toda-eh?’ </em> ” She pressed on, mocking the upper class accent of the boy. “Then <em> we </em> are the weird ones…”</p>
<p>-“Mind your business, Goldfeather. Enjoy your cheesy picture” was the bitter reply. Then he stood up, crumpling the letter in his hand and walked out of the Hall.</p>
<p>Later in the term, James told her that Black’s parents had been somewhat disappointed with his sorting. His cousin Narcissa, who was in sixth year had come to speak to him that evening and he had come back looking very upset, barely talking to anyone in the dorm. That explained the sullen mood the boy was clearly still in the following days. James said Sirius wasn’t very keen about the topic, so he asked her to pretend she didn’t know anything. She instantly regretted her words of mock but she didn’t say anything to Black and decided to avoid the topic as much as possible.</p>
