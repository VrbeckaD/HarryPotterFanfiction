    <p>Ron's day had been - well, usual, but shitty. He'd been late up because his alarm clock had decided to finally give up on life in the middle of the night, so he'd been late for class, so he'd gotten a warning - and then he realised he hadn't packed his homework in his rush this morning, so he'd gotten <em>another </em>warning, and sent off to go get it. Okay, fine, but then - fucking Malfoy and his cronies were on their 'study break' (free period, who the fuck studies during study period anyway?) and Ron had gotten - well, got into a minor scuffle - it's not like he <em>broke </em>anything - and Ron ended up being suspended because Malfoy's daddy has <em>money, </em>and his doesn't, and Ron flipped the bird at Malfoy's smug, ferrety face as the car drove past him, hanging around the smoking area with that pug-faced bitch Pansy, on their way out of the car park. </p><p>"Get a good hit in?" His dad asked. "And, well, you know you shouldn't start fights, Ron." </p><p>"I know," Ron said. "<em>I </em>didn't. But you know what he's like."</p><p>"I know." his dad smiled at him, through the rear-view mirror. "So; did you get a good hit in?"</p><p>"Broke his nose," Ron said. So, fine, maybe he <em>had </em>broken something. Ron's just glad his mum wasn't the one who picked him up. He loves her, o'course, but there'd be nothing like her howling to give Malfoy's lot fodder for the foreseeable bloody future. Until they got bored or got better ammo to use.</p><p>"Well, since you're off for the week," Arthur said, "I'll take you into work, they'll be fine with it. Might teach you a few useful skills, you never know."</p><p>"Thanks, Dad," Ron said. </p><p>"I'll have to ask my boss," Arthur reminds him, "So it's up in the air, but they should be fine with it..."</p><p>After his dad drops him off, back at home, and Ron's mum scolds him extensively for getting into a fight (again), Ron leaves his chores for later and grabs his bike, then bolts it, so he doesn't miss his window of opportunity; Harry's 'home', and it's not exactly often the Dursleys leave him chore-less and free to see his friends. </p><hr/><p>Ron Weasley lives in surrey. It was a family home, his dad's dad's dad's dad's - you know, inherited property. Point is, so does his best mate, Harry Potter. Another street entirely, on the other side - but Ron's got a bike for that reason. Harry goes to some fancy fucking boarding school in Scottland - Ron's got the cheaper option, here in London. His mum's family doesn't do much, doesn't really talk to them - but they pay for Ron's education, and all his other brothers' and Ginny's too. Point is, Ron's known Harry for a long-arse time. Since primary, when fuckin' Dudley thought it'd be a fun idea to punch Harry in the face - the four of 'em, him and Harry and Dudley and Piers Polkiss, they ended up in the head's office after the fight got broken up, 'cause it turns out Harry's the kinda person to help people out when they get punched in the face (but not defend <em>himself, </em>work that one out), and Piers is a Crabbe and Goyle type, to Dudley's Malfoy. </p><p>So yeah. They've been best friends ever since. </p><p>Ron rolls up to the park, discards his old bike at the fence and vaults it. "You will not believe what happened today," Ron says, loudly. Harry sits up, swings his legs off the bench so that Ron can sit down. </p><p>"Malfoy?" Harry asks. Ron grunts in agreement. "That's one hell of a bruise," Harry leans forward. "Crabbe or Goyle?"</p><p>"Goyle," Ron says, rubbing at his eye and wincing. "Broke Malfoy's nose though, so - worth it."</p><p>"Solid," Harry grins, leans back on the bench. "How long?"</p><p>"Suspended a week, this time," Ron says. "Won't expel me though. Mum went, Dad went, and the Prewetts are -"</p><p>"Board members," Harry finishes. "Ah, nepotism."</p><p>Ron snorts. "And you? You got <em>another </em>holiday or something?"</p><p>"Mhmm." Harry agrees, nodding. Ron knows something's up = he's known Harry can talk to snakes for half as long as Ron's known him; that trip to the zoo in year six was a real fuckin' revelation. So, Ron knows where Harry goes up in Scottland, that fancy-arse boarding school, it's probably one for mutants. Ron's heard rumours - after all, they <em>all </em>have - about that real famous guy, Dumbledore, having a school for people like him. People like Harry, and his - dead - parents and Ron's - dead - uncles. </p><p>But still. The fact he stays back here, with the fuckers they call his 'family' every two weeks - it's a bit suspicious. No-one can travel that quickly that often, Scottland's on the opposite end of the damned country. And they all know, they do - everyone on this street, at least, know something's up. And while the Dursleys never treated Harry well - fuckin' abusive, when he was younger - ever since Harry started going there, to that school, they've... settled. Oh, they hate his guts still, but they feed and clothe him properly, and they don't give him unreasonable chores any more. It's better than it used to be. </p><p>He still shouldn't have to face their shitty presence, though. Still, Harry'll be sixteen at the end of summer, which is - soon enough. Start of summer in a month, after all. At that point, he's got emancipation, you know, that he can get - and Ron's family'd never turn him away. He's got a place to stay. </p><p>He always will do. </p><hr/><p>A couple of hours later, Ron's sitting in his Dad's lab on the second floor of Riddle's HQ. Ron's Dad's work is... interesting. He's a mechanic, mostly, very good at it. An inventor, too, but that - that's a source of anger and sadness for the Weasleys. </p><p>It's really fucking annoying when your Boss' Boss' Boss steals all your ideas after all. And gets paid millions for your damned work, while you get fuckin' nothing.</p><p>But then that's Riddle for you. A complete arsehole, as far as Ron's concerned. His wife's a nutcase and his daughter is - his daughter. Daddy's girl. And trying to talk to Riddle is practically impossible since you have to deal with his head of security Crouch - Junior, but nobody knows what happened to senior - and his secretary, Snape. </p><p>Ron grimaced. He's had some unfortunate interactions with <em>Snape. </em></p><p>"Remember - don't touch anything," Arthur said. It was a pretty good rule, frankly; his dad's lab was a bit of a nightmare to be in if you didn't know it well. Stuff on every surface, things and fluids and components that are currently very dangerous. They're not supposed to <em>stay </em>that way, everything his dad invents is good for people - but Riddle always finds a way. </p><p>Debts. They're hard to pay. </p><p>"Right," Ron agreed, sat on a stool, hands in his lap very <em>carefully </em>far away from any of the workbenches. </p><p>His bag was on the floor. Ron hoped nothing fell in. </p><hr/><p>Of course, his day got worse very quickly and very <em>awfully. </em></p><p>After his Dad's day ended, around seven - Ron hates his dad's hours because they <em>totally </em>break some sort of rule, but once again, <em>Riddle - </em>they went home. Ron dropped his bag in the hallway and kicked off his shoes, then went into the kitchen.</p><p>He went for a drink, but the orange juice was empty, he searched for food - but the ham was just out of date, the bread was gone with an apology note for spilling the milk all over it in Ginny's messy handwriting, and the butter dish was empty.</p><p>"Great." Ron sighed, rubbed at his forehead. "Just great."</p><p>Ron grabbed a biscuit from the cupboard and munched on it as he went upstairs, having found no leftovers in the fridge. Mum must be busy, otherwise, she'd have put something there. Anyway, Ron went upstairs, went into the bathroom. Cleaned his teeth, washed, yadda yadda - then went up to the top floor, pulled down the ladder and clambered into the attic. Bill and Charlie are long gone, but they'd already had the bedrooms set up by this point - they had the one on the top floor, so that was now a guest room. Fred and George shared, across from Percy, and Ginny had the little box room next to their parents' one, closest to the bathroom.</p><p>So Ron got stuck with the attic. Which is fine, you know, attic rooms are pretty cool, but it does mean he has to make sure the twins haven't pranked the trapdoor when he goes to go in there, and when he goes to leave in the morning.</p><p>Bastards.</p><p>Thankfully, nothing was up with it this time, no water bucket set up to drench him when he pulled the door down, no rubber 'insert animal here' to cascade down on him, no loud sound to start blaring loud enough to disturb anyone in the house - mum was out, Ginny was... somewhere, Percy was studying and the twins were... worryingly quiet, if they were in, and his dad had gone upstairs and crashed the second they got home - so, Ron went up the ladder-stairs.</p><p>Complacent, he'd think, later on.</p><p>Ron got ready for bed, dropped his bag in the corner of the room, grabbed the light switch and pulled it. The room darkened instantly, and though it wasn't really late, Ron was just <em>tired. </em>He'd had a pretty shitty day.</p><p>So Ron dropped into bed. He stared at the ceiling, in the dark, for long enough that the orange of the horizon and the light of the moon outside brightened his room considerably - enough to see the outline of his wardrobe, enough to see his desk and the big details if not the small ones. His room was clean enough, mostly because creepy crawlies like attics and Ron does not like <em>them, </em>so - he made sure to keep the things away by keeping it clean <em>enough, </em>if not particularly tidy.</p><p>Something was crawling on his arm. Ron yelped, instinctively slapped the area with his free hand, and the sting of pain wasn't just from his palm. Ron scrambled to stand, nearly tripped over his feet as he went to pull the light on.</p><p>Ron sucked in a very terrified breath at the sight of the large black, red, and orange - tarantula? on his bed.</p><p>Ron looked at his arm and saw an angry red bite. He looked back up, and the thing had moved. Ron whimpered. How the fuck did that get in here?</p><p>Ron scarpered down the ladder, then down the stairs. He found the first aid kit and quickly tended to the bite, mind mostly blank with panic. Was it poisonous? Was he going to die? He's fifteen, he doesn't wanna <em>die. </em></p><p>After possibly excessively bandaging his arm up, Ron leaned on the sink. He felt - dizzy, and tired, and - and he'd been fucking <em>vulnerable, </em>hadn't he? What if it had bitten him somewhere more dangerous, what if it had attacked his face, what if -</p><p>Ron fucking hated <em>spiders. </em>He went downstairs, to the living room, padded on old, worn carpet carefully quietly. He sat on the couch and stared blankly at the black screen of their old TV.</p><p>The twins' friend Lee breeds tarantulas, right?</p><hr/><p>"What <em>were </em>you <em>thinking!" </em>Molly shrieked, rounding on the twins. "A venomous tarantula! In your brother's bed!"</p><p>"What <em>are </em>you on about, woman?" George asked.</p><p>"Yeah, mum, we've never done anything like that," Fred said, less convincingly.</p><p>"You have very <em>well</em> done it before, young man!<em>" </em>She glared at both of them.</p><p>"He deserved it then!" Fred argued, "It wasn't cheap and he broke it!"</p><p>Ron sank down into the couch cushions.</p><p>"And he was <em>five.</em>" She glared at them harder. "I thought you'd learned your lesson that what you do has <em>consequences </em>when you gave your own brother <em>arachnophobia, </em>but now you stooped so low as to <em>do the same thing again! </em>I have half a mind to - you know, actually, I have a <em>full </em>mind to tell Lee what you've been using his friendship for!"</p><p>"Hey!" George said, angrily. "We'd never-"</p><p>"It wasn't his, mum," Fred said, tiredly, angrily. "Don't bring Lee into this."</p><p>"<em>Then you used a spider you didn't know the level of danger of, in order to scare your brother?" </em>Molly demanded.</p><p>Fred winced.</p><p>"Where did you get it? If not from Lee?" Molly asked, after a pause.</p><p>"Just, around," Fred said. "I found it in Dad's car. Okay?"</p><p>"<em>No!" </em>Molly shrieked. "It is <em>not </em>okay! You know your father's workplace can be <em>dangerous, </em>they're experimental <em>labs! </em>What kind of spider did you even think it was?"</p><p>"Just a tarantula, mum," Fred said. "Nothing <em>dangerous."</em></p><p>"You are <em>seventeen years old, </em>young man, you should know better by now!" Molly huffed, folding her arms. "You're lucky Ron's alright. That could've killed him, you know."</p><p>Fred winced again.</p><p>"You'll be helping me with my business for three months." Molly decided. "And doing all of Ron's chores. <em>And </em>watching anti-bullying PSAs, at least two per week."</p><p>"Mum!" George exclaimed.</p><p>"Not you, you didn't do anything this time." Molly frowned at them both. "Part of the punishment is not being around each other enough to scheme for a while."</p><p>George glowered at her. Fred winced again.</p><p>Ron sank lower down into the couch. Maybe, if he was lucky, he'd sink so far he'd cease to exist. </p><hr/><p>The next day, Ron took off the excessive bandaging to check the bite. It wasn't there, which - probably meant it wasn't nearly as bad as they'd been worried it was.</p><p>Ron shrugged, got in the shower, and put it out of his mind. </p><hr/><p>Ron woke up in the middle of the night, feeling winded and confused, flat on his back on his bed. Looking up, he saw cobwebs on the ceiling.</p><p>Shivering, Ron cleared them off and went back to sleep. </p><hr/><p>Two days later, Ron was sitting at the table. They'd finally gotten enough time at the same time to eat tea together as a family, so they were - whether this was ever a good idea was still up for debate. Ginny was hurrying, having got a lot of homework to do for maths and chemistry and English and - look, year nine is a doozy. All fourteen subjects, it's a mess. Anyway, she wasn't up for conversation, as a result. Fred was sulking in his own way - his jokes at Percy's expense were meaner than usual, though Percy was ignoring him to the point of pretending he didn't have mash potato in his hair (that had caused Molly to whack Fred lightly with the wooden spoon in reprimand). George was glaring at Molly out of - twin solidarity, maybe. And Dad was at work, still.</p><p>Ron clenched his hand tighter around his knife as he cut into the roast beef. At least it's not corned beef. That's something.</p><p>"So," Ginny said, quietly, from her place to Ron's left. "Heard the twins got you good."</p><p>Ron grunted.</p><p>"Hey, I'm not mocking you," She said, "Today, anyway. That was a low blow, a tarantula. Creeping around in your bed..." She grimaced. "Can't have been pleasant."</p><p>Ron took a bite of the beef as an excuse not to answer. Ginny huffed and refilled their glasses with the orange juice. "Suit yourself." She said. "Be a grump, see if I care."</p><p>Ron rolled his eyes, reached for the orange juice, picked it up.</p><p>"Tell Harry about it yet?" She said. "Knows his spiders, doesn't he? Could tell you how close you were to - kicking the bucket."</p><p>Ron clenched his hand tighter around the class, knuckles white. There was a very loud <em>crack, </em>and he jolted - but nobody else on the table seemed to notice. Or - it wasn't a very loud crack, exactly. He just - it felt like it sounded very loud, like, his attention was -</p><p>"You alright?" Ginny asked.</p><p>"Fine," Ron said.</p><p>"Weirdo," Ginny said, elbowed him lightly. "You sure?"</p><p>Ron clenched his hand around the glass tighter if that were possible. He heard a crack again, and this time Ginny glanced at the glass he was holding.</p><p>"Hey," She said. "Don't take it out on the glass, bro. Just -"</p><p>"I'm fine," Ron repeated and set the glass down, what felt like gently, but there was a loud thud - and it shattered on the table.</p><p>"Uh," Ron said.</p><p>"<em>Ronald," </em>Molly snapped and then sighed tiredly. "Just - clean it up."</p><p>"Oh, so he gets let off lightly, does he?" Fred demanded.</p><p>"George -" Molly said, and Fred stood up and stormed off.</p><p>"And you call yourself our mother," George said, dryly. "<em>I'm </em>George, mum."</p><p>"I - I know," She stood, then placed a hand on her forehead, steadied herself on the chair. She huffed out a laugh. "Good lord." She shook her head as if to clear it. "Just clean up the table," She said, dismissively. "I'll - I'll talk to Fred." She followed Fred out of the room.</p><p>"Can't anyone tell how tired she is?" Percy demanded, rounding on the remaining siblings. "We shouldn't be giving her so much <em>stress </em>on top of everything else!"</p><p>"Like you're helping!" George said, loudly. "Can't even land a job, can you?"</p><p>"I'm <em>trying," </em>Percy said, through gritted teeth, "To finish my education! It's all well and good being <em>high school dropouts, George, </em>but <em>some of us </em>want a <em>well-paying job! </em>Some of us aren't bloody geniuses who can get away with coasting by in life! I'm studying to get better qualifications so they won't just take one look at me and think I'm not worth the trouble training me up to standard. You need a degree to get anywhere these days. You need extracurriculars. You need a good network. None of which you understand, because you don't have to bother with the normal workforce! You just peddle your wares online, and you'll be gone with your <em>money </em>before we can blink, so I'm <em>sorry </em>if I'm <em>trying </em>to help my fucking <em>family, </em>instead of tormenting them for the remaining time that I can be here!"</p><p>Percy breathed very heavily, then took off his glasses and furiously cleaned the lenses. "And it's much easier," He said, bitingly, "For people to accept those that <em>don't </em>put on their CV, 'oh, by the way, I can barely see. On top of not having yet finished university, because I need this job to <em>pay </em>for it.'"</p><p>"We get funding for that," George said.</p><p>"Yes," Percy replaced his glasses on his nose. "Because people look so very <em>well </em>at those with benefits." Percy's lips were thin and furious, his eyes hard.</p><p>"We're not just - going to <em>leave," </em>George said.</p><p>"Why not?" Percy said. "It'd be the smart thing. Start up your shop somewhere in London, I know you and Fred have already scouted out a few buildings to rent out. You'd get good customers, and hey, might as well live above the shop while you're at it. And, make no mistake, I'd like you too - much less chance of you blowing us all up with you thanks to your <em>total lack </em>of experiment safety precautions. And - well, once you're living there, us nowhere in sight, maybe you'd forget, like Bill, like Charlie, how difficult we have it <em>here. </em>'Come visit!' You'd say, forgetting the expense. It's happened twice - I have no disillusions it won't happen with you two as well."</p><p>"And what about you?" George asked.</p><p>"Obviously I can't live here forever," Percy said, pragmatically. "I'll move out for university, once I can afford it, and I'll likely stay moved out after that. It's just how life works. But I <em>won't </em>forget to visit. I won't forget how hard mum works. I won't forget how much - <em>bullshit </em>Dad is in. I <em>won't </em>forget how people look down on us, and I <em>won't </em>forget to send home a check on the regular, even if mum and dad don't want it, because I <em>know </em>how much they need it. <em>I won't forget."</em></p><p>Percy looks at George, disparagingly. "And," He adds. "I'll do it all without hurting the people I care about."</p><p>With that, he leaves the room.</p><p>"We wouldn't," George said. He looks at them both, at Ron and Ginny. "You know that, right?"</p><p>"I haven't seen Bill in a long time," Ginny said. "Can never afford to come for Christmas. Egypt is very far away, and archaeology isn't gonna make that money up unless you discover something <em>big</em>. And Charlie - he lives in <em>Romania,</em> most of the time, when he's not busy in Scottland, doing something and pretending he's <em>not</em> for whatever <em>fucking</em> reason<em>. </em>We care about each other, obviously, but there's a real obvious pattern of people <em>leaving.</em>" She stared, hard, at George. "You can leave," She said. "Drop out of school like you're planning. Start up your shop. Make stacks, whatever. Just don't <em>leave. </em>Please."</p><p>Ron quietly left the room, shards of the broken glass on his plate, before they could bring him into this, too.</p><hr/><p>Ron woke up, in the middle of the night, but this time he didn't feel winded, and the ceiling seemed very very close to his face.</p><p>Ron yelped and fell onto his bed. He stared up at where he'd been just moments before long enough to fall asleep again, and assumed it had been a dream come morning. </p><hr/><p>His week of suspension over, Ron's mum drove him back to St. Werstan's - a shortening of the full name of the boarding school, which Ron doesn't actually know - on Monday.</p><p>"You behave now." She held lightly onto his arm as he passed her window, looking at him imploringly. "I don't want to hear anything about a fight again, you understand?"</p><p>"Yeah," Ron said, knowing full well she'd be horribly disappointed. "I understand."</p><p>It was seven in the morning. Molly yawned lightly, behind her hand, having removed it from his arm. "You have a good day now," She said, then smiled at him. "We'll see you on your next holiday."</p><p>"Come on," Ginny said, dropping off the short wall where she'd been sitting, after having gotten out of the car. "We'll be late."</p><p>Ginny didn't stay in the dorms as much as Ron did. Being year nine, she was allowed to - Ron, being year ten, was not.</p><p>"Come <em>on," </em>Ginny repeated, grabbed his arm, and dragged him towards the front gate. </p><hr/><p>Ron hissed and winced, slamming a hand to his ear as their teacher blew her whistle, directing all the students to line up for team picking.</p><p>"Malfoy," Miss Hooch jerked her head to her left. "Captain one."</p><p>Malfoy smugly strutted over to his spot, and smarmily smirked at his sycophants - 'friends'. Git.</p><p>"Zabini," Hooch jerked her head to the right. "Captain two."</p><p>Zabini threw a lazy smirk at Malfoy and went to where he was supposed to stand, slouching 'cooly', according to the giggling girls on Ron's left, and some mildly envious mutterings he could hear to his right.</p><p>Zabini was a classist, sexist dick; Malfoy was a classist, racist dick. Neither of them are good people at all, even <em>remotely... </em>but they're also rich, and some idiots can look past the worst sort of flaws for a bit of that <em>cash. </em></p><p>Ron's going to be picked last, probably. Well. That's if one of them actually decides to pick Neville, and Ron thinks they're enough a pair of dicks to avoid that at all costs, even if it means showing any kind of interest in having Ron on their team.</p><p>Ron would refuse, if he could, by the way. That thought makes him vomit as well; the hatred is easily mutual.</p><p>The other students are picked, one by one, until it's Ron and Neville left. "Weasley," Zabini drawled, tone tinged with annoyance. Neville looked conflictedly unhappy - he's going to have to be on Malfoy's team - Ron grimaced, clapped him on the shoulder, then walked over to his 'team.'</p><p>"Goalie," Zabini designated him, dismissively.</p><p>Zabini doled out the other roles, and then they got into position, meaning, they all started milling about the pitch in the general area. Except for Dean. Dean got into the correct position, near the goal where Ron was situated, Seamus on his left - Dean on the right. Ron likes football, he does, in fact, he's on the team, but that doesn't stop them from picking him second-to-last every time during games. Hooch doesn't really notice or care about the mutual hatred her students display, and she always ends up picking shitty captains. If they step one toe out of line she'd be perfectly happy to expel the person who does, but since she's got no actual power and very little authority, her classes are always a mess. Ron's gotten into more than one bout during them. Rarely does a games or p.e. lesson end without some form of violence and a black eye.</p><p>He'll admit it's useful to let off steam. Mostly it just makes him angrier than he was before, that Malfoy and his cronies can get away with this shit.</p><p>The game starts, and it's a trainwreck. Hooch takes Neville off the field to go to first aid when he's run over - literally - by Crabbe, who appears to think they're playing rugby. There's yelling and screaming and fighting, and occasionally the ball rolls or flies in Ron's general direction, but mostly he and Dean and Seamus are just standing around - the main scuffle is taking place in the middle of the pitch. They're not stupid enough to get any closer.</p><p>"Yo, Weasley, want a beer when we get back to the dorm?" Seamus asked. "This bullshit makes a guy need one, I wager." He added, grinning, as the ball flies over his shoulder, his head, and soars over Dean only to smack into the fence around the pitch.</p><p>Ron watches Crabbe curb stomp Goyle - "You're on the same team, retards!" Pansy screams - and nods, decisively. "Yeah," He said. "That'd be a good one, mate."</p><p>"Nice," Dean said.</p><p>"Watch out," Ron said, and Dean, knowing this school, ducked, letting Boot get thrown over him - Ron grabbed him before he could clothesline on the goal post, shoving him back so he'd only topple painfully on the floor.</p><p>"Ough," He groaned, rolled into the foetal position.</p><p>"Ron!" Seamus yelled, and Ron - found himself holding the ball, having spun around and caught it, one fucking millimetre from his nose.</p><p>"Nice one!" Dean grinned.</p><p>"Shit," Ron said and dodged Bullstrode's tackle. He kicked the ball, and it went soaring - father than he'd kicked anything before - then without conscious effort, dodged Bullstrode's heavy left hook and found himself standing a few steps away, her flat on her face on the astroturf.</p><p>"When'd you learn how to do that?" Seamus yelled, grinning. "<em>Two </em>beers for you, mate!"</p><p>Bullstrode groaned, pulled herself up and glared, worryingly, directly at him. She wiped under her nose, staining the side of her palm with blood, then cracked the broken - bone? - back into place.</p><p>"Ouch," Dean said. He stepped back at her glare.</p><p>"You." She growled, her unwavering, unnerving attention back on Ron. "Weasley. Behind the cafeteria, tomorrow. 12. Don't be fucking late." And with that, she stormed off.</p><p>"<em>Three </em>beers. No, five." Seamus said, decidedly, throwing an arm around Ron's shoulder. "And maybe pray for your life."</p><p>Ron grimaced. Tomorrow would not be a good day - and he's only been back for <em>one. </em>Gah. Ron always forgets how shit it is here, whenever he gets to leave.</p><p>Dean shrugs at him, like, 'what can you do?' He's not wrong, really. It's not like Ron's anywhere near as strong as Bullstrode - her dad's <em>The Strongman</em>. People just pretend they don't have a villain's daughter around because she's fucking terrifying, but oh well.</p><p>Not much he could do, in the end, other than do as she demanded. "Let's get outta here," Seamus said. "Before someone <em>else</em> enforces a death match."</p><hr/><p> </p>
