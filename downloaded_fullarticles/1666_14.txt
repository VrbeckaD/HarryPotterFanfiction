  <em>A group of wizards sat at a table. They discussed many things: Boys Who Lived, dragons, tournaments, and a very interesting girl that could be used quite nicely.</em>
</p><hr/>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">“Eris, don’t you just adore Quidditch? Do they have it in America?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Nora Burke, my lovely and talkative cousin, points at the speedy Seekers and feisty Chasers. I nod along to her words, only half listening. I would answer that, yes, we do have Quidditch in America, but she has already moved on. Her golden waves match mine, speaking to our shared heritage. As one of the ‘Sacred’ 28, our spots in the stands of the Quidditch Cup Finals have been saved for a hundred years. Yet, as I watch the plethora of normal wizards on the stands below, a pang reverberates in my chest.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">America has Quidditch, yes, but I remember going to American football games. Tackling and running and a bunch of teenagers cheering on their classmates as they pounded into each other. I smile as I watch the cheering crowd. My friends and I at Ilvermorny would sneak out on weekends and venture to the nearest town. It was a small town, and they enjoyed sports way too much. But it was fun, a sense of community.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">One that I don’t have in the UK. Technically, I’m a citizen of both England and America. Born in the States, but with British parents, I’m expected to be able to flow back and forth between the two cultures.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Which works in theory, but not when an eighteen-year-old girl has been ripped from the Ilvermorny and forced to transfer to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Nora stands to cheer for Bulgaria. I make an excuse to find food and leave the VIP area of the stands. I pass by Malfoys and… Weasleys?</p>
<p>I’ve been separated from this country long enough to not have an accent and to not care about the ‘Sacred’ pureblood families. But even I know that this is an incredible sight. There are a few notable figures in this area. I don’t really look at many, just glance at the bushy-haired girl and the other boy sitting with the red-haired purebloods.</p>
<p>Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. He’s what, fourteen? Cute. Sucks to be him, though. I would have died from all that attention at his age. So, in respect to this, I don’t glance at him again as I leave.</p>
<p>Walking down the stairs, I pull my ponytail out of my blonde waves and let my hair fall to my shoulders. My hair tie finds its way to my wrist. A hand on my wand, I venture through the crowd. I can smell food, where my parents are probably hanging out. They can’t leave our new flat without running into people they grew up with. An event like this… they must not have even noticed that the game had even started.</p>
<p>I’m in my head, distracted, when I slam into him. A random guy. I wince and step away.</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m so sorry,” I try to smile. This guy is not having it, though. His dark hair is pulled back into a knot. He wears the semi-muggle clothes that some of the wizards around us have tried to pull off. Dark pants and boots, but also a green t-shirt. An Ireland supporter, I guess.</p>
<p>“Watch where you’re going,” he snaps.</p>
<p>This, for some reason, makes me angry. He’s in his mid-to-late thirties, and obviously a more experienced wizard, but I bite back at him.</p>
<p>“It takes two to slam into each other chest-to-chest, dude,” I scoff.</p>
<p>“’Dude’?” he wrinkles his nose.</p>
<p>“Yes, dude. That’s how I refer to people who are rude to me after I’m polite to them.”</p>
<p>For a moment, I’m distracted by his black eyes. They match his black hair, but there is so much more than color to them. For a moment, I see reflected anger and annoyance. There’s a bite to them that takes my breath for a second.</p>
<p>He only scowls at me and begins to walk away. And I make my first big, unknown mistake of my life.</p>
<p>“I’m Eris,” I say, stepping in front of him. I stick my hand out. The man looks at my hand in disgust, then to me. He doesn’t say a thing. “I’m from the States. There, when someone introduces themselves, it’s proper to shake their hand.”</p>
<p>The man shakes my hand out of spite instead of politeness. For some reason, it makes me want to laugh. But I keep a straight face, though I can’t help the friendly tilt of my lips.</p>
<p>“Severus,” he replies. For some reason, the name rings a bell. But then again, my grandmother (my mother’s mother, the Burke and pureblood snob) has gossiped about every wizard and witch in Europe, I think.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you, Severus,” I smile. At this, his eyes widen just a bit. My grin falters. I forget that friendliness to strangers is a uniquely American trait. Both wizards and muggles have commented on my behavior.</p>
<p>But I’m a sucker for punishment, so I continue: “You’re an Ireland fan, then?” I point to his green shirt.</p>
<p>“No,” he says harshly. Simply. As if the syllable hurt to squeeze out.</p>
<p>I shrug. “I’m not a Bulgaria fan,” I gesture to my crimson sweater. “But my cousin insisted we show loyalty. One of the players is an aunt’s half-sister’s husband or something like that.”</p>
<p>“Do you always talk this much?” Severus growls.</p>
<p>I tilt my head. “Well, not to strangers. But since you almost knocked me to the dirt a moment ago, I would say we’re familiar enough for a conversation.”</p>
<p>Severus’s nostrils flare, and I think I hear a chuckle. It’s very faint, but I smile, nonetheless. His expression is still annoyed, though.</p>
<p>“So, you’re not really a fan of the Irish, and I’m not really a fan of Quidditch in general. I’m here because my cousin begged me to come. Why are you here? Is there a dark-haired cousin lurking around, trying to talk your ear off like mine is?”</p>
<p>Another nostril flare and exhale. I’m really killing it, honestly.</p>
<p>“It’s not much your business, but I’m just here for the occasion.” He glances down at me (he’s very tall). “I didn’t catch your family name.”</p>
<p>“Burke.” With this, he freezes. Like, actually stops breathing. I raise my eyebrows. “Severus? Oh, don’t tell me that you’re one of those people that believes all the pure blood superiority nonsense.” Then, I realize that I truly shouldn’t be insulting the beliefs that most purebloods hold to a stranger. I wince.</p>
<p>“Miss Burke, you wouldn’t happen to be transferring to Hogwarts this coming year, would you?”</p>
<p>I frown. “Yes, for my last year of school. How did you know that?”</p>
<p>As soon as the question leaves my mouth, arms embrace me. I step back, startled. My wand is out and pointing at the assailant. The attacker, however, is the blonde-haired and bubbly Nora. I sigh and pocked my wand before she or anyone can notice my paranoia.</p>
<p>“Nora, what the hell? You scared the shit out of me.”</p>
<p>Nora pulls back, about to chastise me for leaving her so long, when she sees Severus. Her whole body freezes in about the same way he did when I said my last name.</p>
<p>“Professor Snape,” Nora clears her throat. My eyebrows draw together. I look between her and Severus. <em>Oh</em>.</p>
<p>“Miss Burke,” Severus clears his throat. His whole demeanor has changed. Well, not really. It never faded from the annoyed dude-I-just-body-slammed-in-to, but now he’s managed to be even stiffer and cold.</p>
<p>Nora looks at me. There’s a flush in her cheeks. From fear and awkwardness, I think. Odd.</p>
<p>“Eris—though I’m sure you’ve already introduced yourself—this is Professor Snape. He’s the Potions Master at Hogwarts, and my Head of House. Hopefully yours, too.”</p>
<p>I turn to Severus. I blink. In just a moment, his hair has been let down and he wears dark robes. I look at Nora. She doesn’t acknowledge the wardrobe change. Hm. Transfiguration? Charm? Perhaps I broke it by running in to him.</p>
<p>“Slytherin Head of House?” I say in a questioning tone. That’s why his first name was familiar. My grandmother would definitely have talked about this man. And… something else is at the tip of my tongue. Something important about this man. I should’ve paid attention to my grandmother’s obnoxious opinions about everyone.</p>
<p>“That’s correct, Miss Burke,” he says to me. I frown. He was calling me by my first name just minutes ago. Disappointment shocks me. Why do I care? I should be embarrassed that I almost talked my future professor.</p>
<p>“Anyway, Eris,” Nora starts to pull me closer to her. “Your dad told me to find you. We really should be going before he worries.” She turns to Severus. “It was good seeing you Professor! We’ll see you soon!”</p>
<p>With that, Nora pulls me into the crowd. I turn around, but Severus has disappeared.</p>
