    <p>Magic knew the instant a new Aspect was created. She felt the Child as it formed in her soul. Awe was not a familiar feeling to Magic. It had been centuries since anything had truly impressed her.The formation of the cosmic universe being the first, followed by the Mortal Realm, Death appearing in the Aspect Realm, her Blessed Mortals, the appearance of Fate, of Time then Chaos. Magic was no longer awed so easily. But there was a Child growing within her.<br/> <br/>She loved her Mate, Death was patient in ways Magic couldn't be, but this wasn't in their plans. They didn't even think it was a possibility.<br/> <br/>It had only been a few million years since they started spending time together since they had built a relationship beyond what their existence required. Nothing like this had ever happened before. So, uncertain and worried, Magic did what she always did when she needed comfort. She turned to her lover.<br/> <br/>Death was wandering the Mortal Realm, hidden behind the Veil when Magic faded into being next to him. He felt a second soul, small and unrecognizable but oh so familiar, travel with her. He let his eyes drift to the people he was watching, knowing his love would speak when her words caught up to her thoughts.<br/> <br/>A young Mortal girl Blessed by Magic was running from a group of Mortals who weren't. They carried pitchforks and sticks of flame. Death knew it wasn't the girl's end yet, but didn't know why. By all accounts, the Mortals should tie her up and set her aflame like they did with the others.For whatever reason, this girl is the first to survive.<br/> <br/>"I'm pregnant," Magic said.<br/> <br/>Death watched as the girl, who declared herself Rowena Ravenclaw, accessed Magic's blessing to protect herself from the flames. He continued to watch as the girl fell unconscious from the sudden influx of power in her spirit paths. It wasn't until the young girl fell unconscious that Magic's words processed themselves in his mind.<br/> <br/>"That's possible?" Death turned to face the Aspect he loved.<br/> <br/>"Apparently."<br/> <br/>"Then the second Soul must be your child's soul."<br/> <br/>"...Death, this child is yours too."<br/> <br/>Death had not made that connection yet. How does a being of Death raise a child of Magic? It made no practical sense. Magic was endless, boundless, and creation. Death was...Death. He was the end or all, the inevitable, the patient one, the Shadow-Lover of those who test their Mortal limits. He couldn’t possibly be a practical choice as an influence on a Child of Magic.<br/> <br/>"I...see."<br/> <br/>What would a child of Magic and of Death be like? Unstable most likely. Would the child's existence be accepted by their siblings? Worst case situation Chaos wipes out the child’s existence, Time decides to reset herself or Fate decides the Child shouldn't survive birth.<br/> <br/>"Do the other’s know?" Death asks.<br/> <br/>"I haven't seen them yet."<br/> <br/>So the others should be oblivious for now. "Do you...want this child?"<br/> <br/>Asking the question, giving his love a chance to request their child's end, is painful. Not in a physical sense, but in the very spirit of his being. He couldn't imagine granting his child an end, but Death knew that...should she ask it of him, Death would grant Magic that request.<br/> <br/>"I do. I love our child so very much,"<br/> <br/>Relief was a good feeling. It flooded his spirt and he wrapped Magic in his arms. She nestled perfectly in his arms and Death could feel their child growing in her spirt.<br/> <br/>"Do you wish to hide our child from the others?"<br/> <br/>They really only had two choices. Hide their child, or not. Their siblings were...hard to predict when it came to the unexpected. Fate lived to plan things out. She could watch the Mortals dance around her plans for ages, but they always played out as she planned in the end. Time was the one who predicted things. He knew patterns and made prophecies for the Mortals to fret over. It often challenged Fate's carefully made plans but that only encouraged Time to keep meddling. Chaos was a wildcard, often doing whatever he felt like, however, he felt like doing, whenever he saw fit to do it.<br/> <br/>"...No...I don't think the others would appreciate our child's existence."<br/> <br/>Death couldn’t agree more.<br/> <br/>"Then, when our child is born, they shall live and grow in the Mortal Realm until they reach their Majority."<br/> <br/>Magic nods before fading away, leaving Death to find a suitable Mortal bloodline for his Child.</p>
