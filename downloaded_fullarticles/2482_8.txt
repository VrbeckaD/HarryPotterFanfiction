  <em>…in which Harry makes a new friend, gets mail for the first time, and uses magic on purpose.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dreams had been there for as long as he could remember. They were the one constant, aside from the Dursleys’ disgust and hatred of him, that he could always count on. In the very beginning, he’d attempted to talk about them. He’d quickly been disillusioned. His aunt and uncle simply didn’t care to listen to him, and if he didn’t shut up before being told to do so there were sharp pinches and hard fingers gripping his arms. If <em>that</em> didn’t shut him up, well… Then there was worse.</p><p align="justify">To be honest, he wasn’t sure what to think of them. On the one hand, they were frightening. To be incorporeal—though he didn’t learn that term for it for <em>years</em>—and all but unable to influence the world around him. To be always on the move, either running from someone or something or searching for something he could never find. To always worry and fear that <em>this</em>, this existence was everything he would ever know.</p><p align="justify">On the other hand they were… safe. The being whose identity he always took was as familiar to him as his daytime persona was, and as the months and years passed they developed a sort of bond between them. To some degree, it even felt as though there were two of them. Harry and the Being. Later on, of course, when he was eight or thereabouts, he’d learned that it was simply his subconscious shaping his dreams into what he needed them to be. Lucid dreaming, of a sort. But even then he allowed himself to believe it, to trust in the Being. To trust that it was a separate entity and yet the same as him, to share brief conversations that were less about words and more about images and emotions. To believe that the Being had a life of its own, that it maybe even dreamed of <em>his</em> life when Harry wasn’t there with it.</p><p align="justify">He knew, as he slowly approached his eleventh birthday—not that the first ten had ever been celebrated—that he should let go of those dreams. That the Being in effect was just an imaginary friend, that it wasn’t normal to hang on to such things. There was no room for him at Privet Drive to be a child, so why shouldn’t he let go of the last vestige of his childhood?</p><p align="justify">Except there was no room for him at Privet Drive to be a child, so he desperately <em>wanted</em> to keep that last remnant of childhood, even if it was an unhealthy one. Besides, he reasoned, there were far unhealthier thoughts he could entertain, far unhealthier things to do, and the Being helped him deal with the daily treatment from his relatives. So he eagerly dove into his dream world every time his chore filled days ended, greeted his other half, his dream friend, his parent and child and protector and ward, with relief and joy that it was still there.</p><p align="justify">But lately the dreams had changed, just slightly. There was a forest, as there had been for the past weeks, but then one night they weren’t alone. There was a man there, far more pale than the moonlight should warrant. He wasn’t too old either; Harry wasn’t good at guessing people’s ages, but he’d wager the man wasn’t even thirty. Far more slender than Harry’s uncle, but that wasn’t too difficult to be.</p><p align="justify">“I knew you were here,” the man said, his hand trembling slightly as he pointed a stick at them. The words echoed oddly, slightly distorted in the dreamscape. It felt strange to hear someone speak, as Harry and the Being had always communicated more through images and flashes of emotions. “I knew you weren’t gone.” There was a glimmer of something in his eyes. <em>Greed</em>, the Being recognised. <em>Greed and triumph.</em> And those were emotions they could utilise.</p><p align="justify">A silent request passed between them. This was the chance the Being had been waiting for. A chance to change its existence for the better. A chance for it to have a body once more. But to do so, it needed Harry’s help. Needed his strength, if he would give it.</p><p align="justify"><em>Yes</em>, Harry agreed willingly, sending it a burst of complete acceptance. They were friends. More than friends. How could he not offer? <em>Take what you need.</em></p><p align="justify">There was pain then, originating somewhere deep inside his chest. His strength flowed out of him, drained into the Being as they rose together as a roiling cloud over the stranger, as they fell upon him and <em>poured</em> themselves into him. Emotions assaulted them, emotions that didn’t belong to them. Fear, despair, injustice, anger. And the Being whispered to the stranger, soothing his fears and raising him from despair, telling him that together they would do so much more. Forget being famous for finding it. By <em>serving</em> it instead, he would learn so much more. He would get the recognition he deserved. No one would laugh at him again.</p><p align="justify">A word stood out among the rush of new things in their existence. A concept more than a concrete object. <em>Hogwarts</em>. Harry had no idea what it was; he was by now barely there, only holding onto the dream through sheer willpower. But while he didn’t recognise the word, the images that came with it spoke to him all the more clearly. It was home, it was safety, it was wonder and learning and power and Harry wanted to go there. <em>They</em> wanted to go there. And this Man was the key.</p><p align="justify">But he was weakening, and even as the Being made for itself a space inside the Man, the dream world was fading, and Harry with it. The Being let him go with a final surge of gratitude and promise, and then everything went dark.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*          <em>ϟ</em>          *</p><p> </p><p align="justify">The world, when he woke up, was on fire. He was burning up, and even the pounding on the cupboard door didn’t overpower the sound of his heartbeat thundering in his ears.</p><p align="justify">“Get up, you lazy freak!” something yelled, but the words were distant, nearly unintelligible.</p><p align="justify">Light flooded his cupboard, stabbing into his eyes even through the eyelids. A whimper tore itself from his throat as he tried and failed to turn away from it. He was disgustingly <em>grateful</em> when his uncle’s heavy bulk filled the doorway and shielded him from the light.</p><p align="justify">“Stop pretending,” Vernon growled, reaching out and grabbing hold of him. Harry gasped as agony tore through him at the touch, and for a second his mind showed him visions of his uncle yanking him out and then slowly dying on the floor because no one would deign to pick him up and put him back on his cot. But the tug on his upper arm stopped almost before it began and Vernon’s hand disappeared. “Dear God, you’re burning up!”</p><p align="justify"><em>Yes, thank you, I’d noticed,</em> Harry thought, but wouldn’t have been able to voice those thoughts even had it not been suicide to do so.</p><p align="justify">Vernon stumbled back, and then the door slammed shut again, dousing the light. “Tunie!” he heard Vernon outside of it. “The boy’s sick, probably contagious, and I <em>touched</em> him. I need a shower. Don’t let Dudley go near him, you hear?”</p><p align="justify">Aunt Petunia answered something from afar, but Harry’s brain was incapable of translating the sound of her voice into actual words. Vernon went away, probably heading for the bathroom though Harry couldn’t care less.</p><p align="justify">Seconds or hours passed. Then the door quietly opened. Mustering what strength he had, Harry jerked his arm up to cover his eyes, another keening whimper growing in his throat.</p><p align="justify">“Here,” a woman’s voice said softly, so different from Petunia’s normal tone that it was difficult to believe it was the same person. There was a soft thunk on the ratty shelves near his head, probably right next to his glasses if he heard it right. “Made you some squash. Don’t think it’ll be a habit, now, but you’ll need the extra sugar.”</p><p align="justify">A flicker in the light on his arm-covered eyes, and then the door closed as gently as it had opened, leaving him alone in the blessed darkness. After resting for a few minutes, Harry reached up above his head and fumbled around until his fingers brushed what Petunia had left for him: a plastic bottle filled with liquid. Squash, he reminded himself. He half carried, half threw, the bottle closer to his mouth, struggling with the top until he could twist it open. The squash was heaven on his tongue. Liquid and sweet, though he’d be damned before he could identify the flavour. He drank it down to quench the fire that gripped him, to fill the void inside of him where his strength had left him in the dream. He drank until his belly felt bloated and the bottle was, judging by its weight, half empty. He didn’t bother trying to get it back onto the shelf, only put the cap back on and lay there with the cool cylinder against his cheek. Then he slept, and this time he didn’t dream.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*          <em>ϟ</em>          *</p><p> </p><p align="justify">If his aunt and uncle were surprised by his swift recovery, they gave no sign of it. Of course, he'd always been quick to get better, but it had usually taken at least a couple of days. Perhaps they expected the same thing now, because even when he dragged himself out of bed the next morning, weak but no longer burning up, he wasn’t put to work right away. Maybe it was simply worry that he was still contagious, but he wasn’t made to cook breakfast for the other three. In fact, he was sent off to the bathroom to shower and pee, then told in firm tones to get his freaky arse back to bed and to not show his face again that day. He was given another bottle of squash to tide him over and at some point in the early afternoon even a not too stale sandwich.</p><p align="justify">Now that he wasn’t too ill to think, he could appreciate the holiday from his household chores. He could also, he discovered, be exceedingly bored. And he found himself actually missing having something to do. That had never happened before; he hadn’t even thought himself capable of that. Not even two years ago when he’d been disabled for two, three days due to a dislocated shoulder he’d eventually had to… locate? dis-dislocate? …whatever the term, he’d had to do it himself. Of course, then he’d been in pain for those days and <em>happy</em> to lie there and feel sorry for himself. But now? Yes, he was exhausted and his cot stank of sweat, but other than that there was nothing wrong with him. And that, apparently, made all the difference in the world.</p><p align="justify">In the relative darkness of his cupboard, he stared up into the underside of the stairs for a few minutes, until memory provided him with plenty of good reasons why that was a bad idea. He wasn’t too keen on getting dust and sand and such in his eyes whenever someone passed overhead. So he put his arm over his eyes again as he closed them. If there was ever a time when he wanted to be able to fall asleep on demand, it was now. And yet the world was all to real around him, without any of the fuzziness on the edges that heralded sleep. So while he lay there and <em>waited</em>, he cast his mind back to the first dreams he could remember, daydreamed his way back into the dream world, replayed every event he could recall. He even attempted to make up stories about him and the Being, but it was frustratingly difficult and in the end he gave up on that idea. Eventually, gradually, the memories became present day and reality slipped away in favour of familiarity.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*          <em>ϟ</em>          *</p><p> </p><p align="justify">There were three of them now. Harry, the Being and the Man. Harry wasn’t sure if it was the newness of it or if it was something different about the Man, but there wasn’t the same <em>connection</em> between them. For the first time, he had an inkling of what his aunt and uncle must think of him. He and the Being had had the perfect existence together—if you disregarded the whole disembodiment, of course—and now <em>he</em> was there, hanging on at the edge of their symbiosis. It made Harry want to lash out, force the Man away from them.</p><p align="justify">There was a sense of apology from the Being. Regret that it’d had to drain Harry like that, that it hadn’t been strong enough on its own to do what had to be done. Harry shook his nonexistent head and similarly communicated his understanding and acceptance. They were family, after all. No, they were closer than family. Harry would give anything to make the Being happy, just as he knew the Being would do the same for him if he needed it. He ignored the vague sense of unease and guilt coming off of the Being and instead focused on the other differences compared to last time he’d been there.</p><p align="justify">A few seconds were all it took for Harry to assimilate what had happened during his absence. The Being and the Man had held a discussion, of sorts, and had come to an agreement. In exchange for the Being <em>not</em> taking over the Man’s body and condemning the Man to the same existence it and Harry had suffered for the past however-long-it-had-been, the Man would help it gain a body of its own. To do that, they had left the forest and were now… somewhere that looked remarkably like England. The Being and Harry were for the most part blind, forced to rely on the Man’s eyes, but what they could see ticked all the British boxes in Harry’s part of their mind. Traffic, fashion, road signs, post boxes, billboards… Once he even thought he caught a glimpse of the easily recognisable silhouette of London Bridge. But there were other parts that didn’t add up. Like the street they were currently on where it seemed most everyone—men and women alike—wore dresses.</p><p align="justify"><em>Robes</em>, the Man corrected, then jerked back away from them as if worried either of them would retaliate for daring to overstep his bounds. When nothing happened for a few seconds, he seemed to relax a little.</p><p align="justify">There were tiny shops along the cobblestone street, but the Man didn’t stop at any of them. He walked them past a pet shop with the most fantastic creatures Harry had ever seen, past a dingy shop selling more of those sticks the Man had pointed at them.</p><p align="justify"><em>Wands</em>, the Man supplied. Clearly his presence had brought on the addition of words to the dreams. Whether it was because he was more firmly anchored in the physical aspect of the dream world, or because Harry was growing up, or because the relative distance between the other two and him forced the three of them to rely on a more verbal type of communication Harry had no idea.</p><p align="justify">They turned down onto a side alley, and it was like crossing over into the bad neighbourhood, provided said neighbourhood existed snug up against the good one. It had to be Harry’s imagination, but the sky felt darker. The houses were dirtier, the cobblestones littered with garbage. Was that blood spattered on the wall? Harry took it all in as the Man cautiously made their way down the narrow street, their physical gaze flickering from dirty window to black-dressed figure to scabby rat to barely-lit lantern in a way that kept giving Harry new things to look at but never allowing him to discern any details. It felt odd, only being able to see in one direction. In a way, it was closer to his daytime life, but after so many years he’d become used to the way he and the Being could see in practically every direction at once, and the change made him feel strange and limited. Still, it would be worth the limitation for all the wonders that a physical body for the Being would bring.</p><p align="justify">Finally and at the same time all too soon the Man turned aside and reached for a door, opening it and stepping into what Harry could only compare to a museum. He’d been to one with school, once. There were items and oddities everywhere. Harry wanted to take a closer look, but the Being directed the Man to the counter, where they proceeded to have a conversation with the shop keeper that Harry couldn’t understand. There were terms he just didn’t get, despite the flashes of images that accompanied them. There were convoluted ways of saying things when Harry <em>knew</em> it was said that way only to prevent anyone from catching them with their fingers in the cookie jar. The information the Being was after was too complicated. There was talk of elixirs and blood and souls and unicorns and all Harry felt was a desperate need to help the other half of his soul.</p><p align="justify">If only he could offer his own body up, but it wouldn’t work that way. He’d tried before, but all he’d given himself was a splitting headache for the effort. He’d then tried to direct the Being to his home, but whenever he tried to think his address or visualise its location… his mind went blank. In his dreams, he literally could never remember his own address, and any time he tried to remember what the house looked like he only got a vague house-shaped grey blur. It was frustrating, but he didn’t expect it’d ever change anytime soon.</p><p align="justify">Unable to follow in the discussion, he just rested against the Being, letting the words flow past him as a river of sound rather than trying to listen in. As long as the Man and the Being understood it all, that was enough for Harry. He was happy just being able to be here with his only friend instead of in his boring cupboard.</p><p align="justify">It took him a few seconds to realise that the Man had stopped speaking mid-sentence.</p><p align="justify"><em>Cupboard?</em> came the question, and then a few moments later a wave of reassurance and patience.</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t a big deal. Sure, he’d have liked a real bedroom like his cousin had, but more than that he’d have liked a family that actually <em>wanted</em> him there with them.</p><p align="justify">“Excuse me for a moment,” the Man told the shopkeeper, and they stepped away from the counter.</p><p align="justify"><em>Talk to us, boy,</em> the Being asked, and Harry recoiled. While it was an interesting development in itself, the Being using words, why did it have to choose <em>that</em> one? Almost faster than thought, images of his uncle flickered through his mind. Berating him, scolding him, hurting him. Always with that same word on his lips. Boy. Well, that or ‘freak’.</p><p align="justify">Alarm and understanding flowed from his companions. A brief pause, and then a wave of apology. <em>I won’t use it again, mine.</em> And this time instead of revulsion the address made Harry’s non-existent eyes tear with emotion.</p><p align="justify"><em>Yes</em>, he burst out, unable to contain himself. Yes, he belonged with the Being. They belonged together. <em>Yours.</em> For as long as it wanted him.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Always. Without you, I would have lost myself.</em>
</p><p align="justify">The Man grudgingly agreed, with a flash of memory back to how Harry had shared his strength. <em>I’m sure this would be much less pleasant for me, had you not been there.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>I’m sorry I interrupted</em>, Harry apologised. This whole verbal communication part made things easier, but they also made things… more distant. He’d loved being so intermingled with the Being that there was no beginning and no end, and now… Now he was starting to see the edges between the three of them. <em>I’ll be quiet so you can talk.</em></p><p align="justify">There was silence for a few seconds, though Harry had the distinct impression there was some sort of communication going on that he wasn’t privy to, and that terrified him. What if they didn’t need him anymore? Now that they had each other, what good was Harry/mine?</p><p align="justify"><em>Shh</em>, the Being soothed, and its presence inside their body flowed into and around Harry/mine as though embracing him. <em>Always mine.</em></p><p align="justify">Always. Harry/mine wished he could believe it. He <em>wanted</em> to believe it.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Believe it.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Slowly, he nodded. He’d do his best to believe what it told him. It had never lied to him before. Of course, it hadn’t had the words to lie with before either, but… It <em>had</em> always been as honest as it possibly could. He believed that.</p><p align="justify">Closing his eyes, he leaned into the touch, consciously letting go of his fears and making the decision to trust. In the relative distance, he felt the Man return to the shopkeeper, heard the conversation pick up again, but he didn’t care. He was wanted, and that was all that mattered.</p><p align="justify">He wasn’t sure when he faded from the dream and returned to the real world, but even there he felt a new kind of purpose in his life. Someone, even if it was only an imaginary friend that existed inside his dream world, wanted him. He could take a lot of ‘boy’ and ‘freak’ and slaps and pinches and more, because that was only while he was awake. When he was asleep, he wasn’t even Harry anymore. He was Mine, and he belonged.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*          <em>ϟ</em>          *</p><p> </p><p align="justify"><em>Things are crazy right now,</em> Mine told the other two some weeks later. <em>There are so many letters, and </em>they<em> won’t let me have even one of them.</em></p><p align="justify">He could feel their piqued attention. <em>Letters?</em></p><p align="justify"><em>I’ve never had letters before. And these are so weird, with a purple seal on the back, and the address even made mention of my cupboard.</em> He sensed anger from the other two and quickly added, <em>Not that I sleep there anymore. They moved me upstairs to my cousin’s storage bedroom instead.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Well, it’s about time</em>, the Man said. Mine didn’t have the heart to tell him it hadn’t been to be <em>nice</em> they’d moved him there.</p><p align="justify"><em>Listen, mine,</em> the Being said, its tone so serious it drew Mine’s complete attention. <em>You </em>must<em> get hold of one of those letters.</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em>But they won’t let me.</em>
</p><p align="justify">The Being made a sound halfway between a sigh and a growl. <em>And are you going to let them tell you what to do for the rest of your life?</em></p><p align="justify"><em>N-no, but I tried, and…</em> It was so frustrating. How was he supposed to grab a letter? His uncle was so much bigger than Harry and it was simply impossible to take one from him. He had even <em>slept</em> under the mail slot, just to keep those letters away from Harry.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Don’t use strength. Use cunning. Use patience. Do it when they least expect it. Concentrate. Have strange things not happened just because you wanted it badly enough?</em>
</p><p align="justify">Mine blinked. He remembered running from his cousin and ending up on a rooftop. He remembered his hair growing out overnight after his aunt had more or less shaved his head. He remembered that sweater he absolutely hated shrinking until it was too small to go over his head. He remembered the glass on the terrarium at the zoo vanishing, releasing the snake inside to try and make it back home to the South America it had never seen before. He wondered what had happened to that snake in the end.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>See? This will work, too. Just concentrate really badly on one of those letters ending up on your bed, so you can read it when no one’s looking. It will work.</em>
</p><p align="justify"><em>Thank you</em>, Mine said. <em>I’ll do that.</em></p><p> </p><p align="center">*          <em>ϟ</em>          *</p><p> </p><p align="justify">Harry woke up, and went downstairs from his new bedroom. He’d do this. His friend said it was possible, and he knew he’d made things happen before. This would just be the first time he tried to make something happen <em>on purpose</em> rather than by accident.</p><p align="justify">His aunt and uncle were already up, which wasn’t really like them. Then again, judging by how they had been fighting an influx of strangeness in their house the past few days he supposed it wasn’t <em>too</em> strange. Not when Vernon had even boarded the mail slot up yesterday.</p><p align="justify">It didn’t stop the letters. Only now they slid in underneath the door and even through the window in the downstairs bathroom. Vernon had a handful of those letters in his hand already, heading to throw them away, probably intending to tear them up in as many pieces as possible first. Harry stared hard at the letters, visualising his bed and picturing one of those letters not on top of it but <em>under</em> it. Safely hidden away where no one could see it until he went to read it.</p><p align="justify">He shuddered as something inside of him flared and drained, and had to lean against the doorframe to keep himself on his feet.</p><p align="justify">“What are you just standing there for, boy?” Aunt Petunia asked. “Breakfast won’t cook itself; hop to it.”</p><p align="justify">Harry shook his head to clear it, hoping it had worked. “Yes, Aunt Petunia,” he answered politely. “I just didn’t want to get in the way.” He headed over to the fridge without protest, taking out the things he needed. Cooking was easy. He didn’t even need to think about what he was doing anymore, so he could spend almost all of his attention on planning when he could sneak away to read the letter that was hopefully waiting for him underneath his bed. With his luck, it probably wouldn’t be until evening. It depended on what his list of chores contained.</p><p align="justify">He cooked and served breakfast, and then stood by ready to refill glasses. He made no protest at not being given anything for himself. He didn’t complain and even managed not to spill anything when Dudley tried to trip him. He was polite and obedient and silent apart from brief responses of, “Yes, Uncle Vernon,” or, “Yes, Aunt Petunia,” or “Yes, Dudley.” In short, he was as perfect as he could be. Not that they would appreciate it, but at least they wouldn’t be upset with him.</p><p align="justify">Uncle Vernon didn’t leave for work today either, withdrawing to the living room to plant himself in front of the telly while Dudley headed out to play with his friends—though he had to whinge and complain quite a bit to be allowed, something Harry wasn’t used to seeing. Aunt Petunia handed him his list of chores before joining her husband in the living room. Harry looked through it and mentally sorted it into the most convenient order, and then had to hold back a gasp of surprise. Fortunately Petunia wasn’t nearby anymore and didn’t see him staring like an idiot at the list for a few seconds.</p><p align="justify">While cleaning Dudley’s room was never one of his favourite things to do, this time it was a godsend. It was right next door to his new bedroom—also known as Dudley’s second bedroom—and it gave him plenty of opportunity to nip into his room to quickly read through the letter.</p><p align="justify">He slipped upstairs and headed into Dudley’s room. While he wanted to run into the second bedroom right away, he knew the Being had been right. He had to be smart. The moment he acted too eager, they’d know something was up. So he focused on cleaning his cousin’s room until he had a small box of broken and unwanted toys. Then he carried it into the other bedroom since all those broken things ended up there.</p><p align="justify">Leaving the door ajar so he’d more easily hear anyone coming up the stairs, he dropped to his knees as quietly as he could by his bed, peering in under it.</p><p align="justify">His heart lurched in his chest. It was there! It was there, and it was whole and it was <em>his.</em> He wasn’t ashamed to admit that his hand was trembling as he reached in and took it.</p><p align="justify"><em>Mr H. Potter</em>, he read. <em>The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.</em> No post code. Huh. How did the letters get there without the proper post code? Not that it made much sense for the mailmen to slip letters in through the cracks when the mail slot wasn’t available, either.</p><p align="justify">He shook his head to clear it. He didn’t have time to worry about this. He only had a few minutes before Petunia was going to wonder what he was up to.</p><p align="justify">Turning the letter over, he only looked at the wax seal for a few seconds—looking at it for too long had led to him being caught last time, after all—before cracking it open and tugging out the contents of the envelope. Again, he thought his heart would stop. It wasn’t possible. How could–? It had just been his <em>dreams</em>! But it was there, in the same green as the address on the front. <em>Hogwarts</em>. He could still remember the sense of warmth and learning and <em>home</em> that had come from the Being at its mention. And not only that. It was, according to his letter, a school ‘of witchcraft and wizardry’. A magic school.</p><p align="justify">It was with pain he folded the letter up and hid it under his pillow before returning to his chores. He couldn’t take too long. He’d have to read more of it later. Crossing to the box he’d left on the floor, he emptied it into one of the larger ones already stationed in the room and returned to Dudley’s main bedroom.</p><p align="justify">Cleaning Dudley’s room had never gone that quickly. Nor had it ever felt like it had taken longer. He hurried through it as much as he possibly could, finding a few more broken toys in the process. Still, he made himself finish the room, even dragging the hoover upstairs (though dragging was a misnomer; he had to carry it carefully up the steps to avoid slamming it into anything and ‘making undue noise’) and taking care of the floors. Then he equally carefully put it away again before daring to nip off with the remaining half box of broken stuff and read the rest of the letter.</p><p align="justify">As he read, his eyes grew wider and wider. He… had a place at this school? He could go there instead of Stonewall High? He… had to… send his <em>owl</em>? What?</p><p align="justify">He did like the name Minerva, though. It was pretty. Wasn’t it the name of some Greek or Roman goddess? He couldn’t keep the two pantheons apart, and the Dursleys had never really approved of him learning things, especially things that weren’t <em>normal</em>, but now he rather wanted to learn about it.</p><p align="justify">He’d ask them, he decided as he hid the letter away again, slipping it in under his mattress this time. Not his aunt and uncle, of course, but the Being and the Man. Even if they were only figments of his imagination, the way Vernon had said invisible friends were, it’d give him some room to talk about it with himself and figure out what to do. Hopefully before Vernon went completely crazy.</p><p align="justify">The rest of his chores couldn’t be done soon enough, and he didn’t dare to give them any reason to think he wasn’t happy about not getting more than the scrapings off of the others’ plates for supper. He only had a couple of days to get back to the school—was it really fair of them to give him that short a time to respond?—and he didn’t want to risk being locked up for being ‘uppity’. And he definitely didn’t want to give Vernon and Petunia any chance of keeping him from going to Hogwarts. He <em>was</em> going there, even if he had to run away from home.</p><p align="justify">Okay, so maybe that wasn’t the best scenario. For all he knew, they might just deny him entry and send him back to Privet Drive. But… the letter had been addressed to <em>him</em>, not to ‘the guardian of Harry Potter’ or similar, the way official letters to Dudley most often were addressed to his parents. Surely that meant something?</p><p align="justify">By the time he made it to bed, adrenaline was still running though his veins, making it difficult to fall asleep. He checked that his letter was still there, and then he lay there, hand pressed to the mattress above where it was hidden. He had a way out. He could get away from this. He just needed to figure out how to go about it.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*          <em>ϟ</em>          *</p><p> </p><p align="justify"><em>I did it!</em> was the first thing Mine said as he became aware of his surroundings. Then he blinked and stared at what the Man was looking at. It was an office, wasn’t it? Except the floor and walls were of dark grey stone. Well, where they weren’t covered with rugs or paintings or wall-hangings. It reminded him of those medieval castles he’d sometimes seen on telly or in history books. <em>Where are we?</em> It was the first time he’d dared to ask that, and he hadn’t intended for the question to slip out.</p><p align="justify"><em>You did it?</em> the Being asked him, seemingly ignoring the second question, at least for now. There was a hint of confusion, but then the emotion cleared up. <em>The letter?</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Yes! I got one, and I can go to a school called Hogwarts and it’s a school of </em>magic<em>!</em></p><p align="justify">Pride and anticipation washed over him. <em>I didn’t expect anything less from you. I am proud of you, mine.</em></p><p align="justify">The Man seemed to ignore them, edging away from them and attempting to hide his emotional response. Despite that, Mine could still feel his nervousness and worry. The Being, on the other hand, wrapped its incorporeal arms around him, holding him so tightly they almost blended into one, and it was everything Mine could ever have wanted.</p><p align="justify"><em>Only…</em> he murmured into the Being. <em>Only I don’t know what to do now. They want ‘my owl’, and I have no idea what they mean.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Wizards send their post by owl carrier,</em> the Man commented, revealing that he had indeed been listening to them. <em>If you don’t have one, you can send it via ordinary mail. There are setups in place to redirect certain addresses to owl post without non-magical people realising what’s going on. For example, anything with Hogwarts in the address.</em></p><p align="justify">Mine breathed out a sigh of relief. That made sense. And surely he could try to get away at some point and use his hard-gained money on a stamp. Except… <em>Will they stop now? The letters, I mean? Or will they keep coming until I send my response back?</em></p><p align="justify">He could sense the Man shaking his head. <em>You’ve touched it and opened it. Breaking the seal and reading it will have signalled the school that it’s been properly delivered to the one it’s addressed to.</em></p><p align="justify">Yet another relief. He rested against the Being for a while before forcing himself to withdraw. He didn’t want it to think him weak or needy. Surely it’d stop being proud of him if it thought that.</p><p align="justify"><em>Never</em>, it promised, making him smile, but didn’t try to pull him back.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>So… where are we? You never said.</em>
</p><p align="justify"><em>We didn’t,</em> the Being confirmed. <em>I would prefer to keep it quiet for now. And… I would appreciate it if you didn’t mention these dreams to anyone from Hogwarts.</em></p><p align="justify">For a few seconds, it was as if all the air had been sucked out of Mine’s lungs—had he had any. The Being didn’t want… But before he could even finish that thought, he remembered the years of running, of hiding, of searching for… for revenge? <em>They’re the ones?</em> The ones they’d been hiding from.</p><p align="justify">The Being didn’t respond at first, but then it grudgingly nodded. <em>Some of them. The others… they might not understand, or they might let something slip to the wrong person. I don’t yet know who I can trust apart from you two.</em> It leaned in closer and slipped a tendril of thought straight into Mine’s part of their mind. <em>And you’re the only one who knows me, mine. The only one I </em>choose<em> to trust.</em> Before Mine could respond, it withdrew. <em>So please stop asking, and don’t try to guess.</em></p><p align="justify">Mine took a deep breath, then nodded. <em>I promise.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Thank you. Close your eyes.</em> It once more wrapped itself around him, and he closed his eyes to what was outside the Man. He felt them move, felt them striding purposefully somewhere, heading down staircases. He heard words, but all he could hear clearly was the Being whispering in his ears, telling him how proud it was of him, how much he’d love it at Hogwarts, how the school would become his true home, just like it had once been the Being’s.</p><p align="justify">Mine blinked. <em>You went there, too?</em></p><p align="justify">Pain and anger and grief lanced through it strong enough to resonate inside Mine, and he regretted asking. <em>I did</em>, it confessed. <em>It was a long time ago, and I’m not welcome there anymore, but it was the best seven years of my life.</em></p><p align="justify">Seven years. If it was still the same, Mine would be… almost eighteen by the time he graduated. Almost an adult.</p><p align="justify"><em>Fully adult</em>, it contradicted, obviously having caught the gist of his non-projected thoughts. <em>Seventeen is when the magical world considers you an adult.</em></p><p align="justify">Oh. He hadn’t realised that. It only took him a few moments to grasp what that meant in extension. It meant one less year he’d have to stand his so-called family. If he worked hard during school and got good grades—something he’d never been able to get before, since he wasn’t allowed to upstage his cousin—he’d hopefully be able to get a job as soon as he graduated, and he wouldn’t have to set foot at… at that house again, he finished when the address refused to come to him.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>It’s good you’re considering your future, mine. Now hold on; we’re going somewhere we don’t have to worry about what you might see.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Mine nodded, but didn’t have time to reflect over what the words meant before his existence was turned inside out and spun around, narrowed into a straw that sucked him through, compressing him into impossibility. He was glad he didn’t have a body, or he was sure he’d be on all fours puking his guts out when they rematerialized. After a little while the Being backed off and allowed him to look out through the Man’s eyes again.</p><p align="justify">They were in a small house, little more than a cabin. It was small and cluttered and old-fashioned and absolutely wonderful. Mine couldn’t stop staring and marvelling at every object he couldn’t figure out a purpose for. It was such a difference to his aunt and uncle’s house—which was perfect, neat and impersonal—that it was difficult to wrap his mind around it. His fingers itched to explore the place, but he resigned himself to simply looking.</p><p align="justify">The Man laughed out loud, the chuckle filling the room they were in—a study, Mine guessed. <em>Go ahead,</em> he told Mine. <em>I’ll follow your lead for a while. Explore as much as you like. If anything’s dangerous, we’ll stop you.</em> And with that, he… stepped aside, pushing Mine to the front.</p><p align="justify">It was the oddest sensation, he had to say. He’d always been just a passenger, first in the incorporeal Being, and then in the Man together with the Being. Now he was suddenly in the driver’s seat, and the body he was in control of wasn’t anything like his own. It was taller and heavier, and his balance was off.</p><p align="justify">He clenched and opened his hands, staring at his fingers, trying to get used to having control over them. He took a step toward the desk, overflowing with papers and medieval quills and inkpots… and promptly stumbled over his own feet when they didn’t move the way he was used to moving. He barely had time to hiss in dismay before he hit the floor, pain spiking into him from his knees in a way that told him there’d be bruises soon enough.</p><p align="justify"><em>Sorry!</em> he apologised, distraught. It wasn’t his body, and now he’d gone and hurt them all. He shuddered as his mind touched on what his uncle would have done had he managed to hurt any of <em>that</em> family this way.</p><p align="justify"><em>Calm, mine</em>, the Being whispered in the back of their mind. <em>We won’t hurt you. I would never willingly hurt you unless I had no other recourse.</em> Its voice tensed as it shot the Man a glance. <em>And I wouldn’t let him hurt you either.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>I wouldn’t!</em> the Man hurriedly assured them. <em>I swear, my lord, I only wish to serve you.</em></p><p align="justify">Mine blinked. <em>My lord?</em> he asked, never having heard those words from the Man before, not once in the two weeks or so since they’d met him.</p><p align="justify"><em>I…</em> Shame and fear spread from the Man’s presence in their mind. Clearly he wasn’t supposed to have said it.</p><p align="justify">The Being sighed and waved the Man aside. <em>I’ll talk to you later,</em> it said. It? He? Mine tried to adjust his thinking. Surely the ‘lord’ part indicated the Being was male, didn’t it? <em>Lie down, mine,</em> it/he said then.</p><p align="justify">Mine, who hadn’t yet climbed to their feet obeyed, laying their body down on the floor, hoping it wasn’t too dirty.</p><p align="justify"><em>Come here,</em> he was instructed then, and he fled from the forefront to bury himself in the Being’s embrace. <em>I’ve been trying to keep you from knowing this, as it is information that might put you in danger.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>I’m sorry, m-my lord,</em> Mine apologised, once more feeling bad about having asked so many questions earlier. Then he swallowed as the Being’s presence around him chilled considerably, going sharp-edged and brittle, as though it/he could crack and explode at any moment.</p><p align="justify"><em>Don’t call me that, mine, unless you truly mean it,</em> it/he told him sharply. Mine couldn’t bring himself to apologise again and only nodded numbly. He was relieved when the Being softened once more. <em>I wish I could tell you more, but there are those who can read your mind, and if they knew about this you would be in terrible danger, and I am not yet in a position to protect you.</em></p><p align="justify">A thousand questions swirled in Mine’s part of their mind. There were people who could… How was that even possible? Magic, of course, but even so… Why would he be in danger? Was the Being in danger? If people could read… wouldn’t they find out there wasn’t just the one mind inside their body?</p><p align="justify">He squeezed his eyes shut and did his best to push the questions away. It didn’t matter. None of it mattered. He <em>trusted</em> the Being, and if it/he told him this was for the best, he believed that. <em>I won’t ask anything you don’t feel safe telling me</em>, he promised. <em>I’ll do my best not to look at where we are. I’ll try not to listen to conversations around us.</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em>Thank you, mine. Now let’s stop worrying about those things. Our host needs to rest in order to maintain our daily life, so let’s just remain in here for now.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Mine nodded. He slightly regretted not being able to investigate the cabin like he’d been allowed earlier, but he’d meant it when he said he wouldn’t ask for anything more than the Being was willing to give him. He sure wasn’t about to complain.</p><p align="justify">Keeping his eyes closed he relaxed into the Being’s hold, feeling them meld together until he was no longer quite sure where he ended and the Being began, just like it had been back when it was just the two of them. Before <em>he</em> had found them and become their host.</p><p align="justify"><em>I…</em> he ventured hesitantly, remembering that night all too clearly. <em>If you ever need strength again, take from me. I’m yours.</em> The Being sure reiterated it often enough, and Mine had never seen any reason to protest. <em>Like you did then, I mean.</em></p><p align="justify">The Being’s presence wobbled in what Mine had come to realise was shock or startlement. A few seconds passed. <em>I hope I won’t have to take you up on your offer, mine. Thank you.</em></p>
