          <div class="userstuff"><p dir="ltr">It was the heatwave of the summer of ‘77 that had it’s wicked grasp on the young lads, forcing them to swelter in the heat. Even so, it was one of those days where it was pleasant enough to sit outside and enjoy the sun for a bit. The birds lazily chirped as they hop from tree to tree near the pond on the edge of the Potter Estate, setting the backdrop for the two boys that lay draped over the wooden dock. With multiple charms for sun protection, they lay on the dock just listening to the sounds of their summer. Soaking in every detail they could get before their schooling was over and their childhoods as well.</p><p>The pinkish one of the two sits up, letting his feet dangle in the cool water below. He looks over at the boy beside him, his brown skin glowing gold underneath the sunlight. A small smile creeps onto his face as he remembers the swing rope incident a few summers back that is responsible for the pale scar that marks the other’s back, happy that his only scar is out of happiness not pain. Sighing as he squints his eyes, looking up into the trees and watching the birds live their simple lives. Living their short lives without war or hatred.</p><p>“Hey, prongs?”</p><p>“Yeah,” James says as he shifts his head to the side, leaving his right cheek to rest against his arm.</p><p>“Remember that Muggle singer I was telling you about? The really flamboyant one?”</p><p>“What was the name? Erm,” he pauses for a moment thinking back to about two weeks before when Sirius excitedly showed him a new album he got from a Muggle shop. “Queen?”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s the one, uh. Freddie Mercury, he, uh, fancies boys and girls.”</p><p>“Really?” James says closing his eyes again. “Muggles are wild.”</p><p>“Yeah,” he itches the back of his neck where the small hairs that wouldn’t quite fit into his tie are stuck to him with sweat. He glances back over to his best friend before dropping his hands down onto his lap. “I’m gay.” He watches a bird swoop down by the water then back into the tree. “I like blokes.”</p><p>“Oh.” James sits up beside him.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Risking a glance at him, Sirius looks up only for him to shift away causing him to send his eyes back down onto his lap.</p><p>“Erm… Have you always been that way?”</p><p>“Yeah.” He thinks back. “I think so.”</p><p>“All those girls…”</p><p>“.....Were me trying to be heterosexual.”</p><p>“Right, right,” James looks down as he nods his head. “It’s fine… as long as you don’t fancy me.”</p><p>“Oh, please, Prongsy. I am way too good for you.”</p><p>“Yeah, whatever,” James slightly teases back and they both smile.</p><p>They look down at their feet distorted and enlarged by the water as they sway them back and forth. Small ripples are sent out with each movement.</p><p>“Have you ever done it?”</p><p>“With a guy? No. I haven’t.”</p><p>“And with a girl?”</p><p>“Yeah, I have,” Sirius says as he shakes his head remembering how much he hated it that night a year ago with the girl from Hufflepuff. And he remembers how much he hated that he hated it.</p><p>“So, erm, is there any guy that you, erm, fancy?”</p><p>“Uh,” he hesitates, “not at the moment.”</p><p>“Does that mean that you’ve never had a..partner?” James says, face distorting with the awkwardness of that question. He turns towards him. “We should find you someone.”</p><p>“It’s fine, really.”</p><p>“No, it’s only fair, you helped me with Lily.”</p><p>“Really, it’s alright.”</p><p>“Well, theoretically, what do you like?” James asks, but Sirius doesn’t answer. “Blonds, brunets?”</p><p>
  <em>It was the way his blond hair spread out messily over his calm, resting face. Sirius notes that it is true what people say. He really does look younger in his sleep.</em>
</p><p>“I like... blonds.”</p><p>“Do you like the tone, athletic type?”</p><p>
  <em>It was the way his strong muscles slowly move under his tan skin as he stretches out the knots that are permanently in his back. </em>
</p><p>“A little bit of muscle doesn’t hurt.”</p><p>“Book worms or-”</p><p>“I’m good. I’m fine,” Sirius says and James drops the topic.</p><p>“Have you told the other guys?” he asks as he tilts his head back referencing to their friends.</p><p>“Nah, you were the first to know.”</p><p>"You’re telling me that I’m your first time?” James says as he touches his hand to his heart. “I am honored.”</p><p>“Oh, shut up, you git!” Sirius pushes him a little as James laughs and steadies himself on the rail of the dock to not fall over.</p><p>“Really, thank you for telling me,” James says and Sirius nods a little. “Now, we gotta get you a boyfriend.”</p><p>“No one knows besides you. I-I’m not even sure if I’m ready for one yet.”</p><p>“Who have you fancied before then?”</p><p>“Well, if you want the truth, Dirk Cresswell.”</p><p>“You fancied him?” His face turns to disgust.</p><p>“Yeah, but that was a while ago,” Sirius says chucking at the awkward crush he had on the poor guy during his fourth year. They sit quietly as their feet slowly move through the water. It’s not awkward like Sirius thought it was going to be, instead, it’s nice. It’s almost peaceful.</p><p>“Come on. I’m tired.” James says standing up as he offers his hand to Sirius. He pulls him up and throws him his t-shirt before throwing his over his head. “You would tell me if you fancied someone, right?”</p><p>"Yeah.” He nods his head and James smiles.</p><p dir="ltr">I<em>t was Sirius running his hands across his back as the other plants kisses along the base of his neck and his collarbones. He feels him touching every part of him, but he wants more. “God,” he muffles a moan. “I think I love you, Moony,” he whispers. Remus huffs a small laugh, looking down at him. “I love you too.”</em></p><p>“Yeah, I’d let you know.”</p></div>
