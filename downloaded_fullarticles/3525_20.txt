    <p>Draco knew the second he saw Harry Potter fidgeting uncomfortably in front of his office door that the whole day was about to go to shit. He had just returned from a rather unsatisfactory lunch in the cafeteria and was determinedly blowing at the steaming cup of coffee in his hand when he turned the corner and found himself staring at the unmistakable shock of black hair.</p><p>Harry Potter was standing in front of his office door, garbed in the Auror’s dark maroon robes and shifting nervously from one foot to another. At Draco’s soft sound of surprise, Potter glances up and stepped forward hastily, faltering when Draco immediately stepped back.</p><p>“Mr Malfoy,” Potter began, in a deeper voice than Draco remembered as he furiously racked his brain for any reason that constituted a visit from Harry Potter the<em> Head Auror</em>.</p><p>Draco had stayed out of all news and tabloids since his trial, keeping a low profile and a safe distance away from any form of Dark Arts that wasn't related to his job. There was no reason for Potter to be standing in front of his office door after almost ten years and yet there he was. However, before, Draco could say anything, Potter continued: “There has been a situation with Pansy Parkinson, she is currently safe with the Aurors but she has asked for you as her contact person.” </p><p>Draco felt as he had been doused with a bucket of ice water. Pansy. Something had happened to Pansy.</p><p>He was her contact person.</p><p>The only time Aurors reached out to a contact person was when a safe-house was needed and the contact person had to take care of all business and explanations of the victims absence from their usual routine. And despite Potters clear downplay of whatever <em> situation </em> Pansy had been involved in, it had clearly been serious enough to not only involve the Aurors, but Harry bloody Potter himself.</p><p>While Pansy being in a safehouse meant she had at least not been hurt to the extant to warrant hospitalisation, it nevertheless still sent a shot of anxiety up his spine. After almost a decade, Draco had hoped that he had left the days of constant worrying about the lives of his friends and family behind him.</p><p>After the war, anyone who had previously even remotely aligned themselves as Voldemort sympathisers found themselves facing a constant public harassment that  eventually become so serious that it forced almost all who didn’t end up in Azkaban out of the country.</p><p>While Potters speech in favour of Draco's involvement at the Malfoy Manor prevented the Aurors from taking him to Azkaban, it did little to sway the public perception of those who had lost loved ones from the war.</p><p>And everyone had lost loved ones from the war.</p><p>As a result, Blaise, Pansy and Draco’s own mother had left hastily to various parts of Europe, to escape and to heal. Draco had been one of the very few that had stubbornly remained, telling his mother, <em> “England is my home and if I have to pay for what I did then so be it. But I’m not leaving.” </em> </p><p>The first two years had been the hardest.</p><p>Determined to make a life for himself outside of the influence of his father, Draco sold off the Malfoy manor and moved into a small flat in Muggle London, unable to find a job or a place to live within the wizarding world.</p><p>After four months of fruitless searching, he finally swallowed his pride and reached out to  McGonagall who showed him far more sympathy than he knew he deserved, and allowed him to complete his NEWTs outside of Hogwarts under both her and Auror Kingsley's supervision. Once he had received the satisfactory results, he had began the arduous process of applying for a healer residency. </p><p>He had seen too much too many deaths. Contributed to many more.</p><p>Healing became a way for him to repay for his part in the war, and while he knew it would never be enough, it was a start.</p><p>The residency application process had been every bit as humiliating and tenacious as he had expected, with Healers from multiple departments in St. Mungo's claiming that his application had somehow never been received, that he did not meet requirements (which was bullshit, Draco had gotten Exceeding Expectations in all of his courses) or that they had somehow simply received maximum capacity one week into the application process and thus couldn't possibly consider Draco. It was only two month later, when the head healer of the Dark Arts department, Healer Maharaj, took notice of Draco’s daily frequenting of St Mungo’s that he had finally landed an internship. </p><p><em> “Someone I cared deeply for made a lot of mistakes in his youth,” </em>Healer Maharaj had said to him after she had offered to interview him, <em>“But he worked to redeem and redeem himself, and I can see the same desire in you Mr Malfoy.”</em></p><p>She had sent him home after that, promising to look at his application.</p><p>Two days later, she had owled him to say that he had been accepted as a resident at the Dark Arts Healing Department with the chance to stay on permanently should everything go smoothly.</p><p>From that point on, Healer Maharaj had stood by him stoutly, insisting to all that Draco deserved the same opportunities as all other Healers-in-training at St. Mungo’s. And though Draco had initially despaired at being another disappointment, another failure, he worked hard for the past eight years, unwilling to let down the show of kindess Healer Maharaj had showed him, and climbed steadily to the position of Acting Head Healer, Healer Maharaj’s right hand man. </p><p>He owed Payel Maharaj as much as he owed Harry Potter. </p><p>It had actually been Draco’s persistent persuasion and his flourishing career that finally encouraged Pansy to move back to England two years ago, with Blaise visiting monthly shortly after. Despite this, they were still understandably wary and were careful to keep a low profile in the public eye to avoid the harassment that had driven them out in the first place. </p><p>Though, evidently, not been careful enough.</p><p>“Take me to Pansy,” Draco demanded, ignoring how Potter tensed when he whipped his wand out of his robes.</p><p>He was neither offended nor suprised, at the reaction considering the relationship between them in Hogwarts was far from stellar. He pointed his wand at a corner of the bleak, white hospital wall and barked out an “ <em> Expecto Patronum!” </em> </p><p>A sleek arctic fox shot out of the tip of his wand, landing lightly on the floor in front of him and settled there to wait patiently for instructions. Its silver eyes stared back up to Draco's as it blinked with a calmness Draco did not feel.</p><p>“Inform Healer Maharaj that I have been called away on urgent family matters.” He told the fox, not bothering to watch it immediately leap through the walls before turning to Potter who was standing there watching him with an inscrutable expression.</p><p>He inclined his head briefly at the Auror.</p><p>Potter had been polite with him so far, and Draco had no interest of being the one to ruin the civility with his former childhood enemy. He had learnt far too much, worked far too hard to regress now.</p><p>“Lead the way, Auror Potter.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p>  </p><p>Draco did not bother attempting to recognize the room Potter had apparated them to; it was likely an unplottable safe-house that ensured the safety of its residence. Instead, he focused on the women in front of him, stepping away from Potter and towards Pansy, who had shakily risen to her feet upon hearing the sound of their apparation.</p><p>“Pansy,” he exhaled, reaching out to her the same time she barrelled into him, “Are you hurt? What happened?”</p><p>Draco noted that she was trembling slightly as she clutched him, muffling a sob in his shoulder. He pulled back to look at her, stroking her back gently.</p><p>“Pansy, dear, talk to me.”</p><p>She shook her head, attempting to bury her head back into Draco's arms before he could get a good look at her.</p><p>Holding her gently but firmly, Draco did a quick once over to ensure that she did not have any physical injuries. While Aurors rarely brought in contact people while the victim was still injured, Draco was taking no chances with his closest friend.</p><p>Pansy's normally sleek ponytail was nowhere to be seen, her face worryingly white with black smudges under her eyes that told Draco that she had been crying. His heart clenched.</p><p>"Pansy, love, please, tell me what happened." He implored as she buried herself back into his shoulder, feeling her frame shake against his. Behind him, he felt Potter move.</p><p>He shifted to look at the Auror, waiting for answers.</p><p>“Ms Parkinson was in Diagon Alley when she was hit with a <em> tardius suffocativum.</em> While the Auror who happened to find her managed to reverse the spell, the spellcaster was long gone by that time,” Potter said quietly, watching Draco with those unreadable eyes.</p><p>“we believe the caster was under a disillusionment spell during the time of the attack so as to escape attention. While Ms Parkinson will have no long term physical damages, her voice is still very weak from the attack.”</p><p>Draco’s grip on Pansy tightened.</p><p>He knew the spell. <em>Tardius suffocativum </em>was most commonly used for torture, the spell slowly squeezing the victims airways shut to make breathing completely agonizing.</p><p>It was a spell meant to harm rather than to kill and while it would become deadly if the victim was left unattended to, it typically had no adverse side-effects once the counter-spell had been cast within an appropriate timeframe. While this might explain the Aurors involvement, it still did not explain the presence of Harry Potter.</p><p>He turned his head to properly face Potter, eyes narrowing.</p><p>“While I appreciate what you have done Auror Potter, attacks on former Voldemort sympathisers have gone on for years. A slow suffocation spell would not have garnered the attention of the Head Auror himself, so, what are you not telling me?” Draco demanded, rubbing soothing circles on Pansy’s back as he felt her flinch at Voldermorts name.</p><p>A quick flash of emotion passed by on Potter’s face for the first time since he saw him standing in front of Draco’s office. Though the professionally detached Auror mask slipped only for a moment, Draco knew he saw something akin to remorse on the Auror’s face.</p><p>While Draco cared little for the pity being extended his way, he was begrudgingly impressed at Potters professionalism.</p><p>Potter had always been emotional and easy to read during their years in Hogwarts, in fact, it had been one of the reasons Draco had enjoyed tormenting him. He must have worked hard for the mask he now wore.</p><p>“Draco,” Pansy said with a whisper, interrupting whatever Potter had to say. As he looked down at her, she visibly gathered herself before stepping away from him, gently moving his hands back to his side.</p><p>He saw that her eyes, though while puffy and red from the crying, also had bags under them like she hadn’t gotten a good night's sleep in days. Draco frowned. Had he really been so busy that he had failed to check up on his friends wellbeing?</p><p>She pulled nervously at the blue blouse she was wearing, worrying its edges as she looked somewhere near his left ear.</p><p>“Draco, I haven’t been completely honest with you.”</p><p>Draco waited, willing himself to stay still, to let Pansy form her words instead of interrupting her and risk any misunderstandings. <em> God, </em> Draco had noticed that something had been on Pansy’s mind for a while now, but he had assumed that she would eventually come around to talking with Draco about whatever it was.</p><p>He hadn’t thought it was be about anything serious, otherwise he would have pressed the issue a long time ago<em>. </em>Instead, he had believed it was something small that Pansy would eventually explain.</p><p>Clearly, he was just as naive as he was all those years ago, when he had believed in fathers lies, in Voldemort's cause.</p><p>Pansy opened her mouth as if to say something, before shutting it again and looking helplessly past him at Potter. </p><p>“Mr Malfoy,” Potter said, green eyes flickering up to meet Draco’s increasingly frustrated grey ones. He was getting tired of having Potter explain everything.</p><p>“Ms Parkinson has been facing harassment for the past three months now, she notified the Aurors a while ago but we have reason to believe that the channels of commuinication was compromised at that point. Thus we have been unaware of the escalating harassment until now,” Potter paused, gazing earnestly at Draco.</p><p>“I am here to both apologize for the gross incompetence of the Auror department and offer her my full protection of Ms Parkinson as Chief Auror.”</p><p> Draco stared unseeingly in his direction as hurt and anger warred for dominance at what he had just heard.</p><p>Anger because even now, after almost a decade since the war, they were still paying for a mistake they had made as uninformed, reckless children. Draco understood that he had to pay for the rest of his life. He had made peace with that. But how much longer did his friends have to pay? Friends that, while admittedly holding bad rhetoric and biased view, never participated even a fraction as much as Draco had in the rise of Voldermort.</p><p>However, anger was swiftly followed by hurt. Hurt because Pansy hadn't told him about this, had met him every weekend for lunch and never once mentioned this. Never once mentioned the harassment she had faced despite Draco being the one that convinced her to move back to Britain.</p><p>God, <em> Draco </em> was the reason she was even dealing with all this.</p><p>Something must have shown on his face because Pansy reached out to take his face in her hands, forcing him to look down at her as she gazed fiercely up at him. </p><p>“Draco, don’t you <em> dare </em> blame yourself for this, you hear me? This is not your fault. I moved back because I had missed it terribly. So don’t you dare make this about you.”</p><p>Pansy's eyes flashed and her grip on his face tightened, likely to emphasis her point. And while Draco would later have a long conversation about friends looking out for each other, he shut his eyes, breathing in deeply as he wrestled his emotions under control.</p><p>Now was not the time for him to lash out, to wallow in self-pity.</p><p>Right now Pansy was suitably shaken up that she had requested for his support and he was going to give it to her. After a minute, he opened his eyes and reached up to cover one of her hands with his before gently moving it away from his face.</p><p>“We’ll talk about this later,” he tells her gently, “after the person doing all this is caught we can fight about about blame.” </p><p>As much as Draco wanted to insist that Pany’s returning and subsequent harassment has everything to do with Draco’s own selfishness to have his loved ones return to the country, there were more pressing matters at hand. Frowning, he shifted his look back to Potter who had maintained a quiet and respectful distance throughout their whole interaction.</p><p>While Draco suspected that the larger reason for Potter's presence was the previously mentioned 'comprimised channels', Draco doubted very much that he would get any more information right now.</p><p>Instead, he chose to focus on the other issue.</p><p>“You said that some of the harassment were public. Nobody else reported them?” He asked Potter, already knowing the answer but nevertheless wanting to gauge the Auror's reaction.</p><p>A fleeting look of anger flashed on Potter’s face at the question, something Draco never thought he would find as reassuring as he did then. He had gotten the reaction that he had been hoping for.</p><p>Potter was famous for his need for justice and his somewhat idealistic notion of morality. Regardless of the past that they have shared, if Potter was upset about the situation, it was likely that something would be done about it. He was far to noble to leave it be.</p><p>“Unfortunately, nobody came forward as witnesses for today, nor did anybody report the clear harassment and attacks Mr Parkinson faced during her public outings.” Potter replied, jaws clenching briefly. "As Head Auror, I fully intend to address this issue with both the Ministry and the public immediately. It is unacceptable."</p><p> Draco nodded, feeling a surge of satisfaction at the look of surprise in Potter’s eyes, who likely expected a bitter and heated argument about the injustice Pansy had faced or the war.</p><p><em>You’re not the only one who’s changed</em>, Draco thought, gazing into those bright green eyes he had once hated so much. <em>I have too.</em></p><p>Draco had had years worth of time to systematically examine and dismantle much of the ideologies he had grown up with. He had been petty and cruel, he knew that now. But Potter likely still associated him with the memories he had of Draco as a mean, misguided teenager. Draco bit down an inappropriately timed smile.</p><p>Potter was in for a surprise if he continued thinking that way.</p><p>“And I trust you will be finding the person responsible for all of this?” he asks, just to be sure. </p><p>“You both have my word,” Potter answered readily.</p><p>“Auror Weasley has been assigned to this case and will be arriving shortly to speak with Ms Parkinson. </p><p>“Weasley?” Draco was unable to hide his surprise. Next to him, he felt Pansy move uneasily, similarly uncomfortable with the choice of Auror.</p><p>“As you had said, many have turned a blind eye to the harassment of former Voldemort sympathizers,” Potter said mildly, “Ms Parkinson, todays attack happened not just due to Auror incompetence but also public negligence stemming from personal biases. I am not willing to risk your safety again, so I have assigned Auror Weasley who will work your case while I remain secret-keeper of your safehouse's location. There is no one I trust more than him.”</p><p>Draco doubted that was all there was to it but he didn’t particularly fancy getting into an argument with him in front of an already mentally exhausted Pansy. He chose to stay quiet instead, deferring to Pansy.</p><p>“You’ve always had a good sense of what's right, Potter,” Pansy said in a raspy whisper, “I will trust your judgment on this.”</p><p>Potter’s face broke into a soft smile at that, and Draco inhaled sharply. It was the first clear emotion from Potter since he first saw him in front of his office and Draco had been resolutely ignoring just how much more attractive Potter now was in favour of worrying about Pansy's safety.</p><p>That is, up until now.</p><p>“Thank you, Ms Parkinson,” Potter said, acknowledging the compliment for the apology that they all knew it was. “We will let you know when the attacker has been found. For now, I’m afraid you will have to stay in this safehouse indefinitely and have all your visitors monitored.”</p><p>“I will stay with you tonight,” Draco added, turning to Pansy who scowled at that.“ I already informed Payel that I was taking me off and I had no other plans tonight anyways.”</p><p> He grinned at how Pansy’s eyes narrowed at the obvious lie.</p><p>If she was readily scowling at him it meant that she was already returning to her exasperatingly stubborn self that Draco loved so dearly.</p><p>“I’m not an invalid Draco, I don’t need you to hold my hand through the night.”</p><p>Draco gave an exaggerated sniff, lifting an eyebrow as he stared haughtily at her, rolling his eyes. “Whoever said anything about hand holding, Ms Parkinson,” he teased, “I merely said I would grace you with my presence tonight, let's not get any ideas shall we?” </p><p>He flashed her a wide, unrepentant grin.</p><p>She shoved at his shoulders.</p><p>“Fuck <em> off </em>, you great big numpty.” She said as he grinned unrepentantly at her.</p><p>Next to them,Potter shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>"Er."</p><p>Draco turned to him, watching with concealed delight at how Potter appeared at a loss as to how to handle the situation. Draco had forgotten how much he had once enjoyed the focus of the other man. He remembered now. </p><p>He did not know if it was a blessing or a curse that he would likely be spending the next few weeks if not months in close proximity to Potter, as Pansy's contact person.</p><p>“Don’t worry about Pansy here,” He told Potter seriously, forcing an impassive face. “She tends to project her own feelings of self-hatred of being a numpty onto others.” </p><p>“<em>Draco!” </em> </p><p>Draco ducked from the throw pillow that was thrown his way, smiling in relief at the familiarity of their banter. Pansy was an ex-Slytherin through and through and Draco showing any signs of pity towards her would only result in a row. Better, instead, to give her a semblance of normalcy and let her come to Draco when she was ready to talk.</p><p>Now he just had to get Potter alone and get the truth out of him.</p>
