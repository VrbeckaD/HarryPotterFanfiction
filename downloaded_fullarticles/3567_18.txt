    <p dir="ltr">Lily Potter Nee Evans was devastated. She had just found her families Grimoire (<em>and what a surprise that was</em>). This may usually be a joyous occasion for a supposed "Mud-blood", but there was a "family curses" section. In it she found a curse that was recently activated.</p><p>"there was once an old sage in ages past that asked a favor of a hero's family member. He once trained an apprentice named Vaati who had curiosity in spades. The apprentice wished more than anything to prove himself to his kin. When Vaati heard his "Master" made a hat that granted the wished of its bearer, he stole the hat. He wished to become the most powerful Sorcerer alive. Yet because of his demonic nature, his heart became corrupted by the dark deeds of the humans.</p><p>He turned his master into a hat, then fled. His darkness desired more power so he sought out a power called the "true force." A hero named Link aided Vaati's Master in defeating Vaati. Yet in the final battle Vaati's master caught a construct a construct of Vaati's magic.</p><p>The master used all of his experience and magic to make a spell so that his apprentice Vaati would have a descendant through the humans. He cast it upon a woman of the Hero's blood line. The princess of the land was enraged at the idea of another of her lands villains having descendants, so she cast spells to prevent it.</p><p>The first spell she cast made it so that Vaati's "taint" wouldn't activate unless a woman of the bloodline bears a female child. The second made it so that a woman of the bloodline couldn't bear a female child. Finally the princess banished the woman as far as her magic could withstand.</p><p>Yet Lily had both a muggle and magical test confirm that she was pregnant with a FEMALE. <em>'oh no...'</em> She was thinking. Wondering if her child would take its first breath. though, she noticed that there was a note at the bottom of the page. Once she could see through her tears she read:</p><p align="center">
  <em>" Please if you manage to overcome Princess Zelda's curse, name your child Gufuu."</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>-Ezlo Sage of the Minish Woods</em>
</p><p>'Gufuu?' she thought, " I'll raise her to be a wonderful Wind Demon." she vowed.</p><p align="center">~~~<em>Time Skip</em>~~~</p><p>"Congratulations," the mediwitch said, " Here is your daughter."</p><p>" Thank you," replied Lily as she was trying to decide what Gufuu's middle name would be.</p><p>" Do you have any names yet?" asked James while he grinned like a loon.</p><p>" Gufuu Link Potter," replied Lily satisfied with her choice.</p><p>" Where did that name come from?" exclaimed James.</p><p>" MY family Grimoire," stated lily proudly, and like an intelligent husband, James left it at that.</p><hr/><p>Gufuu lived the next year enjoying everything her parents gave her. From their love to their gifts Gufuu enjoyed her life to the fullest... Though that changed when her family went into hiding. Although they tried to stay calm, her parents always seemed to be worried about something.</p><p>Gufuu's life was completely shattered when Voldemort played the boogie man on All Hallows Eve. Her parents death at the hands of Voldemort set Gufuu on a new path in life.</p><hr/>

<hr/><p>History lesson for anyone that’s curious~</p><hr/><p> </p><hr/>
<hr/><p>The world of the three golden goddesses was a world of light; a world that was far to imbalanced toward light. They even created beings of light upon the world fashioned in their own image. To fix this, the universe created a god of darkness to live alongside the goddesses. the golden goddesses denied him the right to live in the sacred realm, so he created an army of dark beings like himself to help force his way to "his rightful place." He even gifted them with a natural need to create chaos through bringing about darkness.</p><p>They warred for ages until the golden goddesses created a minor goddess to live upon the surface. in time the dark destructive actions of the god of darkness gained him the name Demise. Even after Demise was sealed the demons helped keep the world of light balanced by creating as much chaos through darkness as they could. </p>
