<p>"Okay, look, Ginny; it didn't mean anything, okay? You know how I get when I'm drunk and- <em>fuck</em>- Shit, I didn't mean to curse, I just... Just call me back okay? We have to talk about this. Call me back."</p>

I thought we were friends. <em>Best </em>friends. Look, if you don't want to hear my voice, we can do this by text. I don't mind. Just… talk to me."</p>

It ruined everything and fuck I'm so sorry. And I shouldn't be shit- I shouldn't be telling you all this right now 'cause I know I'm gonna regret it tomorrow but I really, really love you.

I wish I could take you to bars. I'd love to see the look on your face. I hope everything's going well right now. Happy birthday."</p>

<p>"Harry told me. About the wedding. I guess that I'm not invited, since I didn't know? Or is my invitation just late? Get Harry to tell me, because I don't want to wait for something that won't be coming. Like the past year. Waiting for your call. Or your text. Or just a "I'm still alive, Hermione." <em>Harry </em>had to show me pictures of the ring he got you. <em>Harry. </em>And they were pictures he took in secret. This was supposed to be something we'd share. As best friends. I was supposed to scream with you and help you pick out a dress and reassure you in the middle of the night when you start panicking and just <em>be there for you</em>. I- I'm sorry I fucked it all up by kissing you. But you didn't bother trying to make it okay again. So yeah. Have a great wedding. I hope the cake falls on your dress."</p>

Do you listen to them with your other friends while sipping wine and commenting on how pathetic I am? Well if you're there, Ginny's friends, let it be known that she kissed me back. When I kissed her, she kissed me back. Suck on that."</p>

Harry said you're pre-pregnant. You're gonna have a ginger baby, Ginny. Or one with Harry's awful hair. <em>Ha! </em>Will I even get to be its- its aunt? Probably not, right? Wouldn't want to have your lesbian ex best friend around your child. I- I might corrupt him. Or her. It. Whatever. Congratu-fucking-lations on getting pregnant, Ginny. Hope you enjoy the- the next nine months."</p>

<p>"You know, my girlfriend, Ariana. The one I was with for 7 months. That one. She just dumped me because I still have feelings for you. It's been 2 years. And we see each other sometimes, now. Because of Harry. Because your mom still likes me, God knows why and she told you to get over it. But you didn't. And I didn't. And now Ariana left and I'm so pissed. At you, at me, at her, at everything. Sometimes I wish I'd never met you. You completely fucked my whole life with your smiles and the way you used to say my name. God, I wish I could hate you. I really do."</p>

We were supposed to make up. Start talking again. I had this whole plan. I- I just had to leave you enough messages to get you to yell at me. To call m-me and tell me to fuck off. Then we, we'd be friends again. Fuck it was so stupid. The whole thing was stupid. The calls, the- the messages and the accident. Ginny, please. You can't be gone. You're a fucking witch. You don't die just because- because you slipped down the stairs. That's just stupid. You can't just die like that. You can't."</p>

Then it just got so, so intense. I had all these crazy feelings around you. All the butterflies they talk about in stupid romance novels, the sweaty palms and the warmth in my chest when you smiled at me. Or just smiled in general. I just wanted to see you smile all the time. I just wanted you to be happy. In a way, I still want you to be happy. Even if you're g-gone. Sorry. I still have trouble saying it. I can't even say the other word, yet. It's too much. But, anyway. I just wanted to say, wherever you are, whether you can hear this or not, I love you. I always will. You were- are my one and only. The love of my life. Even if I wasn't yours. You were- are <em>it </em>for me, Ginny. Always."</p>
