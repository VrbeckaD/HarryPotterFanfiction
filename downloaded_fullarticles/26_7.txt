    <p>Fair warning: this story is crack.</p><p>This fanfiction is written by three different authors who alternate round robin style, and each entry ends with the writer giving the next person challenges that she must incorporate into the next chapter. The Original Characters are self-inserts of the authors, but don't judge because that's seriously half the fun of writing crack like this. Cringe culture is dead. End of story. Sometimes chapters leave off mid-sentence and the next writer has to finish the sentence.</p><p>In this fic, SHINee does not know each other, and they all have their own respective backgrounds that we will explain as the entries go on. They are also their current ages and are allowed to be in Hogwarts due to a new policy where older witches and wizards can attend.</p><p>Now, for the biggest disclaimer of all. They are <em>NOT</em> based on their true selves. We are not saying that the members of SHINee are like this at all. Their personalities, much like all the other people included, are warped purely for humor. Don't get mad thinking we're accusing them of being a certain way. We know they aren't like this. It's a crack fic. Things get warped.</p><p>This story is meant to be funny. Don't take it too seriously.</p><p>The authors are:<br/> - Faye → OC is Fi<br/> - Jiayi → OC is Sabrina<br/> - Hachiko → OC is Ryuka</p><p>Read on if you dare...</p>
