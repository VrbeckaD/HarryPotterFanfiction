    <p>Harry shouldn’t have lent the Marauders Map to Ron. With the Map this situation would have been avoided.</p><p>He suspected that Riddle currently thought something along the same lines. Harry doubted the proud Slytherin particularly liked being smashed under anyone’s body, let alone his most hated rival.</p><p>The alarms over the Restricted Section suddenly went off. They were silent and designed to be undetectable for students, but Harry was attuned with his magic well enough to sense them, and from the way Riddle’s body under him went even more tense than before, he assumed the Slytherin had sensed them too.</p><p>They both simultaneously cursed and Harry immediately jumped off Riddle, the other boy following, both rushing to pick up from the floor the books they were trying to smuggle out of the Section before they so spectacularly bumped into each other.</p><p>Unfortunately, they never made it out of the Library before the stuff arrived. Fortunately, they at least left the Restricted Section and were now hiding behind one of the bookshelf. </p><p>That was bad. Very bad. If the Professors would catch him smuggling very dark, very illegal books, he’ll be expelled. There is no way he could get away with just some detentions. </p><p>Riddle was definitely thinking along the same lines right now, judging by his panicked expression.</p><p>The footsteps were just a handful of seconds before discovering them when Harry was struck by an idea. By a very dumb, very dangerous idea but it’s not like he had time to come up with something better.</p><p>So he grabbed Riddle’s shirt and smashed their lips together.</p><p>And that’s how Professors found them the second later.</p><p>“Oh my,” chuckled the Headmaster Dumbledore, illuminating the scene with simple <em> lumos</em>. “What a surprising turn of events.”</p><p>“Mr. Riddle, Mr. Potter,” with a spell, Professor McGonnagal pulled them out of the narrow corridor between bookshelves. “What <em> exactly </em> are you doing here? Need I remind you that the curfew had long passed?”</p><p>“I would say it is rather obvious what they were doing, Minerva,” drawled Snape, looking over them in disdain. He aimed an especially disapproving look at Riddle.</p><p>“The alarms went off,” stern Professor reminded them. “So, Mr. Potter. What were you doing in the Library at this hour?”</p><p>“Em,” unhelpfully mumbled Harry, unsure about the next part of the genius plan he had earlier.</p><p>“I asked him to come,” Riddle suddenly interfered, looking shyly down. Harry spotted a rather convincing blush on his cheeks and could only applaud to his acting skills.</p><p>“And why did you do that, Mr. Riddle?” McGonagall continued to interrogate.</p><p>Riddle somehow blushed even more, “I wanted to… talk to him.”</p><p>“Talk?” huffed Snape, unconvinced.</p><p>“Has the talk gone well?” asked Dumbledore in honest curiosity.</p><p>“It did,” supplied Harry, willing himself to blush too.</p><p>“Excellent! It is always so good to see the young love blossom,” congratulated them the Headmaster. Harry barely suppressed the gag; now wasn’t the time to screw everything.</p><p>McGonagal, though, was still — rightfully — suspicious. “And why the Library, Mr. Riddle?”</p><p>Harry tensed. He didn’t know what to say to that. </p><p>Riddle, apparently, didn’t know either, as the silence hung. And then, suddenly, he blurted, “I find it romantic.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t hold a snicker at that and Riddle sent him a quick glare that all but said ‘do you have any better ideas, you idiot?!’</p><p>“And what —”</p><p>“Why, Minerva, it’s quite enough” interrupted the Headmaster. “It is clear what happened here. The alarms were likely set off accidentally when the boys got too close to them. No need to be so harsh on them.”</p><p>“Twenty points each,” added Snape. “And detention. <em> Separately</em>.”</p><p>And they were finally kicked out of the Library.</p><p>Harry quickly exchanged looks with Riddle. “Good night, <em> Tom</em>,” he smiled prettily.</p><p>“Good night, <em> Harry</em>,” grimaced the other boy in response.</p><p>And they went separate ways to their dormitories, illegal books still hidden in the pockets.</p><p>They may be rivals but that didn’t mean they can’t work together when required.</p>
