          <div class="userstuff"><p>- Bloody hell - Sirius exclaimed, stepping just the wrong way for excrutiating pain to shot at the length of his back. He was part of an ambush earlier. It was overall successful; capturing five Death Eathers who might have a tiny bit of information useful for them. Sirius of course was not happy. He was taken out by the environment… </p><p>Moody went over his head to arrange the attack on an area that was easily controllable which was great. However the area he choose was just a tad little bit hard to move around on. It was a hidden pathway inside a magical forest, with rocky slopes and shadows cast by the large trees surrounding them. All of them were fighting with the elements, but one of the trainees lost, almost falling face first into the group of Death Eaters, shepherded to the clearing. Sirius was quick on his feet until he wasn’t… </p><p>He caught the boy, but as he fell backwards, he had to keep him balanced and did it from his lower back. He only felt the muscles cry out from the strain, then had to forget about it as Moody launched the attack.</p><p>Looking back on that day, he really shouldn’t be surprised that something like that happened. It was the fifth day in a row that he had to go out to the field either as an auror, or an Order member, and his body was starting to slowly turn on him.</p><p>He was so high on adrenalin though, that only after the battle was over did he register that he was uncomfortable. When he moved a bit faster, or turned the wrong way sharp pain immobilized him and he had to sit down on a rock not to fell. Moody turned on him in an instant. </p><p>- Boy? - the magical eye focusing on his body and coming out negative. - Are you hurt? Did someone cursed you?</p><p>- Life… - he murmured. - My back is killing me. </p><p>- Well - started the head auror. He went closer to the agonizing youth and bent down to be on the same level. His mouth could either form a smirk or a snarl, Sirius was not sure which one, and he launched the lowest blow possible to the wounded - you are getting old. Potter, get him home! - he said with finality, not giving a chance for Sirius to backtalk.</p><p>James run over with worry in his eyes, but a quick look at Sirius made it fade a little. He was not bleeding, which was always a good thing. </p><p>- What happened?</p><p>- My back. It got fucked up when I steadied Jenkins. - James was reaching under his arms, trying to hide his laughter.  </p><p>Standing up, even with James’ help, was like asking metal to bend. He was stiff as a log from his hip to his shoulders. Jenkins was looking at him apologetically, but he ignored the newbie, else he would say something he would regret. </p><p>- Come on, Pads! Moony will take good care of you, he might even play nurse, if you ask nicely - he wiggled his eyebrows to which Sirius just sighed. </p><p>- Tosser… - was the only thing he could say through clenched teeth. </p><p>- We will catch the Knight Bus - James steered him towards a clearing. </p><p>- No, just Side-Apparate me home! - he whined. </p><p>- Are you sure mate? - the other asked, looking at him above his lenses. </p><p>- Yeah-yeah! Just get this over with - confirmed Sirius. James grabbed his arm, and without any warning twisted them through space and air and magic. </p><p>Oh shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! </p><p>It was a bad idea… His muscles were so strained he could easily mistake it for the aftereffect of the Crutiatus curse. The minute his feet landed on solid ground, the pain rushed through him and he started to see stars. His stomach lurched dangerously and he could barely contain his breakfast. </p><p>His knees gave in. James kept most of his weight in his arms and eased him down the carpet. It was solid and straight and ceartanly not moving around like the room around him. </p><p>Hearing the commotion Moony rushed out of the kitchen. Kneeling down next to Sirius with his wand at the ready.</p><p>- Where are you hurt? </p><p>- His pride - James whispered. Though he joked about the situation, he was clearly worried about his friend. Long lines etched into his forehead.  </p><p>- Fuck you… - Sirius answered weakly. </p><p>- He strained his back. How? I don’t know. You will have to ask him later when he is more articulate and utters more than swear words. </p><p>- Oh gosh… - Remus lowered his wand and looked at James tiredly. - Go home, James, You are knackered as well!</p><p>Together they helped Sirius to sit up, leaning back to the couch then up on the furniture on his stomach. His face was mushed in the pillow</p><p>- Sure! I’ll leave him to you, Nurse Remus! - he said halfway out to the door. Sirius got hold of the tissue box and threw it in his general direction but again, it was a bad move and a broken sound left his mouth as James left the apartment. </p><p>Remus was looking at him with an affectionate half smile. </p><p>- Nurse? - he asked. </p><p>- Not a word… It was only that stupid stags idea. I can’t even lift my arms.</p><p>Remus was quiet and he did not have the strength to turn around his head. Sirius didn’t have to wait for long, before long fingers were on his back, working out tight knots and sore muscles. </p><p>- You have to be careful Pads - Sirius heard right before he could fall asleep. - You are not getting younger - soft amused laugh left Remus’ mouth at his own joke. </p><p>- Oh how I hate you right now. Attacking the old and weak - he moaned as the pain slowly, slowly turned into something akin of pleasure. </p><p>- Should I stop then? - the other asked, smile in his voice. </p><p>- Please don’t - Sirius mumbled. - I would kiss you now if I could move.</p><p>Remus bent down to Sirius’ head and planted a soft kiss to his brows. </p><p>In that moment, Sirius felt content. Nobody died during this attack, they caught five Death Eaters and he was home, safe, warm and in his lovers careful hands. He was happy, even if the environment turned against him today. There was no mistrusts or arguing, it was peace. Like he was floating up in the clouds. Like a dream.</p></div>
