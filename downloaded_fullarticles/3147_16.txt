    <p align="center"> </p><p>When Harry found him crying in the bathroom he looked disturbingly like a kitten caught in a windstorm - eyes red, shirt slightly damp from the steam rising up out of the enormous Greek baths, hair wild and disheveled. He had always sort of fantasized about seeing Malfoy like this: defenseless, defeated, face pressed hard into the mud and crying out for mercy; but this was just disappointing. Something had finally wiped that smug grin off his face, and Harry hadn’t even been allowed to watch it happen. It felt… ugh. <em>Wrong</em>. Malfoy was <em>doing it wrong</em>.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing in here?” he began; and then immediately regretted it.</p><p>Malfoy’s head snapped up, disgust written all over his splotchy red face. He was shaking. "For fuck's sake, Potter, is there not some other corner of this enormous castle to which you might, potentially, fuck off?” He looked Harry up and down with disdain, bristling and humiliated, his nose dripping fluids onto his already wet knees. Even his voice was wrong - cracked and helpless and much too <em>young-</em>sounding, and Harry suddenly noticed a package of pink ladies' razors sitting open on the edge of the sink. Surely he hadn't come up here to- to-</p><p>Shit, shit, shit. They were going to have to talk about feelings now, he just knew it! And Harry was going to make things worse. "Malfoy, you <em>idiot</em>-" and then stopped abruptly, startled by the ferocity of his own voice. There was probably a right way to talk to people when they were in this sort of - state. "Merlin, Malfoy, you can't possibly - you're not even - I don't even know what to-"<br/> <br/>A smirk played at the corner of the boy's mouth. "Oh <em>well</em> done, Potter, <em>that’s</em> something for me to think about, isn’t it? Now please do show yourself the fuck out before I turn you into a bloody goldfish and flush you down the toilet.” Malfoy somehow managed to be pompous and infuriating in spite of what sounded like quite a large quantity of mucous clogging up his nasal passages.</p><p>Harry wanted to be angry with him, he <em>really</em> did, but he wasn’t sure he could pull it off when Malfoy looked like… that. He took a deep breath. It was well past curfew - not the best time to stage an intervention <em>or </em>get in a fist fight, which was all the options that came to mind.</p><p>"Look, I'm.” <em>Ugh. </em>“Sorry," said Harry, letting his shoulders droop. He was <em>too tired </em>for this. When he’d seen Malfoy's little dot wandering around the Marauders’ Map in the middle of the night, he'd imagined him doing something nefarious. Now, looking around at the cavernous room, he felt like he'd intruded on something private. Huge candelabras had been erected at the four corners of the bathroom, casting everything in a soft yellow light that flickered off of wet surfaces and full-length mirrors. The faucets dripped, each one in a slightly different tone. It sounded a little like someone trying to pick out a tune on a xylophone.</p><p>Harry swallowed. <em>Just don't be an arsehole,</em> he told himself uselessly. "Malfoy, just tell me if you - came here to hurt yourself. Because I'm... here? For you?" Malfoy stared at him blankly, eyes wide, as though Harry had bees coming out of his mouth instead of words. Then something seemed to occur to him, and he turned to look at the pack of razors. A strangled, embarrassed sort of sound escaped his lips. "<em>No</em>," he said after a moment. "Idiot. Though I suppose that’s a more rational course of action than what I actually had in mind when I bought them. At any rate they're useless. Muggle things always are.” He dropped his face onto his knees again, hugging himself.</p><p align="left">Harry felt oddly like he had falling off his broomstick in third year and getting the wind knocked out of him. His stomach kept clenching and unclenching over and over so he couldn’t catch his breath, the reality of all that <em>height </em>and <em>velocity</em> and <em>gravity</em> hitting him at once so that he felt his whole body shaking, inside and out, like a bell that'd been struck. Malfoy's thin frame curled protectively around the itself. He looked as though some vital part of him had been wrenched out through his stomach, and for some incomprehensible reason Harry worried that he might be dying. It was so unlike Malfoy’s usually brash, self-satisfied posture, so tired and diminished and un-self conscious, that Harry forgot who Malfoy <em>was</em> long enough to feel sorry for him. Was that all this was? This bizarre rush of emotion toward someone he had hated so thoroughly for so many years? He wanted to make Malfoy a cup of tea and wrap him up in blankets and tell him that everything would be all right.</p><p>"Well that's - good. I suppose," Harry said. He hugged himself for a moment just as Malfoy was doing. He was supremely uncomfortable. Harry was, in his own estimation, the worst possible person to deal with something like this - but he summoned all the compassion he could manage, and thrust it awkwardly at the other boy as a peace offering. "Malfoy, look, I just - look, I’m sorry. Can you, <em>please</em>, just look at me for one second tell me what's going on? I know you're in trouble, and I know you've been working on something in secret - something you shouldn't. But whatever it is, you don't have to deal with… this sort of thing… alone."<br/> <br/>Malfoy looked at him patiently, like he was <em>dithering</em>, the fucker. “Did you just say <em>please</em>? I must look awful if I’ve inspired civility in the likes of <em>you</em>.” He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked horrified when it came away sticky and wet.  He sat up a little straighter, throwing back his shoulders.  "And no, you can’t help me you… fucking… irredeemable halfwit. It's a wonder you manage to put on your own shoes every morning, or does Granger do that for you as well? Just go away." He waved his hand dismissively, as though he had only to order Harry out of a room and Harry would make it so. He was shaking with the strain of holding himself together, and Harry wanted to be annoyed with him - wanted to go back to their familiar pattern of trading insults and occasional hexes, but at that moment he just felt worried and <em>sad </em>and weirdly sympathetic. And then, without really thinking about it, something he’d heard around school or somewhere, came back to him. It was stupid, of course, it was always stupid to pay attention to gossip and he knew it was probably nothing and he hated himself for asking, but -</p><p><br/>"Malfoy…” said Harry, and Malfoy gave him a look like Harry was the sort of thing that you scraped off your shoes before going inside. “How - how’s your mum?"<br/> <br/>In response, Malfoy buried his face in his arms and let out a quiet little sob. He mumbled something unintelligible and blew his nose in a horrible fashion, and it was all so tremendously embarrassing that Harry didn’t know where to look. </p><p><br/>"Sorry? I sort of missed that."<br/> <br/>Malfoy's eyes snapped up to glare at him once again, murderous and rimmed with angry red.  "I said <em>he is going to kill my mother</em>. He's going to kill her because I can't do the fucking thing."</p><p><br/>With an unpleasant jolt Harry remembered where he had heard about Malfoy's mother. <em>Not</em> gossip. Not something that had been going around the school. It was, in fact, something he had overheard during one of his dreams. Someone had been casually torturing a Muggle, and he had heard Narcissa’s name mentioned with what Harry now realized was probably anticipation.  It had been a particularly unpleasant dream.<br/> <br/>Harry swallowed. He thought about how miserable Malfoy had been all this year.  Harry had been almost worried about him all year, in a detached sort of way - “obsessed” his friends would have said (<em>had </em>been saying, with increasing concern for Harry's mental health), but Harry had always trusted his instincts and this ought to be no different.  He had been quietly keeping track of Malfoy’s eating habits (<em>dreadful</em>), asking his friends about him (<em>not in a weird way</em>, <em>he assured himself)</em>, checking on his little dot on the Marauders’ map at all hours of the night and day (<em>especially when he couldn’t sleep or when he was having a bath, or when he’d had a hard day and was feeling a bit lonely</em>), and he had known that something was wrong. Where were Malfoy's friends? Why weren't <em>they</em> here to pick him up off the floor and save his sorry arse?</p><p>Mothers would be Harry's undoing. He sighed, afraid to ask the question. “What have they done to her?”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy told him.</p><p><br/>"Christ. Are you sure?"<br/> <br/>Malfoy's shoulders stiffened, but he didn't look up. He gave a slow nod, his eyes fixed on the opposite wall, and Harry found that it was impossible not to believe him.<br/> <br/>"Shit."<br/> <br/>They <em>would</em> use his mother, of course they would use her - that was the sort of thing they did.  Malfoy might be a malicious, self-aggrandizing, spineless little toad, but he loved his horrible parents and missed them when they were away, and now someone was using that affection as a crowbar to either pry him open or beat him into submission. Whatever he was up to now, whoever he’d been taking orders from, they had found it necessary to apply force.<br/> <br/>Something fluttered in his chest, warm and protective and vaguely unsettling.  “Listen," said Harry after a long, uncomfortable silence. "He's not."<br/> <br/>Malfoy looked at him, puffy-eyed and annoyed and uncomprehending.<br/> <br/>"He's not going to touch her, Malfoy.  We're going to get her out."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>

  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>"I knew it, I fucking knew it!" Harry growled with satisfaction, dropping back down to lay face-up on the blue-tiled floor. It would have been an exaggeration to say that he was in the throes of ecstasy at that moment. It would have been a <em>very</em> <em>slight</em> exaggeration.<br/> <br/>Harry's voice had calmed down, but his eyes were still fixed on Malfoy's forearm, where he had pulled back a sleeve to reveal his horrible tattoo. Malfoy had been concealing the Dark Mark all year. Harry couldn't stop staring at it, anger welling up in his chest, and he wanted to slap Malfoy for throwing his lot in with murderers and bigots; but Malfoy could hardly bear to look at it at all. His lip curled aggressively when his fingers brushed over the thing, shaking the sleeve back down into place.</p><p>He spoke very softly. "Sometimes I wonder if I could just cut it off." Harry didn't know what to say to that.</p><p>"Oh, for heaven's sake, Potter, I'm not going to <em>do </em>it. I couldn't even bring myself to shave my head."</p><p>Harry stared at him in horror. "Ugh - Malfoy, that's - that's disgusting, is what it is. You with a shaved head? And why would you try to do something like that with a woman's razor from Tesco, anyway? Those things are useless."</p><p>Malfoy scowled at him "Yes, yes," he said techily, "I know that now. I thought if I did it by magic, it might end up being permanent - cosmetic spells are notoriously delicate, and my hair has always been a bit unruly - not like yours," he said, giving Harry a pointed look, "yours is like a traffic collision, but my hair has <em>moods</em>, is what I'm saying. And I thought, if I didn't like it, I could just - make it grow back."</p><p>Harry couldn't help but snort when he heard the phrase "My hair hais moods". Of course it did. Everything about Malfoy had to be so dramatic. "I <em>knew </em>you were up to something," he said, feeling smug.<br/> <br/>Malfoy scoffed, rolling down his sleeve.  "There is something wrong with you, Potter. And in any case, of <em>course </em>you knew something was going on, you only follow me around every second of every day like a chaperone. I have no doubt that there is a chart somewhere on your person right now detailing my bowel movements. My mother should thank you for safeguarding my virginity."<br/> <br/>Harry rolled his eyes at him and smiled. It felt strange to talk to Malfoy like a real person; to laugh with him and answer his insults without an audience watching them. So many of their interactions had taken place in front of other people, and it occurred to him for the first time that one or both of them might have been putting on a bit of a show. It made his stomach sort of hurt, because he would have sworn he wasn’t like that, but now he wondered. "I think we both know your virginity was never in any real danger.”</p><p>Malfoy glowered at him. “Speak for yourself, mop-head. I'll have you know I've been propositioned three times." He looked at Harry archly, and added, "well - nearly three.”</p><p>Harry's mouth turned up at the corners as he tried and failed to look impressed at this. “Ah. Well. To've been <em>nearly</em> propositioned at all… that's pretty clever of you.”</p><p>“It was this French girl who was visiting England for the summer with her parents. She was sort of chatting me up - I'm fairly certain about that, although my French is better now than it was back then, and there was a… tie, involved. It was at a party my parents threw when I was thirteen, and it was all extremely illicit, but apparently wine makes me drowsy.” He said this with his nose in the air.<br/> <br/>Harry swallowed down a laugh and tried to look serious. "Poor girl. Disappointed like that. I hope she at least got to see you in your pyjamas?”</p><p>“I would have been,” sniffed Malfoy, “an extraordinarily good catch.”</p><p>Harry raised his eyebrows and made a show of looking Malfoy up and down as if to verify this claim. He’d meant it as a joke. But as his eyes slid over Malfoy’s surprisingly strong shoulders and narrow waist, his neatly-pressed trousers sticking to him from the humidity, his mouth warm and pink-looking, Harry felt his cheeks getting warm. Well - the girl had reasonably good taste, he supposed. He might have found Malfoy attractive, too, if he couldn't understand a word that came out of his mouth. Malfoy seemed suddenly to notice that Harry was staring at him for longer than he should have been, tilting his head slightly to the side as if to ask a question. Harry coughed and looked pointedly away.</p><p>“And what, may I ask, do <em>you</em> stand to gain from this arrangement?” Malfoy asked, anxiety creeping into his voice. “I can’t give you money, you realize. Father’s more or less cut me off. I don’t have any social or political standing at this point either. I just want my mother back. What do <em>you</em> want?”</p><p><br/>"Well, I mean… what have you got?" Harry said off-handedly, hoping to get the sudden awkwardness behind them, but if anything Malfoy looked more uncomfortable.<br/> <br/>Harry didn’t want anything, really. And he couldn't just come out and say that, actually, he hated seeing Malfoy like this, all his pride and defiance dribbling out into a puddle on the floor, and would have done almost anything to put things the right way round again. Harry considered the awful possibility that he actually preferred Malfoy the other way - vain and spiteful and dangerous - because what would that say about <em>Harry</em>? Something to bottle up and push down as deep as possible into his subconscious until he had some time to sort it out. Or never. Never would be fine as well.<br/> <br/>"I realize I'm not in any position to negotiate." Malfoy ran one hand over his face, looking humiliated and overwhelmed, and hugged his knees to himself again. "If you mean to… if certain things are expected of me..." there was an angry blush creeping up the back of his neck as he hugged himself tightly. "I'd just like to know in advance, is all."<br/> <br/>Harry shook his head, confused. "Malfoy, you've pretty well come over to the other side now whether you like it or not. But you don’t have to… to <em>pay</em> people to do the right thing. Anybody as slimy and disgustingly charming as you are should be able to find a way to make himself useful wherever you go. You'll still be an unbelievable arsehole, but there's nothing either of us can do about that."<br/> <br/>Malfoy's mouth dropped open slightly, a little wrinkle appearing between his eyebrows. "It is extremely disturbing to hear you refer to me as <em>charming</em>.”<br/> <br/>“Oh, shut up, will you?” said Harry. “And look, I mean - you're obviously pants at dark wizarding anyway, so you may as well give it up. You should feel lucky that anyone will have you."</p><p>"That's fair. I am absolutely shit at doing evil," Malfoy confessed with something bordering on pleasure, stretching his long legs against the cold floor and arching his back. They'd been sitting here for too long.<br/> <br/>"You are fucking terrible at it," Harry agreed with a short burst of laughter.<br/> <br/>Malfoy looked Harry up and down and waved his hand at him with evident disgust. "That’s what’s wrong with your side - no standards at all. You people will take anybody."</p><p>"Yeah, well," Harry agreed, grinning. "We should both be grateful for it." And then he froze again. "We have to tell Dumbledore," he said. "He'll know how to get your mum out safely."</p><p>Malfoy looked uncertain.</p><p>"We can't just march in there alone and grab her, Malfoy. Don't be an idiot. We can talk to him in the morning."</p><p>Malfoy looked like he wanted to argue, but instead he pressed his lips into a thin line and took a long, slow breath through his nose. "Fine. I can see how that might be... sensible, under the circumstances. But if you could refrain from mentioning - well." He put a hand over the place where Harry knew his mark was hidden. Malfoy's gaze dropped to the floor and stayed there. He was doing that thing again where he looked about twelve, and Harry went all soft inside.</p><p>"Er, yeah - all right," said Harry. "Don't think of it."</p><p>When they split up and went to their rooms, Harry couldn't sleep. He wondered what he would say to Malfoy when he saw him again. He worried what people would think if they saw the two of them together - nothing good, he decided. It seemed unnatural - <em>was </em>unnatural. But he had gotten himself into this situation, and he wasn't going to back out just because it was weird or dangerous or ill-advised. He liked a little danger in his life.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>The next morning at breakfast, Harry felt like he was slogging through the mud. He sat down heavily, rubbed his face with the palm of his hand, and groaned. Almost immediately a cup of tea appeared next to his plate, double-brewed, with just the right amount of sugar. Thank God for magic. </p><p>High above the tables, the charmed ceiling showed a scene that was almost white. Thick, pale grey clouds were clogging up the sky, so many that they formed an enormous sheet too wide and thick for sunlight to penetrate. At the entrance to the Great Hall, just where students were entering, there was a hint of ragged charcoal grey - as though a storm were right there on the threshold, just out of sight, waiting to crash down on their heads.</p><p>"Oy!" said Ron, dropping onto the chair to his left and immediately grabbing a sausage from the table with his fingers and stuffing it into his mouth. "Where were you last night?" he inquired through bits of meat. "You were gone for ages!" He picked up a fork and managed to get three more sausages in his mouth before Harry had time to think of a response. Harry gulped at his tea, scalding the roof of his mouth in the process, and tried to think of an answer. "Been having nightmares again, have you?"</p><p>Right. Better than having to think of an excuse on his own. "Yeah," he said blearily, "couldn't stay asleep, so I got up and did some reading."</p><p>Ron's mouth twisted up. "Not that chapter Binns gave us on Goblin marriage customs? That's worse than nightmares, that is. What sort of species needs to kill that many small animals for a wedding ceremony?” Ron snorted inelegantly and drank his entire glass of pumpkin juice in one go. “Reading entrails. It's enough to put you off your dinner.” He shoveled an enormous forkful of eggs into his maw and chewed enthusiastically. Harry found it impossible to look away.</p><p>"I figured I could just use Hermione's notes and skip the reading," Harry replied. Ron grunted at this, but said nothing. Ron and Hermione were not on speaking terms this week. They had always argued and bickered, but it had gotten so much worse lately and it was sort of hard to watch. Ever since Ron and Lavendar had started “officially” going out, Hermione had put Ron under the full silent treatment. Worst of all, Harry sometimes thought that he deserved it. "Anyway, I'll be all right," said Harry, casting about for a piece of bread to butter. He had tried talking to Ron about Hermione (and vise versa) enough times to know that it was useless to try to intervene. Neither of them had ever been very sensible when it came to the other. Still, it made it awkward for Harry that he couldn't spend time with his two best friends in the same room.</p><p>Harry didn't know what to say. All around him, quiet conversations were starting to buzz and bubble. He turned toward the entrance, seeing that the dark stain of storm clouds had crept further into the room, still hovering over the threshold but now twisting and changing aggressively as the wind raged. Just then, Malfoy walked through the door looking infuriatingly refreshed and cheerful.</p><p>His perfect hair was just stupid, for one thing. The red around his eyes had disappeared, and he was smirking and chatting as he took his seat at the Slytherin table, serving himself a healthy portion of eggs on toast. And then for just a fraction of a second, he looked up and met Harry's eyes. Something warm washed over Harry, as though he'd stepped into a hot shower on an cold morning, and he felt himself tense momentarily before Malfoy looked hurriedly away and poured himself a cup of tea.  And that's when it occurred to him that he and Draco Malfoy had a secret.</p><p>There was a droning in Harry’s left ear, and he turned toward it, realizing as he did so that he had no idea what Ron was on about. Quidditch?</p><p>…pie?</p><p>“Which leaves out all the really usable options, so you’re just left with whatever anybody else didn’t want. But I did get a nice pair of miffkins there when I was a kid.”</p><p>No fucking clue.</p><p>“So do you want to go next weekend?” Ron pressed, and Harry just nodded, hoping that he looked like someone who'd been paying attention all along.</p><p>“Brilliant!” Ron said, smiling as he took a pancake in his hand, slathered it with gooseberry jam and swallowed it whole. “I'll let Dad know. Don't forget your boots,” he said, winking at Harry like this was a joke he ought to understand, and got up from the table with three more pancakes in hand.</p><p>Harry couldn't tell his friends about what happened last light. He had always told them everything, but it wasn't his secret to tell, and he felt strangeley protective of the fragile truce that he and Malfoy had reached. Maybe he could tell them eventually, but not until he was sure that he knew what was going on himself. Part of him wanted to pull Ron into a room somewhere and confess everything, but what would he even say? “Hey," said Ron, "I'll meet you in class, right? I have somewhere to be.” He raised his eyebrows in a way that was almost definitely meant to be suggestive, and Harry grimaced, hoping that Ron would spare him any embarrassing details.</p><p>“Sure. Great,” said Harry, and got back to his toast, feeling unsettled in a number of different ways. After breakfast he would talk to Dumbledore. They would sort it all out.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>***</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>Dumbledore seemed rather pleased when they walked in his door, as though he had guessed a secret but hadn't wanted to want to spoil it for anyone else. They were in different classes at the start of the day, but they had both slagged off by pretending to be ill (great thanks to Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes for their line of ready-made flu symptoms), and arrived at the Headmaster's office ten minutes apart. Malfoy still looked a little green around the gills. </p><p>Dumbledore arranged for Malfoy to serve detention with Professor Flitwick every night for the next two weeks, during which time a variety of people debriefed Malfoy regarding his time at the Manor - looking for information that would lead to his mother's freedom, as well as anything else that the resistance could use to weaken Voldemort's grip on his followers and the Ministry. And Malfoy turned out to be a wealth of information - helpful, intuitive about people, with an extraordinary memory for names and subtle rivalries that could be exploited to encourage infighting. Dumbledore said at the outset that there was no reason for Harry to have anything to do with these discussions - some of the descriptions were rather disturbing, and he thought it would be like putting him through his worst nightmares with Voldemort over and over again without ever being able to respond in a constructive way.  Harry felt both irritated and touched that the older wizard wanted to spare him.<br/> <br/>But the boys insisted on having Harry present during every de-briefing. Much to Harry's surprise, Malfoy demanded this concession even more adamantly than he did, almost to the point of pleading. He still scowled at Harry all the time they were together, still took every opportunity to take the piss out of him during their lessons (though Harry sometimes thought he caught a glance that was altogether warmer and friendlier than they would have shared a month before), but between the hours of 8:30 and 9:15 p.m. each night they sat side by side in a strange sort of solidarity as Malfoy slowly unraveled the weeks and months he had spent living under the same roof as Voldemort. <br/> <br/>Harry learned a great many things that he had never wanted to know: specific methods and devices involved in the practice of magical torture; the sexual fetishes of several prominent Death Eaters, which apparently had been on display in public areas of the Manor; practical applications of ritualistic dark magic; the names and physical descriptions and revolting appetites of Fenrir Greyback's werewolf pack.  Malfoy answered every question in a kind of detached, anxious monotone, but Harry understood from the way the other boy's voice would catch or his hands would shake under the table that he had spent his summer holidays in a state of constant panic. He had patiently warded the shit out of his room every night for three months, only to lie awake in bed thinking about better ways to die than at the hands of a psychopath. Malfoy had no illusions anymore about the nobility of his father's cause - that much was clear. And as much as Harry hated him, he realized how powerless he must have felt living in that house. His parents had found a monster and brought it inside.<br/> <br/>Harry asked him, after that first night, why Malfoy wanted <em>him</em> of all people to act as a witness to all these horrible confessions (because that was definitely what Harry was there for). It felt almost painfully private; like watching someone sleep, or thumbing through a stack of their love letters, or re-living their memories with the help of a pensieve.<br/> <br/>Malfoy swallowed thickly, his expression grim. "I suppose I… I trust you," he confessed - sounding embarrassed and disgusted with himself in spite of the way his shoulders seemed to relax. "I don't trust <em>them</em>."</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>***</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>A few of Harry's professors seemed to notice that something was wrong. They asked how he was doing or tried to tell him not to worry, but nobody, either in the Order or out, told Harry and Malfoy anything they didn't already know. It was infuriating. Professor Flitwick insisted that a plan was quickly coming together to get Narcissa Malfoy out of harm's way, but he claimed that knowing the details of the operation would only put them both at risk. What he didn’t say was that all of them still suspected Malfoy might be playing a game: pretending to switch sides in order to obtain useful information on his father's behalf. He also seemed worried that Harry, in spite of his (admittedly unsuccessful) training in Occlumency might accidentally communicate some name or important detail to the enemy.  The less either of them knew, the better.</p><p>"There are very capable wizards and witches handling this, now, boys," he told them with a frown. "It's too much to put on your young shoulders. You're doing your part already. Leave the rest to <em>us</em>." He glanced at the circles under Harry's eyes, ugly and now as dark as bruises, and frowned. "And for heaven's sake, do try to get some sleep."<br/> <br/>After they'd been told nothing except “hurry along to bed” for three nights in a row, they were both seething. They resented being treated as if they were helpless first years when both of them had been up to their necks in Dark wizards (in wildly different circumstances, yes, but <em>still</em>), and survived. Malfoy's mother was the one in danger, after all - he had a right to know things. And hadn’t Harry proved himself capable, again and again? Why was it never enough to earn him any respect from the other members of the Order?</p><p>And so on the third night, in a move that was not the least bit childish or contrary, they decided to fuck off to the kitchens for an hour and eat sweets instead of going to bed. This was when Harry discovered that Malfoy could be quite funny under the right circumstances - and that he could be persuaded to do almost anything if cake was involved.<br/> <br/>This became their new routine. They would part ways just outside Professor Flitwick's office and pretend to go to their own dormitories, only to meet up at a predetermined location 15 minutes later where they could complain and worry and eat chocolate frogs or whatever sweets they had got their hands on that day.<br/> <br/>They did have to be careful about being seen together. Malfoy didn’t want it to get back to his father that he had abandoned his mission, so he continued to socialize with the same people and disappear at the same times of day. Harry was annoyed with him for being able to play his part so perfectly, but occasionally he would catch the other boy's eye across a crowded room and see the fear again.</p><p>The prefects' bathroom was still a decent spot to meet secretly in late at night, as was the alcove on the third floor.  Stairs and walkways had been sort of… rerouted… away from the alcove after somebody transfigured the knights' gauntlets into an astonishing variety of rude gestures - some of which Harry had never seen or heard about before.  It was quite educational, in a way.  The armor started to shriek when anyone touched the knights or tried to transfigure them back, so McGonnogall had written it off as a project for the summer holiday.<br/> <br/>Harry had never expected the two of them to get along.  At first they just complained about the teachers and insulted one another conversationally - nothing too personal, except that sometimes the conversation shifted and then all of a sudden it became <em>horribly personal </em>and there was nothing Harry could do to steer them back to safe waters. They would fight. And it was fine, because this was about right and wrong, about saving someone's mother from the clutches of a vicious murderer, and it shouldn't matter if that someone was an arsehole, which Malfoy absolutely was.</p><p>“When I was five,” said Malfoy one night when they were looking up at the stars through a high window above the third floor alcove, “I used to have these elaborate tea parties in my room.” Harry tried to imagine it, smiling at the thought of that tiny blonde terror fiddling with lace doilies and spoons and tablecloths. “I would make up invitations with my colored pencils and insist that the house elves deliver them for me - they would go all around the house, handing them out to people and toys and imaginary dragons. But in the end it would usually be just Mother and me and a couple of stuffed giraffes, and she would always dress up for it like it was a real outing. She would wear her best hat and gloves, and talk to me like a grown-up, and she would let me eat all the biscuits by myself.”</p><p>Malfoy's love for his mother tugged at something in Harry - something warm and private, tangled up with a longing for a home and a family he would never get enjoy. It made Malfoy seem practically human. It had taken them almost six years of school to move from being enemies to barely-tolerated acquaintances, and now, without meaning to, they were sliding into something worryingly like friendship.</p><p>"I am imagining you in little pyjamas with the feet on," Harry admitted, and Malfoy laughed. It was a good sound. Harry thought he'd like to hear it again.</p><p><br/>"I suppose they might have simply taken her wand," he said, returning to an earlier part of the conversation. Malfoy hadn't seen his mother in two months. She continued to write him letters, but the contents had become uncharacteristically cold and nondescript.  The handwriting was clearly hers, the tone was nearly right, but something important was missing from them - some vital spark.  “How do you know for sure if someone is under the Imperius curse?”</p><p>Harry thought about this. “We should ask Hermione,” he said, feeling suddenly guilty. He hadn’t told his friends anything about what he and Malfoy were doing. <em>He</em> didn’t really know what they were doing, only that it felt new and tentative, and oddly private, and every time he imagined saying anything to Ron it ended with the whole thing being smashed to pieces in a grand and horrible row. Were He and Malfoy friends, too, now? It might not even be safe for Malfoy at the school once his mother escaped and the Death Eaters realized their youngest member had betrayed them. He didn’t know what was going on, but he promised himself that when he figured it out, his friends would be the first to know.</p><p>“Maybe,” said Malfoy, but he sounded pained at the suggestion and the subject was therefore dropped. He was always got a bit funny when Harry mentioned his friends.</p><p>“It's possible that they’re just keeping her in line with threats, but Imperius makes the most sense. Everything I've seen and heard so far seems to support that line of thinking. They said she hadn’t been doing her hair or her makeup, and staying in her room even for meals. She hasn't been seen in public in weeks."<br/> <br/>Malfoy's father wouldn't speak to him about her any longer, and the servants were all too terrified to tell him anything. Malfoy had finally resorted to interrogating one of the house elfs, a scrawny little creature called Widdles, who visited the school once a week to pick up Malfoy's shirts to be ironed (because the Hogwarts elves could hardly be trusted with silk, he told Harry, who scoffed at him and tried to look disgusted). When Malfoy demanded answers to his questions, Widdles hemmed and hawed and almost swallowed his own fist trying to keep the words from spilling out of his mouth, but after Malfoy threatened him with mittens the fragile old thing gave in, terrified, and told him everything.<br/> <br/>Apparently his mother had tried to leave the country, disguised as a Muggle. It had happened during a visit to Highbridge on the pretense that she had a rich, ailing cousin she needed to visit and wheedle money out of (<em>all for the cause</em>, she'd told her husband), but she had failed to return at the appointed time. Now she was being kept in her room under heavy wards, and threats of violence were being thrown around like friendly banter. One of Fenrir Grayback's nameless followers had said in very unambiguous terms that her fate was tied to whether her son, Malfoy, came through on his mission - which involved smuggling a group of Death Eaters into Hogwarts using a vanishing cabinet.<br/> <br/>"They won't let me see her," Malfoy said, knees tucked up under his chin, fingers drawing watery shapes across the eggshell blue tiles that made up the floor of the prefects' bathroom. The hair at the nape of his neck had started to curl from the heat and humidity of the room, and he had undone the top three buttons of his expensive-looking white shirt. Probably this was also because of the heat, which was really sort of lovely even though it made both of them a bit drowsy. Harry found that he liked Malfoy better with his tie undone and his hair a bit messy. It was easier to talk to him - or slightly harder, depending on how you looked at it. Harry found himself watching the other boy sometimes when they were like this. - the way he moved his hands and the subtle difference between the smile that meant <em>you yourself are a moron </em>and the one that meant Harry had said something brilliant, usually by accident.</p><p>“At first they tried to be subtle about it,” Malfoy explained, flexing long fingers behind his head and stretching his arms so that his perfect button-down shirt, which had come untucked over the course of the evening, rode up just a bit and exposed a narrow strip of skin just over his stomach. Harry made an effort not to stare. “They tried to placate me with flattery or with excuses about why she couldn't be disturbed just then, but two weeks ago when I showed up demanding to see her, one of them gave me this," he said, lifting his shirt up all the way and rolling onto his side to show off a patchwork of angry red slash marks that covered most of his back and right hip. The injuries looked like they were almost healed, but even so -<br/> <br/>"Merlin, Malfoy. Don't you know any healing spells? You ought to have Pomfrey take a look at that.”<br/> <br/>"Of course I do, unlike <em>you </em>I am an extremely capable wizard - but it's fine. I'm just sort of... letting it heal on its own. I have potions in my room to numb the pain. I think I'm worried that I might forget, or lose my nerve, or something along those lines. It would be easier for me to pretend that everything is fine. But I can’t just leave her there." His expression slackened for just a moment, making him look more helpless and unsure of himself than Harry had ever seen him.  And then he abruptly came to his senses, schooling his features into something cool and unbothered, and yanked his shirt back into place. They didn't talk about it again.</p>
