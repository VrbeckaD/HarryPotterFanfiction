fumes clung in the air like fog, a fog that was tinted blue and
smelled like liquorice. Students coughed as they ducked out from
under the tables and benches they had dived under at the first
warning shout before the cauldron exploded.</p><p>	“Harry!
Harry are you okay?” Hermione called, stumbling to her feet and
heading towards the centre of the room.</p><p>	“Draco!
That nincompoop better not have killed you!” Pansy said, using
her wand to blow the fog away.</p><p>	A
head of dark hair groaned-</p><p>	“Harry?”</p><p>	-and
sat up, skin pale-</p><p>	Pansy
asked, “Draco is that-”</p><p>	The
lone figure pushed himself up, black hair but not as unruly as usual,
a lock of blond in the center of his forehead, pale delicate skin
with expressive green eyes. He still had the lightning bolt scar and
a mix of Draco and Harry’s bone structure.</p><p>	Slughorn
was the first to break the silence, “Well. This is unusual.”</p><p>	“I
would have to agree,” Harry-Draco said looking down at himself,
his voice sounded quite like Harry’s but infuriatingly posh. He
was grinning.</p><p>	“Anyone
involved with their potion stay,” Slughorn said, “The
rest of you can leave early. Go see Madam Pomfrey if you have any
unusualness pop up.”</p><p>	The
rest of the class filled out, already a mess of hushed whispers.</p><p>	“So
are you Harry? Or are you Malfoy? ….Or both? Are you sharing?”
Hermione asked.</p><p>	Harry-Draco
looked up from examining his hands, “I am Harry. And I’m
Draco. Yes,” and he grinned again.</p><p>	“What?”
Hermione frowned.</p><p>	“Are
you alright?” Pansy asked with concern, “Of course you
aren’t. You’ve been merged with a useless moron.”</p><p>	“Useless?
No. I was distracted by… by myself,” Harry-Draco said,
“I was thinking about how- huh...” he blinked rapidly in
thought.</p><p>	“You
feel alright though?” Ron asked.</p><p>	Harry-Draco
nodded.</p><p>	“And
not like you’re going to throw up?” Ron said, looking
rather green himself.</p><p>	Harry-Draco
raised an eyebrow, “No? I feel… good...” he
grinned, “no great…amazing really. I’m clever and
smart, brilliant on a broomstick, look fantastic, I feel like I can
do anything.”</p><p>	There
was a laugh behind them where Blaise had lingered by the door, “The
two of them together make one functional human being.”</p><p>	“Hey!”
Ron protested.</p><p>	“Don’t
kid yourself, Weasley,” Blaise said, “Both of them are
utter disasters. Maybe we ought to leave them like that.”</p><p>	“No!
Absolutely not!” Hermione said automatically.</p><p>	“What
if they’re happier?” Pansy said quietly.</p><p>	The
room went quiet, Hermione looking at Ron with a frown who shrugged
back. 
</p><p>	“Does
that mean we have to share custody?” Blaise joked.</p><p>	All
three turned a glare on Blaise.</p><p> 	Harry-Draco
laughed, “Share custody? Why in the world would you do that?
We’re all friends.” he got excited again, “I have
so many friends. Bloody brilliant.”</p><p>	“There
shouldn’t be any problems,” Slughorn said, pulling all
their attention to the Professor, reading a massive potions book laid
out on the desk in front of himself, “The original potion is
meant to wear off in twenty-four hours, I don’t see why this
particular effect won’t as well.”</p><p>	“They’ve
been combined into a single person!” Hermione shouted.</p><p>	Slughorn
looked up from his book, “Well yes. I do plan to test whatever
traces of potion remain from their cauldron to be safe, but the
potion we were brewing was one of the safer ones when it comes to
misbrewing. It will be fine, and if it isn’t, we can deal with
the issue as it arises. I’ll tell the Headmistress, you can go
about your day.”</p><p>	Hermione
grabbed her bag and Harry’s, “Come on.”</p><p>	Ron
followed after her, Harry-Draco following a few steps behind and
Pansy and Blaise falling even further to the back.</p><p>	“We’re
going to see Pomfrey,” Hermione said as soon as they were far
enough away.</p><p>	Pansy
rolled her eyes, “To what? Waste our time?”</p><p>	“I
think we need a professional opinion,” Hermione said, “In
fact, we should go to McGonagall ourselves, maybe go to St Mungo’s.”</p><p>	“Nah.”</p><p>	Hermione
spun around.</p><p>	Harry-Draco
put Draco’s bag on his shoulder, “I want to go to lunch
and- oh! I want to go flying! If I eat fast enough I could go out, do
a few laps around the pitch!”</p><p>	“You’re
not flying!” Hermione said.</p><p>	Harry-Draco
took Harry’s bag from her and shrunk it down small enough to
put in his other bag, “It’s going to be brilliant,”
he said with a grin, hurrying down the hallway.</p><p>	“Harry!
Malfoy!” Hermione shouted as she ran after them, Ron and Pansy
right on her heel. Blaise followed leisurely behind, looking quite
amused. 
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>	“I
hate this,” Hermione groaned, her arms squeezing tightly around
her waist.</p><p>	Both
her and Ron craned their heads back to watch their friend, half their
friend, fly between the goal hoops as fast as his broom would go.</p><p>	“What
if the potion wears off while he’s up there?” Hermione
fretted.</p><p>	“Slughorn
said-”</p><p>	“But
he could be wrong! It’s an incomplete interaction from an
accidental potion explosion! It could fail at any moment.”</p><p>	“It
could, I suppose” Ron said.</p><p>	“And
then they might fall-”</p><p>	“So
we’ll catch them,” Ron said, looking down at Hermione and
holding up his wand.</p><p>	Hermione’s
brow furrowed but she drew her wand as well, “….I hate
this so much.”</p><p>	Ron
put his arm around Hermione’s shoulder, “Pretty amazing
though. He’s got Harry’s skill and Malfoy’s
precision. He’s the best flier I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>	“You
would say that,” Hermione said.</p><p>	Ron
shrugged and cast a fresh warming charm over the two of them.</p><p>	Hermione
sighed and leaned against his side.</p><p>	Ten
minutes later Harry-Draco landed, cheeks red from the cold, hopping
off his broom with an exuberant laugh and running over to them. “I
told you it would be brilliant!”</p><p>	“I’m
just glad its over with,” Hermione said.</p><p>	“I
am definitely coming back after dinner,” Harry-Draco nudged
Ron, “You’ll come too, yeah? Maybe we can pull together a
quick game between both my houses.”</p><p>	“I
mean that’d be great but Gryffindor and Slytherin?” Ron
said shaking his head, “I mean I’ve got no problem but
they probably won’t-”</p><p>	“Fantastic,
I’ll sort out the Slytherins you’re in charge of
Gryffindor!” Harry-Draco said,  running over to the broomshed
to put his broom away.</p><p>	Ron
opened and closed his mouth. “That… wasn’t what I
was- whatever, sure.”</p><p>	“Ron!
Were you listening to me at all?!” Hermione said.</p><p>	Ron
shrugged, “Unless you’re gonna tie him up I don’t
think you can stop him. I mean Harry was hard enough to stop just on
his own and Malfoy’s just as stubborn.”</p><p>	Hermione
tugged on her hair unhappily.</p><p>	“Look
on the bright side, there will be even more people to keep an eye on
him, y’know, in case he becomes them again,” Ron said.</p><p>	“Hey,
we’re going to be late for class if we don’t get moving,”
Harry-Draco called to them, already starting up the hill.</p><p>	“O-Oh!”
Hermione jumped and started walking back towards the castle as fast
as she could without actually running.</p><p>	“We’ve
got a free period right now, mate,” Ron said, his long legs
letting him keep up with his shorter girlfriend without any apparent
effort.</p><p>	Harry-Draco
shook his head, “No. I have arithmancy.”</p><p>	“Half
of you does,” Ron said, “Could always skip out.”</p><p>	Harry-Draco
frowned at him, “Half of me? I’m one person, not a
dissection.”</p><p>	“But
you were-” Ron tried.</p><p>	“Besides.
I want to go,” Harry-Draco interrupted.</p><p>	“Why?”
Ron asked.</p><p>	Harry-Draco
was quiet for second, looking slightly confused, “Because….
Because I can do it and… I couldn’t before...” he
blinked thoughtfully, “Something like that anyway.”</p><p>	Ron
shrugged, “Alright you have fun then I guess.”</p><p>	Harry-Draco
clapped Ron’s shoulder and joined Hermione going up the stairs
to their next class.</p><p>	Once
they were out of sight, Ron let out a huge yawn, muttering to
himself, “Personally, I’m gonna take a nap.”</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>	They
managed to get enough people together to play without beaters and
bludgers. No one wanted to play seeker against Harry-Draco, so they
played until he caught the snitch and the team with the most points
won. It was a close game, Slytherin won by a single goal.</p><p>	“Holy
shite, Parkinson! Why didn’t you ever play quidditch for
Slytherin? I don’t think I’ve ever seen flying like that
before.” Ron asked as they all landed and tossed their brooms
in the shed.</p><p>	Pansy
cast a cleaning spell over herself, “It’s a called a
jackal feint and to your question I have terrible aim and can’t
throw very far and I just don’t think I’d look very good
with the sort of muscles you need for a strong arm. I have a very
slight frame. Some girls though...”  She turned and looked at
Ginny appreciatively, “it suits them very well indeed.”</p><p>	Ginny
smiled hesitantly, a pink flush rising to her cheeks.</p><p>	Ron’s
expression froze, a silent horror in his eyes. Hermione grabbed his
arm, “It’ll be fine. Let’s go to dinner.”</p><p>	Ron
let Hermione pull him up to the castle with the rest of the group,
mumbling numbly, “I just- I mean she can like whoever but-”</p><p>	“It
will be fine,” Hermione said soothingly, “Ginny can take
care of herself.”</p><p>	“Very
bold, Pansy,” Blaise said not very under his breath.</p><p>	Pansy
flipped her hair, “It was just the truth.”</p><p>	Blaise
smirked faintly.</p><p>	They
split their separate ways to either end of the great hall and their
respective tables.</p><p>	“Harry-”</p><p>	“Draco-”</p><p>	The
two groups stopped, turned back and glared at one another.</p><p>	“Harry’s
going to sit with us,” Ron said.</p><p>	Blaise
raised an eyebrow, “<i>Draco</i> sat with you already, at
lunch. If you remember.”</p><p>	“He
should sit where he wants to sit,” Hermione said. 
</p><p>	“Precisely,”
Blaise said.</p><p>	Hermione
went on doggedly, “Which is, of course, with-”</p><p>	“Us,”
Pansy said icily.</p><p>	Ginny
rolled her eyes, “Why don’t we just sit together?”
She glanced at Pansy from the corner of her eye, “I wouldn’t
mind it.”</p><p>	Pansy
said, “I’d like that-”</p><p>	“Absolutely
NOT,” Ron said so loud the entire room went quiet and stared at
him.</p><p>	There
was a thump from the head table as McGonagall put down her cup and
narrowed her eyes in warning.</p><p>	“Sorry,
Headmistress,” Ron muttered.<br/>
“Where is Harry?”
Hermione asked as the other students quietly began talking again.</p><p>	They
all turned. Where Harry-Draco had been before there was an empty
space. They all began looking around, first at their own tables which
were quite Harry-Draco-less and then to the rest of the tables, where
Harry-Draco was heading towards Luna at the back end of Ravenclaw
table.</p><p>	Ginny
punched Ron in the arm and hurried after Harry-Draco, Pansy following
a few steps behind.</p><p>	Ron
rubbed his arm, sinking into his hunched shoulders.</p><p>	“You
deserved that,” Hermione said.</p><p>	“I
know,” Ron said as they followed the rest of the group, sitting
in the empty section at the end of the table with Luna.</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>	“So
you were two people, but now you’re one person with two sets of
memories?” Luna said wide-eyed, “Is it terribly
confusing?”</p><p>	“Sometimes,”
Harry-Draco said with a shrug, “My mind wants to pick one, it’s
hard to consider something as happening twice to two people but also
to just the one I am now. It’s not too bad though.”</p><p>	“I
imagine it’s so very interesting,” Luna mused as she
built a moat of mashed potato for a gravy lake, “Because the
two of you were always fighting and arguing, and now you know exactly
what the other was thinking and feeling.”</p><p>	Harry-Draco
nodded, “I understand myself now. I feel... better.”</p><p>	“That’s
wonderful,” Luna said with a smile. 
</p><p>	Ron
sat across from Ginny who was sitting next to Pansy and resolutely
ignoring him.</p><p>	“Tell
me more about the jackal feint,” Ginny said, “I feel like
I read about it somewhere but I can’t remember.”</p><p>	“My
uncle played for the Ballycastle Bats when he was young, he was
famous for the feint,” Pansy said.</p><p>	“He
must have been good,” Ginny said.</p><p>	“Good
enough. The feint is hard to learn but easy to intercept once you
know how to spot it. No one uses it anymore,” Pansy said. She
chewed on her bottom lip, “He was also famous for cheating. He
only played for the team for two years.”</p><p>	Ginny
propped her chin on her hand, leaning closer to Pansy, “He
taught you how to do it though? The feint? Did you-?”</p><p>	“Want
to play quidditch?” Pansy shook her head, “Not really. He
taught my sister and me how to fly when we were little. It was…
more or less the only way he could talk with us, barely said a word
said otherwise, but he could talk about flying forever.”</p><p>	Ginny
smiled faintly, “Would you teach me?”</p><p>	Pansy
absently smoothed her hair, “I could certainly try, I don’t
know how good of a teacher I’ll be.”</p><p>	“It’ll
be fun to try either way,” Ginny said.</p><p>	
Pansy bit her lip and nodded.</p><p>	“What’s
wrong, Harry and Draco?” Luna asked.</p><p>	Harry-Draco
frowned at the spread of food, “I have two different favourites
and twice as many foods I hate…”</p><p>	“Or
maybe you don’t hate them anymore since half of you doesn’t
hate them,” Luna said. She sat up and clapped her hands, “Oh!
You should try everything and see! It might be like trying everything
for the very first time ever. What a wonderful possibility. You have
to!”</p><p>	Harry-Draco
put a small bite of everything onto his plate and then tasted each
thing.</p><p>	Pansy
laughed when Harry-Draco made a disgusted face, “Still hate
bell pepper then?”</p><p>	“Ugh,
yes,” Harry-Draco said, picking up his cup to wash the taste
from his mouth.</p><p>	Blaise
rested his elbows on the table and leaned forward with a shit-eating
grin, “So where are you going to sleep?” he asked
Harry-Draco.</p><p>	Harry-Draco’s
brow furrowed.</p><p>	Ron
started, “Well-” 
</p><p>	“No.”
Hermione held up hands, “We’ve been here before. It’s
up to them,” she nodded to Harry-Draco.</p><p>	Harry-Draco
looked from Ron and Hermione to Blaise and Pansy, all his friends
waiting for his answer. He rolled his eyes and turned to Luna, “Can
I stay with you tonight?”</p><p>	“Okay,”
Luna said.</p><p>	“What?”
Hermione said.</p><p>	Blaise
sighed and sat back, “No fun.”</p><p>	Pansy
snorted and elbowed him in the ribs.</p><p>	“You’re
going to stay in the Ravenclaw girls dorm?” Ron asked.</p><p>	“I
can sleep on the couch,” Harry-Draco said.</p><p>	“Oh
no, you don’t have to sleep there,” Luna said cheerfully,
“I can enlarge my bed.”</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>	“How’d
the sleepover go?” Hermione asked as Harry-Draco joined them
the next morning.</p><p>	“Wonderful!”
Luna said squeezing between Ron and Hermione and linking arms with
both of them, “Harry and Draco are very cuddly. Once they were
finished working of course.”</p><p>	Harry-Draco
yawned, “I ended up staying up too late finishing my charms
essay.”</p><p>	“But
we finished that days ago in the library. I remember, I was there and
everything,” Ron said.</p><p>	“I
had some new ideas on it,” Harry-Draco said. “Lots of
ideas. I ended up writing an extra two feet. Hopefully, Flitwick
doesn’t mind.”</p><p>	“Um...”
Hermione hesitated, “I think the Professor probably expects two
papers, one from each of you.”</p><p>	Harry-Draco
shook his head in frustration, “What? What would be the point?
And my paper is better now. It’s better than the two separate
papers ever were.”</p><p>	“The
point is, that’s not how papers are done,” Hermione said.</p><p>	“I
don’t know what you expect me to do about it,”
Harry-Draco said with a shrug and went into the classroom.</p><p>	“Turn
in two papers!” Hermione called, hurrying after them.</p><p>	“Too
late! I already destroyed the separate ones!” Harry-Draco said.</p><p>	“Good
one, mate,” Ron said as he sat next to Harry-Draco.</p><p>	Hermione
threw herself down next to Ron and proceeded to fume for the rest of
the lesson. She was the first to rush up to Flitwick’s desk
when class was let out and stood nearby with a stubborn lift to her
chin as Harry-Draco put their essay on the pile and made to leave.</p><p>	Flitwick
stopped them, “Wait, Mr- gentlemen, I’ve heard of your
accident but surely you had separate essays before yesterday. Mr
Malfoy certainly had his assignment done well in advance.”</p><p>	“I
thought of a better way to go about it,” Harry-Draco said, “and
I added on a lot. It’s-”</p><p>	“You
are two people who receive two different grades, before and after
this potion wears off, so I expect two separate papers,”
Flitwick said. He tapped their rolled up parchment, “Not this.”</p><p>	Hermione
grinned smugly.</p><p>	Harry-Draco
took out his wand, doubling his assignment with a charm, “There.
Everyone’s happy,” he said, turning on his heel and
leaving, ignoring for Flitwick and Hermione’s complaints behind
him.</p><p>	He
hadn’t made it more than three steps out into the hall when
Slughorn waved him down, “There you are, lads! I thought I
ought to see you to the hospital wing for when the potion wears off.”</p><p>	“Why?”
Harry-Draco asked suspiciously, “I thought you said it was
safe.”</p><p>	“Safe,
yes!” Slughorn said jovially, “but there might be some…
complications.”</p><p>	“Complications,”
Harry-Draco said flatly.</p><p>	Slughorn
nodded, “Yes, well it won’t cause harm, which is
precisely what I meant by safe.”</p><p>	Harry-Draco
let himself be guided to the hospital wing and sat on one of the beds
as Slughorn spoke with Pomfrey. He was still sitting there when the
potion wore off, and he separated into two people once more, like a
book falling opening, one to either end of the bed. 
</p><p>	Both
were unconscious and remained so for eight days, four hours and
eleven minutes.</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>	Harry
blinked awake, his body sore and aching dreadfully as he pushed
himself up onto his elbows.</p><p>	“Harry!”
Ron said, jumping up from his chair and hugging Harry round the
shoulders. “Hermione! Harry’s awake!”</p><p>	Hermione
ran over from the window, hugging Harry’s other side, “Thank
goodness! I was getting so worried!”</p><p>	“Worried?”
Harry asked hoarsely, putting on his glasses as they were handed to
him.</p><p>	“Mate,
you were out of it for over a week,” Ron said.</p><p>	Harry
held out a hand, “Water?”</p><p>	Hermione
passed him a glass, “It’s quite fascinating-”</p><p>	“You
were worried sick just a few moments ago, Hermione,” Ron
pointed out.</p><p>	“Yes
but now that I know it’s okay I have a lot of questions-”
Hermione said.</p><p>	“Mione,
he just woke up,” Ron said.</p><p>	Hermione
rolled her eyes, “Fine. Later then.”</p><p>	Harry
finished the glass of water and set the glass on the side table, his
movements stiff and slow. He rubbed his forehead and pushed his hands
through his hair.</p><p>	“The
thing that worried us was ferret face woke up hours ago,” Ron
said.</p><p>	Harry
sat up straighter, “Draco? Where is he?”</p><p>	Ron
shrugged, “Back to his dorm I guess.”</p><p>	Hermione
shook her head.</p><p>	Harry
shoved his blankets back and swung his legs over the side of the bed.</p><p>	“Woah!
Where you going-”</p><p>	“To
Draco,” Harry said shortly.</p><p>	Hermione
grabbed hold of his sleeve and Ron wrapped an arm around Harry’s
chest, holding him back.</p><p>	“Hold
on, you’ve just-” Ron said.</p><p>	“Let.
me. go.” Harry said between clenched teeth, grabbing Ron’s
arm and trying to pry it off.</p><p>	Hermione
called over her shoulder, “Madam Pomfrey! Harry’s awake!”</p><p>	Harry
shot her a furious glare, trying to shove Ron’s arm out of the
way.</p><p>	“What’s
this?” Pomfrey said as she bustled out of her office.</p><p>	“I
need to go. I need to go now,” Harry told her urgently.</p><p>	Ron
and Hermione exchanged worried looks.</p><p>	“Not
until I check you over you’re not,” Pomfrey said. She
took out her wand and cast a few diagnostic spells around him before
nodding, “Same as Mr Malfoy. I’ll get you a revitalising
potion.”</p><p>	She
went back to her potion stores.</p><p>	“Let
me go,” Harry said.</p><p>	“You
going to bolt?” Ron asked.</p><p>	“I
won’t.”</p><p>	Ron
and Hermione slowly loosen their grip but stayed within grabbing
distance.</p><p>	Pomfrey
returned, pulling the cork from a vial of blue liquid.</p><p>	Harry
grabbed it from her and drank it down before she could say anything.
“I’d like to go now,” Harry said giving her the
empty vial.</p><p> 	“You
need rest. No straining yourself. No galavanting. If Mr Weasley and
Miss Granger will see you to your dorm, you can go,” Pomfrey
said.</p><p>	“Of
course,” Hermione said.</p><p>	Ron
nodded.</p><p>	“Very
well,” Pomfrey conjured a changing screen, and Harry was
quickly back in his uniform. Ron put an arm around Harry’s
shoulder, guiding him out of the hospital wing, Hermione holding onto
his arm.</p><p>	They
were halfway down the stairs when Harry duck out of both their grasp.</p><p>	Hermione
stumbled and was caught by Ron, she called after, “Harry! Come
back, you’re supposed to rest!” 
</p><p>	“Don’t
make me run and I won’t,” Harry said, heading down the
corridor leading to the dungeons with his friends right behind him.</p><p>	“He
won’t be able to get in,” Ron reassured Hermione.</p><p>	“I’m
not sure-,” Hermione said.</p><p>	They
came to the Slytherin archway.</p><p>	“Fluxweed!”
Harry shouted, and the secret passage slid open. Harry disappearing
inside.</p><p>	“How-?”
Ron said speeding up before it closed.</p><p>	Hermione
had to run to keep up, panting excitedly, “They shared a mind!
I think that’s why they were asleep so long! We record our
memories when we sleep!”	</p><p>	“Fascinating,
Mione but we gotta move!” Ron grabbed her hand and sped up,
towing her behind him. He ducked his head as they rushed through the
common room which did nothing to obscure his mop of red hair drawing
whispers and stares in his wake.</p><p>	Harry
went down one of the narrow side passages passing by door after door,
before going into the fifth though it looked no different than the
rest. He stopped a few steps inside, Ron and Hermione pilling up
behind him. 
</p><p>	Draco
shot to his feet, “Harry-”</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>	-
Just a bit earlier -</p><p>	“How
long is he going to sleep, do you think?”</p><p>	There
was a long sigh, “You’d think after a week, he’d
done with sleeping for a while.”</p><p>	“I
can hear you, you know,” Draco muttered.</p><p>	Blaise
said, “We weren’t really going for subtle.”</p><p>	“We
want to know what happened,” Pansy said.</p><p>	“You
were there for most of it,” Draco said rolling over and
carefully pushing himself up to sit on the edge of his bed.</p><p>	“Yes,
but what was it <i>like</i>?” Pansy pressed.</p><p>	Blaise
and Pansy were sitting on Blaise’s bed opposite looking at him
expectantly.</p><p>	Draco
looked down at his hands with a frown, “It was… I felt…”
he sighed, “It’s hard to explain.”</p><p>	Blaise
rolled his eyes. “Nothing is ever easy with you.”</p><p>	Pansy
elbowed him in the ribs.</p><p>	Blaise
bumped his shoulder back against her in retaliation, “Fine,
fine. Easy start then, were you two minds, like could you hear Potter
or was it... weirder?”</p><p>	“It
wasn’t weird,” Draco said.</p><p>	“One
shared mind then.”</p><p>	Draco
grabbed his pillow and threw it at Blaise though he couldn’t
put much strength behind it.</p><p>	“But
then… it was nice?” Pansy suggested.</p><p>	“It
was… right,” Draco said, “I was incomplete, but I
didn’t know it, and then I was more whole than I’ve ever
been before. There was good, and there was-” his words hitched,
“-there was a lot of pain, but it was better as me, as <i>we</i>.
Together everything was half as scary and twice as easy, even
breathing. I felt so much lighter.”</p><p>	“Sounds
like a hell of a drug,” Blaise said, impressed.</p><p>	Pansy
leaned forward, “So, um, you don’t hate him anymore?”</p><p>	“I
miss him.”</p><p>	Blaise
and Pansy looked at each other in surprise.</p><p>	The
door opened and Draco was on his feet before anyone could react,
“Harry-”</p><p>	“Dra-”
Harry’s words were cut short as Draco grabbed him by the front
of his shirt and pulled him into his arms.</p><p>	“Woah!
Wait. Wha- what’s going on?” Ron asked, holding tightly
onto Hermione.</p><p>	Blaise
leaned back on the bed, “He missed him.”</p><p>	“Him
who?” Ron asked.</p><p>	Blaise
shrugged, “Does it matter?”</p><p>	“I
came as soon as I could,” Harry said, holding onto Draco so
tightly it was a wonder either of them could breathe.</p><p>	Draco
shook his head, “I shouldn’t have left, I was so out of
it, I just-”</p><p>	“You’re
here now. We’re here now,” Harry said, he shifted and
pressed his forehead against Draco’s.</p><p>	“But
we’re not we,” Draco said faintly, “I- One day
wasn’t enough. I want more.”</p><p>	“You
could always do it the normal way,” Pansy said, “You
know, by talking.”</p><p>	“That
will take forever!” Draco protested.</p><p>	Hermione
smiled tentatively, “I think that’s kind of the whole
point though. And it’s nice.” She looked up to Ron.</p><p>	Ron
opened his mouth, closed his mouth, swallowed his initial reaction,
and nodded slowly. “N i  c e,” he repeated weakly.</p><p>	Hermione
smiled and squeezed his hand.</p><p>	“Do
you want to?” Draco asked.</p><p>	Harry
brushed his hand across Draco’s cheek, “Yeah. More than
anything.”</p><p>	Draco
wavered, and slowly leaned forward until his lips met Harry’s. 
</p><p>	Harry
sighed into the kiss, leaning in as if they could somehow find a way
to be closer than they already were. 
</p><p>	There
was a flumph as their robes fell onto the ground, ties quickly
followed. Fingers sought skin, undoing buttons, slipping under shirts
with growing urgency and a fading awareness of anything other than
each other. 
</p><p>	“I’ll
just- We’ll just-” Hermione stammered, darting out the
door and pulling Ron with her.</p><p>	Pansy
made a face, “They’ve forgotten we’re here, haven't
they?” 
</p><p>	“Yep,”
Blaise said.</p><p>	Pansy
stood up, “Let’s get out of here before we see something
we regret.”</p><p>	“You
might regret it-”</p><p>	Pansy
grabbed Blaise’s arm and jerked him to his feet, “Draco
<i>will</i> murder you.”</p><p>	“I
suppose,” Blaise sighed and allowed Pansy to guide him out of
the room.</p><p>	They
locked the door behind them.</p></div>
