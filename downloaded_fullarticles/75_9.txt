    <p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Come on Elphaba, make a wish..." Fiyero said, when they sat infront of a big cake with 21 candles on it.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Fiyero, that's ridiculous. I can't make a wish like this."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Oh come on. Give it a try."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She rolled her eyes, and blew out the candles.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It was stupid, and she knew it wouldn't work like that, but she did make a wish.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>"I wish, I would be normal..."</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,See, it wasn't that bad." Fiyero said, and she looked at him.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,It was not because of that... anyway, I didn't know, that you can make a cake."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Oh I can't. I paid someone to make it, and I paid someone to deliver it..." he said, and she nodded, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>raised her eyebrows.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,I'm glad that you came on my birthday..." she said after a few minutes, and he nodded: ,,Of course. You are my girlfriend. But, you know... I have to go now."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Will you come back?"</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Of course. In a few months it is my birthday, and I will send someone to pick you up, because I want to celebrate in my castle."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She looked at him, and asked: ,,Will you ever come to me without anyone's birthday?!"</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Elphaba... look... I need a few days to get here."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Not if you would use a broom... or a bubble like Glinda..." she muttered more to herself, and he just took a piece of cake, and left the room.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She didn't looked out of the window, but she threw the cake out of the window...</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Did you know, that there's something on your front garden, that looks like... I don't actually know what it looks like." Glinda said, gliding through the window, and Elphaba looked at her.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,And did you know, that I have a front door?!"</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Yes, but you know, some people come and go by bubbles."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Elphaba smirked, and Glinda approached her best friend, and pulled her in an embrace.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,It was a cake... Fiyero's cake."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Glinda looked at her in total disbelieve: ,,He know how to make a cake?!"</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Of course not. He let it make, and he let it deliver."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,That sounds more like him..." </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Elphaba nodded, and smiled, but Glinda knew her better. She took a green hand in her own, and squeezed it.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,He hurt you..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,And you wanted him in the first place..." Elphaba said, and Glinda agreed: ,,Yes... but I didn't know that he's just a dumbass. Perhaps I didn't wanted to see..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,He wanted me to make a wish..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Did you?"</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Yes..." Elphaba sighed, and Glinda looked her directly in the eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,What was your wish...?"</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,You know what it was, and what it always will be..." Elphaba said, and walked to the next window.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,I want to go into a city without people screaming because of me... without anyone is pointing their stupid fingers at me... and that excuse of "the wizard" ... we all know, that he is nothing. No wizard, not my father, and no help..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Glinda stepped closer, and took Elphaba's hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,I will help you..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Elphaba turned her face, and looked in Ginda's deep blue eyes: ,,Sure? I don't know where to start..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,You are my best friend, and I will help you... no matter what it will cost..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,I've read about someone..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Of course you did, you are a bookworm..." Glinda muttered, but Elphaba had heard it, and smirked, while she led Glinda into a small library.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She searched for a book, and gave it to Glinda.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Page 26."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Glinda opened the said page, and looked at Elphaba after a few seconds.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,You want to go to England?!"</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Yes. And I will find Narcissa Malfoy to ask her for help."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Glinda thought about it, and read about the witch, and finally said: ,,You should start with a letter..."</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Elphaba sat down at a table, and after a while, she started writing: </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <em> </em>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>,,Dear Mrs Malfoy,</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em> </em>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>I've read about you in a book, and I write you this, because of a very strange request.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>I've read that you have a master's degree in potions, and... yes, over the years, it's nothing new for me, that people avoid me, and perhaps you would also avoid me, if you would see me, but... my question is, whether it is possible to change someone's skin.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em> </em>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>I really hope, that you can help me, with my... problem.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em> </em>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>with kind regards</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em> </em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em> </em>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Elphaba Thropp..."</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Glinda remained at the castle the next few days, and finally... after two weeks Elphaba got an answer.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Glinda!" Elphaba yelled, and stormed into the room she had gave to Glinda.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,She wants to see me..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,What?!" Glinda asked, pulled the letter out of Elphaba's hand, amd read it:</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <em> </em>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>,,Dear Ms Thropp,</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em> </em>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>I've read your letter, and I would like to know more about your little problem.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>I don't want to talk about that in letters, and that's why I would like to invite you to my house.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>You can stay here as long as you want.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em> </em>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>with kind regards</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em> </em>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Narcissa Black</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em> </em>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Black Manor</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>England."</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Glinda looked at Elphaba, and asked her, if she know how they could get there.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Of course..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Just asking... because... You know about the blood forest?"</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,The what?!"</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,The blood forest. Who's the bookworm now?!" Glinda teased her a bit, and rolled up a map on the table.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She pointed at a spot with her finger.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,This is your castle... over there is England. But here... is the blood forest. If we would take this way..." she made a curve around the forest on the map: ,,We would need two weeks."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,We both are able to fly, Glinda."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Yes, but you can't just fly over the forest. There lives a witch in this forest, and she kills everyone, who fly over her forest."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Alright... now we get somewhere..." Elphaba agreed, and studied the map by herself...</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,We go through this damn forest." she finally said, after she was walking up and down. Thinking. Glinda looked at her in shock.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,What?! Elphie!"</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Glinda! There is a witch in England who can possible help me, do you think that a stupid forest will stop me?! If there lives a witch in this forest, I will confront her."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She looked at Glinda: ,,You said, you will help me. Last chance Glinda... I will go to England. With, or without you."</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The next day, Elphaba left the castle through a window on her broom and a bag.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She flew a last round around the castle, and looked at Ginda's window, before she disappeared in the clouds...</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,I really hope, that you didn't thought, I would let you go by yourself."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Elphaba stoppped in midair, and turned around to see a big bubble approaching her.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,You know... a broom is more practically, than your bubble."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Could be, but I will not sit on a broom in my dresses."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Still old habbits?" Elphaba asked, and Glinda stroke over her beautifull dress, before she whispered: ,,Could be..."</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">They flew next to each other over the land, and Elphaba spottet Fiyero's castle.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,He should know it..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,He wouldn't understand it..." Elphaba said, and they coninued their journey...</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
