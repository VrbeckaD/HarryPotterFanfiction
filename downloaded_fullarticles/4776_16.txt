          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Harry, hurry up! You’re gonna be late!” Shouted Sirius from the kitchen.</p>
<p>	Remus took a sip of his tea, “Padfoot come on, we still have a few minutes before we need to leave.”</p>
<p>	“But what if he forgets his cauldron? Or he trips trying to rush too quickly to class and accidentally sets Mrs. Norris on fire?” he took a sip of his own tea, scrunched up his face, and reached for the sugar. “Actually, that might not be the worst idea.”</p>
<p>	Remus sighed. “You’re right,” he muttered, “but not about terrorizing an innocent animal.” He walked out of the kitchen to see what was taking Harry so long.</p>
<p>	Harry rushed into the room right at that moment, leaving his trunk by the front door and making a beeline for the toast Sirius had left out for him. “Sorry dad, my hair just won’t stay flat,” he haphazardly dropped a glob of marmalade onto his toast, folded it in half, and took a bite, “and I know how important it is to you for me to make a good first impression on my teachers.”</p>
<p>Sirius set down his tea and walked over to put a hand on either side of Harry’s face. “It’s alright, if anyone has a problem with your hair or your skin, they aren’t worth your time anyway.” He smiled and went back to his tea, “Moony and I are more worried about you accidentally setting fire to Mrs. Norris, or scaring people by jumping up three flights of stairs again.”</p>
<p>Harry grinned sheepishly and wolfed down the rest of his breakfast. “I’m not gonna set her on fire. Okay, I’m ready to go now.”</p>
<p>Sirius jumped to his feet. “You sure you got everything? You’re cauldron? Telescope, scales? Did you pack enough underwear?”</p>
<p>Remus placed a hand on his partner’s shoulder, “Padfoot, it’s alright. We double checked everything last night, remember?”</p>
<p>He sighed, “I just want him to have a good year.” He turned to Harry, “you do have everything though, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I got everything. Haven’t opened my trunk since you helped me check everything yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Okay. One more thing though,” He picked up a rectangular package from the table, “this was your dad’s, your real dad’s. It’s a two way mirror and I have the other one. Just say my name into the mirror and we’ll be able to see each other through our mirrors and talk whenever you want.”</p>
<p>“Woah,” said Harry, taking the mirror, “thanks, dad. I’ve never heard of anything like this.”<br/>Remus and Sirius both hugged Harry before they moved to leave the apartment.</p>
<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Sirius, “I also put another gift in your trunk. Another one of your dad’s things. And don’t forget to tell us immediately if Snivellus--” </p>
<p>Remus coughed pointedly. “And there’s actually another gift in there from me. You were saying, Sirius?”</p>
<p> “Right. Let us know through the mirror immediately if Professor Snape gives you any trouble.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I think I’ve got it. I’m gonna miss you guys.”</p>
<p>Remus smiled fondly, “We will miss you too, more than you could ever know. Have fun, but don’t get in any trouble.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Sirius, drawing out the syllable, “you wouldn’t be your father’s son if you didn’t break a few rules.” He looked at Remus, “Just don’t do anything dangerous and you’ll be alright.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” said Harry, nodding and picking up Hedwig’s cage. “Didn’t we need to leave five minutes ago?”</p>
<p>“Nah,” said Sirius, “You won’t miss the train. If I’m right about the traffic around this time, we should still get to the station at least half an hour early.”</p>
<p>“Still,” added Remus, “We better head out now. Got everything? Good.” The three of them left the small apartment, loaded up the car, and set off towards King’s Cross.</p></div>
