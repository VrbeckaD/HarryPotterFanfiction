    <p>Marietta’s curse was difficult to explain from the outside looking in, she supposed. There was nothing functionally wrong with her, and if she looked in the mirror, she would not have been able to tell she was under any malicious magic, except when someone shoved her away from her reflection without a second thought. She was used to such treatment, though, and it was substantially milder than other experiences she could name.</p><p>Put simply, it was not as if anyone hated her, or could not see her, they ignored her as they might a fly on the wall, and when she failed to stay out of their way, they treated her with the indifference reserved for a fly to be swatted. Moving through crowds had become such a painful experience she had grown accustomed to waiting for them to clear or at least thin out, though sometimes she got ahead of them. It was a substandard existence to be sure, but it was an existence, so she supposed she should be grateful.</p><p>She no longer agonized over her former friend getting her to join the Defense Association, something she knew she had been stupid to go along with, and worse to betray, since she could have just stopped attending. Being honest with herself, what stood out as her real mistake was asking what measures were in place to prevent people from ratting them out; she hardly wanted to be caught with her name on such a list.</p><p>The moment came back to her, not for the first time.</p><p>“Well, I thought it better to keep it a secret, but since you asked, and it is important, I’ve placed an enchantment on the parchment with our names,” Hermione Granger had explained. “Anyone who talks about the group with anyone whose name is not on the list will be cursed with… well, a fittingly unpleasant appearance.”</p><p>It seemed obvious to Marietta that she was putting it mildly out of politeness, since it would demonstrate a lack of faith by declaring the exact nature of the curse like a threat, but some of her friends saw it differently.</p><p>“That’s it?” Harry Potter asked. “I mean, I’m sure it’s an incredibly complex bit of magic-“</p><p>“It should be worse,” a tall boy with red hair asserted. “Harry could be going to Azkaban over this- really, all of us-“</p><p>“Well, I suppose it is a bit mild, but what I was thinking at the time was that we would know who did it, and then be able to respond appropriately,” Hermione explained. “There’s some chance that the secret could be revealed to one person, and not go any further than that, and it also might be an accident-“</p><p>“It’s an accident that’s easy to avoid, especially when you know what could happen,” said someone Marietta did not know.</p><p>“Frankly, I would prefer to attach a more severe punishment to the curse, and be done with it,” opined another. “I wouldn’t want anything to do with a traitor.”</p><p>“Neither would I.” Marietta had a thought that the witch speaking could be the sister of the red-haired wizard. “I think that person should be completely cut off.”</p><p>“It has to be at least as bad as prison for it to make sense,” one of the wizards from before decided. “If you put a dozen people in Azkaban, you should get something that’s like going there, only a dozen times over. That way, each one of us would want to keep the secret as much as everyone else wants us to keep it.” Marietta had a thought that the wizard had a future in law, or perhaps public policy. He wore a blue tie, but she did not know everyone from Ravenclaw.</p><p>Essentially, it was agreed that a different curse would be applied to the parchment, one that would, as it was explained, make a traitor permanently ignored, never again regarded as a human. She knew Granger had something of a banner for the rights of non-humans that she waved about, so from the sound of it, the subject would be treated like an elf or perhaps a centaur, the idea being to demonstrate their sad lot in life. Marietta usually rolled her eyes at the notion, not bothering to make the case with the idealistic children that if the creatures of near-human intelligence wanted to be regarded as equals, they could go through the proper channels. It would do wonders for their case that they could actually adopt the customs of wizards.</p><p>When she eventually decided that whatever the effects of the curse, they could be negated, she reported the activities of Dumbledore’s Army to the proper authorities, but was quite shocked to find they did not have anything to say to her in response. She remembered following Professor Umbridge quite a way, waiting to hear something that would tell her she was out of the woods herself, but it appeared she was more concerned with assembling the Inquisitorial Squad and putting the matter to rest. Over the next several hours, she expected to have to testify, but was surprised to find no one asked her any questions, and to make matters worse, Potter and his friends actually got away with it, even if they lost their favorite Headmaster.</p><p>It seemed almost certain at that point that she would be receiving an earful from the people foolish enough to go against official policy, but the earful never came. When she next saw Granger, the witch passed right by her without so much as a glance. They were in the library, so she did not call after her, and it hardly seemed worth the effort, even if she could find out the limitations of the curse. Sighing, she looked around and noticed a couple in violation of the policy about public displays of affection. She went to see the librarian.</p><p>“Madam Pince, those students over there, I believe they are violating the rules about proximity and displays of affection.” There was no response. “Excuse me, they are being quite overt. I recognize that the proximity rule is a new one, and some may not be aware of it, but public displays of affection have been considered improper since the foundation of the school.”</p><p>Eventually Marietta decided that the librarian was ignoring her, and by extension that the curse made her unnoticeable to staff as well as students, which confirmed what she was starting to suspect in class. She made her way over to the couple in the corner, taking her wand out.</p><p>“If the authorities cannot hear me, I shall just have to show them,” she decided. “Failing that, I shall deal with the matter myself.”</p><p>The witch and wizard were in a dark corner at the least, but it was quite clear what they were doing upon any kind of inspection. They were kissing quite… passionately, and despite the witch’s playful swatting, the wizard took liberties with his hands. She would not allow him to put one up her skirt, but her head went back as he felt her chest. They seemed to find the whole thing rather amusing, testing their daring to see if it could keep up with their lust.</p><p>Marietta made a face and continued watching in what she presumed to be a morbid fascination before casting a leg-locker on the witch, but that only made the wizard chuckle a bit at what he must have guessed to be a sudden development of bashfulness as he guided her hand to his manhood, presumably. She had no desire at all to see what was going on under the table; it was only so she could aim properly that she moved closer.</p><p>Casting a full-body-bind just as the witch had a hand on the wizard’s belt, she found the spell blocked by a quickly erected shield. She wondered whether the girl with her wand out cast it to hide her misdeeds or to return Marietta’s spell, remembering there was some possibility they could hear her. Rather than an answer, however, she received a curse from the momentarily scowling wizard, which she dodged.</p><p>“Well, clearly I’m not qualified to deal with the both of you. I hope your pleased with yourselves- or each other.” If they heard her jab, it was likely impossible for them to find it funny.</p><p>Groaning, she found the table where Hermione had been heading a moment earlier, finding her writing something absently on a length of parchment while reading. Annoyed, if not surprised at her lack of acknowledgement, Marietta sat down across from her and stared. The title of the book indicated it was a history resource, meaning it would be no help in her present situation, but its reader had to know something.</p><p>“I know you weren’t the one to think of this petty, juvenile prank as a punishment.” Hermione continued to write, entirely undeterred. “This really is beneath the likes of us, you know. That you’re continuing this at all only means you wish you’d gotten out ahead of me.” The brunette witch’s nose scrunched momentarily. “It was a sinking ship and we all knew it.”</p><p>The silent girl got up, leaving the parchment behind.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Sneak,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I have some idea of who you are, but only by process of elimination. I expect your mother, working for the Ministry, amounted to some influence in your treachery, and for that reason I shall grant you the small mercy of explaining your condition. I shall not attempt to remove the curse I have placed on you under any circumstances, so there is no point to any further attempts to contact me. I have asked Madam Pince to expunge the record of all books I have checked out in the past and I have destroyed my own notes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I can hear your voice, but I am plainly incapable of caring what you have to say. Have you ever desired to communicate with a flobberworm? Well, they might be your only potential friends at this point; I truly do not know, but you might register as interesting enough. I can see you, and from this ascertain some basic information about you, but your presence does not matter to me unless you are speaking, which is annoying, like a fly buzzing or a wireless set to a volume too low to distinguish words. I shall not remember this encounter because you quite simply do not warrant the expenditure of brain cells.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The same curse cast on a wizard would likely result in his being held in only the regard for a strange man in close proximity; not a threat, but reason enough for a small child to move away. Other wizards would not think of him at all, except those of an unwelcome variety. You, however, will be treated with the distinction of being female. Should a young man’s eyes pass over your chest, make an attempt not to take any primal sense of satisfaction, as his momentary interest has nothing to do with the nature of your remaining assets or the traitor of which they are part. When male students bump into you or shove you out of the way, expect no sense of shame at the thought of crushing a delicate flower, and expect no tenuous sense of kinship from witches. I can assure you that I do not regard you as competition, and even the pettiest, most insufferable debutantes like Pansy Parkinson would likely say the same. Though young wizards may have a slight physical response to your body, and then only if bare or directly in front of them, there is not a single one among them who thinks of you as a potential mate, and not a decent one who would follow the physical response with a verbal one. Mathematically, there should be some amount of female students at Hogwarts who prefer the same sex, and you would count yourself lucky not to be one of them, as they generally assume witches to be of the majority preference; that you are female will not make you interesting to them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The only manner of attention you will receive will be sexual, and you will only receive it from those of the masculine persuasion, and within that only the most lecherous and detestable. I suggest acquainting yourself with Marcus Flint, assuming he is still around here somewhere; if I remember correctly he was quite indiscriminate with the rears he struck out of appreciation, though he might have favored targets unlikely to hex him for such behavior. Make an attempt not to punish such acts, as you will only be held in any positive regard the instant they occur. Perhaps that will be how you can eke out an existence, unless remembered in the form of a notch in the belt of a Casanova type.</em>
</p><p>There was more to the letter, but Marietta did not bother to read it, scoffing and putting it into a book before putting that into her schoolbag. On the subject, she doubted that Granger had written the entire thing just while sitting there, but it hardly mattered, as long as she was only going to write about how terrible her life would be from then on.</p><p>“She’s hardly clever enough to come up with an unbreakable curse, and it is even less likely she could implement something that I could not at least understand,” she decided, scarcely even annoyed by the minor setback. It was true that people had ignored her thus far, but it was not as if she had spoken to everyone. It was far better to keep her head about her than do as the letter suggested, considering it was still highly unlikely the whole thing would not be resolved within the afternoon.</p><p>She left the library without further thought on the subject.</p>
