    <p>
  <span>Harry slowly made her way out of the empty castle and walked, vanished in shadows, to the end of the bridge where the memorial was being placed. It was a statue of her with her wand up, as if she were protecting the students of Hogwarts as they entered the school.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death snickered. “It…looks quite nice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up.” She pulled a face at the thing. “It doesn't look anything like me.” He smirked at her. Moving closer to him, Harry smiled at Tom and whispered. “No tears at my funeral? Rude!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He jerked up but made no other move. Harry grinned and slid her hand around his torso. “Can I be naughty? I really wanna be naughty.” Her hand was dangerously close to his belt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom whispered very quietly behind his hand. “Harriet, after this ordeal is over I am going to kill you myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ooh, kinky.” She withdrew her hand, but rested her hands on his shoulders and massaged him gently. “I’m alright now, Tom. I’m perfectly fine. In fact, I rather enjoyed the vacation with my parents. The Isles of Heroes is all partying all day and night.” She was </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> going to tell him about her time with Antonin. That was never going to reach his ears. And of course, Antonin was never going to find out that she was in a relationship with Tom during her stint in the Underworld. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ehhh, technically, I was dead, so there technically wasn’t any infidelity, right?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Speaking smoothly, Harry continued to massage his shoulders. “I got to do a drinking contest with freaking Merlin! Also, met Salazar…and I may have managed to win him over about the Necromancy stuff.” She felt the tension in his shoulders slowly ease out of his body.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s our next move?” He spoke out of the corner of his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“War’s already starting. The borders are being attacked, and Muggles are being wiped constantly. Grindelwald won’t stop until his control in both Magical and Muggle governments is stable. Then he’ll rip the curtain down to reveal the Wizarding World. We have until then to make his life a living hell and get him either magically bound, sucked into a soul catcher, or fatally wounded so his soul can be nabbed down below. Each method is going to be extremely challenging, because each method requires us to get close to him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom nodded slowly, seeming to all and sundry to be nodding along with a man named Elphias Doge. “Alright. After this, where do we meet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Back in my hidden room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happens when you reveal yourself?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not going to. Not until I can see an opportunity to after the war that won’t turn everyone against me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right. Got it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have several plans for how the students of Hogwarts can help in the war effort, and many of those plans are very violent and deadly, Tom. Don’t sulk. You’ll get to kill many people.” He snorted softly and then tensed when she removed her hands. Harry whispered to him, “Relax. I’m just going back to my room. Have no intention of hanging around here and listening to people politicize my death.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded to Death and then vanished back to her room. She mentally told Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Remus, Sirius, Aberforth, Blaise, Karina, the twins, and Severus that she was awake and waiting for them to come to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus quickly replied with a confirmation. He had quite a lot to report from his side as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the funeral, everyone she contacted rushed into the Headmaster’s Tower. Harry sent her Patronus to Minerva also. The woman nearly fainted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a bit of time to explain everything to her, but when she did, Harry sat everyone down and looked at the letter. “From what Hermione said-” Everyone was on their feet with wands out. Harry rolled her eyes as she waved Severus into the room. “This is Severus Snape, guys. Not a traitor. Definitely not a traitor. Please lower your wands and sit back down. Sheesh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grudgingly, they did. Harry huffed a breath and then looked at them all. “Alright, one thing at a time. Both Death and I were pretty much isolated from the living world for a week. I spent most of that time with my parents rocking the party scene on the Isle of Heroes.” Harry smirked and then waved her hand. “Albus was there too until about halfway. Time works differently in the Underworld, but he vanished roughly about three days into my impromptu vacation. We both thought he was going to show up in a coffin under Aberforth’s control.” Harry grimaced. “We turned out to be wrong. Severus?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus exhaled and then sneered at Sirius before beginning. “The Dark Lord still is unaware of my status. However, Pettigrew has found his way back to him and is constantly going out, running errands in the gutters of all sorts of cities. The Dark Lord keeps him busy.” Severus swallowed. “I was there when the headmaster woke up. At first, he was disoriented but…he gained his bearings quickly. Unfortunately, I wasn’t the only one present when he awoke. Narcissa was there. She lives in Paris now in the Malfoy chateau there. She owned that one herself so Draco let her have it in the Malfoy schism.” That had been all over the papers. Harry frowned and shook her head as she looked over the Daily Prophet papers detailing what had been dubbed the ‘Malfoy Schism’. Apparently, Narcissa had been discovered to be spying on Draco and only pretending to be loyal to Dumbledore and the Order. Draco had been crushed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snape continued. “She rushed to inform the Dark Lord, who was…overjoyed. The Headmaster later contacted me via Soul Legilimency when the Dark Lord was out of the room preparing a prison room for the headmaster.” Severus looked at Harry dully. “The headmaster claimed that it was for the best that Narcissa had been present. To have escaped on my watch would have jeopardized myself. Also, the headmaster seems to think he can distract the Dark Lord and use his close proximity to help capture him. So he told me not to try and help him escape, as he didn’t plan on leaving.” Chuckling bitterly, Severus looked at Harry only, ignoring everyone else. “To say the Dark Lord was pleased with the Headmaster coming back to life would be an understatement. The only times he stops trying to break into the headmaster’s soul would be to eat, organize the war, and sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry cursed quietly. “And the war effort?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He has Turkey and Greenland under his control. It is confirmed. Also, he has won over Mexico and South Africa.” Ron cursed in the background. Sirius agreed with him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Waving her hand, Harry gestured for him to continue. “And Albus?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is holding his own extremely well. The Dark Lord is losing his patience.” Severus smirked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry exhaled and ventured to allow herself to look relieved. “Well, that’s the first thing we must do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Two missions.” Harry grinned at her council. “Bind Gellert Grindelwald and rescue Albus Dumbledore. If Luck serves us, then we could do it both at the same time. However, we have a time limit. As I told Tom, we have to win this war and bind Grindelwald before the Statute of Secrecy is destroyed. I do not want the Muggles finding out about us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What a little liar you are, Harriet.” Death smirked at her. Harry ignored him with extreme ease. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius spoke up. “What do we do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry grinned darkly. “Minerva, pardon the use of your name but I’m not a student anymore, you will become Headmistress and turn Hogwarts into a military school. The first years, second years, and third years will only learn defensive magic. The fourth years will then choose which area they wish to further train in. For this initial year, the fifth, sixth, and seventh years will be doing the same and then experience intensive studying in that chosen field.” Harry waved her wand with the Flagrate spell and a list formed. </span>

</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked at Minerva’s shocked face. “Questions?” Tom blinked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long have you been thinking about this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since the fourth year. Albus and I actually thought it up together.” Harry held up the spell until Minerva could copy all of it. When she was done, Harry dropped it and looked at them. “As to the students already in their years, they will be asked to help. If they say no, then they will be encouraged to finish their careers in Hogwarts and left alone. If they say yes, then they will be ‘drafted’ so to speak and the training will begin on a faster track than normal. These students are minors, and this is purely a volunteer basis.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone was nodding. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus waved his hand slightly. “What about the Order of the Phoenix?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nodding, Harry turned to Severus and waved her hands around the room. “Besides these people, I’m afraid no one can know about me being alive or about Severus’ true loyalty. The people with us right now are the only ones who knew about Necromancy from the start. To tell the others </span>
  <em>
    <span>now </span>
  </em>
  <span>would be…inadvisable.” Severus’ eyes were filled with grim amusement but his face remained stony. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus exhaled but nodded. “I understand. We’ll have the Order vote in whoever they are most comfortable with as leader. They will be working more in hand with the Ministries and legal governments anyways.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded to Tom when he cleared his throat. He smiled at her. “Guerilla Warriors?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“DAM.” Harry smirked at Ron’s quiet ‘yes!’ “Once again, volunteer basis, but those who want to will be trained as Warriors, or as any of the other groups.” Harry looked at Hermione and then at Tom. “Guerilla warfare will be intense. I’ll be doing it the majority of the time. Working on information from Severus and other spies from House Elves and such, I will be with a small group of people that I trust implicitly or on my own. Then I will go to countries, organize rebel groups, destroy a few bases, and return to Hogwarts. Rinse and repeat. All throughout my attacks I will be searching for Albus and getting him back. I have a few ideas of where he’ll be. France is one of them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Minerva swallowed and then stood up. “I will have Draco Malfoy put on as a governor in Hogwarts and put these changes forward. With war already declared, I’m sure the Minister will back me up on providing defense for the younger students and options for the older students. This soldier part is a good olive branch as well. I’m sure Scrimgeour will appreciate that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snorting, Harry gave the woman a look. “I’m sure he’ll assume that I did it for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. Excuse me. I have quite a few things to do.” Minerva nodded to them all, including Severus, and then swiftly walked away. Harry turned to Severus. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should leave before you’re missed. How’s your shielding?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, Miss Potter.” He sneered at her. “You worry yourself over nothing.” With that, he vanished into shadow. Harry smirked and then turned to the others. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>~meanwhile~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus opened his eyes and looked over before slumping his head back against the satin pillow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tutting, Gellert slipped onto the bed with him and slid a hand up his chest to caress his beard. “Now is that any way to greet your love?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are not my love.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes.” Gellert chuckled in grudging respect. “She trained you very well. I have to admit. Your soul is covered in steel and diamonds. I cannot get in, not even in sleep.” Gellert checked the shadows binding Albus and smiled as he assured himself his love’s arms were getting proper circulation. “This wouldn’t be necessary if you didn’t try to escape every five minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Five? I thought it was every other minute.” Albus hissed when Gellert kissed his temple and then moved and bit his earlobe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm, I may have been distracted by the constant realization that you are back in my arms. In my bed.” His eyes glittered with lust. “In me…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Never.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm. Well, until you’re ready for that step, I’ll be in you.” He pulled him into another kiss. Albus refused to reciprocate. “You’re so stubborn, my love.” Drawing away, Gellert shook his head. “So incredibly stubborn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a wink, Gellert slipped away and exited the room. He sat down and stared at the fireplace. “Evette-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harriet Potter will be hunting you soon. You will lose him as quickly as you gained him if you do not leave Cannes soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re still high.” Gellert stared at her. “Harriet is dead. The Idiot Parkinson Girl stabbed her five times with a bloody Bone Dagger.” He rolled his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Standing from her favorite velvet cushion, Evette looked at him calmly. “What did you give her to make her equal, and what did she make for herself?” She gave him a very small smirk and walked out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cursing the woman’s vagueness, but secretly understanding that being vague allowed the future to remain the same, Gellert stared at the fire and thought intently. He considered his own visions and then meditated on Evette’s words. His eyes slowly widened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A wand that changes loyalties…a stone that disappeared…a cloak that was inherited upon the father’s death…BLOODY FUCKING HELL!” He stood up and rushed into the bedroom again. “Albus…six years ago, you told me that it was just a scar on her wrist! You lied to me…She’s another Master! Did you know then? Does she know?” Albus gave no hint that he heard, but Gellert knew his lover well. He saw the tension and knew his conclusion was accurate. “Could she come back from even a Bone Dagger?” Gellert leaned against the wall and then sighed. “I should just assume she can and go from there.” Suddenly, he smiled. “Neither can live while the other survives…now that </span>
