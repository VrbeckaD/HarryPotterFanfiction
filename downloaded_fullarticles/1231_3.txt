    <p>Severus Snape was <em> happy </em> . There was a skip in his step and he held his head high. He was experiencing something very unusual, for him - invulnerability. He had an accomplishment he was proud of, and he was <em> recognized </em> for it. He looked at people from above, and they <em> accepted </em> it. Months like this were the reason he became a Death Eater. His path was finally paved. Nobody could take it away from him - he heard the prophecy, and he gave it to his master, the greatest wizard, the Dark Lord.</p><p>When Severus Snape realized his master took the prophecy to mean Harry Potter, somewhere deep within his mind, it is possible that he remembered how <em> lucky </em> he felt that he was the one who got to deliver the prophecy to the Dark Lord, and how he should have known better, but most likely, he did not.</p><p>The feeling that the world had ended tugged at him gently, at first. The end of the seventh month saw the birth of two potential targets, after all. <em> He might change his mind. It might be the Longbottom baby. He is a pureblood, and both of his parents are gifted wizards… </em></p><p>“Something on your mind, Severus?”</p><p>
  <em> He knows. </em>
</p><p>“My Lord… I believe it refers to the Longbottoms,” Severus said, hoping his tone did not betray the urgency.</p><p>“If you had not been careless enough to get yourself thrown out, we might have known for certain,” Lord Voldemort chastised him. The message was clear, to Severus and to all the other Death Eaters: No one is immune. Not even the one who gave me the prophecy.</p><p>Common sense screamed at him: <em> What are you doing? How thick are you? She chose Potter, she could not have run off to be with him faster, why would you risk your neck for her? He is going to kill you, then her. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. </em></p><p>But Severus did not shut up. The fear he now felt was unlike anything he felt before. It was at once both familiar and strange. Not the cold sensation, the small electrocutions, the constricted flow of air he knew so well - it was that too, of course - but mixed with hope, hope of saving something worth saving, or preventing a catastrophe, a calamity…</p><p>“My Lord, I beg of you, spare Lily Evans,” he uttered.</p><p>The room fell silent. All eyes fell upon him, the Dark Lord’s eyes among them, and a crease formed between them, and his lower eyelids wrinkled, for a very brief moment before he became impassive again. Severus knew, instinctively, what he needed to say to get away with what he said: <em>He is your master. You care not for her. You want to use her and dispose of her. Give her what she deserves</em>. He uttered the vile words - “Oh but my Lord! I simply want to show her what a mistake she made be choosing Potter. Imagine the mudblood alone, her son dead, realizing she’s at my complete mercy. I simply want to repay her humiliation. And take what’s mine. Then you may do with her what you will”, and he believed them.</p><p>As Severus told lies of of lust and despicable desire, he remembered how, moments before he let the word “mudblood” escape his lips in reference to Lily for the first time, and the last time until that moment, James Potter hexed him, nearly drowned him in a mixture of sudsy water and his own saliva, how his throat struggled to expel it...</p><p>The foreign presence that invaded his mind receded. The great legilimens believed him.</p><p>“You will have your day with her,” the Dark Lord promised him. “She will not die before you get what is due to you.” His lips curled upwards slightly, suggestively, and he looked away.</p><p>It was not enough. He needed - the very thought almost made him audibly gulp - Dumbledore.</p><p>
  <u> After the Meeting with Dumbledore </u>
</p><p><em> What have I done</em>, Severus asked himself, or rather, the question asked itself in his mind, incessant and tormenting. <em> What have I done</em>, a question that could refer to any number of things he did, but for which there was no answer. He could not think of anything else, as images and sounds rushed and flashed through his mind, <em> what have I done. </em></p><p>Severus Snape had just committed flagrant betrayal. He met with Dumbledore, Leader of the Order of the Phoenix and his master’s sworn enemy, and he swore to give him <em> anything </em> to protect Lily and James, and their child.</p><p>The walls closed in on him. His nerves were frayed. His eyes were forced wide open in the dark room.</p><p>Severus was paralyzed, quite literally paralyzed, as if he had been subjected to the Full Body Bind. A sheen of unreality began to cover the events that just transpired, and Severus found himself reacquainted with a side of himself he was all too happy to leave behind, the Severus who cowered in darkness, who knelt before towering, contemptuous figures… This Severus has been dormant and silent for a little over four years. For a little over four years, Severus savored the silence. He has not been afraid in four years. Then, four (or forty) years’ worth of fear caught up with him in mere weeks.</p><p><em>He is going to kill me</em>, Severus thought, and without him willing it, the meeting with Dumbledore assumed, in his mind, the quality of a dream, of a story told in the third person, of something that happened to somebody else. <em>You have done nothing. The Dark Lord loves you. You brought him the prophecy, and he loves you, </em>his terrified psyche told him. Severus covered himself with a blanket up to his eyes like he did as a child. He did not miss this.</p><p>Slowly, very slowly (muscles trembling, every creak in the old house magnified), the lie he told himself to banish the intrusive, omnipresent sensations and memories began to take effect. <em> He loves you. He will spare her for you. He loves you. </em> If he could just keep the meeting with Dumbledore a secret, he might somehow make it through, and so might she.</p><p>He took out a book entitled simply: “Occlumency”.</p><p>
  <u> October 31, 1981 </u>
</p><p>Usually, the Dark Lord picked any number of faithful servants to either accompany him or perform tasks for him, but destroying the Potters was a solo mission. Thus, Severus could not know. Nobody knew.</p><p>Lily had been protected by the Fidelius Charm. She was secluded, isolated, but alive. It has been months, and Severus finally felt like he could breathe freely again.</p><p>He betrayed his master, he fed information to Dumbledore, he even endured a Cruciatus or two as the Dark Lord had grown weary of listening to Severus plead with him to go after the Longbottoms first. All of it - for her. His love for her overcame his hatred for James. Some days, when he woke up, before the waking world caught up to him, it even seemed to eclipse his love for the Dark Lord. It frightened Severus, but she was alive, and as long as she was alive, he could love both Lily and Lord Voldemort, and as long as he loved Lord Voldemort, he could live as well.</p><p>The first sign that anything was wrong appeared - or rather, disappeared - on Severus’s arm. The Dark Mark was faded. This could not be. <em> Dumbledore</em>, he thought. <em> I have to get to Dumbledore. </em> <em><br/> </em>Shortly thereafter, Severus staggered out of Dumbledore’s office. Though he felt like every step was a step off a cliff, outwardly, his movements looked slow and reserved.</p><p>Sirius Black betrayed Lily - betrayed <em>James</em>, and gave the Dark Lord the location of their hideaway. The Dark Lord set off to seek and destroy them, and apparently, he gave Lily a choice, and Lily - naturally, so naturally - did not take that choice.</p><p>If the Dark Lord loved him and wanted to reward him, he did not love him enough to merely petrify Lily and only do away with the child. She died. The little girl who charmed flowers and flew off a swing, who could control her magic at the age of nine without even knowing she was magic, died of the Killing Curse. Severus came very close to finding out if one could cast the Killing Curse on oneself. He fully believed that he could.</p><p>Then, Dumbledore said her son had her eyes. He tormented him with the memory of the almond-shaped and emerald-colored eyes that once smiled at him and were now closed forever, and somehow, this pulled him back to the land of the living, the land of suffering and pain and loss and fear, his constant companions.</p><p>Severus was able to secure Dumbledore’s vow of secrecy. If he had to stay alive, nobody could know. Nobody could touch that tender part of him.</p><p>But one person, one person alive, knew all too well, and that person’s silence had to be secured.</p><p>Severus set out to find Petunia Dursley.</p><p>He found the long-necked harpy at No. 4, Privet Drive.</p><p>“I know by now that I can’t force you to love him anymore than I could force her to love me,” he said to her in the most menacing tone he could muster in his grief. “But if he dies, your blonde Muggle lump dies. If you get rid of him, your son will suffer. I am not above torturing filth like you and yours, Petunia. Or killing.” He hoped she remembered how much it hurt her when he charmed a tree branch to hit her Muggle shoulder.</p><p>After she recovered from the shock, she realized Severus Snape was the only one who could answer her question: “what if my son is like her?” He scoffed. Then, almost inaudibly, she asked him if she suffered. He thought to answer, “Only if you call being a fugitive because your childhood friend betrayed you to the most powerful dark wizard the world has ever known, dying, having just witnessed your husband murdered, in fear for your son’s life, knowing your secret keeper gave you away, suffering. But the death itself was painless.” Instead, he said only: “No. I hope to never see you again. And one more thing, <em>Tuney.</em> I put a curse on you. As long as you live or until I break it, you will not be able to tell a soul about me. So do not try.” With that, he left. That took care of the only person who knew what he lost.</p><p>Petunia was nothing like her sister. In appearance she was average; whatever appeal she might have had was negated by her jealousy, her envy, her shrill demeanor, her bitter disposition. What was she like when she was not clamoring for attention in Lily’s shadow? Severus neither knew, nor cared.<br/> In his Death Eater years, he hardly thought of Lily, and he never thought of Petunia. He could hardly spare her a thought when they were children, after all, except hoping she will go away or shut up. But a face from the distant past has a way of opening the floodgates, and that face - that confused, terror-stricken, yet spiteful face - opened the floodgates.</p><p><u> A friend, a fight, a funeral</u><br/> The summers, the Christmas breaks, Lily’s parents and their house - Severus’s respite from misery and violence at school, at home.</p><p>The rush of memories was barely coherent, but unlike the memories of his secret meetings with Dumbledore, the dream-like quality, the third person feel, did not affect them in the least.</p><p>When Severus was only 9 years old, he ran to his mother - his poor, depleted, defeated mother - and after instinctively checking that his father was not home, he asked her: “Are there other witches and wizards here? I think I found one.”<br/> The pale black-haired woman listened to his confused account and confirmed - the girl is magic. She has <em> extraordinary </em> magic. Just knowing this relieved a loneliness so deep and so complete, that the boy realized for the first time that he has been lonely, that he would like a friend… He got lost in thought, but the sound of his father’s approaching footsteps took him out of his reverie, and when the key entered the keyhole, the boy and his mother both flinched - she looked at him with a pained, guilty expression, and their conversation about magic was over. Tobias did not like hearing about his wife’s and son’s “abnormality”. He only believed magic was real when something went wrong, when an appliance stopped working, when he lost a bet. Why should he have? Eileen only agreed to volunteer that she lost of power in a “freak accident” (“freak alright”, Tobias used to mock her), so the only evidence of magic, as far as he was concerned, was that Eileen was completely useless at doing anything the normal way.<br/> But the girl became his friend, and she was <em> impressed </em> with him, his stories about Hogwarts, the Ministry, Azkaban and the Dementors (it amused him, the way she worried about them - who would want to put her there? Who would want to see her suffer?).</p><p>She used to invite him to her house, and her parents were nothing like his - they were warm, loving, kind - and they were proud of their witch daughter.</p><p>He desperately wanted to turn 11, turn 11 and go, get away from Spinner’s End and be among his own kind at last, but it went wrong immediately. The Hogwarts Express barely left Platform 9 ¾ before he somehow managed to make two enemies, and Lily, though still his friend, now did not need him. She too was among her kind, and she was one of those rare people who were both universally loved and worthy of this love. He only had her to himself in the summers and Christmas breaks.<br/> Their fifth year Christmas break, that he almost did not go on, would be the last break they would spend as friends. It was a farce of a break, and as it drew to a close, Severus had enough of watching the Muggle bastard who gave him his nose terrorize his mother. “Hurt her again and you die, Tobias. The Muggle police won’t know what hit them,” he promised his father, not caring that delivering on his promise will surely land him in Azkaban.</p><p>The rage that ensued was such that the only place where he was safe was Lily’s house. He limped there, and told her everything, and she cried, and her tears were phoenix tears. “You did the right thing,” she told him. “You are so brave, Sev,” she said. Her parents insisted on giving her money to buy her very own broomstick, after that. They flatly refused to consider letting her ride one until then, of course, and of course she never did buy that broomstick - the loud and completely fake argument they had about it was a pretext for giving him money to buy supplies. Nobody in the whole world had a friend like her, he felt.<br/> Months later, only months, Severus uttered the filthy word that severed him from Lily. It should have been a good day. He knew he had just earned an O in his Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.</p><p>It became his most shameful memory.</p><p>That summer, he earned money working for the Malfoys for a couple of weeks, before he came home and found out his mother had died. He pointed the wand at his father: “Get out, and never come back”. His father left without so much as an attempt to explain or to beg for his life, and Snape never knew what eventually killed her. He owled Lily and asked her to stand by him at the small service... The message she owled back to him only said: “I am sorry about your mother. I liked her. The Malfoys, not so much”. <em> Have it your way, Lily, </em> he thought.</p><p>After he magically erected a tombstone for Eileen Prince, he owled the Malfoys. “I am ready for the Dark Mark. No one can stop me now.”<br/> Too proud to have a last look in the direction of the Evans house, he was gone.<br/> The Dark Lord appeared reluctant to let a 16-year-old join his army, but Lucius Malfoy spoke very highly of the young man. Lucius always believed in him, always supported him, and he could not be happier that Lily was out of the picture.</p><p><u> The fearless years<br/> </u>“I do not wish to interfere with your magical education”, the Dark Lord said. “I reward commitment. You are free, always, to leave,” he promised him. But with nowhere to go, young Severus wanted nothing more than to join the Death Eaters. He told the Dark Lord everything, about his Muggle father and the vendetta he had against the nasty, idiotic savages who dared to call the wizards freaks. Against the mudbloods who could always be trusted to choose their ridiculous families and their old values, as if magic was just handy skill, a party trick, when he knew that it was so much more.</p><p>He thought of Lily and the moving flower petals she showed Petunia. <em> She will never understand. </em> Magic was tradition, power, will, the magical world was so much bigger than so-called friendship, so much bigger than humanity.<br/> Severus implored, pleaded, besought the Dark Lord to give him the Mark. What else was there? Finally, the Dark Lord was satisfied of his commitment and of his longing, and the ceremony began. The process of receiving the Mark was almost hypnotic. He was calm. No defense was necessary, no doubt gnawed at him. The Dark Lord looked straight into his heart, and he saw his grief for his mother and the shame that he could not bring himself to kill his father. “Worry not, Severus. We will help you overcome your sentimentality”. The poverty... the ridicule... the bullying... the jealousy, the resentment, the helplessness against his father as he shouted profanities at his mother and him, as he beat them, and as he no longer needed to, but did anyway… The friend who could not forgive one word, whom he thought loved him, but apparently did not… and the next time Severus opened his eyes, his inner left arm bore the Mark that advertised that he was one of the select few, a Death Eater.</p><p>The Dark Lord knew just what to say. After he gave him the Mark, when they were alone, Lord Voldemort confided in him: “Almost a squib of the mother and a Muggle father, Severus? We are so alike.” He promised him a place in the world he was to build, and acceptance. “Everyone will know of your greatness. Your children will never suffer this disgrace.” He swelled with pride, hope for the future reared its head, anticipation bubbled in him. He practically forgot to care about the results of his O.W.L.s.<br/> For the first time, Severus felt at home. He did not need Lily. Finally, he could see a future, a life, without her. No Lily, no Eileen - his love was reserved for the Dark Lord and him alone, and he was rewarded for it, until the dust settled and Lily was taken from the world because of what he did.</p><p>The fearless years were resolutely over: Severus’s worst fear came true. His psyche rearranged itself around that fact - he loved Lily, and he killed her. He brought the Dark Lord the prophecy. Nobody could take that away from him. <em> What have I done? </em> He asked himself - and he answered: <em> You killed her. </em></p>
