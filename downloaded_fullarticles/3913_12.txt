    <p>Harry was looking over the Marauder’s Map, trying to find Malfoy. He hadn’t seen him around for a couple of days so, naturally, he was suspicious. Now he'd found him, just coming up to the 7th floor, surrounded by four other boys' names: Slytherins in the year above, Harry was fairly sure. If Draco was enlisting the help of older, more advanced, wizards then Harry needed to know why.</p><p>He grabbed his invisibility cloak and left the Common Room, not even bothering to tell his friend’s where he was off to. He found himself running towards Malfoy and his unusual posse, watching his own footsteps approaching theirs on the Map he didn't even think to hide, when suddenly, the group of footsteps vanished from the map. Harry stopped in his tracks, staring down at the enchanted parchment in utter confusion. Then he realised...the Room of Requirement! Of course, the Room was perfect for any Death Eaters’ plans go become a reality.</p><p>Harry ducked into a boys’ bathroom and pulled on his cloak before re-emerging, invisible. He found the tapestry of Barnabas the Balmy and his trolls, and began pacing back and forth, thinking about all the things Malfoy and those 7th years could be doing to aid the Dark Lord.</p><p>Once he was exhausted, both physically and mentally, he sat down against the wall, determined to wait until they left and hoping to sneak in when the doors opened.</p><p>He was awoken by voices, laughing and jeering, and opened his eyes to see the wall opposite him, where the bricks were usually all there was, had become an ornate doorway, and several 7th year boys were filing through it.</p><p>“Damn, I needed that.” One was saying with a grin, making the others laugh, rowdily agreeing and adding.</p><p>“It was so good, right?”</p><p>“He could charge money and I'd pay, literally.” It wasn’t until they were letting the door close, his mind fogged by sleep, that Harry realised Draco wasn’t with them anymore. He could hear them making dirty, sexual comments as they walked away down the corridor, nudging each other and laughing. Suddenly Harry felt a pang of worry for Malfoy, realising what they’d been doing wasn’t to further Voldemort's cause...it was to have sex! Four older boys...what if they forced Draco? What if they hurt him or worse?! Harry leapt the doors, but too late, his fingers scrabbled at the increasingly smooth stone until the doors appeared to never have existed. Harry swore, and restarted his pacing, his thoughts racing with one sentence, over and over.</p><p>I need to see if Malfoy is ok. I need to see if Malfoy is ok. I <em>need</em> to see if Malfoy is ok.</p><p>He walked back and forth for what felt like hours, his heart racing in his ears, when, finally, the same ornate doors appeared in the wall. Harry let out a sigh of relief, and rushed in.</p><p>He was surprised to the find the room much smaller than usual, about the size of his dormitory. A fire was crackling merrily in the hearth beneath a carved mantelpiece, adorned with roses and thorns, and there was a thick rug on the stone floor basking in the warm orange glow. Two large sofas lined one corner of the rug, the well-stuffed pillows facing the flames like sunflowers.</p><p>Opposite the hearth, was a large four-poster bed with velvet curtains drawn back by heavy gold rope, and lying on the mattress amongst the ruffled sheets was Draco Malfoy. He was naked, on his back, his arms and legs at odd angles, like he’d been dropped from a height. His eyes were open, but half lidded, staring up at the bed’s red canopy. His chest was moving so he was alive.</p><p>“M…Malfoy?” Harry asked, thinking it better he made himself known as soon as possible. Draco jumped at his voice, and sat up quickly, but his expression was pained and he looked very pale, his white gold hair completely dishevelled. He fumbled for his wand, but it rolled off the bed and clattered loudly on the stone floor. The liquid silver eyes narrowed at him, looking angry and confused and...scared?</p><p>“Potter…? What do you- H-how did you get in?” he demanded, looking between Harry and where the door usually appeared, now blank wall once again.</p><p>“It…the room let me in…” the Potter boy sort-of lied, leaving out the fact he’d tracked him down and waited for him for over an hour, then begged the room to let him in to check on his nemesis. “Are…are you ok…?” he asked. He could see that, even from a distance, Draco was trembling, and his skin clearly beginning to bruise in places. But the Malfoy didn't seem to be listening. He leaned back on one elbow, curling his body to the side, perhaps attempting to stand up. His movements were slow, like he was fighting some invisible force, and he looked feverish. He let out a small, almost inaudible, whimper as he shifted, his hand gripping the rumpled sheets beneath him.</p><p>Harry had never seen Malfoy so…vulnerable. He didn’t have any witty, snake-tongued comments, no insults to hurl at him… It was like he’d lost all of his fight…and Harry didn’t like that. “Do you need anything? I can run and get Madam Pomfrey if you’re hurt-” Draco glared up at him, eyes flashing like steel.</p><p>“I-I don’t need your pity… Get out…!” he tried to shout, sound angry, but his voice came out shaky, and weak with pain. His hair fell over his face, but Harry could swear he saw a glistening track slowly making its way down his cheek. His jaw was clenched, shoulder blades stabbing out from beneath his skin as he hunched over, tense.</p><p>“Well, I’m not leaving you alone like this.” Harry said decisively, no one deserved to be left alone like this, abused and discarded. He saw the darkest bruises were on his bony hips, and more were forming on his delicate wrists, the size of men’s hands.</p><p>Malfoy glared at him through his white veil of hair, then let out a shaky sigh.</p><p>“Make yourself useful then…get my wand…” he said, his voice wavering slightly. Harry nodded and obeyed, going around the bed to retrieve it. He found it quickly, though had to get on his knees to reach under the bed for it. He went back round to give it to Draco, who was slowly and shakily trying to push himself off the bed. Without thinking it through, Harry took hold of Draco’s skinny bicep in an attempt to assist him.</p><p>“Let me help you-” he started, but Draco jolted back from the touch like he’d been burned, slapping his hand away savagely. Harry looked at him to find terror in his eyes, and anger and sadness. He didn’t speak, just stared at him, and Harry looked down. “Sorry…I won’t touch you again…” he said softly. He saw Draco’s jaw tighten but he didn’t say anything. He waved his wand over himself.</p><p>“Coriumtersus,” he said softly, and his skin became clean and dry before Harry’s eyes, including whatever was on his thighs. Draco glanced at Harry before lowering his voice even more to murmur “Internumtersus,” his breath catching and back shivering as he waved his wand. He sighed, placing a shaky hand on the bedpost, using it as a support as he slid himself off the bed. His feet barely touched the ground before his knees buckled and he almost fell, but Harry caught him.</p><p>“Malfoy, for God’s sake…” he muttered, hauling the skinny boy back onto the bed. Draco hissed in discomfort when his bum hit the mattress, making Harry feel a bit bad. “Look, just…stay there, until you feel better…” he said with a sigh. Malfoy glared at him, but obeyed, pushing himself to lie on his side across the bed. “Where are your clothes?” Harry asked him, trying not to look at Malfoy’s arse.</p><p>“They…disintegrated…” Draco muttered, sounding vaguely annoyed. Harry frowned, and sighed, pulling off his own robes to drape over Malfoy. The blond looked at him, about to be offended by Harry’s pity, but seemed to check himself and accepted the sheltering, covering fabric, still warm from Harry’s skin. He sighed and lay down, his eyes closing by themselves before he forced them open.</p><p>“You can sleep if you want to…” Harry said, thinking Draco probably needed more sleep. Malfoy glared at him, defiance and mistrust in his colourless eyes. “I can leave if-” but to his surprise, Draco’s eyes widened before he seemed to be able to stop it, and he looked down.</p><p>“No, Potter…don’t go…” he said softly, blushing a very delicate pink. Harry faltered for a moment, surprised and delighted.</p><p>“Ok.” He said, and Malfoy glanced at him. Harry noticed again that he was trembling, despite the warm cloak over him and the fire-heated room. “Are you…feeling ok? You’re shaking…” Draco sighed, ignoring the question.</p><p>“If you’re so concerned, Potter…pass me that water jug and a glass.” He said, pointed to the table beside Harry. He obeyed, bringing the jug full of iced water and lemon, and a glass. He placed them both on the ornate bedside table, the top surface of which was inlaid with rose motifs. Draco sighed, and pushed himself to sit up slowly. His brow furrowed and his jaw tightened in apparent discomfort, but he was able to do it himself, though Harry was poised to help him if he asked. He settled himself back on the cushions, pulling Harry’s robe on the way it was designed so it covered him completely.</p><p>Harry saw Draco’s hand shakily reach for water jug and, doubting he’d be able to lift it right now, poured a glass out for him. He handed it over before Draco could protest, and Malfoy only gave him a small glare before sitting forward to sip the cool liquid, holding the glass in both hands.</p><p>He sighed once he’d swallowed, drinking the rest slightly more desperately. He put the glass back, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, and Harry could see him watching him out of the corner of his eye. Harry then realised he was standing over Draco somewhat ominously, and he moved away to sit on the end of the bed. He looked around the room, thinking it felt similar to the Gryffindor dorms.</p><p>He looked at Draco to see him doing the same, his hand absently touching the soft fabric of the quilt.</p><p>“Is in here as nice as the Slytherin dorms?” he asked. Draco looked a bit surprised by the question but sighed.</p><p>“They’re cold and dark.” He said simply, combing his ruffled hair back with his fingers, trying to retain some dignity, and looking almost his usual self. “Crabbe and Mott both snore like a dragon with a head cold…” he muttered, surprising Harry with his honesty.</p><p>“So does Ron.” He said with a chuckle, and looked up to see Draco looking at him, suspiciously. “What?” he asked.</p><p>“Why…are you here…? Why did you come in? You must have asked the room to open.” he asked, eyes narrowing slightly. Harry cleared his throat nervously and shrugged.</p><p>“I just…wanted to make sure you’re ok…” Draco frowned, still staring at him. Harry sighed, deciding Draco would prefer him to be honest. “I was…worried about you. I <em>am</em> worried about you.”</p><p>“Worried…?” he asked slowly, like the concept itself completely baffled him.</p><p>“Yeah…just, you know, seeing you…like this… Being mistreated…” Draco pushed himself up on one arm at that, angry, though his face paled a little at the movement.</p><p>“I wasn’t mistreated. Don’t you understand? I wanted this.” He said, but his eyes betrayed him. Harry looked at him a moment, then sighed.</p><p>“Your…your shoulder’s bleeding…” Harry said, almost like it made his point.</p><p>Draco faltered. He forced himself to sit up, drawing his long legs up and pulling Harry’s robes to cover himself. He moved a shaking hand to messily smear the small trickle making its way down his chest, coming from what could have been a bite mark, or a blade’s. He looked at the red on his hand, frowning at it. “Did you want that?” Harry asked him. Draco looked at him, then sighed, wiping the blood on Harry’s robe. He looked down, his expression sad. He seemed to think for a moment, then spoke.</p><p>“They gave me a potion…I don’t know what it was.” He said quietly. Harry was horrified by this, that Draco would allow himself to be given some mystery potion. “They often do – it makes me dizzy and tired…” Harry was about to express his profound distress at this practice but stopped. “I know it’s stupid, but I prefer it honestly…it makes it feel less real…”</p><p>“Draco…do they, um- they don’t force you, do they…?” Harry asked, terrified. Draco smirked coldly, though not with his usual arrogance, and shrugged.</p><p>“Not really…” he said vaguely. “My body needs it, but my mind would rather be elsewhere.” He said. If Draco saw Harry’s confusion, he ignored it, crossing his arms over his skinny chest casually. Harry swallowed thickly, wanting more answers from Draco while he was being so open.</p><p>“Why do you…um… When did you start…you know…um-”</p><p>“Sleeping around?” Draco asked, impatient with Potter’s stuttering. The blond sighed, resting his head back against the headboard, looking up at the bed’s canopy. “Last year.”</p><p>“Was that your first time?” Harry asked, surprised Malfoy was being so honest, but he assumed maybe it was a side effect of whatever those bastards had given him to make him so compliant. He felt guilty, taking advantage of him after he was clearly drugged, but what other chance would he get?</p><p>Draco shook his head, his steely eyes closing slowly. Harry thought he’d fallen asleep for a moment, then the space between the thin eyebrows creased.</p><p>“I was raped my first time.” He said finally. Harry stared at him, horrified.</p><p>“W…what…?” he asked, his blood running cold.</p><p>“When I was 15, over the summer before 5th year.” He said, turning his head to the side, away from Harry. He wasn’t crying, but his jaw was tight and his voice shaky and quiet. “Someone…someone came to the house and…” he stopped, then looked at Harry with those stormy eyes. There was pain in his eyes, more pain than Harry had ever seen, caged inside a body and mind that desperately denied it was there. “It was…V-…V-…” he looked frustrated for a moment, as if trying to say the name but couldn’t.</p><p>“No… Voldemort was your-…?” Harry wanted to cry, it was so awful. Someone so evil taking something so precious, and so young. Draco flinched at the name, involuntarily, and nodded stiffly, looking down.</p><p>“He came to our house and said…my father needed to do something to pay for his treachery. After the Chamber of Secrets…he was furious with my father. He wanted to kill him, make us lose everything, but…I suppose he wanted something else out of it. S-so…father asked him what he wanted. ‘Anything, my Lord’, he said.”</p><p>
  <em>“Anything?” the high, cruel voice asked, amused. Lucius Malfoy nodded from his position on the floor, the crackling fire behind making him look like he was burning along with the logs. The Dark Lord pretended to think for a moment, his long claw-like fingernails clacking loudly against the mahogany table was amplified in the silent room.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yes, my Lord, anything that is within my power to bestow!” Lucius promised pathetically, desperation in his eyes. He didn’t want to die. Voldemort smirked down at him, he did so love it when they groveled.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Very well. Draco, come here.” He hissed. Draco felt everything go cold, every happy thought ejected from his conscious, like there was a dementor right behind him, a second shadow. The Dark Lord hadn’t spoken to him at all when Lucius was introducing him, just glanced over him, unimpressed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He felt Narcissa jump beside him, her gasp loud before she thought to stop it. Lucius looked over at his son, his face blank with terror.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Voldemort’s gleaming red eyes turned to stare at Draco, and he shivered. A grin slowly crept over the snake-like face. “Draco. Come here.” He said again, his voice ripping through the room like a slashing blade, the flick of a snake's tongue. He wondered vaguely where Nagini had slithered off to; probably consuming one of the Manor's prized peacocks whole...</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco felt his mother’s hand grip his shoulder tightly, as if trying to stop him going, but he stepped forward, and her hand fell away like lace. He heard her begin to cry into her handkerchief, a rock forming in his stomach. He walked across the cold marble of his home’s sitting room, where he liked to sit for hours in one of the big cushiony armchairs to read.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His eyes were fixed on the Dark Lord, his heart pounding so loudly he was sure everyone could hear it. His father stood up slowly, his breathing shaking as he stared at his son.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco stopped just out of Voldemort’s reach, staring up at him, utterly terrified but trying to keep his face still, his Malfoy blood running cold. The Dark Lord towered over the 15-year-old, his waxy, scale-like skin luminous in the dimly lit room, the orange light from the fire making his red eyes burn as he grinned down at the boy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Come closer, Draco. Let me touch you.” He hissed, making Draco want to scream and run. He gulped, unable to blink as he looked up at him, and stepped forward. A long, bone-white hand extended from the sleeve of his black robes, the icy skin touching his own and making Draco’s breathing catch, resisting the overwhelming urge to move away from the chilling touch.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“M…my Lord…?” Lucius’ voice asked hesitantly, after what felt like hours of Voldemort staring at Draco, his cold skin turning his veins to ice.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Draco will be sufficient as repayment.” The high voice said finally, still grinning cruelly at the child before him. “I will come here once a month, while he is at home. During these times, he is mine, and we are not to be disturbed. I believe that is well within your 'power', Lucius…” he said, mockingly, his evil eyes never once leaving Draco’s terrified ones. The cold hand moved from Draco’s cheek to grip his bony shoulder tightly, moving to stand beside him. “Come, Draco, we can begin settling your father’s debt immediately…” he said, his fingers snaked down Draco’s spine to the small of his back, pushing him towards  door. Draco looked back with wide eyes. His parents stood in front of the fire, their shoulders hunched and heads down, Lucius staring back at him blankly while Narcissa sobbed bitterly into her handkerchief, refusing to touch her husband.</em>
</p><p>“He laughed when I screamed…and he liked it when I bled…” Draco muttered, shaking his head. Harry felt like he was listening to someone’s nightmare, he truly couldn’t imagine anything worse. Draco sighed, like he’d been complaining about a lot of homework, something trivial, except his breath shook. “Every time I have sex, I’m being raped…I never want to. It’s my body, it…it’s cursed or… I need to have sex, or I start to feel…awful, like I’m dying, like I’m on fire. But I never want to. These…people I meet here, I don’t <em>want</em> to have sex with any of them, but I have to, to make it stop.” He said, finally looking at Harry with wide eyes.</p><p>He wasn’t crying, but he wanted to, Harry could see that, plain as day. “He owns me…” he said softly, looking down. The moment the first tear fell, Harry darted forward and pulled Draco Malfoy into his arms to hug him. Draco didn’t even try to resist, crying into Harry’s shoulder. He was almost completely silent, his tears only apparent when Harry’s shirt became damp under his head. He hugged Draco tightly, rubbing his bony back through his own robes.</p><p>“It’s ok, Draco… He can’t touch you here, you’re safe…”</p><p>“I know he can’t…” Draco said softly, his voice small. “But he’s there w-when I go home…I hate the sight of it now, it makes me feel sick… My parents’ faces make me want to scream and…I-I can’t breathe in my own room, where I’ve slept since I was born…!” he sobbed the last part, his poor body shaking. Harry instinctively held him closer, moving him to sit across his own lap so he might feel safe, wrapping his arms around his nemesis protectively. Harry shushed him gently, murmuring reassuring words he didn’t believe. If Draco was under Voldemort’s control, the only way to stop it was to kill the Dark Lord.</p><p>They stayed there, like that, for a while. Harry had no idea how long until he realised Draco had fallen asleep. His head was on Harry’s shoulder, his body curled up in his lap, fingers still idly holding Harry’s shirt where they’d previously been clutching it for dear life. Harry’s heart swelled unexpectedly when he saw Draco’s face, slightly pink and blotchy around his sore eyes, but so serene… He’d never seen anyone look so relaxed, it was wonderful to see after so much pain and sadness that had been there before.</p><p>Harry very gently moved them both to lie down against the pillows, not wishing to wake Draco up, and couldn’t compel himself to sit up again and leave. Instead, he kicked off his own shoes, placed his glasses on the bedside table, pulled the quilt over the both of them, and closed his eyes.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry woke up very early in the morning, before Draco, feeling surprisingly refreshed and happy. He’d never really woken up beside anyone before, except Ron, and on one occasion when he and Dudley had been forced to share a bed...but never like this.</p><p>His arms were wrapped around Draco’s waist, their bodies close and warm. He would have been aroused if it hadn’t been for his knowledge of Draco’s sexual past, and how much pain it caused the Malfoy boy. Learning about what he’d been through with Voldemort, of <em>all</em> people, made Harry want to wrap his arms around Draco and never let go. He made a vow to the sleeping boy beside him, that when he finally did kill the Dark Lord, Draco would be one of the people he did it for.</p><p>It was a short while before Draco woke up. The silver eyes opened slowly, blinking himself awake after a little stretch and experimental snuggle into Harry’s warmth. His vision focussed on Harry, and his face went from sleepy, to confused, to horrified in about 3 seconds. He jerked away from Harry, looking around frantically, drawing himself up and away from him.</p><p>“P-Potter?! What- Where- Why are you-…!” he trailed off, completely baffled. Harry sat up, clearly showing himself to be fully dressed, and put on his glasses.</p><p>“Calm down, Malfoy. Do you remember anything?” he asked steadily, rubbing his eyes of sleep. “You <em>were</em> quite high, to be honest…” Draco glared at him for a moment, slowly realising that all he was wearing was Gryffindor robes and where he was. His expression cleared slightly as he began to recall the events, but still looked at Harry with suspicion.</p><p>“I remember…why I was in here… You…came in and…and we talked…?” he asked slowly, looking at Harry as if begging for confirmation, either that all they had done was talk, or that he hadn’t said anything incriminating in his drugged state.</p><p>“We did talk, yeah. You told me some...disturbing stuff… You cried until you fell asleep and…I suppose I didn’t want to, you know, leave…” he told him honestly. “I ended up falling asleep too…and here we are.” Draco seemed to be having a personal battle in his own head, frowning slightly at Harry, then he sighed deeply.</p><p>“I haven’t slept that well in a long time…” he admitted softly. Harry grinned.</p><p>“Me neither actually. Lucky neither of us snore, I suppose.” He said. Draco smirked despite himself, and glanced at him.</p><p>“Thank you, Potter… Usually after I come here…I leave alone and it’s cold and…- Thanks…” he finished, apparently both impatient and shy with his words. Harry smiled, and checked his watch.</p><p>“Well, it’s only 5 o’clock…we could sleep a bit more…” Draco looked at him for a moment, possibly tempted, then shook his head.</p><p>“I want to get back, so no one asks questions…” he said, shifting towards the edge of the bed. Harry nodded his agreement, though he knew his own friends no longer questioned him when he was inexplicably absent. He watched Draco gingerly push himself off the bed and stand up, using the bed post for support. He seemed much stronger than he had the night before, the sleep erasing the potion’s effects and healing his body. “I…I don’t have any clothes…” he said, looking down at Harry’s robes and his own bare feet. They’d even destroyed his shoes, laughing about how his daddy would just buy him a nicer pair.</p><p>“Oh, right… You can wear my robes for now, I’ll walk you back under my invisibility cloak.” Harry said. Draco turned to look at him, and nodded, looking down before turning away. Harry sighed, yawned, and moved to sit on the edge of the bed to put his shoes back on. Thinking about it, he pulled his socks off and held them out to Draco. “Put these on, your feet must be freezing.” He said imperiously. Draco looked at the socks, his nose wrinkling with mild disgust, but took them and pulled them onto his obviously cold feet. Harry smirked and put his shoes on his bare feet, strangely reminded of the day he set Dobby free from the Malfoy family.</p><p>He stood up, grabbing his invisibility cloak from where he’d left it over the back of the sofa. Draco followed him to where the door had appeared in the previously blank wall and they both got under Harry’s cloak, heading down to the Slytherin dungeons. They didn’t speak, sneaking through the corridors and down the stairs. They had to stay close together under the cloak to make sure it covered them both fully. Harry could hear Draco’s teeth chattering in the silence of the corridor, and resisted a strange urge to put his arm around him.</p><p>They finally arrived at the Slytherin common room, Draco having whispered ‘agoraphobia’ to a blank wall in the dungeons, which then dissolved to reveal the passageway. They went in and Draco quickly grabbed a discarded Slytherin robe from a chair.</p><p>“Close your eyes.” He hissed at Harry, who obeyed mostly. He caught a glimpse of a pale, bony shoulder and the profile of a hard little nipple as Draco swapped Harry’s robe for this one. The robe, and his socks, were then placed into Harry’s hands, and Draco told him to leave before ducking out from under the cloak.</p><p>“Ok, night.” Harry said without really thinking. Draco glared in the vague direction of Harry’s invisible form, and marched off to his dormitory, wearing a huge robe, and barefooted. Harry smirked, and went back up to his own bed in Gryffindor tower.</p>
