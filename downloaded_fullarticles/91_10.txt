    <h1>1: Unwelcome Welcome</h1>
<p align="center">
  <em>Return is not a way of going forward after all,<br/>nor a way of turning back.<br/>In any case, it seems a matter of opinion how you face it -<br/>the changing bed and the changing voices<br/>around a different room may all testify to movement<br/>that is either entry or exit into the next phase.<br/>It is the motion that takes you in, and it is only memory<br/>that lets you out again.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Or, as this love will let me say;<br/>the body travels faster than the keeping heart will turn away.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">-June Jordan, Roman Poem Number Nine</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Harry glanced out the window of his room at twelve Grimmauld Place as he dumped his bags on his bed. He was dead tired. He and Ginny had been traveling all day, which generally wouldn't be something he'd find disagreeable, except for the fact that coming home from the Abbey had proven a tad more complicated than <em>going</em> to the Abbey.</p>
<p>Because there had been reports of Death Eaters being seen in and around Dublin, Dumbledore had ordered that they be taken home in the most displeasing way possible.  Actually, Harry was pretty certain Dumbledore had said 'the most secure,' which meant switching cars twice, getting on a boat only to sneak off and get on the right one, and then changing train cars multiple times. Not to mention the continued presence of Kingsley Shacklebolt, Tonks, and Remus Lupin everywhere they turned. They also had in tow their own human Irish souvenir - Brogan Caley.</p>
<p>Basically, all Harry wanted to do right now was to sit down on his bed and be by himself. Well, maybe he would include Ginny in that idyllic state as well. But, it was not to be; it was evening time, and Harry knew that soon the whole house would be stopping by for the <em>Welcome Home</em> dinner Mrs Weasley was no doubt throwing for them. He'd only escaped to his room now because Hermione and Ron were still at the Ministry, finishing their Apparation tests.</p>
<p>He started half-heartedly unpacking, and a knock on his door interrupted him. He growled and answered it with what he was sure was a dirty look.</p>
<p>"Nice, Harry. Maybe I should just take this pumpkin juice and go elsewhere."</p>
<p>Harry smiled and pulled Ginny into the room before she could react. He shut the door securely behind her.</p>
<p>"I know I just spent all day with you, but is it okay that I say you're a sight for sore eyes?" he said softly, taking the pitcher and glasses she'd brought out of her hands and placing them on the desk.</p>
<p>Ginny's eyes sparkled as she giggled. "No, I think I know what you mean. Come here."</p>
<p>They kissed for the first time since they'd left their rooms that morning, and Harry realized how much he'd missed the taste of her. Ginny's hand lingered on his chest as he moved closer to her, backing her into the door. She sighed as he pulled back and startled nuzzling along the side of her neck, and he felt her tugging at his shirt.</p>
<p>"Honestly, Harry, shouldn't you be getting undressed and ready for dinner?"</p>
<p>"Honestly, Ginny, shouldn't you just shut it and be the one undressing me?"</p>
<p>Ginny laughed, and she shook her head at him, her eyes amused.</p>
<p>"We can't, you know."</p>
<p>"I know," Harry sighed and used his hands to move her head to the side, letting his fingers get tangled in her hair. He just wanted to snog his girlfriend. Was that a crime?</p>
<p>"And my Mum will be up in a minute. She wants all of your dirty laundry to wash before we pack up for school. She won't like this closed door."</p>
<p>Harry ignored common sense for the moment and breathed in the deep scent of her, his mouth moving closer to her ear. He felt her shudder slightly, and then her hands push gently against his chest. He sighed and pulled away.</p>
<p>"Fine. I'm probably too tired to do anything anyway," Harry said, smirking. Ginny raised her eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Traveling wear you out that much?"</p>
<p>"No, not the actual doing of it. It's the waiting, worrying and sitting about, and talking to everyone except you that does it."</p>
<p>"I'm honored I queue up so high, then, and don't add to the pain," Ginny said, smiling. She moved away from him and started pouring them each a glass of pumpkin juice. She handed one to him and then glanced at the bed. Ginny clucked her tongue at his apparent lack of his enthusiasm for unpacking.</p>
<p>"Harry, Harry...." she reached into her jeans pocket and pulled out her wand, flicking it over his items. He smiled as his clean clothes and other things put themselves away.</p>
<p>"You do that better than Tonks," he said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I reckon it's the Weasley gene handed down from mother to daughter since time immemorial - perfect Un-Packing Spells."</p>
<p>A noise at the door made them both turn, and Harry guiltily ran his hand through his hair even though they'd been doing nothing to get caught at. A moment later, Mrs Weasley came in, her face relaxing as she saw them standing with glasses in their hands.</p>
<p>"Ah, Harry, all unpacked, I see? Are these your dirty clothes and whatnot? Give them to me; I'll make certain they get cleaned up. Ginny dear, that nice Brogan boy is sitting down in the parlor with no one to talk to; perhaps you and Harry could give him a tour of the house?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, Mum," Ginny said demurely, glancing at Harry, who nodded. He reckoned Mrs Weasley probably assumed Brogan would keep them in line or something.</p>
<p>"Er, Mrs Weasley, when are Hermione and Ron due back?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"Soon, dear. I think they were stopping off with Arthur to visit George and Fred, to let them know you two were back. We're going to be having a full house for dinner tonight!"</p>
<p>Harry and Ginny followed her out of the room and down the stairs, taking their pumpkin juice with them. She left them at the foot of the stairs, muttering something about whether or not she had enough potatoes. Ginny opened the door to the parlor and nodded at Harry.</p>
<p>Brogan was indeed in the room, but he didn't exactly look bored. Tonks seemed to be amusing him a great deal.</p>
<p>"That is one of the most incredible things I have ever seen!" he was saying as Tonks did one of her changes for him.</p>
<p>"Oh, stop it, you'll turn my head," Tonks said in what Harry thought was definitely a flirtatious voice. In fact, she didn't sound like herself at all. He watched as she turned as pink as the hair she'd sprouted on her head.</p>
<p>"No, honestly, do you know how rare you are? It's brilliant. You're like the Transfiguration student's grand prize. You're what we <em>all</em> wish we could be."</p>
<p>They looked up as Harry and Ginny joined them, and Tonks suddenly seemed very interested in leaving the room. Harry and Ginny watched her go and then glanced at each other. Ginny chuckled as she conjured a glass for Brogan.</p>
<p>"Brogan Caley, so dead sexy, he makes even the most practical women lose their senses," she teased. Harry laughed as Brogan also turned pink in the face.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I can't wait to see how Hermione reacts to him...that'll be the real test," Harry added warming to the subject. "Although I don't think Ron will look at her reaction in quite the same way. You can handle yourself in a fight, right, Brogan?” Harry said, biting his lip to keep from laughing at the other man’s expression.</p>
<p>“Oh, Harry,” Ginny said, shaking her head. “Ron’s not that bad, although he is a fair bit taller than you, Brogan. But you’re probably quite spry, right?”</p>
<p>"Stop it, you two. <em>Really</em>," Brogan said earnestly, looking uncomfortable. And just a tiny bit worried.</p>
<p>Harry and Ginny shared a look and then both laughed out loud.</p>
<p>“I reckon we should stop taking the mickey out of him,” Ginny said, still chuckling.</p>
<p>Harry smiled at Brogan to let him know they were’t being serious. "Well, honestly, mate...I mean...you have to sort of <em>know</em> your effect on women...I mean, don't you?" Harry said after the other man seemed to relax at their teasing.</p>
<p>Brogan shook his head. “It has never done me a lick of good, Harry, trust me. I am clueless.”</p>
<p>"Oh, you’re not that bad, surely, Brogan.” Ginny said. “And anyway, Harry, why should he know his effect? You certainly don't," Ginny said, an impish smile on her face.</p>
<p>"I don't have an effect on women! Please." Harry said, rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, right...." Ginny said, indignant. When she saw the horrified expression on his face, she laughed. "Don't worry, Harry. I don't think you're a prat or anything. I like the fact that you don't know how sexy you are. Otherwise, I'd have far bigger problems with keeping you in line."</p>
<p>Harry shook his head at her and glanced at Brogan, who was watching them both, looking amused.</p>
<p>"And I don't think you're a prat either, Brogan," Ginny said comfortably as she joined him on the sofa. "Or should I start calling you Professor Caley now?"</p>
<p>Brogan shook his head, turning to look at her. Harry liked Brogan a lot more now than he had before, but that didn't mean he was daft. He sat down in between them.</p>
<p>"No, you shouldn't," Brogan said as he scooted over. "Well, at least...not yet. I still haven't become used to the idea myself."</p>
<p>"Well, don't worry, you'll always be Brogan to us," Harry said amiably.</p>
<p>Just then, they heard a commotion from the front room and the sound of feet moving fast up the stairs. A second later, they listened to an irritated Ron calling out, "Hermione! They're probably down here in the parlor!"</p>
<p>Ron stuck his head through the door, and a broad smile filled his face. "Harry! Ginny!" He ducked his head out of the door and yelled towards the stairway. "LIKE I SAID...THEY'RE IN THE PARLOR!"</p>
<p>He came back in, and they all stood up. Ron went to Ginny and embraced her, pulling her into a hug. It was probably one of the few times Harry had seen Ron be so demonstrative with her. It should have prepared him for the giant-sized hug that came his way next; Ron practically lifted him off the ground with his arms.</p>
<p>"Er...uh...Ron?" Harry managed to get out before Ron put him down again. Ron's ears turned red, and he seemed deeply embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Sorry, mate...er...missed you two, that's all," Ron said with a nod of his head. Ginny laughed at them.</p>
<p>Before they could introduce Brogan to Ron, Hermione...or at least, what Harry thought was Hermione, came dashing into the room - a bundle of bushy hair and black robes trailing after her.</p>
<p>"Ginny! Harry!"</p>
<p>Harry barely had time to open his arms before she was throwing her own around him. She squeezed him hard, and Harry had to wonder what had got into the two of them. He and Ginny had only been gone a month.</p>
<p>Hermione pulled away and laughed as she and Ginny hugged next. Harry glanced at Ron.</p>
<p>"Er, is there something else going on? I mean, is someone dying that I don't know about? You two seem very...."</p>
<p>"We're just pleased to see you!" Hermione said as she released Ginny. "It's been so...well, lonely, really. I've been stuck with <em>that</em> to entertain me," she said as she nodded her head at Ron, although not unkindly. Ron, however, rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>"Yeah, and I've just been terrible company, I'm certain," he turned to Harry. "She's had me reading about bleeding house-elves all month long."</p>
<p>Before Hermione could get started at replying, Ginny took her hand and then nodded at Brogan, who had moved out of the way of the reunion. "Hermione, Ron...I want you to meet a friend we made at the Abbey. His name is Brogan Caley."</p>
<p>Brogan smiled a bit shyly at them, but he shook Ron's hand <em>and</em> Hermione's, which seemed to impress her. She studied him unabashedly for a few moments, and Harry had to resist an urge to laugh out loud.</p>
<p>"Brogan's going to Hogwarts with us," Harry said by way of explanation. He didn't know if Brogan wanted people knowing he was going to be their Professor.</p>
<p>"Oh? What for?" Ron said bluntly, and Harry chuckled to himself, remembering his own reaction the first time he'd met Brogan.</p>
<p>"Ron, don't be rude," Hermione said absentmindedly. She smiled widely at Brogan. "Well, you can't be a student; you look older than seventeen! Are you going to be helping Harry with something? Professor Dumbledore?"</p>
<p>"Er, you could say that," Brogan said discreetly.</p>
<p>"Brogan here is a master at Transfiguration, Hermione. He's been privately taught his whole life, practically!" Ginny said, biting her lip. Harry could tell she too, was finding this humorous.</p>
<p>"Oh! Well, you'll have to sit next to me at dinner so I can talk to you about that; I've been fancying doing something with Transfiguration -"</p>
<p>"You said you wanted to do something about elves!" Ron interrupted.</p>
<p>Hermione sighed. "I don't have to do just <em>one </em>thing, Ron. Professor McGonagall told me that someone with my OWL results could go into any number of fields, why can't I do more than one?"</p>
<p>"Because you're a human being...not some sort of mad-Muggle machine that never sleeps," Ron said disagreeably.</p>
<p>Hermione decided to ignore him and continued chatting to Brogan, while Ron glared. Harry and Ginny sat down on the sofa, watching them. She turned to him and smiled.</p>
<p>"Hard to believe it's been a month since <em>this</em>," she said, nodding her head toward her brother.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Harry said chuckling. "Although I reckon this proves Brogan's appeal is universal."</p>
<p>"We should get him a girl," Ginny said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"All the good ones are taken," Harry said, his voice lowering.</p>
<p>Ginny smiled widely and put her hand into his. "That they are," she said lightly. She shook her head. "Reckon I should rescue him from Ron and Hermione having another row? He doesn't understand that's their foreplay."</p>
<p>Harry watched as Brogan helplessly nodded at Hermione while nervously glancing at Ron, who was narrowing his eyes. Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"Please do. I don't want our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher to be broken before he even gets to the school."</p>
<p>Ginny laughed and stood up, diplomatically coming between everyone. Harry shook his head. Although he knew he had a tough year ahead of him, he couldn't help but think that at least it wouldn't be without its bright spots.</p>
<p align="center">o-o-o-o-o-o</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>As dinner progressed, all Ginny wanted to do was to sneak upstairs and slip into Harry's bed. But she realized with every passing hour that was probably not going to happen. While her parents were seemingly their usual selves towards Harry, Bill and even Charlie, to a lesser extent, seemed determined to glare at him all night. If it wasn't for the continued amusement of Ron glaring at Brogan and Hermione as they talked about Transfiguration, and Fred and George teasing him ceaselessly about Hermione's new 'passion,' she may not have laughed at all. She felt too tense.</p>
<p>She met Harry's eyes across the table and nodded, knowing he was probably feeling the same way. They'd both decided to approach her parents tonight after everyone had finally left. They didn't expect her parents to allow them to stay in the same room together, but she knew Harry really wanted them to know precisely where they stood. For some reason, it was making her stomach do little flip-flops.</p>
<p>"Ginny, dear...are you feeling all right? You've barely touched your - George! Stop that!"</p>
<p>Her mum smacked her brother's arm as he was about to send a piece of bread with the words 'Hermione and Brogan' in bright orange letters emblazoned on it down to Ron's side of the table.</p>
<p>Ginny watched her family, very happy to be home, but already she missed the quiet solitude of the Abbey. Well, she missed the private feel of the Abbey. She realized with a start that tomorrow would probably be the first morning in a month she and Harry would spend not waking up in each other's arms. It was a thoroughly depressing thought.</p>
<p>"Harry, I picked up some things for you in Diagon Alley, but I am afraid you'll have to stop in there for your books. Your new list for Hogwarts only came the other day. Dumbledore has arranged for you to go shopping tomorrow afternoon," her mum was saying.</p>
<p>"Oh, good!" Hermione exclaimed, tearing herself away from her discussion about animal transfigurations. "I have a few things I forgot to get myself; will we be able to go as well, Mrs Weasley?"</p>
<p>Ginny watched as her mum nodded her head, not answering directly. Hermione frowned slightly and glanced at Ron. Ginny wondered then if things around the house had been worse off then Hermione had let on. She'd written and explained that Ginny's parents had finally stopped yelling at them for getting caught, but she hadn't really said if things were back to normal between them all.</p>
<p><em>This doesn't bode well for the 'mature' talk Harry wants to have</em>, Ginny thought to herself. <em>Maybe I can talk him out of it?</em></p>
<p>The end of dinner came much too quickly, and soon people were leaving - Tonks and Remus promising to come by at lunchtime to pick everyone up. Fred and George had business to finish up at the shop, and Charlie mentioned something about doing work for the Order. Ginny saw him speak with Bill for a few minutes before throwing her a guarded look. She wondered what they were up to.</p>
<p>"Er, Mr and Mrs Weasley? I was wondering if perhaps, Ginny and I could have a talk with you in private?"</p>
<p>Ginny almost smiled at the brave expression she saw on Harry's face. She saw a look pass between her parents and was surprised to see her father show a bit of annoyance. When he turned to face Harry, though, his nature seemed reasonable again.</p>
<p>"Of course, Harry. In the library, perhaps?"</p>
<p>"Do you mind if I join you four?" Bill asked, turning to Harry.</p>
<p>Harry paused and then looked at her, shrugging his shoulders slightly. Ginny shook her head. "Actually, I mind, Bill. This is just between us."</p>
<p>Bill's eyes hardened for a moment as he looked at her, but then he tilted his head towards her. "Fine, Ginny. I'll try to catch you up tomorrow before you leave for Diagon Alley." He turned and headed out of the kitchen. She went to Harry and took hold of his hand, needing the reassurance for some reason.</p>
<p>"Right then," her father said delicately. "Ron, Hermione, you'll make certain that Brogan has everything in his room? We thought we'd put him next to you, Harry...if that's okay?"</p>
<p>Harry startled and then looked at Brogan. "Er...certainly."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Harry, I'm as quiet as a mouse. Besides, you can always do a quick Silencing Spell," Brogan said good-naturedly. For some reason, his statement was met with a loud silence. Ginny caught a look passing between her parents, and Ron and Hermione.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she asked, and Ron gave her an embarrassed look. Hermione apparently found her own shoes more fascinating than the current discussion.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid Silencing Spells have been prohibited here at number twelve, Grimmauld Place. If you attempt to do one, you'll find that your spell will have the absolute opposite effect," her father said, his face turning slightly pink. "Our good friend Alastor Moody helped us out with a handy Detection Charm," he said to Brogan.</p>
<p>"But a Detection Charm only lets you know when -" Harry started, but her father interrupted him.</p>
<p>"Yes, Harry. The idea of reversing the effect - causing great volume to be placed on whatever it was the people casting the spell were doing, was Molly's idea."</p>
<p>They all turned to look at her mother, who Ginny was mortified to see smiling rather puckishly at all of them. She then realized with a deadening feeling in her stomach exactly <em>who</em> George and Fred (and maybe even herself), had received all of their deviousness from. She squeezed Harry's hand, and he looked at her, the same feeling reflected in his eyes. They were definitely <em>not</em> going to have a good time of it.</p>
<p align="center">o-o-o-o-o-o</p>
<p>"Yes, well, what would you two like to discuss?" her father asked them as they settled into the sofa. Her parents moved two big chairs in front of them, and they were now all facing each other. Ginny wondered if this is what it felt like to be in front of a Hit Wizard Squad. Her father used his wand to light a fire in the fireplace.</p>
<p>"Er, well, you see...Sir...." Harry started, his voice suddenly sounding hoarse. Ginny held his hand for moral support. She saw him take long, deep breaths and thought his skin was looking extremely pale.</p>
<p>"I reckon...well...Professor Dumbledore explained a few things to us, about the Prophecy regarding Ginny, and how you knew that -"</p>
<p>"What Harry is trying to say, Dad...Mum...is <em>we</em> know that <em>you</em> know that...."</p>
<p>"I love your daughter, very much," Harry said, retaking charge of the conversation, glancing at her. "Very, very much. We thought...<em>I </em>thought you should know that I won't ever willingly do anything to hurt her. This isn't a fleeting thing."</p>
<p>"I'm very happy," Ginny continued, meeting her parents' eyes. "I love Harry. I know you think I'm too young, but...it doesn't matter to me. I will continue to love him, and I expect to be allowed to show that love."</p>
<p>Her parents exchanged a look, and then her mother shook her head. "You are not yet seventeen, Ginevra. I think your father and I both have something to say in regards to what you think you should be allowed."</p>
<p>"Mum -"</p>
<p>"No," Molly said, her voice quite determined. "I raised you to be a clever and strong witch; I did not raise you to disrespect the wishes of your parents. Unless Harry here is prepared to marry you and take you from our guardianship, you are going to act like the daughter I raised you to be. You will not be a scarlet woman, do you understand me?"</p>
<p>"Molly, dear -"</p>
<p>"Mum!"</p>
<p>"Mrs Weasley -"</p>
<p>Their voices all started at once, and Ginny saw her mother's mouth set grimly, and she knew they were done for. She knew that look; it was the Weasley look of 'No Further Discussion'.</p>
<p>Her mother stood up and looked at them, silencing them with a wave of her hand. "Now, if you don't mind, I have a kitchen full of dishes to clean. I expect the two of you to go to bed...in your <em>respective</em> beds, no less, and you had better hope I don't catch you doing what your brother was doing, Ginevra Weasley, or you'll wish you'd never even met Harry Potter. No offense, Harry dear, of course."</p>
<p>She turned to leave, her mind clearly settled, and she probably would have made it too, Ginny thought, if Harry hadn't decided at that moment to open his mouth.</p>
<p>"What if I tell you that I do want to marry her?"</p>
<p>Ginny turned quickly to look at him, but he was staring at the retreating back of her mother.</p>
<p>Ginny watched her mother stop and then turn slowly around. She had a strange expression in her eyes as she came back to her chair. Ginny glanced at her Dad to see that he was also watching her mother.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, dear...what did you say?"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed visibly, his Adam's apple bobbing in a way that had to be painful. Ginny could only stare at him and wonder what in the blazes had come over him. <em>Marriage? Now? Was he mad?</em></p>
<p>"I...er...I said...." Harry seemed to falter now that everyone was looking at him. His eyes were wide and frightened; Ginny could only marvel at him. She squeezed his hand again and saw him look down. When he looked up and met her eyes, she saw the spark of determination and will that she loved so much about him fill his eyes. He looked at her parents again.</p>
<p>"I said, what if I tell you that I do want to marry her? What would you say? That is...what would it take for you to realize that I am serious about how much I love your daughter?"</p>
<p>Ginny saw her mother sit back down in the chair, her face pale. Her father removed his glasses and started cleaning them, a nervous gesture, Ginny knew. She felt like she should say something...anything...but she didn't know what.</p>
<p>"I would say that you are only seventeen years old -"</p>
<p>"Were we much older than they are, Molly?" Her father's voice was low and gentle - it was the voice Ginny sometimes heard him use when he wanted her mother to understand his meaning.</p>
<p>"Arthur! It is not the same thing! This is our baby -"</p>
<p>"You're right, it's not the same thing," Harry said calmly, his apparent nervousness leaving him. "Because I am not Mr Weasley, and Ginny is not you, Mrs Weasley. We're two completely different people and have had two completely different experiences growing up."</p>
<p>"Ginny is only sixteen! Harry, you are a bright boy, and I care for you, but if you think -"</p>
<p>"I don't want to marry her <em>now</em>," Harry said softly, and her mother closed her mouth. "But the intent is there. And will be there for as long as there is a breath in my body. I love her. And you two have been the only parents I have ever truly known, and it pains me that you are angry with me or disappointed for what has happened between Ginny and me - more than you will ever know. But it is not going to stop me from wanting to be with her."</p>
<p>Silence filled the room, and Ginny had to look away into the fire. Harry's words filled her head, and she felt as though she would actually break open from the amount of love she felt for him. She didn't know why she felt surprised - she knew Harry cared deeply for her...but to hear him say it so clearly, and in front of her parents...</p>
<p>"We knew this day would come, Molly," her father said softly as he put his glasses back on. Ginny turned her head and met his eyes. He smiled gently at her. "Yes, Ginny. We knew the Prophecy dictated that you would love Harry, but your mother and I also knew that he would one day come to realize what it is you are."</p>
<p>"What I am?" she asked, curious.</p>
<p>"Yes," her mother said, her voice strained. Ginny saw there were tears in her eyes. "You're our...well, we love all of you kids equally, of course, but I suppose, with you being the girl, and the baby...well, we just knew that one day Harry would finally realize how important you are just because you're you. You're so special, Ginny. I'm so proud of you - of the woman you've become. But you're still so young...too young...oh, <em>dear</em>."</p>
<p>Her mother started crying. Her father leaned over and comforted her. Ginny felt her heart pulled in a million different directions.</p>
<p>"Oh, <em>Mum</em>...Mum," Ginny said, getting up off the sofa and dropping down to the floor in front of her parent's feet. "You've never...well, I've never heard you say anything like that before. I know you love us, but...<em>Mum</em>. Stop crying, please. Be happy for me. Remember when I was ten, and I bothered you about Harry all the time? And you told me I needed to be my own person or he'd never like me for who I am? I didn't understand that until a few years later, Mum, but I always appreciated you telling me that. You didn't tell me I was silly or daft for liking Harry, you tried to get me to be a better person...a <em>whole </em>person. He loves me because some part of my brain thankfully listened and took your advice. And I love him. More than anything. And I'm not too young to know what love is - I've had you and Dad to show me that. Please don't cry, Mum. I want you to be happy for me - you helped me be so much more than what I was."</p>
<p>Ginny realized that now <em>she</em> was starting to cry         as well, and a moment later, she felt both of her parents embrace her. They pulled her to her feet, and she turned, holding her hand out to Harry. He hesitated and then took it, going into her embrace. She suddenly felt very silly for starting what had to look like a lousy group hug gone awry but didn't care.</p>
<p>A moment later, they all broke apart, but an understanding had somehow been reached. Her parents sat down again, and Harry wiped the tears that remained on her face away with his thumb.</p>
<p>It was such an intimate gesture that she heard her mum sniff loudly again. When she turned to look at her, though, her mother was smiling. Her father cleared his throat.</p>
<p>"Well, yes...good. I...er...well, Ginny, Harry...we understand how serious you two are about each other - we won't doubt that again. However...I cannot allow you to...well, not in this house, at any rate. Although technically, it probably belongs to you more than anyone, Harry... but I do wish that you honor this father's simple request."</p>
<p>"Of course, Mr Weasley. I wouldn't dream of...well...that is to say -"</p>
<p>Her father chuckled. "I know I don't own your dreams, Harry. And I know I can't change what has already happened." Her father's eyes twinkled briefly as he looked at her. Ginny felt another surge of guilt at what had already occurred between her and Harry while in the house.</p>
<p>"We'll try to be more...understanding of you two," her father continued saying. "But...to be fair, if we don't let Hermione and Ron get away with anything, we shouldn't let you two either, although I know we can scarcely hope to watch you two all of the time. But please...try to control yourselves."</p>
<p>"And please...Ginny...do be careful with things?" her mother added softly, and Ginny felt her skin heat. "You're both in love, yes, but you're both very young and have so much ahead of you. Just like your father and I did." Her mother sniffed loudly, and she watched her father offer her a handkerchief.</p>
<p>Ginny didn't want to add the idea that Harry might <em>not</em> have a lot of time ahead of him. Harry's hand slipped into hers again as though reading her thoughts, and she couldn't bring herself to let him see her eyes. She simply nodded her head at her mother, murmuring that she would be careful.</p>
<p>After more talking, and more hugs - mostly her mother trying to squeeze the life out of both of them, they bade her parents goodnight and headed up the stairs. The hallway was quiet, and she wondered if everyone was asleep or only waiting to hear their footsteps on the floor.</p>
<p>Harry pulled on her hand and led her to his door. They entered, and he closed it softly behind him. He smiled, and she went to him, kissing him gently. Harry moaned softly and moved his hands around her waist, pulling her closer to him.</p>
<p>"Sorry I sprung that on you down there," he said when she finally pulled her mouth away. She frowned.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"The whole 'marriage' thing. I'd been thinking it back at the Abbey...but...I reckon you were a bit frightened. I just wanted them to know how serious I am."</p>
<p>Ginny shook her head. "No, as far I am concerned we were bound the moment our bodies joined for the first time. Marriage just makes it...legal. So we can get married years from now, it doesn't matter."</p>
<p>"Years from now? You don't want to be known as Ginny Potter around Hogwarts?" Harry's eyes shone at her mischievously, and she shook her head.</p>
<p>"<em>No</em>. Merlin, can you imagine? What a cliché."</p>
<p>"It's not that bad a name...."</p>
<p>"Not the name, silly. The whole...married before I'm out of school thing. Honestly. Haven't you even read a romance book before?"</p>
<p>"Um, <em>no</em>, Ginny," Harry said, perplexed, as though he now thought he should have done so.</p>
<p>She giggled. "You're not missing much, but anyway...as I was saying before, I have to run off to bed...."</p>
<p>She kissed him again, and they soon forgot themselves, their hands having a life of their own. Ginny only came back down to her senses when she felt Harry's finger graze her nipple through her bra, her shirt already half-way off of her.</p>
<p>"Oh! This is going to be a very tough few days," she said, pushing him away slightly. He had a slightly glazed look in his eyes and nodded at her. "Remind me again how I existed before I knew what it felt like to fall asleep in your arms?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his head and smirked at her. "You existed very well, actually. Now go, before I decide to do something, I would hate to get interrupted doing."</p>
<p>She made sure her blouse was buttoned right again and then went to his door, turning around before she opened it.</p>
<p>"Goodnight, Harry."</p>
<p>He looked at her - eyes bright, clothes slightly disheveled from their embrace, his hair still mussed from her hands. She didn't think she'd ever seen anything as beautiful and as good as him. She felt something deep and hungry twist through her. Now that she couldn't have him, she couldn't seem to stop wanting him. It made her head spin.</p>
<p>"Goodnight, Ginny," he said softly. He moved forward as if he wanted to kiss her again, and she quickly turned the doorknob.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Harry, but if you touch me again, I will never get out of this room without breaking the promise we just made. And I love them too much to do that again."</p>
<p>She slipped out of his room and leaned against the door, her heart beating fast. <em>How am I ever going to get through a whole school year of sleeping in the dormitory, knowing that I can't have him whenever I want him?</em></p>
<p>Ginny didn't know if there were gods or goddesses or anything really, but right now, as she headed towards her own, lonely bed, she prayed for their guidance and their patience.</p>
<p align="center">o-o-o-o-o</p>
<p>Harry awoke late in the morning and quickly showered and dressed. He missed the bathroom they'd had at the Abbey, especially when the mirror in the loo told him to get a hair cut and 'stop looking so grubby.'</p>
<p>He stopped at Ginny and Hermione's door before heading downstairs, only to find that they had already gone to breakfast. Harry heard Ginny's laugh as he was halfway down the stairs, and he realized how much he missed waking up with her. It was amazing - go seventeen years of sleeping alone, and you didn't know the difference - spend one month waking up with someone, and suddenly you couldn't get the thought of them out of your head. <em>Love is a wonderful yet very peculiar thing</em>, he decided to himself.</p>
<p>But the scene that greeted him as he entered the kitchen was one that warmed him, and he realized that he'd been missing this as well - total Weasley Morning Bedlam. Apparently, he'd awoken very late, as most of the dishes were empty, and the table was a mess. Ginny, George, and Fred were all discussing something, looking very suspicious in their corner. Ron and Hermione had their heads bent together, and Brogan appeared to be writing something.</p>
<p>"Harry!" Ginny exclaimed, extracting herself from in between her brothers. She jumped up and embraced him, brushing her mouth quickly against his. He heard George and Fred making sucking noises behind her, which caused Ginny to turn her head and stick her tongue out at them. "Shut it, you two. Remember what I told you."</p>
<p>Harry blinked as Fred and George immediately stopped and went back to finishing what remained of their breakfast. Ginny led him over to the stove and handed him a plate.</p>
<p>"What did you tell them?" he asked, nodding to the twins. Ginny smiled.</p>
<p>"Something that is to remain a secret between the three of us, although should they ever need reminding of what I have over them, I've already explained you're the first I'm going to tell. Well, right after Mum and Dad, anyway. How did you sleep? I was about to send a plate up to your door."</p>
<p>"I slept...." Harry paused. Actually, he'd slept fine. It was the falling asleep and waking up alone part that had given him trouble. Ginny nodded her head, knowingly.</p>
<p>"I slept fine too. It was the waking up I didn't like. I'd forgotten how small and lonely that bed is."</p>
<p>Harry glanced around the room and noticed that no one was watching them. He reached out and pulled her closer to him, giving her more than just a brush on the lips. She pulled away and blinked happily at him.</p>
<p>"You know, I think I deserve more than that - I saved you all the best food!"</p>
<p>Harry looked down at the plate she'd put in his hand, only to see it filled with scrambled eggs and bacon rashers. He smirked at her.</p>
<p>"I'll thank you properly later."</p>
<p>"That you will, I have no doubt of, Harry. Now come on, let's bother Brogan, since these <em>two</em> were just leaving, right?" Ginny turned and looked at her brothers, her hands on her hips, giving a fair resemblance to Mrs Weasley. The twins nodded and smiled briefly at Harry before vacating their seats. Harry had to wonder precisely <em>what</em> Ginny had over them - they were practically docile.</p>
<p><em>Practically</em>, but not quite, as Harry soon discovered. They'd somehow managed to charm the salt and pepper shakers to behave as though they were kissing. Before Ginny could notice, Harry moved the shakers out of the way, tapping them with his wand. He didn't need a war to start over the salt getting too friendly with the pepper, now did he?</p>
<p align="center">o-o-o-o-o-o</p>
<p>"Well, this is certainly a new experience," Brogan was saying as they walked through the Leaky Cauldron. "I can't believe I'm actually going to be shopping in Diagon Alley!"</p>
<p>The others laughed, and Harry remembered his own first time through the alleyway that had led him into a whole other world. It seemed as though it was ages ago, but in reality, hadn't it just been six years?</p>
<p>"I can't believe you've never been," Ginny was saying, talking to Brogan. She looked lovely to Harry - she'd worn one of her new robes her mother had had to get for her since her old one had finally become too spare to fix anymore. She'd tied her hair back, slightly, letting it fall gently against her neck. He was overcome with an urge to release it from the bind she'd placed around it and run his fingers through it. He also noticed she'd worn the pin he'd given her, and it sparkled in the early afternoon sun as they entered the alleyway.</p>
<p>They were flanked on either side by Tonks and Professor Lupin; Bill and Charlie had opted to come along as well, and they were in front and back of them, respectively. Bill seemed subdued and ill-at-ease around them, and Harry remembered he had wanted to talk with them last night. He also knew he would have to do something about the elder Weasley; Harry couldn't stand the thought of himself being a rift between brother and sister. Especially when he knew Ginny had always looked up to her oldest brother.</p>
<p>Diagon Alley was more crowded then he remembered, even for term about to start. Ron, Hermione, and Brogan went ahead with Tonks and Bill; Professor Lupin and Charlie held them back as they waited for a break in the steady stream of people. Ginny slipped her hand into his, and he turned to smile at her but realized she was looking the other way, a frown on her face.</p>
<p>"Gin?"</p>
<p>She didn't respond at first, and he saw her eyes narrow. He tried to see what she was staring at, but he only saw the movement of heads as people went about their shopping.</p>
<p>"Hey, what's up?" he asked again, squeezing her hand. She shook her head, finally turning away.</p>
<p>"Nothing, I just thought I saw...well...it couldn't have been," she said dismissively. "Come on, let's get to Gringotts so you can withdraw a large sum of money and buy me something pretty."</p>
<p>Harry felt his eyes widened and then realized she was having a go at him. She smiled and batted her eyes at him.</p>
<p>"Only joking, Harry. You know I love you for reasons other than money, right?"</p>
<p>"Considering most of mine is always in the bank, and I never have any, I'd hope so," he said as Professor Lupin started leading them through the throng.</p>
<p>"Oh, Merlin, can you imagine if I did love people for their money, I'd...I'd...probably be enamored of....." Ginny's voice trailed off, and he turned to her. "Draco Malfoy," she snarled, and she tilted her head.</p>
<p>He looked at where she indicated, and naturally, there was the git in question. He was standing in a doorway, alone, which Harry immediately thought was odd. Draco turned, and their eyes met briefly. When he could see clearly again, Draco was gone. He turned to Ginny, and she was looking around as well.</p>
<p>"Where did he go?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know, one minute he was there and the next...he wasn't. It was like he wanted us to see him."</p>
<p>"Very odd," Ginny said. "Did you notice he was alone? Isn't that a Malfoy blunder, considering half the wizarding world knows his father is a Death Eater? Even at school, he usually has his goons with him."</p>
<p>When they caught up with the others, Harry tapped Professor Lupin on the shoulder and told him about seeing Draco.</p>
<p>"It's probably nothing," Professor Lupin said sagely. "But that doesn't mean we shouldn't keep our eyes open. If you two see him again, let one of us know immediately, okay?"</p>
<p>The rest of the group waited as Harry and Brogan walked up the steps to enter the bank. He didn't know how much money he would need for the coming year, so he reckoned his usual 'stick in his hand and grab a bunch of it' method would probably work.</p>
<p>"I think I have to see one of the Irish Goblin Liaisons for my money," Brogan said as they waited in the queue.</p>
<p>"Is Irish wizard money different than ours?" Harry asked, suddenly realizing he had no idea.</p>
<p>"No. It's the same. But...since I've never been to a London branch before, I think Professor Dumbledore said I would have to arrange for a vault here. Bit of a pain in the arse if you ask me."</p>
<p>When they reached the head Goblin, Brogan was proven correct, as he was pointed off to another table. Harry showed his key and was directed to wait for one of the carts to arrive. He was startled to realize that this was the first time he'd done the ride by himself.</p>
<p>With both his pockets filled with what was probably too much gold, he waited at the door for Brogan to come back. A few moments later he saw him, wind-swept from the ride on the cart.</p>
<p>"You know, the tales I've heard about that ride were not exaggerated," the other man said, looking a bit pale. "Merlin's beard, I think they do it on purpose, so you're too disoriented to know where you are or what you're doing."</p>
<p>Harry smiled. "I know a certain Care of Magical Creatures Professor who would agree with you."</p>
<p>They joined the others, where Ron and Hermione were apparently arguing to entertain everyone and soon headed out to shop. Brogan, who had the most to buy, went ahead of everyone, claiming since he was unknown (and therefore, probably not in any real danger of getting bothered), he could probably get it done quicker that way.</p>
<p>Ginny read through her list, her voice disparaged. "Blast! So many bloody books. What are they trying to do to me? Kill me with reading?"</p>
<p>Harry laughed and looked over her shoulder. "Well, you can have my old Year Six book, and I have these three already as well."</p>
<p>"Yes, but that doesn't keep me from having to actually <em>read</em> them," she said darkly. "I have better things to do with my time than revise."</p>
<p>"Oh, really?" Harry said, raising his eyebrow. He was happy to see her skin turn slightly pink. He laughed. "You didn't have any problem reading during the summer. Well...as soon as you set your mind to it, anyway."</p>
<p>"That was different. This is...<em>school</em>," Ginny said grumpily, sounding very much like Ron.</p>
<p>As if hearing her cue, Hermione turned and squeezed Ginny's arm. "Oh, Ginny...aren't you excited? All the more in-depth classes you get to take. Your OWL results were exemplary."</p>
<p>Ginny nodded, and Harry saw her eyes glaze over slightly as Hermione started suggesting additional books she might like to read. Harry looked at Ron, who had been unnaturally quiet all morning.</p>
<p>"Hey, anything wrong, mate?" he asked him as they headed for Flourish and Blotts.</p>
<p>Ron started and blinked at him as if he wasn't seeing him. "What? Er. No. Just...preoccupied about something, I reckon." He nodded his head towards Hermione and Ginny. "She looks happy, Harry. The month away did her good. It did you good, too."</p>
<p>Harry looked at Ginny and nodded. "It was like we were in our own world," he admitted. He glanced at Ron. "Sorry, we left you two to fend for yourselves with er...everything."</p>
<p>Ron's ears turned pink, and he looked around. "Yeah. I don't know, we had an okay time of it before we...well, you know. After that, it was like...I don't think I've ever seen Mum so mad, but honestly, it was Dad I felt like I had hurt. He just...looked as though I had...let him down somehow. That was a worse punishment than cleaning the whole house from top to bottom. Which Mum made us do twice, by the way. Now Hermione and I don't...well, we don't do anything even remotely romantic. I think Mum's attitude towards her is really hurting Hermione's feelings."</p>
<p>Harry didn't say anything, unprepared for the openness and pain he saw in his friend's eyes. He and Ron had been through so much together. And yet they'd never really talked about things like this before.</p>
<p>"So, that's why you and Hermione are fighting so much, then?" he asked tentatively.</p>
<p>Ron looked into the Quality Quidditch Supplies store as they passed and nodded. "Yeah. I reckon so. Or maybe Hermione is just blaming me for allowing it to happen. Not that she would actually say that, of course. She took the blame as much as I did. But I think it's different for girls. And I think she cares a great deal about what Mum and Dad think of her now. It's always been a sore spot with her since Mum thought that article Rita Skeeter wrote was true back in fourth year."</p>
<p>Ron shrugged and didn't look him in the eye, belying his apparent nonchalant mood.</p>
<p>"I think your Mum and Dad are more understanding then you think," Harry offered, not sure of what he should say.</p>
<p>"Well, they're more understanding about you and Ginny, that's for bloody certain." Ron's voice wasn't bitter exactly, but Harry could also tell he wasn't joking either.</p>
<p>"Ron -"</p>
<p>"It's okay, Harry. All right? So Hermione and I get yelled at for doing basically what you and Ginny were allowed to do to your heart's content. It's just...life, that's all, I reckon. Like I said, my sister's happy. I'm not a complete dunderhead, you know. I know it's because of you, and that's...well, that's fantastic, really. You two deserve to be happy. And I like seeing you with a smile on your face instead of a bloody scowl," Ron paused, his voice earnest. "I just wish Mum and Dad would let the rest of us have some breathing room about it. You and Ginny aren't the only ones in love. You're not the only ones who are serious."</p>
<p>Harry was saved from a reply by them reaching the door to the shop. Hermione turned, and Ron went to her. Harry watched them for a moment, suddenly at a loss. The three of them had changed so much and so quickly, that he realized they were really all their own people now. He was sure that Ron and Hermione kept things to themselves just like any couple would be expected to. Maybe he hadn't realized what that meant exactly until he'd fallen in love with Ginny. He went to his own better half and rested his hand on her shoulder, causing her to turn around and smile.</p>
<p>"Whose list do we start on first? Mine or yours?" she asked, holding up the two pieces of paper.</p>
<p>"Yours, it's longer."</p>
<p>Ginny rolled her eyes. "Yeah, don't remind me. Hermione just added to it. You don't happen to have <em>One-thousand and One Ways to Charm Your Way Out of Any Situation</em>, do you?"</p>
<p>"If I did, don't you think I'd get into a lot less trouble?"</p>
<p>Ginny laughed. "Good point, Harry. All right then, I reckon let's start with the Transfiguration books first. You need one too."</p>
<p>They did their shopping surprisingly quick, considering how busy the store seemed. They managed to find both their lists of books with help from Tonks, who kept asking Ginny questions about Brogan. They met up with Ron and Hermione again in the queue to pay for everything. Hermione complained about getting a headache, surprisingly.</p>
<p>"But Hermione, isn't the bookstore your most favorite place to be?" Harry teased her. She shrugged and then tried to smile.</p>
<p>"I just don't like crowds. Is it just me, or are there a lot of people just...in the way today?"</p>
<p>Harry looked around. Now that she mentioned it, the store did seem to be busy without really being busy. It was as though there were people there who didn't really need to be there, standing about. But no one looked suspicious, so he couldn't really say there was anything wrong.</p>
<p>"Why don't we go get some ice cream after this then?" Ron asked, hopefully.</p>
<p>Everyone agreed that sounded like a good idea, and after paying for his books (he slipped two of Ginny's into his stack; any more than that and he knew she'd notice and yell at him), he told Professor Lupin and Charlie that they were heading to the ice cream parlor next.</p>
<p>They found a table for all of them to sit at minus one (Bill opted to walk around for a bit), and they soon tucked into Fortescue's latest creation - the 'Snozzleberry Extravaganza.' Ron had ordered a double, and Ginny hid a laugh against Harry's shoulder as they both noticed the rather large spot of purple cream he'd managed to get on his nose.</p>
<p>"We should go and visit Fred and George after this," Ginny suggested.</p>
<p>People nodded their approval, and Harry glanced at Hermione, seeing her push her barely touched sundae away from her, rather unenthusiastic about the whole thing.</p>
<p>"Hermione? Are you feeling all right?"</p>
<p>She gave him a half-smile. "Just my head still hurting. I think I might go and use the water closet, actually, and run some cold water on my face. Perhaps I'll stop in at the Apothecary and get something for my headache."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll come with you," Ginny said, rather unexpectedly in Harry's ear. She stood up and patted the top of Harry's hand. "Watch my ice cream, Harry. I don't want Ron getting any funny ideas."</p>
<p>Ron, who seemed to be finishing his double at an alarming rate, was oblivious to the girls leaving, and Harry promised he would do his best to keep her ice cream's honor in one piece. Harry watched them go, noting he could see Ginny's bright hair until they moved behind one of the shop entrances. He turned back to join the conversation Charlie and Tonks were having about Quidditch and didn't notice Percy Weasley slipping past their table, heading in the same direction as Hermione and Ginny.</p>
<p align="center">o-o-o-o-o</p>
<p>Author's Note: <em>And so begins part two. My words of wisdom at this point would be - just have patience. All will be revealed in due time. In the meantime, I'm having fun, and so are Harry and Ginny. It's so good to be back with Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George....*sigh*. Coming up next: Percy and a Malfoy. </em></p>
