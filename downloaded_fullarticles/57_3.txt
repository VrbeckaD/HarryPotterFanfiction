    <p>Percival sighed shifting the stack of lumber that was strapped against his back. Being a woodworker was a tiring profession but a profitable one, especially if one traveled between towns as he did. </p><p>Grunting he ran a hand over the small knot jutting out from the particular wood that had wedged just behind his hip.</p><p>“Little further” he reminded himself.</p><p>Just ahead of the path he could see the shine of lanterns being lit. Not wanting the sun to fully set on him he hurried along.</p><p> As always he received a few looks from the townsfolk. Paying them no mind he searched for an inn. Luck had smiled on him as this town did appear to have one. Many times when he couldn't afford a roof over his head or there wasn't an inn he'd have to provide his own lodgings. Times like that he was glad of his occupation. Wood was sturdy, reliable.</p><p><em> “But very heavy,” </em> he thought, shifting his shoulders once again as he approached a blond woman standing behind a table.</p><p>“Excuse me.”</p><p>Her eyes barely fluttered to him before she held out a key and began talking “Room top left there's a washtub available.  You could use a rest. Dinner will be served in a bit.” She smiled. “Just follow the thumping footsteps.”</p><p>Her eyes shot to a brunette woman standing in the corner of the stairs. The brunette seemed irritated with him or this blond woman he couldn’t quite tell.</p><p>“Yes,” The blond turned to face him once more. “The cost of course for the meal will be extra.”</p><p>“That is fine,” he said, pulling his small coin purse. He could use a wash and a decent meal wouldn't hurt to ease the ache from his long travel either.</p><p>Placing payment on the desk she didn't even give that a second glance. It worried him how distracted she appeared. It would be so easy for people to take advantage of her lack of concentration…</p><p>“Don't worry about me hun,” she dangled the key in front of his face. “You want to relax don't you?”</p><p>“Thank you,” he said, taking the key.</p><p>The room he found himself in was indeed worth the cost. It had a relatively big bed, space to lay his things and as the blond had said a tub to wash up laying against the furthest window along with a mirror.</p><p>There had been one village that had cost him nearly half his earnings just for a few nights of rest. Percival had made a huge X right over that specific town on his map soon after leaving. He didn’t want to even recall the name of that place. In his opinion it was a town full of conmen.</p><p>“Hopefully that’s not the case here as well.”</p><p>Carefully he removed the pile of wood from himself. Tilting his neck released the tension with a pop. Rotating his shoulders he approached the washtub. </p><p>Looking in the tarnished mirror he had to admit he had seen better days. But also worse.  His face was caked in sweat and dirt. In his beard there were a few leaves and wood chippings. The back of his hands were scratched up from the last trek of the journey. It was the price one paid to travel. </p><p>Watching the basin of water brown he scrubbed as much as possible. In all honesty, he didn’t care to look like a complete wild man. </p><p>Running a hand over his beard he thought to shave but the tension in his shoulders urged him to the bed instead.</p><p>“Beats the last one” he mused laying onto the not quite soft bed.</p><p>Stomping just outside drew him to his feet once more.</p><p>“She wasn't kidding” he chuckled to himself.</p><p>Descending the stairs he caught the eye of the blond woman standing at the dining table. “You may have a seat where you like,” she said, moving to pick up a pot.</p><p>Nodding he took up a seat next to a nervous twitching boy. No, boy wasn’t quite the right word Percival decided getting a closer look. This was a young man perhaps as old as seventeen, even so the young man’s demeanor did resemble more like a child of seven.  Even his dark hair seemed to be cut in an odd fashion. Perhaps it was self-done. </p><p>Catching the brunette woman’s eyes as she made her way over, he withheld asking the young man anything.</p><p>“He’s shy” the blond whispered as she ladled a helping of stew onto his dish.</p><p>“Tell me where are you from Mr....” the brunette asked sitting directly across from him.</p><p>“Graves,” he said, picking a fresh roll of bread from the center basket. “My name is Percival Graves. I come from here and there. I travel from town to town.”</p><p>The twitchy young man appeared horrified by his words. Those large dark eyes made him curious if this twitchy young man had ever stepped beyond home.</p><p><em> “Perhaps not,” </em> he thought.</p><p>Eyes shifting to the stairs he waited for someone else to join them but no one descended the stairs. In most of the other inns he had paid patronage to there had been a very boisterous man at the head of the establishment. This inn appeared to be run by these two women. </p><p><em> “And this young man...” </em> He glanced at him again. The young man didn’t look like either of these women. Although it seemed that there was some sort of relationship among them all. </p><p>“Doing what exactly?” The brunette asked, holding her knife in a way that made him somewhat nervous.</p><p>“Just about anything with wood. Sometimes I'm asked to repair cabins sometimes they just need firewood, other times  I carve things.”</p><p>The brunette seemed to think over something before she spoke. “As a traveler, you must know that not every town is alike.”</p><p>Not knowing exactly what she meant by that he nodded. </p><p>“There are a few rules here Mr. Graves. It's a rather small community so do not disrespect a single soul or you'll be out your way without any business.”</p><p>“I don't mean to cause problems Ms....”</p><p>“Goldstein. Tina Goldstein.” She tilted her head to the blond who nodded. Something about that let her relax ever so slightly.</p><p>“You may set up business here but it must be fair.” Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>“Most importantly never stray from the path in the woods.” </p><p>The twitchy young man jumped besides him.</p><p>“What-”</p><p>“Nothing to be concerned about” the blond insisted in a calm cooing voice that seemed to soothe the young man. The brunette, on the other hand, had to look that said ‘don’t say another word’.</p><p> </p><p>“What's in the woods?” he asked as he helped clear the table at the end of their meal. </p><p>“No one knows.” She whispered, running the dish under the water. “Those who have strayed off the path have gone missing.”</p><p>“Missing?”</p><p>“Keep your voice down,” she hissed.</p><p>“I'm sorry,” he said, looking over to the young man who hadn’t spoken a word all night wiping down the table.</p><p>“I don’t mean to worry your... son?” Neither woman looked the proper age to have a child as old as the twitchy young man.</p><p>Ms. Goldstien shook her head. “Took him in a few years back.  This town has seen a few travelers in its time.” </p><p>Percival couldn't imagine the shaken young man to brave the world. <em> “Unless he had experienced something. Something horrible that kept him here.” </em></p><p>“Do not ask him about it.” Ms. Goldstien warned.</p><p>“What-”</p><p> The small towel in her hand was forcefully thrown down. </p><p>“Not that it is any of your business Mr. Graves but Credence once saw something in those woods roaming just off the path. He won’t go near the roads. He had every right to be afraid. There had been at least one person we know for sure had drifted off the marked path and had not returned. Now don't you dare say another word about it to him.” Her eyes narrowed into a heated glare. “Understood?”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>Her face scrunched in disgust. “I hate being called that. Tina is just fine.” She huffed before moving to whisper something to Credence in the other room. </p><p>Listening to their feet move up the stairs, Percival finished placing the dishes away. </p><p>It was late. He too needed to head off to bed. In the morning there would be time to find out more about this town he had landed himself in.</p><p> </p><p>The sun was just about to rise, covering the once blue light in warmer shades of yellow. He'd been up watching what he could out of the small window looking out onto the town. There had already been movement of lanterns being lit and people pulling out wagons in preparation for the items they would sell once everyone else woke. Such a simple way of living, a way that many other towns he had visited went about as well. And yet there was something different here than anywhere else he had stepped foot into.  For now Percival wasn’t sure exactly what that was.</p><p>Laying out his map he added on this strange new town before lifting his stack of wood onto his back. </p><p>There was work to be done. The sooner he established business the better. </p><p>“You aren’t going out already are you?” the blond asked as he came down the stairs. </p><p>It was quite eerie how she was able to pick up on the things in his head. Though it wasn’t such an unusual concept of one possessing some unnatural power. Many -mostly haggard looking old women- claimed to be able to predict his future or sold odd jars filled with odder ingredients to anyone who would barter for cure-alls that reeked.</p><p>
  <em> “Perhaps this woman was one of the sort.” </em>
</p><p>Her lips pursed as her blue eyes fell to him. “Breakfast?”</p><p>“I must work” he insisted knowing full well that the little coin he possessed wouldn’t cover him forever. </p><p>“How about this,” she said with a small smile. “A barter for the meals during your stay.” </p><p>“Your sister would be alright with such a thing?” Tina Goldstein surely seemed the sterner of the two. It hardly seemed a fair trade to provide firewood in exchange for delicious meals. Everyone knew that coin was steadily becoming more sought after.</p><p>“It is fair. And my name is Queenie” she said holding out a plate with a small bun and an egg. Despite the food from last night his stomach growled knowing that even something that simple would taste delicious.</p><p>Taking the plate he bit into the bread so fluffy inside contrasting perfectly with its crunchy exterior.</p><p> “Jacob makes the bread. The best baker around for miles.” She smiled pushing the plate towards him.  </p><p>Practically greedy he consumed the food.</p><p>“There are a few repairs that we could do with around here. Would you find that fair Mr. Graves?”</p><p>“I believe so” he returned the smile.</p><p>“Good.” Queenie took the now empty plate from him. “You can start up tomorrow. For now, I’ll let you get your business set up.” </p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>Laying down his pile of wood a little further from the inn’s doors  he made quick work of tying a few logs into a table. His presence caught the eyes of a few others who also readied for the day's work. </p><p><em> “Tomorrow,” </em>he thought as he stripped the bark of a particular small log. </p><p>Tomorrow he would begin a repair job. It felt good to have a job to occupy his mind and fill his stomach but he wasn’t so sure if Tina would refuse the trade or if the job would be far larger than he was anticipating. Either way, Percival knew he needed to gain coin for the next town over. </p><p>The morning had shifted to early evening and yet he had not a single customer. Patience was something he had learned over the years. Many locals didn’t take to a stranger setting up business right away. Though knowing that didn’t make the time spent meticulously carving go any faster.</p><p>Carefully blowing off wood chippings into a small brown sack he saw the shy young man from the inn- <em> “Credence” </em> his mind helpfully recalled.</p><p>Outside of the inn Credence looked as out of place as Percival felt. He did seem taller though than when he had spotted him hunched over the dining table. Truly he couldn't see the young man as the adventuring sort. </p><p>Paying him no mind he continued on his carving only glancing up each time he saw the darkened blur in his peripheral vision shift ever so closer.</p><p>By the time he was done Credence was standing right in front of him with a look of awe. </p><p>“Would you like to hold it?” he offered motioning to the carved figure. </p><p>With a wary look, Credence took his carving, turning it over with as much care as glass. </p><p>“Beautiful.”</p><p> It was the first time he heard the young man's voice- it sounded hoarse and yet filled with so much youth that Percival wondered if he was much younger than he looked.</p><p>Credence turned the figure of the woman marveling at the flow of her dress as she remained in mid-jump.</p><p>“Credence” </p><p>Hearing his name made the young man jump. Percival almost cursed himself for breaking the moment of amazement. </p><p>Bowing his head Credence returned the figure to his table. “Sorry” he whispered. Quickly he ran away before Percival could say another word.</p><p> </p><p>“Queenie has informed me that you are willing to do a few repairs here,” Tina said as they sat among the dining table that night. </p><p>“Yes,” he said, ripping a portion of his chicken. “In exchange for meals.” </p><p>Without a beat of silence she added: “I'll be watching over the repairs.”</p><p>“Understood.” Percival had a feeling that tina had experienced her share of customers- most likely men- thinking less of her. Percival prided himself on not being stupid enough to think such things. There was a sort of fire within Tina that he was sure would set him ablaze if he crossed her.</p><p> </p><p>Tomorrow came and Percival set to survey the repairs he was to make. </p><p>Large holes in the wall had been haphazardly tarped over in one of the rooms.  The rest of the room looked thoroughly ransacked. </p><p>“You hadn’t thought to fix this earlier?” He asked, noting some dampness that had spilled onto the floor besides the holes.</p><p>Tina huffed. “We hadn’t found suitable labor.” </p><p>“You find me suitable?”</p><p>Crossing her arms she leaned against the furthest wall. Percival didn’t know if she was purposefully trying to remain as far away from him as possible. “Credence said that you are very talented.”</p><p>“Whittling is not a difficult trade once you get the basics down,” he said standing from his bent position.</p><p>It was hard to read this woman.  She seemed organized, stern, but beyond that he couldn’t quite tell what she thought about her situation.</p><p>The damage here seemed odd. It really would’ve been something he expected her to have fixed immediately.</p><p>“Queenie thinks that you will do a proper job.”</p><p>“That I will.  But I must gather more supplies.”</p><p>“Supplies?”</p><p>“More wood.” He rose to his feet. “I can go chop down what I need in a few hours.”</p><p>Tina seemed to pale at his words. </p><p>“You don’t truly believe in something living out there, do you?</p><p>“I do Mr. Graves as well you should.”</p><p>Percival rubbed the back of his neck. “I can not get this fixed without more supplies.”</p><p>“You can buy your supplies in town” Tina insisted.</p><p> </p><p>
