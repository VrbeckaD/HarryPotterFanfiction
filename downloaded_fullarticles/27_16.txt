    <p>
  <span>In a small flat near Sligo, Ireland lives a young girl. She sits arguing on the telephone, surrounded by stacks of books and with a grey kitten on her shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “ - Dad, I thought we talked about this! I’m very sorry you didn’t want to come, but Mom and I are happy here - oh just a second, there’s somebody at the door.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span> She puts the red telephone back on its hook and runs to the door. Instead of seeing Ms. Waters, the elderly lady in the flat two doors over, she sees a short man. He’s beaming up at her, and is holding a long stick. “Hello, young miss,” he says in a squeaky voice, “Do you happen to be Lydia McBrien?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She frowns and says, “Yes, and who are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Professor Filius Flitwick, from the school of Hogwarts. Is your mother home?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She frowns, and calls into the flat, “Grandfather, there’s a man here! He’s talking about some school and wants to speak to Mom!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Someone grunts from a few rooms away and appears next to Lydia after a few minutes. He stares down at Professor Flitwick. “You are?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Professor Filius Flitwick, good sir! I’ve come on behalf of a very prestigious school to offer your granddaughter admission.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The old man frowns for a moment longer before offering his hand, “Louie Linden, this is my granddaughter Lydia. Though I suppose you know her name if you’re offering some kind of...school?” He opens the door wide and pulls Lydia behind him and away from the professor. “Lydia, did you finish your call?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Yes, he’s challenging as always.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>  The man laughed. “Go on, make up three cocoas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The professor was led through the cramped sitting room and into a kitchen that, if possible, was even more cramped. It barely had space for the small table with three chairs, but they were all able to squeeze into it, with Lydia sitting on the counter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Would you like a brownie, Mister Flitwick? We haven’t got any of the tea most Brits like, but we’ve got coffee if you don't like the cocoa. Mom practically lives off it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “No, thank you, Miss McBrien.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “How come you know my name? I never told you. And you couldn’t have guessed from Grandfather’s because our last names are different.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “I had to know your name so I could give you this letter, Miss McBrien.” He went to hand her a yellowed envelope, but her grandfather took it before she could. Lydia didn’t seem too upset, almost expecting it. She explained to a confused professor, “He’s just looking at it first to make sure it’s safe, Mister Flitwick. He worries a lot. It’s why he’s got all those grey hairs.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> At the last comment Louie threw the parchment at her. “One day that mouth of yours is going to get you into trouble, young lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “As you’ve said,” she grinned, and it was then that the professor noticed something he hadn’t before - the child had a jagged pink scar from near her temple to her mouth. Now that he had seen it, he noticed every movement she made pulled it taut. “Mister Flitwick, what is...Hograts? It sounds like some roleplay game thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Hogwarts, my dear,” he corrected. “Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, to be precise. You have magic, and we at Hogwarts would like to teach you how to use it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Louie got down to business fast. “Professor Flitwick. How are we to believe this is not some elaborate prank? Magic exists, you say? What evidence do you have?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Professor Flitwick clapped his hands. “Ah, this is my favorite part!” He pulled the stick from earlier out of his sleeve and pointed it at the empty vase on the table. He whispered something that sounded like a mix of English and some other language, and the vase changed from pink to blue and bronze. “Tada!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lydia gasped and hopped from the counter, running her fingers over the vase. “Woah, and that was magic?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Louie looked impressed and annoyed about it. “How do you know my Lydia has it? She’s never changed a vase’s colors.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “There was that time I accidentally changed Mom’s favorite skirt purple.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Most of the time accidental magic - what most children do before Hogwarts - is triggered by extreme emotions, such as fear. Miss McBrien, have you ever been scared and done something you didn’t mean to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lydia and her grandfather exchanged a look, and she knew he was thinking of the same event as her. When her grandmother had died, she had been there. And when the rest of her family had found her hugging the dead body, everything in the room had been shattered or lit on fire. Even the things she couldn’t reach or wouldn’t have caught on fire normally. It had been chalked up to a coincidence, but they had been careful not to leave her alone after that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Yes, Sir. So what happens now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Well, the decision hasn’t been made yet. I will tell you more about Hogwarts and then you can decide. Of course, your parents will have to give their permission, but you have time. The deadline for admission isn’t until late July.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “But that’s like, two months!” Lydia whined.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her grandfather smiled fondly. “What kinds of classes does Hogwarts offer? I noticed there was something about brooms on the list, what is that about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Oh, you needn’t worry about a broom yet. First years aren’t allowed their own brooms at Hogwarts. She’ll use the school’s to fly in classes until she gets her own. That is, if she even likes flying. Many Muggleborn don’t enjoy it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Muggle?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Ah, yes. A Muggleborn is someone from non-magical parents. Anywho, the day is passing so do you have any more questions?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Yes, two more I believe. How costly will this be? I can’t imagine those crystal phials are cheap. Also, what is safety like?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Professor Flitwick hummed. “If needed, Hogwarts does provide financial aid to those who ask. As for safety… Our world, just as yours, has had its fair share of danger. Our recent war ended ten years ago however, and we have been as safe as can be since then! With any boarding school, Hogwarts is dangerous. After all, if you put thousands of children together for ten months things will get hectic! But Hogwarts and her staff work very hard to keep things safe. Your granddaughter will be sorted into one of four houses, and her Head of House will provide anything from sage comfort to discipline.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lydia hummed to herself. “It sounds pretty cool, Grandfather. What about the subjects I learn in school now? Are there any of those? I see Potions and Herbology, but no Literature.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Hogwarts offers a Muggle Studies class when you begin third year, but I am afraid no other Muggle classes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Oh.” Both Lydia and Louie frowned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Professor Flitwick stood. “I understand the apprehension. By the end of the month, if you could please owl me your answer, I will gladly take you to the shopping district.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Owl?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Yes. That is the magical method of mailing. I’ll have one of the Hogwarts owls stop by every now and then for you. Gooday!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They showed him to the door, then waited for Lydia’s mother to get home. They had quite the decision to make.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>It was barely a week later when Professor Flitwick received a reply. So, he delivered Lydia and her mother to Diagon Alley. And what a wondrous place it was! All the lights and magic gave Lydia a killer headache, but she couldn’t help wanting to see it over again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  They had gotten most of her supplies, only needing to pick up her potions ingredients, when Professor Flitwick suggested they sit down, as Lydia was looking exhausted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Having got lunch, Lydia’s mother said, “I have a question, Mister Flitwick.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Yes, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “What is your healthcare system? My daughter gets ill easily.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Said girl grumbled into her chicken wrap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Well,” Professor Flitwick said, “in many ways our health care is more advanced, Mrs. McBrien. a broken bone can be healed in seconds. However, there are many Muggle diseases we have no knowledge of, and as such cannot heal by magical means. Does Miss McBrien have a diagnosis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lydia shook her head, pouting. “All the doctors say I’m some kinda medical mystery. I don’t really care, I’m just really tired of being so ill, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Professor Flitiwck smiled sadly at her. “I should tell you a few more things, actually. The first is that of the houses you may belong to. My own house is Ravenclaw - home to those intelligent and creative souls. Of course, that is the most common. Every house has a multitude of personalities and traits.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Gryffindor is for those who are very brave. Gryffindors tend to charge into danger, and though some believe them the greatest house, they of course have their faults. They can be a bit bigheaded and rude, but they have great hearts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> The only house that may have bigger hearts are that of Hufflepuff. Hufflepuffs are commonly thought to be pushovers, but they’re more than that. They are very hardworking and loyal, the best friends you can have. Hufflepuff chose not to define her house, so it is perhaps the most mixed house of them all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> Finally, Slytherin house. Slytherins get a bad reputation, sadly. Ambitious and cunning, though good traits to have, are not seen as such. Slytherin honestly only has the image it does because of You-Know-Who.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “No, I don’t,” Lydia said, tilting her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Oh, right. No one likes to say his name, we’re all still very scared. He’s the evil wizard I mentioned earlier.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both hummed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Professor Flitwick thought to himself for a moment before saying, “Now, I recommend you read up on our sport, Quidditch. I’m not an avid fan myself, but if you wish to survive your peers you’d best have some knowledge. Now, let’s get you home, shall we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took them by the arm and did what he called Apparition.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Lydia knew one thing for sure, it was that she hated Apparition. Her chicken wrap nearly came back up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The nearly two months of waiting felt like pure torture. But now, she was here. Hogwarts was kind of weird, so far. She’d only been here a few hours, but it was very loud. And everyone was way more nosy than they had any right to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> In the first hour of sitting on the train, she had been interrupted by two girls barging in. One of them, a blond girl with a lot of lip gloss, had sat across from her and asked, “What's with the scar?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Lav!” The other girl, one with brightly painted nail polish, had gasped. “You can’t just go around asking people why they’ve got scars. . . But yeah, is that a curse scar like the Harry Potter’s?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Uh, no. I was stabbed.” She was glaring, she knew, but she couldn’t help herself. Just who did these girls think they were?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As if hearing Lydia’s question, Nail Polish Girl held out her hand. “Sue Li, and that’s Lavender Brown.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Lydia McBrien.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few moments of awkward silence and Lavender had changed the subject to beauty potions, mentioning that there would probably be something to help Lydia’s ‘problem’. God, Lydia hated people her age.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> She had been near screaming by the time she was sorted, her ears felt like they were bleeding and she had told an unnaturally blond boy to ‘shut your mouth before I force you to eat the sorting hat’ to which he had told her she should be scared of his father. But finally, </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she had been sorted. And the clapping after that nearly killed her, she swears. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> Before she could bother trying to find a seat with the other first years, a brunette girl had yanked her by the sleeve, freeing up the seat next to her. The girl who had been previously sitting there, her braided hair was spun into a bun, pouted. “Katie!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “What,” Katie grinned, “Poor kid’s clearly going to murder someone if she doesn’t get some kinda quiet. Which I can provide.” Katie turned to Lydia, “Lydia, right? Here, put these earplugs in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lydia looked at the yellow rubber plugs with suspicion but put them in, almost automatically slumping. “Thanks, uh, Katie?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Katie gave her a thumbs up, and left her to blissful silence. She only nudged her when the prefects stood to leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  So yes, Hogwarts was a little strange, and she would definitely need a ton of Tylenol, but it was better than her lonely little flat in Ireland. Katie Bell and Alicia Spinnet had helped her, so it couldn’t possibly be bad here. </span>
</p><p> </p>
