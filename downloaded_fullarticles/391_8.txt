  <span>“Oh,” Harry says. “You came.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco, who looks slightly terrified and simultaneously miffed on the doorstep of Harry’s house, winces. “I was invited.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know,” Harry says, awkwardly. “I invited you.” The music and friendly chatter from inside the house trickle out, yet still, Harry seems to be frozen in place.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco shifts his weight, drawing Harry’s attention to his slight hips in </span>
  <em>
    <span>very </span>
  </em>
  <span>fitted slacks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Was I not meant to?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Harry looks back up to his face, pausing to appreciate the view along the way. He really should try and focus here.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come,” Draco says, a teasing lilt to his voice. “Was I not meant to come?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry swallows thickly, noticing how Draco’s eyes follow the movement. He’s doing this on purpose. Did he have a plan for coming here to mess with Harry’s head?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He looks at Draco’s outfit again. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco clears his throat and raises a brow when he’s got Harry’s attention again. Right, he asked a question.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You can come whenever you want,” Harry blurts out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oh no. Visuals are taking over. Draco smirks like he knows exactly what Harry’s imagining. Of course he does, the little minx planned all this to happen. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come inside,” Harry continues, making things infinitely worse for his overactive imagination. Two shots of firewhiskey and his brain starts writing porn scenes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Since you asked nicely,” Draco bites his lip and moves to stand right in front of Harry. Right, he’s still in the way. “Whereto?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hmm?” Harry garbles as Draco’s hand lands on his lower stomach, inching lower still. Oh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bedroom?” Draco asks, smirking again. “To put my coat?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s not wearing a coat.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right.” Harry leads Draco upstairs. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When they arrive there, they’re faced with a mountain of coats on his bed. He turns to face Draco and is immediately pushed up against the wall, with Draco whispering in his ear, “I come first.”</span>
