    <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>
The Dumbledore family seemed like your average ordinary family. They had three children, two boys and one girl. The girl was the youngest.</p><p>By looking at this family you would never know they held a secret that most people did not know.</p><p>They belonged to a world unknown to most, a magical world. They were witches and wizards.</p><p>However, they held a secret even more dark and sinister than that. Even the magical world did not know this secret and it would be several years before anyone found out this heinous secret that would bring the world, both muggle and magical, to its knees.</p><p>Mould-on-the-Wold, England Great Britain, June 21, 1885: Home of Percival and Kendra Dumbledore.</p><p>It was getting late in the evening and his wife was currently in labor, she has been in labor for 75 hours straight and Percival didnâ€™t know if his wife would have the energy needed to survive this birth and the damages done to her body.</p><p>The mediwizard had been here the whole 75 hours working tirelessly on Kendra, she had been ill since the fifth month.</p><p>They put her on bed rest to ensure her and the little one she carried would make it safely through the pregnancy and delivery.</p><p>Kendra was seven months pregnant when she started having pains and bleeding, terrified for the health of his wife and child he called for the mediwizard.</p><p>The baby had gone into distress and used magic to try and lash out at the attack on it's being this alerted them that something was wrong, because in the process of lashing out the baby had tore through the uterus causing extreme pain and blood loss.</p><p>Kendra's magic had kicked in to save her unborn daughters life and ensure her own safety as well, the only downfall to that is her energy levels were being extinguished way to rapidly and in order to keep her and the child alive she slipped into a magical coma so that only the essential systems in the body were on going and everything would slow down, her breathing, heart rate and brain waves.</p><p>Racing the clock to keep mother and child alive the mediwitches and mediwizards were working around the clock and were bordering on exhaustion but they were determined not to allow this magical child or her mother die.</p><p>The medical staff were having to repair the damage and keep the baby safe within the womb, if they didn't, neither mother nor daughter may survive and that was unacceptable.</p><p>Now nearing midnight and the 80 hour mark the exhaustion of Percival Dumbledore was setting in, he had sent both Albus and Aberforth to his parents so that they would be taken care of and that they would not get upset or cause a disturbance while the medical staff worked to save his wife and daughter.</p><p>The boys were four and two and it was better they didn't see their father in such a distressed state or their magic may lash out and cause more problems for their mother and unborn sister.</p><p>Their magic was very powerful and well developed already all they had to do was be taught control at Hogwarts or some other magical school of their choosing.</p><p>He started thinking of his time at Hogwarts, his father had been a Ravenclaw and his mother had been a Slytherin.</p><p>Both pure bloods and heirs to great families, the Dumbledore family and the Starken family. The English Ravenclaw and the German Slytherin princess met and fell in love at Hogwarts when their families started searching for pure blood spouses for their children, it was Agatha Starken and Bornest Percival who told their parents they should contact the others family and that is what led to them being wed.</p><p>He was sorted to Ravenclaw himself but the hat had been unsure if he should be Ravenclaw or Slytherin being that he had both traits in his blood his older brother was a Slytherin, so was his older sister, however his two younger sisters were both Gryffindor. Imagine the surprise of his parents when they learned that, they didn't treat them any different than the others, they were just shocked. Although it was a pleasant surprise.</p><p>He found his love in Kendra McKinnon a muggle born witch from Scotland she was feisty, beautiful, intelligent, and funny. She had a good sense of humor that always made him smile and laugh at her antics.</p><p>He sometimes thought that maybe his parents didn't approve of him not marrying a pure blood like all his other siblings had, sometimes he wondered if they found fault in his choice of spouse. He remembers when he told his family of his intentions at Yule the whole room went completely quiet, you could have heard a mouse sneeze.</p><p>Their reaction never changed his opinion and he would rather be disowned than give up Kendra. That didn't happen though because his parents decided before taking that step they wanted to meet this charismatic young lady who stole the heart of their middle born child.</p><p>The younger sisters started telling their family stories of the young lady in question and it only made them want to meet her more, so Percival went the next day to see if she could come and meet his family. When her father met him at the door he introduced himself and spoke to him about marrying Kendra and taking her to meet his family, he got permission after promising nothing would happen to his daughter whilst she was with him.</p><p>When they met her there was a heavy feeling to the air, Kendra felt it immediately and she did what came most natural, she used her manners to introduce herself, cracked a few jokes making everyone laugh and like that the tension was broken.</p><p>They learned a lot about the young lady and the hardships of growing up a muggle born and the ways muggles cope without magic. They decided to let their son marry her she seemed nice and decent enough that with her easy going attitude it might make the family secret less volatile.</p><p>They wed two years after graduating Hogwarts, and one year later Albus was born into the family. His life was so perfect now he couldn't even imagine his life without her.</p><p>His thoughts drifted to a life without his wife and daughter and a whole lot of 'what-ifs' that had no place in his life right now.</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by the crying of his newborn.</p><p>They got the baby out, now to await word on his beautiful wife Kendra.</p><p>The baby was put in his arms while he awaited word on his wife's condition.</p><p>The Mediwitches and wizards were still trying to repair the damage done to Kendra by the baby's backlash of magic during the distress. They had to remove her for her own safety.</p><p>Percival wondered if maybe he had passed on his inheritance to this beautiful baby that he held close with love and tenderness.</p><p>Percival decided to hand the baby over to one of the nurses so he could go floo his mother and update her on what was happening.</p><p>"Percival, you do realize it's 12:30 a.m. where we... dear Circe, please tell me Kendra and the baby are alright." His mother had started out complaining because she was half asleep before she realized what this call could mean.</p><p>"The babies fine mother, she's beautiful. However, they still haven't repaired all the damage done to Kendra when the baby went into distress. What if I lose her." Percival sounded so defeated and looked exhausted.</p><p>"You stop right there, Percival Dalton Dumbledore, don't even harbor that notion for a moment." His mother's strict commanding tone seemed to snap him out of his deep dark thoughts.</p><p>He would be eternally grateful for his mother's stern and commanding tone because he would realize at a later time how dangerous it was for him to lose hope.</p><p>"You are correct as always mother, I should not let my thoughts drift and allow me to lose hope. How are the boys? Are they behaving?"</p><p>"Of course I am correct, I am your mother after all." They both chuckled at that statement before his mother answered his questions. "Albus and Aberforth are just fine they are perfect little angels as usual, although they had your father running around all day and now the three of them are sleeping soundly they are completely exhausted."</p><p>Agatha Dumbledore examined her son closely before voicing her own question and concerns.</p><p>"Darling do you want me to come assist you with the baby so that once they are done with Kendra you both can rest and you can focus on her recovery? Also, you should get some sleep it will do your wife no good to have a physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted and drained husband." Agatha put emphasis on the last part of the statement she made.</p><p>Percival thought about it for a few minutes before asking, "Will father be able to handle the boys by himself?"</p><p>His mother gave him a look  that said 'you do know who your father is right?' and he chuckled at himself before saying, "Right my father can fend for himself and the boys he does have the servants, house elves and he is Lord Dumbledore."</p><p>"Precisely, so want me to come and assist you and Kendra? The boys can stay the rest of the summer and hopefully by then Kendra will be up and around enough to not worry them. I will stay as long as you desire or need me to. I do miss the lot of you." When Agatha pouted Percival laughed. His mother was sorted properly into Slytherin during her school years, she could manipulate a stone into giving water.</p><p>"Of course mother, I would appreciate the assistance with your granddaughter. I haven't named her yet I'm awaiting Kendra's input on the matter." He sighed softly.</p><p>"As it should be my dear. I will tell your father and pack a bag then I am on my way."</p><p>"Thank you mother. By the way are you disappointed in me for marrying a muggle born?"</p><p>Agatha gave her son a calculating look before she answered figuring the truth would be best, "I was a little disappointed at first, and then I met her and saw why you loved her so much, however, I still had my reservations at least until I got to hold Albus. You make beautiful and powerful grandbabies and what pureblood wouldn't see the benefit in that. Add to that our family secret and it has been a positive thing. I just hope we don't have a reoccurence, of what happened with you when you reached puberty, happening with any of your children."</p><p>Percival shuddered at that thought he hoped the same thing.</p><p>"I will see you soon mother, good voyage, travel safely." With a lighter heart Percival went to await information on his wife's condition and to check on his baby girl.</p><p>He just hoped nothing of his inheritance would show up in any of his children, though he could see traces of it in his middle and youngest child. However, the one he would have to keep his eye on was Albus.</p><p>His brother and sister's had all shown signs at some point before puberty and mastered control of the powers associated with their inheritance so they thought he was free and clear. His power increase caused many problems that had to be fixed or covered up.</p><p>Percival had negligently thought that just because he showed no signs he didn't have to worry about his inheritance and now he had to be extra careful not to lose himself in deep dark thoughts or emotions, otherwise he could lose control and his dark creature inheritance could cause destruction of not just the magical world but also the muggle world as well. Only time would tell.</p>
