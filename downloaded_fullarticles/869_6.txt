    <p>I shift nervously as the Prefect before me waves an arm around my new Common Room, the feeling of home that filled me a moment ago slipping through my fingers as he gestures for the boys to go left and the girl’s right.</p><p>All around me, there are excited whispers and exchanged smiles as they rush off and leave me standing alone in the middle of the room. My eyes drift to the boys as I watch their high sprites as they jokingly push each other aside to be the first to reach the top, and my heart longs to follow them.</p><p>I resist the urge, turning away and taking a single step to the right, the swish of the skirt I am wear tickling uncomfortably across my knee. I long for the comfy jeans tucked away in my suitcase which now resides up the stairs before me as not even the long socks I am also wearing can remove the feeling of being exposed I’m currently experiencing.</p><p>Swallowing down my nerves, I wait until the last pair of girls has reached the top lagging behind the others as they gossip about every magical sight they have seen since arriving. This place truly is wondrous from the lavish feast to the star-filled view above our heads as we were sorted by a fantastic singing hat. One that promised a place to belong, for all of us here at Hogwarts.</p><p>I shake away my daydreams, and after one last look behind me at the other staircase and increasingly aware of the growing number of eyes on me, I rush upwards. I make it three steps before the ground sinks beneath me. The steps flattening to a slide and I am flying down it with a cry as my skirt lifts for a moment.</p><p>My cheeks flaming I quickly rearrange the hated garment as I stand, the room around me silent except for the crackling of the fire. The Prefect strides towards me and an apology explodes out of my mouth before he can begin shouting.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I don’t know what happened, and I didn’t mean to break the stairs.”</p><p>My words stop as he raises a hand and gives me a small smile that removes some of the tension from my shoulders.</p><p>“It’s fine, this happens at least every few years, boys aren’t allowed in the girl’s dorms,” he tells me as he rests his hand on my shoulder and my heart pauses before racing.</p><p>“W-what?” I stammer, my eyes flitting around the room worried someone has overheard and any minute now someone will say something rude. No one does, they are all smiling at me and a few even wave in greeting.</p><p>“It’s old magic, nothing we can do about it, but we can sort you out young man. For starters we need to get you the correct uniform; you must be awfully uncomfortable in that one.”</p><p>I nod, my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth and a lump forming in my throat as a smile splits my face in two.</p><p>“Welcome to Hogwarts, where we have the magic to see people for who they really are,” he whispers into my ear as he guides me towards the left staircase.</p><p>My heart is pounding so loudly in my chest that it echoes in my ears as I take my first step upwards, and I’m filled with a type of magic I have always wished for, acceptance.</p><p>“I always knew I was a real boy,” I choke out as we head up to the boys' dorm.</p><p>“Of course you are and have always been,” the perfect says back matter of factly before calling on a house-elf to fetch a change of clothes. Leaning down he asks my name and I give it, the one that feels right on my tongue rather than the one called when I was sorted.</p><p>Smiling once more, he pushes open the door to the boys’ first-year dorm and introduces me to everyone. There are a few odd looks at first but with a single sentence from the prefect the tension is broken and I am called in to join my peers.</p><p>“Please tell me you don’t snore,” one says, and I laugh that his first and most significant concern is that I might disrupt his sleep. Finally I feel like I’m home.</p>
