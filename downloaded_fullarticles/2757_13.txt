<b></b><b><em>Saving Grace</em></b>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Malfoys always protect their own. That is their saving grace, that is their downfall.<br/>His father sees fit to do so through servitude to the darkest wizard of their age.<br/>His mother turns to an old friend and an ancient vow to secure her son’s future.<br/>And Draco?<br/>Draco tears his world apart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>// Draco will do anything to keep his family, his friends, and his snakes safe. At the cost of his life, his title, his dignity and his friendships he creates safehouses across the globe, each with a fidelius charm cast upon it and guards them well. Anyone- pure, mugg or mud is welcome to seek shelter there but once they’ve entered the grounds, they cannot leave. Not until the war is won. <br/>His secret keeper? Himself, of course. //</em>
