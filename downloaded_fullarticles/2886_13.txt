<p>Day One: Partridge in a Pear Tree.</p>
<p>Draco couldn’t help but smile as he read the piece of parchment he had just pulled out of the Santa hat that was passed to him. He sat in the meeting room at work where he worked with one Hermione Granger. He was excited about this Christmas activity she had planned. She suggested doing the Twelve Days of Christmas where they all drew a name and gifted them something. Which is going to work perfectly now; for Draco had drawn Granger’s name. He’d been wanting to ask her out since she started working for his father’s company that he now owned and ran. So this was perfect, he would send her gifts and on Christmas day ask her to be his girlfriend.</p>
<p>“What are you smiling at?” His friend Blaise asked him.</p>
<p>“Just my name I got.” Draco replied with a smile.</p>
<p>“That good?” Blaise smirked.</p>
<p>“You have no idea.” Draco replied.</p>
<p>Yes, this would be an amazing thing for him. Hermione wouldn’t know what hit her. He couldn’t help but keep on smiling. Even with this boring meeting he was sitting in.</p>
<p>“As you all know with Christmas coming, we are doing this new thing that Miss Granger has suggested us do.” Draco said with all eyes on him “Let’s have fun with it,” he said, looking straight at Granger. “With that, you are all dismissed for the day.”</p>
<p>Everyone was leaving, but Granger stayed behind as she always did to make sure all the paperwork was gathered and no one left anything behind. Draco just sat back in his chair and watched her.</p>
<p>“Granger,” he said, “a moment of your time.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Malfoy,” she said, stopping what she was doing and sitting in the chair next to him, her leg brushing his.</p>
<p>“I was wondering when we start doing this fun thing?” He asked, smirking since he already knew she had just told them, but he was kind of distracted by her as she came around with the Santa hat he accidentally brushed his hand with hers and he lost all thoughts after that.</p>
<p>“Did you not hear when I said it?” She asked jokingly.</p>
<p>“I was distracted.” He replied, blushing a bit.</p>
<p>“We start in two days.” She replied, standing up. “Is that all you needed Mr Malfoy?” She asked, leaning over the table and looking at him.</p>
<p>“Yes, that was all, Miss Granger.” He said, holding her gaze.</p>
<p>She got up to walk away and he couldn’t help but stare at her as she walked away grinning like a kid in a candy store. “Yes, this is going to be a good Christmas,” he said out loud.</p>
<p>“How so?” Blaise asked, leaning on the door to the meeting room, smirking</p>
<p>“Oh well….Um…..You see,” Draco said, stuttering. “Igotgrangerformyname,” he replied really fast.</p>
<p>“What was that mate? Didn’t quite catch that,” Blaise said even though he did hear him just fine.</p>
<p>“I got Granger for my name.” He said, blushing “It's going to be perfect and in the end, she will want to date me.”</p>
<p>“Well, good luck mate. I know you have been waiting for a time to woo her so this should be good.” Blaise said.</p>
<p>“Well, see you Monday.” Draco replied, getting up and leaving to go home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco woke up Monday morning with a big grin on his face. He had worked all night on her 12 Days of Christmas and was so excited to start doing them. He made sure his tie was straight and the blue one she liked so much. And flowed into work. He tiptoed past her office, making sure she wasn’t there and went in and set the tree ornament on her desk; Draco murmured the spell that would activate it when she opened it up so it would move. And inside would be a gift that when she took out the small package would enlarge to open. He couldn’t help but smirk at it; it was amazing what he had planned. Let’s just hope she likes it. He turned to leave her office just as he heard her heels clicking against the floor.</p>
<p>Hermione was so excited to see what her Secret Santa had got her that she rushed to work and hoped it would be there. She made her way down the corridor at a brisk pace. She saw Malfoy standing in the hallway by her office.</p>
<p>“Morning, Granger.” He said, nodding to her.</p>
<p>“Morning, Malfoy,” she said in return as she hurried into her office and sat down at her desk. There on her desk was a Christmas ornament that was white; painted on it was 1 Partridge in a Pear Tree on one side and the other was a button. She pushed the button on it and it opened up and inside was a Partridge in a Pear tree moving around. There was a package she saw and she grabbed it out it was under the tree in the amazing ornament. With shaking hands she grabbed the package and brought it out. She read:</p>
<p>On the first day of Christmas my Secret Santa gave to me:</p>
<p>She opened the package - inside were the most beautiful pair of earrings. They were her birthstone. She gave a little gasp as she took them out.</p>
<p>“Alright there, Granger?” Draco asked her, hearing her gasp in the hall.</p>
<p>“Just my Secret Santa..” She trailed off. “They gave me the most amazing thing. The ornament is breathtaking and the gift.” She said with a smile.</p>
<p>Draco couldn’t help but smile with her. He was glad she had liked it.</p>
<p>“Well, I better get back to work.” Draco replied, leaving a stunned Hermione in her office.</p>
<p>Draco was whistling a happy tune all day and didn’t care what others thought.</p>
