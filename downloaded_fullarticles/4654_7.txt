          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It officially becomes a <em>thing</em> in sixth year. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Before now, it had been this: Remus letting Sirius rest his head on his lap on the train ride home after first year, his fingers coming up hesitantly to brush the hair out of his eyes; Sirius letting out a soft breath and one word—<em>more</em>; Remus smiling despite the butterflies warring in his stomach; Sirius falling asleep faster than any of them had ever seen him do. And this: Sirius figuring out Remus was a werewolf in second year; Remus running, hiding, crying because he’d lose the only friends he’d ever had; Sirius crawling into his bed at night, holding him close and assuring him they weren’t going anywhere—<em>he</em> wasn’t going anywhere; Remus believing him, through second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth year. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Now, it was this: Remus letting Sirius crawl into his bed late at night, his fingers automatically coming to rest deep in his hair; Sirius whispering nothings into his ear; Remus smiling along with the butterflies in his stomach; Sirius falling asleep right before Remus drifts off himself, both of them peaceful and unaffected by the nightmares that used to plague them. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The two of them sit in the Common Room, Sirius’ head in Remus’ lap as Remus reads a book he’d forgotten about until he found it at the bottom of his trunk. He’s balancing his attention between the pages in front of him and Sirius’ hair in between his fingers. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The other boy appears to be asleep, and Remus is glad he’s finally getting some rest. He’d been up late last night, sitting beside Remus in bed and insisting he get some sleep because <em>I’ll go to bed in an hour, Moony, I swear</em>, but he knew Sirius hadn’t slept at all. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He cards his fingers through Sirius’ hair as he reads the same page for the third time, trying to absorb the words instead of thinking about Sirius’ smile. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They’d been lounging in the grass earlier when Remus had said something that made Sirius laugh, which in itself wasn’t new—and neither were the butterflies dancing in Remus’ stomach—but the way Remus’ brain had supplied the word <em>love</em> when Sirius threw his head back had made his whole body jolt. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He thinks about it now, his book finally abandoned, as he looks down at Sirius’ fluttering eyelashes. He’s dreaming. Remus smiles softly because he knows it’s a good one—he hasn’t woken up screaming yet, which is always a good sign.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As if Sirius knows he’s thinking about him, his eyes open slowly and immediately lock with Remus’. He doesn’t even have time to feel like a deer caught in headlights because Sirius smiles at him, slow and goofy, and Remus’ heart <em>jumps</em>. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey,” Remus says softly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Moony,” Sirius says around a yawn, and there’s that word again in the back of his mind.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“How was your nap?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius’ smile widens. “Excellent. I had a great pillow.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And when he winks at him, Remus feels his heart in his throat. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What about you? How’s your book?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus glances down at it, having forgotten about it yet again. “Oh,” he says. “Couldn’t get into it really.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius smirks at him. “Yeah?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He wills the butterflies to dance quieter. He wants to hear nothing but the sound of Sirius laughing quietly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The universe has other plans though it seems because at that moment James and Peter come crashing through the Portrait Hole, laughing and arguing about who <em>really </em>hit that Slytherin with that Jelly Jinx. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus huffs a breath as Sirius sits up slowly—reluctant, it seems, to leave the comfort of Remus’ lap. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus is reluctant to have him go. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And the peace was broken,” Sirius says close to his ear as he settles in next to him, stretching his arms above his head, his shirt riding up and exposing a line of his stomach that Remus definitely doesn’t stare at. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He laughs slightly at Sirius’ words and says, “I’ll never focus on my book now.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius looks at him, scooting closer to press their thighs together. “Oh, Moony. Certainly, if you can’t focus with my head in your lap, you never will.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus shakes his head, bring his arm up to rest on the back of the couch behind Sirius’ head. “Arse,” he mutters. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At that moment James wanders over, trailing his fingers absently through the ends of Sirius’ hair.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey,” Sirius says, “you know the rules.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James groans softly. “I know, I know.” He stops then, looks at the two of them pressed together on the couch, and opens his mouth. “Why is Moony allowed to touch your hair?”<br/> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He’s not,” Sirius says plainly. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He’s literally touching it right now,” James complains. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius turns his head slightly, and Remus stills his hand, only just realizing he’s been carding it through Sirius’ hair the whole time he’s been sitting there. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Moony,” he whines, dragging out his name. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I wanna touch it,” James says, already reaching his hand out.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius smacks it away. “Prongs,” he says warningly. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What?” he asks innocently. “It looks soft.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It is,” Remus says, finally breaking his silence and continuing to run his hand through Sirius’ hair. He doesn’t seem to notice. Remus absently wonders when this had become so second nature that neither of them even register it anymore, but shakes his head to chase the thought away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius shoots him a look that says <em>not helping</em> and turns back to James. “No one’s allowed to touch my hair.” He glances at Remus again, and slowly adds, “Not even Moony.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus makes a sound of disapproval in the back of his throat and James just stares at them. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You do know,” James starts, looking between the two of them, “that his hand is <em>still</em> in your hair, right? The whole time you’ve been talking, Moony has been running his fingers through your hair.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus stills his hand again and finally removes it, placing it in his lap tenderly—like it’s something holy. Or like it’s <em>touched</em> something holy. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius whines at the loss of Remus’ hand, though apparently against his will, because he slaps a hand over his mouth as soon as the sound escapes. “Shit,” he says quietly. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James looks like he’s torn between laughing and running away. “When did this happen?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“When did what happen?” Remus repeats. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James just sighs and shakes his head, walking away as he mutters something under his breath.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus looks over at Sirius. “What was that about?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius is quiet, though, which only faintly surprises him. He shrugs his shoulders, stretching out to lay his head in Remus’ lap again. “How often do you touch my hair?” he asks, and that <em>really</em> surprises Remus. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Uh,” he says. Eloquent. But he has to think about it because it could be often, it could be never, Remus doesn’t actually <em>know</em>. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He vaguely recalls running his hands through Sirius’ hair the other night as he was falling asleep. And last week as they sprawled in the grass by the Great Lake. And a couple days ago at breakfast when Sirius had received a letter from his family. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But those memories were hazy at best—the kind that have that faint white light around the edges that make Remus wonder whether they actually happened or if he just dreamt them. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Not that often,” he decides on.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius looks at him skeptically. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s second nature,” Remus admits, steeling himself. “I don’t think either of us really notice it anymore.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“If we ever did,” Sirius says. He looks like he’s thinking about it. Maybe trying to recall instances where he’d been aware Remus was even touching him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus feels a dull ache in his chest—the butterflies have gone blessedly silent, but in their absence there’s still a slight thrumming. He tries to remember a time his body didn’t hum when Sirius was so close, but his mind is empty. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s always been kind of different with you.” Sirius speaks quietly, and Remus stares down at him, trying to imagine the thoughts flying around his head right now. He knows Sirius is thinking dizzyingly fast, trying to find the right words to describe exactly how <em>different</em> it is with Remus. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He imagines his heart beating in time with Sirius’ thoughts, his hand coming up to absently run through his friend’s hair. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’re doing it,” Sirius whispers and Remus stills his hand. “No, don’t stop.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He moves again, slowly, <em>reverently</em>, his fingers gliding through the soft hair at the nape of Sirius’ neck. He decides to voice the question he’d thought of earlier. “When did this become something that just happened? That we didn’t even register anymore?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius shakes his head slightly, Remus’ hand moving along with him. “You’ve always been different,” he says again. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus doesn’t say anything—doesn’t <em>breathe</em>—he just waits. Waits for Sirius to say what he’s thinking. Waits for Sirius to realize. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He knows it must be important if Sirius is taking so much time to collect his thoughts, to mull things over in his head. So often, words spew from his mouth so fast Remus feels dizzy trying to keep up with him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Now, though, time seems to have slowed down. Sirius closes his eyes as Remus’ hand brushes across his forehead, his lips parting, moving silently, testing the words he’ll speak. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And Remus waits. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Finally, Sirius reaches up and takes Remus’ hand, pulling it down to lay on his chest, his own fingers knotting with his. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’ve always felt it,” he starts and Remus watches his lips form the words. “Even that first day on the train, when we didn’t even know each other. You had such a pull to you that I immediately knew. I was so young back then, but I knew. Fuck.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus doesn’t know what to do. He sits there with his hand and his heart in Sirius’. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And then in second year when we—I knew even more then. If that makes sense. I knew it then because nothing changed. Because you were still you. Moony. You were the same as you’d always been. The same as you are. And my heart still did that weird jumping thing whenever you looked at me. And I fucking knew. I thought about it a lot, but I never let myself hope. You know? I didn’t want to…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius trails off and Remus can’t take his eyes off of him. He knows what Sirius is saying, and the butterflies are there and they’ve brought backup, and his heart is crawling out of his chest and into Sirius’ palm, and Remus knows too. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He doesn’t speak, though. He wants to make sure Sirius says everything he wants to. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“But there was always that voice in the back of my head,” he continues. He doesn’t look at Remus, hasn’t this whole time. But Remus is mesmerized. “The one that told me <em>maybe. Maybe this could happen</em>. And sometimes I believed it, but others I just told it to fuck off and leave me alone. But now…” He finally looks up and meets Remus’ eyes. Remus can’t look away. Not even if he wanted to. “Now, I think it’s right.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And Remus still doesn’t say anything, just leans down and slots their mouths together. It’s a weird angle and he’s smiling too big to properly kiss Sirius, but he thinks it’s the best kiss he’s ever had. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s right,” Remus says when he pulls away. "It’s always been right. I knew, too. The second I saw you, I knew. We both knew. What the fuck?” he says with a laugh. “Hell, I think James knew.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius smiles at him. “I think half the school knew.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Why didn’t we notice it?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Believe me, I tried,” Sirius says. “I looked for it every time I saw you. You’re good at hiding it.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus shrugs. “I’m a good liar.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Not as good as you think,” he tells him with a smirk and Remus just shrugs again. “You’re better at pretending than you are at lying. There’s a difference,” Sirius adds when Remus gives him a look. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well, then, so are you.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It helps when the whole school makes up stories about you.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus cringes. He thinks of the rumors he’d heard but never let himself fully believe—whether out of desperate hope or loyalty to his friend, he’s not sure. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Do you want to go to bed?” Remus asks, deciding to ignore what Sirius said. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He doesn’t respond, just rolls over so he can stand up while still holding Remus’ hand. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They walk through the Common Room, hands entwined and hearts beating together, and up the stairs to their dormitory. When they step through the doors, James looks up at them. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fucking knew it,” he mutters, turning back to the Quidditch magazine he was reading. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Knew what?” Peter asks, sticking his head around the curtain of his bed. His eyes land on Sirius and Remus’ hands. “Oh. Yeah. Cheers, guys,” he says with a smile and pulls the curtains closed again. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We’re happy for you, lads,” James says without looking up, but there’s a wide smile on his face. “Finally got your shit together.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius snorts and Remus smiles. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Guess so,” Remus says. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They both head straight for Remus’ bed, shuffling onto it and laying back together. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus sits still as Sirius mutters a silencing charm, and as soon as he’s done, he pulls him flush against him and kisses him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This time, it’s the perfect cliche. There are fireworks and butterflies and angels singing and every fucking thing Remus could ever imagine. And it’s better than anything he’s ever experienced because—fuck—he <em>loves</em> this boy. He loves Sirius. And the thought no longer drowns him. Instead, it lifts him up and he feels like he’s floating. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Here, kissing his best friend, the boy he’s loved for six years, Remus has never felt happier. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They break apart and Remus’ breathing comes in rappid gasps, and Sirius is right there—a hand on the back of his neck and a leg in between his thighs—and Remus lets the words spill out of his mouth. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius sits there staring at him, the fingers on his neck making small circles in his hair. “I love you, too,” he says and all the starts fall from the sky, surrounding them in Remus’ fourposter bed. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He feels as if his face is going to split in half, but he thinks maybe he’d like that if it means he’d never stop smiling. And then Sirius is laughing and they’re falling back against Remus’ pillows. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We’re in love,” Remus whispers. And it’s quiet, <em>awed</em>. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius trails his fingers down Remus’ chest, and back up again, finally settling just above his heart. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, we are.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And Sirius kisses him again. </span>
