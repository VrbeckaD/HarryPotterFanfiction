  <strong>18 August 1985 - Afternoon - St. Mungo's</strong>
</p><p>Healer Ascel Witt had been the Chief Healer at St. Mungo's for almost four decades. Despite the administration duties he faced on a daily basis he still found time for patients he chose. One of them was ex-prisoner Sirius Black.</p><p>The Healer, considered an elderly man due to an age of 90 Summers, had brown hair barely streaked with grey, sharp, clear, blue eyes, thin features and a tall frame that was as thin. Ascel Witt was a wizard who had kept to a strict health regimen that included a morning run. His wife Carise, also a Healer, was 23 years younger and could easily attest to the fitness of her husband.</p><p>It was Carise Witt, a petite woman at just four feet in height, with red hair dusted by white and eyes of green, who met Severus and Poppy. She greeted them both with a big smile. "My husband, Ascel, is finishing up a psychological evaluation of Mr. Black. Follow me and we'll join him."</p><p>As they walked Poppy asked, "Do you know how Mr. Black has been since I sent him here last night?"</p><p>Carise Witt sighed heavily. "Irrational, to say the least. When he arrived he became so agitated in his sleep that he came out of the sleep potion you had given him at Hogwarts. He began to yell, to threaten to kill Mr. Snape, here, and to take his godson 'away from all these freaks that would use his godson to their own bitter ends'."</p><p>Severus lips thinned in response whereas Poppy patted his arm soothingly. "Has Mr. Black slept at all since then, Healer Witt?"</p><p>Carise shook her head sadly as they stopped outside of a pastel coloured door of pink. "Mr. Snape, why don't you wait here just a moment. I'd like to make sure that Mr. Black does not behave foolishly the moment he sees you."</p><p>"Muzzle the mutt," glowered Severus under his breath. He had learned that Black was a dog animagus and he thought it rather apropos for the wizard.</p><p>Poppy smiled at him, and caught her hand in his. She squeezed his fingers, let go, and followed the Healer into Sirius' room. She closed the door behind herself.</p><p>Severus waited a few minutes before staring at the soft, obnoxious, pink door. He hated pink. Deceptively cheerful. He recalled a witch on the Wizengamot who had wanted him to be kissed by a dementor at his trial. She had a disturbing habit of smiling... at everything. And, everything she wore including her robes were pink.</p><p>Poppy opened the door, breaking his thoughts of the past. "Come in, Severus. Healer Ascel Witt has given Mr. Black a mild sedative. He is still awake but he will remain in bed."</p><p>Poppy's good words were for naught. Sirius saw his childhood nemesis, and with the rush of adrenaline to his system the mild sedative potion was wiped out. Breaking free of Healer Witt and his blankets with near inhuman strength Sirius leapt from the bed, cursing, as he dove for Severus.</p><p>Severus had fully expected Sirius to attack and his wand had been at the ready. While Sirius was basically still in the air Severus pointed his wand and cast the Stunning Spell. "Stupefy!"</p><p>Sirius fell to his hospital bed and would have slipped off of it had he not been caught by a rather disapproving Healer Ascel Witt.</p><p>"Was that necessary?" demanded Ascel. His wife was settling the unconscious wizard back in his bed.</p><p>Severus momentarily cocked his head, then said, "Yes. You saw that he was about to attack me. Obviously a sedative is not enough. I suggest you restrain him as I do wish to speak to him."</p><p>Poppy frowned angrily as she regarded the Chief Healer, "I told you last night that he ought to be restrained!"</p><p>Ascel glared down at the Hogwarts Healer. "Mr. Black was fighting against his restraints so I made the decision to remove them. Other than his anger manifesting verbally I did not anticipate a problem with him."</p><p>Poppy was about to verbally eviscerate the tall man before her but Severus' calm, yet firm, voice stopped her when he commented, "Problem anticipated, Healer Witt. Would you please restrain the man, and then wake him?"</p><p>The Healer did not reply to the Potions Master, but glanced quickly at Poppy. "Madame?"</p><p>Poppy stood straight already but she stiffened her spine more as she nodded sharply. "Please do as Professor Snape asked, Healer Witt."</p><p>The Healer nodded but he was clearly displeased by the Potions Master's presence. To underline that sentiment, he addressed Poppy, "Madame, you will remain in this room with Mr. Black as Mr. Snape interrogates him, otherwise I shall not leave."</p><p>Severus wanted to retort, and maybe hex the Healer for the insult implied, but Poppy stopped him with a firm touch to his forearm. She nodded, "I shall remain, Healer Witt."</p><p>Once Sirius was restrained and then wakened, Ascel addressed his patient as he touched the man's shoulder. "The restraints are temporary, Mr. Black. I shall remove them once Mr. Snape has said his peace. Please, try to remain calm."</p><p>Sirius gave Severus a look of glittering daggers that could kill but he turned his gaze away, and nodded in compliance to the Healer. Ascel and Carise left without another word. As soon as the door to his room closed, Poppy erected a Silencing Charm as Sirius burst angrily, "You took Jamie's son, you snivelling bastard!"</p><p>Severus threw the same Silencing Charm across Sirius' mouth, and then spoke to him calmly. "What you do not know, Black, is that Harry was placed with his Muggle relatives. The Dursleys. Do you recall them?" Sirius, who was resigned to his enforced silence, nodded sharply. "Despicable people. They disliked Harry. In fact, several months ago his uncle threw the child away when he was so very sick they were unable to wake him. Had I not gone to see to the child, he would have died."</p><p>Sirius' face went suddenly chalky-white. He struggled, and yelled at Severus. Poppy spoke softly, "Severus, please remove the Silence. I believe he has something to say."</p><p>Severus removed the Silencing Charm and Sirius yelled, "...mean he was sick? Explain, Snape!"</p><p>Severus did not but deferred to the Healer in their midst. Poppy spoke, "Harry was suffering from an extreme bout of childhood pneumonia. His magic was unable to fight the illness because it had exhausted itself after facing a daily basis of healing the child. When Severus brought Harry to Hogwarts I was able to cure the pneumonia."</p><p>"There's more," Sirius said with concern. "Tell me, Poppy."</p><p>"The list is horrifying, Sirius," sighed Poppy. "Harry not only faced daily verbal abuse but he was beaten."</p><p>"Not daily, but still too often," added Severus quietly.</p><p>Poppy nodded, "I had to re-break bones that had healed improperly, and Severus formulated a Nutrition Potion to heal his malnutrition."</p><p>"I met Petunia once," sneered Sirius tiredly. "She was a harpy." He glanced up at Severus. "What aren't you saying about Petunia's husband, Snape? I gather he beat Harry but what else was there?"</p><p>"We discovered the bodies of two little girls that had been sexually abused, and then killed," Severus replied flatly. "They were both under the ages of six years. A boy was also... hurt... but he lived only because his parents moved away. The boy was four."</p><p>"Harry?" Sirius trembled with fear and anger.</p><p>Poppy replied and touched Sirius' restrained hand. "He was not touched in that manner, Sirius. We got to him in time."</p><p>"You still took Harry, though, Snape," Sirius accused but with caution this time.</p><p>Severus shook his head. "I did not have any intention of doing so but Harry was responding positively to me. He looked to me as his saviour..." Sirius snorted rudely and the Potions Master's lips thinned and his gaze narrowed. "Harry needed to feel safe around an adult, Black. I am the one that rescued him from under a bridge where he lay dying. He felt than as he does now, safe."</p><p>"So you're his big knight in black bat's clothing, Snape?" Sirius scoffed.</p><p>"Yes, Sirius, he is," Poppy declared firmly. "Harry also happens to love Severus as does he love Harry."</p><p>"That's impossible!" barked Sirius in denial. "Snape's a damn Slytherin and a Death..." Sirius froze as Severus showed both his forearms; smooth and free of any blemish.</p><p>Severus spoke coldly, "Not long after I adopted Harry the Dark Mark was removed. Voldemort has no hold over me."</p><p>Sirius struggled to sit up but his magical restraints kept him from doing so. "Poppy, take these off. I promise, I won't attack Snape."</p><p>Poppy glanced up at Severus, and when he nodded, she removed the restraints. Neither Poppy nor Sirius knew or could see that the Potions Master had his wand ready for a surprise attack from the man in the hospital bed. With a huff of relief Sirius moved to sit up. Once sitting he took a long look at the man he sincerely hated.</p><p>"I want to see Harry," demanded Sirius. "I want to know that he's fine."</p><p>Severus shook his head in the negative. "No. I am not allowing you near... my son."</p><p>"I am his godfather, Snape," growled Sirius.</p><p>Severus drew in a deep breath. "In the eyes of wizarding law, as both a prisoner and an ex-prisoner, you are no longer the godfather of one Harry Potter, my son, Harry Snape."</p><p>"I was innocent!" roared Sirius. "That's not fair! I never should have gone to Azkaban!"</p><p>"Not for the crime of killing Peter Pettigrew and in turn the Potters, Black," said Severus tautly. "However, if life were fair, your... friend... Remus Lupin would have been destroyed by the Ministry for the mauling of one Severus Snape." His voice hardened to the point that Sirius winced. "IF life were fair, you would be in Azkaban for four years if I had been mauled by a werewolf, or... for your entire life had I been killed." Severus made a bare movement and Sirius was caught by the restraints imprisoning him prone against the bed. The vengeful wizard leaned over Sirius. "Life. Is not. Fair."</p><p>Severus spun on the toe of his right foot and left the hospital room. He glided and did not even slam the door when he left. Poppy returned her attention to Sirius when he jerked loudly against his restraints. He looked up at the Hogwarts Healer mournfully.</p><p>"Poppy, you knew Jamie and Lily. They wouldn't want this. I'm Harry's godfather," Sirius pleaded.</p><p>"Sirius, James and Lily would want their son to be safe and happy. He is," she insisted calmly.</p><p>"With Snape?"</p><p>"With Severus," she nodded. "Listen to me, Sirius." Poppy spoke slowly. "Harry. Loves. Severus. If you speak against Severus, hurt Severus, or try to separate them, the only one you will irrevocably hurt is Harry. Be James and Lily's best friend. Think... clearly... of what their son is feeling and what he wants. Support him and you will gain the love of a beautiful, little boy."</p><p>Slowly Sirius nodded. What Poppy was saying to him made sense. He wanted Harry to not only like him but to love him. "But, Poppy, it's Snape. We... we hate each other."</p><p>"Yes. You both do. However, neither of you are children. Are you?" Sirius shook his head. "You have to accept that everything that Severus has done has been for the health, welfare, and happiness of Harry." Her voice held quiet strength as she finished her speech. "Harry is all that matters, Sirius. Whatever you and Severus harbour for each other no longer matters. Grow up."</p><p>The Hogwarts Healer began to turn away but Sirius stopped her by countering, "Tell Snape to grow up!"</p><p>Poppy, a hand on the doorknob, looked over her shoulder, and smiled. "Severus has grown up, Sirius." With a nod, she left.</p>

  <strong>20 August 1985 - St. Mungo's Janus Thickey Ward</strong>
</p><p>Healer Ascel Witt finished his morning Diagnostic Spell on his patient, Sirius Black, and smiled. "The Nutrition Potions are doing very well, Mr. Black. You have gained three pounds."</p><p>Sirius grimaced and looked down the open neck of his pyjamas at his thin chest. He touched his ribs through the pyjama top. "I can't stand this room, Witt. When can I get out of here?"</p><p>Healer Witt drew in a long breath. "I believe until this weekend, Mr. Black. Then, you'll have access to the Roof Garden and our Exercise Room." Ascel smiled in order to encourage his patient.</p><p>Sirius ignored the cheer of his Healer and fell back against the many pillows in his bed. "I want to see Moony. Erâ¦ Remus Lupin. I want to be sure he doesn't hate me."</p><p>Healer Witt nodded. "Mr. Lupin just sent an inquiry this morning, Mr. Black. I see no reason why he could not visit. I'll arrange a visit for this afternoon."</p>
<hr/><p>The days at St. Mungo's were easier for Sirius after Remus began visiting. The first few days were tense as they both recalled school-hood, and that fateful day when Sirius played his "prank" that nearly killed Severus Snape and his best friend Remus. Apologies were made, that Remus deemed genuine, and the two began the renewal of their friendship.</p><p>
  <strong>18 October 1985 - Friday, Roof Garden of St. Mungo's</strong>
</p><p>Sirius and Remus walked side by side along the path of polished stone embedded in the earth of the Roof Garden that covered the roof of St. Mungo's. It was a popular place for staff and patients. Sirius, who had not been discharged from St. Mungo's yet, viewed it as his daily bit of freedom.</p><p>"I never asked, Padfoot, do you get the Daily Prophet to read?" asked Remus.</p><p>Sirius shook his head. "My Mind Healer Jo Brothers says that, but for you, outside news is too stimulating for my brain." the wizard snorted his belief in that.</p><p>"Padfoot, Healer Brothers has a point especially with every article that shows up that mentions Harry, Snape or the Malfoys." He glanced sideways at his friend and quirked a smile at him. "You do get rather heated."</p><p>Sirius shrugged. "It just is all unbelievable to me, Moony. Harry's in the middle of Death Eaters that are really not and I'm no longer his godfather even though I am innocent."</p><p>"At least you can talk about it all, Padfoot. Beforeâ¦" Remus' voice trailed off.</p><p>Sirius grimaced. "I can see the reason for the my Bound Magic." He stopped walking and turned to fully face Remus. "It doesn't help that you get to visit Harry."</p><p>"And Neville, Padfoot. Harry very clearly loves Neville as his brother. When Snape adopted him it only validated that for him," recalled Remus.</p><p>"And Neville," smiled Sirius.</p><p>The two men continued their walk until they reached an area of the Roof Garden Sirius truly enjoyed the most; the Crown. The Crown had been given the name as years passed. It was, for a place over a hospital, well named. If one pictured St. Mungo's as the body the Roof Garden was the head. Thus, the clearing of lush grass unfettered by trees, flowers, and bushes, was the Crown of the Head.</p><p>Upon sight of the Crown Sirius gave a sigh and morphed into his Animagus form, a shaggy, black dog the size of the benighted Grim. As Padfoot, the dog, gamboled all over the Crown, Remus sat down on a bench he conjured for his comfort.</p><p>Watching his friend bounce, yip and bark, Remus was taken back to those days of childhood in Hogwarts. Those days when the Marauders of Gryffindor were just a group of popular boys, making eyes at the girls in between going to classes and eating in the Great Hall. He hoped that James and Lily were watching over he and Sirius. They had to know that Sirius was innocent of their murders, andâ¦ Padfoot was happy.</p><p>Padfoot ran over to Remus and dropped a red ball into his best friend's lap. He then sat with his big, brushy tail wagging against the ground. Remus picked up the ball. "Where did you find this?"</p><p>Padfoot simply barked and wagged his tail harder. Remus chuckled and then tossed the ball lightly over the head of the Animagus. Padfoot jumped, nearly flipped and ran/bounced over to get the ball. For several minutes the mindless game became Zen-like for both participants until a suitably played out Sirius returned to his human form and thumped down upon the bench beside Remus.</p><p>"Tell me how Harry and Neville are, Moony," Sirius demanded.</p><p>"Very well. I haven't visited them after the big news but I'm hoping you can join me," teased Remus knowingly.</p><p>Sirius sat up. "What big news? You think Albus and Snape will finally let me meet Harry? What's been going on?"</p><p>"The end of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named," intoned Remus.</p><p>"I thought Harry alreadyâ¦"</p><p>"His Ka, his soul, came back and was living in the Chamber of Secrets. The Ka was gaining strength by siphoning magic from all of the students. Albus, Severus, Lucius Malfoy and I put up a ward to block the Ka from the students and it was Severus who dealt the killing blow to what was left of the Ka after it was severely weakened," explained Remus.</p><p>Both were silent as Sirius stared at Remus and tried to understand everything his friend had said. Finally he whispered, "Voldemort's dead?"</p><p>"Yes, Padfoot."</p><p>"He's dead. Gone for good?" Sirius drew in a breath and held it.</p><p>Remus grasped his friend's shoulder. "He is gone for good and he will never return." To Remus' surprise Sirius broke down into tears. But, only for a moment. The wizard returned to his form as Padfoot and loped away from Remus as he ran and bounced.</p><p>It was over. Sirius was truly free and able to live now.</p><p>Sirius burst back into his human form and gracefully skidded upon his knees to his friend. "Moony! I want to see Harry now."</p>
