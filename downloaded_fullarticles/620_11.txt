    <p>Since Sam's Second Year, shit has always gone down at Hogwarts. He soon came to realize that said shit always revolves around, or mostly affects, the three Gryffindors a class under him and those they associate with. Since this revelation, he has done his absolute best to remain completely uninvolved with that mess. It would be a lot easier if each of his brief, unintentional interactions with the Boy Who Lived that happen every once in a terrible while weren't so pleasant. </p><p>    This would also be a lot easier if everyone around him didn't regularly communicate with the main group or their immediate connections. He'd gone so far in his attempt to stay away, that he'd essentially sworn off any of their acquaintances as well. This makes friendship hard. Due to this, Sam has two sure friends: Talbot Ferral, who's too spiteful to care about anything, and Jerry Baker, who's too high to ever know what to care about. </p><p>    Join him in his doomed-to-fail plan to escape the shitshow that is attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with Harry Potter and his Crew as a classmate.</p>
