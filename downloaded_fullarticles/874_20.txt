    <p>The owl landed on Harry heavily, talons sinking into his bare chest. </p><p>“Ugh…not again Horace,” Harry groaned, mind unfocused, his foggy brain still awakening from a heavy sleep. “We’ve talked about this.” </p><p>The tiger owl hooted primly in reply, tufts raised in what could only be assumed as judgment. For the millionth time, Horace reminded Harry of a stodgy butler always ready with a dry retort. As if he could read his mind, Horace dug his talons deeper into Harry’s chest. </p><p>“Oi, ger’ off me,” Harry shooed. Horace ignored this, instead stubbornly choosing to stick a leg out at Harry. </p><p>“Fine, I’ll take it,” Harry growled, sitting up on one elbow. He undid the tie linking the parchment to Horace’s leg, at which point the owl immediately flew off. “Bloody menace,” Harry muttered as he reached the nightstand for his glasses, wincing as he stretched his arm. He rubbed the sleep out of his bleary eyes and inspected the source of his pain. It wasn’t where the sodding bird had dug its claws, but rather, the large, deep purple bruise coating the length of his left ribs, courtesy of his latest assignment. It seemed like Britain would never be rid of Dark Wizards. Harry yearned for a day that he did not wake up with some new bodily ache. </p><p>One could dream. </p><p>With a sigh, Harry finally unrolled the parchment. He instantly recognized the neat, compact script of one Minerva McGonagall. </p><p>“Dear Mr. Potter,” it started. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I am writing to you in the hopes that you can assist me with a rather serious dilemma. It seems that I am out a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor for this upcoming term.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> As you may well know, this position has been rather volatile—there hasn’t been a single professor that has lasted more than one year in decades. I thought that perhaps this last professor would finally break the cycle, and indeed it seemed that way up until about a week ago when I received word that she is in a family way. While I am indeed quite thrilled for Mrs. Angelina Wood and of course, Oliver, her decision to focus on building her new family has thrown a wrench into my perfectly ordered plans for the new term. Being that it starts in a week, I am quite vexed as to where I am going to find a suitable replacement if you decide to decline my offer. Yes, Mr. Potter—I am offering you this position. I cannot think of anyone more appropriate for the role. And while I am completely aware of your rising star in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, I do not think taking a year’s sabbatical to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts would impede your career in the long term, since I highly doubt you’ll last past that.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> It would be a great honor to have you and you would be doing Hogwarts a great service – yet again. Please consider my offer and respond post haste. I am truly at my wit’s end. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Kindest regards, </em>
</p><p><br/>
<em>Minerva McGonagall </em><br/>
<em>Headmistress </em><br/>
<em>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat there, mouth agape, reading and re-reading the words. </p><p>What were the odds? </p><p> </p><p>*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>“I have news,” Hermione announced mysteriously as she put a half-eaten chip back into her basket.</p><p>They were reconvened at their weekly Wednesday lunch, one of their favorite standing traditions. Though, not to be outdone by weekly Friday night drinks, and weekly Sunday suppers at the Burrow, and while not a weekly tradition by any means although it might as well be—Thursday afternoon tea. </p><p>No wonder they were all single.</p><p>“I have news as well,” Harry interjected, nursing his ale. He felt relaxed and at peace with his decision, and couldn’t wait to drop the bomb on his best mates. </p><p>“Oh, you go first,” Hermione conceded. “I’m sure it’s more interesting.”</p><p>“No, Hermione, I don’t want to steal your thunder,” Harry responded, thinking it must be something about her dissertation. He knew she was close to deciding her topic.</p><p>“Oh, for bloody sakes, one of you go,” Ron said with an eye roll. </p><p>“Fine,” Harry agreed, having already been bursting at the seams to tell them. “I’m taking a sabbatical from the DMLE. McGonagall offered me the job of Defense professor at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Ron and Hermione both dropped their forks with a clatter. </p><p>“You’re joking,” Hermione said, eyes wide. </p><p>Harry looked affronted. “What, know anyone else who’s defeated the evilest wizard of all time?” </p><p>“No, it’s not that,” Hermione said delicately. “Of course, you’re more than qualified—you may even be the best Defense professor Hogwarts will ever have after Dumbledore. It’s just that, well,” Hermione’s eyes grew bright. “I’m going to be the Hogwarts librarian for the next term! That was my news.”</p><p>It was Harry’s turn to look surprised. “What? McGonagall didn’t mention that at all in her note. When did this happen?”</p><p>Hermione beamed. “About a week ago! Minerva and I were having lunch and—” </p><p>Ron interrupted, his mouth still half full of chips. “Wait a second—you were having <em>lunch</em> with <em>Professor McGonagall</em>?”</p><p>Hermione glared at him. “Thank you for that interruption, Ronald,” she huffed. “May I continue or do you have anything else to add before you finish chewing?”</p><p>Before Ron could say anything, Harry kicked him under the table. </p><p>“Ow!” He glowered at Harry but remained otherwise silent.  </p><p>“As I was saying before I was <em>disrupted</em>,” she chanced another glare at Ron, making Harry grin. “Yes, <em>Minerva</em> and I have lunch now and then. She’s been helping me narrow down the topic for my dissertation, and now that I have, she suggested that the Hogwarts library would be a wonderful resource and a rather peaceful environment for me to focus on my work. And since Madame Pince is finally retiring, the stars aligned for me to be able to take up the post—for the year, at least, while I finish my doctoral and Minerva can find a more permanent replacement. When did Minerva contact you, Harry?”</p><p>“I got the owl this morning,” Harry replied, absentmindedly rubbing the spot on his chest where Horace had landed. “I wrote back telling her that I accepted immediately, and waltzed right into the office this morning to announce my sabbatical. Kingsley had a conniption fit.” Harry looked pleased as plum by this. </p><p>“You’re not afraid this will hinder your career?” Ron asked, almost as if he were surprised at himself to be asking such a thoughtful question. </p><p>“Says the man who quit the Academy to help run his brother’s shop,” Hermione countered. </p><p>“Oi you know my arm isn’t the same anymore, after the splinch,” Ron said defensively. “Aurors have to be impeccably fit, and unfortunately, I did not make the cut.” </p><p>“Hemione, if you roll your eyes any more they’ll stay that way permanently,” Harry teased.</p><p>Hermione flipped her long brown hair over her shoulder. “Harry, I’m glad you’re taking some time off,” she said earnestly. “You deserve a break. You’ve been fighting Dark Wizards literally since you were one. You’re twenty-five. Besides,” she added with a smirk, “we all know the promotion at the DMLE will be there waiting for you when you return.” </p><p> </p><p>*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, you’ve remembered to pack your spare set of glasses?” Ron asked fretfully as he stood on the edge of Platform 9 ¾, which was abuzz with all of the excited students returning for a new term. “You both promise you’ll write every day?”</p><p>“Yes mum,” Harry responded with a grin. Ron was literally becoming Molly Weasley before his very eyes. </p><p>Hermione reached out and enveloped Ron in a big hug. “Oh, honestly Ron, Hogwarts is not that much farther away than Dublin and it’s not like we became estranged while I was at the Institute,” she added pragmatically. “I’m sure you’ll visit often enough. Maybe George’ll let you run the Hogsmeade shop for a bit so we can be closer together?”</p><p>“I’m working on it,” Ron replied, patting her on the back. “Can’t get rid of me that easily.”</p><p>“Merlin knows we’ve been trying for years now, right Harry?” Hermione responded cheekily.</p><p>Harry shook his head, grinning. He was going to miss watching them banter; it provided a never-ending source of amusement.</p><p>The train sounded its last call. “Hermione, we’ve better hurry and find a compartment before they’re all taken,” Harry suggested. “I don’t know if I can stand the silence of a handful of terrified first-years just yet.” </p><p>Hermione glared at him. “Then you should have <em>floo’d</em> to Hogsmeade. They’re <em>your students</em> now, Harry! Honestly, I don’t know why I even bother with either of you…” Hermione stalked away toward the train, grumbling under her breath. </p><p>“She’s yours now,” Ron said with a contented sigh.</p><p>“We’ll miss you too, mate,” Harry said. “Watch over Teddy for me?” Being this far away from Teddy was the one major pain-point of his decision to teach at Hogwarts, but he promised the boy he’d visit at least once a month, and Andromeda assured that she’d bring him up to visit as well.</p><p>“You know I will. He spends more time at the Burrow than he does in his own home anyway—Mum is definitely feeling her empty nest!”</p><p>“Thanks, mate. See you soon!” Harry called out as he chased after Hermione. </p><p> </p><p>*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>The train ride to Hogwarts proved uneventful. Well, uneventful considering the constant stream of faces casually pressing themselves to the glass doors of their compartment, and the loudly hushed whispers of students proclaiming their various theories. </p><p>“Harry Potter is on the train—he’s here in this compartment. I heard he’s the new Defense professor.”</p><p>“Oh really, I heard he’s the new Headmaster—taking over for McGonagall. He’ll be the youngest Headmaster Hogwarts has ever had!”</p><p>“I was told that he is undercover trying to unmask an evil plot that’s afoot at the school…it’s why Madame Pince was sacked. She was embroiled and was caught.”</p><p>He pretended to read the paper as he listened, smirking. Hermione had immediately passed out the second the train began rolling. She was curled up gracefully in the seat across him, one arm underneath her head, the other still clutching a book—<em>Magical Water Plants of the Highland Lochs </em>by<em> Hadrian Whittle</em>. It occurred to Harry that he still didn’t know what her dissertation focus was.</p><p>Harry peeked out the window and watched as the towers of Hogwarts castle came into view.</p><p>
  <em>Home. </em>
</p><p>He was looking forward to spending his first peaceful year at Hogwarts. He didn’t return for his seventh year, rightfully feeling his time as a student had ended, despite Hermione’s protestations. A part of him had also been afraid, at the time, that too much had happened—he’d seen too many of his loved ones die within the castle walls for him to be able to focus on anything but those painful memories. But now, enough time had passed, and he felt thoroughly that this was the right thing to do, the right step to take. Perhaps he’d even gain some closure he didn’t know he needed. </p><p>He gently shook Hermione awake. “Hermione, luv, we’re about there.” </p><p>She moaned a protest but blinked her eyes open nonetheless. “Harry—why’d you let me fall asleep? I’ll be up all night now!” </p><p>Harry smiled. “After the ridiculous feast, we’re about to eat? You’ll be comatose.” </p><p> </p><p>*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>Harry was right. After the feast, he could barely drag Hermione up the moving stairs. Led by Neville, current Professor of Herbology, they navigated their way through the crowds of students being escorted to their dormitories by the House Prefects. Upon seeing Harry, the students dutifully parted for him. You’d think that by now he’d be used to the long stares and awed looks, but they still made him somewhat self-conscious. </p><p>“Just like old times, eh Harry?” Neville said good-naturedly. </p><p>He led them down what had once been the forbidden third-floor corridor, and through a large set of doors that led into an unfamiliar wing of the castle. </p><p>After all the after-hours adventuring he’d done, Hogwarts could still surprise him. </p><p>“This is where your rooms are,” Neville informed them. “This whole area is spelled so that only staff can come through here. McGonagall didn’t want crowds of students loitering around in front of your room, Harry, asking for autographs before breakfast each morning,” he said jovially. “Reckon she made a good call.” </p><p>Neville led them to a portrait of a Medieval witch wearing a black conical headpiece and stern look on her face. “Password?” she asked, with an air that indicated she already disliked the lot standing before her. </p><p>“Caveat Lector,” Neville replied. The portrait swung open. “After you,” Neville motioned to Hermione.</p><p>Hermione stepped through first, followed by Neville. They were now in what can only be assumed to be a small, cozy common room. “This is your common room,” Neville confirmed. “Hermione, your private rooms are up those stairs,” he said, pointing to a spiral staircase on the right side of the room. “Harry, yours are there,” he pointed to an identical staircase on the left-hand side. “Currently only we three know your password, but the portrait has standing orders to change it every week so you best make sure you’re communicating with her. She’s awfully temperamental and loves attention, so I recommend you always treat her with politeness and civility. Ask her how her day is going, and all that.” </p><p>Harry turned to look at Hermione who’d remained surprisingly silent during their walk through the castle. “I think she’s about to keel over,” he whispered to Neville. </p><p>“Right, it’s late, and tomorrow we've got an early start. I should get going,” Neville said. “Want to join me and Hannah for lunch in our quarters tomorrow? I’m sure she’d love you both to pop around.”</p><p>“I’d love that, Neville,” Hermione smiled at him sleepily. </p><p>“Err…yes, of course, count us in,” Harry added.</p><p>Neville disappeared behind the portrait hole. </p><p>“I’m knackered,” Hermione half-yawned. “I think I’m going upstairs and passing out. You?”</p><p>Harry sighed. “I should start devising lesson plans,” he said sheepishly. </p><p>For a second, all the exhaustion left Hermione’s eyes, replaced with exasperation. But then she yawned again, and the look was gone. “Honestly, at this point, this is no longer my battle,” she mumbled to herself as she began climbing up the spiral staircase that led to her room. “This is no longer my concern, he is a grown man, he can handle this himself...” </p><p>“Good night!” he called out to her with a grin. </p><p> </p><p>*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>Harry startled in his sleep, the sudden feeling of something extremely cold sitting on his bare chest. “Horace?” he mumbled sleepily. “If that’s you again I’m going to fry you in the fireplace and have you for supper.” </p><p>Instead of the usual indignant hoot, he felt a second sensation of something equally frigid against the side of his right calf. He turned on his side.</p><p>“Hermione.” </p><p>There she was, nestled up against him, eyes wide and brightly illuminated by the moon shining through his window. “I couldn’t sleep.”</p><p>Harry groaned. “Did you also transfigure yourself into an icicle?” he asked, suddenly recognizing the cold sensations as her hands and feet. </p><p>Hermione unabashedly snuggled closer. “I’m freezing, and you are sooo warm,” she sighed contentedly against him. “Please don’t make me get up and walk back to my room. I’ll help you with your lesson plans.” </p><p>Harry sighed and turned into her, pulling her closer and placing his hand on top of hers where it sat against his chest. “Fine, but you better let me sleep now. We can get up early and look over what I’ve come up with so far.” </p><p>“Is it Expelliarmus? Is that what you’ve come up with?”</p><p>“Go. To. Sleep.” Harry commanded with irritation. He didn’t want to admit that she was right. </p><p>
  <em>Curse her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>The next morning when he woke up, she was already gone. He put on a dressing robe, intent on finding her and making sure she honored her promise of helping him with lesson plans – at least just for this week, while he got his bearings. He went downstairs to their common area and found her there, sitting on a couch with a book in her hand, long bare legs extended casually out from beneath the oversized sleeping shirt she wore. The sunlight was pouring in through the tall windows, illuminating her and the veritable breakfast feast that was spread out on the coffee table before her—tea, eggs on toast, porridge, fruit, jams, muffins, and oatcakes.</p><p>“The House Elves heard you’re here,” Hermione motioned to the breakfast display. </p><p>“Well, wouldn’t want to disappoint them,” Harry said, sitting down in an armchair across from her and preparing himself a plate. “I could get used to this. Dinner in the Great Hall was wonderful and all, but would love the occasional meal where I’m not being gawked at while I stuff my face.” </p><p>Hermione dropped her book and looked at him sympathetically. “They’ll get over it eventually. It’ll pass. They’re teenagers. As soon as they settle and their love lives start going bonkers, they’ll completely forget about who you are and cease seeing you as anything other than another annoying professor they have to turn in inches to.” </p><p>“Gee, what a pleasant pep talk,” Harry said dryly. “You’re lucky you’re just going to be the overbearing shrew librarian that constantly shushes everyone, and don’t have to actually teach them anything.”</p><p>Hermione threw her book at him. “When you’re done with breakfast, come find me upstairs so we can go over your plans for the day, <em>Professor</em>.” And with that, she hopped right off the couch and stalked upstairs to her rooms. </p><p> </p><p>*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>After breakfast, Harry went upstairs to his room to shower and dress for the day. He wasn’t the type of person who fussed overly much about his appearance, but he assumed he might at least try to be presentable and make a good impression on his students. He wanted to give off an air of authority, but not so imperious that it would terrify—he already received enough awed looks as it was. </p><p>He chose to nod to his house and wear a light burgundy jumper over his white collared shirt and grey trousers. He gleefully thought of all the house points he’d be graciously gifting to Gryffindor—he’d give Dumbledore a run for his galleons! Maybe he’d even volunteer to help train the Quidditch team? Training wouldn’t hurt—Merlin knew he’d have to keep up his Auror endurance, and this would prove quite difficult what with a kitchen full of House Elves who worshipped him.</p><p>“Stop fussing—you look great!” said his mirror, encouragingly. </p><p>Feeling chipper, Harry practically whistled as he made his way to Hermione’s room, lesson plan drafts in hand. He even remembered to stop and pick up the book she’d chucked at him—<em>Magical Water Plants of the Highland Lochs </em>by<em> Hadrian Whittle. </em>She had been completely engrossed in the book when he found her this morning—how interesting could it possibly be?</p><p>As he climbed her spiral staircase, he was half afraid he would be thrown off with a similar ward to the girls’ dormitories in Gryffindor tower, but alas Professors seemed to be given more liberties. He knocked on her door and patiently waited to be let in. </p><p>“Door’s open!” he heard a muffled yell from within.</p><p>He let himself in to find a room very similar to his own; large four-poster, cozy sitting area, a writing area, and Merlin’s thumbs—did she get a balcony?</p><p>Bloody McGonagall!</p><p>“I’ve got your book,” Harry said, throwing it onto her bed.</p><p>“What’s that look on your face?” Hermione asked distractedly as she ran past him, wrapped snuggly in a towel. Her hair was done up in a neat bun, and a glance into the open door of her bathroom was enough to realize she’d been in there taming it with a bottle of Sleakeazy’s. </p><p>“Oh, I was just fuming at the fact that you get a balcony and I don’t. Care to trade rooms?”</p><p>“I’ll pass,” Hermione replied, disappearing behind a black partition decorated with an image of a satyr and dancing nymphs. “Hand me that dress on my bed, will you? I’m bloody running late! I’m supposed to be meeting with Minerva.”</p><p>Harry dutifully reached over and passed her the dress which she took, only to replace with her towel. “Would you mind throwing that into my bathroom please?” </p><p>Harry obediently took the towel to her bathroom, stopping to admire the ordered mess of Hermione’s morning routine. “WHAT? You also get a claw-foot bathtub?” Harry yelled.</p><p>She stepped out from behind the partition and glared at him as he re-entered her room. “Do not start with me right now Harry Potter or I swear you will have nothing but Expelliarmus to rely on.”</p><p>“Not like I didn’t defeat the Dark Lord with that spell,” Harry said, grinning.</p><p>“Oh, do shut up and help me with this zipper,” she asked, turning around and pointing to her dress, which was still undone. He could see the top of her white lace knickers and matching bra peeking out. </p><p>The dress itself was a deep navy blue, conservative in that it was high collared, long-sleeved, and ran down slightly past her knees, but was fitted so perfectly against her that it looked like a second skin. There was a jaunty little ribbon to the side along the collar. </p><p>“Listen luv, are you trying to cultivate a mob of enamored teenagers?” he asked as he finished zipping her up. </p><p>“What are you talking about?” </p><p>“That dress.” He watched, with mild amusement, as she ungraciously slipped on some sheer stockings and a pair of demure black heels. </p><p>“What of it?” Hermione looked up at him from where she was still trying to straighten her stockings.</p><p>“It’s…” Harry couldn’t quite pinpoint the word he wanted to use. </p><p>Hermione sighed in exasperation. “It’s a high-collared long-sleeved pencil dress! You’ve seen me wear this a hundred times!” </p><p>Had he? He didn’t think he had, but then again, he was often around Hermione surrounded by a cacophony of friends where ample food and ale were present—hardly conducive to really noticing what anyone was wearing. This was also the first time he was considering this from the lens of her potential effect on his students—otherwise known as the hormonal teenage populace of Hogwarts.  </p><p>“Listen, Hermione, I was sixteen once. All I’m saying is that—”</p><p>“What, had Madame Pince worn this you would have been wanking to thoughts of her every night?”</p><p>Harry laughed. “I mean I’m sure she would have looked great in it, but there’s a world of difference in terms of how fanciable you are versus Madame Pince.” </p><p>“Harry, yes you were sixteen once, and you knew me at sixteen. You’ve seen me in all manner of dress and undress and you weren’t running around wanking everywhere were you?”</p><p>“No, but—” </p><p>“Then I’m sure the students will be fine. Besides, who would fancy the overbearing shrew librarian that constantly shushes everyone?” she said with a smirk. “Now stop worrying about my attire and show me your dismal lessons.”</p><p> </p><p>*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s first day as Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor flew by in a whirlwind. He hadn’t yet taught any first years, but the second through fourth years he’d had were a great barometer as to where everyone currently was in their proficiency. The lack of structure and revolving door of Defense professors was indeed an issue, as it had been when he was still at school, but in the last year, Angelina had at least brought some structure to the coursework. Her curriculum was similar to Lupin’s in that she focused on practical defense, but was severely lacking in combat defense, which was Harry’s strength and what he would focus on this term.</p><p>It was now close to dinnertime and he thought he’d find Hermione so they could go together. </p><p>When he entered the library, it was practically empty, it being late and barely the first day of studies. He smirked, however, at the sight of a table full of sixth- and seventh-year boys. They were definitely there studying, though it wasn’t their textbooks, which remained closed, littering their table. Instead, their focused little eyes were trained on one Hermione Granger, who was standing on a ladder perusing a shelf that, to what Harry knew from memory, was devoted to tomes regarding Lycanthropy. He’d spent more than enough time in those stacks when Snape made them write that ridiculous essay during his third year. </p><p>Her hair was slowly falling loose from her bun in little curls around the nape of her neck, and her elevated perch atop the ladder provided a prime view of her shapely legs, and to Harry’s dismay—the clearly outlined shape of her bum through the delicate fabric of the dress. </p><p>
  <em>These idiots were lustily staring at her bum! </em>
</p><p>“Good evening gentleman,” Harry said sternly as he pounced upon the table of hormonal teens. “What subject are we studying tonight? Is there something I can help you with?” He gleamed with pleasure at the way each boy’s face began turning into various shades of puce.</p><p>"No, Mr. Harry Potter, <em>Sir</em>, we were just leaving,” gulped a sandy-haired Hufflepuff. </p><p>“Yes, it’s almost dinner time,” piped up a brunette Ravenclaw. “We should leave. <em>Now</em>.” </p><p>The boys wasted no time in gathering their belongings and rushing out of there. Hermione, oblivious to the entire exchange, was now leaning against the bookshelf engrossed in a tome. Harry walked over to her. </p><p>“You missed lunch at the Longbottoms,” he said, startling her to the point where she lost balance and landed right into his arms with a shriek. </p><p>“Are you mad, Harry?! Don’t sneak up on a person when they’re on a ladder,” she chided, eyes glaring.</p><p>“Caught you, didn’t I, my little Snitch?” he grinned. </p><p>She rolled her eyes. “You can put me down now.” </p><p>He gently dropped her back onto her feet, surprised at how much shorter she seemed, even with the heels. </p><p>"Did you shrink or something?” he asked quizzically. </p><p>She looked up at him, brown eyes twinkling. “No, you jerk, I’m still the same height I’ve always been. You just finally finished growing into your full six feet.” </p><p>“How tall are you, exactly?” he asked, surprised he didn’t already know this about his best mate. Ron was 6'2. He knew this because Ron <em>always</em> brought it up. </p><p>"5'3. 5'5 in these,” she said pointing at her shoes. </p><p>“You’re tiny.”</p><p>“And you’re exasperating. How was lunch with the Longbottoms?” she asked. She flicked her wand at various books that littered the tables around the room, banishing them to their rightful place as she walked back toward her desk. </p><p>Harry followed. “Lovely. They missed you. You could have sent a fire message or a Patronus.” </p><p>Hermione began to gather her belongings in a bag. “I know and I’ll apologize—I just got so distracted with my dissertation! I found the perfect resource and I’ve been reading all day and making notes—it’s just what I needed to get me started. I don’t think I’ve gotten the chance to tell you what I am focusing on at all,” she said beaming. </p><p>“It’s about Lycanthropy,” Harry said, pointing at the shelf where the ladder was still propped up. </p><p>Hermione grinned. “You’re absolutely right, well recalled Harry—” the rest of her sentence was interrupted by the loud grumbling of her stomach. </p><p>“Did you even eat lunch today?” Harry asked with a flash of annoyance. </p><p>“Er…I think Winky may have brought me some tea and crumpets at one point in the afternoon,” she said sheepishly. “Though I honestly don’t remember whether I finished it.”</p><p>That did it. Harry clasped his hand in hers and pulled her toward the hallway. “Tell me all about your dissertation in the Great Hall later, and after dinner.” </p><p> </p><p>*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>It was thus how Harry found himself once again in bed with Hermione pressed against him. She was sitting up with Harry’s head on her bosom, where he was enjoying having his head scratched while listening to her re-explain her thesis. </p><p>“So, let me get this straight,” Harry asked trying to make sense of the dissertation Hermione had spent a better part of the evening describing. “You’re arguing that the marginalization and mistreatment of werewolves in public society has a quantifiable negative impact on Wizarding Britain’s economy and public safety, and outlining a three-pronged plan to socialize the Wolfsbane potion?” It wouldn’t be half as difficult to wrap his mind around it if she weren’t slowly lulling him into a comfortable stupor with her gifted hands.</p><p>“Yes, if we socialized the potion and made it more broadly available to the Lycanthrope populace, we would be able to integrate werewolves more fully into society,” Hermione recited vehemently. “The Remus Lupins of the world, good, kind-hearted people who were placed into this circumstance without their consent, would no longer needlessly suffer the stigma of their condition. Once I pen this, I plan to work for the DRCMC, reopen the Werewolf Support office, and begin to lobby for full implementation.” Hermione said this with the air of someone completely confident in their ability to force something into existence through sheer will. Harry trusted that if anyone could tackle this controversial issue and succeed, it was her. He could clearly hear the furor in her voice, and his heart ached. If only Remus were around to help her with this and see it come to fruition. </p><p>“You’re amazing, Hermione,” Harry sighed gratefully. </p><p>She chuckled. “You’re only saying that because I’m scratching your head.”</p><p>“I mean, obviously,” Harry said with a grin. After a quiet moment, he sat up, clutching her hand in his and squeezing it tightly. “I’m being serious, though. However, I can help, let me know. You’ll have the full support of the DMLE.” </p><p>Hermione smiled. “I know I will, Head Auror Potter. I was already counting on it. Now let’s go to sleep. Let me put my feet between your calves again.” </p><p>Harry groaned, pulling the covers over his head in defeat. “Fine, but you have to promise not to miss post-dinner brandy at Hagrid’s tomorrow.” </p><p> </p><p>*~*~*</p>
