          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1">“Ginny will struggle to rejoin her housemates,” Professor McGonagall’s first words to Molly and Arthur didn’t sugar coat the situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She’s been withdrawn, taciturn and unpleasant to them for the last year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Academically she’s struggling; inside classes she is barely responsive and her homework is uncompleted for the most part.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could not confirm the few pieces she handed in as being her own work.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She paused to give them a few moments to take in her comments, “I cannot advise her progression to 2<span class="s1"><sup>nd</sup></span> year and as you know Hogwarts does not allow for years to be retaken. This year we are allowing students effected by the petrifactions to resit their exams on the 15th of July. They will need to get an average of 70% to pass and Ginny’s involvement will need to be made public to make her eligible.”</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Molly’s face paled and for once she didn’t speak leaving it to her husband to ask, “What do you suggest?”</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Professor McGonagal placed a number of pamphlets on the desk before responding. “Another school.”</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Looking down she quickly selected three and placed them in a neat line in front of her. “St George’s, London, not the best school but it allows day students. It may overly constrain her options and definitely won’t allow her to pursue an interest in Quidditch.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She handed the pamphlet to Arthur. “St Aiden’s, Lindsfarn; a good all round private school, with scholarship options.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their middle school starts the year after Hogwarts so she wouldn’t be out of place. Middle school students are expected to board for the week but they are willing make an exception for Ginny’s circumstances.” The second pamphlet was handed to Molly. </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">She picked up the third running it through her hands long enough that Molly and Arthur had swapped leaflets and seemed ready to start debating the two schools before she started speaking again. “Madame Dorothea’s, York.” She paused again, “Another private school, with scholarship options.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No more limited than St George’s.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another pause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She pushed the leaflet across the table. “It would be an injustice to the child to send her to Madame Dorothea’s but she is eligible.”</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">“What’s wrong with Madame Dorothea’s?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Molly asked.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">“It’s a finishing school for young pureblood ladies.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Professor McGonagall answered disdain dripping from her words.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">“Not a good match for our Ginny.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Arthur said wryly placing the pamphlet back on the desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you for your help.”</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">“You aren’t the first parents I’ve had to suggest a change of scene to.” Professor McGonagall said, “I’m sorry we failed in our duty to Ginny.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would appreciate it if you let me know of your decision.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She stood to show them out, “If you need any more help please don’t hesitate to get in contact.”</p>
