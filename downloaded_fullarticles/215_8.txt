    <p>I know you don’t know me, and this first A/N is going to be pretty heavy and I know some people won’t believe me, but I think it’s important that I share these things so that you understand before you go further. Of course you can obviously skip this, but then be prepared to not know what I might be referencing later.</p><p> </p><p>   I've had a lot of s**t happen to me in my life. Good and bad. Someone described me as the luckiest unlucky person they’ve ever met and that is probably the most accurate description of me I’ve ever heard.</p><p> </p><p>    I'm the youngest of 5 kids. I’m a girl. My two eldest siblings (let’s call them 1 and 2) had their own stuff going by the time I was really mobile and the next two (3 and 4) had bonded super close. None of them really wanted this little kid following them around. So my  3 and 4 thought up this funny joke. They convinced me at about age five or six, that if I didn’t come back exactly the same path I had taken previously, that I would be in an alternate universe where only bad things had happened. Like we'd lost our home, or a parent had died, or they didn’t know who I was. I have to admit it was original, and even now I’m a bit impressed with myself that at that age I actually understood it. But they kept it up for *years* and I utterly believed it. As an adult I can comprehend exactly how much of a negative impact it's had on my life, and I honestly have never been able to completely reconcile with them because they both refuse to acknowledge that they did anything wrong or that it had a negative impact. But have you ever tried to *exactly* retrace your path? It is literally impossible. I came to believe that every car accident, every mugging, every murder was my fault. Bad things only happened when I went the wrong way – right? So if bad things happened it must mean that I failed. Remember: this is kid logic here.</p><p> </p><p>    As I got a bit older it got worse because I could understand that even if I could retrace my steps exactly, I wouldn’t be passing the same people, or the same grass blades, eventually even the same air and atoms.</p><p> </p><p>    I couldn’t tell my parents because they had promised that if I did, Mom would die and she wouldn’t be able to be brought back by “fixing" my path. I believed them. I was a little kid.</p><p> </p><p>    I managed to find my way out of that mentality through my religion and realizing that if what they (3 and 4) said were actually true, then bad things would have been happening when I was a kid that didn’t happen. My parents eventually found out and were very appropriately furious, but the damage was done. It had instilled some habits into me that I am fighting to this day. One of which is that I freak out if I am ignored or unacknowledged when I interact. That was a favorite of 3 and 4 because I reacted so badly when they did it. Hilarious right? Medication helped stabilize me, but the OCD was firmly established as well as a massive guilt complex that I fight literally every day.</p><p> </p><p>    Mental issues run in my family – nothing major, and easily solved with the right meds, but mine was always hard to pin down. I must have gone through half a dozen diagnoses before I was ten (helped along by my neurosis about alternate dimensions and my guilt.) It wasn’t until I was in my twenties that I was finally diagnosed as having Asperger’s. Which in hindsight makes a ton of sense. But the fact is that this is probably why their game sunk in so far. I was already predisposed to OCD.</p><p> </p><p>    Believe it or not, this is not even the worst of it. Wait for it.</p><p> </p><p>    I’ve also had some medical issues that doctors never really gave me an answer to. I burn in the sun in under ten minutes. And even minor sunburns feel like I’m on fire. Worse burns hurt even more. Its literally gotten to the point where it feels like someone has ripped off my skin, rubbed me with salt and vinegar, doused me with gasoline and *then* set me on fire. And my absolute worst? My legs swelled to the near ripping point and I was put on adult dose pain meds and steroids and sedated for a week. I was 11. Needless to say I avoid the sun like a plague and I still sometimes end up crying into my pillow from pain from sunburns that I can’t avoid. And the doctors have never given me an answer as to why. It’s not like this is even new. I’ve had it all my life. As a *baby* I would burn in my bassinet, in long clothes, under a blanket, in a tent, and that tent is in shade of thick forest . Seriously. That actually happened.</p><p> </p><p>    Another is that I spontaneously get nosebleeds. Sometimes for no reason whatsoever. Very often during tests - school exams were a nightmare. I ended up having a box of kleenex on my desk and trying to hold one to my nosebleed while looking around it and doing everything one-handed. I got pretty adept at that. Other times it is when I get emotional. Angry, distressed, upset, even really happy. Bam. Nosebleed. I had one in my sleep once. I woke up looking like a murder victim with my hair matted with blood, my pillow soaked, and I was white as a sheet. My mom freaked.  I missed school for a week. Gengis Kahn supposedly died of a nosebleed. I can totally believe it.</p><p> </p><p>    I had a sledding accident as a kid where I landed on three inch thick ice on my back. I broke the ice. I got taken away by ambulance and I had a series of doctors going through my room all looking at the X-Rays, all in disbelief. Somehow I managed to not break anything, but I sprained, bruised, and nearly tore every single muscle and ligament in my entire back. Again, I was drugged up for a week from the pain. My back has never been the same.</p><p> </p><p>    And this still isn’t the worst.</p><p> </p><p>    I know if you’ve read to this part you’re wondering what the h**l could be the worst after all this (which is not all, just a few highlights. For example I also got run over by a horse - broken ribs and sternum are no joke. I also got a concussion from falling down a hill during a severe storm and hitting a tree. And another one from an accident in gym. I also accidentally ripped out a tooth as a kid on some chewy candy so badly and prematurely that the dentist needed to cauterize the wound to get it to stop bleeding. Seriously, that one was just screwed up.)</p><p> </p><p>    Here comes the worst:</p><p> </p><p>    Last December I had a stroke. I'm only in my early thirties and I had a stroke. I knew objectively that you could theoretically have them young, but I didn’t think it was likely. Like an abstract concept rather than reality. Seriously, do *you* really expect to have a stroke while watching tv? And did you know that there are different kinds? *I* didn’t!</p><p> </p><p>     About 98% of strokes hit the cerebrum which is where the FAST antonym comes in. Of course that means that 2% of strokes hit somewhere else and so don’t follow the typical signs. That 2% is when it hits the cerebellum or the brainstem. If it hits the brainstem, the death rate is really really high. The cerebellum isn’t as high but is nearly double the fatality rate as a cerebral stroke and it presents entirely differently. About it’s only signs are extreme vertigo – and I really mean *extreme*. It was like being on a tilt-a-whirl while on a ship that’s in the middle of a typhoon that just got thrown in the air and is tumbling back down, just to land and do it again. And it doesn’t stop. You can’t walk. You can barely even keep your balance to sit. Nothing helps. Needless to say there is epic vomiting. I couldn’t walk for nearly 3 days.</p><p> </p><p>    Ironically they found it really quickly because I’d had an MRI already scheduled because of worsening headaches. At first they thought it was a tumor. In contrast a stroke was the better diagnosis, which was good news. So I had a stroke, but it was the best type of stroke I could have with a better recovery rate than 98% of stroke victims. See? Luckiest unlucky.</p><p> </p><p>    I still have constant dizzy spells every day, some episodes of pretty severe vertigo – one that landed me in the hospital- and I have a collapsible cane in my purse now that I often need by the end of the day. I also have a tremor in one hand and some problems with things that they have no reason why, like I have problems with speaking that I didn’t have before and I start “skipping" while speaking, like repeating the same word over and over again. I also have a nearly constant ringing in my head that can get debilitatingly severe. Also head*pain* that is sometimes burning hot, sometimes very cold, and *always* very very ssevere. My ability to focus is fine, but my multitasking is now crap. If it is not directly in front of me, I will forget it in minutes, sometimes seconds. It’s very common now for me to be literally mid-sentence and to stop because I’ve forgotten my own point. I’ve now got extreme mood swings and that just makes all the problems worse.</p><p> </p><p>    Some of those the doctors don’t really know why I’ve got those from the stroke, but they can document that they are genuinely there.</p><p> </p><p>    I was a high heel girl before this and those days are now gone…</p><p> </p><p>    Of course then they went looking for *why* I got the stroke. And they found the tumor in my heart. It had sent out these fiber fine tendrils and one of them had broken off or thrown a clot. So then they needed to ascertain the heart tumor. One located in the very literal center of my heart where it would require full open heart surgery to get to it. Luckily it’s very small and its non-cancerous and is a type that is *very* slow growing. The damage from the surgery is potentially worse than the tumor might be, so they’re just watching it for now. They’re not sure why or how, but the tiny tendrils have broken down so that danger is gone now, but I’ll be getting heart scans for years to come now. Again: luckiest unlucky.</p><p> </p><p>    But I’m not done yet.</p><p> </p><p>    Remember that vertigo spell that put me in the hospital? They did an MRI and found – I kid you not, this is the very technical term they used at the time – a “smudge". So they did a second MRI on a better machine. It was still there. So they did it on a really specialized third MRI that specializes in looking at the veins that are the deepest in the brain. And it was still there, on one of the main veins that feed the brain, the basilar artery. Even with that MRI they can’t tell what it is. It could be a tiny tumor. It could be bad plaque build up. It could be an aneurism. All they know for sure is that it wasn’t there 6 months ago. In the end they’re just calling it an “anomaly” and are doing absolutely nothing, even while they stress that I should avoid strenuous activities. *ANYTHING* in that area is *bad*, worse if it’s something that developed in only six months.</p><p> </p><p>    To be fair they really can’t do anything without identifying it and they can’t. So best case scenario: it does absolutely nothing and goes away eventually. But it’s just as likely that if it’s a tumor, then it doesn’t matter if it’s non-cancerous. If it grows even a tiny bit it will put enough pressure on the vein to pinch it off. If it's plaque build-up, then it built up damn fast and if any of it breaks off it will likely stop up the vein. If it’s an aneurism, there is no way they can treat it and when it goes there is no way to repair it. In all 3 of those scenarios, it can kill me. And that’s not even the worst thing. If for any reason it doesn’t kill me, it will likely deprive my cerebellum and brainstem long enough to kill enough that “locked in syndrome” will occur and honestly? I’d actually prefer it to just straight up kill me over that. Go look it up. It makes it so the person loses the ability to move anything at all except for maybe a tiny bit of your eyes. There is *one* person - ***ONE*** - that has ever recovered and they are considered a medical miracle.</p><p> </p><p>    Can you even imagine a life like that? Not able to move, not speak, or even communicate. Well I have. I'm hoping to god it never happens, but the fact is that it’s not entirely impossible in my case. That possibility is in my chance-deck right now and I need to not just acknowledge it, but accept it and make some plans for if it does happen. I’ve been lucky all my life with bad things. I’m a little nervous that this time it’s not going to be there for me.</p><p> </p><p>    Which brings me to here and why I am posting anything.</p><p> </p><p>    I'm not much of a writer. I’ve tried for twenty years to write anything even passably decent. I’ve consistently failed. I can’t write the dialogue or the character development. Most times I can’t think of or plan a good villain or obstacle to overcome. But the divine irony is that I still can come up with great story ideas, I just can’t write them.</p><p> </p><p>    I’m always planning to try. I never ever do. Please don’t go: “You should write it yourself.” Any attempts I make rarely extend past one or two little scene. If I could write them I would have done so by now.</p><p> </p><p>    The fact is if the worst does happen, I don’t want those ideas to just vanish with me, so I’m putting them up here for others to possibly take up. I’m only putting up ideas that are genuinely fanfiction, as in based on an already established fandom with established characters. I have had ideas for actual original books, but I’m keeping them in my family for possibly one of them to write.</p><p> </p><p>    Some of the stories are more developed than others with clearly defined character development, plot points, and end points for the story. Some of them are more starting points for the idea and shape of an adventure. Some of them are very mature with full sex scenes and smut as part of the plot. Some of them can have it but it’s not critical for the story (though it would be nice). Some of them don’t need it at all.</p><p> </p><p>    I’ll try to keep each idea separate and in their own chapter. In the Titles will be the fandom, pairing, and maturity level so that people who don’t wish to visit mature themes can avoid them.</p><p> </p><p>    I’d like to finish with, that I’ve had to come to terms that not all writers are good people. Or honest. I know that sounds weird after I just spilled my guts but bear with me.</p><p> </p><p>    I was a fan of a certain writer and I adored their work. It had a lot of themes I could relate to and reading them really helped me emotionally. I’m asexual. As much as I enjoy reading romantic or sexual pairings, I have no desire for anything of the sort for myself. But I do feel very isolated because of my mental problems, Aspergers, and medical situations – even before all this stuff happened.</p><p> </p><p>    This Person, whom I will not name, their stories really helped me through some bad times and made me feel like I wasn’t a complete freak and that maybe someone somewhere might be right for me like in their stories – which often featured an isolated and badly communicative individual. This Person portrayed themselves as someone that was appreciative to their readers and was kind.</p><p> </p><p>    And then some people left them some bad reviews. I did the math. Even with a generous margin of 150 negative reviews, it would still be less than 2% (something like 1.9326%) of their reviews. And this person took down all their stories and left very mean messages. They said that they fully knew and acknowledged that they were hurting a lot more people than those who had done them wrong, but that They didn’t care and it was *worth* it to them as a measure to *maybe* get back at their negative reviewers. Honestly? There’s no way a negative reviewer would care, and if they did like That Person’s stories, they would have copied them offline before even leaving that negative review. Literally the ONLY people that got hurt were the real people that followed That Person and supported them – and That Person said point blank that they really didn’t give a d@*n. That’s like shooting guns into a crowd of your fans hoping to hit the few mean ones when you know those individuals have already left the building.</p><p> </p><p>    I wrote to them, hoping to express that That Person's writing had really helped me through some bad times and that their writing had more of an impact than they might have realized. Unfortunately, I wrote right at a time when there was a lapse in my medication do to an insurance hiccup and my issues with lack of acknowledgment reared its monstrous head. That and my very poor understanding of Tumblr resulted in That Person writing me a very politely worded but viciously backhanded and insulting letter. The very *nicest* thing in it was calling me a lying guilt-tripper. I might put more details of that in later, but the overall message was very vaneerly nicely  worded but expressed pointed disgust and a real intention to cause me pain.</p><p> </p><p>    Needless to say I metaphorically ran away. Do you know I’ve actually calculated it out that that letter has made me cry for no less than 2,000 plus hours? I stopped the calculation at that point. It’s given me nightmares and bloody noses galore. It’s put me into a very literal medical depression and has almost destroyed my ability to trust people. Because honestly, if a fanfiction writer can so easily turn around and activity try to hurt their true fans and readers for a very hollow move against internet trolls that just enjoy spouting lies wherever they can just to laugh over the reaction, then what does that say about people in general? What’s a kudos or positive review worth if it’s so easily thrown back in a readers face with the insinuation that your words and existence is worthless to the writer?</p><p> </p><p>    It’s been nearly three years now and I’m only occasionally submitting kudos or reviews. The story has to be truly outstanding for me to write something and risk another backlash like that. I feel like an abused dog that’s terrified. Honestly I would have preferred being beaten with a baseball bat. Then at least I would have been angry. Instead I even now still feel eviscerated with all my most private bits on display and being mocked and shamed for them.</p><p> </p><p>    I watched a documentary about a serial killer and he said something that really stuck with me. This man, even in prison, somehow got poison mailed into the US, just so that all of the prosecutors, judges, witnesses, and jurors were afraid that he might somehow get it into their food or homes and kill them.  And he did it precisely for that reason. He did it to terrify them even while he was behind bars. And he said “Fear is a pain that lives with you forever.”</p><p> </p><p>    That’s how I feel about That Person now. They’ve instilled that kind of fear into me so that whenever I even think about reaching out to someone, I feel that fear of ridicule and disgust. I’m working to live with it, but it will *never* go away. That Person very deliberately, knowing full well how much Their letter would hurt me - because of the reasons I had shared with Them of what and how Their writing had helped me - decided to cripple me – and for what? Their own amusement? Sense of accomplishment? Was I a stand in because They knew that Their response would never actually reach their negative reviewer’s? Was I just a convenient and easy target?</p><p> </p><p>    The pain they’ve given me is many many times greater than any previous aid their writing had given me. I try to avoid even thinking about Them. I immediately start crying.</p><p> </p><p>    I’ve gone over it in my mind hundreds of times. There is a slight chance that they didn’t mean it the way it came out, but That Person was a master of subtlety. I seriously seriously  *seriously* doubt that they did it by accident. And I’m absolutely certain that They know that Their actions didn’t hurt anyone other than their fans but they did it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>    Unfortunately, those things put together – the very cruel letter that causes me very severe emotional pain, my childhood propensity for nosebleeds while upset, and my new health problems where strong emotions cause me actual physical pain and physical problems means that when I *do* think of Them, I start crying. Then I get a nosebleed that can last for anywhere between 10 minutes and several hours. At the same time I get more and more nauseous and dizzy until I start throwing up – which includes a lot of blood from the bloody nose – with an increasing head pain that becomes so blinding that it eventually gets to the point of not being able to even think of anything other than the pain.</p><p> </p><p>    And have you ever thrown up blood from a bloody nose while crying? Not only is it disgusting, it is really easy to accidentally inhale some from the sobs and then you’re also *coughing* up blood.</p><p> </p><p>    That Person has caused me a monumental amount of very very LITERAL pain in nearly every category. Can you see why I’m very leery of having ever put anything up here?</p><p> </p><p>    So if anyone does decide to take a prompt on, please please PLEASE be very careful and polite while contacting me. I really would like to know so that I can answer any questions, fill in any details, and read your creation.</p><p> </p><p>    I will be upfront that I’m leery of reading messages at all. Like I said, while some people have been awesome and we’ve had great discussions, some people have also been horrible. This combination makes me view most message notices like a package that could either have a present or a bomb inside. I’ve ended up being wary no matter what. Some days are good days and those are the ones that I initiate a conversation, but I’ve got a lot of bad days where it’s just not worth the risk.</p><p> </p><p>    So, upfront warning: I might reply to messages, I might not. It really will depend on the day. Also, I’m fine if you just leave a kudos instead of a comment. If you are willing to take up one of these, please do contact me through a review and I can give additional details if needed and might take down the original prompt so as to preserve the story for your readers without the spoiler.</p><p> </p><p>    If you try to contact me about a story and I don’t reply, then I might be having emotional/medical difficulties. If I don’t reply, feel free to still write it. I’ll reply when/if I can.</p><p> </p><p>    Finally, if you take away anything from this monster of an Author’s Note, please take away that being an author – even on something like fanfiction- can be more meaningful than you might imagine. Please be aware that the people who read your work are real people with problems that you don’t know about and your writing might be of greater importance than you might imagine. Your readers are people. Negative reviewers are often just trolls – people who go around online saying any controversial thing they can think up just trying to get a reaction. They most often don’t even believe in the c+@p they themselves spew, they just love the reactions. So I’m begging you: don’t hurt your real supporters because a troll has decided to try to get their jollies by throwing mud. Internet Trolls are disgusting cowards and bullies. Seriously just ignore them. Bring their negative reviews to your real fan’s attention. I guarantee your fans will rally to your defense!</p><p> </p><p>    A lot of people read fanfic as a break from things going on in their lives, and some people have some bad things going on, so even just a small break is amazingly meaningful.  Please understand that you could be helping some more than you know – you might even be giving them the *only* help they can get. Your writing and words are not meaningless. In fact, for some, they can make all the difference in the world. But that also means you can destroy that too and leave them more vulnerable than ever.</p><p> </p><p>    What That Person wrote to me haunts me to this day and no matter how much I tell myself otherwise, I now feel utterly worthless and unlovable- and will only be mocked and degraded if I even try to reach out. It doesn’t really matter what others say to me now. Even if That Person retracted what they said, it wouldn’t get better. Once your brain gets stuck in a thought pattern for a certain amount of time, it is almost impossible to actually recover from it.</p><p> </p><p>    That Person actually got me thinking about suicide. *THAT'S* how much impact your words can have. Please recognize that what you say really does matters and can *destroy* some people.</p>
