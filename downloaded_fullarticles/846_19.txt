    <p>Harry Potter was not pleased to live with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon in Number 4 Privet Drive. In fact, he absolutely despised the fact. His aunt and uncle were not very nice people when it came to others being different from them. Young Harry indeed was very different from them, on account of the fact that he had magic. </p><p> </p><p>Harry was only a year and three months old when he had been placed with the Dursley's to live. Vernon and Petunia had wanted nothing to do with the boy but took him in because they felt they had no other choice. They mistreated him for years, getting worse and worse with their treatment of him as he got older. They much preferred their own son, Dudley.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was only half surprised when he got his Hogwarts letter. He could faintly remember things from before his parents deaths. He knew of magic and he knew that he had it. He got the feeling that there was no need to respond to the letter. His next order of business would be to get everything he needed for school. He would have to find a way to get wherever you would buy wizarding supplies from. </p><p> </p><p>It was only a few days later when someone showed up at the door to take him shopping to get his school supplies. A gigantic man, called Rubeus Hagrid. Harry wanted to know why the man was so large, but he knew that would be rude, so he did not ask. He also wondered if other people would look like that. </p><p> </p><p>It was approximately an hour between Little Whinging and London. That gave Harry time to think of ways to get away with what he was planning to do. It took him a while but Harry was sure he had a foolproof plan. He had to admit though, this would only work if Hagrid was half as dense as he looked.</p><p> </p><p>When they finally arrived in London they went to a place called The Leaky Cauldron. They walked through the building to an exit on the other side. Outside this exit was a wall. Harry looked at the wall curiously for a second until he saw Hagrid tap certain bricks. </p><p> </p><p>On the other side of the wall was a whole new world to Harry, the wizarding world. There were shops all around and people dressed peculiarly, at least according to the standards Harry had seen living with his aunt and uncle. He supposed this must be normal clothing here. He looked to both sides of him to see the signs for the shops.</p>
