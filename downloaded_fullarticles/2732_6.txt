    <p>Chapter One- When Wishes Still Work</p><p>It was best to arrive on a weekday that was not the child’s birthday, Minerva McGonagall had been told by her predecessor. Far less chance of a party, which meant fewer awkward guests to work around when explaining about Hogwarts.</p><p>Clearly, though, this could not work every time. A perfect example was this house, which was enormous and seemed to loom over the island community down the hill. There was a large amount of very different vehicles, and she wondered if she should rearrange her schedule to come later.</p><p>Of course, the situation with Mr. Potter was starting to alarm her, and if she needed to step in, she should try not to make her schedule even more impossible.</p><p>The dilemma was solved for her when the door opened and a young man peered curiously at her. “Hello, then. Did Dad- sorry, Dr. Targaryen- ask for you to come?”</p><p>“Oh, that <em>would</em> be like him to forget that today is Minnie’s birthday,” came a low female voice from behind Minerva. Minerva turned to see a woman leaning against an odd little vehicle.</p><p>They were siblings, most likely- the two had the same enormous dark eyes and tightly curling hair sweeping back from a widow’s peak, the same slightly worrying sense of grace. The man’s hair was a peculiar shade of blonde, almost metallic, while the woman’s seemed to absorb the sunlight.</p><p>Minisa Targaryen was the name on the envelope. They were older than she’d normally assume siblings for a new Hogwarts’ student would be, both perhaps thirty.</p><p>“I am here for Minisa Targaryen?” she said.</p><p>They looked at each other, the woman raising her eyebrows and the man giving a shrug. The woman sighed and then the man let out a laugh.</p><p>Well, Minerva thought, hair rising on the back of her neck, it was technically a laugh. There was something peculiar about it, like bells- as metallic as his hair and not quite something that should come from a human throat.</p><p>“She’s inside, if you will follow me?” The woman said, smiling. There was something sharp about the woman’s teeth, and she nearly makes an excuse to leave. “My stepmother is holding a birthday dinner for Minnie, so we were coming to help set up.”</p><p>“Speak for youself, Rhae,” the man snorted. “I’m here to snag Senya and the twins and dump them in the park.”</p><p>“I will tell our mother on you,” she said. “You aren’t too old for it.”</p><p>The door swung further open. “Our mother will understand.” He didn’t sound fully convinced though. “Min! Lysa, there’s a visitor for Min!”</p><p>The hall was larger than it should be, rising up into shadows not softened by the brightly patterned carpet or a large coat rack strewn with leftover bits of coats and scarves. There was one doorway a bit down, with soft sunlight streaming through.</p><p>A girl ran into the hall from that doorway, pale red hair like a beacon. She was a sweet looking girl, as tall as her sister but a good deal more substantial, and without those unsettling dark eyes.</p><p>“Who are you?” she asked. “Mum doesn’t like strangers.”</p><p>“Your mother doesn’t like much,” the young man murmured. His sister elbowed him, possibly the most human gesture she’d seen from them yet.</p><p>“My name is Professor Minerva McGonagall, and I need to speak with you and your parents,” Minerva managed.</p><p>“Okay, so Mum then,” the girl said. “Dad won’t be pried out of the library until the twins are ready for dinner.”</p><p>“I’ll get him,” the woman said, gliding past them. “Min, you should take your mother to the sea study. Aegon, can you get…”</p><p>“Got it, got it, Rhae,” he said, waving her off. “After Lysa gets here, though.”</p><p>“Of course,” the woman- Rhae- said, smiling at McGonagall. “I’m sorry, it shouldn’t usually be this mad, but we had to line up all of our schedules.”</p><p>“And neither Danny has shown up,” Aegon muttered.</p><p>“Margie will make sure Danelle is here on time,” said someone else, coming around the same doorway. This was a perfectly ordinary seeming woman with a darker version of her daughter’s red hair, beaming blue eyes, and a set of what seemed to be half-polished stones worn in long wire necklaces. “Hello, I’m Lysa, and you are…?”</p><p>“A professor for Min,” Aegon said, looking at a another corner of the room. “Rhaenys went to get our father. She said she’d take him to the sea study.”</p><p>“I wish her the best of luck,” Lysa said, primly. “I like that room, your father likes his library.”</p><p>“The books eat people,” Minisa told Minerva seriously.</p><p>She doesn’t remember terribly much after that, though she spends the evening with a good bottle of liquor and a desire to not think on it again. The Targaryen girl was sweet and slightly shy, and she would be coming to Hogwarts on the first. That was the end of it.</p><p>~</p><p>The Targaryens formed Dragonstone Island centuries back, in a peculiar place between the normal world and… elsewhere. The exact methods for this became shrouded in myth, but some claim the island was sung up from the sea, when the Old Ones ruled in the more shadowy areas of the human world.</p><p>Some people say a dragon and its rider crashed after one too many bottles of blood wine, and declared that it was now theirs.</p><p>Which interpretation is more popular depends on the current Lord of the island.</p><p>Diredragons and other fell creatures seem to be frozen in stone along the roof and towers of Dragonstone House, and the occupants have not seemed to lost any of their true power over the years, even as the dragons fell away.</p><p>The inhabitants of the island have come to a mostly easy coexistence with them, finding that many of the true irritants of the modern world- anti vaccination fanatics, telemarketers, and tax audits- leave the island well enough alone. Unlike the wizarding folk, the island does possess some of its perks- a large lending library, television, and easy access to take-away.  </p><p>Outsiders have two very different reactions. The first, for those who are sensible and solid individuals, is a sort of creeping horror. Their minds would shy away from what they are sensing, and the longer they try to come to terms with the sense of wrongness, the more their mind rebels. For children, inoculation comes naturally, and each successive generation becomes more accustomed to it.</p><p>The second category is the desperate or the unstable, the people who see the Old Ones in their terrible power and find that something calls to them. This category was responsible for a good portion of the newcomers to the island, with those who do not settle in shipped to the Starks in their dreary little village on the mainland.</p><p>There was, however, very little interaction with wizards and wand-wavers. Perhaps it was the occasionally uncertain position of the island with regards to the “real world”. Perhaps it was the Shadowbinders.</p><p>Perhaps Dragonstone Island was merely lucky, until Minisa Targaryen was given a Hogwarts Letter and the Lord of the Iron Throne, the Silver Dragon, and Master of Dragonstone decided that it would be a good idea to send his youngest child there.</p><p>His wife, entirely human and possessive of her children, disagreed, but there was little that would change his mind, so she resigned herself to her daughter’s fate and her husband resigned himself to the guest bedroom until the New Year.</p><p>~</p><p>Mum had to do something for the twins’ schooling on the same day, and Dad was<em> useless</em> at remembering things like times and dates. Rhaenys would have taken her, and she could have spent the night at Stargazer. But Rhaenys had been called on assignment, and Aegon was shacked to his project, and Mum said that no, Visenya was <em>not</em> old enough to take her sister to London, she was barely old enough for uni. Which had started a row, because Senya liked getting angry. Jon had managed to rearrange his schedule enough to swing taking her to London that morning, and Minisa tried not to feel too guilty about the circles under his eyes.</p><p>“Listen, squirt,” he said, making room so Min wasn’t squashed by other passengers with an absent wave of a hand and the sudden chill in the area. “We are going to find this. We are not going to call Rhae and Aegon’s uncle, and no one is going to mock us endlessly for it.”</p><p>She nodded. “Well, it’s magic, right?” The poor Professor wasn’t someone who could take Dragonstone well, even with the snapdragon tea that Aegon had brought up. She’d thought she’d caught the details right, but Mum had been fussing about her baby leaving and trying to embarrass Min as much as possible. She was pretty sure Dad had… persuaded Mum to let Min go, which probably would mean a ginormous fight in a week or so when it wore off. “So it must be hidden. Maybe it’s a test!”</p><p>Her eye was caught by a boy with an owl in a cage, looking perfectly miserable. The man next to him was doing proper villain gloating, and the phrase “Platform Nine and Three-Quarters” was said before he left, and he went over to a railway employee.</p><p>Before she could go over and say hello, there was someone who was clearly a Parent who looked at the boy with a faint frown and then started speaking loudly to her children, all with hair as red as Min’s own. Redder even, like her cousin Robb or Uncle Edmure. She was talking about Hogwarts and muggles and other things she and Dad had heard when they went to Diagon Alley with Rhaenys and a letter from her uncle.</p><p>(Rhaenys and Aegon didn’t know exactly how Oberyn Martell knew about wizards, and Dad said it probably involved stuff that Mum didn’t want her to hear about until she was thirty. So… probably sex stuff? Or at least Dad thought it was- Jon mentioned that Dad and Mr. Martell <em>really, really, really</em> didn’t like each other.)</p><p>“We could ask her,” Jon suggested, shrugging.</p><p>A crowd of tourists managed to power through Jon’s bubble, with loud and peculiar American accents and trodding on Minisa’s foot and sending her crashing into something hard.</p><p>“Are you alright?” the boy with the owl asked.</p><p>“Ow,” Minisa managed, gently trying to feel the lump on her head. “I think so.” She’d be fine in a moment, really. “Is your owl alright?”</p><p>“Hedwig’s fine,” the boy said, and Minisa looked at him curiously. He had bright green eyes magnified a bit by taped-together glasses- she hoped there was an easy spell to fix those, trying to get new ones in a rather lonely school might be tricky. His hair looked like he had stuck a finger in a light socket- Alyx had done that once, so she knew what it looked like. He was darker than Aegon or Rhaenys, close to Little Elia and her mom.</p><p>His clothes also looked worse than Rhaenys’ gardening rags, even if they didn’t smell like bone meal.</p><p>“I’m Min Targaryen, and this is my brother Jon,” she said. “Are you going to Hogwarts too? Only we don’t exactly know how…”</p><p>“I’m not going,” Jon said. “Strictly getting you to the train so my stepmother doesn’t murder me.”</p><p>Minisa rolled her eyes. “Mum wouldn’t… okay, maybe she would.”</p><p>“She would,” Jon said, watching as another of the redheaded boys went through. Their mother was splitting her attention between the boys and them.</p><p>“We should ask,” Minisa said, pulling her trolley. “And what’s your name?”</p><p>“Harry,” the boy said, before reaching the woman. “Excuse me,” he said, hesitantly.</p><p>“Hello, dears,” she said, smiling at them. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron is new too…”</p><p>The boy in question was tall as Cousin Robb, though that might be that he was spidery-gangly. He was also covered in freckles.</p><p>The woman explained that someone got into the platform by walking straight through it and not hesitating.</p><p>Harry went first, and Jon was looking ready to cast another, stronger circle to avoid notice. The witch helping them would probably react badly, though, so Minisa hoped he didn’t.</p><p>Minisa pushed through the crowds, seeing them change angles as she kept moving, and went through the platform, watching brick melt into a sunny platform.</p><p>Stargazer was almost like that, only with the Valyrian steel gates. And with no steam and a lot less noise.</p><p>Jon followed suit a moment later, watching them nervously. Stargazer, she remembered, didn’t like him very much.</p><p>“You’re both alright, then?” he asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Minisa said. “You can help us get our trunks on the train, though.”</p><p>He looked at the trucks with a skeptical look. “My question is, if there is all of these magical doorways and shops, why did no one bother to invent a trunk that doesn’t weigh less than a dead dragon?”</p><p>“That,” Minisa said, in her best imitation of Aunt Cat, “would be the sensible thing to do.”</p><p>Jon managed to haul hers up first, carrying it partially over his shoulder somehow. He was also terribly oblivious to the older girls and some of the mums watching him appreciatively, since he’d shown up wearing one of his old tight workout shirts and jeans.</p><p>At least Aegon didn’t come. That might start a riot.</p><p>The twins with Ron noticed them and helped grab Harry’s trunk. Minisa took Hedwig for him, because Dad hadn’t let her get a pet.</p><p>Jon and the twins helped set the trunks down in the last car, and Harry went to get his hair of his eyes- it really did need to either be cut or do what Dad did and grow into a ponytail- revealing a thin, silvery scar-web.</p><p>Minisa frowned, wondering if she should ask Jon to ask Aegon about it. There was something cold, almost about it, and not like the stones at home in winter, but more like something frozen before it got stinky and moldy.</p><p>“Harry Potter?” one of the twins said, and she had more questions now, didn’t she.</p><p>Well, she told herself, at least the wizards seem to have forgotten about Dragonstone. That was probably good.</p><p>She waved to Jon as the train pulled out of the station.</p><p>~</p><p>Minisa frowned as they went through the line. Aegon said you should be careful about things you let read your mind. But if they did it to everyone…</p><p>Well, she’d probably not tell Mum. Ron was right behind her, since not too many people had last names that started with U or V, and he was still upset about his brothers lying to him.</p><p>“Yes,” she whispered, “older brothers are stupid. But did you really want to fight one before we even learned a spell?”</p><p>That earned her a cross look before he gave a nod. “Guess not,” he said.</p><p>Hermione was up, and there was a pause before the Hat sent her to the not-actually-Lannister table. No one had fishes or dragons, so she contented herself with trying to guess which of her brothers and sisters would go where when Neville-with-the-toad argued silently with the Hat.</p><p>That awful bully and his friends were all sent to Slytherin, which had the green-and-silver that would probably get her twins. And maybe Jon? She wasn’t sure. Dad would get the book house, no doubt, and Senya would get the lions.</p><p>Rhaenys was a bit trickier- she didn’t shout, or like being smarter, but she couldn’t just put her in Hufflepuff, as much as she suspected Rhaenys would have had fun there. She liked being tricky, which Min never really got.</p><p>Harry went up, and seemed to be talking to the Hat.</p><p>“I thought he’d go straight to Gryffindor,” Ron whispered to her.</p><p>“People are complicated,” Min quoted. “Look at Neville.”</p><p>Ron paused and shrugged. “Guess.”</p><p>Harry went to Gryffindor with a load of shouts, including some from Ron’s brothers and a slight, nervous smile from Hermione.</p><p>Professor McGonagall’s eye twitched a little bit when she called Minisa’s name, and Min skipped up. She didn’t bother being boring- they all wanted this over with, and her family wasn’t here to see where she went.</p><p>The Hat let out a screech that was probably just internal, given the fact that when she peeked over the brim no one was looking worried.</p><p>“What… do you know, I’m just going to tuck you in Gryffindor, they’ll deal with it later,” the Hat said after a long moment of silence.</p><p>Sorry, she thought at the Hat.</p><p>It did sound a bit shaky when it finished up, though. Well, it was probably a good thing she was so close to the end of the line.</p><p>~</p><p>Professor Snape, for whatever reason, didn’t like Harry.</p><p>(Professor Snape, the Weasley twins had added, looked like a bat. Minisa had to disagree. Bats were adorable when they weren’t rabid.)</p><p>He was rude, and acted like he enjoyed having power over kids. Based on some of the comments made by the older Gryffindors, Snape was basically allowed to do what he wanted, too.</p><p>And Minisa knew the answers to the questions he asked- she couldn’t have Rhaenys for a sister and not know asphodel- and she raised her hand, like Hermione.</p><p>Parvati stepped on her foot when she was about to say something.</p><p>“He’s doing it on purpose,” the other girl muttered. “We’ll lose points on our first lesson if we say something now.”</p><p>“We’ll all lose points anyway at this rate,” Minisa muttered. Senya would say something. Jon would say something.</p><p>Rhaenys and Dad would make a list, though, and make sure they had enough facts to shut down anyone who tried to argue. Mum did it too, sometimes, and said it helped her keep her head straight when she got too mad to think.</p><p>So they’d need to keep a list- if they all did it, it couldn’t hurt, right?</p><p>She glared at Snape anyway when he tried to look her in the eyes.</p><p>He stumbled and bumped into Neville’s cauldron, sending the partially made solution flying over himself.</p><p>~</p><p>Minisa Targaryen was the youngest of her family. This was something she accepted- Rhaenys did not seem terribly interested in marriage yet, and Aegon and Jon were incurably hopeless in her eyes. (And, though she didn’t know the term “whiskey dick” or “trash fire”, Viserys was not likely to interest anyone seriously.) So she would not have any nieces or nephews to take the youngest title away for a while.</p><p>A Targaryen usually came into the bulk of their power around sixteen or so, though flare ups occurred a few years before this. This fact had been why Lysa Tully had been able to accompany her daughter to King’s Cross. Her twins, Alyx and Alyssa, were fourteen and just starting the first flashes of accidental power. Even in a town as accustomed to the Targaryens, and though they did not show the power of their siblings, it was a tricky little tangle that made her life difficult.</p><p>The question of what to do when Minisa’s power started to flare had not been dealt with to anyone’s satisfaction, mostly because no one had enough of the picture to do so. Anchored in the halls of Dragonstone, it should flicker and splash harmlessly on the walls.</p><p>At a school where no one really knew about the quirks of Dragonstone or the Targaryens, and the children’s real limits on their destructiveness was their curiosity, temper and knowledge? Somewhere, Aegon Targaryen was wincing. At least she wasn’t able to do too much yet.</p><p>With that being said, trying to peek into an Old Ones’ mind, even a very young Old One, was perhaps not the brightest of moves.</p><p>“Not the brightest of moves”, in this case, meaning that the mild reaction was a splitting migraine and bizarre nightmares over the next week. The potion accident was a related byproduct, but not actually a direct result.</p><p>Unfortunately for his well being, Professor Snape was not a terribly easygoing man, and he was not going to admit defeat to an eleven year old girl.</p><p>~</p><p>Minisa looked curiously at them. “Have you seen Hermione? Lavender and Parvati said she was crying.”</p><p>Harry looked guiltily at Ron, who gave them both a sullen look.</p><p>“I wasn’t wrong,” he protested.</p><p>Minisa frowned, and Harry bit back a sigh. He liked his friends, he really did, but Min dug in and Ron knew it.</p><p>“I said she was a nightmare and that was the reason she had no friends, and it’s true,” Ron said. He looked like he knew he shouldn’t have said it, either time.</p><p>Harry thought he could almost smell something wet and mossy, and one of the seventh-years got up from near them and moved to the other end of the table.</p><p>“That was rude,” Minisa said, sounding deeply angry. “I know she corrected you, but maybe tell her that she could tell you alone. She’s my friend, Ron.”</p><p>“That’s because... “ Ron was thankfully prevented from continuing by virtue of the doors to the Great Hall slamming open, and Professor Quirrell announcing there was a troll in the dungeon.</p><p>“They’re taking us through the castle?” Ron frowned. “We have to go past the troll?”</p><p>“We have to get Hermione,” Harry said.</p><p>“And where is she?” Min asked, looking between them.</p><p>“Girls bathroom,” Ron said, after a moment.</p><p>Minisa stood up, and they followed her. “Which girl’s bathroom?” she asked, after they snuck away from the rest of them.</p><p>“By the Charm’s classroom?” Harry guessed.</p><p>Minisa sighed, and they both followed her up towards the Charms classroom, keeping a wary watch for trolls.</p><p>Harry pushed the bathroom door open, to find a still upset Hermione.</p><p>~</p><p>Some things are inevitable. A troll, a levitation charm, a lie, all coming together to cement a friendship.</p><p>Some things- a pair of uncanny blue eyes in a young girl’s face, sending three of her teachers faintly green, a sharp scream that made the water in the sinks and toilets turn into acid, a hastily aimed spell to cover the damage- were part and parcel of the strangeness that the Targaryens brought in their wake.</p><p>As was Minisa, looking nervously at her friends and muttering about what her mother would say.</p><p>~</p><p>“So,” Minisa frowned at Hermione. “We know someone is trying to do something.”</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth. Harry shook his head, so she stayed silent. Minisa seemed flighty, but she liked breaking things down into bits. Maybe it would help them find out what. The other girl was curled up on one of the armchairs, biting her lip and somehow making it so no one else was nearby.</p><p>“We know that Hagrid knows what it is, because he got it out when he took Harry to Gringott’s,” she said finally.</p><p>“And that someone tried to steal it,” Harry added. “But Hagrid had already gotten it.”</p><p>“Already been told to get it,” Hermione corrected.</p><p>“Who told him, though, and did they know someone was going to steal it?” Ron scowled. “And why is there a giant three-headed dog in the school?”</p><p>“Cerebus,” Minisa said, eyes narrowed. “The dog that guards the Greek underworld. I think I can get a book from Dad about it.”</p><p>“So it’s a guard,” Harry said. “So it’s watching the thing Hagrid took from Gringotts.”</p><p>“But who wants it?” Hermione frowned. “And why aren’t the teachers doing anything?”</p><p>“Hermione,” Minisa pointed out, “Ron was right. He pointed out that the teachers wanted to take us out from being all together in one room with heavy doors and drag us all through the castle when a troll was on the loose!”</p><p>Minisa’s mother hadn’t liked that story, Hermione remembered. “So why are we the ones going to fix it?”</p><p>“Because usually these things end up trying to kill everyone if they aren’t stopped before it gets bad,” Minisa said, nodding her head.</p><p>“And who else is going to,” Harry added. “So we know it involves Nicholas Flamel, so we can try and look it up over the holidays.”</p><p>Minisa bit her lip. “Dad might have something in his library. Or Aegon might know. You know, you can all come visit for Christmas. Mum wouldn’t mind, and Dad… probably wouldn’t notice.”</p><p>They declined, not entirely certain they wanted to deal with a large family of Minisas.</p><p>~</p><p>There was a dragon, there was a Targaryen.</p><p>There were more Targaryens, because while Ron’s brother Charlie worked with dragons, he was also in Romania and Hagrid’s house was made of wood.</p><p>They waited one evening at Hagrid’s hut, the Gamekeeper waiting nervously until Fang sat up and let out a little whimper, before his tail wagged.</p><p>“Oh, good,” Minisa said, running to the door.</p><p>Harry blinked at the small woman at the door. Her silver-blonde hair was chopped short, and her face was pale and delicate, with enormous eyes of neon purple. She seemed to take up all of the focus in a room, while she stared curiously at Norbert.</p><p>“Hello,” she said, and suddenly Harry realized she was wearing a hoodie and ripped jeans, which somehow took him out of his daze.</p><p>“This is our Aunt Daenerys,” said a man who Harry recognized as Min’s brother Jon, who had a large carrying case that seemed to hum a little. “She’s Dad’s younger sister. I’m one of Minisa’s older brothers, I supposedly work for the police, and yet I am helping smuggle a dragon.”</p><p>“Dragons are not banned creatures, at least by laws that we recognize,” Daenerys said, raising her eyebrows. “And I agreed to warn you about the next big article I wrote.”</p><p>“If you know that it will effect a case of mine,” Jon said, looking down at her with amusement. “If being the key word? So when you don’t check too closely, you don’t have to let me know.”</p><p>Daenerys chose to focus on Norbert. “Oh, you are a sweetheart, aren’t you?”</p><p>Hagrid looking a great deal more content with Daenerys’ clear adoration of Norbert.</p><p>This should, one would think, keep them out of the forest, away from dying unicorns and centaurs.</p><p>This would be true, but for Snape trying to figure out what was going on with Minisa again. This time, there was a medium sized fire, the potions classroom was declared uninhabitable for two weeks, and Malfoy was missing his eyebrows.</p><p>Neville had a nasty burn on his right arm, which was rather more noticable, but Professor Snape did not seem to care terribly about this.</p><p>He did, however, assign detention to Minisa, Harry, Hermione, and Ron. Not that he had proof of some misdeed, but he declared it had to be their fault somehow, and they should stop covering for each other.</p><p>Malfoy somehow got detention, though none of them quite paid attention as to how.</p><p>Professor McGonagall, wincing, had kept Minisa out of the forest. She did not want to know what would happen if the girl went in. Ents, perhaps.</p><p>~</p><p>Minisa frowned at the flames. “Harry, you will be alright.” She looked at him, and something in her expression made Harry very sure that he was in fact going to get out of this in one piece. There was a fading bruise on her cheek where a key had hit, her knuckles had blood sticking to them, and her hair was a wreck, but there was something about her words that set him down what felt like an easy, level path.</p><p>Hermione gave Minisa a skeptical look.</p><p>“You just said I was great, Hermione,” Harry pointed out.</p><p>“No, that wasn’t it,” Hermione said, shaking her head. “We’ll get Ron to the hospital wing, and get a teacher.”</p><p>“A useful teacher,” Min said, smiling serenely.</p><p>Somehow, when he woke up, he wasn’t terribly surprised to see Min napping on the chair next to him, her hair loose and covering her face. Professor Dumbledore, watching Min like she was a puzzle, that was a surprise.</p><p>He saw, half-hidden under red-gold hair, a blue eye focused on the headmaster when he answered Harry’s questions.</p><p>~</p><p>Minisa and Hermione had written their phone numbers down for Harry and Ron, who looked mildly baffled as he looked over Hermione’s hair.</p><p>“Who is Mum talking to?” he asked, looking at the Twins.</p><p>“Dunno,” Fred said, looking at the woman, who was wearing muggle clothes and had long, dark red hair. “Someone’s mother, I’d say.”</p><p>“Seems obvious,” George agreed.</p><p>“My mum,” Min said, looking at the woman, who did have Minisa’s wide blue eyes and tilted-up nose.  She winced. “She’s not going to be happy about the Troll. Or the whole thing with Quirrell. Or a lot of things.”</p><p>“You’re coming back, though?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Oh, yes,” Minisa nodded her head jerkily. “Though I may drag you to Dragonstone and help?”</p><p>They all nodded. “Of course,” Hermione said. “Friends do that. Right?”</p><p>“We do,” Harry said, privately wondering if the Dursleys might try again to keep him away from school.</p><p>He’d make it there somehow.</p>
