  <strong>New Law</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>After the war Harry thought everything would go back to normal. Finish school, join the auror forces and have a family. Instead the Potter luck had kicked in.</p><p>The war had seriously depleted wizard and witch numbers, enough so then in a about two generations or so they would die out if things continued as they where. Even the incoming muggleborn couldn't help. Each incoming Hogwarts school year had about 4-5 muggleborn. Some muggle family's refusing to let their children attend and have their child's magic sealed and all the family obliviated.</p><p>Voldemort had add to the dark mark after his resurrection. Most marked death eaters died when he did, the few that survived where damaged and all where infertile. Meaning the witches greatly out numbered the wizards. About half of those were newly made widows.</p><p>So after quickly being selected as the new minister of magic with the backing of Harry Potter. Kingsley Shacklebolt gathered the remaining Lord and lady's as well as several high ranking ministry officals plus his advisors to discuss a solution and hopefully stop their communities destruction.</p><p>========================================</p><p>Harry Potter walked in to the ministry build two months after the war ended. Harry could still see signs of damage and signs of on going repair as he walked through the building. Harry thought back to what has happened since the war.</p><p>========================================</p><p>A lot has happened in that short time. After the battle the battle Harry headed to the great hall find his friends. Harry had found Luna first, crying over her father's body. Harry had gathered her in his arms and comforted her the best he could. Slowly coaxing her away and the great hall.  Walking through the destruction sent a pang through his heart. Hogwarts was his first home. He meet his first friends here, his chosen family.</p><p>Nearing the hall Harry pulled Luna closer to his side as they hear the crying. Stopping before the great hall doors Harry took a fortifying breath and steeled himself. Checking Luna one last time Harry entered the hall coming to abrupt stop.</p><p>The dead lines the right side of the hall mourners clustered around their loved ones. The left side was running a make shift infirmary for the wounded. Harry was relieved to see Madam Pomfrey amount the medics.</p><p>Harry walked Luna over to Madam Pomfrey trying not to look to closely to the right side yet. Handing Luna of, Harry reluctantly looked for the Weasleys. Harry already knew of Percy's dead saving Fred. He found them near the back, Harry felt dread well up as he approached.</p><p>After being giving an almost crushing hug from Ron and Hermione, Harry found out they had lost two more Weasleys. Charlie had saved a badly mauled Lavender Brown from Fenrir Greyback and had paid the price. Bill found them soon after and killed the werewolf while Fleur grabbed Lavender and took her to the medics. Arthur had been killed defending Ginny from Beletrix Lestrange before she was killed by Molly in grief filled rage.</p><p>Through the rest of the day and night tragic news kept coming. Apart from Neville Harry's other dorm mates had died. Hagrid had been taken down by the Carrow twins. Tonks had also died and Remus was gravely injured. Countless people from all four houses dead. Then more bad news came. Before attacking Hogwarts the death eaters had attacked Diagonally Alley. Killing dozens and destroyed most of the alley.</p><p>In the weeks following families mourned and people picked up and tried to move on. Harry had to attend multiple funerals. Harry in between had Winky fix up Grimmauld Place having moved Andromeda Tonks and Teddy in first as Andromeda been grieving for her husband and daughter. Plus Harry had wanted his godson near.</p><p>Luna moved in next having no where to go, Harry couldn't in good conscience leave his friend with nowhere to stay. Harry had accompanied Luna to what was left of her house to see if anything was left. Apart from some small keep saked and a bag of clothes, Luna also found her family ring. It turned out Lovegood was a minor noble house. Luna seemed to bounce back quicker than the rest and was helping taking care of Teddy.</p><p>Remus had woken up and was confined to the hospital till he healed more. While devastated Remus was with losing his wife, he loved when Luna or Harry brought Teddy to see him. It was the only time he seem to come alive.</p><p>With the destruction of the Burrow and Diagonally Alley their was no was for the Weasleys to go. So Harry was also housing Molly, Ginny and the twins after saying goodbye to Ron and Hermione, since they had left to find Hermiones parents. Molly had signed to Burrow over to Bill. Who was camping their with Fleur as he cleared away and started to rebuild. Bill and Fleur had saved a decent amount among them and were talking about building a manor house.</p><p>Fred and George had lost their store and flat on the Diagonally Alley attack. Luna didn't want to go back home since that her family was gone, so the twins had bought the land from her to be near the Burrow. Talk of their shop had been put off for now till they had a home. Fred and George were going to build to houses side by side with adjoining areas, such as dining room and their workshop.<br/> <br/>======================================</p><p>Gringotts was surprisingly easy on comparison to everything else. Harry paid a large fine and the goblins got right to business. Harry was surprised to find that he was the head of several Ancient and Noble houses which he should have claimed in 17 birthday. After claiming the Black, Potter and Pervelly rings. Each ring also came with two seats on the wizengamot seats each. As well as multiple vaults and properties.</p><p>Of the properties the one that intrigued Harry most was two islands off the Scottish coast owned by the Blacks. The Blacks were a paranoid bunch and used them for food. After some discussion Harry had hired the goblins to clear the islands and repair the bridge between the islands. He also had them contact contracting firms to start building a home on the slightly bigger island.</p><p>Harry also had all of Voldemorts vaults through right of conquest. Harry already had the goblin in charge of his vaults, Longclaw going through it and donating to different rebuilding projects, also to St. Mungos.</p><p>Untangling the financial matter was extremely stressful, even with Longlaw's help. A lot of families have also left their money to him. After talking to Andromeda, he reinstated her and Teddy back into the family.</p><p>=======================================</p><p>Along with meeting several people and committees for helping people affected by the war and rebuilding. Many people where rescued from former death eater homes. Hogwarts was also undergoing repairs. During this time was when the population problems discovered.</p><p>After many discussions of different solutions, a marriage law was chosen to be the best solution. After the law was voted on there were to be talks of what to do about muggles that refused to allow their children to keep and use their magic.</p><p>Harry knew that many at the beginning thought he would protest such a law but Harry saw the point and need. Harry loved the wizarding world no matter it's problems and he wanted it to survive. He want his future children and grandchildren to go to Hogwarts and see all types of magic. Not be the last of the're kind unless they left Britain.</p><p>After many talks, the law was to be voted on today. All witch's and wizards over 16 were to be married. Given that the witch's greatly out numbered the wizards an old law allowing multiple wives had already been reinstated. The richer the wizard the more witch's they where expected to have and provide for. The wizards magic core power also factored in as the large the amount of magic the longer lived the individual, some up to two hundred. Married couples where also required to follow the new law. </p><p>To keep things fair and impartial, a magical goblet similar to the goblet of fire was made. It would factor in age, wealth, magic power,compatibility and any magic gifts. The law was a forgone conclusion at this point. After it past their would be a month long wait before waiting names would be drown at Hogwarts. A hundred witch's where to be matched before a week wait. It would continue like this till everyone was matched.</p><p>Up until a week before the matching ceremony witch's could withdraw their name and marry who they chose. Men with three wives over eighty where exempt. All infertile people were exempt as well.</p><p>After some debate half creatures like Hagrid and Flitwick, where included. As where werewolves that had not aided with Voldemort. Male werewolves as long as they could afford to support a wife. All female werewolves were to be included. A small island was to be warded for full moons, that all werewolves where requiered to go each full moon.</p><p>====================================</p><p>Harry walked in the court room nodding at the people he knew, he headed up the stairs the his seat beside Neville. They chatted quiet while waiting for Minister Kingsley Shackelbolt. Neville had claimed the Longbottom seat after his grandmother was killed.</p><p>Neville has also supported the law to some surprise. As far as Harry know he planned to marry his long term girlfriend Hannah Abbott before the first Matching ceremony.</p><p>Across the way Harry noticed Draco Malfoy enter. While the elder Malfoy had used a cane for decoration the younger needed one from damage after the dark lords dead. Draco had married Pansy Parkinson when Harry was on the run. With Voldemort dead Draco was infertile, lucky for him Pansy was already pregnant when the dark Lord was killed.</p><p>Rising after Shackelbolt entered before sitting at his signal the meeting begain. After going over the law one last time a vote was called. The results were was almost unanimous. The law was passed, starting tomorrow the month count down began.</p>
