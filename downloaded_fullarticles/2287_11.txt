  <em>A real mystery beater</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Many famous people have weird quirks, but the Holyhead Harpies’ second beater’s must be one of the most unheard of yet. Ginny Weasley’s (Harry Potter’s wife, for the ones who were living under a rock all this time) team-mate Diane Scherrer could just as well be a ghost. A ghost who would be very good at Quidditch, and very good at disappearing when not playing. The short, swift brunette is the most elusive around the pitch, and outside of it, she virtually doesn’t exist. People know of her, remember her from her years at Hogwarts - yours truly has come across saucy details from her teenage rebellion years, which will be developed further in this article -  but no one seems to know anything as to her current whereabouts. Faithful readers will know this writer’s tenacity in her quest to uncover truth; and yet, there was nothing to be found. But you will know, of course, that this will only feed this writer’s curiosity, and that this is only the beginning of the enquiry. What we do know about this slippery beater is that she was born the fourth daughter to pure blood parents Albert Scherrer and Penelope Bellchant, whose tragic death just as she started her studies at Hogwarts (house Gryffindor) might have lead Diane towards -</em>

<p>“Shithead. By the way, could you please stop taking this extremely irritating voice when you read the paper?</p>
<p>“Skeeter’s articles need to be read in Skeeter’s voice. I don’t make the rules.”</p>
<p>Diane shook the newspaper to smooth the page, keeping her reading to herself, now. Skeeter had invented her an interesting relationship with Neville Longbottom at Hogwarts, whom she had absolutely no memory of, being 4 years older than him. Diane drank her breakfast tea. In the corner of the page, one of the rare pictures of her people could get their hands on was flying on a broomstick and waving Britain’s Quidditch cup. They had won the year prior.</p>
<p>At the other side of the table, Desden was eating scrambled eggs. He shook his fork, speaking with his mouth full.</p>
<p>“You’re gonna have to make a public appearance one day or another. This will only get worse.</p>
<p>“Mh-hm.” Diane drank more tea and bit into a toast.</p>
<p>“Go get a drink somewhere. Have a pint at the Leaky Cauldron. Visit the Three Broomsticks for old time’s sake,” He felt around for his cup of tea and took a sip. “I don’t know, do what you want, but you need to be seen.</p>
<p>“Mh-hm.”</p>
<p>Desden put down his fork, concerned.</p>
<p>“Do your friends know?</p>
<p>“No one knows.</p>
<p>“Does Ginny…?</p>
<p>“Ginny’s not my friend.</p>
<p>“You’re one of the most famous Quidditch players in the country, and the first one is married to fucking Harry Potter. And you play together. People love you. You should be friends. At least that’s what people might think.</p>
<p>“I don’t like people. I think I have that in common with her.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be hiding that much.” Desden got back to his eggs, ate a mouthful, then finished, a thoughtful expression on his face. “It’s suspicious.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to protect you.” Diane got up, walked next to Desden and planted a kiss on the top of his head. “And my private life. Key word is private.”</p>
<p>She put on her jacket.</p>
<p>“I’ll be out until 6 or 7.</p>
<p>“It’s Sunday…</p>
<p>“Training. Duh. Be careful if you go out, there’s a cat roaming around the house. It’s been there a lot this past week. Don’t let it sneak inside.</p>
<p>“And how am I supposed to do so, without seeing it?</p>
<p>“Says the man who was deemed the best Charms student of his generation. It’s a tabby, just ban all tabby cats, so ours can still get in. See you later.”</p>
<p>She disapparated with a soft “pop”. Desden finished his breakfast, then fished for his wand in his shirt pocket and walked towards the front door, trying to remember banishment spells and to how to tweak them to adapt for a tabby cat.</p>
