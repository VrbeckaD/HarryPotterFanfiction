  <b>Chapter 1</b>

  <b>Lyon, December 2001</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione could only reasonably hold four textbooks at a time. She had dabbled with five and tried with six, but four she could manage. She looked up at the shelves in front of her and looked for the space she needed. These four books were on cursed poisons, a dead-end in her research once again, and once they were back in their place she walked towards the exit from Apartment 3. The Lyon Apartments were unique as a safe house in that they must be, she had thought from time to time, technically safe </span>
  <em>
    <span>houses</span>

  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Three years ago, she had been escorted from Scotland by Kingsley, a portkey to Paris and two hours on a Voyage Magique train to Lyon. They had walked, dragging Muggle suitcases full of books across the tram stops and down a wide main road that opened to a junction it shared with the river that flowed through the city. It was November and it was unseasonably warm, she was sweating through the white cotton dress that Luna had given her when she had left Scotland. If Kingsley had noticed that her bra was clearly visible through the back of her dress, he hadn’t said anything as he walked behind her following a Muggle map to their destination. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When they arrived, she had looked up at the staircase in the lobby with awe. The building consisted of eight very plainly furnished apartments and a small service apartment in the eaves of the roof. There was a lift tucked to the left, aside the odd-numbered apartments and when she stood to the left of the foot of the stairs, she could see the railing at the top. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She found herself there two weeks later, her bare feet on the lacquered wooden floor and her hands on the polished banister rail. To the right was the entrance to the flat, that when she had first moved in, she had been able to store all of the books in. She had dragged a large, solid wood dining table into the living room, pushing the sofas and chairs out of the way and pulled a single dining chair to sit at her new massive desk at which she would work. She had always loved the long, old and worn tables in the Hogwarts Library, the surface area was never smooth and so they were never too cold to lean her forearms against even in the coldest months. This table had been carefully looked after by its owners but they weren’t here now and she was and she planned to put her new desk through its paces. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had been reading from a text that she already knew didn’t contain the answers, one of the ones she had brought from Scotland. It was the only text she had found so far that even mentioned the concept of a wizard or witch in a coma. She read the passage in the seventeenth chapter a few times before she realised she would have to go downstairs and get one of the boxes of books that Bill Weasley had dropped off when he was here to install her guard dog curse that would protect her from unwanted intruders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unwanted intruders meant Death Eaters, it meant that she had failed and that everyone she cared about would be dead within days of her being found. She had been installed in the Lyon Apartments alone, she was the fidelius charm’s only secret-keeper. Her knowledge couldn’t travel the continent like the other members of the Order; her brain being captured couldn’t be risked. It had become more and more obvious to those of them hiding in Elgin, Scotland that she also was unable to stay nearby either. Every day Harry got worse and worse, no matter how hard they tried or how many potions that they fed the sleeping boy - Harry was fading fast. Hermione was distracted from her task of finding out how to wake him and the accidental magic she was giving out was causing too many traceable signs of where they were hidden. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No, Hermione could not be found. Not alive. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As this thought rolled around her brain and the concept that her being found would need to mean her being dead, and quickly, she walked out on the landing. The banister at the top of the foyer was wide, probably once very grand. The Muggles who lived here were not outrageously wealthy but had obviously had a fair amount of money to afford these large sprawling apartments and the servants that must have slept in the apartment in the roof. The banister wasn’t only made for function but also for show, which meant that if she were to balance her weight correctly - she might be able to stand on it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t try that day, choosing to walk down the stairs and retrieve the new books, three on Muggle biology and one on magical cores. She had purposely avoided looking at the railing on her way back to the apartment with her makeshift office and started reading her new texts. Allowing herself to forget about the riddle of what to do if she were found and carried on with the regimens of her days in the apartments. When she had just gotten there she would receive maybe a dozen books a week, all with different connections to Harry’s condition and some no connection at all that she could decipher. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Another day, she was putting the last of the books that had arrived that day on the shelves of an apartment on the second floor, a pigeon slammed hard into the railings outside the sash windows of the room and Hermione screamed, her heart pounding against her ribcage. She had been by herself for six weeks by this point, mostly in complete silence except when people would walk to or from work below her, their voices humming quietly. If anything they gave her the comfort of time passing normally; that somewhere some people were living their lives, looking up at the clock on their wall and not smashing it against the floor just to watch the glass front shatter across the parquet flooring. But mostly, the calm quiet had permeated the apartments until now when the bangs below hadn’t even finished echoing across the foyer, Hermione had crossed the landing and hauled her body up using her forearms so that she was crouching on the wide banister ledge like she was getting out of a swimming pool. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stood up only when she felt like her position would mean she could fall forward. When her feet were shoulder length apart and she had found her bearings, it wasn’t scary at all. She could feel the air around her, her arms hung comfortably at her side; it was almost peaceful. Maybe it was because she had once rode a dragon from London to the Peak District, but it was actually quite nice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Quite nice and useful because she would definitely die.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her brain would die with her and so would the secrets of the Order. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This had become a comfortable routine. She would never know when it would happen but an unexpected noise or a shadow that resembled the height of a person would catch the corner of her eye and she would run to the banister ready to protect her friends and destroy the knowledge that lived in her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now, three years later, the desperation was different. Hermione’s panicked but familiar movements could be delayed. She could go about the whole afternoon some days before giving in and climbing onto her worn footprints of the wooden ledge of the railing. She had heard an awful screech of brakes from a car below a few hours ago. It wasn’t the scream of Bellatrix Lestrange or the high-pitched crack of a curse through the air and it was okay and no one had found her and she would be okay. She’d reassured herself everything was okay but not enough not to climb up onto the banister. Not enough not to say her goodbyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Hermione looks into his eyes in her head. She hasn’t seen his eyes in more than three years but the visage of him she conjured in her mind makes her feel less alone.. She remembered Hagrid falling to his knees in the rubble of Hogwarts as he discovered that Harry was alive. That Harry’s tiny breaths had been terrifying to the Death Eaters, Voldemort so rocked that he’d been unable to kill the boy again that mayhem broke loose. He had been moved to the safe house in Scotland and lied there day after day, a small body in a transfigured bed. He’d seemed to be losing weight by the hour. Despite her fear of leaving him alone, Hermione knows Harry would understand why she did this, that her death kept the people they loved safe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ginny</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Ginny would be furious that she was doing this. Ginny, so used to loving and being loved by others, all or nothing. The youngest Weasley and easily the toughest would claw Hermione off that banister and scream at her for even considering it. Scream at her about obligation, about how they needed her. That they were family and you didn’t abandon family. What Ginny wouldn’t say is how much she needed Hermione, that if Hermione was dead then what was the point in any of them living? But Hermione </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> abandoned them, she’d had no choice. Under orders from the one person who seemed to know what they were doing - Luna. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Luna. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Luna was the reason she was here. Without Luna, Hermione would be reading the same seventeen books over and over again as Harry withered away. Luna’s father had a contact in Lyon who, upon hearing of Xenophilius’ death, offered anything he could to help them. Luna convinced the man, a magical bookseller, to start sending the start of Hermione’s library. Luna had somehow organised these apartments for her, and she knew what was going to happen, and often </span>
  <em>
    <span>when</span>
  </em>
  <span> it was going to happen. She would look you in the eye and see past your physical person, ask you if something had happened yet and when the answer was no - that thing would happen very shortly. Luna was the one that knew Draco Malfoy would be the only person who could keep Harry alive and convinced the Order that not one of them left was anywhere near as good at potions. Luna,  who had helped Hermione brew the Wolfsbane for Remus the last time she had visited, only just getting it the correct colour. Luna was the one that corrected anyone who referred to Ron in the past tense. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ron. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Ron was presumed dead. No one had seen him after Harry had been found to be breathing, and his family had looked for hours. Hogwarts abandoned, people returned periodically in the vain hope that he was somehow wandering the halls of the school. As she teetered on the edge of the railing, Hermione felt shame rise in her that she had been so focused on Harry, so cautious of Malfoy, and so worried for Ginny that she hadn’t noticed that Ron wasn’t with them for more than a day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Luna had never said that she knew where Ron was, but she had said several times that she was sure he would be alright. But that had been more than three years ago; everyone who visited her here </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew </span>
  </em>
  <span>that Ron was dead. That he had either been taken by Death Eaters or killed in the panic that followed the battle. Hermione, too, thought that he was dead. He had to be. She had no choice but to think that because if he was anything else, </span>
  <em>
    <span>anywhere</span>
  </em>
  <span> else, what had become of him? Ron was the person that she had said goodbye to the most when she thought of her friends. He had been her closest confidant, and at one point, she thought he may have been even more. When they’d been in the tent and he had held her hand as she cried and cried for her parents they could have had more. He had kissed her, a desperate touch she returned, but that was so long ago now. He had to be dead because if he was dead he was safe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Remus</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He came to the front of her mind very slowly and then all at once. Whenever she said her goodbyes, her old professor sat at the back of her mind with a kind and patient smile. He would wait for her to finish with a calm and relaxed posture and then he would stroll forward until he looked in her eyes. The way he did when she was talking about something she was interested in, like she could talk for hours and he wouldn’t get bored. When he had first visited her here, that was exactly what she had done. It had been two years since he had visited last and she had only had a few people come to see her and they had been people that she didn’t have much of a history or connection with, but Remus was different. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus Lupin had been her teacher. Her favorite teacher. He had told her time and time again that she was his friend. She’d blushed as a teenager and had been awkward as an adult as she tried to think of a world where this kind, warm, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>handsome</span>
  </em>
  <span> man could be her friend. If he was her friend, if she was no longer his student, then she could have what she wanted from him and that was terrifying. It was so much worse than the drop that waited below her.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When she had still been in Scotland and her world was falling down around her, Remus had sat by her side and listened to her theories. He had gently poked holes in the ones that held no merit and expanded ones that showed promise. He held no expectations for her to be immediately able to save Harry. He didn’t look across the room with hopeful eyes like Neville or the Weasleys that visited Elgin with supplies. Luna had been certain that, with Draco keeping Harry alive that, Hermione was the one who could wake him up. But Remus was the one that made her </span>
  <em>
    <span>feel</span>
  </em>
  <span> like she could be. Maybe. One day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The last time he was here, she had gone through each of her theories one by one as if he could pick the right one out of the line-up. He had been so patient with her, and his eyes had warmed from green to gold as she had shown off her most recent discoveries that she thought could help. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But that had been two years ago, that had been after two visits from Charlie Weasley where they had gotten so drunk that she had fallen asleep on the floor of her kitchen. She had been visited by Kingsley and when she had shown him her work she had felt like a schoolgirl asking for praise. He had been kind and had some very good points surrounding the poisoning theory she had floated with him, but he was too imposing, and she didn’t know him well enough to trust that he would consider her theories valid. She had been visited by Fluer once, during which they had bonded far more effectively than they had in the Weasley’s back garden. Fleur had a brilliant methodical brain, and they had talked about Muggle psychology and any physical issues that could be affecting Harry, but they had come to no new answers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus was the only one who made her failed avenues feel like progress; he was the only one who had talked her through her breakdown surrounding brain swelling that she had come across in a Muggle medical journal. He had put his warm hands on her temples, pressing in soothing circles that had helped her relax. He was who she felt closest to even when they had only seen each other once in more than two years and he was who she waited for now. </span>
