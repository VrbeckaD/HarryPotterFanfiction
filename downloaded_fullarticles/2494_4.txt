    <p>Hermione sighed, Ron is out again. He is never home these days, he never goes to work, he is ALWAYS at the bar, drinking, using HER money and bringing girls into HER apartment.<br/> <br/> She sighed again, thinking. If Ronald brings another girl here tonight, she's divorcing him. That sounds odd. Everyone thought that they belonged together. Hermione and Ron. Ron and Hermione. Romione.<br/> <br/> But Hermione doesn't think so. At least not while Ron is being an arse.<br/> <br/> "I'm divorcing him," Hermione said, her voice raspy from not being used for several hours. It sounds off. Hermione stood up, she picked up the heaviest book on her table, <em>Find your Animagus Form</em>, and hurled it at the wall.<br/> <br/> The 2000 page book created a hole in the newly painted wall, but Hermione chose to ignore it.<br/> <br/> "I, Hermione Jean Granger, am divorcing my husband, Ronald Billius Weasley because he is a big, fat, arse! He is a pig who doesn't do any work! He is a cheat and a stupid drunk! I am divorcing him because he doesn't care about me at all!" Hermione's voice bounced around the house.<br/> <br/> Hermione panted, she was surprised by her outburst, she has never, ever, thrown a book in her life! But at least it sounds right now. It sounds sort of official.</p><p>She waved her wand and the book flew back to where it was before it was hurled at the wall. She waved it once more and the wall fixed itself almost instantly. She put her wand into her pocket and walked into the kitchen to make herself a midnight snack. She was just pouring milk into her cereal when she heard the front door open.<br/> <br/> Ron's voice called, "I'm home!" From the way he spoke, she knew immediately that he wasn't drunk. She frowned, confused, if he wasn't drinking, then where was he? She walked to greet him but froze when she saw who he was with.<br/> <br/> Lavender Brown.<br/> <br/> "WonWon, you said that you told her!" Lavender accuse as she clings onto Ron's arm.<br/> <br/> "Yeah. Well......" He shuffled a bit backward when he saw the hurt look on Hermione's face.<br/> <br/> "So you have been cheating on me for how long?" Hermione's voice was soft and the softer her voice gets, the more dangerous she is. But Ron didn't know that.<br/> <br/> "Oh, not that long. Just 9 months."<br/> <br/> Hermione pointed at the door behind him. "Get out of my house."<br/> <br/> Lavender giggled, "Do you think you can kick Ron out of his own house?"<br/> <br/> Hermione's eyes narrowed, "This house has been mine for 2 years, I shared it with Ronald because he was my husband. But I'm signing the divorce paper tomorrow. The sooner he gets out of my life, the better" she spat, her voice bitter.<br/> <br/> "What? No! I've paid the money for this house for 2 years!" Ron exclaimed loudly.<br/> <br/> Hermione snorted, "How could you have paid if you don't even have a job? I paid for everything that goes in this house, none of them are yours."<br/> <br/> Ron's face grew red as a tomato and he yelled, "That's not true! If I weren't so famous, you wouldn't even HAVE a job! I'm the reason that you're even alive!"<br/> <br/> Hermione sneered, "Yeah, right, like I'm not the brightest witch of our generation AND the brains of the golden trio."<br/> <br/> Eyes narrowed, Ron shoved her, and Hermione staggered backward. "How dare you!"<br/> <br/> Ron just smirked and pointing his wand at her chest, right above her heart, he muttered a spell under his breath. Hermione gasped, clutching her chest, her heart had become ice cold! Ignoring Hermione's cries, Lavender opened the door and pushed her into the streets, shutting the door with a loud BANG before Hermione could scramble back into her apartment.<br/> <br/> Inside, Ron was laughing so hard that snot flew out of his nostrils. "That was brilliant, LavLav." He bent down and placed a kiss on Lavender's cheek, earning a giggle from the witch.<br/> <br/> Outside, unshed tears were threatening to spill onto Hermione's cheeks. She apparated to the Burrow, the pain in her chest that the spell had caused was slowly spreading towards the rest of her body.</p><p>When she arrived at the Burrow, she found it empty.</p><p>The curse that Ron had cast drained her, and with almost no hope, she used her remaining strength to apparate to Shell Cottage.</p><p>The last thing she saw was Bill rushing at her, his face filled with concern.</p><p>“Bill,” Hermione whispered, just before everything went black.<strike></strike></p><hr/><p> </p><p>"Oh my god, Hermione!" Someone gasped, the voice, it sounds familiar, like a voice she hears every day...... Harry? </p><p>Why is he here? Isn't he is supposed to be on his honeymoon with Ginny?! She tried to open her eyes but they were sealed shut. She tried sitting up, but her body felt like bricks. She couldn't move at all! Oh hell. Is she petrified again? It feels exactly like how she did back in second year.</p><p>"Hermione!" this time a female voice. </p><p>Ginny.</p><p>She rushed to Hermione's side and placed her pale hand onto Hermione's. Hermione could feel the warmth of Ginny's hand and dismissed her theory of herself being petrified. </p><p>She couldn't feel anything while she was petrified. She couldn't do anything but listen to everything around her.</p><p>"Bill, what happened to her?! She's colder than ice!" Ginny sounded genuinely worried about her, and Hermione can't help but feel her heart swell, just a tiny bit.</p><p>"It seems that someone has cursed her with the <em>tardalius mortemus.  </em>It is really advanced. It gives someone a slow and very painful death." Bill's deep voice rang out from somewhere to her left.</p><p> Hermione's heart swelled larger when she heard the sorrow and pain in his voice.</p><p>For her.</p><p>So that's the spell that Ron had cast. She has never heard of it.</p><p>"But who would do something like that?" asked Ginny, horrified.</p><p>"So there isn't any way to save her?" Harry asked Bill, he would do anything to save his best friend. Or rather, sister.</p><p>Bill hesitated but after ten long seconds, he said reluctantly, "There is a way, but I don't think she would like it."</p><p> </p><p> </p>
