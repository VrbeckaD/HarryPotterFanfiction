          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale starts in a secret room near Ravenclaw Tower that only two people in the whole school know exist, Colin Creevey and Rowena Ravenclaw. Rowena is curious about Colin's camera.</p><p>Rowena shook the camera and asked, "How does this muggle contraption work?"</p><p>Colin said, "Don't shake it like that, you might break it." He added, "Here, give it to me and I can show you, if you like?"</p><p>Rowena handed him the camera and insisted, "Teach me."</p><p>Colin showed her how the camera worked and took a picture of her.</p><p>He held the camera up and stated, "See, there's the picture I just took."</p><p>Rowena gasped. "Wow, that's amazing." </p><p>Colin shrugged and smirked. "It's just a camera."</p><p>Rowena inquired, "What's that metal plate for?"</p><p>Colin told her, "It's the flash, makes pictures brighter."</p><p>Rowena queried, "May I have a go?"</p><p>Colin smiled. "Sure."</p><p>Rowena took the camera off him and took a picture of him.</p><p>She held the camera up to him and grinned. "I prefer the real thing."</p><p>"Pictures are never as good as the real thing," said Colin in agreement. He went on, "Would you like to go on a date with me, Rowena?"</p><p>Rowena beamed, "Of course, I'll pick the location."</p><p>Colin smiled. "I look forward to it."</p></div>
