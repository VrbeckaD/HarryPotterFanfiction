    <p>I felt my stomach sink to my feet as I slowly approached the sorting hat. All eyes were on me, the tension in the air palpable. I sat down on the stool and the hat was slowly lowered over my head. It fell over my eyes and the world went dark. </p><p>
  <em>Ah, another Black. Very interesting. You are very intelligent, and brave..very brave.</em>
</p><p>“No,” I whispered, the word catching in the back of my throat.</p><p>
  <em>No? Alright then, you are quite cunning and ambitious. </em>
</p><p>I nodded, willing the hat to choose the only acceptable house. I didn’t want to be a disgrace as well.</p><p>
  <em>You would do well in Ravenclaw. You have all the necessary intelligence and determination for it. </em>
</p><p>“Please,” I muttered.</p><p><em>Very well.</em> “SLYTHERIN!”</p><p>I was standing up as soon as the word began. Professor McGonagall took the hat off and I walked over to the Slytherin table, my back straight and proud. I had made it. I had succeeded where my brother had not.</p><p>One of the older Slytherins, a tall boy with long blonde hair that I recognized vaguely from some dinner parties, motioned for me to sit next to him. I slid into the seat next to him. A few seats away, I caught Narcissa’s eye and she gave me a small smile.</p><p>“So, Regulus Black, is that right?” The tall blond boy smiled down at me, but it didn’t reach his grey eyes.</p><p>I nodded silently.</p><p>“I am Lucius Malfoy, a prefect. I will be helping you acclimate to Hogwarts, though I am sure you already know almost everything, given your family.”</p><p>I nodded again, not meeting his eyes.</p><p>“Speaking of which...I’m pleased to see that you did not follow your brother’s example, I was beginning to think the Black family was growing soft.”</p><p>My face flushed, “The Black family is as strong as ever,” I insisted, my voice coming out squeakier than I’d like. “I would watch my words if I were you, the Black family could reap dishonor on yours without a second thought. Or have you forgotten the incident so soon?”</p><p>Lucius raised an eyebrow, “I see, it seems you have some spine in you after all.” His voice was as regal as ever, but his eyes darted to the side. I had hit a nerve.</p><p>I looked back down at my empty plate, my back a little straighter, this was going to be easier than I had thought. It had better be, I had prepared tirelessly for the worst, it seemed all this work was starting to pay off already.</p><p>Dinner was a somewhat silent affair, at least for my part. Cheerful young Slytherins chatted all around me: foolish children, who had no idea what awaited them in the real world. I kept to my plate. None of these people were worth my time. Cousin Narcissa looked my way a couple of times, but she seemed busy with the dark-haired boys on either side of her, so I refrained from trying to engage in a conversation. </p><p>It seemed like an eternity before we were finally dismissed to our dorms. Lucius began herding the other first years toward the Slytherin dorms. I followed close behind him, but not close enough to seem clingy. We were just starting down the stairs to the dungeon when I felt a hand on my arm. Before I could react, I was pulled into a side corridor and found myself facing the person I dreaded the most.</p><p>Sirius, only a second year, already had the air of the coolest person in school. His hair had grown out to a curly mess that continuously fell in his eyes and his tie was draped over his shoulders instead of tied. He looked ridiculous.</p><p>On either side of me, holding my arms to make sure I couldn’t walk away, were two other boys. One bespeckled and short. He looked somewhat familiar. The other was awkward looking and pale. He looked like he’d rather be anywhere else. His grip was loose.</p><p>“Hello, little brother,” Sirius leaned against the wall, arms crossed.</p><p>“Sirius,” I put as much venom as I could in the one word.</p><p>Sirius frowned, his cool demeanor slipping slightly, “I wanted to welcome you to Hogwarts. And I wanted you to know, if you ever need anything, I’m here.”</p><p>Ah, so it was veiled threats. This was unusual for Sirius, he always seemed the overly passionate type. It must be his new friends’ influence. I raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Sirius shook his head and stood up, “This is pointless,” he said to his friends.</p><p>The pale one let go of me as if he had just found out I had the plague.</p><p>The boy with the glasses did not move, “But Sirius, you said--”</p><p>“Yeah, well he’s fully indoctrinated, there’s no point trying to break him out of that.”</p><p>I considered speaking up but thought the better of it. There was no point in talking to these blood traitors.</p><p>“Alright.” The boy reluctantly let go of me. </p><p>This had been a massive waste of time. I walked away, not meeting any of their eyes.</p><p>“Wait, Reg.”</p><p>I stopped in the doorway, I’m not sure why, but I didn’t turn around.</p><p>Sirius walked up behind me, “I know you don’t believe me right now, about any of this, but if you ever do, I’m right here, okay?”</p><p>I looked up at him, his grey eyes were wide, he appeared to be in earnest. “Don’t waste my time,” I muttered. His eyes seemed to shatter into a million pieces as he realized what I had said. I walked away.</p><p>It was sweet, in a way, Sirius’s dedication to the idea that I would somehow change my ways. He didn’t understand, I wasn’t lost, I wasn’t just going along with what I had been taught. This was my choice, and I wasn’t about to give that up.</p><p>I was a fair distance into the dungeons when I realized I had no idea where I was going. The other Slytherins were long gone, and this entire place was totally unfamiliar. I sighed and sat down on the floor to think. Of course, Sirius hadn’t actually wanted a heart to heart, he had just wanted to separate me from the others. He probably was hoping that I would spend my first night at Hogwarts on the dungeon floor. I was determined not to give him that satisfaction. I stood back up and began retracing myself, hoping I could find a teacher or someone still in the Great Hall. </p><p>When I reached the steps I saw a Slytherin girl sitting at the top of the stairs. She looked a few years older than me, and she was gorgeous. Her curly black hair hung like a cloud around her head and her dark eyes shone with intelligence as she looked at me.</p><p>“Evening,” she said, looking amused at my no-doubt embarrassing expression.</p><p>I schooled my face back into its usual passiveness, “Good evening. I’m sorry to bother you, but I seem to have lost my way, could you show me to the Slytherin dormitories?”</p><p>She stood up, “Of course.” She walked down the steps and started leading me through the dungeons. “Do you have a name, first year?”</p><p>“I’m Regulus Black.”</p><p>“Hazel Zabini. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Regulus.”</p>
