          <div class="userstuff"><p>Sirius was dead tired. He was tired of running, tired of hiding, tired of being a fugitive.</p><p>Right now, he was trying to find a place to take refuge. Not only was the wizarding world hunting him down, but muggles too were keeping an eye out for him.</p><p>Every headline read the same ’Dangerous Sirius Black’, ‘Notorious Sirius Black’… He doubted there was a person left who would believe him, believe the truth.</p><p>At that moment, Sirius thought of you. He tried not to in Azkaban, those happy thoughts would have only drawn the dementors straight to him. In fact, his memories of you were his happiest ones.</p><p>He could picture your smiling face so clearly, the sun shining on you, your hair shimmering. He should’ve told you back then how he felt.</p><p>Why was he so damn scared to tell you? You were one of his closest friends, but he wanted you to be so much more.</p><p>Now after spending 12 years Azkaban, there wasn’t much he could lose now except for maybe his sanity.</p><p>He had plenty of chances to tell you before. James and Remus were constantly on his case about it. God, even Lily got involved eventually. But, in fact, he had tried! Yet, it resulted in a ridiculous promise instead.</p><p>If there was one thing Sirius knew for sure, he was over 30 and single.<br/>…</p><p>“Heard you broke up with that Prefect, babe,” Sirius snickered joining you on the bench.</p><p>You shrugged closing your book and setting it aside, “He got boring.”</p><p>Sirius laughed, “Got boring?… He’s a Prefect, that’s guaranteed boredom! Bad choice if you were looking for excitement.”</p><p>“Heard you dumped that girl from potions,” you pointed out.</p><p>“How’d you hear about that, already?” he narrowed his eyes. “It just happened this morning at breakfast.”</p><p>“Oh I know, she was crying and bitching about you in the girl’s lavatory to all her friends,” you added in a playful tone.</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes, “It wasn’t like we were anything serious.”</p><p>“Got your eyes set on someone else, hm?”</p><p>“Not necessarily, but-”</p><p>“She wanted a commitment, something more meaningful than getting to second base in the common room?”</p><p>Sirius smiled, “Something like that.”</p><p>“In fact, Padfoot darling,” you mused. “I believe I’m the only girl left in Hogwarts whose heart you haven’t broken.”</p><p>“Asking me out, sweetheart?” Sirius leaned closer to you.</p><p>Honestly, the thought of dating Sirius scared you, because you did love him. You were head over heels in love with him, but all that meant was that he had the power to completely crush you.</p><p>You scoffed, “Please, Sirius, if you ever broke my heart, I would have to hex you so bad no girl or boy would look at you the same way!”</p><p>“Who says I would break your heart!?” Sirius shot up from his seat. “You are just as notorious as I am. If anything you’d break mine.”</p><p>“Alright, then, we agree,” You swallowed thickly.</p><p>“Agree to what?” he asked lifting his eyebrow.</p><p>“Agree not to date, ever.”</p><p>“Ever?” he repeated slack-jawed.</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>“But-” Sirius’s eyes darted back and forth. “That seems pretty extreme.”</p><p>“So what? You want to risk our friendship for just a few chances to snog?” you groaned.</p><p>“It just seems like a waste to not even try, y/n,” Sirius argued. “What if you’re the one for me?”</p><p>You sighed loudly, trying to play it cool, but he was not letting up and you were running out of excuses. It was tempting to say yes, but both of you were notorious players. It seemed so unlikely that it would work out.</p><p>“How about a promise?” you finally proposed.</p><p>“A promise?”</p><p>“Yep,” you nodded looking him straight in the eye. “Let’s say, if both of us are still single at 30 we get married?”</p><p>“Married!” Sirius shouted clearly startled. “That’s quite different from dating.”</p><p>“I just mean, like a pact,” you quickly explained. “Just think of all the hearts we’ll break between now to then?… Maybe you are the one for me, Sirius.”</p><p>Sirius smirked, “So what you’re saying is that once we’ve exhausted all other options that we might as well just be with each other?”</p><p>“I suppose that’s the gist of it.”</p><p>“You’re lucky you’re worth the wait,” Sirius winked.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>“So how’d it go, Padfoot?” James asked slinging an arm around Sirius’s shoulders, as he hopped into the seat next to him.</p><p>The Great Hall was bustling as students made their way in and out for lunch.</p><p>“It went…” Sirius drawled.</p><p>“It went?” Remus questioned sitting across from Sirius and pouring himself a cup of pumpkin juice.</p><p>“Don’t tell us you didn’t tell her!” James whined. “Who knows the next time she’ll be available?”</p><p>“Listen,” Sirius started to explain. “I tried! I did! But it led elsewhere…”</p><p>“Elsewhere? How could “Y/n I love you!” go elsewhere?” James argued, taking a bite out of a roll.</p><p>“I didn’t tell her that!” Sirius huffed. “I tested the waters… and well, in 14 or so years we’ll be married.”</p><p>“What?” they said simultaneously.</p><p>The look on James and Remus’s faces when he told them about the pact was priceless.</p><p>“Well, that definitely is elsewhere,”  Remus chuckled.</p><p>Sirius groaned, burying his head in his hands, “Why couldn’t I just tell her?”</p><p>“Honestly, it’s not that hard, mate. Watch,” James instructed. He stood up and spotted Lily at the opposite end of the long table.</p><p>“Hey, Evans!” he shouted drawing her attention to him. “I love you!”</p><p>She rolled her eyes and tried to ignore him.</p><p>James, as usual, was persistent, as quick as he could he headed over to where Lily was sitting.</p><p>Remus shook his head and sighed, “Perhaps, that’s what you’re so afraid of.”</p><p> </p><p>….</p><p>Sirius took a deep breath. This was a longshot. He was aware of that. But he had no one he could turn to. And this, this was the one thing he wanted to do before hunting that rat bastard down.</p><p>He couldn’t believe his eyes as he peered into the window. There you were, somehow even more beautiful than he remembered.</p><p>You were busy cooking dinner. He watched a while longer just to make sure that you were alone.</p><p>This could be his last chance after all. Throwing caution to the wind, Sirius transformed from being a dog back to a man.</p><p>He tried your doorknob and to his surprise, it was unlocked. Quietly, he walked into your home.</p><p>“Y/n?”</p><p>Immediately, the bowl you were holding slipped from your grasp and shattered on the floor. You couldn’t believe your eyes.</p><p>“Please don’t scream, y/n, please,” Sirius begged.</p><p>You clutched your chest, tears threatening to fall. He looked so different, so thin.</p><p>“Sirius?” Carefully, you tiptoed towards him. Your fingertips brushed against his cheek, his face was pale and gaunt.</p><p>He seemed slightly startled by the physical contact but relaxed noting how long it had it been since he’s felt this kind of gentleness.</p><p>He smiled, but you could tell underneath that he wanted to cry with you.</p><p>“Y/n, I…” Sirius didn’t know where to start. Should he try to convince you of his innocence? Explain why he escaped? Tell you how he feels?</p><p>His eyes searched yours, but he couldn’t get himself to speak. This was wrong, he shouldn’t be getting you involved.</p><p>“So whose heart have you broken, now?” you teased, wiping away a few stray tears.</p><p>“What?” Sirius blinked in surprise.</p><p>“Sirius Black showing up out of nowhere…” you explained placing a hand on your hip. “You’re a few years late.”</p><p>“Sorry about that, love,” he murmured, catching on to your game. A clever way for you to let him know that you’re still single, that you still remembered.</p><p>“Does a summer wedding sound good to you?” you joked.</p><p>“Best time of the year for a wedding, in my opinion,” he played along.</p><p>God how he missed this, the banter, the flirting… just being able to be himself with you. You understood him in a way, very few people did.</p><p>“I think a small guest list would be best, practical you know?” you continued. You waved your wand and pieces of shattered glass reassembled themselves.</p><p>“Really? I always figured you’d want to invite everyone, really rub it in their faces that you’re officially off the market.”</p><p>“That sounds more like you, dear,” you smirked.</p><p>Sirius froze for a moment, spotting his reflection in a mirror. He barely recognized himself. He was an absolute mess covered in God knows what. He probably didn’t smell too great either.</p><p>He gulped, feeling his confidence slip away, “I’m quite a sight.”</p><p>“You just need to wash up!” You showed Sirius to your bathroom, “Help yourself to anything.”</p><p>“Anything?” Sirius purred.</p><p>“Sirius,” you stated in a stern voice, but you smiled. “Let’s save the flirting until after your shower.”</p><p>He laughed, already starting to strip before even closing the bathroom door.</p><p>The warm water felt so pleasant as Sirius stepped into the shower.</p><p>He couldn’t believe how it felt to be with you again. For the first time in a decade, Sirius felt human, not just an empty shell. He could feel all the muscles in his body relax, as he started to get comfortable.</p><p>He was so worried, that everything would feel awkward and different, that maybe you wouldn’t even give him a chance. But you did, you welcomed him with open arms.</p><p>He took his time scrubbing every inch of himself. It only makes sense, when someone spends most of their time as a dog, the dirt and grime really start to build up.</p><p>Finally, feeling clean Sirius stepped out of the shower. His face looked a little bit better already.</p><p>“Y/n sweetheart, that smells fantastic,” Sirius complimented walking into the kitchen.</p><p>You laughed, “It’s just soup-”</p><p>You almost choked seeing Sirius. He was practically naked, just a towel loosely hanging around his hips.</p><p>“Are you hungry, too?” he wiggled his brow. “Cause you’re drooling.”</p><p>“Well, I’m sure if I were topless, you’d also be drooling too.”</p><p>“Actually, just the thought alone is pretty tempting.”</p><p>You shook your head, “Did you come here for refuge and to reconnect or just to get laid?”</p><p>“Can’t it be both?” he shrugged.</p><p>“Sirius,” you sighed. You had so many questions. Why was he here? What exactly happened that night? What was he planning on doing now?</p><p>“I know, y/n,” he muttered, he knew what you were thinking and you had every right to be wary, but he wasn’t ready to bring all that up. Not when he was just starting to remember what happy felt like.</p><p>“There are so many things for us to discuss but…” he pleaded. “But for right now, for tonight, let me have this.”</p><p>You cupped both sides of his face and looked into those gray eyes you loved so much.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll pretend everything is fine,” you murmured.</p><p>You tilted your head and pressed your lips to his. At first, Sirius didn’t react, until he recovered from the shock of what was happening.</p><p>Cautiously, he held your waist and pulled you closer to him. The kiss began to heat up as your lips parted and his tongue slipped into your mouth.</p><p>You moaned at the sensation of his tongue rolling against yours.</p><p>Sirius smirked against your lips. He then breaks the kiss and latches onto your neck. His kisses are desperate and hungry. His tongue explores your tender skin and his teeth nibble on the nape of your neck.</p><p>You threw your head back, giving him better access to explore your other sweet spots, “More.”</p><p>“I’m happy to oblige,” Sirius helped you out of your shirt and bra, dropping both onto the floor.</p><p>You shuffled out of your shorts and kicked them aside. You touched across his chest and over his shoulders. Studying the symbols tattooed on his pale skin. You ran your fingers through his damp hair. This time you peppered him with kisses all over his collarbone.</p><p>You kissed along his jawline feeling his stubble and beard tickling your cheek. Your breasts pushed against his chest.</p><p>The skin to skin contact felt amazing.</p><p>Feeling your hands and body pressed against his skin healed him in a way nothing else ever could. All those years spent numb and alone immediately erased by your warm and loving touch.</p><p>“Don’t stop touching me,” he mewled. “I don’t think I’ve needed anything more.”</p><p>All he wanted was to be with you like this forever. To remain forever in your warmth, to not ever have to feel that coldness again.</p><p>You noticed the towel he was wearing was starting to pitch a tent. Carefully you palmed his erection and watched as Sirius closed his eyes and bit his lip.</p><p>You could feel how long and thick his cock was through the fabric. It didn’t take much for you to undo it, letting the towel fall to his feet.</p><p>His moans were music to your ears as you stroked the shaft of his cock. He grabbed your hand, tugging it away from his dick.</p><p>“Sorry,” he chuckled lightly. “But I won’t last long if you continue.”</p><p>Sirius guided you onto your back on the floor. He positioned himself between your legs, rubbing the tip of cock between your folds. He used your wetness to lubricate his shaft.</p><p>Typically, he would’ve done so much more before fucking like rubbing your clit, edging you to the near brink of an orgasm, fingering your tight cunt. But he couldn’t hold out much longer, his self-control wearing thin.</p><p>He grunted and huffed as he pressed his cock inside of you. Your slick walls squeezed deliciously around his shaft.</p><p>“Sirius,” you gasped as his cock stretched your little hole.</p><p>He paused for a minute, allowing you time to adjust and giving himself a moment to admire your lovely face as it contorts.</p><p>He began to rock in and out of you. His cock reaching deeper and deeper into your cunt. Your back arched as he hit your g-spot.</p><p>You reached out, feeling his shoulder blades move and his muscles tighten.</p><p>You head started to spin as you became overwhelmed by pleasure. The only sounds you could hear were Sirius’s panting and the wet slapping sounds of your flesh and his making contact.</p><p>You can feel your climax building. Soon your toes curl and you tremble as your body drifts into a euphoric state.</p><p>Sirius’s nails dug into your thighs as he shudders against you. Your own orgasm causing him to cum. He grunts and growls loudly as he fills your pussy with his sperm.</p><p>His cock stayed buried in your cunt as he collapsed on top of you. That was probably the most intimate and emotional sex you’ve ever had.</p><p>The kitchen floor felt so cold against your hot skin. Needily, Sirius’s arms were wrapped tightly around your waist and his head nestled between your breasts.</p><p>“I love you, y/n. I wish I had told you sooner.”</p><p>You felt his tears run down onto your chest.</p><p>“I love you too,” you cooed playing with his hair.</p><p>“I want to stay but I can't…you deserve-”</p><p>“Shut it,” you reprimanded him. “I don’t want to hear that. You’re mine now, Sirius.”</p><p>“Y/n, I have to clear my name, I have to avenge James and Lily…” he explained, he nuzzled against you, needing more of your warmth. “I need to explain it all to my godson… to Harry.”</p><p>“Of course,” you swallowed, trying to hold back tears.</p><p>“We agreed on a summer wedding, right?” he mused quietly.</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>“I’ll have this all sorted out by then, I promise,” he assured. Sirius raised his head, his hand gently caressing the side of your face. “Think you can wait a little longer for me?”</p><p>“You’re worth the wait,” you whispered, placing your hand on top of his.</p></div>
