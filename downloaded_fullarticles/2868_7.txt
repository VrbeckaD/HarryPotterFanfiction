    <p>To one moment be dead, and the next, be a wailing newborn is a bit strange to be frank, though I don’t remember my infant years, and didn’t get all my memories from my last life until I was 10 years of age. Though, to be honest, I have no recollection of any of the closely personal memories of that life.</p><p>I remember being a highly accomplished veterinarian; mainly for exotic and unusual creatures. I also remember being a high functioning person on the Autism Spectrum, but my name, age, family and friends, and what I looked like was all a blur. Whenever I tried to remember when I was younger, I ended up with bad nose bleeds that freaked out my parents, so I just gave up on trying to remember, as it was no longer important to me.</p><p>Speaking of parents, my mother and father were strange. “Strange” as in they were both a witch and a wizard, but not in the Wiccan sense, but in the Harry Potter kind— one of the few things I remember from my previous life with <em> some </em> clarity.</p><p>Another thing that was strange was being born in 1900 New York, New York, when I was born originally in Michigan in either the 80s or 90s, possibly (the years were always blurred, but it <em> had </em> to have been in the far future than the year I was reborn in, seeing as I remember learning about World War II).</p><p>Now I was a New Yorker with an English accent, born in the 1900’s and looking like Jodie Whittaker when she played the 13th Doctor, thanks to my English-French father, Tomas Beaumont, with very little input from my American mother, Susan Beaumont nee Goldstein. However, Mother never really seemed to be all that bothered that I never took after her looks and personality wise.</p><p>Now? As I reflect back to my early life, both of my parents were gone; Mother dying from illness while Father followed a year later, when I was 14, of a broken heart. It hurt, and I mourned them both, yet my cousins Queenie and Porpentina– “Just <em> ‘Tina’ </em>!”– kept me sane as I started living with them the moment my father died.</p><p>Honestly? We were more like sisters than cousins, with how close we are to each other. Though, really? Things started to change… <em> We </em> started to change and grow as people when <em> he </em> came into our lives like a sudden storm. <em> He </em> appeared on December 6th, 1926 with a case <b> <em>filled</em> </b> with fantastic beasts.</p><p align="center">†††</p><p>I stood next to Tina in a beige trench coat over a long sleeved dark blue sweater, beige suspenders and wide-legged short pants and brown leather boots, munching away on a burger while she ate a hotdog slathered in mustard as we stood in the very back of the growing crowd. Standing on the steps was none other than Mary Lou Barebone, spewing her hate at everyone that was willing to listen. I frowned, while Tina glowered at the older woman, as I noticed how Credence seemed to have curled even more into himself.</p><p>“This great city sparkles with jewels of man’s inventions. Movie theaters, automobiles, the wireless electric lights, all dazzle and bewitch us!” Mary Lou called out just as a man in a blue peacoat brushed past us, making Tina smear mustard on her lips while I got ketchup on my fingers, which I licked off.</p><p>“Oh… So sorry,” he apologized, casting us both a quick look before moving forward, head tilted back as he looked around in wonder, as he moved between people, trying his damnedest not to actually touch anyone and hunching his shoulders up around his ears when he did. Oddly enough, his body language reminded me of something, but I could not put my finger on what.</p><p>“But where there is light, there is shadow, friend. Something is stalking our city, wreaking destruction, and then disappearing without a trace… Listen to me! <em> We </em> have to fight. You hear me? We have to fight together for the sake of our—” Mary Lou’s rant was cut short when a stocky man in an ill-fitting brown suit tripped and fell over the man in the blue peacoat’s suitcase.</p><p>“Hey! What it!” some rudely snapped at the poor man.</p><p>“I’m so sorry— My case—” Peacoat apologized.</p><p>My ears perked at hearing a distinctive English accent from the cinnamon haired man.</p><p>The man got up and exhaled slowly. “No harm done. Excuse me.” He then raced up the steps to the bank.</p><p>I edged forward as Tina nudged me, obviously her gut was telling her something, and not wanting to be seen by the linchpin of the Second Salemers, she wanted me to do a follow-up for her. Now I stood next to Mr. Peacoat, just as Mary Lou pointed in our direction.</p><p>“You!” Mr. Peacoat shrank back from her aggressive voice, turning to face her, but not once looking <em> at </em> her. His blue eyes stayed fixed on the space over her shoulder instead, his fingers tightly wrapped around the handle of his suitcase. “Friend.” Mary Lou stepped down a few steps. “What drew you to our meeting today?”</p><p>“Oh, I-I was just— passing.”</p><p>“Are you a seeker? A seeker after truth?”</p><p>“I’m more of a Chaser, really,” he replied, lips pulling up into a lopsided grin.</p><p>Quirking a brow, I eyed the man up and down. He <em> did </em> look a bit like a Chaser, but… “Nah, you look a wee bit like a Keeper,” I said loud enough for only him to hear, just for him to grin warily in my general direction.</p><p>“Hear my words, and heed my warning. And laugh if you dare: Witches live among us! We have to fight together for the sake of our children.” At this, I scoffed at her. “For the sake of tomorrow. What do you say to that, friend?”</p><p>The man seemed to have zoned out as he noticed something further up the steps. I followed his line of sight to see a creature digging through a homeless beggar’s hat filled with coins. The man looked over his shoulder at his suitcase before looking back at the creature, just as it disappeared inside.</p><p>“Excuse me,” he stated a bit rudely, rushing up the steps two at a time. I quickly followed behind him, wanting to see the little fur ball up close.</p><p>The inside of the bank was impressive, by No-Maj standards, as I came to a halt next to the strange man. Looking about, I looped my arm around one of his, trying to look casual, startling the poor man at the sudden contact. I casted him a side glance as a bank employee came over, looking at the freckled man suspiciously. “Can I help you, sir, ma’am?” he asked, eyeing us <em> both </em> now.</p><p>“No, I—” I elbowed the man in his side, “— <em> we </em> were just… just… waiting…”</p><p>“We’re hoping to open an account here. Just moved, you see?” I added, smiling at the suspicious employee. The man simply narrowed his eyes at us both, and so I tugged on my strange new companion’s arm and led us both over to a bench, which we both ended up sitting next to the No-Maj from earlier. Out of the corner of my eye, I spied Tina peering at us from behind a pillar. I rolled my eyes, finding her to be ridiculous.</p><p>“Hi. What brings you here?” asked the nervous No-Maj.</p><p>Mr. Freckles strained his neck, looking around to spot the creature, while I looked around people’s legs. “Same as you…” he replied distractedly.</p><p>“You’re here to get a loan to open up a bakery?” the No-Maj questioned, sounding flabbergasted at the odds.</p><p>“Yes.” Mr. Freckles replied shortly.</p><p>“What are the odds of that? Well, may the best man win, I guess,” the No-Maj said, offering the man next to me his hand to shake.</p><p>I spotted the creature, which I now noticed look a bit like a mole and a platypus, and nodded my head in its direction. The creature was now stealing coins from someone’s bag, shoving them into a pouch on its underbelly.</p><p>“Excuse me.” The man quickly got up, dragging me with him as my arm was still looped around his.</p><p>“Hey, mister… Hey, mister and lady!” the No-Maj shouted, trying to get the man’s attention as I peaked over my shoulder. In his hand was a large silver egg.</p><p><em> ‘Well, </em> that <em> isn’t strange at all.’ </em></p><p>The man did not seem to hear as he was too preoccupied trying to catch the critter.</p><p>“Hey, fella!” the man tried once more, just before we dashed too far away.</p><p>The stranger was surreptitiously pursuing the creature as it skittered through the bank, stealing shiny things left and right. We both spotted it removing a glittering buckle from a lady’s shoe before scurrying onward, eager for more shiny objects. We both watched, helpless, as it jumps lithely between cases and into bags, snatching and pilfering to its heart’s content. “That greedy bugger!”</p><p>“Gotta say, it has talent,” I piped up as we chased after the creature. I grunted as someone shoved me hard into my companion, forcing us both to swerve, luckily into the line that the woman who had the bag the creature disappeared in happened to be in. My companion stared intently over another woman’s shoulder, freaking her out a bit with how close he was. It finally hit me <em> why </em> his body language was so familiar. From the vague memories I had access to from the Before, I remembered how I tended to act, unintentionally ignoring social norms and etiquette as I had to work around my autism.</p><p>From our left, we heard coins clinking on the ground, as if someone dropped a handful of them, making us both look over to a leather bench. Sitting under it was the little creature gathering up the coins, while next to it was a woman with her Pug on a leash. Said Pug stared intently at the creature, just as the little beastie tried snatching the shiny charm from its collar, making the dog bark and snap at it.</p><p>Not wanting the little thing to get hurt, I let the man go and rushed over, diving down the try and snatch the beast up, while the man dropped his suitcase next to me and also got down on his knees, only for the creature to dance out of our reach and scurry up the fence that separated the general area from the employee’s only area. “Slippery little bugger!” I huffed, pressing up against the fence with the man, watching as the critter now shoved <em> gold </em> coins into its pouch.</p><p>The creature turned and faced us both, seeming to gloat at the man as it leaned over and placed its paws on the mound of gold being wheeled towards an elevator by security. “Oh dear…” the man breathed out, looking as if he was getting ready to Apparate to the stairwell on the other side that leads down to where the beast just went.</p><p>“Hey! Mr. English Guy, Ms. English Lady!” It was the No-Maj from earlier! Now holding a shaking silver egg. “I think your egg is hatching.” We both turned to the elevator, seeing the doors close, just as my companion pulled out his wand, making my eyes widen as I looked around at the other No-Majs in the building. Without saying anything, the man pointed his wand at the other male, forcing him to zoom right into us, sandwiching me between them both, and Apparated us all down the stairwell.</p><p>A bit dizzy, I fell back against the cinnamon haired man’s chest as I got over the feeling of sidelong Apparation. The silver egg shook more, just as a tiny beak broke through, making the No-Maj gasp while the wizard softly shushed him while I was still pressed against his chest. “What just happened?” the No-Maj whispered, stunned as Mr. Tall and English carelessly placed his wand between his teeth and gently took the egg from the other, the newborn creature chirping as its head finally broke free from the shell.</p><p>I stared, completely transfixed, at the beautiful new life that had the coloration that reminded me of regular hummingbirds. Mr. English was also giddy, as he stared down at me before casting a bright look at the stunned No-Maj.</p><p>“Why hello there, sweetie. Look at how <em> gorgeous </em> your are~!” I cheered, following the strange wizard down the steps.</p><p>We both came to a stop in front of the vaults, the man placing his case down and opening it with his free hand, the other cradling the egg. “In you hop,” he said, gently placing the egg into his suitcase as a multitude of animal noises came from the inconspicuous thing. “No,” he frowned, warning the others to stay in there as they wanted to see the new addition. “Everyone settle down. S-Stay. Dougal don’t make me come in there.” I covered my mouth with my hand, muffling a giggle. He sounded like an exasperated mother scolding his unruly children. “Don’t make me come down there.” I heard a sound coming from his coat, but didn’t see what made it as we both looked towards the vault door, only to see the critter <em> somehow </em> squeeze through the cracks and get into the vault. “Absolutely not!” He frowned, pulling out his wand. <em> “Alohomora.” </em></p><p>I hung back, watching as he broke into the vault, just as a bank employee came down the stairs. “Oh, so you’re gonna <em> steal </em> the money, huh?” The man hissed, hitting the alarm.</p><p><em> “Petrificus Totalus!” </em> I called out, brandishing my 11 ½ inch cherry wood with Thunderbird tail feather core wand, watching as the man’s body locked up in a full body bind before falling over like a board.</p><p>“Mr. Bingley!” the No-Maj said in a high pitched voice, his face going pale as I moved passed him to watch the vault open.</p><p>The tall man sighed, looking exasperated at the critter that sat in one of the boxes on top of a pile of cash, necklaces hanging from one of its hind legs while another was sticking out of its pouch, a gold bar slowly vanishing inside it. “Really?” And then snatched the little beastie around its middle and holding the thing upside down.  A waterfall of valuables fell from the pouch, the little creature flailing about as it tried to keep its shiny things inside the pouch. “No. Don’t play that,” the man scolded the creature, now holding it by its hind feet in one hand. I giggled as he begun tickling it. “Look,” even more valuables fell out, and he had to shuffle back so none of it fell on his toes.</p><p>“What a naughty boy you are,” I laughed, taking a guess of the creature’s sex based off my former veterinarian knowledge… though how it translated over to magical creatures, I had no clue. I gently ran my fingers along <em> his </em> sides, making the thing chitter and wiggle in the other’s hand as even <em> more </em> shiny things poured out. “Oh, so you’re super ticklish, huh? Good to know!” I chimed, moving my fingers up along his sides, his fur so soft and silky, while the man just watched me tickle the beastie dangling from his hand. My fingers froze, though, as I heard footsteps approaching us, making me crane my neck to look over my shoulder.</p><p>Guards started rushing down the stairs, and the No-Maj started freaking out, with good reason. “Oh no. No, no, no. Don’t… Don’t shoot!” he pleaded as the freckled man and I rushed forward, with him picking up his suitcase along the way. My fingers curled around the necks of their coats, focusing on where I wished for us to be as the No-Maj held up his hands. “Don’t shoot!” he screamed, just as I Disapparated all three of us.</p><p align="center">†††</p><p>Now we were outside the bank, and once again I was trapped between both men, however this time I was chest to chest with the Brit. We both blinked at each other, just to hear the critter start chattering unhappily. “Right.” He backed away from me, placing his case on the grown and opening it. “For the <em> last </em> time, <em> you pilfering pest </em> , paws <b>off</b> what doesn’t belong to you.” He scolded, dropping the poor thing into his suitcase.</p><p>“Someone’s robbing the bank!” someone yelled from the street, just as the No-Maj got his footing, staring at us both like we were insane… which we might be. Who knows, it’s the 1900’s!</p><p>“Awfully sorry about  that,” the Brit apologized, sounding a bit breathless from the whole ordeal.</p><p>People yelling and whistles being blown acted a white noise as the No-Maj leaned against the wall, internally freaking out as he gestured to the tall man’s case. “What the <em> hell </em> was that?” I shrugged, having no clue.</p><p>“Nothing that need concern you,” he replied, moving over and adjusting the man’s suit. “Now, unfortunately, you have seen far too much.” I winced. Could he make that sound anymore <em> ominous </em>? “If you wouldn’t mind, if you just stand there, this’ll be over in a jiffy.”</p><p>“Mmm-hmm… Sure. Yeah.” The No-Maj agreed sarcastically as the wizard turned around.</p><p>“Look—!” I was a bit late in the warning as the No-Maj used one of the suitcases to smack the wizard across the face, knocking the poor fellow over. Falling to me knees, I gently inspected his face, nibbling on my lower lip. “Sorry, I was a tad late in the warning, it seems.”</p><p>The man shranked away, casting his gaze elsewhere as he slowly got back to his feet, rubbing where he got smacked. “Bugger,” he swore, watching the stocky man disappear in the crowd, just as Tina turned down the alleyway. The man quickly composed himself, picking up his case before offering me a hand. Startled, I grabbed it and allowed him to haul me up to my feet, and began leading us passed Tina… Or, at least, he might have if this wasn’t <em> Tina </em> of all people. She grabbed his other arm and Disapparated with all of us into another alley, where she shoved the man against a brick wall.</p><p>“Who are you?” she demanded, looking flustered as she casted me an exasperated look.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” The man leaned against the wall, catching his breath and he stared at the my feet, not wanting to look at Tina.</p><p>“Who are you?” she asked again, a bit softer now.</p><p>“Newt Scamander. And you both are?”</p><p>“Don’t you dare!” Tina suddenly exclaimed, pointing a finger at me as she knew what I was probably going to say. She never liked my puns unlike Queenie.</p><p>I simply raised my hands in surrender, smiling cheekily as she narrowed her eyes at me. Newt just looked between us, looking a tad bit confused.</p><p>“What’s that thing in your case?” questioned Tina, getting back on track.</p><p>“That’s my Niffler,” he answered, finally looking up at Tina. “Say, you’ve got something on your…” he pointed at her lip, getting a bit too close which cause the brunette to smack his hand away.</p><p>I coughed into my fist, catching her attention. “Mustard,” is all I said, amused I she pulled out a napkin and started wiping at her mouth.</p><p>Balling up the napkin and shoving it in her pocket, she frowned at him. “Why in the name of Deliverance Dane did you let that thing loose?”</p><p>“I didn’t mean to. He’s incorrigible, you see.”</p><p>“Yes! I was right!” I pumped a fist in the air, drawing their attention. “What?” I quirked an eyebrow at them both, watching as Newt gave me a quick lopsided smile, before looking above my head after catching my eye for a split second. “I guessed the… Niffler, right?” Newt nodded in confirmation. “Yes, okay. I guessed the Niffler was male down in the vaults, and he just confirmed it for me. So I feel great.”</p><p>Newt cleared his throat as he looked back down. “Anything shiny, he’s all over—”</p><p>“You didn’t mean to?” Tina cut in, silently fuming.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“You could not have chosen a worse time to let that creature loose.” Now Tina began stressing herself out. “We’re in the middle of a situation here!” Newt’s eyes grew wide as he quickly looked around, looking uneasy at us both. “I’m taking you in.”</p><p>“Taking me in where?” Newt questioned, flustered as both Tina and I pulled out our identifications.</p><p>“Magical Congress of the United States of America.” We both stated at the same time, making the man fidget nervously.</p><p>“So you both work for MACUSA.” It was a statement, not a question. “What are you both, some kind of investigator?”</p><p>I pointed at my cousin as she put her ID away, while I carelessly shoved mine in my pocket. “Tina is. I’m apart of the Magical Creatures Registration.”</p><p>“There’s a registration?”</p><p>“Sure is. It’s mainly for foreign witches and wizards that bring creatures from their home country. It helps if someone tries to sell ‘em on the black market, or if their owners misplaced them, though a <em> lot </em> of my co-workers find it to be complete rubbish, but that’s cause they can’t pull their own heads out of their asses.” I explained. “Meaning, Mr. Scamander, I will be needing any and all information about your Niffler,” I grinned as Tina huffed.</p><p>“Umm, you can tell me to sod off, however I thought MACUSA didn’t allow non-American citizens to work for them?” Newt looked perplexed, his brows furrowed as he tilted his head slightly.</p><p>Tina snorted, looking amused as I lightly smacked her arm. “You’d be correct, but you see, I have joint citizenship between the US and England, thanks to my father being a citizen of England, while being born on American soil,” I explained, watching him nod in understanding.</p><p>“Please tell me you took care of the No-Maj,” Tina said, making us focus once more.</p><p>“The what?” questioned Newt, eyebrows raised high as he looked at Tina then at me, reminding me a bit of a puppy.</p><p>“The No-Maj. No-Magic. The non-wizard!”</p><p>Newt released a sigh of relief, now seeming to understand what she was going on about. “Oh. Sorry, we call them Muggles.”</p><p>I snorted, making Tina glower at me, while the freckled man looked confused. “Sorry, it’s just… It’s just, here in the States, Muggle is a term for marijuana, which is a type of drug.”</p><p>“You wiped his memory, <em> right </em>?” Tina stressed, glaring at me seeing as I should know better. I merely shrugged. “The No-Maj with the case?” she clarified for Mr. Scamander.</p><p>“Um…” was all he could utter after a bit of silence.</p><p>Tina groaned. “Oh…” she sighed, looking tired all of a sudden. “That’s a Section 3-A, Mr. Scamander. I’m taking you in.” She looped her arm through one of his, while grabbing the hood of my coat. “And <em> you </em>, Lisa, are getting written up!” I can already feel myself drowning in stupid paperwork.</p>
