    <p>
  <span>”Fuck fuck fuck, Sirius, fuck,” Remus whispered at the sight of Sirius’ blood oozing from several wounds in his body. Before the apparition there had only been one big cut in his side but it had become so much worse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had been out fighting death eaters for the order just the two of them. Fresh out of Hogwarts the marauders joined the order of the phoenix to help Dumbledore in the Wizarding War. This particular mission Remus and Sirius were sent to the outskirts of Hogsmeade where some residents had claimed that they’d seen death eaters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Naturally the two were sent together as they always were. Everyone knew that they fought best side by side and that they had never come back from a mission with any huge injuries. Since it was a war they were fighting in that was a rarity and thus almost seen as a miracle. In truth it was only because the two cared so much for each other that they would not, under any circumstances, let anything happen to the other. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus had </span>
  <span>apparated them to the temporary headquarters of the order as soon as he saw that Sirius had been hurt and Sirius was forever grateful for that. If Remus hadn’t thought as quickly, both of them would most likely already have been dead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A whimper escaped Sirius mouth from the excruciating pain he was in and Remus hastily put his wand to Sirius side where the blood was oozing out, to try to stop it. As Remus grew more and more frustrated Sirius realized that they most likely needed to get professional help but seeing as the blood flowed out of him with no sign of stopping help wouldn’t come in time. He looked up at Remus as he called for help and their eyes met when Remus was sure someone was on their way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not that bad Moony,” Sirius lied, “you’ve been through worse haven’t you?” Remus shook his head and ripped a part of his shirt to put pressure on the worst of the gaping wounds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not a werewolf Padfoot,” The use of his nickname instead of his real name in a situation like this said almost too much and Sirius had to close his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Moony what are you saying? Are you suggesting that only werewolves can take a punch?” Sirius knew the harm on his body was deadly and he knew Remus could do nothing to help. He also knew Remus well enough that hearing his attempt to make it seem like less big of a deal made it so much worse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew he would most likely be dead in a couple of minutes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Remus-“ but he got interrupted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t,” his voice was full of emotion. “Please don’t. I’m not going to lose you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius opened his eyes and mustered up what energy he had left to move one of his arms enough to grasp Remus’ bicep. The action made him clench his teeth and almost scrunch his eyes closed again, but if this was his last moment he was going to make them count. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Moony, if I don’t pull through this-“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But if I don’t- Hear me out Remus!” Wanting to say these potentially last words he tightened his grip on Remus’ bicep as much as he could, though it was not enough to make Remus react in any way then to become silent. “If I don’t you have to tell them, Prongs, Wormtail, Lils,” With each word he seemed to become more drained of energy. “Tell them that they have to keep fighting for as long as it takes, if not for themselves but for the little creature inside of Lily. Make sure the world becomes a better place for the child.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Heavy tears from Remus’ eyes fell down upon Sirius bloody chest. He never stopped trying to seize the bleeding in his side even though he knew it was useless. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Moony, my Moons,” a chuckle, wet from tears and drained from energy, left Sirius’ lips. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>My</span>
  </em>
  <span> Moony, you must keep fighting. Keep fighting even if it seems futile, even if I’m not by your side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took a ragged breath as he realized that he was seconds from passing out. The energy had faded so much that his semi-firm grip on Remus’ arms had become so loose that the only reason his hand still held the contact was because of his sweaty palm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You Remus, you are the one, the one that I-“ He was cut of by his own struggled breathing and he had to fight the unconsciousness to be able to utter the last words, “the one that I love more than anything.”</span>
