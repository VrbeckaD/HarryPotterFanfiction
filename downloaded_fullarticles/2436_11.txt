"As in the Romilda Vane who sent you love potion spiked chocolates that Ron accidently ate?"</p><p>Harry chuckled. "The very same, but there's more to her than that."</p><p>Alicia beamed, "If you think I'll like her, I'll give it a shot."</p><p>Harry muttered, "Good luck."</p><p>Alicia approached the Ravenclaw table confidently and approached Romilda.</p><p>Romilda glanced up as she was about to speak and smiled. "Alicia Spinnet, right?"</p><p>Alicia nodded and asked, "May I sit here?"</p><p>Romilda gestured to the seat across from her and whispered, "I didn't know different houses were allowed to sit together."</p><p>Alicia sat down and grinned. "I don't think we're allowed, but it can be our little secret."</p><p>Romilda raised an eyebrow and inquired, "Why did you decide to sit here, next to me; I mean?"</p><p>Alicia vaguely stated, "A friend thought we would get along."</p><p>Romilda replied, "Well, I'm glad because I like you already."</p></div>
