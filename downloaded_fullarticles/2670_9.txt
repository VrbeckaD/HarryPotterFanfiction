    <p>There was nothing more annoying than having someone you deeply respect insinuate that you’re useless, Sirius thought bitterly as he nodded vaguely to the tail end of Dumbledore’s explanation of why he wasn’t allowed to leave the house. Across the table, Snape was smirking nastily at him like the vindictive little shit that he was. Sirius glared back.</p><p>“You were saying something about Voldemort’s plans, Albus?” Remus prompted. Sirius slumped in relief as Albus conceded to the change of subject, and he propped his chin on his arms, which were folded across the surface of the kitchen table.</p><p>“Yes.” Dumbledore murmured, and Sirius could feel his piercing gaze boring into the top of his head, but he refused to look up. “Voldemort is becoming more and more obsessed with hearing the prophecy and learning the truth of his connection to Harry-”</p><p>“Nothing is true.” Sirius muttered petulantly, not really intending to be heard. It was just meant to be his own, private rebellion against Dumbledore’s orders. A reminder that there was another cause that had Sirius’s loyalty, that he wasn’t just Dumbledore’s pet.</p><p>But he was heard. Remus, beside him, reached over and gripped his shoulder in a comforting squeeze, but that wasn’t what peaked Sirius’s interest. No, what he focused on was the way Snape startled, just a tiny little jolt, and turned his head to stare, his gaze sharp and shocked, at Sirius. Sirius raised his head a little, frowning in confusion. Movement caught his eye, and he looked down at Snape’s hands where they rested on the table. Where the ring finger of his left hand was curled and hidden.</p><p>Sirius jolted upright and <em>stared</em> at Snape. He saw, for a brief moment, his own feelings of dawning realisation and disbelief on Snape’s face, before it went completely blank, and he turned his attention back to Dumbledore, who- shit, had stopped talking. “Something wrong, Sirius?”</p><p>“…No, nothing.” Sirius replied, because as much as he respected Albus, there was no way he was telling the old man anything about the Brotherhood. Not only because he wouldn’t understand, but because he also wouldn’t actually trust the man with that knowledge. Despite Dumbledore’s many, many strengths and virtues, there was no denying he was master at manipulation.</p><p>But <em>Snape</em> knew. Snape <em>knew</em> about the Brotherhood. Snape was a <em>member</em> of the Brotherhood of Assassins.</p><p>Sirius stared at the surface of the table, not even hearing Albus anymore. He couldn’t even begin to comprehend what he’d just discovered. Oftentimes, when he spoke to people, he wondered if they were the sort of people to be interested in joining the Brotherhood. It was rare he found someone who might be, because it took a unique combination of dark and light in someone’s soul for them to truly believe in what the Brotherhood stood for, but he had never, not once, thought of <em>Snape</em> as among those few.</p><p>Snape. An assassin. <em>Snape</em>.</p><p>Sirius shook his head. Despite it’s ominous name, the Brotherhood believed wholeheartedly in the freedom of choice and the autonomy of man. How could Snape believe in that, when he had offered himself up in the service of the Dark Lord? When he blindly followed the orders of a man that – if the Brotherhood had more members in the wizarding world – would be number one on the list of people to assassinate.</p><p>And yet, Sirius realised, lifting his eyes to study Snape’s face, he was here. He was sat in the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, offering up information on Voldemort to one of the few men Sirius believed capable of ending that monster once and for all.</p><p><em>Dumbledore trusts him</em>, he remembered, and for the first time since he’d learned of Snape’s supposed change of allegiance, he actually stopped to think about that. Dumbledore trusted him. Why? Did Dumbledore have a reason, beyond his belief in second chances? Was there something Dumbledore had seen that Sirius had missed? Maybe… maybe it made a little more sense than Sirius liked to admit, Snape being an assassin.</p><p>He certainly had the practicality and ruthlessness to kill without remorse those men that infringed on the freedom of others. There was no doubt of the necessary <em>darkness</em> in Snape’s soul, but what about the light? Was he really the sort of person to only kill in the defence of the people? Could he follow that very first rule of the Brotherhood; to stay one’s blade from the flesh of an innocent?</p><p>Sirius realised, with a sense of bitter shame, that he didn’t know. And really, he should trust to the judgement of his mentor, the Head of the Brotherhood. If <em>he</em> believed that Snape was worthy of the Brotherhood, then Sirius wouldn’t question him. It didn’t mean he had to like the bastard, though. Trust him? Perhaps he could do that, given time to wrap his brain around the idea, but stop actively loathing him? Not likely.</p><p>A modicum of calm returned to Sirius as he finally accepted the fact that, yes, Snape was an assassin, and by that fact, kind of Sirius’s brother. Sirius was well versed in hating one’s brother, though, so he could make peace with that.</p><p>Crisis of faith over, Sirius tuned back into the meeting, just in time to hear Dumbledore give his last orders, and declare the meeting over. There was a thunderous scraping of chairs as everyone got to their feet and began filing out of the kitchen. Even those planning to stay for dinner shuffled along to say farewell, except Remus, who lingered beside Sirius with a small frown on his face. “Are you alright?”</p><p>“Yeah…” Sirius muttered. “I just… <em>Snape</em>.” He said emphatically, but quietly.</p><p>“I noticed he reacted to what you said.” Remus agreed. “Do you think he-?”</p><p>“Mmhm.” Sirius nodded.</p><p>“…I’m not surprised.” Remus admitted with a wry smile.</p><p>Sirius turned to stare at him. “You’re <em>not</em>?” He asked. Remus smiled and shook his head. “<em>I am</em>.” Sirius announced, then groaned and shook his head. Remus laughed at him, patted him on the shoulder, then followed the crowd of Order members out of the kitchen and up the stairs. Sirius wandered after him, still reeling a little.</p><p>In the hall, Molly was stood by the door saying goodbye to everyone as they trickled out, and Ron and Harry were peering over the banisters on the first landing. “Lovely to see you, Albus.” Molly was gushing, so Sirius turned to Snape, who was fastening his cloak, but looked up when he noticed Sirius’s attention on him. His eyes narrowed, but Sirius didn’t think he was imagining that he looked less hostile than usual.</p><p>Sirius thought for a moment about what to say, but in the end, he just set his jaw and thrust out his hand. Snape’s face remained mostly blank, but for just a moment, Sirius thought he saw shock flicker through his eyes. Then, cautiously, Severus took his hand and shook it. It was brief, and both of them gripped too tight and let go too quickly, but it happened.</p><p>Then Snape turned to go, and Sirius realised Dumbledore was staring at them with a frown on his face. Sirius frowned right back, still very unhappy with his old headmaster. There was a moment of tension, which broke as Dumbledore sighed wearily, smiling sadly, and turned away, to step out of the house and disapparate.</p><p>Meanwhile, Molly was beaming wider than usual at Snape. “Are you sure you won’t stay for dinner, Severus? I always make far too much, you know.” Molly enthused. Snape gave her a look that was both dryly amused and very, very weary. Like the idea of him staying any longer than absolutely necessary was utterly laughable.</p><p>Sirius felt something like guilt squirm in his gut, followed swiftly by irritated resignation. He wanted to groan. “You should stay for dinner.” He gritted out instead, reluctant to actually say it, but even more unwilling to let the moment pass.</p><p>Everyone turned to stare at him in shock. There was a muffled yelp from the first floor landing. “What?” Snape asked, shocked and a little repulsed. That made Sirius feel better.</p><p>“Stay for dinner.” It was actually easier to get out the second time.</p><p>Snape stared at him, eyes blazing with some kind of inner conflict that Sirius didn’t want to analyse at all. “Why?” Snape asked eventually. Sirius managed not to roll his eyes at that, but it was hard, and clearly his exasperation showed on his face, because the next moment Snape was glaring at him.</p><p>“Because as much as I hate you – and I really, really do – we’re allies, and you shouldn’t be unwelcome here.” Sirius gritted out. If Snape didn’t get the hidden meaning, that this house was a Sanctuary, a place for any and every assassin to hide and recover if they needed it, then Sirius would forever mock him for his stupidity.</p><p>But of course, Snape did get it, and understanding washed over his features. As Sirius mourned the loss of the potential mocking, Snape spoke. “The feeling is mutual, Black.” He sneered, but then he turned to Molly. “It seems like I will be staying for dinner, after all, Molly.” He acquiesced stiffly.</p><p>“<em>What?!</em>”</p><p>All the adults in the hall turned their heads upwards, staring up at where the twins, Hermione and Ginny had joined Harry and Ron on the landing. “Ronald Weasley! Don’t be rude!” Molly hissed crossly.</p><p>The kids all shared horrified looks, and Sirius sympathised with them. “But it’s <em>Snape</em>.” The twins protested in unison.</p><p>“Fred! George!” Molly snapped, horrified and furious. “I raised you better than this!”</p><p>“Sirius, help!” George begged.</p><p>“Kick him out!” Fred pleaded</p><p>Molly swelled with indignation. Sirius winced against the impending explosion, and Molly didn’t disappoint “Sirius was the one who invited Severus to stay for dinner, and if the <em>rest</em> of you can’t behave like mature adults at dinner, you won’t be getting any at all!” She snapped, enraged.</p><p>Which was when the portrait of Sirius’s dear old mum decided to make an entrance, over the startled, desperate cries from upstairs. The curtains flew open, and she took to her usual screeching about half-bloods and filth. Sirius closed his eyes, feeling like something very heavy had just settled on his shoulders. He didn’t even have the energy to be angry any more. Without a word, he turned to the portrait and helped Remus haul the stubborn curtains shut.</p><p>Remus shot him a look of concern once Walburga was safe and silent behind her curtains again, but Sirius just shook his head, unwilling to even begin indulging that particular strand of emotion and angst. He returned to the kitchen to finish cleaning up the odds and ends still scattered about after the meeting, and was followed by Molly.</p><p>“Sirius?” She asked, while taking down a couple of pots and pans and lighting up the stove. Sirius grunted an acknowledgement. “I just wanted to say I think it was a good thing you did, earlier.” Molly told him, though she spoke to the stove, and Sirius appreciated her tact in not forcing eye-contact for a conversation like this.</p><p>“He’s still a sneaky, slimy, Slytherin snake.” Sirius grumbled.</p><p>Molly hummed, not entirely approvingly. “Still.” She said firmly, and Sirius relented a little.</p><p>“…Yeah, I- I can’t exactly say I trust him, because I don’t. But… but I’m willing to <em>try</em>, because I trust- Dumbledore’s judgement.” Sirius explained, even though his tone darkened on Dumbledore’s name. It wasn’t Dumbledore’s judgement he was trusting, but he couldn’t tell Molly that.</p><p>Molly beamed. “I’m glad.” She told him sincerely, and Sirius managed a rueful sort of grimace in return. He was surprised to find that Molly seemed to accept this as a ceasefire on their ongoing spat over Harry, and she chattered amiably at him while she cooked. Sirius didn’t reply beyond the occasional grunt or monosyllabic question, but that didn’t seem to bother her too much. Soon enough Molly sent him off to fetch everyone for dinner. Remus, Tonks and Arthur were in the drawing room, and Sirius got two odd looks along with the confirmation that they’d be right down.</p><p>The next room he stuck his head into was the library, because there was light spilling out from under the door, and he found Snape with his nose buried in a huge, dusty leather tome. “Molly says dinner’s ready.” Sirius told him bluntly.</p><p>“I’ll be along in a moment.” Snape acknowledged, closing the book and moving to carefully place it back on the shelf. Sirius turned to go. “Black.”</p><p>“What?” Sirius snapped.</p><p>He turned and met black eyes glittering with wrath with a steely glare of his own. Snape took a deep breath and closed his eyes briefly, obviously fighting for composure. “Earlier, you implied this place was a Sanctuary for the Brotherhood.” He stated.</p><p>“Yeah…?” Sirius prompted.</p><p>“How can it be, when Albus is the secret keeper?” Snape asked.</p><p>Now, Sirius was beginning to understand where Snape was going with this. “I didn’t tell him about the Brotherhood, if that’s what you’re asking.” Sirius told him, and for just a moment, Snape looked surprised. Sirius wasn’t sure whether to feel proud, or insulted. He settled on both. “I’m not stupid, you know. Telling Dumbledore about the Brotherhood would be like putting absinthe in front of an alcoholic.”</p><p>Along with surprised, Snape was also looking grudgingly impressed. “Then how?” He repeated.</p><p>“Dumbledore isn’t the only secret keeper.” Sirius told him.</p><p>“Ah, I see.” Snape nodded, as though satisfied, and swept past Sirius and out of the library without another word.</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Sirius pulled a face at Snape’s back, then took the next flight of stairs two at a time, which brought him to the landing with Harry and Ron’s room, as well as Ginny and Hermione’s. Sirius knocked on the boys’ door first, and was glad he did, because it turned out the six of them – twins included – had gathered there.</p><p>The moment he opened the door, Harry’s eyes found his with a pleading, betrayed expression. “Sirius, why would you invite <em>Snape</em> to stay for dinner?!” He asked.</p><p>Sirius let out a heavy sigh, and stepped more fully into the room. “Because, Harry, while <em>I</em> don’t trust him, I do trust the judgement of those older and wiser than myself.” He said, being deliberately vague. He had made a promise to himself when Harry was born, that he would never tell the child a lie. He had reaffirmed it with much more dedication when he realised just how much Dumbledore planned to keep him in the dark. But he couldn’t speak plainly in front of a bunch of teenagers who may or may not know how to be discreet.</p><p>“You <em>can’t</em> mean <em>Dumbledore</em>.” Harry spat out, suddenly angry instead of hurt.</p><p>“No, I don’t.” Sirius replied simply, drawing Harry up short.</p><p>“Then who…?” Ron asked, looking completely baffled.</p><p>Sirius barked out a laugh. “Good to know I have some secrets left.” He said cheerfully. “Anyway, dinners ready, so get a move on.” He added, waving them all towards the door. Ginny was the first to go, followed by the twins, and then by Ron and Hermione, who only left after Harry had gestured for them to go.</p><p>“Sirius…” Harry said slowly. “What’s going on?”</p><p>“There’s more than one organisation that opposes dictators and tyrants, Harry.” Sirius told him. “Snape and I are both members of another one, and I trust that leader’s judgement much, much more than I trust Dumbledore’s.”</p><p>“Enough to trust <em>Snape</em>?” Harry questioned.</p><p>“Enough to give him the benefit of the doubt.” Sirius agreed, pulling a face.</p><p>Harry looked thoughtful, though still slightly annoyed. His eyebrows were furrowed like he was trying to work out what Sirius’s angle was in all of this. “I don’t get it.” He said finally, shrugging helplessly.</p><p>Sirius gave Harry a conspiratorial grimace. “Neither do I, Harry.” He admitted, and when Harry laughed, he smiled back.</p>
