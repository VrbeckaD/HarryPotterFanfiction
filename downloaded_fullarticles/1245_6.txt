  <strong>*CRACK!*</strong>
</p>
<p>The Gryffindor common room went dead silent at the sound and all heads turned to the source.</p>
<p>"Ronald Weasley," Hermione spat the name out as she rubbed her sore palm, the boy in question wearing a red-and from the looks of it, beginning to bruise-handprint across his face, "You make me sick! You know DAMN well that Harriet wouldn't put herself into a situation like this for something as stupid as bloody fame and a few galleons!" Her eyes narrowed when she spotted his ears turning red.</p>
<p>"You're taking HER side!?" He managed to get out before whimpering in pain and grabbing his throbbing cheek </p>
<p>"Yes I am!" She snapped, pulling out her wand to hit him with a silencing charm when he started to say something else, "You lost any right to speak after calling her..what was it again? Oh yes, a 'glory-hungry slag' wasn't it?" The icy tone in her voice caused him to step back some. Unfortunately for him, she wasn't finished, "Three years, Ron. You've known her for three damn years, but that wasn't enough was it? The moment her name came out of that stupid cup you let your petty little jealousy take over once again." She shook her head, "It's pathetic. YOU'RE pathetic. And I have had enough; as far as I'm concerned, we're done. I want nothing more to do with you." Turning to the others in the room showed them they were next in line for her ire, "The rest of you are no better. It's the Chamber of Secrets all over again!" Hermione knew she shouldn't feel satisfaction at how many cringed slightly at being reminded of how they were quick to turn on Harriet Potter after learning she was a parselmouth. "I can count the number of people that are acting like REAL Gryffindors, and showing her some needed support on one bloody hand and STILL have fingers left over. Lions, my arse." She hissed, "Aside from Neville and the twins, you've proven once again you're all just jackals!"</p>
<p>"Um..Hermione, dear..." Fred spoke up, gulping when she turned his way, "Not that we're complaining-"</p>
<p>"Rather impressed, really." George continued. "Ronnie's face is swelling up already.."</p>
<p>"But, you know our mum isn't going to be happy when he writes her, which we all know he most likely will..." Fred ignored the intimidating look Ron tried to give him</p>
<p>"Especially since you know he'll probably put his own spin on things."</p>
<p>"Let him! I don't give a fig about what he does!" She snapped before turning on her heel, "Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a friend to find and assure her she's got SOMEBODY in her corner." </p>
<p>"Um, she said something about going to the 'usual spot' if you asked where she was." Neville offered, getting a nod of appreciation as she left. </p>
<p>As soon as she was gone, George looked at Fred, "Should we bother taking him to Madam Pomfrey?"</p>
<p>"May as well. Someone has to explain the stupid thing he did to earn it."</p>
<p>Ron tried to growl, but winced instead.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>"The nerve of that little...!"</em> Hermione growled to herself as she marched out onto the castle grounds to find Harriet. She wasn't sure which angered her more; the fact he did turn on them, or how quickly it happened. Either way, she promised herself their any friendship she had with him was no more.</p>
<p>For now, though, she had something more important to focus on. Without another word she made her way to the 'usual spot', an outcropping of rocks near the lake's edge that formed a natural alcove. It was large enough to accommodate a couple of people, or Hagrid if he squatted down enough. She and Harriet tended to use it when they wanted to talk in private or simply get away from the normally crowded commonroom.</p>
<p>As she got closer to it this time, however, she noticed, or rather heard, something out of the ordinary. A somewhat heavy breathing coming from it, interspaced with what she could have sworn was....quiet moans. </p>
<p>Normally, she or Harriet would've called out to let the other know they were there. But concern for her friend combined with a strange curiosity caused her to just look in, "Harri....?" She started to say</p>
<p>Only to have her voice halt in her throat and eyes widened at the sight at greeted her.</p>
<p>Sitting on one of the rocks inside was one Harriet Jennifer Potter, which wasn't odd; except for the fact she was breathing heavily with her eyes closed. Her shirt was open, revealing a pair of large B-cup bordering on C breasts, with her clutching one and teasing the dusty pink nipple between her fingers. Her skirt was pooled around one foot of her spread legs, showing where the other hand was:</p>
<p>Now, a small bit of Hermione's mind told her she should look away, to forget what she saw. Unfortunately, the nine inch erection jutting out from between her legs, that Harriet was slowly pumping put paid to that notion.</p>
<p>Also the quiet moan of 'Hermione' that escaped Harriet's lips quickly caught her attention.</p>
<p>"H-Harriet...??" Hermione squeaked, causing the other girl to suddenly look up, brown eyes meeting green.</p>
