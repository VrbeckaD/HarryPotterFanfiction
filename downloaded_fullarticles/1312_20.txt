"I can't believe that you bought all of those fireworks just to have a better wedding than Draco."</p><p>Pansy said, "Forget about Draco, I did it to make our special day even more spectacular."</p><p>Blaise raised an eyebrow and asked, "Then why did you shout at Draco about our wedding being better than his, Pans?"</p><p>Pansy sighed. "So, maybe I did want to be better than Malfoy; but that's in the past now. Just forget about him."</p><p>Blaise smiled. "I can definitely do that."</p><p>Pansy grinned. "Good, now shall we have a lovely date as a married couple?"</p><p>Blaise beamed, "Sure."</p></div>
