    <p>Dear Harry,</p><p>I wonder if you know what has happened, how much did the Order tell you? Maybe at this stage, you don't know everything, I think that may be for the best. Perhaps you find it amusing the only items I managed to keep with me is a scroll and quill. Even at times like this, I manage to keep a book as well, I wish though, I had more.</p><p>The sad thing is, I don't think you will receive this letter. I fear it will vanish to be forgotten, never found again. I try not to let my mind dwell on this, I keep telling myself I will be back at Hogwarts in time for the new term. A part of me wonders why they allow me this luxury, why I'm allowed to write, maybe they know I'm not coming back.</p><p>For years you know I always wondered why I was sorted into Gryffindor. You always managed to reassure me, always found a reason why, but now. The truth is. I'm scared, I am so, very scared. I don't know where we're going, where we are or what is happening. I'm not allowed my wand, I'm only allowed food and water.</p><p>Please don't worry the others, don't worry Ron or Ginny, I will be home soon, I'm sure. I'll think of a way. I love you, you're the brother I wish I had, I'm coming home soon. I promise, just keep going defeat you know who. End this.</p><p>With all my love,</p><p>Hermione.</p><p>Through the haze of smoke, she watches silently as the fire crackles, spitting into the dark night of the forest. The pressure inside her chest has become unbearable, the urge to cry is over powering. Still, she remains emotionless, a coldness creeping in despite the charm to keep them warm.</p><p>The smoke spirals upwards, the smell clinging to her jacket, a jacket that is not her own. She is under no illusion the person who once owned the jacket is dead, she wonders if it's an omen. A promise of her future to come, wearing a dead man's jacket. She hates Trelawney with a passion, but even she can admit there is a chill in the air. An omen lingering on her shoulders</p><p>As a child, she loved bonfires, bbqs but hated the smell of smoke, always first to shower, to throw her washing in the machine. Her mother watching fondly as she cleaned her own clothes, if she were a Griffindor through and through she would ask her mother. Why the sad smile? Why did she look with regret quickly hidden by amusement? Was it to do with the fire they had when she was younger? When she was barely old enough to stand, the fire that crippled her grandfather? Absently, she wonders if she will ever get the chance to ask?</p><p>A loud crack echoes throughout the deadly quiet forest, no birds or creatures to speak off. A niggling fear prickles the back of her neck the urge to turn and look almost unbearable. The feeling of eyes on her, she refuses to look, refuses to give in to the fear.</p><p>The dried blood on her chin has become uncomfortable, nothing in comparison to the ache from her split lip. The urge to wipe the blood has become the constant fight to ignore it for as long as possible. If she wipes the blood away, this will all become real the last several hours will become real. She will no longer be able to pretend it is all a bad nightmare. To pretend the monster sleeping a few feet away is just figment of her imagination. If she tries hard enough, she can believe anything, if she were a Gryffindor she wouldn't hide. But she always suspected the hat was wrong because all she can feel right now is agonising fear. Fear so crippling, she can barely breath. She wants nothing more than to hug her mother, cry and to wake from this nightmare. She is the brightest witch of her age though, Hermione Granger trapped in a forest with a creature that was once human and a forest full of monsters. Still, she feels the charm protecting them is not for their benefit, because the monster is sleeping peacefully only a few feet away, a small smile on their face despite the devastation left in their wake.</p><p>Several Hours earlier…</p><p>She was not the target, she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. A tour around the Ministry, distracted by Tonks and her whole life changed in a matter of seconds. They were searching through the woods, Tonks had lost something her Auror friends helping search. They are going to head to the nearby village for a drink afterwards. Tonks had promised to drop Hermione home, not allowing the witch to Apparate alone, despite having a license and being old enough.</p><p>Hermione didn't argue it's boring at home, she has read every book expected for their next term, waiting for the day she could go to the burrow. Waiting to see the boys, wondering if Harry was okay and the Dursleys were looking after him. Wondering how he is feeling after Sirius death, hoping he is coping.</p><p>There was no warning, the sky ripped apart, a terrifying light blinding her momentarily. She stumbles into a tree, finding cover, just in time. Opening her eyes to the shouting, the chaos of fighting, Death Eaters. Spells dance through the air with frightening speed, clashing and crashing together. Angels and Demons, she thinks them, fighting for the right to rule. Nothing like that night at the Ministry, these are trained warriors, not desperate escapees.</p><p>She pulls her wand shakily from it's hiding place, stepping from cover, ready to face the masked demons, ready to help. When a hand grabs her arm, a red faced Tonks, cut lacings her eye brow. Hermione has never seen the witch so… full of life. Adrenalized by the fight, Tonks is talking but, Hermione's ears are ringing.</p><p>Seconds later they're moving, Tonks's hand pulling Hermione along, but not towards the fight. Leading her away, from the hill and the showering of spells. Towards the safety in the distance, Tonks never releasing her hold, never stopping but still talking.</p><p>"We can't!" Hermione forces her voice to work, her mind slowly catching up. "We cannot leave them!"</p><p>"My job is to keep you safe. Now move, they cannot find you here, your too valuable."</p><p>More valuable than any Auror? She fails to believe it, no one is more important than another. She wouldn't just leave Tonks people, she couldn't let Tonks leave her colleagues. If she must Hermione will find her own way home. If she is not allowed to fight the least she can do is release Tonks from her burden. To allow the Auror to return to the battle.</p><p>The hot summers night breaks apart with the crash of thunder, the rain breaking from the clouds, drenching them all instantly. Her clothes dragging her down, the mud sucking at their feet, their retreat hindered by the storm.</p><p>Yanking her arm free, Hermione prepares her speech, as Tonks whirls on her. Annoyed, Tonks runs a hand through her hair, pushing it from her face, lines of worry etched near her eyes.</p><p>"Mione'." Tonks groans.</p><p>"We can't leave, Tonks, they're your people. Let me go, you can help…"</p><p>"Shush."</p><p>"Tonks." Hermione protests, as Tonks views their surroundings.</p><p>"NO! Shush, get behind a tree, now."</p><p>Not questioning, Hermione slinks behind a tree, as Tonks casts a spell, she nods her head in reassurance. Inching closer to the open she eyes the tree line. Clutching the bark of the tree, Hermione watches, wondering what Tonks has heard. Turning, back to Hermione, Tonks shrugs her spells not detecting anyone nearby.</p><p>Neither of them anticipates the next few minutes that change everything. Tonks wand lifting in slow motion, Hermione watching with her breath stuck in her throat, unable to break the spell they seem to be stuck in. The curse strikes Tonks straight on the chest sending the witch hurtling backwards. Hermione's mind flashes back to the shock on Sirius's face moments before he fell through the veil.</p><p>The breath breaks from her mouth as Tonks hits the muddy ground, rain pelting her limp form. Breathless, Hermione stares at Tonks praying that the witch is still alive. Turning she searches for the attacker, her heart jamming to a stop at the sight as a Death Eater emerges from the shadows.</p><p>A cruel laugh echoes loudly as though a force of nature on it's own. It rebounds in Hemione's mind resonating, freezing her blood and turning her urge to fight in to a motion to flee. It's a sound she wished to never hear again, the black insane curls untouched by the rain emerges first. Immaculate dress and corset untouched by the dirt around them swallows the remaining light. A sadistic smile grazing cruel lips, dark untouchable eyes focussing on the Tonks on the ground.</p><p>"What do we have here?" They taunt. "My dear niece just what I wanted to find."</p><p>Terror strikes Hermione still, pressing her back against the tree, hiding her from view. Her hands shake as Sirius's death replays on repeat in her mind. Peeking, Hermione watches a boot nudge Tonks's arm. A sadistic smile lacing pale lips.</p><p>Do something, I have to do something. She wants to, wants to run to Tonks's rescue, but she cannot take the Death Eater in a duel. A plan forms, she has no one to tell it to, no boys to tell her it's crazy, but it's the best plan she has. A distraction so she can save Tonks and run.</p><p>With a complicated flourish of her wand, she whispers the spell, pointing straight at the Death Eater. Smiling, Hermione watches the ground kick dirt, as the spell hurtles along with the force of a tornado. It gathers, momentum as it clashes with the barrier protecting the witch who stumbles back. Mud and rain pelting the shield, blinding the witch from Hermione.</p><p>Darting from cover, Hermione runs past the tornado attacking the Death Eater. Clutching, Tonks's face Hermione presses her wand next to the Auror's temple.</p><p>"Rennervate."</p><p>Jolting, Tonks snaps awake. staring at Hermione groggily. Eyes falling to the Death Eater currently under attack from a freak storm.</p><p>"We need to go now." Hermione orders. "It won't last long."</p><p>Nodding, Tonks crawls to her feet, wobbly, Hermione helps the witch along. Glancing behind to find the Death Eater glaring at them. Urging Tonks along, Hermione tries to ignore the fear itching beneath her skin. Ignores the scream of anger, as the air explodes with magic, mud drenching their backs. Tonks casting a protection charm they head for the safety of the forest, past the appariation barrier.</p><p>It's the sharp lacing pain in her shoulder, that warns her that her plan has failed, as a hand pulls her away from Tonks. Her face hits the muddy ground, hears the gasp of pain from Tonks. Pushing from the ground, Hermione jumps to her feet, wiping the dirt from her face.</p><p>"Ah dear Aunt," Tonks greets prepared for a duel. "What do I owe the honour?"</p><p>A short cackle, as Bellatrix stalks both of them, the Death Eater outnumbered, yet Hermione feels they are at a disadvantage. They are the ones at risk, not Bellatrix Lestrange who appears to be enjoying the whole situation.</p><p>"I came for you, thought we could spend some quality time together." Bellatrix grins, gaze disregarding Tonks and turning to Hermione. "However, your friend appears more interesting."</p><p>Almost as though a bolt strikes her, Tonks turns worried eyes to Hermione, renewed with a sense of protectiveness. Stepping in front of Hermione, Tonks stares her aunt down who seems merely amused by the whole situation. The curved wand rolling between long fingers, boots squish in the mud as Bellatrix circles.</p><p>"If you see an opportunity, head for safety don't argue." Tonks hisses, eyes solely focussed on Bellatrix.</p><p>"Nymph."</p><p>"We can't win this, we can only run. I'll be right behind you."</p><p>Doubt festers, Hermione not believing the witch, knows that Tonks is willing to sacrifice herself. They wouldn't even be here If Hermione hadn't asked to see the witch. She clutches her own wand, she cannot allow Tonks to sacrifice herself. Cannot allow this demon to win, not after she killed Sirius, killed Hermione's friend.</p><p>Bellatrix's lips twitch, a spell unleashed, weak it hits Tonks's defence fizzling away to nothing. Another follows and Hermione realises Bellatrix is testing Tonks defence, looking for a weakness. Realising this too, Tonks attacks, she lashes out her stunning spell reflected with a casual swish of the hand.</p><p>"You were at the Ministry, weren't you?" Bellatrix voice breaks the tension eyes focused solely on Hermione. "Potter's mudblood."</p><p>Flinching at the slur, Hermione almost recoils at the amount of disgust that rolls of Bellatrix, but the word said with casual indifference. It's a conundrum, she almost misses Draco, at least he showed emotion, to Bellatrix the statement feels more of a fact. A casual reminder of her blood status, that she is the lowest of the low.</p><p>A flash of yellow breaks through the air, cutting the droplets of rain into nothingness, it strikes Tonks shield. Shoes sinking into the mud from the force, a manic grin inches across Bellatrix's face. Sweating, Tonks holds the attack hand shaking under the force of the spell.</p><p>"Stupefy!" Hermione shouts, her spell narrowly missing Bellatrix who steps aside.</p><p>"Hermione!" Tonks snaps.</p><p>She knows, she is meant to be running, but not now. Dodging the hex, Hermione steps aside, the spell hitting a tree. Tonks attacks, engaging Bellatrix, who easily deflects. Joining in, Hermione tries to keep up with the two witches, the spells clashing in the night. The sky dancing with horrifying colours, red blending with purple. White ghosting across the ground, Bellatrix moves with the skill of duellist.</p><p>Sweat dripping down her spine, Hermione feels her stamina failing her. A strong hex forces her backwards, her defence nothing against Bellatrix casual attacks.</p><p>"Did I hurt the widdle Muddy's feelings?" Bellatrix taunts her spell clipping the tree next to Tonks's head. "What's wrong dear niece, sad? How's dear Sirius… Oh yes, he's dead."</p><p>A yell leaves Tonks lips, her foot slipping in the mud, however, her spell never faulters. It leaves with such force even Hermione jumps aside as Bellatrix reflects. A nearby tree explodes bark hitting them all. It's this moment Hermione realises their mistake, watches the cruel smile manifest. Tonks panting, several feet away, Bellatrix has managed to divide them. To get between them, a look of disbelief crosses Tonks face as she catches Hermione eye over Bellatrix's shoulder.</p><p>"Run!" Tonks orders, releasing another spell.</p><p>Hermione doesn't wait to be told twice, she turns running for the distant tree line. Shivering at the intensity of the fight behind her, relief floods her as she spots the trees. As her feet touch the grass, she doesn't look back.</p><p>"Hermione!"</p><p>An arm wraps around her throat, choking, her feet slip on the wet grass. The forearm tightening, she sees stars. A hand snatching her wand, she grasps at the arm binding her to the cold body behind. Lifted from the ground, she finds herself turning against her will, back to the open. Flinches as a spell hurtles towards them, Bellatrix reflects it back catching Tonks on the side. The witch tumbling to her knees.</p><p>"Tonks!" Hermione gasps air failing her.</p><p>Her elbow moves back on it's own will striking the witch in the ribs. A small flinch is the only indication it makes contact. The Death Eater refuses to let go, a slight tighten on her throat warns her not to try again.</p><p>"Now what dear Niece?" Bellatrix taunts.</p><p>Hermione grows still as the curved wand presses to her neck. The arm loosening, she sucks in air, spluttering as her lungs struggle with the increase of oxygen. Frozen, Tonks stares unsure how to act, her decision is made for her. The sound of approaching voices, more Death Eaters heading their way.</p><p>"Go." Hermione croaks.</p><p>"Run, little one, run away." Bellatrix mocks.</p><p>"Hermione, I'll be back," Tonks promises.</p><p>Smiling, Hermione watches Tonks turn for safety, disappearing into the tree line leaving Hermione trapped in the demon's arms. Closing her eyes, she waits, waits for the others to join them, for the savagery to start. Can only imagine the torture she is to endure.</p><p>Hands drag her backwards, her feet tripping over themselves, as Bellatrix pulls her into the darkness of the trees. Hidden, wand still tight against her neck it pulls away. The tip lighting up, a spell released under silence. Confused, Hermione doesn't resist as the wand touches her flesh once more. Is she going to be a surprise for the Death Eaters? Is Bellatrix waiting on someone else?</p><p>Heart beating uncontrollably as the sound of others get louder, the masks glinting through the trees. She tries to ignore the shake and the panic attack setting in. She feels faint, cold and confused, she clutches the arm holding her in place.</p><p>"Breathe," Bellatrix hisses against her ear startling her. "Breathe girl, good. Now be a good mudblood, stay quiet and don't move."</p><p>Greyback crashes into the clearing making Hermione jump and the arm tighten around her neck. She watches as the Death Eaters emerge, chatting amongst themselves. A few remove their masks, laughing, Hermione refuses the urge to throw up at the sight of blood on their robes. They watch silently as the group banter between themselves.</p><p>Growing still, Bellatrix pulls her wand from Hermione's throat. This is it, she is going to be thrown in front of the others. A trophy of sorts, perhaps Bellatrix wishes to show off. Mud squelches next to them, inches from their hiding place, it's when Hermione realises Greyback is narrowing in on them. The wand points towards the Werewolf, the tip of the wand the only hint of a spell. Greybacks eyes glaze, blinking he turns back to the others, their hiding spot undiscovered.</p><p>It's the change of temperature that warns her of a new presence, the air almost splinters apart. A tug of darkness touches her own magical core, sharp nails dig into her neck. She winces, at the pain which turns numb as another enters the clearing. Voldemort.</p><p>She feels the air leave her lungs, shrinking slightly into the form behind as Voldemort emerges. Harry had not done the creature justice in the description, something unholy has happened to the wizard. Dark magic, it has mingled with his soul, it makes her wonder just what Voldemort has done to become this creature.</p><p>Please, please don't turn me over to him. Hermione pleads, pleads to any higher being listening. Black robes billow as the Death Eaters gather around Voldemort, summoned before the devil itself. She doesn't realise she's almost vibrating in fear until the arm relaxes on her throat.</p><p>"Hush," Bellatrix whispers against her ear.</p><p>She hates herself for relaxing slightly in Bellatrix's embrace. To relax in the embrace of a monster, the one responsible for Neville's parents, for Sirius's death. Still, she finds some comfort being next to the witch in the presence of Voldemort. Perhaps because next to Dumbledore, Bellatrix is the only other known being to survive a duel against Voldemort.</p><p>"Where is Bellatrix?" Voldemort demands, his voice stopping any talk.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Hermione waits for Bellatrix to throw her in front of the creature. Expects to be a gift of some sort, a leverage to get to Harry. Except, nothing happens. Bellatrix remains quiet merely watching as Voldemort grows impatient looking at his followers expectantly.</p><p>"Where is Lestrange?" Voldemort demands again.</p><p>"Rodolphus is torturing an Auror, my lord."</p><p>"Typical," Bellatrix mutters.</p><p>"Summon them."</p><p>The words send ice down Hermione's spine, watching as the tattoo on Bellatrix arm writhers. The Dark mark squirming, the witch becomes still behind her, fingers digging into Hermione, who holds in the gasp. It burns red, as the sound of apparitating distracts Hermione as the Lestrange brothers appear. Watches as confusion morphs on Voldemort's face realising that Bellatrix is not appearing. A murmur breaking from some Death Eaters, Hermione refuses to look at the witch behind. Does not want to imagine the pain coursing through the witch's arm.</p><p>"She fails to respond, my Lord," Dolohovan speaks.</p><p>"Where is she, Lestrange?" Voldemort demands from the brothers.</p><p>"We split up my Lord, she spotted the Tonks girl," Rodolphus replies, looking to his brother who shrugs.</p><p>"Maybe she's done a runner." Greyback spits.</p><p>Hermione flinches as curse strikes a wizard, watches the body crumple to the ground. The guttural screaming making Hermione squirm. The man withering on the ground, begging for mercy. Turning, Hermione looks away from the torture and away from Bellatrix who is watching with fascination. A tear escapes her, she focuses instead on the tree next to them. The little caterpillar slowly inching across the trunk.</p><p>"Avada Kedavra!"</p><p>Shivering, Hermione turns to the scene of the dead man laying on the ground, she realises it's an Auror. One of Tonks's friends, dead. It feels unnatural, the air torn apart by dark magic, she wipes her eyes. Feels the slight chuckle from Bellatrix. Feels her heart drop, a coldness setting in.</p><p>She feels faint, but it's not the scene in front of her, looking down she realises she is bleeding. Adrenaline fading, she is accurately aware of the throbbing pain in her side. The blood mixing with the rain, it runs freely down her side, soaking her hoody. Stumbling, she feels Bellatrix tighten her arms, the hiss of annoyance.</p><p>Head falling back, it lands on the shoulder behind, she feels sick. Barely acknowledges Bellatrix's annoyed glare, feels the witch look down. The long uncontrollable hair covering Hermione's face, as the Death Eater finds Hermione's wound.</p><p>"Faint now and you will regret it," Bellatrix warns, forcing Hermione to open her eyes.</p><p>Hermione almost yelps as a hand presses against her wound, constant pressure to help stop the flow of blood. Hermione feels it's a loosing battle, watching through hazy eyes as the Death Eaters discuss the fight.</p><p>The order to leave is passed, they vanish instantly, leaving only Voldemort, whose gaze turns to their location. Bellatrix grows still, neither witch breathing, neither wanting to attract the attention of the Wizard. Hermione is under no illusion, Bellatrix is the only thing stopping her from collapsing.</p><p>He apparates, both witches relaxing. Breathing, Hermione goes to push away from the witch, but the hands fail to loosen.</p><p>"Oh no, filth." The voice low with the promise of pain. "You're mine."</p><p>Present Day…</p><p>A sharp kick to the ribs wakes her, jolting she rolls over to find Bellatrix looking down at her. She must have fallen asleep reminiscing. She almost wishes it's a bad dream. Her eyes falling on her letter, no not a bad dream, unfortunately, it's all real.</p><p>Pushing herself up, she collects her small belongings, nearly a whole day Bellatrix has had her, still, she remains unwise as to what they are doing. First few hours she spent unconscious, Bellatrix neglecting to heal her side till the last minute. Now they remain in the middle of the forest, Bellatrix pouring over a map. The sun barely risen, Hermione grabs a plate of food left for her eating slowly, she watches the witch.</p><p>"What have I told you about staring Muddy."</p><p>Hermione barely acknowledges the insult, simply eats her food. Plotting a way to escape, she acts the subdued little witch. Satisfied as Bellatrix sulks at the lack of reply.</p><p>Waiting patiently, Hermione holds on to her small number of objects as Bellatrix gathers her items. Doesn't flinch as Bellatrix hand coils around her elbow.</p><p>"I almost miss your defiant little mouth." Bellatrix taunts.</p><p>The defiant mouth that earned her a backhand earlier that day, or the one that earned her a curse. A curse for pointing out Hermione's blood was the same as Bellatrix's. The death eater not so keen on the reminder was quick to remind Hermione of her place.</p><p>Sighing, Bellatrix apparates them away. They arrive feet first in the snow, a cold biting wind taking their breath away. Hermione rummages in her bag for the coat Bellatrix kindly reminded her belonged to another. Cursing, Bellatrix pulls the map from her pocket.</p><p>Studying their surroundings, Hermione notices nothing but emptiness, except for the mount behind Bellatrix. In the distance, she notices the small smoke in the air, people, civilization. However, Bellatrix is looking the other way towards another forest.</p><p>"Fucking hate maps," Bellatrix grumbles. "Filth hold this,"</p><p>Accepting the map on instinct, Bellatrix regards her with curiosity, as she stands immobile waiting for orders. Digging into her bag, Bellatrix retrieves a book.</p><p>"Hold the map out."</p><p>She does so, obeying without thinking, luring Bellatrix into a false sense of security. Looking in her bag, Bellatrix retrieves another item, before studying the map again, using her compass as a guide. Snapping the compass shut she pockets it, opening the bag she carefully places the book inside, distracted by the job at hand.</p><p>Acting on instinct, Hermione charges the witch her shoulder hitting Bellatrix in the stomach knocking the air from her. The Death Eater stumbles backwards, the snow giving way as she falls over the embankment. Crushing the map into her pocket, Hermione turning and runs for the town in the distance, ignoring the shrill scream of annoyance chasing after her. She has no wand, only the act of surprise. She will have to run for her life.</p>
