    <p>Introduction 1: Welcome! Everything is Fine!</p><p>     Hey! Narrator here! Yeah you, the person reading these weird symbols and mindlessly recognising them! Now, I’ve got a story to tell here. It’s got mighty Maori warriors, endless optimism, strong-willed and driven characters, friends and whanau and losing your way and-oh hey, you found it again! We’ve got a phoenix rising with their peers from their ashes and a lot  of the beautiful language known as Te Reo Maori. But first, just before we embark, I’ve got to state the rules. The rules… what were the rules? Oh right! The rules!</p><p>Introduction 2: The Rules</p><p>*Rule one: They aren’t really rules, they’re guidelines. (Typical with a capital ‘T’.)<br/>
*Rule two: To set a mood, I may put in a quick bracket saying mysterious titles. Well, it’s just me adding in some music that I really think sets the tone for the moment. (Like this, “video number one".) ← now, if you could generously pause your quest of reading the story, you’d flip over to Youtube, where you will find a playlist titled "Ruaumoko Tunes" and play the song that's number 1 on the list or number five or four or twenty (aye) and play the song. Try it now, I’ll give you a sec.<br/>
Okay hello again!<br/>
*Rule three: You can refer to me, the Narrator as “THE ALL POWERFUL GOD!” Or just Kisin/Cizin. Either either, not too picky on the spelling.<br/>
*Rule four: If you find yourself as obsessed with this story as I am to suppressing my emotions, (I am Cizin and I am okay) and it leads to you creating beautiful fanart, please dial the NSFW down a smidge. (I have no idea if this’ll be that  good,  but can’t a girl dream?)<br/>
*Rule five: If you don’t understand a pop-culture or just general reference in this story, (or you do but haven’t watched/read the thing) I suggest you either watch the entire franchise, read the whole series or research the entire mythology. Same goes for the music, listen to the whole album, especially if the artist is Gorillaz, Queen or Arctic Monkeys. (Would also appreciate if you looked into a band called 1814.)<br/>
*Rule six: If there’s a little asterisk next to a “funny looking” word, this word was in either Te Reo Maori or Fijian or Rarotongan or Spanish or… you get the idea, and you’ll find out how to pronounce it and what it means in the Index. (Just realised how weird the word “asterisk” is spelt.)<br/>
*Rule seven: The Narrator (me, or Kisin. You pick) may change patterns of speaking from time to time (from dodgy cheerful neighbor in horror movies, to something you’ll see in the future.) just to match or set a mood.<br/>
*Rule eight: Pay attention to R-wait-eight?! That’s way too many rules, how about some story telling, instead of more rules, cause that’s what you came for, isn’t it? Well, let’s start.</p><p>Chapter 1: Hotdogs</p><p>     (Video Number 2.)<br/>
“Look,”<br/>
“...just because I wanted to buy twenty hot dogs with ten minutes left until school starts, doesn’t mean this is all entirely my fault!” one of our story’s protagonists shouted, running alongside three of her friends.<br/>
“Oh, REALLY?! CAUSE I DISTINCTLY  REMEMBER YOU SAYING ‘don’t tell me how to live my life’ AS YOU SCOOPED YOUR HOT DOGS INTO A FREAKING PUSH CART!” another girl retorted.<br/>
“WHY’D YOU EVEN GET THAT MANY ANYWAY?!” she added.<br/>
“I wanted to GET SOME FOR EVERYBODY!” the protagonist yelled.<br/>
“I didn’t know you had the money for that.” the third friend said quietly.<br/>
“EXACTLY!”<br/>
“I KNOW THE OWNER!” after this comment, the fourth friend finally spoke.<br/>
“GUYS! WE ARE SO CLOSE TO SCHOOL, LET’S STOP FIGHTING AND JUST RUN!” she shouted.<br/>
Now, the two fighting over hot dogs; the one who bought them for her class? The one with the brown curly hair put into a ponytail with a small part left out to look like a side fringe, brown eyes and skin, and a nervous grin spread across her face with freckles strewn across her nose? Her name’s Victoria “Moata”* Rongo* Mahuta* Putiputi* Kakahu*. But we just call her Tori. Tends to thirst for fun, freedom and adventure. A Hufflepuff and frankly, a bit of a mess too.<br/>
The one chewing her ear off about said hotdogs, is May Dylan Kaspbrak. She’s the same age as Tori (fourteen) and has half shaved  dark brown hair , the remainder tied in a bun as well. Blue eyes, pale skin. Tends to have a short temper and a thirst to prove herself. A hot-headed and stubborn Slytherin.<br/>
Sandy blonde hair, glasses, greenish eyes and a rather quiet voice? That’s Iris. Iris Evans. The more mature of the four, and is also the youngest (thirteen). Tends to be almost painfully  socially awkward (stems from the social anxiety). Definitely depicted as a DND Ravenclaw, and she’s 100% proud to be. Also loves Ru Paul’s Drag Race, which she and Tori always talk about.<br/>
And the girl trying to split the fight up and just keep running? (well, not really “running”, it seemed to be more or less stumbling across the street in a speedy fashion) She’s the one with the rectangle tortoise shell glasses, turquoise eyes, dark curly hair and pale skin. But we call her Anneke* Rose Rowena Sophlin, the other Ravenclaw of the group and a tired mum friend 100%.<br/>
“We’re a lot closer than we were five seconds ago!” Tori laughed, pulling her cart of hotdogs.<br/>
“TORI I AM NOT IN THE MOOD FOR YOUR OPTIMISM!” May shouted. They all continued running, when they could see the back of their school, the field seemingly already making their shoes muddy.<br/>
“We’re so… close..!” Tori and Anneke said, reaching their hands out. The sploshing sounds of the mud against the group’s shoes splashed goop on them, mostly to Tori’s dismay.<br/>
“NOOO MY CONVERSES!” she cried. Tori, May, Iris and Anneke finally reached the concrete. Somehow, Tori had managed to save all the hotdogs from falling off her cart.<br/>
“Alright engage Situation F!” Iris said. Suddenly, the group split up over an obstacle course. Iris’ path lead her to a staircase. The railing was in the middle, and Iris mounted it and slid down, landing with a roly poly and running again, making sure to make no sound so she wouldn’t get told off.<br/>
Anneke’s path lead to her climbing some fences, and May followed because her class was right next to Anneke’s. May gave Anneke a boost with her hands, Anneke stepping onto them, while May jogged back, charged, and vaulted over it, running to their classes.<br/>
But Tori’s… hers was the furthest. It takes two minutes to  get to her classroom, and she didn’t have that kind of time.<br/>
“SIRI! TEXT DIVI PLEASE!” Tori yelled, vaulting over a fence.<br/>
“God, I just have to be late to the class with the most strict teacher in the school!” Tori muttered.<br/>
“What would you like me to message Divi?” Siri replied.<br/>
“‘DISTRACT MR. SMITHIAMS! THIRTY SECONDS TOPS!’” Tori yelled running around a corner and meeting a wall.<br/>
“Crap wrong turn.” Tori sighed.<br/>
“Sup Tori.” a boy said, poking his head out of the bottom floor window.<br/>
“Hey Jimmy.” Tori said nervously, looking up at the wall. About three stories up was her class. Jimmy looked at the clock in his class, then at Tori, then at the wall Tori was looking at.<br/>
“Climb the wall. No balls you won’t.” he said. Tori thought for a moment as she thought about what to do. She nodded slowly and pulled out her phone to text Divianee. Sliding her phone back into her pocket, she waited until a rope fell down.<br/>
“YOU’RE INSANE!” Jimmy said.<br/>
“You tell the teachers and I tell your mum about your vape.” Tori said simply, tugging on the rope. Jimmy closed the window, and then the class curtain.<br/>
“Snitches get stitches I guess.” he said with a shrug before he left.<br/>
“Good luck.” he mouthed before shutting the curtains. Tori nodded and looked up, holding the rope.<br/>
“It’s only on the third storey… I’ll be fine.” she said, climbing past a window.<br/>
Divianee, Tori’s friend who was texted to distract Mr. Smithiams, grabbed a girl with ginger hair as she walked out of their social studies classroom.<br/>
“H-hey! Divi, what’re you doin-” she started.<br/>
“Oh! O-oh hey Mr. Smithiams!” the girl said, bumping into a man who loomed over her and Divianee.<br/>
“Work your magic, Maria!” Divianee whispered.<br/>
“Did um…” the girl stuttered as her eyes darted around the hallway.<br/>
“What is it, Ms. Broad?” Mr. Smithiams grunted. Maria suddenly burst out,<br/>
“Fluoride is in the USA’s water system to control the minds of an American citizen. You think you are safe, but the government-who are lizards, b-t-w-are poisoning your mind into thinking that the Earth is flat. Why? Because they want to hide the truth from us. Not just America. Everyone.” Maria started.<br/>
“Keep it going.” Divianee whispered with a nudge to Maria’s side. Maria nodded.<br/>
“Because… B-because… Because essentially, the American Dream is just the rich capitalists sitting atop a mountain of poverty, and the US Government intends to keep it that way, leaving no escape for those at the bottom of the US Social Hierarchy. And that ‘dream’ has already spread like a toxic plague across the globe. Everyone, everywhere, is apart of the horror that is the American Dream, whether you’re there, in the US, or not. And the moon? Oh don’t even get me started-”<br/>
“Text from: Divi; ‘Maria’s got him, but he’s going to burst pretty soon, you have to hurry up!’’ Siri said.<br/>
“Get back into the classroom.” Mr. Smithiams said through clenched teeth. Divianee got a text from Tori saying she was a window-sill away, and with a nod, sent her and her friend back to the class, closing the door to buy a little bit more time.<br/>
Jumping up to the open window ledge and climbing through just as she heard the door creak open and see the shadow of a thick and big man, she landed on her desk with a small trip, which she quickly covered up. She made it.<br/>
“Morning.” Mr. Smithiams said, marching into the class. Every student straightened their backs and said in a monotonous voice,<br/>
“Good morning, Mr. Smithiams.” Tori discreetly pulled the rope inside and hid it.<br/>
“Thanks, guys.” she said, a nervous grin on her face. Her table mates, (Kaz, Divianee or ‘Divi’ and Maria) all gave her a look that said “Tori, please, as people who have to always see you, please get your act together.”<br/>
“That was pretty close, mate.” Maria said. (Round glasses, grey eyes, short ginger hair, the girl who distracted Mr. Smithiams with 100% true conspiracy theories) and Tori noticed she was wearing a pair of goofy teeth. Tori leant forward.<br/>
“Is the time really tooth-hurty  already?” Tori said with a sly grin.<br/>
“Oh my god make it stop.” Divianee said. (She’s got the long black hair, currently tied in a half up-half down with brown eyes.)<br/>
“I’m wearing them to see how Smithiams would react. Y’know, spice up the class a bit.” Maria said.<br/>
“Pretty sure you tried this when we were nine, and you were marked absent.” Tori laughed.<br/>
“Are we working?” Mr. Smithiams spoke over the girls. Kaz nodded, but the table group immediately leaned in to chat.<br/>
“So which situation was it?” Kaz asked Tori in a whisper.<br/>
“None of the situations have ‘climbing up a building wall ’ in it, but I bet it was because…” Divianee said, turning to look at Tori, entering deep thought.<br/>
“You were buying… food?” she said.<br/>
“Well actually it was F, but I forgot to turn left so I would be at the back of the gym, where I could climb onto the roof and sneak in through that window there. So I had a chat with Jimmy, who now owes me because he said I wouldn’t climb the building.” Tori sighed, and then her slouchy posture jolted upright.<br/>
“Oh right! Mister Smithiams!” Tori said, putting her hand up.<br/>
“Yes, Victoria?” Mr. Smithiams said.<br/>
‘Really wish he didn’t call me that.’ Tori thought to herself.<br/>
“I have a treat for the class.” Tori said, reaching for her cart, only to grasp thin air.<br/>
“Oh darn.” she said. She ran to the window and poked her head out, spotting the cart of hot dogs.<br/>
“Well? What is it?” Mr. Smithiams said, annoyed.<br/>
“Uh… TOILET TIME BE RIGHT BACK!” Tori said.</p><p>     After bringing the hot dogs up the flights of stairs, and everyone eating them, she was handed a piece of paper by her teacher.<br/>
“Tomorrow we’re starting-EARTHQUAKES OH COME ON!” Tori said loudly.<br/>
“Ms. Kakahu, if you have a problem, you can take you and  your loud voice back here at lunch!” Mr. Smithiams scolded.<br/>
“Is that what you want?” he added. Tori sighed.<br/>
“As the great Dalai Lama once said… ‘Nah man, I’m cool ’.” Tori joked.<br/>
“Didn’t think so.” Smithiams said, looking back down at his papers.<br/>
“Ugh I hate earthquakes.” Tori muttered.<br/>
“I don’t know if the Dalai Lama has that as a quote.” Divianee whispered to Tori.<br/>
“Are you saying he’s never said no?” Maria said.<br/>
“Okay point made.” Divianee nodded. At least they got to watch a documentary instead of actually working. Social Studies was a really nice subject… to everyone except the students in Tori’s class. Don’t get them wrong, it’s amazing, but it’s always the teacher that sets the biggest feeling and opinions for a class, and with Mr. Smithiams, the class of 10GNMF (Tori’s class), all found it painfully boring, and most of them were going to drop it in year eleven. But, thankfully, she got to move to her next subject; Japanese, a class she actually liked.<br/>
“Ohayo class!” the teacher said, walking in while holding her books and papers.<br/>
“We will be focusing on past tenses today.” the Japanese teacher said, but for some reason, when Tori walked in, she couldn’t stop thinking about the earthquakes. Maybe because her uncle, Ruo*, was named after the-wait, spoilers, sorry-and he was probably going to visit her and her family soon... though with all the chemotherapy, it didn’t seem likely. Still.  Always nice to hope.<br/>
Tori sat down at her usual table with her usual friends: Aja, Kim, Emile and Jamie. Tori knew Aja and Jamie the best.<br/>
“Hey Tori!” they all said.<br/>
“Hey.” Tori sighed.<br/>
“Just a ‘hey’, in Japanese, your favourite class? Damn, Tori’s gettin’ the ol’ blues, huh?” Jamie smirked.<br/>
“Yeah, yeah.” Tori said dully.<br/>
“You okay, kiddo?” Jamie said, suddenly switching to being concerned.<br/>
“To quote Martin Luther King Jr… ‘I’m good cuh’.” Tori grinned. She sat down, pulling out her messy book with various varieties of scribblings on them, from funny japanese phrases she liked, to notes she discreetly passed to Aja, Jamie, Kim or Emile, or messages from the people Tori loved to sit with.<br/>
“Do you remember at Wickwan,” Aja begun. (Wickwan was their primary school, but Tori left after three years.)<br/>
“Yeah?” Tori said.<br/>
“When we found that homeless guy’s things?” Aja said with a laugh.<br/>
“Yeah! Maria was with us too!” Tori said.<br/>
“And we like… oh man what did we do?” Aja said.<br/>
“I remember; we took his things, thinking it was the house next to school.” Tori laughed.<br/>
“Yeah! He was so mad, he wrote a sign!” Aja said.<br/>
“And let me guess,” Jamie said.<br/>
“Maria wrote a reply on it.” Jamie finished.<br/>
“Yup.” Aja and Tori said in unison. The two laughed for a moment, and then resumed doing their work before they would be scolded.<br/>
“You know something Jamie?” Emile asked later on in the lesson.<br/>
“What?” Jamie asked.<br/>
“I’ve never  seen your hair tied up, like how I’ve never seen Tori’s hair let down.” Emile said.<br/>
“Hey, yeah!” Kim said.<br/>
“Yeah… Tori I’ve known you since we were seven, but I don’t think I’ve ever  seen your hair down.” Aja said.<br/>
“And I’ve known Jamie for a year now, and never seen her hair tied up too.” Aja said. Then, Aja, Kim and Emile all looked at each other, then at Jamie and Tori. The three girls slowly nodded and then scrambled to Tori and Jamie.<br/>
“I’ve got Jamie, you two hold down Tori!” Kim said to Aja and Emile. Kim pulled a hair tie she kept handy (for Tori, because her curly hair kept snapping hers) and struggled to wrap it around Jamie’s hair. Kim looked to Aja and Emile, who were both struggling to get Tori’s hair tie out of her hair.<br/>
“HAH! GOOD LUCK GETTING THIS HAIR TIE OUT OF MY  HAIR! IT’S SO TANGLED YOU’LL RIP ALL OF MY HAIR OUT BEFORE YOU GET THE HAIR TIE OFF!” Tori shouted with a manic laugh.<br/>
“We… can… get it… off!” Aja strained.<br/>
“DO YOU BRUSH YOUR HAIR?!” Emile asked, pulling at Tori hair.<br/>
“Yes, but the curls tangle itself immediately!” Tori gave another manic laugh.<br/>
“Girls what are you doing?!” the teacher said. Everyone stopped and returned to their seats.<br/>
“Get back to work.” the teacher said with a raised eyebrow.<br/>
“We’ll get you one day.” Kim said with squinting eyes.<br/>
“Looking forward to it.” Tori grinned.<br/>
Tori, as usual, jotted down notes from today’s lesson and then, just like that, interval was here. May and Divianee walked out of their spanish class, Tori catching up to them. Just as they left the class, a tall, blonde boy slung his arm (to her distaste) around May with a dramatic sigh.<br/>
“Oh! PE was awful! Had to pull out the bad babies!” he said, flexing his muscles.<br/>
“Rhodes.” Tori said without emotion. (Unless you count “being 100% done” an emotion.)<br/>
“Hello Victoria, you miss me?” Rhodes grinned.<br/>
“You know, you’re right, your muscles are  babies.” May said. The girls laughed as Anneke caught up to them as well.<br/>
“Are we talking about how small Rhodes’ muscles are?” she said.<br/>
“You guys are vicious.” Rhodes said. They all went to their normal hangout, and joked until they all laughed so hard their stomachs hurt.<br/>
“Oh, Tori! Are you bringing Enoke* around any time soon?” Divianee asked.<br/>
“Most likely sometime this week.” Tori said.<br/>
“Sweet cause I downloaded a movie for him onto your computer.” Divianee said.<br/>
“How-when-what?” Tori stuttered. Divianee only gave a smile as Tori and the rest of her group went back to talking.<br/>
And now, the day was over, and Tori, May, Maria and Jamie were all walking home together. Maria and Tori were singing as they walked, climbing on the rocks on their pathway and jumping off, May occasionally joining in only to avoid talking to Jamie for a long time. You see, May didn’t like Jamie, and Jamie didn’t like May. Maria didn’t like Jamie either. In fact the only one who liked Jamie in this current group (or pretty much the entire group, for that matter), was Tori. But, everyone got along because Tori made them.<br/>
“NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP! NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN!” Tori sang.<br/>
“NEVER GONNA RUN AROUND AND, DESERT YOU!” Maria continued.<br/>
“NEVER GONNA MAKE YOU CRY!” May sang.<br/>
“NEVER GONNA SAY GOODBYE!” they all said, huddling together. Jamie watched from a distance and laughed. Tori let Jamie catch up to her, smiling while the sun shone in her eyes.<br/>
“I don’t understand why you never wear your hair down.” Jamie said.<br/>
“Because I don’t want people flocking to me and playing with my hair as if they’ve never seen anything like it. I’m not about that.” Tori said.<br/>
“Why don’t you do it just once?” Jamie asked.<br/>
“I dunno. I reckon I need to grow into it, y’know?” Tori grinned.<br/>
“That is literally the biggest excuse I’ve ever heard.” Maria, Jamie and May said in unison.<br/>
“But think about it! Grown ups always wear their hair down with a middle part! It’s like some weird way of them going ‘Hey! I’m an adult now! Taxes! Responsibility! Occupation!’.” Tori said.<br/>
“And don’t forget they also say ‘fuel Capitalism! Money is power!” Maria chimed in. The girls all laughed, sweating under the summer sun of Aotearoa*.<br/>
After a few minutes, Tori checked the time and got a jolt of fear.<br/>
“GUYS IT’S FIVE WE TOOK THE TURN THAT TAKES FOREVER TO WALK!” she screamed. Everyone paused, felt fear course through them, and then began to sprint.<br/>
“I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU KNEW WHICH WAY YOU WERE GOING TORI!” May yelled.<br/>
“I LOST FOCUS MAY!” Tori retorted.<br/>
(Video number 3)<br/>
“OH MY GOD I WAS MEANT TO PICK UP ENOKE!” Tori said, running faster. Maria took a turn off, waving away her friends and getting home, while Jamie, May and Tori all ran to Petone*. Zooming up a ramp that lead onto a train bridge, Tori was rushing so much, she couldn’t take the time to admire and love the graffiti people had tagged in questionable places, like on the underside of the train tracks. (Seriously though, how do you do this when below that part of the train tracks, is nothing but a river?!)<br/>
“OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD!” Tori yelled, vaulting over the railing of a bridge to the field below it, (it was only a seven foot drop, so she was sorta okay) and ran. Up the small bank, over a miniature hill, with May and Jamie close behind her. They all ran across a park, dodging abandoned dog turds and flattening the grass as their feet slammed down, wind rushing past their faces.  Tori bolted past a girl walking three dogs, who waved at Tori.<br/>
“HEY CASS!” Tori yelled. She saw a man walk through a gate and slid through, grabbing it so it would open for Jamie and May.<br/>
“HEY KLAUS!” Tori said anxiously. Then they ran along a place called ‘Te Mome Stream’*, the eels slithering in the water, the Pukeko* walking proudly around their nests, and then Tori, May and Jamie ran over a curved bridge, through the willow trees, their branches tickling the girl’s faces and sheltering them from the sun while flowers danced in the wind. The tree trunks were locally known for their engravings of people’s relationships. Tori loved to think that the initials carved into the trees were still together, however, May did not think so optimistically.<br/>
“WE’VE GOTTA HURRY!” May screamed. Everybody ran, even though they were getting puffed out. Then, the three opened another gate leading into the field of Enoke’s school. After finally making it, the three bumped into Enoke’s teacher.<br/>
“Hey Karen! Where’s-” Tori began.<br/>
“Oh hey Tori! Enoke got picked up by your nan, didn’t she text you?” Karen said in her teacherly sweet tone. She was a very cheerful person. Tori pulled out her phone to see a text from her nan (or “Poppy” as Tori and Enoke like to call her) saying she picked up Enoke. May elbowed Tori in the ribs and shot a look that said “dumbass! I ran for nothing!” to which Tori flashed her signature nervous grin.<br/>
“Yup. Thanks, Karen.” she said, walking home.<br/>
May turned off to go to her house and Jamie followed suit a few streets later. Now, it was just Tori, walking down her long street.<br/>
“See ya tomorrow Tori.” Jamie said when she turned off to her street.<br/>
“Yup. See ya!” Tori replied. Walking down the street and quite frankly, absolutely done  with the silence, she plugged her earphones in and pressed play on her phone.<br/>
(Video number 4) Tori’s street was long and had many curves. Enoke usually called it the Eel. The winding path was often quite a lonely one if you didn’t have a friend to talk to or some music to listen to. The summer sun shone in Tori’s eyes.<br/>
“Least favourite part of Summer? The blinding light.” Tori said to herself. Even with her earphone’s music, Tori could hear the beautiful song of the tui*, the normal howling wind of Wellington, or as Tori would say, the whistle of Tawhirimatea* and the flowers and leaves of the Kowhai* and Pohutukawa* trees dancing in the wind… and a child playing in the middle of the road-<br/>
‘Wait what?! ’ Tori thought to herself. Her head spun around to see a three year old, no guardians to be seen, sitting in the middle of the road, unknowing to the car speeding towards him.<br/>
“Crap-JULIUS!” Tori said, throwing herself in front of the car. She grabbed the toddler and turned her back to the car, her feet just missing the car. Tori skidded across the road as she clutched Julius close to her, making sure he was okay.<br/>
Once she stopped, she let him go and got up, looking at her arm, and seeing droplets of blood.<br/>
“Whew, I do not  wanna see that graze. You okay Julius?” Tori asked. Julius nodded and soon, his mother rushed out.<br/>
“Oh my god!” she cried, sprinting out of her house and picking up her son.<br/>
“There you are oh-! Tori are you okay?!” the mother asked, kissing both her son and Tori. Tori gave a grin as she said,<br/>
“Yes, Miss Chatwell, I’m okay. Just a graze. This little trouble-maker, though. He’s gonna become a great adventurer by the looks of it-”<br/>
“THANK YOU SO MUCH TORI!” Miss Chatwell sobbed.<br/>
“Don’t mention it. I think we have an old child-gate-thingy leftover from when Enoke needed them. I can lend you them if you want.” Tori grinned. Miss Chatwell nodded as she continued to cry. She gave Tori one last bone-crushing hug, and let Tori go home, while Tori still listened to her music, ignoring the stinging graze on her arm she hadn’t dared look at.<br/>
She reached the end of the street, but crossed the road to pay a visit to Mrs. Sanchez.<br/>
“You know, when you say ‘pequena’*, you’re just calling me ‘small’, right?” Tori asked, watering some of the plants around her.<br/>
“Well, it’s accurate, pequena.” Mrs. Sanchez laughed.<br/>
“How was your day?” she asked, waking to hug Tori.<br/>
“Fantastic. Scaled the wall like a pro.” Tori said.<br/>
“You and you’re adventures.” Mrs. Sanchez laughed.<br/>
“I got that from you, Mrs. ‘Parkour-Champion-1977-1986’.” Tori laughed.<br/>
“Yes you did. But it was also  from your uncle. How is he, pequena?”<br/>
“He should be able to break away from the clinic soon and visit us.” Tori said, forcing a smile.<br/>
“I like him. He has the same spirit as you. And your father.”<br/>
“Yeah.” that was enough bad memories for the day. Just as Tori turned, her arm caught Mrs. Sanchez’s eye.<br/>
“Pequena…” she said, turning Tori’s arm to her. She jumped with fright.<br/>
“What happened to your arm?!” Mrs. Sanchez shrieked. Tori looked at her arm, to see her uniform sleeve was soaked with blood.<br/>
“Oh this? Oh-I…” Tori started.<br/>
‘There’s no point in doing good deeds if you’re just gonna tell everyone about it.’<br/>
“I… fell.” Tori lied. Suddenly, Tori found herself being dragged by the ear as she was painfully lead to Mrs. Sanchez’s living room couch. Tori liked this couch. Lots of gossip was exchanged here, and a lot of tears were shed there too. But this time, Tori was pushed onto the soft cushions as Mrs. Sanchez got Savlon Cream and bandages.<br/>
“Okay, let’s see this.” Mrs. Sanchez said, sitting down. Tori peeled her sleeve up with a wince, and saw it.<br/>
“OH MY GOD IT’S LIKE SOME PSYCHO KILLER TRIED TO KILL ME WITH A POTATO PEELER!” Tori shouted with a gag as her head jerked away, avoiding her wound. Mrs. Sanchez covered her mouth in shock before gulping and treating Tori. I would describe the wound, but… I think Tori said it best.<br/>
Finally, Tori’s arm was wrapped up, and she began to realise it was getting really late.<br/>
“Gotta fly, Mrs. Sanchez. I’ll see you tomorrow.” Tori smiled.<br/>
“I am an eighty-year-old. Don’t count on it.” Mrs. Sanchez joked.<br/>
“You and your death jokes. But I’ll drop by tomorrow and take care of your kitchen. Someone needs to clean that mess while you’re in the garden.” Tori chuckled.<br/>
But, Tori needed to leave before she started thinking about her dad and her uncle again.</p><p>     Tori got home to see her nan asleep on the couch as Enoke ran to give her a hug.<br/>
“Haha hey buddy.” Tori laughed. Tori tiptoed over to her sleeping Poppy and kissed her forehead, preparing to cook dinner. She turned on her music, but about twenty minutes in, she got a text.<br/>
‘Mum: “Hey babe, sorry, but tomorrow you might need to take Enoke into school.”’ Tori put her phone down, and resumed cooking. After she put Enoke to sleep and her Poppy had left, she walked into the lounge to see a photo of her dad.<br/>
“Miss you.” she said before going into her room to sleep.</p>
