    <p>There was a street fair in town, which Remus wanted to enjoy with Sirius, but that was not going to happen because Sirius had to join in a flash mob for Marly’s insane proposal. Yes, a flash mob, because they were back in 2005. Marlene wanted to declare her love for Dorcas by dancing in the middle of the street with strangers watching. She had tried to recruit Remus, but he refused. He wasn’t going to dance, he was perfectly fine watching the others do it. The others included Sirius.</p><p>For the last six weeks, Sirius and Remus had spent so much time together. The two were still constantly texting one another during the day. Sirius liked to drop by the gym all the time with Marlene, and they would climb or watch Remus. They were getting much better since getting on the rock on their first (second-ish) date. There was less screaming now. Remus also went to the studio to pick Sirius up often. They did dinner, drinks, or spent hours in each other’s flats listening to music, reading, or just being with one another.</p><p>They hadn’t had established anything. They were only seeing one another. There had been no grand confessions of love as of yet. Remus wondered if it was going to come along soon. He was dying to say something, but it never felt like the right time. Or maybe Remus was a bit of a coward and afraid to be let down… not that Sirius had shown any sign of not wanting to be with him. They were always eager to spend time with Remus.</p><p>They would have been having a nice day together today, but their lives had to come to a halt for Marlene’s grand proposal. Sirius had been pulled into help choreograph the whole thing to the song <em>Pretty Young Thing</em> by Michael Jackson. They had spent so many late nights with her and the other dancers putting it together. Now he was missing out on a nice day with Sirius at the market.</p><p>“This is so ridiculous,” Remus complained, looping an arm around Sirius’ waist.</p><p>Sirius smiled and rubbed their hand over Remus’ arm. “It’s Marly, Rem, what do you expect? Just this one thing, and then maybe we can steal off for a walk around the market before we go to James and Lily’s.”</p><p>“That’d be nice.” Remus pressed a kiss to Sirius’ cheek. “God, what is the wedding going to be like?”</p><p>Sirius’ eyes went wide. “Oh no, no, I can’t think about that. And you know Marly will ask me to be their… shit, I think she said <em> Person </em>of Honour before. So I’ll have to get really involved. It’ll be mad.”</p><p>“You brought this on yourself, being her friend.”</p><p>“I know, I should’ve gotten out whilst I could. But now we own a business and I buy her cocktail umbrellas and I’m gonna have to help planning a wedding.” Sirius let their head drop against Remus’ shoulder. “They’re cute though, so it’s okay, I guess.”</p><p>Remus chuckled as they stopped near the fountain that Sirius told him they had to be at. He looked and could see Dorcas at one of the stalls, chatting with someone with shocking pink hair. “There’s Dorky. I’ll step back and leave you to it.” He gave Sirius one more kiss, but didn’t move away as he said.</p><p>Sirius smiled and kissed his cheek. “Go on, you’ll wanna be far away from this embarrassment, won’t you? Oh, there’s Marly. I gotta go!” They squeezed Remus’ arm then slipped off towards the innocuously gathering crowd of Marlene and Dorcas’ friends and dancing colleagues.</p><p>Remus decided to stay by the fountain, taking his phone out of his pocket to get the whole thing on video. If anything, he wasn’t going to let Sirius live down the embarrassment.</p><p>Soon enough <em>Pretty Young Thing</em> began and the woman with the pink hair began to move. Dorcas looked at her like she had five heads. Then a few more people began to dance, Sirius being one of them. Remus was shaking with laughter as he watched the group spin and shake their hips. Normally, Remus loved to watch Sirius dance because they were so graceful, but this was not one of those times. Dorcas looked like she was turning redder than a cherry.</p><p>As the song came close to the end, the group parted and Marlene was in the middle. She danced her way up to Dorcas, who now had a hand over her face and her shoulders were shaking—Remus wasn’t sure if it was with laughter or tears. The music came to an end as Marlene got on one knee and said something, she was too far for Remus to hear. Dorcas nodded, now she had tears in her eyes, and Marlene slid the ring on. When she did that there was a burst of gold confetti from a few directions (how they managed that, Remus wasn’t sure) and then a few doves (Christ).</p><p>Marlene jumped to her feet and gave Dorcas the biggest, sloppiest kiss as the dancers and passersby clapped for the couple. Remus smiled at that, because it was sweet. Then the smile disappeared when a horse drawn carriage came into the little square. It was decorated in roses and a sign that read “Just Engaged”. Remus groaned at how extra the whole thing was, but he hadn’t really expected anything less.</p><p>As the horse and carriage trotted off with the girls on board, Remus put his phone away. His eyes searched the crowd for Sirius, and found them chatting with the woman with pink hair. They both were laughing with tears in their eyes. Remus hung back, deciding to wait for Sirius instead of interrupting the group.</p><p>It wasn’t that Remus was uncomfortable, but he didn’t know Sirius’ friends well yet. Even though Marly and Dorky were Remus’ mates, Dorky one of his best mates, there was still a group of friends Remus didn’t know. Tonight that was going to change because everyone was going to James and Lily’s, Sirius’ brother and best mate, to celebrate the engagement. He was a little nervous because this felt like a new step for them to take.</p><p>A few minutes after the carriage left, Sirius was back standing in front of him with a big grin on their face. “Nice job.” Remus smiled.</p><p>Sirius smiled, clearly excited. “I didn’t know about the sodding carriage. She’s so bloody extra, isn’t she? But,” they sighed happily, “I’m glad Dorky said yes. We all knew she would.”</p><p>“I would have been shocked if she said no.” Remus sat on the edge of the fountain. “She didn’t tell you about the carriage. I’m surprised. I thought she went over everything with you.”</p><p>“Probably because she knew I would tell her she’s being ridiculous with a carriage. Where are they going to go? Back to their flat?” Sirius said, laughing. “Or to James and Lily’s already? They’re probably just around the bloody corner.”</p><p>“Who knows. How long till we have to be at James and Lily’s place?”</p><p>Sirius checked their watch. “An hour. Want a walk around?”</p><p>“That sounds like a good idea. That was what I really wanted to do, though as over the top as that was, I’m happy for them.” Remus pushed himself off the fountain to stand next to Sirius.</p><p>“Me too, but I like the sound of this as well. There was a really interesting jewellery stall over that way, can we go see?” Sirius took Remus’ hand and laced their fingers. </p><p>“Sounds good,” Remus said as Sirius led them over to the stall. “Anything I should know about meeting James and Lily and any of the rest that might be there?”</p><p>Sirius looked at some of the jewellery for a minute before smiling up at Remus. “You’re nervous, aren’t you?” They bit their lip and looked back to a necklace on the stand. “They’re all lovely. James might feel a bit standoffish at first, but that’s just what he’s like meeting people close to me, he can be a bit protective. Lily will want to talk books, you can bring up Red, White and Royal Blue with her! There’s Fleur, Bill and Dora, she was the one with the pink hair in the mob. You’ll love them all, and they will love you.”</p><p>“You’re very sure of them loving me.” Remus laughed as he watched Sirius fiddling the necklace that was silver with a moon in the center then three stars on one strand, one star on another. “Do you want that necklace?”</p><p>Sirius rolled their eyes. “Well you’re important to me, so they’ll like you.” They glanced at Remus again. “Do you think it’ll suit me? I can ask them if I can try it on, maybe.”</p><p>Remus flushed at the statement because Sirius was important to him too. “Yeah, why don’t you try it on. It’s beautiful.”</p><p>Sirius shot him an almost shy smile before they caught the attention of the stall owner and asked to try it on. The owner obliged and took it off the display and handed it to Sirius. “Can you…?” Sirius held the necklace up between them, turning around a little. </p><p>Remus took the delicate necklace with one hand then brushed Sirius’ hair out of the way, letting his hand drift down Sirius’ back. They were wearing a loose grey shirt with a deep cut back that showed off their shoulders. Remus careful undid the clasp before leaning close to put the necklace around Sirius’ slender neck. He fixed the clasp before pressing the tiniest kiss to the nape. “Okay, let’s see it.”</p><p>Sirius shivered a little, turning back around and tilting their chin up to let Remus see the way the chains sat around their neck. “What do you think?”</p><p>“Beautiful, it suits you perfectly.” Remus ran a finger over the chain at Sirius’ neck.</p><p>Sirius caught Remus’ hand and pressed a kiss to his knuckles. “Thank you. I think I’ll get it. Why not.”</p><p>Remus smiled, and asked the owner of the stall how much the necklace was as he reached for his wallet.</p><p>“Er…” Sirius looked up from their bag, frowning at Remus. “Hold on, no no. What are you doing?”</p><p>“Buying it for you, it’s a gift.” Remus shrugged as he took out enough money to pay for it. “I want to get it for you. Is that okay?”</p><p>Sirius’ expression softened and they hooked their hand through the crook of Remus’ arm. “That’s… yeah, that’s okay. That’s really sweet of you, Rem. Thank you.”</p><p>Remus smiled at Sirius then they started to walk again. “Anywhere else you wanted to look?”</p><p>“We can just look around, if you like.” Sirius kept touching the necklace as they walked, glancing around through the stalls. “Last time there was a market here I’m sure there was a little book stall.”</p><p>“Oh, I remember that. They sold vintage books, right?” Remus said as his eyes went up the street, wondering if it was around.</p><p>“Yeah! Let’s see if we can find it.” Sirius smiled at Remus. “Thank you for the necklace.”</p><p>Remus leaned into Sirius as they continued to walk. “I thought it was nice, you don’t have to keep thanking me.”</p><p>Sirius rolled their eyes. “Oh yeah, absolutely, I’ll just let this utterly gorgeous man buy me gifts and not be grateful or anything.”</p><p>“You can thank me with a few good kisses later.” Remus grinned before spotting the stall. “There’s the books!”</p><p>“I’ll hold you to that, Lupin,” Sirius said, letting Remus lead the way over to the book stall and smiling indulgently. “Okay, let’s go see.”</p><p>Remus sorted through the books, finding an old leather bound copy of Persuasion. It was in beautiful condition. “Oh, I’m getting this.”</p><p>“No you’re not,” Sirius said, smiling. “I’m getting it for you. Feeding the eternal Austen obsession.”</p><p>“Come on, Sirius, no. You don’t have to do this because I bought you the necklace.” Remus held up the book with a little frown.</p><p>“I know I don’t <em> have </em> to do it. But I want to.” They reached up and turned the book over in Remus’ hand to see the price tag. “I would like to buy you something that makes you happy because I like you being happy.”</p><p>“But…” Remus trailed off because he wasn’t sure what to say. He wanted to put up more of an argument, but Sirius was being so sweet.</p><p>Sirius stepped closer, putting a hand on Remus’ chest and leaning in to kiss him lightly. “Let me make you happy, okay?” They said, very close to Remus’ lips. “And buy you the book.”</p><p>“I thought paying my back in kisses was good enough.” His free hand went up to Sirius’ necklace.</p><p>Sirius tutted. “I’m still going to pay you back in kisses later for the necklace. But I want to buy you the book, regardless of anything else.” Sirius kissed Remus again, longer and slower this time, still soft and gentle.</p><p>Remus hummed into the kiss, as one of Sirius’ hands slid down his side. When they pulled away Remus felt a bit dizzy from the kiss. Sirius grinned, and it took Remus a moment to realise he was no longer holding the book, and that it was in Sirius’ hands instead. Before he could do anything, Sirius stepped back and to the stall owner, handing over the cash for the book.</p><p>“Bastard!” Remus said under his breath. “You’re a brat.”</p><p>Sirius laughed, throwing their head back. “Yep!” They gestured with the book. “Shall I put this in my bag?”</p><p>“That works, love.” Remus said in a lighter tone. “You’re still a brat.”</p><p>“I’ll take it.” Sirius slid the book into their bag and took Remus’ hand again.</p>
