          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in Fred and Hermione Weasley's house. Their daughter Rose has invited her cousin James Sirius Potter over.</p><p>James asked, "Where are your parents?"</p><p>Rose told him, "They're at the shop."</p><p>James smirked. "They trust you enough to leave you home alone?"</p><p>Rose said, "Yeah, do yours not?"</p><p>James replied, "My dad and stepdad don't, but my mum and stepmum do."</p><p>Rose chuckled. "You and your dad have a weird relationship though, Jay."</p><p>James stated, "Not really. Anyway, can I ask you something?"</p><p>Rose nodded.</p><p>James inquired, "Would you like to go out with me, Rosie?"</p><p>Rose sighed. "Oh, but what about my dreadfully handsome boyfriend Hugo?"</p><p>James gasped. "H-Hugo Weasley?!"</p><p>Rose smiled. "That's the one, son of Ron and Lavender Weasley."</p><p>James stuttered, "B-B-But what about us?"</p><p>Rose giggled. "You're too gullible."</p><p>James scowled. "Were you joking?"</p><p>Rose grinned. "Yep, I'm a practical joker, it's what we do."</p><p>James rolled his eyes. "Well, what's your actual answer to my question?"</p><p>Rose beamed, "Yes, I'd love to go out with you."</p></div>
