    <p>Only a few short hours later, Ophelia was awoken by a jarring knock at her door. It startled her terribly, and she leapt to her feet. It felt as though she hadn’t slept at all.</p><p>“Come in,” she beckoned, donning her silk dressing gown.</p><p>The door opened, and her uncle peered inside. “<em>S'habiller. Nous sortons de ce lieu misérable, et allons au château.”</em></p><p>She blinked up at him, bewildered.</p><p>“<em>Le Château Lestrange</em>.”</p><p>She stammered, “I—I’m sorry, I—”</p><p>His face darkened. “You weren’t taught French.”</p><p>She shook her head. “No, I’m sorry.”</p><p>He swore under his breath, bowing his head in frustration. “We’re going to the castle. Get dressed.” With that, he turned and strode angrily out into the hall. “<em>Lucius</em>! Why doesn’t this girl know French?”</p><p>She sprinted out into the hall, stopping just outside her door. “Uncle!” she called after him, “What castle?”</p><p>He paused, smiling over his shoulder at her. “<em>Our</em> castle.” He turned back towards the stairs, and resumed his castigation of the Malfoy patriarch. “Lucius, <em>vous homme inutile</em>, I’ll strike you <em>blind</em> for this! We told you to make <em>sure</em> she learned French!”</p><p>Despite herself, Ophelia couldn’t help but feel a whisper of a thrill, as she quickly bathed and dressed. After a lifetime spent transplanted into another family, she would finally get to see where she came from. She wondered if it would feel like a home to her. She wondered if it wouldn’t be better if she hated the place.</p><p>She wanted to cover the evil Mark on her arm, if only so she wouldn’t have to see it. But she knew the Lestranges wouldn’t stand for that. So, she donned one of her strapless corset dresses. The skirt was made up of thick folds of dark red fabric; falling above her knees in the front, and down to her ankles in the back. The corset was black leather, crisscrossed with straps and buckles. A set of knee-high black leather boots completed the ensemble.</p><p>When she descended the stairs to the sitting room, her family was waiting. The Malfoys were nowhere to be found, no doubt waiting for the Lestranges to vacate their home before they emerged. Her father smiled when he saw her, standing and opening his arms to her. She forced a smile in return, allowing him to embrace her.</p><p>“Come, my child,” he murmured, “It’s time to go home.”</p><p>With a crack, they dissolved into a cloud of black smoke. A moment later, they materialized on the front drive of <em>Le Château Lestrange</em>.</p><p>The Malfoys had a Manor. The Lestranges had a <em>castle</em>.</p><p>It loomed over her in an obscene display of wealth and power. No matter how far she craned her neck, there still seemed to be more. It was a sprawling estate, built in the French Baroque style. Steep, black-tiled mansard roofs, housing sinister, dormered windows. A number of dizzying spires were clustered together on the east side of the manor; an odd note of chaotic asymmetry. The entire structure looked as though it was bleeding. The façade was composed of bright-red brick, deep-trimmed with black. The dark-curtained windows were crisscrossed with red framing. Ophelia was awestruck.</p><p>With a crack, Bellatrix and Rodolphus materialized beside them. Catching sight of his niece’s facial expression, Rodolphus smiled.</p><p>“Oh, it’s good to be home!” Bellatrix opened her arms to the manor and cackled, characteristically obscene. When she moved to stride for the door, Rabastan caught her by the arm, yanking her back.</p><p>“Where have your manners gone?’ he scolded, earning a mocking sneer from his sister in law.</p><p>Rodolphus looked down at his niece, a proud expression on his face. “<em>Viens</em>.” He gestured for her to follow him, leading her up the stone steps to the massive, black-iron doors. They were emblazoned with a cruel-looking Lestrange raven, its wingspan extending over two meters across.</p><p>“There’s no handle,” she remarked, scanning over the ornate surface. “How do we get inside?”</p><p>Again, he smiled. “<em>Attends</em>.”</p><p>He took her hand in his, pressing his lips to her knuckles. She watched in silence fascination as he extended her arm, placing her palm flat against the cold metal. She jumped in surprise when, all at once, the building began to rumble. Rodolphus released her hand, and for the first time in nearly fifteen years, the doors to <em>Chateâu Lestrange</em> began to swing open.</p><p>“No lock,” he explained, “No key. Only a Lestrange can open these doors.”</p><p>When the quartet strode, shoulder-to-shoulder, into the grand entryway, Ophelia gasped. The foyer was three-storied, encircled by columns and balconies. The ivory walls were carved with intricate bas-relief; winding snakes, wreathed with vines and flowers. A large, white-marble statue of a Harpy stood watch in the center of the room. She was bare-breasted; her wings extended demurely as she clung to a branch with gold-tipped talons. Dusty, spider-like chandeliers dripping with black diamonds hung from the vaulted ceiling, and heavy doors seemed to lead out of the foyer in every direction. Ophelia could see straight back through the Grand Salon, to the vast, Versailles-styled garden outside. The place had clearly fallen into a state of neglect, after so many years spent empty. But it was breathtaking, nonetheless.</p><p>Rabastan laughed softly, studying his daughter’s reaction.</p><p>“<em>Les Malfoy pensent avoir de l'argent</em>,” Rodolphus murmured.</p><p>“The Malfoys think they have money,” Rabastan translated.</p><p>Ophelia shook her head in bewilderment. “They’re wrong.”</p><p>Her father, aunt, and uncle all laughed heartily.</p><p>“Go on and re-acquaint yourself,” her father coaxed, planting a kiss to the top of her head, “We’ll get this place back in order.”</p><p>Ophelia wandered around the house in wide-eyed awe. There was a kind of childish delight to be had, in flinging back the dustsheets to discover what treasures lay beneath. Each time, her smile broadened. Every room she entered seemed more opulent than the last. Directly off the foyer was a dining hall, with a ridiculously long ebony table. She counted 36 place settings.</p><p>She took to the gardens next, and her heart ached at her inability to use her wand. She wanted to mend it, she wanted to make everything bloom and turn green again. It was her favorite kind of magic to perform; restorative charms and transfiguration. Alas, she would have to leave it to her guardians. There was a hedge maze, near the back of the estate, which she avoided. It had an uncomfortable association, these days. Then, beside a fountain in one of the more overgrown areas of the garden, she found a rather disturbing scene. A quartet of tiny, unmarked graves, all of varying age and overgrowth. And, lying beside them, was the bleached skeleton of a House Elf, clutching a shovel. It was then that she noticed the finger bones sticking out of the section of turned earth nearest to him.</p><p>He’d died burying his last family member, and no one had been there to bury him.</p><p>Revulsion took hold in the pit of her stomach, and she had to turn away. She’d tell her father about it. He’d clear it up. But it wasn’t something she could look at, anymore, and so she retreated back inside.</p><p>One of the towers, she discovered, was entirely occupied by a massive library. A spiral staircase twisted up along the book-lined walls, extending high above the array of rich, wooden desks and overstuffed chairs scattered across the ground floor. There was a wide hearth curving along the wall, and she hoped that someday she would see it lit. She could spend hours in there, alone, she thought. The idea of the wealth of ancient knowledge at her fingertips was thrilling. To her dismay, all of the books seemed to be in French.</p><p>The castle had two master suites, upstairs. One of them, she surmised, had once belonged to her parents. It was adjoined to a nearly-empty nursery. The bedroom itself was cavernous, and it housed the largest four-poster bed she’d ever seen. Every stick of furniture was black and gold, French Baroque-styled. A door on the east wall led to an ensuite, with a massive, claw-footed bathtub. She, Fred, and George could all fit in it together, she thought, and rather comfortably.</p><p>Another door led to what she could only assume was her mother’s boudoir. There was a vanity mirror, a fainting couch. And the wardrobe, <em>god</em>, the wardrobe. It had been magically extended to the size of an entirely separate room. She walked through it in awe, running her hands along the bolts of dark velvet, the furs, the resplendent brocade. There was an entire wall of shoes, another of jewelry. Her mother had been a noble woman, indeed.</p><p>She slipped one of the garments from its hanger; a long, wine-colored frock coat. Thick laces crisscrossed up the outside of the sleeves, and the hem and wrists were trimmed with black lace. Gold buttons, high collar. It was decadent. And it had belonged to Elladora Yaxley.</p><p>Just then, a noise sounded from out in the room. Still clutching the coat, Ophelia popped her head out of the wardrobe. She expected to see her father. But instead, it was her uncle. He had knocked over a series of dusty phials, atop the vanity mirror, and was hastily attempting to right them.</p><p>She announced her presence in a soft, unassuming voice. “Uncle?”</p><p>He whipped around to face her, wearing the unmistakable look of a man who had been cornered. “Ah,” he greeted, straightening up, “I see you’ve found your mother’s things.”</p><p>“I have.”</p><p>He nodded, looking away. “She was a formidable woman,” he said, fiddling with one of the perfume bottles, “One of the true heroes of our cause.”</p><p>“I have no memory of her at all,” Ophelia admitted.</p><p>After a beat of tense silence, Rodolphus beckoned for her. “Walk with me.”</p><p>She moved to re-hang the coat, but he stopped her.</p><p>“No,” he commanded sternly, “Wear it. She’d want you to.”</p><p>Awash with a wave of pride, she did as she was told.</p><p> </p><p>           </p><p>Rodolphus led her back out into the grey gardens, where they walked arm-in-arm down the straight, right-angled paths. Occasionally, he would draw his wand and right something. Mend a fountain, revitalize a garden bed. The place came alive in their wake, with blooming flowers, and hues of red and brown changing to green. It was beautiful.</p><p>“Did you know my mother well?” Ophelia tentatively asked.</p><p>Rodolphus’ face took on a kind of pained expression. “I’m not sure I’m the one to tell you about her,” he finally answered.</p><p>She gathered her brow, unsure of what to make of that response.</p><p>“Your father is the one to ask, child,” he said softly, shifting her arm in his grip, “Not me.”</p><p>There was a story there, she could sense it. And, for reasons that she couldn’t hope to articulate, she had no desire to hear it from her father. Not him, not that man who had cursed her with his name, cursed her with his face, and then abandoned her.</p><p>“It makes me sick, to think of you trapped in that blasted Manor, all these years,” Rodolphus mused bitterly, “A fledgling raven all alone, without her family. Was it tolerable, at least?”</p><p>She hesitated, trying to decide how to answer.</p><p>“Be honest with me, girl,” he urged, “You’re among the cherished ones, now. You’ve nothing more to fear from Lucius Malfoy.”</p><p>“It was an unkind childhood.” A diplomatic way to phrase it.</p><p>His expression darkened. “In what way?”</p><p>“Narcissa hits me,” she admitted, rather impulsively.</p><p>Rodolphus exhaled a litany of French curses, tugging his niece a little closer to him. “That vile woman,” he sneered, “How <em>dare</em> she? Oh, don’t you worry, my dear, we shall see to it that she understands the error of her ways.”</p><p>He gave his niece a comforting pat on the arm, and Ophelia couldn’t help but feel an odd rush of vindication. She held her head high, and let a rueful smile play across her face. In a moment of boldness, she decided to try and test the waters.</p><p>“Narcissa told me, a few weeks ago, that I’m not going to marry Draco, anymore.”</p><p>Rodolphus laughed. “Is that what they’ve been telling you, all these years?” he sneered, “What would be the point of that? So they can get their hands on our vault? Our estate?”</p><p>She shook her head, stunned by this turn of events. “I suppose I don’t know.”</p><p>“No, no, no,” he reassured her, “We’ll make a better match for you than Draco Malfoy. We’ll begin sending letters to the pure-blood French families, very strategically. Get a bidding war started. We’ll find you a Rosier boy, or one of the Travers’. LeClair, perhaps. I think we could even do as well as Lafite, if all goes according to plan. They’ve a son who’d be about 26, now.”</p><p>“I went to the Yule Ball with Augustin Travers, last year.” She wasn’t entirely sure why she’d said it. She didn’t want to marry Augustin Travers, or any of those boys he’d named. Didn’t know them, and didn’t care to. Her heart was somewhere else, and there it would stay. But she was searching for some sort of handle on the moment, something familiar upon which to ground herself. Something to keep her uncle talking.</p><p>“Did you, now?” he asked, seeming to be genuinely interested, “Little Augustin.”</p><p>“I don’t think he likes me very much, anymore,” she admitted.</p><p>“Oh, no?”</p><p>“He left me, halfway through, because I can’t speak French.”</p><p>“Oh, you poor girl,” Rodolphus chuckled sympathetically. “Not to worry, we’ll fix that, for you. And then that boy won’t have any cause to run away. Not from a beautiful thing like you.”</p><p>“He has a big brand,” she told him, pointing to her neck, “Some words in French, just there.”</p><p>“<em>Brûlez vos ponts et restez seul,”</em> he murmured, “Their family creed. Yes, he’d be 17, now. I expect they’d have gotten him started. But you, my dear,” he beamed down at her, “You’re the bearer of a Dark Mark. And that’s not something Augustin Travers can boast, now is it?”</p><p>Her stomach flipped. She tried to force a smile, but her effort fell short.</p><p>With a deep sigh, he led her over to a stone bench beside a nearby fountain., He repaired the cracked marble with a graceful flourish of his wand, and the water began to flow again.</p><p>“It’s never easy, in the beginning,” he murmured gently, “There’s pain and fear, and that can plant the seed of doubt. But you are young, still. You will learn. This is your birthright. And we are so, so close now. I can taste our victory, and it is such a sweet, beautiful thing.”</p><p>When she did not answer him, he glanced down to see her eyeing his brands with wide, glassy eyes.</p><p>“I suppose you’ve never seen anything like this before, have you?” he asked, unbuttoning his fine shirt.</p><p>From what Ophelia could tell, his lean torso was completely carved with tattoos. In the very center of his chest, he bore a perfect, anatomical diagram of a heart; the bottom half of which faded into a gaping skull. It was beset on either side by a pair of black ravens, beaks open, mid-flight. There were roses and twisting snakes, words in French. And the space between the bigger designs was peppered with innumerable arcane symbols and runes, including a rather large piece on his throat.</p><p>He smiled proudly. “The Malfoys have never had the salt for it, but we’re made of harder stuff, aren’t we? We Lestranges may live lavishly, but by my wand, we earn it. By flesh, blood, and precious, irreplaceable time, we earn it.”</p><p>She nodded, eyes traveling across the brands. They were beautiful, she could not deny. But whether she’d ever want them on her own skin was a different matter. She tentatively reached out, touching her fingertip to one of the ravens. It looked as though it were about to swoop off of his chest, and peck her eye out.</p><p>“Who did them?” she asked softly.</p><p>“My father, Reinhard. And I did your father’s. And, someday, he and I will do yours.”</p><p>She looked up at him, wide-eyed.</p><p>“You’ll want them,” he nodded severely, “I promise you that. They’re marks of protection, and fortification. Strengthen your mind, strengthen your body. They make you powerful. And, when done properly, they can even save your life. Almost akin to that accidental bit of magic that spared the Potter boy. But we move with more purpose than that. We do not trust the safety of our children to hope and coincidence.”</p><p>“Does it hurt?” she hesitantly asked.</p><p>He laughed. “Of course, it hurts. But what did I just tell you, girl?”</p><p>She bowed her head. “Made of harder stuff.”</p><p>“<em>Précisément</em>.”</p><p>It was a lot to take in. And although it was not how she felt, she knew precisely what to say. “I’ll be honored, Uncle. Truly.”</p><p>“Well, you’ve got to earn them, first. Your name garnered you a Dark Mark, but for these, you’ll have to prove yourself.” He began buttoning up his shirt again. “I hope that day comes soon.”</p><p>“I know it will,” she told him earnestly, “I promise, I’ll serve our cause well. I’ll make you proud.”</p><p>The words made her sick to say. But Rodolphus cast her a warm smile, placing a hand on her cheek.</p><p>“I know you will, <em>Ophélie</em>.”</p><p>For the first time, she saw something more than cold fury behind his shining eyes. It was as though this time with her had dragged some life back into him. She could see love, in those dark eyes. Maybe just a whisper, and maybe only for a moment. But it was undeniably there. And it twisted her heart with conflict and turmoil.</p><p>“What about those?” she asked, pointing to the large, silver tunnels through his earlobes. “What do they mean?”</p><p>“These are just decoration,” he told her, “Nothing to be earned or proven, beyond our sense of pure-blood vanity. I’ve been trying to get your father to wear them for years. Alas, he claims his sensibilities are finer.”</p><p>“I like them,” she said with a smile. “They suit you.”</p><p>“I could give you one,” he offered, “Nice, big teardrop, on your left side. That would really get my brother wound up.”</p><p>It wasn’t something she wanted, per se. But, strangely, she found that she wanted this man to feel some happiness. At least for this blink of time, before she destroyed him. It was a harmless thing, after all. A small concession. And she knew that it would only deepen his trust in her. So, she smiled at him, and said, “I think I would love that, uncle.”</p><p>Rodolphus Lestrange was, for the first time in 14 years, beaming.</p><p>He took her back inside, and settled her into a high-backed chair in the sitting room before hurrying off to gather some tools. He made the incision with the tip of his wand, pressing it into the center of her earlobe and twisting until it burned straight through. She could smell the singed flesh, but at least that meant it wasn’t bleeding on her resplendent frock coat. The pain made her eyes water, but she didn’t cry out, didn’t screw up her face. Not even when he thumbed the hollow, silver teardrop into place, stretching the hole even further. <em>Made of harder stuff,</em>she told herself.</p><p>Afterwards, he sat her up, handed her a mirror, and she thanked him. Never mind the unexpected heaviness of the jewelry, never mind the dull ache that seemed to be radiating all the way down her neck. She found she liked the look of it, after all. It made her seem hard. It aged her. He told her he’d get her a nice stone for it, when he could. Pick up some Obsidian, or Tourmalinated Quartz from old Mr. Borgin. Something that would keep her safe.</p><p>He took her face in his hands, and pressed gentle kisses to her eyes, told her she was brave and beautiful. She tried to remind herself that this was an evil man, who had done truly evil things. She tried to resist the warmth spreading through her chest. But, for the first time in her life, Ophelia Lestrange felt as though she were a part of her own family.</p><p>Pleased with his work, Rodolphus sent his niece off to find her father. And so, she resumed her solitary wandering through the castle, until she heard a voice sounding from the library. When she stepped into the doorway, she saw Rabastan. He was running his hands along the spines of the many books, occasionally slipping one from the shelf to flip through it. And he was singing.</p><p>“<em>You gave it to me, through the eyes, hatred,</em></p><p>
  <em>Centuries deep and true.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I was wrong, graceless, and sick.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>All of the things that I had learned had been wasted.”</em>
</p><p>His voice was not unlike hers. The way he delayed his vibrato to the point you were afraid it’d be too late to add it. The way he leapt from note to note. It hit her in an odd blend of emotion. Betrayal, revulsion. Anger at the undeniable similarity. And yet, somehow, there was a feeling like sympathy mixed in with it. Maybe even compassion. Connection.</p><p>“<em>There is no living creature as foul as I,</em></p><p>
  <em>And all of my poems were false.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I could feel my soul, dropping down through the night.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I had to leap up before I hit the floor,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And I’m so alone.”</em>
</p><p>The last note hung in the air, he dropped it down a minor third. His hand waved in the air, conducting a silent, imaginary orchestra. And then Ophelia did something she hadn’t planned to do.</p><p>“<em>Illumination held out in front of my reaching arms.” </em>The melody was high and piercing, but it came through clear on her voice.</p><p>Rabastan whipped around to see his daughter. And for the first time in many, many years, he felt a pang of genuine happiness. He was shocked to have recognized the emotion, after more than a decade without so much as a whisper of it. But there she stood, reminding his heart what it felt like.</p><p>“<em>The darker things get, the better I see</em>.” She knew the song.</p><p>They sang the last line together, an octave apart. “<em>I’m so alone, and so are you, we all live and die that way.”</em></p><p>He breathed a cathartic sigh, tears springing to his eyes. And, just as had happened with Rodolphus, she felt akin to him. The years spent under the Malfoys thumb melted away. All of Narcissa’s blows, all of Lucius’ spite and vitriol. He was here, now. Loving her. And isn’t that what mattered? No longer just a panicked, tear streaked face; a criminal swallowed up by the Aurors’ manacles. He was home, now, dressed in his regal clothes. Fed and rested, and returning to his former glory. And, for the briefest of moments, Ophelia actually forgave him.</p><p>Rabastan opened his arms to his daughter, and she went to him. She pressed her face into his shoulder, felt his arms wrap around her.</p><p>“I love you.” He murmured it over and over, like a desperate prayer. “I love you, I love you, I love you.”</p><p>It felt jarring to hear, shaking loose some of her resolve. It made her think of the twins. She said it back, of course. But only once, and very softly. Even still, she felt the words tug uncomfortably at the pit of her stomach.</p><p>“I see Dolph finally talked someone into getting one of his <em>idiotic</em> earrings,” he chuckled, leaning back to take in the sight of it.</p><p>“It hurt terribly,” she admitted, somewhat sheepishly.</p><p>“Ahh, but you’re a hard one,” he said with a proud smile.</p><p>That seemed to be something that Lestranges put a lot of stock in. Being hard.</p><p>“He’s been hounding me over it for decades,” he continued, “Whispering about it through the prison bars, the madman. In some of his more unhinged moments, over the years, he would try to insist its why we got caught in the first place.”</p><p>“Because you didn’t have earrings?” she asked, a bemused smile crossing her features.</p><p>He grimaced slightly, shaking his head. “Azkaban prison is like a dull knife, twisting in your guts, Ophelia. Madness is such a poor descriptor. It tangles you up, inside; hollows you out. Replaces every good thing in you with pain. I hope, with all of my heart, that you never see the inside of one of those cells.”</p><p>She furrowed her brow. “I hope that, too.”</p><p>“I’d die, before I let them take you,” he impressed, tugging her back into his arms, “Truly.”</p><p>She didn’t know what to say, how to react. She wanted to know about her mother, but didn’t want to ask. Not him, not now.</p><p> “Rodolphus sent me to find you,” she awkwardly relayed, “He says you need to remember to eat, and he wants us all to dine together.”</p><p>“Yes.” He exhaled sharply, clutching her to his chest, “Yes, we’ll be a proper family, for once.”</p><p> </p><p>They were. The last Lestranges in England gathered in their dining room, that night, and shared in a rich, decadent meal together. Rodolphus sat at the head of that long, ebony table; a patriarch in noble resplendence, surrounded by his family. They laughed together, telling this perfect, beautiful child of theirs all of the happy stories they knew. Stories about good times, when they were young together. She felt loved. Wanted. Important.</p><p>Afterwards, they retired to the salon with a bottle of wine. Rabastan lit a roaring fire in the hearth, and Rodolphus filled all of their glasses. Ophelia sat on the floor, in front of the sofa, and let her aunt weave intricate braids through her hair. Bellatrix was like a wild animal, finally released from her cage. She seemed slightly out of place, among the rest of them; with her flyaway hair, and her ripped clothing. She was obscene, she was theatrical. And she and Rodolphus never touched. Once Ophelia noticed it, it was impossible to ignore. Not a single kiss was shared between husband and wife, not so much as a squeeze of the hand. But they loved their beautiful niece. That much was clear.</p><p>And then, all at once, reality came crashing back down in an apocalyptic wave. The trio began reminiscing about the past, and planning for the future. They regaled her with the story of their great escape; how they'd whispered secret promises to the Dementors, and gained their favor. They gossiped like children about Augustin Travers, planning how they would orchestrate the match. The trio talked at length about how he and Ophelia were destined for such terrible greatness together, and how they relished the thought of all the lives that would surely end at her touch. They wanted to know all about Barty Crouch Jr., and the time she spent with him. When she revealed that he’d taught her the Unforgivable Curses, the pride and vindication in their eyes made her sick. They described, in terrible detail, the litany of horrors they would deliver upon the Weasleys. Upon Neville Longbottom. Upon Dumbledore.</p><p>She would have liked to paint out all of their hateful words, and focus instead on the cadence of their voices. The sound of her name, as it was spoken by her father. But she forced herself to listen. Forced herself to remember. This is who these people were. And nothing would ever, ever change them.</p><p>It was a stark reminder of her intention, here. She wanted to see them destroyed, even if it destroyed her, too. <em>That</em> was her birthright, not a Dark Mark and the chance to bear Travers children. Nevertheless, she could not deny: the sense of belonging was beyond decadent. The experience of being loved by her own family was, perhaps, even more intoxicating than the wine.</p><p>After a time, Ophelia’s eyelids became heavy. So, she climbed up onto the couch to lay with her head on her father’s knee. The mood turned light again, as he and Rodolphus tried to teach her phrases in French. They were endlessly amused by her shaky pronunciation, laughing and teasing her.</p><p>She fell asleep, there. Wrapped in her mother’s frock coat, with her father’s warm handprint moving across her back, and the guilt of enjoying it gnawing away at her heart.</p>
