    <p align="left">It comes on slowly.</p><p>At first, Harry's nothing more than a scrawny eleven-year-old that Delphi wants to be friends with. Sure, he's a celebrity and his friendship will come with perks, but honestly, it's more about showing up Draco than anything else.</p><p>But then he's her friend, and he needs someone to rescue him from the siren song of the Mirror, and he's more interested in solving mysteries than schoolwork, and he's brave enough to go save the Stone alone.</p><p>And then Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived himself, is <em>speaking Parseltongue</em>, and Delphi finally realizes she's head over heels.</p>
