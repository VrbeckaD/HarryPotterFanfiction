    <p>As she fell from the incredible height with her eyes closed at the exhilarating rush of adrenaline, she could feel the pressure and flush of wind carrying her across and suddenly, it changed and she was enveloped in someone's arms and quickly seated on a somewhat worn broom, once again he had saved her. Time and time again, he always was there, how she wished this time he didn't, but Harry always found a way. She then had immediately clutched her fingers through the cloth of his sleeping robe while she dug her nails into his skin through the fabric to keep herself from plummeting to her death again if she fell, this time determined not to allow herself to die as she'd only be saved again.</p><p>“Don't ever try anything like that again.”</p><p><em>It wasn't Harry.</em> That wasn't Harry's voice, she knew that voice anywhere, albeit it did sound more mature and older, but she could identify it anywhere if you had just asked. Her breathing hitched, she thought she was going to have another panic attack.</p><p>It was Darco. <em>Why? How? How long has he known?</em> Millions of questions swirled in her mind. He tried to slowly fly her back to the ground as to not frighten her but she didn't feel anything at all. The weight on her shoulders took hold, not fully but near so completely. She was still here.</p><p>As if sensing a bit of her curiosity, he answered plainly, emotion void from his voice as he continued to stare straight ahead maneuvering the broom. “I saw you vigorously writing and took a peak in the parchment over the past three weeks as I had a hunch. I couldn't stop myself from rushing out here.”</p><p>She had known and studied him long enough to know what he meant even though there was no direct apology spoken nor laced in his words, and she had forgiven him all over again. Interestingly enough, this time she wasn't as triggered by his similar resemblance to one of her torturers. Sure she had trouble catching her breath and may be clinging onto him much too tightly, but she actually thought she might be okay, just this once. </p><p>She still hadn't let go of him and hid her face into his back so he couldn't see her cry again, but this time, these tears were filled with grief rather than fear. He stiffened as he was unable to properly handle his own emotions let alone another's, so as they finally settled he soothingly rubbed circles onto the top and over the palm of her hand with his thumb as his mother had always done for him. She finally looked up at him as he stared at her longingly, as if there wasn't enough said.</p><p>The exchange in their eyes told a million words and regrets. </p><p> </p>
