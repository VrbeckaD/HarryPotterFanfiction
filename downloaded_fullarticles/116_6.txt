    <p>"Today we all have four exchange students among us and I would like each of you to come up once we call your name" Dumbledore said and everyone in the Great Hall broke out into whispers. "Devin Crow".</p><p>A boy with fawn hair and green eyes walked down the middle of the hall. The boy seemed resigned to be there.</p><p>"Tristin Tames" </p><p>A girl with blonde curly hair and light blue eyes bounced down the aisle. She looked excited to be there.</p><p>"Dorin Detris"</p><p>A boy with black hair and silver eyes swaggered towards Dumbledore. The boy's hands were in his pockets and his posture relaxed.</p><p>"Gretel Swayze"</p><p>A girl with red hair and deep green eyes got up. Her eyebrows were arched, her nose was small, she had a sharp jawline, and her lips were full and plush. Her muggle jeans were skin tight, showing off her perky bubble butt, topped off with black converse. Her upper body was toned and her shirt bunched up into the valley of her breast, showing off each perfectly b-cup sized globes. The girl strut down the aisle with a determined look.</p><p>All the Professors on the other hand were in shock, she was the spitting image of Lily Evans. There was literally no difference in looks, except for maybe body structure, but nobody paid attention to that.</p><p>Lockhart ended up choking on his egg and Mcgonagall patted his back, not at all concerned, but not really wanting to be responsible for letting the idiot die because he couldn’t preform an adequate spell that cleared your throat. Snape on the other hand almost spit his drink out, but after he swallowed his drink, mouth dropped open of its own accord. Hagrid had happy tears running down his cheeks. Professor Flitwick fainted as well as Professor Sprout. Madame Hooch had paused all movement, a piece of bacon hovering indecisively in front of her mouth. Professor Mcgonagall was trembling with shock, even as she abandoned half-heartedly trying to help Lockhart.</p><p>"Nice to meet you, uh, Gretel. Welcome to Hogwarts" Dumbledore said with an outstretched hand that was slightly shaking. Gretel eyed his hand skeptically, but grabbed it anyways and muttered a curt 'sir'.</p><p>Tristin Tames bounced up and down next to Gretel, chattering on excitedly. Devin Crow rolled his eyes at the over exuberant girl. Dorin Detris looked at her with a confused expression.</p><p>Dumbledore cleared his throat, signaling for Mcgonagall to get up. She did, albeit a little shaky, but got up nevertheless with the sorting hat in tow. The Professor stopped in front of the stool, trying not to let her gaze wonder towards Gretel.</p><p>"Mr. Crow would you please come up and sit on the stool so I may sort you?" Mcgonagall said.</p><p>Devin grumbled in annoyance and sat down, just as the hat touched its head it yelled:</p><p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p><p>Tristin Tames got put into Hufflepuff and Dorin Detris was thrown into Gryffindor.</p><p>"Miss. Swayze" there was an eerie silence in the Hall as Gretel walked up to the stool. It was really a no-brainer she was going to get thrown in Gryffindor just like her look-a-like, Lily Evans.</p><p>Gretel's face was perfectly blank as the hat was placed on her head. It grumbled and then fell silent. Finally it started to talk to her;’<em>I can't access your thoughts, curious. This is the first time I've ever had such a problem, but I do detect two things: bravery and secrets’.</em></p><p>"SLYTHERIN!" The hat yelled, making the Professors gasp in shock and the Slytherin table to stand up quickly, clapping like maniacs.</p><p>Gretel gracefully slid off the stool, face neutral, and walked purposely towards the Slytherin table. She eased onto the bench of the Slytherin table, completely aware of all the Professors staring at her. A blond headed boy slid along the bench right up next to her and threw his arm around her. The Hall grew silent, all eyes on Gretel Swayze and the boy next to her as the blonde leaned in, planting a soft kiss on her cheek. The Hall seemed to hold their breath as they watched and waited for the red-head to kill the boy beside her. Professor Snape and Dumbledore started to walk towards the two with angry looks on their faces. The Professors halted in their walk towards their target though, as Gretel turned to face the boy that had his arm around her.</p><p>"'Ello Draco" the girl said in a husky Australian accent as she messed up his hair with her hand. Draco Malfoy beamed up at Gretel and sat on his knees to be eye level with her.</p><p>"I thought you weren't coming until 5th year?" Draco asked, arm still wrapped around her tense shoulders.</p><p>"Father thought it best to come now" she replied vaguely while grabbing a fork and placing a bit of steak delicately in her mouth. Draco furrowed his eyebrows, but knew better than to question her and tucked in with a curt nod.</p><p>The Professors meanwhile were gobsmacked, this definitely was not their Lily. Who ever this was they were for sure going to find out.</p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy was leading Gretel Swayze by the hand, showing her Hogwarts with enthusiasm as they walked towards the Dungeons. She took in all the sights of Hogwarts with a neutral expression, never once giving away any kind of emotion. Though she did accidentally run into someone, because of Draco's exuberant way of leading her around.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was a solid chest that she ran into and onyx eyes that met her green ones. The man was handsome in a ruggedly, dark way. He had shoulder-length black hair with a greasy finish, obviously the effects of spending hours bent over a simmering cauldron. He had a sharp jawline that framed plush lips. A slightly hooked nose, high-cheekbones, and sharp eyebrows. He seemed to be taking in her appearance as well. She cocked her head to the side curiously, her expression still remained blank.</p><p>The girl in front of him resembled Lily in all possible ways, though now that he was up close and studied her critically he carefully picked out slight differences.</p><p>Up close her eyes weren't a bright emerald like Lily's, instead hers were a seductive, deep forest green. That particular shade against her tanned skin was more alluring than the emerald color. Her skin was tanned, unlike Lily's pale complexion, probably because she lived where there was a lot of sun. Her soft curly red hair had more definition and depth than Lily's ever had. He was slightly uneasy at the blank way she cocked her head, she may look like Lily, but she was definitely <em>not</em> Lily.</p><p>The tall wizard in front of her cleared his throat uncomfortably and then glared at her.</p><p>"Miss Swayze next time watch where you're going" The man stated, his velvet baritone washing over her in the most erotic way, but she stayed neutral and just blinked up at him. The man cleared his throat again, to anyone else it would've sounded normal, but to an experienced person it was an awkward clearing of his throat. He was uncomfortable, maybe even nervous, how...endearing. "Here is your schedule Miss Swayze" he drawled, all awkwardness gone from his voice as he handed her a piece of parchment. "My name is Professor Snape and I am your head of house" he added cordially.</p><p>"Ah, Severus Snape. Nice to meet you" she said, her accent slightly altering her words. Severus hesitantly clasped her outstretched hand firmly, while watching her blank expression curiously. When he dropped her hand she nodded and said a curt 'goodnight Professor' before Draco led the girl away once again, hand still in hers.</p><p>She was led into the Slytherin common room. Awe was the current emotion at the forefront of her thoughts, but it never showed on her face. There was black furniture everywhere, the couches were leather and black, the tables were black with silver trimming, the fireplace was made of black slate. The walls were painted a dark green, the rugs matched the walls and contrasted greatly with the black granite tiles. The whole room was trimmed in silver, even the edges of the glass windows that revealed the Black Lake. There was a diamond chandelier on the ceiling, the ceiling itself was marble filled with silver, black, and green. There was a proud portrait of Salazar Slytherin above the fireplace and on the sides of the portrait were all the head of house Professors after Salazar Slytherin met his demise. </p><p>She walked up to the portrait and regarded the founder carefully. The founder looked at her and smirked, tossing her a wink. She winked back, but other than that nothing else happened to her features. Draco tugged on her hand impatiently.</p><p>"C'mon Spitfire" he said, as he pulled her towards the dorms. The corner of her mouth twitched upwards unnoticeably at his use of her nickname. </p><p>He led her up the stairs and veered off to the right, towards the girl's dormitory. He stopped abruptly and turned to face her, grabbing her schedule. His eyes scanned it quickly and then gave it back to her once he was satisfied and tugged on her hand again. He led her all the way to the end of the hall and stood in front of a door, it had two names on it.</p><p>G. Swayze 14</p><p>A. Wiener 14</p><p>Draco hesitantly put his hand on the knob, releasing her hand to use his other hand to cover his eyes as he walked in. This time Gretel couldn't help the smirk that graced her features, but when the door revealed her it was wiped clean off her face in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A girl with blonde tightly coiled hair, icy blue eyes, and white pasty skin sat on the edge of her bed with wide-eyes. Draco peaked out from his hand and sighed in relief when the surprised girl was just sitting on her bed and braiding her hair. Draco then turned to Gretel with a handsome smirk that would no doubt make girls fall at his feet once he got older.</p><p>"Goodbye Gretel, see you in the morning" he said, reaching for her hand and kissing the top of it before walking out of the room.</p><p>Gretel looked at the girl and the girl looked at her. Neither said anything as the red-head closed the door and walked towards the unoccupied bed, which was on the other side of the room. She pulled back the deep forest green curtains, the color of her eyes, and found her trunk sitting on the emerald satin sheets, several shades lighter than her curtains. Her pillows were a black satin, as well as her black cotton comforter that was traced in silver. Her four poster bed was an ebony wood.</p><p>"Your Gretel Swayze, right? The transfer from Australia?" A snobbish voice asked. She turned away from her admiration of the sheets and looked at the blonde.</p><p>"Yes" she replied her voice and features void of all emotion. She wanted to smirk when the girl shifted uncomfortably under her stare, but held back.</p><p>"Right. My name is Annie Wiener and I'm a fourth year, you must be one as well" the blonde stated.</p><p>"Nice to meet you, but no, I'm a third year" Gretel supplied as she turned back to her bed and started to organize her Hogwarts uniform.</p><p>"But the door says 14, your 14 right?" the girl asked, confused. Gretel raised an eyebrow as she turned around to look at Annie.</p><p>"Yes" she answered slowly, but she was going to be 14 in a month, so it didn't really matter if the girl thought she was 14 or not.</p><p>"Then why are you a third year?" Annie asked.</p><p>"Because I was born after the school year started" she explained slowly, as if talking to a child. Annie screwed up her face, her lips forming an 'o'.</p><p>"Well, uh, breakfast is at 8:00" Annie said and promptly pulled her curtains around her bed.</p><p>"Thanks" Gretel muttered and turned back to her earlier task, before walking to the shower to go shave.</p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>Gretel woke up the next morning at 5:00 am, as usual. She put on a pair of spandex shorts, a tank top, running shoes, and tied her red locks into a ponytail. She stealthily departed from her room, tip-toed down the stairs, eased through the Portrait entrance, and clung to the shadows as she made her way outside.</p><p>She started her run around the Black Lake, which was at least 3 miles. Once she was done she noticed a high cliff that jutted out over the lake, she jogged over to it and then proceeded  to climb up the rugged structure. She was sweating buckets when she reached the platform of the cliff, it was about 20 ft high. She cast a quick sound wave charm and concluded that there wasn't a rock shelf below. She walked to the edge of the platform, tugged off her tank top, kicked off her shoes, spread her arms and fell. She pulled her hands together at the last second and tucked her head between her arms, executing a flawless swan dive. From there she swam a couple laps and then swam to shore. Water cascaded down her half-naked form as she walked up the bank. She accioed her shirt, shoes, and socks. She transfigured her top into a towel and wiped the excess water from her face as she made her way back to the castle. </p><p>Gretel snuck back into her dorm effortlessly and cast a silencing charm as she transfigured a few things into weights. Today was arm day so she did 3 sets of 12. Once she was finished she transfigured everything back into its original state and made her way to the shower, she had about an hour and a half. She quickly cleaned herself, brushed her teeth, brushed her soft curls, and dabbed some lipstick on. She made her way out of the bathroom dressed in only her lacy green cheeky underwear and a matching lacy bra.</p><p>Gretel turned to see a tired looking Annie gaping at her, to which she promptly ignored. She cast a no-smudge charm on her lips and a protection charm on her hair, so it wouldn't get messed up when she put on her clothes. Grabbing the soft black skirt that had ruffles on the end, she put it on, ending just above her knee. She really wanted to gag and burn the damn thing, she hated skirts, dresses even more.</p><p>She slipped on the white button up shirt and transfigured it to fit her size, as her shoulders were broader and thicker than most girls and not to mention it clung to her breast a little to snugly. With it now fitting her size blood flowed into her shoulders and the buttons bunched in between her breast. She then pulled on her grey sweater, tied her green tie, and shrugged on her black robes. As for shoes, she was not wearing those ugly flats, so she slid on her black converse. She grabbed her gray rucksack and prepared to leave when she noticed Annie still staring at her.</p><p>"Yes?" She questioned, her face neutral. Annie shook her head and averted her eyes. Gretel shrugged and walked out. </p><p>She's got a couple stares on her way to the Great Hall, though granted everyone was just probably getting up now. She walked into the Great Hall to find all the Professors seated and staring at her. She just stared back emotionlessly and continued towards the Slytherin table. Sitting down she started to eat with perfect posture, growing up in a Pureblood family will do that to you.</p><p>Draco came into the Great Hall not long after she did and sat down next to her. He greeted her a 'good morning' with a kiss on the cheek, she replied in kind as well. Fighting valiantly to keep a neutral expression as she examined the metallic red lipstick on his pale white skin. </p><p>"So are you going to join the Quidditch team?" Draco asked. Gretel opened her mouth to answer, but a laugh tried to bubble out, so she covered it with a clearing of her throat.</p><p>"Yes actually, you?" She questioned.</p><p>"Yeah, what position do you want to play?" He asked as he popped a croissant into his mouth.</p><p>"I was thinking Seeker, you?" She answered.</p><p>"Mm... I was thinking along the lines of a Beater and a Seeker" he replied.</p><p>"Well that's good, nice to have options" she mumbled the last part darkly. Draco looked from his food to glance at her, the only emotion he was showing was a dark one. He nodded his head in understanding, his father was the same way. He never had the luxury of choices, it seems Gretel and him were in the same boat. </p><p>The rest of breakfast passed uneventful, aside from a couple inquisitive looks from some girls, lusty looks from the guys, and Annie watching her like a hawk. </p><p>Gretel and Draco left early so he could show her the transfiguration classroom. As they were walking through the halls several people, all of which, were staring at Draco.</p><p>"What are you looking at?" He finally snapped, scaring the little first year that passed. The first year shook his head and ran off. Gretel on the other hand was fighting to keep the smirk, that wanted to consume her face off. Draco looked at her suspiciously.</p><p>"You know something don't you" he stated.</p><p>"No, I don't believe so. Ah, look, we're here. Thank you Draco" she said and hurried into to the classroom shutting the heavy wooden door. Draco's 'I'm watching you', causing his threat to be slightly muffled. She turned around to see Professor Snape, an older witch in green robes, and a plump looking witch.</p><p>"Sorry am I interrupting?" She questioned with a raised eyebrow as she stepped closer to the Professors.</p><p>"Oh no, not at all dear" the plump witch said, slightly shaky.</p><p>"Well nice to meet you, though I'm sure you already know who I am, I'm Gretel Swayze" she replied with an outstretched hand. The woman slid her trembling hand into hers, her palm was clammy, she was nervous.</p><p>"I'm Professor Sprout" she answered, her voice wavered slightly as the older witch hesitantly shook her hand. The Professor dropped it rather quickly and avoided her gaze.</p><p>"You're nervous" Gretel stated and Professor Sprout's eyes widened as she looked back at her.</p><p>"I beg your pardon?" The Professor said incredulously. Gretel crossed her arms and maintained a neutral expression.</p><p>"Your palms are slightly clammy, they're also shaking, you will not meet my eyes, and your tense. You're nervous" she stated again, Professor Sprout looked at her in surprise. Gretel leaned forward in an intimidating manner and studied her face critically.</p><p>"Please tell me why I make you nervous, as a matter of fact tell me why I make all of y'all nervous. Because when I ran into Professor Snape, he was also nervous, though he did a lot better job at hiding it. Professor Dumbledore was also nervous when I shook his hand yesterday. So please tell me why I make y'all so nervous" Gretel said, eyeing Professor Sprout critically. The Professor was a shaking mess. She opened her mouth to speak, but was cut off by the sound of a bell. "How ironic 'saved by the bell'" she added sardonically and then turned to the Professor behind the desk. "And you are?" She asked. The Professor bristled.</p><p>"Professor McGonagall, Miss Swayze" She said, sternly. Gretel raised an eyebrow at the proper Professor.</p><p>"Well nice to meet you" She stated and with that, turned around and took a seat just as the other third years started flooding the classroom. Gretel pulled out a Dark Arts book, but it was in a foreign language, the Romanian language to be exact. She was taught several different languages by her father and his best friend, which she sees a lot of.</p><p>Professor McGonagall droned on and on about the transfiguration lesson. There was twenty minutes left in class and Gretel was so absorbed in her book, that she didn't even see Professor McGonagall come up behind her.</p><p>"What are you doing Miss Swayze?" McGonagall questioned, loud enough that everyone in the class turned to watch the scene unfold.</p><p>"Reading" she stated simply, her face impassive.</p><p>"And what might that be Miss Swayze?" The Professor questioned with an annoyed tone. Gretel turned a page and looked at the Professor with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>"A book" she said, slowly as if speaking to a child. She knew it was a smart ass remark, but she's very well-known as a smart ass where she's from, so why not here. McGonagall huffed at her remark.</p><p>"Would you care to explain why you are reading instead of working on the lesson" The Professor said sternly. Gretel waved her hand in dismissal and started to read her book again.</p><p>"I already know this" she stated, promptly ignoring her class mates reaction. McGonagall's nostrils flared in indignation.</p><p>"Then please show us what you know" she said, her nose stuck out in the air. She clearly expected Gretel to fail, well she had another thing coming.</p><p>Gretel took out her wand and without looking up from her book or saying a word, she waved her wand nonchalantly, barely even swishing it. The class awed when she completed her task flawlessly in a mere second without looking at the object or saying a word, when it took a whole hour for people to even get the motions right.</p><p>McGonagall was flustered at her flawless display and flared her nostrils again with her nose in the air.</p><p>"20 points to Slytherin" She grumbled and walked back to her desk just as it was time to go to the next class.</p><p>Gretel branched off towards the DADA wing, because Draco was having his first class there and she wanted to know where the Charms classroom was. She started to speed up when she heard screaming. She ran towards the room only to stop short just before the threshold when a boy ran headlong into her. She groaned slightly and the blonde boy pulled his head back to look up at her. His silver eyes blazed with relief at seeing her.</p><p>Looking around Draco she noticed Cornish Pixies flying around and assaulting everyone. Gilderoy Lockhart cowered behind his desk. She sneered at his cowardness and pulled out her wand.</p><p>"Immobulus!" She yelled and the Cornish Pixies froze in mid-air. One was frozen in a bushy-haired girl's hair, while her friends were trying to help her get it out. Another one froze while it pulled at Lockhart's nose. Rolling her eyes, Gretel banished them nonverbally to the cage on Lockhart's desk. She walked into the room, everything fixing itself in her wake. The boy that was attached to the chandelier fell and landed on a cushion charm. She stopped in front of the Professor's desk with a raised eyebrow. Lockhart righted himself and leaned against his desk, putting on his version of a charming smile. She honestly couldn't figure out why he was the most sought after wizard, aside for Lucius Malfoy, in the wizarding world.</p><p>"Miss Swayze" he greeted, flipping his fake blonde hair. She raised an eyebrow at him, which made him squirm.</p><p>"Professor Lockhart, sorry to interrupt, but I couldn't help but notice your incompetence when it comes to this particular subject" she said and Lockhart swallowed.</p><p>"This is actually my best subject, a student just thought it fun to let all the little devils loose and when they did the nasty little things snapped my wand" he defended.</p><p>"Well it's a good thing I stumbled upon your classroom, we wouldn't want our favorite Professor to get brutally assaulted by these vicious creatures" she said sarcastically. Lockhart walked towards her and stopped right in front of her.</p><p>"Really? I'm your favorite Professor?" Lockhart asked, trying to sound seductive, but failing miserably, at least to her. The rest of the girls in his class were practically swooning.</p><p>"Most definitely" she replied sarcastically and even gave a sarcastic eye roll for good measure. "If you'll excuse me I'll be getting these to Hagrid" she stated and levitated the cage to float behind her. Lockhart smiled and flipped his hair.</p><p>"Well if you ever need any help from your favorite Professor, let me know" he said with a wink. "Oh and 40 points to Slytherin!" He yelled to the class as Gretel made her exit with Draco following close behind. On her way out the cage 'accidentally' bumped into Lockhart's head rather hard.</p><p>"Sorry" she called, but she really sounded like a bitch instead.</p><p>Oh well.</p><p>She vaguely heard someone say 'what a woman' and 'even though she's mean you have to admit, she's got style'.</p>
