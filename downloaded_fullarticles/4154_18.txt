          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was early in the morning; they were in a packed room. Draco Malfoy stared at Harry Potter across the same room, eyes shining, breathless... "Merlin, he's beautiful," he whispered to Pansy Parkinson, an old friend who stood next to him. </p><p>"Oh no, here we go.." Pansy muttered and she rolled her eyes, though fondly of course. To be fair they'd been friends for a long time. She was used to all of this. "How about you go tell him that then?"</p><p>"What?" Draco's eyes widened as it that was a terrible idea, like the worst idea he had ever heard... "But he'll think I like him!"</p><p>He couldn't keep his eyes off of him to look at Pansy for very long though. That pretty much just proved his point. </p><p>Pansy rolled her eyes again. She smirked. But it was a real smile. </p><p>"...it's your wedding day, I think it's already implied."</p><p>Draco blushed. But damn, she was right. This was the best day ever.</p></div>
