    <p>
  <span>A loud bang travels through the night, the responsible teenager is shaking as he throws his phone as far as he can. Stupid, cracked piece of shit, it got completely busted when he got teleported to what-the-fuck land. The sack of shit phone wouldn’t even turn on. Katsuki Bakugo is positive that this isn’t any place that he knows of, much less somewhere in Japan if it was some place in Japan you could color him surprised. The forest is thick, much thicker than he would have liked. Breathing heavily, he sits down in front of a tree, reflecting on what had happened to make him teleport. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The heavy scent of smoke fills the air, clinging to every crack and crevice of where Katsuki and the villain had fought. The villain had been arrested, and now Katsuki was helping out with the clean up. Looking for anyone that they missed, that wasn’t able to get out of the premise of the fight. The battle, for the record, did stretch farther than anticipated. So there were a few injuries among the civilians, however there were no casualties. Not yet at least, and for that Katsuki was rather grateful. He was just glad that he wouldn’t be paying for the damages. He was doing one of U.A.’s internships after all, and therefore, no money for repairs came out of his pocket. Bakugo prowls through the rubble, his eyes peeled, trying to spot anyone that had been missed. That’s when he sees her, a little further a head to his left. She looked to be about middle aged and she had a chunk of building on her chest, that she was struggling to get off. Katsuki, being the hero he is, strides to her, lifting the rubble off of her chest. Well… more of blasting it away and being careful that he didn’t hit her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She gasps for air, as if she was a fish in water for the first time. Slowly after she catches her breath she looks over at Katsuki, and a battered smile graces her face. She peers through her eyelashes up at him, it’s almost as if she’s trying to flirt with him. Her fingers stretch out as she reaches to touch him. Bakugou does come closer, if anything it’s to try and pick her up and get her to safety.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ground Zero the hero…” She smiles lazily, her voice coming out as airy, her fingers brush his chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re perfect.” She breathes out, as if it’s sapping all of her energy to just talk, her palms up against the middle of his chest now. Katsuki starts standing up with her, when his head starts ringing, pounding, as if there is over a hundred fists breaking their way out of his skull. His body shortly follows, he feels like he’s on fire. He drops the woman, he hears her breathy laugh as she hits the ground. Lava is licking up and down his arms, lowering his hands he lets out a few pops. He can’t see them, and panic is hitting him hard. Katsuki stumbles and falls on his ass, which is when he feels like he slipped through the ground, melted through the cracks in the road. Into the center of the earth and farther, he was falling. Then he wasn’t, and he got shot straight into the trunk of a tree, Katsuki passes out almost instantly on impact.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which leads him to the predicament he finds himself in now. Katsuki after arising from the knock-out had tried to find his way out of this dreadful forest only to be ever more lost. So he tried his phone, which decided that it would give up on him and break, without even turning on the screen. That got him pissed off even more than being lost did, so naturally he threw the phone as hard as he could the stupid thing flew pretty far with the helping hand of his quirk. It isn’t long after the momentary reflection that Bakugou hears hoofs, and someones rather hefty footsteps running straight at where he is sitting. Shit. Well maybe he’s not completely fucked, after all Katsuki could take this opportunity to ask whoever-the-fuck where he is. Katsuki gets to his feet and rounds around the tree, coming face-to-face with someone who looked remarkably like what he assumed Pony would if she had more horse in her. Katsuki’s eyes shift over the group, and finally settle on a man who’s breathing rather heavily. He’s fucking ginormous, with tangled black hair that covers most of his face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here's the student, Hagrid. You’d do well to keep them from blowing up the forest.” The horsey weirdo says, turning his entire horse body. Katsuki grinds his teeth, it’s not like he isn’t a student, but he sure as hell wasn’t one of this guy's students. His palms pop and crackle with small explosions. Bakugou represses his anger- it was something that he had been working on with Kirishima. Kirishima had said that nobody liked a hero with such a volatile temper and they should work on it. So they had, for a while, and Bakugou did get better at repressing his simmering rage.<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The giant comes closer to Bakugou, in his hands is a crossbow. How fucking medival could you get? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Firenze. I’ll take him up to Dumbledore and get this sorted out.” The giant states, it’s either he’s just fucking giant or he has a weak version of something like Mt. Lady’s quirk. Katsuki stays quiet for a bit, they are talking in English that much he knew, so he wasn’t in Japan anymore. At least that was cleared up, Katsuki muses. The giant quirk dude places a hand on Katsuki’s shoulder. Katsuki tenses when the hand comes down onto his shoulder, suddenly drawing up the question on how he understood what they were saying his understanding of the English language was rudimentary at best. He wasn’t a fucking genius at language like Kaminari. Impulsively Bakugou decides to test something out, how well can he speak English, than?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How about fuck no.” Bakugou barks out, startling both the fucking horse man and the weak Mt. Lady quirk guy. Katsuki looks at the giant dude and scowls. “I have a much better fucking plan. How about you get me back to U.A. and I wont blow your giant fucking ass to hell and back.” He says this waspishly but is quite impressed by the amount of words that are coming out of his mouth that are </span>
  <em>
    <span>English.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Even if he has a noticeable accent, his words are definitely </span>
  <em>
    <span>English.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The man looks taken aback, the horse guy has already left at this point. “I don’t know what you're talking about.” After a moment Bakugou opens his mouth again only to get cut off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I reckon, this is best taken up with Dumbledore.” He seems to be muttering to himself more than he is talking to Bakugou. Bakugou stands resilient when the guy tries to give him a nudge, back as rigid as a rod, Bakugou holds his ground. His hands are curled into fists, Bakugou focuses on flexing his fingers out and </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> setting off any explosions, even if his anger is at a all time cap.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The giant nudges a little bit harder, but Katsuki refuses to submit. After all, submitting would be accepting defeat, it would be a show of weakness, and Katsuki wasn’t about to let him have it. The giant for the record, does in fact, seem quite surprised that Katsuki hasn’t budged. A small pop can be heard in the dead silence, Katsuki tries reeling in his anger. He spectacularly fails, of fucking course, when the giant gives him a shove, hard enough to make Katsuki’s knees buckle, and that was quite the feat, concidering the sheer power of blasts that he was used to giving off. The fucking giant- who he had yet to get a name to (although Bakugou is playing around with the name Blackbeard, before quickly dissmissing it as being too cool for a looser like this)- The fucker during Bakugou’s moment of weakness decides to </span>
  <em>
    <span>drag</span>
  </em>
  <span> him off, out of the forrest. Which- in part- Katsuki is quite grateful for, he wasn’t sure that he would have been able to find the way out by himself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But when he sees the bitch of a castle, Katsuki is seriously debating if he is hallucinating. Is it just him- seeing things- or are all of the other teens here in robes, and seemingly color-coded. They are giving Bakugou some odd looks. He snarls at a group clad in yellow and they back away quite quickly for people who seemed to be the bravest, actually walking up to the giant to see what’s up with him. With the minor distraction though, Katsuki did manage to righten himself, because, as  you should very well know, standing on your own feet was fine and fucking dandy because he could walk. On his own feet. It’s not like he was hit with Midnight’s quirk and fell asleep for an hour or two. Katsuki glances around as another group stops the fucking giant, although these people look older, the woman in the front looks like his grandmothers age. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looks pointedly at him, although what she had said was lost on him. He had tuned her the fuck out more focused on trying to figure out what this place even was. Her mouth thins and Katsuki finally breaks in his good boy facade. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck do you want you old hag?” Bakugou snaps at her before she even has the chance at opening her mouth again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What house are you in?” She says in a sort of demanding voice. One that you would expect a disobedient toddler to get.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What fucking house? Why, I don’t recall </span>
  <em>
    <span>anyone</span>
  </em>
  <span> needing that information,” Katsuki replies haughtily. “Unless, you are, of course a fucking pervert.” Bakugou continues not necessarily paying attention to his surroundings as much as before, completely focused on the woman. She was in a scarlet robe. “Met plenty of those who wanted my address.” He mutters almost as an afterthought. That fucking after thought was finally in fucking Japanese. It was like a weight was lifted off his shoulders, he could still fucking speak Japanese. It was like a blessing, a way to cuss out these fuckasses without them getting a whiff of what he was saying. And so he did, especially at the absolute banshee that was clad in a that ugly red bathrobe, that followed the giant- who was back to forcing Katsuki to walk- all the way to a stone gargoyle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“What the fucks this supposed to do?” Katsuki sneers, only for the woman to briskly ignore him and say in a very strained sort of voice; “Lemon Tarts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lemon Tarts? What was that supposed to do? Open a portal? Katsuki was quite taken aback when the gargoyle spoke. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Correct.” He said it in this gravelly sort of voice, as if one ate too many rocks. The gargoyle then jumps aside, letting them into a staircase. Which Bakugou adamantly is refusing to go up, until the giant sweeps him up into his arms. Although Bakugou will never admit it, he let out a small undignified shriek at. Then he snarled again, baring his teeth, hands popping as if the explosion of a lifetime is waiting, just waiting to get released. It was taking a lot out of Bakugou to hold back, he didn’t know who he was being taken to nor what quirk the woman had. He started trying to look at things logically, it made the  most sense to hold back. To let things happen, figure it out and report it to the nearest hero, in this damnable con. It seemed however, to be a convention made up of purely people either; one, lusting after the same hero, or two, they are all purely into the same shit. Maybe it’s a uniform the cloaks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>God, where did he end up?</span>
