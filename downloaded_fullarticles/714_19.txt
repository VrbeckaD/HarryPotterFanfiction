    <p>“I know this is hard for you,” said her mother, rather anxiously.</p>
<p>Y/N just opened up one of the many suitcases sprinkled around her new room with her lips pursed and didn’t say anything. She had picked the room with the least amount of cobwebs and the most modern furniture. One couldn’t say it wasn’t spacious, at least.</p>
<p>“I just couldn’t do it anymore,” continued her mother, sounding strained. “Everywhere I went, he was there. And the way people looked at me…”</p>
<p>“You’ve already told me this,” said Y/N, a little sharper than intended. But she had heard it already. She’d heard all about the looks of pity whenever her mother went to the supermarket. She’d heard all about how those looks of pity would immediately turn awkward and how their eyes would dart away when they saw her mother looking, clearly unwilling to talk.</p>
<p>What can you say to the town widow whose husband died in a sudden and tragic accident? And did her mother honestly think it had been so much better for her at school?</p>
<p>She’d always been a little strange back home. The quiet outsider that read books at lunch and sat alone, and mumbled when she had to speak to people. She hadn’t been <em>disliked</em>, exactly, and thankfully she hadn’t been bullied, either. Eyes had just slid right over her, which was fine with her.</p>
<p>But when her father had died, the eyes had suddenly been on her all the time. People whispered behind their hands. Such was life in a small town.</p>
<p>But at least the other teenagers there had known her for years. They could at least have some sympathy for the girl that they had grown up with, even if they thought she was a bit odd. Here she was just in another small town, as a senior no less, and she’d be the stranger all over again. She’d have to find her role in this new place, and she had a terrible feeling that it would be a worse role than the one in her hometown. She hoped not, but it wasn’t a high hope.</p>
<p>Her hopes hadn’t been very high for the past few months anyway.</p>
<p>“This school has more offerings for different art classes,” her mother went on hopefully.</p>
<p>Y/N just strode over to the dresser in the room and opened it. It was full of cobwebs, and she frowned at them. “Could you hand me the feather duster?” she sighed, turning to face her mother, who was perched on the bed, and holding out an impatient hand. Her mother complied immediately, and Y/N turned with the duster in hand and began systematically sweeping it out so she could hang up her clothes. She hoped it wouldn’t make them smell like mildew. </p>
<p>It was silent for a while, but when Y/N began hanging up her shirts, one by one, her mother spoke again. “I was going to go out and try to find a furniture store,” she said. “Get you a nice bookshelf for the room. Do you want to come?”</p>
<p>The truth was, Y/N wanted to be alone. </p>
<p>For months, all she had wanted was to be alone. </p>
<p>Even finding a beautiful wooden home for all of her precious books was not enough appeal to go into the town, smile, introduce herself to people, or to listen to her mother’s attempts to make up for the fact that she had uprooted their entire lives and brought them to this old, dreary mansion.</p>
<p>“Not really,” she said honestly, though not unkindly, turning to her mother again. </p>
<p>Y/N saw her mother’s eyes flash with hurt, but she was able to stifle it quickly. She just got to her feet and walked over to kiss her daughter on the forehead. “I’ll pick one out for you?”</p>
<p>“I’d like that.” Y/N gave her a small smile to help assuage the guilt that she always felt after she knew that she was too impatient or dismissive in conversations with her mother. She always tried to remind herself that her mother was suffering, too.</p>
<p>Her mother’s answering smile was radiant. “I’ll be back in a few hours, then.” She gave Y/N a tight hug, and then she disappeared into the hallway. With a little sigh, Y/N turned back and began hanging up shirts again, going slowly back and forth between the suitcase and the dresser.</p>
<p>It happened about five minutes later, when she picked up one of her favorite shirts.</p>
<p>She felt the hard edges of the picture frame wrapped up in the soft material, and she remembered that she had tucked it here for safekeeping during the move. Her favorite picture of him. She unwrapped the shirt sleeves and pulled it out, and it was shocking just how painful it was to see it. Even expecting it, the ache in her chest made it difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>“Handsome man,” a voice drawled from behind her. “Who might that be?”</p>
<p>She almost dropped the picture. Instead, she managed to cling to it and whirled around with it clutched to her chest. Upon seeing the blonde-haired boy in her bedroom, she let out a loud, shrill scream and stumbled backward in a blind panic, her back slamming hard into the wall.</p>
<p>The boy seemed incredibly unbothered by her reaction. He just smirked and folded his arms, his eyes sweeping over her with something undeniably like raging curiosity. “Oh yes, get it all out,” he said, sounding incredibly amused.</p>
<p>She was hardly coherent. “What are you – I don’t – <em>how did you get into my room!</em>?” she shrieked, wondering if she should scream again. With her mother gone, however, it wouldn’t do much good. The grounds for this mansion were huge, too, and no one would hear her. She didn’t even know where her closest neighbor was. Fear shot into her throat.</p>
<p>“The same way I get everywhere,” he answered, giving her another smirk.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” she demanded, trying to sound fierce even though her voice was shaking. “How did you get into my house?”</p>
<p>“Well technically, it’s <em>my</em> house,” he said, grinning. His eyes darted around with great interest. “And it seems you have decent taste, at least, because you’ve also picked my old room.”</p>
<p>“What are you – I don’t – ” She could hardly think straight. It didn’t seem like this boy was going to attack her, because he was still holding his ground on the far side of the room, but one could never be too careful. And what the hell did he mean, his old room? “I don’t understand,” she said finally.</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes. “Isn’t it obvious? Look at me. <em>Really</em> look.”</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes at him, wondering if this was some sort of trap. Still, he didn’t move closer to her, so she took two tentative steps forward and peered hard at him in the dim afternoon light falling into the room from the dusty window. </p>
<p>He was about her age. Handsome, too, with very pale skin and piercing gray eyes and white-blonde hair that was carefully mussed. He was so impeccably dressed that it was almost disconcerting, and it made her self-conscious about her ratty moving day clothes. And then she saw it – the fear and adrenaline had made it easy to miss before: he wasn’t solid. </p>
<p>The edges of his body were blurry, and he was slightly brighter than a normal human should be. What was more, his feet didn’t touch the ground.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help it. She screamed again, backing up once more to be as close as possible to the wall. “B-but – are you – you can’t be a – ”</p>
<p>“Ghost?” He rose an eyebrow. “I can, actually. Because, you see, I’m dead.”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“You’re looking at me, aren’t you? So it’s obviously not,” he replied, his mouth quirking up to the side.</p>
<p>“I’m dreaming,” she said immediately, shaking her head furiously like she was trying to get water out of her ears. “This is all a bad dream. Maybe I’ll wake up back in my real bed, in my real home.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you were so mean to your poor mother?” he asked. “So she decided to move, and you’re angry about it?” He gave her a wicked smile.</p>
<p>“I – ” she sputtered angrily, unsure which complaint to start with first. And then she decided on the most pressing one. “How did you hear that conversation? Were you – were you <em>here</em>?”</p>
<p>He chuckled, arched an eyebrow, and as an answer, he faded away right before her eyes. Nervously she stepped forward, her eyes sweeping around the room, expecting to see him moving, or a faint shimmer, or <em>something</em>, but there was nothing. He had gone completely invisible.</p>
<p><em>Or maybe</em>, she thought hopefully, <em>maybe he hadn’t really been there at all</em>. </p>
<p>Maybe he had been a figment of her lonely imagination. She had never really <em>hoped</em> to see things like a crazy person, but as it was…</p>
<p>“Boo,” breathed his voice behind her.</p>
<p>She jumped about a foot from the ground, letting out another terrified screech and whirling around while staggering backward at the same time. At first she still didn’t see anything, and she only heard his soft laughter. And then, slowly, he came fading into her vision again, getting more and more solid until he looked almost like a normal human again, only with the strange brightness and soft edges.</p>
<p>“Jumpy, are we?” he asked, snickering.</p>
<p>“You’re being mean,” she hissed, glaring at him.</p>
<p>“Yes well,” he continued, rolling his eyes and then smiling rather triumphantly, “Seeing as you’re so jittery, let’s make sure you don’t harm that thing, hmm?” He gestured to the frame she was still clutching in her hands. “Wouldn’t want it to break and have you blaming me or my ghostliness.” He snapped his fingers – it didn’t make a normal snapping sound, but instead it was much more like a faint wisp of air, like a light rustle of wind – and she let out a squeak of shock when the picture frame went flying from her hands. She didn’t even have time to protest before it went zooming across the room and lowered very slowly to land with an incredibly soft thump on her bed.</p>
<p>She just stared at it for a long time and then moved her eyes to him. “What else can you do?” she whispered, slightly awestruck now. The fear was still there, but it was fading. She figured that if he wanted to truly hurt her by now, he probably would have already.</p>
<p>A slow, smug smile spread over his face. It occurred to her, suddenly, that he was very much enjoying this.</p>
<p>He just snapped his fingers again, and every object in the room rose a few feet from the ground, hovering there in the air. She gazed around in awe, until she looked down and realized that she was also no longer on the ground. She didn’t scream this time, thankfully, but she felt her stomach drop at the strange sensation of seeing her feet not coming into contact with anything solid, and when she spoke her voice was much higher than usual. </p>
<p>“<em>Hey</em>! Hey, Mr. Ghost, put me down!”</p>
<p>“<em>Mr. Ghost</em>?” He was laughing when he snapped his fingers again, and slowly everything, including her, drifted down and settled easily on the floor again. “I have a name, you know.”</p>
<p>“Well you haven’t told it to me,” she said, a little miffed as she brushed herself off and stared hard at her feet for a long moment before deciding that they seemed to be working normally and attached to the ground again. She looked up at him to see that he was drifting a little closer, looking amused again. “And besides, it’s not like I’m familiar with how to address a ghost,” she continued uncertainly. “It’s not exactly an everyday occurrence for me.”</p>
<p>His eyes were scanning her face eagerly. “What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t hear that detail eavesdropping?” she asked dryly.</p>
<p>“No.” He was smirking again.</p>
<p>“Y/N,” she answered. Her edges dragged over the edges of his body again, the blurs of him, how bright he was compared to her, feeling suddenly very strange about this entire thing. “What’s yours?”</p>
<p>“Draco,” he replied. “Draco Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard that name before,” she said thoughtfully. “You must be old.”</p>
<p>He grinned and rolled his eyes. “Dead people don’t <em>have</em> ages, but if you want to get technical, I’m the same age as when I died. If you’re asking whether I was <em>alive</em> a long time ago, it’s sort of true, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“How long?” she asked curiously. “And how old were you when you…”</p>
<p>“Died? Nineteen. How long ago?” He floated up suddenly into the air, flipping so that he was lying horizontally, as if on a bed, and stared at the ceiling with a thoughtful little frown. He didn’t even seem to realize he had done it, but for Y/N it was positively astounding, and she gaped at him with her mouth slightly open. “Don’t know,” he murmured finally. “A hundred years, maybe?”</p>
<p>“You can’t remember?” For some reason, this made her sad.</p>
<p>He slowly floated down to hover in front of her again, as if he were standing upright – except, of course, for that minor detail that his feet didn’t touch the floor. His eyes were scanning her face carefully. “Life tends to get blurrier and blurrier the longer you’re dead,” he answered finally.</p>
<p>“And…you’ve been alone here this whole time?” she asked, frowning.</p>
<p>Something flashed in his eyes, but he just shrugged. “There used to be a caretaker that came by every week that I thoroughly enjoyed haunting,” he said, giving Y/N a very mischievous smile. “It had gotten to the point where I’d hover things and he’d just pretend not to see, though, so he was getting boring. <em>You</em> are much more interesting.” The light in his eyes had gotten more intense, and for a moment he seemed to glow even brighter.</p>
<p>“And my mother says <em>I’m</em> too antisocial,” she muttered.</p>
<p>“Bookworm, as I hear it,” he drawled. He was trying to sound casual, but wasn’t quite managing it. Her heart suddenly contorted in her chest for this strange, lonely boy, and she realized that she was no longer afraid in the slightest. In fact – and this was the concerning part, probably – this conversation was the most natural one she had ever had with anyone her own age. Never mind that he was a ghost, which she still didn’t want to think about too deeply at the moment. “Artist, too?” he continued, slowly floating a little higher.</p>
<p>“The first one, yes,” she said. “The second one, only somewhat. But it’s quite rude of you to listen in on conversations, you know.”</p>
<p>“I was curious,” he said, shrugging and not looking the least bit ashamed. “Can you blame me? People are coming to live in my home for the first time in…years. I don’t know how many, but it’s quite a few.”</p>
<p>She hesitated and then crossed the room to sit tentatively on her bed, still watching him carefully. His eyes followed her movement, but he remained where he was. “So…” She began tentatively. “So you can…manipulate objects and fly and…things. Is there something you can’t do, Draco?”</p>
<p>His eyes widened and his face twisted a little when she said his name, but it smoothed out quickly to something more expressionless. But she had seen it, and it made her wonder how long it had been since someone had addressed him directly and personally. Slowly, he floated upward and moved over toward the bed, settling in beside her as if he were sitting. Of course, no part of him touched the bed, and she just stared. It wasn’t <em>disquieting</em>, exactly, the way that he moved, but it would take some getting used to. </p>
<p>He raised his right hand, palm out. An invitation.</p>
<p>“Touch,” he answered softly.</p>
<p>She reached out her hand, too, and tried to make contact with his skin, holding her breath. She went right through him and felt a deep chill run through her bones, even though it was the middle of June. He saw her shiver, and he withdrew his hand, watching her with a slight frown.</p>
<p>“Do you miss it?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Sometimes,” he admitted quietly.</p>
<p>And then, very abruptly, he was zooming backward, soaring high in the air with a grin on his face. “So? Want a tour of Malfoy Manor?”</p>
<p>“Only if I get to walk,” she said, getting to her feet and giving him a tentative smile and deciding not to analyze what was going on too deeply yet. “No surprises.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” he replied, smirking.</p>
