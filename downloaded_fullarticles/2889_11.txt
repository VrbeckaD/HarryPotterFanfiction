  <strong>Chapter One</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MC was walking down the corridor, enjoying the always sunny weather, and thinking about the latest challenge Madam Rakepick prepared. But you have to admit, putting Snape's pants on fire was a good prank. Happy thoughts are interrupted quite quickly, when MC rans straight into Ismelda, and she drops her books on the floor.</p>
<p>- Are you blind or something ? Or do you want to end your life, right now ?<br/> - I'm sorry Ismelda, I didn’t mean to ...<br/> - I guess I have to teach you a lesson.</p>
<p>A second later MC discovers that Ismelda holds a wand pointed directly at the throat, and looks straight into the eyes. But those weren’t the usual eyes of hatred and lust for blood. Those eyes looked like ... she was crying recently.</p>
<p>- Ismelda, did you ... cry ?<br/> - I'm warning you, it’s been 3 days since I cursed anyone with Cruciatus ...<br/> - But it’s okay, you can tell me ...<br/> - Tell you what ? Do you really want to mess with me ? Do you really like pain that much ?</p>
<p>MC was struggling, but it was another time when bravery (or maybe stupidity) won with the voice of reason. And so MC said:</p>
<p>- Okay, you know what ? Do it ! Kill me ! Let’s end this, so I won’t ever find my brother, and never finish the school. DO IT IF YOU WANT THIS SO BAD !</p>
<p>Ismelda was prepared to cast the curse, and her face was covered with the usual evil grin.</p>
<p>- Cru...</p>
<p>But then something weird had happened. She dropped the wand at the ground, and the grin disappeared. MC was quite shocked, but tried to play along.</p>
<p>- What's the matter Ismelda ? Got no guts to hurt me ?<br/> - Leave me alone ... I don’t have time for pawns like you ... Dark Lord would give me better targets in the future ...<br/> - You really don’t want a good warm-up with me ?<br/> - I want... No ! I don’t want to have anything common with you ! I HATE YOU !</p>
<p>After those words Ismelda took her books and wand from the ground, and ran into the common room. At first MC wanted to celebrate another victory, but ... something was not right. The deep look into her eyes uncovered that she does indeed have a sensitive side. She was surely crying that day. But why ? What had happened to make her cry ? And what's more - what made her show mercy ?</p>
<p>MC suddenly thought about Ismelda the whole day. Friends presence didn’t help much, as MC was daydreaming the whole time. Even usually calm professor Flitwick was quite angry at MC for not paying attention. During the usual big-ass sandwich meal with Penny, MC was also in the different world. Penny began wondering, what’s up with MC today ? Not acting like usual self. She decided to cheer up her friend, and grabbed the hand, but MC quickly hid it, and left the table with unfinished meal. Penny was puzzled.</p>
<p>- What is it MC ? Something's happened ? You act strangely today.<br/> - It's nothing ... Really nothing. I'm just ... Worrying about the Beatrice, that’s all. I'm sorry, I gotta go now...</p>
<p>MC left, and Penny stayed at the Great Hall alone looking at the nearly full plate. She was happy that MC worries about her sister ... But deep in her heart, she still thought, that it’s not the case.</p>
<p>MC wanted to catch some fresh air, so went outside, to chill in the sun. But arriving at the plaza, MC saw the most beautiful view in the whole life. Ismelda was sitting nearby the fountain, reading the book carefully, with a gentle smile. It wasn’t her usual evil grin, rather something very delicate, and unfitting her. MC looked at her more and more, and suddenly discovered how beautiful she is. A bit mysterious, but intriguing at the same time. Her pale skin reminded of the ladies from the 19th century paintings. And again, her eyes weren’t filled with the usual hatred, nor with sadness. This time MC could see the joy of dreaming about something. MC thought quickly, yeah, this is probably some book about how to kill the muggle, or something like that ... But it didn’t looked like it. MC decided to approach Ismelda, and quickly read the title "Romances in medieval". What was that supposed to mean? Unfortunately Ismelda saw MC, and quickly closed the book.</p>
<p>- What do you want, you scum ?<br/> - I ... I never knew you like to study here, at the fresh air...<br/> - I always study here. I was there also when you and that Rakepick woman decided to burn professor Snape alive. Shame you didn’t succeeded.<br/> - But... I didn’t know. And what about that book ? I though you are not interested in anything other than death and vain...<br/> - I... It’s not like... Oh stop it, you idiot ! This is for the History of Magic O.W.L. and you should study too, if you don’t want to stay in that damn school forever !<br/> - Okay, I was just curious. No need to shout at me.<br/> - LEAVE ME ALONE MC !</p>
<p>And so MC decided to go away, but noticed one more thing at the end of their conversation. Ismelda actually had blushes, when talking about the book ! Everybody always thought that she would be pale her whole life, but this time was different. Like she really did felt weird...</p>
<p>Suddenly daydreaming MC crashed into something, and almost broke the nose. At first thought it was a wall, but actually it was Hagrid's butt.</p>
<p>- MC ! EVERYTHIN' OKAY ? I SORRY, MIGHT'VE NOT SEEN YEH COMIN' ...<br/> - Ah, no Hagrid its ok, I'm sorry. It’s me who did not saw you coming ...<br/> - GOOD JOKE MC, I CAN' WAIT TILL I TELL 'HIS ONE TO T'DUMBLEDORE ! SOMEBODY'VENT NOTICED MEH HAHAHAHA ...</p>
<p>MC quickly decided to run away before Hagrid got too excited, but the problem was real. All the day long MC was thinking only about Ismelda, the girl that wished most of the people their death. What was so appealing in her ? Returning back to the common room, MC met Rowan, being excited about incoming O.W.L.s.</p>
<p>- Heey MC ! Cheer up, it’s almost O.W.L.s time !<br/> - Yaay ...<br/> - Oh, come on ! O.W.L.s can be fun too ! Just think about the very long essay to write. You will have a chance to express yourself ... On the paper of course.<br/> - Express myself... Maybe that's what I should do. Rowan do you think that...<br/> - Shh, don’t move. <br/> - What is it ?<br/> - Somebody is watching you ...</p>
<p>MC turned away quickly, and saw a glimpse of a girl looking from behind suit of armour, before she hid herself. MC had no doubt it was Ismelda. Rowan saw her too and became angry.</p>
<p>- Why is she following you ? Is she up to something bad ? I bet she is ! Just wait, I will teach her ...<br/> - Wait, no !<br/> - What’s the matter MC ?</p>
<p>And yeah, MC realised that just had stopped Rowan from uncovering Ismelda. Why do such a thing ?</p>
<p>- Well, you know ... It’s probably nothing. Just another errand for Merula, that’s probably it.<br/> - Ah, yeah, you are right ! After all its Merula, who likes to pull the strings ! Let’s leave her be... By the way, what did you wanted to ask me ?<br/> - Oh it was ... nothing. Really nothing. Come on, let’s go to the common room.</p>
<p>MC and Rowan entered the common room. Ismelda left her hideout, with a curious look towards the dormitory. She seemed to be puzzled as well. She didn’t knew back then, that soon her big secret would be revealed - to the person she never even thought would be ...</p>
