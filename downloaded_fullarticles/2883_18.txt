    <p align="justify">Remus Lupin isn’t exactly a very extroverted person. Which means, he’s not ecstatic about the fact that he’s the new Global Education tutor. He’s not new to the job, he tutored a handful of kids in high school, but that doesn’t mean the boy is any less anxious.</p><p>His professor approached him at the end of last term and asked him if he would consider being a tutor for his subject, seeing that he got the best grade in the whole class. Now, you’ve got to understand that Remus Lupin has a hard time saying ‘no’ to people. In his mind, he’s just going to upset that person, and Remus does not deal well with confrontation. So naturally, he agreed.</p><p>The blond boy just finished moving in to his new living quarters. He’s a proud tenant of a one bedroom apartment just a couple blocks away from campus. The place is mostly filled with books everywhere, but Remus likes it that way.</p><p>His first student agreed to meet up with him at a café not too far away from the school. Remus decided to walk and enjoy the nice weather. He still has a grey sweater on though, just in case it gets too windy on the way there.</p><p>The café is not too crowded, which makes the blond boy happy. Dealing with large numbers of people makes him a little stressed sometimes. He looks around in search of a good spot to sit at and decides to go for a table near a window. He places his book bag on the floor and gets his phone out.</p><p>Remus doesn’t really know how he’s going to recognize this kid. The only thing he knows is that the guy’s name is Sirius Black, which sounds a bit funny, but who is he to judge with a name like Remus Lupin. In any case, he’s hoping this dude happens to know what he looks like.</p><p>His phone is telling him that it’s currently 3:10pm, which means that his student is 10 minutes late. Remus is trying very hard not to judge the guy already. He is seriously thinking about complaining to Lily about it over text.</p><p>“Remus Lupin?”</p><p>A voice asks from somewhere on his left. He looks over his shoulder in search of the owner of the voice. A boy with shoulder length dark hair, a black leather jacket, and black boots is standing next to his table. Remus gets up in order to greet him.</p><p>“Yes. Are you Sirius?” He tries to ask in a cheerful tone.</p><p>“The one and only.”</p><p>Remus smiles at the guy and offers him a hand. The dark haired boy shakes it for a second, then proceeds to sit down on the opposite chair. Remus notices he seems annoyed. Sirius smells like cigarettes, which makes him nervous. He checks the front pocket of his bag and makes sure his inhaler is in there. Cigarettes can easily trigger an asthma attack and no one is looking forward to that.</p><p>“Is there anything in specific that you would like me to go over with you?”</p><p>Remus asks, grabbing the Global Education textbook he brought along. Sirius runs a hand through his hair and Remus could’ve sworn he saw the boy roll his eyes.</p><p>“Oh I don’t know. Maybe just everything that stupid professor has ever taught in that stupid class.”</p><p>Sirius stares at him with a defiant expression. Remus blinks his eyes a few times, taken back by the boy’s sudden reaction.</p><p>“Ok, you’re not a fan of the subject then…” He says, avoiding the boy’s eyes.</p><p>Sirius lets out an ironic laugh.</p><p>“Yeah, I guess you could say that.”</p><p>Remus continues to ignore Sirius eyes and proceeds to open the book in front of him.</p><p>“I’ll just start from the very beginning then.” The blond boy says, mostly to himself.</p><p>He takes Sirius lack of response as an agreement. Remus then begins to talk about the very first chapter in the book. Seeing that classes started only a few weeks ago, he can’t imagined the professor is too far ahead.</p><p>Sirius still seems annoyed, but ends up reaching for a notebook and actually taking some notes, which surprises the blond boy in a good way. Remus tries to brush off the fact that his student seems to be in such a bad mood and continues to explain everything patiently.</p><p>When they reach the end of the first chapter, Remus starts to think that maybe Sirius won’t be that hard to handle. He’s just moody and hates the subject, Remus can deal with that. But as the boy begins to explain the subject further, Sirius seems to get more and more upset.</p><p>It starts with sighs whenever Remus is done explaining something. Then he added the eye rolling and Remus began to get annoyed.</p><p>“Look, no one is forcing you to be here dude.”</p><p>Remus says, closing the book in front of them. Sirius lets out an ironic laugh and stares at him for a couple of seconds. Remus breaks eye contact and looks down.</p><p>“Except they are. I failed the first test, the college requires me to see a tutor.”</p><p>Remus didn’t know that. Sirius runs a hand through his ridiculously handsome hair and rests his arm on the table.</p><p>“Well, I’m sorry you seem to hate that so much. But I mean, they’re literally just trying to help you.”</p><p>Remus says, frowning his eyebrows and getting even more annoyed. What is wrong with this guy anyway? Remus is just trying to do his job.</p><p>“Yeah whatever, I can’t learn this stupid subject anyway.” Sirius rolls his eyes and proceeds to put his notebook back in his backpack.</p><p>“Wait, where are you going?”</p><p>Remus asks, sounding confused and a bit irritated.</p><p>“Look, we’re just wasting our time here. I’m clearly not going to improve. So, if you don’t mind, I’m gonna go home.”</p><p>Sirius closes the backpack and holds it in one of his hands. Remus is even more confused now. He gets up and stands in front of the dark haired boy, trying to stop him from walking away.</p><p>“Sirius, I can help you! That’s is literally why I’m here!”</p><p>The blond boy throws his hands up in frustration. He notices he’s a bit too close to Sirius for his liking and decides to take a step back. Sirius moves his head slightly up in order to look Remus in the eye but doesn’t say anything for at least 5 whole seconds. Which is more than enough time to Remus to pay attention to the other boy’s face.</p><p>Remus didn’t really <em> look </em> at Sirius until right now. He didn’t realize how ridiculously handsome this guy is. His hair is perfectly wavy, his eyes are a beautiful shade of grey, even his stupid leather jacket was pretty. Remus suddenly feels overwhelmed and places his gaze on the floor.</p><p>Sirius lets out a loud breath.</p><p>“Look, I just don’t see how someone like you can help me.”</p><p>Remus frowns his eyebrows.</p><p>“What the hell is that suppose to mean?”</p><p>Sirius rolls his eyes.</p><p>“You’re obviously a perfect student Remus Lupin, you never had to deal with something like this before. I don’t see how you could help me.”</p><p>The blond boy tries ignore the fact that his heart beat a bit faster when Sirius said his name.</p><p>“Well, <em> Sirius Black </em>, I guess we’ll never know will we? You won’t even let me try!”</p><p>“Dude, this is not going to work. Besides, don’t you rather be somewhere else? Like the library or something.”</p><p>Sirius asks in a joking tone. Remus crosses his arm.</p><p>“What’s wrong with the library? I work there.”</p><p>Remus replies sounding annoyed. Sirius lets out a chuckle and looks up at the blond boy.</p><p>“Of course you do.”</p><p>Sirius then walks away from the table. Leaving an extremely confused Remus behind. What the hell just happened here?</p><p> </p><hr/><p>“Tell me all about it! How was your first tutoring session?”</p><p>An excited Lily Evans asks, while coming in Remus’ apartment with an ice cream container in her hands. The boy locks the door behind her and proceeds to throw himself on the couch.</p><p>“It sucked! I just happened to get the worst student in the whole entire universe Lily. Like literally the worst!”</p><p>Remus replied with his face on a pillow.</p><p>“Oh dear. What happened?”</p><p>Lily asks. Her face looking considerably less happy now. She walks to the kitchen to get two spoons and comes back to the couch. She pokes Remus’ leg with one of the spoons.</p><p>“It’s chocolate flavored.” The girl tells him, knowing it will get him to sit up.</p><p>Remus explains the events that happened this afternoon while eating the ice cream with his friend. When he’s done, Lily looks shocked.</p><p>“What the hell? Who even acts like this?”</p><p>She looks irritated.</p><p>“My point exactly! I mean, he <em> is </em> ridiculously hot and I guess it would be nice to have to look at his face twice a week. But, I’m glad I won’t have to deal with that anymore.”</p><p>Lily’s eyes widen and she grins at him.</p><p>“Remus!” She slaps his arm. “You didn’t say he’s hot!”</p><p>“Ow! Does that matter? I won’t see him anymore remember?”</p><p>The redhead rolls her eyes.</p><p>“Of course that matters Remus. I mean he’s a jerk but at least he’s a jerk with a nice face. Not that it makes it any better. It just sucks a little less for you.”</p><p>Remus laughs at her ridiculous logic and frowns his eyebrows.</p><p>“What is that suppose to mean?”</p><p>Lily smiles at him.</p><p>“Well, at least you got to look at his handsome face for a whole hour.”</p><p>She chuckles and puts a spoonful of ice cream in her mouth. Remus pushes on her shoulders lightly and takes the ice cream from her hands.</p><p>When they are done eating, Lily decides she wants to watch a silly romcom that just came out on Netflix and Remus goes along with it. Mostly because the main guy is really cute.</p><p>Halfway through the movie Remus hears his phone make a notification noise from somewhere in his room.</p><p>“Can you pause for a second?”</p><p>The boy asks and starts to walk to his bedroom. He looks at his phone and lets out a loud sigh when he reads the text he just received.</p><p>“Ugh, Jesus…”</p><p>“What is it?” Lily asks from the TV room.</p><p>Remus walks back and hands her the phone, where she can read:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
