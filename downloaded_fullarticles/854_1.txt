    <p>Draco’s jaw dropped at the sight that greeted him in the headmaster’s office. He had come to speak with Headmaster Snape about something the Carrows were doing. He was wholly unprepared to see the sword of Godric Gryffindor on the desk.</p><p>As Draco watched, a beautiful silver doe galloped away through the wall and Severus banished the sword to a forest Draco had never heard of. He hadn’t known Death Eaters could summon patronuses. He had tried and failed many times since third year.</p><p>“I thought that the Dark Lord had stashed that sword in Aunt Bella’s vault,” Draco drawled, announcing his presence.</p><p>Severus turned slowly and assessed Draco, one eyebrow elegantly arched. Whatever he saw, he relaxed almost unnoticeably. </p><p>“Draco. To what do I owe this pleasure?” Severus asked. He turned and leaned against his desk, crossing his arms on his chest. </p><p>“I asked you first,” Draco challenged. He knew it was juvenile but he had an idea forming.</p><p>Severus eyed him again. Draco calmly stared back, careful to avoid Severus’ eyes. His Occlumency was pretty terrible and Draco had learned at a very young age to avoid eye contact with his Godfather. He tried to appear non-threatening and trustworthy, hoping Severus would answer him.</p><p>As a Slytherin, not to mention a Death Eater, Draco was well aware that what he thought - hoped - was going on was a dangerous subject. He was also aware that he was speaking to a very high-ranking Death Eater, the man who had murdered Albus Dumbledore. It was dangerous to even think that this man could be conspiring against the Dark Lord and helping Harry Potter. Dangerous, but he hoped it was true. If the Dark Lord had even the slightest inkling of his true feelings, Draco would be dead. </p><p>Over the years Draco’s thoughts had shifted. He used to believe the Dark Lord was right. Mudbloods were inferior, Purebloods should rule and the Muggles were worthless. Then he started Hogwarts.</p><p>It was a shock meeting Granger. Not only was this little Mudblood upstart book smart, but she consistently had higher scores in practical lessons as well. Draco had been baffled. If his father was to be believed, a Mudblood shouldn’t be as good as, let alone better than, a Pureblood or even a Halfblood. </p><p>Yet until this year, Draco had been second in his year. He only gained the top spot because Granger was missing from school. Once he realized Mudbloods could be as good as or better than him, he noticed the Halfbloods.</p><p>Draco’s own Godfather was a Halfblood and his power rivalled even the Dark Lord himself. And that wasn’t even mentioning Harry Potter. </p><p>Potter. Halfblood. Orphan. Only known survivor of the Killing Curse. Potter had gone against the Dark Lord five times, four of them in the last seven years. And he had gotten away every single time.</p><p>Potter was strong, mentally and magically. Draco had seen Potter in class, on the pitch and he had even viewed memories of him going toe-to-toe against Death Eaters and the Dark Lord himself. Potter never backed down. He was a cheeky little shit to the Dark Lord, mocking him to his face. He had endured several Crucio’s and kept getting right back up.</p><p>Draco’s father, Lucius Malfoy, had shown him those memories during the summer after sixth year when he was “released” from Azkaban. Draco still wasn’t sure what Lucius’s intentions had been, but he was sure he hadn’t had the desired reaction.</p><p>Draco hid it as well as he could, but he had started to admire Potter. It started when Potter landed at the edge of the maze bruised, bloody and clutching what was later revealed to be the dead body of Cedric Diggory, and claiming that the Dark Lord was back.</p><p>Then in fifth year Potter insisted that he was telling the truth. He defied Umbridge and started training a group he called Dumbledore’s Army. Draco also learned Umbridge was forcing him to use a Blood Quill during his detentions. And Merlin, Potter had had a lot of detentions that year.</p><p>The small big of admiration Draco had felt blossomed into full-blown awe by the end of that year. Draco knew Potter was telling the truth, but he didn’t expect Potter to be so persistent. </p><p>Draco had realized at some point in his fifth year that he didn’t want to follow in his father's footsteps and bow to the Dark Lord. The man, if one could call him that, was grotesque and inhuman. He didn’t care at all about his followers. That was proven when Draco’s father was left to rot in Azkaban for months after the debacle at the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>In the summer after fifth year, Draco was brought in front of the Dark Lord. He had been confused and scared. His Aunt had forced him to his knees and then the Dark Lord had arrived.</p><p>In that moment, Draco mentally switched sides. He had taken one look at that grotesque creature and knew he didn’t want anything to do with it.</p><p>He’d been forced to endure the worst pain of his life to date. He had been held down by three men while the Dark Lord pressed his wand into Draco’s left forearm and the ugliest mark he’d had the misfortune to see was burned into his flesh. </p><p>People think it has to be taken willingly, but that’s not true at all. He didn’t want to follow that madman. Having been raised to since birth it was quite surprising, but he was vehemently opposed to almost all that the Dark Lord stood for.</p><p>Then he was informed he was to do the impossible: kill Albus Dumbledore. How the fuck was a sixteen year old boy going to kill a man, let alone Albus bloody Dumbledore? But he had been threatened. Kill Dumbledore or the Dark Lord will sic Bella on Draco’s mother. Draco knew she would do it, and it wouldn’t be pretty.</p><p>So Draco plotted and made several weak attempts to kill the esteemed headmaster. He didn’t know whether to botch his task or succeed. On the one hand, he couldn’t kill someone. He knew he wasn’t capable of murder. But, if he didn’t, his parents would be murdered themselves, in a most brutal fashion. It was a lose-lose situation.</p><p>Watching his Godfather complete his task had been mind blowing. The great Albus Dumbledore stood there, wandless and begging, and Severus Snape of all people had killed him with two simple words. A flash of green light and the headmaster was gone. Dead. </p><p>From that moment on Draco had vowed to himself that he would never willingly help the Dark Lord. Draco wished desperately that there was something he could do to tip the scales in Harry Potter’s favor. That was why he was risking so much, on the mere hope that Severus might be an ally.</p><p>Draco realized with horror that someone was in his mind as the presence withdrew. The headmaster smirked at him. He wasn’t sure when his gaze had slipped, but he hoped either he was right, or that Severus hadn’t gotten anything incriminating.</p><p>“Your barriers are rather abysmal, Draco,” Severus said, smirk still in place.</p><p>Fuck. Draco thought. He paled and wondered if he had made a mistake.</p><p>“However, I was able to glean some useful, and highly interesting, information.” Severus continued.</p><p>“And that might be, sir?” Draco asked, slipping seamlessly into his Pureblood Malfoy™ mask.</p><p>“I underestimated you, Draco. Have a seat,” Severus said, gesturing to the chairs before his desk.</p><p>Draco approached the chairs slowly, unsure of the situation. He decided to take the seat, but nearly jumped back up when he heard Severus utter silencing and locking charms.</p><p>“You asked me a question. After skimming your thoughts, I have decided that you may be trustworthy enough to hear an honest answer. The problem lies in your Occlumency shields, or, rather, lack thereof,” Severus said, as he settled in his high backed chair and steepled his fingers.</p><p>Draco bristled, his pride wounded.</p><p>“I may not be a master Occlumens, but my shields aren’t terrible. Sir.” He added, belatedly realized his tone and to whom he spoke.</p><p>“Certainly they are not the worst I have ever seen. They do, however, leave much to be desired. In less than a week, you return home. Your home is the current base of operations for the Dark Lord. If he suspects, or, more likely, simply decides to wander through your thoughts, he will easily gain any information he pleases.” Severus stated. “How you have survived this long with those thoughts and feelings is a miracle.” Severus sat back and regarded Draco carefully.</p><p>The truth was, Draco avoided the Dark Lord and Death Eaters like the plague. The less time spent in their presence, the better. Especially since failing to kill Dumbledore last year.</p><p>Draco knew he had been given an impossible task. He was the scapegoat, a way of hurting his father for Lucius’ own failures. The Dark Lord had known Draco would fail at his task. That was why he had tried as hard as he had. He had expected to be tortured and then killed, along with his mother and maybe even his father.</p><p>He suspected Severus had somehow saved them both.</p><p>“I can work on my Occlumency, sir. My teacher was rather insane. Aunt Bella isn’t good for much besides torturing people these days. How do you propose I strengthen my shields, sir?” Draco asked.</p><p>He knew he needed better shields, especially with his thoughts regarding the Dark Lord. And Harry Potter, for that matter.</p><p>“Bellatrix was hardly sane before Azkaban, fourteen years in there would not have helped,” Severus said, flicking his fingers as if to brush it aside. “I would suggest reading up on the theory. I know it is your NEWT year, but the professors should not be giving too much work over the holidays.” Severus said.</p><p>Severus then stood up and went to a bookcase behind Draco. He took down a small blue book and tapped it with his wand, muttering something Draco couldn’t hear. He turned and stalked back to his desk. He placed the book on the desk and pushed it forwards, towards Draco.</p><p>“Take this. I have disguised it to look like an Arithmancy book. Until you speak the password, it will remain as such.” Severus said as he settled behind his desk again.</p><p>Draco picked it up, noting that it was indeed a standard arithmancy book, even inside. He lifted his brow, silently asking for the activation phrase.</p><p>“Lily,” Severus said simply.</p><p>As soon as he spoke the word the book changed. It was subtle, but it grew a bit thinner. It was still blue and the cover remained the same. Draco assumed it was to keep it safer for him. He opened the book and found it had the theory and suggestions on Occluding one's mind, as Severus had said.</p><p>“When you are finished, or someone interrupts you, simply tap the cover, front or back, three times with your finger. It will resume the form of the arithmancy text. I have also tuned it to only react to you or I speaking the password. As you are studying arithmancy, it will not be suspicious should you be found with it.” Severus said, taking a sip of the tea on his desk.</p><p>Draco nodded that he understood, still studying the book in his hands.</p><p>“I want you to study that book, work on your shields, and come back before you leave for holiday. I will test your proficiency on Thursday evening after dinner and determine if I am comfortable discussing anything further.” Severus told him.</p><p>Draco nodded again. He was determined to improve enough by Thursday night. He had a strong foundation, he was sure. Three days should be enough to shore up his defences. </p><p>“Bear in mind, the Carrows do not know Legilimency and are the only people in direct contact with you that also have contact with the Dark Lord. If your Occlumency does not improve enough, I may decide to wait until you return before resuming this discussion. Now go, unless you had a reason to be here?” Severus said with a raised brow.</p><p>“I did. I wanted to discuss the Carrows. They’re putting the Cruciatus on first years. Is there anything that you can do about that?” Draco asked, remembering why he had come to the office in the first place.</p><p>“I will think of something. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Draco.” Severus said with a dark look on his face. It was obvious he hadn’t known.</p><p>“You’re welcome, sir. But thank you as well.” Draco said, pocketing the book after tapping the cover. </p><p>He stood and left the office, mulling over the conversation.</p>
