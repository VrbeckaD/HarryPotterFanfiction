</p><p align="center">Maybe if they fixed their wicked ways earlier they would be in their life's, it was the only way to survive from their parents, everyone and themselves, maybe just maybe they would like them back if they did but dreams are for the childish, this is war, the only thing they could do is watch, so that's what there doing, each one of them wanted to run to the one they love, with sweat running down their foreheads, they watch the battle unwind. Their hearts drop when their side is winning, this shouldn't be happening, in the mirror, it said they will fail and fall, this can't happen, they won't let it slide, not on their souls, they split up heading to the ones that captured their hearts three years ago.</p><p align="center">A Boy, frizzy black hair rushes to the orange hair boy who is trying to defend himself from two death eaters, he fires a freeze spell trying to buy him time, the orange hair boy turns to him, his eyes widen and he raises his wand at him, now wasn't the time to fight when more is coming his way, the boy nods no, " Ron, I'm not here to kill you, I'm here to save you," the boy says, Ron keeps his stance. He sighs knowing he wouldn't listen, his heart races as death eaters head towards them, he shakes his head and runs towards Ron before he could cast a spell he was on the ground, the sound of explosions rings in their ears, a hackle erupts the silence, the boy gets off Ron, pointing his wand at the figure, they launch back in the trees with a horrific thud, three more appear, " I should have known, a traitor," one says dropping from his broom.</p><p align="center">Two others land in front of him, the ones frozen, break the ice looking at him with a sinister smile, he looks back at Ron who is frozen in fear, he couldn't take off all them on his own, Ron in shock while more kept coming, he looks at his wand and closes his eyes, sighing his points his wand at Ron, whispering a teleporting spell, he waves goodbye, in mere seconds he's gone, he turns back around seeing ten death eaters glaring at him, " Confringo" he yells pointing at them. Within seconds everything is gone, only ten dead bodies remain on the floor charcoal covers some of their faces, trees around them gone, grass burning with a scent of dry air, a hero or a hoax, no one will know.</p><p align="center">-</p><p align="center">A girl with black dark hair breathes heavily searching for the girl, sounds of faint struggling makes her turn left, in the clearing she finds the girl dirty surrounded by a death eater, who is throwing deadly spells at her, she fires Alarte Asendare at him, the guy goes up in the air and falls flat on his back, she runs towards the girl who is looking at her bewildered, " Stop right there Parkinson" she yells raising her wand at her. Parkinson freezes in her steps, " what are you playing at, did you miss on purpose" she says, she nods no trying to reach out to her, " Keep your hands away from me, I know what your doing, trying to lear me in to the death eaters, I'm smarter than that" she says bitterly, her heart clenches at her words, " Hermione, I'm not trying to lend you ove- " Silencio" Hermione says pointing at her, the girl tries to say something only hearing nothing come out. </p><p align="center">Her eyes widen as the guy gets back up, she tries yelling but nothing still, she takes a step towards Hermione, she points her wand back at her, " Don't even think about it, one more step and I'm paralyzing you" she says harshly, the guy grabs his wand and points at her, Parkinson grits her teeth and runs towards Hermione, pushing her out of the way, she gets hit with Crucio spell, not being able to talk, she silently screams in pain. Grabbing her arm she tries to say something again failing, she pulls out a dagger and runs towards the death eater, avoiding spells being thrown at her, she impales him in the stomach, he drops his wand glaring at her, " Tr-ai-tor" he mutters falling to the floor, she breathes silently and pulls her dagger out, " Traitor, Traitor" a man yells flying on his broom. </p><p align="center">She grips her hands exhausted and annoyed, " Duro" Hermione yells, his broom freezes up turning into stone, falling into his death, she smiles a bit, her eyes widen feeling her skin being torn open, she crouches to the floor grasping her arm,  like having your bones being pulled apart by a knife along with being stab multiple times, Hermione runs over to her having a healing potion in her hands. Pitty, of course, it's pitty, Parkinson thought, " Parkinson hurry drink this" she says holding a pink liquid vile, she trembles grasping it, she downs it and throws the container on the ground, Hermione undoes the spell and she opens her mouth, " Thanks Hermione, I- I-, she embraces her not wanting having the confidence to say anything, the girl greezes at contact, Parkinson flips her over, she bites her lip feeling her dagger  impale her stomach, " He-rmione, get ou-t of he-re" she says gritting her teeth.</p><p align="center">She turns around facing the guy who stabbed her, Ron, he eyes changes color and he drops the dagger, " I- i didn't mean, i did-nt have control" he says with his eyes glassy, two death eaters come fro behind the trees, " Ge-t out o-f here" she yells clutching her side for support, Ron stares at with guilt flooding his eyes, " I'm not leaving you here" Hermione says looking throw her bag for potions, Parkinson smiles sadly, " Ro-n take her and go, I-ll try to hold them off" she says. He stands there, " Now" she yells, he pulls his wand out and grabs ahold of Hermione, she struggles to get out of his grip, " Herm-ione, you w-on, congratu-lations, I gu-ess Gryfrinnd-ors were always bet-ter," she says coughing a bit.</p><p align="center">Hermione stops thrashing and her eyes widen, Ron whispers the spell on the two, " I'm sorry for ruin-ing your life, I love you" she says smiling with tears going down her face, they disappear in front of her with shock on their faces, " Prepare to die, traitor" a voice says.</p><p align="center">-</p><p align="center">  He followed the explosions in the woods running as fast as he can, muttering please don't take him, " Potter you have no way to run, just stop fighting and lend yourself over to me, everyone will be safe, including your friends, stop being selfish" Voldemort says pointing his wand at Potter, Potter drops his wand and looks down, " That's it, now everyone will stop suffering because of you" he says. His eyes widen and he points his wand at Voldemort, " <em>Avada Kedavra" he whispers, Voldemort gets hit, he laughs and turns around, " Thought you could pull that over me, Malfoy, nice try" he says, Malfoy grits his teeth and runs over to him, Voldemort watches him unfazed, he fires a explosion at the boy, he goes flying hitting a some boulders, " Stupid boy, you never listen do you" he says. </em></p><p align="center">        </p><p align="center">He turns back and looks at Potter, " Now, where were we, yes, I almost forgot, Crucio" he says, Potter falls to the ground yelling in pure pain, Voldemort watches in delight, he laughs at the boy who's grabbing his head rolling around in still yelling, Malfoy gets up leaning on the boulder for support, he opens his two pockets pulling out his two daggers, he clenches his teeth at Voldemort laughing at Potter's pain. He runs over to Voldemort one more time, he stabs him in the leg, " Gahh, you little fucker, I'm gonn- he stabs him in the side then the chest, " Come and get me," he yells grinning, he runs going behind the boulders, Voldemort fires <em>Avada Kedavra at him missing terribly, " Stop moving you, bloody git" he yells gripping his wand, Malfoy heads straight for him, Voldemort grins an evil smile.</em></p><p align="center">
  <em>Malfoy moves out of the way, stabbing him in the back, Voldemort crouches holding on to a stone wall by the cliff, he takes a look at Potter who is still in pain, he throws his wand at him and runs towards Voldemort with no fear only determination, he impales the two daggers into his stomach pushing him and himself off the cliff, " I'll see you in hell" he says smirking at him, with a splash everything goes silent. Potter grabs his wand and undoes the spell, runs to the edge of the cliff seeing nothing but fog block his view, " Draco, Dammit, No" he yells hitting the ground, his tears hitting the ground, footsteps head his way, " Harry, wh- he gets up and jumps on them putting his arms around them looking down, " He s-aved me, by sacrificing his self to kill Voldemort, I couldn't do anything, I was useless, I sh- Ron and Hermione hug Harry, " Shhhh, he did it for you, don't blame yourself, you tried and that's all that mattered" Ron says. </em>

  <em>They run to where Pansy was last seen, Hermione looks everywhere for her, only finding her dagger on the floor, " Pansy, Pansy where are you" she yells, Ron watches her in guilt, he stops at a bush finding the black cloak, he checks the name feeling his shoulders slump, he walks back to Hermione and Harry, " Hermi-one I think you wanna see this" he says stuttering a bit feeling his eyes burn. She grabs the jumper reading the name, tears then stain the black cloak, she falls to her knees grasping on the cloak like it was her end, the boys watch in silence, Harry still crying from the incident, Ron beating himself about what he did, if he gained the control she might have been to come with them but even he should have brought he along but he knew she wouldn't make it. </em>

  <em>His mind snaps, Blaise, he had teleported him to safety leaving him to fight ten death eaters by himself, he runs back to where he was, hoping he wasn't taken, he smells the air getting worried for the worst, he stops running and slows down feeling his heart drop, everything is burnt to a crisp grass black ten bodies on the floor with hole in the middle, he walks over to it and his lips quiver, there in the whole Blaise's wand lay. He grits his teeth as well as gripping his hands, " It's not fair, It's Not Fair" he yells, he looks down at it as his life depended, he bawls holding it dear to him, whispering, shhh, it's okay, your in a better place now, you stupid clot, I'm sorry for not noticing it earlier, thanks for saving my life, I hope your happy where ever you are.</em>

  <em>There stood the golden trio looking at the three graves, Draco Malfoy a hero to all, Pansy Parkinson the one who proved them all wrong and Blaise Zabini who showed others can change over time, no one said anything just stood there silently crying blaming themselves for not trying harder, it's not fair but it's better if they don't know, in the distance Severs Snape watches them smiling at the three, it only takes a tragedy to make something real.                   </em>
