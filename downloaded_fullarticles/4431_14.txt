  </span>
</p><p>Tsuna has been reading the books of 'Harry Potter' when suddenly he was reached by a thirst, and not a simple one, but the desire for <em>Hot Chocolate</em>.</p><p>Recently next to the corner a small stand has opened, they sell Hot Chocolate, and each time he passed next to it, a delicious smell reaches his nose, sadly he had not the time to stop and drink some…</p><p>Finally deciding he has to stop being lazy, he got up from his bed, and with a sigh, he started walking down the stairs of the house.</p><p>There was nobody in the house, his mother is away and Reborn… well, he doesn't know where is Reborn, but yes, he is away.</p><p>Humming happily under his breath, closing the door behind him, he started walking toward the small stand, it wasn't near the house, but it wasn't far so that it would be between the two.</p><p>Because he has been thinking about Hot Chocolate, Tsuna didn't feel nor saw the person following him with killing intent.</p><p>It's after walking for some minutes that he finally came near the stand, smelling once again that delicious Hot Chocolate he wanted to taste for already a long time.</p><p>He smiled at the woman;</p><p>"Can I have Hot chocolate?" he asked happily licking his lips, and the woman nodded with a kind smile, giving him a cup.</p><p>Because he was turning around, he didn't see the face of horror on the woman face, and when he heard her cry, it was too late.</p><p>When he finally turned around, he found a gun pointing toward his forehead;</p><p>"Why…?" he asked looking at the person with wide eyes.</p><p>"You're too weak…" the person murmured, and with a click, Tsuna died.</p>
<hr/><p>Today is a typical day for Reborn, except for one thing, he has been forced to get a checkup with Shamal, he wasn't happy, and for Shamal's case… he would prefer a woman.</p><p>The sun Arcobaleno just continued smiling with his baby face, but internally, he was exhausted.</p><p>It was some minutes later that his phone went off;</p><p>"Ciaossu?"</p><p>"R-Reborn…!"</p><p>Reborn blinked, the person on the phone seemed to be in shock and worry.</p><p>"I- I- Oh dio! Tsuna went out for some Hot Chocolate, the one around the corner, it was in full view of the public bu-" Reborn cut him;</p><p>"Explain"</p><p>The person in the phone shut for some seconds, mulling over how to pass the news then finally opened his mouth;</p><p>"T-The Decimo is… dead"</p><p>Suddenly, Reborn felt like if someone had thrown cold water into him, his eyes widened minutely;</p><p>"Repeat"</p><p>"<em>He's dead</em>" the voice choked out "the traitor…"</p><p>Reborn just cut the call and looked down, his eyes holding almost a maniacal glint;</p><p>"I have to go."</p><p>Without saying anything more, he jumped off the table, landing on the floor and started running out the place, Shamal looking after him in confusion;</p><p>"Reborn…?"</p>
<hr/><p>Tsuna slowly opened his eyes to see he was in a very dark space with hints of red, he tried to move, but he could barely move.</p><p>He was confused; he was sure he was killed by someone some seconds ago… strangely, he knows the person, but he can't remember their face… who was it?</p><p>He tried once again to move and finally moved a little, eventually sensing the walls around him, he touched them, and they seemed to be… like meat.</p><p>He wanted to frown but he couldn't, so instead, he kicked, the kick was answered by the walls around him trembling and a feminine sound that seemed to be like a chuckle.</p><p>What the hell is happening to Tsuna?</p><p> </p>
