          <div class="userstuff"><p>Ron groaned with pleasure as her head slid down his cock. His hands moved to tangle in her long hair, breathing heavily as she slowly and sweetly explored his dick with her mouth and tongue. She was so good to him, Ron thought to himself. Every time she knew he had a bad day she was right there on her knees, giving him all the attention she could to make him feel better. He leaned back against the cold, stone wall, his hips thrusting slowly into her wanting, talented mouth. Fuck, he was the luckiest bloke in the world.</p><p>She sucked him slowly as first, allowing his worries and troubles to fade away gently, replaced with a pleasure and passion only she could give him. If anyone knew what she was doing for him, she'd never live it down, but Ron needed her. He needed her to take care of him, to look after him. The other woman in his life didn't understand Ron the way she did. She was his first love and she would be his last.</p><p>"Gods, Ginny," Ron moaned as his cock hit the back of her throat. "You're so good." And she was. The best cocksucker he'd ever had. Ron had plenty of eager women these days, all wanting to bed a war hero, but none of them compared to his baby sister. None of them made his cock come to life the way she did. His wife certainly didn't. Hermione was cold, boring, and distant. Ron fucked her once every two weeks, perfectly on schedule. But he thought of his baby sister every time.</p><p>Ginny looked up at Ron, her brown eyes adoring and pure. She belonged to him, she always had. Ginny had left Harry shortly after the war, knowing that he could never treat her the way Ron could. The way Ron did. She continued to suck him, reaching down between her legs to stroke her own wet folds. It had been weeks since they found time to be together like this, hiding in an empty office in the Ministry. He'd needed her, the owl had said. </p><p>He was getting close. Ginny knew from the way his moans turned into short, heated grunts. She pulled her mouth off his cock and stood, pressing a kiss to her brother's lips before she turned around and bent over the bare desk. With a groan, Ron lifted her skirt and plunged into her, filling her up perfectly. "I love you," he moaned to Ginny as his cock settled deep within her. "I love you so much."</p><p>She knew. Ginny didn't need to say it back. She pushed her body back against his, wiggling her bum lightly. "Hurry," she told him, nearly breathless. "I need it." Ron smirked and smacked her ass lightly. "You always need it," he told her. Nothing made Ginny come harder than when Ron filled her with his seed. He quickly began to fuck her, the sounds of their bodies hitting each other filled the empty room. Ron groaned as his thick cock rubbed against the forbidden walls of his sister's pussy. He moaned her name over and over, the syllables a symphony of love and adoration on his tongue. He worshiped this creature, this beautiful woman. </p><p>It didn't take Ron long to come. It had been weeks and he was desperate for release. Grunting hard, he snapped his hips wildly. "Now," he told her and with one final thrust, Ron came within his sister, pouring himself into her. Ginny cried out with pure bliss as she felt him come. It set her off, her pussy tightening and clenching his cock, milking it for every last drop. She cried out for him, wordlessly, as she came, her slim body shaking and rocking against him. Oh, it had been far too long. </p><p>The couple pulled apart and collapsed to the cold floor. Ginny crawled into her brother's arms and kissed him slowly, his come leaking from her wet entrance. "I stopped taking my potions," she confessed to him quietly. "I know I said I wouldn't, but..."</p><p>Ron pressed a kiss to the top of her head and smiled gently. "It's alright," he told her, surprised at how little he was panicking. "I belong to you anyway, Gin. It's time we start our family."</p></div>
