    <p>A fire crackled in the stone pit as a dark-haired 19-year-old strummed her guitar, playing personal favorites from the <em>White Album</em> for nine other summer camp counselors. Tonight was their night of celebration (and last night of freedom) after seven days of grueling Minerva McGonagall-brand training. Tomorrow morning, they would greet over seventy rambunctious children. Tonight, however, they could throw their responsibilities to the wind. A petite blonde rested her cheek against her guitarist girlfriend’s shoulder, her hand tucked securely into the back pocket of said girlfriend’s jeans where no one could see. Drinks were passed freely around the circle, along with a little weed from their own Camp Director. (“If any of you are too high to function tomorrow, I will know, and I <em>will</em> kick your ass.”) Bunk 5’s counselor, a boy by the name of Remus Lupin, almost fell over laughing as his best friend made a fool of himself for the umpteenth time that week in front of the “girl of his dreams.”</p><p>“You’re classless, Potter. Were you raised by savages?” Severus Snape, the counselor of Bunk 6, sneered. He eyed James Potter with nothing but contempt. The idiot’s hair was already horribly unkempt, but now it was singed on the ends as well. “Your shirt is on backwards, you’ve lost one shoe, and...Did you make any attempt to fix your hair at <em>all</em> this morning, or did the rats living inside that nest chew your brush to pieces?” </p><p>“The true question is, Sev, did you even make an attempt to wash yours at all last <em>week</em>? I can smell you from all the way over here,” James shot back, a smirk crossing his face, bronze skin practically glowing in the light of the fire. That could have been his pride, drunkenness, sweatiness, or perhaps a mixture of all three. He might have almost fallen into the fire doing a drunken handstand and subsequently angered Lily Evans once again, but he still had his dignity. No Snapes could take that away from him.</p><p>The music was paused to allow everyone to listen to the two boys’ banter. Remus had heard it all a million times before, though, and he was much more interested in getting much, much higher. “You’ve been holding onto that for the past three pulls, McKinnon, hand it the fuck over,” Remus hummed at the entertainer. Marlene blew the smoke directly into his face before passing over the joint, which Remus took with the middle finger up on his other hand. He took a generous drag and felt it hit his head all at once. The smoke was held in his lungs for a moment before he blew it all towards the fire. Reaching across a doubled-over James, he handed the drugs to a certain Sirius Black, who was head of the bunk across from his own. Their fingers brushed when they made the trade-off and, in Remus’ state, it made goosebumps prickle all over his skin. He hoped that no one noticed, but if anyone did, he could always blame it on the drugs. Remus could describe his mental state since arriving at camp a week prior in two words--<em>queer</em> and <em>paranoid</em>. </p><p>“Alright, kids, stop your fighting. Black, put out that light for now--Careful! Don’t lose any of that hash. I can’t get to town often enough to supply my own habits, you know that,” Minerva McGonagall winked. She stood up from her sitting stump and put her hands on her hips. “I expect you all to put your differences aside by tomorrow morning. I will not have a repeat of last year, <em>Fabian</em>. You cannot just put scorpions in someone’s pillowcase because they, quote-unquote, deserved it,” she frowned, making little air quotes with her fingers before letting her hands fall to her sides. “I chose you to be examples for these children. Therefore, I expect you to be <em>good</em> examples--”</p><p>Lily Evans interjected. “So...Not whatever Potter is currently being, just to be clear,” she quipped. She shot a smirk over at Marlene and Dorcas, who were still leaning against one another. Summer romances already springing up in a week, of course. Yawn.</p><p>McGonagall almost smiled. “Fabian, get some water in him before bed, will you? I’m not going to deal with head-splitting hangovers on top of Lupin having a residual high. I’m this camp’s director, after all, and I will not have the parents judging me more than they already do for wearing my fucking--”</p><p>“Minnie, I know, but people still don’t like hippies.” </p><p>“Poppy <em>Pomfrey</em>. It’s true, but that doesn’t mean you have to say it,” Minerva smiled down at her, smoothing her long skirts before she sat down next to her partner and wrapped an arm around Poppy’s waist. “If you tell any of the campers that the hot nurse is my girlfriend, I’ll put you all on dishwashing duty with Frank for the rest of the summer.” </p><p>“Aye aye, Captain,” James saluted, promptly faltering and falling backwards off the log. </p><p>“Okay, someone has to carry him back. Counselors! The stellar summer camp experience we provide at Griffin’s Door revolves around what three things?” McGonagall clapped for half minded attention.</p><p>“Choosing your adventures, making great friends, and creating memories that last a lifetime,” the whole crowd droned the camp motto while slumping on their logs. What was meant to be inspiring fell short to a group of inebriated half-adults. </p><p>Minerva was not impressed. “Aren’t you all just perfect pictures of bright-eyed and optimistic camp counselors?” James followed her comment with a dopey grin and waved to her, looking proud of himself, as always. </p><p>McGonagall and Poppy left then, and most of the counselors followed (well, in James’ case, he was dragged). Marlene and Dorcas stayed back to whisper about something before grinning to each other and running off the direction opposite the cabins. Remus had only stayed back to talk to them, but apparently they had no interest in anyone but each other. He rolled his eyes and downed the rest of his beer, then turned to rise before he caught the eye of another counselor--Sirius. Christ. Say something, Lupin. “Hey,” he mumbled, reaching up to rub the back of his neck. “Some speech McGonagall gave. I’m sorry about James, by the way, since he probably fell on you twice.” Remus pursed his lips and dropped his beer bottle, looking up at the sky so that he wouldn’t have to look at Sirius. </p><p>Sirius had zoned out before the motto, staring into the fire without much thought besides how the embers looked like rubies. God. He was slightly...okay, maybe entirely high. He was aware of everyone leaving, but it took Remus shifting around for his reverie to subside. Looking up was either the best or worst choice he had made his entire life. Ever since he laid eyes on Remus Lupin, he had felt a steadily increasing urge to hug or kiss the gorgeous boy and would take whichever of the two Remus would allow. Just ogling him was almost enough.  Almost. It was 1978 and he was as queer as a football bat, so he suspected that the counselor of Bunk 5 would not appreciate his advances. Nevertheless, he mumbled back an awkward hey and immediately felt the need to kick himself, cursing this embarrassing part of his nature. Any time he talked to an attractive guy, he lost all confidence and turned as ineloquent as James Potter--He said stupid shit, but at least he kept a cool composure. “What an inspiration that woman is. I’d vote for her over Nixon any day,” He responded,  attempting to sound witty. Did he? He already knew that he was going to replay this conversation in his head for an hour before he fell asleep and regret at least half of it for the next ten years. “Ah, I wasn’t really bothered, about James. You probably handle a lot more than most of us do, being a part of his friend group, and all. Um,” Sirius paused, twiddling his thumbs for a moment before blurting out the first thing that came to mind. “Musicals. Thoughts?” </p><p>He had really just brought up musicals. Corvettes, fuck, why hadn’t he mentioned Corvettes? Damn it! Guys liked corvettes. They liked cars. (Mother had just got him a red Corvette as a bribe to keep him from spilling news of his latest beating to his father. Walburga Black was a joy.) The lead up to the topic at hand, well...It was nonexistent. He supposed he didn’t have much lead up to the Corvette thing either, but at least it was manlier than musical fucking theatre. As he continued to overanalyze every second of their interaction, he hardly processed Remus’ response. Melting into the ground would have been a handy skill to possess at that moment. </p><p>“I don’t really know any musicals,” Remus smirked, looking back over at Sirius. Was it his imagination, or did Remus seem rather nervous? “My high school didn’t have a theatre department or anything. I take it yours did, since you and Dorcas have been fighting over who would make a better director for the past week. She’s pretty adamant about the fact that she’s the better choice and deems it necessary to tell me that every time she opens her mouth. I, however, have not heard your side of the story, and I think I need to in order to make a fair judgement on the matter,” he mused, his crossfaded brain giving him a significant amount of courage. Enough to send him scooting over to take a seat on Sirius’ log, at least. Sirius was a <em>beautiful</em> boy. He was half-Japanese, Remus had learned, with choppy, shoulder-length black hair, grey eyes, and the best bone structure that God could create. He was about a head shorter than Remus and thin in every place save his hips and thighs. <em>Christ</em>, his lips. Remus had been watching them move as he nodded along to what Sirius had to say.</p><p>“--And she likes <em>Shakespeare</em>, Remus. That’s why I’m better than her! She has lousy taste, and if I have to put on another performance of A Midsummer’s Night Dream I’ll--”</p><p>“Sirius,” Remus interrupted, blinking for a moment. James had told him that in California, gay men would high five on the street as a signal for queerness, so now they couldn’t high five because people would get the wrong idea about their ‘beautiful, wholesome friendship.’ “Would you mind giving me a high-five?” </p><p>Sirius’ rant came to a screeching halt as Remus mentioned a high-five. A high-five? Here, by a campfire, with no reason for it? Oh. Oh. Lightbulb. His epiphany turned his thoughts with embarrassing swiftness to the newer meaning of the gesture. They were now a means for gay men to recognize each other in larger cities. He studied Remus’ expression and searched for something, hell, <em>anything</em>, that might indicate any underlying intentions. Before the moment could pass, he raised his hand with obvious avidity in both his eyes and his movements. Remus met his gaze with startling intensity, conveying an answer to a question he didn’t dare ask. Could he read minds?</p><p>The high-five was slow as they mirrored one another’s movements, raising their hands and meeting palms. Sirius’ attention shifted from Remus’ gaze to their hands and felt heat rising in his cheeks. At the same moment, Remus Lupin made a decision. After seven days of stolen glances and pure pining on his part, a simple, seemingly innocent and boyish symbol was their catalyst. Remus closed the distance between them and Sirius was sure he would pass out. It was about as awkward as a makeout could be, but to him, it was mind blowing perfection. With only two other curious guys to compare it to and a string of girls who had more than confirmed his sexuality, Remus was quite possibly the holy grail of all makeouts. McGonagall’s provided weed may or may not have influenced his perception of reality, but Sirius would swear to Dorcas later that Remus Lupin was the best kisser on the North American continent. At <em>least</em>.</p><p>Everything was clumsy, from the way their teeth occasionally scraped against each other to hands that were impossible to coordinate. After minutes or maybe seconds passed, Remus was pulling at Sirius’ waist for closer proximity, changing their position from bending awkwardly towards each other to pressing flush against one another. Such intentions failed as Sirius lost his seat on the log and slipped, landing flat on his ass and, of course, taking Remus with him. Thankfully, there was no time for mortification. The vitality of the ongoing bonfire bathed their sides as they made eye contact once more, their lips crushing together again with zero finesse. Remus took advantage of the fact that he was now practically straddling his fellow camp counselor’s lap, and curled his fingers tightly into Sirius’ black hair. It was just as he imagined, impossibly soft to the touch. It convinced him that he was officially ten percent gayer than he was before he asked for the stupid high-five. 
</p><p>It took all the willpower Sirius had to place his palms on Remus’ chest and push away just enough to make it possible to speak. The vulnerability in the other boy’s eyes at being forced away made his heart leap into his throat. “Hi, um, so. I have cabin. There’s a rock digging so far into my ass I think it’s trying to get frisky. Can we go there? My bed is shit but it’s more comfortable than the ground, I promise.” </p><p> </p><p>When Remus was pushed away, he immediately knew what words would come next.<br/>
<em>Sorry, fuck, I’m just so</em> <strong>drunk</strong>. <em>We can have fun. It doesn’t have to mean anything</em>.<br/>
He was pleasantly surprised to hear that <em>holy shit Sirius Black was asking him to bed</em>. Okay. Maybe not that kind of bed. But in a bed with another boy. That would be new. “You do have cabin. I don’t want that rock getting any friskier without consent, so yes, we can go there,” he blushed, pushing himself off the ground and standing to dust all the ash and dirt off his clothes. He reached down to help Sirius up and kept his hand in Sirius’ for a moment before pulling it away. Remus wasn't one to make assumptions.</p><p>Sirius did not have to wait long for an answer. A grin brighter than the star he was named for spread across his features when Remus <em>didn’t say no</em>. Of course, he wasn’t asking for that kind of bed, he didn’t dare assume that Remus was <em>that</em> interested in him. Was this a drunken mistake to him? Possibly, but at least they kissed. Sirius’ intoxicated brain hardly cared for such technicalities. What he could process was that for a few precious seconds, Remus was holding his hand, but he quickly let go and left Sirius’ palm noticeably tingling with energy. Before Sirius could fixate too much on the idea of holding Remus’ hand, he stepped over the log and led the way back to his cabin--albeit in a rather stumbly fashion. </p><p>Despite all attempts to keep silent, Sirius accidentally slammed the screen of the bunk’s door open so loudly that he was sure the entire camp would wake up. That was currently only a dozen people or so, but still. His heart was hammering wildly in his chest as he closed the door behind Remus, surprised that they had actually made it to this point. It wasn’t just some weird weed dream. Sirius pulled back the covers of his cot and crawled under them, kicking off his shoes one at a time as a weight settled in beside him. These beds really weren’t made for two people. So. Sirius scooted over enough for Remus to lie down before daring to climb on top of him. The next two hours--Christ, it really was two--were spent with the knowledge that they were <em>both</em> excited, but neither dared to go further. It made both boys feel giddy in ways neither of them could convey. Eventually, the need to sleep caught up to them, and they curled up together in the rickety excuse for a bed.</p><p>“Hey,” Remus whispered as he traced little patterns down Sirius’ spine. “You should be the director. Dorcas doesn’t know what she’s talking about.”</p><p>---</p>
