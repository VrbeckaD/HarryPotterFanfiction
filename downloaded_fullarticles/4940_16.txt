          <div class="userstuff"><p>Narcissa had been seventeen, he nineteen, when they'd both gotten their dark marks.  She didn't want to and told him so, nevertheless she had grabbed his hand and  squeezed  as she had the mark burned into her skin. She had cried afterwards and he had comforted her telling her they'd made the right chose. How wrong he had been. </p><p>A year later, they had gotten married.  None of the guests seemed to care.  All of them were there for their parents anyway.  It had been more of a death eater social gathering than a wedding and that night, Lucius had realized they were still kids, puppets in their parents war.  </p><p>One year later, Draco had been born and everything became real. They couldn't still be those crazy in love teenagers they were. They had to grow up, for their son. </p><p>The war had seemed exciting all those years ago, but then they hadn't known what it could take out of a person. They shouldn't have had to grow up so fast. Thank Merlin, he's gone. </p><p>Now, all those years later, he's back and everyday Lucius regrets his decision. He dragged Narcissa(and subsequently their then unborn son) into this war. If only he'd listened to his sweet Narcissa all those years ago. Then, maybe they wouldn't be stuck fighting in a war they didn't believe in. He should have listened to Narcissa, because dark marks aren't erasable.</p></div>
