    <p>Remus had made up his mind, no one, not even Dumbledore would convince him otherwise this time. Though the Headmaster didn’t even attempt to and soon Remus realised why. His secret was out.</p><p>     He’d known Severus to be an angry and spiteful man, he never thought him to be as cynical as to reveal Remus’s secret to the whole school. The owls had probably already begun to arrive, parents outraged that he was anywhere near their children, the absolute panic that their children had somehow become infected. Remus knew that some would at least respect him for resigning before he was forced out, but most would probably hate him. Possibly some of his ex-students from years gone by would feel just as outraged.</p><p>     Remus was struggling to move around his office, feeling aches and pains he’d not felt for nearly ten years, not since Angelina invented a refined and more effective version of the Wolfsbane potion. He forgot how torturous it was on the body and even more so on the mind, all of which would be ahead of Angelina now that he had committed the most evil of crimes against her. He hadn’t been sure at first, but the images kept flashing in the front of his mind, her body falling from the tree and his strong jaw snapping around her shoulder and neck, the neck he used to kiss, the shoulder he used to hold, the skin he used to worship with everything he was.</p><p>     Angelina had every right to never speak with him ever again, but now that she was his only chance at redemption, he had to try to make peace. His heart began to speed up seeing her name drifting outside of his classroom, but it stopped there, she was having second thoughts. Harry soon appeared next to her and the two of them stayed there for a while. </p><p>     Remus wanted to go downstairs and find out what they were talking about, he wanted to apologise to Angelina, no… no he didn’t. What Remus really wanted to do, more than anything in the world, was to bring her into his arms, kiss her with everything he had and worship everything about her until she found it in herself to forgive him. But he wouldn’t, not because he was worried that someone would see him, not because he barely had the energy to pack his things, if he had to he’d drink every potion going to find the energy, no he would never go down those stairs, because he knew the absolute truth of where they were. Remus walked away because he was angry; Angelina walked away because he destroyed her.</p><p>     He watched her name make it’s way out of Hogwarts and towards the gates, he couldn’t watch it disappear, he couldn’t take that pain again, so he walked away from the map and continued packing. How could he think that his life wouldn’t come to an end? How could he think that he could grow old with anyone, let alone Angelina Lockwood? She was beautiful and smart and kind and brave and a hero, she was more than anyone deserved. He never stood a chance.</p><p>     Remus heard Harry’s footsteps as he came up the stairs to his office, he put on a brave face for him. ‘Hello Harry.’ He said and placed a few of his books into his case. ‘I saw you coming.’ Remus gestured to the map. ‘Everything alright?’</p><p>     ‘No. You’re leaving.’ Harry said miserably. He remembered when Harry was just a boy, an innocent life, completely unaware of the future that lay ahead of him, unaware of pain or unhappiness or loss or guilt or anything that he was now becoming aware of. He’d been through so much in the last three years and Remus knew what was in store next years, the only saving grace was that the Triwizard Tournament would have an age limit like last time. </p><p>     ‘Yes, Harry.’ Remus sighed. ‘It’s best for everyone that I leave before Dumbledore is put under any more pressure concerning my condition.’</p><p>     ‘But you’ve taught here for years and nothing has ever-‘</p><p>     ‘And that is exactly why I need to leave now.’ Remus interrupted him before Harry could finish the sentence with something Remus would find difficult to defend. ‘I’m sure if you talk to your parents, they will say the same thing…’ Remus sighed and leaned on his desk. ‘Harry, I want you to understand something about last night. I want you to tell me you know how lucky you were to escape with your life, I want you to understand that Angelina had no right to be there and no reason to do what she did beyond it being the right thing to do. Tell me you understand.’</p><p>     ‘I understand.’ Harry nodded, still looking miserable. ‘None of it made a difference though, Pettigrew escaped.’</p><p>     ‘Harry, it made all the difference in the world,’ Remus implored. ‘You uncovered the truth and saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference and for that I am grateful.’ </p><p>     Remus took a breath and continued packing his desk. He came to the picture frame on his desk, Angelina. It seemed to be a great effort to hide her face within his case, but he needed to leave quickly. </p><p>     ‘She said no one important got hurt last night.’ Harry told him and it made Remus’s heart sink, to the extent that he leaned on the desk again, his shaky and tired arms the only thing hold him upright. ‘But she got hurt… did you…?’ Harry couldn’t finish the sentence and Remus was so grateful that he didn’t.</p><p>     ‘I don’t know.’ Remus lied. ‘Only Angelina knows the truth of how she got hurt, but I’m sure she would still be in the hospital wing if it was serious.’ Remus almost believed it himself.</p><p>     ‘Did you tell her about the cottage?’ Harry really didn’t seem to realise the pain he was causing Remus, but then Remus never did let it be known how much pain he was ever in.</p><p>     ‘No, I didn’t.’ Remus suddenly frowned. ‘How do you about the cottage?’</p><p>     ‘I heard mum and dad talking about it last summer before she came back.’ Harry shrugged.</p><p>     ‘Well, perhaps its best I didn’t say anything and cause her anymore pain than I already have done.’ Remus put the conversation to bed. ‘Why don’t you get some breakfast Harry, you’re still looking a little pale.’</p><p>     He knew Harry could tell he just wanted to be alone, but he didn’t seem to mind too much and went to leave Remus’s office.</p><p>     ‘Oh, I almost forgot, Angie had a message for you.’ Remus’s eyes snapped up to Harry’s, eager to hear anything that came from Angelina. ‘She said you can give her things to David and that she wouldn’t be coming back for them.’ Remus’s heart deflated once again. </p><p>     ‘Right.’ Remus nodded. ‘Thank you, Harry. I’m sure I’ll see you again soon.’ </p><p>     Harry soon left Remus to finish packing, he knew what he needed to do, he knew that he needed to return the prophecy himself and at least try.</p><p> </p><p>David had caught up with me as I was leaving Hogwarts, he was concerned, but having already heard what happened, he just wanted to make sure I wasn’t going to do anything rash or impulsive. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do, I just knew that I needed to sleep and figure out what was going to happen. I could see it on his face, the worry and the sadness washing into one expression. </p><p>     I didn’t know what else to tell him so I simply apparated back home. Luckily my father hadn’t left for work yet and was able to help me, but the second I began to tell him what happened, I broke. He wrapped his arms around me and let me cry for a while, he kept telling me that everything would be okay, but I knew he was only saying it because he didn’t know what else he could say. </p><p>     He had a look at the wound and agreed with Pomfrey’s assessment. It was healing at an abnormal rate and truthfully, my father was unsure of how to fix it.</p><p>     ‘Honestly, Angie, you should be unconscious and in a lot more physical pain right now.’ He said, adjusting the fresh bandages he’d placed over the bite. ‘Are you absolutely sure that…?’</p><p>     ‘What? That he bit me? Dad you can see the marks.’</p><p>     ‘Alright Angie!’ My father snapped and sat down next to my bed. ‘I’m just trying to help you, but this isn’t a normal case and without Remus here to tell us his side of things, I really don’t know-‘</p><p>     ‘What do you mean “his side of things”?’ I was letting my anger get the best of me now and I really didn’t want to. ‘Dad, he wouldn’t remember even if he was here! He bit me! What more do you need to know?’</p><p>     ‘Perhaps, if you care to think a little about this, we could find out if he’s been keeping up with Silvermint Tea routine! Perhaps, if you weren’t so blinded, we could find out if he’d used the anti-flaring balm recently!’ He took a deep calming breath, before continuing. ‘Now I understand that you’re still upset over what happened, I understand that you must be feeling an array of emotions right now and that given what you went through, you’re probably exhausted. But, can you try to see that I am trying to think a little outside the box here and figure out if my only daughter has become a werewolf?’ I felt my eyes widen a little. ‘Yes… yes, there is still a question here, Angie.’ My father sighed. ‘As far as I can see, you know more about lycanthropy than anyone, you are not at risk of transformation or any other trauma at this moment in time, you don’t seem abnormally worn or tired or exhibit any other early sign of infection, so we need to draw a new conclusion about what happened last night.’ </p><p>     My father was right, my mind was so scattered and broken that I couldn’t think straight, he was doing his best to help, but we both knew that this was something I needed to think on for a while.</p>
