"Y-Your relationship?"</p><p>Argus began, "Yes, we're dating; Headmistress."</p><p>Kreacher saw the surprised expression of Headmistress McGonagall and interrupted, "It was my decision, Headmistress. I think we should dispel the false rumours and I want everyone in Hogwarts to know how much I love this man."</p><p>Headmistress McGonagall smiled. "I was just going to say go ahead, Kreacher. I've been waiting for you two to go official."</p><p>Argus mumbled, "You have been?"</p><p>Headmistress McGonagall nodded and beamed, "It was almost as obvious as Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter's true feelings for each other all those years ago. I wholeheartedly support your decision to go public."</p><p>She cleared her throat and declared, "Students, Professors and ghosts; our caretaker Mr. Filch wants to share something with you."</p><p>The students and the other witches and wizards clapped.</p><p>Argus stepped forward beside Headmistress McGonagall and announced, "I want to tell you, all of you that I am dating this house..."</p><p>He stumbled and stuttered, "E-E-E."</p><p>Kreacher took over, "Elf, he's dating me. Kreacher, Mr. Potter's house elf."</p><p>Their audience was silent for a while, but then cheered.</p><p>One student cheered, "Go you!"</p><p>Argus stepped back, took Kreacher's hand and grinned. "Thank you for persuading me to do this and for..."</p><p>Kreacher replied, "You're very welcome."</p></div>
