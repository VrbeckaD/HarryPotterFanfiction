          <div class="userstuff"><p>It's been a few weeks since their first kiss, and both Hermione and Pansy couldn't be happier. Exploring this new, beautiful thing between them was exhilarating. It gave them a rush they weren't sure they could ever come down from.</p><p>Hermione's days were filled with tea, books and kisses, and she wouldn't trade this life for anything in the world. Well, <em>almost</em> anything. </p><p>The sight that stood at her front door just might make the cut.</p><p>It was Malfoy. That in of its own wasn't very peculiar, but he looked <em>nervous</em>.</p><p>"Hello Malfoy. Are you here to see Pansy?" Hermione inquired, letting him step inside.</p><p>"Uh no, actually..I'm here to talk to you.." Malfoy shoved his hands into his pockets.</p><p>Okay, that was surprising. Hermione furrowed her brows and murmured a long 'okay' before heading to her kitchen. </p><p>"What do you need?" She asked when they were seated. Malfoy looked distinctly uncomfortable.</p><p>"I need your help." He spoke at length. </p><p>This day was full of surprises. Hermione wished Pansy wasn't sleeping still so she could bear witness to this wonder. The brunette woman nodded at Malfoy to go on. </p><p>"So remember when I first came to see Pansy?" Malfoy started, leg bouncing under the table.</p><p>"Yes." Hermione confirmed, still unsure where this was heading. Nothing particularly special happened that day.</p><p>"Remember what you told me to do?" He continued, looking like he wished to be anywhere else but here. </p><p>Whatever he needed Hermione's help with seemed to be extremely important if Malfoy looked like he wanted to run away screaming. </p><p>The woman thought back to that visit. What <em>did</em> she tell him to do? Mulling over the conversations, it finally clicked after a second. She advised him to ask Harry out, since they both felt the same about each other. Right. What about that?</p><p>She nodded to Malfoy, before something hit her. Wait, was Malfoy here to ask for <em>love advice?</em> </p><p>"Okay so about that..." Malfoy waved his hands around, gesturing wildly, clearly attempting to convey a message to Hermione.</p><p>It was hilarious.</p><p>She couldn't help but laugh at this, realizing with crystal clarity how embarrassed Malfoy was.</p><p>"What about it?" Hermione asked, leaning forwards, resting her chin in her palm on the table. </p><p>"You know.." He waved a hand dismissively. </p><p>"I don't. You'll have to tell me." She countered, having far too much fun playing with Malfoy like this. To be fair, he <em>did</em> deserve it, just a lil.</p><p>Malfoy looked to be at the end of his tether, a scowl etched into his face. </p><p>"I don't know how to--" He grimaced. "--ask him out.." It was spoken very quietly.</p><p>Hermione chuckled. Oh, this has turned out to be such a fun day. </p><p>"And you need my help with that?" She checked, and Malfoy nodded, still grimacing at himself. "Have you never asked someone out before?" Hermione inquired. She found it odd that Malfoy would need help with it. It wasn't a very complicated act to perform.</p><p>"Of course I have, but this is <em>different."  </em>He rolled his eyes, scoffing as if it were obvious.</p><p>Taking those words to thought for a moment, the woman tried to reason <em>how</em> exactly it was different. Asking someone out was asking someone out, there wasn't much else to it. Considering it now though, Hermione found that to be such a stupid line of thinking. This was <em>much </em>more important.</p><p>Before she could really reply, there was the sound of her Floo ringing, and then the thump of footsteps. </p><p>"Mione? You home?" Harry called from her living room, and both Hermione and Malfoy froze on the spot. Exchanging an alarmed look, Hermione stood and rushed into the living room.</p><p>"Yeah, Harry I'm here. What's up?" The woman asked, closing the door to her kitchen on her way out. This wasn't the place nor time for the talk Harry and Malfoy would need to have.</p><p>Harry flushed and plopped himself down on her couch, reclining as if her owned the place. With a fond roll of her eyes, Hermione joined him.</p><p>"I've decided to ask Draco out." He deadpanned. "You know I've had a crush on him since school and I figured it's best to just ask, and see what happens."</p><p>Hermione was completely floored. The newfound irony of this day was almost overwhelming. </p><p>"Oh, right. That's amazing Harry! I'm happy for you." She nodded with a smile, trying hard not to glance at her kitchen too often.</p><p>"But, you know I'm not the best with these things, or the most eloquent person in the world." Harry explained, biting his fingernails.</p><p>"That's because you don't read enough." Hermione sighed. "Alright, so you need help with what to say then?" </p><p>Harry nodded and Hermione took a deep breath. She had Malfoy in her kitchen with the exact same problem. She could, of course, just shove them both into a room together and make them discuss, but that would be very anticlimactic and not very romantic. Considering Harry was a die-hard romantic, she figured that wouldn't be very fun.</p><p>"I've already talked to Ron, but he gets tongue tied whenever Zabini walks into the room, just like I do with Draco. Sooooo, will you help me?" Harry batted his puppy eyes at her and Hermione scowled:</p><p>"You brat, you <em>know</em> I will. It's just...I don't know Malfoy all that well, how do I know what he finds romantic?" </p><p>Harry waved her off:</p><p>"Oh that's easy, I can tell you that. I just need help with how to word it. If you leave it all up to me, I'll end up shoving my foot in my mouth."</p><p>The woman chuckled. She supposed if you spent years on end intensely staring and stalking someone, you'd pick up on a thing or two about them.</p><p>"Okay so tell me, what was your plan?" She got more comfortable, feeling only a little bad for leaving Malfoy in the kitchen all by himself. Eh, he was a wizard, he could take care.</p><p>"Well, despite what he may say or act like, Draco is a softie. I can see it when there's a hostage situation. Out of all us Aurors, he's always the one that comforts the hostages. So I was thinking something sweet but not too over the top." Harry began to explain. "He's also affectionate. I know it sounds crazy, but trust me on this Mione." </p><p>Hermione did.</p><p>"Whenever Zabini comes to visit from the Misuse of Magical Artefacts, they hug and are sort of pressed together. Like I said, affectionate." He stopped for breath.</p><p>"Okay, and?" How Hermione hoped Malfoy was listening to this.</p><p>"So I was thinking. Take his hand and lead him away somewhere. Some place with the right atmosphere. And then ask him."</p><p>Hermione was <em>this</em> close to laughing. </p><p>"That's a solid plan, okay, not too bad coming from you." She instead spoke, schooling herself.</p><p>"Hey!" Harry indignantly huffed and rolled his eyes.</p><p>"What did you want to say? Pretend I'm Malfoy." She sat up straighter, trying to appear as prim and prissy as Malfoy always did.</p><p>Harry took a deep breath and looked at Hermione very intensely:</p><p>"There's something I want to ask you Draco. I know it might sound crazy, but I really do mean this."</p><p>He stopped for a moment, and Hermione blinked. </p><p>"I've liked you for a long time, and wanted to ask if you'd want to go on a date with me sometimes?"</p><p>There was a crash from the kitchen.</p><p>Hermione shook her head and smiled:</p><p>"That's <em>perfect</em> Harry. Trust me."</p><p>Harry pointed at the kitchen, brows furrowed.</p><p>"Must be Pans, don't worry. Anyways, no need to fret, that was perfect."</p><p>Harry bit his lip and pushed his glasses higher up his nose:</p><p>"You think? Is it too much--or--or not enough--"</p><p>"Harry." Hermione cut in gently. "It's just right. When will you ask him?"</p><p>Harry stood up with a wide smile:</p><p>"Tomorrow. I'm so excited, even if he says no, which is what'll most likely happen. At least I tried." </p><p>Hermione nodded absently and stood too, to follow him back into the Floo. He had <em>no </em>idea...</p><p>As soon as Harry Floo-ed away, she returned to the kitchen, only to find Malfoy cleaning up a broken glass from the floor.</p><p>"The hell were you doing in here?" She muttered and pulled her own wand out to assist him.</p><p>"Well at first, I was eavesdropping, then I suffered a minor heart attack, then got a glass of water to calm down, but I dropped it." He replied, not looking up from the floor.</p><p>Hermione snorted and patted his shoulder:</p><p>"Awee, aren't you whipped? Well, at least you don't have to worry about how to ask him out anymore." </p><p>Malfoy straightened up, having vanished all the glass. He was smiling like the sun. </p><p>~</p><p>There were no news for a few days after that day, and Hermione was starting to get a hunch something was up.</p><p>Whether good or bad, she didn't know. </p><p>Pansy was convinced Malfoy and Harry were shagging like bunnies to make up for lost time. In her words, Malfoy is <em>'an insatiable slut'.</em></p><p>Hermione didn't fancy jumping to conclusions too quickly and decided to go visit Harry to see what happened and whether he really did ask Malfoy out. </p><p>As she Floo-ed into his living room, the sight on the couch made her wish she hadn't.</p><p>
  <em>Pansy had been right. Dear Gods she'd been right. </em>
</p><p>Hermione turned on her heel, and ducked back into the Floo, disappearing as quickly and quietly as possible.</p><p>~</p><p>
