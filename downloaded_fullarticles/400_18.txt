    <p>If you asked the alphas, they would tell you the world was a Utopia place. Filled with promise, dominance, and everything handed to them on a silver platter. If you asked the betas, they would merely shrug. They knew their place in the world and how to survive in it. Grateful that they didn’t have to deal with the primal urges the other genders had to contend with. But if you asked the omegas, they would whisper, during the quietest part of the night, when all else asleep for fear of their safety, that the world was a dystopian place—filled with fear, pain, and shackles. </p><p>Draco knew nothing of the omega’s world, other than what his family had warned him about his entire life. Pray that you never present as an omega. To do so is a dishonor to the Malfoy name. To present as the lowest of the dynamics is to give your life over to your alpha. To give up your freedom. </p><p>Draco wasn’t worried, though. Both his parents came from a long line of alphas with the occasional beta mixed in here and there. There was even a gamma on his mother’s side. An aunt or something. He didn’t bother to remember the details. Draco was positive he would present as an alpha like both his parents. He would stand tall and proud, with his chest puffed out as he continued the Malfoy alpha bloodline. A strong pack of dominating alphas if ever there was one. </p><p>There were foolish people in the wizardly world who believed in omega rights, and omega equality. Draco scoffed at the notion. Just as he scoffed whenever Granger would spew house-elf rights, it made him sick. Witches and Wizards have spent centuries with alphas as the leaders of their society. Where alphas rule and all others follow. Just because the muggles were moving towards omega rights didn’t mean they had too. What did muggles know anyway? No magical powers, giving omegas freedom. They were nothing more than beasts. Dogs to be kept down and used as servants. Just like his father always said, just like Lord Voldemort used to say before he was defeated by Dumbledore the year before. </p><p>Though, to be honest, Lord Voldemort wanted total genocide of all muggles and to enslave the betas along with the omegas. Voldemort’s reign would have indeed brought a dystopian world for everyone had he not been defeated. Draco was secretly glad Dumbledore had stopped the mad man. A secret he would take to his grave. </p><p>Draco was with his mother in Diagon Alley, collecting his last set of books and school robes. Being his seventh year meant he only had to endure this torturous day of shopping only once more before he would be free. Typically he would be shuffled along by both his parents, but his father was still in Azkaban with his mother under investigation. </p><p>In a sense, he was grateful his father wasn’t around. Draco had turned eighteen over the summer and still hadn’t presented. His mother was concerned that he might be a beta and had entertained the idea of having a presenting potion created to help him along. Presenting potions were illegal to develop without a license. Only those who worked in the medical field were allowed to create them. The reason being that forcing someone to present before their body was ready could be very dangerous for the person presenting. If they were an alpha, there was a risk that their knot might not fully form, and they could end up with small or malformed knots, not usable for mating. An omega forced into early presentation ran the risk of an underdeveloped uterus. Both risked weak scent glands. Plus, a forced heat and rut were notorious for being so painful that early presentation without a partner could lead to injury or even death in the pursuit of relief. </p><p>Thankfully, Narcissa wasn’t willing to risk her son’s future or his life just to make him present any sooner. Even if Draco were a beta, he would still go through a very mild presentation. Mostly it would be a day or two of discomfort. There would be an itching sensation on and around his glands located on his neck and wrist. Unlike an alpha or omega, who has all the scent glands, on the neck, wrists, inner thighs, and mating glands in a plump spot slightly behind and below their ears on their necks; betas only had normal scenting glands on their necks and smaller ones on their wrist. By-products of what could have been an alpha or omega had their genes for such dynamics been stronger. </p><p>As it stands, the glands are not totally useless; they were useful for including betas into packs. An alpha would nip a beta in their scent gland marking them as one of their own. A beta added to an alpha’s pack was a high honor, especially a pack as strong and important as the Malfoy family. </p><p>Many betas have tried to gain his father’s favor in the hope of getting that mark on their neck, but Lucious didn’t include just anyone. Draco couldn’t remember a single time his father has ever given any beta a pack mark. </p><p>However, both his parents bore the pack mark of Lord Voldemort. Scared tissue on their necks nearly overlapping their bond marks to each other. As if HIS mark was more important. More significant than any bond mark to their mate. The thought that he could have had that on his throat made him shiver. </p><p>They were in Madam Malkin’s Robes as a small witch flitted around him, calling out measurements to a floating quill and parchment. </p><p>“He doesn’t seem to have grown much from last year. Are you sure he needs new robes?” the grey-haired witched asked with a nervous smile. This was not her first time dealing with Narcissa Malfoy. </p><p>“He’ll be presenting as an alpha this year, which means a growth spurt. He’ll need extra room in the shoulders and length.” Narcissa said with full confidence. Nose in the air. </p><p>“Of course, Mrs. Malfoy,” the witch said with a small bow and continued her work. </p><p>Draco didn’t miss the odd look she gave him. So what if he was still on the shorter side. He and Harry had been the same height for years until that damn Gryffindor presented as alpha during their sixth year. Both he and that stupid redheaded Weasel presented as alphas. It made Draco furious. How dare they present before he did. And alphas at that. At the very least, Weasly should have been a beta. </p><p>It didn’t take long for Draco’s robes to be finished and ordered. His mother ensured that he got the finest material available. He had to look his best once he presented. Once, he took his place as an alpha prime and made all of house Slytherin, his pseudo pack. So far, not a single omega had presented in the Slytherin house as far as he knew. A few students were no longer with them; transferred to another school or were now home-schooled due to the war, but as far as he knew, the Slytherin house could still hold it’s head up high. Proud of being omega free. </p><p>Draco and his mother spent the rest of the day going from shop to shop, making sure they had everything on his list. By the time they got home, Draco was exhausted. In only a few days, he would be returning to Hogwarts for the last time. One more year of school, and if he were lucky, he would be returning as an alpha. </p><p>~*~</p><p>Like every year before, the sorting hat spoke to them in poems and cryptic messages at the start of the year. Headmistress McGonagall sat tall at the center of the table. Albus Dumbledore still in critical condition at St. Mongo’s. Professor Snape was now the deputy headmaster, but he moved a little slower now due to the scar along his neck and shoulder. It was by his quick wit and anticipation of what the Dark Lord would most likely do that saved his life. Draco was proud of his Godfather. A true alpha prime. </p><p>Now, if only they could move this damn night along, he was tired, hungry, and irritated. Draco swore the anti-scent charms they used in the great hall lacked the usual strength since last year. Perhaps Flitwick was getting too old to do proper magic. It might be time for the old wizard to retire. The whole hall stank of pheromones and Draco had to hold up his hand, covered in his robe’s sleeve, to his face to dampen the combination of smells. Then there was the heat. He looked up and wondered if they were using too many candles as well because he swore it felt too hot in the cavernous room. Draco scoffed quietly into his sleeve. Dumbledore might have been an old geezer with strange candy habits, but at least he could keep the school in order. </p><p>By the time the fresh batch of students was sorted, and dinner served, Draco had about had it. His lackeys, Crabbe, and Goyle were nowhere to be seen, Pansy was too busy trying to eavesdrop on other’s conversations, and Blaise was giving him a look that left him feeling uncomfortable. </p><p>Thankfully they were not required to stay once dinner started, and he wasn’t hungry enough for dessert. Once his plate was mostly clean, he left without a word. His body hurt, probably from the train ride in, and his stomach was upset—stupid house-elves. Probably got a vendetta against Slytherins and poisoned the food. He would have to tell his father in the morning. Until then, his bed was calling him. It had been a long day, and he was tired, hot, and achy. In the morning, he would deal with everyone else. Tonight he would rest. </p><p>Except he found it difficult to sleep. Not when the sheets stuck to his body as if they were soaked. More like his body was soaked. Hot, sweaty, and everything hurt. His neck, his wrists, his thighs, they all hurt. His stomach felt as if it was getting stabbed, twisted, and punched. Even his arse hurt—clenching, empty, slick. </p><p>…</p><p>Draco sat up with a start, eyes wide with realization, right before he doubled over in agonizing pain. He gave a short scream into his pillow, thankful for the silencing charm on his four-post bed. His body covered in sweat, but most of the moisture he felt was between his legs. Sliding down his thighs and between his cheeks. </p><p>No, this couldn’t be happening. Not to him. It wasn’t supposed to happen like this. He was supposed to be an alpha. Not a … </p><p>Not an omega. </p><p>Draco buried his face into his pillowed and cried. </p>
