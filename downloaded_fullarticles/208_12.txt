    <p align="justify">Having a family is still strange to Harry. Well, having a family that <em>loves </em>him is strange. Aunt Petunia was still family after all. Like that bad smell in a bedroom is still there in your memory even after you set the room on fire.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p><p align="justify">Uncle Crowley’s way of speaking is rubbing off on him. Harry grins. <em>Excellent</em>.</p><p align="justify">Although, Harry looks down at the book he’s been reading in the sunshine, Uncle Aziraphale has definitely had an influence on the Indian boy too.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> When he lived with the Dursley’s, Harry’s interest in learning had been… <em>stifled</em>, that’s what Uncle Aziraphale has said. Uncle Crowley had phrased it very definitely but he’d meant the same. Harry being smart with Dudley around was a recipe for disaster so Harry had been <em>not smart</em> even if some of his teachers had seen his intelligence and commented on it at times. They’d usually said things along the lines of “is a smart boy but won’t apply himself” which, whilst definitely true, was annoying since Harry had had more to think about than just applying himself to learning some multiplications. Balancing showing his intelligence with the need to actually eat a meal a day. That sort of thing.</p><p align="justify">Harry doubts his teacher’s ever had to think about that sort of balancing when they made those comments that got him the stink-eye from Uncle Vernon and sent to the cupboard for the night without food.</p><p align="justify">Just a regular day in the life of Pre-Crowley Harry Potter.</p><p align="justify">Harry knows it’s not their fault, really. One person in charge of a class of thirty kids who all needed a lot more attention and supervision than <em>one person can provide</em>. His teachers were—mostly—just as frazzled and stressed about life as Harry was at the age of six when he received a good mark on the latest spelling test that was double digits whilst Dudley’s was single. Yeah. He can’t fault them for not realising the problem with actually praising him to his Aunt and Uncle.</p><p align="justify">He also can’t fault them for not realising that Harry was ruining his education for a <em>very good reason</em>. They’d just thought he was a Problem Child. Like Jimmy in the year below. Harry had heard them talking about Jimmy being disruptive in class and causing trouble and not bothering to do his homework. Jimmy, Harry knew, had problems with reading things because words didn’t make sense to him the way they did to everyone else. Harry had problems with his family. Jimmy had problems with words. Both of them were treated like they were being lazy and not trying on purpose.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p><p align="justify">It wasn’t fair and Harry wonders if someone helped Jimmy like his Uncles helped him. He hopes so. Jimmy was one of the only kids who was nice to Harry whenever they were made to sit in the library at break because they weren’t doing their work.</p><p align="justify">Harry did the work; Dudley just destroyed or stole it but the teachers had Made Up Their Minds about Harry so it didn’t matter what he said to them about it. He figured that out in year two.</p><p align="justify">But his family now, the family Harry had <em>collected</em>, were worth every minute of being treated like a Problem Child, like a distraction, like a <em>freak</em>, because he was loved now and Harry knows that love is something more precious than anything people can make or buy.</p><p align="justify">Harry has money from his parents but it was their love that saved him. He has wealth but it’s the love from his Uncles, his godparents, his friends, that gives Harry a reason to live. Without them he’d just have money.</p><p align="justify">Money can’t buy him the love he has even if it might buy him some happiness. Like the newest Quidditch kit for the Irish team that’s just come out. Money can <em>definitely</em> buy him that, Harry looks at the book grinning. It can <em>also </em>buy him tickets to see the upcoming Quidditch Cup Final too. For his entire family. Money can’t buy Harry love but he can definitely use it to <em>show </em>his love.</p><p align="justify">Ron will love it. He’s been raving about the Bulgarian Seeker in his letters for weeks now. Harry bets his friend will faint when Harry’s latest letter arrives with the tickets in it. The parchment beside him flutters in the light breeze and Harry looks at it, seeing the ink has dried on his potions essay. He rolls it up quickly and slips it in the bag on his other side.</p><p align="justify">All his homework is done and now he can keep reading his book.</p><p align="justify">Rincewind has just seen Death in Morpork with the Luggage. Harry wants to read what happened <em>after</em> and with his homework done, the thirteen year old can do so without feeling guilty later when Uncle Aziraphale asks about his homework.</p><p align="justify">Which, of course, is when he gets called inside by Uncle Crowley.</p><p align="justify">“Harry!” Crowley bellows from inside the bookshop. “Come here!”</p><p align="justify">Harry wants to shout back ‘why’ because he really, really wants to read the rest of Discworld series before the end of the summer and Uncle Crowley is <em>not </em>helping that desire. He doesn’t shout back ‘why’ however, because Uncle Aziraphale taught him manners and he wasn’t raised in a barn—both his Uncle declared that a barn would have been preferable to the Dursley’s and Harry agrees—so Harry drags himself from his comfy spot outside and trudge inside the bookshop.</p><p align="justify">“What is it, Uncle Crowley?” Harry asks the moment he sees his Uncle on the ground floor of the bookshop. His Uncle, it appears, is looking intently at a book Harry vaguely remembers seeing in <em>Flourish and Blotts </em>the last time they went to<em> Diagon Alley</em>. Something about the book is rather strange, though Harry isn’t at all sure what it is. “What are you reading?”</p><p align="justify">Uncle Crowley looks up from the book, blinks furiously and Harry can see his pupils shrinking back to their usual thinness. Uncle Crowley doesn’t read too much because of his eyes, Harry knows, but he also knows his Uncle is as well-read as Uncle Aziraphale.</p><p align="justify">“Wanted to ask you a question,” Uncle Crowley says and Harry frowns.</p><p align="justify">Whenever Uncle Crowley wants to <em>just ask a question</em> things tend to get out of hand <em>very</em> quickly. Uncle Aziraphale calls it the Crowley Effect. It was accurately named.</p><p align="justify">“Okay, should I warn Uncle ‘Zira?” Harry asks and Uncle Crowley snorts.</p><p align="justify">“I’m not gonna ask you to rob a bank with me, kiddo.”</p><p align="justify">Harry says nothing. Uncle Crowley had devised an elaborate plot to steal Holy Water back in the 70s according to Uncle Aziraphale so, really, robbing a bank isn’t <em>that</em> beyond belief at this point.</p><p align="justify">“I mean, I could, that’s possible,” Uncle Crowley says and Harry just waits for his Uncle to finish with the little plan-tangent. “Anyway, not important. Wanted to ask you about something else, no theft involved. Promise.”</p><p align="justify">Harry frowns. Somehow, he thinks, that might be worse.</p><p align="justify">“Ohhhkay...”</p><p align="justify">“I—well—I was wondering if you’d—you know—uh,” Uncle Crowley stutters and Harry realises his Uncle is rather nervous right now. “Nevermind, it’s stupid, doesn’t matter.”</p><p align="justify">Scratch that, Harry’s Uncle is <em>very </em>nervous.</p><p align="justify">“Uncle Crowley,” Harry decides to interrupt and Uncle Crowley looks at him. “Whatever it is, I don’t think it’s stupid.”</p><p align="justify">Uncle Crowley gives him a half-smile. “Okay.”</p><p align="justify">Harry smiles at him. “Just ask me, you don’t know what I’ll say if you don’t ask, right?”</p><p align="justify">“Right. Right. Yeah.”</p><p align="justify">Uncle Crowley takes a deep breath and Harry gets that his Uncle is really nervous about something so this question is <em>Important. </em>He doesn’t know what it’s about but he promises himself he’s not going to laugh if it <em>is </em>stupid.</p><p align="justify">“What’syouropinionofmenotbeingyourUncleanymoreandnotheingaheanymore?”</p><p align="justify">“Uh... What?”</p><p align="justify">“See, it’s stupid! Forget I asked!”</p><p align="justify">“Uncle Crowley!” Harry exclaims and Uncle Crowley freezes in the act of trying to shove his way out of the little chair he’s somehow squished himself into. “I didn’t hear what you said! You said it too fast!”</p><p align="justify">“Oh. Sorry.”</p><p align="justify">Harry smiles.</p><p align="justify">“I—uh—I guess I can slow down <em>a bit</em> for you,” Uncle Crowley says like it’s a boon for some hero or other in a story that he’s going to talk at a human speed. Knowing Uncle Crowley, it probably is.</p><p align="justify">“I… what’s your opinion… of me not—uh—being your Uncle anymore?” Uncle Crowley asks and Harry’s whole world comes to a screeching halt.</p><p align="justify">He- Uncle Crowley doesn’t-</p><p align="justify">He doesn’t want Harry anymore.</p><p align="justify">Oh.</p><p align="justify">“I’m not really feeling it anymore, this whole gig,” Uncle Crowley continues, waving a hand at his general self. Harry numbly nods along. “Thinking I need a change. Uh—so would- would you be okay calling me Aunt instead?”</p><p align="justify">Wait. What?</p><p align="justify">Harry blinks. “Aunt?” he repeats, “you—uh—you—oh. <em>Oh</em>.”</p><p align="justify">Uncle Crowley doesn’t want to be an <em>Uncle</em> anymore because he wants to be an <em>Aunt instead.</em></p><p align="justify">Harry can’t help it. He laughs.</p><p align="justify">“Stupid, right, yeah—” Uncle Crowley begins but Harry cuts him off by hugging him. “Oh. Uh.”</p><p align="justify">“I thought you didn’t want me anymore,” Harry says into the sleeve of unc- <em>Aunt </em>Crowley’s coat. “I don’t care if you want to be called Uncle or Aunt because that means you still- you still—”</p><p align="justify">“Oh shit, sorry Harry, I didn’t- that’s not- I didn’t think those words through, did I?” <em>Aunt </em>Crowley sounds sheepish and Harry just hugs <em>her </em>tighter. “I’d never not want you anymore, Harry. I promise you that.”</p><p align="justify">“I believe you,” Harry says into Aunt Crowley’s sleeve and he takes an extra moment to just breathe before he pulls back and looks at his Aunt in the face. “And I’m fine with whatever you want to call yourself <em>Aunt</em>.”</p><p align="justify">The look on Aunt Crowley’s face is so delightful that Harry can truly believe that she used to be an angel like Uncle Aziraphale.</p><p align="justify">It’s positively <em>radiant</em> with joy. And love.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Thanks to the revelation that Sirius Black didn’t murder his parents by betraying them to Voldemort, and thanks to the fact that Remus Lupin was named a second godfather—something his parents decided to do because, as Aunt Crowley put it, <em>to hell with societal expectations</em>—Harry has four adults who care about him and his well-being. They also tend to argue over how much Harry visits Sirius at Grimmauld Place considering the godawful state the place is in.</p><p align="justify">Harry is just happy he has adults arguing over wanting to spend time with him and not the reverse.</p><p align="justify">Aunt Crowley and Uncle Aziraphale only agree in the end for Harry to stay with Sirius and Remus under the condition that they clean out Sirius’s home. Remus, to Harry’s amusement, immediately agreed to that condition before Sirius could even open his mouth.</p><p align="justify">“I guess I’m out-numbered then,” Sirius says, and Harry can hear the amusement in his godfather’s voice even if he can’t actually <em>see</em> him, hidden as he is by the wall Harry’s totally not hiding behind to eavesdrop.</p><p align="justify">“Is it even being out-numbered when you hate the state of Grimmauld Place more than I do?” Remus retorts and, yes, Harry <em>definitely</em> knows Remus is as amused as Sirius. “You curse the state of the kitchen more than I do after a full moon.”</p><p align="justify">“You curse the kitchen after you’ve transformed?” Aunt Crowley asks, “it annoys you that much?”</p><p align="justify">“The wall behind the stove is black with soot, and it always ends up in my tea,” Remus answers and he sounds <em>aggrieved</em> just thinking about it. Harry thinks the word definitely fits Remus’s tone right now, especially considering how much Remus seems to love tea.</p><p align="justify">Almost as much as Uncle Aziraphale, actually.</p><p align="justify">“A travesty,” Aunt Crowley drawls and Harry grins. “Well angel, guess we’ve got a house to clean! Can’t have Harry drinking <em>sooty tea</em>.”</p><p align="justify">Harry’s grin softens to a smile at his Aunt's tone. Although she sounds mocking, there’s a real undercurrent of tenderness in her voice. Harry loves that he can pick it up without needing to read it in her face.</p><p align="justify">“Of course, dear,” Uncle Aziraphale agrees easily. There’s a tenderness in his voice too.</p><p align="justify">It all makes Harry honestly so thankful that Aunt Crowley was there that day, years ago, and decided to interfere with Dudley’s bullying. If not for that… Harry knows he’d still be stuck with the Dursleys.</p><p align="justify">A fate he honestly considers worse than death.</p><p align="justify">“Harry you can stop eavesdropping now!” Remus calls out and Harry startles. “I can hear your heartbeat.”</p><p align="justify">“What?” Harry looks dumbly at Remus as he walks into the kitchen. Sirius, Aunt Crowley, and Uncle Aziraphale are all watching him and Remus with varying expressions. Sirius’s shows his obvious joy and enjoyment at Harry being caught by Remus. Aunt Crowley’s is her typical Look that’s coloured with amusement at his situation. Uncle Aziraphale’s is that surprised look he gets when something happens that he’s only a <em>little </em>bit surprised by.</p><p align="justify">They all knew he was there. Not at the same moment, no, but they all figured out he was listening to them and only Remus has felt the need to call out to him.</p><p align="justify">Harry isn’t sure he should be pleased by that or annoyed. He opts instead to be confused at Remus’s statement.</p><p align="justify">“Lycan,” is Remus’s simple response and Harry blushes.</p><p align="justify">“Oh.”</p><p align="justify">Aunt Crowley’s Look becomes a Smirk. Harry blushes harder.</p><p align="justify">Remus has known he was there the moment he decided to eavesdrop. Harry wishes the ground to open up and swallow him whole, but it doesn’t—fortunately—and instead he seats himself at the table, resigning himself to being given amused looks for his embarrassment as the adults return to discussing Grimmauld Place.</p><p align="justify">It’s quickly decided that Aunt Crowley and Uncle Aziraphale will take it in turns to sort out individual rooms at Grimmauld Place until the entire house is clean and free of dark objects. Aunt Crowley takes the first visit, citing her inability to be harmed by dark objects unlike Uncle Aziraphale. Harry spends the next few days in the alternating company of his Aunt and Uncle until Sirius shows up with a wide grin on his face and drops a motorbike helmet into Harry’s lap.</p><p align="justify">“Come on!” Sirius jerks his head at the bookshop doors. “You’re spending the next week with me and Remus!”</p><p align="justify">“Your house is clean then?” Harry asks, grinning widely as he fastens the straps on the helmet. It’s not the same sort of helmet he’d expect Sirius to own—more like the kind of helmet you’d wear on a bicycle—but he has no doubt it’s charmed to protect his head more effectively than any muggle variant.</p><p align="justify">“Completely! Crowley signed off on the last room yesterday, Remus wouldn’t let me tell you until today though,” Sirius explains, jumping onto the bike and kicking it to life as Harry clambers into the sidecar.</p><p align="justify">“Why not?” Harry’s question is nearly drowned out by the roaring engine, but Sirius responds to it, so his godfather obviously still heard him.</p><p align="justify">“Had to conjure furniture!” Sirius shouts over the engine, “most of it was cursed!”</p><p align="justify">Harry nods and settles in to the sidecar as Sirius lets the bike start moving. He gradually notices his godfather opening the throttle more and more quickly until they’re blitzing their way through Soho and out toward Sirius’s townhouse. He grins widely, feeling the wind rushing past him and Harry can’t help the urge to raise his arms and let out a whoop of exhilaration.</p><p align="justify">Sirius grins at him and laughs, the sound swallowed by the noise of traffic and the speed they’re going at.</p><p align="justify">It’s not the same as flying on his broom but, for Harry, the experience is just as great.</p><p align="justify">Grimmauld Place is large and much more inviting than Harry imagines it probably was originally, especially since Sirius seems to stare at an empty space of wall in the entrance hall for a long moment before leading the way to the kitchen. Remus is sat at a well-worn, oak-wood table that has bench seats instead of individual chairs, and the lycan smiles happily at Harry when he enters the kitchen.</p><p align="justify">“Hello Harry,” Remus says, rising to his feet and giving Harry a hug when Harry raises a hand in greeting. The hug is a little unexpected for Remus, but Harry goes with it and can’t help but savor the feeling of affection the contact elicits. He doesn’t really get hugged enough to make up for nine years of being starved of affection.</p><p align="justify">“Hi, Remus,” Harry replies when he steps away from the lycan who smiles at him. Remus looks far more comfortable and relaxed than Harry can recall seeing him. At Hogwarts, Remus had seemed to be almost always tired and stressed out. Now he seems like he’s actually thirty-five and not sixty-five. “I bet your tea is much better now?”</p><p align="justify">Remus laughs. “Definitely,” he nods. “We’ve been conjuring furniture since your Aunt left yesterday and the sootless tea has definitely made that an easier endeavour.”</p><p align="justify">“I bet!”</p><p align="justify">“Want to see your room?” Sirius asks, handing Harry a bottle of water from the fridge-freezer that the boy has just noticed is installed in the kitchen—it looks too new to have been there before, especially since Harry knows Sirius hasn’t lived in this house in years and it probably didn’t have a fridge-freezer when he did as a teenager. Not with his parents being pureblood extremists.</p><p align="justify">“I have a room here?” Harry asks and it probably sounds stupid to Sirius and Remus, but he’s surprised by the idea. “Cool!”</p><p align="justify">“Of course, you do,” Remus says, nudging Sirius in the arm and Sirius leads the way out of the kitchen. “We’re hoping you don’t hate the furniture choices and you can choose what colours to paint the walls.”</p><p align="justify">Harry doesn’t hate the room. He loves it. The furniture is simple and clearly recent additions to the room considering the fact that Harry can feel the fresh magic on the objects. It’s great though and he says as much while Sirius and Remus watch him peruse the room. They both seem pleased at his happiness with the room, but Sirius insists that Harry needs to have things for the room and that ends up with the three of them spending the rest of the day in muggle London.</p><p align="justify">Harry likes shopping with Sirius and Remus even if he has to explain what credit-cards are to his godfather. Remus is smart enough to use cash instead of card and understands muggle currency, saving Sirius from giving the confused shop assistant double the total cost of the clothing in one shop and short-changing another in the shop with rugs and curtains and the like.</p><p align="justify">The end of their trip is that Harry has a fully kitted-out bedroom at Grimmauld Place that even has a bloody <em>computer </em>in it—which is just bizarre since it runs on magic and Sirius banished all the cables. When Harry returns to the bookshop, he has a backpack full of some of the most random things he’d seen that Sirius had thrown into the shopping trolley the moment he’d noticed Harry looking vaguely interested in them. Explaining the contents to Aunt Crowley proves to be an exercise in pointlessness because she just keeps laughing at the rubber duck Harry pulls out. He leaves it with her at the kitchen table, smiling in amused exasperation, at her reaction.</p><p align="justify">“I forgot about her thing for ducks,” Harry mutters to himself, flopping down on his bed and staring at the ceiling.</p><p align="justify"><em>“I think I should ask for a pet duck next,”</em> he says, tilting his head to look at Monty curled up on his pillow, <em>“do you think she’d like that?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Ducks taste good,”</em> Monty replies and Harry grimaces.</p><p align="justify"><em>“Not getting a pet duck then,”</em> he decides, idly stroking Monty’s head and making the snake’s eyes close in blissful delight. <em>“Maybe a swan?”</em></p><p align="justify">Monty opens his eyes. <em>“Evil thingssss.”</em></p><p align="justify">Harry laughs.</p><p align="justify">The image of Aunt Crowley’s wings flashes in his mind. Although they were insanely large and amazingly intimidating, Harry still thinks of swans when he thinks back to the sight of them. A black swan. Uncle Aziraphale has the same sort of wings, though Aunt Crowley’s are somewhat larger, and Harry smiles.</p><p align="justify">He has the metaphysical equivalent of two swans as adopted parents. That probably makes him the ugly duckling. Harry laughs again. “Maybe I’m the pet duck.”</p><p align="justify">A little duckling with two swan parents, one dog godfather, and one lycan godfather. In this metaphor, Harry should probably pity any predators looking at him like a tasty little meal. In this metaphor, of course, pity is not afforded to those predators because it’s their own damned fault if they try and take a baby from <em>swans</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/>

Or, more aptly, gods help the Ministry of Magic because this is a Harry Potter who definitely isn’t going to take the crap they’ll try and give him later on. Not that anyone is aware of what is going to happen except, perhaps, the one who set it all in motion with a rather arbitrary ‘I wonder what it’d be like if there was life besides myself in this empty space?’ and promptly caused absolute <em>chaos </em>in the cosmos.</p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn3">[3]</a> There’d been <em>one</em> teacher who hadn’t been like that with Jimmy, just one. Harry had liked her. Mrs Shield. She hadn’t stayed at the school long enough to really be any good for Harry but he still remembers her with a bit of fondness. If she’d stuck around, Harry feels that she might have done something about his Aunt and Uncle's treatment of him if he’d told her. She struck him as the sort of adult to do something and not just ignore it. Like Uncle Crowley. Although… Uncle Crowley tends to pretend he’s not that sort of adult in the first place. <em>I’m a demon</em>, he always insists. Demons don’t do <em>nice things</em>. Uncle Crowley is more than just a demon though, even if he doesn’t like to admit it. That’s why Harry loves him.</p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn4">[4]</a> This is entirely sappy. Cry tears of love, you cowards.</p>
