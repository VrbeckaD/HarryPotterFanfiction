    <p>“Have you seen her yet?”</p>
<p>James, who was staring out the giant windows at the sprawling view of Dorset, glanced back at Sam Griffiths.</p>
<p>James shook his head in response and turned to survey the clusters of people around him. The death of Ernest Greengrass was completely unexpected, and it seemed as if everyone at his funeral was more curious about the cause of his death than grieving over his untimely departure.</p>
<p>However, James felt differently. Though he wasn’t particularly fond of the old sod, he worried about the state of his team now that Ernest decided to snuff it right as the season was about to start. According to the many rumours surrounding Greengrass’s early departure, the middle-aged man left his Quidditch team (and the majority of his vast fortune) to his young widow. Only a small percent of his money was gifted to his nephew, Severus Snape. James frowned at the thought. He liked Snape even less than he liked Greengrass, but at least he rested easy knowing that Snape understood Quidditch. The same could not be said about the Greengrass widow.</p>
<p>James looked down at Sam again. Sam was the newest addition to the front Puddlemere team. The young chaser was becoming a fan favourite, much to his delight and everyone else’s ire. The Griffiths were an old Quidditch family, and the last five generations in Sam’s family played professional Quidditch. However, that did not stop him from being a complete idiot.</p>
<p>“I heard the widow was a lady of the night, if you catch my meaning,” Sam said, tugging on the sleeves of his dress robes. “Maybe that’s how Greengrass keeled over, he finally saw a bird naked.”</p>
<p>James grinned. It was no secret that Ernest Greengrass had very little interest in women, or anyone for that matter. The only thing that he showed a semblance of interest in was Quidditch, which was why everyone assumed that the team and his fortune would go to this next of kin- who might be an absolute penis but at least understood Quidditch and was passionate about the sport. This all changed about a year ago, when Greengrass eloped with a much younger woman. No one knew much about her, even though Greengrass wasn’t particularly modest. James had always thought that he would want to show off his trophy wife, but Greengrass surprised everyone by keeping a very low profile since his marriage.</p>
<p>“What are you two gossiping about?” The two Puddlemere beaters, Rick and Hasan, came towards James and Sam in the corner.</p>
<p>“The new widow Greengrass,” James replied, “Have you seen her yet?”</p>
<p>Hasan shook his head, “Not today mate. I did meet her a few months ago, though.”</p>
<p>That got the other men’s attention. “When was this?” James frowned. Surely as Captain, he should have been acquainted with the team owner’s wife.</p>
<p>“It must have been when they first got married.” Hasan shrugged. “About a year ago? I was taking my little boy to get his broom and we wandered off to Muggle London for a walk. They were sat at a caf right outside.”</p>
<p>“What was she like?” Sam leaned in excitedly and almost knocked over an imposing plant.</p>
<p>“Really fit, sort of what you’d expect.” Hasan shrugged. “She was really friendly though, gave my boy a kiss and a cuddle.”</p>
<p>“I would be really friendly too if I’d just married a millionaire.” Rick snorted. “Is she a muggle then?”</p>
<p>“Don’t know.” Hasan replied. “It’s not something I go about asking people I just met.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure she’s fit?” Sam’s eyes narrowed. “I always thought he kept her hidden because she’s ugly.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he was embarrassed,” James shrugged. “I would be if someone married me for money.”</p>
<p>“That’s the only reason someone would marry you, you ugly mug.” Sam replied.</p>
<p>Their laughter was cut short when Coach Devrill came towards them with a frown. “May I remind you gentlemen that we are in a wake.”</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Lily did not need reminding that she was in a wake, not with Petunia breathing down her neck.</p>
<p>“Honestly,” Petunia glared at Lily’s reflection in the mirror. “I don’t understand what is wrong with the dress I got you.”</p>
<p>“I told you,” Lily uttered for the tenth time. “It’s black.”</p>
<p>“<em>Exactly </em> ,” Petunia grimaced. “You’re at your husband’s <em> funeral </em>. You cannot dress like that.”</p>
<p>“I told you,” Lily rolled her eyes and surveyed herself in the mirror again, “It’s what he wanted.”</p>
<p>Lily remembered the conversation like it was yesterday. They had just come home from the private hospital Ernest was being treated at, and he was watching her get undressed. They were both so emotionally tired, and Lily’s eyes felt puffy from crying.  “Promise me something,” He had said as she slipped off her dress, his eyes sparkling with so much affection that she almost started crying again. “In my funeral, I want you to wear something my mother would hate.”</p>
<p>Lily had laughed, “Your mother would hate it if I simply came to your funeral, it wouldn’t matter what I wore.”</p>
<p>“Even still,” Ernest had reached out and took her hand. “Wear something outrageous.”</p>
<p>Lily smiled at the memory. She wasn’t sure how outrageous Ernest or his mother would find her outfit, but she knew he would like it. She opted to wear a muggle dress instead of the traditional wizard dress robes. It was form fitting and sleeveless, a deep burgundy that was a few shades darker than her red hair. The dress left very little to the imagination, and Lily felt slightly self-conscious as she saw how the fabric hugged her curves, but it was the least she could do, really. Ernest- sweet, loving Ernest, rarely asked anything of her, and she would not have been able to live with herself if she did not give him this one thing.</p>
<p>“You look like a trollop.” Petunia sneered, and Lily grinned at her sister in the mirror.</p>
<p>“Tell me how you really feel, Tuney.”</p>
<p>Petunia flushed, seemingly regretting her outburst. “I just don’t want you to be embarrassed.”</p>
<p>Petunia had adored Ernest, in a way that completely surprised Lily. Tuney, who had criticised every other aspect of Lily’s life saw a stabilizing force in Ernest despite being a wizard. Maybe it was the money, or that Ernest had sought out Petunia’s approval with a force that both flattered and slightly repulsed Lily, but she was certain that Ernest’s death shocked her sister more so than her.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s too late to change now.” Lily shook her head at the mirror. “Ready?”</p>
<p>“No,” Petunia sulked. “I don’t understand how cavalier you’re being about this. You just buried your husband.”</p>
<p>“Yes I am aware thank you.” Lily gritted her teeth, resisting the urge to shout. It wasn’t Tuney’s fault. Lily took a deep breath and swept past Petunia to the door. Downstairs, a couple hundred people waited for her entrance, probably gossiping about her and Ernest’s relationship before the dust settled on his grave.</p>
<p>Lily made her way down the staircase, pausing for only a second before nodding at the awaiting house elf to open the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>James turned as the doors to the large reception room opened, and his eyes immediately narrowed. He had a flashback to the Muggle film he and Sirius went to see a year ago, with the drawn rabbit and the human man, and the rabbit’s curvy wife. She even wore a red dress like the animated woman.</p>
<p>“Crikey,” muttered Rick beside James.</p>
<p>Crikey was right, James thought, and his eyes narrowed even further. By all accounts, James had a great sense of humour. It was one of the things people first mentioned about him. In fact, it was what was declared on the cover of the Modern Witch that was still mockingly hung up on Remus’ wall, “James Potter- Big Laughs, Bigger Broomstick.” Still, the one thing he did not find remotely humorous was Quidditch, and if that woman was now in charge of his team, James cringed, then Merlin help them all.</p>
<p>“Well, what are you waiting for, lads?” Sam grinned wickedly and marched towards the back of the line that formed in front of Ms. Greengrass. James trailed behind his team mates, a sense of dread settling in the pit of his stomach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mrs Greengrass, I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr Greengrass was a great man and he will be missed.”</p>
<p>Lily smiled at the young, blonde man stood in front of her. “Thank you, that’s very nice of you to say. And you are?”</p>
<p>The man looked surprised, and for the umpteenth time Lily felt a tinge of embarrassment. After they married, Ernest and she agreed that she did not want anything to do with the wizarding world, let alone his work. It was for the best, as it only brought back memories Lily did not wish to recall. Still, she wished that she took more of an interest in Puddlemere United. Everyone assumed she was an idiot, and her not knowing Jack from Jill was only hurting her.</p>
<p>“I’m Sam Griffiths, ma’am.” Ma’am, like she was the bloody Queen. “I play for Puddlemere. I’m a chaser.”</p>
<p>“Right, of course.” Lily trilled, like the idiot trollop they all thought she was. “I’m so sorry, I’m only just getting used to all of this. So, you… chase the ball. Balls?”</p>
<p>Sam grinned, and she found herself warming to him despite the topic of conversation. “Ball, and I score the goals as well.”</p>
<p>“Well, you must be very good then.” Lily leaned in and smiled. “I hadn’t heard Ernest complain about you once."</p>
<p>“Now that surprises me,” Sam’s grin widened. “I’m a known troublemaker.”</p>
<p>“Not to me, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>Petunia cleared her throat loudly and shot Sam a withering look, “You need to keep the line moving, Lily.”</p>
<p>“That’s a shame,” Lily pouted playfully at Sam, “I’m sure I will see you soon.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you should spend more time learning the rules of Quidditch instead of flirting with the players.” A loud voice boomed.</p>
<p>Lily’s eyes widened at the man standing behind Sam. He was tall and lean, his hair a wild dark mop and his mouth set in a grim line.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Lily bristled, “How dare you-”</p>
<p>“How dare I what? Say what everyone else was thinking?” The man practically growled.</p>
<p>Lily unfortunately had the habit of crying when she was angry. In fact, being quite an emotional person she cried at any spike in her emotions, whether positive or negative. Right then, she felt her eyes moisten almost immediately, and her nostrils flared as she tried to control her expression. “You have no idea what you’re talking about,” she spat.</p>
<p>“I always know what I’m talking about, unlike you.” The man squared his shoulders and looked down at her. He was trying to intimidate her, Lily realised.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who you think you are-”</p>
<p>Again, he interrupted her, and Lily’s eyes burned with angry unshed tears. “My name is Potter, something you should have realised since I am the captain of your team.”</p>
<p>“Right, we will see about that.” Lily felt a tear finally drop on her cheek, and she turned away to leave. She paused only briefly when she say Severus staring at her from across the room, his arms folded and his expression livid.</p>
<p>“Lily! Oh for Heaven’s sake.” Petunia yelled, chasing behind her as she made her way out the reception room and up the stairs.</p>
