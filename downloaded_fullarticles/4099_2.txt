    <p>Scorpius Malfoy stands outside the Manor, his stomach roiling from Apparition and his heart beating rapidly from the anticipation of grief. He's not sure what will be worse—if he's too late, or if his mother is still alive and he has to watch her die.</p><p>He sucks in a shaky breath and walks quickly towards the door. </p><p>The Manor looms above him, and he looks up briefly at the house he grew up in, squinting at the stone turrets in the late-day sun. He reaches the stately steps, and the doors open to reveal his father. Draco's posture is too good; his eyes are too dry; his robes are too immaculate. Scorpius runs up the last few steps and wraps his father in a hug.</p><p>"Dad," he says.</p><p>Draco reaches a strong hand to Scorpius's shoulders and pulls him close. "She doesn't look very well. You should prepare yourself."</p><p>Scorpius doesn't have anything to say to that. </p><p>Draco pulls out of the hug and walks briskly through the front hall, his dragonhide boots clicking on the marble floor as he leads Scorpius to Astoria's rooms. </p><p>Scorpius usually chatters incessantly whenever he visits the Manor or sees his parents, but right now he has nothing to say. Neither does Draco, it seems. Even Scorpius's favourite Malfoy ancestral paintings are quiet. Ordinarily they launch into a retelling of all notable events Scorpius has missed in his absence; today, they only offer encouraging, pitying smiles that increase the sense of otherworldly foreboding. </p><p>When they arrive at the doors to Astoria's rooms, Draco stops. "Scorpius, are you—. Do you need—."</p><p>Draco seems not to know what he wants to say, which is remarkable in itself. Scorpius spares a moment to marvel at the fact that Draco, about to lose his wife of thirty-three years, still has the wherewithal to attempt to parent his grown son. </p><p>"I'm fine, Dad. It's—we'll be okay." Scorpius steps in front of Draco and opens the door. </p><p>Astoria is in bed, three house-elves scurrying around her. Her hair, which has always been a beautiful mass of thick brown, lies thin and limp on the pillow. Her cheeks are sallow, her lips dry and cracked. She wheezes when she breathes.</p><p>Dying, apparently, robs one's good looks before it robs one's final breath.</p><p>"Mum," Scorpius says, reaching the bed in two long strides and falling to his knees. He takes hold of her hand, and it's the feel of her hand in his that finally breaks his defences; tears begin to stream down his cheeks. </p><p>He's surprised he kept it together this long, really.</p><p>She turns her head to get a better look at him, and her facial expressions aren't right at all—the blood curse has stolen her characteristic smiles and knowing looks, her shrewd, humorous gaze. But when he looks deep into her eyes, he can just detect that spark that's still <i>her. </i></p><p>She manages a small smile. "Scorpius," she says. She doesn't sound like herself; the voice is wheezy, but at least she knows it's him. "Come to my arms, my beamish boy."</p><p>If he wasn't already crying, he'd have started now. "Mum." He gives her a watery smile. "Mum. O frabjous day." </p><p>She smiles when he answers her as he should.</p><p>And in Scorpius's despair, he starts to laugh that desperate, anxious laugh that only sounds in the worst of times—because the day is anything but frabjous.</p><p>Scorpius feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up. Draco is standing there, guiding him into a chair that one of the house-elves Conjured.</p><p>"I'll give you two a chance to—I'll give you a few minutes," Draco says. "I'll be just outside if you need me."</p><p>The door closes, and Scorpius is still holding onto his mother's hand. The phrase "holding on for dear life" pops into his brain, and he stares at her hand.</p><p>He supposes now is the moment he's supposed to say goodbye. But what can he possibly say? There's no way to sum up neatly thirty-one years of their mother-son relationship. There's nothing to <i>say. </i></p><p>"Mum. I love you. I love you so much."</p><p>"I love you, too," she returns. </p><p>Goodness, she sounds awful. Scorpius looks around at the house-elves who are attending her, the specially trained house-elves that come at times like these. Deaths. Births. They don't seem concerned at her voice.</p><p>"Are you in pain?" he asks.</p><p>"Mr Malfoy," one of the house-elves answers, "she is on potions for pain. She will ease out of this world in comfort."</p><p>Scorpius turns back to his mother, squeezes her warm hand.</p><p>"I have to tell you something," she rasps. </p><p>"No, no, shhhhh," Scorpius says, smoothing a hand down her hair, pushing it away from her face.</p><p>"No," she says, more forcefully, and Scorpius looks up at her eyes. "I have to tell you something. I should've told you before." She coughs.</p><p>Scorpius tries to see two things at once: the visage in front of him, but also beyond the blood curse to her real, healthy self. He tries to imagine the honeyed tones of her voice the way it sounds when she sings and laughs.</p><p>"You are my son. My everything." </p><p>Scorpius's tears stream off his cheeks, hitting his robes.</p><p>"But we are not blood related."</p><p>He blinks, looks up at her brown eyes. "What?"</p><p>She coughs again. "Your father slept with another man and became pregnant with you."</p><p>"What?" he repeats, his face blank. "What?"</p><p>"It's magic," she says and tries to smile, but her eyes don't twinkle the way they did when she used to say those words in response to his wonder as a small child. "We're not blood related." She smiles. "It never changed how I felt about you."</p><p>Her words make no sense, but Scorpius can't think about it right now.  Right now all he can think about is making sure that she knows before it's too late. "Mum, I love you." He takes a deep breath and tries to imbue his next words with enough emotion to express what he wants to say, that which no words could ever capture. "<i>Thank you.</i>"</p><p>She smiles briefly, but then she's overcome with a wheezing fit that brings the house-elves scuttling over to cast spells at her. He squeezes her hand, whispering, "I love you, thank you, I love you, thank you," as the door opens and Draco enters.</p><p>"You're not trying to prolong her life with those spells, are you?" Draco anxiously asks the nearest house-elf. "We don't want to extend her pain."</p><p>"No, Mr Malfoy, sir," the elf replies. "We is easing her passage only."</p><p>Draco nods, and stands there looking like he has no idea what to do. Scorpius pulls his wand and Conjures a chair on the other side of the bed. Draco nods again, walks around the bed, and sits.</p><p>Scorpius looks at his mother's hand in his and has the thought that he'll stay right here, he'll be with her like this when she dies.</p><p>Astoria is past the point of speech, sucking in rattling breaths that actually sound like death. He has a million questions for her, wants to hear her read a million more poems, wants to dance with her at a hundred more of his grandmother's stuffy balls.</p><p>They all sit in silence but for Astoria's wheezing, rattling respiration. Scorpius has no idea how much time is passing. It could be minutes or hours.</p><p>Scorpius looks across the bed at his father. Draco is tired, stiff, like he has no idea what type of behaviour is expected of him. He <i>always</i> knows what type of behaviour is expected of him. It's one of the things Scorpius admires most about him, the way he makes his way through the world with such ease, even after his tumultuous past.</p><p>He looks at his mother's contorted face. Could what she said possibly be true? His brain starts to whir.</p><p>But that would mean that—that he isn't in danger of this horrible blood curse manifesting in him. The Healers suspect that it manifests mostly in witches, but no one is really sure what the mechanism is, so he'd always thought there was a chance it could hit him. And while the Healers had managed to delay the onset of the curse in Astoria, giving her a full life until age fifty-five, there is no cure. </p><p>But if she isn't his blood relation, there is no chance of him having the curse. That is actually…a huge relief. And how <i>awful</i> to feel relief at time like this. </p><p>And this means—it means that Daphne is not his aunt, that the Greengrasses are not his grandparents. Not by blood, anyway. They've all been lying to him for his whole life.</p><p>His dad had been with a man. And because his parents had been married a year and a half before he was born, that means his dad had been with a man while married to his mum. <i>Oh. </i>Draco and Astoria had moved to France when she—he!—was pregnant with him. <i>Oh!</i></p><p>Scorpius stares at his mother, then turns to look at his father. Oh, Merlin. How is he supposed to deal with all of this at once? Screw them for not telling him!</p><p>But also, of course, he understands. They must have been scared of the social reaction, of the prejudice against wizards who become pregnant. A wizard becoming pregnant hasn't been grounds for losing legal standing in over a hundred years, not since the abolition of couverture in the nineteenth century, of course, but public opinion lags behind the law. His parents would not have wanted to deal with that, or for Scorpius to have to deal with that. They had always tried to raise him in a new world without prejudice and hatred. Things would've been harder for him if everyone knew, if kids had made fun of him and his father.</p><p>Holy shit. He has a father—a different father. <i>Who? </i>Is Draco gay? Scorpius has always wondered. His parents clearly loved each other but never seemed to have any sexual relationship. They'd always had separate rooms. He'd never even seen them kiss. He'd never seen a spark in either of their eyes—</p><p>So who is his other father? Holy shit!</p><p>His mind is going crazy, the shock of his mother's impending death mixing with the shock of this news is causing him to embark on wild speculation when really he should just ask. He should just ask. His father is right there. </p><p>He looks up, about to say something, to ask his father, but Draco is crying. Scorpius closes his mouth. </p><p>Has he ever seen Draco cry? He tries to remember. It's not right. </p><p>It's not right, and his whole world is crumbling. His mother is dying, is not related to him. His father was pregnant with him. If someone walked in and told him that the house-elf casting spells at Astoria was his real father, in this state he'd probably take the news in stride.</p><p>He can't add to his father's stress today. He can't make Draco talk about these secrets right now. They need to concentrate on Astoria, on making sure she knows how loved she is as she leaves the world.</p><p>Scorpius grasps her hands tightly. </p><p>"Excuse me," Draco says—Scorpius realises that Draco must not remember the elf's name because he always refers to elves by name, but there have been so many elves in recent weeks—and one of the elves stops his work. "How long….?" Draco continues, gesturing at his wife.</p><p>"It's impossible to say, sir, unless you are liking to sign the paperwork to administer the potion."</p><p>Scorpius chokes in a huff of air and feels like he's swallowing his larynx. </p><p>"I—" Draco says, and Scorpius stares at him in wonder as he realises that Draco has no idea what to do. His father always knows what to do.</p><p>"Master," the elf continues. "If I may. Sometimes people is not able to be letting go until their loved ones leave the room."</p><p>Draco looks up and Scorpius has the sudden and somewhat unwelcome feeling that he is completely grown up. Draco is looking at him not because he has to, but because he actually wants to know what Scorpius thinks they should do. Because he and Scorpius are in this together. </p><p>Being an adult sucks.</p><p>Scorpius stands, leans over the bed, and kisses his mother's cheek. Her cheek doesn't feel right; it's supposed to feel plump and welcoming. "I love you," he says one last time. "Goodbye."</p><p>He can hardly believe he managed to force that word from his lips.</p><p>Scorpius wills himself to drop her hand and reach out to his father. </p><p>Draco stands and presses a kiss to Astoria's forehead. Then he turns to Scorpius with a broken look on his face that Scorpius has never seen before, grasps his son's hand, and they walk out of the room.</p>
<hr/><p>Scorpius tries to talk to Draco the next day, but the Manor is a flurry of alighting relatives and funeral preparations, so Scorpius says nothing and acts as host at supper.</p><p>He tries to talk to Draco the evening after the funeral, but Draco hands him a tumbler of Firewhiskey and sits in silence in front of the fire, so Scorpius sits next to him on the sofa and drinks in silence.</p><p>Scorpius tries to talk to Draco when all the hubbub is over, but Draco has buried himself in paperwork that is probably unnecessary, so Scorpius walks behind the desk chair, wraps his father in a hug, and goes home.</p><p>His flat feels small and empty after his time at the Manor, and reminders of his mother are everywhere—the book on the coffee table, the mirror in the corridor, the dragon figurine on the mantel. </p><p>He'd known his mother was dying long before it happened, so he'd processed much of his grief months ago. He doesn't feel denial or anger or any of those other things. He feels grateful that the worst of it was short-lived, that he's seen her so often these past months. </p><p>But just like that, he has no mother. No one to owl about funny things that happen, no one to buy books for in Muggle used bookshops. It's just—over.</p><p>Still, he thinks he's handling his mother's death extremely well. </p><p>But the news she'd dropped on him? <i>That </i>he is still processing. </p><p>Scorpius finds himself thinking that the news about his paternity shouldn't change much, he should just say "okay" and move on, because a detail as small as sperm origin can't possibly erase thirty-one years of lived experience. Astoria is his mother. </p><p>But he still wants to know. He needs to understand. His father has always been such an enigma, so loving and supportive, but also so closed off about so many things. It makes sense now, he supposes.</p><p>Scorpius walks into the kitchen and puts the kettle on for tea. He selects a bag of earl grey (another reminder of Astoria and her bergamot-scented shortbread) and leans against the counter.</p><p>The thing that stings is that Draco never told him. Didn't he know that Scorpius would always love them and that nothing could change that? Why had they felt they needed to live such a big lie for so long? Scorpius has always considered himself the kind of person who is understanding and accepting and easy to talk to.</p><p>He walks into the corridor and looks into the mirror his mother had bought him in Italy. He stares at his face—maybe if he stares hard enough, he can figure out what bits are from a stranger. But no, he just looks like Scorpius. Blond hair like his father and grandfather. Pointy nose. Grey eyes like his father but with some specks of green. His face is rounder than Draco's or Lucius's, his skin a couple shades darker. The stubble on his face is thicker than his father's, and darker, not that Scorpius has ever really seen his father with facial hair—Draco systematically casts Charms to prevent stubble. Scorpius doesn't, though, and he rubs his fingers across his cheek. </p><p><i>If I were a teenager, </i>he thinks, rubbing his darker-than-blond stubble, <i>I would flop onto my bed and wail, 'Who am I!?' But I'm a grown-up and I'm rational so I'll have to pretend I don't feel like doing just that.</i></p><p>The kettle whistles, and Scorpius turns away from the mirror.</p>
<hr/><p>Two weeks later, Scorpius decides to do the very mature thing and sneak into the Manor when he knows Draco will be at his Hogwarts Board of Governors meeting.</p><p>The Manor is empty except for the house-elves, and Scorpius remembers loving those odd times he found himself home alone when he was younger. He'd blast music in the marble corridors and dance around the house singing. Most of the portraits gave him stern glares, but Brutus Malfoy in the East Wing has a talent for beatboxing and Drizella Malfoy in the corridor near the dining room does an incredible Adele. </p><p>Scorpius smiles despite himself and heads for his father's office. He feels a tiny bit guilty as he stands outside the door, and then he remembers that his parents lied to him for thirty-one years and that he surely has a right to know his own story, and opens the door.</p><p>Scorpius draws his wand. He doesn't know what he's looking for, but there must be <i>something. </i>Healer records, a certificate of birth, magical lineage reports, letters—<i>something. </i></p><p>He smiles, because he's at an enormous advantage. He's an historian, a trained researcher, and knows dozens of Charms for discovering relevant information. Generally he uses these Charms with permission in archives and libraries, so it's a little exciting to be using them without permission in his father's office. </p><p>He decides to start with a Charm that will locate everything related to his birth. It might locate too many things, but it could also locate nothing, so it seems a good place to start. He waves his wand, and beams of purple light shine from a filing cabinet, a drawer, and books on the shelves.</p><p>He sits in Draco's chair and opens the top desk drawer. A stack of magical photos in the back of the drawer draw his eye. Scorpius smiles, pulling them out. A photo of him, just born, blinking his eyes. A photo of Draco and Astoria on a bed, Astoria looking at him as if he's the most amazing thing in the world, and then turning to smile at Draco. A photo (that his grandparents had once thrown a fit over) of Astoria breastfeeding him.</p><p>He's seen all of these photos before. But. He looks more closely, not allowing his eyes to avoid details they've seen before. He looks at Draco. Draco, at twenty-six, looks exhausted, his hair sweaty and slightly stuck to his forehead. Draco's middle is covered by a pillow and Astoria's body, and Scorpius wishes the photo would continue past the point where it loops back to Astoria looking at his baby face.</p><p>Could he really have grown inside Draco? He knows it's possible, of course, if rare. Usually same-sex couples take a regimen of special fertility potions to achieve conception, and witch-witch couples need to do some sort of inseminating procedure with a Healer. But sometimes, rarely, two men with uncommonly compatible magic and histories of pureblood magic to encourage heirs can conceive without the aid of potions. It could have been an accident. <i>He</i> could have been an accident.</p><p>He thinks of what he knows about wizards who have been pregnant. Merlin, why hadn't he thought of this before? Draco has it all: the slightly wider hips than one might expect on a man his stature, the extra fluff around the belly that doesn't exactly seem like fat (nothing like the small belly Lucius developed in later years), the voluptuous butt that had once been called "a pert posterior" by <i>Witch Weekly </i>(Scorpius at thirteen had nightmares for a week). He'd really never seen Draco without a shirt on (and wasn't that a little suspicious? Because they'd been on holiday to places with beaches?), but he bets the reason was Draco's desire to hide a bunch of silvery stretch marks and wrinkled belly skin.</p><p>Scorpius can't help think that is kind of adorable. Draco can be stiff sometimes, and Scorpius loves when things soften his edges.</p><p>He smiles at the photo of Astoria breastfeeding; she looks so happy. Knowing that she took lactation potions makes it somehow seem even sweeter, like the fact that it was a conscious choice made it special. Why did she do that? Did she want to bond with him? Had she been worried Scorpius would reject her? Had she wanted to play a part in his coming into the world?</p><p>Purple light streaming out of the bottom drawer of the desk draws his attention and he replaces the photos in the top drawer. The bottom drawer opens easily but he can't figure out where the light is coming from. It seems to be seeping out of the edge of the drawer. A secret compartment!</p><p>Scorpius presses his lips together. Screw it, he's in too far to stop now. He waves his wand and watches as the secret and, apparently, warded compartment releases under his magic. He leans over, wondering what he'll find in there. More photos—of the actual pregnancy? </p><p>But no, it's just a black leather book. </p><p>Scorpius pulls it out of the drawer, the purple light blinking out as he touches it and turns it over in his hands. </p><p>He opens it up to a random page and begins to read.</p><p>
  <i>23 February 2034. Ernie Macmillan is acting like an utter maggot with regard to the proposed changes to the bylaws of the Magical Orphans Charity. He had the audacity to suggest—</i>
</p><p>Oh, holy bogies. It's his father's diary!</p><p>He sits back, feeling like he should absolutely not be reading this, but also like he's definitely going to read it. He waves his wand and mumbles, "Seventh of October, 2006." The pages flip.</p><p>
  <i>7 October 2006. Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy was born at 5:31 this afternoon. Everyone is healthy. Never have I seen such a perfect human. </i>
</p><p>Never in his life has Scorpius so bemoaned a vague pronoun reference and use of passive voice. And what's worse, Draco always employs deliberate language. In Scorpius's childhood, Draco constantly smiled and gently corrected his grammar until Scorpius became a beacon of posh speech befitting the Malfoy name. Scorpius's academic training interrupts his memory to remind him that this sort of socialisation into the linguistic trappings of the upper classes is one of the factors that perpetuates class inequality. He shakes his head, willing his brain to concentrate on what's important here: Draco's uncharacteristic sloppy language on the day of Scorpius's birth. "Was born" and "everyone," indeed.</p><p>Scorpius sighs, then smiles at the sentiment in the diary entry. But he doesn't want to read his father fawning over his newborn self with ambiguous antecedents. He waves his wand and murmurs, "<i>Prima Mentionis," </i>concentrating all his magical energy on the circumstances surrounding his conception.</p><p>The pages of the diary flip violently backwards, landing eventually on a page from 1999. Shit, what? That was seven years before his birth.</p><p>
  <i>1 September 1999. Today is a day that should be spent on a train. Instead, I got pissed at a Muggle pub, and who did I run into but P.? The wanker was sitting on a barstool looking like absolute arse, as always, and when I walked in—</i>
</p><p>Scorpius looks up from the page, feeling like an interloper. He glances at the clock; Draco's meeting should last at least another hour. Scorpius casts a Charm that will alert him when his father returns, shakes off his guilt, and reads.</p>
<hr/><p>Draco walked into the pub, the first one he found walking at random through Muggle London. He wanted to get pissed and forget about his inane back-to-school feelings. He was an adult now, he shouldn't have been feeling weird about Hogwarts starting up without him. He shouldn't have felt so robbed of his childhood and of a normal education.</p><p>Alcohol would be good. He frowned, trying to remember Muggle alcohols. Maybe he'd get the non-smoking whiskey or a beer. Or better yet, gin. Yes, yes, <i>gin. </i></p><p>He approached the bar, then stopped in his tracks. Because Harry bloody Potter was sat at one of the stools.</p><p>Well, fuck it all to hell. This day was determined to be horrible and also to make him maudlin like a Hufflepuff at a wedding; there was no point in fighting it. He sat down next to Potter. </p><p>"That's quite a pink drink," Draco said by way of greeting.</p><p>Potter's head whirled around satisfyingly quickly. "Malfoy," he said, squinting his eyes, and Draco couldn't tell whether the squint was due to suspicion or inebriation. "It's not pink. It's red." Potter held up his drink.</p><p>Draco hummed. "Looks like something my mother would serve at a medium-sized birthday gathering."</p><p>"It's a serious drink!" Potter claimed, then his face scrunched in confusion. Merlin, he must have had a few drinks already. "I don't understand why we're talking about my drink. What are you doing here?"</p><p>"What are <i>you </i>doing here?" Draco shot back. "And don't try to change the subject. Is that a fruit punch-based cocktail?"</p><p>"What? No!" Potter huffed. Then, "How do you know what fruit punch is?"</p><p>What a prat, insulting the extent of Draco's Muggle assimilation! "I know things," Draco said warningly.</p><p>They stared at each other for a long moment, then Harry said, "It's a Negroni."</p><p>"What's in a Negroni besides fruit punch?"</p><p>"It's not—" Potter groaned. "You are impossible! It's gin, vermouth, and Campari. The Campari is red. I think it's made with beetles or something. I'm trying not to think about that."</p><p>"Oh. Probably not beetles, but the Cochineal insect," Draco said, grasping at the detail he knew something about.</p><p>Potter's face was a mess of confusion. "What?"</p><p>"Don't look at me like that—it's used in potions sometimes."</p><p>Potter took a sip of his fruit-punch coloured, insect-dyed drink. </p><p>Draco licked his lips, watching Potter's eyes on him. "That sounds good, though," Draco said. "I was hoping for gin." He raised a finger to catch the bartender's eye and pointed at Potter's drink.</p><p>They sat in silence until he had a red drink to match Potter's. Draco took a sip. "Circe and Cassandra," he coughed, "that is bitter. It doesn't taste at all like it looks."</p><p>Potter turned to him. "I would drink it even if it were pink."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"The drink. I would drink a pink drink if I wanted to."</p><p>"Yes, I'm sure you would," Draco said slowly, as if Potter were a very slow learner.</p><p>"What is that supposed to mean?!"</p><p>"Nothing!"</p><p>"I am comfortable with my, you know, my masculinity," Potter said, waving his hand around indistinctly like a complete moron.</p><p>Draco stared at him for a moment. "Do you want a round of applause?"</p><p>Potter sighed. "Give the drink two more sips and you'll start liking it. This is the strangest conversation I've ever had."</p><p>"You're strange," Draco retorted, as if he were still eleven.</p><p>"<i>You're </i>strange," Potter said, and at least their immaturity was well-matched.</p><p>"Why are you here all alone, O Strange One?" Draco asked, sipping the drink again—and Potter was right, it was already tasting better, the twist of orange peel lending it a citrusy aroma and the slight sweetness from the vermouth offsetting the bitterness.</p><p>Potter shrugged. "I dunno. No one else seemed to have bittersweet feelings about the first of September. I just wanted to get pissed and be sad about being a grown-up and everything I've missed out on."</p><p>Draco stared at him and blinked. What was the appropriate thing to say when one's nemesis expressed an emotion that matched one's own exactly? He settled on honesty. "I feel exactly the same."</p><p>Potter's green eyes looked up in surprise. "Really? When I said that earlier, Ron and Hermione just looked worried and, you know, like I was off my rocker."</p><p>Draco swallowed the rest of his drink and smirked. "Maybe we're both off our rockers." He signalled the bartender for two more drinks. Gin was good.</p><p>"How <i>are</i> you?" Potter asked suddenly, the words bursting out of his mouth with a hint of mania.</p><p>Draco quirked an eyebrow. "I'm well, Potter, and yourself?"</p><p>Potter scowled. "Don't give me any of that meaningless pure-blood polite response nonsense. That won't work on me."</p><p>"Well, what do you want me to say, Potter?"</p><p>"I dunno, I haven't seen you since the trial and I just, I've wondered how you are."</p><p>Draco looked at him, trying to solve Potter like he was a puzzle, but Potter looked genuine. That bastard always looked genuine; even when he was angry it was a genuine anger.</p><p>Draco took another sip of his red-not-pink drink and sighed. "I'm fine. Doing community service. Trying to help my parents rid the Manor of the stench of Voldemort."</p><p>Potter raised an eyebrow, amused. "The stench of Voldemort?" </p><p>"Well, I mean that literally—because you know, different types of magic have different scents, or maybe you don't know that, you grew up with Muggles—and also figuratively because we're just trying to expunge the memories." Draco stared at his drink. "There's been a lot of redecorating."</p><p>"Oh," Potter said. "Funny, I've sort of been doing the same thing with my house. Except, you know, ridding it of house-elf heads and um, cursed wallpaper."</p><p>"Cursed <i>wallpaper</i>?" Draco asked in confused amusement, taking another sip.</p><p>"Yeah, I was surprised, too. So was Ginny—it glued her hands to the wall when she walked by talking a little too loudly and a little too progressively."</p><p>Draco raised his eyebrows. "So you and the littlest ginger are—?"</p><p>"Huh? No." Potter frowned at his drink. "Didn't I just tell you that I'm gay?"</p><p>"<i>What?!" </i>Draco cried. "No! I would've remembered that." </p><p>"When we were talking about the pink drink."</p><p>"Potter, no. You said you'd drink a pink drink and I, clearly, did not assume that implied anything about your sexual preferences. Do you even know how sexuality works?"</p><p>"No! I mean yes! I thought I said it after that."</p><p>"How many of these have you had?" Draco asked, clinking his glass into Potter's.</p><p>"Er, three? I'm bi, actually."</p><p>"Didn't you bring this whole thing up to explain why you weren't with Ginny?" Draco asked, completely bewildered. "If you're bi, that isn't even relevant."</p><p>"Yes it is!" Potter said, tipsy and defensive. "It's relevant because I've been totally preoccupied with cock lately."</p><p>Draco's mind blanked for a moment, and he looked up at the dingy ceiling as if for strength. He took a bracing sip of his drink, realising he was going to have to meet Potter's confessions with his own if he wanted to maintain this precarious and bewildering truce they had going on. "I'm gay."</p><p>Potter turned slowly, and Draco wondered if time had slowed. "Are you just saying that to make me feel comfortable?" he asked.</p><p>Draco scowled. "First of all, since when do I do anything to make you feel comfortable? Second of all, you can't actually think I would 'just say' that."</p><p>"Yeah, s'pose."</p><p>"So how are dating opportunities for the Saviour?" Draco asked, only allowing the tiniest bit of resentment to creep into his voice.</p><p>Potter fixed him with the surliest scowl Draco could ever remember seeing on his face. "Oh, <i>perfect</i>, Malfoy," he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Dating opportunities are awesome. Everyone wants to date me but no one gives a crap about knowing who I am. They just want a photo in the <i>Prophet </i>or to dose me with love potions or try to get me to make babies. On one memorable occasion someone sent me a literal human egg in the post."</p><p>Draco's mouth dropped open. "In the <i>post</i>?"</p><p>Potter shrugged. "It had a Cushioning Charm. And something else. Preservation? Stasis? I dunno."</p><p>Draco just stared at him.</p><p>Potter suddenly smiled, and it lit up his face. He held up his red drink for a toast. "So I'm not dating at all."</p><p>Draco's mouth was dry, and the bitterness of the Campari lingering on his tongue seemed to mask his usual hesitation. "Really?" he asked, only when he said it, it came out much too low. That "Really?" sounded like a come-on. It sounded like a <i>promise. </i></p><p>Potter's eyebrows shot up in response to Draco's tone. His mouth opened and closed, and Draco was not meant to find that endearing, he really wasn't, but Potter looked adorable when he was off-kilter.</p><p>"Uh," Potter said. "No. I'm unattached." He held his hands out to either side as if to indicate his lack of attachments. "Are you?"</p><p>Draco wanted to smirk. He tried, he told his brain to tell his lip to curl up like he'd smelled something nasty, but he had the horrible suspicion that his face was blank and open. "Unattached."</p><p>Potter smiled and his eyes burned<i> </i>into Draco. And just like that, Draco knew it was a foregone conclusion that they'd be fucking within an hour or two. </p><p>Draco returned Potter's smile with a slow and heated one of his own. Potter downed the rest of his drink.</p><p>Oh, this was going to be fun.</p>
<hr/><p>Scorpius leans against the brick in front of The Hopping Pot, his favourite lunch spot. He's waiting for his father, his fingers fidgeting nervously in his robe pocket.</p><p>Draco comes into view, turning the corner on Diagon Alley, and smiles when he sees his son. Draco has always cut an imposing figure; he appears distinctive and aristocratic, but with a war-earned humility that makes him more approachable. His robes are always impeccable and of the latest fashion, something that sets him apart from many men of his social class (many of whom continue to wear stodgy robes that one imagines would've filled the closets of Nicolas Flamel or Elphias Doge). Scorpius knows he looks startlingly like him, though he dresses in a more casual, Muggle-influenced manner. But today he's meeting his father for lunch, so he wears a set of robes.</p><p>"Scorpius," Draco greets with a smile, leaning in for an embrace.</p><p>"Hey, Dad. How's it going?" Scorpius has been worried about his father, and his worry seeps into his greeting.</p><p>Draco raises an eyebrow in mild exasperation, and Scorpius winces, knowing that Draco is tired of being asked how he's doing in the wake of his wife's death. "It's not as if I'm the first man to be widowed," Draco had exclaimed the other night. "You'd think people would have figured out what not to say!"</p><p>In an attempt to show that he's not at all treating his father with overzealous solicitude, Scorpius exclaims, "I'm famished. Ready for some lunch?"</p><p>Draco smiles and opens the door. They find a table near the window and sit. "How's work?" Draco asks, pulling out a pair of glasses to peruse the menu.</p><p>A few years back, Draco had gone into a strop for a month about the glasses. He didn't want them, but his eyesight had degenerated to the point where a Vision-Correcting Charm no longer worked. Astoria had eventually gotten through to him after he had accidentally, at this very cafe, ordered a roast beetroot sandwich thinking it was roast beef. Draco had ranted for five minutes about the "absolute brazenness" of "the vegans" in making a sandwich out of root vegetables. "My love," Astoria'd said, interrupting him, "you are in your <i>mid-fifties. </i>Please, can we dispense with the vanity and embrace functionality?" Since then, he'd begrudgingly worn the glasses. Scorpius suspects he still blames the glasses on the vegans.</p><p>Scorpius wants to order the roast beet sandwich (it comes with chèvre and arugula on sourdough bread), but he doesn't want to stir up bad feelings, so he orders the quiche. Draco orders the beef stroganoff, and makes the waiter confirm that it is made, in fact, with beef.</p><p>"Can I ask you a question?" Scorpius asks, realising that he's mumbling a bit, which grates on Draco's nerves, and resolves to speak more clearly when next he opens his mouth.</p><p>Draco looks at him with concern. He's forgotten to take off the glasses, and really, they suit him. The crinkles around his eyes and mouth make him look distinguished, and the modern frames he'd chosen give him a very "hip dad" look. He could probably be featured in <i>Witch Weekly</i>'s "Venerable Warlocks" issue. Scorpius smiles.</p><p>"Of course," Draco says.</p><p>"How did you and Mum get together?" Scorpius tries to say this casually, but he worries it comes out with the same tone as a Minister telling their constituents not to panic.</p><p>"You know that already," Draco says smoothly. "Our parents were friends; it was a good match."</p><p>"Yes, but," Scorpius starts, and he almost drops the topic and starts babbling about his latest research project about the classed linguistic conventions of Latin versus vernacular incantations, but decides to power through. "Yes, but, how did you find out about it? Did you know her? Had you had other relationships? How did you feel about it? Did you love her before you got married?"</p><p>Draco's face flashes for a moment with something like apprehension, then quickly shutters into a practiced facade. "Goodness, Scorpius, you might have made quite a feelsy Hufflepuff if you'd attended Hogwarts." He smiles.</p><p>"I'm serious," Scorpius says, and he knows his tone is startlingly firm. He usually babbles and laughs and rants. </p><p>"What's brought this on?" Draco asks.</p><p>Scorpius blows out a huff of air, because it's pretty obvious what's brought this on. She just <i>died. </i>But he feels it would be a little salt-in-wound to say that aloud.</p><p>Draco frowns and takes a sip of water. "We knew each other vaguely from Hogwarts, of course. She was two years below me. I knew of her parents through my parents. After the war ended…" Draco pauses, and Scorpius looks at the table to try to give him some space. "We raised you differently," Draco says, his voice pleading for understanding.</p><p>Scorpius looks up. He hadn't expected that.</p><p>"We always tried to let you be your own person. After what happened in the war, we didn't want you to feel like your life had been planned out for you."</p><p>Scorpius knows that his parents had raised him differently, but he's never heard Draco talk about it. He watches in fascination as his father absent-mindedly rubs his left forearm.</p><p>"It wasn't like that for me," Draco continues. "Even after the war, especially after the war, it was expected that I would do certain things. First and foremost, get married to an eligible witch and produce an heir."</p><p>Scorpius feels his heart drop. He's overcome with sadness for his nineteen-year-old father. He feels guilty and resentful about his father's lost choices.</p><p>"No. No!" Draco, who must've seen something on Scorpius's face, reaches across the table and grabs his wrist. "We never regretted you. I don't regret you."</p><p>The waiter arrives Levitating their plates and sets their food in front of them. Draco picks up his fork and cuts into a piece of—oh, indeed—beef.</p><p>"I just—" Scorpius huffs a sad laugh, popping a cucumber into his mouth. "It shouldn't have been like that."</p><p>Draco's face falls for a moment before he remembers to mask it. "I imagine it's hard for you to understand. I didn't even resent it at the time—not really. It was…just the way things were." He chews a mouthful of food in silence for a moment, then adds, "I had a few relationships, but I knew they wouldn't—couldn't—last. I knew my parents would arrange a proper match."</p><p>"How could you just—" Scorpius waves his fork around inelegantly. "I can't imagine—. When you were my age, you had a five-year-old son. I don't even have a relationship. I wander around archives and occasionally write a paper!"</p><p>Draco's face is kind but serious. "The wishes of my parents are not the reason you're here. I was meant to have you when I did—I'd never change it. Stop worrying so much."</p><p>Scorpius sighs, a sad smile on his face. His mother always used to tell him to stop worrying so much.</p>
<hr/><p>When Scorpius gets home, he kicks off his oxfords (Malfoys never wear trainers, though his oxfords are scuffed and the laces are fraying) and flops onto the sofa. It's hard to know that someone is lying to you when they don't know that you know they're lying. Granted, Draco seems to be attempting as much honesty as possible, and Scorpius can't help but respect that. Scorpius is a remarkably accepting person, regardless how much his father maintains he would've sorted Slytherin had he gone to Hogwarts.</p><p>He sits at his dining table, which is covered with books and a duplicate he'd guiltily made of his father's diary. He has a book from the library about what Healers call "spontaneous male conception," but decides that he can't bring himself to read dry theory about it. He's too emotional for dry theory and facts—it's his life, not a medical phenomenon.</p><p>He picks up the diary. After the first entry he read, he'd wanted to keep reading chronologically, but he'd progressed through six months of entries (and Merlin, did his father have a lot to say) with no further mention of the mysterious P. He did read about a few of his Aunt Pansy's disastrous love affairs, a hilarious anecdote about Blaise Zabini's short-lived foray into wine-making, a sad story about Greg Goyle's post-war depression, and a subsequent happier story about the opening of his cake shop.</p><p>But he is feeling impatient and decides to treat this like a researcher would. "<i>Prima Mentionis," </i>he says again, concentrating on his conception. The diary flips to that first entry he'd read. "<i>Deinde</i> <i>Mentionis."  </i>The diary flips again, this time landing in 2003, still three years before his birth.</p><p>
  <i>15 January 2003. Father forced me to go to a Ministry function yesterday in hopes that it would somehow improve the Malfoy name. I wanted to tell him that there wasn't much I could do on that count given his effect on the name, but instead I put on my silver dress robes. I was sat at a table with a group of single young people—and who sits next to me but P. He starts prattling on about how we were a table of leftovers but at least they hadn't sat him with Elmer Fostenbudge again. I hadn't seen him since that night a few years ago, and, if I'm honest, he looked amazing. He was wearing a set of gorgeous dark green robes and I had half a mind to ask who dressed him. In any case, we started talking and…</i>
</p>
<hr/><p>"I started Auror Training," Potter said at the table of the Ministry's "Destroying the Mist" charity function, his mouth turned up into a half smirk. "Go on, take the piss." They'd been talking for awhile, and his willingness to sit and talk and laugh with Draco was a bit unexpected, if not unwelcome.</p><p>Draco pressed his lips together, trying to quell a smile. "I would never dare poke fun at the Saviour."</p><p>Potter smiled, and it felt blinding. Draco had to look away; he trained his eyes on the Charmed ice sculpture, but Potter's smile felt like a beacon. </p><p>"Oh, come on, Malfoy," Potter said. "Everyone else is telling me how noble it is, but I thought for sure you'd say something like, 'I feel so comforted knowing that our fates rest in the hands of an imbecile' or something, and then I'd say, 'You think your fate rests in my hands, Malfoy?' and you'd say, 'I'll tell you what can rest in your hands, Potter.'" </p><p>Potter was still smiling, and Draco laughed in a manner that was much too honest. "Thought about that a lot, have you? And that was the worst innuendo I've ever heard."</p><p>Potter shrugged, though his face flushed. "Maybe I have thought about it. About what you'd say."</p><p>Draco couldn't suppress the shiver that ran down his spine. "You're wrong."</p><p>Potter looked at him in confusion.</p><p>"You're wrong about what I'd say. I saw the articles in the <i>Prophet </i>about how the Boy Who Lived to Endanger Himself started Auror Training. But I didn't think you were an imbecile. I thought you were making a bad choice because you'd never be happy doing," Draco paused, waving a hand, "that."</p><p>"What?" Potter asked, a small smile on his face. "What do you mean?"</p><p>Draco leaned towards him. "I think you're doing what other people want you to do, not what you want to do."</p><p>"What <i>do</i> I want to do?" Potter returned with an impish smirk, and Merlin, Draco had underestimated him back in school.</p><p>"Are we still talking about Auror Training?" Draco asked, sitting back in his chair.</p><p>"Are we?"</p><p>Draco had been hoping that Potter would agree to a fuck since he saw him walk into the room, and the insinuation in his voice made Draco's heart race. He didn't say anything.</p><p>"Look," Potter said, twirling a fork in his fingers nervously, "I'm kind of dating Ginny now."</p><p>"The Littlest Weasley?" Draco clarified, his neck cold with jealousy and disappointment and something else that felt like a sharp pain in his gut.</p><p>"Yeah," Potter said. He sighed. "We're not, um, exclusive yet, really. But I just felt like I should tell you that before we—"</p><p>"It's fine, Potter," Draco said roughly. His stomach still felt unsettled, though more settled now that he realised Potter was still game. "And I'm going to marry a pure-blood witch at some point in the near future. This is just for fun."</p><p>"If you're sure," he said, his eyes on Draco's lips.</p><p>"We may as well have some fun now before we're forced to settle down with a pair of wives, eh?" Draco had meant for that to sound flippant, but it came out resentful.</p><p>Potter frowned at the table. "It's not really like that, with me. No one's making me—but," he stopped, looked at Draco's eyes. "I want to, with you."</p><p>Draco couldn't look away. "Have we stayed here long enough to fulfil your obligations as Saviour?"</p><p>"Fuck my Saviour obligations," Potter said with a grin. "Harry Potter lives at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place." </p><p>Draco stared at him in confusion for a moment, then realised what Potter was doing. "Oh. Right."</p><p>Potter stood and casually walked out of the ballroom without looking back.</p><p>Draco stared at his drink, his plate, the flowers on the table, the ceiling, the ice sculpture, and then finally gave in to his impatience and walked to the Floo. Careful to speak quietly, Draco said Potter's address in the flames, spun, and emerged in a truly hideous sitting room. He gaped at the room for a moment.</p><p>"Agrippa's pants, Potter," Draco hissed. "Did I come to the right place, or did I accidentally land in the home of a nonagenarian practitioner of the Dark Arts?"</p><p>But before Draco could continue his rant—and he had planned to continue—Potter was standing right in his personal space staring at him with a look of unbridled lust. Draco swallowed, stood taller. </p><p>"Shhh, or she'll hear you. She's only a portrait though—I live alone."</p><p>Draco wasn't sure where to start with that, so he said nothing, opting instead to take one step closer.</p><p>"Can I kiss you?" Potter asked, his eyes flicking from Draco's mouth to eyes and his hands reaching for Draco's hips. </p><p>"Oh, Potter," Draco drawled with a smirk, "you don't need to ask with me."</p><p>Potter launched himself forward, and as their lips met Draco couldn't believe they'd let over three years pass since the last time they'd done this. It was as brilliant as he remembered. His body was flooded with the same rush of adrenaline and anticipation that he'd used to feel when hexing Potter, only it was overlaid with intense pleasure and a feeling of contentment that could never come from duelling.</p><p>"Did you think about me?" Potter asked, pulling away with an unfairly adorable grin. </p><p>What an idiot. What a complete idiot.</p><p>"No. Not once in three years."</p><p>Potter pushed his shoulder. "Liar."</p><p>"No, really, I haven't thought of you," Draco said, trying to keep a straight face but feeling a smile. "It's a hardship for me to look at you, that's how ugly you are. And you're a terrible kisser. And your cock is—"</p><p>Potter didn't wait to listen to what Draco had to say about his cock, opting instead to push Draco back against the wall. Draco wondered for a moment if that was going to ruin his robes—the wallpaper was covered with creepy amulets and hadn't Potter mentioned it was cursed? But then Potter was grabbing his hips and pressing his hot tongue into Draco's mouth and sucking on his neck.</p><p>It was a sensory overload—Potter's stubble scratched his chin, Potter's hair tickled his cheek, Potter's smell filled his nostrils. <i>Merlin. </i>Potter's extremely hard cock pressed against his groin. </p><p>"Fuck, Malfoy," Potter moaned, and Draco was relieved that Potter seemed as overwhelmed as he was.</p><p>His body was inundated with sensation, which was not a normal sort of feeling for him. Generally, his body felt unremarkable; he never thought about it. Usually he wandered around life, seeing friends, attending events, arguing with his parents, trying to put off his inevitable marriage to Astoria Greengrass. Even when he managed to find a person to have one off with, his body just felt good. But this was so much; his skin was burning. It was stupid, really. How could humans be expected to ever act rationally if their bodies were capable of feeling like <i>this?</i></p><p>Draco pressed forward into Potter, rocking his hips forward. Potter moaned at the friction, which made Draco want to do it again and again. "What do you want?" Draco asked, nipping at Potter's earlobe.</p><p>"Mmmmmm," Potter responded. "You." He stopped, breathing heavily and kissing Draco's neck. "Mouth, anything. Want to fuck me?"</p><p>Draco pulled back, surprised. Last time they'd sucked each other off in an <i>Colloportused</i> loo at that Muggle pub. This time he was in Potter's <i>house</i> and Potter was offering to bottom? It seemed bigger, somehow. </p><p>He must've waited too long to answer, because Potter was saying, "If you—do you do that? I like it all. I mean, I'll top, if you want. Or we don't have to—"</p><p>Draco smiled, and watched as Potter's shoulders relaxed minutely when he realised Draco wasn't uncomfortable. "I like it all, too. And yes, I want to fuck you."</p><p>Potter huffed a relieved laugh. "Merlin, you sound good saying that." He leaned in for another kiss, his whole body pressing into Draco's, and Draco's head swam with lust and wonder—that Potter wanted him, wasn't just putting up with him.</p><p>Potter pulled away, whispered into Draco's ear, "Take out your wand." </p><p>Draco raised an eyebrow, but did as he was told. He was powerless to do anything but obey Potter when he talked like that. He wondered if anyone ever disobeyed Potter when he talked like that. Or if Potter ever talked that way to anyone else.</p><p>Potter reached around, wrapped his hand above Draco's on the wand, pointed it at himself, and whispered a series of protection and preparation spells. Draco could feel Potter's magic flowing through his wand, through his fingers, and Potter's forehead crinkled in displeasure as the spells hit his body. Potter dropped Draco's hand, walked backward towards the stairs.</p><p>"You coming?"</p>
<hr/><p>The Saviour. Ginny Weasley. A Fidelius Charm.</p><p>Scorpius sits cross-legged on his sofa, staring at his wiggling toes in a pair of thick, knit socks he likes to wear when home alone—the socks are much too thick to fit in shoes, but they make him feel a sense of home and belonging and comfort. He tries to stop his fidgety movement, but his mind is consumed with a torrent of thoughts, his heart is fluttering.</p><p>
  <i>Harry Potter? </i>
</p><p>He must be mistaken. There must be some other person in magical Britain who is a Saviour and dated Ginny Weasley and had to put his home under a Fidelius.</p><p>Except Scorpius is an historian, so he has to think about this rationally. All available evidence points to one solid conclusion: years ago, his father and Harry Potter had an affair. </p><p>He wants to Floo to the Manor and confront his father right now. He wants to say, "Dad! How could you keep this from me!" Well no, he doesn't want to accuse. He'd say, "Am I right? Harry Potter? <i>The </i>Harry Potter?" No, that wouldn't do; he can't act like an overzealous fan over a man who may very well be his other father. He'd like to ask his father, "Was he good in bed?" but in truth Draco and Scorpius don't have that type of relationship. He wants to, but will never, ask, "Did you love him?"</p><p>His brain buzzes with everything he knows about Harry Potter, a man so famous that he'd always been in the periphery of Scorpius's consciousness, even when they'd lived in France. Harry Potter is always in the papers, his face on book covers, his name in history papers Scorpius studies. </p><p>He tries to remember his father ever mentioning Harry Potter; he knows they went to Hogwarts together, were in the same year. Scorpius remembers asking Draco about it once. "What was it like to be at school with Harry Potter?" he'd asked with excitement, and he remembers his father saying tersely, "Exactly as you'd imagine, except the books don't tell you what a prat he was." When Scorpius had tried to ask more, Draco had ended the conversation with a short word and a raised brow.</p><p>It's not as if Draco had dropped clues that they were talking about his secret father.</p><p>Harry Potter is divorced, has three children. <i>Merlin</i>—half-siblings? Scorpius fidgets again, rubbing his thumb and index finger over the pad of his foot. He doesn't know what he thinks about that. Being an only child (Scorpius doesn't even have any cousins!) is one of the primary parts of his identity. He'd spent his childhood jealous of other children, of characters in books who had large families. At Beauxbatons, he'd struggled more than most to learn how to live in close quarters with so many other people, and he'd started to understand how deeply his status as "only" was imprinted on his identity. He'd long ago embraced his "only"ness, but now the voice of a long-abandoned child Scorpius sounds in his head, excitedly saying, <i>Siblings</i>!</p><p>At this shimmer of excitement, he is immediately overcome with a wave of grief, a feeling of being a terrible, ungrateful son to his mother—she's been gone such a short time and he's already trying to replace her with new family. Scorpius knows she wouldn't see it that way—in fact, it's probably part of why she decided to finally tell him the truth—but he still feels twisted up and conflicted. He takes a breath, twisting his jumper in his fingers. He's not trying to get a new mother; he's trying to find the rest of his family. Another father. Siblings. Cousins, probably.</p><p>But no. He's getting ahead of himself. He should research. Yes, that's what he should do. He's trained for this sort of thing, after all. Gathering facts, piecing things together, making evidence-based conclusions. He picks up his phone and opens Wizkipedia. <i>Harry Potter</i>, he thinks, focusing his magical energy, and the words appear on the screen, followed by an article. A long article. </p><p>His mind flashes to a time a few years ago when he was working on a project about powerful magical auras in oral history. Many people throughout history had reported being able to feel the auras of powerful magical folk, but there had never been an attempt to systematise this data. Scorpius had been working with old documents in which people described powerful wizards, going as far back as Merlin, and he'd turned to Draco one day and asked, "Does Harry Potter have a palpable aura?" His father had stopped what he was doing and turned to him with a blank face. "Pardon?" Draco had said. "A strong magical aura," Scorpius explained. "Could you feel his aura when you were near him?" Draco had stared for a moment, then said, "Yes. I mean. No. I'm not sure." Scorpius remembers thinking it was odd; Draco, in general, is a precise observer of magic in the world and also a precise speaker. And yet…</p><p>Scorpius takes a breath. He won't get invested in this. He could be wrong. Harry Potter could be nothing to him. He could be merely the most famous magical Brit, exactly as Scorpius had always known him.</p><p>Or Harry Potter could be his father. Scorpius laughs, and the sound is anxious and terrified even to his ears. He knows he's already invested, even if he's pretending that his rational, measured side is winning.</p><p>"Harry Potter (b. 31 July 1980) is a British wizard who is best known for defeating <u>"Lord Voldemort" (Tom Riddle)</u>, thereby ending the <u>Second Wizarding War</u>. Son of <u>James Potter</u> and <u>Lily Evans Potter</u>, Harry attended <u>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</u> from 1991 to 1997. He married <u>Ginevra Weasley</u> in 2003; the couple had three children (<u>James Sirius</u> b. 2004, <u>Albus Severus</u> b. 2006, and <u>Lily Luna</u> b. 2008) before their divorce in 2010. Potter served as an <u>Auror</u> from 2001 to 2008."</p><p>The article then splits into detailed sections; the heading of the first reads, "Early life (1980–1991)." </p><p>Scorpius stares at the screen. If Harry Potter is his father, he has a brother born the same year as himself. He taps "Albus Severus," and the screen reads, "Albus Severus Potter (b. 27 February 2006)." Some quick math and Scorpius lets out a slow whistle: Albus Potter is less than eight months older than him. Which means he was conceived when Albus was in his last trimester. Fuck. <i>Fuck. </i></p><p>Scorpius grabs his wand and Summons his father's diary. "<i>Prima Mentionis</i>," he says, concentrating on the second Potter child. The diary flips open, landing eventually well past where he had stopped reading. And there's his answer, isn't it? The magic would've found nothing if Harry Potter's second son was never mentioned in the diary.</p><p>
  <i>23 July 2005. H. was looking more haggard than usual today. Nothing about his behaviour does much to endear me to the prospect of having an infant in my house someday; he is perpetually tired and brings with him the distinct sterile smell of a person who has foregone showers for Cleaning Charms one too many times. I told him he looked like shite, and he collapsed onto me, murmuring into my shoulder that he and his wife are expecting another child. I asked him, "Are you crazy? Already?" but the question I really want to ask—"Are you happy with your life?"—is the one question neither of us ever dare ask.</i>
</p>
<hr/><p>Draco Apparated to his usual spot in the back garden of Grimmauld Place. He looked around, swallowing back his typical paranoia about being found, but the only thing he saw was a bat flying out of a tree. He pulled his cloak tighter around his shoulders and let himself in the back door. </p><p>Harry was already there. He poked his head out of the sitting room and then walked towards Draco. </p><p>"Hey," Harry said, wrapping his arms around Draco's waist and pulling him close. He laid his head on Draco's shoulder and just held tightly. Draco wrapped one arm around him, squeezing Harry's shoulders.</p><p>"Alright?" Draco asked.</p><p>"I'm so tired," Harry mumbled into Draco's lapels. "You're a sight for sore eyes."</p><p>"I'm always a sight for sore eyes, given my extraordinary good looks," Draco said, ratcheting up the posh in his voice. </p><p>Harry laughed. "You're a smell for a sore nose, too. You smell like Draco."</p><p>"I'm going to assume that's meant to be a compliment," Draco said, burying his face against Harry's hair. He couldn't help himself, if he was around Harry. Harry made him act in all the ways he never thought he'd act.</p><p>"Is something wrong?" Draco asked lightly. "Or is this extended embrace the natural effect of another sleepless night with toddler Potter?"</p><p>"Nothing's wrong, but something's happened. I just want another minute to stand here before I tell you. You feel like a calm in the storm."</p><p>Draco didn't quite know what to say to that, but it made his chest clench with something—affection, possessiveness, jealousy. He knew that Harry loved his wife, more than he'd ever love Astoria (at least in a romantic way), but Harry still needed him. Harry couldn't get everything from her, from their life—he still needed Draco. </p><p>Draco spread his legs apart a few inches for better balance and stood tall, cradling Harry's head with the arm wrapped around his shoulders. "What's the storm?"</p><p>"Life," Harry whispered.</p><p>Draco didn't ask what Harry meant; he knew. He felt the same way, most of the time, though he had many fewer demands on his time than Harry. Since the war, he felt like he was being buffeted about by the winds of family, of expectation, of society. He felt like he had no say over his life. Marry Astoria. Rehabilitate the Malfoy name. Get ready to make an heir. (Have you taken your virility potions, my darling son? The kind with the folate? Must do everything to improve sperm quality for our beloved heir, of course.) Life was the storm. But not Harry. Harry wasn't something he had to do. Harry was the only thing in his life that he <i>wanted,</i> just for him<i>. </i></p><p>"Gin's pregnant," Harry said, finally pulling away from Draco. He stood tall, leaning against the wall.</p><p>"What?" Draco asked stupidly, but he couldn't help his inane response because it felt like something—a stupid <i>foetus—</i>was going to tear Harry away from him again, was going to take away the one thing in his life that wasn't part of the storm.</p><p>Harry didn't say it again. He knew Draco well enough to know that Draco was processing. "Due in February."</p><p>A long moment passed. "Congrats, old chap," Draco said with faux enthusiasm, and his voice sounded spiteful, sarcastic, toxic. </p><p>Harry frowned. "Don't be like that. It doesn't change anything."</p><p>Draco scoffed, but hearing Harry say that it didn't change anything loosened the vicelike feeling in his neck, in his chest. He lived in constant worry that Harry would leave, would no longer need him, had never needed Draco like Draco needed him. Something would happen someday that would make Harry realise it, and where would Draco be then?</p><p>He wondered if Harry had the same worries.</p><p>Harry sighed. "Look, I—I can't handle thinking about any of it. It's like a constant stress, yeah? James is the light of my life, but he never gives me a moment to breathe, or to sleep. Gin makes me happy, but sometimes it just feels like all the shit and responsibility in my life has taken on the shape of <i>her</i> and it's a lot of pressure. I've got all the crap shifts at work because Junior Aurors have to put in their time. And I—you know I—I'm still fucked up. I don't want to think about any of it. The only time I ever feel free is when I'm here with you. Another baby doesn't change that." </p><p>Draco wanted to be mad, but Harry looked so overwhelmed. Draco felt a sudden wave of indignation—he was furious at his parents, their society, everyone who put pressure on Harry, everyone who made Harry think he should get married and become an Auror and have a horde of babies, everyone who constantly told Draco to think carefully about making an heir, about positioning the Malfoy name to achieve influence, every fucking person in this world who somehow contributed to the farces that were their lives. Draco wanted to grab Potter and Apparate away to someplace far—as far away as they could get. Where would that put them—New Zealand? Bring it on, they had good wine and Māori chanting magic.</p><p>But he couldn't. </p><p>Draco took a breath, let it out. Then he pushed Harry against the wall and pressed his lips to Harry's neck. He sucked gently, relishing the feel of Harry's stubble against his face. "I don't want to think about it either."</p><p>Harry reached behind Draco, pulled him close, and whispered, "I brought cashews and chocolate frogs."</p>
<hr/><p>Scorpius looks at the parchment in his hand for what must be the twentieth time in the last minute. He's nervous, and when he's nervous he fidgets, and right now his nerves are at a state where he's worried he's going to tear the paper in half.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <i>Dr Malfoy, Sure—I'd be happy to meet you. My siblings and I were already planning to meet for lunch Tuesday next (noon at the Gnarly Gnome in Diagon). You can join us. -Albus Potter</i>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>

Scorpius feels a little guilty when he sees the "Dr Malfoy." Of course, he <i>is </i>a doctor, but this isn't a professional meeting and he knows that he used his credentials to seem, well, credentialed. He'd also lied through his teeth.</p><p>He must have drafted his original letter to Albus Potter twenty times. As soon as he'd sat down to write it, he realised he was in danger of sounding like a crackpot, or an obsessed fan, or a stalker. <i>"I know something about your father. Please meet."</i> was sure to be Vanished with no reply, at best, or sent to the Aurors, at worst. He'd eventually settled on, <i>"Dear Mr Potter, I am a magical historian specialising in the social history of magic in the British Isles. In the course of compiling research, I've found something that seems to belong to your father. I'm sure he has many demands on his time, and since I'm certain you will be interested in what I've discovered, I thought it best to go to you. Would it be possible to meet in a cafe or library at your convenience? Yours, Dr Scorpius Malfoy"</i></p><p>He'd decided to send the letter to Albus, the middle Potter child, because the oldest, James, was a famous Chaser for the Montrose Magpies, and the youngest, Lily, was a dragonologist who was often out of the country. Albus Potter worked with his father in his Quidditch shop, and therefore seemed the most accessible.</p><p>It was a surprise to hear that he was going to meet them all at once; he'd much rather meet them one at a time. That would be better for his nerves. </p><p>And he has no idea what he can possibly say to them. "The thing I found of your father's is me—surprise, it's a boy!" doesn't seem prudent. "Guess what? Looks like your father impregnated a man three decades ago!" seems rather blunt. "You've known a loving father your whole lives, while I've been lied to since birth and kept from my blood relations" seems to be throwing a bit too much of his baggage at his guiltless, unsuspecting half-siblings.</p><p>He's going to have to wing it.</p><p>He wonders if he should tell them at all. Getting the Potter children involved had seemed like such a good plan a few days ago. They could confirm Scorpius's suspicions, discuss their fathers, and come up with a strategy for telling the fathers that they'd figured it out. That's what siblings do, right? Conspiring and scheming? If he is going to discover at age thirty-one that he's got three siblings, the least he should get from this is scheming co-conspirators.</p><p>But now he feels like the bearer of bad news, about to march into their lives and shatter their misconceptions of their family. He wonders if they know their father is queer; it's certainly never been in the papers. Then, the papers are fond of speculating about how the Saviour doesn't date, which is as good as publishing veiled suspicions about his heterosexuality. What will the Potter children think of it? Their parents are long divorced, but revelations of an affair may shake them; it'd shaken Scorpius. If he just keeps his mouth shut, they never have to know.</p><p>Scorpius starts to laugh a bit manically, rubbing Albus Potter's letter between his fingers. That's the exact train of thought that had led his parents to keep the truth from him. No, the Potters deserve to know. If he were Albus Potter, he'd want to know he has a has a half-brother who is the same age.</p><p>Scorpius wishes he'd known all of this a long time ago.</p><p>He looks at the clock. Time to go. He grabs a handful of Floo powder, tells himself not to overthink it, and steps into the flames.</p><p>When he stops spinning, he steps out into a comfortable-looking pub. He looks around, trying to find the faces of the Potters based on the photos he's seen. A waiter says, "What are you looking for, love?"</p><p>Scorpius wants to laugh—isn't <i>that </i>a question. "The Potters?"</p><p>"They're in the corner," she says, pointing, and Scorpius looks across the pub.</p><p>They're quite noticeable, the Potters. He's seen them in the papers, of course, but they're louder in real life. Lily is the loudest, her red hair in a pixie cut, telling a story and waving her arm in the air. He immediately spots two tattoos on her arm, and he can't help but think that she looks like exactly the kind of person he'd want to sit and chat with, or take to the cinema and make fun of a bad film with. She looks like great fun. Albus, sat next to her, is looking on with amusement. He looks just like his famous father, only younger and without glasses. James, who is pounding his fist on the table with good nature to try to interrupt his sister, looks like he just stepped off the pages of <i>Quidditch Weekl</i>y—goodness, it's a bit intimidating to walk up to a table with <i>James Potter, </i>star Quidditch Chaser. Next to James is another man, who looks slightly older, with medium-brown hair and kind eyes. Scorpius assumes that's James's husband, Teddy Lupin; Scorpius has read about him on Wizkipedia, but hasn't seen him before.</p><p>Scorpius walks over, feeling like an idiot, as four happy faces fall silent and turn to look at him.</p><p>Right. No one is here to make introductions for him.</p><p>"Hello," he forces himself to say, trying not to seem as thoroughly intimidated as he feels. "I'm Scorpius Malfoy. I sent you a….we corresponded?" He wants to kick himself, he sounds like such an arse.</p><p>But the Potters smile. "Have a seat," Lily says, pointing next to her. "I'm Lily."</p><p>Scorpius sits, still feeling profoundly uncomfortable.</p><p>He's met with a chorus of introductions: "I'm Albus, Al," "James Potter," "James's husband, Teddy Lupin." He wonders if being around the Potters always feels like a sensory overload.</p><p>"Hi," Scorpius replies, and smiles. A few waiters arrive, placing a number of dishes in the centre of the table. Everyone busies themselves grabbing food, but eventually all four faces turn to stare at Scorpius, the silence growing like an oppressive fog. Scorpius knows he should break the silence, though his mouth just won't seem to work. </p><p>But just when it's about to get unbearably awkward, Lily says, "So anyway, like I was saying, Lenda is a jackass and if he doesn't start seeing reason, I'm going to have to liberate these dragons." She pauses. "And I really don't want to do that. Especially after the incident a couple years ago."</p><p>"Mum might actually kill you if you do that, Lils," Albus replies, around a mouthful of chip. "Go through the proper channels. You can't Gryffindor this. Go over Lenda's head if you need to. Think like a Slytherin."</p><p>Lily sighs, reaches her freckled hand up to fiddle with a long earring. "I suppose. I hate acting like a Slytherin."</p><p>"Needs must, Lil," James says in sympathetic tones, before biting into a burger.</p><p>They turn again to Scorpius, and Scorpius feels profoundly grateful that they've diffused the tension and are checking to see if he's ready to talk. They are loud and boisterous, but they are kind. He can feel his tension slowly easing.</p><p>"Thanks for agreeing to meet me," Scorpius says, his voice less authoritative than he'd like. "I have something," he pauses, blowing out a huff of air, "I have something to say, and I honestly have no idea how to say it."</p><p>"Just say it, mate," James says. "You didn't go to Hogwarts, but I assume you know about the Houses. Times like this call for acting like a Gryffindor."</p><p>Scorpius sees Albus roll his eyes; he knows Albus is the only Potter who wasn't in Gryffindor. Scorpius laughs. "My dad says I would've been in Slytherin, like him, but I've never been so sure. I think I'd've been Hufflepuff, honestly."</p><p>Teddy shouts, "Badger power!" which is met with silence and bemused expressions. James laughs, throws his arm around Teddy's shoulders. </p><p>"'Badger power'? Really, Ted?" Lily asks flatly. "You're getting so old. You sound like dad. Pretty soon you'll be telling those jokes about the gnome and the lightbulb."</p><p>Albus groans, but Teddy laughs. "I am old, Lils," he says happily. "I'm about to turn forty. I can tell dad jokes even if I'm not a dad."</p><p>"Seriously," Albus says, looking at Scorpius. "Just say what you have to say. You said you had something that belongs to dad? Is it something scandalous?" He raises an eyebrow excitedly, and Scorpius can't help but smile.</p><p>"Okay, look, I'm just going to say this, but it's kind of a long story. My mum died last month—" </p><p>Scorpius was planning to forge ahead, but everyone interrupted.</p><p>"Oh no, I'm so sorry." "Sorry to hear that, mate." "Sorry for your loss." "How awful!"</p><p>Scorpius smiles at their kindness, but he really just wants to finish this story. "It's alright; we knew it was coming. Her family has a blood curse—it's lucky she lived to be fifty-five. Anyway, before she died she told me—she told me that she isn't my mum. Well, she is my mum—she raised me. But she's not my blood mum. My dad—my dad was pregnant with me. I have two dads—you know, rare but happens. And, er, I was curious so I stole a diary of my dad's. And." He pauses. Act like a Gryffindor. "I think—I'm pretty sure. Um. The person who—the sperm. Oh, Merlin. I am babbling. Come on, Scorpius. I think your father got my father pregnant. So. That's the, er, thing. That I wanted to say."</p><p>He tears his eyes away from the pepper grinder, which he's been unthinkingly staring at, and looks up. All four are staring at him with open mouths.</p><p>"<i>What?</i>" James says, and Scorpius is relieved that his voice, though shocked, doesn't sound angry.</p><p>Scorpius swallows. "In the diary, my dad wrote about the affair. He didn't use a name, called him 'P.' But mentioned 'the Saviour' and that they knew each other from school and that he was with Ginny Weasley. They were together—I'm not exactly sure how long. A few years, I think. It's a bit hard for me to read it, so I keep having to take breaks to avoid having a full-blown panic attack. So I'm not sure exactly."</p><p>Albus is the first to recover enough to talk. "What did your dad say?"</p><p>"I haven't told him I know. I tried to, but... He's grieving. I didn't know what to say." He pauses, not sure how much he should reveal.</p><p>Lily sighs. "Well, this is something." </p><p>"Do you want me to—" Teddy starts, but then seems unsure. "I'm a Healer. I could do the Charm to confirm—compare your genetics with one of theirs. But I don't want to push you to do it, if you don't want to. Medical ethics, blah blah blah."</p><p>"It's okay with me," Scorpius says. "I mean, thank you for offering."</p><p>Lily nods. "Hit me."</p><p>Teddy pulls out his wand, looking rather more uncertain than Scorpius suspects is usual for him. He seems like a nice bloke, and competent, and arse-over-tit for James. Teddy looks at James, James nods at him, and Teddy casts.</p><p>Scorpius feels the magic settle over him and Lily, feels the tingle of a diagnostic-type Charm. After a moment looking at a swirling pattern illuminated above them, Teddy declares, "Fifty percent genetic match." He tucks his wand away, and with it his medical authority. "Well, fuck," Teddy says.</p><p>They're all staring at him. Scorpius doesn't know what to say. "It's been a weird month," he ventures.</p><p>To his immense relief, the Potters laugh.</p><p>"Well, what the fuck is another brother to add to the rest of the family?" Lily asks. "Welcome, bro. Here are my rules for my brothers, and Al and Jamie, you'd do well to listen up. One, do not ever ask me if I'm dating anyone. I'm ace, and I can't stand that type of small talk. Two, don't ever tell me what to do. Three—nah, that's it. Only two rules."</p><p>Scorpius laughs, a bit taken aback. "Alright? No problem."</p><p>"What the actual fuck?" Albus bursts. "Not you, mate, you seem cool. I'm talking about Dad."</p><p>James catches Teddy's eye, his lips pressed together. </p><p>"I saw that!" Lily shouts. "Jamie, Ted, what do you know?"</p><p>"I don't <i>know </i>anything," James says, raising his hands defensively. "I just—Teddy and I have talked about some memories we have. Teddy remembers going with Dad somewhere and a man was there. I remember him getting owls, I don't know."</p><p>"What the fuck, James?" Albus yells, and he sounds mad now, for the first time. "Why wouldn't you tell us that?"</p><p>James sighs. He raises a hand and gestures at Albus. "This is why. Also, when Mum and Dad divorced, I was six. I was barely old enough to understand what I was seeing. You were <i>four </i>and Lily was <i>two. </i>There's no way I could've told you! And after—well, why dredge it up? Dad's philandering is his business. Well, and Mum's, I suppose, when they were still married."</p><p>"But Dad <i>doesn't </i>philander," Lily said thoughtfully. "How many dates has he been on since the divorce? It's been almost thirty years. He's been on, what, five dates?"</p><p>Scorpius, eating a chip, watches with morbid curiosity as his new siblings air all the dirty laundry of his very famous new father.</p><p> James turns suddenly to Teddy. "Would you have taken Dad for a top?"</p><p>"James!" Teddy huffs, covering his laugh with his hand. "You can't label people like that. Didn't we just go to a lecture a couple weeks ago on how heteronormative gender assumptions affect queer sexual desires and identities?"</p><p>James waves his hand. "Yeah, yeah, I know. But still. Would you have?"</p><p>"I always wondered if Dad was pining after someone," Albus interrupts. "You should see the wistful look he gets when he watches you and Teddy, like he's watching his kid do something he never got to do. I swear. It's sickening."</p><p>"But that's just Dad," James replies. "Wait. You think Dad is jealous of me and Teddy? Ew! Dads aren't supposed to be sexual."</p><p>Teddy is still laughing, but trying to pretend that he's not. "James. Grow up. Dads <i>are </i>supposed to be sexual. Because they're people." He pauses and looks at Lily. "Unless they're not sexual. No offense, Lils."</p><p>"Nah, it's okay. Dad's obviously not ace. He's just sad." Lily bites into a roll.</p><p>"Lily!" Albus says, exasperated. He drops his head into his hands, elbows on the table. For a moment, they sit there in silence, though it doesn't feel awkward, just contemplative. After a moment, Albus looks up at Scorpius. "What about your dad?"</p><p>"Well, he was married to my mum since before I was conceived and they were married until she died. But I don't think—they loved each other, but like friends, you know? I don't think they were ever involved romantically or sexually. They lived in different wings of the Manor. Dad said he had to get married, make a proper match, have a child. I'm not really sure I have a good reason for saying this, but I kind of suspect he's still not over your dad. I saw the way he wrote about your dad, and I know my dad hasn't had other affairs—Merlin, at least I don't think so, I mean maybe a one-night thing here or there but I am pretty certain he hasn't had anything real with anyone else—and he always seems a little bit sad like he wants something more and I just. I don't know. Is it silly of me to try to apply social myths about there being one true love?"</p><p>"Merlin," Albus says, sighing and pushing some pasta around on his plate. "Well, our mum remarried ages ago. Dad's never been interested in dating, even when we push him about it. But he's clearly sad about it, too." He turns to Scorpius, trying to explain, "He's always trying to get us to come over. If one of us misses a Thursday night dinner, he sulks. He cross-stitched 'My Grandchildren Are Crups' and hung it on his wall. He's always offering to babysit our cousins' kids. He's…bored. He deserves more, to be honest."</p><p>Scorpius blinks, taking this in. "My grandchildren are crups?"</p><p>"James and Teddy have <i>six </i>crups," Albus informs, buttering a roll and raising his eyebrows in a lovingly judgmental look.</p><p>"Don't speak ill of your nieces and nephews," James says, smiling. "You love them."</p><p>"I don't love Padfoot," Albus says ominously. </p><p>"Padfoot has challenges!" James cries, a bit defensive to Scorpius's ears. </p><p>Lily hums, thankfully attracting attention away from the crup discussion, which seemed poised to teeter into full-blown debacle. They all look at her curiously. "It's just—and you know I hate this sort of speculation and matchmaking of all types—but what if our dad and Scorpius's dad are long-lost lovers? What if they're each, y'know...the one that got away?" She looks at Scorpius.</p><p>He thinks his face might be turning red. "I'm—I'm not sure. But I think. I think maybe. The way he wrote about him…"
</p><p>James drops his fork and rubs his hands together, a look of pure mischief on his face. "Wicked. Let's do this."</p><p>"Oh, Merlin. No!" Albus cries. "No. This can only end in disaster. We can't just go setting them up. Dad can't possibly know Scorpius exists—if he did, he'd have insisted on parenting him. He parents <i>everyone. </i>He tries to parent random kids at Tesco. When he finds out, he is going to be devastated. This entire thing is going to be a complete shit show!"</p><p>"Yeah, that's true," James says, waving his arm dismissively. "But they'll get over it. And think about it, Al. How does Dad act whenever someone mentions Malfoy? Or sees him in the paper?" James raises his eyebrows, waiting for Albus to catch up.</p><p>"Bloody buggering fuck," Albus mumbles, and nods.</p><p>"How are we going to tell Harry and Scorpius's dad without them both freaking out?" Teddy asks.</p><p>"In the name of Merlin," Albus says, "all of you stop talking. If we're hatching a plan, the Slytherin is in charge."</p><p>"Wait though," Teddy says, "we need to see if Scorpius is okay with this." Four questioning, curious faces turn his way.</p><p>Scheming and conspiring. Scorpius smiles.</p>
