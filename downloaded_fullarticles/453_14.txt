          <div class="userstuff"><p>When an old man with flaming red hair and a matching beard walked into my room I didn't know what to think. The thing that bothered me the most was that he was smiling. This orphanage, to put it kindly, generally made people want to either kill someone else or themselves. Most definitely not smile. It probably has something to do with the crying children that you can hear around the whole building and the stale stench of alcohol or the red eyes of the workers.</p><p>So, when this man came in and was smiling it immediately put me on edge. The man looked me up and down. When his eyes met mine his smile faltered, only for a moment. I understand, most people react that way, but that doesn't mean it still didn't hurt. He looked at me softly, no, pityingly, and said, “Hello there, my name is Albus Dumbledore.”</p><p>	“The pleasure is mine, Mr.Dumbledore” i replied. Usually I would just stare at my visitors until they leave me alone, but this man seemed fun. I'll play with him for a little bit before I scare him away, just like everyone else.</p><p>	“Are you from the church?” I questioned innocently, watching with glee as his face fell.</p><p>	“Of course not, child. why would you think such a thing?”</p><p>	I shrugged, “Mrs. Cole said that she was bringing the nice man from the church in again. He says I need to be exorcised again.”</p><p>	The man, Dumbledore’s, eyebrows rose. “Again?” he asked, almost incredulously.</p><p>	“Yep.” I answered, cheerful and airy enough to sound slightly insane, like the blonde girl in my dreams.</p><p>	“You look smart, Mr.Dumbledore, can you answer a question for me?”</p><p>	“Of course, child.” he seemed too shocked to reply with a more eloquent answer.</p><p>	“They say that when you bury someone face down it stops the demons inside of them from coming out, but what if you are the demon?”</p><p>	Dumbledore went even paler than he already was. ”Why on earth are you wondering that?” he asked.</p><p>	“Well, you see Mr.Dumbledore, Mrs.Cole said that when i finally put- oh what did she call it- the noore, moore, moose-”</p><p>	“A noose, Mr. Riddle?’ he asked almost afraid of the answer.</p><p>So he knows my name, curious. However the act was just getting fun.</p><p>	“Ah yes, that was it- thank you Mr.Dumbledore. As i was saying she asked me to make sure that when i finally put the noose around my neck that i land face down because then the awful demons inside me can't get out and hurt her anymore than they already have. But the nice church man said that I am a demon. So what do I do now?”</p><p>	“Well child,” the now starkly pale man said, “Perhaps I can answer that another time. For now I have an offer for you.”</p><p>	He pulled out a thick wax sealed envelope. That was the beginning of a whole new life for me. It was a good decision to not creep out this one, otherwise he might now have offered me the chance to go to a school of magic.</p><p>	“I will come and see you later tomorrow, Mr.Riddle,” he said as he stood to leave after explaining everything, “We will have much to do.”</p><p>	“Okay,” I said, still trying to imitate the blonde one.</p><p>	“One more thing Mr.Riddle.”</p><p>	I looked up questioningly</p><p>	“Have the people here- have they ever hurt you?”</p><p>	I wonder. All the others never helped after I answered this question honestly. Eventually I just stopped trying. But this one is magic-so maybe- just maybe.</p><p>	I let my eyes loose there misty quality i had been keeping up this entire time. I wanted this to work so very badly so I had to pull out all the stops. I dropped my eyes to my lap, enough that it looked like i was trying to hide them but not enough to stop him from seeing them fill up with not-so-fake-tears and gain a sad and downtrodden look. I let my shoulders curve in and brought up my knees to my chest from where I was sitting on the bed.</p><p>	“Yes,” i said, then i quickly and obviously wiped my eyes before i said, “But it's okay Mr.Dumbledore, Mrs.Cole said that no one wants orphans and that no one would be sad if i died, which means that i'm not making anyone sad by getting hurt. And Mrs. Cole and the nice church man and the other workers always look happy after it so I'm helping them!”</p><p>	The poor guy seemed to age ten years at that moment, good. At least when he doesn't help me he will maybe feel a little guilty. He put a hand on my shoulder that I flinched back from. Damn, I thought I wasn't supposed to do that. What would happen if i was playing scary dungeon bat from my dreams? It would all be ruined at that moment. Good thing it went with this character.</p><p>	The old man took his hand off of my shoulder quickly and said, “I’m going to help you Mr.Riddle. I promise.”</p><p>	I looked up at him through my longish hair in a way that I knew made me look innocent. I had the fake innocence and trust rolling off of me in waves. God, I hope he at least feels a little guilty after all this work. I nodded at him slowly.</p><p>	He just barely held back a wince. He nodded back and stood up. Right after he left I lost the act. My shoulders went back to their normal perfectly straight posture and my eyes turned as cold as ice again. I picked up the book I had set down and began reading again.</p><p>	Lamary, my lovely snake, crawled out after the man left. She wrapped herself around my shoulders and said nothing. That was the reason I let her stay around. She knew that I liked my silence and would only talk when she knew it wouldn't agitate me.</p><p>	“This one ssseemsss different massster.”</p><p>	Usually.</p></div>
