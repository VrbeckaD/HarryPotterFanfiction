    <p> </p><p>Professor McGonagall stood above all of the students in long emerald robes, behind the podium.. Before she began her speech she cleared her throat sharply. The whole great hall was silenced as the first years were led in by Filch and Professor Slughorn. The first years were all whispering and pointing, mostly at Potter, but some he noticed were giving Draco scared looks as they pointed. Draco sank down in his chair, he wanted to crawl into the floor and never come out again. Pansy gave him a knowing look and placed her hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“Ignore them they have no idea what you’ve been through,” she said in a hushed voice, her breath hitting his neck.<br/>
As the first years were sorted there was a noticeable change in their reactions to placement. There were only 1 or 2 newly sorted slytherins who looked even remotely happy about their placement, and cheering for them was definitely at an all-time minimum. This wasn’t very shocking to Draco but he could tell that many of the older slytherins looked not only uncomfortable but almost upset.<br/>
After the sorting was finished, McGonagall spoke:</p><p>“Good evening students, it is a new year at hogwarts, one which will be quite different from usual. Some of your former classmates will be returning as 8th year students due to-” she paused, clearing her throat, “poor academic growth and nurturing. Because of the fact that there only enough rooms in each common room, we will be using the extra set of dormitories located in the dungeons.”<br/>
The students in the great hall began to stir, whispering about all of the returning students.<br/>
“Quiet!” McGonagall ordered. The whispering died down.<br/>
“As I was saying, because of the lack of accommodations, as well as in support of inter-house unity, each house will be split between several rooms. Each student will be paired with another from a different house.” There were some screams of protest from around the hall, most of which were Gryffindors. “SILENCE!!” the great hall became so quiet that you could’ve heard a pin drop. “The list will be announced in your dormitories, which I will lead you to shortly. Now, without further ado, you may begin,” She then held out her hands and ordered the beginning of the feast.<br/>
Draco’s mind was racing. He couldn’t imagine who he was going to be roomed with but whoever it was, he thought, as long as it wasn’t Potter everything would be fine.<br/>
When the food appeared on the tables Draco just stared. His stomach growled. After a few minutes Pansy pushed his shoulder, “you need to eat, Draco.”</p><p>Draco just shook his head.<br/>
“Please,” Pansy begged. Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed a slice of bread and ate it.<br/>
Pansy glared at him. “More than that.”<br/>
Draco was annoyed. “I’m fine.”<br/>
Pansy immediately hit his arm as hard as she could.<br/>
“Ow! That hurt, you know!”<br/>
“Good. You need to take care of yourself” Pansy said and began filling his bowl with vegetable stew.<br/>
“I told you I’m fi-<br/>
“No you’re not!” She started loudly then continued under her breath in an angry voice, “you’ve hardly been eating, you’ve barely been sleeping- and don’t try to argue with me I can see the dark circles under your eyes- and I know that you’re crying half of the time- again, don’t try, they’re all red and puffy.”<br/>
Draco opened his mouth to speak then instead began slowly eating the stew Pansy put in front of him. When he had eaten about half of the soup McGonagall called for the 8th years to go to their dormitories.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
When they reached the dormitories, which had 2 knights with swords crossing guarding the doors who would allow students to enter and exit  by uncrossing them. The first password they received was “strawberry pudding” which confused Draco but also somehow vaguely reminded him of Dumbledore. When Draco thought of Dumbledore his throat tightened and he had flashbacks of the night when his life could’ve been changed. He could have agreed to be helped. He could have dropped his wand and surrendered. Hell, he could have never been the villain again. But Draco only lowered his wand. He allowed death eaters into the school. He allowed Professor Snape to kill Dumbledore, was so conflicted that he could only stare when he was murdered. It should’ve been Draco who killed him, but then why did his death hurt Draco so much?<br/>
Draco shook his head in attempt to push away his thoughts. The extra common room was filled with lavish purple and rose gold couches and lounge chairs around a grand marble fire place, the room was almost modern, as if it had been renovated for the exact purpose of having the 8th years there (which it probably had been), but it was warm and inviting, the exact opposite of the slytherin common room. Draco wondered if this was what the gryffindor common room looked like and immediately shook off that thought.<br/>
When the group of 8th years gathered around McGonagall she began reading off names and rooms. She listed a couple of rooms with ravenclaws and hufflepuffs then got to slytherin and gryffindors. “Ronald Weasley and Blaise Zabini,” Draco was relieved that he at least wouldn’t be rooming with the weasel. McGonagall moved down the list and Draco was getting gradually more and more anxious seeing as one of the only people that wasn’t Draco was Potter. “Harry Potter…” Potter shuffled forward glaring holes through Draco’s head “and Draco Malfoy.”<br/>
Draco couldn’t help but exclaim “What the hell!”<br/>
“Language Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall responded.<br/>
“I assume you two are adult enough to avoid killing each other for the school year.” Potter was nodding calmly, clearly staring at Draco as if he was a rotten piece of meat while Draco gritted his teeth and nodded slowly, returning the glare.<br/>
She began to list rooms and rules, but Draco stopped paying attention after his room was announced as he was thinking about trying to avoid interacting with Potter as a roommate. He also contemplated not sleeping in the room at all, which honestly would probably have been fine because Draco wasn’t sleeping anyway, and when he did, he would end up feeling worse than he did before the rest. He could feel Pansy’s gaze sharp as he thought this, and couldn’t help but be a little amused by how well she knew him.<br/>
Once McGonagall was done droning on about house unity and rules, Draco immediately headed to his assigned room and collapsed on the bed furthest from the door, which was interestingly decorated in green and silver (the other was red and gold). Draco hadn’t intended to sleep, just rest his tired body but as soon as he laid his aching body on the soft cushions sleep engulfed him.<br/>
 <br/>
~ ~ ~<br/>
 <br/>
Harry came into his room to find a sleeping Malfoy on the farthest bed, still in robes. Harry grimaced at the reality that he was actually rooming with the biggest prick in 8th year, probably any year really. Harry sighed as he sat down in the chair next to the window, knowing full well that McGonagall probably did this on purpose because she knew anyone else would probably either be murdered or try to murder Malfoy in his sleep. Still, Harry was reluctant to accept the situation particularly considering that he wasn’t rooming with his best friend for the first time in his time at hogwarts. Lost in his thoughts Harry nearly dozed off whilst staring out the window, watching the interesting fish and other creatures swim past. He then looked curiously around the room. It was kind of mismatched considering the wallpaper was purple and bronze (with some animal Harry had never seen before; he assumed it must’ve been magical due to that), as well as gaudy purple carpeting. The rest of the room was decorated according to each boy’s house: the right side’s furniture was warm reds, gold’s and browns; the left side was decorated with cool greens, silvers, and blacks. Harry couldn’t help but have a chuckle at how ridiculous the room looked with the mix of strange colors, it looked almost as if they’d brought in furniture from both sytherin and gryffindor and just threw them in the room. He nearly jumped when Malfoy abruptly gasped and sat up, when Harry looked over Malfoy looked as if he’d been standing in the rain he was so drenched in sweat. Harry didn’t say anything though, he just shrugged it off, must’ve just been a bad dream. He could relate to at least that.<br/>
Malfoy stood up and walked out of the room, seemingly to get fresh air.<br/>
When Harry heard the door close, he got up to change clothes. He chose a t-shirt and flannel pants then pulled back the bed sheets and crawled into the bed. Harry didn’t think that it would be as easy for him to fall asleep as it was but the bed was so soft and warm that Harry wasn’t surprised Malfoy was able to fall asleep with robes on because slumber took him quickly, as well.<br/>
 <br/>
Harry’s dream was nothing short of terrible.<br/>
It started with the death of his parents, not something that Harry hadn’t seen in dreams before, still sad, but it stopped affecting him in the way it used to. Maybe now he was just numb to death. The next part of the dream skipped forward to the death of Sirius then went through Dobby, Hegwig, Moody and all of the people he knew who died in the final battle. After he saw Professor Lupin and Tonks the dream fell to black and he saw himself surrounded by his friends. Then one by one each one fell into a hole that suddenly appeared under their feet on the black floor. When Ron (the last person to go) fell through Harry began to fall.<br/>
As soon as the falling started Harry woke up with a jolt.<br/>
When opened his eyes there was light filtering into the room. Dawn. Harry rose from bed, wiping the sweat off of his brow and headed into the bathroom. He noted that Malfoy’s bed was neatly made and his trunk neatly packed. Harry wondered if he’d gotten up early or hadn’t slept, not that Harry cared actually. Unlike his last year attending hogwarts Harry had no intention of focusing on the negative. After all, the war was over. There was nothing else to worry about, right?<br/>
 <br/>
After about an hour of sitting in his dorm staring into the bottom of the lake- it was a perspective that was new and exciting and Harry was enjoying every minute of it- Harry decided to venture into the common room, but when he left his room cackling Dean and Seamus were standing in front of Ron’s shared room with Blaise. “Oh god Harry! You’ve- got- to- see- this!” Dean breathed between laughs. Then he heard Ron’s cries. “It’s not funny! Help me you guys! Please!!” Ron begged. Then Harry saw Ron in pyjamas but he still had red and gold sheets behind him. “Wait…” Harry started before he also started laughing. “Yes ha ha very funny, Zabini put a sticking charm on my bed sheets, now, please for the love of god, help me get them off!” Ron wailed. Harry calmed down and went over to where Ron was standing. “How’d you get the sheets off of the bed, mate?” Harry said while removing Ron’s already unbuttoned shirt. “They came off of the bed quite easily just not my bloody clothes,” Ron replied bitterly.<br/>
When Harry had finally finished helping Ron get out of his sticking-charm covered nightshirt, he finally went ahead to the great hall where Hermione was already waiting.<br/>
Everyone in the great hall was bright and happy, it seemed as if the war had never even been a dream. Obviously the Slytherin table looked a wreck, in fact it was almost empty. It seemed almost as if the first years were ashamed.<br/>
Harry sat down across from Hermione and began stacking food on his plate. “Good morning, Harry,” Hermione greeted, obviously irritated that Harry hadn’t said anything as he sat down.<br/>
“Morning Hermione,” Harry replied, mouth full of pancake.<br/>
“Have you received your schedule yet? They’ll be arriving by owl this year. I suppose it’s a little more convenient than passing them out to each student individually. Especially considering Hogwarts is expanding its enrollment” Harry raised his eyebrow as Hermione said this.<br/>
“What do you mean expanding enrollment?” Ron interjected as he sat down next to Harry, who almost was startled by his best friend’s appearance.<br/>
“You dressed quickly,” Harry pointed out, with a snicker.<br/>
“Oh shut up, Harry,” Ron responded, rolling his eyes.<br/>
“What? What happened?” Hermione asked with a look of concerned mix of suspicion.<br/>
“Blaise Zabini put a sticking charm on Ron’s sheets last night,” Harry said for Ron. It was clear that Hermione was trying her damnedest not to laugh, but was unsuccessful.<br/>
“Oi! It’s not funny!” Ron protested at her laughter.<br/>
As she finished her chuckle Hermione said “sorry, sorry. So how’d you get out of it?”<br/>
“He pulled the sheets off with him and got help from me. After I was done laughing, of course,” Harry replied. Ron shot him a glare beside him.<br/>
“Those slytherins are evil. I swear if he does any bloody nonsense ever again, I’m gonna kill him,” Ron vowed in irritation.<br/>
“Oh calm down, it’s not that serious,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>“I could’ve never been able to get it off my skin! It could’ve been stuck there forever!” Ron whined.</p><p>“Oh calm down Ron,” Harry said with a shake of his head, continuing to eat his pancakes.</p><p>Harry wasn’t as hungry as he usually was after the summer because he had been living at grimmauld place and Creature had been making him breakfast every morning.</p><p>As Harry finished eating his schedule came in, carried in by Harry’s new owl, Otto, who was another who was another snowy owl, but had an unusual amount of gray feathers.</p><p>Harry stroked his owl’s head as he opened his yearly schedule. Usual classes along with the strange new ‘peer tutoring’ on Fridays at 3 in the library which McGonagall must’ve added during the summer.</p><p>“Hey, Hermione, do you have this class?” Harry asked and handed her his schedule, pointing to the class.</p><p>“Oh yeah. Professor McGonagall told me about it, she asked me for recommendations for people to help. I said you. After all, you were an excellent teacher for the DA,” Hermione said matter-of-factly.</p><p>“Ok but only Defense Against the Dark Arts,” Harry replied, “I’m only mediocre at everything else.”</p><p>“Oh, rubbish. At least you got good O.W.L.S I got mostly Es and only 1 A,” Ron grumbled.</p><p>“That’s because you don’t study,” Hermione responded pointedly.</p><p>“Harry doesn’t either!” Ron exclaimed.</p><p>Harry shrugged, “Occasionally, but anyway that was 2 years ago! Why should it matter?”</p><p>Hermione was shaking her head in exasperation before she slung her bag over her shoulder and got up from the table. “I’m heading to class,” she said, and with her hand on his shoulder, kissed the top of Ron’s head as she passed him.</p><p>Harry sighed with a slight twinge of jealousy because of their post-card happy relationship. Harry’s relationship with Ginny had not resumed after the war because she said Harry had changed too much. Harry wouldn’t go out of his house for a week. Hermione brought him at least 4 buckets of ice cream, but after weeks of moping he moved on and his friendship with Ginny was slowly mending.</p><p>As Harry and Ron left the school for care for magical creatures with Hagrid they passed a gaunt-looking Malfoy who was laying in the grass next to Pansy Parkinson, staring at Harry and Ron as they passed.</p><p>“Someone needs to tell Malfoy his girlfriend’s eying other boys,” Harry growled under his breath.</p><p>“They broke up,” Ron replied, “a while ago, actually. He’s <em>your</em> enemy and you didn’t even know that?”</p><p>Harry shrugged, “guess I just don’t listen to gossip, like you.”</p><p>Ron shoved Harry playfully, “oh sod off, Harry. Hermione tells me all that girly stuff.”</p><p>“Sure, whatever you want me to think,” Harry replied with laughter before being shoved again.</p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>Draco had just finished a dreamless nap under a large tree when he heard footsteps behind him. He looked up to see Pansy staring down at him, and rolled over on his side, facing away from her.</p><p>"You're skipping class," she commented.</p><p>"Very observant, Pansy, thank you," Draco replied icily.</p><p>"You need to graduate, Draco," Pansy commented pointedly and sat in the grass beside him.</p><p>Draco sighed and sat up. "You just can't leave me alone, can you?"</p><p>"Very observant, Draco, thank you," she mocked. Draco glared at her. "You really need to do something about those nightmares," she commented and then laid back in the grass, staring up at the bright blue, cloud-dotted sky.</p><p>Draco stretched back beside her, and replied in annoyance, “I’m fine.”</p><p>“No you’re not fine. Need a cookie? A trip to the hospital wing?” Pansy asked, only partially concerned; she was more teasing than anything else.</p><p>Draco grimaced and propped himself up on his elbows. “You and I both know that’s the last bloody place I’d like to go,” Draco responded, with a look of great distaste on his face.</p><p>After 4th year getting injured by bloody Potter’s curse going to the hospital wing had become one of the very last things on his priority list. Though it was good that Madam Pomfrey didn’t ask about his strange injuries and instead gave him some disgusting smelling herbs to place on the wounds as they healed overnight, which stung like a bitch, and ordered him to rest in the hospital wing.</p><p>Pansy’s expression sobered. “But in all seriousness you need help,” Pansy replied.</p><p>"And what is it you suppose I should do? There's not really anyone who'd listen to me of all people."</p><p>Pansy pouted, "I listen!"</p><p>"I'm very aware but I'm not keen on taking your advice," Draco said and then shrugged.</p><p>Pansy looked incredibly offended. "Fine then you don't have to talk to me if you don't want to! Find some other girl who'll listen to your whining!" She snapped and moved to get up, but Draco sat up and grabbed her wrist.</p><p>"Pansy, don't leave me!" Draco whined, still with a hold on Pansy's wrist.</p><p>She rolled her eyes and relaxed so that he would let go. Her expression softened "Draco you need someone to talk to... at least try."</p><p>She sat down then threw something at some hufflepuff 1<sup>st</sup> year, who gave her a scared look and ran away. They were followed by Potter and Weasley whom of which she proceeded to laugh at.</p><p>Draco hesitated before he changed the subject, “you know maybe if we stopped bullying people they wouldn’t hate us as much.”</p><p>Pansy looked at him, dumbfounded. “You want us to stop bullying people.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You who used to take the greatest joy in making hufflepuffs cry. Want. To stop. Bullying,” Pansy still looked gobsmacked.</p><p>Draco shrugged uncomfortably. “Just a thought…”</p><p>Pansy shook her head, her expression changed back to concerned. “I just don’t understand you anymore.”</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>“I mean you aren’t eating-</p><p>“Thanks, I’ve noticed” Draco interrupted before Pansy glared at him then continued.</p><p>“You’re barely talking and now you want us to <em>stop bullying</em>??? I realized that your mother’s disappearance was affecting you, but I didn’t realize it was this bad.” Draco winced at the mention of his mother and looked around, paranoid that someone was listening.</p><p>“I need to get to potions,” Draco said suddenly before jumping up with Pansy yelling in annoyance from behind him.</p><p>“Draco! Draco wait!” Pansy was trying to follow him but Draco was too fast for her.</p><p> </p><p>Draco was uncomfortable throughout all of potions remembering his conversation with Pansy. Slughorn seemed as if he didn’t know how to treat Draco, which didn’t make him feel any better. Granger and Potter made it so that Draco went relatively ignored until it was time for Slughorn to check their potions; then Slughorn awkwardly told him his brew was near perfect, which, of course, Draco knew. Instead of saying that he knew like he usually would have, he just thanked Slughorn, which caused the entire room of students to just stare at him in awe. In response Draco did the only thing he could do and scowled at his classmates which caused them all to look almost comfortable again.</p><p>After potions was over, Draco headed back to the dormitories and some 3<sup>rd</sup> year pushed him, knocking all of his books out of his hands, and said “stupid death eater” his friends followed in suit saying, “you clearly don’t belong here” “join Voldemort, where you belong.”</p><p>Draco shakily picked up up all of his stuff, stuffing it all in his open bag.</p><p>Draco returned to his dorm feeling even worse than he did before and went to the bathroom to take a shower.</p><p>When Draco got in the shower he immediately collapsed in a corner under the steaming water, and began to sob. His shoulders shook so hard he had to hold himself to keep from screaming. When Draco finally got around to actually washing his body, his hands were shaking so hard that he kept dropping the soap on the shower floor causing a clatter so loud it seemed as though the entire school should be able to hear it.</p><p>Images from the previous night’s nightmares played on repeat in his mind.</p><p>Pictures of his mother being captured, locked in a dark cell, alone and afraid. Draco imagined her being tortured and screaming, desperate for help, calling out Draco and his father’s names. Different dreams contained even more suffering for his mother and Draco’s worry to drastically increase. The dreams later in the night always consisted of her bleeding and/or screaming and Draco could never save her. He tried to call out to her, run to her, or help her, but he knew it wasn’t real and he couldn’t see her in real life nor knew what was truly happening, but not knowing anything made him even more afraid.   </p><p> </p><p>When Draco left the shower he felt incredibly nauseous and had a horrible headache. His limbs felt like they were made of lead and he barely had the energy to move.</p><p>He slowly wrapped a towel around his waist and returned to his shared room.</p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>Harry was confused by his potions class. How Malfoy looked hurt for a split second after he thanked Slughorn for his compliment. Harry hadn’t really thought anything of it, but it was the first topic of conversation when he Ron and Hermione met in the after class.</p><p>“I can’t believe he actually was polite to a teacher,” Ron whispered when they met in the hall.</p><p>“Who?” Harry asked. Hermione and Ron looked shocked. “You of all people should know who. In fact, I’m surprised you weren’t as shocked as us,” Hermione replied.</p><p>Harry shrugged. “People change.”</p><p>Ron and Hermione gave him another look of confusion before Ron asked Hermione to do his homework, which was just as fruitless as it had been all 6 other years at Hogwarts. When they returned to the common room, after promises to meet in the hall in 20 minutes, they all went their separate ways.</p><p> </p><p>When Harry returned to his room he immediately laid on his bed, not to nap or anything, just stare at the ceiling and ponder life. He was in mid-though when the bathroom door swung open to reveal Malfoy looking dreadful.</p><p>His eyes were red and puffy, like he must’ve been crying, his skin was even more white than usual- almost gaunt-, and his porcelain skin was exposed revealing the scars that scattered his torso. Without loose robes and thick clothing, it was clear that he was frighteningly thin, as if he’d barely been eating, each individual rib was able to be seen.</p><p>When Harry sat up he could’ve sworn that he had seen Malfoy jump.</p><p>Without even thinking Harry blurted out “have you been eating?” When Harry asked this he looked startled almost glad, and Harry wondered how often he’d been asked about his health before.</p><p>However, his happiness only lasted a short time before he buried it and snarled back, “what do you care?”</p><p>“Please I’m only trying to help you, I just… I know what it’s like to feel alo-”</p><p>Malfoy scowled and spat- interrupting Harry-, “wouldn’t you like to know, saint Potter.”</p><p>“I was just trying to help!” Harry snapped back.</p><p>“SHUT UP! You don’t know what it’s like to be me you don’t know anything about me! Stop trying to play the hero for people who don’t want saving!” Malfoy looked distressed, but also angry.</p><p>“You could at least try to get help,” Harry snapped back.</p><p>“Next time I need your help, which will be never, I’ll be sure to immediately come crying to savior of the wizarding-world and chosen one like the rest of your damn fool followers,” Malfoy hissed in return his voice venomous and oozing sarcasm. Their voices gradually raised as the conversation went on.</p><p>“Well next time I try to help someone it won’t be an ungrateful death eater who only has one friend!” Harry was at a yell. Malfoy was looking at Harry with a look of hurt; Malfoy looked as if he’d been slapped across the face. Harry realized that his comment had gone to far. Even for an enemy.</p><p>They just stared at each other for a minute and then, breaking the long silence, Harry spoke, “Alright then…” Harry replied and then shut the door to their room and went down the stairs.</p><p> </p><p>Harry could hardly stop himself through dinner from thinking about Malfoy’s naked torso and his clearly visible ribs. When Harry looked over at the Slytherin table Malfoy was lightly touching his food. Harry almost got up and went over to him but internally kicked himself because he knew that he would not be greeted welcomingly.</p><p>Harry was almost angry with himself; after all of the things that Malfoy had done to Harry and his friends he had begun feeling <em>sorry</em> for the disgusting prat. Harry shook his head and continued to furiously munch on his roll.</p><p>“Harry, Harry!” Harry was staring into space when Hermione shook him.</p><p>“Sorry,” Harry muttered. Hermione sighed and just shook her head.</p><p>“You need to stop thinking about it, you know,” Hermione said.</p><p>“Thinking about what?” Harry was scared that she’d figured out that he’d been thinking about Malfoy all of dinner. She was very perceptive.</p><p>“The war,” she replied while Harry- thankfully- restrained himself from letting out a relieved sigh, “I know you had the worst time in the war and it must be really hard on you. You shouldn’t dwell on it.”</p><p>Harry didn’t actually know how to respond and instead just nodded and followed Hermione and Ron into the hallway.</p><p> </p><p>When Harry returned to his room, after having a small welcoming party in the common room with all the returning Gryffindors (Neville, Seamus, Dean, Ron, Hemione etc.), Malfoy seemed to be asleep, and Harry put on his pyjamas before settling in bed to sleep. That was when the crying and screaming started. At first Harry thought that he was already asleep, and maybe dreaming about one of his old scenarios with Voldemort, but when he opened his eyes Malfoy was sitting up in his bed panting. This happened about 3 or 4 more times before Harry decided to go downstairs and sit in the common room, maybe he’d get some quiet there. Harry was sitting curled up on the couch when he fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>“Draco!” his mother cried as an invisible man cast the cruciatis curse again. Draco had seen people being tortured before, at some point he even became numb to it, but this, in these dreams he felt like he was being tortured too. His mother’s pain caused Draco more pain than he ever could imagine. Draco tried to move, but it was as if he was chained to the walls. All he could do was call out to her. He screamed as they cast curses and torturous spells. Draco began to sob. He could feel his body shaking. He heard them cast the killing curse but before it hit his mother Draco was awake, screaming. That night he had woken up at least 5 times, he didn’t know ,though, since he wasn’t counting. The last time he woke up he checked his watch, and it was 4 am, Draco weighed his options and decided that it was probably better for him to stay awake. Draco got dressed and started working on his potions homework. He had completed the assignment by breakfast.</p><p>Draco decided to skip breakfast and instead went outside to the lake to read. He started reading a book on the History of Potions (volume 113). It wasn’t too long before Pansy found him, and hit him over the head with his copy of History of Potions (volume 114).</p><p>Draco glared up at her. “The hell was that for?” Draco growled.</p><p>“For not being at breakfast, idiot,” Pansy said as she hit him again then sat down.</p><p>“Ok, ok, sorry, I’ll be at lunch,” Draco replied in hopes of making her go away so he could finish his book.</p><p>“Do you need to talk about anything?” Pansy asked with concern.</p><p>Draco sighed, though he knew that she wouldn’t have gone away. “Don’t you have anything better to do, something that’s not pestering me?” he said with raised eyebrows.</p><p>Pansy huffed, “honestly why do I even try with you?”</p><p>“Try what?”</p><p>“Being your friend, you prat! All I want is to help you feel better, to make you feel less alone but all you do is treat me like shite! I’m tired of it! If you decide you actually want to be my friend just ask, but otherwise you don’t belong in my life anymore Draco!” when Draco looked up at Pansy she was crying.</p><p>Draco wanted to say something before she ran away but he had no idea what. All he knew was that his already miserable life had just gotten worse. Draco was alone.     </p>
