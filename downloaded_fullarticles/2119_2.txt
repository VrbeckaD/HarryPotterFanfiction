  <u> <b>Prologue – For Want of a Nail</b> </u>
</p><p align="CENTER"> </p><p align="CENTER">
  <em>On September 1<sup>st</sup> 1991, a young boy was introduced to a world that had been hidden just out of sight. However, unlike many other instances of him, he boarded a different train compartment that was not visited by a red-headed child, but was instead occupied by a girl surrounded by books.</em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">In the ruined centre that was once the Great Hall of Hogwarts, two figures stood across from each other in a scene of carnage and destruction; glaring at one another. On one side amidst the twisted forms of defender and Death Eater alike was the greatest Dark Lord to have plagued the Wizarding World since Grindelwald: Lord Voldemort.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The dark wizard's once immaculate robes were now little more than rags, barely clinging onto the emaciated homunculus' form. Several wounds were on Voldemort's body that included large and small burns, bruises and other freshly bleeding wounds that wept out a strange silvery ichor which hissed and bubbled as it hit the stone floor. The largest of which was a great gash across his chest, courtesy of one very brave and very dead Gryffindor.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">On the other side, a short boy that looked to be barely out of puberty kept a quivering hand pointed towards the dark lord. Looking far more exhausted and with more visible wounds, the fierce light that shone within the emerald eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived never dimmed as he glared right back at his nemesis. The cloak of Ignotus Peverell was draped around his shoulders, tightly wrapped around a rather deep wound. It was an almost crippling thought of how many more friends he would be apologizing to through the use of the Stone that lay within his pocket. Harry Potter's face was a rictus of rage, sorrow and determination as he stood amongst the broken and awfully still forms of his friends and family.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="center">
  <em> <b> <u>“The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches...”</u></b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“No more, <em>Tom</em>.” Harry broke the strange silence that had elapsed between the two of them first. The cold power that he could feel within the Elder Wand was so very alien to his old wand. It had a cold, ruthless and very awful <em>inevitable</em> feeling to it that contrasted so strongly to the gentle warmth and excitement of his old Phoenix wand. “This ends here.” But it would be enough to finish the job started so very long ago.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="center">
  <em> <u> <b>“...Born to those who have thrice defied him,”</b> </u> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Voldemort's face twisted at the utterance of his cast-off name, though he did not immediately devolve into a fit of rage like he had so many times before. That had cost him far too much, thanks to Neville Longbottom, who had been completely bisected at the waist, still clutching the sword of Godric Gryffindor. Both wizards were on their last legs, in terms of physical fortitude and magical reserves.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="center">
  <em> <u> <b>“Born as the seventh month dies...”</b> </u> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The next spell would be the deciding one.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Voldemort's pale hand tightened around his wand, his lips parting in tandem with Harry's own as the very air seemed to charge itself with electricity. The ambient magic that resided within Hogwarts' ancient grounds mixed with the magic of the two wizards as various detritus that littered the hall were twisted and warped into strange crystalline amalgamations of beast and reptile.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“<em>AVADA KEDAVRA!</em>”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="tw-target-text" rel="nofollow" id="tw-target-text"></a> “<em>FLAMMIS IUSTITIAE!</em>”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The sickly green spellbolt of Voldemort's met the golden flames of Harry's, colliding in the middle of the hall with an explosion of sound and color. Magical energy poured into great waves from each of their wands, bolstering their respective spells whose forms began to twist and coalesce into shapes that matched their masters. A basilisk with burning red eyes thrashed against a magnificent golden stag that was wreathed in flames. Each clash between the two great beasts shook the very foundations of the ancient castle.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="center">
  <em> <u> <b>“...and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal...”</b> </u> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b> </b> ' <em> Flammis Iustitiae </em>' or when translated: 'Flames of Justice' was Harry's final trump card. It was a legacy spell (of sorts) created by Dumbledore during his final years as a means of dealing with Voldemort's horcruxes (a backup to venom-enhanced swords and giant snake fangs) that was then passed down to Harry in his sixth year. In fact, it was with this very same spell that he used to cleanse Slytherin's ring of it's parasitic host. The catch was that it was an incredibly magically intensive spell, to the point that only Harry was able to cast it and even then, he could only manage a single casting before being competely drained of all energy. It was only thanks to the sheer power of the Elder Wand and it's similarity to the Patronus Charm that he wasn't collapsing underneath it's staggering demands.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> And yet...! </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Harry's teeth felt like they were going to crack from how hard he was clenching them. Strange esoteric runes (of which he only recgonized a fraction of) wriggled like worms up and down Voldemort's exposed flesh, pulsating to their own eerie beat that seemed to coincide with a burst of fresh power that further pressed against Harry's own spell. Despite all of the advantages he possessed, Voldemort was a magical powerhouse whose brilliance matched that of Dumbledore's with a depravity that knew no bounds. He locked eyes with Voldemort who had a fierce grin on his face as an unbidden thought came to his mind; the stag faltering in it's assault that the basilisk immediately capitalized on.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">'<em>He was going to die a snivelling mongrel.</em>'</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">'<em>Wait, since when do I</em>-' Harry sucked in a deep breath that sent an agonizing flash through his ribs. Voldemort's chuckle somehow managed to be heard over the raucous magical din.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Keep those Occlumency barriers up now!” Voldemort had already slipped out of his mind before he could retaliate in any fashion as the spellcasting battle took a decisive turn for the worse.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">No matter how much Harry tried rallying up his already fleeting reserves of power, that one mistake had proved far too costly in this magical battle. Sensing that victory was soon within his grasp, it was rather typical that Voldemort could not resist one last taunt.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“This is it, <em>Harry</em>.” putting a mocking inflection on his name just as Harry did with his own. “There are no more professors to hide behind.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">'<em>Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall. </em></p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“No more friends!” His growing rage was reflected as the basilisk pushed the stag back even further.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">'<em>Hagrid.</em> <em>Hedwig.</em> <em>Ron. Dobby. Neville. Ginny. Luna. Fred. George. Draco. Everyone in the DA...Because of me!</em>'</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“No more <em>snivelling </em>fathers!” The cursed basilisk took a particularly vicious bite out of the incandescent stag that sent a white-hot pain coursing through Harry's arm. He staggered backwards, which Voldemort gleefully seized upon and pushed his spell even further.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">'<em>Dad! Sirius!</em>'</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“NO MORE FILTHY MUDBLOODS!” Black streaks seeped from Voldemort's wand and crept up the emerald snake, which seemed to feed on the wizard's rage and madness as it took on an even more malevolent appearance. The sheer fury coupled with pure ecstasy on Voldemort's face had never made him look more inhuman at this point.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b>'A red-haired woman pleaded for her baby's life. The baby in question smiling at his mother initially, now crying as she got louder and louder.'</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“<em>YOU ARE NOT THE CHOSEN ONE, </em> POTTER! <em>YOU NEVER WERE!</em>”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b>'A red-faced girl with frizzy brown hair and a sheepish smile. A train ride that was filled with far too many sweets, book recommendations and laughter...'</b></em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"><em> “LORD VOLDEMORT SHALL REIGN FOR ETERNITY!!!</em>”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="center">
  <em> <u><b>“...but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not...”</b></u></em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“<em> <u> <b>No.</b> </u> </em>”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The basilisk bounced off the stag that it had previously been pushing back with growing ease. There, almost unnoticeable in it's size, were it not for the white-hot glow that burned even brighter than the stag...was a small otter resting between the antlers.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Harry was always more powerful than his peers. He was stronger than most adult witches and wizards, if not in skill or spell repertoire then certainly in raw power. With the Elder Wand, his natural abilities were enhanced to an even more absurd degree.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">'<em>Even so...</em>'</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b>'Hundreds of dementors descended upon an innocent man and his godson. Harry stood hidden behind a bush with Her. He couldn't wait for someone he knew now wouldn't ever come. He stood up, more magic surging within his body than had ever before as an incantation left his lips.'</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">A Grim burst out of his wand, closely followed by a doe and a wolf; joining the stag and otter. He could feel the Resurrection Stone pulsing at a different beat to his own heart in his pocket. With every beat, another figure would surge out of his wand to join the army that was now beating back a wildly flailing basilisk.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">'<em>I wouldn't be here without them!'</em></p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <b> <em>'“Oh! Before I forget! I got somethin' fer yer...” the giant of a man turned around and rummaged through his bag in front of the petrified Dursleys and stupefied Harry. He pulled out a rather tattered old box and nervously presented it to the boy.</em></b>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> Befuddled, Harry opened the box and gasped at it's contents: a brightly colored cake decorated with pink frosting with the impossible set of words 'HAPPEE BIRTHDAE HARRY' emblazoned on it in a green icing that matched his own eye color.</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> “I made it meself!” stated Hagrid proudly. A tear fell down Harry's face as he continued to stare at the cake absentmindedly. </b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> A cake that was made just for him. </b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> Hagrid seemed to lose his confidence and whispered anxiously, “Hope you don' mind the buttercream frostin'. S'all I had on hand.”'</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">'<em> Their kindness! When no one had paid him anything of the sort before! </em>'</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">A small, shimmering lamb burst out of his wand and dashed towards where his fellows were doing battle with Voldemort's basilisk. It let out a mighty bleat that belied it's dimunitive size; the sound causing the emerald serpent to rear back in pain as the Grim and werewolf gleefully set upon it's weakned form.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“W-What is this magic?!” cried a stricken Voldemort.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b>'“Wingardium Leviosa!” </b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> The massive club that was about to crush the pair of Harry and Hermione screeched to a halt in mid-air. They both turned wide-eyed to their unexpected saviour who was standing at the threshold of the bathroom with a fierce look on his face.</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> Ronald Weasley slashed his wand downwards causing the massive club to smash down onto the troll's head. The troll moaned as his eyes immediately rolled upwards and took one tremulous step forwards before crashing down to the ground completely insensate.</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> The trio panted as the adrenaline faded from their bodies and Harry and Hermione stared at the redhead who slowly put his wand away. Ron's previously determined expression faded as he looked at Hermione with a mix of nervousness and shame.</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> “I...” Ron visibly gathered himself, “I'm really, really, REALLY sorry for what I said Hermione. I hope you can forgive me!”'</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">'<em> Their loyalty! No matter how rough things got or what happened between them, they would always be there...! </em>'</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">A jubilant Jack Russell terrier surged from Harry's wand howling as it was surrounded in an aura of crimson flames before dashing off to the defence of it's brethren.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Voldemort snarled and roared something in a language that caused Harry's vision to blur and his bones to ache. A shifting black ichor seeped out of his wand that spilled out into several puddles that hovered just before hitting the floor, before they abruptly expanded into great cloaked figures that joined his spectral basilisk. <b> </b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <b> <em>'Neville shakily stood up to his feet and faced the three Gryffindors, his wand nowhere in sight.</em></b>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> “You-you three are planning on sneaking out again? Aren't you?” Their guilty faces were answer enough as the pudgy eleven year old tried to form a scowl, “You're-you're going to get Gryffindor in trouble again!”</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> “Neville, mate, just let us-”</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> “No!” yelled Neville, cutting off Ron. “I won't let you! I'll-I'll” Harry's eyes widened as Neville put up his fists in a ready stance, trembling all over, “I'll fight you!”'</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">'<em> Their courage inspires me to keep moving forward! </em>'</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">A smiling blonde face took the forefront of Harry's memory with another burst of heat emanating from the Resurrection Stone that heralded the arrival of a lumbering bear covered in golden fire that roared and batted away a pseudo-Dementor harrying the terrier.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <b> <em>'Another night with Dursleys, another night sent to his room without any food.</em></b>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> Somehow he thought discovering that he was a wizard would have changed things.</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> Well, technically he wasn't sent alone to the cupboard anymore. </b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> He had been upgraded to the much classier version of Dudley's second bedroom. His charming cousin had even thoughtfully left old bits of food to attract bugs in out-of-the way places in a never before seen usage of brainpower. </b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> Upsides and downsides, he supposed.</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> Maybe they're just waiting to send him a whole bunch of stuff on his birthday. He flopped onto his bed (also an upgrade, if he didn't pay attention to the rusty springs that poked through the mattress) with a sigh.</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> “Prek!”</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> Harry blinked and then looked apologetically at Hedwig, going over to her cage and stroking her feathers.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> Owls were brilliant.</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> “Sorry girl. You're probably pretty hungry. I expect you'll have a busy night hunting.” Harry walked over to his window (will the upsides never cease to end?!) and unlatched it with practised movements, making sure he didn't make too much noise. The warmth of an English summer night hit him along with a refreshing cool breeze.</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> “Beautiful night too. Wish we could go flying together. Unfortunately we'll have to wait until school starts up again.” He sighed and shook his head, stroking Hedwig's soft feathers, “Listen to me mope. You go enjoy yourself girl. At least one of us should.”</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> “Prek!” Hedwig's wings unfurled, but instead of the feeling of her talons tensing before she took off into the night, she simply gently smacked the back of Harry's head.</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> “Hedwig?” In lieu of an answer, his odd owl jumped to the windowsill, resolutely turned her back on the night and then jumped into Harry's arms with outstretched wings.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> Feeling like a frog was stuck in his throat, Harry closed the window and slid down the wall until he was sitting on the floor with his friend.'</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">'<em> Their unwavering support! To let me know that I was no longer alone! </em>'</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Hedwig's echo soared out like a comet as she blasted towards the otter that was nestled within the antlers of the stag. She flew in a tight spiral, picking up more and more speed that generated a whirling vortex of raw magical energy that caused the pseudo-Dementors to spin out of control from the winds that were suddenly kicked up. None of Harry's army was affected however, and her support helped beat back the tide of Voldemort's spectres.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">There was an expression on Voldemort's face. It was something that he had never seen before on the dark wizard.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b> </b> <em> <b>'His feet were already moving the second he saw the message on the wall.</b> </em></p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b> Harry honestly found Ginny's crush extremely off-putting, even when he didn't consider that she was Ron's sister, Harry had never thought he would be so embarassed when someone paid TOO much attention to him. </b> </em>

  <em> <b> But she wasn't cruel to him. </b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">

Remember the basics of tandem spellcasting, don't force a connection, but instead...?” she trailed off in a questioning tone.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Harmonize it.” Despite not casting a spell, Twilight's horn lit up in a pale corona of violet energy and Celestia could feel her student's magic ever so gently mixing with her own. She was still a bit hesitant, but as expected, she was still a little better than she was the last time they had tried something like this.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">This state of constant improvement was both a source of great pride and a small fear in Celestia. A fear that Twilight's own drive and natural talents would cause her to embark on a road devoted to seeking more and more power regardless of the cost. But unlike with Sunset Shimmer, Twilight at least had her family and Cadance to call upon. She even had a small circle of acquaintances – sadly, they weren't friends yet, but Celestia had hope they would be in time – who she spent time with, particularly one little filly by the name of Moondancer.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Shaking her mind free of such worries for the moment, Celestia instead overlapped her own magic with Twilight's and drew it into a protective embrace. She smiled as Twilight unconsciously snuggled closer to her as she did this as she watched with her mind's eye as Twilight's magic zoomed off towards the sky.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“It's getting really warm now...but it's not uncomfortable. I can feel...<em> more </em> of you the farther I go...” Twilight trailed off half in wonder and half in deep thought. She shook herself free a few heartbeats later, “And there's something at the end of your – <em> our </em> – magic, it feels <em> ancient </em> and so... <em> vast </em>...”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b>A great molten ball of fire and magic hundreds of times bigger than the entire planet, hovers in the cold reaches of outer space. It casts it's light out in all directions of the void, but if one were to look closer, they would see that a bit more light and a bit more warmth is directed towards a certain spot in Equestria where a pure white alicorn stares back at it. </b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Twilight gasped, though Celestia was very pleased to note that her magic barely wavered at all, before re-syncing with her own aether connection; a feat that most mages with decades more experience compared to Twilight have managed.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“P-Princess. W-what is that?” Twilight's eyes opened and were wide with awe.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“That is our world's oldest protector. The one who brought warmth to the world and life to it's inhabitants. It is the light that allows itself to be moved so that others may bask in it's presence.” lectured Celestia, her voice taking on a more passionate tone as she gazed towards the source of the mark that adorned her flanks.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“It is a very dangerous and potent power in the wrong hooves. One that could easily take away the life that has bloomed on this wonderful world. My own connection to the Sun is a bit more intimate than most, as I'm sure you can feel.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Do...you feel like this every day, Princess?” breathed Twilight, her eyes focused on the same distant (but oh so close) star as she was.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Over the centuries the feeling of awe has diminished, yet every day when I am raising it and setting it down...” she breathed out deeply, “...that first moment when I make an active connection, I feel like a filly all over again.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Allowing herself just a brief moment to lose herself in nostalgia, Celestia gained a mischievious twinkle in her eye as she looked at her young prot<em>é</em>g<em>é </em>. “And today, you'll be helping me give it that last nudge to lower it.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="CENTER">
  <em> <b>~Equestrian Elegy~</b> </em>
</p><p align="CENTER"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b> </b>One of her favourite parts of having pupils was when she got the opportunity to tuck them into bed. Celestia smiled softly at the deliriously happy expression still on Twilight's face as she pulled the blanket over her. Spike was already asleep by the time they got back to Twilight's quarters who was sleepily still trying to ask more questions about the celestial bodies around the planet.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Good night, Twilight. Sweet dreams.” a slight frown crossed her muzzle at the last part of her sentence, but quickly vanished as she pressed a kiss to Twilight's forehead.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">A quick build up of her mana after one last look at her student and Celestia teleported herself back to her room. Her regalia was levitated off of her in an age-old routine as she stepped out onto the balcony, staring up at the moon and the image of a pony plastered across it's surface.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Oh, Luna...” she sighed. “Six more years. Only six more and we will finally meet again, dear sister.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Tomorrow would mark the nine hundredth and ninety-third Summer Sun Celebration with the event occurring in Manehattan this year. She was sure the ponies of Equestria and those who chose to visit the nation would all have a wonderful time as usual.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Even as her smiles towards the masses became more strained with every passing year.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The knowledge that she still hadn't found proper successors to all the Elements gnawed on her. She had candidates, for sure, ponies that embodied each of the different aspects of Harmony were in different locations. The most promising were located in Ponyville, as close as possible to where the physical forms of the Elements rested. Some were fortunate happenstance and others she had enticed over with promising job offers or opportunities.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Though she cherished all of her ponies dearly, these ones were secretly watched over by her very best.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="CENTER">
  <em> <b>~Equestrian Elegy~</b> </em>
</p><p align="CENTER"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Within the sleepy hamlet of Ponyville inside of a small, well-kept cottage, there was an extremely fluffy pink pony with blue eyes who looked at the moon with a stern expression that didn't seem to fit her face.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The fluffy pony then proceeded to promptly blow a raspberry at the Mare-In-The-Moon.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“<em> Thhbbpphhhtttt </em>.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="CENTER">
  <em> <b>~Equestrian Elegy~</b> </em>
</p><p align="CENTER"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">And Canterlot was closeby if any serious problems were to arise, though Celestia knew very well that she couldn't prepare for everything. Despite all the power that was entrusted to her and what her ponies may believe, she wasn't all-knowing or all-powerful.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">After nearly a thousand years of ruling alone and seeing friends pass away while she remained untouched by the ravages of time...</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Well.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">She was certainly glad she had Cadance now. Assuming everything went well, she might – no, she <em> would </em> get her sister back.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">And in the very best case scenario, maybe, just <em> maybe </em> Twilight could-</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="CENTER">
  <em> <b>The world lit up as the brilliance of one who has transcended beyond mortal flesh descends upon the world.

</p><p align="CENTER"> </p><p align="CENTER">
  <em> <b>I AM HERE</b> </em>
</p><p align="CENTER"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Celestia nearly collapsed to her knees at the unexpected surge of...<em>Alicorn</em> magic. Unlike when her niece Cadance had become an Alicorn, this surge contained none of the warmth and passionate feelings associated with love. It felt far colder, more ancient and all encompassing...</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">...something that felt like the Sun being <em>snuffed</em> out.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Steeling herself, Celestia looked once more towards the moon and breathed out a sigh of relief when she saw that the image of Luna had not disappeared. For a moment however, her breath hitched as she felt the subtle tellings of space warping on the balcony, though considering the wards weren't reacting and what had just occurred, she had a good feeling as to who was paying her a midnight visit.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> <b>Pop!</b> </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">A slender, pink alicorn mare blinked into existence as the light blue corona of her magic faded into shimmering motes of mana. Her normally well-groomed mane and tail was in a mess, as if she had just fallen out of bed and though the night was pleasantly warm, she was shivering.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“A-Auntie C-Celestia-” stuttered Cadance. Tears were prickling the corners of her eyes and were beginning to spill down her face.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">It was easy to see her niece was very distressed and Celestia had found herself already closing the distance between them and enveloping her into a tight hug.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Shhh. It's alright Cadance.” she murmured, as Cadance snuggled into the embrace still shivering. Celestia was saddened as her fur felt increasingly damp with her niece's tears who started to sob in quiet, painful and just <em>awful</em> wracking bursts.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Something...something woke me up and it f-felt so, so, so <em>sad</em> and <em>lonely</em> as if I'd never see my friends, my parents, or Shiny, or Twili or <em>you</em> e-ever again!” Cadance wailed the last part and clutched at Celestia, seeking whatever comfort she could get from the older princess.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The next words of reassurance and comfort that she was about to say, died on Celestia's tongue when she felt a second, somewhat weaker, pulse of that same – <em><b>InevitabilityCessationUntiringInexorable –</b></em> magic made itself known once again. Judging by how Cadance suddenly stiffened in her embrace, it was easy to tell that she had felt it too.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Without speaking any words, the two alicorns linked their senses together and followed the quickly fading eddy of magic back to it's potential source. A frown crossed Celestia's face as she looked towards Ponyville and the ominous forest that bordered it.</p><p> </p>
