    <p>The sun was almost setting when Theseus apparated onto the rooftop of a building. He peered over the parapet, frowning when his target had yet to appear.</p><p>----------</p><p>Theseus had received an update from a junior auror, who had found it suspicious that numerous copies of a permit were made, each with a different handwriting and reason but signed off by the same person. In these difficult times, especially with Grindelwald on the loose just days prior, it pays to be vigilant, no matter how insignificant some things may be.</p><p>Based on information already gathered, this particular wizard apparently had contact with Grindelwald before, and thus Theseus took it upon himself to investigate.</p><p>Using his position as Head Auror, Theseus managed to convince his colleagues that information gathering was something he could handle alone and delegated work to the other aurors to cover for his absence for the next five days. The junior aurors were in awe. A war hero going after a suspect alone, confident of returning with information, and seamlessly handling the department! A role model to follow!</p><p>----------</p><p>Moments later, another well-dressed lady apparated some distance away from Theseus.</p><p>"Theseus Scamander, you should be ashamed of yourself!" Leta hissed, attempting to channel some degree of annoyance in her words so that her fiance, most times wise but a thickhead at times like these, will understand.</p><p>"But Leta, I've said it before! I was just... Curious." Theseus whispered back, eyes scanning the ground. Why the both of them were speaking in soft tones, no one really could say.</p><p>"I cannot believe you would do this. Newt's old enough to do whatever he wants without you nosing around."</p><p>"Oh but Leta, this is Newt! He wouldn't visit the same state twice unless he forgot to document something, and he doesn't! He's definitely keeping something secret from us!"</p><p>"Hold your horses. There is no us in your agenda, and if Newt wants his secrets, just let him be Thes-"</p><p>Noticing a figure apparating to the corner of the alley, Theseus tugged hard at Leta's blouse, bringing her down mid-sentence so that they were both hidden from view. The noise from vehicles moving around at the main road just ahead of them drowned out any sound they made, but Theseus would not be taking any chances. He would not alert his target to their presence and risk losing it all.</p><p>Holding out his palm and gesturing for Leta to wait, Theseus raised himself higher to get a better view of whoever had appeared. The figure was looking around, and did not seem to have noticed them. Motioning to Leta, both of them were now crouched behind a parapet on top of a roof, heads peeking out just enough to see Newt walking confidently along the alley of the brownstone building in front of them. They saw Newt stop and look up at the back, sending a charmed paper owl flying into the window at the top of the building.</p><p>Shortly after, another woman's head appeared, and within minutes they saw the woman appear in front of Newt, with Newt hemming and hawing before presenting a wrapped package to her.</p><p>Theseus's eyes widen, his fingers gripping the concrete hard.</p><p>The woman with the package smiled at Newt. Newt reached out to tuck her hair behind her ear. She leaned in and kissed his cheek.</p><p>Theseus stood up and was about to open his mouth and say something before he felt a hand on his mouth and the familiar feeling of disapparating.</p><p>----------</p><p>Appearing near the docks, Leta released Theseus, mentally preparing herself for what Theseus had to say.</p><p>"I KNEW IT! My little bugger of a brother has a lady friend! That explains why he was so eager to get on the ship to America the moment his permit was approved, but claimed he was too busy to even have dinner with us! WITH ME! His poor older brother!" Theseus paced about, unable to contain his excitement.</p><p>"All this while I was so worried he would grow old alone, but looks like I worried for nothing! Oh Leta, I'm such a proud older brother!"</p><p>"Yes Theseus, now calm yourself. People are staring. While you're at it, could you please explain to me again why you thought it was a great idea to drop everything at the Ministry and stalk Newt here. He's a grown-up you know. Also, pray tell why you brought me along?"</p><p>"Err... Because I love you? And we both needed time away from work." Theseus offered his best smile, bringing out his charm card.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Yeah, and if anyone asked you can say I was being a prat and you came after me to get me out of trouble." Theseus winked.</p><p>Leta smiled, looking at her fiance.</p><p>"You're right, I'll always get you out of trouble." Leta took his hand, and Theseus led them towards the accommodations he had reserved for them.</p>
