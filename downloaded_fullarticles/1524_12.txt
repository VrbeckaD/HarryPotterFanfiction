    <p>“Gorgeous,” Draco whispered into the soft skin of Harry’s shoulder. “Absolutely gorgeous.”. </p>
<p>Harry laughed. He hadn’t felt quite so beautiful in the last few weeks, but there was something about the Draco’s reverent tone that he couldn’t help but believe. Goose-pimples rippled across his skin as the other man’s lips brushed against him, and he sighed, swaying into the touch. </p>
<p>“Not sure about gorgeous,” Harry murmured. “<em>Gluttonous</em> maybe. Chubby. I’ve put on a bit of weight-” </p>
<p>Sixteen pounds. More than a stone. Harry had weighted himself that morning, and watched in horrified amusement as the scales had stopped at two hundred and three. Fourteen and a half stone was the heaviest he’d been in his life. </p>
<p>“But I’m going to diet,” Harry stammered out hurriedly, “lose this starter belly that’s suddenly appeared. Go out for a run tomorrow-”</p>
<p>“Only if you want to,” Draco said, his long lithe fingers stroking the soft paunch beneath Harry’s navel. “Because chubby and gorgeous aren’t mutually exclusive… I love that there’s more of you,”  Draco purred, seductively. “More to adore...” </p>
<p>Harry felt his body respond to Draco’s velvety caresses. He looked down. Draco’s hand was slowly rubbing small circles over his tiny new belly, his palm present and comforting against his flesh. </p>
<p>It felt verboten, this curvy new realness of his body. <em>Forbidden</em>. </p>
<p>After all, he was Harry Potter, the Saviour. The Lead Auror whose fitness was always held as an example of svelte, muscled perfection. </p>
<p>But here, nestled in Draco’s arms, those ideas seemed farcical. </p>
<p>“Come to bed,” Draco asked, gently squeezing Harry’s tummy. “I’ve been admiring this belly for days. I can’t wait to explore every new inch with my hands… And my mouth. </p>
<p>To be held, with such adoration by the man you loved: now that was an intoxicating feeling. Draco lent over and found Harry’s mouth, his lips pliable and hungry. Harry melted into a kiss that was long, delicious and so full of need. </p>
<p>Harry imagined how his body might change were he not to diet, how he’d grow rounder and larger, how he’d slowly expand, swell to fill both of Draco’s hands. </p>
<p>The thought was entirely more enchanting than he’d ever dared imagine.</p>
