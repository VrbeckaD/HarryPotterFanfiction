    <p>'Feeling blue, Potter?'<br/> Harry was startled by the familiar voice that came from the alcove he just passed.<br/> Malfoy was staring at him with an odd expression on his normally haughty face. It didn't look like Malfoy was provoking him, in fact the Slytherin sounded more curious than anything else. Harry paused to consider the question.<br/> 'Uh… well, I suppose. I mean … do I look kind of blue?'<br/> Malfoy stared at him as if he had three heads and nodded slowly.<br/> Harry pondered over the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes' candy he just ate. He didn't actually feel as depressed as he should, but if even Malfoy found he was looking down, then that first Moodwing he took obviously worked.<br/> 'Well, it's supposed to last only for three hours, so I better look for some distraction in the meantime.' Harry supplied.<br/> The Slytherin's eyes widened noticeably. He stepped forward and a wicked smile appeared around his lips. 'You want a distraction?'<br/> Harry swallowed. He wondered if dry lips were a side effect from the wings too. And what the hell was Malfoy playing at? But Malfoy and playing in the same thought, did nothing for his dry lips, so instead he pondered on the question. Wouldn't the results be inaccurate if Malfoy did? Distract him, that is. But the only thing he'd agreed to, was testing this new product and let George know what the result was. Because the Moodwings were the first invention since Fred died, Harry simply hadn't been able to say no. But nobody said he had to revel in it, even when Malfoy would be the diversionary tactic.<br/> The same Malfoy who was still waiting with a raised eyebrow as if to say 'Yes or no?'.<br/> So Harry said, albeit reluctantly: 'Maybe.'<br/> Apparently the Slytherin considered that a yes, because he took another two steps and without hesitation grasped his shoulders and slammed their lips together.<br/> At once Harry forgot all about feeling down. This was brilliant! Why hadn't they done this before? Eagerly Harry participated until they were both out of breath. Dazed he looked over Malfoy's shoulder and then screamed in horror.<br/> In the window behind the Slytherin, Harry saw his face; a horrifying blue face! While his eyes almost dropped out of his blue head, Malfoy's hand cupped the bulge in his trousers and said huskily: 'It seems you'll need more distraction.'</p>

<p>The dorm was quiet when Harry woke up, except for some heavy snoring coming from Ron's bed. His hand accidently brushed against his morning wood and before he knew it his mind rushed back to last night. <em>To Malfoy.</em> He pulled his arm from under the blankets as if there was a Bast-Ended Skrewt underneath and groaned. Stupid Malfoy!<br/> Shouting 'what the fuck?' he had pushed Malfoy away so hard, the Slytherin had stumbled and fallen against the brick wall. Harry had fled like Umbridge for a herd of centaurs until he was in his room, where he'd laid down on his bed, panting. From the stairs of course! Not because of Malfoy. Just the stairs!<br/> Harry was grateful he'd decided to take that damned wing in the evening. Image the hilarity and name-calling if he'd arrived in the Great Hall looking like a bloody Cornish Pixie. Of course it was just his luck the only person he'd stumbled upon had to be Malfoy. Harry scowled.<br/> Suddenly he was startled by a tapping noise at the window. Recognizing the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes' owl, he hurried out of bed before the other boys would wake up. After all, it was a Saturday.<br/> The bird left right after Harry took the small parcel from his leg. Despite what had happened after the first candy, Harry was a bit curious. He unfolded the parchment and read:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Harry,</em>
    <br/>
    <em> How did it go last night? Let me know how very 'blue' you were feeling!</em>
    <br/>
    <em> To make it up to you, this wing will make you feel honourable for at least four hours.</em>
    <br/>
    <em> George.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Harry scowled when he was reminded of his blue face in the window, and picked up the second candy he'd promised to test. This wing was as red as the drapes surrounding his four-poster bed.<br/> Honourable. That sounded a lot better. Like a Gryffindor trait actually. He remembered hearing the Sorting Hat about chivalry amongst bravery and boldness. So, like the true Gryffindor he was, he put the red candy in his mouth and went to the bathroom. The other boys were waking up when he re-entered.<br/> 'Hey, Harry,' Seamus greeted him. 'Where were you last night? We missed you. Had a hot date?' He wiggled his eyebrows.<br/> Before he could help himself, Harry answered: 'In a corridor with Malfoy.'<br/> Silence fell over the room and stretched for what seemed like minutes until the other boys started laughing.<br/> 'Good one, Harry!'<br/> 'Right. Malfoy! Of course!'<br/> 'You almost got me, Harry.' When he went down to the common room, Harry was still a bit bewildered. What the hell possessed him to tell them that? Seamus would tease him relentlessly and Ron would kill him if he knew what happened. Or at least throw up.<br/> He found Hermione and Ginny waiting for the boys to go to breakfast.<br/> 'Good morning,' said Hermione.<br/> 'Hey, Harry!' Ginny smiled and tossed her hair over her shoulder. 'Wanna go to the lake this afternoon and have some fun?'<br/> He was still considering how he could refuse that in a … well, chivalrous way, when his mouth opened and he blurted out: 'If I want to have some fun, I'd rather go snog the Giant Squid!'<br/> 'Harry!' Hermione sounded displeased. Ginny said nothing but gave him a hurt look and left Gryffindor Tower. Hermione sighed before she went after her. To avoid looking at both girls he never took his eyes from his breakfast. What by Merlin's beard had come over him? He'd want to upset Ginny. And wasn't he supposed to be extra honourable today of all days? Hurting her feelings like that wasn't very chivalrous, he thought.<br/> When he heard Dean and Neville laughing about some joke, the near catastrophe in the dormitory came to mind. Why hadn't he been able to keep his mouth shut? Or at least told them a lie. <em>Not been able to tell a lie!</em><br/> Harry cursed softly. Damn George and his blasted candy!<br/> Unfortunately, Seamus had heard him and teased: 'Still thinking about your hot date, Harry?' While Ginny burst into tears, Harry escaped the Great Hall before he would answer the Irish boy. 'Potter! Need some distraction again?'<br/> Harry turned around in terror when he heard the familiar drawl behind him.<br/> <em>Oh, Merlin, no, not Malfoy again!</em><br/> He had planned to hide in an unused classroom until that stupid candy wasn't working anymore. Malfoy smirked and came closer. Harry's eyes widened when he found out he couldn't answer the question. Because he didn't know! <em>Oh, Merlin.</em><br/> He tried to back away only to find a desk blocking his way. Of course that was the perfect opportunity for Malfoy to step up and inquire: 'So maybe you enjoyed the distraction last night?'<br/> Harry tried to press his lips together but Malfoy was too close and the wing was still working and his traitorous mouth opened again. 'Yes.'<br/> Malfoy looked triumphantly and took another step, almost touching him. Harry felt the heat of his body and the fire in his breath when the Slytherin leaned over and whispered in his ear: 'Want me to do it again?'<br/> Harry closed his eyes, praying for something he didn't even know, and hissed through clamped teeth: 'Yesss!'</p>
