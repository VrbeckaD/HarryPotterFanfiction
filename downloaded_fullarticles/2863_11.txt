    <p>There are times when he walks the dark streets of London, fingers twitching for the next cigarette, and, closing his eyes to the flashes and glimmers of things he shouldn’t be able to see, wonders if things might have been different.<br/>It was Mycroft who had gone to Durmstrang, Mycroft who had insisted that Sherlock attend the foreign school as well. It was Mycroft whose minor position in the Ministry led to a powerful role in the British Government, and opened the door to Sherlock’s new life.<br/>He left the magic behind without a pang. He’d seen too many things in those seven years, and too much in the eleven years before that. Muggle drugs, he found, had four invaluable properties, which he could chose among by varying the dosage and kind: they alleviated his intolerable boredom, heightened his mental processes, dampened the memories, and- very occasionally- took him to the state where he could no longer distinguish what was unreal dreams and what impossible realities.<br/>He wishes he was a Muggle, unable to see the truth of things.<br/>He knows he could solve the cases easily, with a few circumspect spells, but instead he chooses cold logic as his instrument. He remembers, always, Mycroft’s first lesson: “Magic is a tool, subservient to the mind. Never forget that logic will take you farther than mere magic ever could.”<br/>He remembers this and he lives it.<br/>When there’s a case, he does not need the drugs. The thrill of solving it, aided only by his powers of observation and deduction, alleviates his boredom, exercises his mind, and distracts him from his past- his every thought and action an utter denial of his magic.<br/>At twenty-seven years old, he does not remember Eurus, or the devastation she wreaked when only four years old. He does not consider the dangers of suppressing his magic.<br/>But Mycroft does.</p>
