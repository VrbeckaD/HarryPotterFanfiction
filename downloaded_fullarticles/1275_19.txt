    <p>Percival Graves stood at the entrance to the ballroom, his arms folded across his chest, sceptically watching the hustle and bustle going on in front of him. Newt Scamander stood beside him, bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet, looking a lot more pleased.</p><p>“Isn’t it wonderful?” he asked, apparently ignoring the slight scowl on Percival’s face.</p><p>Percival grunted. “It’s certainly better than the last one,” he admitted, finally.</p><p>Giving out a laugh that caused almost every head in the room to swivel their way, Newt smacked him lightly on the arm. “Oh, come on,” he said. “I thought Queenie’s granddaughter did a lovely job!”</p><p>“Yes, if you’re a socialite from a hundred and fifty years ago having her first Season,” Percival grumbled.</p><p>Shaking his head, Newt tucked his arm through Percival’s and tugged him from the doorway out into the foyer of the building. “I thought you said at the time that the décor didn’t matter?” he teased.</p><p>“That’s true,” conceded Percival, tipping his head in agreement, “but it was still an eyesore.”</p><p>“You know,” another voice interrupted before Newt could respond, “it’s bad luck to see the groom before the wedding.”</p><p>“Tina!” Newt exclaimed, and spun around to grin at their friend, inadvertently dragging Percival with him. He wiggled his arm free from Percival’s, then draw Tina into an enthusiastic hug. “You made it!”</p><p>Tina laughed and patted Newt’s back. “Of course I made it,” she said as Newt finally let her go. “As if I’d miss this one in particular!”</p><p>Percival inclined his head in greeting. “Miss Goldstein,” he said. “I don’t think seeing the groom before the wedding makes much difference after the first go-round.”</p><p>“It’s Mrs Abernathy now, <em>sir</em>, as you very well know,” Tina said, raising an eyebrow pointedly at Percival. Then she smiled at them both. “What number does this make now, twenty seven?”</p><p>“Twenty nine,” Newt corrected.</p><p>“Thirty, if we’re counting the ceremony in Denmark,” Percival pointed out.</p><p>Tina shook her head. “You guys are crazy,” she said, fondly. “Are you planning on having a new wedding <em>every</em> time gay marriage is legalised somewhere?”</p><p>“Of course!” said Newt, as if there could be any other answer. “We have to make sure we’re considered legal <em>everywhere</em>.”</p><p>Percival shook his head as Tina opened her mouth. “Don’t bother,” he advised. “I made the same argument when Newt suggested the third wedding.”</p><p>“Well, <em>I</em> think it’s very sweet,” said yet another new voice. Glancing up towards the door, Percival squinted until the silhouettes resolved themselves into Queenie and Jacob Kowalski. Newt made a delighted sound and hurried across to them. The elderly No-Maj had just celebrated his 111<sup>th</sup> birthday, and it was only because of a little judicious help from Queenie that he was able to attend this event at all. Percival was fairly certain that it wouldn’t be much longer before nothing would help him anymore, although he was exceedingly careful to avoid saying this to Newt, and even more careful not to think it around Queenie herself.</p><p>“You should see it, it looks <em>magnificent</em>,” Newt was saying loudly, as he slowly drew both Jacob and Queenie towards the ballroom.</p><p>Tina folded her arms as she watched the slow progress her sister’s husband was making. “I’m glad he’s finally been able to attend a wedding,” she said absently to Percival. “Sure, we’ve shown him pictures and videos, but they don’t really convey the <em>experience</em>.”</p><p>“Newt was particularly excited when he learnt that New York had finally legalised equal marriage,” Percival agreed. “He was bitterly disappointed that Jacob couldn’t make the first one, although of course he understood the circumstances.” A blur of movement caught his eye. “Ah, looks like they’re ready for us,” he said, and crooked his arm towards Tina. “Shall we?”</p><p>Tina slid her arm through his and pretended to bat her eyelashes at him. “Why, Mr Graves, whatever will our husbands think?”</p><p>Percival snorted. “That we’re dang lucky to have them,” he admitted, and halted in the ballroom doorway. The decorators had finished and all but two had retreated out of another exit. The remaining two, who were apparently staying just in case their décor suffered some mishap, were stood at parade rest along the back wall.</p><p>Newt, Jacob and Queenie were at the front of the hall, in front of the white trellis arch that was woven with vines and roses. Jacob, by benefit of his advanced age and shaky equilibrium, was seated on a chair beside Newt. Queenie was hovering around him, obviously concerned that the excitement would be too much for him.</p><p>Percival was slightly concerned, as he slowly walked along the makeshift aisle towards Newt, that the excitement might be too much for <em>him</em>. He never got tired of the feeling that he was now able – now <em>allowed</em> – to claim Newt as his. Granted, they hadn’t had as much persecution in the magical world as the No-Majs had struggled with, but with the new legislation, they didn’t have to worry about shooting off <em>Oblivates</em> if they were accidentally too affectionate in front of No-Majs.</p><p>When he reached Newt, the other man smiled and held out a hand to him. Percival took it, feeling the slight shakiness to it. Or perhaps that was him with shaking hands. Either way, it didn’t matter. He smiled back at Newt, and they turned to face the Officiant.</p>
<hr/><p>Newt hummed softly into Percival’s ear as they slowly swayed together. He had his left hand curled up over Percival’s shoulder so that they could both see the glint of the ring that Percival had recently replaced on his finger. They had decided to change the designs of their rings every fifth wedding, which meant that Newt needed to decide what he wanted changing next, ready for their next wedding wherever marriage equality was newly granted.</p><p>He was aware of Percival’s thoughts on getting married each time it was legalised somewhere else, but he liked the symbolism of it; the ability to firmly state in public that he was allowed to claim this man, and to be claimed in return.</p><p>He was tempted to bite down on Percival’s neck, to make it a physical, <em>visible</em>, claim, but he rather thought that kind of action, coming from what appeared to be a man in his late seventies, might scare the nice No-Majs who’d decorated the ballroom and were currently trying to hide their soppy expressions when they gazed on the newly married couple.</p><p>“You’re thinking too loud,” Percival murmured, his voice fond and amused.</p><p>“Just thinking we can’t do anything that would scare the No-Majs,” Newt replied.</p><p>Percival leant back enough to see Newt’s face clearly, one eyebrow raised. “Were you <em>planning</em> on doing something that would scare the No-Majs?” he asked.</p><p>Newt smirked at him. “I was certainly planning on something that would <em>scandalise</em> the No-Majs,” he said. “Possibly wizarding folk, too.”</p><p>“I guess it’s a good thing we’re going, then!” Queenie’s voice said from behind them. Turning to face her, they found Queenie and Tina both gripping tightly to Jacob’s arms, ensuring he remained upright. The elderly man had clearly reached the end of whatever stamina Queenie had managed to give him; his eyes were beginning to droop closed. “Jacob’s ready for a nap,” Queenie continued. “Aren’t you, sweetie?”</p><p>“Huh?” Jacob’s eyes snapped open, and his head jerked as the sound of his name woke him up. It took several minutes, but his gaze finally focused on Percival and Newt. “H-hey, g-guys,” he managed, his voice weak and thready. “G-glad to se-see y-you.”</p><p>“It was <em>very</em> good to see you again, Jacob,” Newt said, reaching out to gently hug his friend for what was most likely going to be the last time. “We’re so glad you could make this one.”</p><p>“It was a pleasure, Mr Kowalski,” Percival added, patting Jacob on the shoulder. “You take care, now.”</p><p>“I’ll write,” promised Tina, as Jacob’s eyes began to droop closed again and his head began to nod. “It was a lovely wedding, though I wouldn’t expect anything less from you both by now.”</p><p>Percival smiled at her. “It was good to see you, Tina,” he said. “Give my regards to Abernathy.”</p><p>They both turned to watch the trio make their slow way out of the ballroom. The decorators had begun to dismantle the decorations at the far end of the room, obviously trying to give them all some privacy.</p><p>“So,” Percival said, eventually, once the Kowalskis and Tina had gone. “Mr Scamander-Graves. Shall we go somewhere that doesn’t have anyone to scandalise?”</p><p>Newt shivered at hearing that name yet again. He didn’t think he’d <em>ever</em> get enough of it. “Oh, <em>yes</em>,” he said, eagerly, wrapping his arms back around Percival’s shoulders.</p><p>And with a quiet <em>pop</em>, they Disapparated.</p>
