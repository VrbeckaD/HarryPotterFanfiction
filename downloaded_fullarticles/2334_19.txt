  <em> <strong>Sirius Black gets up and he goes to the lavatory and he does his business and he gels his hair he puts on his uniform and he sees Wormtail trying to get up and moony is studying he misses Prongs but he is Head boy this year as is Evans. He heads downstairs to head to the great Hall when he sees Snivellius and Reg talking he walks up to him and says " Watch your back Snivellius." I go into the hall and I sit at my spot and I eat some eggs and toast I look at the great table and I see Dumbledore and Minnie. I see my owl come with mail and I feed her some of my toast and she goes to the owlery. I open the letter when I see it is my Godfather Tom.</strong> </em>

  <em> <strong>I feel something is gonna happen at Hogwarts I don't know yet I know you trust the old coot but still be diligent boy I will try my best to care for you. Need anything just ask and I will get the ministry involved. </strong> </em>

  <em> <strong>I think I will stay diligent and thank god for the map. I see Evans come in blushing and Prongs coming in with God smacked look on his face a couple step behind her. I howl with laughter and James smacks me on my shoulder and says " Shut up Padfoot." I just nod and then he looks a my letter and he says " He will find something out for you fight Lils." She nods and I thank her I go to 7th years potions with Slughorn and I sit in my spot next to James. I wait and then comes in Snivellius he sits in his spot and I see Lily come in and sit next to Remus. </strong></em>
