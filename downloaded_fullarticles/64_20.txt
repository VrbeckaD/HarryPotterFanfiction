  <span class="StrongEmphasis">Harry Potter fic ideas you can totally steal</span>
</p>
<p class="Textbody">Welcome, one and all, to all the ideas I don't have time to write properly but still want to share! These are all ideas fire1 and I have come up with together, or ones I dreamed up myself (you'll notice those ones have way less plot, lol) but that we don't have time to write out into actual stories. Each chapter is going to deal with one story idea, and I'll make sure the titles are clear about what each idea is ("What if James had a brother?" or "What if Petunia was a witch?" or "Male Veela and Human Philosopher's Stones"). Sometimes they'll just be silly oneshot prompts, sometimes they'll be fully plotted out multi-chap treatments, most of the time they'll range in between. If someone leaves a really awesome addition to an idea in the comments I'll add that to the doc, with credit to the person. Let's get collaborative!</p>
<p class="Textbody">I'll update pretty randomly, but everything that goes up here is 100% I-swear-on-my-life completely stealable. You're free to use as much or as little of an idea as you like, with the caveat that you tell us if you end up writing and posting anything based on an idea here so that fire1 and I can read and leave gushy reviews :)</p>
<p class="Textbody">Fire1 is going to be posting these on her Ao3 account as well, and feel free to share these around to prompt communities or whatever! The world needs more fanfiction.</p>
<p class="Textbody">Wanna ask us something? I always answer PMs!</p>
<p class="Textbody">BLANKET DISCLAIMER FOR EVERYTHING IN THIS SERIES: I DON'T OWN THE CHARACTERS, SETTING, OR ANYTHING. I EVEN RELINQUISH CUSTODY OF MY OCS BECAUSE I WANT EVERYONE TO STEAL EVERYTHING AND WRITE THEIR OWN STUFF. THAT SAID, HAVE A BLAST! :D</p>
