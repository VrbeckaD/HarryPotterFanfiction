  <em>October 30, 1981</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus looked around the old building. He was a bit sick of having to meet in places like this, but the circumstances really didn’t allow for much else. He couldn’t impose himself on his father, especially now he was in the Order, and the list of locations which had not yet been compromised was getting shorter by the day. There was a spy in their ranks, that much was obvious, but he was buggered if he could be certain who it was.</p>
<p>The door creaked. Remus looked up, wand out, wary, but it was just Peter. Well, not <em>just</em> Peter. That was who he was supposed to be meeting in the first place. He looked around, casing the area just as Remus had when he’d arrived, then lowered his own wand.</p>
<p>“It’s clear?”</p>
<p>Remus nodded. “As far as I can figure out, anyway. I’m not as good at those detection spells as the others are.”</p>
<p>Peter shook his head. “I’ve told you before, you’re just as good as they are.” He took a step towards Remus and winked. “Actually, you’re a hell of a lot better …”</p>
<p>They wrapped their arms around each other, relishing the warmth as much as the tenderness. Winter had come early this year and the wind rushing through the cracks in the walls was icy cold. Peter pushed his hands underneath various layers until he found the skin underneath, and spent some time tracing the scars running up Remus’ side and back.</p>
<p>“That’s a new one,” he said after a moment with the confidence that comes from long term intimacy, his fingers finding a gash that ran from armpit to nipple. “Was it bad?”</p>
<p>They both knew what he was talking about. The full moon had been only a week prior and, without James and Sirius to distract him, he’d taken out his aggression on himself. The result was never pretty.</p>
<p>“I guess,” Remus said. “You know I don’t really remember them afterwards. Not without you lot to tell me.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I couldn’t be there,” Peter said. His mouth was so close to Remus’ collarbone he could barely hear the words. Not that he was complaining. These days, he took every embrace he could get. Especially from him.</p>
<p>They stood there for a while, holding each other, exchanging kisses and just enjoying the short time they could spend together. There was always so much to do, so many conflicting priorities, that it was almost impossible to steal a moment like this. It didn’t help that no one else knew about them; James was so caught up with Lily and Harry he had little time for anything else, and Sirius was always rushing off doing something for the Order that they’d never had a chance to tell him. Not that Remus expected Sirius would understand anyway – he and James had always been dismissive of Peter, had never recognised his true value and abilities. Ah well, they would one day, he thought. One day they would understand.</p>
<p>Once he’d warmed up a bit Remus found himself fumbling with Peter’s belt. “How much time do we have?”</p>
<p>Peter laughed but put a cautionary hand in the way. “Not enough. At least, not yet. Padfoot wants to drop by to pass on some info, so we’d better stay dressed until he goes.”</p>
<p>He swore under his breath. “Couldn’t it wait?”</p>
<p>“Apparently not.” Peter grabbed a hand and kissed it.</p>
<p>They sprang apart at the sound of the door creaking again. Peter had been right to wait – Sirius was there already. He looked relieved to see them.</p>
<p>“Ah, good, you’re both here. I’ve just been to see Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>Remus’ eyebrows lifted. “What does he want? More work?”</p>
<p>“Actually, not really. It’s James and Lily. He says the threat against them is getting tangible. Reckons it’s time.”</p>
<p>He heard Peter catch his breath. “For the Fidelius Charm?”</p>
<p>“Yep. He offered to be Secret Keeper himself, but I told him I’d do it. But it has to be soon, so I want to head over there this afternoon.”</p>
<p>Remus shook his head. “That <em>is</em> quick. I knew it was coming, but I hadn’t realised it would be this soon.” He said the words warily, unsure of how much to show. He had an inkling Sirius might be the spy, and if that was the case he didn’t want to give too much away. But if he was the spy, then the Fidelius Charm made things a little too easy for him – only he would be able to share James and Lily’s location with the Death Eaters. He hoped against hope the Potters would be safe.</p>
<p>Sirius was visibly upset, which could have meant anything. “I can’t believe it’s come to this. But apparently there’s no other way. Voldemort’s got this sick fixation on them.” He paused. “Uh, Moony, would you mind leaving us for a tick? There’s something I want to talk to Pete about.”</p>
<p>He caught Peter’s eye, finding there the promise of a meeting later on if time permitted, and pulled his coat tight around himself. “Sure. I’ve got to head off anyway. See Dad before I need to go on the next job. You know.”</p>
<p>The other two nodded, Sirius looking agitated, Peter torn. It was a wrench walking away.</p>
<p>“See you later, then. Best of luck, both of you.”</p>
<p>He heard Sirius’ groan as he closed the door. “Thanks, mate. We’ll need it.”</p>
