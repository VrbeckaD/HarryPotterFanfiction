    <p>Heloise: Class settle down.<br/>
They all become silent.<br/>
Heloise: Thank you. Today we are starting a project that will last for the rest of the year. The practical section of your exam will be what you have learned in this just over a term. Be warned this is not an easy project. This project is the reason why only select year groups are chosen to take this class. The last year group that took this exam all failed and the one before that. In fact no one has passed since 1977.<br/>
Hermione shoots her hand in the air.<br/>
Heloise: Yes Hermione?<br/>
Hermione: How did they pass?<br/>
Heloise: I can't tell you that.<br/>
Everyone groans.<br/>
Hermione: Who were they?<br/>
Heloise: That, however, I can tell you. Four people passed that year; myself, Miranda Smith, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.<br/>
Harry smirks.<br/>
Heloise: And you can wipe the smirk off your face, Harry. Your parents have been told not to tell you how they passed.<br/>
Harry: *muttering* Shit.<br/>
Heloise: Right everyone go stand at the back of the class so I can re-arrange your seating so you are sat with your partners.<br/>
Everyone moves to the back of the class.<br/>
Heloise: On the front left desk I want Pansy and Hermione.<br/>
Hermione sits down.<br/>
Pansy: Do I have to?<br/>
Heloise: Yes. Arse on chair.<br/>
She sits down.<br/>
Heloise: Front middle Harry and Draco.<br/>
They sit without any complaints.<br/>
Heloise: Front right Ron and Theo.<br/>
Ron: No. Not happening.<br/>
Heloise: It is happening or I will go get your head of house.<br/>
Ron: I refuse to work with Nott for the rest of the year.<br/>
Heloise: Harry will you go get your father?<br/>
Harry: Of course.<br/>
He gets up and walks to the DADA classroom. He knocks on the door.<br/>
Remus: Come in.<br/>
Harry enters.<br/>
Remus: Hello Harry.<br/>
Harry: Hi Dad. Professor Delacroix is having some problems with a student refusing to sit with their partner.<br/>
Remus: Right. Everyone read the chapter on werewolves in the textbook. Page 394.<br/>
He goes into the corridor with Harry and they start walking to Power enhancing 101.<br/>
Remus: Who's pitched a fit?<br/>
Harry: Ron.<br/>
Remus: Who's his partner?<br/>
Harry: Theo Nott, not even a bad bloke, he could have got someone a lot worse.<br/>
Remus: Who did you get?<br/>
Harry: Dray.<br/>
Remus: You'll probably pass.<br/>
Harry: I already have an idea for what we can do.<br/>
Remus: And how did you get this theory?<br/>
Harry: Aunt Heloise told us who the last people were that passed the exam and I got my idea from that.<br/>
Remus: I know where you're coming from with that.</p>
