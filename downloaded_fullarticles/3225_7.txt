          <div class="userstuff"><p>A snake slithered into our garden of weeds </p>
<p>Visitor to our house<br/>Dressed in black<br/>Heavy boots crushing the baby birds bones of our coupling</p>
<p>You invited him in<br/>Invited him to stay</p>
<p>He wrapped his slimy fingers around your neck<br/>Crawled inside your skin</p>
<p>He pressed his cold lips upon my cheek<br/>Turned our marriage bed to rotted roses</p>
<p>He was a smooth talking man<br/>Made promises <br/>Snake oil cures<br/>For a fruitless union</p>
<p>Soon his words became yours <br/>Black ink on pale skin<br/>Bruises on soft cheeks</p>
<p>My body bloomed purple <br/>You took the sinewy mass in my ribcage and turned it to dust<br/>You were never good at transfiguration</p>
<p>But O did you try to become this man<br/>Your shadow was one with the serpentine stranger<br/>I began to fear the bumps in the night</p>
<p>The day they hauled you off to Azkaban<br/>I thought I could breathe</p>
<p>But your shadows haunted the halls<br/>And the devilish man in black remained<br/>Like a blood stain on a white dress</p>
<p>I thought your failures could work like magic<br/>Drive him from our home<br/>But he remained</p>
<p>Only to sink is teeth into our son<br/>The stars in the sky seem to go out<br/>The longer the stranger stayed</p>
<p>I hope you're proud of the ink on your childâ€™s body<br/>And the blood spilled in your walls</p>
<p>Because your master will fall<br/>And I will be the one to take him down</p></div>
