  <em>Too many years of battle scars and now<br/>
We’re broken</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>And all the words you said<br/>
Been hanging over my head for time</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>And all of the lines we’ve crossed</em><br/>
<em>Have finally burst us open</em><br/>
<em> As a thousand tiny paper cuts of life </em></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p>Sharp nails bite into the skin carelessly as clothes are forcefully ripped from the body. They are never gentle, they never learned to be, they never <em>needed</em> to be.</p><p>They both like it like that.</p><p>That is what they tell themselves when the harsh mouth mercilessly bites down on the shoulder. That is what they tell themselves when they make each other scream. That is what they tell themselves when the breathless groan accentuates the breach between pleasure and pain.</p><p>They both like it like that.</p><p>But wouldn’t they like a gentle press of lips against their skin as well? Wouldn’t they like a soft touch, a gentle sweep of fingers across the temple, a soft languid movement of bodies, a tender gasp of wonder against the ear instead of a growl of want?</p><p>They would like it like that.</p><p>Wishful thinking.</p><p>The cutting words have left too many forcibly sewn edges on the surface of their souls. The stains of underhanded betrayal have paved their way too deep into the tissue of their trust. The scars of their heart stand out in testament to the irreparable brokenness of their love.</p><p>They could fabricate soft touches, gentle lips, and languid thrusts. They could put on a show for the wistful desires waiting for a happy ending in the front row.</p><p>But a broken love cannot neglect its scars and still be true. A broken love cannot veil its pain and still be honest.</p><p>Even a broken love deserves its show.</p><p>And the yearning audience will have to learn to <em>like it like that too</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
