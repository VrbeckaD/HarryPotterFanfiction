<br/>
Hail the once proud land we once called Ivalice. A home that use to be full of splendor and beauty. Where numerous beings roamed and flourished in the many common wealth’s that filled her bounty. With such prosperous countries did war come knocking on everyone’s door for the ever-dwindling resources. But do not fear, salvation soon washed over the masses when a young king, blessed by the very gods, stepped forth onto the center stage to bring peace to the lands. A peace that was brought forth with a mighty sword in one hand, a luminescent crystal shard of grand power in the other, did he unite these nations under his banner. Thus, cementing this young man in pages memorial as the Dynast-King forever. Sadly, peace did not last long for our home. The passing centuries let small provinces form into great countries and kingdoms. With such expansive places did the ugly head of war rose once more for the same piety reasons that were fought over before. Except honor, pride and shame now played a part in the unnecessary scrobble.<br/>
<br/>
In this war did these proud people had lost their homes and lives only to lose their countries soon after. Of course, the passion of the people was set ablaze once more for their country to form rebel groups. All to strike back at those who would dare to occupy their homeland. This group of misfits were they able to gather the power they needed and were able to defeat the conquer in a splendid final battle with a multitude of allies. Claiming what was theirs originally upon the death of the conqueror was truly sealed. After this epoch in our memories did trouble wormed its way back into the life of Ivalice. This time it will be a journey to our final judgment. A judgement that brought more pain for people in this never-ending cycle. In the historical pages of memorial did these struggles faded away with the familiar creatures we all coexist our lives around. Therefore, it brings me such pain that our home, and its rich culture, was later lost to our descendants in a fleeting minute.<br/>
<br/>
To forget one’s own history is unforgivable but also sadly understandable. For you see a grand number of books and devices that held the records of our past were lost to our fellow countrymen during the countless battles. Luckily some murmurs of the previous ages were saved thanks to those devoted enough with the foresight to copy the multitude of literature. To only hide them away from those who wish to wipe away who we were.<br/>
<br/>
So, listen oh young and proud child destined for greatness and chosen by the very gods from up above. Born from a bloodline of heroes who long ago left this world with wary hearts but they were proud of what they were able to accomplish in their lives. For they, like you, are a child of justice and a beautiful kingdom that long ago fallen with the royal bloodline. But fear not the line does not die away in history pages’ young child. For you, elder born, hold the bloodline that can reunite a kingdom and bring forth the old ways of long ago. The ways and traditions that we have forgotten in the tomes of history that now hold dust. So, blow away the dust of days long gone and bring forth what had been lost.<br/>
<br/>
Now rise my child for you are now the Dynast-King of legend, our new king of Dalmasca and Ivalice. So, make us proud oh son of Ivalice and keeper of our gods. For both the many worlds are look upon you in hope. No more so than the gods who brought forth the creatures of the land and our world.<br/>

“Come on Lily! We’re going to be late if you don’t hurry up!” a dark-haired man yelled at the bottom of the stairs before walking back into the living room to wait. Hurried footsteps made their way down the stairs. These footsteps belong to a beautiful red-haired woman with emerald eyes wearing a tight fitting yet slender black dress. She walked into the living room situated next to the stairs. Lily spotted the man sitting on the couch they had gotten a year before this mess had started. Going over to her beloved husband James did she smack him hard against the head.<br/>
<br/>
“Ouch! What was that for?!” asked the scowling man as he looked at his stunning wife. The women only gave the man a dark smile before saying, “For rushing me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Well…If it didn’t take you so long to get ready then I would not have to rush you. You and I both know how long we waited for this night. To be able to get out of the house for once,” the black-haired man stated as he got off the couch. Turning around to face her before grabbing his wife hands. Tugging her forward and making her sin around the couch to close the short distance between them until she was firmly placed firmly against him. Wrapping his arms tightly against her slender waist. She couldn’t help but goggle when she those arms squeeze her. Making sure their bodies was tightly pressed against one another.<br/>
<br/>
“I know, I know,” Lily spoke as she reached behind herself to away his hands. Pulling out of his embrace to be free of her husband was she able to fully speak again, “This is something the both of us needed for a long time. Since we have been cooped up in this house for months. Hiding away from the world like hermits in order all of us can be safe.”<br/>
<br/>
She proceeded to straighten out the upper part of her dress before turning her attention back to her husband. Lily placed her hands-on James wrinkled tuxedo to tug and pull on it to try to make it presentable for the gathering. Escaping the paranoid thoughts that were working their way to the minds of Lily and James. The Potter couple just hoped this one night would not blow up in their faces to ruin all the efforts to protect their children. An undertaking which lasted months due to all the protections and planning, so their one-year old twins are safe from the vicious man after them. All of this is because of a prophecy preceding the birth of Harry and Tristan. One telling of a child will be born to stop the war the ‘<em>lord</em>’ had started years ago by his so called ‘<em>equal</em>’. The very reason the small remained locked away in their house known as Godric Hollow.<br/>
<br/>
They were not the only family in hiding because of the prophecy and the wicked man. The Longbottom family, along with their own son born around the same time, hid amongst one of their own mansions in an unknown location. It was comforting on some level to know they were not alone in their suffering. Even though a small piece of Lily heart had sent a prayer to the heavens above that the child belonging to the Longbottom’s was the chosen one. Just to have the peace she wanted with her boys for the rest of her life. At least on this night she will know some semblance of peace at the party with James. Even though she did find it kind of strange that the Ministry was holding a ball during all the fighting and the multitude of skirmishes and battles. Maybe this was a way to lift the spirits of their supporters while milking them for the much-needed funds. That or the ministry was ready to dig head in the sand.<br/>
<br/>
Lily knew full and well the chance of that wish coming true was highly unlikely since the Longbottom’s are under the same kind of safe guards as they are. Using the Fidelius Charm to keep them hidden from the outside world. Each family had their own secret keeper to keep the knowledge of where they are hidden from any outside intruders. Frank and Alice wouldn’t tell them who their secret keeper was. Not surprising since they kept theirs a hidden as well. Plus, each side had only a limited number of people who they trusted to keep them safe from the world. Such an example of this would be Sirius Black but it was too dangerous for him to be one. This due to the fact it was well know that Sirius is a close friend to both Potters and an Auror to boot. They could have gone to their other close friend, Remus Lupin, but he was in the same boat as Sirius. There was also the fact Remus is a werewolf and they could not rely on him something happened around the time of his transformation when a full moon is coming. Leading them to their last and only choice in the matter, convincing Peter Pettigrew, the last member of their motley crew, to be the one to keep their secrets. It really worked out for the best and everyone that knew about this had agreed. Many the know the group seen Peter as a weak fool and was easily written off when it came down to it. Thus, the ideal candidate to keep the location of the house classified. Giving Lily and James safe enough feeling to leave since he would be the one to watch the twins tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Even with Lily mind set at ease; they’re was this sensation she couldn’t shake off about this little soiree still clung to her. Causing embarrassment to creep within her for she felt somewhat foolish to go to the Ministry of Magick during such a time of unrest for a stupid party. But here she was with James in their finest clothes.<br/>
<br/>
If James felt the same way as she did then he did not show it. Lily never felt so conflicted about the situation as she straightened out James suit. She stepped back and smiled at him despite the turmoil raging within her. Instincts of wanting to stay with the children fought with the desire to escape the confining house. Her worries slightly weaned when she saw the comforting smile of her husband.<br/>
<br/>
A sudden whooshing sound near the couple caught their attention. Facing the fireplace, James and Lily saw a plum of green and grey smoke bellowed out of it. Someone’s feet stuck out of the magickal induced smoke. These feet started to come out of the mass until a body fully appeared. It was Peter who came forth from it in a coughing fit. Lily looked upon him with concern to the point she had to ask, “Are you alright Peter?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah…*cough*…I’m fine…*cough*…Now where are the…*cough*…little monsters…,” Peter answered through his fit before it finally settled down. This made her smile to know he was alright. Lily straightened out the rest of her dress by pulling it down some, “The twins are upstairs asleep, so you should have an easy time tonight. Sorry for Remus, he couldn’t be here to help you tonight.”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s alright. I know Remus had an important mission tonight. Plus, it’s fun to watch Tristan and Harold,” Peter stated happily as he dusted off the soot from the chimney, “There also the fact you guys really need this chance to be free from here.”<br/>
<br/>
It held a list of what to do with the children, where certain items are at and what to do in an emergency written on it. Giving him the list reminded Lily of the one she had made a few months back. A list of what she wanted to petition and work on in the magickal world. One of these projects of hers is finding a newer form of transportation. There must be something better for the common person other than a chimney or some god-forsaken, magickally created pin prick like tube when someone uses apparition.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, Lily knew she might not survive the war to do such a thing. If she does, the female Potter know she will work her hardest to invent this new mode of transportation. She shook her head of such thoughts when she suddenly felt James wrap his arm around her waist when he appeared on her left. Giving Peter a grin before saying, “Have fun Peter and thank you for babysitting. We will be back soon.”<br/>
<br/>
James let go of his wife soon after as he said his own goodbyes. He walked into the fireplace and Lily followed. Grabbing some of the Floo Powder along the way from a small bowl on the mantel. Yelling out the full name of the ministry did they disappear as soon as the powder hit the ground when it was tossed. Leaving the place in a flash of green flames and a cloud of grey smoke. Now lost in the expansive floo network.<br/>
<br/>
Once the last of the emerald flames and smoke dissipated from the furnace did a smile formed on his face. He took the sleeve on his left arm to roll it up until a tattoo of a cracked skull being wrapped by a snake was fully revealed on the inner part of his forearm. This is a mark imbued with dark magick given to the followers of his master. A master Peter is willing to follow due to his fear, hatred and jealousy he held deeply in his heart for years against his so-called friends. Peter snorted at the thought of them being his ‘<em>friends</em>’ as he reached into the right side of his brown jacket to pull out a chainless, gold pocket watch, that is the size of the bottom of a beer bottle bottom and a few coins thick, from a pouch sown into the lining of it. The watch is the very thing keeping the charm grounded to the house and land. This itsy-bitsy item is the only thing protecting the building from intruders that lurk in the outside world. While Peter had shown the address to his master; the man still wanted the shield taken down in case there were additional spells, protections, and cursed were placed on it. Even though Peter had assured home that such protections, or any other form of magick, was not placed on the house since it was bought shortly before the wat had escalated to a new level. Making it near impossible to put any powerful spells or curses to safe guard the location in that short amount of time. At least not without drawing the unwanted attention of neighbors in the small suburban area or that of any potential spies. But Peter mast did not want to take the chances the Potters had placed additional defenses during a time prying eyes could not see them.<br/>
<br/>
Not that it mattered since it will be all over soon enough. Peter flipped open the watch with his thumb to view a beautifully etched face of the watch. Numbers delicately painted on as brass arms showed the current time to him. Pettigrew smiled as he will remember the time, eight-forty-two pm, that this war will change for the better for them. He winded the watch until he heard an audible but soft click come from inside it.  The watch slowed to a stop then another click was heard. The magick inside relaxed from the inner workings to show the charms linked to it are dissipating. He watches in fascination as the watch was eaten by the magick. Braking, crunching and clicking could be heard as it collapsed on itself until it disappeared. Once gone did the house began to shake some before it stopped. As if a small earthquake had happened but not violently enough for anything to break or fall. It was merely the magick releasing into the world although it might be slowly. This is evident by a translucent orange dome appearing outside the home if one should look outside it before it started to breakdown from the top. Showering magick down on the house as if was glitter before it vanishes. Soon the dome itself was gone along with the protections that came with it.<br/>
<br/>
Reaching into his worn-out pocket of his brown jacket did Peter pulled out his wand. Peter pressed it against the mark and sent some of his magick through the wooden item. It causes the tattoo to glow a dull red before it resided back to its black coloring. Joy filled his heart that he was able to send out the signal. Such feeling was cut short when the sound of several pops garnered his attention. Fear replaced the joy he had as Peter raced over to the front door in the foyer. A tall man in silken robes stood in the doorway upon yanking the door open. Several men stood in the shadows of the yard case they were needed by their lord. This man before the rat is the very person the whole magickal community is deathly afraid of, that Peter betrayed his friends to, who is also known as Voldemort. The sniveling rat started to bow down to the floor to kiss his mast robes, but the dark wizard just moved swiftly pass him. Striding up the very stairs the Potter couple had lingered near earlier.<br/>
<br/>
The lord of darkness elegantly walked down the hallway painted a light peach color and flooring made of dark hardwood. He had memorized the layout of the building when his cowardly servant mapped the place out. Voldemort finally reached the toddlers room when he smelt the faint scent of baby wafted out the closed door. This caused the maniacal man to smile deviously before opening the door. The scent of babies and the sight of the crib on the far side of the powder blue room full of various toys was the first thing to catch his attention upon opening the door. He slowly stepped into the room towards the bed that’s placed into the corner of the room. Unlike what Lily had stated earlier, both twins lay in the crib wide awake. Wiggling happily as they stared cursorily at the strange man standing before their crib. The both were looking back at him with pure innocence shinning in their eyes. He could not believe that one of these brats in front of him had the ability to kill him someday. That very thought made him scowl in displeasure. Looking at the children a little closer in the dark room did he notice that despite being twins they looked completely different from one another. One of the boys has brownish red hair and light-colored hazel eyes. While hair black as midnight sky with luminescent emerald eyes adorn the other boy. Voldemort broke his attention on their looks for he did not know why he was memorizing their faces to begin with. As to why he was paying attention to the details of the boys he did not know. They were going to die anyway so why should he care. Maybe it’s because they were the youngest being he killed so far, and he wanted to remember.<br/>
<br/>
“Now which one you little brats shall die first?” Voldemort inquired to himself as he guided his wand high into the air for he finally made his decision who shall die first. He wordlessly went through the incantation and movement before he sent the killing curse to the hazel eyed boy. A burst of acid green traveled the shaft of the wooden item to form an orb of the same color. It shot out from the piece of wood with a green tail followed it. The neon orb went to the youngest of the two until something strange happened. The magick’s held within the black-haired child felt the unfamiliar one and the danger that came with it. This in turn called forth the mana held in the area to defend him and his brother.<br/>
<br/>
The call for such great amount of mana drained from the power that saturated the area, devices within the house, and the amount that was release when the protection on the house was broken. This action had created a new form of magick that was never seen by those populating the magickal communities.<br/>
<br/>
A thick mist of mana, one only the sensitive or those who grew up around it could detect, rolled into the children room. Such qualities of viewing such mist was not lost on the wicked man. He grew accustomed to mana, at least to a certain degree, that Voldemort could see some visage of this power. A spotting of cloud that looked like a floating rainbow here or there did not deter him from his deeds. It was not uncommon for magickal families to do something special in their babies’ room to have unique flair to them. Ignoring this mist gave it the chance to reach out to the children undeterred in the last minute to create a shield around the twins. The spell casted by the snake his the translucent, rainbow colored shield to create a massive backlash of gold and green. The light blinded Voldemort as his spell rebounded back to him in a much stronger form. The dark master let out a shrill scream of pain when it hit him. It was burning him alive until that point the shrills stopped and nothing more than ash and clothes was left behind when the light finally faded away. The light also revealed the room was torn apart from the whirlwind of magick as a child cried. The child that summoned this quickly slipped into a magickal induced sleep from channeling such foreign entities.<br/>
<br/>
This was not the end of their ordeal. Another shrill echoed through the room as a shadow, a wraith, rose from the ashes of its original body. The apparition gazed at the children, letting out a wail of anger and anguish at them, then flew out a window above them that busted out from the intense backlash. The ruckus did not go unnoticed by those who in and outside the house. Though only pair of feet raced up the stairs and down the hall. Ultimately sliding to a stop before the broken, open, and unhinged door belonging to the nursery. The chubby rat was of course the one who had come to see what had happened. The other Death-eaters had run away once they saw the light escaping the children room. Then heard the shrills of their master come from the house after something caused the window to bust. Escaping either by the way they appeared or by using a portkey that lead to some unknown destination.<br/>
<br/>
He investigated the room in shock as he sees remnants of his master on the floor. Peter knew he was not as smart as Remus or Lily, but it doesn’t take much to figure out his master was defeated. So, in a bout of gutlessness that was expected from him did the rat flee back down the path he came from. Hoping to find haven in the living room. Panic had set in the coward as he paced haphazardly in his safe zone. Utterly caught up in the few minutes before Lily and James returned home. Knowing they had received indication that the barrier had been taken down. A squadron of Aurors with their wands pointed at him did not sound to pleasing to Pettigrew. Deep into his distraught state, Peter took no notice of the unsettling feeling that was working its way in his gut. For you see, from the open of the infant’s room did the mist seep into every nook and cranky of second floor before immersing itself into the first floor. Coating the area with a light fog of magick as it grew thicker. It was all ill timing for the fat bastard as he finally thought of a way to settle his problems in one fell swoop. Such a brilliant idea that it made his heart fill with glee and the trepidation was now gone. Normally the Death-Eaters that waited outside would have been a hitch in his plan, but he heard them leave earlier. This made his plan of making it look like he ‘<em>had died</em>’ with the twins an easy one with no witnesses here. The truth of the matter is that he would have escaped while the house bathed in a sea of flames with Harold and Tristan in it. Yes, a fire would do nicely for this situation. After all, it has been known that a sudden release of stored magick can go wild and do bazaar things once it has been released suddenly from the thing it tied to.  As soon as the thoughts of setting the house on fire crossed his mind did Peter stat to hear a dull ticking sound coming from behind the couch he was in front of. The Pettigrew turns to where the sand was coming from to find something horrifying. Located in the entryway the divided the foyer and living room to find an elongated, fat, twister of red that is pointed on bother ends that floated in the air. Peter tried to put some distance away from the thing by slowly backing away until he tripped over the edge of the coffee table. Causing the man to land on ass against the hard wood floor. The twister broke apart like ribbon as it continues to twist and turn before it vanished back into the mist. The weird cocoon revealed a rotund, round, red floating object constructing itself right in front him. It truly frightens Peter to see the inner workings of gears moving, oil saturating the insides as gobs of it started to drip out of it, and jagged pieces of red shell gathered together to form some sort of textured body as a smiling, maniacal face was in placed. Blank eyes of white stared at the rat as more seeped onto the floor through the few cracks in its shell that stayed. Creating an even larger puddle to decorate the floor.<br/>
<br/>
The everlasting grin of the creature finally took its toll on the man as the sound of hissing drew his attention from it. Looking around frantically for sound did he realize it was coming from inside the creature itself. It dawned on him that this beast was in fact a bomb came quickly to the rat. Peter scrambled to his feet and rushed out, passing by the creature, to the freedom of the outside world. This caused the Bomb to let out a high0pitched screech as it brought forth the fire his wish bringer had desired for. The wick on top of the head of the Bomb burst into a powerful all-consuming flame of various oranges, yellows and reds. Letting fire go wild and ignite the oil oozing from its cracks. Trailing down until it reached the thick puddle underneath it. The inferno burned hot and fierce as it engulfed the front of the house soon after.<br/>
<br/>
Much like the luck and time for Peter when he ran out into the yard. For as soon as he stepped foot into the grass did the Potter couple appear with a resounding pop. Followed by several dozen or more pops that belong to a few teams of Aurors. A few familiar faces he recognized amongst the crowd as they populated the suburban street. Peter ran to the nearest one, an unfamiliar Auror, in a haste and manic stated was he able to confess, “I did it! I lead milord here and now’s he is gone! Thanks to those bloody brats still I the house and the monster that is with them!”<br/>
<br/>
Peter really believed that the monster that appeared before him was a spirit to get him for his jealous, sinful ways as he worked for Voldemort. A couple of Aurors took the man away to a temporary cell in the Ministry of Magic. A few of the Aurors took the crazed man away to one of the cells held deep within the Ministry. The rest either stayed outside to battle the flames or rushed inside with the Potters and Dumbledore to rescue the boys. Pieces of burnt wood were scattered all over the floor. Other sections of the house were about to fall to leave giant holes and dangerous debris. They pressed on and fought the flames until they reached the children room. A beam had fallen to block their way into the very room. James kicked down the beam to let them view a destroyed place. Pieces of wood of various sizes surrounded the crib. They could hear one of their boys wailing loudly amongst the roaring flames. Dumbledore stood by the door as the parents raced into the room to rescue the small ones. In their haste, they missed the translucent, round, creature in the corner whose flame seem to feed off the magick that still saturated the area. The creature of flames watched the both each take a child and retreat from the nursery. Glancing at the white bearded man to see him take one last look in the room before focusing on his own health. Following the couple out at the house with a look of worry. Dumbledore had seen the darken pile of ash next to the rib. He knew what that meant. The words Peter had spoken earlier now had more merit on some part. One of these children had defeated their worst enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Once outside again did Lily and James collapse to their knees when they were far enough from the burning building. Hugging the boys tightly against their chest. Happy everyone was safe again after this night. Dumbledore quickly came over to them to see them alright but the first thing he got out of them is Lily asking him a question when they lifted their heads, “Why would he do this us Professor?”<br/>
<br/>
“I really do not know why Peter would do such a thing,” Dumbledore stated sadly at the two, “Although the real question tonight should be: Are the boys harmed in any way?”<br/>
<br/>
“I noticed a scar on Tristan when I hugged him. Right on should here,” James rolled the boy over to the glow of the fire to show a bleeding scare stretching from his should to the middle of his chest, “There is also the fact I can feel faint magick pulsing from it. Other than that, he is perfectly fine.”<br/>
<br/>
If only they knew that the strange magick coming from the scar played its part in another way. In fact, it was a branch of healing magick that reached out from the mist to help seal up most of the wound after a piece of wood had landed on his shoulder. Some of this power absorbed into the wound in the process.<br/>
<br/>
“Harold appears to be fine,” Lily stated never noticing the scar underneath several strands of hair or the faint magick draining away from him. The headmaster nodded, glad that neither of the boys was not harmed in this potentially tragic event.<br/>
<br/>
“What of Voldemort, Albus?” asked the tired out red head with hope in her eyes. Albus looked sorrowfully at the couple. The flames diming down to an ember glow to show the broken and burnt holes of the house. Some collapsing into other parts to feed the last vestige of flames that still existed. It illuminated the agony of the problem on the parent faces. But to see such a face on a fictious man such as Albus was surreal to James and Lily. It did not change the outcome of everything when this event was truly over.<br/>
<br/>
“For now, he is defeated,” happiness filled the Potters up until Dumbledore continued to speak, “But I believe such a wayward wizard is still alive.”<br/>
<br/>
“What do you mean?” asked one of the Potters, fearing that they could be attacked again by the dark lord. They knew Death-Eaters will come after them for revenge, dead lord or not.<br/>
<br/>
“I fear he may still live in some form or fashion. I felt the presents of dark magic in the room. He may not have a physical form for now, but he still lives,” Albus stated to the parents in front of him. Worried looks shown on the parents faces asking each other the silent question that plagued each other minds.<br/>
<br/>
“We should keep this to ourselves and say he is dead for now. We don’t want the public panicking and fearing a potential doom for who knows how long. It will be better if we let our world rebuild itself,” the white-haired man stated to them. James and Lily couldn’t help but agree to that. Even though one of them had an issue with the fake peace they were giving to the world. But the much-needed safety, joy, peace and happiness are what the masses wanted so badly. Lily one issue with it is when it all comes crashing down on everyone head.<br/>
<br/>
“What about our boys and the prophecy?” inquired Lily as she looked down at her black-haired boy who was fast asleep. James looked at the crying boy in his arms with worry. Worry of what he had to face in the future. A world where he could no longer be a child, but a weapon trained to kill off Voldemort for good.<br/>
<br/>
“It has been proven to us that Tristan is the one the prophecy has spoken of. Having survived the night with that dagger shaped scar on his body. This champion of ours shall be trained when he is old enough to fend off all the evil forces soon,” Dumbledore stated to them not liking the ever-depressing feeling in this yard. The old man set his gaze in the direction of the Aurors were currently putting out the last of the flames in the house. Leaving behind brief memories in ashes and dust of a past they wish to forget in the rising smoke of the fire.<br/>
<br/>
“Come now both of you. It’s time to go get checked upon in St. Mungo’s,” affirmed Dumbledore as he grasps the shoulders of both Potters and used apparition to leave the yard. If he stayed a little longer he would have seen a small amount dense mist appear with a floating red fiend with a large grin. But as fast it shown itself the creature disappeared with the mist it came in. With these changes set forth this night, the path of destiny had been diverted to a new direction.<br/>

<strong>Intelligence Report:</strong> A half-blood wizard and lifelong friend to James Potter and Sirius Black. He attended the same school as his friends before joining the war himself. At a young age he was infected by the lycanthropy by someone who wanted revenge against his parents. Even with this disadvantage, he was still able to attend Hogwarts when special accommodations were made to allow him in. When offer to become a godfather to the twins he declined. Much to his regret and dismay. It was only because of his lycanthropy that he refused such an honor. Feeling if should something happen to the Potters then he would not be able to properly take of children during the time a full moon is around.</p><p><strong>Peter Pettigrew</strong><br/>

<strong>Intelligence Report:</strong> This man is…unnatural. We, the scouts, have seen the way this man walks amongst these naive people. I know it’s unusual to give our brief reports about people in such a way, but…Dumbledore gives off a vibe worse than that Voldemort character. Something is terribly wrong with him and I fear what would happen to us if we stay too long. It’s a miracle we were able to retrieve this much on him to begin with. I believe he the first one to ever suspect he was being watched by someone other than the gods. We must go! Any reports and information gathering will have to delayed until further notice.<br/>
</p><p><strong>Locations:</strong><br/>
<br/>
Godric Hollow (<em>House</em>): A two-story house located in a muggle Cal-de-sac. The house is owned by James and Lily Potter for about two years. It was bought during war-time as a location to hide themselves and their twin sons. Such protection lasted for a little over a year before being betrayed by a close friend. Now the hose lays in ruins of ash and burnt wood. Never allowing them to return to the haunting event again. <strong>Fact:</strong> The house is named after a famous magical community of witches and wizards. The place they wanted to go to in the beginning but was convinced otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dalmasca</strong> (<em>Nation</em>): A small desert kingdom that use to be located between two larger nations. It housed the royal city of Rabanastre who the descendants of the Dynast King governed from.

<br/>
<strong>Bhujerba</strong> (<em>Sky City/City State</em>): Located above the Naldon Seas on the sky continent of Dorstonis. It’s a city that thrives on the export of potent mineral known as magicite that come from the many mines that dot the area.

<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Apperition </strong>(<em>Transportation</em>): A magical method of transportation. To travel to another location, the user must focus on a desired location then they will disappear from where they were to instantly reappear in a new location after focus.

<strong>Information:</strong> A weapon used to battle mages in the past then they were left to grow wild after disuse or when better weapons were made. These creatures are known to react swiftly when the presence of magick is around them. This reaction triggers explosive energies contained within. Often leading to an explosion of a physical nature, making it greatly effective against targets who heavily rely upon magickal protection. Causing mage to hesitantly work their mand around Bomb and their ilk. There have been incidents when Bombs haven’t reacted violently to when magick is casted. It because these creatures were one of the few who was raised around spell casters and magick.</p>
