    <p>Remus Lupin skillfully navigated the familiar streets of London on the way to his favourite café; Lavender Crème.<br/>The narrow stone sidewalks were heavily crowded with people milling about. Many shops were packed full of people bustling around doing weekend shopping. It was very easy for one to get caught up in the tidal waves of bodies passing by, but after so many years, Remus had grown used to it.<br/>After checking his phone for the time; 13:08pm, Remus put it back in his book bag and hefted the strap higher up onto his shoulder.</p>
<p>A few more minutes of walking passed before Remus noticed a familiar head of long, black hair; hunched over a phone as the owner attached to it shuffled through the crowd.<br/>Remus had not seen Dorcas Meadowes in nearly two months. So when he shouldered past people to get to her, after shouting "Hey stranger!" by way of greeting, he did not realize that maybe, just maybe, it was not a good idea to wrap his arms around this person.</p>
<p>His embrace was met by the other persons' body tensing and flinching backwards. Odd, Remus thought as he pulled back to examine what might be the problem. The sight he was met with was not what he had anticipated. For one, he expected to see a face of pain or discomfort, not an expression of amused shock. Secondly, he was very surprised to see that this person had facial hair. Last of all, he didn't expect to be incredibly attracted to the man standing at arms length.<br/>The handsome stranger chuckled at the expression of complete and utter horror that had fallen across Remus' face.</p>
<p>"I assume I'm not the person you thought I was?" The stranger said after a moment.<br/>"I- Erm- No, I'm afraid not. Sorry." Remus spluttered out intelligently.<br/>The stranger smirked at Remus' awkward response. "No need to apologize," he smirked "My name is Sirius, by the way, Sirius Black." The man- Sirius- extended his hand to Remus as he introduced himself. Remus took the hand offered and shook it a bit flimsily whilst he introduced himself. "Remus Lupin," was all he managed to get out.<br/>Did you really have to embarrass yourself with the most beautiful person in the vicinity? Remus thought as Sirius withdrew his own hand.</p>
<p>"Well, Remus Lupin," Sirius said Remus' name in an almost mocking way, but, it was strangely endearing. "I have one question for you,"<br/>Sirius must have seen the expression of panic that quickly took over Remus features because; he smirked. And it should have been irritating to Remus that Sirius was amused by his internal struggle but no. He couldn't be annoyed when that smirk was so sexy.<br/>After Remus realized he hadn't responded to Sirius words in any other way than  looking fearful, he nodded his head in encouragement for Sirius to continue.<br/>"Do you have a brother called Romulus?" Sirius asked cheekily.</p>
<p>All the tension left Remus' body and was instantly replaced by annoyance.<br/>"Are you serious?" Remus regretted the sentence immediately after vocalizing it.<br/>"In every sense of the word," Sirius grinned. "No, but really, do you?"<br/>"No, I don't. As you can tell, my parents weren't the best with names." Remus answered in mock disdain.<br/>"Yeah, I can see that, Werewolf McWerewolf." Sirius quipped.<br/>"You're one to talk, Dog Star." Remus scoffed.<br/>Sirius let out a bark of laughter, "Oh what a pair we'd make."</p>
<p>The tips of Remus' ears reddened at the implication of Sirius' words and he averted his eyes to the stones beneath his feet.<br/>What was this gorgeous man doing, stopping in the middle of the street, to have a conversation with him?  With Remus.<br/>Before Remus could get think too much on this, his inner monologue was interrupted by Sirius voice.</p>
<p>"Where are you off to?" he asked.<br/>"Oh, I was just going to get some tea while I study." Remus had completely forgotten about the warm and floral scented café he was supposed to be in at this very moment.<br/>"Oh! I'm sorry, I'm wasting your time," Sirius made a move to leave but Remus stopped him. He wasn't sure why, but, he didn't want this stranger to go just yet.<br/>"No, no, it's fine, really. Where are you headed?" Remus tried to keep the conversation going.<br/>Sirius did not seem too keen on leaving just then, anyways. "I'm just walking home from work," he said "I was actually just texting my flatmate when you . . ." Sirius trailed off, eyes flickering between Remus and himself, glinting with amusement.<br/>"Er- Sorry about that, again." Remus' cheeks heated up at the embarrassing memory of himself pouncing on Sirius.<br/>"Like I said before, no need to apologize, Moony."</p>
<p>Moony? Remus thought.<br/>"Moony?" he then asked aloud.<br/>It was Sirius' turn to be embarrassed. "Yeah, because, Remus . . . Lupin. Wolves. And werewolves. They howl at the moon. Get it?" he explained awkwardly.</p>
<p>Remus scoffed at the lack of creativity. "Seri- Really?"<br/>Sirius grinned at the last-second correction in Remus' sentence.<br/>"Yes. Moony. I like it." Sirius confirmed.<br/>Remus rolled his eyes although he got a strange, fluttering feeling in his chest when Sirius used the newly discovered nickname. "Not very clever." he thought aloud.<br/>"I am plenty clever, thank you very much!" Sirius defended himself dramatically whilst sticking his nose into the air.<br/>"I'm sure." Remus replied, thoroughly unconvinced.<br/>Sirius flipped his hair over his shoulder and huffed before bluntly stating, "You wound me, Moony."</p>
<p>Remus wrinkled his nose at the nickname. It was becoming more and more insufferable each time Sirius addressed him with it.<br/>"Why the sour face, Moonlight?" Sirius asked innocently.<br/>"Oh don't even start," Remus whined, hanging his head.<br/>"Start what, Moonshine?"<br/>Remus sighed in defeat. At least he would only have to deal with that awful nickname for the rest of this conversation.</p>
<p>Suddenly the thought hit him; how much longer will this conversation be? Would he ever speak to Sirius after today? Would Remus ever even see him after this interaction was over? Different variations of these questions started flooding Remus' mind, invading all other thought and distracting him from the world around him. He must have been fairly out-of-it because he was pulled out of his thoughts and back into the world around him by Sirius snapping his fingers in front of Remus' face.</p>
<p>"Remus? Hello? Remus! Did you even hear what I said?" Sirius asked.<br/>"Sorry, I got lost in thought. What was that?" Remus apologized.<br/>"I was just saying, I should get going and let you get some work done," Sirius repeated.<br/>"Right. Yes. Of course." Remus replied after properly hearing Sirius this time.<br/>"Well, it's been real. See you around, Moony!" Sirius shouted over his shoulder as he weaved quickly through the crowd. Remus groaned at the nickname and turned to yell at Sirius' back.</p>
<p>"I don't even have your number!"</p>
