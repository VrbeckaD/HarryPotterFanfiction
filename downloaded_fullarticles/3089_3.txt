  <b>Chapter 1 - Prequel</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Aurora</b>
</p><p>Aurora Sinistra pulled her robes tightly around her. It was a cold night, and the icy wind sent a chill to her bones. She couldn't sleep so she had taken her telescope to the castle roof and spent the twilight hours alone with the stars. The view before her eyes was so beautiful that she felt almost hypnotised, drawn towards twinkling stars and distant planets like a sailor to a siren.</p><p>She imagined being able to travel to the worlds she gazed upon, perhaps with a wedding band on her finger and Ronon's arm around her waist. Her mother loved Ronon. To her mother he was already her son-in-law. Everything was always Ronon this and Ronon that, and she was no longer sure which feelings were her own and which belonged to her mother. She loved mother, but at times she wished she wouldn't interfere in her love life so much. She could be so infuriating and relentless.</p><p>She sighed. Was that really the life she wanted? She couldn't answer Ronon when he asked for her hand three months ago and she couldn't now. He was Bulgarian and great warrior amongst his people. His father had trained him at a young age to fight with his fists. Ronan studied hard, learned the art of Anoch Darsk and entered in to fighting tournaments. Aurora had seen the many trophies and belts Ronan had won. Ronan was undefeated. He fought like a champion and if the trophies weren't enough to prove that, then the scars across his rippling muscles was. The battle scars covering his chest was almost like reading a constellation of stars.</p><p>All she wanted to do that night was to be alone and even that wasn't going as planned. Mrs Norris, the caretaker's cat, had appeared and was curling round her legs.</p><p>Aurora walked towards the doorway quickly to see if she had any other visitors, or if anyone was lurking about in the shadows. When no one else appeared she turned her attention back to the cat and scooped her up in her arms. The cat purred and stretched her neck up to give Aurora an affectionate head-butt.</p><p>"Thank you," Aurora said and smiled as she walked, the cat still in her arms, back over to her telescope. As she stroked the cat's neck a flicker of light caught her eye. Her eyes searched the school grounds and the surrounding area and then she saw it again. It was a very small light, the glow of a wand tip moving through the trees. Someone was in the Forbidden Forest, most likely someone who was up to no good. Maybe it was Filch simply looking for Mrs Norris.</p><p>She frowned. There were strict rules, and entry in to the forest was prohibited. Even teachers were warned against entering the forest, but that never stopped them. It's well known that Professor Agnes Tishall once got lost for two whole weeks. When they eventually found her, she was half starving and muttering incomprehensible nonsense over and over. She was never the same again. Apparently she was looking for a very rare herb to make tea with, but no one will ever know the name of it as she refuses to speak of it. A short time after the incident she handed in her notice and a new teacher, Professor Sprout, was appointed as the new Herbology Teacher.</p><p>The Forbidden Forest was a very dangerous place, and Aurora couldn't for the life of her understand why it was located so close to the school grounds. She found it odd that such a dangerous place existed at all. As a child she had once ventured in to the forest. It was an experience that haunts her to this day. An innocent game of Wizard Hide-And-Seek turned in to a three hour nightmare. She got lost in the woods, running in circles until she was rescued by the groundskeeper. She was covered in filth and found sleeping under the rotting remains of a fallen tree. She shuddered at the memory and made a mental note to never be so stupid ever again.</p><p>So who would be wandering about in the forest at this hour she thought, and then the sound of someone clearing their throat made her almost jump out of her skin.</p><p>"Excuse me for the interruption Professor, but might I have my cat back?"</p><p>It was Argus Filch the school caretaker. His face was haggard and he looked worn from many years of yelling at students. Aurora managed to compose herself. She smiled and rubbed the cat's ear.</p><p>"Mrs Norris often keeps me company late at night when I cannot sleep. I welcome her visits," she said.</p><p>Filch eyed her cautiously for a moment before saying, "She's a good creature. Never done any harm, apart from ridding the castle of unwanted pests. She keeps a close eye on those students, reports back she does when there's trouble".</p><p>Aurora smiled and lowered the cat to the ground, who skipped contentedly towards her master. "All children get up to mischief. It's lucky the Hogwarts students have you and Mrs Norris to keep them inline."</p><p>Filch wasn't sure if he was being mocked, but he nodded a thank you to her. He picked his cat up and hugged her tightly to his body. He then left and Aurora was once again alone.</p><p>She turned back to look for the flicker of wand light she'd seen earlier but it was gone. She searched the trees a moment longer, but the light didn't reappear. It might have been a mischievous student wandering about after hours. Whoever it was, she hoped that whatever darkness lurked in the forest had left them well alone.
She bid the moon good night, packed up her telescope and went to her chambers to store it away safely.</p><p>Still feeling wide-awake she thought getting a hot chocolate from the kitchens might be a good idea, and so left her room and headed down stairs. A drop of fire whiskey in her hot chocolate might be just what she needed.</p><p>
  <b>Severus</b>
</p><p>Severus Snape hurried down the dark passageway, the sound of his footsteps echoed off the walls. His skin was as pale as the moonlight and facial expression was like marble. He looked as cold and as hard as the floor he was walking on. He could have a passed for a vampire.</p><p>A sound came from his left and as quick as lightning he flicked out his wand, "Lumos." The tiny light produced at the end of his wand lit up the passageway and showed that it was empty. There was no one there except for him and a few portraits of important figures from wizarding history. One of whom was Falcon Gyros, who was currently snoozing away in his picture frame.</p><p>Falcon Gyros was a Wizard who once taught an Animagus class at Hogwarts. He was famed for his dealings with Alchemy and his theory on the law of equivalent exchange. Unfortunately his eagerness to impress and idiocy had been his downfall. During a class fieldtrip he managed to transmute his own arms in to a pair of feathery wings. The students applauded while he flapped about for their amusement. In his excitement at his success, and the encouragement of several Slytherin students he launched himself off the cliff and rather quickly met his death. Many students had to endure heavy amounts of counselling and spent a period of time at St Mungos. Since that day all successful Animagus transformations needed to be registered with the Ministry of Magic to ensure there were no further incidents.</p><p>"Incompetent fool," Snape said and marched off. He wasn't a fan of fame seekers or those who brought attention to themselves by doing idiotic things. He didn't intend to ever have his personal life splashed across the front page of The Quibbler, so he always kept a low profile.</p><p>He was in a very bad mood tonight. He was cold, and damp, and his robes were soaked at the hem from dragging along the wet grass. His socks made a squelchy noise each time he stepped and it felt like something slimy had crawled into his left shoe.</p><p>Earlier that night, Argus Filch the school Caretaker had knocked on his dungeon door to report a group of students who were planning to take a trip in to the Forbidden forest. Filch said he had heard that the Weasley twins had discovered a way of moving about the castle undetected. Filch wasn't sure by what method, but he told Snape that they had chosen the forest as their midnight expedition.</p><p>It was a fool's errand. Snape had gone in to the forest as requested by Filch, but saw no sign of any students. Instead he was met with creaking branches, snapping twigs, and scurrying creatures. There were very few things that Snape feared, but he was slightly unnerved by the eeriness of the forest at night.</p><p>He spent over an hour searching for any sign of the alleged students, and had resigned to the fact that it was a hoax. The Weasley twins would be punished. A month in detention should wipe the smirks off their faces! He would not allow anyone to make a mockery of him.</p><p>He was so enraged that as he turned a corner he didn't see Aurora Sinistra who he bumped into and sent flying across the floor. His temper eased off as he bent to help her up, but not enough to stop him saying, "You should watch where you are going!"</p><p>She brushed dust from her robes and looked at him annoyed. "Thank you for that Severus. That was just what I needed to cure my insomnia. A concussion!"</p><p>Severus narrowed his eyes at her. "Has it not occurred to you to use wand light when moving about the castle at night? Had I been an intruder, you may very well have taken your last breath tonight."</p><p>"I could ask you what business you had loitering about at such a late hour, but I don't have the energy for your answer." She rubbed the back of her skull, and winced at the pain, where a small bump had formed.</p><p>He moved towards her, his hand reaching out to touch her skin. "Let me see your injury. I may have a suitable ointment in my chambers." His tone was steely. It was a command and not a request.</p><p>She flinched to avoid his touch and took a step backwards, increasing the distance between them. "It's fine. It's just a bump. I'm fine and I doubt any ointment of yours would help."</p><p>Severus pulled his hand back. He looked hurt, but then anger flashed across his face. "As you wish." He studied her expression and when he was satisfied she was telling the truth about being fine he walked away.</p><p>"Wait!" she called to him feeling a pang of guilt for dismissing him so quickly, "wait a moment please," and then stared at his back as he came to an abrupt holt. She noticed bits of twigs and pine needles were embedded in the fibres of his robes. Speaking rudely to people wasn't something she did often, but Snape brought that characteristic out in her.</p><p>"Sev," she cleared her throat, "Severus." He didn't turn around. "Forgive my brashness, I'm tired and I am grateful for your concern". He turned to face her, eyeing her suspiciously just as Argus Filch had. What was it that caused the men in the castle to doubt her sincerity she thought. "Severus, before we literally bumped in to one another a moment ago, I was on my way to the kitchen for a hot chocolate. I had hoped it would help me sleep. You may join me if you like."</p><p>Snape hesitated, "I don't care for such things, however, I will escort you." He signalled with his hand for her to start walking and she complied.</p>
