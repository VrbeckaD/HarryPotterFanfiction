          <div class="userstuff"><p>Last full moon was harsh.</p><p>Remus woke up in the Shrieking Shack to the smell of blood and Sirius' hair. He opened his eyes. Sirius was looking at him with something like concern. Remus glanced at his own chest and noticed some new cuts and bruises.</p><p>‘It’s nothing.’ annoyed by the fact that his friend wouldn’t stop staring at him like a troubled mother, he mumbled, not meeting Padfoot’s eyes ‘Madam Pomfrey will be here in a moment, you should go.’</p><p>Sirius, not knowing what to do or say, slid off the bed and vanished under the invisibility cloak, which James left before going back with Peter.</p><p>After lunch ,Sirius started to feel really stupid. Remus was one of his best friends and he couldn’t even manage to say a word this morning. It was understandable Remus didn’t want him there. I mean, who would like someone gaping at your wounds. Except Sirius wasn’t really occupied with the wounds. He was used to them. Of course he was worried about Remus, but he was worried after each full moon. Sadly, it was nothing new.</p><p>He was staring at him, because Remus was so calm when he was sleeping beside Sirius. He loved it. He loved the fact that he could make Moony breathe steadily and stop thinking about any problems. He loved the feeling of Remus’ breath on his neck and he loved counting Remus’ freckles when the other wasn’t aware. And this morning, Remus looked so beautiful. He was very quiet, a little smirk wandering on his face. He tucked his nose into Sirius’ neck and Sirius couldn’t imagine anything better. Moony was just breathtaking. And when he woke up and spoke, Padfoot was thunderstruck, he couldn’t think, let alone speak or act. So he ran away.</p><p>Sirius decided he had to make it up to his Moony. He couldn't let him think that Sirius reacted like that to his scratches, because Remus wouldn't not want him there the next time. And Sirius would die from nerves if he was to stay in the castle on a full moon.</p><p>He planned everything, packed a handful of chocolate frogs into his bag and went down to the kitchen where house elves supplied him with a jug of hot tea and a blueberry pie. Sirius was already at the door, when he noticed a bunch of flowers stuck into a jar on the tea table.</p><p>‘You mind if I take those?’</p><p>‘No sir, we’ll be happy to give you those!’ one elf squeaked.</p><p>‘Thanks’ he grinned and ran to the hospital wing, but as soon as he opened the door he saw madame Pomfrey in the entrance. He sprang back.</p><p>‘No visitors today.’</p><p>‘But, ma'am, I have to see Remus, it’s urgent’ he stood on his toes to see closed curtains around the only occupied bed.</p><p>‘I am sorry mister Black, but mister Lupin is very tired and should rest.’</p><p>‘But-’</p><p>‘No visitors!’ she shut the door, but he didn’t hear any footsteps so she was probably waiting for him to walk away, so he did, having nothing else to do.</p><p>He spent the whole double charms thinking about how to creep in the hospital wing, coming out with nothing, and only annoying James and Peter because he was waving his wand dangerously, making their robes fly or setting their notes on fire.</p><p>Luckily for him, though unfortunately for Mary, the girl fell from the stairs near the Gryffindor common room and sprained her ankle. As there were no professors nearby her friend ran to madam Pomfrey, because she was too scared to even touch Mary (which was silly, after all it was only a sprained ankle).</p><p>Sirius decided he would go to the hospital wing from the other side and, as soon as madam Pomfrey left, he would creep in. He had his bag and was running with all his might. Maybe if he weren't running so hastily, he would have stopped before the corner to check if there was anyone around, but he did not and so, he ran straight into the bloody matron. He swore under his breath and tried to look innocently, but he was all blushed and had a gigantic bag on his shoulder. Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips.</p><p>‘What are you doing here <em>again,</em> mister Black? Haven’t I told you there are no visitors allowed today?'</p><p>‘Oh, that, yes. Yes, of course. I wasn’t even <em>dreaming</em> about breaking that rule’ he smirked nonchalantly. ‘I was only passing by-' but at that moment, as if it all wasn’t nearly enough, his bag ripped and all the food fell onto the floor, tea spilling everywhere.</p><p>‘You were trying to smuggle that into my hospital! You would be cleaning this if I wasn’t hurrying somewhere else! And I don’t trust you to stay here by yourself!’ she was furious, it was embarrassing, really, Sirius thought, making such a fuss over a visit and some food, exaggerating.</p><p>She made one smooth move with her wand, the mess vanished, and Sirius’ bag was repaired.</p><p>‘Now, you’ll come with me and we’ll see professor McGonagall, she will know what to do with you, Black.’</p><p>And so they did, madam Pomfrey healed Mary and took Sirius to the head of Gryffindor house. She gave him detention, today evening, he was going to clean all buckets in the castle (no magic! of course). Could this day get any worse.</p><p> </p><p>He returned to his dormitory at ten to midnight, Remus wasn’t there and that meant his wounds were really severe this time. Padfoot was determined to visit him and that strict woman couldn’t stop him. He borrowed James’ invisibility cloak, packed some chocolate frogs into is pockets, and power walked towards the hospital wing.</p><p>He stopped in front of the door and opened them cautiously, they creaked horribly so he slipped quickly into the room and stood as close to the wall as he could, observing as madam Pomfrey emerged from her office. She closed the door, looking around suspiciously, then went backed to her room. He crept past the curtains of Remus’ bed. The other boy gasped, looking alarmed.</p><p>‘Shhhhh, it’s me’ Sirius took off the cloak and cast a silencing spell ‘I wanted to see you the whole day, but that old bat wouldn’t let me in and-’</p><p>‘'Couse I asked her’</p><p>‘What?’</p><p>‘I asked her not to let anyone in here. I didn’t want to see you today. Sorry.’ as he spoke, a blush was slowly growing on his cheeks and his voice was becoming quieter.</p><p>‘Oh’ that one stung, Sirius felt his knees weaken.</p><p>‘It was because I saw how you reacted today morning! I didn’t want you to worry about me, I didn't want you to see me like that- ‘ Remus started explaining.</p><p>‘You ass, like it was the first time i saw you like that! Of course I worry about you, you’re my friend Moony, that’s normal.’</p><p>‘You couldn’t even stutter out a word Padfoot. I don’t know, I just- you seemed-’</p><p>‘It wasn’t because I was scared or something.’ Sirius frowned</p><p>‘Then why?’ Remus answered with a frown of his own.</p><p>Sirius started blushing and mumbling, something about the food he prepared, something about the flowers, and that he’s sorry, and the chocolate frogs, but it didn’t make much sense really. Remus shut him up and took his hand.</p><p>‘Sit down for a moment’ he said with a gentle laughter ‘all that’s extremely kind and sweet, but that doesn’t answer my question, doesn't really explain what happened this morning. So it wasn’t me, okay, but are you worried about something? Because I'm worried now, tell me what’s going on?’</p><p>‘Doesn’t it?’</p><p>‘What?’ Remus gave him a confused look.</p><p>‘I think it does explain, really.’ he sighted ‘And I <em>was</em> thinking about you, the thing is I wasn’t really worried. I mean, I always am, but I know you’re strong, and there is madam Pomfrey, she’s great, and you have us, so I wasn’t really worried, not more than always.’ he paused, his face burning. He felt so hot, he wondered if it was possible to get a fever from embarrassment. Remus waited. Sirius knew, so he spoke again, but his voice got so quiet it was hard to understand anything ‘I was admiring'.</p><p>'Admiring? Admiring what?' Remus asked puzzled, his question followed by a long silence.</p><p>‘Admiring what Sirius?’ he repeated gently, squeezing Sirius’ hand.</p><p>‘You’ Sirius wasn’t looking at Remus, as a matter of fact he was trying to look anywhere but at him. The bed creaked and he felt a delicate hand cradle his cheek, he raised his eyes, surprised. Remus, now seated, moved closer, stopping when their foreheads touched. </p><p>‘May I?’ Remus asked whispered when his eyes wandered to Sirius' lips.</p><p>Sirius swallowed audibly, his heart beating at an unusual pace.</p><p>‘Yeah, go for it’.</p><p>And so, Remus did. The kiss was slow and gentle and delicate and all Remus has dreamed of for years. And Sirius? Even longer. Despite their stupidity and obliviousness, it happened at last.</p><p>Sirius broke the kiss, a mischievous grin splitting his face ‘I still got those chocolate frogs, are you sure you don-’</p><p>‘I don’t give a fuck Sirius, shut up.’ Moony sighted with a smile. ‘Come here.' Remus reached for Sirius and snaked his arms around his waist, resting his head in the crook of his neck. The happy sigh he let out warmed Sirius' heart. They stayed this way, exchanging kisses broken by their smiles and giggles, and finally, both of them quite tired, they fell asleep embracing each other.</p><p>And if Sirius was going to get another detention for trying to sneak in and finally succeeding, well, it didn't really matter to him, as they were together at last.</p></div>
