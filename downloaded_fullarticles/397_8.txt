  <em> “What happens now?” </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Death waved his arm. A bluish light broke through the hall. “Go through that and you’ll return." </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> He walked towards the light. He could almost hear his friends calling to him. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> "You won’t remember any of this. You get a second chance.” </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> “What about you?” he asked, turning away from the light. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> “I am Death,” There was a sad smile on his face. “I’ve used up all my chances. All I can do is watch until I am called.”  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> He looked at Death once more before stepping through the light. </em>
</p><p>Harry closed the book with a disappointed huff. “That’s the ending?”</p><p>Severus scoffed. “What do you expect? Only a fool makes deals with Death.”</p><p>That response did little to fix his disappointment. He’d purposely picked the least darkly titled book off the shelves in hopes that it would be a decent read. “Don't you have more uplifting books?”  </p><p>“It would go against my image if I had those type of happily ever after nonsense you call literature” Severus said not even looking away from the Potions text in his hand. </p><p>Harry laughed. Severus had made it very clear from the moment he saw one of the novels Hermione had lent him- the type that clearly was written with witches in mind- that he didn’t care for his choice in reading material.  “Is it a crime to like romance?”</p><p>“It is when you try to push such rubbish into me.” Severus turned the page. </p><p>It wasn’t his fault that Severus could tell right away when he’d tried to sneak a few of his favorite books onto the man’s bookshelves last week. He’d hoped that Severus would give it a try if he showed interest in the other books, but it appeared that wasn’t going to happen.</p><p>“Okay. Okay.” Harry moved from the book self towards Severus’s chair.  “No romance for the scary potion professor” he whispered leaning over picking the book out of Severus’s hands. With his hands free, Severus pulled at his loose tie bringing him closer; onyx eyes meeting his own mismatched eyes. </p><p>“Definitely no romance,” he said with a triumphant smile on his face.</p><p>Severus smirked. There was no hesitation as their lips met while he moved to straddle the man. They had spent so long fighting against one another for reasons that he had no idea of until the world had turned things upside down. Whenever Harry reflected it always seemed that one day they had gone from meaninglessly hating each other to fighting alongside each other. For years he’d interpreted Snapes' careful watch as something to be suspicious of, he had been so sure that one day this man was going to betray the trust that Dulmbedore had in him. Everything had pointed that way for so long, or so that’s what it seemed when nearly all his classmates swapped stories about his rough demeanor- really the man had never once said anything overtly kind in class to anyone. The rivalry between Slytherin house and Gryfindor had also propelled his negative view of Snape in the beginning and seeing Draco Malfoy- his own personal rival- excel in potions with a superior look on his face while he constantly needed Hermione to keep his potions from turning nuclear added to his dislike of Snape. And then he found out that through all his run-ins with Voldemort it was Snape that had saved him through actions in the background. Learning about Snape’s true loyalties made it incredibly difficult to truly hate the man. How can you hate someone who risks his life to save others? That was a question he struggled with for some time until the man had sat beside him at the top of the Astronomy Tower after Sirius’s death. Not one word was spoken at the time but just having the man sitting there had helped so much that from that day on Snape had become Severus in his mind. And now they were like this.</p><p>Nothing mattered when it was just them. They both needed that; needed this sense of calm in the chaos. What did it matter if the weight of the world sat on his shoulder? What did it matter that he was prophesied to save the wizarding world by defeating Voldemort? Neither of them were sure what the next day would bring, but when they were entangled like this tomorrow wasn't a thought.  </p><p>“Harry,” Severus placed a sturdy hand onto the lower part of his back. </p><p>“Take me” he whispered pressing their bodies closer.</p><p>They didn't have the luxury of taking things slow the way Severus wanted. Any day they could be facing war. Before he died, he wanted to know that in the final days he hadn't stopped living out of fear. He needed to know that he hadn’t tossed away a chance at love. </p><p>Hands pulled him back, reducing the closeness he desired. </p><p>“How can you be such a git when we are like this?” he groaned.</p><p>“You make it easy with your lack of seduction.” </p><p>“Oh?” he teased running his hands through Severus’s long hair. “Then show me how it's done.”</p><p>“Is that a challenge?” Severus whispered sending shivers up his spine. </p><p>Skilled fingers dipped into their dance of familiar teasing pattern down his back until Severus’s hands stilled. Pain spread along Severus’s face as he seized his left forearm. </p><p>“Severus!”</p><p>“I'm being summoned” Severus grunted through the pain. “I need to go.”</p><p>Seeing this pain was unbearable, each time he wished that Voldemort hadn’t this power over him. “Come back to me.” He pushed back some hair that clung to Severus’ set brow. </p><p>“I will” Severus said looking deep into his eyes. He had to believe that Severus would come back as he always had. Keeping Severus here would only prolong his suffering. </p><p>The second he removed himself Severus hurriedly grabbed his Death Eater gear and stormed out. </p><p>This wasn't the first time he witnessed this but there was something different, a squirming feeling inside that protested Severus’s departure more than usual.  He occupied himself tidying up the already immaculate bookshelf. As he picked up another book pain struck his head so hard that he grasped the shelf to keep himself upright. This blinding pain had to be because Voldemort was excited. That realization sent a cold sweat down his back. </p><p>Tightly he shut his eyes trying to see what the Dark Lord was projecting into his mind. At first, it was only darkness then he saw the disheveled house they were in. Several Death Eaters were standing in a circle and someone was in its center on their knees. </p><p>“My Lord” Severus’s ragged voice rose from the kneeled figure.</p><p>Harry's heart sunk. </p><p>“Crucio!”</p><p> Severus fell into a heap of spazzing black mass. </p><p>Pain throbbing against Harry’s skull as he tried to pull himself together. He had to sever this link, he needed to get to Severus. Severus needed him.</p><p>Voldemort stepped into the circle while the others watched Severus’s slumped form.“You thought you could fool us Ssseverusss?” Voldemort hissed turning his wand slightly. “You thought we would not see you for the traitor that you are?” Voldemort eyes shone gleefully as another Crucio hit Severus.</p><p>“SEVERUS” Harry screamed despite his words unable to reach. Severus’s body shook violently as Voldemort cast another Crucio. “STOP! STOP!” he cried as he crawled towards the door, each move sending the pain in his head to steadily increase. </p><p>“Ah, hello Harry”  Voldemort smiled, red eyes peering directly at him.</p><p>Crippling pain engulfed him blurring his vision as he kept crawling. Harry wasn’t going to allow Severus to die like this. Severus need help and he was going to get it even if his head felt like it was being crushed.</p><p> If he just got to someone anyone then...then everything would be alright.</p><p>With tears streaming down his face Harry kept crawling blindly, his fingers gripping the stone flooring to drag his tired body.</p><p>The last thing he saw was a green light before the link between him and Voldemort severed. There could only be one reason why the link would end now. </p><p>Slowly he pulled himself up and out of  Severus’s chambers. Using the walls to steady him he struggled down the hall to the Gryffindor tower. That green light...the killing curse, was something that not even Dumbledore could fix.  Firelight danced as he ran as fast as his legs could possibly move. Out of breath he climbed the steps before wheezing the password to the Fat Lady and stepped through the portrait hole.</p><p>“H-Hermione” he panted falling onto all fours. Everything within him was screaming to fully collapse, but he couldn’t blackout now.</p><p>“What happened?” Hermione rose from the seat beside the fire. Ron looked at him with wide fearful eyes.</p><p>“Time-Turner,” he said when he felt his voice a little stronger.</p><p>“You need to rest,” Hermione said as she helped Ron lift him.</p><p>Harry shook his head, leaving him a little dizzy. “Time-Turner” he repeated with a bit more urgency. “Need it.”</p><p>“What you need that for mate? What happened?” Ron asked offering him a cup of water.</p><p>Smacking the drink away he stared at Hermione. “I need it NOW!”</p><p>“Harry!”</p><p>“Please,” he choked unable to hold back his sobs anymore. Ron and Hermione stared at him worried maybe even frightened of his odd behavior. </p><p>They wouldn’t understand if he told them. They didn't know anything about him and Severus when the war was over, when everyone was safe, he was going to tell them the truth. Tell them how he fell in love with Severus. Tell them how and why he had hidden that secret from them. Tell them how he had found solace in the one person he'd least expect to.</p><p>“Please Hermione” he begged clutching her sleeve.</p><p>“Of course Harry.” Hermione’s hand shook as she reached for her wand. With a whispered spell against one of the bricks of the fireplace, she extracted the Time-Turner from its hiding place. </p><p>“Thank you” he wept clutching the necklace. This was going to save Severus.</p><p>“Be careful” Ron said as he made to step out of the portrait hole. Although they didn't know why he needed this he was glad that they were going to let him do this alone. The world around him moved backwards in time in wild swirls. When a dark blur of robes started passing him he knew he was close to the time Severus had left him. This time he wouldn't allow Severus to go. Stopping the Time-Turner set things in proper motion once more bringing him face to face with Severus.</p><p>“Harry?” Severus looked at him with a stern questioning look.  Harry stared at him the Death Eater mask in his grasp against the folds of his billowing cloak.</p><p>“Don’t go” he cried wanting to glue the man to this spot if he didn’t listen. “Please Severus turn back.”</p><p>Severus’s eyes looked at his chest where the Time-Turner laid. “You should not be messing with time Mr. Potter.”</p><p>A strangled chuckle escaped him. The short time without Severus had made him miss the man’s snarky remarks. Tears treaded down his face just thinking of what would happen if Severus continued. </p><p>Severus winced clutching the Dark Mark. Harry knew the pain would increase but he wasn’t going to let him walk into his death.</p><p>“Don't leave” he pleaded. Severus had to understand why he was stopping him. “Go back” he said tugging on the Time-Turner. Without another word, Severus turned on his heels and returned from where he came.</p><p>***</p><p>In the early morning, a thunderous boom shook the castle. Death Eaters were trying to break through the wards around Hogwarts. A second boom set all those who hadn't woken from the first to scramble from their beds. No one was prepared as he left with Ron as his side he caught sight of the first and second years huddling together. Many pairs of eyes turned to him all asking what are you going to do. McGonagall pushed through the common room fireplace, her face more pallid then he had ever seen.</p><p>“Listen up everyone” she spoke in a strong voice. “Hogwarts is under attack.” Harry spotted a few of the first years start to tear up. “You are all to remain here. I'll secure this common room so that you’ll be safe until it's over.” McGonagall's eyes fell to him.</p><p>Harry knew he couldn’t wait out of the way like the others, the prophecy placed him to be the only one to stop Voldemort and now that the time came he couldn’t shy away from that.  Gripping his wand and invisibility cloak he nodded to his Head of House. Taking one step forward he felt two more join him.</p><p>“We are going to get through this together” Hermione said with determination taking his hand. Ron nodded in agreement holding onto his other hand.</p><p>“I’ll fight!” Neville stood up.</p><p>“Me too!” added a seventh year and another stood. More and more sixth and seventh years rose to join in the center of the room.</p><p>“You all understand what is happening don’t you” McGonagall asked looking at the band of students. The group nodded. McGonagall looked at all of them with a tearful gaze. </p><p> </p><p>The next thing he knew Harry was scrambling through the hidden path under the Whomping Willow leading to the Shrieking Shack. Exhaustion pulled at his legs more than the roots that jutted out in the dark pathway.</p><p>“Lumos” he panted waving his wand but the light flickered on and off like a flashlight losing power. More than once he tripped smacking his head hard against the narrowing underground walls. The pain didn't matter he had to keep going Severus was waiting for him. Through fighting the Death Eaters that entered the castle there had been no time to seek out Severus. Knowing the man he would’ve been the first on the battlefield. Only once had they discussed what to do when this day came,</p><p>“I’m coming” he panted. Severus was going to be there just as they had agreed long ago.</p><p>Harry hadn't thought that the Death Eaters would have been driven out so efficiently with the continued efforts of the professors, upper years from all four houses. When Aurors finally appeared the battle had been as good as won. And when he'd stood to fight Voldemort he felt so strong knowing that he hadn't gone to face the monster completely alone- Hermione and Ron were right beside him as they had been from the very beginning. Now the war was over. Voldemort was dead. Once he got to Severus everything would be perfect. They were at last safe.</p><p>“Severus” he panted bushing through the secret entrance of the shabby shack.</p><p>A wheezing sound coming from the far corner set off alarms in his head. His eyes followed the eerie sound landing upon Severus his brow knitted in intense pain.</p><p>“Severus!” Rushing to his side he searched for any injuries but he couldn't see any gashes or anything. There was no physical sign of the pain on the man’s face.</p><p>“H-harry,” Severus tried to give him a reassuring smile but there was far too much pain in those dark eyes. Sweat collected on his forehead his skin steadily lost color.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” A shaky hand reached for his face dabbing the sweat on his brow. </p><p>“I thought we made it” Severus sadly chuckled. “How naive.”</p><p>“We did make it.” he grabbed Severus’s hand, it felt so cold. “We did make it!” he repeated gently squeezing his hand. “Voldemort is dead. We are free.”</p><p>Severus laughed a dark sorrowful laugh that couldn't possibly be mistaken for true laughter. There was no joy or relief that he had been so sure would come from his words. Severus started to shake as though freezing, but to Harry the room was so hot.</p><p>“You need help,” Harry made to run back for help but Severus pulled him back. </p><p>“The Dark Lord it seems gave me a parting gift” Severus winced as he lifted his arm. Barring his left arm Harry could see the Dark Mark had taken on an acidic green color. The veins that ran alongside the mark were horrifically darkened. “A traitor's death.” Severus explained. Once he realized my true alliance  he activated it..slowly poisoning me”</p><p>Pulling his eyes away from the discolored mark he looked into onyx eyes that held such little light. “Can’t you fix this?”</p><p>“It’s too late Harry. I tried everything I had,” Weakly Severus pointed to a small pile of empty vials lay a few inches away. “I'm glad I got to see you one last time,”</p><p>“Don’t say that! Please don’t!” He buried his face into Severus’s chest. “Don't I.. I..  You can’t! I...” Holding tight he cried listening to Severus' slowing breath and thumping heartbeat until all too suddenly it stopped. “Severus?” Pulling away he took in the way Severus’s body slumped. Everything in his heart lurched as he cradled Severus’s limp head. “I saved you before I,” He tugged the chain around his neck, pulling out the Time-Turner he had from the previous night. To his horror, the hourglass was damaged not even a grain of sand remained.</p><p>“NO! NO!”</p><p>Not knowing what else to fo he pulled out the resurrection stone. “Please” he begged the stone as he twisted it in his hand. The rock did nothing. No trace of magic buzzed between his fingers. “Bring him back!” he commanded tapping the elder wand against it. </p><p>Nothing happened. </p><p>“I NEED HIM! I LOVE HIM! PLEASE!” He jabbed the stupid useless rock again. He wanted to blast the thing into pieces. He couldn’t understand why nothing was working. Why had this have to happen?</p><p> Why?</p><p> Why? </p><p>Why? </p><p>Why? </p><p>WHY?</p><p>WHY?</p><p>WHY?</p><p>The drop in temperature stirred him.  A figure stood in the shrieking shack looming over them but he didn’t try to cast a single spell at it. Somehow he knew this figure was neither human or magical beast. He remembered seeing the night his parents died. It was Death. Death had come to take Severus away forever.</p><p>“Don’t,”  his voice came out above a whisper. Death turned to him yet he couldn't see any facial features. “Don't take him” he said with more force holding tightly onto Severus.</p><p><em> I must  </em>a voice whispered in his head.</p><p>“He doesn't deserve to die.” </p><p>Death shook its head.  <em> He must. </em></p><p>He had defied Death once and wasn't sure he could do it a second time but for Severus he would try. “I won’t let you!”</p><p>Death turned its head in a curious tilt.</p><p>“I...” He stared at the elder wand- he still had all three Deathly Hallows that made him the Master of Death, didn't it?  “I’ll destroy the Deathly Hallows. If you don’t take him I will make sure they are destroyed.”</p><p>Death pointed to the resurrection stone. The stone began to crumble away to ash in his hand. <em> Already spent. </em></p><p>Harry understood he'd already stopped Severus’s Death once. “I still have two chances.”</p><p>Death nodded outstretching its long arms for the next Hallow. </p><p><em> “Only fools make deals with Death” </em> he remembered Severus saying. This was foolish, perhaps the most foolish thing he could do. It would be so easy to be tricked by Death. </p><p>Turning away from Death he carded his fingers through Severus’s hair before cupping his face. Severus didn’t deserve to die. The man had risked so much for so long. If making a foolish deal would get him back then he would do so again and again. </p><p>“I won't give you the next Hallow unless I’m given a fair shot at saving him” he said glaring at Death.</p><p>
  <em> Fair?  </em>
</p><p>He tapped the broken Time-Turner around his neck. Maybe just maybe... “Time,” he said looking at Death. “Take me back in time so I can save him.”</p><p>
  <em> Back? </em>
</p><p>“Back enough so that I have time.”</p><p>Death nodded opening its hand once again.</p><p>“I’ll have enough time to save him?” he asked wearily of handing another Hallow over.</p><p>
  <em> Yes. </em>
</p><p>Unsure how trustworthy Death was he hesitated to hand over the invisibility cloak. Looking over at Severus’s lifeless body there was no other choice than to trust Death.  Handing the invisibility cloak, Harry watched as the fabric began to unravel. His head grew lighter and lighter as the threads spilled onto the floor. A lurch in his stomach reminded him of the pull of a portkey but this was different, stronger. It was like being sucked into a dark hole. Fearful that he had been tricked Harry clung onto Severus. If he was going to be killed by Death itself he wanted to be near him. Clutching Severus’s limp hand he shut his eyes to the swaying feeling in his head. </p><p>When the heavyweight of Severus’s hand disappeared he carefully opened his eyes. The Shrieking Shack wasn’t around him instead, he found himself looking up into a clear blue sky alone. </p><p>Harry blinked once, twice, thrice and still nothing changed but the moving clouds above. The scent of water carried on the light breeze. Sitting up he recognized that he had been lying at the edge of the Great Lake. Inching to the water’s edge he looked as his reflection he still looked the same, messy hair, mismatched eyes he didn’t look as roughed up as he was moments ago. </p><p>Why was he at the lake? Why was he wearing school robes that he hadn't before?  He didn't think everything about the war and meeting Death had been a dream. It all felt too real. </p><p>Looking over he still saw Hogwarts standing tall, not a trace of collapsed walls or fires that he remembered seeing in the midst of the battle. Harry reached for his wand to find that it still was the elder wand. He had done it he must've gone back before the start of the war. Not knowing how much time he had he ran towards the castle.</p><p> The sun looked too bright and warm over the grass that he trod on was nothing like he remembered the day the war had come to Hogwarts. Looking around there weren’t any students as he ran down the hall. where was everyone? It was possible that he had gone further than the day before the battle at Hogwarts.</p><p>“Mr. Potter” Harry stopped dead in his tracks. “What are you doing out of class?”</p><p>“I-” Words froze at a familiar-looking witch. He swore he knew that tight pinched look somewhere. As the brunette witch stormed closer her anger diminished into confusion. </p><p>“I must be in the need of glasses,” she muttered to herself. “Ten points from Slytherin. I expect you to take up your meandering with your Head of House.”</p><p>Harry’s jaw went slack in part of what the witch said but at the realization that this was Professor McGonagall. The way she took points was the same, it was her face that differed more youthful by years. </p><p>“Do close your mouth. I won't hear any complaints.” McGonagall waved her hand. “Get to class or do you require an escort?” she asked when he didn’t automatically make a move.</p><p>“I..” Maybe an escort would be useful. He had no idea what class he was supposedly late for.</p><p>“Be on your way to Herbology or I will take ten more points” McGonagall warned.</p><p>Nodding he took off. The clomping of his shoes was not loud enough to wash out the millions of questions in his mind. For now, he hoped that Herbology hadn’t been changed from his year. <em> Wait </em> Harry thought. Why did he have to go to class? If he just waited then class would be let out and he would have time to understand what was going on. Sneaking around would’ve been easier with an invisibility cloak. “I should’ve given up the wand.”Harry sighed.</p><p>***</p><p>A bell chimed signaling the end of lessons and the hallway was filled with students.  Harry was rather lucky that McGonagall hadn’t decided to check the nearest empty classroom to see he was hiding out.</p><p>“Aww come on Remus” He heard someone say as he leaned against the classroom door. Carefully he snuck out of the room. The small group of students he recognized from some old photos Sirius had given him. </p><p>“Don't pull that with me” a young Remus admonished a young Sirius.</p><p>“What do we have to pull to make you say yes” Sirius wiggled his eyebrows.</p><p>Remus glared at his friends.</p><p>“Way to go Sirius” James said smacking Sirius in the back of the head.</p><p>“What did I say?” Sirius asked rubbing his head.</p><p> Harry watched the young Marauders. If they were here then... he looked around but the herd of blackened robes blended students. Unable to spot Severus he followed behind some other Slytherins. They would be able to lead him to the dormitories which were bound to see Severus. Entering the common room he expected darted eyes and glares as if they could smell his intrusion but no one gave him a secondary glance.  Aside from the large glass window that looked into the lake it wasn't all that different from the Gryffindor common room, there was still a fireplace that many younger students huddled around in comfortable chairs. Few were already scribbling on parchment in the corner. </p><p>“You there.” Harry stared at a younger Professor Slughorn, he didn’t look as round or balding as he recalled. “Come along...now what was your name ol’ chap?”</p><p>Harry blinked “Harry.”</p><p>“Oh yes, yes.”</p><p>Knowing how anal Severus was about knowing whereabouts of the students when he was Head of  House gave Harry the impression that all Heads kept tags on their students just as strictly as Severus had.  This however didn’t appear the case for Slughorn who only cared for those who had significant talent or connection to those with power or fame. </p><p>“Be a sport and carry a few things for me...” </p><p>“Harry.”</p><p>“Right. Right.”</p><p>He didn't care much for Slughorn when he had made every effort to gain access to his own fame, but if he was in the past that meant he wasn’t famous yet. Without fame attached he was just another student unworthy of remembering to Slughorn.</p><p>“Be a sport and help take this to the classroom.” Slughorn placed two wooden boxes into his hands. “Careful not to break them. Of course, the vials are shatterproof.” Slughorn laughed.</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>Wobbling a bit under the weight of the boxes he followed Slughorn into the same potion class he had gone to many times. Once he’d asked Severus why potions had to be conducted in the dungeons. Severs said that it was due to the lowered temperature which prevented ingredients from spoiling quickly. Gripping the box a little tighter he tried not to think of Severus. He’d made a deal with Death for the man he loved. If he did things right then he could prevent his death. </p><p>“Set them on my desk if you'd please” Slughorn motioned. </p><p>Grunting he placed it on the table as instructed. The classroom wasn’t all that different from the way he remembered it, it was just missing Severus’s presence. Not one of the protective and monitoring charms he associated with the man was present. </p><p>“Ah, there you are.” Slughorn clasped his hands joyfully together as a figure carrying a towering stack of books appeared from the back. Startled the stack swayed in the students arms. </p><p>“Let me help you” he said plucking the books from the top of the stack. Removing the top books revealed a  familiar straight black hair, hair that he had run his fingers through enough times for the tips of his fingers to hold sensory memory of the way those strands slipped through like silk. When he saw the face of the younger  Severus he couldn’t help but smile. On a rare occasion, one which required a little firewhiskey, his Severus had shown him a few pictures of his youth. Onyx eyes still lacking the edge of secrets that Harry knew them to contain years later, looked around the room for something before setting in a heated flare at him. </p><p>“Had to pull some assistance”  Slughorn said to Severus. “You know um...” Slughorn stared at him with a blank look.</p><p>“Harry” he offered again.</p><p>Severus looked to Slughorn then back to him.</p><p>“Oh yes, funny how such a simple name slips from the mind.” Slughorn waved his hand as if to shoo away the fleeting memory of Harry. Severus daggered glare was unrelenting. If it weren't for the occasional shifting of those eyes to Slughorn as he rambled on Harry was sure Severus would set him on fire.</p><p>“Right boys. You should move along. The second years will be down soon.”  Slughorn motioned for the door.</p><p>When it didn't seem like Severus was going to make the first move he left first. A little later Severus emerged wand in had gripped so tightly that Harry wanted to run a soothing hand over it. </p><p>“Where are the others?” Severus muttered eyes shifting across the unusually empty corridor.</p><p>“It’s just me” he smiled again. Hearing Severus's voice, not yet as low as he knew it made him want to laugh.  </p><p>“Decided to come after me on your own for once?”</p><p>He frowned at the tone, Severus sounded angry and scared. The unknown reason for those constant shifting eyes and gripped wand worried him.</p><p>“A half-arsed Polyjuce isn’t going to fool me Potter.”</p><p>In the same second he took a step forward Severus cast and expelliarmus. Light that sprung from Severus’s wand sent Harry back into the wall with so much force that the thud of his body echoed. Rubbing his head he felt something trickle down the side of his face. Onyx eyes widened to the size of saucer plates. </p><p>“Come on Potter” Severus’s hands shook as more blood dripped down Harry’s face.  “I won't fall for this.” There was genuine fear in that voice. “It's always been four on one.”</p><p>The increasing pain in his head prevented him from asking what that meant. Blood seeped through his hair. Eyes drooping he looked to the younger Severus.  “Severus” he whispered before everything went black.</p>
