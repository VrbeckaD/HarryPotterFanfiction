<p> </p>
<p>“Who are you visiting?”</p>
<p>Padma glanced up from where she was kneeled, blinking several times at the bright magenta robes and even brighter green hair. She squinted, but made no move to stand. “Weasley?”</p>
<p>The man smiled wryly, and squatted down next to her. “Patil, right?” She nodded, and gestured for him to sit, which he did, crossing his legs and settling himself on the ground next to her.</p>
<p>Padma stayed silent for a few more moments, before reaching forward and brushing snow off the headstone before her, revealing the name on it. “My sister. Are you visiting your brother?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “I tried, a few times, but…”</p>
<p>She tilted her head slightly. “It’s not him.”</p>
<p>George nodded, and they sat quietly, as Padma slowly traced a lotus flower in the thin layer of frost. “What happened?” he asked gently, and she bit her lip.</p>
<p>“She and Lavender were protecting a group of younger students. There was a stray curse, not a lethal one, but it knocked her out and she fell wrong.” George could hear the slight waver in her voice, and held out his hand, palm up, in offering. Padma sniffled and took it, squeezing hard for a few moments, before relaxing with a small sigh. “What about your brother?”</p>
<p>George’s mouth tightened. “He and Percy were fighting together, there was an explosion.”</p>
<p>Padma squeezed his hand again, more gently this time, and they lapsed into silence once more.</p>
<p>“Is that why your hair is coloured?” she asked several minutes later, suddenly. George looked at her sideways, and she blushed, but he looked amused, despite the air of sadness.</p>
<p>“Originally, yes.” he answered. “It didn’t really help, but I ended up liking it.”</p>
<p>She snorted. “Of course you would like such an obnoxious shade of green.”</p>
<p>George affected indignation. “It’s not obnoxious, it’s vibrant.”</p>
<p>“That too,” she agreed, before releasing his hand and standing up. George followed her lead, and they stood awkwardly for a moment. “It’s starting to snow again,” she pointed out. “I’m going to the Crystal Cauldron, would you care to join me?”</p>
<p>George shoved his hands in his pockets and raised an eyebrow. “Even with my obnoxious hair? Or do you need me to put on a hat?”</p>
<p>Padma laughed. “I’ll manage. It’s a small price to pay for some companionship, and I’m sure any hats you have are equally… vibrant.”</p>
<p>George smiled at her. “Lead the way.”</p>
<p>She offered him her arm and he grasped it, and they twisted into nothingness with a clap of air rushing in to replace them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Padma absently swirled her spoon through the soup she had ordered. “I smashed all my mirrors,” she said quietly, and George looked up from his own plate of food, which was complaining about being pushed around instead of eaten.</p>
<p>“Did it help?”</p>
<p>She nodded. “I think so. Not so much the lack of reflections as a reminder, but the destruction felt good. Better than just crying, anyway.”</p>
<p>“Not worried about bad luck?”</p>
<p>Padma shrugged. “How much worse can it get than losing your twin?”</p>
<p>“Shards of glass in your feet makes everything worse.” George punctuated this with a stab of his fork, upon which his meal announced it’s approval of him finally eating.</p>
<p>Padma let out an involuntary giggle. “I suppose that’s true. I vanished it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They finished their meal and departed, walking through the fresh layer of snow that had fallen while they ate. George cleared his throat, and Padma slowed a bit, waiting for him to speak.</p>
<p>“Could I invite you for a cuppa? It’s…” he trailed off, looking up into the sky as he searched for words. “It’s not that I’m enjoying commiserating about our dead siblings, but it feels…” he shrugged. “You get it.”</p>
<p>Padma nodded. “I get it. I’d like that, I think.”</p>
<p> </p>
