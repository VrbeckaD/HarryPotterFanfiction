<p>Marnie Jacobs stepped on platform 9 ¾ quarters with her dad Martin, stepmother Maureen and her two half sisters. She was starting her fourth year at Hogwarts as a Ravenclaw. The eldest of her half sisters, Madison, was starting her second year as a Gryffindor while her younger half sister, Marley, had one more year.</p>
<p>“Hey Marnie!”</p>
<p>She turned to see her best female friend in her year and house, Jacqueline Fraser, or rather Jaq. She was a pale petite brunette with grey eyes in contrast to Marnie who had light black skin with light hazel eyes.</p>
<p>“How was your summer?” she asked in her thick Scottish brogue.</p>
<p>“It was good.”</p>
<p>“As much as I like riding the train especially with my best friend, it doesn't really make sense for all the Scottish students having to ride the train.” said Jaq.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it doesn't.”</p>
<p>The train whistled and the two girls boarded the train with Madison.</p>
<p>“Hey Madison!” Her friend Neville greeted.</p>
<p>“Hey Neville!”</p>
<p>The two second years had become friends late last year. According to Madison, they were both outsiders in their dorms since Neville was sharing a dorm with two sets of best friends and she wasn't as girly as Parvati and Lavender or as intellectual as Hermione. The two second years parted ways with the two fourth years.</p>
<p>Marnie and Jaq found their usual compartment with their friends Maximus ‘Max’ Fairchild who was slightly pompous but lovable. He was a thin boy with ash blond hair and dark blue eyes.</p>
<p>There was Clara Chavez who was the resident fashionista of the girl’s dorm. She was naturally tan with hazel eyes. She was a half Spanish and half British.</p>
<p>Then there was Atticus Quigley he was the bookish one of the group and one of the top students in their year. He was below average height for his age group being five foot four and was pleasantly plump. He had bottle green eyes with shoulder length black hair.</p>
<p>Then lastly there was the youngest ones in the compartment Cho Chang and Marietta Edgecombe, they were third year Ravenclaws.</p>
<p>“Hey everyone!” Marnie greeted walking in.</p>
<p>“Hey Marnie!” Clara greeted.</p>
<p>Marnie sat down and let her tortoiseshell cat out of her carrier. She was a birthday gift last year. Her name was Nixie after the the sea nymphs in Norse Mythology. The cat looked around curiously and then hopped on the nearest empty seat.</p>
<p>“So, are you two excited to start your third year?” Marnie asked them.</p>
<p>“Yes, I hope I make it on the Quidditch team again.” answered Cho.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure you will.” Marnie exclaimed.</p>
<p>She has always been a fan of Quidditch but she didn't play it. Her dad had played briefly for the Kenmare Kestrels as a seeker after he graduated from Hogwarts in 1974.</p>
<p>Actually, that's how he had met her biological mother in late 1976. He had chatted up the barmaid at the muggle bar when he was out with his teammates and the rest was history. She was born August 2nd, 1978.</p>
<p>“I've never understood the draw of Quidditch,” Max said.</p>
<p>“It's probably because you're a muggleborn.”</p>
<p>Max shrugged.</p>
<p>“Did you see who will be teaching Defense this year?”</p>
<p>“No, I didn't.”</p>
<p>“He's the author of all our books.”</p>
<p>Before anyone could respond the sweet trolley arrived and they bought their respective favourite sweets and chatted until they reached Hogwarts. The five fourth years went to find their usual carriage and sat down. The only other Ravenclaw in their year was Roger Davies and he shared the carriage with them.</p>
<p>Once they arrived at Hogwarts, they entered the Great Hall and took their seats at the Ravenclaw table. Right after the first years filed in and the sorting started. Immediately the usual betting session between Clara and Atticus began.</p>
<p>The sorting went on and when the last student joined his house, Dumbledore stood up and began his speech, opening the feast. After dessert and Dumbledore’s parting words they went to the Ravenclaw common room.</p>
<p align="center">---</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next morning Marnie woke up a bit disoriented, but then she remembered that she was back at Hogwarts. Nixie was sleeping peacefully at the foot of her bed. She got up and started to do her routine. The next one to wake up was Jaq.</p>
<p>“I wish that classes didn't have to start so early,” Jaq complained.</p>
<p>“Me too.”</p>
<p>They didn't wait for Clara to wake up they walked downstairs.</p>
<p>Marnie noticed a few of the newer Ravenclaws and decided to go and introduce herself.</p>
<p>“Did you guys have a good first night?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, we had a good night.” said the Indian girl</p>
<p>“That's good, I'm Marnie.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, I’m Sita.”</p>
<p>Before Marnie could respond Atticus walked down the stairs to join them.</p>
<p>“Hey Attie,” Marnie greeted. She was closest to him since they were both quite bookish.</p>
<p>“Morning Mar.” he smiled at her.</p>
<p>“Let’s get down to breakfast.”</p>
<p>“It was nice meeting you.”</p>
<p>“You too.”</p>
<p>The trio of fourth years left the common room.</p>
<p>“I wish there was a shorter way to the Great Hall.” Jaq complained.</p>
<p>“Me too.”</p>
<p>They were halfway to the Great Hall when they ran into Madison, Neville and a little red haired girl.</p>
<p>“Mar!” her sister exclaimed hugging her.</p>
<p>“Hey, Maddie. How was your first night back?”</p>
<p>“It was good. This is Ginny.”</p>
<p>Marnie nodded and as they reached the Great Hall and they went their separate tables.</p>
<p>McGonagall was handing out their timetables.</p>
<p>“We have Charms with the Gryffindors first.” said Atticus</p>
<p>The girls nodded and sat down to eat. After breakfast they started walking towards the Charms classroom.</p>
<p>“Hello, Professor.” Marnie greeted the diminutive Charms Professor.</p>
<p>“Hello, Miss Jacobs.”</p>
<p>Jaq smirked. “You're such a teacher’s pet.”</p>
<p>“I am not or least not as big as Atticus is.”</p>
<p>The raven-haired boy stuck his tongue out at her playfully.</p>
<p>“I swear you two will probably end up dating.”</p>
<p>Atticus and Marnie looked disgusted at the thought. They were best friends and study partners. She sat down in the nearest chair. The only Gryffindor girls Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnett walked in, followed by the most notorious pranksters in school, the Weasley twins, and Lee Jordan. The two redheads sat together and Lee seated himself to next to Marnie.</p>
<p>“Nice to see you, Jacobs,” he smiled at her.</p>
<p>She smiled back at him.</p>
<p>“You don't need to call me by my last name, Jordan. We've known each other for four years.”</p>
<p>Before the dreadlocked boy could respond the lesson started and as usual Lee stared at Angelina all lesson.</p>
<p>After, they had Potions with the Hufflepuffs. She had always had an affinity for potions; Marnie believed it was due to the fact that her mum was a barmaid and her dad was a Potioneer. Despite this, she couldn't get along with Professor Snape no matter how much she had tried.</p>
<p>She was paired with Dana Ward, a medium height ginger with steel blue eyes. She wasn't exactly the friendliest girl in school, she was exactly the opposite of the Hufflepuff stereotype. Not soon enough in their opinion came the time for lunch. The group of Ravenclaws walked towards the Great Hall and sat down at the Ravenclaw table, chatting together.</p>
