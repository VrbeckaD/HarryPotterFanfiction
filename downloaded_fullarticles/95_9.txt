    <p>Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Hermoine Granger. This is my story of how I fell in love with my potions professor in my 7th year.<br/>
<br/>
I've always had a crush on my professor since 5th year. My professor, Professor Snape was a very angry and hardcore man but I knew deep down was a caring man who had trust issues let alone someone who never loved him or shown him, love. I knew he was a loveable man and I was going to show him one way or the other. I had a feeling the reason was that he grew up with an abusive father who never shown love to him. Which cause him to leave and join him who must not be name aka Lord Voldemort as a Death Eater because it was his only way out.<br/>
<br/>
This was my 7th and final year. I was sitting in his classroom during potions just daydreaming about him and all the fantasies I had of him. See the thing is I always had feelings since the 5th year. Now we are in our 7th year. Is it wrong to be in love with your professor yet alone in a relationship with a teacher and yet alone think of him in a wrong way? See in the wizarding world you have to be 17 years old but in the muggle world, you have to be 18. I knew we were ok and I was getting to graduated anyway. Still daydreaming when I was startled by his voice which knocked mine out of my thoughts. "Miss Granger," he said in a low growl. "Please see me after class" "also that will be 10 points off from Gryffindor," he said. I could only wonder why he wanted to see me. Yet alone I was just daydreaming in his class again maybe that was it. But I couldn't help it. My friends Ron and Harry also both looking at me and then turning back to go back to work on their work until class was over. I told them that I would catch up with them later. After everyone left Snape called for me. "Professor," I said. He responded with "Miss Granger, I'm disappointed in you. What was so important that you needed to be off track daydreaming and not paying attention in my class. You will have detention with me after dinner tonight and I will discuss your punishment than" he said. Hermione was speechless and shocked her mind once again spaced as to find out her dreams of being alone with the professor she said to herself.<br/>
<br/>
She started to feel her stomach start to do butterflies and also getting wet. Hermione said her goodbyes to the professor before leaving and heading to her next class before heading to lunch with her friends Ron and Harry in the Great Hall. She met Ron and Harry and all three of them sat down for lunch. "Oi," said Ron "What happens after class with you and the greasy bat professor. Hermoine looked at Ron and Harry and said "Professor gave me detention after dinner" she said. They finished lunch and headed back to their next class before their free period and then dinner. The class had finished and it was now free time. Hermione's mind was reeling with the thought of being with the professor alone. She hung out with Ron and Harry and they continue to talk about random things and the school year or their next adventure. Hermione was hurt and knew he was an amazing man and kept it to himself. She wanted to also see if he would make love to her.</p>
