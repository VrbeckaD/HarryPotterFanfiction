    <p>AN: I do not own Harry Potter or the canon characters and world created by J.K. Rowling or Warner Bros. I only own this story and any Original Characters that appear within. </p><p>	Ginny awoke with a start the dimly light chamber was unfamiliar to her. The voice calling out to her was familiar and she felt a deep sense of dread as she turned to look at Harry, her eyes peering past him to the giant body of the dead snake nearby. She felt panic and fear settle in immediately as she quickly remembered all of the events of the past year. </p><p>	“H-Harry.” She said her voice filled with guilt and a mixture of other emotions. “It was me.” She said as she realized she had to confess now and allow the true horror to be known. “Riddle made me do it.”</p><p>	Harry smiled kindly down at her through the pain etched into his face. “You're okay Ginny.” He said with gritted teeth. “He's gone, he won't be able to hurt you or anyone again.”</p><p>	She blinked unsure how to respond. “But the diary.” She said quietly, looking about for the book until she noticed it several feet away. The small black leather book was smoking and a large hole now rested in the center of the book as though something large and sharp had been forced through the book from cover to cover. </p><p>	“It's destroyed.” Harry said with heavy breaths and she now saw that he was holding his arm and struggling with his own body as if he had been poisoned. “I destroyed it Ginny. But the basilisk bit me before I could finish off Tom.”</p><p>	She registered his words and as their meaning clicked into place she cried out. “No, Harry!” She felt as if everything were still just a bad dream until a loud screech filled the room and a brilliant red phoenix alighted between them on the ground. She was amazed at the beauty of the bird. </p><p>	“You were brilliant Fawkes.” Harry said as he gritted his teeth at the pain from the venom coursing through his body. “I just wasn't quick enough.” He continued as the bird watched him, looking down at his arm with fascination. </p><p>	Together they watched as the bird cocked its head and, as if sensing the great sadness between them, tears began to form in its orange eyes. The tears fell from the birds head and landed lightly upon the cut that Harry had acquired on his forearm and as they landed a faint smoke came from the wound. She watched and let out a little gasp of surprise when suddenly the injury began to heal, the skin itself closing back up as if he had never been cut. </p><p>	“Harry?” She asked as she noticed him looking from the bird to his arm with astonishment. It took her a moment to realize that he was no longer breathing heavily, grunting from the pain of the injury and of the poison. </p><p>	“Of course.” Harry said softly as he gently reached out to pet the bird. “Phoenix tears have healing powers.” He continued was he thanked the bird for its kindness in providing the antidote to the poison and healing his injured arm. </p><p>	Harry rose and held out a hand to help her to her feet. She was relieved that he was safe and sound again, but now she could feel her anxiety and fear welling up for another reason. Now she would have to face the severity of her situation, once they returned to the school she would most likely be expelled and sent to prison for the crimes she had unknowingly and unwillingly committed. </p><p>	She watched as he retrieved the diary and shook the gore and water from it with a look of disgust and curiosity. She averted her eyes no longer able to look at the thing that had caused so much misery. Finally she looked up again to see that he was watching her with an expression of kindness. </p><p>	“Come on, lets get out of here.” He said as he gently took her hand in his own and pulled her toward the entrance to the chamber. “Ron and Professor Lockheart are waiting for us in the tunnel ahead.” </p><p>	She allowed him to lead her back through the chamber and out into the dark tunnel, but it was like being lead to prison. She felt defeated and weak, she just knew it was all over for her. No matter what she could say or do once she was back she would be taken, her wand snapped and most likely within the next few days she would be in a cell in Azkaban.</p><p>	They followed the sloping tunnel for a long while until the reaching a point where the roof of the tunnel had collapsed. She could hear the distant sounds of someone on the other side working to clear the rubble for them to get back through. She knew that Ron and Lockheart were on the other side but was not surprised when Harry confirmed this and proceeded to climb up to a point at the top where a small hole had been cleared away and stuck his head through. </p><p>	“I have her Ron, she's safe.” He called out to the space beyond. “Is there enough room for us to get through?”</p><p>	A few moments passed and then the faint sound of her brother's voice came back through the hole. “Yeah, send Ginny through first and then we'll help pull you out.”</p><p>	She climbed up beside Harry and with his and Ron's help she managed to slip through the hole and down the other side of the rock pile. She looked about and was somewhat surprised at the looking darkness before her, the tunnel was far longer than she had expected. She looked about and noticed Professor Lockheart nearby sitting against the wall. </p><p>	“Come on Harry.” Ron called as he helped to pull him through the hole. She could hear rocks on both sides of the hole sliding as they were dislodged but she knew that he would manage to make it through the hole. </p><p>	She went to sit beside the Professor and as she settled in she noticed that he was not acting as his normal self. She watched as he picked up one of the rocks that lay near him and was astounded when he asked Ron a question that made no sense. </p><p>	“What's wrong with Professor Lockheart?” She asked as he threw the rock away and tottered backward away from it as if it were a poisonous snake or something more foul. </p><p>	“He tried to attack us.” Ron said as Harry slipped down the rock pile and came to stand beside them. </p><p>	“He tried to erase our memories so that he could run away.” Harry said, disgust and anger crossing what she could see of his face. </p><p>	She was shocked to hear that a teacher had tried to attack them. She nodded to show that she had heard and then proceeded to look back down at the ground in her shame and guilt. The knowledge of that she had helped even remotely in the attacked and other events this past year weighed heavily on her conscious. </p><p>	“Let's get out of here.” Harry said as the phoenix soared through the hole behind them and hovered in the air before them. </p><p>	They followed the tunnel back the path before them illuminated by the brilliant glow of the phoenix which continued on before them, leading them back toward the entrance. As they rounded a corner the stone slide that served as the only way in or out of the tunnel came into view ahead, one look told them that they would be unable to climb back out. </p><p>	“Well how are we going to get out of here?” Ron asked as he turned to look at her and Harry.</p><p>	Neither she nor he seemed to have even the faintest idea of how they were going to find a way to climb out. Suddenly Fawkes hovered in front of Harry with his tail feathers seemingly extended out toward him. Harry looked the bird over and she was startled when the bird looked back at him with a look of expectation. She had never seen an animal who could almost talk with the way it was staring at them. </p><p>	“I think he wants us to grab hold of his tail feathers.” She said as she continued to watch. </p><p>	Harry reached out and gently grasped the feathers of the phoenix's tail and exclaimed as suddenly he was lifted slightly from the floor as the bird rose a few inches higher. He quickly told them to grab hold of each other and make a line each holding the others hands. Once they had done as he asked she was surprised to find that she felt weightless and was even more surprised when Fawkes flew up through the long chute of the slide and nearly ten minutes later they were standing in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. </p><p>	“Whoa!” Ron said as the bird deposited them onto the floor and flew off through the bathroom doors. “Why didn't you say something about owning a Phoenix Harry?”</p><p>	Harry grinned as he shook his head. “Fawkes isn't mine, he belongs to Dumbledore.”</p><p>	They left the bathroom and headed toward McGonagall's office to let her know what had happened. With Dumbledore sacked she wondered if he was back since his pet bird had helped them. It was with a great sense of fear and sadness that she followed them along, it seemed to her like she were walking to the gallows and her body felt as if it were made of stone as she dragged herself along. </p><p>	When they reached the door they could hear voices inside the office. The distinct sounds of Mrs. Weasley crying and Mr. Weasley trying to comfort her mingled with the voices of Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore. Harry quickly strode forward and knocked upon which the voices inside ceased as the door swung open. </p><p>	“GINNY!” Shrieked her mother as she looked up to see her, tears stained her cheeks and her eyes were red and puffy. </p><p>	Her father rose and came to the door to pull her into an embrace, one she figured was probably the last he would ever give to his daughter before he learned what she had done. She wondered how her parents would react to having a criminal for a daughter and she broke down into sobs as her father pulled her into the office and the others followed them in.</p><p>	“Explain yourselves immediately.” Cried Professor McGonagall as she took in the sight of Harry and Ron. “Out of your dormitories this late, you had better have a good explanation about all of this.”</p><p>	Ginny was startled by the outburst but it was nothing compared to the feelings that coursed through her at the sound of Dumbledore's voice as he revealed himself from the chair he had been sitting at. She didn't know if she should hand over her wand to him now or wait until the Aurors arrived to take her away. </p><p>	“Calm down Minerva, I am sure everything can be explained.” Dumbledore said calmly as he looked each of them over and waited. </p><p>	Harry began talking about how he had hearing the voices back when the attacks first started. He told of how he and Ron had learned a great deal of the situation and how they, and Hermione, had searched for clues and learned of Hagrid's innocence. He laid everything that he, Hermion and Ron had done as well as Hermione's discovery that the creature was a basilisk. </p><p>	She waited and waited for him to reveal all of her part, but when Harry began to describe the diary and how it worked he barely spoke about her at all. He did say that she had originally had the diary, but that he believed that someone else had given it to her through subterfuge as a means to wreak chaos at the school. She was relieved and astounded when he didn't reveal that it was her who had released the snake and written the messages.</p><p>	At length he did reveal that the diary had managed to possess her and she had unwillingly and unknowingly done various parts of its bidding, but that she had been unaware of her acts. It was true she had many spaces of time over the last year that she didn't remember, times she had found herself somewhere in the castle with no memory of how she had gotten there. </p><p>	When Harry finally finished she knew he had revealed enough to implicate that she had been an unwitting victim of the diary. Dumbledore stared at her with kindness in his eyes and she was unsure what would be her verdict. He questioned he had listened without interruption but now he sighed. </p><p>	“Miss Weasley.” He said with a frown. “Do you remember exactly when you discovered the diary in your possession?”</p><p>	“I remember discovering it in with my books when I arrived at the castle.” She said, thinking back to her first time seeing the book. “When I first saw it and noticed that it was a diary belonging to Tom Riddle, Jr. I was somewhat confused.” She continued with a frown. “I knew my books were secondhand but I was unsure why a diary was there, perhaps my parents had thought that maybe it would be a good way for me to sort my thoughts.”</p><p>	She thought for a few moments trying to pull all of her memories together again. “At first I expected to find the book full of the thoughts and memories of Tom Riddle, but when I opened it the book was blank.” She said as she saw the diary whole again, thumbing through the pages to see nothing there. “I was somewhat surprised, but I figured that he must have never written in it.” She continued with a frown as she remembered what began to happen next.</p><p>	“I set the diary aside for a while thinking that maybe I would use it later.” She looked at the book as it lay on the desk in front of them. “I did eventually decide to use it a few weeks into the school year, I was having a hard time and wanted a private place to put my thoughts.” She continued with a sigh. “When I began to write I watched as the first sentence I wrote suddenly disappeared, it seemed to sink into the pages of the diary, but they were still blank and white.”</p><p>	She felt herself shiver as she thought of what she was about to say next. “Words appeared on the page written by a different person, the writing tidy and clear.” She said as she began to reveal how Tom had spoken to her, backing up what Harry had said about it speaking with him. “I was started when suddenly there on the page was a question, “My name is Tom Riddle, who are you?”” </p><p>	She continued to reveal how she and Riddle had begun to talk, how she brought to him her problems and he gave her advice on how to handle them. It had been like finding a new best friend, one she didn't have to share or worry if he would leave her. When she began to talk about how suddenly there were moments when she would find herself somewhere with no memory of how she got there she stated that it must have been at that point that Tom was possessing her. </p><p>	“Why didn't you try to speak to someone Miss Weasley?” Asked Professor McGonagall with a frown. </p><p>	“I was afraid that if I came to someone to discuss the diary and everything that I would get in trouble.” She said quietly. “I did eventually try a month ago to tell Percy but he brushed me away without even giving me a chance to say anything.”</p><p>	Finally as she finished and Dumbledore sat quietly for a long while as everyone seemed to wait. Finally he nodded as he picked up the book and looked it over before doing the same with the sword. He seemed to be thinking about everything and at last he finally gave a nod. </p><p>	“You do of course realize Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley that you have broken more than fifty school rules tonight.” He said at last as he looked them over. “Under normal circumstances this would be grounds for expulsion. However, due to recent events the both of you will receive awards for special services to the school.” He continued with a smile. </p><p>	Harry seemed somewhat shocked and she could tell Ron was startled, but she was happy for them. They had done a lot for the school in tracking down the culprit and defeating Tom and the basilisk. She wondered what would happen to her now though, she was still unsure if she would be expelled or not. </p><p>	“I knew Tom Riddle when he was a student here at the castle. He was a handsome and eloquent young man, many admired him.” Dumbledore said as he sighed. “He held a great amount of charisma and charm and used it well.” He continued with a frown. “I was one of the few he never could charm the way he did so many others.”</p><p>	Dumbledore paused for a few moments as if lost in his own memories. “Today Tom Riddle, Jr. is no longer the man he once was and his name is not one many would recognize, those who would would not react well to hearing it.” He said at length with a sigh. “Today he is known by a different name, Lord Voldemort. It is no wonder that he was able to lure Miss Weasley in and over time he used the connection he made with her through the diary to possess and use her to his own ends.” </p><p>	She flinched at the mention of You-Know-Who and heard her mother and Professor McGonagall gasp. “For her part in the events that have transpired this year Miss Weasley is innocent and will not be punished.” Dumbledore said as he gave her a soft, sad smile. “Many witches and wizards far older and more experienced than her have fallen pray to Voldemort, and many of them did not fare so well in the end.” He continued with a sad sigh. “I see no point in punishing her, but I do hope that this will be a lesson to be more cautious in the future.”</p><p>	She was relieved at this and knew that she would never forget the things that had happened. She had been certain she was going to be expelled but now she knew that she had barely escaped due to her own inexperience as well as her innocence and it was a relief. She felt her mother pull her into an embrace and she allowed herself to be guided to the Hospital Wing where she could be examined and as Professor Dumbledore insisted she would be given a sleeping potion to help her sleep without the nightmares she would otherwise surely have had.</p>
