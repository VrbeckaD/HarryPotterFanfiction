    <p>Remus would not have known that she had entered his compartment if her trunk did not crash to the floor after she tried to lift it. He startled in his seat and looked up from the book he was reading to see her standing in front of him, her eyes on her trunk. She stared at it for a while before she tried to lift it up again. Remus watched her sway and he quickly moved out of his seat when he saw her dangerously teeter to the side.</p><p>"I'm sorry I did not offer my help earlier," Remus said as he helped her lift her trunk up.</p><p>When the trunk was safely tucked away, Remus turned to face the girl and was surprised to see that she was already looking at him. They stood nearly at the same height and Remus could not help but stare at her eyes – her pupils were nearly black and her lashes were long like that of a calf (it did not feel right to say she had cow eyes, even if it was a compliment).</p><p>"Thank you," the girl said, her gaze unwavering. It sort of unnerved Remus but he kept a polite smile on his lips. He did not want to make a bad first impression.</p><p>"It's no problem," Remus replied, taking a seat. He tucked his book away and looked out the compartment's window.</p><p>It was his first year in Hogwarts and he was excited. Well, excited and nervous. He's never been away from home before and he hoped that the year would go by smoothly despite his... bad nights. Dumbledore had promised him and his parents that arrangements have been made for him but he still worried. If anyone were to find out... he did not want to think about it.</p><p>Remus glanced over to the girl and saw that she had settled down in the seat across him. She sat with her back straight, her hands on her knees and she was looking out the compartment's door. It looked like she was watching the other Hogwarts students pass by and Remus wondered if she knew anybody else on the train or if she was alone.</p><p>It was then that Remus realized that he had not introduced himself. It had been so long since he had told someone his name. Besides his parents, Remus had little to no contact with anyone else after the accident. He was pretty sure that the only people who knew his name were the healers his parents brought him to.</p><p>He should have said something before he sat down – something simple like "I'm Remus, by the way" or maybe he could be cool and casual and go "The name's Remus. Remus Lupin." The latter made him cringe in his seat and he chastised himself for thinking he could that off.</p><p>"Did you happen to see a boy with black hair and grey eyes pass by?" The girl's voice brought Remus out of his thoughts. Remus' eyes widened when he realized that he was staring and his cheeks warmed. She probably noticed but was polite enough to not say anything about it.</p><p>"I can't say that I have," Remus said apologetically. "Is he a friend?"</p><p>"Something like that." The girl said mysteriously. "I'm Tabitha, by the way. Tabitha Faolan."</p><p>"Remus." He said a little to quickly, glad that she had introduced herself first. "Lupin." He added as an after thought.</p><p>Tabitha had a thoughtful look on her face for a moment before saying, "Wolf."</p><p>Remus felt his heart drop to his stomach.</p><p>This could not be happening. He was not even at Hogwarts yet and his deepest, darkest secret was already discovered. Why did he think that he could even hide it? He had no right to go to Hogwarts. He was a danger to himself and to others. He–</p><p>"Your name is from the story of Remus and Romulus, isn't it? The boys who were raised by wolves? And your last name means wolf." Tabitha said and to Remus surprise (or rather, to add to his surprise), she smiled. "It's a little funny, isn't it?"</p><p>"Yeah," Remus said, hoping his unease was not evident in his voice. "It is."</p>
