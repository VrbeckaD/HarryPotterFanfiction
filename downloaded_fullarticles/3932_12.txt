    <p>"Pup, you going to come down to the Great Hall for dinner?" Sirius asked from the doorway, looking at his son. Harry had been pushing himself further and further since the outbreak. Harry honestly saved them all. He was so powerful that he was able to put up wards all over the magical communities all over the world. It took a lot out of him for a few days afterwards so Sirius and Remus began to charge the communities a large fee for him to do that. His son didn't like that, though, but Sirius and Remus didn't care. They wanted him to have money once this was taken care of. His pup was now a very wealthy man and he would only grow richer. Not that it mattered right now, but still. </p><p>   Harry glanced up from his book and smiled at his papa. "Not right now, I'll have Dobby bring me something in a little bit." He said then returned to his book once his father left. </p><p>   Once he got what he needed from the book, he sighed and turned to a box that was setting in the chair by the fireplace. He finally figured it out. He finally knew how to make necklaces that he would infuse his magic into and it would keep the bitters away from them. It's taken him over two weeks to figure it out and now that he has, he could save many more people. He had a different spell for each necklace. He had ones for muggles only, a spell for magical creatures and a spell for witches and wizards. </p><p>   Harry took a deep breath and laid out necklaces on the floor. Some of them were girly and some of them were masculine and some were in between. He wanted to give people options. He gave a quick count and grinned to himself. He could do this. He could help save so many people. Muggle and magic. He had 600 necklaces in front of him and in the other boxes, he had hundreds of thousands more. He already did as much as he could for the magical world, setting up wards all over the world to keep the bitters out. With friends and family, he warded their homes for free. He didn't want them to have to leave their homes. Hell, he even went and changed all of the wards on the Potter Estates and all of the Black properties. He wanted to keep the elves safe and protected as well.  </p><p>   Shaking himself out of his thoughts, he put his wand down and held his hands out and began to softly speak. He closed his eyes and really began to chant, he poured every ounce of himself into what he was doing. Once he was done with those 600 necklaces, he moved onto the next batch. He wanted to get the magical community done first before he moved to the muggle community. He would eventually have to make millions but he would only be able to do that in the next few months. Something in him told him that he needed to head to America after his inheritance. He didn't know why, though, but he knew that he needed to. He was so caught up in his spell work that he didn't even hear anyone come in and he certainly didn't notice that blood was pouring out of his nose. </p><p>   "Cub!" "Pup!" Twin hollers broke Harry out of his trance like state.</p><p>   Remus rushed over to his son and grabbed the bottom of his shirt and shoved it against Harry's nose and tried to stop the bleeding. "You're okay, you're okay." Remus repeated over and over as he tried to stop the bleeding. He noticed that Sirius left and knew that he went to go and grab Madam Pomfrey. </p><p>   Harry gasped quietly, becoming more aware of what was happening. He coughed and tried to pull away from Remus but his dad kept a strong hold on him. "Daddy's sorry, baby, so sorry. Madam Pomfrey is coming, papa went to get her." Remus murmured and pulled a slumped over Harry closer while still holding onto his nose. </p><p>   Sirius and Madam Pomfrey came rushing into the room with a worried Severus Snape following closely behind with his potions case. Madam Pomfrey rushed over to Harry and took over for Remus and began to help the poor boys bleeding nose while Severus handed her a blood replenishment potion. She gave it to Harry and helped him get it down while she controlled the bleeding. </p><p>   Feeling a little woozy, Harry looked over at his fathers then glanced at his uncle. He tried to take in everyone's appearance but was having a lot of trouble doing so. His fathers were looking rather worried. His papa Sirius was holding onto his dad Remus' arm while his uncle Severus looked blank faced but Harry knew better. His uncle was very worried, all you had to do was look into his eyes to see everything: his concern and his worry,  all of his fear for his nephew. He didn't even notice Madam Pomfrey talking to him. </p><p>   "What on earth do you think that you were doing, Mr. Potter?" She scolded. When she noticed him not responding, she turned his head so that he was looking at her. "Harry, Harry, look at me." She said and grabbed her wand and cleaned him up. </p><p>   Harry shook his head slightly and cleared his mind of the fog that started to settle in. "Uhh.. Well, I finally came up with a way to protect people. Muggles and magic folks alike." He said sheepishly. </p><p>   Severus raised an eyebrow and looked at his nephew. "Pray tell, Mr. Potter-Black, what have you come up with? You've just drained yourself to the point where you started bleeding profusely. Nose bleeds are very dangerous."</p><p>  "Yes, pup, please explain this to us. And what is up with all of these necklaces?" Sirius asked and came over to the couch and sat down. He smiled slightly when Remus sat down beside him and took his hand. </p><p>   Harry shrugged and leaned back into the couch before he took a deep breath and started to explain. "Okay, so I've been trying to figure out how to keep people safe, everyone. People in the magical community, werewolves, vampires, witches and wizards and whomever else isn't safe from these things. Also muggles. Especially muggles. At least we have magic, we have our wands to protect us and we have wards to keep them out. They don't. So I've been reading anything I could get my hands on, from the Potter and Black libraries. And I've finally found it. Ive just done several thousand necklaces for us and several thousand for the muggles." He looked at his family and bit his bottom lip before sighing. "Papa, dad, uncle Sev... after this.. I'm going to America. I don't know where yet but I am going. Something is telling me that I need to go." Harry looked at his fathers and scooted closer to them. "I also made this box. Two of them. They can hold very small items and they can hold large items. I runed them so if I need anything, you can give it to me that way. I'll be taking food and water and stuff like that, along with potions and salves with me but just in case I run out, I can get more." </p><p>   It was Remus who spoke first. "Well, cub. You're bloody amazing. I cannot believe how powerful you are. You're just as powerful as Merlin right now and when you come into your inheritance at midnight, you're going to be 10 times more powerful than him. I don't even think that he could do what you've already done." He said  and stared at his son in amazement. He couldn't believe that this wonderful and sweet and loving and extremely powerful boy was their son. Sure, him and Sirius didn't make him and carry him for 9 months but he was still theirs. They've raised him for the past 5 years. </p><p>   Sirius reached over and pulled his pup into his arms and hugged him tightly. "We love you. We support you. We may not like it but we support you. I know that Severus will brew whatever you need  and we will collect all the potions that we can find so that you can go. I'll get out the multiple compartment trunks so you can take many with you and shrink them. We want you to always be prepared. We will also get you weapons, such as guns and swords and any kind of knives. You will be prepared for anything and everything that comes your way."</p><p>   Severus just looked at them all and took in the situation. His nephew had done something simply amazing. Bloody hell, the boy was going to be the most powerful wizard in existence. Generations of magic and possibly muggles will know what he's done. People all over the world will know the name Harry Potter-Black and it won't be because he was The-Boy-Who-Lived. He will be known for being more powerful than Merlin and for saving the human race, both magical and muggle. </p><p>   "Uncle Sev?" Harry called out softly and glanced at his uncle, worried to look at him directly. </p><p>   "You foolish boy, of course I support you and will do anything and everything to help you. I'm not too sure why you're going to America, though." Severus said and raised an eyebrow when his arms became full of Harry. </p><p>   Harry buried his face into his uncles chest and inhaled deeply, trying to calm himself down a little bit. He really hated being a lot shorter than everyone else. At 5'4, he always had to look up at people and he will always have to. He hated it but what could he do? "Thank you." He mumbled then pulled away before he grabbed a necklace and put it on Severus' neck and spelled it on, making sure that no one but himself and the person wearing it could take it off. He didn't want any accents or people doing something awful. He grabbed three more and put them on his parents and Madam Pomfrey before she left. Then he spelled one onto himself. </p><p>   "There, we are all set. Now I just need to get everyone here at school." Harry said and sat back down. He quickly checked the clock, it was almost 11 at night. Just one more hour to go before he would get his big power boost. Suddenly, he looked up and looked at his family. "Will it hurt?" He asked quietly. He knew that it would hurt at least a little bit, he could handle pain, but he was nervous as to how much pain he would be in. </p><p>   "Not gonna lie to you, pup. It's going to hurt a lot, especially with how much power you'll be getting. We'll be there, though. Nothing is gonna happen. It'll be over quickly." Sirius said and wrapped an arm around Harry's shoulder and brought him close and gave him a big hug. </p><p>   Harry just closed his eyes and nodded. </p><p> </p><p>**************************************************************************</p><p> </p><p>   Harry was laying in the middle of his parents bed and his heart was racing. They had about five more minutes before midnight and he was scared out of his mind. He didn't know what was going to happen. Well, he knew, he just didn't know how painful it was going to be and it worried him. Everyone was there. His parents, his uncle Severus, Ron, Hermione, the Weasley's, several Griffindors, several Ravenclaws, a few Hufflepuffs, and even a few Slitherins. Most of the teachers were there and even the head mistress. It made his heart warm a bit, knowing that people cared. </p><p>   Harry heart the clock ding and he knew it was coming. He looked at his parents and uncle and gave them a soft smile before saying, "I love you." To them. </p><p> 10</p><p>Ding</p><p>9</p><p>Ding</p><p>8</p><p>Ding</p><p>7</p><p>Ding </p><p>6</p><p>Ding</p><p>5</p><p>Ding</p><p>4</p><p>Ding</p><p>3</p><p>Ding</p><p>2</p><p>Ding</p><p>1</p><p>Midnight. </p><p>   Harry's head tossed back and he let out a blood curdling scream. He writhed around on the bed, tossing and turning, his body seizing up every so often. </p><p>   Remus, Sirius, and Severus stood around the room, just waiting for it to be over with. There wasn't anything anyone could do. They could only wait it out. After about 20 minutes, Harry finally stopped screaming and was able able to relax his body. Severus rushed forward and quickly ran a diagnostic exam, making sure that Harry was okay and nothing happened during his inheritance. He sighed in relief when everything came back okay.  He checked Harry's core to see how much he inherited. To say that Severus was shocked was putting it lightly. </p><p>   "Well? How is he?" Sirius asked and walked over to his son's side and ran his fingers through Harry's thick, soft hair. </p><p>   "He's fine. He will probably be sleeping for the next 24 to 48 hours. I checked his core. And to say that he got a large power boost is to say the least. His power it-it's bloody insane. This will be talked about until the end of time. I cant believe that he is still breathing with how much his body just went through. That's why he's going to be sleeping for so long. Plus, that should have only lasted, at most, 5 minutes. Not the 20 that it did. Just let him rest." Severus said and pinched the bridge of his nose, fatigue finally settling in. </p><p>   "Severus, go take the guest room. We'll know if he wakes up. " Remus said and walked over to the bed and pressed his lips against Harry's forehead. "Love you, cub." He murmured as Sirius did the same. He took his husband's hand and walked to their bedroom, hopeful for a quiet night.</p>
