    <p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“Padfoot’s been a long time, hasn’t he?”</p><p>James tosses his wand aside and catches Carlos just in time. Tesla slinks away to hop up onto Peter’s bed, sulky. “Oh, yeah. Where d’you reckon he’s got to?”</p><p>“Who knows.”</p><p>James stands. “Best go see what he’s up to now, rather than fish him out of the hospital wing come dawn.”</p><p>“Take the Cloak,” Peter suggests. “It’s after curfew.”</p><p>“Nah, I’ll just be a minute.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Give it a rest, I can dodge Filch in my sleep. See you.”</p><p>“Yeah…”</p><p>As luck would have it, James has barely got past the portrait of the Fat Lady when he sees Sirius coming his way from the other end of the corridor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oy, Black! Took your sweet time, didn’t you? We thought you finally fell in the lake and died, we were planning a party and everything.”</p><p>James first realises something odd’s going on when Sirius doesn’t spar back. He runs down the dark corridor and meets him halfway. Before he can get a word out, there’s a crack of lightning like a car engine backfiring. He jumps and yelps (it was a yelp, he’s man enough to admit it), but Sirius just gives a lazy sort of grin.</p><p>“Lovely night, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yeah, peachy,” James says. “What’s wrong with you?”</p><p>“Dunno what you mean.”</p><p>“You just seem off.” The two of them make their way toward the Fat Lady. “Where were you, anyway?”</p><p>“Fancied a stroll.”</p><p>“Was it a prank? You know it hurts my feelings when you do pranks without me, it’s like you’re cheating on me.”</p><p>He was just giving Sirius shit again, he doesn’t expect the answer to be anything other than a ‘shove it, Potter’ before they move on. But Sirius turns to look at him with that big smug grin, shakes back his hair, and says, “Maybe.”</p><p>“We hadn’t anything planned— what’d you do?”</p><p>The easeful hang of Sirius’ shoulders and the lazy tilt to his smile tighten as James watches and suddenly Sirius is in one of his frenetic moods, the ones where he laughs a lot and is more prone to breaking stuff and seems to conduct static electricity, that weird gleam in his eyes he only gets once in a blue moon, and yeah, something’s wrong. James knows Sirius’ moods better than anybody on the planet, maybe tied with Regulus, and they don’t swing <em>this </em>fast.</p><p>“I made all of our lives easier, that’s what I did. The mother of all pranks, Prongsy.”</p><p>“What? Should’ve let me in on it, if it was so great.”</p><p>“Couldn’t’ve. Had to seize the moment.” He gives a weird, breathy laugh. James feels…uneasy. “All our problems? Everything that could screw up our plans, get us in trouble? <em>Gone</em>.” His eyes have got that weird gleam, a <em>lot </em>of it.</p><p>Unease has left the building, time for full-fledged alarm.</p><p>“Mate, you don’t look right.”</p><p>“Don’t I?” There’s another crack of lightning and Sirius rocks back onto his heel, gives a bark of laughter to the ceiling. “Couldn’t have asked for better weather!”</p><p>Alarm. Yep, alarm. “What did you do?”</p><p>“I got rid of Snape.”</p><p>James blinks. “Explain exactly what you mean,” he says slowly.</p><p>Sirius seems to exude static electricity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re gonna love this, you’ll appreciate the genius of it. Because— cause— alright, hang on, let’s make one thing <em>perfectly </em>clear,” he says on a shaky exhale, “I didn’t kill anybody. I’ve been walking around the castle working out the options, and in none of them does anybody die. Option one: nothing happens besides Snivelly gets a good scare. Option two: Moony bites him. Hilarious, just deserts, learns not to be a hateful prick, the whole nine. Maybe he’d even <em>leave school</em>, don’t think he’d bear to show his ugly face around once all his little Death Eater pals figure out what he is, would he? Or he’d just have to go find his own ramshackle house to transform in once a month because I am not about to force Moony into sharing with that grease stain, nor are <em>we </em>going to share once we get the Animagus stuff worked out, but anyway, alright. Option three: Moony doesn’t quite manage a <em>bite </em>but he does fuck him up pretty bad. Apparently that happens sometimes, the person gets the werewolf to fuck off before they actually manage to, y’know, fully sink their teeth in, but they still get pretty badly injured. So Snape gets nice and mangled, and maybe he’ll get so mangled he has to leave school! A bloke can dream, right?</p><p>“But, anyway, what all three of these options have in common is that we give that nosey, meddling bastard a good scare, and then he stops messing with us and sneaking round and spying on us and our lives are a <em>lot </em>easier.”</p><p>There’s a roll of thunder but James barely hears it. He isn’t hearing so great. He shakes like he’s sweating out a fever, with that same sensation that everything inside of you is too hot and everything outside of you is far away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Snape is going to the Shack?”</p><p>“Yeah, s’what I’ve just told you, keep up.”</p><p>“What did you tell him?”</p><p>“Okay, well, it started with him trying to be all tough, and he said ‘If you—’”</p><p>“Sirius,” James says. “Tell me what you told him.”</p><p>“I said to wait thirty minutes and then to poke the knot with a stick and follow the tunnel, alright? What’s at the end,” Sirius says cheerfully, “I left a surprise.”</p><p>“Thirty— how long ago was this?”</p><p>“Er…” Sirius checks his watch. “About forty five minutes ago.”</p><p>There’s a half second in which James is one hundred percent certain that he’s going to be sick. He spends that half second frantically scanning the corridor for a convenient vase or something, but then he decides that there’s no time for vomiting and magically it passes. “Fuck,” he says.</p><p>Then he runs.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Peter sits on his bed, petting Tesla and absorbed in his Arithmancy textbook, when the door slams open. Sirius goes to the window, looks out at the storm. “Lovely night.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Something’s wrong. It came storming in with Sirius, and Peter knows— in the way he sometimes just <em>knows </em>things— that something bad has happened, something really bad, but it takes a bit for him to work up the courage to say, in a small voice, “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Nothing, why?”</p><p>“It just seems like—”</p><p>“It’s nothing.”</p><p>“Where’s Prongs?”</p><p>Even when his back’s turned, Sirius’ voice can still bite. “Leave it, Pete.”</p><p>“I think, er. I think I’ll turn in.”</p><p>“Yeah.” He leaves looking out the window. “Me too.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The two of them change and get into their beds without a word. Sirius shuts off the lights with a flick of his wand, and Peter stares up into the darkness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He wonders where James is.</p><p><em>He can take care of himself, </em>Peter thinks. <em>What’s the worst that could’ve happened? </em>A brief flash of blue-white light is split-second warning before thunder crashes. Tesla meows, uncurling herself from Peter’s side to stalk up and down his bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He isn’t sure how long he lies there in the dark, wide awake, listening to the storm. But right when he’s starting to think that maybe, just maybe he’ll sleep tonight, there’s sound from Sirius’ direction: a creaking bed frame, feet hitting the floor, a few harried footsteps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Peter can’t take it anymore. He climbs out of bed and catches a glimpse of Sirius standing in front of the window and staring out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius whirls around. He’s peculiarly jumpy. “Jesus, I thought you were asleep.”</p><p>“I—I—I just wanna know where James has gone.”</p><p>“None of your business, alright?”</p><p>“Please?” His voice creeps higher, just like he knew it would. “I’m—I’m just getting worried, so if you could tell me I’d—”</p><p>He expects Sirius to explode, he’s prepared for it, but it takes Peter by surprise when Sirius bursts out laughing.</p><p>“Oh, Wormy.” Sirius looks at Peter with a horrible, hysterical sort of grin and declares, “I’ve ruined everything.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>In his fifteen-almost-sixteen years of life, James Potter has regretted many of his actions. Never before, though, has he kicked himself for anything as he in this moment kicks himself for not bringing the bloody Cloak.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Come on, be a lad, would you?” James whispers. “We’re on the same side here! Besides— I’m not even Remus! You don’t hate <em>me</em>, remember?”</p><p>There’s a moment where Peeves looks as though he’s actually considering it, hanging upside down in the air with a thoughtful look on his face. Then he flips over and whizzes away into the darkness, screeching, “STUDENT OUT OF BED! STUDENT IN THE CORRIDOR!”</p><p>“Far out, thanks,” James says, and leaps into a sprint. He’s made it this far, the top of the grand staircase is visible from here, if he can just reach it— with any luck Filch is on the other side of the castle—</p><p>Nope, no luck at all. He hears a familiar wheezing as running footsteps come hurtling around the corner.</p><p>“Oh fuck,” James says with tremendous feeling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“<em>You!</em> Stop right there!”</p><p>“No, no, no, not now!” He runs even faster, ignoring the stitch in his side; the stairs are right there, he’ll get to the front doors if it kills him, he’s <em>got to</em>—</p><p>Some metre and a half shy of the grand staircase, James trips on thin air, stumbles, and falls flat on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>This is why you’re only cool on a broomstick, </em>he thinks.</p><p>“Aha!” James feels a bony hand haul him to his feet. “And just what are you and your rotten friends up to now, eh?” Filch drags James along with an iron grip to his arm. “Dungbombs, destruction? Not this time, not this time!”</p><p>“Listen, tonight’s no good for me,” James says. He fights against Filch’s hold, but the scrawny old bastard’s stronger than he looks. “If we could save this for another time—”</p><p>“Think you’re so clever, running about at night and wreaking havoc— see what Professor McGonagall thinks about this, yes we will!”</p><p>“How about I hang round in the corridor tomorrow night? You can catch me then!” He’s feeling increasingly frantic; Filch pulls him steadily away from the stairs and Merlin knows how far Snape’s already gotten down the tunnel at this point, he’s got to be halfway to the Shack already, oh fuck oh fuck oh <em>fuck</em>. “I won’t run or anything, I’ll take however much detention you like, just <em>please</em> tonight I’ve—”</p><p>“Oho, you’d enjoy that, wouldn’t you! I wasn’t born yesterday, boy!”</p><p>Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck. “Look,” James says, “I really don’t want to do this, but you’re leaving me no choice. Lives are at stake, and—”</p><p>“What I wouldn’t give for the old days, string ’em up by their ankles, that’d serve ’em right, but we’ve gone soft now…oh, but we’ll see what Professor McGonagall has to say, yes—”</p><p>James takes a deep breath, steels himself, says, “I’m sorry about this, I really am,” and kicks Filch in the groin with all his might.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It’s enough; Filch drops like a sack of Bludgers, howling and cursing, and James takes off again. He shouts over his shoulder, “Sorry! Lives at stake!” and hurls himself down the stairs three at a time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The words are hardly out of Sirius’ mouth before he’s taking them back.</p><p>“No, no I didn’t,” he says. He paces the dormitory, stalking like a caged wolf, and stirs Peter’s wandlight with black shadows. “It was a <em>joke!</em> If James wants to go and— it’s none of my business, is it? It was just a prank, and if James wants to risk his own skin for Snivellus then that’s his fault.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A flash of lightning bursts through the room, turning Sirius ghoulishly white, and when it’s dimmed again he’s back at the window, peering out into the rain. “He should be back by now, shouldn’t he?” Sirius asks no one in particular. He crosses to his bedside table to retrieve his watch. He glares at it. “Maybe. I can’t remember. Time is being odd, it keeps moving in fits and stops, I can’t <em>remember</em>—”</p><p>It’s the dumbest question ever, but all Peter manages to get out is: “Did something happen?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius wheels around and Peter jumps. “It serves him right!” Sirius snarls. “Sneaking round like that, like he has been for years, trying to get us chucked out! I did us all a favour! He’s so <em>smug</em>. Thinks he’s so clever but he’s an ugly, sneaking, lying, self-righteous little shit— you would’ve understood, Wormtail, I wish you’d been there. You’d’ve understood that he deserved it!”</p><p>Peter’s trying his best to keep up. He’s becoming increasingly sure that whatever’s happened is time-sensitive and it’s not at all helping the hot fear broiling in his gut. “Snape…Snape was spying?” he says. “On James?”</p><p>“No, no he— wait, yeah, he was! But that wasn’t even— that was a Lily thing, he took offense to how much James is obsessed with her because nobody else likes the greasy git, reckon it makes him possessive. But that’s not what I’m talking about. He was spying on Remus. What, I was just supposed to take that lying down? It’s sort of poetic, isn’t it, since Remus is the one he was messing with in the first place?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius stops pacing. He fixes Peter with his eyes, his voice gone low and cold. “You know, Snivellus had the bollocks to lie to me? Confronted him about Regulus and he fucking denied it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Peter feels a sick lurch of horror. <em>Oh no</em>, he thinks. <em>Please no…</em></p><p>“I don’t regret it!” Sirius announces. “Not a bit! Let James do what he wants! Snivellus tried to wreck my little brother’s life— he deserves whatever he gets!”</p><p>It’s the worst feeling Peter’s ever experienced. Every other burst of terror or guilt or misery he’s ever felt in his life combined can’t hold a candle to this.</p><p><em>Oh please God, </em>he thinks. <em>P</em><em>lease, please, don’t let it be my fault. Whatever it is, don’t let it be my fault.</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> ***</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Of course it's <em>fucking raining!</em>” James shouts.</p><p>His voice echoes over the dark grounds, drowned in the rumble of thunder. He looks up at the vast expanse of black clouds overhead, whirling and expanding like blots of ink dropped into water. The cold slices through him, and the air smells like electricity. <em>This is going to be unpleasant, </em>he thinks. Then he sprints down the sloping lawn, slipping and sliding in the mud, as a bolt of lightning cracks the sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Through the stinging sheets of rain he can just make out the outline of the Willow careening ever closer, black and thrashing against the steely sky, as if it would fight off the storm singlehandedly. James admires its nerve. He reaches it and discovers a new problem.</p><p>"Where the hell is the branch?" he asks the Willow or the storm or the universe. James looks around. The branch— such a lovely, special branch, just long enough to save you getting walloped— is always right here, it <em>always</em> goes back to this spot so the next person who comes along can poke the knot with it and freeze the tree. James paws at the water striping his glasses, wipes them on his sodden front, but the branch is still nowhere in sight. It's not until he squints ahead at the Willow itself that he spots it: it’s propped up against the trunk where, no doubt, Snape left it.</p><p>Fine, he’ll just summon it. He reaches into his pocket for his wand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It's empty.</p><p>“You’re joking.” And then he’s presented with a memory of throwing his wand aside before he left to fetch Sirius and not thinking to pick it up again because he's the biggest bloody idiot to ever walk the earth, oh <em>shit</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The Willow is thrashing away, as short-tempered trees are wont to do, and ready to pound James to pulp if he approaches. The only means of freezing the thing is propped up against the trunk, totally useless. His wand is up in the dormitory, also useless. Snape is no doubt halfway down the tunnel at least by now, mere minutes away from discovering Remus and getting mauled and bringing them all to ruin. James paces in a frantic, muddy circle, waiting for inspiration to strike or perhaps a bolt of lightning to put him out of his misery-- when he trips. Again. This time, though, it isn't over air. It's a rock, roundish and a bit larger than his fist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>“That’s it!”</em>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p><p>Granted, it's not perfect. James looks around: no other rocks to be seen. He’s got one shot. The wind whistles and the rain is blinding, it's dark except for the odd flash of thunder, and the Willow's branches are constant moving obstacles. So, yeah, not the greatest of conditions. Not ideal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>But that's nothing, he reminds himself. He's a Chaser, isn't it he? This is no worse than Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff third year, when there was that dirty great storm and visibility was terrible but still James scored them twelve whole goals against that Hufflepuff Keeper what's-his-name-- this, this is nothing! This rock is a Quaffle, the branches are Hufflepuff what's-his-name, the knot is the goal hoop, and the stakes aren't life-death-and-or-expulsion, just some Quidditch points. He can do it…He's got to do it…He throws.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The rock smacks squarely against the knot and the Willow swings to a halt, frozen. James lets out a celebratory whoop that's lost to the howling wind, sprints forward, and throws himself into the dark dampness of the tunnel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His feeling of victory is short-lived; he forgot how bloody cramped this passageway is. James curses his recent growth spurt, curses his lack of a wand. It's really, really dark in here.</p><p>"Alright," he says to himself. "No problem. Just a pitch-dark, cramped tunnel with your arch nemesis and a werewolf at the end. Keep your wits about you, Potter."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He charges forward.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> ***</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever he gets, I don’t care!” Sirius says. “Fucking mocked me. ‘Pretty’ this, ‘Black’ that! Asked me if me and Remus were an item-- said I was a fruit just because he thinks he’s funny, not because he knows I actually <em>am</em>—” Sirius whirls around to face Peter with a hard, challenging look on his face. “And I <em>am</em>, I’m a fucking fairy, what d’you think about that?”</p><p>There must be a tactful way to respond to that but Peter doesn’t know it, so he says, “I know. I mean, I knew. Already.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius is so visibly stunned that his hysteria falls away. “Did Prongs tell you?”</p><p>“No. I didn’t know he knew.”</p><p>There’s a long stretch of silence. Sirius has got a peculiar look on his face, like he’s trying not to smile. Tesla hops down from Peter’s bed and hides underneath it. The storm rails away outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius exhales a laugh to himself. “I should’ve known. It’s not like you ever managed to trick me, like you did the others. I know you’re more than you let on.”</p><p>This, impressively, might be the most confusing thing Sirius has said tonight. “What?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius steps toward him. “Little Peter from Lancashire, with his maths and his cat. Can’t magic his way out of a paper bag, can’t look a teacher in the eye, all of it, fine. James believes it, but James’ll believe anything.”</p><p>“I…what?”</p><p>“It’s okay, I get it,” Sirius says. “You’re one of the best friends I’ve ever had, of course I get it. James is just too bloody wholesome to understand. He’s never anything but the one person, he’s only ever <em>James </em>and that’s it, but not everybody’s like that. You and me, we’re not like that. We stay in our sheep’s clothing because nobody much likes the wolf when they meet him, do they? James doesn’t get it, but I know you do.”</p><p>“I—I—I d—don’t,” Peter says, and oh Christ the fucking stammer, and he tries to think of something, <em>anything </em>to say to that, to whatever the hell it is Sirius is talking about. “I—I don’t know what this has g—got to do with…with me?”</p><p>And Sirius is back to laughing, pacing. “What’s it got to do with you, a good question, let me—” Then he stops, plants his feet, and explains:</p><p>“Snape was spying in the Entrance Hall and saw Remus leaving with Madam Pomfrey. After I caught him I told him how to get through the Willow and that he ought to follow the passageway to find out where Remus goes. A bit later I told James about all this, and he went off running. To stop it, I suppose. As we speak the two of them are, presumably, duking it out in the tunnel and may or may not face Remus in his full moony form, and how this relates to you is me realising right this moment that it makes no difference whether or not I tell you that this is all happening because I know you, Wormtail, and I know that you won’t do a <em>damn thing </em>to stop it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Peter feels as if he is out of his body, watching himself. “I won’t?”</p><p>“Nah.” Sirius shrugs. “Haven’t got the guts.”</p><p>“But…” Peter says. His voice sounds small. “I thought I was more than I let on? What…what about the…the wolf, and the sheep’s clothing?”</p><p>“See, that’s the thing about your wolf, Peter,” Sirius says, crossing to his own bed. He climbs in and lays down. “It’s got a strong instinct for self-preservation.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>James loses track of time in the tunnel. His back screams in pain and his knees ache, his hands are caked with soil from trying to feel out the walls as he trudges forward, his vision goes funny in the darkness. So funny, in fact, that he swears for a second that he sees a light ahead—</p><p>"OY!" he shouts. "SNIVELLUS! I mean— SNAPE!"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The distant pinprick of light swings around. Far ahead he hears a familiar voice: "Potter?"</p><p>"Thank me later!” he calls. “We've got to go, come on..."</p><p>He crawls closer until he can see the disbelief on Snape's face in the wandlight. He's wearing the expression of one who wishes that the whole tunnel would cave in and smother James to death. "Get lost!"</p><p>"Listen to me,” James says. “You don't know what you're doing, you're in real danger, I know Sirius is the biggest prat alive but you've got to go back!”</p><p>“Oh, sure!” Snape charges ahead again. "It's too late! Black's spilled the beans! I’ll see you lot expelled and that's the end of it!"</p><p>James follows after. “We might very well be getting expelled, I’ll grant you that, but you aren't gonna be around to see it if you keep going!"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"Is that a threat?"</p><p>"No, it's a fact!” James shouts. “I’m trying to save your stupid life, you ungrateful arse!”</p><p>Snape makes a derisive sound and moves faster. There’s nothing else for it: James lunges forward and grabs him by the ankle. Snape aims a kick that hits James right in the nose, James sees stars and feels something crack, but he's too overwhelmed by the dark and the panic and the loathing and his already aching body to register the pain, and he keeps talking—</p><p>"For Merlin's—” His voice sounds funny. He reaches up and feels something hot and wet. "Jesus fuck, did you break my nose?"</p><p>"Sod off!"</p><p>Broken face or not, James isn’t about to stop now. “I deserved that, you can break <em>all</em> our noses as soon as we get back— give all four of us nice decks to the face, won’t try to stop you— "</p><p>They reach an uphill slope in the tunnel. James recognises that slope.</p><p>"Oh shit oh shit oh shit," he pants, muffled by the hand clutching his bleeding nose. “We’re almost there— please, you've got to stop!”</p><p>Snape only seems to hear part of that. "Almost there! Wonder if they'll give you a last meal, Potter, or if they'll chuck the whole lot of you straight out tonight?"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It's hard to tell in the bumping, wavering illumination of Snape's wand, but James thinks he sees a sliver of light ahead...light like the crack above the old crate that covers the opening at the end of the tunnel…</p><p>With a great cry of “STOP!” James hurls himself forward again, cracks his head spectacularly against the ceiling of the tunnel, and lands on Snape, pinning him to the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“GET OFF!” Snape howls. They kick and thrash and claw at each other, yelling obscenities, until— somehow— the scrawny berk gets the better of James and shoves him backwards. Snape tumbles toward the light with a shout of victory.</p><p>In the flurry of motion Snape drops his wand, and the light goes out. James can just make out his hands closing over the top of the crate.</p><p>"NO!" he screams, but too late: Snape shoves at the crate and it skids away, flooding the tunnel with light.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Often when Peter was a child he would go to the cinema or read a comic book and wish that his life offered him moments in which to do cool, brave, heroic things, like James Bond or Superman did. Young Peter wanted nothing more than to be brave, but he never seemed to get the chance. Growing up in a tiny village in the middle of nowhere, opportunities were pretty thin on the ground.</p><p>It was only after going to a magical school where everything wants to kill you and falling in with the most popular kids in the place— two troublemaking adrenaline junkies and their werewolf pal— that these chances started to present themselves, and Peter discovered that bravery does not come as easily for him as he’d hoped. Not easily at all, in fact. As it turns out, ‘brave’ is a trait just like ‘red-haired’ or ‘flat-footed’, and you’ve either got it or you haven’t. It’s a bit of a let down, that.</p><p>But he wishes, sometimes.</p><p>“James hasn't got his wand," Peter says. Thunder rumbles outside the windows of the dormitory. “I saw him put it down."</p><p>Sirius hasn’t pulled the hangings around his bed. He lies there, eyes wide open and fixed on the rain-washed window.</p><p>"I should bring it to him," Peter says.</p><p>"Go to bed, Pete."</p><p>"James doesn't have his wand," Peter repeats to himself, wringing his hands. Maybe if he keeps saying it it’ll give him something to hold onto in the panic that threatens to drown him, like a mantra. “He doesn’t have his wand. I should bring it to him.” His breath is seizing up; he feels the damned stutter coming on but can do nothing to stop it when he says, “I-I-I ought to run out there now, t-to the p-p-passageway, and--"</p><p>"We both know you won't," comes Sirius' voice, flat. "Go to bed. James can take care of himself."</p><p>"But...b-b-but I—I—“</p><p>"You what? Spit it out," Sirius snaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It stings.</p><p>Instantly Sirius is sitting up and looking at him, a funny expression on his face. Shock? “Wait, that…” Sirius says. He swallows. “Sorry.”</p><p>"It's alright."</p><p>“No, it wasn’t,” Sirius says. Then he sighs and flops back down. "Just go to bed, alright?"</p><p>Peter knows what the brave option here is. He sees the wand lying on James' bedspread, useless. He thinks of James down in the tunnel, possibly about to face a werewolf with no way of defending himself. The brave thing to do is obvious, Peter knows it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He can't do it.</p><p>“I…I…” Peter's trembling to his shoes as he goes and collects the Cloak from under James' bed. “I’ve got another idea."</p><p>He goes.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>James never does understand the reaction he has in that horrible, suspended half-second after Snape pushes aside the crate blocking the entrance to the Shack. Even later it will never make sense to him why he’s struck so unable to move, or breathe, or think, or do anything at all besides crouch there at the mouth of the passageway and say, "Well, now you've done it."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Everything happens very quickly. The Shack's lit by firelight and it spills into the pitch-dark tunnel, blocked out by Snape crouching at the entrance. James sees the half-second in which Snape goes completely rigid, he hears the strangled shout of horror, he hears the heavy footfalls crossing the rotting floorboards of the Shack. And he really, really hears the low, canine growl.</p><p>"RUN!" James shouts, but Snape is frozen in place. They’re thrown into darkness as a figure hovers outside the lip of the passageway; James’ fear-shot mind catches into a loop of <em>run run run</em>, but he doesn’t run. He leaps forward, grabs Snape around the middle, and hauls him backwards.</p><p>It’s just in time. They haven’t hit the tunnel floor when something shoves through the opening, thrown into nightmarish relief against the darkness, and James’ vision swims from the horror of it: the head and shoulders of the wolf, jaws snapping, eyes bulging, muzzle dark with its own blood—</p><p><em>Remus, </em>James thinks. <em>That’s Remus.</em></p><p>“COME ON!” James shouts, and Snape doesn’t need telling twice— they take off down the tunnel, their panicked breathing not loud enough to cover the sounds of the monster as it tries to force its body through, snarling and clawing and gnashing its teeth.</p><p>Snape doesn’t relight his wand; they stumble forward in pitch darkness. The minutes stretch by in a wash of pain and frenzy. James’ mind goes white, he ignores the blood crusting on his face and knows nothing except <em>forward forward forward. </em>The sounds of the wolf fade behind them until there’s no sound in the backness but their breathing, and the ringing in James’ ears.</p><p>Neither of them speak. James has no idea what he’d say even if he wanted to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>James sees faint light ahead. They draw closer and he hears thunder, sees the bluish glow of the rain slanting into the mouth of the tunnel; closer still and he smells it, feels it gloriously cool on his stinging face. James pulls himself up through the gnarled roots, presses the knot by his shoulder, and falls face-first, aching and exhausted, into the wet grass. The rain whips at his back and he feels an appendage or two get sucked up by the mud.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Sirius Black,” he groans into the swampy ground, “is a dead man.”</p><p>He hears fast, sloshy footsteps. James sees Snape’s ankles as he runs by, pelting up the lawn toward the castle.</p><p><em>Uh oh, </em>he thinks.</p><p>“SNAPE!” he shouts, un-suctioning himself from the squelchy mud with considerable difficulty. He sprints after Snape’s retreating back, sodden clothes hanging off him like weights. “Stop!”</p><p>“Now you’ve done it, Potter!” Snape screams, hysterical. Even as he calls back at James he doesn’t stop running, flapping toward the front doors like a big wet bat. “The game ends here! You WAIT! <em>You just</em>—”</p><p>“WAIT!” James calls. “You— you really don’t want to do this, whatever it is you’re about to do! You’re making a mistake!”</p><p>They’ve nearly reached the doors now. “It’s you and your mates who’ve made the mistake!” Thunder rolls, almost drowning out Snape’s cry of, “Let’s see how funny it is when I tell the <em>whole school</em> just what Lupin is!”</p><p>What James wouldn’t do for a wand. Or the ability to hex the limbs off of people with his mind. “Listen to me, you ugly, ungrateful—”</p><p>A bright sliver of light falls over them, and they stumble to a halt. The front doors are pushed open from within, and the two figures silhouetted there swim into focus, one of them tall and wrapped in a tartan dressing gown, the other short and in turquoise pyjamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>As Snape runs for the double doors he cries out, “PROFESSOR! It’s Lupin, he’s a—”</p><p>Now, James knows that Remus’ condition is no secret to Professor McGonagall. He’s aware of how bloody moronic it is of Snape to assume for a moment that she <em>doesn’t </em>know. So, really, Snivellus is doing nothing but proving how big of an idiot he is by shouting out the secret in this moment. No harm done by it.</p><p>It’s only for good measure, then, that James flings himself through the air and tackles him face-first into the mud.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>It's the most tremendous relief Peter has ever felt, standing there with Professor McGonagall and seeing both James and Snape running toward them, soaked and muddy but very much alive. It's less of a relief when James takes a flying leap and tackles Snape to the ground, but it isn't especially surprising.</p><p>"Potter!" Professor McGonagall cries. “Stop this <em>instant!</em> "<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>James either hasn't heard her or isn't paying attention. Peter's money is on the second. James smushes Snape’s face into the grass, saying, "Who's--funny--now--you—!”</p><p>"POTTER!"</p><p>James looks up, releasing Snape’s head to drag a hand through his hair. Over the pelting rain he calls, “Evening, Professor. Didn't see you there."</p><p>“Get inside, both of you!"</p><p>"Professor…” Snape struggles to his feet and staggers forward, chest heaving. "Professor… it's Lupin….He’s—”</p><p>"I am well aware," she says. "Now--"</p><p>Snape balks. "You knew? You knew they let that <em>thing</em> into this school and you—”</p><p>“You are already courting the loss of an astronomical number of points for Slytherin,” Professor McGonagall says, and she isn't even talking to him and Peter still cowers. “I recommend you<em> hold your tongue</em>."</p><p>Drenched and snarling, Snape pushes past them into the hall. Then Peter hears him exclaim, "What is <em>he</em> doing here?!"</p><p>Peter turns around. His stomach climbs higher into his throat: crossing the hall toward them is Dumbledore himself, sweeping robes and all. Peter’s never seen him look this grave before. At his side is Sirius, arms crossed, eyes on the floor.</p><p>"Albus, thank Merlin. You—?”</p><p>"Received your message, yes," says Dumbledore. He sounds tired, which is so strikingly strange to Peter that it's as if he had shouted. "Just in time, it seems. I happened upon Mr Black on my way."</p><p>If the presence of Dumbledore is unnerving, it’s nothing to the expression of clear shame on Sirius' face. "I was just…investigating."</p><p>"So I see," Professor McGonagall says crisply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>James bursts through the doors, soaking wet, covered head to toe in mud and-- Peter sees with horror-- dried blood. As he gulps for breath he manages, “I really…could…murder you…Black.”</p><p>Professor McGonagall has gone white. "Potter, that isn't…"</p><p>James, seemingly remembering the horror film state of his face, waves a hand. "Nah, Remus didn't touch me. This was all <em>that</em> git's doing."</p><p>"You're lucky I couldn’t do worse!”</p><p>"Silence!" Everybody falls quiet. Sirius and Snape continue to wordlessly glare at each other. James seethes in muddy silence, seemingly unsure of who he ought to be more angry with. Professor McGonagall smooths the front of her tartan dressing gown and says, "I shall fetch Professor Slughorn, he’ll--"</p><p>“No need,” Dumbledore says. “I think it's best if I take Severus from here."</p><p>"Horace is the boy’s head of House, certainly he--"</p><p>"I will speak to Severus," Dumbledore says, firmly now. His eyes fall on the door off the side of the hall, the one into the antechamber in which they'd all waited to be Sorted years ago. "This will do, I think..." He gestures to Snape. "Come along."</p><p>Even in the presence of the most famous wizard of the twentieth century, Snape hasn’t calmed down. "Professor, these four have—!”</p><p>"We will speak in private, Severus," says Dumbledore. His voice is quiet, but his tone shuts Snape up quickly. He gestures again and starts across the hall. "If you please..."</p><p>Grudgingly, Snape follows him. The door shuts, echoing loudly in the dim hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Professor McGonagall turns to the three remaining boys, two in their pyjamas and one sodden and bloody, and a look of great exhaustion passes over her face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"Right," she says. She looks to James, around whom a sizable mud puddle is forming. “You said that the...you said Lupin didn’t touch you?"</p><p>"No, Professor."</p><p>She nods. “Pettigrew, escort Potter to the hospital wing. And Black…” Professor McGonagall turns to Sirius, expressionless. “Follow me."</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Sirius has been in this office many times before. Sitting in front of this desk while Professor McGonagall tries to decide what to do with him is not a new experience. Under normal circumstances, it’d be comforting in its familiarity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>This is different. For starters, all those other times James was with him. And he didn't feel so numb.</p><p>Professor McGonagall has been pacing for a while. Finally she sits down at her desk, back straight, looks Sirius in the face, and says, “Well, then. What am I to do with you, Black?”</p><p>Sirius finds himself struggling to make eye contact. That is also new. "Detention?"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No, I think not."</p><p>He looks up, stunned. "But...you always give me detention."</p><p>"Precisely. I cannot punish this as I would a normal offense, because this is not a normal offense. It would be an insult to Lupin to treat this as I would one of you and Potter’s”, her mouth goes thin with distaste, "pranks."</p><p>"But Professor, it <em>was</em> a prank! I wasn't trying to— it was just a joke, he—”</p><p>“Black, if you are truly unable to distinguish between a prank and attempted murder, you are beyond my ability to help.” The usually taut lines of her face are weary. "Obviously, this is grounds for expulsion.”</p><p>Sirius' stomach gives a dizzying heave. "Expulsion?"</p><p>She pauses, staring as if to study him. He drops his eyes again. Professor McGonagall says, “You are aware I’ve been in correspondence with your cousin?"</p><p>"Yeah, she told me,” he tells his knees.</p><p>"Then you understand why I cannot expel you."</p><p>He looks up. “…No?"</p><p>"I will not send you back to that house. That burden will not be on me. Do you understand?"</p><p>The numbness is fading away, leaving Sirius nauseous. He thinks his hands are shaking. He nods.</p><p>Professor McGonagall sighs, pushes her spectacles out of the way, rubs her temples. "Fifty points from Gryffindor, I suppose,” she says. “For you and Potter, being out after hours."</p><p>Sirius nods again. He’s sick and shaky. He’d very much like the numbness back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>There's another long stretch of silence. Unable to look at Professor McGonagall, Sirius stares out the window instead. He can see the Quidditch pitch from here, silhouetted against the blue-black mass of the forest. The storm’s dying down; no more lightning over the mountains, just a miserable dribble of rain against the dark sky.</p><p>"I am not prepared to deem you a lost cause, Black."</p><p>Sirius stays facing the window. There’s pressure building behind his eyes. He squeezes them shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"Good, upstanding people have come out of difficult families. I've seen it before, and I wish to see it again." A pause, and then: "Sirius."</p><p>He looks over, startled; his first name sounds funny in her voice. She watches him with a hard expression in her eyes.</p><p>"I am giving you a second chance,” she says. “See that I don't come to regret it."</p><p>Sirius nods. There's a hard lump in his throat, cutting off all sound.</p><p>She looks at the window. As the storm fades the full moon is back in sight, a misty apparition through the clouds. "What you will do," she says, "is go to the hospital wing. Tell Madam Pomfrey I’ve sent you and that you’re to wait there until dawn.”</p><p>Sirius nods again, but he’s confused. Is he going to make beds? Clean bedpans? Why now, in the middle of the night? What sort of detention is this?</p><p>Professor McGonagall gets out a quill and parchment. She writes, pausing intermittently to stare at the parchment, contemplative. She folds it, hands it to Sirius, and says, "Give this to Poppy." She gets up and heads for the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Standing is more difficult than Sirius anticipated. His legs feel odd. She opens the door for him and says, "You are to tell Lupin about this evening's...events.”</p><p>"Yes, Professor.” His voice is soft and strange.</p><p>"Off you go, then," she says. She shuts the door behind him.</p><p>The hospital wing is just down the corridor from Professor McGonagall’s study, but the walk there seems long. He’s hyperaware of everything: the stripes of filtered moonlight across the floor, the soft snores from portraits on the walls, the sheet of parchment gone heavy in his hand. Was it really just this morning that he woke up Remus in his bed?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He knocks on the hospital wing doors for a long time, and Madam Pomfrey is irritated at being woken up. Her mood shifts when she reads the note, though, and wordlessly she guides him across the long dark room and its rows of beds. She stops at the far end of the room by a bed enclosed with screens, indicating a chair at its side.</p><p>“Wait there,” she says. “This is where I usually put him…it’ll be a few hours yet.”</p><p>Sirius sits. She exits into her office. He waits.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>He’s nodded off in his chair when the doors creak. Jolting awake, Sirius blinks while his surroundings come into focus. The sky outside the windows is pink with sunrise, throwing the room into soft shadow. Quick footsteps echo in the quiet, and Sirius stands to see Madam Pomfrey hurry toward him, carrying something very large.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I always Apparate him back,” she tells Sirius, out of breath, “but that just puts us at the school gates…still a bit of hike. Here, help me.” She adjusts the bundle in her arms— an unconscious Remus, wrapped in a sheet. Sirius has trouble discerning the colour of the fabric; it’s covered in dark stains. He hooks his arms under Remus’ knees and helps Madam Pomfrey shift him onto the neat white bedclothes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Not so bad, this moon,” she mutters, thoughtful. She pulls out an array of bottles from the bedside cabinet, sets them out in a line. “Some are worse than others, they— well, you know that. Who knows why, could be his mood, could be anything…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She peels back the sheet. Sirius gets a glance of a lot of red before he’s lurching away, gripping one of the screen’s rods while a wave of nausea crashes over him. It’s like standing up too fast when you haven’t eaten anything; his vision goes fuzzy, and Madam Pomfrey seems to speak to him from the end of a long tunnel when she says, “Aim for the bin, won’t you? I’ve only just changed the linens.” He’s distantly aware of the wastepaper bin she slides towards him.</p><p>He shakes his head, forces the dizziness away. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Madam Pomfrey tuts at him, looking over Remus, towel in hand. “You’d think you’d be able to tolerate blood,” she says as she mops up a tremendous amount of the substance in question, “with your condition. You’re in here every other week to get something to stop bleeding.”</p><p>“Just a shock,” he says.</p><p>Distracted by her work— the wet gashes hacked into Remus’ torso, for starters, and Sirius’ stomach rolls over again— she hums vaguely. “Think this is shocking, you ought see a bad moon. Merlin forbid a Black should get bitten by a werewolf, this one’s blood coagulates on its own and still he barely survives them— dittany, the blue bottle there.”</p><p>Sirius passes it to her. “How long until he wakes up? He…he’s usually been up for a while before you let us see him, so…”</p><p>“Oh, an hour or two,” she says breezily. She douses a rag in dittany and presses it to an especially deep gouge across Remus’ chest. “After one like this he’ll be up in no time.”</p><p>“Can…can I help, or…?”</p><p>“Yes, keep passing me things.”</p><p>Sirius nods.</p><p>It goes on forever. Madam Pomfrey asks for things and he hands them over, and in between he’s free to observe up close the extent of the damage. The wolf seems to have gotten to every part of Remus’ body, ripping with teeth and claws and tearing off chunks of flesh that have to be blotted with dittany over and over again to grow back. Not all of the wounds are from biting and scratching. There are long, ragged fissures around his joints where the skin split as the bones underneath bent and expanded; Madam Pomfrey passes her wand over them and mutters a stream of incantations as the skin knits itself back together. At one point, without any warning, she gives Remus’ arm a deft twist and a shove, repositioning it in the socket with an awful noise somewhere between a crack and a crunch. “That happens now and again,” she says in response to whatever expression is on Sirius’ face. She drips dittany onto one last laceration on Remus’ knee and watches the flesh bubble and mend before corking the bottle and setting it on the bedside table.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Unprompted, a memory presents itself to Sirius. It’s foggy with years, but it plays without effort: eleven-year-old Remus, lying in bed next to Sirius in the small hours of the morning, re-buttoning his shirt over a big ugly scar. <em>It’s not nice, </em>he said. <em>None of it is.</em></p><p>“Well,” Madam Pomfrey says, wiping her hands on the one remaining unbloodied rag, “that’ll do it.” She waves her wand and a moment later Remus is under the covers, dressed in clean pyjamas and looking for all the world like he’s just had an ordinary night of rest. “He should be up soon. I’ll be in my office if he needs anything.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She leaves Sirius alone to sit by Remus’ bedside. He watches Remus sleep and tries not to feel too creepy about it. He’s always looked younger when he sleeps. Sirius has found this endearing in the past, but he’s incapable of feeling anything at the moment besides something he can’t name that sits heavy and breathless in his chest. It’s reminiscent of the feeling he had in Professor McGonagall’s office: this place and this chair are familiar, but this situation is one of sick dread and terrible shame and not familiar or comforting at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He hasn’t got to contemplate it long. A handful of minutes later, Remus’ eyelids twitch, a long sleeping breath stutters, and he flickers his eyes open to the ceiling. In spite of himself, Sirius smiles.</p><p>“Look what the cat dragged in.”</p><p>Remus’ eyes are warm and brown and sleep-cloudy when they find Sirius’. A smile lights slowly across his face. “’S’one hell of a cat,” he says, hoarse.</p><p>“Got some real claws on it.”</p><p>“I’ll say.” Remus blinks, dazed. “How…” he rasps, “…how’re you here? How’d you…” He refocuses the sleepy smile on Sirius again and mumbles, blissful: “You’re here.”</p><p>“And you’re still completely out of it.” Dopey sleep-drunk Remus is one of his favourite things in the world, but he stays businesslike. “How’re you feeling? Madam Pomfrey’s just in her office, she said to fetch her if you needed anything.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Remus says. He’s beginning to properly gain consciousness, stretching a bit under the covers. “Sort of starving, though.”</p><p>Sirius leaps to his feet. Leaving the room is an appealing prospect. “I’ll—”</p><p>“No, no, wait.” Remus catches him by the arm. “How’d you get her to let you in?”</p><p><em>Just tell him</em>, Sirius says to himself. <em>Just explain what happened. </em>But still Sirius stands there, Remus holding him by the wrist, nothing coming out of his mouth. All sound’s dried up. He sits down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You know,” he begins, with no idea where he intends to end up, “I’ve never been sure: how much do you remember from when you’re transformed? The next morning, I mean.”</p><p>Remus doesn’t let go of his wrist. He turns Sirius’ hand over so they’re palm-to-palm, plays absently with his fingers. “It’s hard to explain. I don’t precisely <em>remember </em>things— there aren’t details. But sometimes I’ll wake up with some impression of what the wolf was feeling. Last night, for instance. He enjoyed himself more than usual. He likes storms, I don’t know why.”</p><p>“So, it’s…better, when he’s pleased?”</p><p>“Difficult to say. There seems to be some correlation between my mood, his mood, and how bad the moon ends up being. Why, look at me this morning—easiest one in ages, I feel better than ever.”</p><p>Sirius recalls his first impression of <em>red</em>, a vivid snapshot in his mind. “You do?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Definitely. More evidence towards my theory.” Hand still pressed to his, he gives Sirius a small, meaningful smile. “Both he and I were in wonderful moods.”</p><p>Sirius drops his eyes. “But it’s never more specific than that?”</p><p>“Only rarely. But,” Remus adds, “it’s odd you ask, because I think something happened that excited him last night. It wasn’t the storm, it was… <em>sharper </em>than that. He wanted something. I think a rabbit got in, or a bird— something he was after.”</p><p>“I did something,” Sirius says.</p><p>He doesn’t see Remus’ face when he asks, “Oh?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Snape,” Sirius blurts. “He was spying again. Angry about James following Lily at the party, I don’t know why he cares so much, just because nobody else can stand him—was all wounded on her behalf, as if that <em>excused</em>—”</p><p>“I suppose James did have it coming, though,” Remus adds. “People who listen behind arrases shouldn’t be surprised when they get stabbed, and all that.”</p><p>“What?” Sirius says, but quickly moves on. “As if that were a good enough excuse to sneak around invisible and spy on people’s private conversations, trying to get them expelled!”</p><p>When he looks up at Remus again his expression has hardly changed, but something shuttered has fallen behind his eyes. “What happened?”</p><p>“He was spying, he was trying to get us all <em>expelled!</em>” Sirius rants. “Like he’s been doing for years! But this time he really had some nerve, he followed us after the party and heard you say that you were going down to the Entrance Hall at half past so he went and waited there until we came down and you left with Madam Pomfrey! I caught him, though,” his breath comes fast and he reminds himself to keep his voice down, “and he told me everything and how he was <em>so-ooo close </em>this time to figuring out what we were up to and— and he talked about Regulus and asked if you and I were an item and I couldn’t <em>stand </em>it, Moony, somebody had to do something!”</p><p>Remus moves his hand from Sirius’ to pick at the bedspread. He nods thoughtfully, as though Sirius has just explained Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration. “And you did something?”</p><p>“I told him how to get through the Willow and that he’d find all his answers there.”</p><p>For a long, long, dragging moment, Remus studies the edge of the bedspread. Then he nods. In an even voice he says, “It wasn’t a rabbit, then. Or a bird.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>“But he’s alright, you didn’t touch him or anything, James went and followed after and dragged him back before he got there, so it was fine.”</p><p>Another nod. “But he did glimpse me?”</p><p>“Yeah, but Dumbledore was there and he pulled him aside to talk to him. I’ll bet a thousand Galleons he was warning him to keep his fat ugly mouth shut.”</p><p>“That’s good.”</p><p>“He’s not gonna tell, Dumbledore would expel him if he did!” Sirius insists. “So everything’s fine, yeah? No harm done.”</p><p>Remus takes a long breath in. It shakes when he lets it out. Then he says, “No harm done. You’d better be off, Sirius, it’s getting late.”</p><p>Sirius startles. “I mean, McGonagall’s the one who sent me down here, we’ve got Transfiguration first and I don’t think—”</p><p>“I’ll see you later,” Remus says. His tone is polite, but it’s a clear dismissal. An ending.</p><p>Sirius wracks his brain for something to say. Surely there’s something else he ought to say? But his head aches with exhaustion and he’s gone numb again. He stands. “Alright. See you.”</p><p>He makes it all the way back to Gryffindor Tower without seeing anybody except for a couple of indifferent ghosts. Everyone’s at breakfast, probably. As he heads up to the dormitory he feels tremendously grateful for it. He doesn’t feel like inventing an explanation, or saying anything at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>It takes Madam Pomfrey about thirty seconds to fix James’ broken nose. The next morning he and Peter get dressed in silence. James feels…weird. It’s a weird morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“This is weird, isn’t it?” he says.</p><p>Peter tugs his head free of his robes, making his hair stick up. “You think Moony’s up yet?”</p><p>“For his sake I hope not,” James says. “Probably more merciful to put him in a coma until graduation.”</p><p>“Where’s Sirius?”</p><p>“Search me.”</p><p>“Y-you…” Peter says, worrying at the strap of his bag, “you don’t, don’t think she—”</p><p>“Nah, if he got expelled he would’ve come back for his stuff,” James says. He swings his bag over his shoulder and shoos Tesla, who’s curled up in front of the door. She meows irritably as he passes. “Probably just scared I’d murder him in his sleep.”</p><p>“Will you?”</p><p>“Strongly considering it.” They start down the stairs into the common room. “The moral thing to do is give Remus the honours, but I’m tempted.” He shakes his head and drops his voice as they join the crush toward the portrait hole. “I don’t know what we’re gonna say to Moony. Poor bastard. As if his life weren’t hard enough without…yeah, I’m gonna murder Black. Slowly.”</p><p>They take their usual spots at the Gryffindor table for breakfast but there’s no sign of Sirius. No matter what he told Peter, James is a little worried. They would know if he’d been expelled, wouldn’t they? James is pushing his eggs around on his plate, feeling whatever the exact opposite of hungry is, when he feels a nudge to the arm.</p><p>“Look,” Peter mutters, indicating the entrance to the Great Hall. James cranes his neck and immediately goes for his wand: Snape has just stalked in, looking surlier than ever. For some reason James’ temper only flares hotter when he sees Evans walking in next to him, just the bloody best of pals. He’ll never understand that, he really won’t…</p><p>“Not here, though,” Peter says. “Did you see the hourglasses this morning? Slytherin took a hit but not as big as us.”</p><p>“Fuck the House Cup. I’m gonna hex him into jelly.”</p><p>“Better to wait, though, right?” Peter suggests nervously. “When there aren’t teachers around…”</p><p>James <em>hmmph</em>s and puts away his wand, but his eyes still follow Snape. At the Slytherin table he sees the great bat scuttle over to sit by Evans (a Gryffindor sitting with the snakes, it’s disgraceful), sees the two of them duck their heads together and confer about whatever— which of them’s a bigger prat, probably— until Snivellus looks up and notices James trying to kill him with his mind. He sneers in answer. Evans looks up, sees what’s going on, and shoots James daggers with her eyes. She tugs at Snape’s sleeve and, with a prissy swish of her stupid hair, turns him back to their conversation. James throws his fork down with a clatter.</p><p>“Ready to go?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Peter startles mid-pour of pumpkin juice, and it slops all over his sleeve. “Er— didn’t we just sit down?”</p><p>“Whatever, I’m leaving,” James grumbles. “You coming or not?”</p><p>James is relieved beyond belief when he wanders into Transfiguration and sees Sirius in his usual chair (all four legs on the floor today), but he tries not to show it. They take their desks on either side of him; Peter dives into his bag, ostensibly looking for a quill, and leaves James to deal with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>James crosses his arms. “Where were you, then?”</p><p>Sirius looks rough. He isn’t sitting in his usual controlled sprawl, and there are shadows under his eyes. “Hospital wing."</p><p>“Sleep at all?”</p><p>“Not especially.”</p><p>“We’re starting Vanishing today. Better buck up.”</p><p>Emerging from his bag, Peter asks, “Was that a pun?”</p><p>James doesn’t take his eyes from the front. “Shut up, Wormtail.”</p><p>After Transfiguration, James and Sirius make it all the way up to North Tower for Divination without speaking a word. They only acknowledge each other at all when the class splits up into its usual pairings; they're reviewing tea leaves today. It's James' turn to stare into the grainy dregs in Sirius’ teacup and try to make sense of them.</p><p>"Well,” he says, "that bit right there is sort of...round. That means—” He flips a page in his textbook at random, “betrayal."</p><p>"That can't be what 'round' means.” Sirius makes to read the book over James' shoulder. "Are you sure you're—”</p><p>"And here," James continues, "that right there— that means the destruction of trust."</p><p>"I dunno what you're looking at mate, but—”</p><p>James barely glances into the cup. “And see, right there, that <em>definitely</em> portends the betrayal of a trust given to you by a friend which ends up making that friend miserable and nearly forcing him to kill somebody."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius snatches back his teacup. "Fuck off."</p><p>"You really fucking amaze me sometimes, you know that?" James whispers, unable to keep it in anymore. “What were you thinking? <em>Were</em> you thinking?"</p><p>"I don't know what the big deal is.” Sirius slumps forward in his chair, hair falling over his face, shoulders curved in defensively. It’s not like him at all, and it looks odd. “It was <em>Snape</em>. Who cares?”</p><p>"Are you even hearing yourself? You sound like a, a—”</p><p>"A what?"</p><p>"Merlin, I don't even know,” James hisses. “I don't know what kind of person wouldn't care about almost <em>killing somebody</em>, even if it did happen to be the most annoying person on the planet! I don't know how you can be so…<em>unfeeling</em> about all of this.”</p><p>Sirius tips his head up, a defiant set to his mouth. “So you're taking his side, then?"</p><p>“This isn't about <em>sides</em>, it’s about what you almost did to Moony! God, why am I even saying 'almost’— that slithery bastard knows now, and it's your fault!"</p><p>Sirius glares down into his teacup, settling into sulky silence again. James turns back to his book, pretends to be busy. Then he hears Sirius say, in an odd voice, “What, so you hate me now?"</p><p>James pushes under his glasses with the heels of his hands. He rubs his eyes, deeply exhausted in a way that might not be entirely to do with the long night. “We're best friends, Black. That's not any different.” He sighs. “But yeah, I do hate you at the moment. Probably will for a bit yet. Get used to it."</p><p>They go back to ignoring each other for the rest of the lesson.</p><p>So James is already in a pretty foul mood when he stomps his way down towards the Great Hall for lunch (alone, as Sirius seemed to dematerialise the second they left the classroom). As he pushes through the pre-lunch crowd in the second floor corridor, stopping to hex a couple of fourth year slow-walkers, he spots a group of his friends, because he <em>has </em>got friends who aren’t Remus or Peter or that arrogant, girly-haired bastard who he refuses to think about, thank you very much. It’s Dirk Cresswell’s lot, with Casey and Marco and Davey and them, none of whom have ever tried to kill anybody as far as James knows, so he makes his way over. A second later, though, Casey points his wand at Davey who goes flying up into the air by the ankle, and oh Merlin, James <em>knows </em>that spell.</p><p>“OY!” James calls across the corridor. He elbows a Ravenclaw out of the way until he’s in earshot. “Jordan! Where’d you get that spell from, eh?”</p><p>All of them laugh. Casey shouts, “Wouldn’t you like to know, Potter?” Then he turns his wand on James and says an incantation he can’t hear, and James gets pulled up by the fucking ankle again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He hangs there for a minute, cursing loquaciously while his <em>supposed</em> mates laugh their heads off. It’s official, he hasn’t got any friends in this whole godforsaken castle. Without warning he goes crashing to the floor, and when he disentangles himself from his robes again he’s looking up into Florence’s face, which is unusually serious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Thanks,” he says, getting to his feet. He scrubs a hand through his hair before looping his arm around her waist and proclaiming, “You’re the only one I can count on round here.”</p><p>They start down the corridor together. She smiles wryly, looking a bit more like her normal self. “I hear you’re— er— familiar with that spell?”</p><p>James stops dead. “You ‘hear’? Does that mean—”</p><p>“That the whole school’s heard about how you crashed Slughorn’s party in drag, spied on Lily, and showed off your knickers to all the important guests?” she suggests. “I’m afraid so. Everybody’s picked up the spell pretty quickly.”</p><p>“Don’t know why it’s so funny. Partial nudity has always been my MO. If anybody round here wants to see me in my pants all they’ve got to do is <em>ask</em>.”</p><p>He expects her to riff back, like she always does, but Florence frowns. “I did want to ask you about that. Not with everybody around though— er—” She casts a glance up and down the corridor. “This’ll do,” she says, and tugs him over to the out of order girl’s bathroom. She shuts the door behind them. Predictably, it’s empty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Y’know, I’ve never been in here before,” James says, looking around at the gloomy place. “Well, there was that time me and Sirius— third year, I think it was—”</p><p>“What happened last night?” Florence leans back against a chipped sink, crosses her arms. Brown eyes narrowed, she says, “People are saying the maddest stuff.”</p><p>“I dunno what’s so mad about it. We crashed the party, I’m dead sexy as a bird, Evans is the worst, end of story.”</p><p>“Everybody’s saying that something happened after the party, later that night.”</p><p>James freezes. “Yeah? What’re they saying?”</p><p>“I only know what <em>I </em>heard, I dunno what else is going round,” she says, tucking a loose curl behind her ear in a thoughtful sort of way. “Lorraine said that Hazel went in to see Madam Pomfrey before breakfast this morning because she didn’t want to miss practise again, she’s still got that thing with her wrist, but— anyway. She said she saw Sirius leaving the hospital wing.”</p><p>“So? Probably breathed in the direction of something sharp and had to get his blood stopped up.”</p><p>“But Hazel mentioned it to Marianne,” Florence goes on, “who said that she and Vera were up most the night in the common room doing some Ancient Runes thing, and Marianne saw Sirius <em>leave </em>the common room that night but never saw him come back in, and of course Marianne’d notice because—”</p><p>“Because she thinks the sun shines out Black’s arse, right.”</p><p>“Yeah. And then Vera said that Shirley Warrington was telling <em>her</em> how she and half of Slytherin got woken up at some hour in the morning by Severus Snape throwing a tantrum and smashing a bunch of stuff in the common room—”</p><p>“But…hang on, Vera told you what?” Though James frequently finds himself the subject of gossip, he’s never been good at it himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Florence rolls her eyes. She summarises: “Everybody’s saying that something happened with Sirius and Snape last night, and I saw you nodding off in Transfiguration. And don’t think the whole House hasn’t noticed the state of the hourglass. People are pretty brassed off about that.”</p><p><em>Uh oh</em>, James thinks. “Er,” he says.</p><p>Florence raises her eyebrows. “So...something did happen, then?”</p><p>“No,” he says, too quickly. “Reckon Snape was just throwing a hissy because he’s ugly and nobody likes him.”</p><p>She turns to fiddle absently with the broken tap, twisting one of the rusted knobs back and forth. “I get it, you haven’t got to tell me everything. I know when to mind my business.”</p><p>“There’s a shortage of that round here,” James mumbles.</p><p>“How d’you mean?”</p><p>Sirius and Snape immediately come to mind, but Florence can’t know that. “Evans, for a start,” he says.</p><p>She looks up, eyebrow quirked. “A bit hypocritical, don’t you reckon?”</p><p>He can’t <em>believe </em>this. “What, so I get laughed at by the whole school for— for <em>investigating </em>one time, but she’s the biggest busybody ever and everybody adores her?”</p><p>“Lily’s a gossip, but she doesn’t spy on people. There’s a difference.”</p><p>“Yeah, whatever.” He stuffs his hands in his pockets and paces, irritable. How is it that every conversation has always got to lead to perfect, prissy Lily Evans?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“That’s the other thing I wanted to ask about,” Florence says.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“What were you spying on Lily for?”</p><p>James vents his feelings on a frustrated groan to the ceiling. “Because everybody thinks she’s so <em>perfect</em>—”</p><p>“Nobody said she was perfect, you’re the only one who’s ever said that—”</p><p>“—and catching her doing something dodgy would’ve been so great because I’ve known all along that she’s dodgy, and nosy, and awful!”</p><p>“I don’t know why you’ve got to be such a drag about her all the time. You’re always picking on her.”</p><p>“<em>I </em>pick on <em>her? </em>She’s the one who picks on me!”</p><p>“Oh, quit being dramatic!” Florence exclaims, pushing off from the sink to stand in front of him. “She barely speaks to you, she ignores you as best she can— she <em>tells </em>me she does— but you go out of your way to provoke her! I really don’t know what your problem is!”</p><p>“My problem is her!” James cries. “Nobody else sees how terrible she is and it drives me mad!”</p><p>“She’s my friend, you know,” Florence fires back, hands on her hips. “I don’t much appreciate you talking about my friends like that.”</p><p>“Well, maybe you ought to get better friends!”</p><p>He knows he’s messed up the second it’s out of his mouth.</p><p>“That’s great, James,” she says icily. “Really classy. What about your friends, eh? They’re no angels either but I never say a word about it, because that— it— it’s just really not on!”</p><p>“Sounds like you’ve got something to say!” James shouts. “Better go on and say it, then!”</p><p>“I know something bad happened with Black and Snape last night! And I know it was something bad, <em>everybody </em>knows— lost us all the points we won against Ravenclaw, whatever it was— and you haven’t got to tell me everything about your life, James, just tell me you don’t want to talk about it and I’ll drop it, but I hate it when you lie to me! I feel like shit when you lie to me, I really do!”</p><p>“I’m not lying! Look, nothing—”</p><p>“Just— don’t. Don’t bother.” She hooks her hands at the back of her neck and tilts her head back, something she does when she’s well and truly irritated at him. “Merlin, I see what Jeanette meant, two years ago she said it…”</p><p>That throws him. “What’s Jeanette got to do with it?”</p><p>“You lot.” She lets her arms drop back to her sides. “You’re…<em>impossible</em>.”</p><p>“Impossible?”</p><p>“The four of you,” she says, shaking her head. “You’re impossible to date because nobody on the outside has any bloody clue what’s going on in that little gang of yours. And there’s always something going on, Merlin knows what, everybody can tell you’re up to your eyes in secrets! All four of you, you’re just…impossible.”</p><p>James doesn’t know what to say to that.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“…and then she said we’ve been ‘growing apart’ and all this other nonsense, then she took off and left me there,” James complains. “Moaning Myrtle laughed at me. <em>Moaning Myrtle </em>thinks I’m pathetic.”</p><p>“Had you?” asks Peter. He and James are crossing to the Great Hall with the rest of the mealtime crowd. “Been growing apart, I mean.”</p><p>“I guess. Still, I get the feeling she was only ending it amicably to keep things from getting awkward in the Quidditch team.”</p><p>“How d’you reckon that?”</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, James sees somebody on the far side of the hall get pulled up into the air by the ankle. Bollocks, it really is spreading. “Because she said the words, ‘I’m ending it amicably to keep things from getting awkward in the Quidditch team’.”</p><p>“Oh, er, well, yeah, you’re probably right.”</p><p>“I can’t believe she’d dump me <em>now</em>,” James moans. “She couldn’t’ve waited till after Saturday? We’re playing Hufflepuff and they’ve got an excellent lineup this year, I’ve got to admit. That’s Seekers for you— so self-centred.”</p><p>“Er.” Peter pulls back to avoid being trampled by the large seventh year shoving in front of them. James flicks his wand and Jelly-Legs Jinxes the kid, waits for him to topple to the floor, and walks him and Peter around. “You don’t seem very upset,” Peter says.</p><p>They pass into the bustling Great Hall and James musses his own hair absently. Truth be told, he’s surprised he isn’t more upset. He’s sad, of course he is, and rather disoriented, but…he and Florence were together for almost a <em>year</em>. Knowing himself, he should be inconsolable right now. He’s not, though. He shrugs.</p><p>“Distracted, I guess. Got enough to worry about at the moment. You think he’s gonna show up?”</p><p>Sirius doesn’t show up. He’s missing all throughout lunch, and doesn’t appear as they slosh en-masse through the mud toward Herbology with the Ravenclaws. Must be skiving off to sulk someplace, James reckons. Well, it’s all the same to James. If Sirius were here, he doesn’t know if he could trust himself not to cave his head in with a watering can.</p><p>“Y’know,” James says to Peter as they fertilise potted Screechsnap seedlings with dragon dung, “for a bloke who refuses to admit he’s done anything wrong he sure is hiding a lot.”</p><p>“I guess he isn’t ready to admit it yet.”</p><p>“No, he’s just more full of shite than these pots.”</p><p>“Amounts to the same thing, I reckon.”</p><p>With a <em>hmph </em>James takes up his pruning shears and begins aggressively snipping at their Screechsnaps, which squeak in annoyance. This is the worst day he’s had in…well, ever, probably, and he feels angry and frustrated and scared shitless. He knows that he and Peter will go to see Remus after lessons are done to catch him up on what he’s missed, like they always do. The thought makes him want to hide in a ditch and never come out. What’re they going to say to him? What <em>can </em>they say? He doesn’t think Sirius will have the gall to show up for that, but boy, if he does…James chops off a twig from the seedling in front of him with a lot more force than necessary.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>As the lesson drags on James finds more and more things to be angry at. He’s angry at Florence, who’s at the other end of the table dumping fertiliser into pots with Hazel, happy as a clam. Merlin, they were together for almost a year, she couldn’t at least <em>pretend </em>to be sad? He’s angry at Peter, who’s studiously ignoring James’ existence. He’s angry at these stupid squeaky plants and at the weather for being muddy and humid and— he casts a glance around the greenhouse, looking for more things to hate— and, oh yeah, he’s really, <em>really </em>angry at nosy, irritating, un-bloody-bearable Lily Evans.</p><p>There she is, right in his line of sight, partnered with Rodney Stebbins and pruning a Screechsnap in an <em>incredibly </em>smug fashion. Everything that’s happened in the last twenty-four hours, it occurs to James, is her fault. If she hadn’t been creeping about being dodgy and bullying Alice Higgs into letting her into some sort of secret club, James wouldn’t have had to work out what was going on, and if he hadn’t had to do that then Snape wouldn’t have gotten all righteously indignant about it, and if Snape hadn’t had to stick his big greasy nose where it didn’t belong Sirius wouldn’t have pulled the most profound fuck-up of his long and prolific career as a fuck-up. If Lily Busybody Evans hadn’t stirred up trouble at Slughorn’s party James would still have a girlfriend, he wouldn’t be the joke of the school for inspiring the latest new jinx that’s sweeping the castle, and, most of all, <em>Snivellus wouldn’t know that Remus is a fucking werewolf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>Merlin, James hates her. He watches her twist up her ugly shiny hair and pin it through with her wand and meditates on how much he hates her. Florence asked what his ‘problem’ was, as if <em>he </em>were the one with the problem! The others always used to accuse him of being ‘obsessed’ with her, or whatever, but that’s just because he hates her so bloody much. He hates her because oh, doesn’t everyone just <em>love </em>Lily Evans, cleverest girl in the year and mouthy as hell to professors but charismatic enough that they love her anyway, popular and pretty Lily Evans with all her damn <em>charm </em>and her stupid <em>eyes— </em>who has green eyes, anyway? Nobody, that’s who. Nobody has eyes like that, it’s probably a sign of how evil she is, or something. And her stupid <em>face </em>and how she’s always got to look, like, <em>elegant </em>or whatever, even in their boring school robes. They’re boring for a reason! Being <em>pretty </em>in them is highly inappropriate, especially for a prefect, Merlin, she’s such a bloody hypocrite.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>James moves around seedling pots at random, busying his hands while he continues to concentrate all the force of his hatred onto Lily Perfect Evans. She says something to Stebbins that makes him laugh, oh, sure, she’s so bloody funny, isn’t that just typical! Perfect Lily Evans and her <em>wit</em>, oh sure, and then James remembers what Florence said about how nobody else had called her ‘perfect’ and he was the only one who kept using that word, and, well, yeah, maybe they don’t say it out loud, but they’ve all got to be thinking it! Because she <em>is </em>perfect, in the most annoying way, she’s so perfect it makes his stomach hurt—</p><p>James hears the smash of breaking pottery a good few seconds before realising that he’s just dropped a Screechsnap pot. People turn round to look, but he barely notices.</p><p>“Merlin’s silky underthings,” he says to himself. “Not again.”</p><p>Peter gives him a concerned look. “You alright?”</p><p>James almost laughs. He doesn’t, though, just stands there rooted to the spot and curses the day he was born.</p><p>“Not a bit of it, Pete,” he says, scrubbing a hand through his hair and realising too late that he’s just run it through with dragon shite. “Not a bit.”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“He looked good, didn’t he?” James says around a mouthful of chicken. “His colour was good. Better than usual, anyway.”</p><p>Sirius sits up. He’d been slumped against his elbow, stabbing at his potatoes with his fork. It’s Tuesday evening. “Moony’s back?”</p><p>“Yeah, since last period. He showed up right on time for Arithmancy,” Peter answers. “You haven’t seen him?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“I expect he’s in the kitchens,” James says, pointedly directed at Peter and not Sirius. “Probably didn’t feel like dealing with the crowd.”</p><p>Sirius hears the subtext in that: ‘didn’t feel like facing Snape’. Still, though, Sirius has a feeling— an instinct, maybe— that Remus isn’t in the kitchens.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When Sirius stands James doesn’t bother asking where he’s going. Eyes narrowed, he lowers his voice and says, “I reckon you ought to leave him alone.”</p><p>Sirius’ temper flares at that, but he shoves it down. “I reckon you ought to mind your own business,” he says. He leaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It would make sense to go looking for him in the kitchens, James was right about that; that’s where he goes when he’s too moony to deal with the racket and bright light of the Great Hall. But when Sirius hits the Entrance Hall he doesn’t take the doorway down to the dungeons, instead going for the stairs. He reaches the fourth floor and makes for the library, and across the deserted corridor he sees the full-length mirror. Sirius pulls it open and slides down into the dimness.</p><p>The sun’s already gone down, so there’s no light coming in from the tiny windows around the ceiling of the passageway. All illumination in the place emanates from a glass jar containing a tongue of blue fire, floating in the air off to the side of the chamber. Sitting below it is Remus, propped against the wall with a book in his lap. The flames throw deep, bluish shadows across his tired face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Bit dark in here to read, isn’t it?” Sirius asks. He points his wand at the floating jar. “<em>Geminio</em>.” Two more jars of blue fire pop into existence, floating alongside the first. The chamber is saturated in wavering blue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Remus peers up at the jars. “You got the fire to duplicate as well. Very impressive.”</p><p>“Got pretty good at that spell second year.”</p><p>“I remember.”</p><p>Sirius feels uncomfortable. He looks around. “Bit like sitting at the bottom of a fish tank, isn’t it?”</p><p>“What can I do for you, Sirius?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Remus’ tone is formal. It doesn’t bode well.</p><p>“I just wanted to talk about what happened.”</p><p>“Alright.” Remus shuts his book. “Talk.”</p><p>Sirius stands in the middle of the chamber, looking down at Remus’ carefully even expression, and has never felt less eloquent in his life. He decides he ought to dive right in. “He’d been spying on us for ages, years. He’s a dirty sneak.”</p><p>“So you figured that he deserved to die for it. How reasonable.”</p><p>“‘Die’, why do people keep saying ‘die’? Werewolves bite people, they don’t just maul them, right? I mean, you lived and you were just a little kid.”</p><p>“The werewolf that attacked me hadn’t been locked up with no prey to chase for ten years. It was a bit of a different situation.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t’ve killed him!” Sirius insists. “You just would’ve made him like you! Isn’t there poetic justice in that— Death Eater scum with all his prejudice, made to walk in your shoes?”</p><p>Remus’ voice is very quiet: “I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy, Sirius.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius is out of words.</p><p>Remus sighs a sigh that’s familiar, the one that sounds wrong coming from a sixteen-year-old. He pushes his hair out of his eyes and says, “And yes, I would’ve killed him. You know that— you’ve seen firsthand what I look like after the moon. Madam Pomfrey told me you’ve seen.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean to,” Sirius says, defensive. “McGonagall wanted me to be there when you woke up so I could tell you, so it just happened that I was there when Pomfrey brought you in.” The words are hardly out before he realises how thick he’s been. “That wasn’t a coincidence, was it?”</p><p>“No, I don’t imagine it was.”</p><p>Sirius thinks out loud. “She wanted me to see.”</p><p>“And why do you think that was?” Remus asks in that professorial tone, the one he picked up from his secondary school teacher mum. Or maybe he comes by it naturally, a product of always being older than he’s supposed to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“She…she wanted me to take it seriously, I suppose. Or…I dunno. Teach me empathy.”</p><p>“How nice,” Remus says flatly. “Did it work?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When Sirius doesn’t say anything, just stands there feeling useless and confused, Remus continues in the formal tone from before: “It may have been inevitable, something like this happening. I’m grateful that it turned out to be as inconsequential as it was. I didn’t hurt anyone; it could’ve been much, much worse. I must be grateful.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>Grateful? </em>Who would be grateful, given Remus’ lot in life? “Moony, that…that’s not—”</p><p>“But I’m not happy with you,” Remus says, staring at his hands folded on his knees with heavy, tired eyes. “What you did, the responsibility you nearly put on me…I would’ve killed him. Someone would be dead, and it would be my fault.”</p><p>“No it wouldn’t! It wouldn’t be your fault at all, it’d be mine! I’d go down for it, not you, I’d take all the blame—” Feeling increasingly hysterical, Sirius says what’s sort of a joke and sort of not: “I’ll kill him for you, I don’t mind!”</p><p>It’s the wrong thing to say. Remus gets to his feet, bats one of the floating jars away, and crosses the chamber toward the exit. Heart in his throat, Sirius chases after him, catches him by the arm, lands a hand on his shoulder. “Hey, wait—”</p><p>Remus pushes his hands away. “Don’t.”</p><p>“What, I, I can’t—?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius doesn’t know what he’s asking, but Remus answers anyway: “No, I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Alright, I…”</p><p>But Remus won’t look at him. He turns away, a hand going to pull fretfully through his hair. “Of all the people in the world,” he mumbles, “it had to be you. I could’ve handled it from anybody, <em>anybody </em>else. Why’d it have to be you?”</p><p>Sirius has never been punched in the stomach. He imagines it’d hurt less. “Can I…can I just—”</p><p>“I’ve been thinking,” Remus says. He’s standing up straight again, he’s got his composure back, but he still won't look at him. “This relationship that we’ve got— I think it’s run its course.”</p><p>Sirius becomes very aware of his body, as though he were inside it, looking out.</p><p>“Run its course?” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yes, I think so,” Remus says, polite. “I think it’s time we ended it. It’d be better for everybody, in the long run.”</p><p>Maybe it’s the unearthly blue light, swimming dizzily the way it had the time they listened to a record and spilled their guts down here, like it had up on the Astronomy Tower the night Remus first kissed him, but Sirius has the sensation of being suspended, floating. He says, “I don’t want to end it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m sorry, but you already have.”</p><p>It’s as if Sirius were expecting something else to happen. It’s as if this is the part where the world comes crashing down around him, and the world is missing its cue. Disorienting, anticlimactic. He and Remus stare at each other, blinking, saying nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“So...what?" Sirius hears himself ask. "We just...go back to being friends?”</p><p>“We’ve always been friends. No matter what else we’ve been to each other, we’ve <em>always </em>been friends. That’s never changed.”</p><p>Standing there with his arms hanging limply at his sides in a room that’s gone airless, Sirius has never felt less like a cool, clever, popular Gryffindor. He feels small and stupid and helpless. The voice at the core of his being that says <em>go, fight, fight back</em> is smothered. It’s over, all’s lost, fighting will do nothing. Nothing he can do, nothing, nothing…But still it sounds like a challenge when Sirius bites out, “I love you.”</p><p>Remus looks at him, then he doesn’t. He runs a hand over his face, paces.</p><p>“And not the way I love Peter or James,” Sirius barks. “So no playing dumb and pretending you don’t know what—”</p><p>He stops a ways away from Sirius, hand over his eyes. “I know what you meant.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You just don’t give a shit.”</p><p>“I didn’t say that.”</p><p>“Nah, you didn’t say anything, that’s worse.”</p><p>“I haven’t got anything to say.” It’s muffled behind his hand.</p><p>“Try looking at me for a start, then!”</p><p>In a very small voice, Remus tells his hand, “No, I don’t want to.”</p><p>“Well, great. Real mature, Moony. What do you want from me, huh?”</p><p>The second hand creeps up over Remus’ face, his head bowed; they knot themselves into his fringe and pull. “I don’t know,” he mumbles, weak. “Maybe…maybe an apology? I don’t know, I…”</p><p>“Fine, I’m sorry!” It echoes in the chamber. “There, I’m sorry, alright? That good enough?”</p><p>Remus resurfaces. He doesn’t look calm anymore— he looks unhinged, and his voice is broken and strangled. “But you’re not really, are you? That’s the problem. There’s a part of you that will always be incapable of being sorry, because there’s a part of you that’s been there as long as I’ve known you that thinks hurting people is fun. There’s always going to be a part of you that’s violent and malicious and—and cruel.”</p><p>A second punch to the stomach. The muscles in Sirius’ face spasm and he fights to keep his mouth from trembling, he feels a hardness form in his throat. “Shut up.”</p><p>“Do you think I like saying that?” Remus cries, striding up to him with wild eyes. “It <em>hurts </em>me to say that! But I’ve got to, because I’ve got to come to terms with just what sort of a person you are before I <em>somehow </em>get deeper in this!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And what’s that?” Sirius tries to sound harsh but his voice gives out and cracks, buckling under the weight. “What sort of person’s that?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Not a good one.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It hurts too much to be real. In a mercilessly unmetaphorical way it’s agony, like his ribs would snap under the pressure. They never tell you to expect that, how <em>literal </em>it is. They never tell you how you’ll take it like a Blasting Jinx to the gut, all the wind knocked out of you. You feel it yourself at fifteen, and you think <em>oh, this is what they meant</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Fine,” Sirius pants. He comes up for air. He can’t breathe. “Yeah, fine, whatever, forget I mentioned it.”</p><p>Remus takes a step toward him with his hands raised, as if he’d reach out but can’t quite commit to it. “I don’t—”</p><p>“Nah, really, don’t mention it.” Sirius stalks over to the slide, waits for it to ripple into stairs. “See you around, <em>pal</em>.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He hears Remus shout after him as he climbs the stairs higher and higher, but eventually his voice fades away with the blue light. When Sirius reaches the top he throws open the mirror so hard that it smacks into the stone wall opposite with an ominous <em>crunch</em>. He swings it shut behind him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>There’s a long crack forked across the glass. It slices diagonally through Sirius’ face in the mirror, distorting it. For a moment he can do nothing but stare down his reflection: stunned, paler even than usual, split down the middle. Then, without his moving a muscle, the sound of breaking glass rings through the corridor as the whole mirror shatters. It crumbles into a thousand shards, a pile of glittering dust on the floor, and leaves a blank slab of wood behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It takes Sirius a second to figure out what happened, though it shouldn’t. He breaks things. He can’t help it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Glass crunching under his shoes, he leaves.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p> </p>
