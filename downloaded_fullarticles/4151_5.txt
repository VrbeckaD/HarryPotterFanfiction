    <p>Emma Dursley got up the morning of her eleventh birthday to her Mother's shrill voice yelling at her cousin to get up. Emma got up extremely worried. Harry's parents and her Mum had never gotten along. There had always been tension between the two sisters. Despite the fact that Petunia Dursley would never admit it, she was jealous of her sister Lily. Lily was the one that the Evans' family was so proud of. Lily with her red hair, green eyes, and talented ways.</p>
<p>The way that you heard Petunia Dursley tell it, Lily Evans Potter was nothing but a freak. One that needed to be locked up and never heard from again. When James and Lily Potter died in that car crash all those years ago, Petunia was ecstatic that she no longer had to live in Lily's shadow. That was until they got stuck raising their freak of a nephew, Harry. Emma always felt that it was unfair to punish Harry just because her Mum hated his parents. Emma made it her mission to make Harry feel like a part of family. She always managed to get him a decent present. When her Father locked him in his cupboard without food she would get up after her parents went to bed and got him food.</p>
<p>Harry, a pale, skinny boy of almost eleven years of age, appreciate all of her effort. Her and her cousin were more like brother and sister, rather than cousins. After all, Emma Dursley was the only one that ever denied her fat oaf of a twin brother anything. She told him no and she stood up to him constantly on the behalf of Harry. For that reason she was almost as unpopular as Harry, but no one dared to tease her about it. Dudley was never over joyed with the fact that she was on Harry's side, but she was still his sister. No one dared to harm her in any way. </p>
<p>The blonde haired, blue eyed, little girl was her Daddy's little princess, so she was just as spoiled as her older brother. Still she found no reason to act like a spoiled little brat like her brother. After getting dressed she walked downstairs and into the kitchen. Harry was at the stove cooking bacon. She smiled sweetly at him. "How are you today, J," she whispered to him.</p>
<p>Glancing around her room she didn't spot her Mother. She assumed Petunia Dursley was upstairs waking Dudley up for their birthday breakfast. "There is my little Princess. How are you this morning, sweetie," Vernon Dursley asked joyfully.</p>
<p>"Great Dad," she replied walking over to sit down at the table next to him.</p>
<p>The living room off the dining room was filled with presents for Emma and Dudley. Harry shuffled over to the table putting slices of bacon on each plate at the table. "Happy birthday," Harry mumbled under his breath.</p>
<p>Emma smiled at him before changing her face into a passive look. If Vernon Dursley had seen the exchange Harry would have been locked in the cupboard until he started school in the fall. Dudley and Petunia Dursley finally entered the kitchen, the latter of the two holding her hands over her son's eyes. Dudley and Emma looked only a little alike. They both had blonde hair and blue eyes, but that was where most of the resemblance stops. If Petunia and Vernon Dursley were completely honest with themselves Emma Dursley had gotten all of her looks from the Evans side. As a matter of fact she looked somewhat like Lily Potter herself. Petunia was careful never to travel down that road of thought herself, though. She knew that a part of her would resent her daughter, her precious daughter, just for looking like her aunt a little bit. </p>
<p>Dudley questioned, "How many presents are there?" </p>
<p><em>Uh-oh</em>, Emma Dursley thought. She knew that there was one or two less presents for Dudley this year because his presents were all expensive, but he was going to have a tantrum. "Thirty-six," said their Father happily.</p>
<p>Emma had less presents than Dudley, but that is what she preferred. Just as she predicted, in her mind, Dudley began to throw a fit. "Thirty six, but last year- last year, I had thirty seven," he bellowed angrily.</p>
<p>Their Mum stated, "How about well we're out today, we get you and your sister two more presents each?"</p>
<p>Dudley attempted the math, "So that'll be.."</p>
<p>Emma supplied, "Thirty eight for you. Sixteen for me." </p>
<p>Emma truthfully didn't want anymore presents, but she knew if she refused it her parents would be hurt and Dudley would look at her like she was insane. She didn't want that much attention on herself, not even from her parents. Just as they were finished up breakfast the phone rang. Mrs. Dursley got up and answered it. Emma watched her Mum as she talked on the phone and began to get more and more upset. Mrs. Figgs probably couldn't take Harry today, which was a disastrous outcome for the rest of the Dursleys. Emma was more than pleased at that development. Petunia exclaimed after she got off the phone, "Mrs. Figgs broke her leg and can't take the boy!"</p>
<p>Dudley began to wail, as he knew that he often got his way doing that. Emma rolled her eyes and he whined, "I don't want him to come!"</p>
<p>Vernon glared at Harry as they tried to figure what to do with him. In the end Harry had ended up going to the zoo for the first time, with his cousins and one of Dudley's friends. Emma and Harry walked behind the Dursleys as they beheld all the sights there were to see. "Oh, I want to go see the snakes," Dudley shouted. Emma and Harry followed slowly after their family. They were in no hurry for their companionable silence to be disrupted by the rest of the family. When the two cousins finally entered the reptile house Vernon Dursley was rapping his knuckles on the glass of the biggest snake in the room. </p>
<p>Emma, terrified of snakes all together, walked over to where there were a few lizard that were absolutely unsnake like. Fifteen minutes passed and she heard slithering behind her. She turned, only to scream when she saw the big snake headed right passed her and out the door. Harry was sitting on the floor and her parents were freaking out about Dudley and one of his dunderhead friends being somehow locked behind the glass enclosure where the snake had been. Emma's eyes widened as she looked over both her brother and her cousin. Once she was sure that they were both healthy she strode over there on shaky legs. </p>
<p>Hours later they finally arrived home after eating a quick dinner and dropping Dudley's friend off. It had taken them forever to get Dudley out of the enclosure and even longer for the manager at the zoo to apologize to them a million times. By the time they got home Emma was thoroughly annoyed. Her Father and Mother had yet again managed to blame and punish Harry for what had happened at the zoo. When he told them about how it was like magic, Vernon Dudley grew even angrier. Emma watched on sadly.</p>
<p>Well after her Mum and Dad fell asleep Emma laid in her bed wide awake. Sighing she got up to go check on her cousin. "Harry, you awake," she whispered at the door of his cupboard.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I can't sleep," he replied softly.</p>
<p>Emma opened the door and walked into the small cupboard. "I'm sorry about Mum and Dad," she apologized.</p>
<p>Harry groaned, "How many times must I tell you there is no reason for you to apologize?!"</p>
<p>Emma blushed and retorted, "They are my family I feel responsible for their actions."</p>
<p>Harry laughed and for a while they laid in his bed under the stairs completely content just basking in each other's presence. After a while Emma bid the slightly younger boy goodnight and went up to bed. </p>
