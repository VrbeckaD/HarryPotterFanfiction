</center><p>Things weren’t supposed to go this way. The lines weren’t meant to become this blurred. In times of war there were always two sides; a clear definition of right and wrong. The lines had been drawn in the sand, and those who stood with you, wands at the ready, were your brothers in arms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those across the line were your enemies. The wizards you had to fight, who stood against everything you loved and held true to your heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was never meant to be a gray area. There was never supposed to be a common middle ground.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There especially was never meant to be anything resembling love.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was ahead of her by a few years at Hogwarts. He was quiet, sullen and seemed to always be sitting off on his own, away from the other members of his house. Everyone seemed to give him a wide berth, staff and students alike. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yet for some reason, her eyes were always drawn to him. She found herself always scanning the corridors for the familiar hunch of his broad shoulders, or to spot the back of his head, bent as he scribbled furiously on some parchment during the evening feast. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Who’s that?” She remembers asking at breakfast during her first week. A tall girl with cropped blonde hair sits beside her, a third-year, Rey thinks. “Who?” She turns, her expression reserved and bored. “Oh, that’s Ben Solo.” She offers nothing else, and instead turns back to stabbing sausages with her fork.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ben Solo. It’s not much, but it’s a start.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’s in his fifth year when she’s in her third. That’s the same year she finally makes the Quidditch team. She plays seeker, and she loves it; the rush and thrill of diving for your snitch at the very last possible moment. Not to mention that she thrives off of the pressure. The seeker has the ability to make or break the game, depending on when the snitch is caught and how many points each side has.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The air has begun to turn crisp and cool, the leaves of the Forbidden Forest have just begun to change. She’s out on the Quidditch pitch, practicing dive after dive. The rest of her team have already turned in, calling it a night after a particularly grueling first practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She’s enchanted walnuts to fling into the air at random intervals. At first, it seems to work. She’s diving, catching each walnut time and time again. Except then she speeds up the process, and the walnuts begin to whip through the air, smacking her in her thighs, her shoulders, her face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Struggling against the assault, Rey reaches for her wand, drawing it from her pocket and blindly aiming towards the walnuts. “<em> Immobulus </em> !” She shouts to no avail. “ <em> Immobulus </em>!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The magic doesn’t work. Her spells either keep missing their target, or she’s lacking the concentration to conjure the magic. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She’s just flying now, her hands gripping the handle of the school-owned broom that she had been using since tryouts. It gets the job done, though it’s not exactly the definition of dependable. Still, she bobs and weaves, accelerating up towards the sky before tipping downwards into a nosedive, attempting to throw the walnuts off her trail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After all, the spell can’t last forever. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It certainly feels like forever, though. A slow drizzle begins to fall, but it’s not long before it’s coming down in steady, fat drops. Her body begins to ache, and she tries to tell her grip to relax, that she’s dodged bludgers that pack more of a punch than some bloody walnuts, and she’s played Quidditch in the rain. This is nothing. A minor discomfort. Yet, suddenly, the whole situation feels overwhelming. It feels like it's just all becoming too much, and as another walnut makes contact with her cheek, she lets out a sharp cry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point, the rain is falling so hard that Rey can’t decipher if tears are even falling from her eyes. She can barely see through the now heavy downpour. Reaching for her wand once more, her broom gives a lurch and she feels the wood begin to slip from her grasp.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Immediately, Rey dives after it, blindly reaching forward, not even trying to dodge the walnuts as they begin to pepper her body with stinging welts. She just keeps reaching, keeps straining her hand further and further, hoping to feel the smooth feeling of ash beneath her fingertips. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Instead, she gets a smart smack from a walnut, square in the back of her hand. She lets out another cry, as Rey tries to pull her broom out of the dive. She’s nearly at a standstill now, just hovering in the air as defeat washes over her. The walnuts continue their assault, and Rey takes to just batting them away, knowing her choice of defense is utterly useless. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em> Immobulus </em>!” A loud, booming voice echoes through the air, clear despite the sound of thunder rumbling in the distance. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A dome of light is cast over the Quidditch pitch, rendering everything in the air still, as if it had suddenly been frozen in time. Walnuts and raindrops alike are deemed immobile, and for a moment, Rey forgets the pain of her hand, and instead can merely just look around, gawking at the beauty of it all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The raindrops instead look as if they had been rendered from glass, just hovering in the air. She can’t help but to reach out and touch one, to gently proud a droplet with the pad of her finger, and is surprised at how soft, and, well, <em> wet </em> it feels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey almost has to laugh. Because of course, it would still be wet. It wasn’t truly frozen, not in the muggle sense of the word, where the temperature was involved. Instead, it was just suspended, paused in its descent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Suddenly she turns her head, remembering the reason for the spell to begin with. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That’s when she sees <em> him </em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, it would be Ben Solo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His hair is soaked, sticking to his forehead and his cheeks. He’s wearing muggle clothes; a dark jumper and jeans, no jacket in sight. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What are you doing out here?” He barks with authority, and Rey only then remembers how he had been announced as a prefect that year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Suddenly, she has a gut feeling that she’s about to lose her house some points.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s not curfew yet.” Rey blurts out as she lands, her feet touching down on the damp earth. “It’s not even that late out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re unsupervised, alone in the rain-” His eyes flicker down to the broom in her hand. “Using school property.” He raises his wand. “Accio broom-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em> No </em>!” Rey’s grip tightens on the thick handle of the old Cleansweep model, and instead of it flying out of her grasp and into his outstretched hand, she is instead dragged, her heels digging into the softened ground, leaving a trail of uprooted grass in her wake. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before she can blink, Rey is standing before him, her chin tilted and her fingers still curled around the broom, her knuckles growing pale. Except now his hand has joined hers, just half a finger’s length away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It looks as if they’re about to break out into a game of tug of war over the worn broomstick that would probably not get more than a couple of galleons in Diagon Alley. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ben raises an eyebrow in response.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I just- I mean-” She pauses, huffing out a breath as she shifts her weight from one foot to the other, her socks feeling damp beneath her soaking wet canvas sneakers. “This is the best of the school brooms, alright? There’s only a handful of us that have to use the school-issued ones for Quidditch, and most of them are wonky. They jerk you around, they don’t listen and they’re just- they’re shit, okay? Except this one isn’t that bad and I just-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey’s rambling. The words have poured out of her mouth and her cheeks begin to flush. All she wants to do is for the earth to open up beneath her feet and swallow her alive. She would rather face the Whomping Willow than to go through this torture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Slytherin’s first match is on Saturday.” He cuts her off, and Rey is so taken aback, that all she can do is nod her head. Her chin is still tilted upwards, and belatedly she realizes, this is the closest they have ever been.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It makes her body feel flustered and warm. Her palm once more begins to sweat, and Rey adjusts the grip on the broomstick, only to feel her finger brush against his.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She swallows, practically makes an audible gulp, as a shiver runs down her spine. All she wants is to look away, but she finds her own eyes fixated upon his and his burning stare.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s against Ravenclaw.” Ben carries on, as if nothing had happened. But then Rey realizes that nothing <em> did </em> happen. Their knuckles touched. The same thing happens on a daily basis to her in the Great Hall, when she’s fighting for the last Yorkshire pudding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her brow furrows as she opens her mouth, about to ask him to get to the point already, to dock points if he’s going to take them from her house.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But instead, he simply lets go of the broom and steps back. Instantly she feels the loss of his presence, and the dampness of her clothes feels cold.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You should get to the hospital wing. Have Madame Che take a look at your face.” He taps his cheek, and instinctively Rey raises her hand to her own. Sure enough her fingertips run over a small bump beneath her eye. It’s tender to the touch, the skin most likely already a mottling of purplish hues. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He turns to go but Rey takes a few hasty steps forward. “Wait-” She calls after him, belatedly realizing she has no idea what she wants to say. “Aren’t you-” She fidgets, biting the inside of her cheek and pushing wet strands of hair away from her forehead, her cheeks. “Aren’t you going to dock points? Give me detention?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His footsteps pause, and he turns to face her, a smirk twitching at the corners of his lips. “Why would I?” He counters back, and Rey can only gape at the teasing nature of his tone, at the way his face begins to relax, as he treats her like they’re old pals. Like this is a typical Thursday night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re not out after curfew, you’re not breaking any rules, Niima.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then he laughs. It’s quiet, a small, dry chuckle beneath his breath as if he’s finding amusement in some private thought of his own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He walks off of the pitch, and simultaneously, the spell is undone. Raindrops and walnuts fell to the earth with a great tremor, rendering Rey caught in the downpour once more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But Rey finds she doesn’t care as she scans the grounds of the pitch for her wand, or even after she has found it, as she begins to pick up each and every walnut by hand.. All she can focus on is the sound of his voice saying Niima, and the fact that he knew her name.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Their paths don’t cross again for a long time. She still always looked for him, always kept her eyes peeled for a mop of dark hair and a pair of golden brown eyes. But she had friends and classes to keep her busy, Hogsmeade trips on the weekends and Quidditch practices late into the evenings, three times a week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yet some nights, as she lies in bed, the dormitory dark and full of the sounds of soft snores and rhythmic breathing of her roommates, all Rey could think of was the way her surname had sounded rolling off his tongue, the shake of his shoulders, and the upward turn of his lips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She would fall asleep with nothing but images of Ben Solo, immobilized raindrops, and walnuts floating through her mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He graduates during her fifth year. She’s swamped with O.W.L.'s, has a heavier course load, and it seems that all everyone can think of, students and professors alike, is life after Hogwarts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Except, Rey doesn’t want Hogwarts to end. She doesn’t want to walk away from her first true home, the only place she had ever felt accepted and safe, in exchange for the uncertainty of impending adulthood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where would she even go? She needed money to rent a flat, needed a job to have money. Would she be booted back to the muggle world come June, meant to live one more year in foster care until she was eighteen, and thus aged out of the system?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It seems no one has any answers for her. Her friends keep reassuring her time and time again that they wouldn’t let that happen, while her professors tell Rey time and time again that she has a promising future, and not to fret.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>None of their answers are concrete. None of it means anything, so finally she breaks down and makes an appointment with the Headmistress.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If anyone could help her, if anyone could give her a proper answer, well, it would be Professor Organa.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As she approaches, a statue of a gargoyle rotates, revealing a spiral stone staircase. Taking this as a sign that she should come up, she begins her slow ascent. Only around the first turn, does Rey hear the sound of approaching footsteps, each one hasty and heavy. A figure approaches her, head bent and brow furrowed, not watching where they’re going.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His shoulder bumps into hers, and Rey’s bag jostles from her shoulder, books and quills and spare bits of parchment flying everywhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fucking hell-” Rey recognizes that voice and she freezes as her eyes snap to the boy with broad shoulders and a mess of dark hair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He doesn’t apologize, but instead bends over and begins to quickly gather her things up. Rey drops to her knees, her balance awkward on the staircase as she mimics his actions, trying to shove as many things as she can back into her bag.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I thought the stairs were opening for me-” She begins to blabber, trying to erase the thick tension in the air with her useless words. “I didn’t know someone was coming down-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, well, watch where you’re going next time, Niima.” He mutters, his words as sour as his expression. She pauses, once again taken aback by the fact he knows her name, that he uses it so casually as if they were a part of each other’s lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She frowns at his tone, her hand hovering over a discarded quill. “Watch where I’m going? You’re the one who came barreling into me-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You were blocking the entire staircase!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I told you, I didn’t know anyone was coming down. Maybe if you actually picked your head up-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They bicker, shooting arguments back and forth, all while both hastily reaching for the last of her things. There’s a jar of ink left, and Rey’s hand darts out to grab it, but Ben’s too quick. His larger fingers curl around the bottle. He picks it up, but doesn’t hand it over.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They both stand in unison. Rey adjusts the strap of her bag over her shoulder, her other hand outstretched, waiting and impatient.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She’s about to say something, a biting remark about if he’s been kissed by a dementor, when the sound of a woman’s voice causes the insult to catch on the tip of her tongue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Miss Niima, I’m ready for our meeting now.” Professor Organa calls from her office above. Rey’s cheeks flush, and she can only wonder how much of the exchange their headmistress had heard. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shooting Ben a final glare, she turns on her heel. “Yes, coming Professor!” She calls, as she makes her way up the rest of the staircase, leaving Ben Solo to just stand there in her wake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She forgets all about the final bottle of ink, doesn’t think about it anymore. She certainly does not see him looking down upon the small jar for just a moment, before he slips it into the pockets of his robes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In fact, Rey doesn’t remember the bottle of ink at all until her final night at Hogwarts, when she stumbles into her dormitory after the end of year feast, and sees a brand new bottle of ink on top of the trunk at the foot of her bed. She smiles, thinking it’s a gift from one of her roommates or friends, but does not think to ask them about it. No, instead she slips it into her trunk, amongst her textbooks and cauldron, to stay safe during her journey back to Kings Cross the next morning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>War breaks out during her seventh year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>No one sees it coming, yet in retrospect, the signs are all there. A wizard name Snoke had been stirring trouble for the Ministry for ages, slowly gaining followers and power throughout the years. No one had seen it as a true threat though. No one had known what he was capable of, of the death and destruction he would inflict upon the wizarding and muggle worlds alike.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It makes Rey itch to graduate, to get accepted into the Auror program, and begin her training. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She studies harder than she ever had in her life. Each headline of the prophet, discussing another outbreak at Azkaban or another life taken, is the fuel to the fire that grows in the bottom of her belly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Quidditch is canceled for the year, and though there are shouts and boos of protest coming from her fellow students, Rey can’t help but feel a bit of relief. That’s one less thing on her plate, one less activity to take away from studying for her N.E.W.T.’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She ends up receiving O’s and E’s on nearly everything. Professor Skywalker helps her draft an application to the Auror program, and she waits for weeks, eyes scanning for the familiar sight of her white owl, Do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’ll get in.” She turns her head to see Professor Skywalker himself, passing by her house table as he makes his way to the back of the Great Hall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I had three O’s and only two E’s-” She begins to protest, but is silenced by the older man’s hand on his shoulder. “Rey, you’ll get in.” He repeats, his voice firm and his piercing blue eyes holding a strong gaze that left little to argue with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In retrospect, she should have listened to him, because he was telling the truth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maybe the Ministry was desperate for new recruits. Maybe they wanted to bulk up the number of Aurors to help with the fight against Snoke. Whatever the reason, Rey didn’t care. She was accepted. She was in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She graduates from Hogwarts and within a few days, she is settling into her new apartment, a small flat in a quiet neighborhood in London, set up by the Department of Housing within the Ministry. She has two roommates, a pair of sisters who also work for the Ministry. Paige and Rose Tico are opposite in personalities, yet also both courteous and nice. They make for the perfect roommates, the type who are easy to talk to yet don’t overstep any boundaries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not that she sees them much, because once training begins, Rey feels that all she is doing is brushing up on potions, running through training exercises and being pushed to the brink of exhaustion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It doesn’t help that the war is growing, slowly inching closer and closer to home. Some have gone into hiding, others have fled the country. Hogwarts is still open, but she overhears that the number of students attending is down for the first time in decades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything drives Rey to work harder. The Auror training is being accelerated, and so many of her fellow cadets begin to drop out, unable to cope.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s for the best,” one of her instructors says. “If you can’t handle this, then this really isn’t the right career path for you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The remaining members of Rey’s class graduate by the spring. There’s no ceremony, no after-party. They’re all too exhausted to even think about celebrating. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides, tomorrow the real work begins.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She has been an Auror for two years when she sees his face again. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s during a briefing at work. They’re discussing someone high up within Snoke’s ranks. His newly appointed right-hand man. Kylo Ren, he’s called, and they finally have a face to go with the name. New flyers have been made, each with the face of wanted members of the First Order, including Snoke’s latest protege. She skims through them, her eyes raving over the moving pictures, taking in their gaunt faces, looking for any physical features that separate them from the rest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But as she rifles through the pages, she feels her blood turn cold and her heartbeat stop at the sight of a familiar face moving across the parchment,  his mouth wide, and his features contorted into a silent scream.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She gasps, the sound ringing out throughout the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few heads turn, their gaze curious as they peer over at Rey. She feels her face flush, and she instantly scrambles to hand the flyers to the person beside her. Except for his. She pulls the piece of parchment underneath the table, and folds it, before tucking it into the pocket of her robes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The moment she can, Rey slips from the room. She keeps walking through the ministry, her pace quick and her mind still reeling. Ducking down a small, nearly forgotten corridor, she leans her back against the cool, tiled wall. After making certain that the coast is clear, then and only then does she remove the flyer from her robes with shaking fingers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> ‘WANTED’ </em>It read in bold, thick letters. Her eyes began to scan the rest of the letters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> KYLO REN - KNOWN MEMBER OF THE FIRST ORDER - SUSPECTED MURDERER </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her fingertips brush against his moving picture, and Rey is taken aback by the surge of strong emotion that she feels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So he’s Kylo Ren now. Ben Solo, no more. Another victim, another casualty of war.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> This is stupid </em> , Rey can’t help but to think. <em> She’s </em>being stupid. It’s stupid to get this worked up over, what? A boy she had a crush on, once upon a time? Someone that she’s had two interactions with, that she hasn’t heard about, hasn’t seen in years…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It feels as if her heart was being squeezed, as if there was a foot being pressed upon her chest, adding more and more pressure until she finds it hard to breathe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because despite the wanted poster, despite the evidence looking at her straight in the eye, she just can’t believe it. She can’t imagine the boy who had saved her from walnuts, who had knocked over her bag, but stopped to help clean up her things, who she had spent so much time looking for, out of the corner of her eye and thinking about could be… could be…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>KNOWN MEMBER OF THE FIRST ORDER - SUSPECTED MURDERER</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her eyes read over the bold letters, tracing over each and every one. Slowly she pushes herself off the wall, gives a small shake of her head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She can’t be doing this. She can’t feel pity, can’t fall apart because a childhood crush went down the wrong path. He is the enemy and she… she is the line of defense for the wizarding world. She had taken an oath, had sworn to protect those who could not protect themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey takes one last look at the poster before she pulls her wand from her robes. “<em> Incendo </em> .” She murmurs, and a small flame shoots from the tip of her wand. It licks at the edge of the parchment, before it quickly begins to eat away, devouring the promise of a reward, the words ‘ <em> DANGEROUS! DO NOT APPROACH! </em>’ and finally, at the face of the man himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey watches as his moving image is rendered into nothing but flecks of ash. She watches his plush lips disappear, followed by his mole spattered cheeks. She watches the flames as they consume him, bit by bit. And finally, when there’s nothing left but a pile of ash on the stone tiled floor, Rey tells herself that enough is enough. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The past is the past.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ben Solo is as good as dead. Kylo Ren stands in his place now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She points her wand and cleans up the last of the mess.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A curfew has been set in place, and most nights Rey is sent out to follow leads about those not abiding by it. It’s mostly boring work. Lots of apparating and watching. Lots of waiting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But that’s alright. Rey has had practice at waiting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One night she’s perched on the flat of a roof to a nearby building, keeping her eyes peeled at the London docks. Their informant said someone was trying to deal illegal dragon eggs, breaking curfew as well as breaking a handful of other laws.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, she has nothing to do but wait, eyes peeled despite how heavy her lids feel. Her sleep had been disrupted by an emergency call to the Ministry, for a briefing that Rey is pretty certain could have been summarized in an owl, or even a floo powder meeting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The sound of a loud <em>crack </em>is heard from somewhere behind her. It jolts her from her thoughts, and she turns, wand at the ready, her eyes narrowed as she tries to see across the dimly lit rooftop. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She’s debating over whether using <em> lumos </em>will blow her cover or not, when a man steps from the shadows, lowering the hood of his cloak, his hands held up, empty as if to say ‘I come in peace.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em> Professor Skywalker </em>?” Rey baffles at her old teacher, and she has half the mind to run to him and pull him into an embrace. She’s taken a couple steps forward, a smile spread across her cheeks before she remembers her training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She raises her wand once more, as she studies the man wearily. “What were the last words you said to me before I left Hogwarts?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He smirks in response. “I believe I told you to trust your gut, and that you were going to make a great auror.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey’s body relaxes, as her arm falls slowly to her side. “Professor Skywalker it’s so good to see you-“</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He raises a hand again, as if to silence her. Though his face is still kind, there’s a hardness in his eyes. “Rey, I need to talk with you. It is of the utmost importance-“</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Then let’s talk!” She interrupts but he shakes his head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We need a more…. <em> secure </em> location. Somewhere we can’t be overheard.” He pauses. “When is your next day off?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tuesday. But that’s three days away-“</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He shakes his head, glances over his shoulder before he moves closer to Rey. “No, no that will work. I’ll get the details to you. But Rey, just-“ He reaches out, his hands taking hold of her upper arms, his grasp tight. “You can’t trust anyone.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then he steps back, and apparates away with a sharp crack, his voice still echoing in her ears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> You can’t trust anyone. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey doesn’t know what she’s expecting. An owl perhaps. Maybe for her old Defense Against the Dark Arts professor to appear in her fireplace. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What she doesn’t expect is for one of the other aurors, a man with curly dark hair and an easy grin, to slip her a piece of folded parchment, as if they’re passing notes in the corridor at school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She takes the paper but turns her head, her brow furrowed in confusion. The man, who Rey thinks is named Dameron, offers her a wink before he turns to disappear into the crowd of bustling Ministry employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey makes a beeline for the restroom. She clambers into a stall, the door clanging shut behind her, and with shaking hands, she unfolds the piece of yellowing parchment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The words, <em> Number 12 Grimmauld Place at 9 pm </em>are written in a messy scrawl.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Grimmauld Place. Grimmauld Place. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But that’s in… London, over by the Borough of Islington. Do they want to meet her in London?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She’s too busy thinking over the logistics of it all, that she misses the paper suddenly curling up, as it catches fire. The flames spread, devouring the scrap of parchment until they lick at the tips of her fingers. “Ow!” Rey shakes her singed fingertips, before sucking on them, trying to soothe the burns away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The sound of a toilet flushing beside her jars her from her thoughts. Remembering where she is, that she still has a job to do, paperwork to file and assignments to report on, Rey moves to leave the stall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But even hours later, as she’s hunched over her desk, quill in hand, she’s still musing over the note. Part of her is tempted to try and find Dameron, the auror who had passed it to her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shaking her head, she shifts in her seat. No, she just needs to be patient. Tuesday will be here soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The rest of the workweek drags on. Rey’s feeling on edge by the time Tuesday rolls around. Her hands won’t stop shaking, and she drops her favorite mug, the ceramic breaking with a crack as it collides with the wooden floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s fixed with a simple <em> repairo </em>, and Rey fills it with steaming hot chocolate and piles on extra marshmallows. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She tries to keep busy. She does things the muggle way, doing her laundry, folding it and putting it away by hand rather than enchantment. Same with the dishes and the sweeping. It keeps her hands occupied and her mind busy, and most importantly, it fills up her time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soon enough the sky is growing dark and the hands on the clock are indicating it's a quarter to nine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m going out!” Rey calls to Rose, who's seated at the small kitchen table, piles of books all around her. Paige, she assumes is still at work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Where are you off to?” Her roommate asks with a smile, and Rey rushes to respond, the answer having already been rehearsed and ready on the tip of her tongue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Just out to grab some drinks with old friends from school.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Have fun.” Rose wishes her before tilting her chin down to resume her reading.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey slips out of the apartment, and once she’s a couple blocks away, she ducks into a dark alley to apparate across the city.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Grimmauld Place did not look welcoming in the slightest. The street was growing dark, it’s gloomy atmosphere aided by the grimy fronts of the brownstones that lined the street. The streetlights cast an eerie, yellow glow and Rey found herself unable to ignore the gut feeling that was telling her to run, to flee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But despite Professor Skywalker’s warning, Rey trusted him. After all, it had been Luke who had recommended the auror career path, back during her earliest days of Hogwarts. Luke who had helped coach her, who let her study in his office when her dormmates proved to be too loud, the common room too rowdy, and the library too crowded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had been the teacher she had confided in when she felt uncertain of her place in the wizarding world. The teacher that she had turned to for help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She could trust Luke Skywalker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slowly, she walks down the street, her eyes scanning over the dull, brass numbers that were attached to each front door. Eight, nine, ten, eleven and… thirteen?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Frowning, her footsteps slow. She ducks down, pretends to tie her shoelace all while glancing towards the row of townhomes again. Sure enough, ten, eleven and then it jumps right over twelve, to number thirteen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her mind begins to race with options. The house could be under the fidelius charm, hidden unless the Secret Keeper gave away its location. Or maybe it had another enchantment. Maybe she needed to try and apparate directly to the location, though that always proved to be tricky. It definitely increased the odds of splinching.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Or maybe this was a trick, a trap. Maybe she should have trusted her gut instinct. Maybe she shouldn’t have come here at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Looks like rain.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey looks up at the sound of the familiar voice. Slowly she stands, brushing her palms against the side of her legs. The sight of Luke Skywalker washes away some of her concerns, though she can’t shake the feeling that’s causing the hairs on the back of her neck to stand at attention.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah.” She agrees, tilting her face up towards the sky. The sun has long ago set, but the sky has been covered with thick, dark clouds. She turns to say something else, only to see Luke’s retreating form.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moving after him, Rey’s question falls silent on her tongue as she notices a strange device that looks like an oversized cigarette lighter, in the professor’s hand. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Is that a-” Her words trail off, as Luke flicks his thumb over the mechanism. One by one, with every click, the lights from the lampposts shoot out, disappearing into the deluminator. Luke must have caught her quizzical glance, for her offers up a small shrug, followed by a single word, “Muggles.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey watches and waits, her impatience growing. Only once every streetlight has been extinguished, does Luke turn towards her. “You got my message, I’m assuming? That’s what led you here.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Silently she nods. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Alright, Rey. I need you to think about those words. I need you to focus on what was written on that parchment and nothing else.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So she does just that. She thinks of the messy scrawl, of the slant of each letter and the way they had been written in haste, each word on a slow uphill climb across the parchment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Number 12 Grimmauld Place. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When she opens her eyes, she’s surprised to see that there’s an additional townhome. No longer do the house numbers jump from eleven to thirteen. No, now number twelve stands in its rightful place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It looks identical to the other houses, with the same dark and grim exterior. More questions have begun to fill her mind, but Luke barks that they’re late, and he’s leading the way forward, through the small iron gate and up the front steps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He knocks his wand against the solid, black door that perhaps could use a lick of paint. The sound of a multitude of locks unlocking themselves can be heard, before the front door swung open, allowing a small stream of light to shine through.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Inside.” Luke mutters before he’s shoving Rey forward, his hand firmly in the center of the shoulder blades. She stumbles inside, hears her old professor fumbling with something behind them, which Rey assumes is the deluminator, before he too is stepping into the house, the door shutting firmly behind them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They stand in a foyer of an old house, with small airs of grandeur such as the chandelier hanging above their heads, and the intricate design of the wooden staircase banister. The floors gleam with black and white marble and portraits line the walls. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once again Rey turns to ask Luke questions and once again she finds him walking away, already halfway down the hallway. He disappears into an adjacent room, and for once, Rey doesn’t hurry after him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Instead, she takes her time, breathing in every small detail that she can. Most of the portraits are moving, mumbling and talking about himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Disgrace.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Just like his grandfather.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Powers too strong. Bloodline was corrupted. Knew she should have never married a-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Would have drowned him as a young babe, just at the sight of his ears. Nothing good could have come from a boy with ears-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As she approaches the room in which Professor Skywalker had disappeared into, Rey hears voices, but of a different kind. She rounds the corner, walks through the doorway, and is met with a group of individuals, all crowded into a small sitting room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A quick survey reveals some familiar faces. There’s Mon Mothma and Gial Ackbar, both professors that Rey had while at Hogwarts. The auror that gave her the note is there too, what’s his name Dameron leans against the bookshelf beside the fireplace, posture at ease, a smirk on his lips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are other witches and wizards from school, those that Rey knew by face and name but not much else. Finn Storms is seated on the couch, who had been a year ahead of her, but in Ravenclaw house. Beside him is Kaydel Ko Connix, who had been in the same year as Rey, but in Gryffindor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Welcome, Rey.” The words flow through the air, warm and maternal. She turns, her gaze drawn to the woman who had spoken.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Professor Organa-“</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re not a student anymore, Miss Niima. You may call me Leia.” The older woman offers her a warm smile, and Rey gives a small nod of her head, though the idea of calling her former headmistress by her first name is perhaps the scariest thing to come out of this whole night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slowly Rey turns, looking around the room. She still didn’t understand why she was here. She didn’t know what was going on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I feel as if I’m missing something. Like everyone else is in on the joke except for me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Rey,” Luke steps forward, places a hand on her shoulder. “I would like to introduce you to the members of the Resistance.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her eyes snap to his. “The Resistance?” She had heard the name mentioned before. But they were a group of vigilantes, of wizards trying to take the law into their own hands and getting in over their heads during the process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Rey.” Now Leia is moving towards her. “We would like you to join us. To become part of the Resistance.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over tea and biscuits, Rey is told about the Resistance. She’s given the group’s history, told of how it had been formed decades prior, during the first war.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We fought against a dark wizard named Palpatine.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ve heard about him.” Rey shifts in her chair. “During our auror training, they discussed how Palpatine tried to overthrow the ministry for his own dictatorship. He worked with another wizard, someone who called himself Darth Vader.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She took a sip from her mug, missing the quick look that Luke and Leia shared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Snoke was a follower of Palpatine,” Leia explains. “He somehow slipped through the cracks, made himself scarce and began to rebuild.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And now he’s a threat, one as big as Palpatine’s empire, perhaps even worse.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So what is it that you want me to do?” Rey asks, fingers curling around the body of her mug. “I mean, I’m already an auror. They have us out following whatever leads we can, doing stakeouts.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Luke leans forward, his elbows resting on the tops of his knees. “We believe Snoke has infiltrated the Ministry. We just don’t know how high up it goes. Besides, the Ministry’s hands are tied, or at least that’s how they act. They’re putting out fires after they’re started. They think of Snoke as a threat, but either not one they’re taking seriously or they have a rat feeding them the wrong information.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s a lot to process, and Rey swallows, her mind racing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Didn’t you think it was odd, that they closed Auror recruitment?” Dameron adds, adjusting his arms across his chest. Poe. She had learned that his first name was Poe. “We’re at war, yet after your class graduated they stopped taking applications. We’re stretched thin, and we’re not even fighting. We’re following cold leads and being led on wild goose chases.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Ministry said that they had to redirect the funds-” Already her mind was reeling, and her words were already sounding like, well, an excuse. And not even a good one at that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pieces were slowly falling into place. It was as if a thinly veiled fog had been lifted from her mind, and she was realizing how foolish she had been, how quick to believe every excuse the Ministry had fed its employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking from Poe, to Luke, to Leia, Rey shifts forward until she’s seated on the edge of the sofa. “What do you need me to do?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her days just become busier at that point out. Between actual shifts at the ministry and now her newly added meetings with the Resistance, Rey begins to feel stretched thin. By the third week of pulling double duty, Rey feels like a slug merely going through the motions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She’s fallen asleep twice at her desk twice, dozed on the couch after Resistance meetings, and missed not just a lunch date with Rose, but the rescheduled lunch date as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You need to cut it out.” Poe Dameron tells her, hovering by her desk on a Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Rey insists, her head ducked and her shoulders hunched as she focuses on the report in front of her. The same report that she has been working on for the past two hours and only has about four sentences written. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a moment the only sound between them is the scratching of Rey’s quill upon the parchment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re going to get noticed. You’re burning your candle at both ends, and it’s obvious.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey juts her chin but remains quiet. What is there to say? She knows he’s telling the truth, but she’s too stubborn to admit defeat. Not yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally she glances towards him. “I’ll take care of it. I’ll figure something out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Poe seems to study her for a moment, his arms folded across his chest. He offers nothing more than a small nod before he turns and leaves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually she figures out a groove. Her body adjusts to the extra workload. She begins to sleep at Grimmauld Place some nights after meetings, to save against the commute home. Rose and Paige  begin to tease her, wondering if she’s seeing someone. Rey keeps her responses purposefully vague. Dealing with her roommates' sly comments is an easy out. She doesn’t have to think of a cover story, because one has been provided for her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Work at the Ministry has, for the most part, stayed steady without much change. They keep getting ‘leads’, which the Auror teams investigate, but they never seem to lead to anything. Rey can’t say she’s not thankful for the peace and quiet of her assigned stakeouts. They’ve become routine at this point, with every little excitement or action.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In fact, Rey stops waiting for something to happen. She knows nothing ever will.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At one point, her team is sent into the northern mountains of Scotland for a three-day mission. They mostly spend time camping out and taking shifts to watch the ground below. Their tip had said there was a werewolf camp nearby that Snoke’s followers were trying to recruit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course they weren’t actually supposed to <em> do </em> anything. They were to hang back, observe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It made Rey feel restless, made her fingers feel twitchy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They took shifts at keeping watch while others slept for a handful of hours here and there. Rey offered to take the first shift, and then she took the second, not bothering to wake up Pammich for her shift. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Which of course went against the rules. But Rey was wired. She wasn’t going to sleep, so she might as well let her teammate catch a couple more hours of shut-eye. Maybe by then, Rey would be ready to crawl into her sleeping bag and close her eyes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The moon shines bright in the sky, waxing gibbous in shape. Close to a full moon but not quite. They would be the last group to have a shift out here. It was getting too close to the full moon, which would make the werewolf camp’s proximity an additional risk that the Ministry wasn’t willing to take.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey couldn’t blame them for that. After all, they weren’t doing anything out here other than taking a glorified camping trip on the Ministry’s galleons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She stands up, wanting to stretch her legs. The fire is growing dim, and she knows she could just use her wand, could mutter a spell and the flames would rise up again. But it feels lazy and useless. Besides, Rey wants to actually do something with her time. There’s nothing happening in these woods tonight. The least she could do is gather some more firewood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slipping out of their makeshift camp shrouded with cloaks and protective charms, Rey begins to wander through the trees. She’s cautious, careful to tread lightly and not to make too much noise. Slowly she picks up twigs and sticks, stowing them in the crook of her arm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It reminds her of her childhood. How all the foster kids in the city would get bused out to the countryside for a couple weeks of summer camp during their break from school. It wasn’t as good as going to Hogwarts, but it made the sweltering heat of July a little more bearable when there was a lake to jump in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nostalgia begins to trickle through her mind. Rey thinks of the marshmallows they had roasted, all the stupid songs they had sung. She thinks of the friends she made, and despite how close they go, Rey always felt a distance between them, because she was always hiding something, always vague about details of the ‘really boring boarding school’ in which she attended for the majority of the year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She bends over, picks up another stick and then another. She follows a trail of fallen twigs, collecting them and musing over how many more she needs. Glancing around, she realizes that she’s wandered farther from camp than she intended. She had been pushing the rules by leaving the safety of their campground, now she’s just being careless. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Still clutching the bundle of kindling, Rey turns and begins to try and retrace her steps. She couldn’t have gone that far, could she? She looks around, trying to ignore the way her pulse has begun to race, how the beginning feelings of panic have slowly begun to sink in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> This is stupid </em> , she thinks. <em> You’re a blood auror. You’re trained to take on dark wizards, to defeat dark magic. You can’t be afraid of a walk in the woods. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey hears something snap, maybe like a branch underfoot. She turns her head, glances behind her in the dark.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She walks straight into something thick, solid. For a moment she thinks it must have been the trunk of a tree but no, it had been warm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rey whips her head forward and is caught off guard by the sight of Kylo Ren.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course she recognizes him right away. Despite the longer hair, despite the facial hair he now sports, despite the now sunken appearance of his eyes, highlighted by shadows and bags, making his face somehow appear thinner, the angles of his jaw and nose sharper.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She opens her mouth to scream, but nothing but silence comes out. She drops the twigs, makes a mad dash for her wand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But he’s faster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em> Immobulus </em>.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His wand is pointed towards her, and all she can take in is the slight shake of his hand before her body goes completely still, frozen for a moment in time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just like the raindrops. Just like the walnuts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The fact that he had used <em> that </em> spell, the fact that it now felt strangely personal, is enough to make her blood boil. Her body might be immobile, unable to move, unable to blink or even twitch a finger but her mind? Her mind was <em> reeling </em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He says nothing. For a moment he just studies her, his eyes scanning over her suspended body. Her feet are firmly on the ground, her arm is stuck in the midst of a motion. She had been so close to reaching her wand from its hiding place, inside of her inner jacket pocket. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now she’s a sitting duck. Worse than that, she’s a dead giveaway that there could be more people in the woods. All it would take would be one Unforgivable Curse, and she would be leading the fox straight into the hen house.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Minutes pass. They drag on, feeling like hours as Rey wracks her brain for a strategy, for something, anything that she could do. There’s wandless magic, but that’s rare. Even the top aurors sometimes struggle with it, not to mention that it can be hard to control, can easily spiral and cause a bigger mess than the one she’s in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But what other choice does she have?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She tries to focus. Tries to think about the counter curse, about moving her body. Maybe if she starts with something small. If she could at least unfreeze her hand, she could get her fingers to touch her wand…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He opens his mouth, steps forward as if he’s going to speak. Suddenly she’s back at Hogwarts, a giggling school girl who's distracted by the pretty, older boy that’s mysterious and aloof. He’s giving her a crumb, and suddenly she feels open and willing, ready to gobble up the entire cake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The sound of distant voices distracts them both.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His head whips around, and had Rey been capable of movement, she was sure hers would be doing the same. The noise is too far away, Rey can’t tell if it’s her colleagues or his. Perhaps it's neither, and they’re closer to the werewolf camp than she had realized.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She goes to shout for help. It’s a knee jerk reaction, a reflex. But her lips do not move. No sound is heard. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’s walking towards her now, his strides long and quick. Rey’s eyes begin to dart around in panic. Is that the tips of her fingers can she feel? Or is it just the adrenaline coursing through her veins, playing tricks on her mind because she can’t do anything else.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sorry-” She swears she hears him mutter beneath his breath before he raises his wand once more. He says something, another spell but his voice is so low she cannot decipher the words. She’s trying to figure out. Her mind and heartbeat are both racing, the sound of her pulse is drumming in her ears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then it all goes quiet as everything turns black.</p>
  </div>
