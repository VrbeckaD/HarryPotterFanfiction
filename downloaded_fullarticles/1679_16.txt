    <p>
  <span>Heat, heat, heat, everything is thick, agonizing heat, killing the flowers, burning the flesh, melting the brain, numbing the senses...</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Okay, maybe he is exaggerating a bit in his reactions, but the truth of the matter is that Remus Lupin loathes the heat. He is blessed enough to be living in a place where the temperature seldom rises above fifteen degrees and the sun rarely shines. Most people complain about that, but Remus is all too happy to walk around in one of his countless old-man jumpers, tucking his hands in the too-long sleeves, his cheeks red and his breath frosting from the cold.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now, however, the cursed month of June has come around, and in the small fishing village of Fenneltown, West Cornwall, the sun is shining and the temperature has reached an outrageous thirty degrees.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Every other child and teenager is out enjoying the sun, bathing in one of the beautiful beaches nearby, having made them their second home as soon as school ended. Remus, however, is trying hard to concentrate on “The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes” in his small room, the blinds down, his shirt off, in vain seeking relief in the small fan his parents have recently purchased.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The words swim in front of his eyes. After sticking his face directly in front of the fan to no avail, he thinks </span>
  <em>
    <span>sod it </span>
  </em>
  <span>and decides to head for a swim as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which goes to show just </span>
  <em>
    <span>how </span>
  </em>
  <span>dramatic his state is, because Remus normally refrains from going to the beach. For one, despite his applying copious amounts of sun cream everywhere, he always manages to go red as a lobster after minimum exposure, having his milk-white skin to blame for that. For another, he is self-conscious about his thin, scrawny body, especially in comparison to most boys his age, anxiously waiting for the summer to show off the fruits of their year-long workout.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Last but not least, he is rarely in the mood to interact with his classmates; he has nothing against them, of course, always being helpful and polite, and they have nothing against him: they have always treated him nicely. However, he can't say he considers any of them a friend. Where others prefer to socialise or play football or engage in other normal teenage activities, Remus has the interests of an old man: he prefers to read, take long walks in the narrow streets of Fenneltown, or listen to his father's records. While the other kids are frantically listening to the soundtrack of “Saturday Night Fever” or the latest Donna Summer single, he is more partial to the likes of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Fleetwood Mac.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This prevents him from finding common interests and thus forming friendships with any of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now, however, he disregards his timidity in favour of a plunge in the hopefully cold water of the sea. He puts on his faded red, long swimsuit, completely disregarding the new fashion of impossibly tight men's swimwear that reveal things in the lower areas he is </span>
  <em>
    <span>better off unaware of, thanks.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After covering himself with sunscreen to the point where he becomes white as a ghost, putting on a plain white t-shirt, his flip-flops and his too-big-for-his-face sunglasses, he takes his book with him and informs his mother of his plans.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hope seems surprised but pleased with Remus' decision and she wishes him to</span>
  <em>
    <span> have fun, sweetheart!</span>
  </em>
  <span> with a hopeful smile on her face while peeling a potato in their tiny kitchenette, her face glistening and her hair haphazardly sticking out of her bun.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus sighs, wishing that his mother would be more subtle about her worrying over Remus' social life. He knows her intentions are good-natured, but he is perfectly content with the life he is leading. Most people his age dream of leaving Fenneltown and moving to a big city, but Remus envisions himself staying there, taking over his father's small bookshop, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lupin's Lunar Library</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and taking care of their many bookshop cats.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After saying goodbye he steps outside, almost instantly regretting his decision to do so as the sun hits his face. He navigates between the small white houses of Fenneltown with the brown roofs almost on autopilot, saying hi to Augusta Longbottom, the owner of the bakery, on the way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All of Fenneltown's picturesque, almost identical houses are built around a beautiful harbour with small fishing boats of various colours in it, swaying lightly with the breeze. This harbour is the village's main attraction and greatest pride, and it occasionally brings the wandering tourist to Fenneltown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eventually, he reaches the largest beach just outside of town, with smooth, golden sand. This is what has given the beach the unoriginal name “Golden Coast”. It is the one most people his age prefer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sure enough, almost everyone he knows is there. Many are swimming, some - girls mostly - are lounging in the sun, trying in vain to get a tan on their pale skins. There is an impromptu game of beach volleyball going on. Mrs. Longbottom's son, Frank, and his girlfriend Alice are snogging passionately on a blue towel in the sand, as is usual for them ever since they got together earlier this year.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus advances towards a relatively unoccupied corner in the back of the beach. People start to gradually notice him and some can barely conceal their surprise, but everyone greets him politely regardless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus reciprocates and spreads his ridiculous red-and-gold towel on the sand, taking off his shirt and leaving all his things there. He goes to the edge of the beach, takes off his flip flops and plunges headfirst in the mercifully cold water, exhaling in relief as he emerges.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After that, he swims toward the ocean in long strides</span>
  <b>. </b>
  <span>Despite having no inclination towards sports, Remus has been blessed with considerable strength and endurance, a fact that has been noticed by his schoolmates and, he thinks, has played a part in them respecting him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Having sufficiently cooled down, he goes out, puts his flip flops on again and heads to his towel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before he can get there, he is stopped by Peter Pettigrew.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Peter is the closest thing Remus has to a friend. His parents' grocery shop is right next to their bookshop, and they have known each other since they were little babies, having been born with a difference of mere months. Consequently, Peter is the one Remus spends time with during school breaks and the one he pairs up with in school projects.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He is perfectly content associating with Peter. Sometimes though he feels like there is something, a deeper connection or understanding that is missing from their relationship, which prevents him from calling this friendship. The shorter, plumpier, sandy-haired boy's interests are limited to pining over girls who never give him a second glance and wanting to belong, to be one of the popular kids, if of course anyone could suggest that in a school with a total of sixty students there are popular kids.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite that, Remus greets him amicably. “Hello, Peter. How are you enjoying your newfound freedom?” he asks the boy. They finished tenth grade just a week ago, and even Remus was delighted in the prospect of having free time to read books he likes, spend time in the bookshop, and quite simply relax. Sadly, he hadn't taken the heat into account.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am enjoying it just fine. Swimming all day, sitting around, on my way to total boredom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus chuckles. “A noble cause, that. Sitting around to the point of being bored of it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It is evident that Peter cannot tell if Remus is sarcastic or not (he has never been perceptive in that sense), so he changes the subject. “Fancy seeing you here, though. What made you finally decide to join us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The fact that my small room is slowly reaching the temperature of hell on a hot day. I couldn't stand it anymore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, you did good. Come sit with me on my towel. I even have an umbrella.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus casts a longing glance at his book towards the back of the beach but follows Peter, partly because a little company every now and then doesn't </span>
  <em>
    <span>hurt, Remus, stop being so secluded </span>
  </em>
  <span>and partly because the idea of an umbrella sounds very appealing under the morning sun.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He follows Peter to the middle of the beach, where he has his things, and he gratefully sits under his umbrella. He observes that Sam, a likeable, incredibly tall guy who has graduated this year, has put his towel close to Peter's trying to benefit from the shade that slowly moves his way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sam indifferently greets them with a small smile and a wave, and resumes dozing off on his stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, I have something crazy to tell you about,” Peter says as they settle down. Remus resists the urge to roll his eyes, because the thing Peter usually deems as crazy are anything but. “I'm all ears,” he says nonetheless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, yesterday Anna, like the little brat she is, stayed out with her friends until late.” Anna is Peter's little sister, who has just finished primary school. “They were wandering around the village and screeching like little monkeys, y'know they reckon that just because they'll go to high school now they have a free pass to do whatever they want, mum was </span>
  <em>
    <span>livid </span>
  </em>
  <span>when she came home.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus winces, thinking of Mrs. Pettigrew's high-pitched voice, completely unexpected due to her plumpy, like her son's physique, screaming at Anna. “I mean, she had it coming, mum never let </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span> stay out when I was her age...” Peter stops babbling. “Anyway, what I wanted to say is, while they were wandering around, they passed by The Mansion.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This time, Remus </span>
  <em>
    <span>does</span>
  </em>
  <span> roll his eyes. “Oh, come on Peter, don't tell me you’ve started believing this haunted house crap now.” The Mansion, as everyone has always called it, is a house in the outskirts of the village. Though it isn't quite a mansion, it is bigger and more ancient-looking than the others, thus having earned that nickname. This house has been empty for as long as anyone can remember, and people would believe it was abandoned, if it weren't for the stony-faced, silent workers that come on April 1</span>
  <span>st</span>
  <span> every year, doing maintenance work for three days, and then leaving as suddenly as they came.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Many a villager have tried to bribe information from these workers about the owners of The Mansion, attempting everything, from striking up friendly conversation and offering them cookies, to inviting them to dinner. They, however, always politely but coldly decline their offers, never revealing anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>By now, everyone in the village has accepted resignedly that they're never going to learn the truth, but that hasn't stopped them from theorising about it. Remus has heard everything over the years: that The Mansion belongs to Masons, that some disturbed rich person is hiding corpses in it, that the government keeps it as a safehouse just in case something happens.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Over the years, of course, ghost stories concerning the place have emerged, by people who don't have a basic understanding of the fact that the wind produces sound. Most people claim they don't believe them, but Remus sees them hurrying their step when they pass by at night. He himself was always mildly curious about the ownership of this house, but he never let it consume him, and he found the “haunted house” stories downright laughable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just hear me out for a bit,” Peter protests. “Normally I wouldn't believe anything this twat says but...” he pauses.” Remus, she says they saw a light.” He stops for dramatic effect. Remus frowns. “And what's more, she says they heard laughter. Hysterical, manic laughter more terrible than anything you have ever imagined! Now, I know what you're gonna say,” Peter hastens before Remus can say anything, “but my sister is not </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>delusional, and she seemed scared out of her mind, she's not that good an actress either.” Remus' frown deepens, while he's struggling for something to say.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe the workers have come back again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But there's no reason for them to do so!” Peter's voice dangerously approaches screaming. People near them are now listening to the conversation. “There was no damage that could justify that! Even when this storm three years ago had destroyed part of the roof, they only came to fix it next year! And they never stay </span>
  <em>
    <span>in </span>
  </em>
  <span>the house, always in Mrs Moore's inn! And besides, none of them has ever screamed like this!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus is astonished at how uncharacteristically well-thought Peter's argument is, betraying that he's thought of this before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come on Pete.” Christine, a girl in their year with bleached blonde hair, square glasses and a bright pink swimsuit intervenes. “What you're saying is bullshit. Your sister probably came up with this story just to mess with you.” She rolls her eyes, blowing the piece of gum she has been audibly chewing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Peter reddens in frustration, trying in vain to retort.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I saw the light too.” comes an answer on Remus' right. Everyone whips their head at Sam, who is still lying down, blinking lazily. “I was passing by The Mansion last night, and all the windows were lit up. I even heard conversation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Everyone stays silent after that. No one can doubt Sam, who is always sensible, down to earth and popular with everyone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck,” says Alice, who has stopped snogging with Frank.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Sam yawns, “I bet we'll find out what this is about sooner or later.” He stretches his arms and closes his eyes again.</span>
