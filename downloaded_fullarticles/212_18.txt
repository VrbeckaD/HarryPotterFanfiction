  <em>Malleus Maleficarum Lupus Black. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>That was what the tapestry read, the enchanted print embossed below a nondescript etching of him as a baby, his only distinguishing characteristics being his black hair and green eyes.</p><p>
  <em>(A sharp contrast to the emotionless figure of his father above him, with his own black hair and gray stormy eyes. A pristine Black heir.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius Orion Black, current resident of Azkaban). </em>
</p><p>Yet at six years old, nearly seven, as Mal stood in the parlor of Number 12 Grimmauld Place for the first time, his name on that woven tapestry had only summoned burning tears to his eyes.</p><p>Perhaps it was a silly thing to cry over. </p><p>But no one had ever called him <em>Malleus</em>.</p><p>Never.</p><p>He had always just been <em>Mally,</em> for as long as he could remember.<em> "Little Mally Black!" </em>As Uncle Prongs would sing-song, twirling him about on his shoulders. </p><p>Not until he met his biological grandparents and they saw someone else entire where he stood. </p><p>He would never <em>forget or forgive</em> what they did to him. </p><p>The taste of his own blood in his mouth, congealing in the back of his throat, as <em>Crucio!</em> rang out like a bell’s toll, over and over again until he could hear it no longer. Often times it was his own screaming that rendered him deaf in the end. Ribbons of massacred flesh would be cut into his skin, leaving him broken and bloody. </p><p>When he misbehaved or at least, they thought he had... they would petrify him and dump him into the second-floor dumbwaiter, leaving him there for days, until he'd thought he was on his last precious mouthful of air.</p><p>He would never forget the way that they had looked at him, <em>with shame and disgust,</em> as he’d first stepped off Platform 9¾ on his first Christmas hol, with a yellow and black striped tie looped around his forehead and a badger crest on his blazer. </p><p>They’d told him that even his <em>blood traitor</em> of a father would have been ashamed to have a <em>useless Hufflepuff</em> for a son. </p><p>
  <em>(He stopped wearing his house colors in public after that). </em>
</p><p>None of his accomplishments were ever worthy of their praise. </p><p>But Mal supposed that he did <em>win</em> in the end.</p><p>He outlived them all, lived through all the years of their abuse and senility.<em> (Spending their last few years as an amalgamation of his dead uncle and incarcerated father, depending on who they were most interested in torturing that day).   </em></p><p>He buried them when he was thirteen years old, apathetically tossing fistfuls of black dirt into their shared plague pit of a grave.</p><p>
  <em>Toujours Pur.</em>
</p><p>It was inscribed upon their tombstone. </p><p><em>Ha,</em> he was sure that they would make very pure bones, hidden beneath the thick feted earth, where they could never harm anyone ever again.</p><p>He spit on them once, for good measure.</p><p>Mal Black, the last descendant of the patrilineal Black line.</p><p> </p><p>He stole away to Surrey that same night. </p><p>To rescue a little boy with messy black hair and green eyes that were so alike his own. </p><p><br/>-X-</p><p><br/>When Mal blasted his way through the painted front door of <em>Number 4 Privet Drive in Little Whinging,</em> all thirteen inches of his cypress wood and thestral hair wand pointing out in front of him, he found himself face to face with little Harry Potter for the first time in six years.</p><p>His mismatched eyes grew wide, and he lowered his wand on reflex, feeling his chest tighten the longer he stared. </p><p>Mal had thought nothing about the great bumbling oaf of a man who had waddled his way down the stairs after the little boy, his useless broomstick of a wife in tow. He didn't search the man's face for any sign of worry or compassion, or search the woman's face for hints of his Aunt Lils.</p><p>All Mally did was bend down, until he was eye to eye with his little cousin, fighting the tears that threatened to well up there. </p><p>“Hello, <em>Prongslet.</em> I don’t suppose you remember me?”</p><p>A confused Harry had only shaken his head, and his hair was mussed enough from sleep to obscure the scar that Mal knew would be on his forehead.</p><p>He had looked so much like Uncle Prongs in that first moment, stumbling downstairs for tea in his Quidditch pajamas, his glasses slipping down his nose. </p><p>“My name’s Mally, I’m your cousin.”</p><p>That caught the boy’s interest. “Like Dudley?”</p><p>The horse-faced woman stomped her foot on the stairs, spitting something about propriety that would have made old Walburga Black proud. </p><p>“Wrong side, Har. But <em>yeah.”</em> He'd smiled and hoped that it didn’t look sad or misplaced upon his face. It had been awhile.</p><p>His heart was lightening though with every moment that passed, because the longer he stared at Harry, the more he saw hints of the baby boy that he had once dangled a snitch in front of. He saw more than a mix of James and Lily Potter, he saw Harry.</p><p>“Do you remember anything at all? About Uncle Prongs and Aunt Lils?” He winced then, clearing his throat and shaking his head. “Sorry, I mean… your Mum and Dad?” <em>Do you remember our family?</em></p><p>Harry cocked his head again, studying him, then shrugged, almost as if he was uncomfortable with talking about it. “No, but I…" His voice grew softer, more hazy, as if someone had rebuked him for saying the words before. "I do remember a green light and someone screaming…” </p><p>Oh.</p><p>
  <em>Oh Harry…</em>
</p><p>Mal swallowed his feelings and stepped forwards without a moment of hesitation. He dropped to his knees and wrapped his arms around his little cousin, all in one smooth move. The surprised child resisted him for a moment, attempting to pull away and stiffen as if he hadn’t been held like that in a very long time, before he finally succumbed and laid his head on Mal’s shoulder with a little sigh. Suddenly Harry's demanding fingers folded tightly into Mal's clothes, holding onto him with all he had, as if to keep the older boy from pulling away. He needn't have worried. Mal was never letting him go again.</p><p>“Harry, do you trust me?”</p><p>The little boy nodded into his neck. </p><p>“Then let me take you home.”</p><p> </p><p>They walked from that place, hand in hand, like the brothers that circumstance had made them. </p><p><br/>-X-</p><p><br/>That was when Mal made his Unbreakable Vow, raising his wand high above the Potters’ graves. Little Harry sleeping atop a bench nearby, as they waited for the Knight Bus. </p><p>
  <em>“I solemnly swear to always take care of Harry Potter to the best of my ability, to make sure that he is looked after and loved, no matter what.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I promise, Aunt Lils and Uncle Prongs, I promise.</em>
</p><p>It was all he could do for them. </p><p><br/>-X-</p><p><br/>The happiest days of Mal’s childhood were spent with his real family. </p><p>He would forever recall sitting behind his Uncle Prongs on a narrow broomstick.</p><p>He had always loved flying high and utterly terrifying his uncles.</p><p>The little boy had released his grip with his thighs, so that he was dangling upside down by his locked ankles on the broom, thirty feet above the ground. Uncle Prongs had nearly snapped in two as he tried to flip around and save him, shouting out a mispronounced cushioning charm. But Mal was laughing so hard that it was difficult to breathe, his hands outstretched to the ground below. <em>(He would tell every story to Harry, everything that he remembered). </em></p><p>He could still hear his Uncle Prongs’ voice shouting down to his Dad: <em>“He’s a born Seeker, Pads! Bloody mental that is!"</em></p><p>
  <em>(Uncle Prongs was right. Mal would use that same trick on the Quidditch pitch a handful of years later, to save his boyfriend Charlie from an impromptu meeting with the ground. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You're bloody mental, Mal!" </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Bite me, Dragon Tamer!").</em>
</p><p>For almost seven years, Mal knew their love. </p><p>He knew the gentle kisses and hugs of his Grandmum and Granddad, not his grandparents by blood, but his grandparents where it mattered, <em>(they who had gathered him up as a baby, the son of their surrogate son, left on their doorstep and then cared for him like their own).</em> He knew the smell of being wrapped up in his Uncle Moony’s surprisingly muscled arms, his cheek pressed up against the scratchy wool of a beige jumper, as they read aloud together. He knew the feeling of his Dad’s whiskery kisses on his cheeks and boisterous laughter. He knew his Uncle Wormy’s best jokes and puns. He knew his Auntie Lils’ bad taste in music and remembered the way that she would always tug him into an silly dance in the kitchen to a Carpenters record. </p><p>And he remembered Harry as a baby.</p><p>His little baby cousin, with messy jet black hair and bright green eyes that matched his own. </p><p>Mal used to make funny faces over his bassinet, hopping up and down, to make him laugh.</p><p>Harry laughed like Uncle Prongs, his whole body quivering from his lashes to his toes. </p><p><em>“Well, Prongsy,”</em> He'd once heard his Dad say as he bounced Harry on his knee. <em>“We’ve both got our doppelgängers, I wonder if Rem’s next?”</em></p><p>Uncle Moony had rolled his eyes, <em>“Funny, Pads,”</em> as he pressed a kiss to Dad’s smiling lips.</p><p>Mal couldn’t remember a time when he had been happier. </p><p>Which was odd, considering that their world was at war at the same time. </p><p><br/>-X-</p><p><br/>There was one autumn afternoon when the fear slipped through his bubble of childhood naivety, back when Mal was six years old. </p><p>He had been playing with Harry in the little garden adjacent to the Potters’ home. The leaves had been changing color on the rustling trees above them and Mal had tossed up a few leaves that had already fallen, making them dance over Harry’s head with quick bursts of magic, watching the little baby reach up with his chubby hands to try and catch them. </p><p>Mal didn’t notice how far they had wandered, until he’d heard shouting in the distance and saw his Uncle Prongs charging out towards them, an unreadable expression on his face. <em>(It was terror). </em></p><p>That expression was then mirrored on his own face, as his uncle seized him by the arms, hard enough to make him bruise, and snatched up baby Harry at once. </p><p><em>“Mally, what are you doing?!”</em> It was obvious now, that Uncle Prongs’ voice had been loud and brusquer than he’d meant it to be. Mal couldn’t remember a time before, when Uncle Prongs had ever even raised his voice, and certainly never with such emotion in it. “You know that Harry can’t be out here, <em>get inside now!”</em></p><p>Instead of obediently running inside like he should have, Mal had frozen where he stood.</p><p><em>“Now,</em> Mally!” Uncle Prongs had insisted and it pushed Mal over the edge. He’d started to cry, with big hiccuping sobs that shook his entire lithe frame, thin arms wrapped tightly around himself. </p><p><em>“Mally…”</em> His uncle had reached towards him with a surprised coo, but Mal was off, racing towards the nearby forest instead.</p><p>Years later, he could still remember the look of anguish on his Uncle Prongs’ face, especially when the man realized that he couldn’t follow him.</p><p>“Puppy! <em>Mally!</em> Come back, I’m <em>sorry!”</em></p><p>Mal didn’t stop. </p><p>He ran and ran, tripping over brambles and tearing up his knees on sharp jutting pieces of root and stone, until he'd reached a rushing river. It was an angry sort of river, with steep stony cliffs on either side and dark rapids below. Part of him was scared of the water and how unfriendly it seemed, but the other half of him wanted to get as far away from Godric’s Hollow as possible. So he listened to that little voice inside of him, the one that told him to go as fast as he could. </p><p>Just as he was about to jump for a branch that was hanging about halfway between the cliffs, a hand stopped him. </p><p>An icy hand, that gently wrapped around his bicep, holding him tightly in place. </p><p>Mal had whipped around at the shivery sensation. Only to see a thin and willowy girl standing before him, with large almost hollowed eyes and wearing a long tattered cloak. Her long dark hair was fluttering about in a wind that wasn’t there. She'd watched him solemnly, unblinking. She didn’t let him go. </p><p>“Don’t cross that river.”</p><p>She'd had an accent that he couldn’t place, her voice was low and rough when she spoke and it called to something deep inside of him. </p><p>“Go back to Harry, he needs you.” There was no inflection in her voice at all. It was cold and emotionless. </p><p>Of all the questions Mal could have asked next, all he said was: “Aren't you going to cross? Can’t I follow you?”</p><p>The girl had smiled, but in a way that made her even more frightening to behold. <em>“Sixteen,</em> my son.” She had whispered, her voice catching on the breeze. “I gave him sixteen.” But despite the gravely tone of her words, her fingers reached out to brush his cheek. </p><p>Then she tore away from him, loathly, and walked across a bridge, one that she had formed with a wave of her skeletal hand. She didn’t look back at him again. </p><p>Mal had watched as the edges of her dark cloak slid, almost translucent, against the jagged stones of the cliffs, he had waited for the fabric to snag. </p><p>But it never did. </p><p>She simply vanished. </p><p>In the next second, he was practically tackled by a large black dog, one that vigorously licked him from head to toe, then dragged him back to the Potters’ home by the back of his shirt, like a puppy carried by the scruff of his neck. From that day onward, there was always a white streak of hair on the left side of his head and his left iris was always little paler than his right. </p><p>The side that she had touched, warning him. </p><p>
  <em>Sixteen years. </em>
</p><p><br/>-X-</p><p><br/>It was his Dad who had tucked him into bed on Halloween night of 1981, a common enough occurrence, complete with a gentle kiss on his forehead and a hand that lingered in his windswept black hair for a moment too long. </p><p>“Where are you going, Daddy?”</p><p>Mal remembered asking him, his eyelids already drooping, his little hands fumbling against the soft sheets. His Dad had only shaken his head. He was still smiling, but it was a pale thing, certainly dimmer than his usual bright grin. “Full moon’s out tonight.” <em>Oh</em>. Mal’s body had flooded with understanding, his Dad was going to help Uncle Moony. </p><p>The worry for his uncle must have shown plainly upon his face, because his Dad had only bent to press another kiss to his forehead. “Don’t worry so much, Pup. I’ll be back in the morning and Moons will be just fine, you’ll see.”</p><p>Mal had forced himself to nod for his father's sake, although sleep didn’t come easy that night. “Can we make his favorite tea for brekkie?” Mal had lisped, a pale compromise for the suffering he knew his uncle so often experienced. But his Dad had nodded. </p><p>“I'm sure he'll love that… Goodnight, Pup.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Daddy. Tell Uncle Moony I love him.”</p><p>"Of course, baby."</p><p> </p><p>He never came back. </p><p> </p><p> </p>
