    <p>September First, 1962</p><p>"Black, Bellatrix," the stout professor standing up at the front of the Great Hall called.</p><p>Straightening confidently, her black curls shining in the glow of the enchanted candlesticks above as they tumbled down her back gloriously, Bellatrix made her way over to the stool where the Sorting Hat waited to be placed upon her head. Nervousness did not come, like it often did for new first year students.</p><p>She was a Black, after all. Her fate was already decided.</p><p>Her parents expected a letter home by morning with the news of her sorting into Slytherin. Her mother had informed her casually over that morning's breakfast that the possibility of being burned off the family tapestry was very real if she was sorted into any other house.</p><p>"Don't forget, the other houses happily accept Mudblood filth. You're a Pureblood, and a Black. Make us proud, Bellatrix."</p><p>So she sat prim and proper, legs together and her hands neatly folded on her lap as Professor Johnson placed the hat upon her head. It obscured her view of the rest of the Great Hall.</p><p>A soft voice whispered in her ears, startling her briefly before rolling her eyes at the waste of time this was.</p><p><em>I am a Black, you old mangy hat. Obviously I will be in Slytherin</em>, she thought, annoyed now at the growing silence.</p><p>"The Black family is one of tradition. I see that you have much to prove, and will do what you must… Brash, and confident you are, yes Gryffindor would certainly help you foster that…"</p><p>She panicked, frozen to the core. Gryffindor? She would be disowned without second thought.</p><p>
  <em>Slytherin! I must be Slytherin!</em>
</p><p>"Are you sure? Gryffindor could be the home you have longed for… No? Then I suppose, it must be SLYTHERIN!"</p><p>The hat was lifted off of her head. With a deep breath, she gingerly took the step down from the dais and headed over to the side of the hall where green and silver banners were hung over one of the long tables.</p><p>Polite applause followed her over, taking a seat beside an empty spot beside one of the older students. He ignored her, focusing his attention back on the sorting of the remaining first year students.</p><p>Haughtily, she kept her back straight and ignored him right back. As the sorting continued, she silently vowed that she would make him regret ever doing so. That someday soon, she would hold the power she rightly deserved. She swore it to herself, that her placement in Slytherin would never be questioned by anyone.</p><p>She squashed any surfacing question about what a life in Gryffindor would have looked like as a student was sorted into it, shutting it down completely.</p><p>She smiled softly to herself, believing full heartily that she was in the right house for her. After all, she was a Black. She was Pureblood. And now, she was a Slytherin.</p><p>She relished the opportunity to prove her place.</p><p>
  <em>Slytherin.</em>
