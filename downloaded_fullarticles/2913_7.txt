    <p>Summer before Sixth Year</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Impedimenta!” James said, pointing his wand at me. I flew off my feet, even as I was diving to my wand. Other people turned to watch, of course they did. Snape Taunting was James and Sirius' favorite sport, so people were bound to be entertained. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I lay on the ground, panting. That last spell had knocked the wind out of me, almost as sharp as one of my father's fists. James and Sirius walked up, their wands pointed at me. </em>
</p><p>“<em>How did the exam go, Snivelly?” James asked, a sneer in his voice. </em></p><p>“ <em>I was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment,” said Sirius viciously.”There'll be great grease marks all over it, they won't be able to read a word.”</em></p><p>
  <em>Several of the nearby people laughed, perhaps they thought it was funny. I tried to get up, though it was difficult. The spell held me fast. </em>
</p><p>“<em>You—wait,” I panted, staring at them. I loathed them so, I hated how much they tormented me, and what for? “You—wait...”</em></p><p>“<em>Wait for what?” asked Sirius, as cool as ice.”What're you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us?”</em></p><p>
  <em>I lost my temper then, trying to curse them even though my wand was ten feet away. </em>
</p><p>“<em>Wash out your mouth,” James said, raising his wand once more. “Scourgify!”</em></p><p>
  <em>Instantly my mouth was full of disgusting flavored froth. I could feel the bubbles building, rolling out, coating my tongue. I choked, gagging on the flavor. I spat, desperately trying to clear my mouth of the bubbles and the taste. </em>
</p><p>“<em>Leave him ALONE!”</em></p><p>
  <em>Lily stormed up from where she had been sitting by the lake. She tucked one strand of her hair behind her ear. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>James turned towards her, lowering his wand slightly. </em>
</p><p>“<em>All right, Evans?” James asked, trying to sound more mature. I nearly snorted, then remembered the soap bubbles filling my mouth. That would have been unpleasant. </em></p><p>“<em>Leave him alone.” Lily said again. Even I could hear the loathing in her voice. </em></p><p>“<em>What's he done to you?”</em></p><p>“<em>Well,” James began, as if trying to think up an answer,”it's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean...”</em></p><p>
  <em>People nearby watched, although I was concentrating on moving slowly towards my wand, if James was going to take his eyes off me, then he would get what he deserved. </em>
</p><p>“<em>You think you're funny,” Lily said, glaring up at James.”But you're just an arrogant, bullying toerag, Potter. Leave him alone”</em></p><p>“<em>I will if you go out with me, Evans,” said James quickly. “Go on... Go out with me, and I'll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again.”</em></p><p>
  <em>I continued to inch towards my wand, spitting out suds as I did so. I was going to have to gargle for week to get the taste of that out of my mouth. Maybe if I had a sip of the Firewhiskey that Lucius sent me for Christmas, it would clear the taste out of my mouth. </em>
</p><p>“<em>I wouldn't go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid,” Lily spat back, angry. </em></p><p>“<em>Bad luck, Prongs,” Sirius said, looking back at me.”OY!”</em></p><p>
  <em>He had shouted just as I grabbed my wand. I jabbed my wand at James, thankfully this spell I could do silently, since my mouth was still dribbling bright pink bubbles. A gash appeared on his cheek, spattering blood everywhere. James spun about, his arm flinging his wand up. With another flash of light, I was hanging upside down by my ankle. My robes fell over my head, and I felt a chill wind on my legs. I closed my eyes for a second in mortification. I hadn't finished patching my pants, and so hadn't worn them today. Of all the days for James to hang me upside down. I could hear laughter and cheering coming from around me. The loudest ones laughing were James, Sirius, and Peter. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lily said, “Let him down!”</em>
</p><p>“<em>Certainly.' I heard James say, as I fell towards the ground. I collided with it, not being able to catch myself. I quickly got my robes in order and stood up, pulling my wand up to aim. </em></p><p>
  <em>Sirius flicked his wand at me,”Petrificus Totalis!” and I fell over, unable to catch myself.</em>
</p><p>“<em>LEAVE HIM ALONE!” Lily shouted. She had her wand out now, and was pointing it towards James and Sirius.</em></p><p>
  <em>They looked at it with respect, which was a good idea. Lily was wicked fast with her wand. </em>
</p><p>“<em>Ah, Evans, don't make me hex you,” James said, warily.</em></p><p>“<em>Take the curse off him, then!”</em></p><p>
  <em>James turned towards me and muttered the countercurse. </em>
</p><p>“<em>There you go,” he said, as I struggled to my feet again,”you're lucky Evans was here, Snivellus__”</em></p><p>
  <em>I lost my temper. “I don't need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!”\</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lily blinked. “Fine,' she said, her voice as cold as ice. “I won't bother in the future. And I'd wash your pants if I were you, Snivellus.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I felt a pang in my chest when she called me that. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>All of the sudden the scene changed. I was outside the Gryffindor Tower, and Lily was standing in front of the Fat Lady.</em>
</p><p>“<em>I'm sorry.” I said, desperately.</em></p><p>“<em>I'm not interested.” she said, coldly. There was no spark, or compassion in her eyes. </em></p><p>“<em>I'm sorry!” I said again, despairing.</em></p><p>“<em>Save your breath.”, she snapped back at me. </em></p><p>“<em>I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.” she said, her arms wrapped around her middle.</em></p><p>“<em>I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just --”</em></p><p>“<em>Slipped out?” Her voice was pitiless. “It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can even understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends – you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?”</em></p><p>
  <em>I opened my mouth, but remembered the confidances I would betray, and the loss of patronage that might result. I closed my mouth without saying anything. </em>
</p><p>“<em>I can't pretend anymore. You've chosen your way, I've chosen mine.” She turned to go.</em></p><p>“<em>No-- listen, I didn't mean--” I said, reaching out.</em></p><p>
  <em>She whipped back around. “--to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I struggled to explain, to defend myself. But she was right. The look of contempt on her face as she turned back and climbed through the portrait hole. I had lost her, forever. </em>
