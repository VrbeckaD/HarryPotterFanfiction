    <p>Harry could barely hear past the roar in his ears as Fudge tried to pronounce summary judgement only to be stopped by Dumbledore's late arrival. They had barely gotten past the snide banter of political power plays when Harry's magic slammed into place. The surge in magic saturating the room pinned everyone in their seats, forcing Dumbledore to his knees with a loud <i>crack</i> of instantly bruising bone meeting stone, with Harry's shear <i>want</i> to be believed.</p><p>"I have had it with all of you treating me like a squeaky chew toy," Harry's voice growled out darkly, shocking the room. "First you arrange to leave me with magic hating muggles who attempt to <i>beat</i> the magic out of me even after I supposedly save your sorry arses from some stupid Dark Lord. Then you wait until I am bloody <i>eleven</i> to try and tell me that magic exists, no proof beyond minor transfiguration left to be manually cut away by muggle healers and a shopping trip. Something which both resulted in a vicious beating from my so-called relatives and loss of <i>any</i> food for a <i><b>week</b></i>! Next when I figure out that the same damned Dark Lord you were all so happy about being gone is in The <i>School</i> and try to warn you, you all decide that I am being a foolish child about wanting to keep him away from the <i>philosopher's stone</i>. This forces me to stop him practically <i>on my own</i> with a few people who I <i>thought</i> were my friends. Next I practically <i>beg</i> not to go back to the beatings and no food for the summer, offering to work as a damned <i>house elf</i> so long as I can stay and you <i>still</i> send me back! An' that's only first goddamn year! Enough is enough! No more beatings, no more <i>torture</i>, no more attempts on my life every goddamn year! Since my dad saved Snape's life in school over Sirius' stupidity I'm betting he still owes a life debt. I'm calling it in. Professor Snape is now mine and he will act as my guardian until I reach whatever age you lot consider is adult. We are also <i>leaving</i>. I will <i>not</i> put up with being tortured for another <i>day</i>, much less year, under your care. I warned you about Voldemort because he decided it would be fun to play with me and try to kill me again in the graveyard and every other time we've run into each other. I'm done. I wash my hands of all of you. If Voldy wants you lot so bad he can have you. Hell, at this rate if he asks me to join him again like in first year I'd probably say <i>yes</i>!"</p><p>Hell, Harry had only learned about the Werewolf prank because Lupin had a nightmare over it after they were all put in the infirmary for Dementor exposure after that full moon at the end of third year. Enough was enough. Either they treated him with basic human decency and actually gave him enough food to eat or he wasn't going to even try to play nice.</p><p>Harry stood up from the chair as his magic pulsed... truth, Truth, TRUTH, <i>TRUTH</i> into their skulls and walked out the door of the court room. He completely ignored the pandemonium he left behind and focused on getting to his most snarky Professor in one piece, damn the underage magic rules. They had a bank to get to and goblins to ask for sanctuary.</p><p>Another surge of Harry's magic as he physically left the court room tripped the lock down magics, trapping everyone inside as he headed for the lift. The magic of the lift sensed his barely restrained fury and decided it was best to get him out of there as fast as possible. Since the Ministry wards had not marked him as a convicted felon or a pending felon (ie. escorted by Dementors) the magic of both the lift and the wards cleared the way for him. The lift its self stopped only once after Harry got on and dumped everyone but Harry on the previously requested level six using precise tilting of various floor panels to force them out without bothering Harry. All of this was a rarely triggered precaution buried in the Ministry wards. Anyone powerful enough and angry enough to bring down the building that wasn't marked as a felon was given priority escape routes when furious enough.</p><p>The floo in the atrium that Mr. Weasley had pointed out was in easy reach after the lift cleared out. Harry stalked across the room to the nearest one and a shouted "Diagon Alley!" got him away without further issue. The tumble of Aurors sent after him to see what the hell was going on to upset the wards so badly missed his exit by a mile.</p><p>Harry stumbled slightly out of the floo into the Leaky Cauldron and, ignoring the open glares caused by the character assassinations in the Prophet, headed firmly for the bank. He figured that the bank would be able to contact Professor Snape faster and more safely than he could. He also figured that bargaining for safe haven at the same time would likely be beneficial since he barely understood what a life debt entailed. Lupin had been very cagey about it when he explained the dreaded werewolf prank and exactly how <i>Severus</i> had been punished but the Marauders had gotten away scot free. Harry grimaced at the thought of the tirade that was sure to come from Snape once he learned of what Harry had done. It was going to be a long and expensive day but hopefully it would be worth it.</p><p>Harry would give up his entire vault and more for a safe place to sleep during the summers and three meals a day without being harrassed in some fashion. It was something he barely managed at Hogwarts and was likely to disappear on him now that Ron and Hermione had proven their loyalty to Dumbledore and ignored him all summer. Ginny's stalker tendencies were also getting exceptionally creepy, <i>especially</i> with Mrs. Weasley shoving them together so much.</p><p>Harry had to dodge something with wings that went by too fast for him to identify, bringing him out of his brooding, as he headed for the bank. At this point he really didn't care if he got spotted as long as they didn't manage to actually stop him. A shout from behind him had him mentally groaning as he broke into a jog and finally darted into the bank lobby, giving a respectful nod to both the openly placed guards. Taking his place in line he prudently ignored the people who had followed him into the bank. It was only when a heavy hand fell on his shoulder that he decided enough was enough. A sharp elbow to the stomach of the person started a scuffle that was quickly broken up by the guards.</p><p>"I just want to conduct my own business. Trying to kidnap someone inside the bank is <i>really</i> stupid," Harry pointed out scathingly. "You do <i>not</i> touch someone near the neck without immediately becoming a threat."</p><p>"Dumbledore sent a patronus and told me to collect you," the Auror that Harry didn't recognize spluttered.</p><p>"<i>Fuck Dumbledore</i>! I am <i>not</i> his fucking plaything! He has no right to restrict my movements or order me around. I am not his servant or slave and I will <i>not</i> stand for being treated as such any longer. You go back and tell the bastard that I was serious. I would rather side with the Dark Lord at this point than continue siding with the rest of you lot!" Harry snarled. "Master Goblin, I came here today to seek sanctuary or at least arrange for something that would get them all to <i>leave me the hell <u>alone</u></i>. I had hoped to discuss it with someone without disrupting your other business but this <i>idiot</i> made that impossible."</p><p>"Your petition will be considered sir. If you will just come with us," the guard said politely. This young wizard wasn't fighting them, had legitimate business, and had tried to avoid causing a fuss until grabbed. All good points in the guard's opinion. The Auror on the other hand grabbed without warning and was being successfully fought off by the young wizard until he had started for his wand just as the security staff intervened. This was <i>goblin</i> territory and attempting to take someone like that was a direct violation of their sovereignty. The Auror would not be leaving alive and the wizard's Auror office would be recieving a note of his termination. His actions, regardless of reason, had signed his death warrant.</p><p>Harry happily accompanied the guards as he was led away. It wasn't what he originally wanted, drawing far too much attention, even though he had made no secret of what he was aiming for when he stormed out of the court room. On the upside he no longer had to stand in line!</p><p>Griphook sighed as he watched Heir Potter being led away by the guard. The young wizard would be checked over for damage from the tussle as the clear victim and provided compensation from the vault of his assailant. The other paperwork would give Griphook enough time to round up the Director and the various concerned account managers. With a little luck they could also sort out some of the probable account irregularities and get several of the vaults gifted to Heir Potter working again, using the gold rather than letting it just sit there.</p>
