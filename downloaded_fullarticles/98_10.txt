    <p>It had been midway through his third year when he was thrown away as though broken, or unwanted.</p><p>A discarded, broken, toy.</p><p>He still didn’t know why he was here, and no one ever answered when he had asked in the beginning.</p><p>Or well, they did answer. But not the way he wanted.</p><p>It was either silence, or cutting remarks, or questions about why he had done it.</p><p>Done what?</p><p>That hurt him, because these people thought he had done something, and while he didn’t know what, he assumed it had been bad. </p><p>Well, everything hurt here.</p><p>His head, his feet where they had frozen to the point of going blue, his legs that would no longer straighten, his hands that would not grasp anything, and his arms that would not lift.</p><p>He didn’t know if that was just the cold, or if it was an effect of not getting any food for weeks on end. Perhaps it was even a curse, placed upon him when he had left that farce of a trial.</p><p>His brain ran slowly, on a good day. On a bad day, it was quick, and panicked, and scared and it ran so fast, and then panic would seize him, and the dementors would rush to the cell, to add to that horrible, horrible feeling of drowning.</p><p>Although, in the darkness that cloaked his cell hour after hour after hour, he wouldn’t be surprised if many other days would be like this, cloaked in that drowning depressive energy.<br/>He didn’t even know if he existed anymore.</p><p>He just was.</p><p>He lay back, resembling for all the world a starfish.</p><p>The darkness was soothing, until it wasn’t. But alas, such things were like that.</p><p>Just as the lack of sleep was. His mind would write such wonderful stories, and he wondered if he would ever write them down? It also saved him the dreams he knew would crawl into his brain.</p><p>Oh how he hated the dreams.</p><p>But it also tired him out, making him sleep for longer when it finally came time too.<br/>He supposed it was just the way things were. </p><p>There was no light without shadow.</p>
