  <strong>Harry Potter Version</strong>
</p><p>Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom. There lived a poor young <em>girl</em>, who's mother died giving birth then lost his father at a early age and was forced to live with his <em>stepmother</em>, Voldemort and <em>her</em> two evil <em>daughters </em>Bellatrix and Lucius. Poor Harry was forced to cook all the meals for <em>her</em> family, and clean up after <em>her sisters</em>.</p><p>One day while Harry was cleaning the floors of the entryway, someone knocked. Wiping his hands with a washrag, Harry answered the door. "May I help you?" Harry said politely.　</p><p>*snickers could be heard from the backroom, mutters of 'momma's boy' and 'goody two-shoes'*</p><p>
  <strong>bobbi; knock it off or else you'll be joining them!</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>*waves hand in the direction of trapdoor*</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>all; yes ma'am</strong>
</p><p>Standing at the entrance was the royal messenger, Ron. With a tired voice he spoke, "I have here, a message stating that every eligible female that has come of age is to attend the Prince's Ball. So that he may find a bride. Attendance is optional, though it is best to come so as not to upset the Queen."</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong>*Ron gasps for breath as Hermione looks on worriedly*</strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong>draco; how did you do that without breathing?</strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong>fred; takes after mum, that one does</strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong>george; so true</strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong>*grinning, the twins run while avoinding hexs thrown at them by Ginny*</strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Holding out the invitation, Ron takes a deep calming breath as Harry covers his ears. Not a second later two high pitched screeches echo of the walls as Harry's <em>sisters</em> come running down the stairs.</p><p>             <strong>       </strong>     </p><p>~*~</p><p>             <strong>       </strong>     </p><p> </p>
