<p>                                                                                                                                  ***</p>
<p>I knew it was him. How could I not?<br/>
I didn't tell them. I didn't want to be cold again, feel his amusement and joy from something so wrong. I didn't want to see anyone else dying in this house.<br/>
I was wrong though. Many people died there after.<br/>
But he had to live, I knew. Without him there would not be much to see. I guess the world would be just ashes and smoke and blood - that's at least how I imagined it. He had to live. Whatever it would take.<br/>
So I didn't say much.<br/>
‘I dont't know… I'm not sure.’<br/>
‘Look at him closely Draco.’<br/>
So I looked even closer into those eyes. Yes, of course it was him. I wanted to scream, either that I recognised him or to just let me fucking sleep. Or both. Maybe it was because of my tired state I was in at the time that I lost my mind and ultimately everything else. Instead I was just looking at him closer and closer and closer and the green was greener and the ringing in my ears turned into screams.<br/>
Then everything went in a blur. I don't even know how I lost my wand. Did I fight? Did I give it up willingly? I can't remember. And it's not important, really.<br/>
They left. We stayed. He came. And then there was blood and screams. And more blood.</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                     ***</p>
<p>Was it worth it? Sometimes… only sometimes I ask myself the same question.<br/>
I can't say I know the answer. Right when the blood started flowing I wanted to take it all back and shout: ‘It's him, it's him!’<br/>
When he lied in Hagrid's arms I was thinking it was all for nothing.<br/>
When I was taken to Azkaban I wanted to cry from misery and relief at the same time. I didn`t want to be there, yet I was glad I didn't have to see anyone for a while and could sulk over every poor decision I have ever made. It was fun, I must say. But I was never counting that one among them. Yes, it was probably stupid on many levels. I just couldn't bring myself to look at that particular moment as something done out of stupidity.<br/>
It was fear leading me that night. I was afraid of so many things. I still am. But some of those things are dead  and some might not be as scary now. And of course, there are new fears, new traumas, new nightmares.<br/>
In great scheme of things they mean nothing.<br/>
Because we survived.<br/>
And he is alive.</p>
<p>So…  Was it worth it?</p></div>
