    <p align="center">Chapter 1.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">Charlie Weasley was currently drinking himself to death.</p><p align="left">Death. Really. He would have laughed, how dramatically ironic. Because it was what she did to herself. Wasn't it? </p><p align="left">She bloody killed herself. Brew the fucking potion and drank it. Wasn't she shit at it, if Snape's opinion was to be believed. </p><p align="left">He would have been proud, if he didn't look dead on his feet himself. His face so pale and eyes dull.</p><p align="left">Now, Charlie could understand Ron, Hermione, Remus, Sirius, Albus and Minerva, his own family and so many others. But why him? Wasn't it what he wanted? Snape hated Ella.</p><p align="left">And yet..the Professor shut himself in his lab and didn't even answer to the Headmasters calls. Did he change the side? Well, the biggest Hope (funny, it was her middle name) was dead. </p><p align="left">She didn't have a funeral. Apparently it was how she wanted it. Didn't want any of them to attend.That was what the goblins said. Not a single person knew where Dianella found her last home.</p><p align="left">He raised his glass and drank it all, burning his throat. He welcomed the pain. Maybe the physical pain will shut the fuck up his bleeding soul. </p><p align="left">He fucking loves her. Love. Present terms. It will always be present terms.</p><p align="left">Every time he closed his eyes he could see her mischivious smile, the fire in her green eyes. When did all of that died? Why didn't they notice? Why didn't he?</p><p align="left">His train of thoughts were broken by the familiar snowy owl.</p><p align="left">Since that day, almost two month ago the owl was restless, without her beautiful mistress. But today, she was here. Hedwig landed on the table and dropped a small package. It looked like it was made by hand, wrapped in the green paper. </p><p align="left">Green. He loved it and he hated it.</p><p align="left">Hedwig didn't wait for anything. She didn't give Charlie a second look. Did the owl blame him as much as he blamed himself?</p><p align="left">Yet, Charlie couldn't ignore it. Something was nagging him. He needed to know.</p><p align="left">He opened  it.</p><p align="left">It was a small box and inside it were muggle taps and muggle player.</p><p align="left">What the actual fuck? He wasn't in the mood for some silly songs. He was in the mood for running away as far as he could. and being alone with his grief for the rest of his life.</p><p align="left">And yet..and yet he put the headphones on and pressed play. He never expected what came out, however. That voice..that voice he loved so much.</p><p align="left">Cassette one. Side A:</p><p align="left">
  <em>Hey there, dear friends and family. Did you miss me? Not really I suppose. Why would you? You never really knew me. Maybe you are happy to get rid of me. No, don't get me wrong, I bet you all are furious that I did it before old Voldy business was taken cared of. But you see, I don't give a shit. It was my decision. I was never allowed one. In my bloody life everything was decided by someone. But no more. I say to the hell. But I am not done with you..just yet.</em>
</p><p align="left">Charlie's heart stopped.</p><p align="left">What? Happy to get rid of you? What in the name of Marlin's beard? We cared for you. I cared for you. I fucking loved you.</p><p align="left">With his shaking hand, he pressed play again. It was a message from Ella. He needed to listen. He knew. Whatever it was. But her voice, the voice that gave him so much joy. It was bitter now. Sarcastic and hurt. What the hell happened?</p><p align="left">
  <em>Yeepp, thats me. Dianella Hope Potter. My voice in your heads right now. Get comfy, we are going to be together a bit longer.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>She chuckled.</em>
</p><p align="left">Charlie felt sick.</p><p align="left">
  <em>"If you are listening this tape that means I am dead. And you are gong to finally do, what I so desperately wanted from all of you - listen. You are going to know the story of my life. And no, you don't have a bloody idea about me or my life. You never did. Never bothered to find out. You don't know the real me. With all my demons, dreams or fears. But today, today you will get rid of that idea you have about "how the hero supposed to be". Today I will have what I wanted. Meet the only one and real- JUST Dianella. The human fucking being."</em>
</p><p align="left">The more she talked, the emptier Charlie felt. I knew you! Ella, I fucking knew. I saw you for who you were. Never wished you to be anything or anyone else.</p><p align="left">
  <em>"You see, darlings, if you are on these tapes, it means you are one of the reasons why I am dead."</em>
</p><p align="left">Stop. Stop.Stop.</p><p align="left">What did I do? No.</p><p align="left">Charlie was shaking. He couldn't take it. His eyes burning with the tears. </p><p align="left">He would gladly take her place. Anything for her to live. Why?</p><p align="left">But if he was..he needs to know. He has to.</p><p align="left">Play.</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Yep, thats right. Here you have some 15 bloody tapes. And you are going to listen to them all." she spoke clearly, calmly even.<br/></em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"So clear your schedules, fellows. I was ignored by you most of my life. So I won't have it any longer. Don't even bother to deny it. Yes, I was. And maybe, just maybe if you listen to these tapes you will get it. Get what it was like to be me. Because the girl who lived was the centre of your attention and only her"</em>
</p><p align="left">That was it. She was talking about that bloody name. She wasn't talking about herself. About the girl Charlie loves.</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Let us continue. We don't want to get bored, do we? There are two rules. You can follow them, I am sure. Rule number one- listen to all the tapes, in order. Number two- pass the tapes to on the next person on the list. You see? It doesn't take a genius to follow with my rules.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>But be warned! If you decided to lose, damage or destroyed my hard work before the last person hears them, another set will be sent to the prophet, all the people you know, the bloody world of ours. And I don't think you want it? Right? Even if, you did deserve it. And maybe, just maybe I want it to be heard. But it seems I really do have a hero complex. So lets give you the opportunity to avoid it all. Or and one more thing. Its not really a rule, just my suggestion. I have a map for you. It had some places marked. I would like you to visit them for me. One last time." she said it all so cheerful.</em>
</p><p align="left">Charlie pressed stop. His hand pulling his hair. What had happened to her?  Why she felt the need to do what she did? And why like that? If they were the reasons she was dead...Charlie would be the first one to pass these taps to every single person in the world. Because she deserved the truth, her truth to be heard.</p><p align="left">He braced himself. Play.</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Well, who is the first one? The lucky one,hm? And...it is you, my so loving aunt Tuney. Yes. Thats bloody right. I am going to say something I wanted for the last 16 years of my life. And you can't shut me up. Do you feel confused? Why are you here, you don't have anything to do with the freak, do you? You never wanted.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I  spent some time thinking who should be the first one. You, your husband or your son? But you know, it just didn't fit with them. Because while your husband was the total shit and bastard to me. He wasn't my own blood.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>Your son was. But I can't ask much from him, can I? What with you and old Verni as his role models?</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>You, dear are another matter. You were my own blood. My mothers sister and I was your last family member from the Evans side. Not that you cared. Who wants to be family with a freak? The horror! </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>Freaks deserve no love. No compassion. Nothing. That was what you told me. Every damn time I cried or wanted one kind word from you, one hug. I didn't even know what I was. You never told me.I thought my parents were two irresponsible drank people who died in a car crush. Your words were my law, after all"</em>
</p><p align="left">Stop.</p><p align="left">Charlie needed to get out from the Hagrid's. He needed to be at the Privet Drive. The map marked that place, after all. He owned it to her.</p><p align="left">With that, he took his wand and apparated. Second latter and Charlie was in front of the dull looking house. The house Ella spent her years in. From what she told it was more like a prison to her. Why no-one ever did anything about it? Why didn't he?</p><p align="left">The lights were on. He could see a horse-looking lady in the kitchen. She wasn't doing anything. Just seating on the chair near her perfect looking table, something in her hands. From what Charlie could see, she was just staring at it.</p><p align="left">He pressed play.</p><p align="left">
  <em>"You know, Tuney, there was a time I so desperately wanted your love. I wanted to have a mother. I understood fast enough you were nothing but a stranger to me. Even less. Maybe a stranger wouldn't starve a child? Wouldn't allow her husband to bully a child? Certainly wouldn't allow her son beat said child. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>Tell me, would you treat me any better if I wasn't Lily's daughter? Would I spend eleven years of my life in a tiny cupboard under the stairs? I don't have much to tell you, not really. You were the first one to break me. The first one to show me that I was alone. Absolutely fucking alone.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"All I ever wanted from you was you love. And I could love you so much in return. You know..the fucking funny thing is..no matter what, I can't do not care about you. I asked the Headmaster for your protection. Because if that bloody Dark Lord ever found you..I would have come for you, Tuney"</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>You know, I really wanted to know two things. I don't think I will ever hear the answers. Yet, I will ask you.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Why?"</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"And..did you ever love me? Maybe somehow in your own twisted way? Was there something inside you?</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Anyway, congrats, aunt Tuney. You did it. You got rid of me. I am dead. No more freaks in your perfect house. Have a good life free of my abnormality".</em>
</p><p align="left">Charlie couldn't take more. A cupboard? She never mentioned it. He felt sick. How could someone do it to a child? Did Ella mentioned it to Ron? Hermione? His mother? Why didn't they do anything about it? </p><p align="left">At that moment, his thoughts were broken. Petunia looked right into his eyes. She was staring at him throw the window. Face grey, eyes bloody. She stood up, by the looks of it she couldn't walk properly. She nodded her head, as trying to tell him something. </p><p align="left">He went to the door. Not a second later, she opened it. And stood aside, silently letting him in.</p><p align="left">"You are not the first one to come here. But you are the first one who is looking so confused and lost." she whispered, her voice breaking. "I suppose you want to see it for yourself? She wasn't ling, you know. My niece never was a liar." she said. </p><p align="left">Charlie tried to find his voice, his throat tight. "I know. Ella was true to the end. She hated it, when people lied." he managed.</p><p align="left">Her aunt face twitched, something akin recognition was in her eyes. "Ella? I see, you are Charlie Weasley, aren't you?"</p><p align="left">His heart dropped, he felt like he was about to faint "How, how do you know me?"</p><p align="left">She gave him a broken sort of laugh "You are the only one who called her that. It was on the tape."</p><p align="left">By now he was shaking. His tape. She knew. Whatever he did she knew. He hated that bitch. He wanted to hurt her. But was it his right? He was on the tapes too, guilty as ever.</p><p align="left">"Listen to the tapes. You will know what you did or didn't do. Not that it will help you, if you cared for her. Well, I don't think I have any rights to lecture anyone about caring. Do I? I killed her just like every other person. I broke a child. So, you can look where you want, stay as long as you want. I don't care anymore"</p><p align="left">With that she want back to the kitchen, back to staring at something. Charlie moved closer to the door. She didn't even notice. She had some old photos in her shaking hands. The photo of two young girls. He recognised them both. One was Ella's aunt..and the other was Lily Evans Potter. It seems like Tuney found her heart at last. A bit too late.</p><p align="left">Charlie felt like he couldn't breath. He didn't want to see anything here. But he needed to know, before he will leave this hell for good.</p><p align="left">"Why?" was all he asked her.</p><p align="left">She didn't look at him, continue to stare at the old photograph "That day. That day you were celebrating the death of the evil wizard. I lost her for good, you know. You were  celebrating her death. And I was left with the letter and a toddler.A child who had her eyes. The eyes of my little sister.The one I failed. She did noting wrong. She was perfect baby girl. It was my grief, my guilt. I decided to hate her, because otherwise I was left with the bitter truth. My jealousy over my sister was the reason she walked away after our parents death. And the day she walked away was the last day I ever saw her. Your world pulled her into the war. Your world killed her. And I helped. So thats why. I knew her baby girl will be a witch, I knew she would walk away from me. I knew it all and I decided if I don't get attached, if I let hate overtake me, I wouldn't be heartbroken twice." </p><p align="left">Charlie didn't know what to tell. He just stared. It wasn't a good reason. It never was, Ella didn't deserve any of it.</p><p align="left">"Did you, did you.." his voce broken, he swallowed his cries.</p><p align="left">Petunia had tears rolling down "Did I ever love her? Does it matter now? I killed her. Because I couldn't show her that little simple thing. But if I could go back, go back in time..I would tell her, that I didn't hate her. That she wasn't a freak. That very deeply, I loved her, just as I loved Lily. But at the end non of it matter. The dead don't need it, they need our care and love when they are breaking, when they think about taking their own life because there is no Hope any more"</p><p align="left">Maybe it was Charlie's imaginations, but by the way she pronounced "Hope" he didn't think she was meaning the world itself, but the name.</p><p align="left">Because it was fucking true. There was no Hope anymore.</p><p align="left">Charlie left.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p>
