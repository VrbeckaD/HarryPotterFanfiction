    <p>I'm surrounded by strangers that used to be my friends all staring at me without a hint of regret. These people have sentenced me to death. I'm to be killed by the dementors kiss. Why you ask?  They say for murder. For the murder of Tom Marvolo Riddle. Otherwise known as Lord Voldemort, killer of hundreds. As soon as the accusation was made everyone turned on me. Everyone except for Ron, who was mysteriously attacked and sent to saint mungos in a coma after he tried to stand up for me. As the dementor flies towards me I use my last seconds to glare at the mastermind behind every bad thing in my life. Dumbledore. Dumbledore who was the reason Peter became a death eater and betrayed my parents. Dumbledore who left me with the Dursleys even though he knew they abused me. Dumbledore who paid the weasly's to act like my family, for Ginny to pretend to like me and for Hermione to become my friend. I glare at him until the dementor pulls my soul from my body and everything goes cold and dark.</p><p> </p><p>I open my eyes to a bright light. Wait. I open my eyes? Didn't I die? I blink my eyes a few times trying to get them to adjust. I'm lying on my side with no control over my limbs. I try to call out, but make a strange gurgling noise instead. My eyes start to adjust. There's a lump next to me. I blink a few more times until my vision is completely clear. Lying next to me is a giant baby. The same size as me! Maybe even bigger! I let out a squeal that is way to high pitch to be my voice. I reach up to cover my mouth, but miss moving my hand up in front of my face. It's tiny. That means... that isn't a giant baby, it's a normal baby, like how I've somehow become. What the hell happened?! Was I reborn? And who is this other baby? I'm distracted from my thoughts when a shadow covers me. I look up to see two giant figures.</p><p> </p><p>"They're awake." A woman states softly. I look over to the baby next to me. She's right. They're sleepily blinking their eyes open.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello there, Harry, James." A man coos, gently picking me up as the woman picks 'James' up.</p><p> </p><p>"James Fleamont Potter and Harry Euphemia Potter." The woman says smiling brightly. James Fleamont Potter? Like my dad? I stare at him with wide eyes, before I let out a giggle. I get a second chance to have a family.</p>
