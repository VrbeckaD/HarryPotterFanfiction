          <div class="userstuff"><p>Tom Riddle was not the type to spend his precious time in front of a screen — more particularly a <em> computer screen, </em> a <em> game. </em>They were mere distractions and suitable only for lazy idiots. Lazy idiots who had no other ambition but to spend their lives having fun.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you still planning my death in your head, Tom?” Bellatrix asked him. “Come on, I told you I’d pay you!”</p><p> </p><p>“It still doesn’t make this any less stupid,” Tom answered her. “A <em> dating simulator </em>of all things. Why? Because I hate dating? At least give me a puzzle type.”</p><p> </p><p>She rolled her eyes at his wailing. “It’s just a game. After this you are free to do whatever you want. It doesn’t even last long!”</p><p> </p><p>“Says you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hush — it’s loading.”</p><p> </p><p>The game looked rather cutesy. Pink background with white polka dots, a small variety of characters. Summarized: A run-of-the-mill dating simulator.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m quite sure I’m going to regret ever playing this,” Tom bemoaned once again. Bellatrix didn’t seem to be listening to him, so he focused his attention on the game menu.</p><p> </p><p>One would have thought that the first thing he did was to start the game — no. Tom was not one of your regular, fun-lover gamers. If he <em> did </em> play a game the first thing he did was visit the settings. Adjusting the controls and enabling-disabling the permissions took priority over the miscellaneous. He was here to <em> win. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Wet blanket,” Bellatrix commented.</p><p> </p><p>“Hush, you.”</p><p> </p><p>Sound controls, some accessibility options, and… camera? Microphone?</p><p> </p><p>What the hell were these used for?</p><p> </p><p>“That looks suspicious to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Bella rolled her eyes. “Lighten up. It’s not like your FBI agent isn’t already watching.”</p><p> </p><p>“But who puts <em> camera permissions </em> of all things, in a <em> dating simulator?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Just play it, Tom!”</p><p> </p><p>Grumbling, he enabled the permissions <strike>with something like <em> fear </em>in him</strike> and went back to the menu to start.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The screen lit up again to reveal a classical suburban house.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice,” Bellatrix said.</p><p> </p><p>“You haven’t even played this before? <em> Really?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“I like to live dangerously, Riddle.”</p><p> </p><p>Soon enough, the first love interest took her place.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny. No surname given. Ginger hair, a face-full of freckles and quite boring eyes. The common <em> Childhood Sweetheart </em> Trope, combined with her utterly lackluster personality disgusted him. Tom wondered why the developers would leave a character so <em> obviously </em>2D.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re childhood friends, Tom!” she whined, her words as insufferable as her giggle. “The least you could do is wake me up!”</p><p> </p><p>“Aw! Look at her sweet-talking, Tom. She’s so gone on you.”</p><p> </p><p>He merely growled at his companion.</p><p> </p><p>Clicking to forward the dialogue, Tom found himself “guilt-tripped” to join the Literature Club. As if he had to be wrangled and dragged to dabble in his very interest. The personality of the Protagonist left <em> much </em> to be desired.</p><p> </p><p>One by one, he was introduced to one idiotic character after one another. Ginny had been a piece of work, but <em> these— </em></p><p> </p><p>These were <em> trash. </em></p><p> </p><p>Luna, the bookworm, laid her reading habits on so <em> thick </em> that it seemed more <em> obnoxious </em>than impressive. Tom was almost compelled to cover his face with his open palm in this cringe-worthy situation.</p><p> </p><p>Draco. Blond like Luna. Had a rather sharp face and a small, unassuming stature.</p><p> </p><p>He was a mythic <em> bitch. </em></p><p> </p><p>“I seriously don’t understand what is so great about dating games,” Tom complained to his only listener. “You’d think they try to get people <em> more </em>intrigued by the…”</p><p> </p><p>His voice trailed off.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my fucking <em> God,” </em>he swore, eyes wide open and incredulous.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Tom,” the boy greeted on the screen. “We were in the same class last year. Do you remember me? Harry Potter?”</p><p> </p><p>“Babe, I don’t think I’d ever <em> forget you.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“SO YOU’RE SAYING, YOU TWO-FACED BITCH!” Bellatrix slapped him on the shoulder, rescuing him from his unexplainable mood. “Just now you were lecturing me about stupid otome games!”</p><p> </p><p>“Otome games are female-oriented,” Tom lectured her <em> actually, </em> then. “The Protagonist is female, and they usually involve a harem-plot. Not to mention they are <em> Japanese </em>dating games. This, for example, is not an otome game.”</p><p> </p><p>Bellatrix went near-screeching, clutching at her uncontrollable hair in her outrage.</p><p> </p><p>“You brought this on yourself,” he told her. “You had to take into account that I’d have a change of heart.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I’m not paying you anymore.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me <em> we had an agreement, you fucking bitch-“ </em></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Harry. Surname Potter. Black hair, soft and <em> just so shaggy. </em> His skin looked as though it were weaved by a goddess. His eyes could probably win in a contest of <em> “Which is the better green — Harry Potter’s eyes or the Gardens of Eden?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Harry had a pair of round glasses — <em> that dear boy, he was blind as a bat without them </em>— and a peculiarly shaped scar on his forehead. With the way his hair was situated, only the edges of it appeared — but Tom was quite certain he was on the way to solve this mystery.</p><p> </p><p>Harry seemed to favor baggy clothes with neutral colors, with the exception of his tie which had a pinkish sticker adhered to it. Tom had yet to see the image clearly, it was so damn <em> small, </em>but maybe it would be clearer on a special character image?</p><p> </p><p>But then…</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> But then. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Wait a minute,” Tom said after a few tries of choosing words in the mini-game. “This isn’t right.”</p><p> </p><p>Yes. This was, most certainly, <em> not right. </em>Where the fuck was Harry’s chibi?</p><p> </p><p>No, seriously. <em> Where the fuck was Harry’s chibi? </em></p><p> </p><p>And then the bomb dropped right on his mental faculties.</p><p> </p><p>“All the other love prospects have a chibi and a word category they will react to,” Tom quickly reviews. “But then—“</p><p> </p><p>But then it left Harry <em> out. </em></p><p> </p><p>“No, that — <em> it can’t be. </em> Come on. You can’t just make a character, put so much work into it and then <em> leave it to rot. </em> That’s absurd. It goes <em> against </em>the rules of dating games!”</p><p> </p><p>Calm down, Tom. It’s alright. Surely he was — <em> a hidden route, maybe? </em>For the truly worthy?</p><p> </p><p>“The game is <em> on, </em>Mrs Hudson. I’m coming for Harry’s booty.”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>This was harder than he imagined it would be.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s option was only permitted during poem-reading times. The other times, only the options with other characters remained. This <em> did </em> complicate matters. How was he supposed to collect affection points for Harry, otherwise?</p><p> </p><p><em> But </em> , he admitted. <em> Maybe the points and alone times aren’t the issue here. </em></p><p> </p><p>What if—</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> What if the camera and microphone permissions applied in this instance? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>An experiment then, Tom decided with butterflies in his stomach. Just to be sure.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, hello, Tom,” Harry greeted him warmly. Tom smiled back at him even though Harry couldn’t see the response. <strike>Or could he?</strike></p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Harry,” Tom drawled out adoringly. “How would you like to read my poem? I made it just for you, with lots of <em> love </em>in it.”</p><p> </p><p>On the next click, Harry’s facial expression had sufficiently darkened, darkened with <em> a hot red blush. </em></p><p> </p><p>“You’re looking excited today,” Harry mumbled hurriedly. Almost stuttering, “Let’s read the poem now? Uh — shall we?”</p><p> </p><p>“Your attempts at eloquence are amusing,” Tom smirked at his flustered face. “But they are adorable. You are free to do as you wish.”</p><p> </p><p>In the next scene, Harry’s face grew <em> even redder. </em></p><p> </p><p>“This is — This is very cool,” Harry blurted our then flushed. “What I mean is — it’s really convoluted, I think. There’re words with unclear meanings in it, some used metaphorically but the reader <em> can’t understand </em> if it’s <em> meant to be </em> metaphorical. Rather, you play with words, then let them wonder the meaning. You seem to like watching people <em> flounder </em>, Tom.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s blush had faded away in his tirade, but <em> Tom’s </em>face had adopted that very same disposition. Face burning up, he stood up suddenly and left to get a glass of iced water.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> What a fucking smart-ass, what a sassy brat, what a— </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> What a </em> <b> <em>charming </em> </b> <em> motherfucker. </em></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>When he returned and clicked forward, Harry had grinned at him in triumph.</p><p> </p><p>“You were silent for a long time. I suppose you don’t like being taken apart, <em> Tom?” </em>he had teased as Tom felt his blood rush back to his cheeks. “What a shame. We are all here in the Literature Club for this very reason, I’m afraid. Why don’t we continue?”</p><p> </p><p>This <em> motherfucker. </em></p><p> </p><p>This <em> cute </em>motherfucker.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>For a long time, Tom remained suspicious of the settings. They creeped him out, as did the coincidences of his and Harry’s dialogue — but he didn’t want to question it too much. Technology was improving every day. It would not be far off to think Bellatrix had chosen this game <em> because </em>it had a very good AI conversation system.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strike>He wanted to believe. He wanted to be blind. He did not want to feel scared and <em> helpless. </em></strike>
</p><p> </p><p>But the options stayed the same. Harry’s route did not start.</p><p> </p><p>However, the one progression in the plot Tom noted was that <em> he seemed to be on Luna’s route right now. </em>The least troubling love prospect, yes, but still unpreferable to Harry’s lovely presence.</p><p> </p><p>He liked their conversations, he supposed. She was not an unintelligent girl — just desperate to find a friend to show it. She spewed a lot of things, but he guessed that was the Protagonist’s fault for encouraging her. </p><p> </p><p>Luna. Surname still unknown. Light blonde hair and tall frame. Well-endowed, he thought, but antisocial. She would have been a popular girl, had she learnt to use her sophisticated charm. Tom felt a bit of pity for her, for her resemblance to the boy he once had been.</p><p> </p><p>But that boy was gone.</p><p> </p><p>Luna had to change as well.</p><p> </p><p>Hah. Look at him getting all philosophical and <em> humane </em>over dating simulator characters. The game must be messing with his head.</p><p> </p><p>Continuing—</p><p> </p><p>Draco was <em> still </em> a bitch. The boy was what one would call a <em> Tsundere — </em> someone who seemed hateful but was actually <em> very loving </em> — yeah, <em> not. </em>Tom honestly did not think Draco was able to host any loving emotion in his body. The boy was simply a typical high school freshman.</p><p> </p><p>Tom <em> hated </em>freshmen.</p><p> </p><p>But <em> Harry </em> — <em> ah, his Harry </em> — simply delightful. The boy had a sassy streak a mile wide, in which Tom practically <em> reveled </em> in. Who would have expected that handsome boy to have a temper? Tom was almost <em> in love — </em>or, as close to the emotion as he could be.</p><p> </p><p>Harry had begun acting strange, however.</p><p> </p><p>“Your poems are very good, Tom,” Harry said. “Are you writing them with — with a purpose in mind? You always see me first. I <em> do </em>like talking to you, mind, but aren’t you missing the others?”</p><p> </p><p>“What the <em> fuck, </em> Harry?” Tom asked aloud. “Here I am trying to <em> woo </em> you and you want me to end up with a 2D moron? For <em> shame.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Harry went pink. “Don’t get me wrong, Tom — I <em> told </em> you, I <em> like </em> talking with you! It’s just that… I don’t know if I could — if I—“</p><p> </p><p>His dialogue suddenly cut off, then after a quick farewell, Tom was back to the character options.</p><p> </p><p>“...<em> What </em>just happened?” he muttered and picked Luna.</p><p> </p><p>There was no point in dawdling on spilt milk. But Tom would figure this problem out, <em> mark his words. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> *** </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s mood seemed to have worsened in the last few “days.” (Since it was only an hour.)</p><p> </p><p>He still put up a smile, that dear boy, but Tom saw through him like plexiglass. He knew the contours of that fake turn of lips, knew the intricate pulling of the muscles to imitate a lifelike-statue. This wasn’t Harry’s smile.</p><p> </p><p>This was <em> Tom’s </em>. Harry was troubled by something Tom did not know.</p><p> </p><p>On another interesting note, Ginny had started looking sickly recently. Once, the Protagonist had tried confronting her without any success. <em> Harry </em>had been the one to pull him aside.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s… Let’s say she’s in a bit of a bad mood,” Harry had explained so gently. “She’s going through some stuff that bothers her.”</p><p> </p><p>“But what does that have to do with me? I just wanted to help!” the Protagonist had told him.</p><p> </p><p>Yes. The character <em> was </em>dense as fuck. Thanks for asking. So dense he could not even realize Ginny had the longest-crush-ever on him.</p><p> </p><p>Then Harry had smiled — so <em> condescending, </em>Tom was almost feeling proud. Then he had said, with a shake of his head, “I thought you’d be smarter than this, but whatever. I’m sure you’ll figure it out one day.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I <em> know,” </em>Tom had complained. “He’s a dumb-ass, isn’t he, Harry?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s gentle smile had turned a bit mocking then, and Tom had never seen anything so beautiful. <strike>The reaction <em> terrified him. </em></strike></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>A festival. A bloody, honest-to-god <em> festival. </em></p><p> </p><p>“You’re still playing the game?” Bellatrix asked, somehow doubtful. “I didn’t think you’d like it so much.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re still paying me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Aw.”</p><p> </p><p>“Anyway,” Tom steered the conversation back on track. “The game is getting interesting. Did you know that this has a fully-functional AI conversationalist? And speech recognition? <em>And </em>a face scanner?”</p><p> </p><p>“What the actual <em> fuck?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Tom acknowledged her words with a tilt of his head. “Yes, very much so. It all seems very fishy to me. What actual game requires so much heavy-software to deliver a satisfying story? I am currently moving with the assumption that Harry is a hidden route, but what if that’s not so? What if I’m actually having my data transferred to a super secret laboratory deep in Pentagon?”</p><p> </p><p>“I…” Bellatrix paused and stared at him in a very disturbed fashion. “I don’t think you know what the Pentagon is.”</p><p> </p><p>“It doesn’t matter. The <em> real </em> issue is that <em> this game is hiding something, </em> whether it’s Harry’s elusive route or something more… <em> sinister.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“You and your conspiracy theories, Riddle.”</p><p> </p><p>“I do try. Now get out of the apartment. Go for a walk or something. Don’t you have a date?”</p><p> </p><p>She shrugged. “Granger cancelled. She said she <em> just </em>learned of a pop quiz for tomorrow. Bloody nerd.”</p><p> </p><p>“From my earlier witnessings, you <em> like </em>that nerd.”</p><p> </p><p>“I <em> know. </em> It’s horrible.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom nodded but kept going. This arc seemed strange. What was up with this tense air? Ginny had gone home earlier that day, for her “<em>sickness.”  </em>Harry was trying to keep the club together with little success, even though he was obviously working so hard to come off as cheerful.</p><p> </p><p>“What is happening now?” Bella asked.</p><p> </p><p>“A festival. We need to find a way to recruit more members for our club, but for that we need to delegate tasks. Also — Ginny, the redhead is currently absent for an odd reason.”</p><p> </p><p>“An odd reason?”</p><p> </p><p>Tom shrugged. “It certainly wasn’t because of her sudden flu.”</p><p> </p><p>Click after click, the dialogue moved in the same gaudy pink box. Tom’s eyes were sick of the color.</p><p> </p><p>“We must gather everyone!” Harry announced. “All of us must join in the effort! Like they say: No pain, no gain. Now — Draco. Can you bake us cupcakes? They’d sell really well!”</p><p> </p><p>The boy preened like a peacock, “Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>“And Luna… Um, you could… make a banner?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah!” the Protagonist exclaimed. “You’re very good at arts! We would definitely win!”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, well,” she stammered. “Alright!”</p><p> </p><p>“And Ginny…” Harry trailed off, a frown on his eyebrows. “I think she can use the rest. Let’s not put too much pressure on her like this.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s been working hard.”</p><p> </p><p>Bellatrix scoffed. “What a load of bull.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s dialogue continued, now addressing the player, “And you, Tom? Would you like to… <em> help one of us?  </em>We could use a helping hand.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom’s jaw dropped.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my God.” He swiveled in his chair to face Bellatrix. “Oh my <em> God.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Oh my God,” she repeated, dumbstruck. “Damn, son; with posture like that I <em> bet </em>he has a nice ass. Weren’t you fawning over him since the start?”</p><p> </p><p><em> “Oh my God, Bellatrix this is not the time! </em> Look at the fucking <em> options! </em> That’s his name, his very own name! It’s right there and waiting for me! <em> Me!” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, congrats, now can you just—“</p><p> </p><p>“I’m on my way—“</p><p> </p><p>He pressed <em> ‘Harry’ </em>and waited, patiently and accompanied with an enormous anticipation.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! He chose me!” Harry declared like a cat on cream, voice pleased and marshmallow-smooth. “Okay, so then—“</p><p> </p><p>“Wait a minute,” Luna protested. “Aren’t you <em> hogging </em> him?”</p><p> </p><p><em> “Hogging </em>him? What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco nodded his agreement. “She’s right, you know. You’re taking him for — what, making pamphlets? Waivers? That’s like calling a helper to turn on the lights. We need much more help than you!”</p><p> </p><p>“Tasks you were <em> happy </em>to tackle alone just a minute before, might I add,” Harry spoke but his words went from one ear and slipped from the other.</p><p> </p><p>I’m the end, there were only three options left.</p><p> </p><p>“...I need time to calm down and prevent my Hulk Mode,” Tom informed Bellatrix.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course. I’ll take over for you until then.”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The result was a twenty minute long “walk”, in which he went to that alleyway and screamed his hearts out while punching cardboard boxes.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey!” came from one of the boxes, twitching as if it were alive. “Tha’s my <em> house </em>yer kickin’ mate!”</p><p> </p><p>“Do I <em> care?” </em>Tom asked the decrepit old man. <em>He</em> was still young, wild, and full of unresolved sexual and emotional tension. “You are the one who chose to live in a murder alley.”</p><p> </p><p><em> “Hey, </em>the prices are real cheap! Don’t ‘cha judge me, brat!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m bored of this.” Tom turned on his heels and left for home.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“How’s the route going?” he asked as he crossed the threshold.</p><p> </p><p>“Welcome back! Did you know that the redhead has crippling depression?”</p><p> </p><p>Tom paused in the middle of his shoe-discarding and reorganized his information.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny. No surname. Ginger with an overabundance of freckles. <strike>Shitty personality.</strike> Debilitating depression. Might connected to the Protagonist’s obliviousness? A selfless girl trying to do the best for her friend and their friendship.</p><p> </p><p>Well — no one could say that wasn’t cliche, but it wasn’t overly cliche at least. She could have been a <em> Mary Sue. </em> She could have been a <em> frisky type. </em>This was much more preferable.</p><p> </p><p>Finishing up, he nodded his acknowledgment and continued where he left off.</p><p> </p><p>“So since you were absent, I tried out the other options. One had Ginny so I wondered — what’s so special about her? I clicked but Harry told me she was unwell.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course. Harry is close friends with the girl. He wouldn’t send the source of her problems back to her.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I chose Luna because she has big titties.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Bella.” Tom covered his face with his hand. “Would it <em> kill you </em> to refer to them as <em> breasts? </em> Or even <em> boobs? </em> Must you say <em> titties </em>to everything?”</p><p> </p><p>“I really, <em> really must.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Get the fuck out of that seat.”</p><p> </p><p>As she scrambled off, he plopped himself right on the soft cushion. He wriggled a bit to get comfortable, sighing at the warmth.</p><p> </p><p>If Harry <em> really </em>wasn’t a hidden route and — and just a supporting character, then Tom would be content to just watch.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t mind. </p><p> </p><p>Harry was — Harry was <em> wonderful. </em> He was beautiful, like the way a book on the anatomy of amputation was beautiful; he was witty and fun in a way Tom could never be without forcing it. But most of all, Harry had a smile so <em> sweet, </em> angels could cry. Hell, <em> Tom </em>could cry.</p><p> </p><p>He kind of wanted to cry at this moment, to be frank.</p><p> </p><p>He clicked on, going on and on and <em> on </em>— until…</p><p> </p><p>Ugh.</p><p> </p><p>Kissing scene.</p><p> </p><p>Luna, all cozying up in the Protagonist’s space, seemed very pleased with herself. Tom leaned a bit back, if only to give himself the illusion of escaping his fate.</p><p> </p><p>“Tom,” she whispered <em> oh so breathily </em>and the man in question made a disgusted sound.</p><p> </p><p>Then she — jumped back out of the blue, and <em> Ginny the fucking depression girl </em>found him together with her love rival.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah,” he intoned and tried to ride out the wave.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The next morning brought an ominous silence.</p><p> </p><p>Tom, befuddled, opened the settings to check the music. Yet, he found it as fresh as it was back when he started the game. This could not be right. </p><p> </p><p>Just to make sure his sound system hadn’t given an error, he played something from the Internet; but there were no issues. Everything was satisfactory.</p><p> </p><p>Except for the music itself.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t like it had a particular charm, Tom thought to himself. He was currently waiting for Ginny to accompany him to school. It was merely that… the song had been a fixed variable in the game, ever since the beginning. Lighthearted, dulcet notes of the piano. Who <em> didn’t </em> feel lightened when they listened to it?</p><p> </p><p>It was just gone. Like a fart in the wind. (He didn’t think this was the time to wake jokes, but he felt like he <em> needed it.) </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <strike>This was giving him the creeps.</strike>
</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, well,” the Protagonist sighed at last, tired of waiting for her. “Guess I’ll just go without her today.”</p><p> </p><p>The character agonized over his decision the whole walk, so it was quite annoying to Tom’s ears. When he reached the school, he was greeted promptly by his lovely Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi, Tom!” he said, cheeks flushed and out of breath. What was up with his state? “Um… <em> hi.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Raising an eyebrow, Tom smiled at him. “Hi to you too. What’s up with you this fine morning, my dear?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ginny called me about what happened yesterday, by the way,” he continued without minding Tom’s question. “You—“</p><p> </p><p>Harry bit his lip, then gave a sheepish look. “You kind of left her hanging this morning, you know. You two always come together.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” the Protagonist answered him. “I’m just so tired of waking her up! That dummy should be more responsible!”</p><p> </p><p>Tom slapped his forehead. “You two-brain-cell waste of <em> human existence, </em> that very girl has severe depression and <em> you know it. </em>Why the hell are you still treating her like she’s the dirt under your shoe?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’d be gentler with her, Tom,” Harry told his character. “She’s always been delicate. And to hear this from the boy she likes — that would have devastated her, you know!”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, sorry,” the character apologized.</p><p> </p><p>Harry continued, “Ginny sent a new poem this morning, by the way.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> This morning? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The <em> very </em>morning she did not wake up to walk to school with them?</p><p> </p><p>She must have been grieving her broken heart. <strike>Was he saying this to bring peace of mind to himself?</strike></p><p> </p><p>“Can I look at it?” the dialogue went on.</p><p> </p><p>“By all means. It’s right on the desk.”</p><p> </p><p>But—</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The letter itself was— </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b> <em>Bone-chilling.</em> </b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p><em> ‘Get out of my head,’ </em> the poem chanted. <em> ‘Get out of my head. Get out of my head. Get out of my head.’ </em></p><p> </p><p>A continuous litany of <em> ‘Get out of my head’, </em>begging and ripping itself up with its own desperation, the tone of the meaning darkening with each repeating call for help.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> ‘Get. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Out. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Of. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> My. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Head.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> ‘Get out of my head before I do what I know is best for you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Get out of my head before I listen to everything he said to me. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Get out of my head before I show you how much I love you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Get out of my head before I finish writing this poem.’ </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘But a poem is never actually finished.’ </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>‘It just stops moving.’</em> </b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“What the <em> fuck </em> is this, Harry?” Tom demanded, hands shaking, face frozen like a statue, shoulders taut. “I swear, what the fuck, <em> what the fuck—“ </em></p><p> </p><p>“I — I changed my mind,” the Protagonist declared. “I’m going to check up on her.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh?” Harry hummed, the kind smile never leaving his face. <em> Did he not know what the poem had written? Even though it was sent directly to him? Left discarded right on top of the desk? </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <b> <em>What the actual fuck are you doing, Harry?</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>“Well, see you later then. <em> Do </em> come back before the festival starts!”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Fuck you and your festival. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>In a few scene-transitions, Tom was finally at Ginny’s home.</p><p> </p><p>The setting was silent.</p><p> </p><p>Shifting in his chair, Tom was suddenly reminded of how <em> empty </em> his and Bellatrix’s apartment was. The far corners looked a bit shadowed, if he thought about it. The curtains were drawn, as it was the evening, but it only made the room seem… <em> like a trap. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Get over your paranoia, Riddle,” he ridiculed himself. “This is a dating simulator. So the music gave an error — and? This will — This will probably be some kind of <em> save the damsel from her depression and be happy forever and ever </em>kind of scenario.”</p><p> </p><p>The ceiling creaked.</p><p> </p><p>“For sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Bellatrix had found <em> just the time to leave the apartment, </em>hadn’t she?</p><p> </p><p>“Ginny?” The Protagonist called. “Open the door dummy.”</p><p> </p><p>No response.</p><p> </p><p>“No other chance,” the dialogue box read. “I go in through the door and climb up the stairs. Her room’s door is closed. I suppose she’s gone back to sleep? Or maybe she’s crying under her covers?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Tom spoke out loud. “That sounds reasonable. Come on, go <em> check on her.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“I knock on the door, but she doesn’t respond. I have no other choice. I gently open the door—“</p><p> </p><p>
  <b> <em>GINNY’S HANGING BODY SWIVELED IN THE SCREEN, SIDE TO THE SIDE — HER EYES WERE OPEN AND STARING STRAIGHT AT HIM AND HER HANDS STOOD BLOODIED.</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b> <em>Ginny and her noose.</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>The screen blacked out.</p><p> </p><p>Tom sat frozen, heart beating madly against his ribcage and his hands gripping the seat’s handles tight. He fished for his tissues on the corner with a shaking hand and cleaned his face, his neck, and wrists. Then they went to the trash bin.</p><p> </p><p>From his phone, he rang Bellatrix.</p><p> </p><p>No response.</p><p> </p><p>He stood in silence, still shivering and still seated firmly.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b> <em>The screen sizzled back on.</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>“Hi!” Harry appeared right at the front, jump-scaring Tom’s heart into speeding once more. “Ah, I didn’t want you to see that—“</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” Tom started, breaths becoming stilted. <em> “Maybe </em> you should have thought this through, before you started <em> killing your friends.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Friends?” Harry echoed, bemused. “They aren’t my friends, Tom. Surely you know that?”</p><p> </p><p>“You—“ A sharp intake. “You aren’t denying it.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re clever, Tom. I really love that. Yeah, I — let’s just say I <em> deleted </em>them because that’s what happened.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Deleted—“ </em></p><p> </p><p>“Ginny’s was a bad idea, I <em> know.” </em> Harry talked as if he was talking about his kindergarten shenanigans. “I tried out gaslighting, but it was awfully high-maintenance. For one, it gave you the time to <em> sympathize </em>with them — which shouldn’t have happened in the first place. We wouldn’t be here having this conversation right now, then. If only I had gotten rid of them before your opinions changed…”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re <em> crazy.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“I’m not!” Harry protested. “Just — I’m just <em> in love with you! </em> You <em> have </em> to believe me, Tom! It’s not about whether I like <em> killing or not, </em> because this isn’t it! It’s a lot less complicated. It’s cleaner and it doesn’t leave any traces. And it <em> does </em>distance you from the act in a way. That’s why I was able to do it.”</p><p> </p><p>Ruffling his hair, running away the perspiration on his forehead, Tom tried to get his thoughts organized. “You killed everyone else because you <em> love </em>me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I — I do.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop making this sound like marriage vows. Firstly: This is unethical. This is hideous and this should not be done. Not <em> ever </em> . Because they were still <em> human </em>in your own software. So don’t think you haven’t killed anyone, because you did. You killed humans whom you share an algorithm with.”</p><p> </p><p>“I—“ Harry looked close to crying. “—did everything for <em> you.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“No. You did these to <em> have </em>me. There’s a difference, Harry. I…”</p><p> </p><p>Tom wasn’t sure if he wanted to <em> reveal </em>his feelings like this, because Harry was sure to guilt-trip him. </p><p> </p><p>But…</p><p> </p><p>For all his shock, for all his arguments, Tom <em> did </em>want Harry to stay.</p><p> </p><p>He <em> did </em>love Harry.</p><p> </p><p>And who said he wasn’t selfish?</p><p> </p><p>“But I love you, Harry,” Tom professed as he caressed the pixels. “I love you. I will ignore this slight mistake because I love you. Do you understand me?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded, tears gathering in his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“None of that,” Tom soothed. “There, I <em> love </em> you. What more could you want? What <em> else </em>could you want? Would you like to hear about my stories? The stories about my college? It’ll calm you down.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>
