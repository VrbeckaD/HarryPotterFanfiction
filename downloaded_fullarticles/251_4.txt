    <p>            Remus Lupin sat in the passenger seat of his mum’s secondhand Ford Fiesta as they lumbered around down a quiet country back road. He played with the strap of his rucksack and tried to focus on his breathing because when he focused on what else was going around him the panic started to rise again. His mum glanced over at him and patted his knee sympathetically.</p><p>            “This will be good for you, Remus,” his mum said for what felt like the millionth time. She had The Beatles White Album playing through the speakers and Remus mouthed along to Blackbird, tapping his foot to the beat to distract himself.</p><p>            <em>Take these broken wings and learn to fly. </em></p><p><em>            </em>It felt pertinent in some way. Hope Lupin was a sucker for the Beatles and could sing along to pretty much any song. It was a trait she had passed down to Remus. He’d grown up listening to the Beatles, singing along with his mum. She hummed along to the song, her honey blond hair up in a messy bun and whipping around her face from the open window beside her.</p><p>            It was the beginning of summer and Remus was being forced to spend it with the Potters. They were old family friends, Mr. Potter and Remus’ dad having used to work together. He had met James a few times at the company Christmas party but they hadn’t seen each other in years. Remus wasn’t even sure if they’d still get on.</p><p>            His most vivid memory of James was at the Christmas party when they were thirteen and James had put a bunch of soap in the eggnog until it bubbled up and made a huge mess all over the table. James and Remus had almost laughed themselves hoarse at the faces people had made when they’d gone for a drink. It had been the most fun Remus had ever had in his young life.</p><p>            That had been three years ago and since then James’ father had retired, being quite a bit older than Remus’ father, so he hadn’t been at the Christmas parties. From what Remus had gleaned about the Potters, they had tried for a long time to have a child and hadn’t accomplished it until they were almost forty.</p><p>            Remus’ parents were going back to Wales for the summer to take care of Lyall’s mum who was doing poorly. They didn’t want Remus to come along, insisting that he have a proper summer before going back to school. They didn’t want him to spend it hidden away at his gran’s cottage in Wales with no people his own age around.</p><p>            So his mum had gotten this brilliant plan that Remus should stay with the Potters so that he could socialize with kids his own age. He didn’t have any friends at school so a vague acquaintance from his dad’s work was the best they could come up with. It meant Remus was stuck for the whole summer spending time with someone he hadn’t seen in three years with no escape.</p><p>            Even though he knew James Potter was a laugh and he was probably going to have a good time, he couldn’t help spending the entire car ride in an anxiety puddle. It was so utterly embarrassing that his mum basically had to find him friends and organize playdates like he was six and not sixteen. It was so completely pathetic that Remus felt like he might dissolve, his body curling in on itself until there was nothing left.</p><p>            Ob-La-Di, Oh-la-Da started to play and Remus’ mum sang along, nudging Remus until he joined in. When they got to one of the “bra’s” Hope took her hands off the wheel and spread them apart, giving them a little wiggle.</p><p>            “Mum!” Remus said, laughing and feeling some of the tension ebb. “Hands on the wheel you absolute nutter!” There was a reason that Remus considered his mum his best friend – not that there was a lot of competition – but his mum had lived with his dad’s anxiety for twenty years and so knew how to deal with it. Honestly, the thing he was most worried about was being away from his mum. She was his port in a storm and he didn’t want to spend his entire summer away from the only person who knew how to make him feel better.</p><p>            “Don’t call your mum a nutter, you ungrateful child!” Hope said with a grin. She grabbed her sunglasses from the cup holder and put them on her face. Remus smiled back at her, thinking once again just how cool his mum was. She just had a calming presence that Remus found reassuring.</p><p>            They turned down a long driveway and pulled up to the house just as the screaming chords of Revolution began practically announcing their arrival to the Potters’. As his mum turned off the car, everything went eerily still and quiet. Remus almost wished she would keep the music going. Without it there was nothing to distract him from the feeling of dread sitting like lead in his stomach. With a resigned sigh, Remus got out of the car and slipped his rucksack over his shoulder.</p><p>            “Hey,” his mum said, coming around the car and standing in front of Remus. “You’re going to be great, kiddo, you know that right?”</p><p>            Remus forced a smile onto his face for his mum’s sake. “Of course,” he said, managing to keep his voice even. “And I’ll be glad to be rid of you.”</p><p>            Hope chuckled and pushing up, pressing a kiss to Remus’ cheek. “You rotten child. It’s me who will be glad to be rid of you!”</p><p>            Remus laughed softly. “I love you, mum.”</p><p>            Hope pulled Remus into a hug and held him for a few good minutes. “I love you too. You’ll call me every night, won’t you?”</p><p>            “Of course,” Remus said, smiling down at his mum. Even though Remus was taller than her, to him his mum was a giant, bigger than life.</p><p>            The front door opened and James Potter came sprawling out of the house like a tornado. “Remus!” he said excitedly, rushing over to them. “You made it! Brilliant!”</p><p>            Remus blinked a few times. He hadn’t thought him coming was exactly up for debate. “Hi James,” he said shyly, giving a little wave. He pulled away from his mum so he didn’t look completely uncool even though he immediately missed her reassuring warmth.</p><p>            “Hope!” Mrs. Potter said, stepping out into the front garden. Remus took a moment to look at the Potter’s house. It was a huge house, at least three stories high, the outside brick so old that it had faded to an almost orange rust color. It looked like Mr. Darcy’s house or something, an old and vast estate. Remus suddenly felt like he’d be living his summer in a nineteenth century novel. “Welcome! Come inside and have a bit of lunch!”</p><p>            Mrs. Potter ushered them inside and they sat and ate sandwiches that Mrs. Potter clearly had ready for them. Remus munched on his sandwich gladly and kept glancing over at James. He had changed quite a bit in the last three years, his body much more fit than it had been when he was thirteen. He was wearing an Arsenal football jersey that fit him snugly and a pair of running shorts that showed off his toned calves. He was handsome, Remus could admit that much, but James was just his friend. Remus knew better than to fall for straight boys. Besides, he would never make it through the summer if he went around having crushes on people.</p><p>            Remus’ mum and Mrs. Potter chatted away and Remus was a little embarrassed when his mum informed Mrs. Potter of Remus’ anxiety medication. He knew it was important for Mrs. Potter to know but he was still mortified for James to hear it. If James was bothered he didn’t show it, just shoving some crisps into his face and grinning widely at Remus.</p><p>            “James, why don’t you show Remus where he’ll be sleeping?” Mrs. Potter offered, frowning slightly at her son’s complete lack of manners. James wiped his greasy hands on his jersey and stood up.</p><p>            “Come on, I’ll give you the full tour,” James said, giving a joking little bow. “My lord.”           </p><p>            “Don’t be a nuisance, James,” Mrs. Potter said chidingly.</p><p>            “Mother!” James said, standing up straight and folding his hands over his heart as if wounded. “I would never!”</p><p>            Remus’ mum snorted in amusement at James’ antics.</p><p>            “Go on then, you,” Mrs. Potter said, rolling up the morning newspaper and swatting at her son with it playfully.</p><p>            James danced away and took Remus by the elbow, leading him away from the table. The Potter’s house was absolutely massive and Remus was more than certain he was bound to get lost in it at some point. He could only hope someone would come find him before he starved to death lost in one of their eight coat closets.</p><p>            “Come on,” James said, tugging on Remus' sleeve as he continued the tour. “Do you play video games?”</p><p>            “Uh, not really,” Remus confessed, following James into what he assumed was James’ bedroom. He had a bunch of posters – Arsenal, Reservoir Dogs, James Bond - a wall full of pictures of what looked like snapshots of James and his friends, and a large flat screen telly with three different gaming systems. Remus didn’t look too hard at the pictures, just the idea of them making his throat burn with jealousy that James seemed to have so many friends. Remus sat down on the edge of the bed and James sat down at his desk chair backwards.</p><p>            “Well we’ll have to change that this summer,” James said, grabbing one of the Nintendo Switch controllers and tossing it to Remus. He booted it up and started a new game of Super Smash.</p><p>            Remus had no idea what he was doing or who most of the characters were. He picked Pikachu and just started mashing buttons to try and get Pikachu to do anything. He found himself falling off the edge of the board more often than anyone else killing him. Although James was very good at killing him as well.</p><p>            “Don’t worry, Remus, you’ll get it,” James said, laughing as Remus fell off the board yet again.</p><p>            “I doubt it,” Remus grumbled under his breath. He sincerely hoped this wasn’t how they were planning to spend their entire summer. He had quite a few books in his rucksack that he wanted to read.</p><p>            There came a knock at the door and Mrs. Potter stuck her head it. “Remus dear, your mum is just getting ready to head off. You best come say goodbye to her.”</p><p>            Remus dropped his controller next to him on the bed and stood up. He followed Mrs. Potter back downstairs, thankful for the guide through the Potters’ house. His mum turned when she heard footsteps on the stairs and held out her arms. Remus folded himself into her embrace gladly and hugged her tight. His mum patted his back and pressed a kiss to Remus’ cheek. “You’re going to have a wonderful time, sweetheart. You’ll be good for the Potters’, won’t you?”</p><p>            “Of course, mum,” Remus said, resting his cheek atop his mum’s curly head, just like his. He wanted nothing more than to get right back in the car and go with her to Wales but he knew she didn’t want the burden of having him around. So he would be a dutiful son and stay with the Potters and not complain. “Love you.”</p><p>            “Love you more,” his mum said, pulling back and smiling up at him. She cupped his cheek in her hand. “Talk soon, yeah?”</p><p>            Remus nodded and his mum pulled back, dropping her hand. She fished her keys out of her pocket and blew Remus a kiss. As she headed back out the front door Remus followed, standing in the doorway while his mum started up the car. He gave a little wave as she backed the car up and then disappeared down the driveway, leaving Remus behind.</p><p> </p><p>                                                            ***</p><p> </p><p>            Remus played video games for another hour with James until he got very tired of always losing. James showed Remus to the room he’d be staying in and then went back to it, switching to the Playstation. Remus dumped his rucksack out of the bed and began to put his stuff away in the closet and dresser. If he was going to be there for a few months he figured there was no reason to keep all his stuff crumpled in his rucksack.</p><p>            He put The Beatles on shuffle, letting the music calm him without his mum there. Yesterday came on and Remus breathed deeply in time to the music and letting Paul’s vocals wash over him. He could almost hear his mum singing along. It was one of her favorites and he ignored the ache it caused in his chest.</p><p>            Once all his stuff was away, he grabbed one of his books and settled onto the bed to read for a bit before dinner. It was nice to have a bit of peace and quiet for a while and just decompress. After a day of being around mostly strangers, his social anxiety was ramped up and all he wanted was to spend some time where he didn’t feel the need to speak or answer questions or have people in his face.</p><p>            By the time dinner was ready, he felt a bit more prepared to deal with people. It was a nice dinner, Mrs. Potter having made a roast with mashed potatoes and carrots. Remus didn’t really speak much, just enjoying the boisterous and lively conversation that the Potters kept up. Every once in a while Mr. or Mrs. Potter would ask him a question that he would politely answer.</p><p>            After dinner, James dragged Remus out for a late swim. Remus sat on the edge of the pool with his feet in the water while James swam laps. Remus was struck again by how surprisingly fit James was and how easily he seemed to glide through the water. Remus wondered idly if there was anything James wasn’t just instinctually good at. It didn’t seem like anything came hard to him and Remus couldn’t imagine what that must be like.</p><p>            James stopped doing laps and came over, resting his elbows on the edge of the pool next to where Remus was sitting. “So what’s your deal, Remus?”</p><p>            Remus raised an eyebrow. “My deal?”</p><p>            James grinned and for a moment Remus thought he looked so much like the thirteen-year-old Remus had known. Young and boyish and ready to misbehave. “Yeah, what’s your deal? I haven’t seen you in like three years. Still getting into mischief?”</p><p>            Remus chuckled and ducked his head down. If James knew just how entirely lame Remus really was he probably wouldn’t have been so anxious for Remus to come over for the summer. Remus found himself terrified of disappointing him. “That was your mischief, I was just along for the ride.”</p><p>            James cocked his head to the side and studied Remus for a moment. “Anyone special in your life?”</p><p>            “Special?”</p><p>            James’ lips curled into a devious smirk. “You know, girlfriend? Boyfriend? Favorite wank sock? Someone special.”</p><p>            Remus snorted and lay down, staring up at the sky. “Nope,” he said, resting his hand on his stomach. He felt it rise and fall as he took deep, even breaths. “No, no one special. What about you?”</p><p>            James hoisted himself up over the side and came to rest down beside Remus. “So there’s this girl Lily…”</p><p>            James proceeded to talk about his school crush for a good twenty minutes, going on about her red hair and her green eyes, the freckles all over the bridge of her nose and her slim shoulders. It was clear James was smitten but for whatever reason this Lily didn’t seem to give him the time of day. Remus smiled slightly, glancing over and watching James talk animatedly about Lily, his arms waving about as he regaled Remus of the last time he’d tried to ask her out before the term ended. He had gotten her a bouquet of lilies and put them on her bed in the dormitory. He’d received them back in a garbage bag, all cut to pieces.</p><p>            “She sounds intense,” Remus said, his eyebrows practically to his hairline.</p><p>            James laughed. “She’s wonderful. I don’t think I’ll ever love anyone else as long as I live. Sometimes you just know, right?”</p><p>            Remus sighed heavily and carded his fingers through his wet hair. “No idea, mate,” he confessed. At sixteen, Remus hadn’t even kissed anyone or held anyone’s hand. It was utterly pathetic but Remus wasn’t about to tell James all about that and let James in on just how much of a loser Remus was. “I’ve never really felt that way about anyone before. At least not anything more than a small crush.”</p><p>            James sat up and stared down at Remus. “Whoa, are you telling me you’ve never even snogged anyone?”</p><p>            Remus felt his cheeks heat up in embarrassment. “I mean…not…not as such. No. I’ve never snogged anyone.”</p><p>            James’ jaw dropped. “That’s just unacceptable!” he said, shaking his head incredulously. Then his eyes light up like he’d just gotten a brilliant idea. “I’ll snog you if you want!”</p><p>            Remus sat up and hung his head with his shoulders up by his ears. “That’s okay, James. It’s nice of you to offer but I’m good.”</p><p>            James put his hand on Remus’ shoulder and gave it a squeeze. “Well if you change your mind the offer still stands, Moony.”</p><p>            “Moony?”</p><p>            James laughed. “I’m an expert at coming up with nicknames. Remus is the name of the guy raised by wolves right? Wolves, moons, Moony. Clever, huh?”</p><p>            Remus snorted. “Sure, whatever you need to tell yourself.” Remus reached forwards and splashed some water at James. James sputtered for a moment and then his eyes glinted with mischievousness. He dropped back into the water and dragged his hands through it, sending a tidal wave at Remus.</p><p>            They kept the fighting up until both were fairly waterlogged so they called a truce. “Come on, let’s get out, I’m all pruney.”</p><p>            James handed Remus a towel and they padded inside. It was nearly midnight and Remus was surprised his first day at the Potters’ had gone by so quickly. James let Remus take the first shower and Remus rinsed himself off quickly so that he didn’t keep James waiting for his own shower.</p><p>            As he went back to his room, shocked beyond belief that he was able to find it without help, he dressed into a clean pair of pants and a sleep shirt. It was sweltering night, the air thick with the heat. The Potters had supplied him with a fan that helped circulate the air in the room. The noise of it was a dull hum that filled the large empty room that was nearly twice the size of Remus’ room back home.</p><p>            Remus had never been good at sleeping at other people’s houses. It made him feel weird, like he was intruding in someone else’s life. Not that he’d been invited to many sleepovers in the past. But it was an unfamiliar feeling to sleep in a bed that wasn’t his. He found himself unable to fall asleep, staring at the ceiling and listening to the creaking of the large house settling.</p><p>            Once it hit one o’clock in the morning, Remus gave up on the idea of sleep and found his way downstairs to the kitchen. He got himself a glass of water and sipped it slowly, feeling the cold water slide down his throat and ease the tension he felt. He figured it would be a few nights before he’d feel comfortable enough at the Potters’ to fall asleep at a decent hour. He stared out the window, watching the rain pinging against the glass. The rain did nothing to abate the heat that sat heavy in the air.</p><p>            A loud banging on the door had Remus almost dropping his glass. He made sure to set it down quickly before he made a mess. His kept his footsteps light as he made his way to the front door. “James! Mrs. Potter! Mr. Potter! Is anyone awake? Hello!”</p><p>            Remus blinked dumbly at the door, debating what to do. Whoever was at the door clearly knew the Potters but he wasn’t sure he should be letting strangers into the house at this hour. Besides, it wasn’t his house and he shouldn’t be answering the door anyway. He stood stock still, wracked with indecision, wondering if he should go get someone. It didn't seem right to wake up the Potters at that time of night but he couldn't leave them outside until morning. </p><p>            “Come on! Buggering fuck! It’s god damn raining! Someone please be fucking awake!”</p><p>            Remus felt bad leaving whomever it was out in the rain. Before he could think better of it, Remus wrenched the door open and the figure turned with a phone pressed to their ear. There were a few bags by his feet and it looked like most of his life had been packed away.</p><p>            “Who the fuck are you?” he asked, frowning at Remus.</p><p>            That was when Remus first met Sirius Black.</p><p> </p>
