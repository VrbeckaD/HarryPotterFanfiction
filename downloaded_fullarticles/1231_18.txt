    <p>Hermione looked up at her captors in fear. Never had she dreamed, in all the crazy scenarios she had conjured up in her head, that she might actually be separated from Harry and Ron – she just hoped that they had escaped from the burrow unharmed. <br/>A crack stung her cheek and she started, realising that Bellatrix Lestrange had just slapped her across the face. She had been lost in thought.<br/>“Well? I asked you a question.” Bellatrix’s imperious voice cut through her mind. “Where is Harry Potter?”<br/>Hermione could do nothing but answer honestly. “I don’t know.”<br/>Bellatrix pushed her face so close that Hermione could smell her breath “I don’t believe you.” Her voice was dangerously soft. “The cruciatus curse ought to loosen your tongue.”<br/>Then Hermione did something she would regret for the rest of her life. She begged.<br/>“Please,” she whispered, tears slipping down her face, “I’m telling the truth.”<br/>“Bella.” Narcissa Malfoy cut in. “Is this really necessary?”<br/>“Are you defending the mudblood? I think the Dark Lord would be interested in knowing where you’re loyalties lie, dear sister.”<br/>Narcissa slipped back into the shadows.<br/>“Crucio!”<br/>Hermione screamed, every inch of her body on fire, wracked with pain, unable to think through a fog of pain.<br/>And then it was over.<br/>She felt woozy, unable to see through a haze of agony.<br/>“Still unsure?” It was Bellatrix. “Very well. Put her in the cellar. We’ll speak again when the Dark Lord is ready.”<br/>The last thing Hermione felt was a pair of arms scooping her up and a warm body holding her close before she drifted into unconsciousness.</p>
