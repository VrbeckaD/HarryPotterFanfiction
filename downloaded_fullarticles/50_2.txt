    <p>Harry trooped in to the Puddlemere United showers, feeling absolutely miserable. His blue and gold Quidditch robes dripped on the ground and he could barely see from the mud he was drenched in. His neck ached from the face-first slide he'd just completed across the muddy quidditch pitch. He'd spent some time practicing the move again, trying to blow off steam while the others showered, once Wood had gotten through with yelling himself hoarse about how crappily they'd just practiced. It was like Hogwarts Quidditch days all over again.</p><p>Yeah, they got it, their next league match was in two days. If they won against the Arrows, they'd lead the league going into the playoffs and actually have a shot at the league cup. In the four years Oliver Wood had been on Puddlemere United, they'd narrowly missed the top of the bracket each time. Since he'd become Captain the year previous, he had been on a personal mission to get the League Cup at any cost. It was just like the house cup for him.</p><p>Unfortunately for Oliver, the weather had been abysmal all week and there was no spark left in the team running up to game day. Harry didn't have an answer for it, at least not one Wood wanted to hear. And he didn't even want to look Oliver in the eyes after the stupid fumbles he'd made all day with the snitch.</p><p>Harry noticed one shower was still on while he pulled off his arm and shin pads, probably Wood trying to drown himself again. That hadn't changed a bit. It made Harry's stomach flip guiltily, but there wasn't much he'd be able to do about it.</p><p>He hissed in pain as he slid his shoulder pads up and off himself. He'd taken a budger to the back that he'd thought hadn't hurt much, but it was all catching up to him. The water in the next room shut off and Harry kept his eyes on the floor as the sound of bare feet padded out of the stalls.</p><p>"Harry? What're you still doin' here?" Wood's Scottish burr came from the doorway.</p><p>"Nothing, Wood. Just waiting till everyone's out so I can have some quiet."</p><p>"Is somethin' the matter?"</p><p>"Er, no. Just tired."</p><p>Harry let his eyes flit up to Wood's, the keeper was staring down his nose at him.</p><p>"I'm not an idiot, Potter. You look like you've just been dragged around the pitch by the nose and kicked for good measure."</p><p>"You saw that slide and bludger I took, yeah? Same difference."</p><p>"You took a bludger? Where?" Wood asked, his hazel eyes suddenly dark and worried.</p><p>"Between the shoulders, honestly, it's nothing..." Harry coughed, his breath hitching in pain.</p><p>"Let me see." Wood demanded.</p><p>"You mean, like..."</p><p>"Yes, Potter. Take it off."</p><p>Harry obeyed, trying to pull his shirt up, but his stiffening shoulders wouldn't allow for the movement to happen.</p><p>"I need help. I can't..."</p><p>Oliver gently rolled up the edge of Harry's shirt until the bruise revealed itself. The pads had taken most of the impact but there was still a generous mark.</p><p>"Let's get you in the shower. Hot water will do you some good." Wood said matter-of-factly. He helped Harry out of his shirt and the rest of his robes, going for the band of his drawers before Harry stopped him.</p><p>"Hold on, I can do that myself. I'm not a little kid." He said.</p><p>"Right, right. Sorry, Potter."</p><p>Wood helped him stand up and supported him into the shower stall. Harry's stiffened back made it hard to move right.</p><p>"Merlin's beard, I fucked myself royally." Harry swore. "It was just a bludger and a fall, what even..."</p><p>"Does your neck hurt?" Oliver asked.</p><p>"Only a little." Harry replied. "Trying to catch the snitch with your face does that to a player."</p><p>In spite of himself, Wood let a little chuckle loose as he turned the hot water on. He leaned against the doorway, eyes fixed on the back wall of the showers.</p><p>"As long as you don't have a concussion. If I lose another player to St. Mungo's, I'll-"</p><p>"-Eat your broom, I know." Harry finished, taking his glasses off and setting them on the soap rack.</p><p>"...I said that earlier, didn't I. I sound like such an insufferable prat."</p><p>"Prat? No. Insufferable, maybe..." Harry replied. "You could lighten up a little, we're dying out there."</p><p>"What does that mean?" Oliver bristled.</p><p>"Look, Wood. You don't have to push so hard. The team knows they're doing a bad job of it, and they're going to turn it around in time. Maybe just lay off the pressure a little as we come up to the game so everyone can problem-solve themselves and get into it? Support a little more?"</p><p>Wood was silent, making Harry think he'd gone too far, but he couldn't see the Keeper's face without his glasses on.</p><p>"Erm, sorry. I just was thinking off the top of my head. You're the captain, you make the decisions."</p><p>"No, Harry. You've a point. I guess in my desperation, I lose track of what's important. Thank you."</p><p>"Erm, no problem."</p><p>The shower room was quiet except for the running water, Harry put his head under the spray to gather his thoughts for a moment. When he emerged, Wood was speaking again.</p><p>"-en a right awful git, Harry. I don't think about anything but quidditch and it shows. I'm nigh on the worst captain this team has seen. Charlie would be disappointed in me if I told him in my letters."</p><p>"Don't you think you're being a bit dramatic?" Harry asked. "You can make mistakes without being the worst captain in history. Remember that they still let the Cannons play."</p><p>Wood snorted. "No idea why. Their captain doesn't know which way is up on a broom."</p><p>"Exactly. You don't need to be so harsh on yourself- Oh, bloody hell!" Harry yelped as he reached his arms up to soap his hair. His shoulders twinged in pain.</p><p>"Here, get the water a little hotter." Oliver said, reaching over and turning the knob. Harry hissed as the scalding water hit him. He reached out for where he thought the soap rack was to re-soap his hands, but his hand connected with Oliver's warm chest.</p><p>"Oh, erm. Sorry. I can't see." Harry mumbled.</p><p>"Here, let me get it." Oliver replied. Harry heard the sound of him lathering his hands, then gentle fingers began to comb through his ebony hair.</p><p>The shower was silent as Oliver worked the soap into his messy hair, standing close enough Harry could feel the heat radiating off of him. Harry had never been this close to Oliver before. Sure they'd been in the showers at the same time loads of times before, but not in the same stall, not like this. He wasn't opposed, he hadn't been touched in any way in what felt like ages, but he had no clue what he should be doing either.</p><p>"Want me to stop?" Oliver asked, noticing his silence.</p><p>"What? No, I'm fine. I just haven't had anyone do this before. It feels nice."</p><p>"Famous Harry Potter has never had a witch climb in the shower and show him a little worship in all your nineteen years?" Wood teased. "Seems hard to believe."</p><p>"Not really. I'm not really good with romance, or, people in general for that matter. It's the famous part that gets in the way. And I'm eighteen still, my birthday is Saturday." Harry replied. He shifted uncomfortably. Every game, wizards and witches lined up to get his autograph, causing a bit of a weird dynamic with the others on the team. Harry didn't like it much, they were only interested in him for his name. Same with the people he'd bring back to his flat for an awkward quick shag. They just wanted the honor of shagging the famous Harry Potter.</p><p>"Sorry." Wood said gently, turning Harry so his back was to him and he could work on the back of his hair. "I didn't mean it like that." He began to circle his thumbs down the back of Harry's neck. "Your birthday is the day of the big game? That's some shite luck, I'm sure you wanted to be out celebrating-" Harry cut him off with a yelp as a sore spot twinged.</p><p>"Got a bruise going here, Potter." Oliver said, inspecting the spot.</p><p>"I hit the stands at one point. I practiced like a load of dung today." Harry replied morosely.</p><p>"I saw the dive you made after the team talk, that one was all right." Oliver offered. He massaged down to the base of Harry's neck and moved to go after the tight muscles in his shoulders.</p><p>"Yeah, but you missed the one right after where the wind caught me at the bottom and I bounced into the photographer's pit. I'm lucky I didn't break my neck on the bench."</p><p>"Merlin's beard!" Oliver exclaimed. "Do you know how to be careful, Potter? You're the only capable seeker I have. If you break your neck out there, I'll have to put Bran in, and he's hopeless. Doesn't know a snitch from a quaffle."</p><p>"Sorry, Wood. I was off my game today. These next couple days I'll work on my nerves and be ready for the game."</p><p>"There's that Gryffindor spirit." Oliver said warmly. He gently turned Harry to him, and before Harry knew what was happening, he'd pressed their lips together.</p><p>"Oh-" Harry gasped in surprise. He was cut off by Wood renewing the kiss, pressing their lips together even harder. Harry's back hit the wall of the shower with a wet thud, making him moan in both pain and surprise as the cold, wet tiles hit his bruised back. He scrambled his hands to Oliver's shoulders, pulling the bigger man so they were flush against each other, shower cascading down over their heads. Harry eagerly chased Oliver's lips with his own, nipping and sucking at his mouth.</p><p>"Oliver..." Harry panted when Wood pulled back for air.</p><p>"Potter..." The older man growled. "Fancy a go at it? Now?"</p><p>"Y-yes." Harry gasped in reply. Oliver's lips were back on his in an instant, knocking his head back into the tiles. He barely noticed, feeling Wood's body pinning him to the wall. Oliver was all muscle, eclipsing Harry's smaller frame. He could feel Oliver's hard-on pressing into his stomach, moaning when Oliver gripped both their cocks in one hand, giving an experimental tug. Harry had never felt anything quite like it, between the warm water and the sensation of Oliver's larger hand squeezing their lengths together.</p><p>"You done this before, Potter?" Wood groaned as he fisted them, barely pulling away from Harry's swollen lips.</p><p>"Y-yeah. A few times." Harry gasped in reply.</p><p>"Top or bottom?" Oliver asked.</p><p>"B-both, ah-!" Harry yelped as Oliver attacked his neck, suckling at a sensitive spot.</p><p>"Well, well..." Oliver purred. "Potter's gotten around." He turned Harry around, pinning him to the wall. Harry felt his hot flesh slide across the cold wall and gasped at the sensation. Oliver muttered a simple lubrication spell, and began tracing Harry's hole with two slick fingers. Harry moaned as they entered him easily and began pumping. His dick ached with anticipation, pinned between his stomach and the tiles almost painfully. Oliver added a third finger, drawing a moan from him that echoed around the showers lewdly.</p><p>"Ready, Potter?" Oliver hissed. Harry nodded, biting his lip. Oliver muttered the lubrication spell again, fisting his hard cock a few times before pulling Harry's hips toward him, canting the smaller man's body at a better angle. He slowly began to push in, their combined moans mingling in the steamy air.</p><p>"Merlin's beard, Harry..." Oliver gasped.</p><p>"Fucking, move, Wood." Harry choked out. Oliver responded with a short rock of his hips, pushing deeper and deeper into Harry until he was fully seated inside. He began to give short thrusts, pulling Harry's hips onto his with a wet slapping sound.</p><p>"Oh-oh-oh!" Harry panted as the angle brushed the head of Oliver's cock against his prostate. Oliver was groaning, keeping up the fast pace of his thrusts. Neither of them were going to last long.</p><p>"Can I pull your hair?" Wood panted into his ear, biting Harry's shoulder.</p><p>"Yes, yes!" Harry groaned. Wood's long fingers were once again buried in his unruly locks, pulling at the roots and bringing his head back, arching his back.</p><p>"That's it..." Oliver moaned. "Ride my cock, Potter."</p><p>Harry brought a hand down to his aching cock, giving it something to thrust into.</p><p>"Fuck, Ol, I'm not gonna last..."</p><p>"Oh, oh, Harry..." Wood's legs were shaking. A moment later Harry felt wet heat burst inside him. He tightened his grip on his dick and was emptying his balls against the tile wall a second later.</p><p>They stood there a moment, panting into the steamy shower. Harry's jizz was slowly dripping down the wall. Oliver pulled out, washing himself off in the shower's stream. Harry could barely feel his legs as he came down from his orgasm, unable to move his hands away from the wall as he panted. He could feel cum leaking down his leg, but his brain wasn't working well enough to clean himself up yet.</p><p>"Here, let me take care of you." Oliver rumbled. Harry felt the soap gently slide over his shoulders, around and over his chest, down to his softening cock. Oliver gently caressed the sensitive flesh there and moved down his legs, washing away the cum dripping down Harry's legs and moving up to his arse to gently rinse away the lube as well.</p><p>"Wow, Oliver." Harry finally said, his brain returning to form cohesive thought. "That was brilliant."</p><p>"Not so bad yourself." Oliver murmured, pressing a kiss to the back of Harry's head. "Let's get out of the shower though, you're beginning to prune."</p><p>Harry straightened up and took an experimental step. His legs were like jelly. And he couldn't see a thing. Oliver wrapped an arm around his waist and helped him limp out of the shower to a bench.</p><p>"Accio towel." Oliver said. A clean towel soared over from the hamper and Harry gratefully accepted it. Wood went to turn off the shower and returned, pressing the damp frame of Harry's glasses into his hand. Harry put them on and was able to fully see his Captain in front of him, looking debauched. Wood's cheeks were red and his lips were swollen, a flush running down his neck and chest. Harry swallowed hard.</p><p>"Like what you see now that you can see it?" Wood asked, his eyes sparkling. Harry could now see his long length dangling between slapped-red thighs, just underneath a chiseled set of abs. Harry flushed hard.</p><p>"Hurry up and get dressed, I'm famished." Oliver said, summoning his own towel and beginning to dry his chest. "Buy you a pint and you can decide if you want to come over for more."</p><p>Harry swallowed as his thighs clenched unconsciously. That was... a tempting bargain. Wood flashed him a winning grin as he toweled his short hair.</p><p>"Make it a pint and a burger and you can have me all night." He found himself replying.</p><p>"Deal, Potter." Wood said, flashing him another grin and a devilish wink. Harry felt his stomach flip over excitedly.</p>
