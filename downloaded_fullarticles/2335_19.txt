    <p dir="ltr">Harry sat at the dinner table with her Uncle Vernon, Cousin Dudley, Aunt Petunia, and Aunt Marge. She'd been listening to Aunt Marge rant about how terrible the Potters were, insulting them every second word.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry didn't retaliate, just ate her food politely. Until the gold lady said something that made Harry feel more than slightly irritated.</p><p dir="ltr">“It's no wonder they gave up that girl! After all, who would want such… damaged stock?” the awful old lady start chortling and so did Harry's relatives.</p><p dir="ltr">Light entered the edges of Harry's vision, and she knew that she was brimming with unreleased magic. She gave in to the “accidental” magic and let it defend he</p><p dir="ltr">Aunt Marge’s irritating laugh cut off suddenly as she started to cough. Harry couldn't see the effects of her spell, but she knew what was happening. From her eyes outwards, ugly cracks would be spreading across Aunt Marge’s face, down her neck, and across her chest.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the cracks wouldn't be permanent, they were going to scar, even if healed by a Healer from St Mungos.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry accio’d her belongings, left the house, and raised her arm, wand in hand. There was a bang, and a massive triple decker bus appeared in the street.</p><p dir="ltr">“Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve–” the yellow and black conductor was cut off as Nebula flew right at his head, then perched herself on one of the seats.</p><p dir="ltr">“What kind o’ bloody owl is tha’? It's massive!”</p><p dir="ltr">“Didn't ask. London. Leaky Cauldron.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Eleven sickles, unless you want ‘ot chocolate, that's an extra 3, or 15 for an ‘ot water bottle an’ a toofbrush in the colour of your choice.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry passed over 11 sickles and went to find a seat.</p><p dir="ltr">“What's yer name? Why ya got yer eyes covered? Can ya even see through yer hair?”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry took a seat and didn't answer.</p>
<hr/><p> Harry turned to Mr Shunpike and tried something she hadn't dare do at school or the Dursleys. She looked right at the head of his silhouette and focused.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>‘-Black-infamous-prisoner-eluding-capture-mad-danger-twelve-years-murder-thirteen-curse</em>’</p><p dir="ltr">Harry closed her eyes and rubbed her temples.</p><p dir="ltr">'<em>Useless</em>.'</p>
<hr/><p> The Knightbus dropped Harry off at the leaky cauldron, and she as soon as she entered she spotted James, sitting in a charmed booth in the corner. She slid into the seat opposite him and waited for him to start the conversation.</p><p dir="ltr">“So, uh, how have you been? How was your year?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Fine.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I'm sorry for not sending you any letters last year, I had no idea what to say to you. I was, admittedly, pretty... <em>disappointed</em> when I heard that you'd been sorted into Slytherin, of all the houses, then Liam sends me a letter telling me that you'd made friends with a Malfoy!”</p><p dir="ltr">“Just a house. Draco's nice.”</p><p dir="ltr">“That's not the po- fine. We don't need to talk about this. Not now anyway. Your punishment has been dropped. You won't be expelled, despite that clearly being a Dark spell.” James was literally glowing with frustration.</p><p dir="ltr">“You'll be staying with us until Hogwarts starts again.”  Harry tilted her head.</p>
<hr/><p> The first few days at Potter Manor were awkward. The Potters were quite blatantly avoiding Harry, and she was bored out of her mind. She decided that her goal for the break was to find some way to read. Having to do all her exams one on one with Professor Snape drew some attention from observant students.</p><p dir="ltr">She raided the Potter library, looking for any sort of spell that could possibly aid her, but to no luck. She started expanding her search, going vaguer and vaguer, until she was seriously considering getting a mini locket portrait to read to her. If there was any spell, or any object, that could possibly help her, the Potter library didn't have any mention of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Whenever she did see her relatives, their colours became an ugly dark gold that she hadn't seen before. She was coming across more and more colours that she had no reference for. They had obviously taken offense (<em>‘Gold, pride. Dark, offense</em>?’) to her sorting and friendship with Draco, which was still unresolved after the Polyjuice incident.</p>
<hr/><p>Harry's sat alone on the train, until Draco found her.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey, Harriet.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Draco.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I'm sorry about getting so mad at you. I guess I can understand why you would think Gregory and Vincent weren't my friends. I thought about it for a long time, and eventually I realised that I overreacted.’”</p><p dir="ltr">“No. Didn't understand. Liam. Mr Weasley. Polyjuice.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What?! What do you mean?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Not Crabbe, Goyle. Liam, Mr Weasley. Polyjuice. Confusing.”</p><p dir="ltr">“So it wasn't Gregory and Vincent, it was Potter and Weasley using Polyjuice. You knew it was them, and thought I knew too, so you were confused by me letting them into the common room?” his ability to understand her was very helpful.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh wow. I had the completely wrong idea.” They sat in silence, until the train stopped.</p><p dir="ltr">“The lanterns just went out. Did the train break down?” Harry could feel something cold coming down the corridor. She opened the compartment door, the immediately closed it, backing away.</p><p dir="ltr">“What's wrong? What's out there?” Harry just shook her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“Don't know. Bad. Very bad.” The cold grew more pronounced. The door started to slide open.<br/>
A mass of oily black shadows and coils entered the compartment. She saw Draco's colours start to seep away from him and into the shadows, and she held tightly to her own. The thing left. Harry followed it down the corridor, a safe distance away. She watched it enter another compartment and be driven out by a blinding light.</p>
