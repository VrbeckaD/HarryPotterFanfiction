<p>“Now, you, Mr Malfoy. Please sign here and here,” the solicitor instructed.</p>
<p>Nodding, Draco accepted the quill and signed. </p>
<p>Once he was done, the solicitor tapped it with his wand and it rolled up, disappearing with a pop. </p>
<p>Draco exhaled. </p>
<p>“Congratulations,” said Astoria dryly. “You’re free of me.” </p>
<p>Draco raised an eyebrow. “And you of me,” he reminded her.</p>
<p>She smiled. “Point.” Placing her hand on his arm, she said, “Be happy, Draco.” And, rising, she moved gracefully out of the room. </p>
<p>The solicitor cleared his throat. “Do you have plans now, Mr Malfoy?” </p>
<p>Slowly, Draco smiled. “Indeed I do.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry opened the door, smiling when he saw Draco. “Hey— Oof!” </p>
<p>Draco, surging forward, kissed Harry and kicked the door closed behind him. Walking Harry backwards, he pressed him against the wall as he deepened the kiss. </p>
<p>When they surfaced for air, Harry chuckled softly. “I take it you’re finally free?” </p>
<p>“Indeed I am,” Draco said. </p>
<p>“How’d Astoria take it?” </p>
<p>“She was as eager as I.” Draco smirked. “I imagine she’s celebrating with her lover right now.” </p>
<p>Harry’s hands settled on Draco’s arse. “Well then, what’re <i>we</i> waiting for?” </p>
<p>Draco hummed as Harry manoeuvred him towards the bedroom. “Absolutely nothing.” </p>
