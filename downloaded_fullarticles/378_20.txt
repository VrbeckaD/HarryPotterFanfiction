  <em>Well being sent into a fanficional world can't be that bad, I may not know jack shit about this place seeing how that was my sister's thing but it can't be that bad.</em>
</p><p>This was me last month. It's only taken me less then half of that time to realized that <strong>half of the shit </strong><strong>my sister had ever mentioned about this place was a lie.</strong></p><p>"Emma! can we play tag again?" <em>Kid we've been playing tag for the past 4 hours. </em></p><p><em><strike>Your over exaggerating, it's only been less</strike> </em><strike><em>than-</em></strike> <strike><em>that you lazy fu-</em> </strike><em> <strong>S</strong></em><strong><em>hut the hell </em><em>u</em></strong><em><strong>p</strong> </em><em><strong>brain.</strong> </em><strike></strike><em><br/></em></p><p><strike></strike>I cant really remember what happened that had caused me to be here, I was just minding my own business when I blacked out and the next thing I knew I was in a smaller version of my own body in the middle of the street. Of course I was taken in by the police and after a few weeks of no one coming forward to claim me I was sent to a place where no child would ever want to go to.</p><p>
  <em>Wool's Orphanage.</em>
</p><p>Yeah you see my problem here? </p><p>During my stay here I somehow won the affections of some of the younger children here, which makes it easier for me to blend in and not stand out too much to our resident sociopath. </p><p>
  <em>Boy if only it was that simple.</em>
</p><p>Many knew of Tom Riddle, in my own world he was my personal eye candy but over here he was a total nightmare. Honestly though I wouldn't blame the poor bastard due to his circumstances however it still wouldn't take away much from the fact that the dudes fucked up.</p><p>
  <em>"Now where did I put that stick at-"</em>
</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>
  <em>
    <strong>FUCK</strong>
