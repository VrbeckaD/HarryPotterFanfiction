  <strong>Chapter 1- Gone Since MidnightÂ </strong>
</p><p dir="ltr">Harry woke up the same way he had almost 8 nights in a row. With Ron shaking him awake, and Hermione asking if it was another nightmare. Unfortunately it was, but there was nothing either of them could do about it. Even dreamless sleep potion had it's negatives. Harry didn't know if he preferred a minimal amount of sleep with nightmares, or no nightmares but feeling extremely sleep deprived all week.</p><p dir="ltr">He weakly sat up on the plush Gryffindor armchair he'd fallen asleep on. With all the nightmares still plaguing his mind, having little naps when he could helped more than dreamless sleep potion.</p><p dir="ltr">"What time is it?" He asked while rubbing his eyes and mumbling slightly in the effort to make sure that Hermione didn't find out what he was doing. Or rather, what was in his mouth. Because if she knew he had a mandrake leave under his tongue then she'd certainly know why.</p><p dir="ltr">"Its almost midnight. Me and Ron decided to stay while you were asleep. We had a lot of homework anyway." She shrugged, sounding very convincing. But Harry saw through it, they were both exhausted. It wasn't right, he felt that he'd put them through so much they shouldn't have to miss their sleep because of him too.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry smiled despite himself, his friends really were the best out there. He didn't know many people who'd stay awake for him. But as anyone would, he felt bad. It was their choice but Harry didn't want them to have to do all this. Especially not for him.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm going to head out." He decided on the spot. He'd been doing it a lot recently and tonight was meant to be the best one yet. Tonight it could all go perfect or terrible, this was the first major step to doing something amazing. Something to make his parents- and Sirius and Remus- proud.</p><p dir="ltr">"Harry, mate you need to go sleep. You've not been eating or sleeping." Ron reasoned. Only if he knew how hard it was to do <em>anything</em> while keeping a large leaf under his tongue.</p><p dir="ltr">"No it's fine, you go sleep. Don't wait for me." He said, going upstairs grab his cloak and a few other things he took every time he went out.</p><p dir="ltr">"Okay, but don't stay out too long." Hermione sighed, putting her hand on his shoulder before going with Ron to pack up their homework.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll try not to." Harry whispered, only to himself. He pulled out his invisibility cloak and hauled his bag onto his shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">He counted himself lucky that for a month, no one had pointed out that he was barely eating and didn't talk unless absolutely necessary (excluding Hermione and Ron). Most people linked it to the war and his lack of communication and depriving himself of food sounded like a serious mental health issue. Even though it wasn't an illness, it was linked to the war. He needed a way to <em>escape</em> and leave everything behind whenever things got too hard to handle.</p><p dir="ltr">Walking slowly, Harry went to his usual secret spot. He sat behind a tree, on the brink of the forbidden forest, which he'd carved his name on to. Using the bushes beside it to prop his bag up, he placed his cloak in his bag and took out a jar.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry used a spell that Hermione taught him, pointed his wand to the jar and muttered a spell. A bright, golden flame grew inside it and it lit up the area around him. Harry then- using the light of the flame- reached in his bag and retrieved an ancient, dusty and rather heavy book. It fell on the grass with a thud and Harry delicately flicked thought the pages till he found what he was looking for.</p><p dir="ltr">He found the animagus chapter and kept going till he reached the end of that particular chapter. His eyes scanned the page for the instruction he needed and when he found it, he picked a tiny vial out of his bag. He grinned up at the full moon above him and took out the leaf. It glistened in the moonlight and Harry dropped it into the vial.</p><p dir="ltr">He glanced up at the moon that was as bright as ever and for the second time that night, felt like his luck was staying longer than it usually did. If the moon happened to be hiding behind clouds, he would've had to start again by keeping that 'bloody stupid leaf' in his mouth for another month.</p><p dir="ltr">This was already his second attempt, because the first time he had a mandrake leaf in his mouth, it fell out in his sleep. He was 2 weeks in and woke up to an empty feeling in his mouth. No one understood why he was so irritable for the next few days.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry got another few vials out of his bag, these were ingredients that he'd prepared a while back incase he got this far. If he didn't have these ready, he would have to start again and that would probably put him off trying to become an animagus ever again.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry mixed the dew in with the leaf and followed every instruction, with utmost precision. When everything was in, he found an area of grass where the moonlight reached the ground without the trees blocking it's path. He placed the vial there and read on. It needed to stay in direct moonlight for a few hours at the very least, so he read what he should do afterwards.</p><p dir="ltr">He frowned when he saw that even though he might not have to begin all over again, he could end up having to wait double the time he'd already spent. After the potion was completed, he had to wait for a storm that was complete with lightning.</p><p dir="ltr">If he didn't wait, there would be disastrous results. There was examples of people who had mid-transformed but didn't complete the transformation. Also they had to live being a half animal. For example there was a story of a which who didn't wait and lived the rest of her life as a half-witch, half- crocodile.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry knew he was going to have to wait. But there hadn't been many storms yet. All the storms that he had experienced throughout his Hogwarts years had been at random times, so it really was unpredictable.</p><p dir="ltr">He knew he'd be staying down here for the majority, if not the whole night. Partly why he'd told his friends not to wait for him. It was dangerous though, staying on the edge of the forbidden forest during a full moon, so he cast a protective and warming charm over his area and watched as a blue dome was cast above him. It soon faded and turned invisible, the only way you knew it was there was by the faint reflections of moonlight.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry lay down (not bothering to cast a drying spell on the damp grass) and used his bag as a pillow. He was tired beyond belief and so it wasn't surprising when he fell asleep within a few minutes, falling into a dream world that could be filled with his happiest memories or worst fears. Only for Harry, it was almost always the latter.</p><p dir="ltr">He woke up and defensively grabbed his wand, pointing it at nothing. It was a habit he aquired in the days hunting for horcruxes. Except now, it was an unnecessary habit and he often found himself aiming at his friends with a harmful curse on his tongue.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry doubled checked his bag, just to make sure he'd added the ingredients and not left any. When he was certain that so far, everything was going smoothly he cast another protective charm and read on. A tempus charm revealed it had only been a few hours and decided to try his luck at getting more sleep. After all, naps that actually made Harry feel better were few and far between.</p><p dir="ltr">He woke up again a few hours before sunrise. His body was aching with the cold since his weak warming spell had worn off, making him vulnerable to the October weather. The moon was no where in sight and he wasn't sure how long it'd been gone. However the potion looked good so far and the description in the book matched it perfectly.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry put a stopper on the top and carefully packed everything into his bag. He opened his cloak and covered himself with it. Breathing in the cool air, he stepped across the grass. At the last second though, he didn't decide to go to his dorms. Instead, Harry went another way. He kept his cloak on, carefully avoiding Filch at one point.</p><p dir="ltr">After a few minutes he'd arrived in the astronomy tower. He'd always thought this place was beautiful since 6th year. That's when he realised the amazing view and how much of a good place it was to think. Harry had found himself many times in this place.</p><p dir="ltr">He took his cloak off and stood leaning against the wall. The breeze brushed his face and Harry was there for over an hour. He watched the sunrise and saw it flood the school with golden sunlight.</p><p dir="ltr">He felt relaxed, being alone usually did help. He liked being alone, just not for too long. Without his friends he'd be in a pretty bad place and he knew that. With the mandrake leaf in his mouth, it had been really hard to eat and he resorted to skipping most meals and simply having a drink.</p><p dir="ltr">His friends knew there was something wrong. They'd let it slide the first few times Harry had skipped lunch. But then it was breakfast, and even dinner. Harry knew he should attempt eating, or maybe find a spell that'd make it easier. But after a few days, part of him for used to skipping meals.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time he'd kept the mandrake leaf in his mouth for a month, the most he had was a few goblets of drink and possibly a piece of fruit in the morning and a toast at night. That's on a good day.</p><p dir="ltr">Today though, he was feeling a but better and decided to have at least an apple. Completing the first part of his animagus procedure generally put him in a better mood.</p><p dir="ltr">He walked down the stairs slowly, not in a rush to eat anyway. By the time he got there, it was still early and he was still in his attire from last night. Black joggers and a hoodie. The Great Hall was gaining more and more students and the Gryffindor table was almost full.</p><p dir="ltr">He spotted the 8th years and took a seat next to Hermione with Ron opposite. Ron was already well into his breakfast which consisted of so much food, Harry felt a little sick looking at it. Hermione on the other hand, was eating at a more reasonable pace and was therefore able to actually speak to Harry.</p><p dir="ltr">She looked at his outfit with confusion before she seemingly ignored it. Harry didn't think Ron had even noticed he wasn't wearing his uniform.</p><p dir="ltr">"Morning Harry, sleep well?" Hermione asked.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yeah it was alright." Harry replied.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mate, what's up with your clothes?" Asked Ron when his mouth was empty enough for anyone to understand what he was saying.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll get changed after breakfast. Forgot to do it before." Harry replied shortly. He picked up an apple and took tiny bites off it. Harry was probably fidgeting more than actually eating.</p><p dir="ltr">"Are you having anything at all for breakfast?" Hermione questioned, genuine concern in her voice.</p><p dir="ltr">"You've not had a proper meal in days- maybe weeks!" Ron added.</p><p dir="ltr">"Not hungry."</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione, who'd had this conversation with Harry precisely four times, let out a frustrated but worried sigh. Ron stopped eating and set his fork and knife down a little forcefully.</p><p dir="ltr">"Harry, you are going to eat <em>something. </em>Now." Ron demanded. He tried to stare Harry down but he underestimated his best mate.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry glared at him with an equal force. They stayed like that till Ron gave up and took another bite of his food.</p><p dir="ltr">"You know we're just worried Harry." Hermione said, putting a hand on his shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't need you to be worried for me. I don't need my best friends trying to look after me," Harry was standing up at this point and his voice became louder and harsher, "I don't need you both to try to become my parents because they died when I was a baby and guess what? I've managed just fine without them."</p><p dir="ltr">He left his half eaten apple on the table and shot one last dirty look at his friends before storming off. He decided in his mind that he didn't wasn't in the mood for anyone else trying to look after him.</p><p dir="ltr">Anger consumed him and he tried to bottle it. Unfortunately he wasn't that good at it and he was practically stomping his way to the dorms. He entered and the third years in the common room knew better than to interrupt him.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry dragged himself into the dorm room. He relished the silence of the room and crawled onto his bed. Deciding that it'd just be plain rude to show up to Herbology now, he didn't bother changing his clothes and opened his animagus book.</p><p dir="ltr">Neville casually entered the dorm after a few minutes. Harry folded his page, closed the book and frowned at Neville with a puzzled expression. Neville loved Herbology so it was extremely unclear to Harry as to why he was in the dorm rather than with the rest of the class.</p><p dir="ltr">"What are you doing?" Neville asked when he spotted Harry.</p><p dir="ltr">"I could ask you the same thing."</p><p dir="ltr">"I asked first." Neville insisted.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry sighed in defeat. He'd rather not have this chat with everyone in Gryffindor if he could help it. He just hoped Neville wouldn't go into over protective parent mode like his best friends. As much as he cared for them (and he knew they cared for him too), sometimes they did go a little over the top.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm skipping." Harry admitted.</p><p dir="ltr">"Me too." Said Neville in a serious tone.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry looked like he'd just watched Voldemort rise from the dead. Again. He couldn't believe his ears. Neville laughed at Harry's priceless expression and it took Harry a few beats to realise it was a joke.</p><p dir="ltr">"Nah, I'm messing with you Harry. I'm only here to grab my textbook. Hermione and Ron seemed to be worried about you by the way." He mentioned, pulling a thick, tattered book from a drawer and placing it in his bag.</p><p dir="ltr">"Tell them I'm fine." Harry told Neville in a rather monotone voice.</p><p dir="ltr">"I will. See you later."</p><p dir="ltr">When Neville left, a pang of guilt hit Harry. His friends cared for him so much and at breakfast he just put them down. He didn't even listen to them. The other thing that shot through Harry was hunger. At first the feeling of being hungry for longer than a few days was unbearable. But now he was able to ignore it.</p><p dir="ltr">Definately one of his worse habits was ignoring his hunger. Instead of eating to get rid of the feeling, he waited it out. There were multiple reasons he did this and as of now, he didn't feel he deserved anything after the way he had treated his friends.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry's second lesson was Transfiguration and he figured it wouldn't help him (or his grades) if he missed another lesson. Plus, Professor McGonagall could be rather scary when she was angry.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry forced himself to get up and change into his uniform. When he was ready, he slung his bag on one shoulder and dragged his feet down the stairs and to his classroom. The class was full but he wasn't yet late and sat in his seat, narrowly avoiding any points being deducted.</p><p dir="ltr">The tables only allowed two people to be sat on them and naturally, Ron and Hermione were sitting together. Harry dropped his bag beside an empty desk near the corner of the classroom and pulled his textbook out.</p><p dir="ltr">McGonagall strode to the front of the classroom and began explaining something along the lines of transfiguring plants into Merlin knows what. McGonagall was answering an equally complex question from Hermione when three certain Slytherins came strolling in as if they owned the place.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mr Malfoy, Mr Zabini and Miss Parkinson. Would you care to explain why you're so late?"</p><p dir="ltr">The three of them who we're previously laughing, immediately went silent. They avoided each other's eyes, knowing if they made contact they'd burst into a fit of giggles again.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ten points from Slytherin, don't be late again." McGonagall scolded.</p><p dir="ltr">The three of them went to the same desk but all of them couldn't sit. In the end, Draco was pushed of his chair by a snorting Pansy who was being helped by a snickering Blaise. Draco took one look at McGonagall's glare and looked around the classroom for an empty seat.</p><p dir="ltr">"Professor? There are no seats left."</p><p dir="ltr">"Next to Mr Potter, in the far corner." Said McGonagall, pointing in Harry's general direction.</p><p dir="ltr">Draco mouthed a 'you owe me' to his friends and sat down next to Harry. He huffed and groaned for a few minutes, being an overall drama queen before he finally quietened down.</p><p dir="ltr">He expected Harry to at least put up half a fight but he didn't even make a noise. Draco glanced a few times at Harry. He hadn't spoke to him at all this year, but something was definately wrong with Harry. He hadn't seen Harry laugh and barely seen him speak. Most of the time, the only place he saw Harry was in the corridors. He didn't even see Harry in the Great Hall with his friends that much anymore.</p><p dir="ltr">Nearly the whole Great Hall had heard some part of Harry's little outburst, Draco included. Saying he was shocked was an understatement. Sure, Harry was known for being a bit temperamental but he usually didn't say things like that to people he cared about.</p><p dir="ltr">He <em>never ever </em>bought his parents into it either.</p><p dir="ltr">The Harry next to him was almost a completely different person. It wasn't the boy who was the only one brave enough to pick a fight with Draco, or the person who saved his from that fiendyfyre. Or even the person who defeated the most vicious dark wizard ever. He seemed, empty and broken.</p><p dir="ltr">But Draco had other things on his mind. Fixing the golden boy wasn't one of his biggest concerns. He was sure it was just a phase Harry was going through. Pretty soon they'd be back to insulting each other in the corridors, just like the old days.</p><p dir="ltr">
