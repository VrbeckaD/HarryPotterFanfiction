    <p>Harry knew of the saying that the first defeat tended to sting the most, but the duel had ended far too quickly, without a single successful attack from his end. To make it worse, it'd been to an opponent who loved to humiliate with an angelic smile, and the fact that he was incapacitated by enchanted ropes and <em>tied up</em> rather than stunned or disarmed was only further proof of it.</p><p>“Do you surrender?” the offending prefect inquired.</p><p>“Never,” Harry declared, shooting him a withering glare, though with his cheeks flushed a furious red, he couldn't imagine it to be all that threatening.</p><p>“Well, I'll have to make you then, won't I?"</p><p>For a moment, Riddle actually seemed to contemplate it, with his immaculate brow creased in a subtle frown and two elegant fingers tapping his chin as though in thought. But Harry knew it was nothing but an act, for he had seem the smug smile that had crossed his featured for the fraction of a second, seen the glint in his eyes that clearly showed his satisfaction with himself and Harry's predicament.</p><p>“Now, what to do with you...”</p><p>However, before Harry could give a voice to scathing observations, Riddle actually caressed him with the tip of his wand, murmuring those sinful words so close to his ear and letting his wand glide along his jugular in a promise of what his <em>lips</em> could do instead, and it was far too easy to surrender to the urge to <em>moan</em>.</p><p>“Is that a yes?”</p><p>With his overloaded senses drowning out all rationale and reason, Harry could only nod.</p><p>“Good. Meet me in the Room of Requirement tonight, and we shall continue from where we left off,” Riddle decided, lips so tantalizingly close to grazing the shell of his ear, before pulling back and leaving – leaving him with a foggy brain and a heart threatening to leap from his throat as Riddle undid the binding spell as though on an afterthought.</p><p>“Bloody git!”</p><p align="center">***</p><p align="left"> </p><p>The Room of Requirement was a marvelous place indeed, the way it shifted into anything the one using it desired. Under Tom's command, it had been a library before, stuffed to the ceiling with every book on the Dark Arts he desired. It had also been a training room before, equipped with dummies that were a perfect copy of the living targets he normally went after.</p><p>Today, it was a bedroom – simple, but lavish – a place for lovers to indulge in one another's company in private.</p><p>Tom wouldn't comment on Harry's lack of surprise upon entering the room, for tonight, questioning him and his peculiar knowledge on Hogwarts and his person was a secondary objective.</p><p>Instead, he motioned for him to lie down, a smile forming on his lips when Harry was so eager to comply, kicking off his shoes and reclining on the soft mattress. On a bed as big, Harry couldn't have looked smaller and more vulnerable, a thought that intrigued and excited him.</p><p>“What shall I do to you?”</p><p>Tom's heart raced as, instead of giving him a verbal response, Harry bared his neck to him, eyes shut tightly and eyelids trembling in anticipation and fear alike, and he couldn't have been happier to fulfill the forbidden wish the seed of which he'd planted earlier that day.</p><p>“I'm not going to hurt you,” Tom murmured reassuringly, then finally lowered his lips to the base of Harry's neck, planting the first of many kisses upon tender skin. There was something he'd been itching to try, and if Tom wanted something, he would stop at nothing to obtain it.</p><p>Slowly, he let his mouth glide higher, leaving a trail of quick kisses behind before finally, they reached the center of Harry's throat, reveling in the sensation of Harry's pulse picking up in speed against his lips. And oh, how frantically Harry's heart was beating – like the heart of a cornered deer in the face of a barrel, like the fluttering of a hummingbird's wings – so fragile and delicate, even more so once he could feel Harry shiver underneath him. But Tom wanted more, wanted to gently <em>devour</em> the one who held a piece of his soul, until he was truly <em>his</em>.</p><p>“Do you trust me?” He heard himself ask, yet before Harry could give him even a nonverbal response, he had already tilted Harry's head to the side and scraped his teeth along Harry's jugular, relishing the delightfully sharp intake of breath that followed, how Harry's heart was beating so fast it was threatening to burst inside his ribcage – a sight Tom couldn't resist imagining vividly, with its vibrant reds splattering across the pristine white of his lover's ribs, across his own robes, like a canvas waiting to be filled and painted on.</p><p>“Tom, I-”</p><p>“Shhh, it's alright,” he soothed, keeping his tone as gentle as possible as he repeated, “I'm not going to hurt you.”</p><p>The words were murmured against tender skin, and once again, he could feel Harry shiver right against his lips, all but making him feel giddy as he alternated careful nips and kisses and gentle scraping, greedily drinking in the extraordinary sounds that were spilling from Harry's lips – moans and whimpers alternated by wistful sighs – and it was the contrast between the two extremes that made the tune so much more pleasant to his ears, so much more <em>enticing</em>.</p><p>“Tom... Tom..., <em>please</em>, I can't-”</p><p>And the way he all but <em>chanted</em> his name, like Tom was deity and demon at once whereas Harry was his chosen mortal, a sacrificial lamb scurrying into his arms on its own will, surrendering any semblance of pride and dignity, letting it make way for complete submission...</p><p>The more sinister part of Tom's that was coming to the surface couldn't help but revel in the power he held over Harry, so much he could feel the first subtle cracks to form on his immaculate mask as he thought of how <em>easy</em> it'd be to extinguish his Harry's life here and now, sink his teeth into the vulnerable veins bared to him so willingly, and the sensation was <em>exhilarating</em>.</p><p>And so, he went back to kissing, sucking, tasting, undoing Harry without touching his private parts even once, making him drown in utter bliss. It was an accomplishment he couldn't help but smirk at, smirk against Harry's racing pulse, eliciting more moans and shivers only he could coax from him.</p><p>Truly, Harry was his and his <em>alone</em>, and Tom was determined to not let anyone lay a single finger on him as he shattered and mended him.</p>
