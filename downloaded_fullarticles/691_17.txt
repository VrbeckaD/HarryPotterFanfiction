    <p>“So are we gonna talk about this or not?” You ask, mainly towards Ron and Hermione, both of whom just glare at you and Harry shakes his head. Ron had finally come back after weeks and Hermione was furious, rightly so in your opinion. But everyone just ignoring it clearly wasn’t working as the last two weeks had been filled with awkward silences, glaring, and A LOT of tension. </p><p> </p><p>You huff in annoyance and try to come up with a plan when you hear the soft hum of the radio.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Looking from a window above, it's like a story of love </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Can you hear me </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Came back only yesterday </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm moving further away </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Want you near me” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It hits you. <em> Dancing </em>. You walk over to the radio and turn it up, the other three shooting you confused looks. You walk towards Harry and offer him your hand. He smiles when he realizes your plan and happily accepts your hand and stands up. The two of you walk to the middle of the tent and start dancing.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “All I needed was the love you gave </em>
</p><p>
  <em> All I needed for another day </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And all I ever knew </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Only you” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>You look at Harry and nod towards Hermione. Harry nods and the two of you break apart, Harry going to Hermione and you to Ron. Both of them try to protest but you and Harry make them stand up and dance with you. Both Ron and Hermione are shooting you and Harry dirty looks but you ignore them.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Sometimes when I think of her name </em></p><p>
  <em> When it’s only a game </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And I need you </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Listen to the words that you say </em>
</p><p>
  <em> It’s getting harder to stay </em>
</p><p>
  <em> When I see you </em>
</p><p>
  <em> All I needed was the love you gave </em>
</p><p>
  <em> All I needed for another day </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And all I ever knew </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Only you” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry twirls Hermione to the center, while you spin Ron around to the center. Both you and Harry break away from Ron and ‘Mione and begin dancing together. Begrudgingly Hermione and Ron start dancing together.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> All I needed was the love you gave </em></p><p>
  <em> All I needed for another day </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And all I ever knew </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Only you” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry and you begin to sing along with the song, both of you throwing glances at Ron and Hermione. Ron starts singing along too and Hermione can’t hold back her smile and giggles. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “All I needed was the love you gave </em>
</p><p>
  <em> All I needed for another day </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And all I ever knew </em>
</p><p><em> Only you” </em> </p><p> </p><p>You all sing along to the ending with big goofy smiles on your faces. Harry walks over and turns the radio down again when it goes to commercial. You run towards Ron and Hermione and throw your arms around them for a group hug.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s good to see you guys smiling again.” You mutter to them. After you release them Hermione nods and Ron looks at her expectantly.</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione, I’m sorry I left. I regretted it the second I did it. I need you. I love you.” Ron admits, the last part is barely audible and you weren’t even sure Hermione heard until you looked at her face. She had tears in her eyes and her lip was trembling. </p><p> </p><p>It had been hard seeing your best friend, the strongest person you knew, be so destroyed over the last few weeks. She had cried herself to sleep when she thought you and Harry couldn’t hear. It killed both you and Harry to see her so crushed.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you too, you big idiot!” She yells smacking Ron’s arm before pulling him down for a hard kiss.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad the tent has two bedrooms…but we need to soundproof.” You whisper to Harry, who chuckles at you.</p><p> </p><p>“Why don’t we give the new lovebirds some privacy?” He whispers back with a cheeky grin on his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Why Mr. Potter I believe that is your best idea yet,” you tease following him back to your bedroom in the tent. You sit on the end of the bed while Harry casts a spell to muffle noises within and outside of your room. </p><p> </p><p>“You are brilliant my love,” Harry murmurs crossing the room to you.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not so bad yourself handsome,” you tease pulling him down to you and kissing him softly.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you Y/n.”</p><p> </p><p>“I love you too Potter.” </p><p> </p><p>“Cheeky,” Harry says with a wink.</p><p> </p><p>“Y/n, I need to ask you something…” he trails off looking down and fidgeting with his hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Go on,” you urge feeling a little nervous yourself, Harry was very rarely nervous with you. The last time he had been like this was when he told you about the Horcruxes and asked if you would come with him.</p><p> </p><p>“Y/f/n Y/l/n will you marry me?” Harry asks getting down on one knee in front of you and pulling out a ring.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, of course!” You shout pulling him up into a passionate kiss. When you finally break apart for air Harry slip the ring onto your finger.</p><p> </p><p>“Where on Earth did you get this?” You ask, examining your new ring, it was so beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you like it?” He asks hesitantly, shifting anxiously.</p><p> </p><p>“I love it, it’s gorgeous.”</p><p> </p><p>“It was my mother’s. I have my dad’s as well.” </p><p> </p><p>“How?” You inquire.</p><p> </p><p>“Remus, he was there that night too and he figured my mom and dad would want me to have them. He kept them and before we left this summer he gave them to me, said he wanted me to have them for when the time was right.” Harry explains blushing a bit at the end.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s wonderful, oh Harry are you sure you want me to have it? I mean it’s really important and-”</p><p> </p><p>“So are you. I know my mom would have wanted you to have it. You’re the one for me. That ring is meant for you. I love you.” He says pulling you into his side.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Harry, I love you too.” He gives you another quick kiss before the two of you walk out to the sitting area to tell Ron and Hermione. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey guys, we need to tell you something,” Harry says as the two of you walk into the room. Hermione and Ron who were snuggling together on the couch look over at the two of you.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s up?” Hermione asks quizzically, her eyes zooming in on your left hand. </p><p> </p><p>“OH MY GOD!” She shouts jumping up and away from Ron before tackling you into a hug.</p><p> </p><p>“Congratulations!” She says breathlessly after pulling away from you and giving Harry a big hug.</p><p> </p><p>“What the bloody hell’s going on?” Ron asks confused as he stands up, looking between the three of you completely lost.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re engaged,” you explain with a huge smile on your face.</p><p> </p><p>“Blimey, congrats you two,” Ron says shocked, he walks over and pulls you into a hug before shaking Harry’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, guys,” Harry says with a big goofy grin still on his face.</p><p> </p><p>“When’s the wedding?” Hermione asks excitedly.</p><p> </p><p>“After we kill you-know-who,” Harry says optimistically, he had, even more, to fight, for now, Voldemort had nothing to fight FOR.</p><p> </p><p>“We have everything to fight for, he has nothing to fight for. That’s the difference and that’s why we are going to beat him.” Harry proclaims confidently as he pulls you close to him. Hermione and Ron nod in agreement as they hug each other too. You believed in yourselves more than ever before because Harry was right, you were all fighting FOR something, and that is why you would win.</p>
