    <p>                WYLAN</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            Wylan Van Eck never asked to be a wizard, let alone asked to be sent to a bloody boarding school to learn how to be a better one.</p>
<p>            “What kind of name is Hogwarts anyways?” he mumbled, sinking deeper into his seat. He had known of his wizard heritage and powers since a young age, but didn’t know why his father was determined to send him away because of it. In his opinion, it all seemed rather pointless.</p>
<p>            His father, Jan Van Eck, sat across from him at his desk, a stern look hardening his features. He had just given his son a Hogwarts pamphlet explaining the school and its many elements, probably in hopes that Wylan would benefit from the strict but compassionate atmosphere. He pressed his fingertips together and exhaled through his mouth slowly.</p>
<p>            “It’s the name of the school,” his father said dully.</p>
<p>            Wylan folded his arms. “Thank you for clearing that up.”</p>
<p>            “Don’t get smart with me, boy,” his father snapped. “I thought I ought to tell you before your letter arrives.”</p>
<p>            “My letter?”</p>
<p>            “Your letter of acceptance. Every young wizard receives one when they come of age.” His father’s voice droned, as if he had rehearsed his words.</p>
<p>            “When I turn twelve?” Wylan asked.</p>
<p>            “Actually, <em>most </em>children receive one when they are eleven, but seeing as you were held back a year, I’m sure the administration got confused.”</p>
<p>            Of course. Van Eck was always eager to remind his son of his constant under comings and shameful grades.</p>
<p>            Wylan shifted uncomfortably in his seat, running a hand through his tangle of curls.</p>
<p>            “What do I need to do?” Wylan asked quietly, his voice tight.</p>
<p>            His father began to type numbers into his calculator, writing down numbers absentmindedly. “Raphael will take you to Diagon Alley tomorrow morning to gather and purchase your school supplies, and Martha is currently packing your things.”</p>
<p>            “Yes, but what do <em>I </em>need to do?” Wylan asked impatiently, restless to get out of his father’s office.</p>
<p>            His father looked at him over the rims of his reading glasses, and stared at him for a long moment, making Wylan’s skin crawl with his icy glare.</p>
<p>            “What you can do,” Van Eck hissed, “is pray to God that your teachers are merciful towards your incompetence in simple academic tasks. That you can slide through seven years of school without flunking every bloody class. That you find even a single person that can somehow tolerate you despite your insufferable condition. <em>That </em>is what you can do, dear Wylan.”</p>
<p>            Heat flickered across Wylan’s cheeks as his eyes began to sting. Somehow, Wylan knew no matter how old he got, he would never grow immune to his father’s words.</p>
<p>            Clenching his jaw to keep his tears in his eyes, Wylan stood up slowly. “Thank you, sir.” And he walked out of the room before his father could see him cry.</p>
<p>            That night, as Wylan lay awake in bed, tucked in by Martha hours ago, tears slipping down his temple, he could sense a strong feeling approaching. <em>Hope. </em>In a few days’ time, he would be out of this blasted house, away from his father and the words that come with him, the words that somehow plagued Wylan whether or not his father was around at all. He would be hundreds of miles away, in a place he could perhaps call home, maybe even find a friend or two. He would find a way to be happy, though he never thought in a million years that happiness was a feeling you had to achieve.</p>
<p>            ************************************************************************</p>
<p>            Diagon Alley was exceptionally busy at this time of year, wizards of all shapes, colors, and sizes bustling about to get last minute supplies for the start of the school year. An autumn wind blew through the streets, adding a breezy serenity to the scene.</p>
<p>            Wylan held a shopping bag with his school uniform and robes in one hand, and his newly wrapped wand in the other. He scurried after his caretaker and butler, Raphael, and tried his best to keep close and simultaneously not fall flat on his face.</p>
<p>            “Come along now, Master Wylan,” Raphael called to the small boy, dodging and weaving flawlessly through traffic.</p>
<p>            Wylan tripped, and a stranger’s elbow slammed directly into his temple.</p>
<p>            “Watch it!” the stranger growled.</p>
<p>            “So sorry, very sorry,” Wylan choked, shaking the red and black dots from clouding his vision.</p>
<p>            “Last stop is Flourish and Blotts, sir,” Raphael told him as they neared the bookstore.</p>
<p>            A nervous feeling fluttered in Wylan’s stomach as he thought of all the books his father would spend money on, and how he wouldn’t be able to comprehend any single one of them.</p>
<p>            Raphael stopped at the entrance of the store and waited patiently for Wylan to catch up and join him. “Before we go in,” he said in a gentle tone, “I need you to know that you mustn’t be scared of these schoolbooks, Master Wylan. There are many alternatives to reading. You’re a bright young man.” He looked down at Wylan and smiled, his kind eyes crinkling at the edges. “You’ll find a way. I know you will.”</p>
<p>            <em>That makes one of us. </em></p>
<p>            **********************************************************************</p>
<p>            One week later, Wylan stood at King’s Cross Station at 10:50am with Raphael by his side. He held half of his luggage in his arms, while his caretaker held the other half, including his brand new screech owl, Stella.</p>
<p>            “Here it is, Master Wylan,” Raphael announced, loading the luggage into a cart. “Platform 9 ¾.”</p>
<p>            Wylan squinted at the brick wall, wondering if he was missing anything. “But there’s nothing here.”</p>
<p>            “It appears so, but the Hogwarts Express is right through there. It’s quite simple really, just walk straight through, and there will be a man to take your luggage to the train and regulate your entry.”</p>
<p>            Wylan’s arms went stiff, and he could feel the nervousness increase to a frenzy in his gut. He swallowed dryly, nearly choking on his effort. Then he felt a heavy hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>            “You can do this, Master Wylan. I believe you can.”</p>
<p>             Before Wylan decided against it, he wrapped his wire-thin arms around Raphael’s waist and squeezed tight. “Thank you,” he whispered.</p>
<p>            Raphael laughed deeply and patted Wylan on the head. “I’ll see you for Christmas, Master Wylan.”</p>
<p>            Wylan took hold of his cart with shaking hands. “I would say I would write, but…”</p>
<p>            Raphael laughed once more, his rosy cheeks easing Wylan’s anxiety for a moment. “You’re a smart boy, Wylan. Do me proud.”</p>
<p>            “I will certainly try.”</p>
<p>            Raphael gave the boy a small salute, and Wylan took a deep breath. He tightened his grip on the handlebars of his cart, closed his eyes, and ran forward at full force into the wall.</p>
<p>            A split second of weightlessness occurred, and when Wylan opened his eyes, he was no longer at King’s Cross Station. Instead of Muggle citizens, dozens of children dressed in the same uniform, scrambling about to get their things in order. The atmosphere was frantic and exciting, and the boy couldn’t help but watch as children his age and older happily boarded the train, all awaiting their future.</p>
<p>             Wylan released a long breath, and was instantly knocked over by a sudden force from behind. His cart toppled, spilling his luggage across the concrete ground.</p>
<p>            “Ah, hell!” he heard someone exclaim, but he was too dazed to see exactly who. He got to his knees and blinked his eyes to stabilize his vertigo.</p>
<p>            “I’m really sorry about that,” said the same voice. This time, Wylan had enough vision to see the boy who had run into him.</p>
<p>            He was tall, brown, and lanky, with dark brown eyes wide with concern, and full lips turned down at the corners. The stranger was standing, and Wylan, after staring for a bit too long (isn’t <em>any </em>kind of staring too long?), noticed he was holding out his hand.</p>
<p>            Wylan clasped it and the stranger brought him to his feet, but didn’t let go of his hand. Instead, he shook it eagerly, and Wylan couldn’t help but enjoy the contrast of his pale skin tone to the boy’s much darker tone.</p>
<p>            “Again, sorry about that,” the boy said, giving Wylan’s hand one last tug. “I’m Jesper, Class A klutz, as you can probably tell.”</p>
<p>               Wylan blinked once and coughed, “Van Eck – I mean, Wylan, sir.” <em>Sir? </em></p>
<p>            Jesper eyed him curiously, and Wylan kicked himself for letting his privileged upbringing show so obviously.</p>
<p>            “Here, let me help you with your luggage there, Wylan.” Jesper knelt and worked quickly to replace Wylan’s cart to its former glory, smiling brilliantly the whole time.</p>
<p>            Wylan stood there, thinking frantically of what he was going to say next, or say at all for that matter. Could this be a new friend? <em>Don’t get ahead of yourself, </em>his father’s voice told him.</p>
<p>            “Stick with me; we can sit together on the train, yeah?” Jesper turned the handlebars of the cart towards the redhead.</p>
<p>            Wylan nearly choked on his words. “Erm – uh – w-well…” He could feel the redness spreading from his cheeks to his neck to his ears.</p>
<p>            Jesper’s eyebrow cocked up. “Unless,” he said slowly, a corner of his mouth turning up, “you have other plans?”</p>
<p>            Wylan finally gave up on speaking completely, and shook his head.</p>
<p>            “Then it’s settled,” Jesper’s teeth flashed bright. “Follow me.”</p>
<p>            And Wylan did. </p>
