    <p>“And then I swerved to the left, but leaned to the right, y’know, a little of this kind of action, and just blew right past the Bludger AND the other Chasers, just right past ‘em—”</p>
<p>“Mm,” Ginny grunted noncommittally, eyes darting around the small balcony she’d managed to get herself trapped on with Mr. I-Could’ve-Been-A-Quidditch-Star, with no chance of escape apparent. The worst part was that it had been entirely her own fault. He’d been so attractive, and she’d had just a few too many glasses of champagne—okay and a shot or four of Firewhiskey she’d talked the bartender into giving her—and she’d been feeling lost and lonely. How was she supposed to know this guy was also a total asshole? It was her first of these stupid Harpies publicity events since The Talk (as it had come to be known in her head); she didn’t usually have to navigate the morass of obnoxious men when she had a war hero on her arm and his ring on her finger. </p>
<p>“Impressive, right?” Pushy was saying, and while he’d been telling his story he’d encroached a few more inches into her personal space. Ginny realized with an internal curse that he’d also somehow managed to back her up against the balcony railing, and now he was placing his hands on either side of her body, leaning forward dangerously close. </p>
<p>“I—uh, sure,” Ginny muttered, inching to one side and hoping he’d get the hint. </p>
<p>“So what do you say to getting out of this stuffy old event and heading back to my place?” </p>
<p>Ginny grimaced, her body tensing. “I don’t know if that’s such a good idea.”</p>
<p>The man in front of her just shot her a lazy grin, one eyebrow raised. “Why not? Surely you’re feeling lonely without Potter… and I have moves off the Quidditch pitch as well.” </p>
<p>Ginny saw red. She was used to pushy men, entitled men, men who wouldn’t take no for an answer—she was a Harpy for Merlin’s sake—but mentioning Harry? It was a low blow. And <em>fuck</em> whoever this guy was, regardless of rich or well-connected he was to be at the fundraiser, she thought, hand going for her wand, when she heard a familiar voice from behind the looming bulk of her wannabe paramour. </p>
<p>“Oh, Sebastian. Look what the c—” Draco Malfoy paused, cool grey eyes flicking over the scene with interest. Ginny’s hand twitched at her wand again, but Malfoy was making his way across the balcony with a determined look on his face, speaking again, and his next words left Ginny completely gobsmacked. </p>
<p>“Gin, love, I’ve been looking for you everywhere.” </p>
<p>Ginny was left entirely speechless as Draco Malfoy made his way over to her, coldly shouldering past the man she assumed was named Sebastian in order to wrap an arm around her waist and pull her against his side before her reflexes, slowed by the alcohol, could jump away from him. He leaned down to brush his lips against her hairline, down to her ear, and whisper so softly it was barely a breath, “Play along. You’re welcome, Weasley.” </p>
<p>Ginny’s hand clenched into a fist behind Malfoy’s back, but the aggressive Sebastian seemed to be shrinking back from Malfoy, head cocked in slight confusion. And, with the slight distraction from her blinding rage that Malfoy’s intervention had provided, Ginny could admit to herself that Gwenog would kill her if she hexed or punched either of the two men at an official Harpies event. Worse, probably bench her for a game. Maybe even two. So Ginny just leaned her head on Malfoy’s shoulder and gave him a vapid smile, eyelashes fluttering. </p>
<p>“And now you’ve found me,” she cooed, leaning up to press her lips to his cheek before skating over to his own ear. “I had it under control, Ferret. Push it and you’ll lose your favorite appendage,” she murmured for his ears only, and the satisfied grin that crept across her face was entirely genuine as she noticed him swallow heavily at her threat. </p>
<p>Pushy, for his part, was staring at the two of them in growing confusion, before he shook his head as if clearing it and narrowed his eyes at the two of them. “Very funny, Malfoy, but the game’s up. Let Ginny and I get back to our conversation.” </p>
<p>“What game?” Malfoy responded innocently, brows raised in the picture of genuine confusion. “Besides, Sebastian, anything you have to say to my—” he choked slightly as Ginny dug her nails threateningly into his lower back—“dearest Ginny, you can say to me.”  </p>
<p>With a roll of his eyes, the stubborn wizard turned his gaze to Ginny. “Oh c’mon. Like I’d actually believe you’re with <em>him</em>. He’s not your type,” Sebastian asserted confidently, not noticing or not acknowledging the danger in Ginny’s sharpening gaze. </p>
<p>“Oh? And you know this because you know me so well?” Ginny said, lips pressed together firmly. Malfoy at least had the sense to recognize the warning signs, likely from being on the receiving end of them a time or five at Hogwarts, and one of his hands slipped down to encircle her wand hand warningly. </p>
<p>“Well, yeah. You’re Ginny Weasley. You don’t do the bad boy thing—you’re the hero’s girl.” </p>
<p>Of course he thought he knew her. Since the war it had been all interviews with the Prophet and spreads in Witch Weekly and questions after games about her love life. Harry hated the spotlight, and most of the time Ginny didn’t mind stepping in and filling some of that gap, but this was what made her blood boil—the sense that everyone had that they knew her. That because they knew she was a Weasley, and Harry was her brother’s best friend, and she’d had a crush on him when she was young, and he’d saved her, and then they’d grown up and they’d dated, that they knew her whole story, the whole bloody fairytale, that they knew <em>her</em>. But the worst part of all of it was that he was right. She didn’t do the bad boy thing, hadn’t even at Hogwarts. The closest she’d gotten was Dean bloody Thomas, because Tom had been enough bad boy for several lifetimes. But she wasn’t the hero’s girl anymore either, because the <em>hero</em>, the quintessential hero, her hero, had needed a break. Ginny wasn’t sure if she was the girl in the Witch Weekly stories and the Prophet articles, but she knew for certain that she hated nothing more than the idea that this stupid pompous arse could understand her at all from those stupid interviews, so she met his gaze with a slow grin that hinted at viciousness. </p>
<p>“Well maybe you don’t know me very well at all, then.” And with that, she turned to Malfoy, slid one hand around the back of his neck, and pressed her lips against his. For a moment he was stiff against her, but then she felt his lips curl into an amused smirk against her own and he tugged her close against him, leaning into her and deepening the kiss. </p>
<p>The first thing she noticed, immense relief flooding through her body, was that it felt nothing like kissing Harry. No painful memories to pang through her chest, no risk of falling into a dangerous fantasy. No—Malfoy was taller than Harry, which meant she had to press up on her toes and lean further into him, changing the angle of the kiss. He smelled like expensive cologne and leather and wood, not like Harry, like sunshine and earth and home. Even better, Malfoy tasted… different. He tasted like champagne and mint, sweet and fresh and brand new. She felt the swipe of his tongue against her bottom lip and a gentle graze of his teeth and she shivered, leaning back to break the kiss with a gasp. </p>
<p>It was at that precise moment when she noticed the flash of a camera and looked up with wild eyes to see an unfamiliar witch grinning wildly as she scampered back into the main event area. Ginny started after her but was stopped by Malfoy’s hand, tight on her hip, and, trying to wrangle her racing pulse, Ginny turned back to Malfoy, ready to shove him away from her, when she noticed that he wasn’t looking at her but at her initial aggressor, who was looking surly but still hadn’t left. </p>
<p>“Answer enough for you, Sebastian? I hope so, because much as you might like the show, I’m not in a generous mood,” Malfoy was drawling, and while the expression on his face was pure indolent smirk, there was a hint of something steely in his eyes that made Sebastian back up, hands in the air. </p>
<p>“Point made, Malfoy. Enjoy your night,” he said stiffly with a nod to Ginny before he exited through the same door as the photographer. </p>
<p>Ginny spun immediately and hit Malfoy in the shoulder with a hard, closed fist, relishing in his shocked grunt and the way his opposite hand rose to rub at it. “Fucking hell,” he muttered under his breath, giving her a glare. “Most people say you’re welcome.” </p>
<p>“I didn’t ask for or need your help, you arrogant arsehole. I was dealing with him on my own.” Ginny crossed her arms, trying to focus her racing mind on her anger at Malfoy and not her endless worries about the mess they’d—<em>he’d</em>—created. </p>
<p>“But my way was so much more fun.” Malfoy was leaning back on the balcony railing, as if he didn’t have a care in the world, as if this had all been some sort of game. Which, given that it was Malfoy, it probably had been. Ginny glowered.</p>
<p>“No, kneeing him in the bollocks so hard his grandchildren felt it would have been more fun.” </p>
<p>Ginny chose to ignore the sudden laughter that escaped before Malfoy managed to stifle it and turn his attention back to her. “Fair point, Weasel. But my way also didn’t involve spending a night at the Ministry for assault and a few games watching your shitty second-string Chaser muck up your plays.” </p>
<p>Malfoy had a point, but the only indication Ginny could give to conceding it was a grunt. “My way wouldn’t have involved a bloody photographer getting a picture of us… ” Ginny ended on a disgusted note, waving her hands wildly, unable to force past her lips the words to describe what precisely had occurred between the them. </p>
<p>“Involved? Together? Locking lips? Snogging? Sitting in a tree k-i-s-s-i-n-g?” Malfoy taunted, the smirk back on his face. </p>
<p>“Yes,” Ginny hissed from between clenched teeth, leaning forward with a clenched fist again, and Malfoy had the sense to put his hands up in mock surrender. </p>
<p>“Who bloody cares, Weasley? The papers will have a field day for a few days, maybe a week, we’ll both decline to comment, and then they’ll move on the newest big thing.” </p>
<p>Ginny sucked in a deep breath through clenched teeth, trying to force herself to hold it together, to see the reason in Malfoy’s words, but there was only one thing hammering through her brain. She groaned, letting her head drop into her waiting palms, and she didn’t realize she’d said his name out loud until she heard Malfoy’s startled cough. </p>
<p>“Scarhead? Seriously? I, together with the rest of Britain, thought that was over.” </p>
<p>“Well, yes, but—” Ginny stopped, not sure what she was even going to say to Draco bloody Malfoy about her and Harry’s relationship, about all of the history and emotion that lay after that ‘but’. </p>
<p>“But what? You and Potter broke up, but you’re waiting for him like some pathetic little girl?” </p>
<p>From the look on his face, Malfoy seemed to be torn between puzzlement and disdain, and Ginny suddenly crossed her arms, shoulders hunching slightly as she tried to avoid the pang of recognizing her own feelings in Malfoy’s. But she wasn’t about to explain to him, couldn’t explain to him, how this was different, how it was one thing to move on when she was a kid with a crush and she needed to prove to Harry and to herself that she was more than her crush on him, and now, when it wasn’t that Harry had been her whole world, but she’d had a life, a complete life, with her own family and friends and career, but one that had a perfect Harry-shaped hole, and she needed him to know that once he’d gotten his chance to live, to explore, that he could slide right back into that spot in her perfect future. </p>
<p>“I mean, he hasn’t exactly had any qualms about being seen out sowing his wild oats,” Malfoy said in that same disdainful drawl, and Ginny felt a flash of rage tear through her, at Malfoy for this stupid situation, for his stupid face and stupid dismissal of her, at Harry for needing a break to find himself outside of the fight against Voldemort, which apparently included finding out what he’d been missing out on when he’d been too busy trying not to die to date, and for herself, for letting herself get jealous when she had no right to be and for letting Malfoy rile her up. The rage manifested itself in the form of a sharp, sudden jab at Malfoy’s gut, and she let herself grin at his groan of pain as he doubled over. </p>
<p>“You bloody fucking harpy,” he growled at her, still hunched. </p>
<p>“Well-spotted, Malfoy.” </p>
<p>“Have it your way, then, you bint. Go tell precious Potter that the big bad Malfoy took advantage of you. I’d have thought you’d have been thrilled to have a chance to kill him with jealousy, especially since he didn’t even notice you the first time around until he realized somebody else might have something he didn’t.” </p>
<p>“Go to hell, you bastard. Harry’s not like th—wait, what do you mean, he didn’t even notice me the first time around until he was jealous?” </p>
<p>Malfoy snorted, finally standing up, though he kept his arms in front of him in a defensive position. “Merlin’s tits, do you have to have your head entirely up your are where Potter is concerned to even get into Gryffindor, or is it something that comes afterward?” Ginny’s hands clenched into fists again and Malfoy shrank back. “Potter knew you had a crush on him. You were his best friend’s little sister, the only girl in your family. I’m sure your family had your wedding china picked out from Day 1. It wasn’t until you were dating… ah, I bloody can’t remember, some boy who wasn’t Potter, that he started to notice you, and glare daggers at whatshisname all class period.” At this, Malfoy’s smirk returned. “He may have saved the world, but Potter’s still a caveman at heart.” </p>
<p>Ginny stilled, thinking about Malfoy’s words. Harry <em>had</em> only started noticing her after she’d begun dating. A little when she dated Michael, but more when she’d dated Dean. She’d thought she’d finally started growing into her looks, helped by a generous growth spurt around that time, but maybe it was just that Dean was a Gryffindor too, in Harry’s year, and they’d been in front of him all the time, for him to notice that she was a girl that people found desirable and he’d have to pull himself together and go after her if he wanted her. </p>
<p>“And you’re saying I should be trying to make Harry jealous now?” </p>
<p>Malfoy grimaced, looking like he’d just swallowed a pint of Skele-Gro. “Should is a strong word, Weasel. While the thought of you popping out tiny Potters at the rate your family breeds is enough to make me shudder, I wouldn’t mind being able to read my morning Prophet without having to wade through at least a page of musings on Potter’s latest dating escapades.”  </p>
<p>Ginny paused, her eyes narrowing as she watched Malfoy intently, mind whirring. “So you’ll help me then?” </p>
<p>“Help you what?” Malfoy said, staring at her as if they’d jumped conversation topics entirely and he wasn’t sure what they were talking about any longer.</p>
<p>“You’ll help me make Harry jealous.” </p>
<p>Malfoy was choking—on what, she had no idea, since he hadn’t had any food or drink, but he was coughing furiously, eyes watering as she pounded on his chest before he shoved her away. “You’ll leave bruises, you bint. And what in Merlin’s name gave you the idea I’d help you make Scarhead jealous?” </p>
<p>Ginny stepped back, keeping her eyes fixed on him with a determined gleam. It was a crazy plan, but now that she’d thought about it, with the advantage of all of that Firewhiskey and champagne swirling through her veins, opening her mind, it was actually brilliant. Harry had been avoiding her ever since The Talk, answering her owls with vague platitudes about how he’d been and keeping her relatives around as a buffer between them at the Burrow, the better for him to ‘get space’. Well—this would get his attention. And make him realize that he wasn’t the only one who could do a little exploring and finding themselves on this break. And, well… </p>
<p>“I thought you wanted to stop reading about Harry’s latest date in the Prophet every day. We’re agreed there. And when have you ever passed up a chance to get under Harry’s skin?” She felt a loose, impulsive grin grow on her face, already feeling a little bit lightheaded at the idea. It was absolutely bloody insane, but—when was the last time she’d done something absolutely insane? She felt a cool breeze stir and could’ve sworn she heard faint laughter—maybe it was Fred’s ghost, because only with supernatural twin assistance could she have come up with something this completely crazy. </p>
<p>Malfoy was looking at her oddly, but he did give her an appreciative grin at her last comment. “I would pay 100 Galleons just to see the look on Scarhead’s stupid face when he sees the picture from tonight.”</p>
<p>“So you’ll do it.” It wasn’t a question. </p>
<p>“What does ‘it’ entail?” Malfoy asked, ever the cautious, plotting Slytherin. </p>
<p>“Just… pretend to date me. You won’t have to actually touch me—ugh, I think I just retched in my mouth a little thinking about it—except for some cursory touching for the cameras in public. I—I don’t know for how long—” </p>
<p>“Potter will be on his knees begging for you in two months, tops.” Malfoy was smirking at her, amusement dancing in his grey eyes. “He hates losing, especially to me.”</p>
<p>Ginny frowned at that. “Harry’s never lost anything to you before,” she shot back with a dismissive glare, but the corners of Malfoy’s mouth were turning up in a wicked grin.</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>As his words sunk in, Ginny laughed, at the wild, idiotic perfection of it all. </p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’ll work though. I mean, would anyone believe that we’re dating? Us? It’s impossible,” Malfoy said, brows furrowed as he stared at the stone in front of him. But he was thinking of logistics now, of how to make it work, and not whether to go through with it, which she knew from a lifetime spent getting wrapped up in Fred and George’s schemes meant she had him hooked. </p>
<p>“Anything’s possible if you’ve got enough nerve, Malfoy,” she said, leaning forward with her own wicked grin. </p>
<p>He stilled, just watching her carefully for a few moments, before he sighed and nodded. “I’m in, Weasley. Only for the spectacular meltdown Potter will have, which I can only hope will happen in public. Now,” he said, pressing his palms together like he was beginning a lecture, “we’ll need to come up with a full plan. Not here, though—we’ve already been talking too publicly, and we’re lucky no one else has come out here. Somewhere private.” </p>
<p>“You don’t get to know where I live,” Ginny said suddenly, tensing at the thought of Draco Malfoy knowing where she slept. “And I’m not going to Malfoy Manor.” </p>
<p>“Fine,” Malfoy said with an exasperated sigh. “I have a flat in London. The kind with neighbors,” he continued on a grimace, while Ginny was mentally replacing the word ‘neighbors’ with ‘witnesses’, “Think you can survive setting foot there?” </p>
<p>“Sure,” Ginny said, relaxing slightly, surprised at his compromise. </p>
<p>“Come by early tomorrow morning. By Floo. And bring those clothes. You can leave through the front door and make it look like you went home with me tonight.”</p>
<p>Ginny opened her mouth to protest, but found herself shutting it a few moments later. It was actually a solid plan, so far as fake dating plans went. And the best part about it was that she didn’t <em>actually</em> have to go home with Malfoy. </p>
<p>“Tomorrow morning then,” she said, taking the card with his address on it that he’d taken out of his robes and offered to her. </p>
<p>“Tomorrow morning,” he said with a grin, and turned to walk back into the main room. </p>
<p>Right before he reached the door, Ginny called out. “Hey Malfoy, wait!” </p>
<p>He paused dutifully, turning around with an arched brow. </p>
<p>“I—uh… Why did you step in? With Sergio?” </p>
<p>“Sergio… do you mean Sebastian?” Malfoy asked, a glint of humor in his grey eyes.</p>
<p>“Sure—Sebastian, Sergio, Scourgify, whatever.”</p>
<p>A corner of Malfoy’s mouth twitched upward. “You don’t believe that I could just be a gentleman who wouldn’t dare to let a lady in need go without rescuing?” </p>
<p>Ginny snorted in an extraordinarily unladylike manner, grinning at the slight wince Malfoy gave. “You’re not a gentleman and I’ll eat my broom if you think I’m a lady.” </p>
<p>“Much as I’d like to see you try… Fine. Sebastian stole my date to the Malfoy New Years’ Ball fourth year.”  He looked like the cat who’d eaten the canary at getting his petty revenge, six long years later, and Ginny laughed uproariously at that. </p>
<p>“Revenge is a dish best served cold,” she said at last, and he shot her a grin over his shoulder as he left the balcony, with her close behind a few seconds later. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening passed in a blur. Instead of having to fight off memories of attending with Harry, Ginny found her thoughts preoccupied with planning, anticipation of the look on Harry’s face, overblown scenarios in which Harry showed up on her doorstep, literally on his knees, begging her to take him back. She felt better than she had since The Talk—it felt good to have a plan, to take action. She remembered to shoot glances Malfoy’s direction periodically, giving him her best coyly lowered lashes and smoldering stares, and feeling his eyes on her in return. When she finally left, she thought she might not even need to break out any wine and ice cream—she was too focused on what the morning would bring.</p>
