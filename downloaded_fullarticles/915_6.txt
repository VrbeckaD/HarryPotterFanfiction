    <p class="p1">The armchair at Harry’s side was feeling far too much like home, Hermione thought. It had gradually, over the last six weeks, become accustomed to her precise way of sitting, the way she tended to hold a book open on one arm, and as a result it looked very strange when she wasn’t sitting in it. And it wasn’t comfortable for anyone else, either. In fact, it had developed such a high opinion of itself that Hermione had heard more than one person confide that they thought it had kicked them, right in the seat of their pants, when they attempted to requisition it for a short visit.</p><p class="p1">She watched the even rise and fall of Harry’s chest, and returned her attention to the book open on her lap. Research, of course. The book was propped on the arm of the chair because it was heavy enough to be causing discomfort. Hermione glanced at the clock and asked herself how long she could realistically keep taking in any kind of information. She raised her wand, and tapped her watch. It opened out a schedule for the next two days. She had a briefing with… oh, and the Department of…</p><p class="p1">Where on earth was that Healer?</p><p class="p1">The moment she saw the woman enter the room, Hermione stood up, slipping a bookmark between the heavy vellum pages and setting the tome on the side table.</p><p class="p1">“Minister Granger,” the Healer said.</p><p class="p1">“Healer Thistlewish. Do you have news?”</p><p class="p1">The Healer crossed the room to Harry’s bedside, cast a couple of quick diagnostic spells that Hermione was coming to recognise instantly (Harry’s stasis was holding, for now; his vitals were normal. He was just… asleep).</p><p class="p1">“I’ve spoken to Professor Piedamonte at the <span class="s1"><em>Ospedale degli Incurabili</em> in Naples. He has a candidate. <em>The</em> candidate, really, I should —”</span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione bristled at the name of the hospital, and reminded herself not that it had been named in the 16</span>
  <span class="s2">
    <sup>th</sup>
  </span>
  <span class="s1"> century, long before modern Magical medicine. Or, for that matter, the Muggle equivalent.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He’s considered an expert on sleep disorders. I’ve read his work. He studied in Rome, and began as a Healer in the largest hospital in the city — which is to say, of course, nothing like the size of St. Mungo’s, but significant nonetheless. He followed a calling, they say, into psychiatry, where he developed many new treatment protocols, combining his mastery in potions-making with what I’m told is a remarkably empathetic approach to talk therapies.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sounds promising,” Hermione said. “Which leads me to wonder why this is the first time I’m hearing about him.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not done. His research and clinical interest in sleep disorders began much later. He’s only been working in the area for five years.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione turned to the bed, again. Harry didn’t offer up an opinion. He only breathed, and slept, and Hermione could only hope what she’d been hoping for the last six weeks: that he was sleeping softly and gently, comfortably, and that the nightmares that had plagued him for most of his life were banished. But she couldn’t know.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So — brilliant psychiatrist, brilliant potions-maker, highly empathetic, and deeply involved with sleep disorder research, and the downside is that he’s only been working in this specific, <em>minute</em> area of specialty for five years?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And the fact that he is in Italy, Minister.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I think you’re not telling me something.” Hermione narrowed her eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Healer Thistlewish moved closer to the edge of the bed, and slipped her fingers around Harry’s wrist. Not as accurate as her diagnostic spells for taking a pulse but Hermione understood all too well the need to feel, physically, what the spells could only infer. “Did I tell you — my husband. He fought at the battle of Hogwarts.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No,” Hermione said. She wanted to ask why this was relevant, but had long since learned to let people speak, when they needed to be heard. <em>Politics</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He arrived as part of the mobile Healing corps, but they fought for almost three hours before they were able to start helping. Harry — Auror Potter,” she corrected, flushing slightly, “he brought dozens of children out to the medi-tents. Didn’t matter who they were. The children of Death Eaters, alongside their classmates. Adults who were cursing his name even as the Dark Marks burned on their arms. A Goblin. Harry was beyond tired. Beyond exhausted. At the limits of his capacity… I heard later that he had actually died. Or at least that he had once again survived AK.” She paused for a long beat. “And he was still fighting. We’ve asked too much of him, Minister Granger.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione ignored the twist of guilt in her stomach. Healer Thistlewish went on.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He’s a good man. And he’s done so much good since. I hate to see him like this. He deserves more.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione sighed deeply. “Yes.” Yes to all of it. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“If this doesn’t work — if this Healer can’t help — then I’m afraid all hope is lost. And I can’t bear it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione felt her eyes burn.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Healer Thistlewish passed her a scrap of parchment with the time and location of the meeting. Hermione nodded. She lifted the book she had been reading to tuck under her arm, and leaned to kiss Harry’s cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sleep well, Harry,” she murmured. “I’ll see you tomorrow.” And then, to Healer Thistlewish, “May I make use of your Floo?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Please do, Minister,” she said, bowing deeply.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione stepped out into the Weasley’s living quarters, upstairs from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, only a few minutes later, brushing ash from her robes. She and Ron shared a tight embrace and she thanked the gods once more that the breakup all of those years ago had been amicable. Gabrielle Delacour… no, <em>Weasley</em>, swept majestically across the room and kissed her on both cheeks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I keep hoping you’ll come through the Floo with a huge smile on your face,” Ron admitted. “So there’s nothing?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione shook her head, and dropped onto the couch, very un-Minister-like.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“One more expert. I can’t bring myself to get my hopes up. But it’s far too soon to lose hope.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“D’you…” Ron said, reaching for Hermione’s hand, while Gabrielle fetched the Firewhiskey — bless that woman, she really knew how to read a room — “D’you think he’s resting, at least?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course, Ron,” she lied, squeezing his hand once and then reaching for the glass Gabrielle brought. Their fingers brushed. Hermione felt a flush of desire, but after so many years, she knew how to ignore it. Repeated and regular exposure to a couple of stunning half-Veelas had done wonders for her ability to resist influence. “His heart rate and blood pressure are steady. He doesn’t toss and turn, or call out. He’s asleep. That’s all. He’s unlikely to be dreaming much at all, or we’d see…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She flushed, bringing the glass to her lips. That was not a conversation she was willing to have, but by the way Ron’s expression shifted from worried, to curious, and then to mortified, she decided that he had to be getting there on his own.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So the day after tomorrow, I leave for Italy. I’ll let you know what happens. I may be out of touch for a few days, and you know we have to keep behaving as though you know nothing about what is going on — but I’ll tell you what I can, when I can. In the meantime, keep up what you’ve been doing, will you?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“‘Course, ‘Mione,” Ron said, taking her empty glass. His expression was clear. He was more than happy to pretend that he knew nothing; knowing things was hard, for Ron, these days. “Sleep tight, Minister.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I hate it when you call me that,” she said, with a small smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s why I do it.” Ron grinned, and winked, and draped his arm over his wife’s shoulders. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Take care, ‘Ermione,” Gabrielle said. “Tell ‘Arry we miss him.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I do so every day,” Hermione said, offering Gabrielle one last smile before she stepped into the Floo again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Warmer than I expected,” Hermione said, as she stepped from the gazebo that was the apparition point. The Unspeakable walking beside her was dressed from head to toe in black, with a hood covering his face, but she knew the brush of his magic. On the other side was Auror Patil, one of the very few who knew of Harry’s condition, there as protection. Parvati said nothing; she was too focused on the possibility of any threat to pay much attention to pleasantries.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, Parvati,” Hermione said. “I’m not aware of a conspiracy against the British Government with a headquarters in Naples, are you?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You should have let me bring a proper guard, Hermione,” Parvati snapped. “I don’t like this at all.” She followed Hermione across the paved garden to the door of the hospital. Not the front entry, bustling with visitors and staff; the entry to the office area in the psychiatric wing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’ve made it known repeatedly,” Hermione answered, and turned as the man beside her raised his hand to test for hostile wards, or anything else of danger.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione could have done it herself, of course. But not without revealing her own status as a former Unspeakable. These were delicate lines and not to be crossed. She did, however, watch with interest as she noted the flare in the wards that suggested she had been made welcome in advance, though her cheer waned at the presence of an elf at the door when it opened at last. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No,” Parvati said sternly. “If you dare give that elf anything but your cloak, we’ll be tossed off the continent, and there’s… <em>himself</em> sleeping until he expires. You don’t <em>know</em>, Minister.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Rubino will to be taking your cloaks,” the elf promised, with a low bow and a thick Neapolitan accent. He did so, and with a flick of his wrist, sent them flying into a closet discreetly situated in the foyer. “Rubino takes you to Master’s Professor’s Office, now,” he said, and the trio followed him through the ancient corridors.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Professor Piedamonte turned out to be a more effusive man than Hermione had expected, tossing compliments like confetti and welcoming them to the country, to the city, his hospital, his office. He spoke with his hands as much as his words, and Hermione found herself warming to him. The head of the Janus Thickey Ward at St. Mungo’s had never seemed this pleasant. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“As much as I do appreciate your hospitality,” Hermione said, as she accepted a cup of tea from Rubino, “I had hoped we might be able to meet your…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“My <em>colleague</em>, sì. Well, I am the head of his Department, but he is better than me — so <em>colleague</em> is a term that is kindest to both of us.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Better than the head of the department?” Hermione asked, with her eyebrows arched. “Then why isn’t he doing your job?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He has no interest in bureaucracy,” the Professor said, and murmured something in Italian to Rubino, who disapparated with a <em>crack</em>. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Several long minutes later, Rubino opened the door in the regular way, and led the mysterious Healer into the room. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was younger than she had imagined — probably around her own age, perhaps a few years older. Tall and strong, and very good-looking, with dark blond hair that curled mischievously over his ears and was otherwise tied with a strip of leather at the base of his skull. He didn’t wear the long, grey Healers’ robes that she was accustomed to, but a soft, dusty blue cashmere sweater over very nicely fitting grey trousers. His eyes were a remarkable shade of blue, his features patrician.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If Hermione had not worked her way up from the Auror Office to the Department of Mysteries before becoming the Minister of Magic at the grand old age of thirty-seven, she might have missed the momentary widening of his eyes, the surprise which was gone as quickly as it had come. She felt a brush of magic that said her Unspeakable escort had seen it as well, but he didn’t so much as curl a toe in acknowledgement.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“May I present <em>Guaritore</em> Christopher Black?” Professor Piedamonte said, as the man stepped into the room. “<em>Guaritore</em> Black,” he said. “May I present to you Minister Hermione Granger, Minister for Magic in Great Britain.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione stepped forward to shake the Healer’s hand, and he nodded seriously. “A pleasure to meet you, Minister,” he said, expression neutral. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The pleasure is all mine, I assure you,” she said. “Black. Any relation to the London Blacks?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Almost certainly,” the Healer said, formally. “We are to Europe as ants are to a picnic, I’m afraid.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Your accent —”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I grew up in England. I’ve been here many years. Won’t you take a seat, and tell me what this is all about? I have patients,” he reminded them, not unkindly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione handed over the thick file she’d tucked into one of the expanding pockets in her robes. She was very rarely caught without something she needed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We have an Auror affected by a sleep condition. He hasn’t woken in six weeks. We would like you to come and assess him, please. I understand you do work in a consultative role, from time to time.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I do. Here, in my own hospital.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We can’t move him.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s fine. I’ll look over the case, put together some thoughts for you. There are accommodations for visiting scholars here in the hospital — I’ll give you my findings in the morning, and I’d be happy to make arrangements to discuss the case with your Healers by Floo-call, or owl, as required.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione blinked rapidly, trying to parse the gentle brush-off. “Healer Black,” Hermione said. “Am I to take it that you are refusing to assess our Auror?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I am telling you that I am unable to set foot on British soil.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I am the Minister of Magic, and if there is some kind of a problem…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s not as simple as that,” Healer Black said, his expression hard, but no less attractive for all of that. “And I don’t think our time would be best served discussing it. Would you like to take the notes with you, and leave, or would you like me to look over them?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There was something rather familiar about his body language, and the way he spoke. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione sighed. “Please, take them. Will you send for us in the morning?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I will, Minister,” Healer Black said. He bowed to Hermione, nodded to Professor Piedamonte and turned to sweep out the door.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The accommodation was beautifully appointed, not that Hermione was surprised. She looked out over the grounds of the hospital — there was another, close by, distinctly Muggle, and she wondered if anyone there knew that this much older part of the hospital was still bustling with Healers and patients, and not the ruin she assumed they saw when they glanced across the grounds.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’ll check over your quarters,” Parvati said. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thank you,” Hermione said absently. “I’m sure everything is fine. You know I’m still entirely qualified for field work.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“If you’re not going to listen to what I say, why do you bring me to these things?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m sorry, Auror Patil,” Hermione said, with an apologetic wave. “Please, be my guest.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Parvati was satisfied that the rooms were safe, she locked the door behind her and took up her place in the corridor. Miserable work — Hermione had long since lost count of the number of hours she had spent in silent watch outside a room where one dignitary or another sat doing goodness-knew-what — but Parvati never complained. Hermione slipped her robe off her shoulders and tossed it in the general direction of the bed. It was caught in mid-air, and Hermione startled, until the shape of a tall figure in a long black cloak resolved in the air in front of her, and took the robe to hang in the closet.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I thought you must have left,” she complained softly. No one, of course, had noticed him, not in the meeting, not sneaking around to do whatever came next, certainly not in the private chambers of the Minister for Magic herself. “Blaise?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He slipped the hood over his head, but didn’t look at Hermione. Having been lovers for over fifteen years, and partners even longer, there was very little that Blaise could get by Hermione. “What is it?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“This might not be a good idea, love,” he said, and angled his face down for a kiss. Supposed to be a token, a <em>hello</em>, but that never worked with them, never had. Another moment and they were pressed together from chest to knee, Hermione’s mouth opening softly beneath Blaise’s. He tangled his fingers in her curls a moment, and they crossed the room without the need to speak, sitting together on the settee. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Did you notice anything? Something strange? About our new friend Healer Black?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>Guaritore</em>,” Hermione corrected absently. “He seemed — familiar. Do you know him? Only I wondered if he might have been at Hogwarts with us. Perhaps in an upper grade.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hermione,” Blaise said, inching closer, taking Hermione’s hands in his own, resting on the knee of her dress. He never could keep his hands off her for very long, and every touch made Hermione warm to the core. “Guaritore Black is <em>Draco Malfoy</em>.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco sat alone in his office, the fire roaring, his Glamour absent for now. He never bothered with it when he was alone. It was a drain on his magic, if only a small one. His hair was his own, and he found he always had time to turn away for the moment it took to return the disguise, should someone creep up on him. He held a cup of tea in his left hand, and was yet to notice that it had gone cold.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He could go to Switzerland, perhaps. Or somewhere further north; he could change his identity again and show up in a hospital in Reykjavik or something. Or perhaps Australia? So much space, so few people. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He sipped the tea, and made a face, and cast a warming spell over it. He drained the cup for the simple reason that he needed a little caffeine, and he rubbed his eyes. He’d gotten greedy, that was all. Shouldn’t have fallen into the publicity trap. How embarrassingly Gryffindor of him. What had happened to self-preservation?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He could at least have kept his name off those papers. He could have got the results out to the medical community without needing his name attached. He still would have been doing good work, just…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Oh, Merlin’s <em>bollocks</em>. Merlin’s eminently saggy bollocks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And what was Hermione sodding Granger thinking? Identity redacted, his pale arse. Taking the name and birth date off a patient’s file wasn’t redacting their identity by any stretch of the imagination, not when that patient was as singular as Harry tossing Potter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Oh, Draco was terribly out of practice with name-calling. Funny how a handful of hours alone with a medical file, being reminded of the past, and ignoring the creeping certainty that the tension headache he had been nursing for several days now was about to make his entire skull implode… explode? Whatever. Draco was angry, upset, tired, and his head hurt, and he felt more than anything else truly terrible for the man described in these pages. He didn’t want to, but he did. Harry was rich, famous, and influential, everything Draco had ever wanted to be. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And he was so fucking miserable that he had wished himself into a magical coma.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was difficult reconciling the desire to help with a lifetime of envy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco’s dinner was cold as his tea. He Vanished it with a flick of his wrist. He wasn’t hungry anyway.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Rubino,” he called, and the elf apparated by Draco’s hearth. “Would you please contact our distinguished guest and ask her if she would be willing to join me for a nightcap? Say, in an hour? I would prefer to speak to her alone, if she is willing, though if her… <em>entourage</em> needs to join us, I shan’t fuss.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Rubino slanted his head in a very distinguished manner, and disappeared again. Italian elves really did have an edge.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco wasn’t surprised when there was a knock on the door <em>precisely</em> one hour later. Nor was he surprised that Patil was there acting as bodyguard. Who might be planning to attack the British Minister for Magic in a psychiatric hospital in Italy, Draco didn’t know, but Patil looked up to the job of protecting her well enough. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thank you, Auror Patil,” Hermione said, stepping into Draco’s rooms as Parvati closed the door, stepping in front of it. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thank you for joining me, Minister,” Draco said.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thank you for the invitation. Could I ask you to cast a silencing spell, Guaritore Black?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Certainly.” He cast a non-verbal, wandless Muffliato and waved Granger to the settee, while he poured two glasses of an especially fine Tuscan wine, and brought them to the small coffee table in front of Granger. She nodded her thanks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And have you looked over the file?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I have. I do have some ideas about reaching your Auror, and I can recommend several colleagues to assist you.” Draco sat in the armchair opposite, crossing his knees elegantly. “I myself won’t be able to —”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Colleagues,” Granger said, disbelieving.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes. Very skilled.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“As skilled as you?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco felt his jaw stiffen, and Hermione got to her feet. “As skilled as <em>you</em>?” she asked again, and Draco met her eyes coolly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“There is more to this than the simple application of skill,” he said. “There are many considerations that I would not expect you to —”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Help! Parvati?” Granger called loudly; for a moment, Draco was alarmed, but there was no reply. “Good. Strong spell. That,” Granger said, pointing emphatically at the pile of papers on Draco’s table, “Is <em>Harry Potter</em>, you numbskull. Without whom most of us would be dead. Including you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco felt his skin prickle.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, he is quite famous. I had wondered. Still. I am not the right Healer for this job.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Because you can’t set foot on British soil? No such order exists.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t need to explain —”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t be a wanker, Draco,” came a second voice, and Draco flinched, reaching for his wand as he whirled around to see who was behind him. He hardly expected to find Blaise Zabini helping himself to a glass of wine. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Zabini?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Malfoy,” Zabini replied. “Sorry. Wouldn’t usually have dobbed you in like that, but it’s been twenty years since I laid eyes on you, and all.” He sipped the wine. Draco turned back to Granger, who looked for the most part like she was very annoyed at Blaise for having revealed both his identity and his job in one fell swoop but also quite exasperated and fond, in a troubling way.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well, Granger, since we’re dispensing with the formalities,” Draco said, dropping the Glamour again. Something about seeing the two of them here together in his sanctuary made Draco feel a prickle of pettiness rise up in his gullet. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He wanted to say something cruel. But he hadn’t been that man for a very, very long time, and it didn’t matter how badly his head hurt, he refused to be that man again now. He looked from Blaise to Granger and back again, noting how close Blaise sat. Very informal for a bodyguard. Or whatever.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Not his business. He took a deep breath.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I cannot be away from the hospital for that length of time, for a start,” he said, trying to sound a little kinder. “I have other patients. The sort of treatment we’re talking about would almost certainly require us to spend a great deal of time together, a few hours a day to begin with.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“But —”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco shook his head. “I know. You already have five different solutions to that problem. But it’s minor in comparison to the next one.” He waved his wand in the direction of a thick folder of notes on the desk, and sent it into Granger’s lap, opening to the relevant page. He crossed his hands over his knee to wait.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There was quite some waiting to do. Draco closed his eyes, slipping into the meditative state that helped to refresh him and enable him the mental space required to do his work. Not asleep. Entirely aware of what was going on in the room, the turning of the pages and the quiet sniff Hermione let out from time to time. Blaise’s hand on her back, fingertips moving almost silently over the woven wool of her robe.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At last, he heard them both shift against the upholstery and opened his eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s only step one. And highly invasive, as you can see.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes. I see.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“There are other steps after that one. Now, a test of ethics, and a test of friendship,” he said, coolly. Granger met his eyes. She looked tired. She looked defiant, though, and she looked… well, there was grief in there as well. Draco couldn’t help with that, under the current circumstances. He could refer her, though. “And be honest, Minister. With yourself. With Auror Potter, and with me. If you don’t think you can…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I suggest you bite your tongue,” Granger said. Good, more defiant than weary.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I shall take that under consideration,” Draco said, and he may have smiled a little. “Over a period of… weeks, at a minimum, months more likely —</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It would be weeks. Harry is strong.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, <em>very</em> strong. Which suggests to me that it would be more like months. If he has built a wall in his mind that he doesn’t wish to be disturbed, he will have built it to be very strong indeed. Over that period, I spend a few hours a day in his mind, mapping it all out — every fear, every memory, good and bad. The first time he touched his wand at Gringott’s and knew what magic really meant, and the first time he made a feather float. Watching Dumbledore fall from the Astronomy tower. Walking into the forest to die at the hands of Tom Riddle.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I see, but —”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You don’t, not yet. Those are the things that are real, Minister. What about the rest of it? Everything he has every wanted for himself. Every crushed hope. Every sexual fantasy.” That was intended to make Granger flinch, and it worked. “I map all of that out, and I find where he is hiding. And then why. I dismantle the walls in his mind. And then I drag him out. And don’t make the mistake of assuming he’s in there waiting to be rescued, Minister. One look at me, and the knowledge that I, <em>Draco Malfoy</em>, can see what’s in that fucked-up head of his and he might disappear completely.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She held his gaze, determined, but her eyes were bright with tears. Hermione Granger was about as good at keeping a poker face up as Draco was himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“If he was a perfect stranger, the ethics would be… complicated,” he said. “I’ve done it, of course. Afterwards, the patient need never see me again and all’s well that ends well, if we’re lucky. But for Potter, having me in his mind would be the most appalling breach of his privacy; it would be a kind of violence. Even if he didn’t close his mind down completely to get rid of me, the chances are good that he’d never speak to you again. Perhaps it’s worth the risk to you, but would it be worth the risk to him?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Granger’s eyes shone, and she swallowed hard. Blaise squeezed her shoulder.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He’s hated me since we were children, Minister Granger. Who is the worst person you could possibly imagine poking around in <em>your</em> head? Aunt Bella, perhaps. How would you feel, if someone sent her into <em>your</em> head?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We’re not children anymore. Nobody hates you, Malfoy.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And he’s said that to you, has he? Over a glass of wine the the Three Broomsticks? ‘Gosh, I don’t hate Malfoy anymore, isn’t that the thing’? If you want me to do this — if you ask me to do this — that’s the risk you’re taking.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Granger sat silently for a long time.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Is there any other way?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Perhaps. But you’d need to ask someone else about them, and I assume your Healers have already tried. I can help someone to understand their dreams and their nightmares, and get free of them. That’s what I can do. And under the circumstances, I think it’s only right that you should consider me the absolute last resort.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The room was silent for two minutes, perhaps three, and Draco had to avert his eyes so he didn’t have to watch Granger and Blaise doing whatever psychic communication that was. How bizarre.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thank you for your time, <em>Guaritore</em> Black,” Granger said as she climbed unsteadily to her feet. “I need to give careful consideration to this information. What time shall we call tomorrow?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Eleven,” Draco said. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Eleven, then.” Draco felt an odd pressure in his head, and then Granger seemed to be alone again. “We know your secret, <em>Guaritore</em> Black. And you know ours. I trust that won’t be a problem.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No, Minister,” Draco said, settling his Glamour over his face once again. He stood as well. “I have no interest in breaking any kind of confidence. I’ll see you tomorrow.”</span>
