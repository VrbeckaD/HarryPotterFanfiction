<p>The Big Interview</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy’s there when Harry gets home. “Potter.” </p>
<p>“Malfoy,” replies Harry politely. </p>
<p>Severus rolls his eyes. “Don’t strain yourselves, gentlemen.” </p>
<p>“Sorry,” Harry says. “Long day. Staying for tea, Malfoy?” </p>
<p>Malfoy looks surprised. “No, thank you. Neville’s expecting me.” </p>
<p>“What’s Neville see in him?” Harry mutters once he’s gone.</p>
<p>“Apparently the father of his children.” </p>
<p>Harry blinks. “Whoa! <i>That’s</i> what you’re working on for them? A pregnancy potion?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Severus hums. “It’s been done, the technique’s been lost.” </p>
<p>“Well, if anyone can figure it out, it’s you.” Harry grins. “When you succeed, you should give a big press interview.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Severus is quiet one night when Harry gets home the following week. </p>
<p>Harry waits, and when they climb into bed, Severus finally clears his throat. Harry smiles. “Everything okay?” </p>
<p>Severus exhales. “I’ve made a breakthrough in my potion.” He appears inexplicably nervous. </p>
<p>“Brilliant!” Harry frowns. “So what’s wrong?” </p>
<p>“It seems my potion’s a bit too…potent.” </p>
<p>“Meaning?” </p>
<p>“I’m pregnant.” </p>
<p>Harry gapes at him. “We’re having a baby?!” </p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“But how?” </p>
<p>Severus raises an eyebrow.</p>
<p>Harry sighs. “Not <i>how</i>. Just…how?” </p>
<p>“It seems just inhaling the fumes made me…susceptible.” </p>
<p>Harry sputters. “That’s amazing!” </p>
<p>Severus relaxes.</p>
<p>“We should give an interview!” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“This is a terrible idea.” </p>
<p>Smiling fondly, Harry leads Severus towards the seating area. “It could be worse.” </p>
<p>Scowling, Severus sits. “How? I’m being browbeaten into giving an interview.” He clears his throat. “In case you weren’t aware, I’m a…private person.” </p>
<p>Leaning down, Harry kisses his cheek and whispers, “I’m aware. Hey, at least we’re on the wireless and not telly.” </p>
<p>By the time Harry’s seated, and their interviewer arrives, Severus’ blushes have cooled. </p>
<p>“Messrs Potter and Snape,” says Skeeter. “How exciting! Shall we start?” </p>
<p>“If we must,” mutters Severus. </p>
<p>Harry coughs. “Sure.” </p>
<p>“Lovely. How’s married life?”</p>
<p>Severus huffs. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“…between Severus’ potion business and me being an Auror, we’re busy,” finishes Harry.</p>
<p>Skeeter’s eyes narrow. “Bringing us to your future endeavours. Any plans for children?” </p>
<p>Practically hearing Severus grinding his teeth, Harry jumps in quickly. “We’ve discussed it, yes,” he says, “there are so many war orphans—” </p>
<p>“Of course, but I meant <i>natural</i> children.” Skeeter eyes Severus’ waist. “Mr Snape’s potions prowess is renowned. In fact, there’s a rumour you’ve already created a male pregnancy potion—”</p>
<p>“No comment!” snarls Severus.</p>
<p>“It would be quite a legacy,” Skeeter continues, smirking. “Especially given your…tragic childhoods.” </p>
<p>“Right,” snaps Severus. “Interview over!”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“How did she know?” Severus frets, pacing back and forth. </p>
<p>“She may not,” says Harry. “You know how she is. She loves to push people’s buttons.” </p>
<p>“I’ve something she can push,” Severus snarls, tone dark.</p>
<p>Harry sighs. “Shouldn’t you sit down, rest?” </p>
<p>Severus shoots an irritated look at him. “Don’t start. I’m pregnant, not sick!” he snaps. “And I knew giving Skeeter an interview would backfire!” </p>
<p>Walking over to Severus, Harry embraces him. “I’m sorry,” he whispers. “I thought it would be a good way to show off your potions prowess. After all, you’re the first pregnant wizard in centuries.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Absolutely not!” </p>
<p>Harry holds up his hand. “Hear me out. This won’t be like the last debacle.” </p>
<p>“I hate the press,” says Severus. Absently, he rubs his obviously swollen belly. “No more interviews!” </p>
<p>“But the word’s out. We may as well put our spin on it before Skeeter writes a book or something.” When Severus doesn’t immediately say no, he continues, “Plus, it’s Luna. You know she’ll be fair.” </p>
<p>Severus huffs. “One more chance,” he finally says. “But if she asks any impertinent questions, I will not be held responsible for my actions!” </p>
<p>“Understandable. Now, how about a foot massage?” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Hello, Harry! Hello, Severus.” </p>
<p>Gesturing Luna in, Harry says, “Hey, Luna. Thanks for coming.” </p>
<p>“Oh, it was no trouble.” Luna looks Severus over, tilting her head. “You look positively blooming!” </p>
<p>Severus blinks. “Thank you. We…appreciate you being willing to come here for the interview.” </p>
<p>“Of course! I’m happy to.” Settling into her chair, Luna pulls out a quill and some parchment. “Now, shall we begin?” </p>
<p>Harry sits beside Severus on the sofa, clasping his hand. “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“I understand you’re expecting,” says Luna. “Have you picked names yet?”</p>
<p>Feeing Severus relax as Luna gently draws him out, Harry smiles.</p>
