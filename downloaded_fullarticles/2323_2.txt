    <p>
    As an eleven year old, he is not particularly ambitious nor has he
    developed enough to be considered cunning but he is loyal to a fault, or at
    least he will be once he finds people worthy enough.
</p><p>
    “Better be…. GRYFFINDOR!”
</p><p>
    He does not consider himself to be brave, only capable of working under
    pressure and doing what needs to be done.
</p><p>
    Apparently a sentient hat and a table full of strangers find this
    definition of his self most applicable.
</p><p>
    But he would rather be with them than the group in yellow smiling
    indifferently.
</p><p>
    <em> </em>
</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    “Look what I have here! Looks like Longbottom forgot something!” The blond
    kid is a spoiled prat.
</p><p>
    He sighs, no one else was doing anything and he does not much mind Neville.
</p><p>
    “Give it back, Malfoy.” <em>Trash.</em>
</p><p>
    The entire situation is ridiculous, he is 50 feet in the air and diving
    head first towards the ground just to catch a toy.
</p><p>
    He lands to the cheers of his housemates and he honestly cannot find it
    within himself to care. That is, until he is carted away by a professor.
</p><p>
    Then, he fears for his life.
</p><p>
    He iss still so young and still so naïve.
</p><p>
    <em> </em>
</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    His first kill is accidental, honest.
</p><p>
    And probably could have been prevented if he had not gone along with his
    friends’ ideas and suspicions.
</p><p>
    As he sits on the stairs staring at the hands that dissolved a professor,
    he realizes two things.
</p><p>
    He is not the person everyone wants – expects – him to be and there is no
    reason he should have to bend himself backwards to meet their ideals.
</p><p>
    He is 11 the first time he kills a man and he cannot care less.
</p><p>
    <em> </em>
</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    Who in their right minds send a possibly traumatized child to live with
    abusive relatives?
</p><p>
    He is not – traumatized that is – but that does not mean that he will not
    work that angle for all it is worth.
</p><p>
    After a day of unnecessary physical labor, he sits in the smallest bedroom
    at Number 4 Private Drive in Surrey, he realizes.
</p><p>
    <em>“Muggles are trash.”</em>
</p><p>
    <em> </em>
</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    He is being harassed by a freakish creature with large ears and even larger
    eyes.
</p><p>
    It took his mail and causes him to be locked in his room.
</p><p>
    Then, it has the gall to block the barrier.
</p><p>
    Ronald may not have realized but he knoes it was that <em>thing’s</em>
    fault.
</p><p></p><div>
  <p>
        Standing awkwardly outside of the barrier, Ronald is quick to suggest –
        and suggest and suggest – that they take the spelled car to school and
        while they briefly entertain the idea he has a better one. Scrawling a
        quick note on scrap paper, he sends Hedwig off to locate. Professor
        McGonagall.

        Ever since the idiot manhandled him in the bookstore, he really wanted
        something terrible to happen to the new Defense professor and he would
        have no qualms being that terrible something.
    </p>
  <p>
        The man is a moron and most exciting thing that has ever happened to
        him had to do with someone forgetting his favorite color.
    </p>
  <p>
        Regardless of that, the man can spin elaborate tales that are only
        problematic when introduced as fact. Then, then, it is unacceptable.

        When people are scared they whisper but never approach. He thinks that
        sounds wonderful.
    </p>
</div><p>
    But now he is pissed, positively <em>irate</em>.
</p><p>
    If people are to be scared of him he would rather it be because of what he
    has actually done, like basically murdering Quirrel – something that
    everyone seemed to conveniently forget.
</p><p>
    But, no. Of course not.
</p><p>
    He just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and now
    everyone thinks he is aan evil muggle-hating foe.
</p><p></p><div>
  <p>
        It does not help that he can speak with snakes – God forbid he tries to
        help someone again. And that mess had just begun to pass when the
        incident occurres.
    </p>
</div><p>
    <em> </em>
</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    Ronald’s sister and the giant snake are dead and before him stands a man
    that should not exist.
</p><p>
    It is a mess of a situation.
</p><p>
    Apparently a diary – of all things – possessed Ginerva Weasley forcing her
    to locate and open the supposedly lost Chamber of Secrets.
</p><p>
    Guess it wasn’t so lost anymore.
</p><p>
    <em>I am Lord Voldemort</em>
    .
</p><p>
    By all rights he should br terrified, but he wonders how long it took to
    come up with an identity that was an anagram of his name.
</p><p>
    Dumbledore’s phoenix swoops in with the Sorting Hat – he wonders if the
    situation could possibly get more surreal – which held an ostentatiously
    golden sword.
</p><p>
    In a last ditch effort to save his hide, he holds the sword above his head
    as the snake’s jaws closed down. The sword is driven up through the roof of
    the snake’s mouth and it stills. But, as the universe continues to remind
    him, no good deed goes unpunished and he soon finds himself writhing on the
    ground the snake’s vemon coursing through his veins.
</p><p>
    In his agony, the diary and Ginerva Weasley slipfrom his mind.
</p><p>
    The phoenix begind to sing drowning out his screams and it’s tears sooth
    away the pain. As he reorients himself, the diary man smirks as he walks
    towards him a wand in hand.
</p><p>
    He is 12 the first time he intentionally kills.
</p><p>
    The sword weighs more than someone his size can realistically fight with.
    So, with his entire 95 pounds behind it, he hefts up the sword and swings.
</p><p></p><div>
  <p>
        The man is dead, Ginerva Weasley is dead, and so is the giant snake.
    </p>
  <p>
        He wonders when his luck will finally run out.
    </p>
</div><p>

</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    Molly’s daughter is dead and she is still coddling him. He supposes it
    could be worse, she could be cursing his name.
</p><p>
    He can only assume she is putting off dealing with the tragedy until she is
    in private.
</p><p>
    Ronald, however, is switching between depressed and furious.
</p><p>
    <em>“You’re Harry Potter!”</em>
</p><p>
    <em>“That doesn’t mean I can bring back the dead.”</em>
</p><p>
    He is still a child. A child who put his hopes in a person incapable of
    making them reality.

    still whispers.

    <em>“He’s Harry Potter, he should have saved her.”</em>
</p><p>
    He wants nothing more than shed away the gilded skin of Harry Potter.
</p><p>
    He steps off the Hogwarts Express and a thought strikes him with such
    clarity, such <em>tenacity</em>, that he cannot fathom how it did not occur
    to him before.

    even entertain thanking the Dursely’s for.

    Marge insults his family. His mother, his father, his <em>birthright</em>.
</p><p>
    He does not need magic to show he is more. He does not need magic to show
    dominance.

    He moves before he can formulate a better plan. With all his strength he
    grabsher by the neck and slams her and her chair to the floor.
</p><p>
    She screams bloody murder and Vernon slams him against the dining room
    wall.
</p><p>
    <em>“OUT BOY! GET OUT!”</em>
</p><p>
    He spats on his <em>uncle </em>and slips upstairs portraying a calm he does
    not feel.
</p><p>
    He commandeers one of Dudley’s old backpacks filling it with extra clothing
    and lets Hedwig out the open window.
</p><p>
    And without a second thought, he leaves his wand were it remains hidden.
</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    He is only on the streets for two weeks when a couple of punks with bb guns
    kill his only family.
</p><p>
    They were stalking him all day and when he finally stops and lets her land
    on his arm, they shoot six times only hitting twice. But, once is enough.
</p><p>
    He watches in horror as her talons releases their grip on his arm and
    watches her fall lifeless to the asphalt.
</p><p></p><div>
  <p>
        In her honor, he braids several of her feathers into his hair and
        buries her in a park within a hole deep enough no one would dare try to
        exhume her.
    </p>
  <p>
        He’s killed a man and the soul fragment of the most powerful wizard of
        the age. He feels no remorse when he beats the punks within an inch of
        their lives. He leaves them bleeding in an ally way and next thing he

        when the man returned to from which he came.

        The mafia is something new. Of course he had heard of the Families of
        Italy but they were there and he was in England where his biggest
        problem was whether or not he would get to eat that day.

    He certainly did not expect the nice old man Timoteo to be the Don of the
    most powerful Family in Italy.

    The man took him in, dressed him nicely, and sets him up with tutors to
    teach him Italian and the years of school that he missed.

    harmonization factor that pure skies radiate.
</p><p>
    The horcrux is a likely source of corruption.
</p><p>
    He cannot say he minds.
</p><p>
    He does not think he could handle being crowded 24/7.
</p><p>
    He had his fill of that in England.

</p><p>
    Flame training does wonders in getting his accidental magic under control.
</p><p>
    He learns how to combine his magic with his flames.
</p><p>
    He is stronger for it, possibly even stronger than Timoteo.
</p><p>
    He has always known that he would have to do something about his haywire
    magic but he always operated under the idea that he would cross that bridge
    when he must.

    to have attended schools in two separate secret societies.

    For the first few months, he is quiet.

    There is a kid that has been watching him intently since his first day.
</p><p>
    He has short messy hair – that was very nearly white – and sharp grey eyes.
</p><p>
    He is often seen in the company of the Cavallone heir – someone he knows
    would grow to be formidable.
</p><p>
    Xanxus hates the feeling of eyes on his back. Watching him, categorizing
    him, <em>bating him.</em>
</p><p>
    But the eyes watching him are not the eyes of a curious child, or the eyes
    of scared brats. They are cold, calculating as though he is constantly
    trying to determine if he can best him in a fight.
</p><p>
Then, one day, when he feels those eyes on him, he turns and    <em>smirks</em>.
</p><p>
    <em> </em>
</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    Superbi Squalo, his name is.

    The boy takes to tailing him about the school and through him he becomes
    acquainted with the Cavallone heir and their flamboyant upperclassman
    Lussuria Abano.
</p><p>
    Lussuria who takes it upon himself to proclaim them both his younger
    siblings.
</p><p>
    Xanxus decides that it was nice to have people that are not scared of him.
</p><p>
    People were scum, <em>trash</em>, but his people were alright.

    Back to back with no sign of rescue and without a clear win in sight.

    He feels <em>alive.</em>
</p><p>
    The group attacked them once they were off the neutral grounds of the
    academy.
</p><p>
    Their attackers have guns but, per academy policy, they are unarmed.
</p><p>
    They won, overwhelmingly.
</p><p>
    Afterwards, he took Squalo home with him.
</p><p>
    <em> </em>
</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    They were fresh into their sixteenth year when Squalo surpasses the Sword
    Emperor and they make Varia <em>theirs.</em>
</p><p>
    Lussuria joins them and a follower of Tyr swears his allegiance to Xanxus.
</p><p>
    That night they celebrate with wine and whiskey.
</p><p>
    A week later, Timoteo officially announced his ascension.
</p><p>
    It is the beginning of the decline of their relationship.

    .

    <strong><u> </u></strong>
</p><p>
    Unfortunately, becoming the head of an independent assassination squad is
    not an adequate excuse for skipping school.
</p><p>
    As he and Squalo walk the halls, he categorizes three types of people.
</p><p>
    Those who fear them.
</p><p>
    Those who want their favour.
</p><p>
    And those ambivalent.
</p><p>
    The Cavallone brat remains the only one in the third category.
</p><p>

</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    Xanxus is being stalked.
</p><p>
    By a kid. By a <em>literal child.</em>
</p><p>
    Lussuria notices him first when the kid follows them from school to
    headquarters. Lussuria has graduated at this point and spends his time
    cleaning house and establishing a new security protocol.
</p><p>
    He knows everything from what an underling had for breakfast to some kid
    slipping past the surveillance.
</p><p>
    It is bizarre but convenient.
</p><p>
    Squalo is upset he got bested by a kid.
</p><p>
    Xanxus is begrudgingly impressed.
</p><p>
    <em> </em>
</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    The kid’s name is Belphegor.
</p><p>
    They call him Bel.
</p><p>
    He slaughtered his family, has a pennant for knife fights, and frequently
    speaks in the third person.
</p><p>
    He fits in well.
</p><p>
    Lussuria thinks him adorable and Squalo thinks him <em>something.</em>
</p><p>
    Xanxus is just glad that the kid was not really a kid.
</p><p>
    He was not even good with children when <em>he</em> was a child.
</p><p>
    And he certainly does not have the patience for a whiney brat.
</p><p>
    A murderous prince he can handle.
</p><p>
    <em> </em>
</p><p>
    .
</p><p>
    At seventeen he and Squalo leave school and put all their effort towards
    rebuilding Varia.
</p><p>
    It is much easier to focus on what is important when someone was not
    hounding you about the Pythagorean Theorem.
</p><p>
    Neither of them were much for school anyways.
</p><p>
    Besides, photosynthesis wouldn’t help with an assassination.

    They still make Bel endure Lussuria’s tutoring.

</p><p>
    <em>“England?”</em>
</p><p>
    He pauses for a moment.
</p><p>
    And then tells him the truth.
</p><p>
    Squalo listens raptly and when he voiced his concern about Squalo’s belief
    in his story he simply shrugs and says:

    <em>“You hate liars.”</em>

    The supposed coup goes as planned.

    He is burned by the purity of the ring against his Wrath flames.

    And for all that they are an assassination squad, no lives are lost.
