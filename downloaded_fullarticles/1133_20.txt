    <p>Dumbledore paused, turning back as the goblet of fire flashed a sickly green, a heavy cloud of magic snuffing out the other torches as it enchantments fought whatever it was. With a few missputters, the goblet finally coughs out a piece of charred parchment. Showing dexterity not often found in a man his age, Dumbledore snatches it out of the air and reads it out.</p><p>“Harry,” he pauses, mind whirling as to how this will affect his various plans, “Potter.”</p><p>In the silence that followed, the horrified gasps of Hufflepuff, the Slytherin’s barely restrained fury and glee, depending on how informed they were, Ravenclaw table trying to figure out how this could have happened and how many rules this breaks, and finally Gryffindor drawing the breath to cheer, in this lull, Harry finds himself being pushed to his feet.</p><p>           “It wasn’t me!”he hisses out, looking back at his friends, at Hermione’s worried look and Ron’s quickly darkening countenance as he realizes what is going on. Harry can see the jealousy come over the redhead. As he walks forward, he continues raging in his head, <em>It wasn’t me! I didn’t put my name in- I wanted a quiet year dammit! Why does this always happen to me?</em></p><p>           The next few steps throw up warning to his senses, and he looks up to see the head table and the Goblet straight ahead. As he nears the Goblet of fire he breaks out into sweat and his legs shake. His vision swims and something in his gut starts pulling him toward the cup. As he got closer and closer the pull grew until he was forcing himself to brace against it. He was nearly around the head table when disaster struck.</p><p>           He tripped. He had been so focused on the feeling his magic was giving off that he hadn’t been paying attention to his feet. His foot caught something and he pitched forward. His shoulder shoved the stand off balance, the cup careening atop it. His glasses askew, Harry watched as the golden goblet tilted one way, another, before overbalancing and falling on him. The moment the flames hit his skin, he screamed. But it didn’t hurt so much as just feeling hot. Not burning his skin, but a lot like he imagined an iron ingot felt as it entered the forge.</p><hr/><p>
  <strong>BIND. BIND. COMPETE. PURIFY. BIND. PURIFY. SELECT. BIND. THREE. FOUR? FOUR. BIND. BOUND. BIND. BOUND. COMPETE.</strong>
</p><p>The thrum of ancient magic, of power so foolishly bound and contrived, so arrogantly placed and used- the growl of primality, of something that had no right being woken burned through Harry’s mind. Smoky fingers squeezed and kneaded the words, the oath into his mind. The ministry had no idea what the Goblet of Fire was. They had used something so far beyond their understanding for such a trivial matter. Something that Harry was coming to believe, as the flames poured though his veins and scoured his systems clean, they had no right to use in the first place. The Goblet of Fire was not for mortal purposes, or at least, not for something as banal as choosing participants in a tournament.</p><p>From the audience, no one had any clue what was going on. A fourth champion had been called, but he seemed reluctant to go. As he got closer and closer to the front, the weight of what he did seemed to sink in. His face paled, his steps slowed. He now realized what he had gotten himself into. But there was no backing out. All of Hogwarts groaned when he tripped, while the other schools laughed. Any who had harbored sympathy for the fourth year who had gotten in over his head, well, they didn’t care so much anymore. School pride and all that rot. Then the flames lit.</p><p>One moment, Harry had been on the ground, the cup falling towards him. The next, he was an inferno. The students’ laugher turned to screams as the heat washed through the great hall, singeing eyebrows and igniting stray papers. All the moisture evaporated in an instant as the temperature skyrocketed. Cerulean covered his form, lances of emerald and azure arced out before falling back into the ball of plasma. Inside, they could only guess. At first you heard the screams, but then it was just silent, but no smell of burning flesh. The fire seemed to build, and build, before whooshing out, smoke running down the alleys between tables, three feet thick. Everybody craned their necks to see what had happened.</p><hr/><p>“Potter? Potter? Can you hear me Mr. Potter?” Harry tried to move, tried to see but he couldn’t. His limbs were lead pipes, and everything was far, far too bright. “Mr. Potter? Can you move?”</p><p>“Pr- Professor? What happened?” He croaked, feeling like he had just done another round with the snake.</p><p>“I don’t know, Mr. Potter. You tripped, and had some kind of reaction to the Goblet.”</p><p>“Yeah. Was too busy trying not to fall over to remember to watch my feet.” Harry added.</p><p>“Falling over? Were you sick Mr. Potter?”</p><p>“N- err, maybe. I don’t think so, but everything felt bad. As I got closer to the goblet, it got worse. I was almost past it when-“ </p><p>“Harry, m’boy, you must go into the other room. The other champions are waiting for you.” Dumbledore interjected with false calm.</p><p>“Yeah.” Harry groaned. The spots had just started to fade when a pair of hands grabbed his wrists and dragged him up. Everything went bright again, and he staggered to the table, resting on the edge of it as he adjusted again.</p><p>“This way.” Someone grabbed his elbow and began navigating him.</p><p>“Thanks.” Harry wheezed, trying to get a sense of his, well, senses.</p><hr/><p>“Right. Now that we’re all here- Merlin! Mr. Potter what happened?” an unfamiliar voice began.</p><p>“Mr. Potter had an accident with the goblet. Let’s get this out of the way so that he may go to the infirmary.” The voice on his elbow said.</p><p>“So, yes, now that we’re all here, though maybe not in one piece, welcome to the Tri-Wizard Tournament. You-“</p><p>“Quad-Wizard.” The voice said again.</p><p>“I beg your pardon?” Ludo stopped.</p><p>“There’s four of them- Quad-Wizard tournament.”</p><p>“But that doesn’t roll off the tongue…” Ludo protested, quailing under the glare from Harry’s supporter. “You’ve all been selected by the Goblet of Fire to represent your schools in the upcoming tournament.”</p><p>“If they’re selected based on school, then what school will Mr. Potter be representing?”</p><p>“Hogwarts of course.” Bagman responded.</p><p>“And Mr. Diggory?”</p><p>“Hogwarts as well.” Bagman continued.</p><p>“Then we need to wait, since there’ll be two more contestants on their way soon.”</p><p>“Two more?” Bagman sounded confused.</p><p>“Yes. If Hogwarts has two champions then so should Durmstrang and Beaubatons.”</p><p>“Don’t be absurd! Mr. Potter is an irregularity. He is the Boy-Who-Lived!” Bagman added.</p><p>“I hate that name.” Harry muttered.</p><p>“That does not give him special privileges.” Snape butted in.</p><p>“Exactly.” Harry’s elbow guide agreed, “Hence they cannot represent their schools, at least not formally. Perhaps the Goblet was improperly commanded for this tournament. Or perhaps it picked the strongest four contestants, as was the case when the Romans had it. With varying numbers, of course.”</p><p>“Are you implying that the ministry bungled the arrangements for the Tri-Wizard Tournament?” Crouch roared.</p><p>“Seeing as we have four participants, chained to the thing, yes. They did tell you that, right? You’re chained to the Goblet until the tasks are over. It gets <em>creative</em> if you try to resist.”</p><p>“Professor Maxime, iz this true? Are we truly bound to zis.. thing?”</p><p>“Igor. Vat haf you gotten me into?”</p><p>“Am I correct in assuming you had no idea either, Mr. Diggory?” Harry’s elbow guide added softly in the insuring silence.</p><p>“My Dad said to trust the Ministry. I trust him.” Cedric replied, his voice shaking like a first year’s levitation charm.</p><p>Harry blinked and tried to remain focused, but all he could hear was the pounding of the Goblet’s magic. Though, he felt lighter and freer than ever. He focused on the cleaner feeling and tried to ignore the thrum and cadence of the goblet’s magic in his head. But the rhythmic pounding and the exhaustion of being forcibly stripped and restructured by the goblet proved too much.</p><hr/><p>A nudge pulled Harry back to the present.</p><p>“So, I doubt you were awake for much of that. Eh, Mr. Potter?” The voice asked.</p><p>“No, I was!” Harry immediately said.</p><p>“Right, then what dates’ the first task?”</p><p>“….”</p><p>“How about the Ball? You should remember that one.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Don’t lie to someone, Mr. Potter, without a good reason. Ignorance is never a good reason unless it concerns fashion or décor. Then, always defer to her judgement. The First task is November 7<sup>th</sup>, and the Yule Ball is the 24<sup>th</sup> of December. Think you’ll remember that?”</p><p>“Yessir.” Harry said.</p><p>“Good. Now, let’s get you to Pomphrey before she sends out hunting parties.”</p><hr/><p>           Madame Pomphrey had, thankfully, heard about Harry’s accident with the Goblet. She was ready for him. She tsked and pulled him off of Professor Moody, leading him to his now standard cot.</p><p>           “Alastor, you may go. I’ll see that he is healed and sent to bed, else kept overnight.” The Healer said. The grizzled auror nodded and lumbered off, staff clunking as he walked.</p><p>           “Well, well, Mr. Potter, didn’t take you long at all to come and visit me.” Madame Pomphrey said, handing him a hospital gown. “See you in a minute.”</p><p>           When Harry returned to the main room of the infirmary, there was a tray of potions by his bedside.</p><p>           “Hopefully we won’t need all of them, hm?” She asked, waving her wand. “Let’s see, still not eating enough, your core is half empty, blood pressure lower than normal. Other than your normal chronic ailments, you’re physically fine.” She waved her wand and all but two of the potions flew back to her cabinet. “Up you go. One is a blood replenisher, the other a sleeping draught. One swallow of each.</p><p>“You’ll spend the night here, just to be safe.” She declared. ‘<em>Also, to give your friends some time to cool off.’</em></p><p>           What she didn’t tell him was how he had seemingly acquired the ailments. For once, this wasn’t from damage, but rather the opposite. Whatever had happened with the goblet, it had only helped Mr. Potter so far. His magical core had expended, not unlike someone who had been released from a long-term binding. Some of the lingering damage from the basilisk had been cleaned out too. The lack of nutrition was unfortunately beyond the Goblet’s magic to fix, but she had a feeling that whatever had happened, Harry would have a bit more of an appetite now. His organs were reporting better than they had at the end of the year previous, and she had a feeling his eyes were going to be better too. The final thing she noted was that his scar no longer looked so fiery. It had settled down, no longer straining to break free of his forehead. Whether it was done fighting him, or merely exhausted by the goblet’s forced corrections, she could not say. It had always been a peculiar ailment.</p>
