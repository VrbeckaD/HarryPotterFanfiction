    <p>At Luna’s insistence they were seated at a table near the window. The unusual cloudless day let the sun shine down, making the snow glitter in the bright light.  The sunlight made her essence glow even more than usual. It wasn’t the first time Blaise wondered if she had some creature blood in her lineage somewhere. Not that he ever lingered on that thought for long. Not that it would matter anyway. He had decided she was his - in no uncertain terms, even if they hadn’t actually discussed all those terms yet. They had discussed enough of them and he had a feeling that she knew of the ones left unsaid. Part creature and part Seer, he was quite sure. Besides, if she hadn’t backed away in the few months they had been seeing each other, he doubted she was likely to. Until she simply drifted on, that is.</p><p>He watched her gazing out the window, observing the snow and people from their table inside the cozy yet posh magical cafe. Her fingers swirled and danced just above the tabletop either making calculations, absently practicing spells or simply acting of their own accord. He could never really be sure, which was one of the reasons the little witch sitting across from him intrigued the steady wizard.</p><p>They sat at their table in their little cafe as they did, at his insistence, at least once a week.  This way he knew she was eating and taking a break from whatever research she was currently involved in – even if it was only a weekly occurrence.  Blaise knew that sometimes she traveled, she was fascinated by creatures that usually didn’t exist and he suspected she was an Unspeakable, or at least on her way to becoming one, but there was no way to know for sure. No matter how deep his pockets were or how far his influence reached. Not that he was interested in finding out anyway. She was interesting enough as it was. Besides, something else he knew was that she certainly wasn’t seeing anyone else.</p><p>Blaise realized that Luna’s crystal blue gaze was upon him and wondered how long they had been sitting staring at each other. Shifting his gaze down to her slight lips, he watched as the corners turned up into a small grin.</p><p>He watched those lips open slightly and say, “You had something you wanted to ask me?”</p><p>He glanced back up to her eyes and was taken in again by her consuming gaze. He hadn’t said a word since they arrived and even though this was their regular lunch date, she of course knew he had something specific to ask this time.</p><p>“Pansy is having a party next Saturday evening, and sent me an invitation,” he started.</p><p>“Oh,” Luna exclaimed, sitting a little taller. “Of course we can set up rules!”</p><p>“Luna…” Blaise said with a slight threat in his voice.</p><p>Her eyes had gone slightly out of focus, and he watched her come back into the moment as she looked up at him sweetly and added “After you’ve asked me, of-”</p><p>“You’re cruisin’…”</p><p>Luna giggled, got up and rounded the table to his side, wiggling herself into the small booth beside him. “I’m sorry. I can’t help it; sometimes you’re just so obvious.” Blaise seriously doubted this but believed she was the only person in the Wizarding world who thought so.</p><p>She surreptitiously arranged her legs onto his lap under the table, looked up at him and said “You had something you wanted to tell me?”</p><p>“Yes,” Blaise stated, his annoyance curbed by her closeness and the feel of the impossibly soft fabric of her dress as she brought his hand to rest on top of her thigh. “But behave yourself, otherwise there will be more rules than usual for this event.”</p><p>Luna simply beamed up at him and wiggled a little closer.</p>
