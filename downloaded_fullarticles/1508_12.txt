  <strong>Chapter 1: The Escape</strong>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Time moved so slowly in this place. She had lost track of the days but could assume it had been over a fortnight as she stared down at her long, dirty fingernails. How stupid she had been. They had called her the Brightest Witch of Her Age. It's laughable at how easily she was persuaded by the beautiful boy to come on a grand adventure. How could she not? The quiet, mousy girl with no friends, and nothing but books to keep her company, sat at the window sill dreaming of quests and magic. Then this person—not quite a man, no longer a boy—rapped on the glass of her bedroom window. He was flying! Actually flying—without a broom! With a pet serpent suspended in a magical bubble no less. <em>Tom Riddle.</em> Even his name was an enigma.</p><p>He told her of a place with more magical energy than she could ever imagine, and that she could come and see it for herself.</p><p>
  <em>It's the island of Morsmordre, at an intersection of seven lay lines. The energy pulses around you; feeds your magic. You'd never have to use your wand ever again.</em>
</p><p>His words, hypnotic. His eyes, alluring. His smile, impish. There was no denying him. He and his familiar prowled around her, the act of persuasion coming to him as natural as breathing.</p><p>Looking back, he must have had her under some sort of spell, luring her to follow him. If she were truly in control of herself, she would have been calculated, she would have asked him questions, she would have asked for proof. But she didn't. Now, Hermione Granger was the prisoner of a mad immortal and his band of lost boys.</p><p>Much like a little bird, in her little cage, Hermione listened and observed. It didn't start like this. No. They treated her like a rare treasure to behold. Together with Riddle and his boys, she flew over the island, its lush rainforests smelling of the sweetest vegetation, crystalline waterfalls that reflected sunlight in the most brilliant way. They pointed out the lands she was never to venture to—The Pirate Cove, The Mermaid Lagoon, The Fairy Hollow, and the Skull Cave. Instead of venturing into enemy territory, they went to the white sand beaches where they would dive for oysters and lobsters, and feast upon the shore. All the boys collected their pearls to create a bracelet for Hermione, marking her as part of their family.</p><p>They were all so unique in their own way, mischievous as well. She had discovered that none of these teenagers were what they seemed. Some were over a hundred years old, Riddle being the eldest. Morsmordre kept them young, and they all swore to never return back to the Wizarding World. It didn't matter to them if their old families died out. While Tom was the leader and her guide on this adventure, it was one of his lieutenants, who she found most fascinating. He stood out as a shining beacon. Fair-haired and fair-skinned, his features somehow impervious to the sun's rays. He was called Draco. Such a unique name. She hadn't determined if it was his given name or another one of the many nicknames the boys beheld.</p><p>There were only two women in their motley crew—the serpent that Tom kept close to him, was actually a beautiful woman named, Nagini. The first time she had transformed in front of Hermione, she was taken aback. Animagi were so rare, but a Maledictus was considered mythical. When Nagini spoke to Hermione, her accented voice was exotic and foreign, but at the same time, serpentine. She was the one who had convinced Hermione that she must trust Tom and the boys, and that the magic of the island was so powerful, that she would have been permanently rendered into her animal form had it not been for Tom's intuition and finding the island. It was also during this conversation that Hermione discovered that Nagini was not a pet or symbol of the crew, she was Tom's lover, and the only being he truly prized other than himself.</p><p>The other girl, who appeared to be only sixteen, but her age a mystery, with hair wilder and more unruly than Hermione's own, named Bellatrix Black. Jealous, petty, and cruel, and immediately voiced her distrust of Hermione. The stories she fabricated and lies she whispered into the boys' ears. Perhaps Hermione would have stayed in Riddle's favor if it weren't for her. Trix convinced all the boys that Hermione was pretty to look at, but her blood was dirty. The pretty Mudblood would never belong. Despite being on the island for decades, and forfeiting her claim to ancient titles, Bellatrix still held on to blood status prejudice.</p><p>Riddle. Pan. Lost Boys. All these pet names. She found it laughable. They would parade under the guise of these endearing, enchanting monickers. It was only on the night she was thrown in her dingy cage did she find out the truth. Pan, so named for the Pied Piper who lured children, was known by the locals as Voldemort, and his followers, Death Eaters, for they truly feasted on death. Not on flesh, but magic stolen from impressionable witches and wizards. Eternal youth had come at an extraordinary cost. How? She was still unsure but she knew it was coming soon.</p><p>Plagued by the thought of her oncoming death, she still attempted to talk and befriend anyone who came near her cage. Persuade them to give her information or an audience with Tom. Anything to prove her usefulness, but it had been hours since she had seen anyone. It was hard to convince anyone of anything if there's no one around.</p><p>Just then, she heard steps coming closer.</p><p>"Hello, is someone there?"</p><p>"Shh…" the voice commanded.</p><p>Slowly, the figure came into the light. It was Draco.</p><p>"We don't have much time," he said as he fumbled with the lock. The boy waved his hand and muttered several incantations, far more complex than <em>Alohomora</em>, and all without a wand. It clicked opened and fell to the ground. He reached his hand into the cage and pleaded urgently, "Come with me."</p><p>"Are you sure?" She asked timidly, fearful of Riddle's wrath. "What if we get caught?"</p><p>"We won't if you come now," he urged. "Please."</p><p>Hermione took his hand and stepped out of the cage, feeling her first full range of motion in days. She was stiff and weak and had no idea how she would run or where they would escape to.</p><p>"Take that off," Draco pointed to the pearl bracelet they had made her that first day. "Leave it. Each one of those pearls has a magical trace to whoever gave it to you."</p><p>With that, she threw it to the ground, and the pearls scattered in every direction.</p><p>Barely a word was said as he led her through an underground labyrinth, passing small coves, and enormous caverns. Her legs burned as they ascended steep slopes, which she prayed led to the outside world. They had hit what appeared to be a dead end.</p><p>Draco ran his finger against the stone wall and drew a series of patterns that Hermione recognized at old Norse runes. Was Morsmordre near Scandinavia? Or was this language all part of the Death Eaters amassed magical knowledge? His tracings illuminated and rearranged themselves into an archway, revealing a path outside.</p><p>"Let's go," he commanded.</p><p>"Where are we going? Where can I hide? How can I get home?"</p><p>Draco's face became stern as they traversed the jungle. "I can get you close, but I can't take you to him. If I take you to him, I break the truce."</p><p>Pushing leaves out of her way, trying to keep up, she asked, "What do you mean, break a truce?"</p><p>"The pirate captain, Hook. We have a very delicate arrangement right now. None of us come into his camp, and none of his come to ours."</p><p>"But is he dangerous? How do you know he's safer than being on my own."</p><p>Draco stopped and turned around. "I don't. But I do know he's not going to siphon your magic."</p><p>Hermione shuddered at the thought. "How is it that you can use magic without a wand, and I can't?"</p><p>"I've given the island a piece of my soul, and in exchange, it gives me magic." His face dropped and looked remorseful. "Trust me, you don't want this curse."</p><p>She was astounded at this admission. "Then why stay? If you consider your gifts a curse."</p><p>Dodging the questions, he said, "Keep moving. We don't have time to get into this. I can already sense they know you're gone."</p><p>"How can you—nevermind." She already knew the answer must have something to do with the island.</p><p>Her mind warred with itself. She was trapped in a strange land without her wand and wasn't sure who to trust. Who was this boy, and why did he want to help her? How did she know that he was leading her to freedom, and not into one of the many games the boys played? There were a million questions she wanted to ask him but her guide seemed so focused and unapproachable. She just followed steadfastly until—</p><p>"AAAGH!" she screamed in anguish.</p><p>Draco was several paces ahead of her when it happened. His head whipped around to chastise her, but when he turned, he saw the long thorn that had pierced through her slipper, impaling her foot. She was bleeding. Fast. He ran to her and spoke to her in calm, soothing tones. "You need to relax. I'm going to take out the thorn, and it's going to hurt." He quickly removed a leather belt from his waist, folded it, and held it in front of her mouth. "Bite on this. You have to stay quiet, or they'll find us."</p><p>She nodded and took the leather between her teeth. They both looked around for any bystanders and also to make sure the ground was clear of any other thorns. She found a safe spot to sit as he squatted beside her. Gently, he placed her foot in his lap and nodded, letting her know that he was ready. She took a quick intake of breath through her nose as she felt the stinging relief in her foot. Tears streamed down her eyes, the pain overwhelming her.</p><p>"You're doing good. Keep it up. I'm going to close the wound. I don't have any potions or salves, so we'll have to find something to prevent infection." He removed the bloody shoe and clasped his hands around her tiny foot. His hands were cool and comforting, easing the pain, then she felt his palms warm, as they repaired her flesh. When he opened his hands, he smiled, pleased with himself. "Good as new."</p><p>"But now I need shoes. I won't be able to make it through this jungle barefoot."</p><p>Draco examined the bloody slipper, wondering if it was worth transfiguring into something more substantial when he noticed they were near a rubber tree and vines. "Can you stand?"</p><p>Hermione got up but was unsteady on her feet. "It's still really sore."</p><p>"It will be until we get you some potions or herbs. Take off your other shoe and just stand here," he commanded.</p><p>She did as he said and stared at him curiously. He ripped the bark off the rubber tree and placed his hand on the dripping sap, while placed the other hand on some creeping vines. He uttered a transfiguration spell she knew well, but again, wandless. Suddenly, the rubber sap and vines began to creep toward her and wind their way around her feet; the tiny vines weaving themselves into an intricate pattern and the rubber forming thick soles and a protective barrier around her toes.</p><p>Hermione gasped. "You made me rattan wellies?"</p><p>"I'm sorry I don't have leather," he exasperated.</p><p>"No," she said apologetically. "They are brilliant and quite beautiful."</p><p>He tinged a shade of pink, in embarrassment. "We need to get going again. Can you walk in them?"</p><p>She took a few steps, and her foot throbbed, but she would manage. "Let's just go and hope the pirates have potions."</p><p>"And if we can't make it there by sunset, we'll go to the Mermaid Lagoon. They have healing waters," he explained as he put her arm over his shoulder.</p><p>"I thought we weren't allowed there either," she recalled.</p><p>"I'm not, but maybe you are. I hope you can swim."</p>
