    <p>“I hope I haven’t offended you with my plea,” the aristocrat stated over the clinking of glass, his counterpart was currently setting aside two sizeable gulps of whiskey within. The silence stretched past the clinks of ice disposed into them until the bottle itself was dripping dry, it was safe to say that Lucius was well aware of his misdeed in coming here. </p><p>He was handed off a glass that he took a polite sip from before depositing it on the nearby surface. The man he was seeing had a band of gold melted around his forefinger shining dully in compression with the wedding band above it. As the man raised the drink to his lips, the band shined in the flames of the fire. He simply took a sip and chuckled heartily. </p><p>“Lucius,” he sang, “lighten up, I’m not a killer.” A killer passed the point of survival; the slayer of the dark lord himself jokes. “But, I am no fool.” </p><p>“I never-” </p><p>“You’ve never been called out on it.” James interrupted. “I find it quite odd someone of your rank will grovel at the feet of a filthy blood traitor. I know your father was within his ranks as you were during your time at and outside of Hogwarts. I know your name is trapped within the files at your ministry and I know you fear the kiss.” James paused setting the glass down. “I know you are desperate to give your balls to come here and ask for the hand of my sons to save your own ass. You are just as scared and pathetic as you were behind that mask you wore.” </p><p>The Slytherin huffed and sprouted a very uncharacteristic gloom. “I have not come to be humiliated and dragged. I’ve merely come for the safety of my family, and it’s obvious I will not find such things here!” </p><p>“Oh come off it, Malfoy!” Potter groaned in annoyance. “I’ve not finished yet….See, we all want something, and I’m lucky you had the gall to admit first. I was never one for admitting defeat, that is why I need you to talk to Snape for me.”</p><p>“Snape?”</p><p>“Yes, Snape.” the Bulgarian sighed, running a hand through his frayed hair. Taking on Grindelwald did not suit well for a teenager who barely hit puberty. Instead being an adult hit him with solid shots aimed to kill. He’s only 23 for Merlin’s sake, having had Harry in his 20’s did not serve him well either.</p><p>“How do you know him?”</p><p>“I married his best friend.” It was inevitable meeting Severus when he had visited Cokeworth on a mission to find a Horcrux. Lily and he told each other it was a destiny meeting at chance. He stayed the summer, and they wrote the years learning any and everything about each other. Lily —like every wizard on the outskirts of the war— heard of Grindelwald and all the troubles birthed from his reign. She was there for all his problems, through his school bullies till Sirius, his only brother’s death. </p><p>James, in turn, heard any and everything lily had to offer. How class went that day and what spells she mastered to which ones needed more practice. To how Severus created a potion and how it’ll change the world. Lily’s entry to the slug club and how it will send her to the top of her class. He’s hanging out with that bullfrog Malfoy again. Who Mary was sleeping with and what she told them in the dorms. Severus was talking about the dark arts still, his fantasies of using it to further his knowledge in potions. What she got for Christmas, and how Petunia had broken it the next day. How Severus' spell ricocheted and cut her arm in several cuts to the point of having to go to the infirmary. And ofcourse, he remembered the raid. </p><p>How dark it was as the rain poured and twisted along the wind it was winter break and there was no snow in the sky. He remembers sneaking out under his mentor’s eye and portraying cokeworth anyway how the muggles were screaming and running as their house was attacked and burned. By then, he knew of Peter’s betrayal and how he ratted out his love interest out for all to hear and strike. They were doing this to hurt him; they were only targeting the home of his love. </p><p>Lily stood there between them. Severus screamed out for her to take his hand so they could find shelter. But it was James she had run to and James who attacked when he made a move towards them. Shouting “sectumsempra,” a spell Lily had expressed great grief over when Severus had happily told her of his newest creation. Now with the war over Severus’s file laid side by side with Lucius’s on the terrorist list. James never knew whether or not he was bound there or if he just wanted to see James die. </p><p>“But on to the point,” he said, waving his hand. “I know your headmaster has taken him in, and he speaks highly of his craft. He said he has created a potion….wolfsbane, I want it. A dear friend of mine was attacked by that vicious beast Fenrir and has been suffering the effects ever since. If you convince him to supply, I will concede” Lucius smiled. “After! It's written in blood that you will pass over Grindelwald's wand. I know you kept it, and I wish to see it at their union.” </p><p>It was more important than anything James could want in his aging life. He knew a part of him was still trapped inside that wood, and it hunted him every day that it was in someone else’s hands. If Lucius fails and gets executed they will ransack his manor and burn it down the wand with it. James couldn’t risk losing a part of himself, and couldn't risk the British ministry trying to keep it upon their knowledge of it still being out there. </p><p>“You fail me these things, Lucius, and once my protections are gone, you’ll be facing the kiss. Thank Merlin I need you as much as you need me.”</p><p>With a final send off the regal man returned home and regarded his wife kissing her hand upon arrival. She sat near the fire book in hand as Kreacher rocked a young babe to sleep. She was scared. She knew there was a spot at the hanging tree alongside her husband, alongside her child. Bellatrix, her only sister, was executed immediately all those years ago. </p><p>She remembers her screaming face as she cried in agony at her lover's death. It was broadcasted in the prophet for months, Her entry into the ministry how many lives she took with her. Other than her, no one else was keen to make their stance clear on what they had on their forearm. But now there was a rat, someone was talking and already nine of the elite were captured or killed. Regulus had warned her that she better act fast, for he didn’t want to see her dead. “I can only push them off your scent for so long, the minister is already suspicious of me because of my relation to Bella.” and had left in an illusion of crimson robes. </p><p>She knew the worst was coming. But Lucius smiled at her then, a facade of a relaxed and controlled smile gracing his lips. </p><p> “My love, I have wondrous news.”</p><p> </p><p>
