Whispers Behind The Dusty Books</strong>
</p><p>“There is a... rumor, of sorts, between the ghosts in the castle,” Hermione flipped the dusty book on her lap. <em>Ghosts And How to Find Them</em>, by Jonathan Nightinghale.</p><p>Curious.</p><p>“What kind of rumor?”</p><p>“...about, another kind of ghost. They call it a halfa, I think. They said that like it’s some kind of slur,” she wrinkled her nose, “Abnomination.” At least, that was what The Bloody Baron called it. She debated with herself for a long time whether to agree with that or not.</p><p>An eyebrow raised, “<em>Ha-fuh</em>?” Well, make it two. “Where did you hear it, ‘Mione?”</p><p>“It’s pronounced <em>hal-fa</em>, Ron. And I overheard it from Nearly Headless-Nick last week,” she trailed, “Since the ghosts were pretty rattled for some reason, I guess this is really important.”</p><p>“Since when you cared about their afterlife?”</p><p>Hermione shut her book with a snap, “Are you seriously asking me <em>that</em>?” she hissed, “The Ghosts were rattled, Ron. All of them. Did you ever see them like... like <strong><em>that</em></strong> before?”</p><p>“Not since Riddle’s diary.” Harry quiped.</p><p>That successfully shut Ron mouth’s up.</p><p>“Exactly, Harry,” She contemplated the book on her lap, “But no matter which book I read, I never found a <em>thing</em> about this creature. Not a picture. No name. No <em>damn</em> hint. No <em>nothing</em>.”</p><p>“You’re obsessed, Hermione,” ...and this was the usually paranoid Harry Potter talking, “What is a <em>halfa</em>, anyway?”</p><p>Halfa... <em>half</em>. Half of. But <em>half</em> <em>of</em> what?</p><p>“...that is exactly what I intend to find out.”</p><p>She didn’t like the way her stomach twisted in a knot at that.</p>
