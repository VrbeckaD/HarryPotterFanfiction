Why does Kingsman care? Because the artist is including a tiny replica of the Kingsman symbol in every painting. Chester asks Harry to investigate, and along the way he is distracted by a lovely young man he meets in a coffeehouse.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This fic has Eggsy as a graffiti artist who uses the Kingsman symbol in his work as homage to his father. The imagery of the Kingsman symbol in the lion's eye was really striking to me, so I really wanted to make something with it!</p><p> </p>
