  <p>It wasn't that Narcissa didn't enjoy being pregnant, in fact she had loved almost every minute of it, but she was getting bored now. Her stomach was protruding heavily as she sat reading in the library. She was getting uncomfortable as she rubbed the top of her stomach, trying to settle her child. As she ran her hand over, a firm kick met her hand. She had to smile, her son. The one they had always wanted. But none the less she was fed up, she wanted to be able to go back to how she was without having to watch what she was doing. Lucius had been walking on egg shells for weeks because their due date was rapidly approaching. She finished her page and stood as she placed the book back in the shelf. It was then that everything changed. She frowned as she was suddenly highly uncomfortable. Rubbing her stomach she looked down to the puddle by her feet. She paled instantly,</p>
  <p>"Lucius!" She screamed. She could hear the clatter from down the hall. She hadn't moved since she had seen the puddle,</p>
  <p>"Cissy? What's wrong? What's happened?" He asked she turned and looked at him, was he really asking if everything was alright of course nothing was alright,</p>
  <p>"We have to go to St Mungos" She stated.</p>
  <p>"What-" He was about to ask something when pain contorted on Narcissa's face as a contraction hit. He nodded and quickly helped his wife to the fire. "Dobby!" He yelled, the house elf quickly appeared. "We're going to the hospital, make sure everything is prepared and inform the family" He instructed the small elf nodded and ran off as they stepped into the fire. As they Flooed to St Mungo's Narcissa only got worse. Her contractions were becoming closer and closer.</p>
  <p>"Welcome How may i-"</p>
  <p>"My wife is in labour!" Lucius shouted at the poor mediwitch. She nodded and quickly summoned a chair. Narcissa was quickly swept away as another contraction hit her. They were in the wards when she was taken into the room. Lucius went to follow but was quickly pushed back,</p>
  <p>"You're not allowed in sir" A man stated as he walked inside. Lucius was stood pacing as he could hear Narcissa's cries of pain through the doors. He flinched every time his wife screamed. On the other side of the doors, Narcissa was getting ready to hex the medi witch. She was being pathetic in her attempts to sooth the woman. Narcissa screamed as another contraction hit. "Mrs Malfoy, you have to push, now!" She was ordered, she did as she was told, this child was not causing her anymore pain. She pushed with everything her body had. She was exhausted as she fell back into the bed. She could see the Healer moving about but she couldn't see her son.</p>
  <p>"What-What is it?" She asked weakly. The Healer turned round with a smile,</p>
  <p>"Nothing, she's perfect" He stated as he handed her the small bundle. "You have a perfectly healthy daughter" He stated and she frowned</p>
  <p>"Daughter?" She asked and he nodded handing her the small bundle. She moved the small bundle in her arms and moved the blanket, staring down at her child, she could see the small blonde hairs on her head as well as her grey eyes staring back at her. She couldn't help but grin. She took note of how small her child was and asked if it was normal,</p>
  <p>"Believe it or not, yes, regardless of how big you were when your pregnant it appears in your case there was just a lot of amniotic fluid" He stated, "I wouldn't worry, we've done an extensive check on you and your child, you're both fine" He explained and she nodded. She looked at the door where Lucius was stood outside, "Could you let my husband in now?" The Healer nodded and opened the door gesturing Lucius in before leaving himself. Lucius walked tentatively in,</p>
  <p>"How is he?" Lucius asked, Narcissa looked up with tears beginning to form,</p>
  <p>"We don't have a son Lucius, we have a daughter" She explained, Lucius looked taken aback at first before settling into the chair next to her, "I know how much you wanted a son" She stated, trying to hide her guilt.</p>
  <p>"I wanted a healthy wife and a healthy child regardless" he stated, standing he held his hands out, "May I?" He asked, he was always so formal in situations that made him feel awkward. She handed her small bundle over and he stared down lovingly at her,</p>
  <p>"What are we going to call her?" He asked, "We only planned boys names",</p>
  <p>"I had a thought. I thought about Lyra"</p>
  <p>"Lyra Malfoy" He said with a grin. Narcissa could only grin back as her child kicked her legs out from the blanket. Lucius chuckled as he tucked her back in only to hear her gurgle back. He handed her back as Narcissa held her tightly.</p>
  <p>The following day they returned home, one thing they had noticed with Lyra since she was born was that she didn't cry very much, sure she cried when she was hungry, like all babies did, but loud noises and other scary things didn't seem to bother the baby. Lucius had said it was her self-preservation but Narcissa knew it was also nothing to worry about, she had asked the healer about it but he had said that some children just don't cry when they're young. Narcissa wrapped her new born tightly to her chest as they stepped out of the floo. She knew her family would be waiting, her parents, Bella, her in laws. Walking into the room, she could hear voices in the drawing room,</p>
  <p>"Where are they?" She heard her father asked,</p>
  <p>"There is no reason for them to be this late unless something was wrong" She heard Orpha state. She looked up at Lucius who rolled his eyes,</p>
  <p>"Come we mustn't keep them waiting much longer" He sighed, walking in, the room went silent, Narcissa looked at Lucius who was staring at the people in their home, stood in front of them were they're parents, Cygnus and Druella, and Orpha and Abraxas.</p>
  <p>"Well, who would have thought a woman like you would have been able to produce an heir" Orpha stated snidely, Narcissa gritted her teeth but kept her mouth shut,</p>
  <p>"Mother, please" Lucius stated, "everyone, I'd like to introduce my daughter Lyra Malfoy" He stated as Narcissa held her child tightly,</p>
  <p>"A... A girl!" Orpha shrieked. Lyra squirmed slightly at the shrill voice.</p>
  <p>"Yes mother" Lucius stated snidely. "A girl"</p>
  <p>"How... Every first born of the Malfoy line is male everyone knows this" She hissed before turning to Narcissa, "This has to be you're doing you stupid girl" Orpha hissed,</p>
  <p>"Enough Orpha, we should be happy. And besides they may still have a son yet" Abraxas interfered,</p>
  <p>"I'm sure they will" Druella stated as she walked over looking at her grandchild, "She's beautiful Cissy" Druella stated and Narcissa nodded. Lucius grinned with pride. Not once had his child cried out in his mother's outburst. She kicked her legs out though, something she had done since she was born. Druella seemed taken aback slightly, "She's very active Narcissa" Druella stated, slightly shocked. Narcissa smirked at Orpha who seemed to narrow her eyes. The men had seemed to gravitate into their own conversation.</p>
  <p>"Does she have a middle name?" Orpha asked snidely,</p>
  <p>"No we haven't had the chance" Narcissa stated,</p>
  <p>"Well we have one now" Orpha stated. Narcissa quickly bit her tongue and looked at Lucius who shrugged, "She should be named Lyra" She practically spat the name out, "Septimus Malfoy" Narcissa gaped at the woman,</p>
  <p>"For a start, Septimus is a male name" Narcissa stated,</p>
  <p>"Fine Septima" She said with a shrug. Narcissa was exhausted, "She is a Malfoy she deserves a name befitting her bloodline"</p>
  <p>"You know what fine" She burst. "Lyra Septima Malfoy" She stated, she was exhausted and couldn't be bothered with arguing with her mother in law. The small child looked out to her most immediate family and gurgled. Narcissa stared down lovingly at her child, knowing she would have to protect her daughter from everyone and everything. Orpha seemed to sneer down at her baby,</p>
  <p>"She's quite small" Orpha criticised,</p>
  <p>"Hmm, she is" Cygnus commented,</p>
  <p>"The healer said she was healthy" Narcissa stated as she ran her thumb over her cheek, "She was early also" Narcissa stated,</p>
  <p>"I suppose" Orpha stated,</p>
  <p>"She'll grow" Cygnus said with a grin as he took Lyra from Narcissa, Lyra seemed to fuss slightly at the movement. She settled before kicking out again. Narcissa noted her father's smirk. Her father seemed to relax with Lyra in his arms eventually.</p>
  <p>That night Narcissa placed her new-born down, Narcissa had noted that her child barely seemed to cry, she had talked to her mother who had shrugged and stated that some babies don't. She hummed slightly as she stood and watched her baby. Looking outside into the cold winter air of December she could see the snow beginning to fall on the grounds.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Narcissa stared at the healer in disbelief, how was that even possible, She thought, she had only had Lyra six months ago,</p>
  <p>"Mrs Malfoy, I understand this is a bit of a shock" The healer stated,</p>
  <p>"I don't… I mean, I only had Lyra a few months ago" She protested and the healer shrugged,</p>
  <p>"It is rare but it can happen" He stated,</p>
  <p>"I don't understand" Narcissa stated, "I struggled to get pregnant with Lyra and yet not six months later I'm pregnant again?" Narcissa asked,</p>
  <p>"Sometimes, the hormones that keep you fertile stay after your pregnancy, it's rare but it can happen" He stated. Narcissa ran a hand through her hair, she had to tell Lucius. "I mean there are ways of abortion if you're-"</p>
  <p>"NO!" Narcissa shouted. This was the one chance she had to have another child, she loved being a mother to Lyra.</p>
  <p>"I'll get you all sorted with the same potions as last time" He stated getting up. After she had collected her potions she apparated home. Walking into the bathroom she put her things away before walking into her husband's study, she was happy he was here and not in the office,</p>
  <p>"How were the healers?" Lucius asked as he worked,</p>
  <p>"I'm pregnant" She stated bluntly, Lucius looked up clearly shocked,</p>
  <p>"But the time" He questioned, Narcissa sighed as she walked closer to him.</p>
  <p>"Apparently it can happen" Narcissa stated, Lucius sighed as he got up. Walking over to Narcissa he held her as she let out a panicked breath.</p>
  <p>Draco was born nine months later, he was a chubby baby and Narcissa and Lucius were quickly thrust into the reality of two young children. Lyra was teething which made matters worse. Narcissa was exhausted. Lyra couldn't stand the pain so she was screaming. Lucius dealt with her the best as he could, Narcissa was exhausted from the attention to Draco. Eventually it was the house eves that dealt with Lyra. Lucius couldn't be in the house all the time. Eventually the stage passed and the couple could relax slightly. Lyra had been used to playing on her own but now her brother wanted everything she had. Needless to say Lyra disagreed. Lyra was also showing signs of magic much to everyone's delight. It had been a normal day, Lyra had been sat playing with her dragon which she had named Alan, Draco was crawling around the house. Narcissa was sat reading, looking up she watched as Draco reached for the dragon, no one touched the dragon. Not even Lucius or Narcissa unless it was to place in Lyra's bed. Lyra had frowned and turned away from him, but Draco continued as he screamed at his sister to give it to him, since he had been born he had gotten everything he wanted. Narcissa had tried to get Lyra to share, well the child did for most. She wasn't overly immersed in toys, except Alan.</p>
  <p>"No" Lyra stated and turned back to Alan. This made it worse as Draco screamed at his sister. Lyra had enough and glared at him. Narcissa was shocked when the boy was blasted a small distance across the room. She wasn't sure what was worse. The scream her son let out or the shear panic on her daughters face. Narcissa was up quickly soothing her son. Eventually the baby calmed,</p>
  <p>"Lyra" Narcissa began but Lyra was shaking, getting up quickly she ran as fast as her little legs could take her. She soothed Draco for the most part but it didn't work he wouldn't let her go. Eventually Lucius returned,</p>
  <p>"Cissy what happened?" He asked,</p>
  <p>"Lyra did magic today" Narcissa stated,</p>
  <p>"Excellent" He grinned,</p>
  <p>"She sent Draco half way across room cause he tried to grab the dragon" She stated,</p>
  <p>"That bloody dragon" He muttered, "Is he fine?" Lucius asked, Narcissa nodded,</p>
  <p>"He wouldn't go down, so I can't go and see to our daughter" Narcissa stated. Lucius held his hand out for the boy. Narcissa handed him Draco, without a word and began upstairs, Draco protested but Lucius quickly shushed the baby. Narcissa walked into her daughters room, to find her curled up with the dragon,</p>
  <p>"Lyra" She called to get her daughters attention, she heard the sniffle. Sighing she sat next to her child. "Lyra, you aren't in trouble" Narcissa stated.</p>
  <p>"But I huwt him" She said quietly.</p>
  <p>"No you scared him" Narcissa corrected, "What you did, is normal" Narcissa tried to explain. Lyra looked up her eyes red and puffy.</p>
  <p>"Buw you don't do that" she said. Narcissa thought about a way to explain better,</p>
  <p>"Come see" Narcissa stated patting her lap. Lyra crawled from her spot and into her mother's lap. Narcissa concentrated on opening the door, she made the motion, but she wasn't very good at wandless magic. The door opened and then she shut it again with a slam, "See I did what you did" Narcissa explained. Lyra didn't move she was still frowning at the door. "What you did, was completely normal" Narcissa stated, Lyra nodded,</p>
  <p>"I'm sorry I scawed Dwaco" Lyra whispered,</p>
  <p>"I know" Narcissa stated stroking her hair, "But you mustn't scare him like that again" Narcissa stated gently, Lyra nodded,</p>
  <p>"But he wanted Alan, and no one touches Awan" Lyra stated strongly, Narcissa tried not laugh,</p>
  <p>"I think Draco knows that now" Narcissa stated with a smile. Lyra grinned innocently back at her mother.</p>
