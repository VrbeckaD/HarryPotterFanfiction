    <p>Sirius woke up one morning to find his whole body covered in scratches and bruises. He was used to scrapes and marks, but not like these.</p><p>He poked at his arm, carefully. It didn't hurt. He ran his finger over the scratches. They didn't feel raised at all.</p><p>He wasn't sure what they were, but he assumed his parents wouldn't be happy to see them. He'd been yelled at before for not covering up a skinned knee or a bruised cheekbone. He dressed carefully in his robes, making sure his arms and legs were well covered.</p><p>They faded within a week, but were back a few weeks later. When they vanished and appeared a third time, he vowed to tell his cousin Andromeda next time she visited. She would know what to do.</p><p>Luckily, she visited a few months later, and the marks were still visible. He waited until she and his brother Regulus were the only ones in the room.</p><p>"Look," he whispered, rolling up his sleeve.</p><p>"Oh, sweetie," she whispered, "who did this to you?" Regulus scooted closer for a better look.</p><p>"No," he said. "Not like that. They don't hurt. And the scratches aren't real, see?" He grabbed her hand and moved it along his arm so she could feel it was smooth. "They show up once in a while and then disappear."</p><p>Andromeda looked at him carefully. "How long has this been happening?"</p><p>Sirius shrugged. "A little while. Since summer."</p><p>"I think these might be soulmate marks, Sirius."</p><p>Sirius's parents didn't think much of things like romance or love. He had learned about some types of magic that made his stomach squirm, but soulmates were one of those things he only ever heard whispers of.</p><p>While Regulus traced his fingers over the marks on Sirius's arm, Andromeda told him about the magic that connected soulmates. She said that for most people, the marks didn't show up until they were much older, but the idea was that any temporary mark on one of their bodies, like bruises or ink splatters, would appear in the same location on their soulmate's body.</p><p>"Can you keep a secret?" she asked. Sirius and Regulus nodded. "My marks started showing up this year. I was inside studying all day, but when I looked at my calves, they were splattered with mud, and I couldn't get it off."</p><p>"Do you know who it is?"</p><p>"Not yet. But I know we'll find each other. Soulmates always do."</p><p>"Why does it have to be secret?" asked Sirius.</p><p>"My parents have already decided who they want me to marry. If they find out I'm looking for my soulmate, they'll try to stop me."</p><p>Sirius nodded. "My parents would do the same."</p><p>Andromeda looked him in the eye. "Yes. That's why you have to keep this a secret." She looked at Regulus. "Both of you."</p><p>They nodded again. Sirius looked at Regulus out of the corner of his eye. Reg was only four, and Sirius wasn't positive he understood how to keep a secret. But, on the other hand, he barely talked, especially to adults.</p><p>"Andie," began Sirius cautiously. He wasn't positive he wanted to know the answer to his question. "Why does my soulmate have so many bruises so often?"</p><p>Sirius thought Andromeda might cry. "I don't know, love," she whispered, pulling Sirius close. "I'm sorry. You'll have to find out once you meet her."</p><p>--</p><p>When Sirius was 7, drawings started appearing along with the bruises. Sirius was especially impressed with one that made a large bruise look like a flame that a dragon was breathing.</p><p>He grinned, wondering why he hadn't thought of this possibility before. Each evening, he found himself sitting on the floor, pants rolled up, ink all over his hands. His favorite thing to do was turn the bruises into galaxies full of stars and planets. A couple times, a smiley face would appear next to one of his galaxies, so he made sure to draw them as much as possible. Once, his soulmate added to his drawing by turning the bruise into an eye, making the galaxy into its iris.</p><p>He knew that they could write to each other this way, but it seemed like cheating. He wanted his drawings to make his soulmate smile, but he didn't want to interfere with their journey. When he was 8, Andromeda whispered to him that she'd finally found her soulmate, and her whole face lit up. She had been hit with a Bludger during a Quidditch game, and the next time she went to score a goal, the Ravenclaw seeker had a bruise in the exact spot she'd been hit. According to her, she yelled for a timeout immediately and dragged him down to the ground so they could look in a mirror together.</p><p>A year later, nobody in his family would talk about Andromeda anymore. Sirius didn't dare ask questions, but he had seen her marriage announcement in the Prophet and knew her soulmate wasn't a pure-blood.</p><p>***</p><p>SIX YEARS LATER</p><p>“Ah, thank you so much for coming. Lyall, lovely to see you again. You remember Poppy?”</p><p>Remus watched the tall, gray-haired wizard shake hands with his father, barely noticing the witch dressed in nurse's robes in his wake. He gulped. Remus knew that this was Dumbledore, and he would be the one to decide whether or not Remus could attend Hogwarts.</p><p>“Dumbledore. I have to admit, we were intrigued by your owl. You remember my wife, Hope?” Dumbledore dipped his head to Remus's mother, who was clutching to his father. Remus was thrilled that she had insisted on joining them. She had never seen Hogwarts, and now they were seeing it for the first time together. “And this is Remus.”</p><p>All the adults turned to look at him. He tried to keep his eyes focused on the kind faces of his parents. He knew by now that people who knew what he was weren't usually very happy to meet him. But he couldn't help it. His eyes darted over to Dumbledore and the nurse, and he was amazed to find them both smiling at him.</p><p>“Remus,” said Dumbledore,  blue eyes boring into him. “Excellent. So glad to have you here. This is Madam Pomfrey, Hogwarts's matron.”</p><p>The witch smiled at him, bending down so she was almost his height.</p><p>“Hello, Remus. Looks like we're going to be spending a lot of time together over the next seven years.” She winked at him. Remus's heart skipped a beat. He hadn't let himself really start to believe that he could attend Hogwarts, not wanting to be disappointed. But Madam Pomfrey was talking as if it was a sure thing.</p><p>“Hello,” Remus muttered, trying to return her smile.</p><p>“Excellent. Now that introductions are out of the way, if you wouldn't mind following me?” said Dumbledore, turning to lead the way without waiting for their response.</p><p>Remus walked with Madam Pomfrey behind his parents, gaping at the moving staircases and portraits that they passed. He hardly paid attention to where they were going, but he supposed it didn't really matter; Hogwarts seemed to be a maze.</p><p>How am I ever going to find my classes? he wondered. If I can come, that is, he quickly added, not wanting to get his hopes up.</p><p>“Here we are,” said Dumbledore at last, stopping at a corridor on either sixth or seventh floor – the very concept of “floors” seemed somewhat ambiguous in the castle, as far as Remus could tell.</p><p>Dumbledore turned to address the group.</p><p>“As I said in my owl, I've spent a lot of time researching some of the secrets that Hogwarts holds. If my findings are correct, Remus should be able to open up a door right here to a room that will adjust to his needs and keep him safe during his transformations. According to the accounts I've been able to dig up, the room seems to develop favorites, and will only open for people it deems worthy, but it will provide for those it chooses in every way.”</p><p>Remus stared at the Headmaster and wondered if maybe the rumors were true, and he was a little crazy after all. They were standing in front of a stretch of blank wall.</p><p>“I'm confident it will open for you, Remus,” said Dumbledore, peering at him over his spectacles. “All you need to do is place your hand on the wall and think about what you need for your transformations.”</p><p>Remus looked to his parents, who nodded encouragingly. Half expecting all the adults to tell him this was just a joke at any moment, he walked up to the wall and laid his palm against it.</p><p>And immediately pulled his hand away when he could feel the wall touch him back.</p><p>That doesn't make sense, Remus corrected himself. I was touching the wall. It didn't move.</p><p>But he couldn't think of how else to explain his certainty that the wall had been investigating him just as much as he was it.</p><p>He took a deep breath and returned his hand, and again felt an undeniable presence emanating from the wall. He closed his eyes in concentration. Dumbledore had said to think about what he needed, so Remus tried to do that.</p><p>Uh, hello, he thought, because it seemed rude not to acknowledge whatever it was he was talking to. I need somewhere safe to go. Somewhere that can contain me.</p><p>An image flashed into his mind – just a room with a locked door. He smiled.</p><p>No, stronger than that. I'll be dangerous. He pictured the werewolf as best he could and pictured the cellar they'd secured at home for his transformations. After a moment, he also pictured the destruction after a full moon, thinking it was better for the room to know that up front.</p><p>A new picture started to swirl in his mind, based off his image of the cellar. Remus added to it, making sure the chains were at a good height, reinforcing the door, and getting rid of the blood stains – he didn't know how to explain to the room that those weren't in the cellar on purpose.</p><p>The image they were creating together shifted into sharper focus in his mind, and then faded. Remus opened his eyes.</p><p>In front of him was a steel door. He looked back at the adults, grinning, but saw only confused expressions in return.</p><p>“Ah,” said Dumbledore, after a minute. “Mr. Lupin, I believe you might have succeeded in making a room so secure that nobody but you can even see it.”</p><p>Remus whipped his head back around to make sure the door was still there. He sought his parents' eyes.</p><p>“None of you can see the door?”</p><p>His mom shook her head.</p><p>“Well, that's good, isn't it? That way we can be sure nobody else finds it,” mused Remus.</p><p>“Quite right. But I think it might be best if Madam Pomfrey is able to get in, in the mornings, so we can make sure you don't injure yourself,” said Dumbledore.</p><p>Remus turned back to the wall. He placed his hand directly on the door this time, trying to sense what the room would need to make this change.</p><p>“Madam Pomfrey, can you put your hand here too, please?”</p><p>Silently, the matron came to stand beside him, adding her palm above his.</p><p>She needs to be able to get in, Remus thought. But only when I'm a human in there. Remus pictured Madam Pomfrey joining him in his human form, and being locked out when he was a wolf. He felt the room adjust to this new understanding they'd created, and he heard Madam Pomfrey's soft gasp beside him.</p><p>He opened his eyes and smiled at her, knowing it had worked. He opened the door, and she followed him into the room.</p><p>It was exactly as he'd pictured it. A little bigger than the cellar. There were chains on the walls, but Remus thought they might not be necessary, as he examined the steel door and all the locks on it. There was no furniture to break, and there was a high shelf where he'd be able to put his wand and clothes before he changed. Satisfied, he led the way back out.</p><p>“Well?” asked Dumbledore.</p><p>Remus nodded.</p><p>“Albus, it's just a cage,” said Madam Pomfrey softly from behind him. Her tone surprised Remus. She sounded upset at this.</p><p>“It's safe,” he assured her. “We can use the chains if we need to, but the door is really heavy, and it locks in about a dozen different ways. The wolf won't be able to get out.”</p><p>His heart was pounding. He was so close to being able to come to Hogwarts, he needed to assure them it'd be okay.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey looked helplessly at Dumbledore.</p><p>“I have no doubt about the safety of the room,” Dumbledore assured Remus, regarding him thoughtfully. “And regardless, it seems like it has bonded to you. I imagine it will adjust, if your needs should change while you are here.”</p><p>His heart might very well burst from his chest at any moment.</p><p>“So, does that mean he can attend?” asked his father, and Remus was so grateful that he hadn't had to voice the question himself.</p><p>“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “We'd be honored to have Remus join us at Hogwarts this term.”</p>
