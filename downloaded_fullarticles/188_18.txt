    <p>Initially inspired by my own dislike of lavender and having someone douse my bed with lavender essential oils-Which I obviously loved. (I thought I would choke to death in my sleep on it)</p><p> </p><p>The scent of lavender filled the air, Hermione noted as she was awoken from sleep.</p><p>She hated the smell of lavender, she always had. It had always reminded her of moldy soap and the overwhelming smell threatened to make her vomit.</p><p>She opened the window to hopefully air out the room.</p><p>Today was her last day at the Burrow possible ever. Ginny had begged her to come and stay and she never could say no to Ginny.</p><p>But today was the day that wedding preparations would go into full effect and the happy couple would be arriving shortly, and married later this evening.</p><p>The dreaded wedding of Ron and Lavender.</p><p>She had her breakfast and helped Molly with many of the preparations before hightailing it to a hotel for a break and to check in.</p><p>It was lovely, crisp and clean and not a single bit of lavender smelling whatever.</p><p>Hermione checked in dropped her bag in the room and went down to the restaurant.</p><p>She read a little as she waited for her meal to arrive, reveling in the soft murmurs of the hotel, opposed to the thundering chaos she had just left.</p><p>“Mind if I join you?” A man startled her, mainly because she hadn’t expected to see<em> him</em>.</p><p>“By all means Malfoy.” They’d become very civil as he’d made a lot of amends and donations of time and money to various causes and had become respectable. Hermione wouldn’t say they were friends exactly but he wasn’t an enemy any longer.</p><p>“What brings you here?” He sat down easily.                                          </p><p>“Ron and Lavender’s wedding,” she tried to sound enthused. “I could ask you the same thing.”</p><p>“Conference which thankfully just ended.” Draco took a sip from his water, “Why aren’t you there helping with all the wedding frills and splendor?”</p><p>“Hmm,” She pretended to think it over. “I think that would have to be the bride.”</p><p>“You two don’t get on?” He asked.</p><p>“Never did. She always thought I was going to steal her Won Won,” Hermione mimicked the simpering tone Lavender used with that disgusting nickname. “Even after we left school she decided that I was eagerly trying to seduce him away from her.”</p><p>Draco chuckled. “Were you?”</p><p>“Nope, didn’t want to didn’t try. Maybe I should have just to mess with her.”</p><p>“Well, how down right Slytherin of you,” Draco’s smirk reminded her very much of the boy she’d met first year.</p><p>“Oh, she deserves it she teased me for years in school.”</p><p>“So you’re not jealous of the future Mrs. Weasel.”</p><p>“I’m not in love with him I got over that a long time ago but it just had to be <em>her.”</em> Hermione nearly sneered causing him to laugh.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen this side of you,” he regarded her.</p><p>“What side is that?” She asked lightly.</p><p>“This… I don’t know devious, sarcastic maybe,” He looked at her thoughtfully. “Complain about it some more you’ll feel better.”</p><p>Hermione jumped at the chance to release a little of what she’d been holding in for days. “I don’t get why Molly adores her, she was so mean to Fleur and Fleur is so kind and brave.”</p><p>“It’s probably because Lavender is more… shall we say common and less like a threat.”</p><p>“Fleur wasn’t threatening.”</p><p>“No but she’s foreign, extremely pretty, and a Tri wizard champion, that’s a lot to compete with. And she was the one to steal the first son away.”</p><p>“Never thought about her that way.” Hermione had a mischievous gleam in her eye “Tell me is that how your mother is going to be when you tie the knot?”</p><p>“Who knows, she will be one extreme or the other I’d assume.” He glanced away uncomfortably, “But go back to complaining about the bride to be.”</p><p>“I stayed a few days with Ginny to visit but the first thing this morning was lavender, the whole house started smelling of it and I hate it. That has nothing to do with her but she insisted it be hung everywhere, bouquets, wreaths, centerpieces, gift bags.”</p><p>“How original,” Draco commented dryly.</p><p>“The dresses are also lavender colored as are the flowers. She apparently tried to get Ron and Harry to wear lavender robes.”</p><p>“I would pay everything I have to see that.”</p><p>Hermione shrugged, “Sorry that’s the one thing they refused on.”</p><p>“Pity.”</p><p>“But I have to go to this because he is one of my friends, and my best girl friend is his sister who is also incidentally married to my other best friend. So if I ever want to leave my flat again I have to smile through this circus.”</p><p>Draco was silent for a moment. “Who are you taking with you?”</p><p>“No one I’m afraid. Ginny said she’d be my date as hers is the best man and will be busy. And every friend from school is invited and going with their girlfriends or wives, and one case of boyfriends.”</p><p>“I’ll go with you,” Draco said.</p><p>Hermione laughed, “How much have you had to drink?”</p><p>“I’m serious. For one we all have to work around each other and I’m on fairly good terms with most everyone.”</p><p>“Everyone except for Ron.” Hermione knew that Ron and Draco never got over their issues and while Draco usually behaved better in public with Ron, he was not above egging him on.</p><p>“Is that an issue?” Draco asked.</p><p>An almost evil smile crept across her face thinking of the possibilities. “Not necessarily.”</p><p>“And we’ve had a nice lunch so I think that we could continue this, besides who else can you tell whatever nasty thought you have about the wedding to?”</p><p>“I don’t know I’ll think about it.”</p><p>“Fair enough. I’m staying in room 215 if you need to find me.” Draco stood, pushing his chair in. “It’s been a pleasure.”</p><p> </p><p>She enjoyed being asked it was nice to have some attention other than ridiculous looks of sympathy that were completely unnecessary. They’d broken up like seven years before after a few weeks of dating; she was not pining after Ron.</p><p>“Excuse me, Miss Granger,” the waiter came up with letter.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“There was a note just sent for you.”</p><p>“Thank you.” She ripped the letter open. Only two people knew where she was.</p><p>
  <em>Hermione, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bring a date, I don’t care if you have to polyjuice the cat. Trust me on this. She’s parading around like you’re a spinster one minute then some whore trying to steal her fiancé. Bring anyone, seriously ANYONE.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love- Gin</em>
</p><p>“God I hate that woman.” Hermione didn’t care what anyone thought but she wasn’t going to be made into some pathetic ex. She’d worked too hard to establish a life and career based on her merits.</p><p>She went up to room 215 and knocked.</p><p>Her stomach was in knots when Draco opened the door and leaned against the frame. “Surprised to see you so soon. What can I do for you?” The look on his face said it all. She knew he knew he had her.</p><p>“We have to be at the wedding by five, will you still go with me?”</p><p>Draco smiled. “To see the look on Weasel’s face when you walk in with me, absolutely.”</p><p>“Right, I need to get ready.” She turned before going to her room. “And you know how you over dress sometimes? Do that.”</p><p>“What room are you in?” She didn’t answer him and walked into the room directly next to his.</p><p><em>Things could get very interesting,</em> He thought to himself.  </p>
