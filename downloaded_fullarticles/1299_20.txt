    <p>It was the end of Harry's third year, and he was trying to simultaneously enjoy his last days before returning to the Dursleys' and avoid a very angry Professor Snape (who was convinced—correctly—that he had helped his godfather escape). In pursuit of the latter goal, he had not-very-graciously ducked behind a rather large tree as Snape crossed the grounds, looking somehow even more furious than usual.</p><p>"Are you hiding from Sirius Black?" A serene voice asked him as she circled the tree. In front of him was a very strange girl with dark blonde hair down past her waist that covered half her face.</p><p>Harry sighed, irritated by the question and already weighed down by having to pretend that he didn't know of his godfather's innocence. "No, I'm not hiding from Sirius Black," he muttered, not making eye contact.</p><p>"Good. Sirius Black is actually a famous singer, you know."</p><p>Well, that was rather unexpected. "Sorry, what?"</p><p>"He's a famous singer, but he's been mixed up with whoever killed those muggles. His real name is Stubby Boardman. I almost never hear his songs on the radio anymore, probably because he's in hiding."</p><p>"That's probably why," Harry agreed, happy to be having a conversation with someone who didn't think of Sirius as a mass murderer, even if they were completely off.</p><p>The strange girl was quiet, staring past him. Harry turned around, but didn't see anything. "Is something behind me?" Harry asked, a bit unnerved.</p><p>"Just the thestrals."</p><p>"Oh," Harry responded politely.</p><p>"Can you see them?"</p><p>"Well, no, actually." The girl just nodded in response. "You know, Sirius Black—"</p><p>"Stubby Boardman."</p><p>"Right, Stubby Boardman. He's my godfather, you know."</p><p>The girl seemed to consider that for a moment. "Does he sing often?"</p><p>Harry smiled. "Yes. Yes, he does."</p><p>"I'm Harry Potter, by the way."</p><p>"I know." She was still staring past him.</p><p>"What's your name?"</p><p>"Luna Lovegood."</p>
<hr/><p>The evening before the Quidditch World Cup, Harry was with Ron and Hermione, looking at souvenirs. As he walked from one salesmen to another, he tripped over a huge mass and fell flat on his nose, shattering his glasses (again).</p><p>"Hey, mate, are you alright?" Ron asked as he helped him up. Hermione performed a quick <em>Reparo.</em></p><p>Harry looked down to see what he tripped over to see someone low to the ground as if they were crawling. The person had a mass of straight dark blonde hair that fell over her back and straight onto the ground. "Luna?"</p><p>Luna looked up very slowly; it seemed she hadn't even moved when Harry tripped over her. "Oh, hello, Harry. It's a nice day, isn't it?"</p><p>Hermione and Ron gave Harry a curious look. "Ron, Hermione, this is Luna Lovegood. Luna, this is Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger."</p><p>"Hello," Luna responded, her elbows and knees still firmly on the ground.</p><p>"You didn't notice when I tripped over you?" Harry couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"People have been tripping over me all day." Luna said without an ounce of spite in her voice.</p><p>"Look, I think some of the booths are closing soon…" Ron trailed off, giving Harry a can-we-get-away-from-this-crazy-girl look.</p><p>"I'll meet up with you in a second," Harry responded. "So what are you up to, Luna?" Harry asked after his friends hurriedly walked away, not without a few backward glances.</p><p>"I'm checking for moonwraiths."</p><p>"What is a moonwraith?" Harry asked, suppressing a chuckle.</p><p>"They are tiny creatures that follow around wizards, especially those with high athletic ability. Dad says we can probably find several here."</p><p>"What will you do when you find them?"</p><p>"Keep them in the tent until the campgrounds clear. It's very dangerous for them to be around too many people; they can make people angry."</p><p>"Any luck?"</p><p>"No," Luna said. "But we'll find them," she continued cheerfully. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>"I'm here to see the Quidditch Cup. I should probably get back to Ron and Hermione, actually."</p><p>"Alright, but be careful, Harry. People can do strange things around moonwraiths."</p><p>"I'll be careful, Luna. Don't get trampled, okay?" But she was already back to searching and either didn't hear him or ignored him.</p>
<hr/><p>The Quidditch World Cup didn't go as planned; in the mayhem of the Dark Mark being cast, Harry had rushed back to his bunk, but as he tried to go to sleep, all he could see was a strange blond girl, crawling on the ground, not noticing what was happening around her.</p><p>The next day, after returning to the Burrow, Harry penned a quick letter to Luna. For a fleeting moment, he worried that he didn't have her address, then shook the thought away as he remembered that such things weren't needed in the magical world. So he sent the short letter, confident that Hedwig would find her. All it said was:</p><p>
  <em>Luna,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm sure you heard what happened at the Quidditch Cup. Wanted to see if you were safe.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>-Harry Potter</em>
</p><p>He had just written "Harry" at first, but they had only met twice, after all, so he added his surname.</p><p>Harry, already prone to worry, was increasingly concerned as he hadn't heard from Luna in five days. He felt a flood of relief as Hedwig pecked him, and pulled the letter from her beak and removed a small box tied to her. He tried to read the letter, but Hedwig was desperate for a treat, so he gave her one first to stop the incessant pecking. "Sorry, Hedwig," he crooned as he opened the letter.</p><p>
  <em>Hi Harry,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm fine. We were in the tent and had rosemary and pixie wings for protection. I've attached some for you to use.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>-Luna</em>
</p><p>
  <em>P.S. Sorry for the delay. All our parchment disintegrated.</em>
</p><p>Harry laughed at the postscript and opened the box to find rosemary and wings that looked suspiciously like plastic.</p><p>"What are you those, mate?" Ron asked from behind him.</p><p>"Rosemary and pixie wings," Harry responded automatically.</p><p>"What?" Harry just chuckled to himself in response, and Ron shrugged and returned to his book on the <em>Chudley Cannons</em>.</p>
<hr/><p>Harry ran smack into Luna, knocking them and their books over. He had been rushing away from (another) unpleasant altercation with Ron, who, like nearly everyone else, thought he put his name in the Goblet of Fire. To make matters worse, as he looked up at Luna, she had a shiny "Support Cedric Diggory" badge on, pinned between a S.P.E.W. badge and one of the strange plastic wings she had given him.</p><p>"You, too?" Harry muttered.</p><p>"Me too, what?"</p><p>"You're wearing the badge," Harry responded wearily.</p><p>"Oh, look, I changed it," Luna said brightly. Harry looked closer and saw that instead of the normal "Support Cedric Diggory—the REAL Hogwarts Champion!", it instead simply read "Support Cedric Diggory—Hogwarts Champion!" Somehow Luna had stricken "The REAL" with crude burgundy lines that didn't glow as brightly as the red lettering. The effect from far away was that her badge just looked a little dark in some parts, but he appreciated the effort.</p><p>"And see," Luna continued, pressing her badge. Instead of "Potter Stinks", it read "Potter Sings" with the "t" and "k" crossed out, and a "g" written over the "k" with a bright blue lettering instead of the green of the rest of the badge.</p><p>"I sing?" Harry asked.</p><p>"I thought your godfather might have taught you. Do you like it?"</p><p>"I love it, Luna," Harry responded honestly.</p><p>She beamed and caught him off guard with a hug. He stiffened at first, and then returned it.</p>
<hr/><p>A couple months later, Harry and Ron were friends again, commiserating over their failure to find dates for the Yule Ball. Harry had been kicking himself for asking Cho, although Ron's rejection sounded worse, especially because Ginny wouldn't let up with him.</p><p>Ron suggested that Ginny go with Harry, which Harry thought would solve his problems easily, but even Ron's little sister had a date. And he had to open the dance!</p><p>"You know, mate, you should ask Looney Lovegood. I bet no one's asked her yet."</p><p>"Ron, her name's Luna," Ginny corrected sourly.</p><p>"I could ask Luna…" Harry responded slowly. He wasn't sure why he hadn't thought of it, but they wouldn't have a bad time. She might dress strangely, but who cares? "That's a really good idea, Ron."</p>
<hr/><p>The next day, Harry steeled himself to talk to Luna. Since they had no classes together, and he had no idea where she hung out—did she hang out anywhere?—he had to approach her in the Great Hall, which required him to walk to the Ravenclaw table.</p><p>Cho's friends started giggling as he made his way over; Cho was only sitting a few seats from Luna. One of her friends whispered in her ear, and Cho shot Harry an apologetic look.</p><p>"Er, Luna," Harry awkwardly greeted her from behind.</p><p>"Hi, Harry." Luna smelled strongly of thyme, probably because she had several of the herbs magically fastened in her hair.</p><p>"Could I talk with you for a minute?" Harry asked, suddenly nervous.</p><p>"Okay." Luna didn't move.</p><p>"I meant, well, somewhere more private?"</p><p>"Okay." Luna followed silently behind Harry until they ended up in the hallway outside the Great Hall, deserted because everyone was still eating.</p><p>"I was wondering if you would go to the ball with me?" Harry asked.</p><p>"What ball?"</p><p>"The Yule Ball."</p><p>"Oh. Well I was supposed to go with Dad to find Crumple-Horned Snorkacks."</p><p>"Well nevermind then—"</p><p>"But we'll go next year."</p><p>"You don't have to cancel," Harry said glumly, staring at his shoes.</p><p>But when he looked up from underneath his hair, Luna's face was covered in a wide smile. "I want to," she said simply.</p>
<hr/><p>Luna wore bright blue robes to the Yule Ball. For once, she didn't have anything in her hair, although she still wore it long and messy, rather like a mop, but a pretty mop.</p><p>"You look really nice, Luna."</p><p>"Thanks, Harry. You do, too."</p><p>Opening the dance was about as awkward as Harry expected; neither him nor Luna seemed to know what to do, so they just sort of swayed back and forth. After the first song was over, they both sat down.</p><p>A little while later, Luna went off to get punch, and Hermione plopped down next to him, breathless.</p><p>"You seem to be having a good time," Harry greeted her.</p><p>"I am. You seem to, too," Hermione said suggestively. "I couldn't help but laugh a little when I saw you and Luna."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Well, neither of you seem to be able to tame your hair," Hermione responded, giggling.</p>
<hr/><p>When Luna coughed after Harry pulled her out of the water, he breathed a sigh of relief. "Thank Merlin you're alright," Harry said, pulling Luna and Fleur's sister toward the edge of the lake.</p><p>Luna looked like she was still catching her breath, and when she finally opened her mouth to speak, Harry was almost knocked over by Fleur. When he turned back to talk with Luna, Madam Pomfrey was fussing over her and she was wrapped in a thick blanket.</p><p>After judging, Harry excused himself from Ron and Hermione and went to find Luna. She wasn't far, standing by herself with a big white blanket covering her and her wet hair wild.</p><p>"Luna! Are you okay?"</p><p>"Yes, I'm fine. I wish I could have seen under the lake, though. What was it like?"</p><p>Harry chuckled. "Kind of scary, really. The merpeople are vicious."</p><p>"How did you breathe underwater? Are you part sea creature?"</p><p>"Only for the hour I was. I used Gillyweed; I grew gills."</p><p>"What did they feel like?"</p><p>"Very itchy." Luna nodded knowingly.</p><p>"I wouldn't try it yourself, though," Harry added sternly, picturing Luna wandering into the lake to look for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks.</p><p>"Will you come with me?"</p><p>"Luna, it's really not safe." Luna didn't respond to that. "Luna?"</p><p>"Yes, Harry?"</p><p>"Please don't try to go into the lake."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"It's not safe. If you don't agree, I'm just going to worry about you."</p><p>She looked at Harry curiously, her big blue eyes opened even wider than normal. Her face was more visible than it normally was because the fresh water in her hair kept it slicked back from her pale face. Her nose was a bit large, but so were her eyes and mouth, making her look a bit exaggerated; it suited her.</p><p>"Promise you won't go in the lake?"</p><p>"You worry too much, Harry." Harry just looked at her, pushing some of her soaked hair behind her ear absentmindedly.</p><p>"Okay, I won't go in the lake—without you," she added, standing on her tiptoes and giving him a peck on the cheek. It left a tingling feeling behind that he hadn't gotten when Fleur did the same.</p>
