    <p>“Wait you want me to what?” Albus squinted at his best friend as he took a large sip of the rather cheap wine that was in his party cup.</p>
<p>“Rig Spin the bottle…come on! It’s not hard, it’s just one charm and then I can spend seven minutes in heaven making out with Hugo Weasley” Scorpius Grinned boyishly.</p>
<p>“How do you even know that’ll happen? This is my bachelor party...not some cheesy high school hook up night.”</p>
<p>Scorpius threw his hands up defensively. “Just because your marrying horse cock...doesn’t mean I can’t have a fun time” Scorpius pouted trying to guilt his best friend. The two of them had been inseparable since the start of Hogwarts, even losing their virginities together in a threesome they refuse to mention. Primarily because they’d forgotten who the third person was.</p>
<p>“Fine. If we end up playing Spin the Bottle...I’ll rig it...” Albus nodded adjusting the bride to be sash he’d been forced to wear. “And stop calling Frank Horse cock...he does not need that sort of ego boost...”</p>
<p>Scorpius chuckled amused. “There are way worse nicknames...”</p>
<p>“So Anyway...why Hugo? Don’t you like the freaky red heads?” Albus asked standing up, he knew Scorpius type almost as well as his own.</p>
<p>“I love them. But the rest of your cousins are meh...Hugo I dunno he interests me...” Scorpius said blushing. “There’s something about him...”</p>
<p>Albus raised an eyebrow and crossed his arms.</p>
<p>“He has a really big arse. Okay. I caught a glimpse when he walked in those skin-tight jeans....”</p>
<p>Albus laughed hard. “Yeah I guess he does...”</p>
<p>Their conversation was interrupted by the music suddenly cutting out and Rose standing on a chair waving an empty vodka bottle. “We’re going to play...<em>hic</em>...spin the bottle” she slurred drunkenly.</p>
<p>“See I told you...” Scorpius said standing up and brushing himself self-down. “Now I have a date with destiny...” he added dramatically.</p>
<p>Albus shook his head and followed Scorpius to where Rose was corralling mostly the single guests around in a circle.</p>
<p>“Not playing Cuz?” Hugo asked nudging Albus.</p>
<p>“Me?” Albus chuckled. “Merlin no. Frank will murder anyone game enough to try...you should though...”</p>
<p>“Eh it’s not really my thing...” Hugo shrugged.</p>
<p>“Scorpius is playing.” Albus added. Curiously seeing what kind of reaction that would get. Hugo’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“Is he? Maybe I will then...” Hugo said chugging the rest of his beer, his stomach bloating out a bit as he let out a belch. “I know this is the alcohol talking...but...I’ve had a crush on him for ages...It’s the blonde hair...” Hugo bit his lip.</p>
<p>Albus looked at him impressed. “Maybe you’ll get lucky...” Albus nudged. Hugo chuckled and grabbed another can of beer and cracked it open as he sat down in the circle.</p>
<p>“Soo whoever spins the bottle. Whichever way the top of the bottle points you must make out with them. Even if you’re a big Gaybo like Scorpius...” Rose said placing the bottle carefully in the centre.</p>
<p>“I’ll go first then?” Scorpius snapped back glaringly.</p>
<p>“Pfft sure. I want to see you be forced to snog a girl.” Rose said with a wicked smile.</p>
<p>Albus slipped out his wand and waved the charm as Scorpius span the bottle. Turning it with his wand and guiding to slow down doing slower circuits until it settled to face Hugo.</p>
<p>The rest of the circle laughed.</p>
<p>Scorpius went red, he hadn’t expected that reaction. Instead unfettered by the mocking, Hugo moved forward and Smiled.</p>
<p>The laughing stopped instantly. “Is Hugo Gay?” Someone muttered to Rose.</p>
<p>As Scorpius leant in and kissed Hugo’s lips, gently at first. In case he wasn’t into it, then Hugo’s tongue pushed into Scorpius mouth. As the two began to make out, not particularly caring that everyone was watching.</p>
<p>“Go make out somewhere else...” Rose said shoving her brother. Who broke the kiss and glared at her. Before turning to Scorpius and Practically pouncing on him. The tall blonde unable to stop grinning.</p>
<p>Albus smiled warmly as he watched them make out on the floor, the game resuming alongside them. Before they finally snuck off into one of the bedrooms. Albus phone dinged, he slipped it out onto his palm a text message at the centre from Frank.</p>
<p>“Hens night going well?”</p>
<p>“Mostly yeah, helped Scorpius and Hugo hook up. How’s the bucks party...”</p>
<p>“Ooohh! Well I’ve had more breasts in my face than I ever needed. And now James is insisting we streak through Diagon Alley.”</p>
<p>“Do not get Arrested!! Especially as it’ll probably be my dad who has to do it!” He texted back quickly.</p>
<p>“I make no promises that Dad will not Arrest your husband to be Al!”</p>
<p>“James! Don’t you Dare...”</p>
<p>Then a photo lit up, of his fiancé and his best friends all naked in alleyway. “I’m fucked...” Albus swore sighing.</p>
<p>Hugo pressed his swollen beer filled belly against Scorpius as they made out. Scorpius hands pushing into his jeans to grope Hugo’s ass. Hugo let out a moan at the way Scorpius was squeezing it. “You like that?” Scorpius said grinning between kisses.</p>
<p>“Uh huh...” Hugo moaned out his voice breathy and horny.</p>
<p>“What else do you like...” Scorpius said as he began to kiss Hugo’s neck sucking on the skin to make a hickey occasionally biting down experimentally.</p>
<p>“That...definitely Ohh that...” Hugo replied writhing.</p>
<p>Scorpius beamed. ‘This was going to be fun’</p>
<p>Hugo sat up and groaned his body was tired. He couldn’t remember how long he and Scorpius had gone at it. Other that it’d had been long and really really hot.</p>
<p>He looked over and saw light streaming into the curtains. Realising he was laying in James bed, he’d had sex in his cousins’ bed. The door opened, and Scorpius walked in carrying a tray of food. “How’s your butt cutie?” Scorpius asked brightly.</p>
<p>“Good?” Hugo said hesitant.</p>
<p>Scorpius placed the tray down in front of Hugo. A full English breakfast, poached eggs, hash browns and sausages. “Eat up...it’ll help any remaining hangover you might have.”</p>
<p>“Thanks...” Hugo smiled as he began to dig in. Scorpius sat behind him and started massaging his shoulders. “Where did you go?”</p>
<p>“To make you breakfast and go with Albus when he bailed out Frank and the others. They got arrested, Frank had nothing but a rubber horse mask covering his bits...” Scorpius sniggered grinning. “Did you enjoy last night?” Scorpius asked gently.</p>
<p>“So much...it all felt so good...” Hugo admitted his mouth full.</p>
<p>“You seemed to enjoy when I marked you. And was rough with you...” Scorpius asked watching Hugo’s reactions carefully as he thumbed the large hickey on his neck.</p>
<p>Hugo twitched a moan escaping when he ate. “Scorp...” he groaned feeling his cock harden.</p>
<p>Scorpius smiled and kissed the bruise. “Sorry. But you were very hot, all those moans...your so loud...”</p>
<p>Hugo’s cheeks went crimson. “Was that bad...”</p>
<p>“No. It wasn’t”</p>
<p>Hugo finished the breakfast and let out a hearty belch. Scorpius arm curling around his stomach thumbing his bellybutton. “I look pregnant...” Hugo whimpered in embarrassment. He knew whatever was happening with Scorpius had to be superficial.</p>
<p>“Maybe one day...” Scorpius commented. Hugo leant back against Scorpius pale muscled body.</p>
<p>Hugo’s eyes went wide. Scorpius shouldn’t have reacted like that, he was supposed to laugh and quickly exit. Not like the idea, Hugo’s mind raced trying to think of something that would prove Scorpius didn’t actually want him. Hugo’s eyes lit up maybe he’d just bring out weird Hugo, no one ever wanted him after that. “So, is true you have a dungeon?” Hugo asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Mostly for Storage and a bit of wine...” Scorpius answered warmly.</p>
<p>“Oh...” Hugo frowned.</p>
<p>“What kind of dungeon were you hoping for?” Scorpius asked chuckling as he kissed Hugo’s cheek.</p>
<p>Hugo chuckled nervously. “Like they have at some of the muggle gay saunas. With a sling and Restraints and things.”</p>
<p>“Oh, the sex dungeon is kept in the tower room, it’s close to my bedroom so the sex slaves can’t escape at night...” Scorpius Grinned matter of factly.</p>
<p>“What?” Hugo squeaked out.</p>
<p>Scorpius laughed. “I don’t have sex slaves. That was a joke.”</p>
<p>Hugo turned to Scorpius staring at him. “Why aren’t you weirded out by me?”</p>
<p>Scorpius raised an eyebrow. “I think your cute, the sex was great and I’m enjoying hanging out with you...is that bad?”</p>
<p>“No... it’s just new...” Hugo said truthfully.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a good thing?” Scorpius said kissing him.</p>
<p>“It is...” Hugo said melting into Scorpius arms.</p>
<p>When Hugo eventually did arrive home, he could hear his Mum and Dad chatting as he opened the door.</p>
<p>“Is that you Hugo?” Ron asked calling from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Yes Dad...” Hugo replied. Hoping he didn’t get a lecture.</p>
<p>Rose wandered past glass of water with an aspirin fizzing away in the glass. “Where did you disappear to? I thought you left early?”</p>
<p>“Nope...I just...crashed...” Hugo lied shifting.</p>
<p>Ron rounded the doorway from the kitchen and burst out laughing. “What’s that on your neck Hugo? Did you end using the patented Weasley Charm?”</p>
<p>Hugo startled and stared into the mirror and saw the Huge hickey. “Uhhh...” Hugo said trying to quickly come up with a response that would stop further questions being asked.</p>
<p>“Patented Weasley Charms? You might need your money back on those...” Hermione said offering Hugo a glass of water.</p>
<p>“No thanks mum. Sc... I had breakfast already...” He explained. “And the hickey is from a girl I hooked up with...” Hugo lied.</p>
<p>Ron grinned and nudged his son warmly. Patting him on the shoulder causing Hugo to tense from the other love bites under his jumper. “That’s my boy.” Rose also seemed satisfied clearly to intoxicated to remember anything that happened the previous night regarding his hook-up.</p>
<p>Hermione crossed her arms and watched Hugo.</p>
<p>Hugo went red, his mum always knew when he lied. “I’m not ready to talk about it yet...” he said quickly.</p>
<p>“As long as you used protection spells” Hermione reminded him.</p>
<p>“Yeses...” Hugo groaned. His mum knew he was gay, not that he’d actively confirmed it. It was more an unsaid acknowledgment, as Hugo wasn’t quite sure if he was ready to label himself yet.</p>
