  <em>The Dragon Pox Pandemic of 1918</em>
</p><p>.~.</p><p>Chapter 1:  Sacrifices</p><p>.~.</p><p>
  <em>October 1, 1918</em>
</p><p>As the Spanish flu was sweeping across the muggle world, the wizarding population was thankfully immune.  Unfortunately, Wizardkind was stricken with a different deadly global pandemic – Dragon Pox.  The effects were devastating.  St. Mungo’s and other hospitals were overwhelmed by the number of ill patients.  Healers were exhausted, and some were contracting the disease themselves.  The elderly were at risk the most, but some middle-aged wizards and witches had contracted and died from the disease.   The silver lining was that no children or teenagers had died, at least, as of yet.   </p><p>Albus Dumbledore had been dealing with the fallout at Hogwarts, which had become a haven for students from other wizarding schools like Durmstrang and Beauxbatons that were without staff, as some had fallen ill.   Thankfully the outbreak in Britain hadn’t been as severe as the rest of the world, but Albus knew it was only a matter of time before they caught up.  He and the other professors did their best to keep the children calm and occupied, but it was difficult.  As the headmaster had canceled classes, Albus had been holding dueling tournaments to give the students something fun to do.  </p><p>At present, Albus was taking lunch in his office, needing a few moments of peace and quiet.  After he finished his sandwich, the professor stretched and pushed his chair away from his desk, accidentally knocking off this morning’s paper.  After picking it up, he glanced at the <em>Daily Prophet </em>headlines.   <em>Death Toll Climbs Past 1,000.   Self-Quarantine Mandated by Ministry if Exposed.  Prominent MACUSA Auror Levi Goldstein and Wife Dead From Pox.   </em></p><p>Albus shivered as he digested that last disturbing headline.  Auror Goldstein had been healthy, with no preexisting conditions.  He’d been in his late-forties.  At thirty-six, Albus was not in the ‘at-risk’ category, which started at forty, but it still gave him pause. </p><p>In uncertain times like these, Albus desperately missed his life partner, who he hadn’t seen for a month, as he was fighting the good fight at the meeting of the International Confederation of Wizards in Paris.  They’d never been apart for that long, but Gellert insisted it was for the Greater Good of Wizardkind and Albus had to agree, as everyone was making sacrifices during these times.  He was very proud of Gellert for lobbying for more legislation and relief for those stricken with the disease and their families.  The Supreme Mugwump and his supporters were hesitant to give even more monetary aid, preferring to put more of their resources into concealing Wizardkind from the muggles, but if anyone could convince them to change their mind, it was Gellert.  One time he’d even convinced straight-laced Albus to have sex with the door to their flat unlocked just for the thrill. </p><p>Of course, the world believed that Albus and Gellert were simply good friends and roommates, but they’d been in a long term relationship since the summer of 1899.  Thanks to Bathilda Bagshot’s matchmaking tendencies, Gellert and Albus never stood a chance of not getting together.  Albus thought back to that summer when they first met, how everything was brand new.   Albus appreciated knowing Gellert inside and out, but there were times when he did miss the thrill of courting.  When they’d first met, he learned new things about Gellert every day that fascinated him.  He’d been head over heels for the German boy who’d moved in down the street.  It had been the best day of his life when Gellert had said he returned Albus’ amorous feelings.</p><p><em>Tap Tap Tap.</em>  Startled, Albus jumped when he heard a noise outside his window.  He quickly found the culprit – it was his owl, who was carrying a letter.  He brightened, knowing just who was writing him.  He opened the window and his owl chirped happily.  After removing its burden, Albus gave the owl a treat and tore open the letter.  He immediately recognized Gellert’s neat scrawl.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Albus,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bathilda has it.  She’s dying.  Meet me at our grave tonight at 9 o’clock.  Bring a mask.</em>
</p><p>

  <em> </em>
</p><p><em>Shit.  </em>Albus didn’t think he should leave the school for any reason, but Bathilda Bagshot was very dear to Gellert.  He couldn’t leave his life partner to deal with this alone.  The students were in bed at nine, anyway.   He might be able to sneak in and sneak out without anyone being the wiser.   However, he wasn’t sure why Gellert wanted him to bring a mask. </p><p>The Wizarding Health Organization had issued masks with a special shield charm that would protect the wearer against the pox.  Unfortunately, over time, the charm wore off and it wasn’t as effective.  Also unfortunately, the charm was difficult to master.   However, Albus was an extremely gifted wizard and he’d been spending several hours of his day transfiguring masks and adding the protective charms.  Thanks to his efforts, St. Mungo’s had more than enough masks to go around.  It would not difficult to do as Gellert asked.</p><p>As the day crawled by, Albus had trouble completely focusing on his students.   He’d known the pox outbreak was serious, but it hadn’t affected him personally until now.  It was starting to sink in just how severe this outbreak could be.   The worst part was not knowing.  Not knowing how many people were infected, not knowing how quickly it would spread, not knowing who would live and who would die.   Knowing that the students would take their cues from him, Albus put on a cheerful front and acted as normally as possible.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>.~.</p><p>Nine o’clock eventually rolled around.  Albus didn’t know what kind of shape he would find Gellert in, but he promised himself to do his best to care for Gellert’s emotional needs.  After sneaking out of the school and passing through the protective wards and enchantments, Albus apparated with the mask to Godric’s Hollow, specifically near St. Mark’s, the Catholic church near the center of the village.  He hadn’t visited his former home in a year, not since Aberforth moved to Hogsmeade.   As night had fallen, Albus cast ‘lumos’ along with a disillusionment charm so he wouldn’t be noticed.  </p><p>He noticed blurry shape was moving next to the Peverell Grave.   Albus moved closer, holding his wand in front of him to light the way.   Gellert’s handsome face appeared out of the darkness and Albus was flooded with a sense of relief.</p><p>“Albus!”  Gellert held out his arms.  “Liebling, I’ve missed you.” </p><p>Albus quickly closed the distance between them.  He set the mask aside on the Peverell grave on top of the familiar triangular symbol.  “Gell!  Merlin, it’s been too long.” They fell into each others’ arms and held each other tightly.   Albus quickly cast a concealment charm just in case before pulling Gellert in for a kiss.  He entangled his fingers in Gellert’s golden locks and gently massaged his scalp.   Gellert eventually broke the kiss and rested his forehead against Albus’.   They stayed like that for a few minutes, their breaths intermingling.   Then Gellert pulled away.</p><p>“Hello, darling.  Are you alright?” Albus asked softly, looking deeply into Gellert’s mismatched eyes. </p><p>Gellert’s defeated expression told Albus all he needed to know.  “It’s hard getting through this without you at my side.  We usually see each other every weekend, but now…”  Gellert trailed off.  “I don’t know how bad it’s going to get.  I’m worried, Albie.  Especially now with Bathilda infected.  She owled the Ministry and someone thought to inform me, her next of kin.  It’s bad, Albus.  It’s possible she might not live for more than a few days.  She chose to self-quarantine instead of adding to the number of cases in St. Mungo’s.”  </p><p>Albus blew out a long breath.  “Fuck.” </p><p>A haunted look appeared in Gellert’s eyes.  “Yeah.  Makes it seem more real, doesn’t it?”</p><p>Albus nodded.   “Not that I’m complaining, but why did you ask to meet here tonight?  For comfort?”</p><p>Gellert’s voice dropped almost to a whisper.  “I asked you here because I want to get your permission to see Bathilda.”</p><p>“In person?” Albus frowned.  “But we can’t.  She’s in quarantine.”</p><p>“Albus, we owe her for bringing us together,” Gellert insisted.</p><p>“But there’s nothing we can do to help her,” Albus reminded him.  “We’d just be risking exposing ourselves if we went to visit.”</p><p>Any other time, Gellert would’ve made a sexual innuendo, but these weren’t normal days.  “I wouldn’t risk that just for a simple visit.  I…I think I can heal her.”</p><p>Albus raised an eyebrow.  “Gell, you can heal wounds, not diseases.   Is that even possible?”</p><p>“An ancient Egyptian wizarding technique says it is,” Gellert informed him.  “I’ve been researching different ways how to advance my natural healing gift, but I haven’t had an opportunity to try it out on someone as I’ve been afraid I might accidentally harm them.  But with Bathilda, it’s different.  This technique very well may save her life.”  Gellert gave Albus a pleading look.  “I have to try.”</p><p>Naturally, Albus’ first question was, “Will you be putting yourself at risk?”</p><p>Gellert shrugged.  “I don’t think so.”</p><p>“That’s not good enough for me, Gellert,” Albus said sternly.  “Bathilda wouldn’t want you to put your life at risk for her and neither would I.”</p><p>“Albus, the book never said anything about the healer being at risk.   I should be fine,” Gellert claimed.</p><p>But Albus wasn’t convinced.  “Hmm.  If this healing technique is so effective, why did it fall out of favor?”</p><p>“It takes great skill, and most people aren’t born with innate healing abilities like I have,” Gellert explained.  “The technique was lost over the centuries, and although this ancient book has recently resurfaced, as of yet, no one has been brave enough to try it.” </p><p>“I don’t know, Gell.”  Albus reached for his hand.  “I don’t want to risk losing you.” </p><p>“I know.”  Gellert swallowed hard as he interlaced their fingers.  “I don’t want you to lose me either, but I think there is only a very minuscule chance of that.  Albus, you know that most wizards live well into their hundreds.  Bathilda could live to the end of the century.  Think of all the quality books that she will write.  It would be doing the Wizarding World a disservice if I just let her die.”</p><p>“Bullshit,” Albus whispered softly.  “Come on, Gell.  Tell the truth.  It’s just me.”</p><p>“Fine!  I can’t lose her, alright?”  Gellert’s hands started to tremble as his voice picked up an inflection.   “Besides you, she’s all I have in this world.  But I won’t visit her if you tell me not to.”</p><p>Albus sighed.  “So that’s why you asked me to bring a mask.  I should’ve known.”  Albus did his best to quickly weigh the risks versus the benefits.   Then he realized that if Bathilda died, Gellert would hold himself responsible for the rest of his life.  He didn’t want to be responsible for saddling Gellert with that guilt.  Gellert wasn’t stupid.  If Gellert said there was a minimum risk, there was a minimum risk.</p><p>“I can’t tell you not to visit.”  Albus nodded at his life partner.  “If you want to try and heal her, I won’t try to stop you.”</p><p>Gellert’s shoulders slumped in relief.  “Thank you, darling.”  Gellert pulled him in for a long kiss.  “I’m going to go see her tonight.  You should go back to Hogwarts.”</p><p>Albus looked taken aback.  “Excuse me?”</p><p>“You don’t have a mask.  You could be at risk.  Albus, please, don’t come.”  Gellert gave him a pleading look.  “I need to know that you’ll be alright.”</p><p>“No, I’m not letting you go alone,” Albus said fiercely.  “Where you go, I go.  Besides, you know as well as I do that I can make myself a mask.”</p><p>“Alright,” Gellert quickly conceded.   He gave Albus a sheepish smile.  “I didn’t really want to go alone anyway.”</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes.  “You must’ve known I wouldn’t have taken your out.”</p><p>“I didn’t think so, but I wanted to give you the option.”</p><p>Albus shook his head.    “I’m going with you, end of story.”</p><p>.~.</p><p>After Albus transfigured a rock into a mask and added the shield charm, they headed to Bathilda’s home. </p><p>Gellert led them to Bathilda’s front door.  He was very fond of this house, which had served as a home for him that terrible year he’d been wrongfully expelled.  Albus followed closely behind him.  Gellert knocked at the door, hoping Bathilda would answer. </p><p>“Who is it?”  Bathilda’s hoarse voice was muffled through the door.</p><p>“It’s Gellert and Albus,” Gellert called.  “We’ve come to check on you.”</p><p>“I’ve got it.  You can’t come in.  I forbid it.”  Even as sick as she was, Bathilda sounded rather formidable.</p><p>Albus and Gellert just glanced at each other and raised their eyebrows.  After putting their masks on, they quickly apparated to Bathilda’s parlor.  They were quite familiar with it, as they’d spent many hours in the summer of 1899 conducting research in her grand library and making love on the rather inviting couch when she’d been out of the house.</p><p>“I told you not to come.”  Bathilda glared at them from the couch.  She was covered in a mountain of blankets but she was still shivering.  Albus assumed she had a fever and chills.  “You shouldn’t be putting yourselves at risk.”</p><p>“We’re wearing masks.  Albus charmed them himself.  We’re protected,” Gellert assured her. </p><p>“Stupid boy.”  Bathilda coughed and the sound rattled in her chest.   “You never listen.”</p><p>“I’m thirty-five, Auntie, thank you very much,” Gellert reminded her.  “I do what I please.  I haven’t been a boy for a long time.”</p><p>“I know.”  Bathilda’s expression softened as her cough died down.  “But you’ll always be the boy that I took in, at least to me.”</p><p>As they talked, Albus took in Bathilda’s appearance.   Her skin had a green tinge and her face was marred with pockmarks.  Then she sneezed and a few sparks flew out of her nose, but she caught them before they hit the blankets.   </p><p>“I have to use a wet rag to cover my sneezes. It’s very odd having bits of fire coming out of your nose.  I can’t smell anything anymore.”  Bathilda coughed again.  “Why have you come?  To say goodbye?”</p><p>Gellert shook his head.  “No.  I’m not going to let you die.  I want to try to heal you.” </p><p>“But the healers don’t even have a cure.”  Bathilda sounded bewildered.  Then she sneezed again.  “How could you heal me?”</p><p>“I’ve been studying up on ancient Egyptian wizarding healing techniques,” Gellert clarified.  “If I can vanish most of the infected cells one by one, it’s possible that your body can make a recovery.”</p><p>“Is there a risk that you could catch the pox from me by using this technique?”  Bathilda asked, frowning at her great-nephew.  “Because if so, I won’t do it.”</p><p>“I don’t believe so.” Gellert smiled reassuringly at her.  “If it works as the book theorized, I’ll be transmuting the disease back into the earth, which will naturally dissolve it.  I’ll be fine.  It may be unconventional, but I think it’s worth a shot.  And if it works, this technique can be used to help others fight the disease.”  </p><p>“Albus, what do you think?”  Bathilda looked at the young professor.  “If Gellert died and left you alone, I would never forgive myself.”</p><p>“If Gellert says the risk to him is negligible, then I think he should be allowed to try,” said Albus. </p><p>“Hmm.”  Bathilda pursed her lips.  “I suppose it couldn’t hurt.  As long as you think it's safe.”</p><p>“Excellent!”  Gellert beamed at her.  “You won’t be sorry.”</p><p>“What do you need me to… achoo!”  Bathilda barely caught her sneeze in time, preventing sparks from catching Gellert’s robe on fire. </p><p>“You can stay where you are and relax, as best as you can.  I just need to touch your bare skin.  If I can touch your chest, it would be best so I can start working on your lungs immediately.  I know it’s awkward, but-”</p><p>“Not to worry, dear.”  Bathilda covered up with the blanket and adjusted her robes so that Gellert could access her chest.  “How long will this take?”</p><p>“It will be a long procedure,” Gellert informed her as he settled down on the couch next to Bathilda.  “It will most likely take hours.”</p><p>“Very well.   I’ll put myself in your capable hands.  I really appreciate it, Gellert, even if it doesn’t work.”  Bathilda smiled gratefully at Gellert.  “I might fall asleep.  Is that alright?”</p><p>“Perfectly fine,” Gellert assured her as he placed his left hand gently on Bathilda’s chest under the blanket, trying to avoid her breasts.  “You might feel a gentle tingling sensation, so don’t be alarmed.”</p><p>“Gell, is there anything I can do?”  Albus asked.</p><p>Gellert shook his head.  “I’ll have to really concentrate so I won’t be talking to you during the procedure.  Settle in with a good book, Albus, and try not to worry.”</p><p>“Easier said than done,” said Albus.   He leaned in and gave Gellert a quick peck on the lips.  “I’ll be in my favorite armchair.  Tell me if you need me.”   He and Gellert exchanged a heated glance that spoke volumes of I love you’s.   Then Gellert closed his eyes.  He took a deep breath and let it out slowly.  His breathing evened out and it seemed to Albus that he was closing his eyes and relaxing, as Gellert often did after a hard day of work.     </p><p>Sighing, Albus picked through Bathilda’s library.  Every few minutes, he looked over at Gellert, who still had his eyes tightly closed.  There was no change.   Bathilda coughed a few times, but that soon stopped.  Both Gellert and Bathilda looked completely at peace.  If it were any other circumstance, the sight would’ve warmed Albus’ heart.  Bathilda started to lightly snore, which Albus took as a good sign as at least she wasn’t coughing.  He finally decided on a book on ancient Transfiguration theory and dove in, preparing for a long wait. </p><p>.~.</p><p>Three hours later, Albus was starting to doze.  His book lay next to him on the couch, untouched for the past thirty minutes.  The clock chimed twelve times, causing Albus to jump.  Bathilda too was startled awake.  Her eyes flew open, but to her credit, she didn’t move.   Gellert’s eyes remained closed but they fluttered as if he were in a trance.</p><p>“How do you feel?”  Albus whispered.  “Any change?”</p><p>Bathilda took a deep breath.  But instead of it catching in her throat, she breathed normally.  “I-I feel better.”  Bathilda smiled.  “I think the technique worked!  Should you bring him back?”</p><p>“I think so,” said Albus.  “If he’s not finished, he at least needs to take a little break.”  Albus approached the couch and gently touched Gellert’s shoulder.  “Gell, did you hear that?  You did it!  Your aunt feels better and she can breathe more easily now.”</p><p>Gellert didn’t respond.</p><p>“Gellert?”  Albus shook his life partner’s shoulder.  “I think you can stop now.  Look at me, love.”</p><p>Gellert’s eyes opened briefly, but they were unfocused.  He managed to remove his hand from Bathilda’s chest before he fell back on the couch in a dead faint. </p><p>Terror gripped Albus as he noticed that Gellert’s face was tinged green.</p><p>.~.</p><p>End Chapter 1</p><p> </p>
