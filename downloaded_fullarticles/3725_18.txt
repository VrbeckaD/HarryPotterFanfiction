</p><hr/><p>Hermione was enjoying her peace and quiet in the common room until a page from the book she had been reading tore a bit at the edges as she was turning it.</p><p>
  <em>Shite.</em>
</p><p>There were barely any students in Hogwarts since the school was still undergoing repairs. The noisy Gryffindor common room was pleasantly quiet as the brunette sat alone and in peace with her hobby.</p><p>Hermione's mind drifted off to thoughts about her parents. She would have tried to look for her parents right after the Wizarding War, but it would have been futile. There was still no possible way to fix the Obliviate she had placed them under. Contrary to the rumors, there is still no counter curse to a full Obliviate.</p><p>The witch muttered a spell to fix the slight tear at the edge of the page and continued to read, but as she turned the next page, it tore again.</p><p><em>Shite! </em>She tensed, recognizing this as a bad omen. Not that she believed in such things.</p><p>After the common room had been repaired, it was mostly empty due to most furniture being destroyed. The brunette took it upon herself and began adding furniture taken from the Room of Requirement. The room that was engulfed by Fiendfyre was repaired, by what means, she had no idea. She also added a bookshelf.</p><p>Several months had passed since the Second Wizarding War. Hermione was the only one out of the Golden Trio to return to Hogwarts to take her N.E.W.T.s. It was somewhat lonely, but she could manage it. Some students had opted to stay and help repairs, but those that Hermione personally knew had not chosen to return yet. The horrors and fear experienced within the halls of Hogwarts were not easy to forget.</p><p>Both Harry and Ron had decided to skip going back to Hogwarts in favor of Auror training. The two boys did not need to take their N.E.W.T.s anymore since Kingsley Shacklebolt had given them their recommendations. Many wanted to protest, emphasizing the importance of the tests and trials for Auror training, but none openly went against the newly-elected Minister of Magic. Being a young war veteran that had direct involvement in destroying Voldemort had to earn them some points. Hermione was appalled at the reasoning, but the other two just waved her off.</p><p>Even with all the death and destruction that happened at Hogwarts, the relief of finally having a time of peace encouraged many to help rebuild the school. Hermione had also decided to retake her seventh year in Hogwarts even after taking her N.E.W.T.s. Both Harry and Ron were surprised at the decision, but Professor McGonagall expressed her delight at Hermione returning.</p><p>Although the professor was delighted at Hermione's decision, there was still a lot of rebuilding needed before classes could resume. Funerals had to be set up for those that passed in the war. Fred Weasley, Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin were just among the few that died that day.</p><p>The peace and quiet the Gryffindor girl was experiencing was sadly short-lived. One thing that continued to occur during the past several months of mourning and rebuilding was Ron Weasley trying to <em>court</em> Hermione Granger, to little success. It might be closer to <em>no success </em>at all<em>.</em> The boy just couldn't a hint.</p><p>The redhead quickly entered the room and went towards the annoyed witch's side by the sofa. She knew it, those <em>bloody</em> omens.</p><p>"Oh come on, 'Mione! I've been asking you out for several months now! I'm going to be a full blown Auror soon!" he wailed. Ron Weasley hadn't changed at all since the first year of Hogwarts. The red-haired male had always been a mix of whiny and arrogant. His voice soon began grating on her nerves.</p><p>The brunette did not even take her eyes off the book. 'Wandless Magic: A Prelude' was infinitely more interesting than the bumbling ginger goof that stood in front of her. Why had she liked this <em>boy</em> again? She shook her head, blaming it on teenage hormones. Thank Merlin it passed.</p><p>"For the last time, Ron. I have no time for this. I'm busy." For the first few months<em>, </em>Ron had always recognized the sharp tone of Hermione's voice that meant he was dismissed, but now? She sighed.</p><p>"But 'Mione! Come on! I know you've liked me since forever! You have a chance to be with this!" He gestured widely towards his body, "Ron Weasley, Auror-to-be and Hero of the Wizarding War!" Stick thin and lanky.</p><p>All Hermione wanted was some peace and quiet, but now she was considering using her three-inch thick book to smack the idiots head off. But no, the poor book did nothing to deserve that fate. It was possible for the book to magically transfer knowledge through direct contact, that was a thing right? Temptation!</p><p>Hermione was just about to respond when Ron slid in beside her. She knew she should have sat in the armchair and not the sofa.</p><p>"Personal space, Ronald!" She snapped. She shot a glare at Ron, a look bordering on hatred stemming from months of exasperation. He did not heed the girl's warnings and, instead, inched closer. It seemed as if he thought she was playing hard to get or some stupid dribble his infant mind had conjured.</p><p>Ron's face began to morph into some kind of-wait. Was he trying to kiss her<em>? </em>Oh bloody Morgana, save her! Before Hermione could close the book and slam it over the idiot's head, he closed it for her and placed his hand firmly on her upper thigh.</p><p>Instant outrage filled the Gryffindor. No one was allowed to touch her without her permission. Before the infuriating twit could continue, she pushed him right off the sofa onto the floor. <em>This prat!</em></p><p>"What the <em>fuck</em>, Hermione?!" Ron yelled, his face contorting with confusion and anger. "I don't understand why you're playing so hard to get! Didn't I do enough to win you over?" She didn't even know what he meant. What had Ron done for her other than complicate the war?</p><p>Hermione's eyes narrowed in rage. "You egotistical arse! How dare you say that to me! I'm not just a bloody prize to win!"</p><p>"I've given you long enough Hermione. I didn't break up with Lavender just to get nothing. Come on!" Was Ron really saying this? Was this the dreaded foot-in-mouth syndrome?</p><p>"You'll be waiting a longer time then." Hermione voice was cold. She was slowly calming down.</p><p>"You're acting like one of those crazy muggles, Hermione! For Merlin's sake, be reasonable!" His hands clenched into fists. Ron moved forward and grabbed Hermione by her shoulders, a move she did not appreciate.</p><p>Hermione flinched. She looked around and took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down as he continued talking. The room was still empty since classes hadn't officially started so calling for help might not be prudent. The brunette wanted to hex the boy back to the burrow he spawned from, but as his best friend, she should be understanding. The girl tried to ignore the insults the idiot was throwing out. Understanding, Hermione. Understanding.</p><p>"I'm glad I'm getting you all hot and bothered. Looks like all you need is a bit of rough handling." Ron grinned as he looked into her eyes, his hands grazing down her arms. He seemed to be speaking without thinking of anything at all. "You're shaking like a leaf for me." Understanding? <em>I'll make him bloody understand!</em></p><p>Hermione raised her wand. "STUPEFY!" she yelled, a point blank shot hitting Ron Weasley in the chest, accelerating him straight into the bookshelf. She enjoyed the stunned look on the weasel's face just before a thick tome fell on his head, completely knocking him out.</p><p>The smartest girl of her age sighed as the adrenaline from her retaliation began to die down. She hoped the book wasn't damaged. She strode forward and knelt by Ron, picking up the book that had given the finishing. <em>Death and his Dementors.</em> Huh, she didn't remember having that in her collection. In any case, she needed to clean up this pile of rubbish before it started moving again.</p><p>"Expecto Patronum!" An ethereal otter appeared and began to lovingly rub its head on Hermione's leg. She smiled at her cute and adorable Patronus before beginning her message.</p><p>"Harry! You better get over here before I call the Aurors to haul Ron's bloody arse out!" The witch sighed as her Patronus left to deliver the message. She estimated that Ron would be out for another hour or so. Harry would probably get there soon. At least she could finally continue her book in relative peace. She was slightly tempted to shoot another spell in all truth.</p><p>She glanced around. There weren't any people anyway.</p><p>"Supefy!" See? Much better. Ron probably understood his lesson. If not, third time's the charm.</p><hr/><p>A week passed since the altercation with Ron. Hermione was having a quick lunch with Harry at the scarcely populated Great Hall. Harry had answered Hermione's Patronus post-haste, but did not have much time to talk about it at the time.</p><p>"Molly was not happy when I apparated with an unconscious drooling Ron." Harry had barely changed from the war, hair a bit longer, but still the same overall.</p><p>"I told you Harry, Ron was beginning to get physical. What did you want me to do? Allow him to manhandle me?" The witch huffed taking another swig of the pumpkin juice. Looks like it was a bit harder to convince Harry Potter that his best mate had been hounding her for months.</p><p>Harry frowned. He knew that Ron had been pestering Hermione for a relationship for a while now, but did not realize it had gotten this severe. He thought that Hermione and Ron would have gotten together right after the war, but it seems the need for affection was just post-battle need of affection. Looks like the kiss the two shared would be the last.</p><p>"It's just hard to believe that the Golden Trio, who have been friends for years are starting to split all of a sudden."</p><p>"Harry, you know you're like a brother to me, but I can't fake it. I may have had a tiny crush on Ron before, but that was just a school girl crush and nothing more. Both of you were the closest friends I've had. I'll even admit I had a small crush on you too. Don't tell Ginny!" Hermione narrowed her eyes, but Harry knew she was just jesting. She also had a crush on Ginny too, but he didn't need to know that. There was a tiny one on Gabriella too, but no one needed to know that one either.</p><p>"I think we all had small crushes on each other at one point in time. I'm just happy that Ginny and I are finally together." Harry looked solemn for a second and thought on the Weasley's reaction to this development. The fall out could be catastrophic depending on what Ron will feed them.</p><p>Harry shook his head of all the possibilities lost. "Everyone will be so disappointed that you aren't getting together with Ron though." He did hope that Hermione and Ron would get over this stage. He'd need to give Ron a stern talking to right after this. She could see the clock turn in Harry's head realizing that his red haired friend was not <em>slowly courting </em>her.</p><p>"Enough about him. How goes the search for the leftover Death Eaters?" Hermione did not hear much news of the outside world. The witch was busy with her research and rebuilding of Hogwarts, but having Death Eaters still roaming free out there was an important issue.</p><p>Harry explained how there were still a lot of Death Eaters that were missing. Only a few had died during the war since Voldemort's demise had them all fleeing.</p><p>The brunette was actually surprised at the action of the Death Eaters after Voldemort had fallen. With the sheer amount of their dark forces, there was no way the Order was actually going to win if the assault continued. Thankfully the only true leaders of the other side were Voldemort and his lieutenant Bellatrix Lestrange. She had also thought that Bellatrix Lestrange would cause much more death and damage, but dying to Molly? It did not add up. A world renowned and feared duelist losing to house wife? Unlikely. Though it did happen, which was surprising.</p><p>"The press is going to have a field day with this you know? Rita Skeeter is going to twist this story so badly against you. She really detests you for some reason." Harry knew Rita Skeeter was an Animagus, but it seemed as if the reporter was solely focused on tarnishing Hermione's name. The brunette just gave a small chuckle and resumed eating. What was Ron going to do? Leak to the press? That she had used point blank Stupefy to spurn his advances? If anything the Stupefy was a tad too light of a punishment from several months of hounding.</p><p>Hermione felt content. This was how it was supposed to be. Peaceful banter with a side of laughing. It should have been the three of them here, but they would take what they could get. Hermione was just about to finish eating when the Great Hall doors slammed open.</p><p>A group of three Aurors entered and went straight for Hermione. Hermione already had an inkling on what had happened, but the boy-who-lived looked confused. Looks like she had guessed wrong about the steps Ron would be taking. The Stupefy had been too light of a punishment indeed.</p><p>"Hermione Granger. You are under arrest for the assault of Ronald Weasley. I'm sorry, but you will have to come with us." The lead Auror had a look on his face that he really did not want to be doing this, but had no choice. There was no point in resisting arrest or trying to explain herself now. The logical part of Hermione's brain knew that she needed to be patient and just go along with them. The illogical part wanted to run and send a bludger all the way up that weasel's arse.</p><p>Apparently, Harry didn't share the same opinion. "You can't take her in for assault! It was already deemed self-defense a week ago!" Oh, Harry, still so naive, but Hermione knew she was naive for believing that Ron would take this spurn from her laying down.</p><p>The Aurors began to placate Harry, just enough to cajole him into accompanying them to the Ministry of Magic where the Auror department was located. Harry had protested when anti-magic shackles were placed on Hermione's wrists, but the brunette just shook her head.</p><p>Luckily, McGonagall wasn't there or spells might have been slung around before even allowing Hermione to leave.</p><hr/><p>Three hours had passed and Hermione grieved. She should have brought a book! All this waiting in this blasted waiting room was a waste of time. At least she wasn't placed in a cell and those horrid shackles were off. There were some comforts, but the witch was sad at the time being burned up doing nothing.</p><p>The bright witch absentmindedly flicked the Time-Turner she wore around her neck. The last <em>working</em> Time-Turner was around Hermione Granger's neck, charmed of course. The Time Room had been destroyed during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and none of the Time-Turners were usable anymore. She contemplated on reversing time, but she could not reverse one whole week to undo cursing the foolish redheaded bugger. She fondly wondered if she <em>should reverse time to throw two spells instead of just one extra. </em>She was very tempted.</p><p>The door finally creaked after Hermione's patience was nearly exhausted. The witch had not expected to see Ron by the door with a smirk on his face. Adrenaline started to flow, her hand had quickly gone for her wand, but she cursed as she realized the lead Auror had taken it.</p><p>"Ah, ah, ah! No wand for my rebellious girlfriend this time." Ron smirk widened as he closed the door behind him. The room was soundproof and only contained two chairs and one table.</p><p>"What do you want Ronald?" It was obvious to Hermione how Ron had gotten in. The bigot most likely knew who the Auror guarding the room was. The Auror guarding the room was also most likely a misogynistic pureblood as well.</p><p>
  <em>Bloody Hell.</em>
</p><p>Hermione stood up from the chair she was seated in and slowly moved back. The girl tried to put as much distance as she could between them. Ron would mostly try to manhandle her again, before even thinking of using a spell. How badly she wanted to beat him with a beater. Hermione's mind began racing on how to win this particular encounter. <em>Let him get close and snatch the wand.</em> Plan made.</p><p>"Oh dear 'Mione, you think you'd get away with this? I filed assault against you, but I could drop it if you beg and start playing with me, if you know what I mean." Ron winked and wiggled his eyebrows. Hermione needed a trash bin to barf into. The git was loony.</p><p>
  <em>Bloody Hell!</em>
</p><p>"It was self-defense, a Pensieve will attest to that fact." Hermione was sure the bumbling idiot could not compile the facts. How he had gotten her arrested still eluded her as the Aurors would have reviewed the idiot's memories before arresting her. Unless-</p><p>Hermione's eyes widened at the implication she just thought of now. Ron in a burst of wit grinned so wide when he saw Hermione realize what he had done.</p><p>"About that. Didn't think I was so smart, eh? Well, it wasn't actually my idea. Mum knew how to alter memories since dad had taught her. The Aurors didn't even say anything, well, the Auror we talked to anyway. It looks like being a pureblood still has sway in the Ministry after all!" Ron laughed. Kingsley was too busy to oversee all the things happening in the Ministry. A little help from his dad made the report on Hermione take a little longer before landing into the Minister's hands.</p><p>Hermione cursed. She couldn't believe the boy she had known for years would betray her like this just for what? a shag? An exert of dominance over a muggle-born? She knew that winning a case like this would be hard. The court case would turn into a 'he said, she said' match. Rita Skeeter most likely had already released headlines that went against her as well. The only true allies Hermione still had was Harry Potter and Minerva McGonagall for sure, but neither could help her at this time.</p><p>"We do have a few hours 'Mione." Ron began to walk forward weirdly, trying to walk sexily, but instead looked like he was a limping drunk. The witch knew he wouldn't even last a minute, a minute might be too kind<em>.</em></p><p>Hermione wanted to chuckle, but the situation was dire. Ron could still overpower her with strength and that would most likely be the end if she could not reach his wand. Ron was halfway through the room when she decided to practice what she had been reading last in Hogwarts.</p><p>The arsehole wouldn't be getting the better of her or her virginity without a fight. "Wingardium Leviosa!" Wandlessly, Hermione flicked the chair at the side of the room to propel and smash right into the offending redhead. The force of the hit was powerful enough that carrot-top was flung straight into door, but this time there was no book to finish him off. There and then, she wish she had learned a wandless stunning spell. She only knew a few other wandless spells and none of them would help right now.</p><p>Anger morphed into the Weasley's face as he brought up his wand. Hermione sent the table and the other chair towards Ron, but the boy had a wand, deflecting the incoming projectiles even while slumped on the floor was easy.</p><p>
  <em>Shite.</em>
</p><p>"This is no place for your ideals. Smartest witch of her age, hah! You won't change anything. I should have done this ages ago. I'll teach you how a proper wizard's wife should act. I want you to feel everything that's going to happen. You might like it." Ron smirked from feeling smart at what he said and re-aimed the wand.</p><p>"Petrificus Totalus!"</p><p>
  <em>I just wanted to be left alone to read.</em>
</p><p>Hermione could not dodge.</p><hr/><p>Petrificus Totalus - Full Body-Bind Curse</p><p><strong>AN: </strong>This is the first time I've actually submitted something online or anywhere as a matter of fact. Some spells are originally created to progress the story(Most are just vague Latin translations). I have a decent plot line in my head, but everything is subject to change. I'll try my utmost best to keep characters in character, but some of them need to be shifted (Ron's a bit of an arse here, sorry to his fans).</p><p>Rating is M, but could probably pass off as T for swear words and such. Just playing safe.</p><p>Updates will come from time to time since I write/type slow. I tried my best to eliminate any inconsistencies and paradoxes in my story. Advanced apology for any left. Sorry for grammatical mistakes and other mistakes, I write the story on my phone most of the time!</p><p>Reviews, comments, constructive criticism and suggestions are always appreciated.</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just a few tiny errors I fixed.</p><p><strong>Edit: </strong>I put a poem at the start. I don't know why, it seems kind of cute. Might just put it up on all future chapters too!</p><p><strong>01/16/16 Edit: </strong>Someone brought to my attention that Harry knew about Rita being an Animagus already. Soo~ Changed!</p>
