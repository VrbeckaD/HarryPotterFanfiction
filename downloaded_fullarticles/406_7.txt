He's just a nuisance that's bring down my grade and I'm sure he thinks the same thing of me," (Y/N) ranted as he turned on his heel and continued to pace in a corner of the Gryffindor common room. His three friends, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Harry Potter, watched him (rather absentmindedly) from their places on three comfortable, plush chairs. "And you know what?!" he exclaimed loudly, pounding his fist into his palm in a gesture of enlightenment. His excitement startled his three friends out of their inattentive states. "I'm going to tell Slughorn that tomorrow and request that he places Malfoy and I with different potions partners!" <br/>        "(Y/N)," Hermione said, closing the book that, for once, laid unread on her lap. "Slughorn will never agree to that. Besides, we're too late into the brewing process to switch partners."<br/>        At Hermione's words (Y/N) seemed to deflate and he collapsed onto a fourth chair. <br/>        "He's just so insufferable. What if I just pretend to be sick? Or break my arm." He leaned over to Harry's chair and threw his arm over the armrest. "Go on, Harry. Break it. We'll say it was an accident."<br/>        "I'm not going to break your arm," Harry said. <br/>        (Y/N) sighed. "What about you, Ron? Wanna have a go at it?"<br/>        Ron shook his head. "Sorry, mate. But I do agree that Malfoy is a complete prat."<br/>        (Y/N) crossed his arms and sunk down in his chair. "I don't suppose I can convince you, 'Mione?"<br/>        "That's barbaric," she said. <br/>        (Y/N) abruptly stood. "Fine! Then I'm going to go find someone or something that will break my arm." He made his way to the portrait but stopped a few feet away. "Hey, Neville, do you want to do me a favor and break my arm for me?"<br/>        "What?!" <br/>        "Hm. I suppose not." And (Y/N) proceeded to step through the portrait hole. </p><p> </p><p>        An hour later when (Y/N) still had not returned the three were watching the portrait hole impatiently, waiting for their friend to come back. <br/>        "You don't suppose he was serious, do you?" Ron asked. <br/>        Neither Harry nor Hermione answered. <br/>        Just then the portrait swung open. The three straightened in their seats but slumped down again when they saw it was just a fourth year. <br/>        "Pardon, do you know (Y/N) (L/N)?" Hermione asked. <br/>        "Yeah," the fourth year responded quietly, confused as to why an eighth year was talking to him.<br/>        "Have you seen him in the past hour?" <br/>        "Yeah. I saw him a few minutes ago. I think he was on his way to the whomping willow."<br/>        The three eighth years exchanged a glance and before springing from their seats and running out of the common room. </p><p>        <br/>        "Hello, Mr. Whomping Willow," (Y/N) said, "Would you do me a favor and break my arm?" He siddled closer to the tree.<br/>        "Are you insane?" A loud voice said. <br/>        (Y/N) flung his head over his shoulder, the rest of his body followed. <br/>        "...Malfoy?" <br/>        The blonde pushed himself off of the ground and sauntered over until he was only a foot or so away, standing a whole two inches taller than (Y/N). <br/>        "Why the hell are you asking the whomping willow to break your arm?" <br/>        "Why the hell do you care?" <br/>        Draco crossed his arms over his chest, raising an eyebrow. "Well I can't just turn a blind eye when you're doing it right in front of me. I could get in trouble. Now. Why are you trying to break your arm? Do you just have no sense of self-preservation?"<br/>        "Maybe I just want to know what it feels like." <br/>        "Have you gone mental?"<br/>        "No! I haven't gone bloody mental! In fact it's your fault I'm trying to break my arm!"<br/>        "My fault?"<br/>        "Yes! If I didn't have to be your potions partner I wouldn't have to break my arm!"<br/>        "Merlin," Draco muttered, pinching the bridge of his nose, "You have gone mental."<br/>        (Y/N) crossed his arms over his chest and frowned for a moment before his (e/c) eyes lit up and he launched himself forward, clinging on to the front of Draco's school robes. <br/>        "We get into fights a lot! Let's fight! I'll even let you break my arm!" <br/>        Draco took an awkward step back, grabbing onto (Y/N)'s wrists and trying to pry himself free of his grasp. He ignored his offer and scowled down at him. "You're seriously willing to have your arm be broken just so you don't have to be my potions partner anymore?" <br/>        (Y/N) nodded his head vigorously. <br/>        "You're an idiot."<br/>        "I'm not an idiot! You're the idiot!"<br/>        "Yeah right, Mr. D-grade idiot! How did you even pass first year?"<br/>        "Oh look at me," (Y/N) said, putting on an insulting impersonation of Draco's voice, "Perfect Mr. Pureblood who thinks he's better than everyone!" <br/>        "Merlin, why are you so attractive?!"<br/>        "Me?! Have you seen yourself?!"<br/>        "I really wanna kiss you right now."<br/>        "Do it, then!" (Y/N) said before tugging hard on the front of Draco's robes and smashing their lips together.<br/>        "Ow!" they shouted in unison when their noses hit. <br/>        "Sorry. That wasn't supposed to happen," (Y/N) said, bending over and cradling his nose in his hands. <br/>        "Want to try again?" Draco asked, "In a more calm manner?"<br/>        "Yeah." (Y/N) straightened back up.<br/>        Draco placed his hands on (Y/N)'s cheeks and leaned in to put their lips together. (Y/N) pressed himself against Draco, his hands landing on the other's hips. In turn, Draco's hands rested on (Y/N)'s lower back. <br/>        "(Y/N), DON'T BREAK YOUR--wait, what...?" Hermione said, coming to an awkward stop about fifteen feet away. Ron and Harry ran up behind her. <br/>        Draco and (Y/N) broke apart. They gave each other a glance before turning to the other three teens. <br/>        "So, uhm...are you two... an item or something?" Harry asked.<br/>        "...Uh...No...?" (Y/N) said, shifting on his feet. <br/>        "Maybe?" Draco said, taking up a defensive stance and placing an arm around (Y/N)'s shoulders. <br/>        "I mean..." (Y/N) said, glancing up at Draco, "That kiss was pretty great. And have you seen his ass? Hot damn!"<br/>        "Thanks, I try," Draco said, smirking. He then leaned over to whisper in (Y/N)'s ear, "You're still an idiot when it comes to potions, though."<br/>        (Y/N) pushed Draco off of him and began walking away.<br/>        "I'm only joking! Where are you going?"<br/>        "To break my arm!"<br/>        "Wait, no!" the four other teens shouted as they ran after him.</p></div>
