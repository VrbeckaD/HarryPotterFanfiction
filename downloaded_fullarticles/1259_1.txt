    <p><em>Draco is baking….</em>
</p><p>A wave of nutmeg, cinnamon, and caramelized sugar hit Harry the instant he walked through the front door.</p><p>
  <em>Draco is baking…. I should run.</em>
</p><p>After three years, he knew exactly what that particular warmth of Grimmauld Place meant. He knew it meant he should leave while he still had the option to be selfish. Before this became a <em>thing</em>. Before he was sucked in to swirling vortex of Draco's drama. Before they likely had another fight because Draco couldn't present his feelings like a normal human being.</p><p>One could argue Harry wasn't much better if he was thinking of running away from the inevitable blast of those feelings…but he chose not to think too hard about that.</p><p>"Potter?"</p><p>He'd shut the door before he even stood a chance to leave quietly. (And maybe Draco was right when he said Harry always stomped into the house like a rogue rhino.) Steeling his nerves and slapping a smile on his face, Harry waded through the spiced air and down to the kitchen. He didn't say a word until he was on the last step, peeking around the corner. "Hey…. What's on the menu?"</p><p>A bomb made of flour and icing sugar had detonated in their kitchen. Every surface was peppered with white and practically every dish was dirty. In the middle of it all stood pale, white Draco covered in that same carnage. He looked more spectral than usual. The first time Harry had witnessed this display? It was admittedly adorable. This time? The hundredth or thousandth time? Harry was rightfully scared. Or worried. Was there an emotion that fell somewhere in the middle?</p><p>Anxious?</p><p>"I was making spice cake," Draco stated, rather matter-of-fact. He always spoke like what he had to say was obvious. It was equal parts annoying and endearing.</p><p>Harry assumed he said '<em>was</em>' because said cake could be found in a still-steaming mess on the floor next to the bin. Cautiously, Harry walked over to inspect it. He stooped down, poking at it first before taking a bit of crumb and placing it on his tongue. Per usual…it wasn't good. It wasn't even passable. Had all the sugar ended up on Draco instead of in the cake? "Did it offend you?" Harry asked with what he hoped was a playful smirk.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Straightening, Harry walked closer to Draco. Examined him because he <em>was</em> the bomb that went off in this room before reaching out for him. Gliding the pad of his thumb over a tear-streaked track in the powdery mess upon his cheek. "What happened?" he whispered.</p><p>"I think I forgot to put something in. Treacle? I can't remember if the recipe wanted treacle…."</p><p>"No…. Draco, what happened before you decided to make that Chernobyl-level disaster?"</p><p>Draco pulled a face like he was unsure if he should be offended. Like he couldn't process if he was the one truly at fault for the heap of cake on the floor. "Before? I went on your internet to obtain a recipe to make spice cake? Did you think I just pulled it out of the air? Maybe it would have turned out better if I somehow had…."</p><p>He was exhausting. His full name should have been Draco Most-Frustrating-Man-Alive Malfoy. Harry did his best to avoid rolling his eyes and forced his smile to stay earnest. "Draco," he started, stern and unwavering. "You don't attempt to bake inedible pastries unless-"</p><p>"Salazar's sake, Potter, cake is <em>not</em> pastry…."</p><p>"<em>Unless</em>," Harry continued once his hand was securely fitted over Draco's mouth, "you're upset about something." The silver of Draco's eyes darkened as he narrowed them in silent response. "Are you going to tell me what that something is?"</p><p>Draco's response…well, it wasn't exactly a <em>response</em> so much as another attempt to change the subject. A valiant attempt, at that. Since his hand was settled over Draco's lips quite lightly, it was easy for him to part them. It was easy for him to lean in closer and nip at the knuckle of Harry's middle finger, sending chills up his spine. It was easy for him to, with that one singular move, take over control of the situation. Honestly…Harry would let him take over literally any situation with a look filled with so many filthy promises.</p><p>When Harry's hand fell heavy back to his side, the corner of Draco's lips pulled up into one of those barely-there smiles. Draco was fully aware that this particular smile drove him <em>crazy</em>. He was being played like a well-tuned violin. (Or, perhaps, something less graceful like a tuba?) And it was just so easy to let it happen…. Especially when those lips tasted so decadently of icing sugar and the ghostly tang of raw ginger.</p><p>"We're talking about this." It was Harry's last attempt.</p><p>It was futile. Draco had him backed into a counter before he could find the wherewithal to put up a fight. And why should he want to? If Draco didn't want to talk about it, they wouldn't. The problem at hand, whatever that may have been, couldn't have been too severe if Draco was groping him in such a heady fashion.</p><p>Right?</p>
