    <p>In northwestern London lay King’s Cross railway station. Perfectly ordinary, one may say, undeniably one of the busiest in the city. Today was no exception, though maybe a little busier than usual, as strange groups of people carrying enormous trunks, weird shaped packages and caged owls – among others – made their way towards, and then through, the solid barrier between platforms Nine and Ten. There they would reach platform Nine and Three-Quarters which, like every other September the first, was awash with activity.</p><p>It was 10:47am, and the Hogwarts Express was about to leave.<br/>
<br/>
The bright scarlet engine of the train billowed out thick clouds of steam over the crowd of wizards and witches, students and parents, giving them all a ghostly aspect as the echo of their voices generated a consistent humming sound throughout the platform.</p><p>Somewhere in the middle of this commotion, a brown skinned fifteen-year-old witch with waist-length aqua blue braids was bidding her mother goodbye.</p><p>“Okay listen up now young lady. I don’t care what kind of trouble you decide to get yourself into this year, but at least don’t be stupid enough to get caught. Understood?” the woman said sternly, standing tall as she looked down at her teenage daughter.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, Mom,” the girl, who was nonchalantly leaning against her luggage cart, replied with a slight roll of her eyes.<br/>
<br/>
“I am serious, Uma!” her mother continued, now crossing her arms over her prominent chest. “You got this close to get expelled last year. Do it again, and you come straight back home to work with me at the restaurant, non-negotiable.”<br/>
<br/>
“I hear you.” Uma looked the older witch in the eyes, crossing her arms as well. “You won’t get a letter.”</p><p>She somehow meant that. There was no way she’d work permanently as a waitress in her mother’s restaurant. <em>It’s already a pain in the ass as a summer job</em>, she thought.</p><p>“Good. You better go then, if you want to find a seat.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, okay. Thanks for dropping me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ah, shut it. So I’ll see you in June.”<br/>
<br/>
“See you in June. Bye Mom.”</p><p>This was what a typical goodbye between the Triskelion mother and daughter looked like. No hugs, no kisses, no ‘I’ll miss you’ or ‘Promise to write every week’. No display of affection of any form whatsoever. It was just not how Ursula worked, she had other ways to show that she cared. And young Uma grew up to roll with it. She would gladly settle for some rough words of advice, an occasional tap on her shoulder, an even rarer squeeze on her upper arm – she hasn’t gotten one since the day she took the Hogwarts Express for the very first time – or, like today, a nod of her mother’s head.</p><p>The woman turned on her heel and walked away, though not without earning a fair amount of side looks as she went. She paid them no mind. Ursula and Uma were now used to those. The side looks, the hushed whispers wherever they went. To the smiles disappearing, and the women holding onto their children tighter, whenever they were recognized. To the dark legacy carried, through no fault of their own, by their last name.</p><p>Morgana Triskelion. A fervent Death-Eater who was a part of Lord Voldemort’s closest followers before his fall. A woman who, under the obscure name of the ‘Death Siren’, murdered a tremendous amount of Muggle-born and ‘blood-traitor’ wizards, with a specific <em>modus operandi</em> that made her crimes easily recognizable: the bodies of the victims would be found tied up to their beds, shirtless with an X craved on their chests, and would appear as drowned even though there was no water in the room.</p><p>Morgana was Ursula’s little sister. Uma’s aunt.</p><p>The dark witch was securely locked up in Azkaban now, but people still looked at them because even after they did their best to shake off any association with her, they unfortunately couldn’t erase the genetics. Corpulence aside, Ursula and Morgana were pretty much twins who were born two years apart. Combine that to most people’s narrow-mindedness and get the following result: people were still afraid of them.</p><p>Uma watched as her mother’s curvy silhouette was quickly swallowed by yet another wave of families that just went through the magical barrier to access the platform. She reached inside the pocket of her black leather jacket and popped a gum into her mouth, then began to push her cart down the stony platform in search of a empty compartment. Finding a familiar face would be a huge bonus in the task.</p><p>Her wish was granted a few minutes later, as she nearly reached the end of the train. Casually hanging out the window of the carriage, a light-skinned boy with darkish hair, a sharp jawline and thick, black eyeliner circling his light blue eyes, spotted her immediately.</p><p>“May the Almighty Goddess of the Sea bless my eyes on this fine Sunday. And by Davy Jones, look at that hair! That color looks marvelous on you darling.”</p><p>Uma scoffed at the boy. That was so Harry of Harry to say. Harry Hook, a fifth-year Slytherin just like her. Her best friend since first year, and the person she was actually most eager to find. She eventually smirked up at him, putting a hand on her hip.</p><p>“I’m glad to see that spending your whole summer on a boat didn't make you any less extra.”<br/>
<br/>
“This is the only way I can be, my love. I’d even say the sea brings out the best of me. Or the worst.” Harry winked playfully, before leaning further out the window and he looked around. “Speaking of, is your lovely mother around? I was hoping to salute her and soak in that Triskelion magnificence for a bit. It’s good for my soul.”<br/>
<br/>
“You know damn well she doesn’t stay. Never has, and probably never will. So your soul will have to put up with me.” Uma popped her gum.</p><p>Harry smirked back, “I’m more than happy with that, too.”</p><p>“Yeah, bet you are.” The young witch then waved towards her heavy trunk. “So are you going to help me with that or not?”<br/>
<br/>
“Aye, you know your wish is my command.”</p><p>Within ten seconds Harry was off the train, about to grab ahold of Uma’s trunk, when …</p><p>“Uma! Harry! Hey, guys!”</p><p>Both teens turned their heads towards the voice that had just called their names, to see two figures approaching them rapidly. The first one, a brawny guy with shoulder-length blonde hair, was pushing his cart with one arm as the other one was waving in the air. The second one, a bit smaller and thinner, had short white hair with the black roots visibly showing and a small smile on his freckled face.</p><p>“Damn,” Harry muttered to Uma in a lower voice. “Is it me or our Gilly-Gil got pumped over the summer? Holy muscles. I bet he could crush me with those biceps.”<br/>
<br/>
“Geez, can you just grow some balls and ask him out already?” Uma rolled her eyes playfully. “I don’t know how much more of your fantasies I can take.” Though she had to admit, Gil definitely looked like he gained some mass.<br/>
<br/>
“Maybe, maybe not. We’ll see. I like teasing him. He’s so cute.”</p><p>Four years ago, during the first meeting of the Hogwarts Dueling Club, eleven-year-old Harry got paired up with a certain Gil Legume from Hufflepuff to practice the Disarming Charm. But unfortunately for Harry, eleven-year-old Gil’s already very handsome face made it hard for him to stay focused, poor boy literally got knocked off his feet a few times. To say the least, Gil was rather wary when two Slytherins suddenly tried to get close to him afterwards, but in the end the three of them became basically inseparable (as much as they could be while being from two different houses) and Gil wouldn’t trade his two best friends for anything in the world. And Carlos De Vil, a younger Hufflepuff that Gil took under his wing later on, hung out with them from time to time.</p><p>Harry had the hots for Gil and flirted with him shamelessly every chance he got, only for Gil to be oblivious to it most of the time, which Harry really seemed to enjoy.</p><p>Gil was smiling wider than ever when he reached his friends.</p><p>“What’s up boys?” Uma popped her gum again.<br/>
<br/>
“Eh. Same old, still hard,” Carlos shrugged, and they all knew what he meant by that. Since the beginning, Carlos dreaded the first day of school because he had to say goodbye to his dog Dude, whom he was really close to. “But I dig the new hairstyle. It’s like, so you.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, I like it too. It’s really pretty,” Gil added as he softly grabbed a couple of blue braids and let them slip through his fingers.<br/>
<br/>
“Erm, thanks?” Uma responded hesitantly.<br/>
<br/>
“Told you darling. Though she’s clearly not the only one who changed looks.” Harry smirked and traced the outline of Gil’s left bicep suggestively with his fingertips.</p><p>But as usual Gil completely missed the hint and beamed, “Ah, you noticed! Yeah, this summer I went to the gym almost every day, it’s a Muggle thing. I lifted weights.”</p><p>“Weights?” Harry repeated, puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah. They have these weird equipments with heavy metal things to pull or push or lift, to make you stronger,” Gil explained.<br/>
<br/>
“Which can be useful for Quidditch!” Carlos pointed out excitedly.<br/>
<br/>
“I know! That’s what my brothers said too when they hooked me up on it.”<br/>
<br/>
“Or you could simply drink a Strengthening Solution for the same results,” Uma sighed and shook her head, causing Harry to glare. “What? Pulling, pushing and lifting? That sounds grueling.”<br/>
<br/>
“It is, a little,” Gil admitted. “But I’m not sure what you’re suggesting is even <em>legal</em>.”<br/>
<br/>
“So?”<br/>
<br/>
“Well, we kinda like to play fair,” Carlos replied, shrugging, to which Uma scoffed.<br/>
<br/>
“Touché,” Harry muttered.</p><p>What fun would it have been if they always had the same point of view about life situations, honestly. It was all part of the whole friendship-between-Slytherin-and-Hufflepuff thing, right? Luckily for them, they were all – slowly – becoming mature enough to step down and try to avoid drama. Most of the time. Which is what Carlos did, straight away.</p><p>“Anyway. Don’t you think we should go find a compartment before they’re all full?”<br/>
<br/>
“No worries, Harry saved us seats.” Uma nudged the boy with her elbow.<br/>
<br/>
“Ah, awesome. Thanks Harry!” Gil gave his friend’s shoulder an affectionate pat.<br/>
<br/>
“Of course! Anything for my sea witch and my favorite Puffies.”<br/>
<br/>
“Well, let’s get inside. The train will depart soon.”<br/>
<br/>
“Right. Help me get these in.”</p><p>The whole time Gil was busy hoisting his stuff inside, then helping Carlos with his, Harry’s eyes were fixated on his arms and neck’s muscles. He felt himself getting hot in the ears at the way they contracted under the effort. Uma’s trunk that he was supposed to get inside laid here forgotten for a few minutes as the Slytherin boy gawked at his crush.</p><p>“Oh God. Lift me. Anytime you want.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, by the front carriages, another reunion was about to occur.</p><p>As she was already sitting by the window of her compartment, nose buried in a book, a young witch with fair skin and hair so black it actually looked indigo blue at a certain lighting, jumped and gasped when someone knocked against the window loudly from the outside.</p><p>“Hey there, beautiful.”</p><p>She clapped her book shut and looked at her best friend standing on the platform, a petite girl with bright green eyes, whose platinum blonde hair tips were dyed in light purple, giggling as if she hadn’t just startled her.</p><p>“For Merlin’s sake, Mal! You scared me!” she exclaimed, putting a manicured hand on her chest for emphasis.<br/>
<br/>
“Sorry. I couldn’t let you become antisocial before school even started,” Mal said with a shrug.<br/>
<br/>
“But, it’s a really good book!”<br/>
<br/>
“You’ll have all year to read. Now come out for a minute?”</p><p>Shaking her head, Evie pulled out a pocket mirror for a quick check and complied nonetheless. Upon arriving on the platform she gave Mal a hug. Or more accurately, Mal was hugging Evie’s torso considering she was about five-four and Evie was five-seven wearing four-inch heeled boots. And Mal pointed that exact fact out.</p><p>“Ugh. Why are you wearing these things again? I feel like a gnome.”<br/>
<br/>
“Well, one, because they’re awesome. And two, because for the rest of the year I won’t be able to,” Evie enumerated matter-of-factly. “And not a gnome though, more like a fairy.”<br/>
<br/>
“Same difference. They’re both ridiculously small.” Mal pouted. “Come on over there.”</p><p>A few meters further stood a small group of three ghostly silhouettes, a teenage boy and two women. From a distance, Evie quickly recognized the boy as Ben Beast, son of the current Minister of Magic, Mal’s oldest childhood friend and – since the previous year – boyfriend. He was a light brown haired athlete with hazel colored eyes, a gentleman behavior but a short temper when put on a Quidditch field.</p><p>He engulfed Evie in a welcoming embrace when the girls reached them. “Evie, good to see you! How are you?”</p><p>“Never better,” Evie replied as they pulled away. “It’s good to see you, too. How was your summer?”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, it was amazing. Did Mal tell you we went to Greece?” he said, wrapping his arm lovingly around said girl’s shoulders and pulling her closer onto his side.<br/>
<br/>
“She did, actually! You two have to tell me all about it.”<br/>
<br/>
“Of course, we have the whole train trip!” Mal beamed, then outstretched her hand towards one of the two women in front of them. “You remember my mother?”</p><p>Evie took a good look at the tall, slender woman with impeccably styled sandy blonde hair and designer clothes. Indeed, she remembered. As a matter of fact, Maleficent Dracorys was the kind of person one could hardly forget. The Dracoryses were one of the most ancient wizarding families of Great Britain, wealthy and influential, now known for being the closest friends of the Beasts. Not Evie’s favorite person in the world, she’ll admit, but she always handled their encounters the way she’s been taught so it wouldn’t show.</p><p>Politely, and with finesse. (<em>And don’t forget to smile!</em>)</p><p>“Yes, I do. It’s lovely to see you again Mrs. Dracorys.”<br/>
<br/>
“Likewise, Evalyn. Did you enjoy your summer?”</p><p>Whenever she talked to Mal’s mother, the brunette was always under the weird impression that she was being tested. That any wrong answer would alter the rather low regard she had for her. She never explicitly said it, but Evie was perfectly aware that she was far from meeting Mrs. Dracorys’ expectations when it came to Mal’s circle of friends. Let alone her <em>best friend</em>. The only reason why the woman was <em>at least</em> cordial with Evie was that she got wind of her academic success, which was a thing she valued a lot.</p><p>“I did! My mother and I spent a few weeks at my stepfather’s country house in Warwickshire, with him and his daughter. By a river, with wonderful gardens. And the library there was just fantastic, too.”<br/>
<br/>
“Gardens and a library, sounds like the perfect mix to me,” the other woman spoke, her voice sweet and dreamy. “Shakespeare?”</p><p>Evie blinked, slightly taken aback. People from the wizarding world usually didn’t bother with Muggle literature. Besides, how could she even know that… Never mind. She cleared her throat and answered, “<em>Othello</em> is my favorite.”</p><p>Smiling, Ben put his hand on the woman’s shoulder, “Ah, Evie, I don’t reckon you’ve met my mother.”</p><p>In total contrast with Mrs. Dracorys, Ben’s mother was shorter by several inches. She had the same light brown hair as her son, styled into a short curly bob and held back by golden clips on each side of her head. Her expression was kind, the corner of her warm brown eyes slightly wrinkled due to the fact that she was smiling just as warmly.</p><p>Belle Beast. The Minister’s wife. With a delicate bow of her head and a charming smile that showed just enough teeth, Evie stretched out her hand to the woman.</p><p>“I believe I haven’t. Evie Grimhilde. It’s a pleasure to meet you at last, Mrs. Beast.”<br/>
<br/>
“The pleasure’s mine, dear.” She shook Evie’s hand gently, then frowned slightly as she seemed to study the girl’s face. “Your name somehow sounds familiar. Do your parents work at the Ministry?”<br/>
<br/>
“No ma’am, you must be mistaken. My parents are Muggles.”</p><p>The brunette pretended to ignore Mrs. Dracorys’ little ‘<em>tsss</em>’ as she said that. Mal once revealed that her mother was strongly biased regarding Muggles, as she believed that they suffered from a serious lack of knowledge and a low quality of life. The first time they met, she actually asked Evie how Muggle hospitals could function properly without healing magic.</p><p>“You might be thinking of Martius Gremildhen, Belle dear, from the Goblin Liaison Office?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, you’re probably right. So many people work there, after all,” Mrs. Beast chuckled sweetly, waving a hand in the air, then brought her attention back to Evie. “Are you in Ben and Mal’s year?”<br/>
<br/>
“No, I’m starting my sixth year.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, so that means you’ve already taken the O.W.L.s that these two are going to have to study for. How did that work out for you?”<br/>
<br/>
“Pretty good! I, hm, I passed them all.”<br/>
<br/>
“She’s being modest, Belle,” Mal said, side eyeing her best friend with a smirk. “Evie’s been top of her year since day one. Her O.W.L scores are excellent.”<br/>
<br/>
“I dare hope that you intend to make yours excellent as well, Mal.” Mrs. Dracorys’ tone was soft but dripping with condescension.</p><p>Implying: “<em>If a Muggle-born could do it, you have no excuse not to do better</em>”.</p><p>“Of course, Mother. You know how hard I’ve been studying.”</p><p>Mal’s voice trembled ever so slightly as she said this, enough for Evie to notice and her hands tightened around her purse. The very last thing she wanted was to be used as leverage in the already tense relationship between her best friend and her mother. Mal certainly didn’t need that.</p><p>“I’m pretty sure they’ll be just fine, Maleficent,” Mrs. Beast intervened, putting a gentle hand on the taller woman’s arm. “Anyway, it’s almost time. You kids should get going.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes we probably should. Ah, and by the way, E…”</p><p>She interrupted herself to reveal the object she was pulling out of the pocket of her blazer. In her hand, a spotless badge that has a large ‘P’ across a red and gold background, as well as a gold lion. Mal was smiling wide and looked extremely proud of herself.</p><p>“Oh my God, you were made prefect! I told you it was only a matter of time. That’s amazing, congratulations! You too Ben?”<br/>
<br/>
“No, thank goodness. I think I’ll have enough responsibilities as captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.”<br/>
<br/>
“Holy mirrors. Guys that’s great! But although I’m happy for you Ben, you know my loyalty remains with my house, right?”<br/>
<br/>
“Of course!” Ben laughed light-heartedly. “I’m just glad I get to use the prefects’ bathroom.”</p><p>Evie laughed too and shook her head, “Silly. Well, Mrs. Dracorys, Mrs. Beast, it was nice seeing you.” She gave each woman a polite nod.</p><p>“You too, Evie. Have a good year at school.” Mrs. Beast reached out for the girl’s hand, squeezing it softly. “And when you see the Grey Lady, tell her Belle says hi.”</p><p>For the second time, Evie blinked at the woman’s guess (which, again, was right), and this time she actually voiced her surprise, “How do you know I’m in Ravenclaw?”</p><p>“Oh, dear. I can feel it. You sort of remind me of my younger self.”<br/>
<br/>
“Alright, then,” Evie grinned.<br/>
<br/>
“Well, we’re running out of time. Mal. A word.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes Mother.”</p><p>Mrs. Dracorys pulled her daughter apart as Ben hugged his mother tightly, then joined Evie who had already made her way back to the train. Together they waited for Mal, exchanging an embarrassed look after seeing the girl lower her head and nod slowly to whatever her mother was saying, which from afar certainly didn’t look like affectionate last minute recommendations.</p><p>Mal’s jaw was tensed when they finally split and she unfortunately failed to make her face look utterly relaxed when she reached the train.</p><p>“Are you alright?” Evie asked the blonde worriedly.</p><p>Mal gave her a small smile that was probably meant to be reassuring, “Yeah, everything’s fine. Let’s go.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p><br/>
As the Hogwarts Express pursued its northward journey like a bright red snake, the students inside passed the time like they always did: being teenagers.</p><p>Uma, Gil and Carlos all sat together in a compartment, laughing at something Gil had said about one of his brothers cursing the other’s broom, while waiting for Harry who had gone after the food trolley. The blue eyed boy returned a few minutes later with a pocketful of Pumpkin Pasties, Chocolate Frogs, Cauldron Cakes and Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans, and in his hands he was holding a…</p><p>“Harry, why do you have a <em>cat</em>?”</p><p>Harry let out an annoyed sigh as he reclaimed his seat next to Uma, “It’s my sister’s. I found him in the hallway howling like a madman.”</p><p>The cat had a long, thick coat of black and grey fur and his eyes were an interesting mix of green, blue and copper. The pattern on his back reminded Uma of crocodile skin. Harry set him down on the couch on the other side of him, but the animal clearly had other intentions and jumped on his lap.</p><p>“Your little sister? She’s going to Hogwarts?” Carlos arched an eyebrow with interest.<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, it’s her first year,” Harry groaned as he pushed the cat away from him.<br/>
<br/>
“That’s cool! Which house do you think she’ll be sorted into?” Gil asked.<br/>
<br/>
“Slytherin for sure. Da’ wants me to keep an eye on her.”<br/>
<br/>
“Like you’re doing right now? Do you even know where she is at the moment?” Uma teased, making the boy scowl.<br/>
<br/>
“In the bloody train, that’s all that matters. The lass saw her bestie at King’s Cross and got in straight away. And <em>get off</em> you hairball!” He pushed the cat who, for the second time, tried to lay down on his lap. “Only thing I know is I won’t spend my time running after her stupid cat.”<br/>
<br/>
“Well, you might not need to. He seems to be quite fond of you,” Carlos said nodding towards the cat.</p><p>Indeed, the pet had given up on trying to climb on Harry’s lap and instead decided to snuggle against his thigh, curled up looking like a big, furry ball, and began to purr audibly.</p><p>“I give up,” Harry sighed as he threw his hands up in surrender.</p><p>He emptied his pockets onto the small table for everyone to share. Gil swiftly grabbed a box of Every Flavour Beans and opened it daring everyone to have it, so that’s what they did for the next fifteen minutes. Uma gave up after she ended up with disgusting flavors three times in a row, instead turning to the Chocolate Frogs, and the boys were laughing at Carlos whose face had turned crimson because of a cayenne pepper flavored bean when they were interrupted.</p><p>“I thought I smelled something <em>fishy</em> over here.”</p><p>Uma scoffed, not even looking up from the Famous Witch card she was reading (Sacharissa Tugwood, a famous potioneer, she didn’t have this one) because she would recognize that irking, high-pitched voice anywhere.</p><p>“Dragon face. What an unpleasant and mostly <em>unwanted</em> surprise.”<br/>
<br/>
“Easy, Shrimpy. You might want to start showing a little respect if you want to stay out of trouble.”</p><p>The aqua haired finally stared at her rival who was standing in the doorway of their compartment, one hand holding the door frame and the other on her hip. Surely, Mal’s smug smirk intensified when she saw Uma’s eyes flicker to the shiny badge pinned to her chest.</p><p><em>You have got to be kidding me</em>, the Slytherin girl thought.</p><p>“Yeah, you noticed that, didn’t you. That’s right, I’ve been made prefect. And I actually stopped by to give you a fair warning.” Mal took one step inside the compartment, her piercing green eyes locked with Uma’s chocolate ones. “Behave yourself, Shrimpy. Unless, of course, you want to spend the whole year in detention. I’ll be more than <em>delighted</em> to be the one to send you there.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh really.” Uma leaned forward, her face scrunching up in an exaggerated, fake expression of distress. “<em>Boo hoo</em>, I’m so scared Mom, the big bad Mal is going to punish me!” Harry, Gil and Carlos laughed. Uma grinned as she continued, “Speaking of. Mommy must be really proud, isn’t she? I mean it’s a good way to make it up to her after last year’s little <em>incident.</em> Right?”</p><p>‘Hit ‘em where it hurts’ were words she lived by when it came to confronting Mal, because Mal herself usually wasn’t one to mince her words when she picked on her. For a split millisecond, she saw the blonde’s smirk falter just the slightest bit, and her top lip twitched, and oh, what a satisfaction. But Mal quickly regained her composure as she straightened her back.</p><p>“Well, at least she can offer me better vacations than a stinky fish shop. It must not be easy scaling your own kind on a daily basis, isn’t it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Try scaling some geckos and you’ll know.” Uma shrugged despite the fact that she really, really wanted to slap the sass out of Mal’s mouth right now.<br/>
<br/>
“How about—”<br/>
<br/>
“How about you get the hell out of here, now?” Harry put his two Knuts in, clearly fed up with the interaction.</p><p>The blonde looked him up and down and sneered.</p><p>“I didn’t know you were the cat type, Hook. Better be careful, they say cats eat shrimp as snacks.”<br/>
<br/>
“Nah this one isn’t a big fan of seafood. But he does enjoy chasing lizards and ripping their heads off just for fun.”</p><p>Mal’s lip curled, “We’ll see who’s laughing in the end.”</p><p>She stormed off without another word, slamming the door shut behind her.<br/>
<br/>
“Something tells me she’s not going to let you rest this year,” Carlos said. His face had retrieved its original complexion.</p><p>Uma kissed her teeth in annoyance. “Does she ever? She’s gonna be an even bigger pain in the ass now.”</p><p>“Eh, yeah. Try not to piss her off too much, will you? I kind of like seeing the Great Hall all in green at the end of the year,” Harry gently told Uma, then turned to the two Hufflepuffs in front of him. “No offense guys.”</p><p>Slytherin has been winning the House Cup for the past two years, Gryffindor the year before, and Ravenclaw in their first year, but Hufflepuff had gotten the habit of coming second by a handful of points.</p><p>“None taken,” both boys replied at the same time.</p><p>“So I’m just supposed to let her abuse her position?” Uma glared at her best friend. “Because she will. Trust me, if she could she’d take house points from us just for breathing.”<br/>
<br/>
“I know, and that’s not what I meant darling. We just have to find a smarter way to get back at her.”</p><p>The girl smirked at him. She just loved it when they were on the same page.</p><p>“It’s weird that you weren’t selected though,” Gil pointed out. “I genuinely thought you’d be prefect. I mean it can’t be because of what happened last year because Mal was involved too and still she is one now.”<br/>
<br/>
“In all honesty, Gil, I don’t know, and I really don’t care. I didn’t wanna be prefect anyway. Too much responsibilities, and you know I like to keep a low profile. Well, when I can.”<br/>
<br/>
“When you can indeed,” Carlos faked a cough.<br/>
<br/>
“What was that?” Uma raised her eyebrows at him. The boy shook his head.<br/>
<br/>
“Well, since it’s not you then I hope it’s Freddie,” Harry tapped his chin pensively. “She’s the only girl from our year I can tolerate. After you of course, love,” he corrected himself when Uma gave him a look.</p><p>Understand, the only ones who didn’t try to get him to drink a love potion at some point. Satisfied with his answer, Uma smiled proudly and unwrapped an other Chocolate Frog.</p><p>Conversation resumed easily among the four teenagers until, again, someone barged in their compartment unannounced an hour later. The sixth-year and top Slytherin Quidditch player Jay Barmaki walked in and plopped down on the couch next to Gil and Carlos with a flip of his long black hair. He had broad shoulders and an athletic figure, the exposed tanned skin of his arms looking smooth as he flashed his lady-killer smile at them.</p><p>“Well, hello Jay. Looking ravishing as usual,” Harry said casually.<br/>
<br/>
“What can I say. That’s my brand, isn’t it.”</p><p>Uma sensed by the way Jay was staring at her that his presence here wasn’t just a random act of fate. It never was, they weren’t friends. Cordial, friendly even, but not friends. For that very reason there was no need for small talk.</p><p>“What is it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Guess who’s the new Gryffindor prefect.”</p><p>Uma let out an annoyed groan, “Ugh, yeah. I know. She was just here an hour ago shoving it in our faces.”</p><p>“Heh. Sucks for you, doesn’t it. You’ll definitely be on her radar and she’s basically untouchable now.” Jay teased.<br/>
<br/>
“Wow, thanks for stating the obvious, smart ass.” Uma rolled her eyes.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, don’t get mad at me, I don’t make the rules. I was actually hoping it would be you.” Jay bumped her knee with his fist, as if he didn’t notice the girl’s bitter scowl. “Imagine all the fun we’d have with the detentions. You could sing these brats into doing crazy dumb stuff.”</p><p>Uma shook her head. She still deeply thought that Jay’s prefect position was the result of a lack of more appropriate options.</p><p>And of course, he would tease her about her singing. It was one of the reasons why other students still feared her. Following the scandal that surrounded Morgana’s arrest, the Daily Prophet did some digging, so now most people knew that her and Ursula’s grandmother was Hileia, the infamous siren who ventured on land, fell in love with a wizard and pushed the limits of her human transformation to the point that she died while giving birth to their mother.</p><p>Consequently, Uma was also part-siren, and her heritage manifested itself through her simple yet cryptic beauty, her ability to communicate easily with the merpeople living in the Black Lake, and her hypnotic singing voice. She never purposely used it on someone (though sometimes she wished it could affect girls so she could get Mal to do stupid stuff), but at times she would hum random melodies when she was alone. There was just this one time in her third year, when two first-years sneaked into the girls bathroom and heard her involuntarily. Both boys ended up fainting after dancing ridiculously in their undergarments with the same foolish look on their faces. They were brought to the hospital wing and woke up a few hours later being the laugh of the whole school.</p><p>“Now see, this –” she pointed her forefinger in Jay’s direction. “– is the exact reason why I’m glad I’m not prefect. Everyone would be expecting me to do that.”<br/>
<br/>
“So?” the older Slytherin boy raised an eyebrow incredulously.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t want to.”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re no fun.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh you want fun? I can sing now—”<br/>
<br/>
“Woah, no thanks. I didn’t do anything,” Carlos interrupted the exchange while raising both of his hands.<br/>
<br/>
“I second that,” Gil approved.<br/>
<br/>
“So who are the Slytherin prefects?” Harry asked.<br/>
<br/>
“Freddie Facilier,” Jay stated, to which Harry muttered ‘<em>Thank goodness</em>’. “And Kells Davon.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ehh, not bad. Kells’s a cool dude.”<br/>
<br/>
“Dorothy MacGibson and Kyle Stewart for Hufflepuff,” he then told Gil and Carlos.<br/>
<br/>
“That’s good. Dorothy is nice. She helps me with my homework sometimes,” Gil said innocently, completely missing the way Harry frowned at that.<br/>
<br/>
“So, about Dracorys?” Jay brought his attention back to Uma, who had found great interest in the ends of some of her turquoise braids.<br/>
<br/>
“What do you think. I’ll find a way to handle her. Heck, I’ll be a Death Eater before I let this bitch step on me again.”</p><p>All the boys’ faces dropped at once. Surprised with the sudden silence, Uma lifted her head to find the four pairs of eyes staring at her in a way-too-concerned way. Were they actually believing that she… “What the—? Chill out you idiots, I have no intention of joining the Death Eaters!”</p><p>“Can never be too careful,” Jay said, putting his hands up as he stood up to leave. “Anyway. I’m going back to the guys. I’ll see you lot at school.”<br/>
<br/>
“See ya!” Harry chanted with a dismissive wave of his hand.</p><p>Jay’s visit left Uma in a pensive state. She could hear the boys talking, but she couldn’t quite make out what they were saying. It has just truly dawned on her that her nemesis was a prefect and to her utter annoyance, she was actually a little worried. She hated being in situations when Mal had leverage over her and that, that wasn’t just leverage. That was a freaking bombshell. That Mal was obviously going to take advantage of. Because well, if she was honest, if the roles were reversed, Uma would, too. All common sense.</p><p>As the sun began to sink, coloring the sky in hues of light orange and purple, the eagerness of finally reaching their destination made itself felt within the young passengers. Almost all of Harry, Uma, Carlos and Gil’s compartment was covered with wrinkled plastic wraps and empty candy boxes as the four teenagers, rolling on a slight sugar high, embarked on a wild throwing battle. Now they were back to a sitting position and groaning about having to put their robes on.</p><p>Until, once <em>again</em>, someone irrupted in the compartment. This time, it was a much younger girl, tanned skinned with an impressive mass of golden blonde hair that was pulled up into a high ponytail. She didn’t say a word, instead looking from left to right with an irritated look that strongly reminded Uma of someone she knew very well.</p><p>“Ah, there you are Croc!” the girl sighed in relief as her eyes landed on the sleeping cat in the corner of the couch. She grasped him and held him against her chest, ignoring the loud meow of protest at being awaken so suddenly. “You had him this whole time?” she shouted at Harry.<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, you’re welcome. The bloody thing was lost in the hallway!” Harry snapped back.<br/>
<br/>
“Croc doesn’t get lost. No matter what he always finds his way back to me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Fine! Next time I’ll let him get run over by the food trolley.”</p><p>She then called him a name that one shouldn’t even know about at eleven years old. One that made Gil gasp and Carlos’ eyes widen. But growing up surrounded by sailors had had its perks. Harry, not even fazed, called her something similar and she rolled her eyes.</p><p>Two seconds later, she was staring intensely at Uma like she was just realizing she was sitting there.</p><p>“Are you Uma Triskelion?”<br/>
<br/>
“Eh, until proven otherwise, yes,” Uma said hesitantly, taken aback by the suddenness of the question.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you really a siren?” the little blonde carried on eagerly.<br/>
<br/>
“Get lost CJ,” Harry groaned, but she ignored him grandly, stepped forward instead.<br/>
<br/>
“Who told you about that?” Uma asked, though she had a slight idea what the answer to that question was.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Him</em>, duh.” CJ made a face as she nodded her head towards her big brother.</p><p>The blue haired girl glanced at her best friend from the corner of her eyes and smirked at how irritated he looked at this moment. She figured she had the right to tease him some more, “Oh. So Harry talks about me at home.”</p><p>At any other moment, Harry would’ve come up with the perfect witty, theatrical reply to that statement. But the here and now Harry was too busy refraining himself from yanking his little sister by her hair and throw her out of the train, to even acknowledge it.</p><p>“Ugh, tons. He’s like obsessed with you or something. It’s actually annoying sometimes,” CJ answered, as casually as if she was talking about the weather. “So, are you?”</p><p>Uma scoffed at the way Harry’s ears turned a bright shade of red. She already liked the younger girl. “No. My great-grandmother was one.”</p><p>CJ’s whole face lit with admiration tinted with a this-just-gave-me-an-idea kind of look in her impish eyes, “Wicked.”</p><p>“Are you done? Can you go now?” Harry hissed.<br/>
<br/>
“Not so fast, brother! You’re not going to introduce me?” she said in a cheerful tone, turning to the two other boys. “My name’s CJ, don’t let this jackass tell you otherwise. I’m obviously the cooler sibling. And you are?”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m Gil.” Gil waved.<br/>
<br/>
“Carlos.” The boy put his two’s up.<br/>
<br/>
“Nice to meet you. I hope we—”<br/>
<br/>
“CJ I won’t repeat it. Get out, right fucking now,” the older Hook interrupted her roughly.</p><p>The smaller girl turned back to him and sighed heavily, while adjusting her hold on a sleeping Croc in her arms. “Why do you <em>always</em> have to kill the mood?” She didn’t wait for a respond though. Instead, she shrugged. “Well, never mind. It’s nice to see that my brother’s friends aren’t losers like him. I’ll catch y’all later!”</p><p>She left without looking back.</p><p>“Are you always that harsh with her?” Gil asked as he scratched the back of his head.<br/>
<br/>
“She’s a brat. If you guys lived with her, trust me you would be too.”<br/>
<br/>
“Well, I kinda like her,” Uma declared.<br/>
<br/>
“Please don’t. She’s already enough trouble on her own.”<br/>
<br/>
“Are you saying <em>I’m</em> trouble, Hook?”</p><p>Harry turned his whole body around on his seat so he could fully face Uma and planted his azure gaze firmly into her own eyes, “Of course you are, my love. You’re the <em>best</em> kind of trouble. Just like the sea, you bring out the worst in me.”</p>
