    <p>“One morning a young man<br/>
Was walking his way<br/>
When he saw a fair maid<br/>
Come along the highway<br/>
He said to this fair maid<br/>
“If you do not mind<br/>
I will walk with you<br/>
On this fine morning.””<br/>
-Come With Me Now by The High Kings</p><p>Chapter 1: December 1942</p><p>Grindelwald had slowly but surely gained substantial power over the years, thus striking fear in the hearts of every citizen of the wizarding world. The Second World War had been moving forward at full speed, and the life of an underage wizard among the muggle population had proven to be twice the terror. It seemed as though there would be no relief from either side of the war for half bloods and muggleborns. </p><p>Tom Riddle had returned to Wool’s Orphanage for the Christmas holidays just the day before, only to find his already decrepit neighborhood destroyed beyond imagination. Apparently, air raids had been a favorite tactic of the Axis Powers while he had been away at school. Bomb sirens had been going off all day, yet there was nothing to be done except hope to not be killed. </p><p>Unfortunately, Tom found that nearly every building in the area had been destroyed except for the hell hole that he had been born in. Even when he was a small child, Tom fantasized about the orphanage being burned to the ground with all of its muggle occupants trapped inside.</p><p>Images of a fire blazing out of control and the screams of his tormentors filled Tom’s imagination as he lay silently in his almost empty bedroom. Suddenly, a sharp knock at the front door echoed throughout the house. His nostrils flared in annoyance, though after a moment his curiosity was piqued by the sound of more than one set of feet creaking up the staircase. Tom glanced at the clock, seeing it was already half past midnight, and he wondered who would be visiting the orphanage at such an hour.</p><p>“Tom?” Mrs. Cole’s voice called out as she slowly opened his bedroom door.</p><p>“I’m awake.” He replied in a curt tone, hoping to get whatever this exchange was over with as soon as possible. Sleep had been evading him that night, due to the sirens constantly going off, and Tom felt no need to hide his irritation. He sat up with an indignant sigh, but his eyes grew wide with surprise when the old woman stepped into the room to reveal the man that accompanied her.</p><p>“Professor Slughorn! What brings you here?” Tom exclaimed, remembering to employ his best charms for the head of Slytherin.</p><p>“Surely you didn’t think we would allow you to remain in such a life threatening environment, my boy! I received news of the raids in London and came to collect you straight away. Best to pack your things quickly, now.” The corpulent and balding man answered with a sigh before turning back to Mrs. Cole.</p><p>“Thank you very much, Madam. As I said before I am sorry to intrude at such a late hour. I would have, of course, made this a less inconvenient visit if possible.  One of our school governors was most disturbed to hear that one of our students was in harm’s way and demanded that I bring him back to school at once.” Slughorn explained to Mrs. Cole.</p><p>“Not at all, sir. We’ve been trying to relocate as many orphans as possible with very limited resources. I am just glad to know that another one of my charges will remain safe.” She replied with a knowing nod. It took only the time spent on the short exchange between the two adults for Tom to thrust his few possessions into his trunk.</p><p>“I am ready to leave when you are, sir.” Tom said politely as soon as Slughorn turned his attention back to the young man.</p><p>“Yes, well, thank you again, Madam. Tom and I will be on our way, then.” Slughorn said as he affectionately clapped Tom on the back before leading the way out of the building. Once the pair reached an isolated alleyway, Tom’s trunk disappeared with a casual flick of Slughorn’s wand.</p><p>“We’ll be apparating back, I’m afraid. It’s quite unpleasant the first few times and you may feel sick afterward, but I’m sure you’ll do just fine.” Slughorn explained as he held out his arm for Tom to take hold of.</p><p>Tom mentally braced himself, though he was still alarmed by the sensation of being sucked into a spinning tube as soon as he grasped Slughorn’s arm. Fortunately, the nauseating journey was over rather quickly.</p><p>“Steady, my boy.” Slughorn chuckled when Tom nearly fell over from dizziness upon their landing in Hogsmeade. It took him only a few seconds to regain his composure, although it took longer to escape the nausea. Together, the pair began the short walk from Hogsmeade to Hogwarts. They walked in silence for a moment, until curiosity got the best of Tom.</p><p>“Sir, who exactly is this school governor you spoke of earlier?” Tom asked, guessing that whoever had insisted upon his return would be waiting for them at the castle.</p><p>“Ah, yes. Well, you know Abraxas and Allura, of course. Their mother, Lucinda, is a member of the school governor’s board. As you can imagine, she takes a special interest in the well-being of Slytherin students.  Abraxas had told her where you were staying over the holiday and she stormed right into Headmaster Dippet’s office to ensure that the situation was corrected immediately. As your head of house, it seemed fitting that I went to get you out of there, and now here we are!” Slughorn elucidated with a grand gesture toward the now visible castle. </p><p>The view of Hogwarts at night really was a majestic sight to behold. Soft, flickering lights shined through the hundreds of windows, making the glorious reflection of the castle visible on the glassy surface of the Black Lake. The sight filled Tom with warmth as he gazed up at the only place that ever felt like his home.</p><p>Quietly, Tom and Professor Slughorn quickly made their way through the castle to the headmaster’s office.</p><p>“Horace, darling! Thank you ever so much for rescuing our young Mr. Riddle.” A tall woman exclaimed, waving both arms in a grand gesture as she spoke, as if she were gushing over a brave warrior.</p><p>“Not at all, Madam Malfoy. You flatter me so by suggesting an act of heroism took place tonight.” Slughorn chuckled, nearly tickled pink by her words as he stepped aside to usher Tom further into the office.</p><p>As Tom entered the circular room, his curious gaze fell immediately upon Abraxas and Allura’s mother, Lucinda Malfoy. She looked like the very definition of vanity. Perfect, voluminous curls were pinned elegantly atop her head, and not a single blonde hair was out of place. Her skin was so fair toned and clear that she looked like a life-sized porcelain doll. Her pristine satin dress and fur-lined travel cloak, along with extravagant jewelry to complete the look, proved to be nothing short of flaunting her obvious wealth. </p><p>“You look simply exhausted, sweetheart. And where on Earth is your winter cloak? You’ll catch your death outside dressed like that!” Mrs. Malfoy admonished as she looked Tom over. She clearly was not impressed or pleased by his tattered, old hand-me-downs, nor did she appreciate the indoor-style Slytherin cloak that was draped over his shoulders.</p><p>“I must say, Armando, I am quite displeased to find Slytherin’s most talented student wearing these rags. I should have received an owl right away if more funding is needed. And he has no attire that is appropriate for this frigid weather! Nothing to provide even a bit of warmth...and see there! The poor boy has a rather large hole on the side of his shoe where the stitching has come loose!” Lucinda exclaimed, pointing at Tom’s feet.</p><p>“Madam Malfoy, I can assure you that this has not happened due to negligence. Mr. Riddle is a fine young man that has always been determined to make his own way in the world.” Armando Dippet began to blubber, not wanting to flat out say that Tom refused charity as often as possible.</p><p>Tom wasn’t sure if he should be angry or pleased by the exchange. He thought it best to keep quiet for now and make up his mind about that later.</p><p>“Do you not agree that as a student, Mr. Riddle is unable to financially provide for himself?” Lucinda snapped, clearly outraged by the old man’s words.</p><p>“I...well, yes. Of course!” Dippet stuttered, a blush creeping across his face.</p><p>“Then you would also agree that top notch grades from a hard working student is more than fair in exchange for new clothing and school supplies each year.” She replied curtly, her logic irrefutable.</p><p>“Yes, Madam Malfoy. Your are right, of course. I don’t dare to suggest otherwise or make excuses.”</p><p>Normally, Tom would take issue with anyone making him sound so pathetic and helpless. However, he couldn’t deny the fact that he relished the power that Mrs. Malfoy clearly had over both Dippet and Slughorn. Beyond amused by how she was making his headmaster squirm, Tom decided to enjoy the show and forget how angry he would normally feel in such a situation. This clearly would prove to be quite beneficial to Tom, anyway. </p><p>“Tom, I would be ever so pleased if you would accompany me back to Wiltshire and stay with my family for the remainder of the holidays. Abraxas speaks so highly of you, and I’ve just read over your school records. We would be honored to have such a bright young man join us and I can say with confidence that you will be far more well tended to in my house.” Lucinda said sweetly, turning her attention to the silent young man. </p><p>Tom did his best to deliver a big enough smile, imitating someone who’s just been told that all of his hopes and dreams were about to come true. If he played his cards right, this situation would work perfectly to his advantage. He decided to take the act a step further and throw his arms around the woman unceremoniously, as though he couldn’t contain himself.</p><p>“Pathetic.” Tom thought to himself, hating to be held so closely as she returned his embrace will all the love and warmth she had to give. </p><p>The pair arrived at Malfoy Manor by portkey just before 1:30 in the morning.</p><p>“Dobby!” Mrs. Malfoy called out as she removed her travel cloak in the entryway. With a soft popping sound, the tiniest of house elves appeared at her feet and bowed so low that his nose touched the floor.</p><p>“See to it that a proper meal is prepared for our guest at once. I expect a suite to be ready immediately afterwards.” The eloquent woman ordered, hanging her cloak on a hook in the long hallway. The elf squeaked out a quick “Yes, Missus.” and scurried away to do her bidding.</p><p>“I don’t dare ask what those horrendous muggles gave you to eat today, if you were fed at all. This way, dear.” She explained before leading Tom into the ornate sitting room so he could sit by the fire and warm up.</p><p>“Mother, is that you?” A soft voice called out from the hallway before it’s owner entered the room as well. A gorgeous blonde girl sauntered into the room, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes as she did so. Tom couldn’t help but let his eyes drink in the sight of her for a split second. Although everything was covered in an appropriate manner, the silk nightgown she wore hugged all of her curves deliciously. He had never seen her hair let down before, as it was “improper” to not wear it up in public. Now, her long curls cascaded freely down her back, greatly adding beauty to her already angelic appearance. Tom had never paid much attention to her before, aside from glancing her way on occasion.</p><p>“Oh, hello Tom. I wasn’t aware that you would be joining us but I’m glad to see you, just the same.” Allura Malfoy greeted when she realized that the boy was seated in the armchair across from her mother.</p><p>“Hello, Allura.” Tom replied politely just as Dobby popped into the room with a silver tray and placed it onto the tea table.</p><p>“Dobby has prepared a most hearty beef stew, served with cottage loaf. Does this please you, sir?” The young elf squeaked, once again bowing so low that his face was smashed against the floor.</p><p>“Yes, thank you.” Tom replied briefly, unsure of the proper etiquette between wizard and elf.</p><p>“Far too kind, sir! So very nice to allow Dobby to serve you!” The elf squealed with glee before kissing the floor near Tom’s feet, though he was careful to not actually touch the young man. Tom felt rather awkward, of course.</p><p>“Dobby pleased the young master! Dobby did good!” The elf yelled triumphantly as he ran back to the kitchen with both hands waving in the air.</p><p>“Please excuse his enthusiasm, Tom. Dobby has just turned three and is very excited to have started his training this past summer. Just give him a good kick if he’s ever pestering you.” Lucinda said nonchalantly with a dismissive wave of her hand, as though kicking servants was nothing out of the ordinary. She struggled to stifle a yawn.</p><p>“Of course, Mrs. Malfoy.” Tom replied with as soft of a smile as he could bare before slowly beginning to eat. Surely he would have been forgiven for ignoring his manners but Tom didn’t care to let on how famished he felt. It had been the first time a meal was available to him since he left Hogwarts to return to London.</p><p>“You’re tired, mother. I’ll stay with Tom so you can go to bed.” Allura offered, seeing as the woman wouldn’t dream of yawning in front of a guest like that, stifled attempt or not.</p><p>“Thank you, sweetheart. I do need to rest so I can prepare everything for the party tomorrow.” Lucinda said graciously as she stood up and made her way to the door. She paused for just a moment to give Tom’s arm an affectionate rub before she bid the teenagers good night and went to bed. </p><p>Not too long after, Tom finished his second helping of stew. His stomach felt satiated for the first time in a few days.</p><p>“Would you like to see your room?” Allura asked as she made the silver tray vanish with a flick of her wand.</p><p>“Yes please.” Tom answered quietly, knowing he could very well get lost in such a large house. Allura nodded and waited for him to stand so she could lead the way. He followed the girl back into the entrance hall and up the grand staircase.</p><p>“I’ll be happy to give you a proper tour of the manor tomorrow, if you’d like.” She offered as she lead Tom down the long hallway on the left. </p><p>“Oh…”She stopped suddenly after turning the lights on in the guest suite. Tom’s trunk was nowhere to be seen. “Stupid Dobby...he must have misplaced your things.”</p><p>“Actually, your mother rather insisted that I leave everything behind. She took great offense to my clothes being so worn out. Although, I quite enjoyed the tongue lashing she gave Dippet for that.” Tom replied with a cool chuckle. </p><p>“She’s a piece of work, isn’t she?” Allura joked as she strolled to the suite’s adjoining bathroom, beckoning Tom to follow.</p><p>“You’ll find yourself very comfortable while you’re here, I’m sure.” Allura started as she began to retrieve hygiene products from the bathroom cabinet, placing them in an orderly fashion on the oversized counter next to the sink. “If you’d like to get ready for bed I’ll get some clothes for you from Abraxas’ room. He’s dead asleep, of course.”</p><p>“Thank you, Allura.” He replied as she exited the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>As Tom brushed his teeth, he pondered his previous encounters with Allura at school. She never talked very much, obviously due to her preference for reading over gossiping with the other girls. He spent far more time with Abraxas and the other boys, so he couldn’t really say that he knew her much at all. He did know that she was very smart, after hearing Abraxas complain about how Allura’s grades always topped his. Perhaps Allura would prove to be more useful than he had previously considered. It had always been difficult to find someone so intelligent that wasn’t an incessant pest. There she had been all this time, silently under his nose for years. By the time he had finished washing up, Allura had already left a pair of pyjamas on the bed for Tom and retired to her room for the night. </p><p>Tom had never slept so well in his entire life. The plush, king sized bed had proven to be the warmest and most comfortable piece of furniture he had ever encountered. If he had forgotten himself, Tom might have whistled merrily while using the toilet first thing that morning. After a hot shower, Tom slipped into the cobalt gray suit and black leather shoes Allura had left for him the previous night, noting how the colors made his cerulean eyes look so much brighter than usual. He didn’t particularly like wearing Abraxas’ clothes, but had no other choice if he was to look presentable. </p><p>Shortly after 8:00, Tom exited his suite, finding Abraxas headed his way. </p><p>“Good morning.” Abraxas greeted with a friendly nod. “Mother just sent me to bring you downstairs for breakfast.”</p><p>“Very well.” Tom replied before following his blonde companion down the long hallway. “She’ll be busy getting everything ready for the Christmas Eve party tonight. It’ll be boring but I thought you might like to start networking with ministry employees. You’ve expressed interest in making good connections to help carry out our future plans.” Abraxas explained conversationally. He knew all too well, as Tom’s most loyal supporter, that his counterpart intended to rule the wizarding world someday. Having the ministry in his pocket early on would certainly help the cause. </p><p>“That does sound rather appealing. Isn’t your father an auror?” Tom inquired, his interest in the party now piqued.</p><p>“Head of the department. I heard mother talking to him earlier this morning about finding an apprenticeship at the ministry for you so you don’t have to stay with muggles on long breaks from school. I’d pick the auror department if I were you. There’s loads of dark magic you could learn about there.” Abraxas continued, lowering his voice substantially at the last part.</p><p>“Indeed…” Tom said with a cold smile, the possibilities beginning to dance through his mind. </p><p>All conversation came to a halt very suddenly when Tom entered the dining room behind Abraxas. Truth be told, Allura couldn’t take her eyes off of Tom. She had noticed his good looks before, to be sure, but he looked stunning in the expensive suit she had picked out for him to wear.</p><p>“See here, Antonius! Proof of what I’ve been telling you all morning! This young man belongs in the elite wizarding circles. So very handsome, indeed!” Lucinda exclaimed with a huge smile.</p><p>“Well don’t go shrieking him deaf, Lucinda.” Mr. Malfoy chuckled. “Tom Riddle, I presume?” He added, extending his hand to the boy.</p><p>“Yes, sir. It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Tom Greeted and shook the older man’s hand firmly with a charming smile. Despite the fact that his attention was on Mr. Malfoy, Tom was well aware that Allura was blatantly staring at him in awe. Tom had to fight back the urge to smirk at her.</p><p>“Close your mouth and stop that gawking, you stupid girl.” Lucinda scolded her daughter in a hushed tone. Tom pretended not to hear as he took a seat at the table. </p><p>“Abraxas tells me that you’re the head of the auror department at the ministry. You must deal with quite a lot of excitement in your daily life, what with Grindelwald causing such a ruckus. I don’t know too much about him, although I suspect that he would have done exceptionally well in Slytherin had he attended Hogwarts in his younger days.” Tom started conversationally as he politely cut up his steak. He had never had a meal so grand as steak and eggs for breakfast, yet here he was. The meal was fit for a king and what’s more, he felt rather important due to the suit and “adult” conversation he just started with the richest family in the British wizarding world.</p><p>“That he would have, m’boy!” Antonius cackled, clearly feeling glee over the young man’s words. “I’ve been fortunate enough to help him a time or two, you know. He had great use for my connections over at MACUSA back in ‘26. Good man, that Grindelwald. Can’t understand why anyone with magical blood even thinks to oppose him.”</p><p>“I agree, sir. Why should we hide from muggles when we’re the ones with power? It makes no sense at all.” Tom replied before taking a bite of steak. “If you don’t mind my asking, Mr. Malfoy, is it true that the German muggle dictator is really Grindelwald in disguise? I’ve heard such rumors recently.” He asked shrewdly before taking another bite of his breakfast. Antonius roared with laughter.</p><p>“Oh, the cleverness of Grindelwald. No, it isn’t him in disguise, and he didn’t use the imperius curse either. Do you know, he duped that muggle bastard into believing that if he takes over the muggle world and eradicates “undesirable” populations he would be Grindelwald’s right-hand man! He even has the stupid oaf believing that he will be taught magic by Grindelwald himself once the deed is done.” Mr. Malfoy cackled again. Abraxas and Tom both roared with laughter alongside the older gentleman.</p><p>Lucinda and Allura both remained silent for the sake of acting like ladies, but Tom did not fail to notice the smirk that had escaped Allura’s plump lips as she chewed her eggs.</p>
