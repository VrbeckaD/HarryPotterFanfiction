          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco is young and free. He's wild and grows his hair. He streaks the tips green, Slytherin green. He wears it pulled back while he works on a case.<br/>
He runs away from home when his father is put in prison.<br/>
He comes home when his mother sells his childhood home.<br/>
Draco is wild and free and no one can stop him.<br/>
"Fucking try." He tells everyone. It's his life, his story.<br/>
He moves to Paris for a while, and apprentices in potions and curses from an Arabian wizard.<br/>
He's Draco fucking Malfoy and he's young.<br/>
He goes back to Britain to become a curse breaker, learning tricks from Bill and Fleur.<br/>
Draco re-does his hair, more green. He adds blue this time. It's longer too.<br/>
He parties the muggle way every Friday he can. He dances and drinks and loves.<br/>
And Draco loves with passion.<br/>
He has adventures, he makes new friends. He has heartbreak, but loves anyway.<br/>
The scarred tattoo on his arm means nothing, but the other tattoos do. The symbols and stars and numbers.<br/>
He turns 25, and starts to teach at Hogwarts.<br/>
He's older, wiser.<br/>
He sees Potter, that first night and smiles. Truly, smiles. Potter smiles back.<br/>
4 months later and they're kissing. And they kiss a lot.<br/>
Draco loves his Harry. His.<br/>
2 years later and Draco goes back to curse breaking. A year later he's married to Harry Potter, and he has two sons, Scorpius and James.<br/>
He goes back to Hogwarts because he's a father and a husband, and he wants his family.<br/>
He teaches Potions and subs for Charms, and he's happy.<br/>
The nightmare is over, it's all a daydream.<br/>
Draco dyes his hair green for the last time.<br/>
But he's still a Slytherin.<br/>
Draco turns 39 and his sons are now his students as well.<br/>
Draco is getting older, but he's in love. He's happy no matter how much his bones creak.<br/>
He's 48 and one son is following his footsteps and the other is a Quidditch player.<br/>
His hair is turning gray and Harry's is too, but they're in love.<br/>
Draco is old and kind and still a pain in everyone's ass.<br/>
Draco tells his grandkids the stories, all of them. Harry does to.<br/>
Draco is happy.<br/>
