    <p>“Oi, Malfoy!” someone yelled at Draco, followed by the rush of hurried, loud feet within the hallway. </p><p>	Shit.</p><p>	“Malfoy!” </p><p>	Draco had that voice deeply ingrained into his memory. Walk faster. Maybe he will go away. </p><p>	“I know you can hear me!”</p><p>	Of course he won't, genius. </p><p>	Draco turned into the direction of the hurried steps that belonged to the annoyance. “What do you want, Potter?” he sneered loudly, while taking notice of the annoying lack of effect it had on the boy in front of him. Potter hurried to catch up with him, his breath quickening. The students within the hall didn't even glance at the pair, who were usually this cordial to each other.<br/>
  <br/>
“I need to talk to you,” Potter hushed, leaning in against the passing students within the hall. </p><p>	“And why would I ever talk to the likes of you?” Draco responded to the absurd request. </p><p>	Potter leaned into Draco’s space, seeming determined to have a private moment. "It's important, Malfoy.” </p><p>	“And I am sure to someone like you, anything seems to be worth your time, but, unfortunately for you, my time is not worth this conversation,” Draco said smoothly, enjoying the effect his remarks had on the boy in front of him, who clenched his jaw in aggravation. </p><p>	The students within the halls began to thin as students hurried to their classes. Potter, being unpredictable for a change, actually attempted to calm himself by breathing in one deep breath with minimal eyeroll. Draco took this as a cue to further instigate with, “I can assure you, anything you have to say to me would only be worth my time if I was taking a shit while we conversed,”  he finished. Draco turned to walk to his class while Potter began to walk beside him, mumbling something under his breath about blond gits. Draco politely assumed Potter was talking about someone else.  </p><p>	“I can assure you,” Potter began, “that this is very important-”</p><p>	“And why would I care if you think something is of any importance?” Draco calmly interrupted, stopping the pair. “Do excuse me, Potter, I have somewhere to be. Which, when you think about it, anywhere is better than here. Enjoyed our little chat,” Draco turned and walked confidently away has the rest of the students still in the halls weaved around him. </p><p>	“Malfoy, listen-” Potter followed, to Draco’s growing agitation.</p><p>	“I know you enjoy our spats as much as the next eavesdropping twat-" Draco snapped at the students who were enjoying the show- "but truly, Potter, do I need to insult you on your choice of friends or on your recent temper lately before you take a hint?” Draco snapped at the following boy, his amusement turning into anger. Potter, much to Draco's dismay, showed no signs of giving up.</p><p>	“Mal-”</p><p>	“Oh, I know,” Draco interrupted turning to the boy hurrying behind him “how about we skip the usual insults and I just insult you on your pathetic excuse for a family?”</p><p>	“Malfoy. Shut. Up.” Potter growled.</p><p>	“I’ll do something even better, as a contest to our friendship, Potter,” Draco then turned and made his way to his class, counting on Potter’s temper to keep him from following him. It was not long before Draco heard determined footsteps behind him, then quicker, more rushed steps, before he was roughly stopped by Potter with a strong grip on his arm.     </p><p>	“You know about what happens in the Room of Requirement,” the boy growled quietly, turning Draco to face him.  </p><p>	Fuck. </p><p>	Draco’s heart turned heavy in his chest and dropped into his stomach. A cold sweat broke along his back. The usual noise of the students within the large hall faded away until there was just himself. Draco could feel his heart beat in his figure tips as he clenched his fist tightly.     </p><p>	“I have no idea what you are talking about,” Draco began, moving threateningly close to Potter, lowering his voice to a harsh whisper, “but even if I did, I would have enough brains to not mention it in a hallway where any other students late for their class can overhear.” </p><p>	“But-”</p><p>	“I would be more discreet about any and all matters having to with this certain subject, I would also take a gift when I am given one without question or needless scramble,” Draco growled, making their conversation seem like a heated argument to the outside eye. To see the two of them fighting in the halls was a regular occurrence, and would not be too largely noticed by the passing students. To see Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy simply having a conversation in between classes would be...shocking to the rest of the student body. The last thing Draco needed was to be seem as out of ordinary by anyone at this time.</p><p>	“Now, Potter, I must be leaving,” Draco turned pointedly away.</p><p>	“No!” Potter gripped Draco's arm to roughly pull him closer. “Why haven’t you told Umbridge yet? You’ve known for weeks now!” </p><p>	Draco could feel his ears warm and his stomach turn at the casualness of Potter's accusation, anyone, student or professor, could overhear and ruin what advantage Draco has gained with ease. His temper snapped in fear with- “Actually, I have known the entire time, and if I wanted to, I could have all of your little army carving lines into their bodies until there’s not a single inch of them unscarred!” Draco snapped. </p><p>	“Then why haven’t you?” Potter challenged, tightening his grip on Draco’s bicep. Draco shoved Potter into the wall by the front of his shirt with both of his fist. Potter grasped at the fists at his collar, his back knocked against the bricks of the hall, his bag and its contents strewn across the floor. </p><p>	“Potter, listen to me very carefully, do not say a word,” Draco threateningly hushed. “I will let go of you, you will walk away, am I perfectly clear?” Frustration radiated from him as he clenched his teeth. Potter glared defiantly at the taller boy. Draco could always cause Potter to act on his temper, with his taunts and insults. Draco knew how to push Potter into any situation; with the right taunts, Potter can be malleable through his temper. Draco also knew how far Potter's temper can drive him, because his temper, his anger, drives his determination. </p><p>	There was no point in trying to deny Potter's accusation, Potter could force Draco's hand in this with ease. That was for sure. Potter was too determined to get answers, Potter needed to be controlled. </p><p>	Potter squirmed under Draco's grip, uncomfortable against the wall of the hall. The two boys stared at each other, each waiting to make their move. </p><p>	"Malfoy-" </p><p>	"Shut up, I'm thinking," was Draco's response to the complaint. Potter shut his mouth as Draco thought about the consequences of this new revelation. </p><p>	“Potter…not here, anyone can walk by and then we would both be fucked. I’ll contact you later and we can talk then...alone! Okay?” Draco negotiated, softening his tone and his grip. The look in Potter’s eyes flashed with anger, before settling into a resolved, cold understanding. Draco’s only warning was a slight nod from Potter, before he was shoved away. </p><p>	“Fine,” Potter jabbed at Draco, before squaring his shoulders and moving to his bookbag on the floor. Draco watched dumbly as Potter finished calmly picked up his things, surprised that this actually worked. Potter straightened from his position on the floor, then turned and looked at Draco, who was still staring. Potter nodded and Draco turned away from his cold look and hurried away, his breath quickening. He walked quickly through the bricked halls of the school, late for his next class. He turned the corner and could swear he felt eyes ranking his back as footsteps behind him became loud. </p><p>	Draco turned, his heart pounding in his chest, but no one was there. There was no Dark Lord, no Father, and no Potter making more of a tangled mess then there already was. </p><p>	Draco took a slow breath in, calming himself down. No one had overheard them, he was safe. For now. </p><p>	Turning back to continue his walk to charms, Draco made his way down the hallways of his school. The halls were quiet, as most of the students were in class and those who were running late left Draco alone to his thoughts.  </p><p>	Potter as of late had been less and less predictable. Usually he can make the more reasonable decision, if he is not being instigated. However, Potter might have been so intrigued with Draco's move that he did not mind drawing the attention of every student in Hogwarts. Paranoia at Potter's rash behavior clawed at Draco's back. What was stopping Potter from stopping Draco in the halls again, demanding answers that Draco didn't know? Drawing the attention of anyone, everyone, to the fact that Draco is a traitor. With that in mind, Draco turned down a hall and began to take the longest and least predictable path possible to Charms. At the very least, he would have a chance to think.<br/>
  <br/>
Draco had quite the predicament on his hands. Potter was aware of his knowledge about his little army. Not only that, but Potter was confident enough not only to confront Draco about it, but also to tell Draco the location of these training sessions, something Potter would only do if he was absolutely sure Draco knew all of the information beforehand. This could only mean that Potter knew Draco had been sitting on the information and had not used this information for his own gain. There was no point in Draco even trying to deny Potter’s accusations.  </p><p>	How did Potter know? He was careful, he was always careful, his status depended on it. He knew his entrance into the Frog-Lady’s graces were absolutely necessary when he first realized the Ministry had moved to take control over Hogwarts. This was a pathetic attempt to remain in  control of the people, with Potter turning up with a dead student in the middle of the Quidditch Field screaming Voldemort, and Dumbledore's recent mysterious disappearances, unrest was common.</p><p>	Draco felt a chill go down his spine before settling in his chest. He was there when Potter returned with Cedric, he remembers the screams and tears Potter released so publicly over the Hufflepuff. Draco recalled his own cold, paralyzing fear at his first sight of death. The sorrow Potter had shown was so raw, so unconditional, that Draco did not stop shaking until deep into the night. </p><p>	Harry Potter was right. The Dark Lord did return that night, and left a wake of misery in his own celebration that continued- </p><p>	Draco couldn't breathe. He couldn't walk. A small girl, a child even in the eyes of Draco, looking into him and begging for life as she watched her family struggle to fight against ropes held by magic- </p><p>	Her mother hanging by her neck, her eyes lifeless and large, seeing nothing-</p><p>	Her father, too stocked to move, eyes already glassy-</p><p>	Draco's hands were shaking, his breathe stuck under the pressure of his chest, his heart straining to beat, his vision blurred, dark at the edges-  </p><p>	He just wanted it all to stop.</p><p>	He would make it stop.  </p><p>	Draco turned his thoughts away from the unthinkable, shutting them down and slipping into a distant place where he was untouchable, even to his own memories. </p><p>	Draco turned his focus to Potter and the problem he proposed. What Draco truly did not understand, was Potter’s undying resilience in the face of tragedy. Perhaps, Draco realized as he resumed his walk to class, that was the reason Draco underestimated Potter. True, Potter’s temper snapped more easily than in the past, but he was more observant than ever. </p><p>	Well shit, Draco thought. Potter must have been aware of Draco’s knowledge of the army for a least a couple of weeks now, but he did nothing to change the army’s tactics at all. Which means, Potter wanted to see how dedicated to his secret Draco was. Potter could easily know that Draco has been covering for Dumbledore's Army since they first started meeting, making the rest of Umbridge’s minions run around in circles. Potter just manipulated Draco into playing his entire hand, and by simply doing nothing but observing.</p><p>	Obviously I’ve underestimated Potter, that or he is just simply stupid.</p><p>	It was a bold move, Draco had to admit, giving your enemy all of the power just to see how they play. It was a smart move.</p><p>	Draco had to make a decision: what in the fuck was he going to tell Potter? The truth? Could Potter be trusted? He and Potter had always had a relationship of extremes; would Potter feel some odd sort of nostalgia and sympathize with Draco’s cause?</p><p>	He was confident that Potter would keep his secret, if for nothing else that Potter had almost no one to tell that could incriminate Draco or challenge his status. Of course, it would still be a huge pain in his ass if Potter had told his shadows. This was less predictable; Potter was inseparable from Granger and Weasley, but lately he had been more withdrawn. Draco was confident he could persuade Potter not to tell their now shared secret if Draco just managed to talk to the boy. </p><p>	Draco finally arrived to the door in which Charms were held. He paused at the door, hand on the handle, listening in for an opportunity to enter unnoticed as possible. He waited until he heard Flitwick begin having students practice the charm for the day and slipped into the class with ease. He took his normal seat in the back of the large room, nodding at Professor Flitwick who was still at the front of the classroom. </p><p>	Draco was grateful for the lack of other Slytherin students in this class, the other Slytherin students that were in the class kept to themselves, which, at times like these, made Draco grateful for the quite moment. Draco took notice of the charm being reviewed for O.W.Ls, a simple ignition charm they learned in first year. A cauldron containing a small bundle of easily flammable dried grass was on Draco's desk in the back. Draco began to hurriedly take out his notes for the class, trying to appear productive.      </p><p>	“Mr. Malfoy…Malfoy?” Flitwick was standing in front of Draco's desk, having notice Draco's tardiness. Draco paused, unsure if he was about to be scowled. </p><p>	“Yes Professor?”</p><p>	“The Fire-Making Charm? We are reviewing it for our O.W.Ls?” the man further included. </p><p>	Blink, “...yes?”</p><p>	“Have you been able to properly conjure the charm?” Professor Flitwick gently prodded with patience that made Draco envious.</p><p>	Draco turned to his cauldron, looking for his wand for an embarrassing amount of time before finding it in his robes, Flitwick remaining patience the whole time. Draco found his wand, “Incendio,” he spelled. The contents of his cauldron lit with ease. He turned to his Professor who was observing calmly. </p><p>	“Well, done,” the Professor praised, "you may now begin on reviewing your notes for the next exam." </p><p>	“Thank you Professor,” Draco nodded, pulling out his textbook and parchment to take notes. </p><p>	Professor Flitwick moved on to the next student and Draco was left with his thoughts once again. He attempted to seem productive against his hurried thoughts. Draco had to make a decision soon, in order to take action. Potter could, most likely, be trusted. Draco knew Potter, maybe not as friends, but Draco had always observed Potter from afar, he was confident in his knowledge of Potter.</p><p>	Plus, having an ally would be...nice. Having someone to confide in, even if it was simply a share of a common secret, would lessen the burden on Draco's shoulders. Having someone to talk to, someone without an ulterior motive, someone that Draco didn't have to constantly track and be three steps ahead. The experience of having a possible friendly ally would make Draco's life seem less lonely. Draco needed that. Badly.</p><p>	Parkinson goes silent at random times of the day, closing off and just staring at nothing at all. Draco couldn't burden her with anything, not with the tragedy that happened over the summer. Goyle and Crabb were not to be trusted, even if they were loyal to Draco, they have their own families. Even then, neither of them could understand the pressure Draco was under, both from families with different status than him. Nott could relate, but Draco wouldn't trust him, he was too hard to read. Flint was too boisterous, he and his family were eager to get ahead. Paranoia clawed at Draco constantly.       </p><p>	There was no possible way Draco could ever confide in a fellow Slytherin student, even if they would be the ones to most understand. No, they had their own families to serve and protect. Draco knew, without a doubt, that their acquaintanceship could only go so far. It was an understanding throughout most of the house. Please, don’t give me any information I can use against you, because then I would have to. </p><p>	Potter would make a good ally. Draco could trust him. </p><p>	Draco now had a course of action, thankfully. He would have to tell Potter some version of the truth, but not enough to have the boy pity him. Potter would have to see him as an equal, not as someone to save. Merlin knows Potter didn't need someone else to be a savor to, Potter needed an equal. Draco could be his equal. Class ended, Draco was the first out of the door, acting as normal as possible, as if he was not thinking of making nice with the Dark Lord’s most dangerous enemy. </p><p>	Draco continued down the hall, keeping to the edge while other students milled around him, lowering their eyes and quieting their voices. There was a time when Draco would appreciate the authority given to him, but now he knows that such authority equals unwanted attention. He plays the part well, he knows, but the constant attention sends chills down his spine and makes everything sharp. </p><p>	Draco, for simple good measure, snaps at the younger students to hurry to class. Even the older students stay clear of him, knowing he has the ear of Umbridge and as Prefect, he could hold his own. Draco has been known to cause students to get detention, though, he does his best to avoid putting any student through the horrid abuse Umbridge calls discipline. Draco has never put anyone younger than himself in detention, they are already scared enough as is.  He really only puts Gryffindors into detention, who seem, as a whole, to not approve of Draco's authority. This made Draco more enemies than not. Stupid. </p><p>	Draco walks his usual path to the large greenhouse that is the classroom of  Herbology. Draco always takes the door closes to Charms and walks around the building outside instead of walking through the corridor, the walk is peaceful and Draco can be alone, without any roles to play. The idea of being truly unobserved for just a few moments is worth having a predictable schedule to the outside eye.       </p><p>	Draco is met with the warm smell of grass, companied by a pleasant breeze the second he steps outside. Clouds engulf the sky with bright white, providing a plain backdrop to rest of the world, making the landscape look overtly bright with deep greens, similar to the color of the furniture in the Manor's. The contrasting greens play against each other; the lightness of the grass and the dark greens of the forest. The lake looks dark blue now, almost black, similar to the fountain water in the gardens at night when Draco would look at out his bedroom window which looked out onto the Manor's expansive gardens. </p><p>	Draco allows his mind to drift back to a distant memory, letting his guard down, comfortable in the privacy of his walk. He thought back to a time when his home was not a prison, a time before the Dark Lord entered his life, a time when his home was still a home. The warmth provided as Draco lounged in front of the fireplace, reading while his parents sat in their respected chairs, drinking wine and discussing this and that. The warm breeze that would past during a summertime breakfast out in the garden. Mother and Father listening to him talk on and on about whatever he had to say, nodding and hardly hiding their amusement at their son.    </p><p>	Draco continued his walk around the base of the castle, not meeting anyone else on his lengthy route as he walks down towards Herbology. The world is quiet, even if only for a couple moments. </p><p>	Draco entered the greenhouse, weaving around the other students who arrived before him. He takes his usual seat that was usually reserved for him by Zabini. Zabini, the perfect representation of tall, dark, and handsome, was the only other Slytherin in his Herbology class, which made their suffering mutual. Potter was also in this class, but, luckily, he paid Draco no mind, at least, not more than usual. A sly, snippy remark or five might pass Potter's lips, but Draco retorts back in his usual manner.</p><p>	If any other Slytherins were in the class, Draco would be more inclined to start a pissing contest. Thankfully, Zabini was a quiet person, and preferred conversation over public confrontation, so Draco did not feel the need to instigate a fight with Potter. However, that did not mean Draco refuses to rise to the bait, as Potter is teasing with his overly stupid remarks. </p><p>	The class continued as normal with Professor Sprout instructing the students to begin creating a diagram for their own planter boxes. Draco begins to work on his, sketching with a piece of charcoal on a piece of parchment, and the classroom grows increasingly quiet as the students around him follow suit. Draco allowed his mind to concentrate solely on the task at hand, the diagram began to take shape as Draco planed which plants should go where. </p><p>	 The class ended too soon and Draco was once again forced to return to the world. He walked with Zabini out of the greenhouse to the castle in their expected silence. </p><p>	The students all followed the same path up to the castle for dinner, the rest of their peers chatting and laughing warmly against the chilled air of dust. The sky had dipped into a deep blue, making the grass look black. Draco walked his usual pace, but, as Zabini began to fall behind, Draco slowed his pace to match his fellow Slytherin’s. Draco walked in step with Zabini up the path, before glancing over, catching Zabini’s eye, asking for permission. Zabini nodded, allowing Draco to give him this small comfort. The two of them fell behind the rest of the students, allowing them a quiet moment in the almost dark.  </p><p>	The two boys enjoyed the simple act of walking without any roles to play, not saying anything, using the setting sun and the deep blues to hide behind. This had become a weekly routine, one which Draco enjoyed, however pathetic it may be. Zabini had yet to converse with any of the other students for more than a couple of minutes since returning to Hogwarts from the summer break. </p><p>	“Have you done the essay for Charms?” Zabini breached their usual silence. </p><p>	Draco tried to hind his surprise with a simple, “Of course.” This was the first time the either of them had attempted at conversation during these walks; if Zabini wanted to talk, he would.<br/>
 <br/>
This was how most of the conversations had gone with Zabini as of late. Draco did his best to allow him to talk as little as possible, assuming the dark skinned student was trying to handle the rise of the Dark Lord and how this affect him and his mother as best he can. Zabini was in a very unique position, his only friends were children of Death Eaters, however, his mother was only recently introduced to the Malfoy's social circle four years ago by her late husband. The shift in social atmosphere had changed since then, as well as the treatment of the Zabinis by their "friends."   </p><p>	The two of them were the last to walk up the pathway and through the large double doors that lead into the main hallway and further into the Great Hall. They heard her before they saw her. A small girl, curled at the foot of the large stairs that branch off from the main hallway, weeping in pain. She was nursing a bloody hand wrapped sloppily in a rag. </p><p>	Draco heart leaped in his chest as his mind is gripped by memories. </p><p>	He sees a small girl, bloody, begging, screaming, incoherent, reaching for her mother's feet, hanging by an invisible rope- </p><p>	Draco gasped for a breath just out of reach, feeling the stillness next to him. </p><p>	Draco tried to step in between Zabini and the sight of the girl, a feeble attempt, but Zabini had already followed the sound to the grueling sight of the girl. </p><p>	Zabini stopped, visibly losing the breath from his lungs at the sight, Draco could see the color drain from Zabini's face. Zabini went still, not breathing. </p><p>	The girl stopped her weeping, Draco could feel her eyes on the back of his neck, the silence stops being a comfort in this moment as everyone stopped breathing. </p><p>	Zabini stared, shaking. Any feelings Zabini had been pushing away flood to him, shoving their way up and out. </p><p>	“Zabini-" Draco comforted, Zabini was harshly gasping for breath, shaking violently, "Blaise…go to the restroom and get yourself together,” Draco placed his hands on the shoulders of the shaking boy, grounding him.  </p><p>	“But...,” Zabini sobbed. His shoulders were visibly shaking now, too much for the boy, he was gasping for breath in between harsh sobs that shook his entire frame. </p><p>	“Listen to me, you need to dry your face and go to dinner, okay? Can you do that for me? I can help her, I can, but you need to cover for me, okay?” Draco took Zabini’s face in his hands. Brown eyes met grey, panic met calm. </p><p>	“Do it for the girl, you can help her, you can do something about this,” Draco continued, “the girl needs help - help me help her,” Draco finished. If Zabini knew he was being manipulated, he didn't care, he was too numb, he allowed himself to be malleable to Draco's orders. Blaise nodded, turning away from Draco's touch, hurrying to the Great Hall to make excuses for Draco. </p><p>	Draco watched Zabini as he hurried down the hall before turning back to the girl, who was still weeping against the pain. Draco, knowing his reputation, half thought about leaving her, he couldn't have whispers about him around the castle. The sound of a weeping child violated him again, turning his stomach painfully.</p><p>	With that in mind, Draco slowly walked to the girl before squatting in front of her. She was dressed in muggle jeans that Draco sees other students wearing and a simple sweater. Her brown hair was loose in a long braid, her glassy brown eyes glared at Draco with almost an animalistic fury. </p><p>	“What’s your name?” he spoke gently to her, he kept his body language neutral, as to not scare her. </p><p>	The girl stayed silent, wide eyes looked up at him, he waited. </p><p>	“What do you care?” the bitterness poured out of her tiny voice. </p><p>	“How many lines?” he asked, ignoring the gab.</p><p>	“Sixty,” the girl answered.</p><p>	“I need to see them. Will you be okay with that?” Draco gently asked.</p><p>	The girl gripped the wound tighter, still glaring at Draco, she considered his help, she also considered telling him to fuck off. Draco waited, wanting to be an understanding person, but he was only half invested in this situation as is, having shock drive his earlier actions. Draco's knees began to twinge uncomfortably at the position, and Draco thought about leaving the girl to deal with her wound herself. She couldn't be younger than a second year, she could probably heal herself if she stopped crying for five minutes. Draco was about to stand whenever the girl nodded and lifted her right hand for Draco's inspection.</p><p>	Draco removed the rag gently, he broke out in a cold sweat as the smell of blood invaded his senses even before he finished unwrapping the bloody rag. He was taken back to a night of blood and screams, his sweat cold on his neck. Draco finished removing the rag with a short gasp. This girl was small, making sixty lines seem like eighty. The lines had repeated over, over, over so many times that the words were indescribable. The wound being a singular, large carved of skin, which blood still easily seeped from. Blood poured out of the large wound, dripping onto the floor. Dripping from a hanging mother's body, onto a screaming child-<br/>
 <br/>
“Can I fix this?” Draco asked gently against the screaming of memories inside his head, loosening his grip on the tiny hand. </p><p>	The girl gives her permission. Draco pulled his wand from his bag at his side, “Tergeo,” Draco began, clearing any dried blood from the seeping wound. </p><p>	“Vulnera Sanentur,” Draco continued, ignoring the sound of the girl hissing between her teeth. The blood returned to the wound, while the skin loosely knitted itself together. Her skin was together enough to stop the bleeding, but that was all.</p><p>	“You need to go to Madam Pomphrey as soon as possible, she can help with the scarring,” Draco ordered, he continued with, “why didn’t you go see her earlier?”   <br/>
                 <br/>
“I…don't want to bother her, Umbridge says there is no lesson if she heals us right after detention,” was the answer.</p><p>	Draco nodded, feeling a sick twist. Draco transfigured a bandage out of parchment to cover the sensitive skin. She gasped through the pain as Draco wrapped her hand with practice.  He reached into his front pocket, pulling out a handkerchief for her. She accepted the offering, wiping her tear-stained face. </p><p>	“What did you do to make her so angry?” Draco asked, still wrapping her hand. </p><p>	“I called her a stupid frog-faced bitch,” was the answer.</p><p>	Draco froze, his hands frozen mid-activity while he processes the information, not quite sure if he heard right. “...Well, that would do it,” was all Draco can say to her. The girl shrugged, Draco's curiosity got the better of him,  “is there a reason why you called Umbridge a frog-faced bitch?” Draco quipped. </p><p>	“Do I really need a reason?” asked the girl.</p><p>	Draco allowed laughter to escape from him, letting his guard down with- ”no, definitely not.”<br/>
 <br/>
The pair sat in silence as Draco finished bandaging the abuse.</p><p>	“Can I asked you a question?” the girl spoke up.</p><p>	“You already did,” Draco said with a smile.</p><p>	The girl almost lost her eyes while rolling them at Draco’s stupidity. Draco could feel his smile grow until the whites of his teeth showed. Giddiness bloomed in his chest, this was the first time in a long time that he had honestly enjoyed himself. He does his best to hide it.  </p><p>	"Why are you helping me?" asked the girl. </p><p>	“Do I really need a reason?” Draco played back on the earlier response, finishing up the bandage. The girl remained quiet after that, her chain lowering to rest on her knees. Draco watched as the girl flexed her hand against the bandage, testing the stretched skin underneath. He should leave, he has done what he needs to do, but he couldn't talk himself into leaving. He was comfortable here with this small stranger. </p><p>	Draco does his best to be graceful, but, being so wiry, he does not succeed, but he took the space next to the young, spunky girl. He allowed his knees to bend comfortably while wrapping his arms loosely around them to clasp his hands together, letting his knees drop against his arms. He tried to ignore the voice in the back of his mind, don't trust her, stupid, you don't even know her. What harm could come from talking? Let alone a small girl, who no one would believe if she did tell, right? Surely, no harm would come to Draco if he just talks to the girl. </p><p>	“Besides,” Draco continued awkwardly, “you did call Umbridge a frog faced-bitch. Anyone would be nice to you after that.” </p><p>	The girl gawked beside him, Draco tried not to cringe at his own forwardness, stupid. </p><p>          “What house are you in?” Draco asked, trying to talk about literally anything else.</p><p>	"I didn't tell you my name, what makes you think I'm going to tell you what house I'm in?" replied the                               girl, pointing out the obvious. </p><p>	Draco's mouth quirked into a smirk. He was surprise at how much he is enjoying this, this playful conversing without weaving in and out of subtle threats and double meanings. He could do with more of this. But he knew that in his world, he was not able to enjoy this for too long, he was not allowed to make friends. One could only be distracted for so long.</p><p>	“Well then, Mystery Girl from a Mystery House, I suggest you try not to aggravate Umbridge anytime soon; no matter how entertaining it may be,” the time was up for Draco, time to return to his world. </p><p>	The girl's lips lifted into a smile, and she gave a small nod. Gathering himself, Draco rose and mentioned that she was welcome to follow, she rose and the two unlikely pair made their way to the Great Hall.</p><p>	“So I take it you don’t like Umbridge very much?” inquired Draco, clinging to what was left of the conversation before they separate at dinner.</p><p>	“Whatever gave you that idea?” quipped the girl. Draco was starting to like her.</p><p>	“That still doesn’t seem like a decent reason to poke the dragon,” was the older boy’s reply.</p><p>	The girl shrugged, "the look on her face was worth the detention," was the reply. Draco nodded, understanding the feeling. </p><p>	The two of them walk in comfortable silence, before they get to the Great Hall the girl tried to give Draco back his handkerchief, "don't worry about it, I have more," was his reply.  </p><p>	The unlikely pair entered the Great Hall and went on their separate ways, not a word spoken.</p><p>	Draco walked with confidence to the Slytherin table, joining his large social circle with ease. Zabini had saved him a seat on his left, Parkinson, Crabbe, Goyle and Nott were also there. <br/>
 <br/>
Draco sat with Blaise on this left, and Crabbe on his right, with his back to the wall. This gave him a perfect sight of the Gryffindor table, and Potter.<br/>
 <br/>
Crabbe and Goyle talked across the table about a topic that Draco didn't bother to follow. Nott was frowning over a complicated Potions Theory book that Draco had read last month and didn't understand, so he naturally recommended the series. </p><p>	Parkinson sat next to Nott, directly across from Draco. She wasn't touching the food on her plate, simply staring into nothing, as if trying to slip into nothingness herself. Draco tried to catch her eye, but Pansy stayed still, almost looking through Draco. Draco reached out, he touch her translucent hand to bring her attention forward. "Try the lamb, it's your favorite," Draco urged. Pansy followed Draco's request wordlessly, not even bothering to put up the effort to reply. </p><p>	Draco followed Pansy's movement while he ate his dinner, making sure she wasn't just moving the food around on her plate for appearances. Everyone continued with their dinner, wrapped in their own worries. Blaise must have felt confident in this fact “I don’t think I can handle much more of this,” he whispered to Draco. Giving the blonde a chance to ignore him. A way out, if Draco needed it. The words only traveled between the two, a private conversation. </p><p>	This was the first real confrontation Draco was faced with the subject. He could not offer real support, Blaise must of known that, but Draco could give Blaise his understanding. This did not come at a price.<br/>
   <br/>
“You have always been more capable than you think you are,” Draco finally responded, ignoring his instincts. Carefully being vague, but doing his best to offer what little support he can. He continued with, “My mother always says, ‘You will conquer what you have to,’ Blaise, you will get through this because you have to,” Draco finished.</p><p>	“Do I, though?” Blaise asked, the meaning clear. </p><p>	He understood exactly what Blaise was toying with. Draco remained silent, turning to Blaise, facing him, facing his own past self. He could not allow Blaise, his friend, to continue down this train of thought. Draco, he should, he could, help him. But at what risk? </p><p>	“You can handle this,” Draco offered lamely. Knowing, deep in his diaphragm, that he would have to decide a course of action. Knowing that Draco did not actually provide any comfort for the stricken boy.<br/>
The two Slytherins continued eating, Blaise remained stonily silent after Draco’s small effort at comfort. The rest of their circle continued with their conversation, allowing them privacy.<br/>
     <br/>
Dinner was a lamb stew with bread, delicious, but not a delicacy. Draco allowed the conversation to continue without him, allowed his eyes to drift across the dining hall, past the ornate windows that led to the outdoors, his eyes fell on a dark skinned boy with unruly hair and green eyes. </p><p>	Potter was sitting in between Longbottom and Weasley. Granger sat across from Weasley, giving Potter the perfect window to see the Slytherin. Potter enjoyed his stew, while Granger talked with Weasley about something or another. Longbottom was reading a large textbook, which, from his distance, Draco could guess the book was over Longbottom’s favorite subject; Herbology. Nobody was paying Potter any mind, nobody was paying Draco any mind, now was the time to make a move.         </p><p>	Draco continued to watch Potter, keeping an eye out for any wandering eyes from his social circle, but everyone was in conversation, or minding only themselves. Potter finally looked up from his stew, making eye contact with Draco. Draco gave a slight nod of acknowledgement, before shifting his eyes to the exit of the Great Hall and returning his eyes to Potter’s. Potter nodded in understanding. </p><p>	Draco broke eye contact to look down at his meal. He continued eating for a while before excusing himself. Draco walked out of the room and into the hall, praying that Potter waited before following him out.</p><p>	Draco continued to walk to the lavatory, slowing his pace to ensure Potter could follow discreetly. Once he heard the recognizable footsteps behind him, quickened his pace to the boy’s restroom. Draco checked the large lavatory to see if he had an audience, but, just has he had expected, everyone was still enjoying their dinner. </p><p>	After Potter entered, Draco motioned for him to remain quiet as Draco placed an Imperturbable Charm on the door. Draco tried to ignore the shaking of his hands, he did his best to appear confident and in control, not as if this very conversation could cost him and his family their lives. </p><p>	“We can talk freely now, but we only have a few moments,” Draco began, he walked toward the large sinks in the middle of the room, if for anything but for something to do, “anyone could try to come in here and notice the charm.”</p><p>	“Then why are you trying to talk about this now?” challenged Potter, following Draco.  </p><p>	“Have you mentioned this to anyone else?” was Draco’s calm response. Draco allowed Potter to see him in a casual pose, leaning against the sink and placing his hands on the sink behind him. In order for his relationship with Potter to change, Potter’s image of Draco had to change.       <br/>
  <br/>
“Would it have mattered if I did?” was Potter’s answer. Potter stood across from Draco, hands at his sides, in a neutral pose. This was good, Draco was expecting to have to deal with a Potter on the defense, but Potter had surprised him once again. </p><p>	Draco continued his relaxed, casual pose. He was doing his best to make Potter feel at ease. “Potter, I need to know, please don’t make this difficult,” Draco begged, keeping his hands on the sink behind him, gripping the edge in nervousness. He made himself seem more vulnerable that he was, he needed Potter to trust him to some small degree. </p><p>	“I know, I’m sorry. It’s just... you surprise me that’s all,” Potter stuttered, shuffling his feet and avoiding eye contact with the Slytherin. “No one else knows... I promise,” Potter finished, he looked up at Draco to further his swear.</p><p>	Draco took the opening, “You do not have to promise me anything, Potter, I trust you.” </p><p>	Potter’s eyes widen with the easiness of Draco’s trust, not that Draco had a choice, but Potter was not that inclusive. All of that frustration and temperament that Draco had witnessed earlier today was gone, leaving a softer version of the Gryffindor.        </p><p>	The two remained in silent for a beat, Draco’s heart was pounding for an indescribable reason, his blood running in his ears. He was nervous, but the conversation was going better than expected. Potter was being reasonable, almost predictable, why was Draco practically shaking with access energy? Draco was suddenly painfully aware that this was the first private moment the two boys have had since Draco can recall, even if the scenery was that of a lavatory, the lighting was what one could, possibly, maybe, call romantic.  </p><p>	“Can I see you later tonight?” Draco blundered. </p><p>	Shit.</p><p>	The moment Potter reacted to the words Draco realized what his request sounded like, what he had to look like, with his hands gripping the sink behind him and his chest out. His demeanor could easily be taken as flirtatious…actually, if Potter did not mistake this for flirting he was just a clueless idiot who would never find love even if he had the strongest love potion possible forced upon him. Unfortunately, Potter was slightly more intuitive.</p><p>	You are supposed to gain the trust of Potter, not try to swoon him in the night.</p><p>	This was not going according to plan. This was so very much against the plan. </p><p>	Potter was blushing, he tips of his ears turning an embarrassing shade of red. Draco had to fix this… somehow.</p><p>	Any ideas are welcomed.</p><p>	No genius social graces came to mind. </p><p>	So… naturally Draco did nothing. Allowing Potter to blush and blunder through this awkward experience alone. “Um… sure. Does the, the um, Room of Requirement sound okay? Around midnight?” Potter blundered. </p><p>	Draco moved his hands from the sink to fold in front of him, continuing to press his back against the sink.</p><p>	 “Agreeable,” Draco said. Like a fucking prick.  </p><p>	“Ok, see you then,” Potter agreed, walking backwards as awkward as humanly possible to the exit.</p><p>	“Until then,” Draco dismissed. Remaining by the sinks, praying for this moment to be over. </p><p>	Potter turned to the exit, but coming to the door, also came upon the Imperturbable Charm. The awkwardness lessen only slightly as Draco walked across the tiles of the room to remove the charm. Potter acknowledge his thanks with an inclination of his head, before leaving the lavatory.</p><p>	Draco returned to the sinks to wash his hands, the clear water flowing from the facet onto his sweating hands. Draco had to get a hold of himself in reference to Potter. However, this was new to both of the boys, blunders had to be expected, but, Draco was not used to having less than exceptional social skills. His words had always been his greatest weapon. </p><p>	After washing, the Slytherin made the walk to his common room. He would see Potter again later tonight, he could achieve his objectives then. The only sound his own footsteps echoing on the tiles of the castle. The school always had an out of world feel whenever there was only one set of footsteps. Thankfully, dinner was still continuing, so Draco made his way in silence.</p>
