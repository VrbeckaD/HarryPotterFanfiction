    <p> </p><p>James sits at the kitchen table, watching as Lily dances around the kitchen with little Harry standing on her toes, and he finds it hard to believe how lucky he is.<br/>
He doesn't exactly understand everything that happened with Voldemort- how could his baby have managed to defeat the most powerful wizard to ever live just by crying at him?<br/>
(A small part of him doesn't quite believe the Dark Lord is truly gone, and until he dies, he will be looking over his shoulder- but Lily doesn't need to know that, not now.)<br/>
For now, though, James doesn't need to understand. He has his beautiful wife and his beautiful baby boy, and the rest of the world can just piss off.</p>
