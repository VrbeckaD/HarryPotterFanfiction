    <p>Greetings fellow witches, wizards, and muggles alike!</p><p>If this story seems familiar, then yes, I am one of the original creators of the fanfic "Hogwarts Dark Bridal" that was originally published on our tumblr blog <b>http://hogwartsdarkbridal.tumblr.com/</b></p><p>Due to life and other such events, Madame and myself had to discontinue our HP/DL ask blog. However! Because I still wanted to continue the story of our OC's, I have decided to publish it here on this platform, that way those who have never come across our blog can read up on our characters and their adventures here!</p><p>I figured I'd start with the bio/synopsis of our girls and as always:</p><p>I do not own Diabolik Lovers or Harry Potter.</p><p>Diabolik Lovers is the sole property of ® Rejet and all characters belong to them.</p><p>Harry Potter is the sole property of ® J.K. Rowling and all characters belong to her.</p><p>The OC's mentioned in this story are the sole property of myself and Madame, and may not be used or distributed without our permission. Any unique spells or headcanons about the boys used in this story do belong to us as well, and may not be recreated without proper credit to us.</p><p> </p><p><b>Soul’s OC</b>: Kuroe Katsuragi, aka ‘Black Viper’</p><p>House: Slytherin, 6th year</p><p>Status: Shin Tsukinami’s Punching Bag</p><p>Blood Type: Muggleborn</p><p>Birthday: October 25</p><p>Hair Color: Black</p><p>Eye Color: Red</p><p>Height: 5’3”</p><p>Skin Color: Medium tone</p><p>Hair Style: Kept tied back in a ponytail</p><p>Markings: A black dot under each eye</p><p>Wand: Dragon heartstring, Cherry wood, 10 ½ inches</p><p>Patronus: Acromantula</p><p>This cunning girl is a Slytherin. Her ancestry stems from a traditional Japanese lineage of guardians from Mt. Katsuragi. They are well involved in the magical community, but they bear no magical talent themselves, being the equivalent of a Squib line. She is the first witch in her family to receive a letter granting her acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, after being banned from attending the school of Mahoutokoro in Japan. Her parents have not said why the wizarding school in Japan declined to accept her there, but it may have something to do with her genetics being a threat to the safety of the students…</p><p>Her exceptional athletic abilities have granted her a place on the house team, where she has been awarded the title of Captain in her fifth year. No one in school is aware of her Muggleborn blood status; the only keepers of her secret are Akari Motegi and Reiji Sakamaki. Due to her reserved nature, she prefers to be in the company of animals, which is why her favorite class is Care of Magical Creatures. Her hobbies include training for Quidditch, studying with her best friend Akari, and practicing Transfiguration with her Pygmy Puff “Lychee”.</p><p><b>Madame’s OC</b>: Akari Motegi, aka ‘Ravenclaw Vixen’</p><p> </p><p>Property of: Reiji Sakamaki</p><p>6th Year, Pureblood Ravenclaw</p><p>Height: 5’4</p><p>Eye Color: Grey</p><p>Hair Color: Brown with a green streak going down the right side. She keeps it pinned back with a clip so it’s not in her face.</p><p>Hair Length: Past her waist, just above her butt</p><p>Birthday: December 9th</p><p>Wand: Veela Hair, Redwood, 11 inches</p><p>Patronus: Fox</p><p>Akari comes from the very wealthy and very well established Motegi clan. She is the youngest of four, and sister to three older brothers. As the youngest she’s always gotten away with quite a bit, but as a result, has become the ‘black sheep’ of the family. She doesn’t particularly care though, since she’s much happier doing her own thing anyway. And despite it all, she has a very good relationship with her family. Her best bro is Yuma Mukami, because they both don’t give a flat fuck about anything, and have lots of fun together. She’s very proud to be a Ravenclaw, and certainly acts like one, as she is one of the top students in her class, and is an expert duelist. However, once outside the confines of the classroom, she has a rather loose set of lips, and curses like a sailor. It is something Reiji certainly does not approve of, and has tried on multiple occasions to ‘break’ said habit.</p><p>Now, on to the story!</p>
