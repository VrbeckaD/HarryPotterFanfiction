Harry had his wand jabbed into the blond's back. </p><p>"Mr. Potter, I have no idea what you mean." </p><p>"Your hand on his arm and guiding him around better not happen again." Harry thrust his wand into Lucius' back again. "You didn't want him, remember. I believe you and Draco rejected him. He's mine now." </p><p>"He's not a possession." Lucius was going to continue but Voldemort with his new wife, Minerva, was heading toward them. </p><p>"He's mine, Lucius, don't touch." Harry put his wand away. "How's married life treating you, Dad?"</p><p>"Very well. It would be better if you didn't threaten one of my top advisors even if he is being an idiot." Voldemort gave Lucius a warning look. </p><p>"Harry, I'm sure Lucius and Draco now realize what they turned down." Minerva had been surprised when both Malfroy men had rejected Severus submission to the Ministry to be courted but wasn't surprised that Harry took on the challenge of Severus Snape.</p><p>"Their loss, my gain.

Draco muttered by his father's right shoulder as they watched Harry join Severus.</p><p>Â </p><p>
