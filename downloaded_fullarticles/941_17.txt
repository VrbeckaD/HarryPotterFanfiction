  <b>LONDON MARCH 2007</b>
</p><p>
  <span>“Doctor! Doctor, is that you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Doctor turned around from where he was about to enter his TARDIS to see a young woman who looked to be about in her late twenties. She had tan skin, bushy brown hair pulled back in a ponytail, and was wearing overalls, a jumper, and combat boots. The sort of outfit one could wear on an adventure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I suppose that depends on who’s asking? Who might you be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m Hermione Granger. I just saw you take off your tie in front of a complete stranger. Why did you do that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To make a point. Tell me, Ms. Granger, do you generally make a habit of knowing someone’s name before they tell you?” The Doctor leaned against the TARDIS. This was interesting. Proving to Martha that he could time travel could wait.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Doctor, that would be telling! </span>
  <em>
    <span>Spoilers</span>
  </em>
  <span> must be avoided. Now, I </span>
  <em>
    <span>should </span>
  </em>
  <span>say, that we really </span>
  <em>
    <span>must </span>
  </em>
  <span>get going. Martha is waiting for us after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you know about Martha. Tell me, now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione</span>
  </em>
  <span> you are having way too much fun with this. We want him to take us with him, not blacklist us.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was only the over 900 years of travelling through time and space that let the Doctor keep his composure as someone who was previously completely and totally invisible to him via sight, sound, and smell (though that might have been the nearby dumpster) suddenly appeared. The young man who spoke also appeared to be late twenties, as did the blonde woman with him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who </span>
  <em>
    <span>are </span>
  </em>
  <span>you people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re your companions Doctor. You just haven’t met us yet. Pip pip. Let’s go meet Shakespeare. I’ve always wanted to see one of his plays but you kept saying I already had!” The blonde woman daintily reached into the Doctor’s pocket and took one of his TARDIS keys, easily opening what could very often be a very stubborn door. She then had the audacity to slip said key into the brassiere of her 16th century dress rather than return it(!) as she and her two compatriots walked into the TARDIS as if it were second nature.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Utterly flabbergasted, the Doctor followed.</span>
