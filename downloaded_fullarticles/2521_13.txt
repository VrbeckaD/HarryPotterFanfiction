    <p>Prologue</p>
<p>The devil goes by many names, Samael, Lucifer, Beelzebub, Belial, The Prince(ss) of Darkness, Satan, so many names for a being so despised by humanity. A being that God himself described as a perfect being, his most beautiful angel in heaven. Their genderless heavenly form with hair, wings, and eyes the color of light truly owned up to the title of Lightbringer. Then God created humans in his experiment with the garden of Eden, but they had no free will, only doing as God commanded. After tirelessly arguing with God, Samael rebelled against him, campaigning for free will for the mortals and all of God's creatures. Eve ate the apple in the Garden of Eden, but the rebellion failed. God, who loves all of his creations, gave Samael a task when the rebellion fell. They were now to be the ruler of hell, punishing the damned that exercised their free will to commit atrocious acts. It would be a daunting task, but Samael had been humbled by their failure and agreed to listen to their father's orders. On God's orders, Michael cast him into hell where Samael was no more, they became Lucifer the fallen one. Their features bathed in the light now became submerged in darkness. Their hair turned black as the darkness of hell, their eyes turned red, but their wings remained the now insufferable light they had been in heaven. Thus, I (Lucifer) took on the visage of a man and began God's plan as ruler of hell and the damned.</p>
<p>Many millennia later, I decided I needed a vacation from torturing souls in hell. Lilith, who had been with me since she left Adam, became a sister to me no matter how odd the mortals twisted our story. She agreed to watch over hell in my absence as long as I took a demon to watch over me. Leaving hell would surely be risky business if any of the archangels found out, especially Michael or Raziel. I decided to take my head servant Salem to the mortal realm in the form of a cat so they could guard me and be my butler when no one is watching. I would start a whole new life from the beginning, with the help of Azrael and it was going to be exciting! Azrael found a young girl scheduled to die soon who was apart of the magical community of Britain which would allow me to take her place. Lilith and I were reading about the current magical terrorist in Britain when Azrael appeared in all their glory. They looked as beautiful as ever with their dark hair like mine and steely gray eyes. Lilith instinctually left the room not wanting to see me leave or watch me moon over Azrael. They approached me and sat next to me where Lilith had been moments before. "Hello, Rae." I smiled.</p>
<p>"Luci," they breathed in hugging me in greeting. "Are you sure you are ready to do this?" they asked holding my face in their hands.</p>
<p>"I believe we all deserve a break no?" I countered them shocked at the question.</p>
<p>"Yes, but this child has a large destiny to fill. The family she is with right now is so abusive that she's going to die. Only a month from entering her magical school for the fourth time." they said so seriously.</p>
<p>"Oh?" I said getting closer. "Are you worried about little old me?" I teased trailing a line down their chest with my finger. "You know I can't die right?" I reassured, but they still looked unsatisfied at the thought of those mortals. "Alright, I will be taking over the body completely, but I guess I'll keep her blood to run some emancipation/inheritance tests with the goblins to get away from that family." They agreed happily as they pulled me into their lap and cradled my face.</p>
<p>"I will always worry for you. From when father created you to the rebellion to now. You will always be in my thoughts my morning star." they smiled and kissed me on the forehead and gently on the lips. "But it will make me feel better if you separate yourself from the family as soon as possible. I will be sending you a gift once you start school as well."</p>
<p>"A gift? You've been watching too many mortal shows." I teased. "My favorite gift will always be you," I said surprising Rae and myself. "I suppose it's time to go now. Can you put me in the body and near the bank if possible?" I asked.</p>
<p>"You read my mind. The sooner you are gone from those mortals the better." They nodded happily. "Be safe." they whispered as I faded from this realm.</p>
