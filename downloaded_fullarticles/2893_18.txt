    <p> «MUGGLES?!» Hestia shouted! No way she was going to spend more than a week together with those muggles!! She did not know how to act around them, she said. In addition the way Mad-Eye Moody had talked about the Dursleys beforehand, they seemed to be the worst sort of muggles existing!</p><p>Mad-Eye had announced to the entire room that he wanted her, Hestia Jones, to be one of the guardians of the Dursley family that morning. That was not Hestias intention at all when she had showed up for the meeting that day! She had reconed that there would be plenty of other people from the Order whom would simply have been overjoyed to be volunteering for the task for sure. She had much rather be in the guard that was going to take Harry Potter away from his muggle home forever.<br/><br/>It now dawned upon her that this had been the old Aurors plan all along. Harry Potters guard was already arranged apparantly, and she would not get any information on anything important regarding it. Now Mad-Eye had announced her name and suddenly the spotlight were on her. Hestia downright refused to do it and the two of them ended up having a rather big row about it in front of everybody. However, Moodys mind was absolutely set on her to be one of the guards. After a little while bickering about it, Kingsley Shacklebolt rose from his chair and calmly announced with his deep voice that he agreed with Mad-Eye. He told her that she was the best-qualified witch for the job and they had rather hoped she would not oppose to it.<br/><br/>All of a sudden it seemed she did not have a choice in the matter. Now she had to spend the next two full weeks reading up on Muggle Studies instead of looking forward to be seeing Harry Potter off together with the others.<br/><br/>After everything had calmed down a little Doris Crockford tried to come to Hestias rescue when she quietly, but enthusiastically, volunteered for the job in replacement of her. To Doris it seemed like the entire Dursley family were the long lost twin of Harry Potter and she simply wanted to adopt them all. However, Doris were outvoted by Mad-Eye. He firmly told her she could not bring any of her dozen odd cats along to the safe house, and after a short but quieter arguement with Mad-Eye about why not, she was defeated. Poor Doris was devastated. So was Hestia.<br/><br/>Hestia looked around the room, there really were no one else of the women who would be in a position to go undercover with the Dursley family for an unkonown peroid of time. They all had families to take care of, and she was the only one there whom was unmarried and without children. Moodys mind were determined by the fact that it should be a man and a woman whom were to be guarding the Dursleys.<br/><br/>Hestia finally resigned, at least she had been given an important task regarding Harrys family, so something kind of exciting was going to happen. Besides, she would probably be able to wish Harry Potter good luck at his muggle house in person before they left. Hestia sighed and decided she would give it her best, the Dursleys were the only living relatives of Harrys. Perhaps they were not as bad as Moody had described to them after all.<br/><br/>She realized that she had to change her entire mindset completely about theese muggles to be able to manage her job. Allthough she did not have much experience regarding any muggles. Nevertheless, she knew many half-bloods and both them and their families were allright enough.<br/><br/>Dedalus Diggle on the other hand had volunteered for the job immediately when Mad-Eye had announced that they needed two people to guard the Dursley family into a safe house. He certainly wanted to spend some time with Harry Potters muggle relatives and get to know them better. Everybody knew that he loved muggles, almost as much as Arthur Weasley. They all agreed to Dedalus beeing one of the two at once, assuming he would do very well indeed.<br/><br/>After the rather rough settlement with Hestia, Moody were now rather satisfied that this was finally done and agreed upon. The next thing they had to decide would be where in the world they could find a place that could function as a safehouse for them. Were they to go in hiding at a Muggle house somewhere? On the other hand, could they possibly bring the Dursleys into the Magical community and manage to keep them safe there?<br/><br/>Both Hestia and Dedalus agreed that it would certainly be the easiest way for the both of them to be situated in the magical community. Then they possibly could have other witches and wizards in close proximity to help them out if they needed to. Then again, the wizards would have to be people from the Order, for the sake of keeping their hidingplace a secret. As it happened, everybody lived so scattered around the country that they did not know how  any of that would ever be possible. Besides, Moody did not want to waste any more people from the Order on theese muggles, even though they were the only living relatives of Harry Potter. They all had other more important things to take care of, he said. He felt that this would be a task suited for two magical people only. That was the end of that discussion.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, everybody around the table had their very own ideas on where and how they were going to carry all of this out. Perhaps they could arrange for the Burrow to be extended? However, Kingsley announced that not to be a possibility. Arthur Weaslys family was already the wizarding family closest watched by both the Dark side and the Ministry. It would be far too dangerous to keep them there. It had to be somewhere very different. Perhaps the old Headquarter in London could be used? No, definately not! Hestia protested. That house would be the most dangerous house for any of them to even approach. </p><p>Then Mad-Eye Moody announced that he was uttrely reluctant to keep the Dursleys in the magical community at all. He told the entire room that Mr Dursley was such a bigoted man when it came to wizards he probably would not last one single day if he were to be mingeling with too many wizards at one time! Their main mission was supposed to be keeping them alive wasn't it?! Kingsley Shackebolt agreed with him and Hestia and Dedalus were overruled. It had to be a Mugglehouse of sorts then.<br/><br/>Mad-Eye then started to plan for a house somewhere far away, in the north of Norway, where he figured nobody from the Dark side would even think to look, when Dedalus Diggle suddenly came up with a much better plan! Thank goodness, Hestia thought! No way was she going to survive the cold weather far up in the north of Norway, in addition to spending her time with three allegedly stubborn and difficult muggles.<br/><br/>Dedalus had suddenly remembered his good friend Arabrax Bricklehurst. He had the perfect spot he told them all. Dedalus were so utterly pleased with himself for thinking of him, he jumped up and down on his chair. Hestia could hardly keep her countenaince for his silly behaviour. He declaired to them all it would be very well indeed and promised them he would manage everything regarding the planning of their stay at the safehouse himself. The house was not situated directly in the wizarding community, he said, however it was a witch’s house. He was also convinced that mr Dursley would not object to the house nor its inhabitants. In addition he promised Hestia the weather would not be of any consequense to her at all. He simply needed to contact the man himself and ask if it would be all right with him if he sheltered Harry Potters relatives. Something Dedalus were almost convinced would  not be an issue at all.</p><p> </p>
