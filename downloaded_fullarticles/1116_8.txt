    <p align="justify">This was one of his favourite spots to be in. His eyes strayed from the tree trunk under him towards the tallest tower on the castle grounds.</p><p align="justify">The Astronomy tower.</p><p align="justify">He flinched slightly as the memories broke into his train of thought. They had been nightmares until just recently. Those nightmares had turned into dark memories. Ones that haunted him still but not as much as they used to.</p><p align="justify">Food was just a way to survive then. Only when it was absolutely necessary. But now he could swallow some without gagging on it. Just this afternoon he had helped himself to a small slice of pudding. His tongue had rejoiced at its sweet tangy taste.</p><p align="justify">He was now sat atop the same tree from which he'd commanded his 'friends' around, spied and mocked the golden trio over the years. But today, he was completely alone. Left with nothing but his thoughts, wandering eyes and a loose tie his fingers were playing with.</p><p align="justify">His ears perked up at the sound that pierced through the white noise. A dove. Looking up, he watched for a silhouette to appear in his line of vision. The leaves were rustling against the wind, the reflected light dancing on him and whatever surface it touched.</p><p align="justify">He looked down in time to see a mixed group of 4th years looking up at the sky with grins on their faces. Something didn't sit well with him. He heard the bird call out, but this time it was more of a cooing. His eyes grew wide as he realised what had happened.</p><p align="justify">Right in the middle of the group, there was a wand raised high, pointed to the sky. And the next second, the unmistakable body of a white dove crashed to the ground, the short grass softening its landing only by so much.</p><p align="justify">He didn't bother hiding. Neither masking his obvious satisfaction at the nonverbal hexes he threw at each and every one of them till they ran into the castle screaming bloody murder. Only when absolutely sure of everyone's absence did he kneel in front of the injured aviary and tried to scoop it up. But he wasn't sure how to do it. His first instinct was to poke the bird and so he did.</p><p align="justify">A short gasp escaped his mouth when its eyes shot open. Its body vibrated under his fingertip. One black beady eye watched him, as he struggled to see what was wrong. And then he felt blood. Turning the bird slightly, fully aware of its talons gripping onto his long robe, he saw its wing. Broken. Bleeding.</p><p align="justify">Tenderness was what he felt rushing into his arms from his chest as he slowly but surely picked the bird up and cradled it to his chest. He swallowed slightly, wondering if he was hurting it even more with what he was doing. Crimson stained his white shirt underneath his robe but he didn't mind.</p><p align="justify">Stealing the box of tissues from Pansy's room wasn't a big deal. Laying the bird gently onto the bed of tissues and tucking some tissues into the sides, he raced as fast as he could to the Infirmary.</p><p align="justify">"There," he whispered while kneeling and placing the box right in front of the door. His eyes darted around to make sure no one was watching before smiling softly at the white bird. He brushed a finger against its neck one last time before knocking hard on the double doors.</p><p align="justify">Black beady eyes watched as the mop of platinum hair disappeared down the staircase, his dark robes billowing behind him like a cape.</p>
