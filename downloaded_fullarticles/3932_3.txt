    <p>
  <span>If there was anything that a Malfoy could be trusted to do, it was to put a spin on a negative situation. After the war, he and his family were granted six months parole, along with many other people who had behaved in a less than heroic way. They had their wands confiscated (</span>
  <em>
    <span>right</span>
  </em>
  <span> after Potter gave his back, which was bloody typical) and they had to check in with a designated Auror once a week. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Draco didn’t need his wand, he wasn’t doing anything the Auror could disapprove of and he was actually very much enjoying having his house back. They couldn’t even hire magical cleaners, seeing as no magic was permitted on their estate, but after spending three full days hiding or selling their magical items, they hired some Muggle cleaners. Contrary to popular belief, Malfoys were not obligated to kill or torture every Muggle they ran across. And really, they needed the help. Even after they cleaned all the detritus that had been left behind, none of them knew how to cook or clean without magic. Not that they were hot shots at housework </span>
  <em>
    <span>with </span>
  </em>
  <span>magic either. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, overnight, they had Muggle staff living at the manor permanently. They couldn’t even talk about magic much. They were the best parolees the Ministry had ever seen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But six months was an insanely long time without magic. His mother spent it by throwing charity balls for Muggles with depression, something that occurred naturally, of course, but had been made so much worse by the Dementors. His father spent it making nice with as many people as he could. Which was difficult, seeing as Shacklebolt was auditing the entire Ministry, so all his best contacts were out of work. Draco spent it … well, he spent it doing a lot of nothing, really. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He slouched around Diagon Alley in the tightest leather pants he could find from Muggle London, enjoying the looks he got. There was a lot of shock and a lot of arousal followed very quickly by a lot of embarrassment. No one wanted to find him attractive. And yet, no one refused to go to bed with him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He found the old music room where he had learned piano and voice as a child. He filled it with Muggle instruments half-defiantly, wondering when his parents’ tolerance would stop. They were in the strangest limbo. Even his parents wore Muggle clothing, not wanting to make their new staff gossip about their strange clients. Draco spent a month learning how to play the drums, relishing in the way that no one could use a silencing spell on him. Relishing in the ability to hit the skin of the drums and have the only consequence be noise. And eventually, there came the satisfaction of noise done well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The only comment his father made was to offer to get him an instructor. And he didn’t even say it in a way that was insulting Draco’s current level of skill.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A month into their parole, Narcissa suggested that Draco throw a party for his birthday, maybe invite some of those ‘new friends’ Draco had been making. The way she said that was a little judgemental, she understood better than most that Draco was just enjoying having complete ownership over his body and actions again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Draco threw a Muggle rave one Saturday that took five whole days for their housekeepers to clean up after, and then threw another one the following Saturday for good measure. He discovered a joy for things that glowed in the dark and very loud music. He didn’t even mind that most of the guests came to see what Malfoy Manor looked like without all the magic. That might get them in the doors, but there was still an abundance of people waking up the next day with brutal hangovers, many of them still at the manor because they hadn’t made non-magical arrangements to get home and had forgotten. The Knight Bus had to do several trips, taking the guests out of the range where they could do magic freely again. Draco found himself impressed that none of the guests thought to defy the magic embargo to get his family in trouble, or to give any of his Muggle guests trouble. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His parents gave him tickets to concerts the next weekend, and Draco laughed at their obvious ploy to stop him from trashing the house again, but went along with it, because his parents hadn’t made him laugh in years and because they had given him </span>
  <em>
    <span>Muggle</span>
  </em>
  <span> concert tickets, which intrigued him. He hadn’t been to any concert since he was fifteen and had never been to one that didn’t rely heavily on magic for the performance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He loved it. He took four friends with him, three from school and one Muggle boy who was in love with him (which he found hilarious), and had intended to spend the night testing his tolerance on Muggle alcohol. But then the band started and he was unable to move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The thing with Draco’s parents was that they observed everyone constantly. And, seeing as they always knew the exact flavour of chocolate to give which politician’s wife on her birthday, it shouldn’t have surprised Draco that they had known that this music sounded like it was made for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was </span>
  <em>
    <span>loud</span>
  </em>
  <span>, that was his first impression. But there was complicated electric guitar, which Draco had fiddled with and decided wasn’t for him before he moved onto the drums. He knew he would be reconsidering that the second he got home. And the </span>
  <em>
    <span>drums</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Draco was a fast learner, and he had been learning music from a very young age, so he had a sense of rhythm that was invaluable to learning to play the drums. But while the music he had listened to so far had made the drums seem like an essential background element, keeping everyone in time in an elegant and subtle way, this drummer seemed determined to steal the show. Which was saying something, considering his competition. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man was only wearing a pair of shorts, having discarded his t-shirt after the first song, and every so often he poured a bottle of water on his head. He obviously needed to. Draco had thought that he sometimes took his frustrations out on his drums, but compared to this guy, he looked positively well adjusted. He threw his arms in the air before coming down on, hard, and weaved complicated bass lines for the band to follow. There was a consistent pattern, of course, despite the many embellishments. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco wanted to see how this guy fucked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the guitarist moved onto a solo, the drummer complemented without stealing the show for all of ten seconds before turning it into a competition again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took three songs before Draco was able to tear his focus from the drummer. Pansy, Blaise and Justin were on the dancefloor, leaving just Draco and Mug at the table. Mug thought Draco liked him because of the cute nickname he’d been given, but really, Draco had struggled not to introduce him as ‘Muggle Tom’ a couple of times, and Mug just worked. Draco told him that it was because he had a nice face, geddit, Mug? Mug was fairly perfect, really. He didn’t mind that Draco slept with other people, even expressing interest in joining in or watching some time, which Draco was still thinking about. And he was very attractive. And he let Draco be in control every single time, which was obviously a prerequisite. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You back with us?’ Mug asked when Draco had finally torn his eyes from the stage for the first time since they got there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco smirked. He wasn’t going to shout above the noise.</span>
</p><p><span>‘This guy really </span><em><span>gets</span></em> <em><span>it</span></em><span>, doesn’t he?’</span></p><p>
  <span>Draco raised his eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Right, you were too busy eye-fucking the drummer,’ Mug said, the sarcasm somewhat ruined by his shouting. ‘I love this band for what they say, not how they dress it up or how they look.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rolled his eyes, but started to listen more carefully to the lyrics. He probably should pay more attention to lyrics in general, seeing as singing was his strength whereas he was clearly still just an amateur drummer after nearly four weeks of doing nothing but drum, but he got obsessed easily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Mug was right, the singer wasn’t just singing about nothing. He was furious, something that Draco hadn’t placed because his voice was so melodic, but now … He clearly had a problem with the Muggle Ministry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Is he allowed to say that?’ Draco asked, deciding to put up with the indignity of shouting, after the singer described where their prime minister could stick his conformist values.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mug looked at Draco funnily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘It’s punk-rock. It’s all fuck the establishment, you know?’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The band stopped playing just after midnight, so they headed back out into London to find a quiet pub to talk and drink. Draco had only had two beers over the three hours he’d been there, and he felt the need to catch up with Pansy, who had apparently seen the £50 note he had given her as a challenge. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You’re new to the music scene, aren’t you?’ Mug asked Draco once they were seated comfortably with two jugs of beer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You just came to my 18th birthday,’ Draco reminded him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Never snuck into a club underage?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘We were at boarding school most of the year,’ Justin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco had found Justin invaluable since the war. None of the other Muggleborns wanted much to do with him, but Justin’s family were almost as rich as the Malfoys, so he had his own perspective.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Me too, I still managed to sneak out when Radiohead were in town. Nearly got suspended, but now there’s a library with my dad’s name on it and for some reason they forgot about it after that.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘It’s kind of in the middle of nowhere, it wouldn’t have been worth it if we had. Besides, we got up to a bit of mischief in our own rooms, right guys?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘And what mischief did a Hufflepuff like you ever get up to?’ Pansy asked curiously. She still hadn’t managed to get Justin to bed, which was baffling her, and Draco hadn’t seen that it was necessary to enlighten her as to why. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Our common room was right next to the kitchens, we were always having parties,’ Justin said defensively. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mug left for the bar again, clearly bored of their constant house rivalry. Having gone to his own posh boarding school, they barely had to guard their language around him. They could even talk about Quidditch vaguely, because Mug said his school had their own weird sport that they would never have heard of either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mug stayed at Draco’s house for two nights following the concert. He always left as soon as Draco told him he was sick of the company, but he also seemed perfectly willing to stay and be used by Draco up until that point. He also seemed to get along with Lucius surprisingly well, having been trained in that delicate balance between sucking up and taking the piss that Draco associated with rich kids.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Draco kicked him out this time, however, it wasn’t because he was sick of him. It was because, after messing about on Draco’s guitar while Draco tried to copy what he’d seen the drummer doing, he had casually mentioned that Draco should start a band, and Draco found himself consumed by the idea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>‘D’you reckon the Ministry would let me play wizarding venues?’ Draco asked his mother at dinner that night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Well, I don’t see why not, so long as you’re not using magic,’ she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Your equipment won’t work at wizarding venues,’ Lucius said in his problem-solving voice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco tried not to look too crushed. He wasn’t willing to be a cover band, though he now knew what they were, and he didn’t want to write songs that didn’t mention anything important to him. The best songs were the ones that used the artist’s pain, Mug had said, and for the first time, Draco had realised that his pain could be useful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘What we could do,’ Lucius continued, ‘is hire out a Muggle venue for the night and make sure that only wizards get in. Or you could use the manor. Or we could buy a wizarding venue and strip it like we had to with the manor. Magic and ecklecktricity don’t work together, that’s the problem.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Who else do you want in your band?’ Narcissa asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco got out of his seat and hugged his mother instead of answering. It was probably more punk to resist against his parents, and Mug was certainly under the impression that Draco was doing that, given the messy parties and the string of one-night-stands, but his parents understood completely what he was doing. He was reclaiming his life. And it had never been </span>
  <em>
    <span>his parents</span>
  </em>
  <span> who had taken his freedom.</span>
