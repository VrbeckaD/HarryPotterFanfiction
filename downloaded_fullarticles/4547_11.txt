  <span>Rick wakes screaming, looking around the room with wide eyes. The last thing he remembers is that he and the rest of his crew were where fighting off a horde of walkers and suddenly a blast hit. It happened after they buried Beth. Everyone was still mourning her death, losing Beth hurt just as much as when he lost Lori. Beth had become the heart and soul of their ragtag group and her death was a blow to them all. The group had found a place to settle down just for a little bit, after leaving Grady Memorial Hospital.</span>
</p><p align="left">
  <span>Things got really fucked up for a while. Maggie went into a state of shock and nothing Glenn did or said could bring her out of it. After they said their final goodbyes to Beth, Rick promised Noah they would go and find his family but when they got to the compound everyone was dead. Tyreese almost died when he got bit by one of Noah’s brothers. Rick, Glenn and Noah made it in time to chop off Tyrese’s arm, saving him from being turned into a walker. He could not stand the thought of losing another friend, another family member. Rick sighs as he brings his hands to his face, rubbing his eyes, when he notice his hands are bandaged.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">Rick sits up, quickly looking around the room and immediately realizes he is not in the woods or in some broken down house that always seems to smell like death. He also notices that none of his friends are around. Rick takes in the decoration of the green and silver walls and drapes, the fact that there are large candles to give the room light but not blinding which is good because he still has a headache. How did he get here? The last thing Rick remembers before everything in his world went black was seeing a sea of emerald green. Rick’s head hurts only hurts more as he tries to remember what happened.</p><p dir="ltr">Rick slowly rises  from the bed only to realize that he is completely naked, the only thing covering him is the bandages wrapped around his torso. Rick looks around the room for his clothes but cannot find them, only to notice a black silk robe draped over a chair sitting by the bed. Rick walks, <em>more like hobbles</em>, over to the chair and picks up the robe inspecting it. On the front is a crest of sorts stitched into it, small words are written on it “Toujours Pur” <em>if only I knew what that meant, and who the fuck owns anything silk these days.</em> Movement in the corner of the room catches Rick’s attention, on reflex he reaches for his knife but comes up empty handed, he has no weapons on him so he will have to find another way to defend himself. Rick scans from corner to corner turning quickly in an effort to location the movement but there is nothing there; he is in the room alone. <em>Maybe I’m seeing things because of the headache.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rick brings his hands to his face missing the fact that his beard is gone and rubs his eyes hoping that the headache will just go away. He needs to find Carl, Judith and his friends. Rick puts on the robe seeing as there is nothing else for him to wear, the silky material feels good on his skin. <em>When was the last time I wore something so soft on my skin?</em> Over the past five years, his life has been turned upside down. Sleeping with one eye open, in tents on the cold hard ground, breaking into farms and walker infested homes. The prison was the only safe place he’d stayed but it was only safe until the Governor wrecked what little happiness Rick had carve out for his family and friends.  Rick turns just as the door opens. Again Rick reaches for his knife on reflex ready to defend himself and comes up short once more.</p><p dir="ltr">Standing before Rick is a man <em>or is he a boy?</em> with the oddest green eyes he has ever seen and long hair raven hair pulled back into a messy ponytail, dressed in all black from head to toe. He is shorter than Rick by a couple of inches and in his hand is a covered silver tray.  </p><p dir="ltr">“Who are you?” Rick demands before his jailer can say anything.</p><p dir="ltr">“No need to fret Mr. Grimes. I come in peace.”  Says the stranger with a British accent as he walks into the room then sets the tray down on the nightstand that Rick had not noticed. Those odd green eyes look back at him, “My name is Potter. Harry Potter but you can call me Harry.” Potter, Harry Potter says with a smile. “Everyone has been worried about you.” Potter continues.</p><p dir="ltr">Rick does not move from where he stands but watches as Potter walks around the room and straightens the bed he just got out of. “Where are my friends and family?” Rick demands, interrupting the man as he tidies up. Potter ignores him and Rick watches as Potter walks from the bed into another room then comes back out with his hands filled with clothes then place them on the bed. <em>What the hell</em> thinks Rick i<em>s that a closet?</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Why don’t you take a shower and get dressed. And once you have had that delicious broth that was prepared for you, I can have your friends come in and visit you.” Potter tells him as he turns to open the door. This time Rick is on his game. He grabs the smaller man by the neck, slamming him into the door and wrenches one of his arms behind his back, sandwiching the smaller man between the door and himself. Rick pays no attention to the fact that his robe comes untied and that his naked body is flush against the smaller man. All Rick cares about is finding his son, daughter and friends, then getting the fuck out of here. With no weapon Rick will not hesitate to break the man’s delicate little neck.</p><p dir="ltr">Potter does not seem surprise nor does he fight Rick off; it is as if the smaller man was expecting the attack. Rick leans closer to whisper into the smaller man’s ear, “I am going to ask you one more time, where are my family and friends?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Your family and friends are fine, if you want me to take you to them you will have to get dressed or I can have them come to you but in order to do that you will have to let me go.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rick does not trust this nor does he trust the man his body is pressed up against. Too many times they have been lied to and almost killed. Rick just wants somewhere he can raise his family in peace even if it is during a fucking apocalypse.</p><p dir="ltr">“Look I understand you don’t trust me, they said you would not. And honestly I don’t blame you.” It is as if the man knows exactly what Rick is thinking. “You woke up in a strange place and in a soft bed, who would trust that right away?</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re right, I don’t trust you. So I’d rather you take me to my family and friends. And only fools trust easily.” Rick answers the smaller man.</p><p dir="ltr">“Alright that would require you to get dressed or would you rather have your son see you the way you are. I promise if you want to put some clothes on I will not retaliate or try to peek.”  Harry whispers and Rick pays the last comment no mind.</p><p>Slowly Rick takes his hand away from the smaller man's neck, then steps back to put on the clothes that are placed on the bed for him, dark jeans and a brown t-shirt, soft cotton socks and hiking boots; everything fits perfectly as if it is made just for him. True to his word the smaller man does not move from the door, he is in the same position Rick left him in. Face pressed against the door one hand wrenched around his back. Once Rick is fully dressed, he walks over to the smaller man and stands behind him. Rick cocks his head to the side as if he is trying to figure out a puzzle. <em>Something is not right, no one comes into a room without having a weapon hidden on their person.</em> Thinking fast Rick starts to pat down the smaller man. Rick starts at Potter’s shoulders down to his arms, then his chest. When Rick’s hands brush over the front of the man’s crotch, he ignores the slight blush coming from the smaller man.</p><p dir="ltr">“If you are searching for a weapon Mr. Grimes, I can assure I do not have any on me. I came in here on good faith.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rick ignores Potter’s comment and continues to search. Potter is either really good at hiding a weapon or he is telling the truth because Rick does not find anything on the man. Potter raises a perfectly arched eyebrow, then smirks and drawls, “Satisfied?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rick pays no attention to the smaller man’s words. His only concern is finding his family, “Alright, I’m ready; let’s go.” The smaller man goes to open the door but Rick stops him, “Move slowly and no sudden moves, I will not hesitate to put you down.” The smaller man has the audacity to snort as if calling Rick’s bluff.  Rick is certain he could kill the man quicker than the man could utter the word boo. From the feel of the smaller man, Rick has more muscles and has had special training as a sheriff. He has a height, weight, and training advantage, in addition to the determination to take down anyone that gets between him and his family.</p><p dir="ltr">Rick watches as Potter opens the door to a long hallway, then puts his hands up in the air and starts to walk out of the room with Rick following behind him. “Walk slowly.” Rick tells him. Rick does not want to have to kill anyone but at the moment his family is his only concern. Rick’s head still hurts like a son of a bitch and so do his ribs but he will not let the man in front of him see how much pain he is in. That would be a sign of weakness, one the other man could take advantage of. The hallway they are walking down is long but not dark, there is enough light for Rick to see that there are large life-like paintings on the wall of men and women dressed in clothing from every era. Rick’s head must be hurting to the point of seeing things because he swears he sees someone moving in one of the paintings.</p><p dir="ltr">They make their way down a few more steps in the hallway when Rick suddenly hears a scream. He does not stop to assess if it is a scream of fear nor does he hear the laughter behind said scream. Rick moves quickly, pushing the smaller man out of the way and knocking him against the wall without care to whether Potter gets hurt or not. Rick runs to where he thinks the sound came from, his heart pumping with fear that a walker is nearby. Rick stops at the end of the hallway at a dead end, he looks to his left then to his right.  There are two large open spaces, on his left is a sitting room with couches. Yet Rick does not take in the decor, on his right sits Carl and another boy with blue tinted shoulder length hair playing video games with their backs turned to Rick.</p><p dir="ltr">Even with their backs turned to Rick, the kid looks to be a few years younger than Carl, around eleven if Rick was to make a guess. Carl is laughing, actually laughing. It has been a very long time since he has seen Carl smile much less laugh and not even a forced one. Rick is not sure what the hell is going on but if Carl is laughing, things cannot be so bad. After everything they have been through Carl deserves to be a kid even if it is only for a little while. Rick does not want to make a sound, he wants to stand back and watch his son play just for a little while longer. A smile plays across his lips when Carl jumps up and does a funky dance after his win. The blue haired kid does not look upset, he laughs along with Carl. When was the last time Carl acted even a little like a kid? At the age of fourteen, Carl has had to deal with too much, seen too much; sometimes Rick feels like a failure of a father. To see Carl this way now makes him feel a little better.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey Dad!” comes a happy scream.</p><p dir="ltr">Rick is so busy watching his son he does not see the smaller man walk into the room. “Hey Moonlet, are you having fun with Carl?” Blue haired kid nods excitedly as brown eyes stare up at Carl as if he is the kid’s hero. “Did you finish all your reading?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Ah, come on dad! I just wanted to take a break, all those books are boring.” The blue haired boy says with a pout.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know Teddy, but you still have to read. You start school in September an-”</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t want to go Dad, I don’t want to leave you guys. And besides I finally have someone else besides you grownups to play these games with.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I know Love, but it is a tradition. No matter what’s going on, I promised Remus you would attend Hogwarts. And even with what is going on, that promise still stands.” Potter says running a hand through the blue locks.</p><p dir="ltr">“Why can’t I be homeschooled? That way I can stay here and still be with you guys.”</p><p dir="ltr">Potter sighs, “Let me think about it Ted. Now go finish your reading before your Grandmother finds out you didn’t finish. She’ll have my hide.” The last part  is said with a smile.</p><p dir="ltr">Rick stays in the shadows as much as he can and watches the interaction between Teddy and his father, but he is also a bit confused. What kind of school is still up and running and who would want to be separated from their child during a fucking apocalypse? So many questions and no answers; nothing makes fucking sense.  It’s then that Carl sees him trying to hide in the background, “Dad! you are awake.” The next thing Rick knows his arms are filled with his son hugging and crying into his chest, telling Rick how happy he is to see him finally awake. Rick tries to hide the slight wince of pain and pushes it aside to just enjoy having his son in his arms. “Everyone has been so worried, you were out for so long. Harry and his friends found us and took care of us.” Carl’s face lifts from his Rick’s chest to look up at him, a smile graces Carl’s lips and Rick cannot hold his own back.</p><p dir="ltr">“Carl, where are we? Where is Judith and everyone else?” Rick asks his son in a whisper.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of answering him Carl turns to Harry and asks, “Didn’t you tell him?” Rick looks at Potter as well.</p><p dir="ltr">“I did not get a chance to, he was insistent on seeing you and the others. You are our first stop.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Cool, can Teddy and I go with you while you show him?” Carl asks in excitement. Whatever is going on here, there is a very big, positive change in his son.</p><p dir="ltr">“I think not,” says Potter. “If I am not mistaken Carol also left a few reading materials for you. Plus the headache your dad is trying to hide is probably making him see cross-eyed right about now.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rick smirks at the look Carl gives Potter, it is of a little boy trying to weasel his way out of doing his homework. <em>Carl has the same look on his face like me when I try to hide the fact that I am in pain</em>  thinks Rick. Rick look down to see Carl staring at him. “You do look a bit pale Dad.” Then Carl turns back at Harry. “Do you think Draco has any of that nasty medicine you gave me when I had a headache a week ago?”</p><p dir="ltr">“A week ago? Wait, how long have I been out?” Rick asks as he looks from Carl to Harry. “How long have we been here, and exactly where are we?”</p><p dir="ltr">“You and your group have been here for about three weeks. And to answer where you are exactly, you are in Alexandria.” Harry tells him.</p><p dir="ltr">That takes Rick’s breath away, he was out for three weeks? Anything could have happened to his kids and family during that time. How could he have let his guard down?  “Don’t beat yourself up.” Harry tells him now as he stands in front of Rick. When did he move from standing beside the kids? “From what we can tell you took most of the brunt of the blast when the house you were trying to get away from exploded. You had some burns and a severe concussion. You got an infection so our doctor put you into a coma to give your body a chance to heal. Not only that, you and your group were severely malnutritioned and dehydrated.”</p><p dir="ltr">Clucking his teeth, Harry goes on ignoring Rick’s distress. “Speaking of which I need to take you to him so that he can check you out now that you are awake. But let’s get some food into you first.” Potter says walking away from him and Rick’s only option is to follow him. But he stops quickly causing Rick to bump into him. The man turns and looks at the boys. “You guys go to the library and finish your school work, I will send someone to fetch you when lunch is ready.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes dad, Yes sir,” Carl and Teddy say together. Rick is shocked Carl is actually listening and doing what he is told to do without complaint. Rick then turns to look at Potter to see that the man is a few steps ahead of him, <em>what kind of hold does he have on my kid?</em> Rick wonders.</p><p dir="ltr">Rick catches up to Potter as they walk outside, Rick expects to see a barricaded  fence, some sort of secure perimeter and walkers milling around beyond the fence. Some sort of guard making sure that they are protected. What Rick does not expect is for them to walk out into a beautiful garden. Wherever they are Rick feels like he is dreaming. This place looks untouched by the horrors Rick knows are ravaging the world. So he does the only thing he can do, he pinches himself. Rick looks down at his arm to see the red mark and realizes that he is wide awake. With all of their traveling and all of the deaths they have seen, Rick cannot believe that he is walking in a garden that has flowers blooming. <em>When is the last time I saw flowers blooming?</em> The air is a bit chilly because spring is right around the corner. Rick hear voices from the other side of the garden.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ronald Weasley-Malfoy if you do not get your arse back here this instant you will be sleeping on the couch tonight.” A very masculine voice yells out loud. And laughter fills the air.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh come on Love, it was only one little prank.” Another voice whines.</p><p dir="ltr">“One little prank or not, it was not funny.” Drawls the masculine voice. Rick doesn’t recognize either voice. His mind is still stuck on the fact that he was in a coma for three weeks. Add to that he does not know what to make of the fact they that they are in Alexandria, in a somehow untouched paradise among people who have not tried to kill them as of yet. Whether they saved his group or not, Rick still does not trust them. He can’t afford to. No one does anything for free and out of the goodness of their hearts, especially now.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ah it kinda was, I ain’t neva seen nobody jump so high in the air.” That voice Rick knows; it is Daryl’s voice. Rick walks fast and turns the corner to see Daryl standing beside a tall redhead and a blond slightly shorter than Daryl himself. Daryl and the redhead are holding their stomachs laughing while the blond look as if any minute now he will fillet them.</p><p dir="ltr">“Keep laughing Love,” says the blond. “I know what you are afraid of.” The blond continues. In an instant the redhead stops laughing.</p><p dir="ltr">“You wouldn’t?” squeaks the redhead.</p><p dir="ltr">The blond smirks, “Play another prank on me again and see what happens.”</p><p dir="ltr">The blond and the redhead engage in a staring contest until the redhead looks away, he turns to see Harry and Rick standing there. “Have you been teaching my husband tricks?” The redhead asks pointing to the blond.</p><p dir="ltr">Potter smiles, “Ron, you do realize you married a Slytherin correct? Not just any Slytherin but the Prince of Slytherin? Besides I told you he wouldn’t find it funny.”</p><p dir="ltr">The redhead or Ron, gets a dreamy look on his face as if that question answers everything.</p><p dir="ltr">Daryl spots Rick during the short conversation and walks over to him and gives him a crushing bear hug. “Rick, I’m so glad to see ya up and about man.” Daryl tells him then steps back. “It was touch and go for a minute there. If it wasn’t for Blondie and Andy we mighta lost ya.” There is a hitch in Daryl’s voice as he takes a few step back from Rick. “I know everyone will be happy to see you up and walking around, specially Carl.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rick clears his throat so the emotion doesn’t bleed out into his voice. “I saw Carl already, he seems a bit changed.” Rick looks at Daryl to see if the other man can read the suspicion on his face. As nice as this place may be, Rick does not trust it. Nothing and no one this nice can be trusted. It is too good to be true. It has to be a trick, a trap to lure them into a false sense of security before they try to kill them. Daryl does not say or give anything away, maybe Rick can get him alone to talk with him. Something about this place seems off and Rick intends to find out exactly what it is.</p><p dir="ltr">“We came to get you guys for lunch, where is the rest of the crew?” Harry asks.</p><p dir="ltr">Daryl sucks his teeth, scratching his chin, “Last I saw Tyreese, Noah and Sasha were heading to the library.”  Daryl says to the group, “ I don’t think Maggie and Glenn left their room this morning.” That he says with a smile and the group smiles with him. “Eugene still refuses to talk or be around anyone, can’t say I blame him the way Abraham talks to him.” Daryl says with a shake of his head.</p><p dir="ltr">“As for Abraham and Rosita, they are probably somewhere doing things I don’t want to think about. Father Gabriel might be off praying for all our souls but you know how I feel about him on a whole. Carol the last I saw her was with Andy taking care of Judith and Michonne was with the twins. For some reason she likes their affinity for things that blow up.” Daryl shrugs his shoulders, “Not sure where everyone is now. This place so damn big you could get lost in it for days, fore someone decides to find you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m trying to figure out if I need to worry about the twins and Michonne. Those two are the worst when it comes to getting into trouble, more than you and Ron put together.” Potter says shaking his head.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh come on Lil Bit, they don’t mean nuttin, sides, this is the most I seen that woman smiled in a long time; let her have some fun. And from what I hear, you’re the king of pranks,” Daryl refers to Potter with a chuckle.</p><p dir="ltr">“I told you stop calling me that.” Potter tells him but there is no heat in his voice. It seems Daryl is as entrapped by this group of people as his son is. Rick watches the scene in front of him. It seems as if his group has found a home already and it has only been a total of three weeks. What did these people do to have his suspicious group let their guard down so quickly and so easily?</p><p dir="ltr">Potter turns from Daryl,  “I refuse to speak to you when you call me that name. You really don’t need to point out that you are all taller than me.” Potter says with a pout. Rick has to do a double take, the grown man is pouting.</p><p dir="ltr">“Come on Lil Bit, I mean you are short. You give that damsel in distress vibe and shit.” Daryl says with a chuckle at Potter’s back.</p><p dir="ltr">Potter, Rick notices ignores Daryl’s barb about the damsel in distress comment.</p><p dir="ltr">The redhead snorts, “damsel in distress my arse more like a magnet for trouble with a capital “T”.” That caused everyone to chuckle.</p><p dir="ltr">Daryl opens his mouth to speak but before he could, “Before we go inside, let’s get introductions out of the way.” Potter speaks up stopping any thing Daryl might say.  “Rick, this is Draco one of our resident doctor and chemist.” Potter says and points to the blond, “the tall tree of a man standing beside him is his husband Ron and my brother in everything but blood.” Harry points to the redhead. Rick shakes both the men’s hands but keeps quiet.</p><p dir="ltr">Potter stops and turns back to Rick then stares at him as if he sees something wrong and he says, “Come on we need to get you something to eat, plus back to bed you are looking worse now than when you woke up.”</p><p dir="ltr">“He’s right man, you don’t look so good.” Daryl agrees.</p><p dir="ltr">“Draco do you have any pain reliever on hand? Rick has a headache he has been trying to hide from me.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes I do as a matter of fact, come on. I want to check him out at the same time. From the looks at it, he’s just as bad as a patient as you are.” Draco says to the crew as they start walking back into the mansion. <em>Wait, mansion what the fuck?! How did I not realize that we are staying in a Mansion? I must really have a concussion.  </em></p><p dir="ltr">“Hey, I haven’t gotten hurt recently.”  Harry grumbles when they get inside.</p><p dir="ltr">“Shall we talk about yesterday?” Draco says, raising a brow.</p><p dir="ltr">“That was an accident and we were training.”</p><p dir="ltr">Daryl chuckles the whole entire time Harry and Draco are arguing back and forth. “Are they always like this?” Rick whispers to Daryl who is walking beside him.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ah shit man, this ain't nothin’ wait till you meet the twins, now them boys are trouble.” Daryl tells him. Then Daryl stops walking which makes Rick stop. He looks ahead of him to see the other three men have kept on walking. Rick looks back to Daryl. “Look man I know you and I know you’re worried about everyone and what’s going on here. But these guys seem cool man. They are laid back and they welcomed us with open arms. They didn’t take our weapons, which I thought was stupid of them. When I woke up not knowing where I or anyone was, my first instinct was to get you and everyone the fuck out here.” Daryl whispers to him.</p><p dir="ltr">“What happened?” Rick asks Daryl.</p><p dir="ltr">“I heard Lil Ass Kicker crying, and silently I followed her cries. When I got to the room she was in I heard singing. And there was Harry, holding Judith and soothing her cries. She was clean and fed. Before I could walk in the room and demand he put her down, he told me to come in. I don’t even know how he knew I was there watching. When I walked into the room he told me to sit down in the rocker by the crib and to put my bow down and then handed me Judith. He didn’t even stay in the room, he left us there.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rick does not know what to think, it is as if these people are blindly trusting their group just like that, no questions asked. “I still don’t trust it, everything here seems a bit too perfect for me. How is it they live in this place where it looks like the walkers have not touched? And they act as if the world hasn’t come to an end. This feels like the Governor all over again but only in a nice way before they stab you in the fucking back.” Rick whispers back.</p><p dir="ltr">“I hear what you’re sayin man and trust me, we have been keeping our eyes open but so far we’ve seen nothing suspicious. Carol has stuck by Andromeda or Andy as she likes to be called and seen nothing out of the ordinary. Michonne clung to the twins or I should say they clung to her as soon as she woke up. When Maggie and Glenn are not attached at the hip, she is with Draco learning about doctoring like she did with Herschel. I stick with Red as much as possible but sometimes he and Harry disappear for hours. And if you think Michonne is kick ass with a sword wait until you see Harry. ” Daryl tells Rick.</p><p dir="ltr">“What about the rest?” Rick asks.</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s the thing, the others are being “trained” by some of the other people who live here. What I do find strange is that there are no hunting parties but there is always fresh meat to eat. No supply runs, yet this place is always lit with candles no matter how late at night it is. And fireplaces in certain rooms are always lit even though it is not cold outside.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Those things are all a bit strange</em>, thinks Rick, “Have you seen them take out any walkers, go on patrol, told you what they want?” Rick asks rapidly and to every question, Daryl shakes his head no. Something is wrong. Daryl does not trust easily and right now the man standing beside him seems too trusting of these people. Rick is silent for a few minutes. He has to trust that Daryl knows what he is talking about. “If anything goes down I need to know that you have my back.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Always man, always.” Daryl tells him patting his shoulder. “Brother in all but blood.” Daryl says repeating how Harry described his and Ron’s relationship. Rick hopes so because he has a feeling that their lives are about to change drastically.</p><p dir="ltr">“Alright, come on, let’s go.”  Rick and Daryl walk into a huge dining room just as Carol, Tyreese, Maggie, Glenn and the rest of the group walk in with people he does not recognize. A blond haired woman with what look like radishes in her ears. She walks in with Carol and the two other redheads that looks like an older versions of Ron. When Carol sees him, she immediately runs over to and hugs him. Since Terminus Rick and Carol have gotten much closer than they were before he kicked her out of the group. He sought her out for her counsel more often than he could count since they reunited.  Where Daryl became his brother Carol has become his older sister, and Michonne the younger sister.</p><p dir="ltr">Carol pulls back from him and her eyes look over his face, “It’s so good to see you awake. We were so worried.”  </p><p dir="ltr">“So I’ve heard.” He tells her with a genuine smile.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m just glad you are awake.” After Carol, comes Maggie, Glenn, Tyreese, Noah, and Sasha. Abraham pats him on the back and Rosita gives him a hug. Eugene gives him a head nod. Father Gabriel tells him he never stopped praying for him to recover. That Rick takes with a grain of salt, he still does not trust the man as far as he could throw him.  Michonne, to Rick’s surprise looks a lot different; for one she is wearing a skirt and her hair is neatly styled.</p><p dir="ltr">Michonne walks over and gives him the longest hug a sister would give to her brother.  Rick looks around; these people are his family, they have been through so much together. Rick does not want to imagine what his life would be like without them. And that is when he hears it, the sweetest noise to be heard. Judith gurgles. When Rick looks up he sees Harry holding her while Judith sucks on her thumb. As soon as she sees Rick, she tries to jump out of Harry’s hands to get to him. Without thinking Rick reaches for her, hugging and kissing her. Tears well up in his eyes. He has his family back; they are together and they are safe. For now!</p>
