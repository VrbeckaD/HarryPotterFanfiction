    <p>The day it all began Narcissa was feeling particularly despondent. It was a beautiful day. The spring sun was just beginning to gain back some strength. Narcissa wandered through the gardens of the Manor, hoping to find signs of flowers emerging from the damp undergrowth. She was no stranger to opulence, but she eagerly awaited the glory she knew the grounds would erupt into by May. The Malfoy gardens had been what had convinced Narcissa to agree to the match.</p>
<p>Of course, she hadn’t despaired the notion of the arranged marriage. A part of her did wish that she could have found the wild passion Bellatrix had with her husband. Another part, secreted away more deeply, wished she could experience a love such as Andromeda had- a love that meant more than norms and traditions. Narcissa had acted as enraged as her mother and sister when Andromeda had eloped. Really, she was hurt. Her sister hadn’t confided in her. Hadn’t said goodbye. </p>
<p>Lucius was handsome, at least. And rather charismatic. He was not so much older than Narcissa that it made her uncomfortable, but enough so that it made her feel special that he’d chosen <em>her. </em>They certainly made a striking pair, the both of them, willowy figures and platinum hair. Enough people had simpered over their beauty that Narcissa had actually begun to bore with it all.</p>
<p>Certainly the wedding had been wonderful. The dress Narcissa had worn was reminiscent of Grace Kelly’s (whom despite her fame in the muggle world was actually a witch). Narcissa had been the very definition of class and grace. And the months before the wedding, with parties to celebrate her youth and position in life, with Lucius striving to charm her… Oh, it had been the most extraordinary time of her life. Their wedding had been deemed the event of the year by both Witch Weekly and the Daily Prophet’s society pages. If you weren’t one of the four hundred guests in attendance, you weren’t worth much. </p>
<p>Now, just over three months into their marriage, disappointment was beginning to set in. Lucius no longer flirted. He spent most of his time in the service of the rising Dark Lord. Lucius promised that he’d have time for her when the Dark Lord succeeded in his aims. That Lucius would be placed high in the New Order of the Wizarding World. It sounded exciting, she supposed.</p>
<p>Narcissa had spent her engagement fantasizing about Lucius’s long, slender fingers and all the wicked things he could do with them. All the things men could do to women that Bellatrix had whispered to her about during summer nights at home, when their age difference was no more than a triviality. Unfortunately, Lucius didn’t seem particularly concerned about such things. They slept together rarely. Each time had been brief and Lucius had left her for the comfort of his personal chambers immediately following. He’d become cold in his interactions with her. She wondered if he had a mistress.</p>
<p>Scoffing, Narcissa snapped a brittle twig off a nearby bush and rushed back up to the manor. The watery sun and skeletons of the garden had not been effective in cheering her. She considered going to the library but dismissed the concept. She’d been disappointed that the vast collection contained nary a work of fiction. It was filled with bone dry texts, many of which contained spells which were dark to a degree Narcissa found distasteful. Perhaps a long bath would do the trick.</p>
<p>It took a long while for Narcissa’s eyes to adjust to the interior of the manor. While the exterior of the stately Malfoy home was a crisp pure white, standing out from the rolling gardens surrounding, the interior had always seemed disappointingly dark to Narcissa. The floors of the entryways and the ballroom were dark granite, the hallways and other rooms ebony hardwood with deep forest green rugs. The walls had matching panelling on the lower halves, and crown moulding lining the junction with the roof. Antique tapestries depicting scenes largely focused on Pureblood values covered much of the Manor’s walls. Narcissa would have preferred an environment a little lighter, airier. Something that felt fresh and full of potential. Ah well, she sighed, at least she was the sole Lady of the Malfoy estates now. She supposed she could slowly begin to refurbish the place. It seemed like something Lucius would likely agree with, as it would keep her busy and out of his way.</p>
<p>As she passed the door to Lucius’s study she paused. He was out again. Narcissa had been explicitly forbidden to enter his study without Lucius being present. The slight shimmer of wards was visible in the thin crack between the wood of the door and its ornate frame. A smirk crept along her face. Lucius might have been charming but he had always had a snide, condescending edge that had irked her. She knew he was certain these wards would keep her out.</p>
<p>Stepping back from the door she withdrew her wand and began to undo the charms. Lucius was undeniably intelligent. But Narcissa was intelligent too. And all too often underestimated, as all wizards (and witches, too) could see was her beauty. It was just moments before she was swinging the door open. The room smelled of Lucius- cologne, fine leather and cigars. Underneath Narcissa could pick up a subtler scent- that of long instilled magic. It was challenging to describe, the way magic after many years could alter the scent of things… a mix of freshness and antiquities. Like frosted leaves scattered in the dirt during the month of October. Or a gentle breeze winding through a library full of centuries old tomes.</p>
<p>Narcissa hadn’t intended to actually do anything in the study, she had just wanted to prove she <em>could</em> enter it. Her eyes were drawn past the large wooden desk and tufted leather chairs, beyond the books on the built in shelves, to a small chest tucked into the back corner of the dimly lit room. </p>
<p>She padded softly across the room towards it. It was simple. Black with tarnished silver bands. A small lock that worked without a key, but rather, a charm. Lucius had informed her once that the chest was not to be accessed by her at any time. Ignorant git should have realized saying something like that only made a person more inclined to go snooping.</p>
<p>And it was calling to her.</p>
<p>It certainly didn’t feel dangerous. Narcissa had encountered some objects of very dark magic through the years- she was a Black, after all. But this chest, it whispered in a soft, reassuring way. Narcissa ran her hand along its top. It wanted her to open it. It wanted her to sift softly through its contents. To discover what it held inside. To cherish its treasures.</p>
<p>Without thought she began working to open its lock. She didn’t <em>know</em> the spells that were needed to complete the task. Yet, somehow, she knew. It clicked softly open. Distantly, Narcissa understood that she should be surprised that there was only one object in the chest. But she wasn’t. It seemed perfectly natural that the slightly tattered, little book would be so important. She reached down and picked it up, running her thumb reverently along the black leather of its spine.</p>
<p>A date some thirty years prior was stamped on the cover in a deeper black ink. Narcissa opened the cover, noting that the first page, slightly yellowed, had the name <em>T.M.Riddle</em> in neat handwriting. She flipped through it, slowly at first, then with more speed. Nothing else was written in the diary. It was broken into sections by date. A monthly calendar, with weekly sections following, and several blank pages for general note taking. She checked each page carefully one more time and discovered no more revealing aspects. </p>
<p>Her knees were cramping. She wasn’t certain how long she’d been crouched on the floor of her husband’s study, but she’d best move along. Narcissa set aside the diary in order to close and re-ward the chest. She did the same for the study door behind her and then brought her discovery up to her chambers. Settling the book into the back of her wardrobe, she went back downstairs as she heard Lucius holler from the main entrance.</p>
<p>Narcissa suffered through an prolonged dinner as Lucius waxed on about the position his uncle had secured for him on the Hogwart’s board of governors. As soon as he’d settled into his study with a glass of liquor, she raced back to her room. She quickly set a charm to warn her if Lucius approached.</p>
<p>Not a single spell Narcissa tried revealed anything about the book. She had always had great pride in her skills of identifying magics, yet this book-clearly magical, could not be identified as such. Finally, after staring at it for a long moment as if the book would give in under the pressure of her gaze, Narcissa had an idea. She reached for a quill and bottle of ink, and opening the diary to the first page designated for note taking, she nibbled on her lip trying to decide on a sentence.</p>
<p>She settled for:  <em>What is so special about this book?</em> </p>
<p>Letting out a little gasp, Narcissa watched wide eyed as the ink soaked into the pages and disappeared. After a moment script began to appear along the page where her words had been, as if an invisible hand had slipped in front of her and began to write.</p>
<p>
  <em>I should think that depends on who is asking…</em>
</p>
<p><em>My name is Narcissa Malfoy, </em>she scrawled back immediately after the response began to fade.</p>
<p><em>Malfoy? Impressive heritage. </em> <em> </em></p>
<p><em>My maiden name is Black. </em>She wrote back. <em>Who are you?</em></p>
<p><em>I am Tom Riddle. It is a pleasure to meet you Narcissa</em>.</p>
<p>The name was familiar, she grasped for it in the reaches of her mind. She came up empty. </p>
<p>
  <em>How are you able to write to me?</em>
</p>
<p><em>Ah, unfortunately my dear Narcissa, <u> I</u></em> <em>am not writing to you so much as a shadow, a memory of myself is. This book encapsulates Tom Riddle as he was at the time of writing. An adolescent attending Hogwarts. </em><em> </em></p>
<p>
  <em>So where are you now?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I’m not sure. Perhaps, Narcissa, you could do me a great favour and tell me about your time, the world as it is and I would be able to learn more. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>If it is not too much of a liberty, Narcissa, I wonder…</em>
</p>
<p>The words faded away and were not replaced.</p>
<p><em>What?</em>  Narcissa prompted.</p>
<p>
  <em>How old are you, Narcissa?</em>
</p>
<p>If she could see the young man behind the writing, Narcissa imagined he would have been blushing. Something twinged not unpleasantly in her gut. <em> </em></p>
<p>
  <em>Eighteen. </em>
</p>
<p>Tom wrote back instantly,<em> I wish I could see you. It is so impersonal to communicate in this fashion...</em> <em>Will you help me, Narcissa? </em></p>
<p>
  <em>Yes. </em>
</p>
