          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Potter.”</p>
<p>Draco sighed. It wasn’t right. It came out softer than he intended, like a prayer.</p>
<p>“Potter.”</p>
<p>Still not right, this time it was more breathy, like a… well, Draco didn’t want to think about in what situation he would use that voice.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, concentrating hard, pushing aside images of Potter at the manor, of flying through fire desperately clutching Potter, of Potter coming to his trial and testifying for him.</p>
<p>Instead he tried to focus on how much he detested him. Potter always got advantages. Everybody fawned over him, especially now after the war. Potter had been allowed on the Gryffindor Quidditch team despite his age. He had refused Draco’s handshake and made friends with Weasley instead.</p>
<p>It was like conjuring a patronus, but in reverse.</p>
<p>“<i>Potter</i>.”</p>
<p>There. Just right. Draco relaxed his shoulders, chin up, and fixed his eyes on his reflection in the mirror.</p>
<p>“<i>Potter</i>.”</p>
<p>It sounded like an insult. Perfect.</p>
<hr/>
<p>“Hey, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>Draco would recognize that voice anywhere. Even on a bustling train platform.</p>
<p>“<i>Potter</i>,” he spat, lip curling up in distaste.</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>Draco heard the disappointment in Potter’s voice.</p>
<p>“I thought maybe you had changed but I guess some things never do.”</p></div>
