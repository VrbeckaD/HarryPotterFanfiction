    <p>Like most days and events and really anything at all as it pertained to himself, the 17th of December was a disaster for Scorpius. Not a real disaster. But it seemed like the universe wanted to get a few good jabs in, all at once. That was fairly typical.</p><p>Take, for example, Scorpius’ first day of secondary school. Not only had he overslept for the first time in his life, but he also spilled jam all over his new school uniform, and then the other kids made fun of him for knowing what the endoplasmic reticulum was. Apparently, it’s not cool to know the subject matter before the course begins. Apparently, no one else reads the whole textbook before classes start. But no matter.</p><p>The 17th of December started out like any regular day. His alarm had sounded at 4:25. He sat straight up in bed, his white-blond hair sticking out at every angle. A friend once referred to his bed head as resembling a baby’s depiction of the sun. Then, still in his pyjamas, he shook off the covers and meandered over to the foam roller to massage his legs and lower back. That absolutely killed. It made him want to shriek aloud, but heavens knows that he would wake up half the neighborhood and the police would be on their doorstep to investigate a murder. Scorpius would have to explain that the allegations were untrue; he just had extremely sore muscles. </p><p>Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, he would pull on his training clothes and trot downstairs. His father would be asleep, so he’d silently assemble his breakfast. It was always the same thing, every day. Most people got tired of monotony in their foods, but Scorpius never minded it. A full bowl of grape-nut flake cereal with 2% milk, a glass of kiwi juice, and half of an orange. He ate like an elderly man and he was proud of it. Fruit was delicious and raisin bran was superior. The other half of the orange would be put in a plastic bag and would serve as his post-morning-skate snack, along with a chocolate chip granola bar. </p><p>His trainer, Clarice, hated his high sugar intake, but there wasn’t much she could do about that. When Scorpius had been a teenager, with a monstrous appetite and a near-fanatic love of the sport of figure skating, he’d been the only boy in a training group full of teenage girls. Weight was the center of every locker room discussion. Everyone was hyper-conscious of it, though it didn’t have a huge role in anything skated-related on a technical level. Scorpius had read into it extensively. Sure, if you did partner skating, then there was the issue of being held in the air. But that was your partner’s problem, if they couldn’t hold you in the air. It meant they hadn’t lifted enough weights that week. </p><p>Regardless, it was an issue. Scorpius had told his father about some of the food-related language that he heard during warm-ups. Calorie-related language, to be precise. Scorpius knew from his reading that a balanced meal was more important than a finite amount of energy intake, expressed in calories, but he thought that his fellow ice-skaters had not gotten the memo. After glancing at the meal plans, his father had stormed into Clarice’s office. To this day, Scorpius wasn’t sure what his father had said, but they’d been re-issued meal plans, this time without any mention of calorie goals. </p><p>Following breakfast, he walked half a mile to the train station. His train stop was the end of the line. The trains remained in a sort of parking lot to the side of tracks, eerily silent and empty without their passengers. He always took the first train. A total of five people took the first train, and four of them were doctors living in the area. The other was the skinny blond boy with the bulky bag who wore winter clothes no matter what the weather was like outside.</p><p>Yep, that was him. Scorpius Malfoy, figure-skater extraordinaire. Enthusiast might be the better word. Scorpius hesitated to say that he was extraordinary at anything, despite what his father told him.</p><p>His journey to the rink was rather haphazard. He walked to a train, and then he got off one train and onto another, and then took a bus, and then walked a little more. He technically could get to the rink by walking to the train and then walking the rest of the way, but he liked the hum of the subway. He didn’t particularly like being smothered by other people during peak hour. He didn’t like the creepy men on the train, the ones that asked him if he knew how to have a good time. Spoiler alert: he didn’t even know what a good time was until he told his father about the incident. His dad had flown into a rage, both at the idea of someone proposing such a lewd act to his precious son and at Scorpius’ miserable sex education. </p><p>On reflection, Scorpius realized that he sounded a bit incapable, like he needed his father to do everything for him. Or that his father had anger management issues. Both allegations were untrue. His father liked to do everything for him. There was a difference. He was overprotective. Scorpius had the sense that his grandmother and grandfather, who died when he was very young, would not have been candidates for parents of the year when his dad was a kid. He also had the sense that his father desperately wanted to combat his parents’ reputation. Therefore, while most teenagers hemmed and hawed at the idea of their parents interfering, Scorpius quietly tolerated it.</p><p>Someone dropped their briefcase. The impressive boom that emanated jolted Scorpius from his thoughts momentarily before he returned to his pondering.</p><p>What he did like about taking public transportation everywhere was the base, human aspect of it. Everyone was themselves on the train, whether they wanted to be or not. People had their worst moments on the train and their best moments. People had their quietest moments, too. Scorpius thought those were the best. Watching someone he didn’t know and probably wouldn’t ever know go about their daily routine, the same way he was… it instilled hope in Scorpius. A little bit, in an exceptionally weird and creepy way. </p><p>The best part was that no one knew Scorpius. He could be whoever he wanted to be. Not that he wasn’t anything but his authentic self. But it thrilled him, knowing that if he wanted to, he could pretend to be German. Or a college student. Or a lawyer downtown. No one would know who his father was, or what school he’d gone to, or why he was even on the train in the first place.</p><p>Poetic, wasn’t it, for five past five in the morning? He marvelled at himself for a moment. His own weirdness occasionally caught him by surprise. </p><p>Nothing unusual happened during his journey to the rink on December 17th. And nothing unusual happened during practice, either. He did his warm-up laps, his crossovers, his lunges. He did his pivots, his turns, his jumps, his axels. There were more specific words for everything he did, but he found that the words didn’t translate to what he was accomplishing. Choctaws did not seem like they should be named choctaws. The same goes for shooting the duck. The nonsensical words and phrases failed to capture the elegance and coordination required to perform them. He practiced his program twice without music and three times with music. And finally, he did his cool-down laps.</p><p>What was unusual about the 17th of December was that Scorpius got coffee from the rink café after practice, instead of the more posh, upscale coffee shop across the street. The coffee was overpriced and underwhelming in flavor, but he went for the atmosphere. Today, however, he had decided to vary his morning routine. He wasn’t sure what compelled him to do that. His routine was what he treasured most about his day. The unscheduled parts were what he detested. Yet he continued on breaking the norm. Instead of hustling to school, he decided to stick around the rink.</p><p>Clarice had offered him a job two years ago as a skating instructor for the little kids, but he simply hadn’t had the time. Maybe today he could lead warm-up. </p><p>He plucked his laced-up skates from where he had left them and slung them over his shoulder, determined to do something a little different today. One of his boots was already half-off when he walked onto the space alongside the rink. Scorpius did not get much farther than that.</p><p>It seemed that he’d neglected to check the schedule. For while he’d thought there was a youth beginner’s skating practice that followed elite training, there was a crowd of people decidedly taller than five and six year olds. Some were taller than he was, and Scorpius considered himself to be on the taller side. It was a hockey team. A local high school’s hockey team, to be precise; he recognized their snake logo. </p><p>Scorpius had seen hockey before, once or twice. His father nearly enrolled him into a class as a toddler until he remembered that the violence in hockey can be abhorrent and had him pulled before Scorpius’ name even made it onto the Mini Mite roster.</p><p>His impression of hockey was similar to that of his father’s. A lot of board-slamming. A lot of violence. A lot of missing teeth. A testosterone-fueled nightmare, in Scorpius’ humble opinion.</p><p>But he was intrigued. He couldn’t help being intrigued. In every written evaluation Scorpius had ever received, the teacher made a note of his curiosity. “Sometimes,” one memorable comment read, “Scorpius’ curiosity leads him off-topic in the most delightfully strange ways. I appreciate his thirst for knowledge, but I’m not sure how he gets from octopi to the significance of the monarchy in the Middle East. He is a very advanced fourth grader.”</p><p>The hockey team clambered onto the ice without sparing Scorpius any notice. He liked it better that way. The kinds of boys that do hockey are also the kinds of boys who are not very nice to boys who figure skate.</p><p>They lazily skated about, squirting water in-between the grate of their helmets, pushing each other around and laughing. The goalie practiced blocking shots. Despite all of his awkward extra padding, he was able to manipulate his feet and knees and arms to block and catch shots without a second thought. He didn’t make a single mistake.</p><p>A group of boys was taking shots on an empty net. One - Scorpius couldn’t quite make out his number - was particularly skilled with curving his shot. The puck sliced through the air under his guidance and hit the upper right-hand corner of the net. Scorpius considered clapping but thought better of it.</p><p>“Stalking, are we now?” </p><p>Scorpius nearly shot four feet into the air. He took a steadying breath of air. “Hi, Clarice.”</p><p>Her eyes fell on his skates. “Want a career change? I don’t think you have the build for hockey, but I could get you there.”</p><p>Scorpius chuckled. “No thanks.”</p><p>They watched in silence for a few moments. Clarice took the time to re-do her hair. She always wore a bun so tight that Scorpius worried it would make her hairline evaporate.</p><p>“Do I notice a few gray hairs? Is that because of me?” Clarice narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“Very funny.” Scorpius smiled widely, clasping his hands together. He was awarded with a twitch of the mouth as she tried to keep a straight face.</p><p>“I thought about leading warm-up today, like you mentioned awhile ago. I don’t think these guys belong in a beginner’s class, though.”</p><p>“I mean, you could try to call those kids beginners. I think they would whoop your ass to Mars and back, but there’s no harm in trying.”</p><p>Scorpius nodded. He considered the logistics of getting his ass whooped hundreds of thousands of miles. Would the slap itself generate the energy required to make him move? How far would he move in the vacuum of space? How much time would it take him?</p><p>“I can see your gears whirring from here.” Scorpius blinked once, twice. “What are you thinking about in that big head of yours?”</p><p>At best, Clarice tolerated his tangents. He had an inkling that today would not be a good day for getting side-tracked by his imagination. He fumbled for another question. “Do you know those kids? The ones practicing?”</p><p>If Clarice found the question out of the ordinary, she did not comment. Instead, she said, “I know the goalie and the best forward. Everyone else is in our database but I don’t know their names off the top of my head.”</p><p>“Who’s the goalie?”</p><p>“That’s Rose Weasley. She’s a tough one.”</p><p>“I thought that was a guy’s team.”</p><p>“Her hair’s buzzed off, so you would have a hard time telling the difference even without the helmet. She’s damn good is what she is, and the team is co-ed anyway. Well, it is technically, but not many girls are jumping to play. Poisonous men, or whatever it is you said to me that one time.”</p><p>“Toxic masculinity?”</p><p>“Yeah, what you said.” Clarice shook her head. Possibly in disbelief, possibly with the intention of being humorous, possibly to mean something else. Scorpius couldn’t tell at this point. Clarice did a lot of the same actions that meant dramatically different things depending on the context. A pointed finger could mean, “You’re in big trouble,” but it could also mean “pay attention,” and it could also mean “you’re the best skater in this goddamn competition.” </p><p>She continued on. “The forward is named Albus Potter. He’s only a sophomore, but he’s already been contacted by the lead schools in the country. The Ivy Leagues and the state schools alike. He hates the attention, though. He tells me to make the scouts go away. His father… well, you’ve heard of his father, right?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Of course you haven’t.” Clarice had known Scorpius since he was four years old. Every time, she managed to be surprised that he knew so much about certain things and nothing about others. Scorpius had tried to tell her in the past that there were multiple types of intelligence and he just happened to lack social intelligence, but she never remembered. “Harry Potter is one of the best hockey players of all time. It’s like… it’s like if Nathan Chen were your father. It doesn’t help that he’s the spitting image of Harry.”</p><p>“I can imagine.” Scorpius pictured his father in ice skates. He then saw an onslaught of images involving his father doing effortless axels in competitions. He quickly discarded those. His daydreams were too fanciful. For all his father’s strict upbringing, his grace was lacking. </p><p>“Oh, speak of the devil.” A player was stumbling towards the boards. He took off his helmet and spat his mouthguard into his palm, leaving a trail of spit from his mouth. Scorpius wrinkled his nose.</p><p>“Hey, Clarice. What’s the hot gossip?”</p><p>“Hello, Albus.” Albus bit back a grin. Scorpius stared at him through the glass. This hockey boy had freckles all over his nose. Scorpius had never gotten freckles; he spent too much time indoors, and his skin was far too pale to get freckles in the first place. He wished as a child that there was a magic spell that could make him grow freckles. </p><p>They had a brief conversation that Scorpius paid no mind to. He was too busy thinking about inventing a lamp that could give someone freckles. But the radiation from the heat… that couldn’t be good. There must be another way. Make-up?</p><p>“Don’t you have an exam to get to?” Clarice’s voice cut through his thoughts, slicing them into choppy ribbons. Scorpius glanced down at his watch. He was fifteen minutes behind schedule.</p><p>“Goodness gracious.” He almost slapped a hand over his mouth for cursing, but he saw Clarice’s shoulders beginning to stiffen. She wrinkled her nose to hold back her laughter. There was no way he was going to embarrass himself in front of the hockey boy for being himself. “I’ll see you later!” He began to walk briskly back towards the rink exit.  </p><p>He threw his skates back over his shoulder. Without thinking, he turned around. Clarice was gesturing towards her notepad. Albert - Albus? Yes, Albus - was watching him go. Maybe, Scorpius thought, he could embarrass himself just a little bit. He decided to shout, “You are very good at hockey!” It was stupid and impulsive and he wanted to swallow the words as soon as he had said them. He shouldn’t have said that. Albus probably thought that he was a total idiot. He didn’t even know him. Now that he was thinking clearly, Albus definitely looked like a bully. </p><p>The other boy hesitated. Then, Albus (or was it Al?) beamed. It was the sort of smile that takes over your face without you meaning for it to. He gave a short wave before skating away. </p><p>In the grand scheme of things, most things in Scorpius’ life were unusual. But December 17th was the start of the most unusual sequence of events in Scorpius’ life to date.</p>
