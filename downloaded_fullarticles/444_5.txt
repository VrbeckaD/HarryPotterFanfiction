    <p>A man in black robes sprinted up the stairs, anxiety written over his face.<br/>
“My love,” he said, desperately attempting to appear calmer than he was. “They’re coming. Hide her, please.” His wife nodded and ran towards the nursery on the second floor, where their daughter was. The explosion behind her said she was too late.<br/>
“Seamus MacEcrae,” a voice boomed from the splintered doorway. “You are under arrest for aiding and abetting a known fugitive, for the murder of wizards and muggles, and for tax evasion. Surrender now.” Turning towards the door, Seamus glared at the man in blue robes with star-shaped spectacles. He was not who had spoken, but he was responsible.<br/>
“Get out of my home you English invaders,” he growled, Irish accent clear as he drew his wand. The man who had spoken, a scarred old man in a trench coat, moved quicker. In an instant his wand was out, pointed towards Seamus.<br/>
“Last chance,” he said. Seamus growled and let off a curse. The orange light flew towards the blue-robed man, who turned it away with ease. The battle began in earnest, spells flying as the rest of the strike team made their way into the mansion. Seamus knew he wouldn’t survive this. He just had to buy enough time for his wife.<br/>
That was the last though Seamus MacEcrae would ever have. Seconds later, a straw-haired man leapt up the marble stairway, and shouted, “<em>SECTUMSEMPRA!</em>” Seamus could feel the darkness pull his body apart as his flesh split in a wide line from neck to navel.<br/>
The men who had invaded his home stepped over him while he lay bleeding on his own stairway. They pushed their way into the nursery, only to find it was empty. The next door bedroom was not. As they entered a woman burst into sight, flinging curses. Two of the men fell to hexes, three others to the Killing Curse, until the blue-robed man waved his wand. A jet of green light extended from it. Her eyes widened as she looked at the man who had killed her, then fell over.<br/>
In the bedroom closet they found the child.<br/>
“What should we do with her?” asked the straw-haired man. Everyone looked to the man in star-shaped spectacles.<br/>
“Put her in a muggle orphanage,” he said, eyes twinkling with delight. “In England.” The men around him laughed as one scooped up with child, only months old, and disapparated.</p><p> </p><p>The woman who would later become Hermione Granger was born on the 1st of May, 1978. She was not, however, born to Ian and Jean Granger, nor to anyone possessing that surname. She was born to Guinevere and Seamus MacEcrae. Her mother was the descendant of Morigena Le Fay, of Gwydion fab Don, and of the House of Cunedda, ancient rulers of Gwynedd and northern Wales. Her father was the descendant of Mug Ruith, of Nail Noígíllach and the House Uí Niell, and of King Solomon. This marriage and been long planned, since the days when the Uí Niell ruled Ireland and the Cunedda ruled Gwynedd. Although their families were no longer kings or queens, they still ruled, through money, magic, and power behind the scenes. They named their daughter Hermione, after the child of Menelaus of Sparta and Helen of Troy, another powerful couple who had tried to unite two parts of the world. Seamus and Guinevere hoped their marriage would be better than Helen and Menelaus’.<br/>
Seamus MacEcrae was close ally of the Dark Lord and his plans. He had rallied the noble houses of Ireland and Wales to Voldemort’s side in the first war. He had wooed them with tales of autonomy and home rule, the dreams of the Irish Houses since the Norse Conquests. Despite the independence of Ireland in the muggle world, its magic was still within the British realm. His plans, however, had not worked out. While most of the noble houses were able to talk their way out of the mud post-war with claims of Imperius curses and death threats, the MacEcrae were not so lucky. Seamus MacEcrae died two days after the Dark Lord fell, and Guinevere minutes after him. English aurors had entered their home after disabling their wards, despite being on Irish soil. Seven aurors had died, and their daughter was thrown into an English orphanage. Not only an English orphanage, but an muggle English orphanage. It was her parent’s worst dreams come true.<br/>
Fortunately, Hermione was adopted after less than a year at the orphanage. Her new parents were Ian and Jean Granger, both dentists, although they worked in separate practices. For a time all was well. Ian and Jean took care of Hermione, and loved her as they would their own flesh and blood. They went shopping with her, helped pick out her clothes and were so kind, even if Ian's gaze lingered a little too long. They helped with her homework on the rare occasions she needed it. She was brilliant academically, which meant she was bullied in school. Her parents’ support helped keep her determined, however, and she plowed on, speeding ahead to trigonometry and The Three Musketeers by year three.<br/>
That was the year everything changed. Her father was fired by a petulant boss, and quickly turned to drinking. He became angrier, darker, and louder. He yelled at Hermione and staggered around the house with a bottle of whiskey in his left hand. Her mother bore the brunt of his aggression. Hermione could hear them yelling from downstairs, even as she tried to hide herself in books and problem sets.<br/>
Hermione’s first major burst of magic occurred only three years later. Her father moved to hit her mother, but was repelled by an unseen force. This did not sit well with him, and Hermione became his focus as he swore and beat her. Her mother tried to stop him, but he punched her and she fell to the floor. He moved over, grabbing a knife and shoving it into her chest. Shouting slurred words about how Hermione had made him do this, he tore off his daughter's clothes and began to rape her.<br/>
Hermione cried for the next three days. She stayed in her room, not daring to go outside and face the monster her father had become. On the third day, her door had opened. She hid under the bed, fearing her father’s wrath. But he had not opened the door. A woman in a constable’s uniform stepped through the door, squatting at the bed.<br/>
“Hullo,” she said in a soft voice. “I’m Constable Dougherty, but you can call me Gabby. Can you tell me your name?” Hermione tried to speak, but nothing came out. Her throat was dry from lack of water and raw from crying. Watching her, the constable’s eyes grew wide with concern.<br/>
“Have you had anything to eat today?” she asked, checking her watch. It was close to 7pm. Hermione, still hid under her bed, bushy hair pushing up against the bed frame, shook her head. “Why don’t you come with me,” the constable said. “We can get you some food and something to drink down at the station.” Hermione fought the urge to crawl further under her bed. This might be the only chance she had to leave her father’s grasp, and she was damn well going to take it. She nodded, and began crawling out from under the bed. Constable Dougherty smiled, and led her towards the stairs. On the first step Hermione wobbled, and the constable had to catch her on the next.<br/>
“Do you want me to carry you?” she had asked. Hermione shook her head. She needed to do this. She too the constable’s arm, however, and the two slowly made their way down the stairs.<br/>
When they arrived at the station, Hermione underwent a quick medical check. All was well, but when the male nurse went to touch her, she flinched, flinging herself back into a chair. Constable Dougherty checked her pulse and hydration instead. The girl was clearly malnourished, and not just from the three-day fast. They would later find out she hadn’t had a proper meal for almost a year. She tried to refuse going to the hospital, despite the nurse and constable insisting. Hermione finally gave up after she collapsed. She had tried to stand up from the chair to prove she was fine, and almost blacked out. On the way to the hospital, Hermione fell asleep.<br/>
She woke up in a bed, wearing a hospital gown. She looked up, and saw a doctor (Brad Hill) moving to change her IV bag. She screamed, waking up Constable Dougherty who had been napping in the corner.<br/>
“Hey, it’s okay luv,” the constable said, rushing over the Hermione’s bed. “He’s just making sure you stay hydrated and fed. He won’t do anything.” Hermione nodded and took in a deep breath, and then another, forcing down her tears.<br/>
Hermione was discharged from the hospital at 10:22am the next morning. She was glad to be wearing her own clothes again. The gown had felt too vulnerable. On the drive back to the station, Constable Dougherty explained what was happening. On the night her father had raped her, a neighbor had called the police. They had knocked on the door, but Ian Granger had told them to “bugger off.” Constable Dougherty censored that part.<br/>
The costables had then gone to get a warrant so they could search the house and make sure Hermione and her mother were okay. Unfortunately, the magistrate for her area was more than a little misogynistic.<br/>
“Do you know what that means?” Constable Dougherty had asked. Hermione nodded.<br/>
“It means he thinks women are worth less than him,” she said quietly. “And that he has political connections.”<br/>
“Why does it mean he has political connections?” Constable Dougherty had asked. Hermione smiled for the first time in more than a year.<br/>
“How else would someone so dumb become a magistrate?” Constable Dougherty liked that one. She laughed aloud as she drove, and was still chuckling when they pulled into the station.<br/>
“So,” Hermione said, the grin not yet gone. “When can I see my mother?” Looking up at the constable’s eyes, the grin fell off.<br/>
“Hermione,” the constable said softly, squatting to be at eye level. “Your mother, she didn’t make it.” Hermione’s mouth fell open, and her eyes watered. “He stabbed her. We think after you had passed out and locked yourself in your room.” The small eleven-year-old began crying, her eyes flooding with sorrow. She fell into the constable’s embrace.<br/>
Fortunately, Hermione did not have to testify at the trial. The police had more than enough evidence, and did not want to put her through the pain. Unfortunately, she was now back in the foster care system. Little had changed in the ten years she’d been gone. The food was the same, the funding the same, the attitudes the same. The only thing that had changed was that there were even more children.<br/>
The letter came three weeks after her father had been arrested, on the 29th of June. The letter read:<br/>
<em> Dear Miss Granger,</em><br/>
<em> It is my pleasure to invite you to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this upcoming school year. Although you may not know it, you are indeed a witch, a woman with magical energy and powers. This may be hard to come to terms with at first, however I am sure that upon thinking of your past you will realize that magic explains many of the inexplicable experiences you have had.</em><br/>
<em> Attached to this letter is a list of courses you will be taking should you enroll, along with the necessary school supplies. There is also a map of Diagon Alley and directions of how to get there. School starts on the first of September. Please board the train at platform 9 and ¾ before 10:30, as the train leaves at 11 o’clock sharp. We look forward to having you at Hogwarts.</em><br/>
<em> Sincerely,<br/>
<em> A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Headmaster </em></em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hermione was indeed shocked at the letter. She read and re-read it dozens of times over the next week, trying to make up her mind on whether this was real or a prank. In the end, she decided, there was only one way to find out. In the early morning of July 8th, Hermione Granger snuck out of the Stockwell Orphanage of London and made her way downtown. She used her father’s credit card to purchase coins for the Underground, and was soon off. She arrived at the location and was soon facing a brick wall. She re-read the letter once more, and then closed her eyes, hoping for the best. Tapping a brick, the wall soon rearranged itself.<br/>
Hermione walked through, looking around quite confused. She seemed to have walked into a rather homely pub. She slowly made her way through, gripping her bag. She carried most of her possessions in that bag and wasn’t about to lose it to a group of drunks. She quietly walked through the pub and out the other side. Looking around, she smiled. Families were walking the streets, people were laughing and talking, and there was even an ice-cream shop. Shaking her head, Hermione pulled out the list, slowly mumbling to herself before decided to go and get a wand first.<br/>
Ollivander’s was everything she could have wanted and more, once she got past the old man measuring her.<br/>
“Always happy to see a new student,” Ollivander said, moving towards his desk. “That’ll be six galleons and eleven sickles.” Hermione’s eyes widened, and she took a step back.<br/>
“Oh, um, all I have is m-my father’s card,” she said. “How do I get those?” Ollivander smiled at her, trying to calm the young girl’s nerves.<br/>
“Ah, you’re a muggleborn! No worries, just head down the street to Gringotts. The goblins will set you right up, you can transfer as much as you want. I’ll keep the wand safe until you can come back.” Smiling nervously, Hermione took off at a quick pace, barely managing to avoid a run.<br/>
At Gringotts she was indeed able to set up an account. While the goblins could be surly, they were happy to finally work with someone who seemed to respect them. Most wizards looked down on goblins, both figuratively and literally. Hermione did so only literally, instead treating them with the respect one showed bankers in the muggle world.<br/>
“How much do you want to transfer miss?” the goblin, Gripnear, had asked. Hermione paused. She thought for a minute. Did she ever want to go back? To what? she thought bitterly. There’s nothing left. Might as well move on. Taking a deep breath and rolling her shoulders to try and de-tense, she answered.<br/>
“All of it.”<br/>
All of her father’s money was not much. Between alcoholism, the mortgage, and the money he had spent hiring a lawyer, there was very little left in the joint family account. But it would be enough to get her supplies, and to find somewhere to stay until school started. She hoped so, anyways.<br/>
As it turned out, her hopes were not pies in the sky. The Leaky Cauldron, as the homely pub was called, had several rooms that were rarely used. The price was more than fair, and often came with a meal and kind words from Tom, the owner. Hermione was content for the first time in years. She had escaped her father, and she had her books. She had already read, re-read, and taken notes on every chapter of the school books. Still, her trauma and her mother’s death weighed heavily on her. Although content for now, she was not happy and could not find peace.<br/>
This trouble was most clear when she tried to sleep. It rarely came to her, and then only in bits and pieces, interrupted by nightmares that forced her awake, dripping with sweat. She slept little, yet more than she had for the past year and a half. She left the pub early and stayed up late into the night, always reading. She spent her days at the bookstore, browsing through titles and reading them cover to cover. It was the best summer she’d had in years.</p>
