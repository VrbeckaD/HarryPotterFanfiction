    <p>“Here’s one” said Hermione, pointing into a compartment at the end of the carriage.</p><p>As Harry peeked in he saw that it was completely empty. Sliding open the door, he let Hermione enter first, before following her in with Ron directly behind him.</p><p>“So” started Ron, sitting down in a seat. “What was it you wanted to say?”</p><p>“Well...”</p><p>They were suddenly interrupted by a knock at the door. Sliding it open, a woman that looked a few years older than them stepped in, her hair a bright pink reaching just past her shoulders.</p><p>“Hey” she said, smiling cheerily, “You guys mind if I sit here? I need to sit at the back and the other compartments back here are full of noisy first years”.</p><p>Sitting back, Harry glanced at first Hermione, and then Ron, getting shrugs in return. Looking to the girl, he stuck his arm out to wave her into the compartment.</p><p>“Thanks” she said sitting down next to the window and opposite Harry. “I’m Tonks by the way”.</p><p>“Nice to meet you” said Hermione, shaking the older witch's hand. “What are you doing on the train? I thought that only the students travelled on it”.</p><p>“Oh, I work for the Aurors” Tonks said, showing the trio a badge. “I’m here as security for the whole Sirius Black thing”.</p><p>(An hour or so later)</p><p>Harry looked up and around in confusion as the train suddenly ground to a stop. </p><p>“What’s going on?” Asked Ron, his mouth full of sweets.</p><p>“Stay seated”, Tonks muttered as she stood from her seat, her wand already in hand, as the lights flickered off.</p><p>Harry gasped as a wave of coldness and misery washed over him, and the windows began to freeze over.</p><p>They all looked to the door as it began to slowly slide open, and a gnarled hand with long scabby fingers appeared on the glass.</p><p>“Dementor” Hermione squeaked.</p><p>Tonks seemed to have found her bearings, and lifting her wand, she spoke in a calm and firm voice.</p><p>“You have no right to be here. Sirius Black isn’t hiding on a train full of students. Now leave”.</p><p>The dementor didn’t acknowledge what she said at all, instead turning it’s robed head to face Harry, gliding towards him slowly. Harry froze, his muscles and limbs going stiff and rooting him to the spot. As the creature reached out for him, his vision began to darken. Just before he lost full consciousness, he heard the screams of a woman, before a bright green light flashed before his eyes. Though before the green could encompass him, a silvery blue one broke through it, and through his barely open eyes, he watched as a silvery badger tackled into the dementor.</p><p> </p><p>“Here, Harry, eat this”.</p><p>Harry groaned as he opened his eyes to see Tonks kneeling over him, a chocolate frog grasped in her hand.</p><p>Taking the proffered chocolate, Harry bit into it, instantly feeling better.</p><p>“That’s it Harry” Tonks said as she helped him sit back up.</p><p>“What was that?” Asked Harry, looking around the compartment.</p><p>“One of the dementors of Azkaban” Tonks said, visibly shuddering slightly. “A vile creature that feasts on people’s happiness.''</p><p>Standing up, she brushed the creases out of her robes before turning to the door. “I need to go and speak to the driver, I’ll see you all later”. And with that, she left the compartment, sliding the door shut behind her. </p><p>(After arriving at Hogwarts)</p><p>“I promise, I’m fine” Harry groaned, watching as Madam Pomfrey ran her wand up and down his body.</p><p>“I’ll be the judge of that mister Potter. Now sit there, I need to go check on other patients” she said as she walked off, muttering to herself about the stupidity of allowing dementors around children.</p><p>“It’s not all bad”.</p><p>Harry turned to the person that spoke, seeing that it was a small waif of a girl, with jaw length blonde hair and what looked to be a necklace made out of cork tops around her neck.</p><p>“What?” Harry asked rather intelligently.</p><p>“I said it’s not all bad being here. At least we get chocolate” the girl said, showing him a bar of chocolate that Madam Pomfrey had given to her.</p><p>Standing from her bed, the girl smiled at him before turning and skipping out of the hospital wing, humming a strange tune as she munched on the chocolate.</p><p>Harry just shook his head before sitting back and picking up a book that was left on the bedside table.</p>
