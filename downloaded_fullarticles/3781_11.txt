    <p>Amsterdam had the best clubs in the wizarding world. It was something that Scorpius had learned when he'd discovered that he was gay and before he had the courage to tell his father.  Fresh out of Hogwarts, he knew that his father would find out if he had a boyfriend in the UK, so off he went to Amsterdam, at least until a few months later, his father had sat him down and told him that nothing in the world would make him stop loving Scorpius.  There's been hugs (from his father) and a few tears (from Scorpius), but neither had talked about that day.</p><p>Potions moved freely in Amsterdam and any decent bachelor party was held there. The private party room was dark and loud.  Scorpius sat on a couch watching the groom to be drink Merlin knew what.  He was bored, Albus had skipped the party because of work, and he had no intention of drinking random potions made by some unknown party.  He was ready to leave when two men and two women wearing a mask and very little more entered their private room. </p><p>Scorpius barely looked at the women, but one man in particular had his attention.  Muscular, fit, tanned, he was perfection.  He moved through the guests with an easy smile, dancing and flirting until he stopped in front of Scorpius. There was a moment of hesitation while Scorpius let his gaze travel over the man's body until he saw it. It wasn't anything big, nothing that needed concealing, just a little scar on the left hip, but he knew that scar well.  His heart sped up and suddenly he was on cloud nine.</p><p>He stood up, his body pressed against the other man's. "I want private time with you."</p><p>"I don't kiss and I don't take my mask off," come the bored answer, as if he'd said it plenty of times before.  Scorpius just nodded in assent and then he followed the man out of the room and onto a different floor and a private room. "I'll need payment up front."</p><p>Scorpius took money out and put them on a dresser without bother to ask for a price.</p><p>"That's too much."</p><p>"Consider it my tip," Scorpius answered.</p><p>There was a curt nod. "What would you like?"</p><p>"I'd like to know what the hell is wrong with you, James."</p>
