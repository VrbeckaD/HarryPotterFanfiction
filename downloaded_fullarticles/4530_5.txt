    <p>In early 1994 Remus Lupin received a visit from the headmaster of his alma mater, bearing grave and startling news. </p><p>“Your older sister’s widower has just passed away, my dear boy,” Albus Dumbledore informed him, his blue eyes missing their usual twinkle. </p><p>“I had a sister?” Remus asked, handing Albus a cup of tea. </p><p>“Yes, you did.” Albus sighed. “She was a lovely girl. Older than you by six years, she had such potential…” He sipped the tea, studying Remus. “Your parents chose to send her away, to your father’s brother in America. She was raised a Muggle, her powers bound.” </p><p>“What was her name?” Remus sank down into a chair. “Why didn’t I ever know?”</p><p>Albus’ smile was kind and sympathetic. “A Seer spoke a prophecy as your mother gave birth. When the Ministry heard of his words, they gave your parents a choice—send the child away or she would be destroyed. And so Maralyn Sceana Lupin was sent to America to become Mary Christina Nicholson. She was taken in by your uncle, a squib.”</p><p>“Uncle Sebastian,” Remus said. “I’ve heard of him. Father never spoke of him much.” </p><p>Albus nodded. “He was the shame of your family. Ran off to the States the first chance he got, and never looked back.” Albus set down the saucer. “Your sister had two children before she died, Remus. Their father, John, has just died, as well, and they have no other family but you.”</p><p>Remus stared at him. “Albus, surely you can’t mean…” </p><p>“I do mean.” Albus’ eyes were solemn. “You have to take them in, my dear boy.” </p><p>Remus continued staring at him. “I’m a <i>werewolf</i>, Albus. You really think the Ministry will let me keep two young children?”</p><p>Albus smiled, and something dark peered out of his eyes. “They will.” </p><p>Remus slumped down. “I don’t have a choice, do I?” </p><p>With a shake of his head, Albus said, “Not much of one, no.”</p><p>.</p><p>Albus went with him; Remus was thankful for Albus’ presence. He hadn’t felt this nervous since he realized his friends had discovered his werewolfness. </p><p>The Ministry listened to Albus, gave Remus custody of his young nephews, despite protestations of his unsuitability. The minister, in particular, seemed against the idea; but Albus spoke eloquently, voice soft and compelling, and by the end of the meeting, Minister Fudge was practically waxing poetic about Remus’ good qualities. </p><p>The boys—Dean the elder at fifteen, Sam ten—were with a friend of their father’s, a Seer named Missouri Moseley. “She is part Muggle,” Albus explained as they walked to the Portkey. “Not very powerful as a witch, but her senses are extraordinary. She’s the one who contacted me after John died.” </p><p>.</p><p>The Portkey deposited them on Ms. Moseley’s front step. Albus lightly knocked his staff against the door and it opened almost instantaneously to reveal a bustling black woman.</p><p>“Well, c’mon in, you two,” she said, stepping back. “Ain’t got all day.” </p><p>Albus moved in first, saying, “It’s good to finally meet you face-to-face, Ms. Moseley.” </p><p>“Call me Missouri,” she told them both, holding out a hand. </p><p>Albus shook with his Merlin-esque smile, the one that used to drive Remus mad as a child. “Only if you call me Albus.” </p><p>Missouri offered them tea; Albus accepted for both of them. She gestured for them to take a seat and Remus waited for the Headmaster to sink onto the large couch before following his lead.</p><p>Remus looked around the room, waiting for either Albus or Missouri to speak; finally, Albus asked, “How are the boys doing?”</p><p>“Not that well,” Missouri answered, setting down her saucer. “Dean’s reeling, the poor boy. He thought the world of John, practically worshipped the man. And Sam—he’s so muted since it happened.” She focused her sharp, dark eyes on Remus. “You have your work cut out for you, wolf. Those boys are close to breakin’—and, I promise you, that won’t be good for anyone.”</p><p>“I don’t have room or time for children,” Remus finally burst out, swinging his glance from Albus to Missouri and back. “You must realize this—I can’t take them!” </p><p>Missouri raised an eyebrow. “Now, <i>you</i> realize this, boy,” she said, low and dangerous. “There’s no one else. It’s either you or a home, where they’ll be separated, vulnerable. They <i>need</i> to be together, Remus.” Her expression turned unsettled. “I don’t know why…” She trailed off, staring down at her teacup. </p><p>“It will be fine, Missouri,” Albus said. “You have my word.”</p><p>.</p><p>While Albus and Missouri worked out a few last-minute details, Remus followed his hearing to a room on the far-side of Missouri’s house. The two boys—his <i>nephews</i>, dear Merlin, he’d had a <i>sister</i>—were whispering softly, sounding worried and hesitant.</p><p>He paused outside the closed door, gathering courage. They were just boys, after all, just lost and lonely boys—they were probably more terrified than him.</p><p>After a moment he lightly rapped his knuckles against the wood. The voices hushed immediately and a few seconds passed before one of the boys—Remus guessed to be Dean—said, “Who is it?”</p><p>“Remus Lupin,” he answered. “I’ve come to bring you back to Britain with me.”</p><p>The door swung inward and he met a burning hazel gaze. “We’re American,” the boy growled out, stepping in front of his younger brother. “And we’re fuckin’ <i>staying</i> in America.”</p><p>“Dean!” Sam gasped.</p><p>Dean said nothing else, just glared at Remus. Remus knew he had to somehow get Dean on his side, if anything were to work out at all. “I’d myself prefer that you stay here, with familiarity, with people you know,” he told Dean, going for honesty. “But Ms. Moseley pointed out that you would probably be separated.”</p><p>Sam made a small noise, stepping forward to grip Dean’s arm.</p><p>Dean considered Remus for a long minute. “If we go with you,” he finally asked softly, “we’ll stay together?”</p><p>“Yes,” Remus promised. “You have no reason to trust me, but I swear it.”</p><p>Dean reached back to touch Sam’s arm. “Alright,” he murmured.</p><p>Sam peered around his brother, curiosity in his bright green eyes. “So, who <i>are</i> you?” he asked.</p><p>Remus smiled gently. “I only found out recently, but your mother was my sister.”</p><p>“So, you’re family,” Sam said, excitement thrumming through the words.</p><p>He nodded, Sam reminding him painfully of what James’ boy would be now. “Are either of you hungry? Ms. Moseley prepared some kind of stew, I believe.”</p><p>Dean shook his head, but stepped forward, eyes still wary. “I’ll come down to keep Sammy company, but I don’t wanna eat.”</p><p>“Very well,” Remus replied, wishing he’d met the boy before John died. </p><p>.</p><p>Sam was shy around Albus, never leaving Dean’s side. He had questions—Remus could see them bubbling in his throat—but he only asked a few: where in Britain they were from, what their jobs were, if they had kids or family, if they’d been in America before. Dean never spoke throughout the entire meal, except to tell Missouri <i>no, ma’am</i>, when she asked if he wanted some stew.</p><p>Albus and Missouri continued their discussion of protective runes well into dessert, a topic Remus would’ve usually found fascinating; instead of paying attention, though, Remus studied his nephews. They seemed to keep up a fairly steady conversation with head tilts, shrugs, and eye contact. Missouri had seated them next to each other, but Dean immediately turned in his chair to watch Sam.</p><p>“Well,” Albus said as Missouri served Sam some Mississippi Mud Pie, “how do you boys feel about coming to England?”</p><p>Dean straightened and Sam shrugged.</p><p>“Boys,” Missouri drawled warningly.</p><p>Sam answered, “I guess it’ll be okay,” while Dean glared at Missouri.</p><p>“You’ll live with Remus. He has a nice cottage at the edge of a Muggle village; I’m sure you both will like it.” Albus sipped his tea, eyes twinkling at the boys. “Of course, you both will be tested.”</p><p>“Tested?” Dean asked, worry causing him to break his mutinous silence. “For what?”</p><p>Albus smiled his grandfatherly smile. “Magic, of course.”</p><p>.</p><p>Missouri moved them all to the den for Albus’ explanation of the magical world. It hadn’t even occurred to Remus that the boys didn’t know about the society they would be joining.</p><p>Dean sat on the floor by the couch; Sam sank down next to him, so close he was almost in his brother’s lap.</p><p>Remus didn’t listen to Albus’ story—he knew it well. Instead he watched his nephews hear it for the first time. Sam was wide-eyed as Albus relayed a condensed version of magical history and culture. Dean kept his face blank, his body held slightly toward Sam.</p><p>“Are we wizards?” Sam asked after Albus finished.</p><p>“I believe so. I can perform the test right here, if you like,” Albus said.</p><p>Sam turned to Dean. “Please?” he begged.</p><p>Dean looked at Missouri, who shrugged. “It’s up to you, honey. You’re a man grown, now.”</p><p>He glanced back to Sam, then said, “Why not?”</p><p>Albus’ wand slipped from his sleeve. “I’ll need you to step up to me, Mr. Winchester,” he told Dean. “I assume you wish to go first.”</p><p>Dean lunged to his feet smoothly; wasn’t the first time Remus noticed his older nephew moved like a fighter. Dean strode to Albus’ armchair and the Headmaster stood. He tapped Dean’s forehead with the tip of his wand and golden sparks flowed out.</p><p>Albus nodded. “As I suspected: you are quite the powerful boy.”</p><p>Sam bounced again, shooting to his feet. If this was him muted, he must have been blinding before John’s death.</p><p>Dean said nothing, just moved to the side. Sam stood before Albus, who repeated his actions; this time, white sparks appeared.</p><p>Albus sucked in a breath and Dean stiffened. Sam looked to his brother, who stared at Albus. “Problem, sir?” he asked softly.</p><p>“No, no,” Albus answered. “Just something I was not expecting.” He looked at Sam. “You, my boy, have quite a future ahead of you.”</p><p>Remus shivered and Missouri sighed. “Poor child,” she said so quietly Remus only heard because of the wolf. </p><p>Sam still seemed excited, but Remus could tell that Dean understood the true ominous nature of Albus’ words.</p><p>.</p><p>Remus spent the night at Missouri’s, Albus having to return to Hogwarts. “You’ll join me tomorrow,” Albus told the boys. “Remus will bring you to the school; from there, he’ll take you to his cottage.”</p>
