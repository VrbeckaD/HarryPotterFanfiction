    <p>Hermione’s hand clutched around the paper that she was holding, the edges crumpling as her heart beat in her ears and rage began to consume her. She could feel it burning through her body and bubbling at the back of her throat as an acid taste filled her mouth. Her eyes scanned the red marks that littered the page before her, the words echoing in her head as she read them.</p><p>
  <em>**‘Pen them in? PEN them in?! Are you fucking kidding me? And what exactly are you planning to <u>pen</u> them with? Metal bars perhaps? A concrete wall? Or no, wait, here’s a better idea much more suited to the level of effort you have put into this proposal – why don’t we just put a wooden fence around them since they are going to blast out of it all the same! Honestly, I thought you were supposed to be smart – at least that’s what everyone always says, but right now I am seriously beginning to question their judgment.’**</em>
</p><p>
  <em>What.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>**’You do realize that these were illegally bred creatures correct? And that this proposition is going to cost the Ministry 25% of your yearly department budget to implement the project – and if I seem to recall correctly, your budget was just cut wasn’t it? So, this will actually cost you approximately 50% of your budget. I did the math right, right? Your budget was cut in half, yet your proposal still costs the same as I see no visible effort made on your part to try and reduce the costs – so that would mean that your project will now cost twice as much out of the budget as it did before. So, 50% right?’**</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>**’You’ve cited that the land is currently not in use, vacant and a good location for the proposed ‘sanctuary’ so I have to ask you – have you ever actually been out there? Are you aware that this land encroaches on a natural geyser that spews natural gas because there is a small pocket of it in the Northern most corner of the lot? I would have thought, given your background, you would at least understand the basic principals of combustion. Are you <u>trying</u> to create a bomb? Or is this just yet another detail that somehow the glorious Granger has over looked? Honestly, I’m on my second fucking pen now because this proposal is just so bloody terrible that there is hardly anything <u>not</u> to comment on – which means that I have to go get more of these stupid fucking pens from storage, which, by the way, is a twenty minute walk to the basement since the elevators don’t go down there! So, thank you for not only wasting my time with reviewing this ridiculous proposal, but also with the unnecessary trips to the dank cold storage room. At least you managed to spell your name right this time.’**</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>“ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!” Hermione crumpled the paper in her hand. A growl split through her lips as she stood from her desk, pushing her chair back so hard that it fell to the floor before she stomped around the edge in blind rage.</p><p>Throwing the door to her office open she ignored the echoing bang it made as it collided with the wall on the opposite side and made her secretary jump in her seat. At least this time Tracey didn’t scream in shock, instead Hermione barely caught a glimpse of the girl rolling her eyes before turning back to the magazine that she had been reading at her desk.</p><p>Four months ago, this sort of behaviour was unheard of. Hermione Granger <em>never </em>lost her composure, she never screamed, stomped, raged or threw open doors in a dramatic fashion. That was, at least, until Draco Malfoy had been promoted to the head of the new Magical Protection and Safety Department, or M-PaS for short. Hermione was now forced to consult with him for all proposals leaving the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures – of which she was head of magical creature law developments and proposal creation for regulation changes.</p><p>Hermione stormed down the hall, ignoring when two young interns walking her way quickly side stepped into an empty office and ducked their heads to avoid her – paper continuing to crumple in her fist, she made it to the elevator and slammed the brass doors closed.  She was breathing heavily, her whole body shaking with rage as the small brass box moved slowly up to the third floor, to M-PaS, so she could go strangle the man herself – personally.</p><p>She wasn’t exactly proud of her behaviour, or the fact that she and Malfoy hadn’t been able to work together for even a single day before the first explosion had happened. Four months ago she had attended a joint department meeting, the boring Friday morning one that happened every month so that the department heads could relay new information and announce any changes. It was during this meeting that Malfoy’s new role had been announced. Hermione could still remember rolling her eyes at the idea – <em>Malfoy in charge of Protection and Safety? Honestly? It had to be a fucking joke.</em></p><p>But it wasn’t.</p><p>Malfoy took the job and swiftly made his presence known on the floor – delaying law amendments, questioning <em>everything</em> and being an absolute pompous ass. She had tried to be nice, she had tried to let go of her old feelings of anger and prejudice – after all Harry, her best friend, had testified at Malfoy’s hearing and helped get his name cleared and his sentence reduced. Besides, she wasn’t completely heartless, she knew that Malfoy had been ordered by Voldemort to kill Dumbledore at only sixteen years of age. She knew that Voldemort had been living at his house, haunting and tormenting his family at <em>every </em>turn, and that Malfoy had felt obligated to act in order to protect his family. She understood <em>that </em>part of him – she had obliviated her own parents in order to save them and she probably would have done more than that if it was necessary. She knew that at the time he had been just a <em>boy </em>and that the actions of a brainwashed, scared and insecure sixteen-year-old did not define who he could become as a man. He’d done his time and integrated back into society, they’d welcomed him, so, so would she.</p><p>Hence, after the morning meeting she had dropped by his office to say hello, intending to leave him a draft copy of the latest proposal which was being evaluated and offer to catch him up to speed on anything he didn’t understand. She had been intending to, as the saying goes, bury the hatchet and try to at least form some kind of working relationship with the guy since she would now have to include him in regular meetings and get his approval on any proposals before they could proceed. She had smiled when she knocked on his open door, proposal in hand and began her practiced opening line only to find that he completely ignored her. His head was down, quill in hand, and he was looking over something on his desk. Then, as if purposefully, in fact she <em>knew </em>it was purposefully – he slowly raised his head and fixed her with a dark glare.</p><p>
  <em>‘Granger? – did you say something.’</em>
</p><p>She’d bristled at his words. Was he trying to antagonize her? Instead she pushed it down and fixed a tight but firm smile on her lips. She took two steps into his office and dropped the folder on the desk.</p><p>‘<em>I just wanted to give my congratulations,’</em> it had come out much more coldly than she intended but she supposed old habits died hard. ‘<em>This is the latest file that is being evaluated, comments are due by next Wednesday and I do not believe that Mr. Snarlof got to it before retiring. I know it can be difficult to assume a new role mid-project, so if you have any questions just let me know.’</em></p><p>His eyes had darted down to the folder briefly before they locked back on to hers with distain.</p><p><em>‘I’m sure I’ll manage, <u>Granger,</u>’</em> the hatred in her name made her eyes narrow, but she refused to take the bait and left the office quickly.</p><p>At noon that same day Tracey had knocked on her door, handing her the red folder that she had left with Malfoy that morning. She hadn’t bothered hiding her shock at the quick return and couldn’t stop the small smile that edged to the corner of her lips – perhaps things wouldn’t be so bad after all, perhaps Malfoy just wanted to keep his head down and do his job. She’d thanked Tracey and dismissed her from her office. It was – probably the smartest move she made that day – because when she opened the folder, she came face to face with the most red ink she had ever seen in her entire life and realized that going to see Malfoy that morning had been a mistake.</p><p>It was scrawled across the pages, it was crammed into the margins, it even looped over some of the black text. She’d flipped a page over when she’d noticed an arrow pointing at the bottom corner of the sheet only to find a fucking essay on the back – having run out of room on the front to contain all of his comments he’d turned it over and filled the back side. She had skimmed through the pages, her mouth falling open at the rude, insulting and utterly disgusting comments that littered the document. Though curiously, when she’d gotten to the final page of the proposal it wasn’t littered with hate – instead it contained only a single thread of red.</p><p>
  <em>**’Based on the utter rubbish contained within pages 1-6 of this proposal, if you can even call whatever <u>this</u> is a proposal, I am not going to waste my time reviewing yet another page of trash.’**</em>
</p><p>She had sat stunned in her chair, unmoving, unblinking. The red littered pages slid from her hands onto the floor as she stood from her desk, hand clutched to her chest and made her way to the door. She’d walked in a stupor, too blindsided to be rightfully enraged and found herself standing in front of his door. She didn’t bother to knock and just walked in to find him in the same position he’d been in that morning, head hunched over his work.</p><p>
  <em>‘Really Granger, do you have no capacity for etiquette? After asking me to spend my morning reading rubbish you just walk into my office?’</em>
</p><p>Her stupor had vanished in that moment as the deep-seated burning rage she had always held toward Malfoy reignited in her chest and her face twisted into an angry mess.</p><p>
  <em>‘Were you trying to be difficult – or do you just not want this proposal to push through?’</em>
</p><p>
  <em>‘I was trying to do my job Granger, it’s not my fault that proposal is full of holes.’</em>
</p><p><em>‘It’s a <u>first</u> draft Malfoy,’</em> she had said tightly through a clenched jaw. <em>‘The comment process is meant to be constructive, not an opportunity to spew hatred on a page!’</em></p><p><em>‘My comments were constructive – I constructively told you that the proposal was garbage and not to waste my time with bullshit like that again.’ </em>He had sneered at her, goading her, trying to get her to react. ‘<em>next time, provide me with something better than crup shit and I’ll give you constructive feedback.’</em></p><p><em>‘<u>You</u> – are such a pathetic ass!’</em> the words had left her mouth before she could stop them. It had been the first time that she’d ever sworn at work or said anything inappropriate to a coworker. He’d arched a perfect brow at her, and she abruptly turned and left, aware of the fact that his own secretary had heard the exchange.</p><p>At the time she had been ashamed by her actions. They were completely unprofessional, completely irresponsible – though, she firmly believed that they were indeed called for. She even briefly considered apologizing and trying to make amends. The exchange had lingered in her mind and ate away at her over the weekend. She didn’t want to work in a hostile work environment and she certainly did not want to be <em>part </em>of the hostility. But then Monday came, and Malfoy returned mark-ups on a first-round preliminary <em>concept,</em> not even a proposal – a concept, and the scathing commentary had shattered any thoughts she had about making amends.</p><p>Thus, began the next four months of angry letters, occasional screaming, slamming doors, and awkward yet amused looks from co-workers. What shocked her though, more than anything about the situation, was that not only did she <em>not</em> get into trouble for her behaviour – no one even commented on it. Aside from some initial surprise at her change in demeanor, or in Tracey’s case a terrified scream the first time her door slammed open, no one seemed to care that they were constantly at each other’s throats and they didn’t really react to it.</p><p>She found it annoyingly disconcerting until one Saturday night, while having dinner with Harry and Ginny, Harry let it slip that Malfoy had been moved because no one in his previous department could work with him. They had <em>intentionally </em>placed him in a roll that worked closely with her because they figured she, of all people, would be able to work with him calmly due to her natural professionalism. And while they had been wrong about the calmly part – they had somehow, despite the turbulent chaos that was their non-functional working relationship, still managed to get work done. Additionally, or at least allegedly as per Harry, the other more <em>important </em>departments were now able to work with him effectively since his attention and difficult tendencies seemed to be focused on her. So, her coworkers and peers refrained from commenting or complaining about their intense exchanges.</p><p>She’d yelled at Harry for not telling her. Ginny had sat back in amusement and allowed it to happen, casually eating her cake with a smile while Hermione raged and poked her wand into Harry’s chest as he tried to bat it away and crawl out of his chair. She had threated to quit her job – even though she knew it was empty words. She loved her job, she loved protecting creatures that everyone else ignored and took advantage of, she loved helping those in need and making the world a better place. Harry had noted as much during her ranting, calling her out on the fact that she would never actually quit – then he had to quickly duck when Hermione sent a sardine hex at his face. Amongst her rantings and wand wavings, and while Ginny had poured herself a fresh cup of tea only to continue watching the exchange entertained, she had asked <em>why</em> the bloody fuck he wasn’t just fired if he was so fucking difficult to work with all the time.</p><p>The answer to that, according to Harry – was that Malfoy actually did do good work with the remaining departments <em>and, </em>more importantly, he donated a significant amount of money to research every year. So, the Ministry was obliged to keep him employed in some small facet since that was his only request in return. And since they had managed not to set each other on fire yet <em>and </em>because they were in fact getting work done – the Ministry decided to keep him there as it was the best fit for everyone. And by <em>everyone, </em>they meant literally everyone else but her. They clearly did not give a shit about her own mental health and based on the budget cuts they obviously did not find the care of magical creatures important either.</p><p>The elevator chimed and the doors opened quickly as Hermione stepped out to face three employees sitting in cubicles in the center of the large department. She hated that their faces twisted into some deranged sense of enjoyment and they scooted to the end of their seat as if eager to see the next explosion. As if she were some spectacle to behold. She ignored them, turning quickly to her left and marching down the hall toward Malfoy’s office. He sat directly above her by one floor and often times she wondered if he could hear her screaming in rage in her office after he returned a proposal covered in red.</p><p>“Malfoy!” she burst through his door. She didn’t bother knocking, firstly because she didn’t give a shit about his personal space or his privacy – if he wanted to keep people out, he could lock and ward his door. Secondly, because she knew he already heard her coming. The click of her shoes against the stone floor echoed loudly through his department every time she approached. “What the fuck is this?!”</p><p>She slammed the crumpled page down on his desk, jaw clenched tightly as she waited for the inevitable slow gaze he would give her. He raised his head slowly, predictably, fixing her with a pinched stare.</p><p>“You really have no sense of manners do you,” he said darkly, before his eyes flicked down to the page on the desk. “As talented as I am Granger, I don’t speak <em>crumpled paper</em>, so you’re going to have to be a bit more specific.”</p><p>Hermione reached forward, grabbing the page and straightening it out. Her hands thumped loudly against his desk as she did so, slamming her palms across the page as she flattened it and then pointed directly at the paper.</p><p>“I held four meetings on this proposal Malfoy – four! And you were invited to <em>every </em>single one of them, but you didn’t bother to show. This proposal is supposed to be completed by end of week! This is the sort of stuff that should have been addressed <em>weeks </em>ago! Not three days before it is due!”</p><p>“We finally agree,” Malfoy said with a smirk, sitting back in his chair and glaring at her. “These<em> should</em> have been addressed, and yet, you didn’t address them.”</p><p>“You <em>do </em>understand that these comments are <em>permanently </em>recorded right? That this document will be logged forever within the Ministry catalogues and that someone aside from me might see the shit you wrote! It is completely inappropriate to curse and make personal remarks in review comments on a proposal!”</p><p>“Hardly a fitting remark given that you’ve all but destroyed the page with your sweaty hands,” his eyes flicked down to the page before him with disgust. “You can’t seriously expect me to believe you care about the integrity of the catalogue system if <em>that</em> is how you treat your documents.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you attend the meetings Malfoy?” Hermione practically growled, placing both hands on his desk and leaning forward. “I confirmed your availability with Daphne – I even held one of them after hours <em>just </em>so that you could attend.”</p><p>“Unlike you – I actually have more important things to do than sit in review meetings to discuss an idiotic proposal on the protection of Blast-Ended Skrewts!” Malfoy leaned forward, the anger in his voice increasing. “I know that Mr. Snarlof was your own personal carpet and you’re used to getting your way, but I can’t just pass a proposal filled with <em>that </em>many holes.”</p><p>“Please,” Hermione scoffed, leaning back once more and rolling her eyes. “You just <em>hate </em>Blast-Ended Skrewts – you always have, ever since Hogwarts!”</p><p>“They are an illegally crossbred species that are dangerous and violent! You seriously think it is a good idea to <em>pen </em>them in and give them a sanctuary?!”</p><p>“They are crossbred with a Manticore Malfoy! And they have been proven to demonstrate not only sentient behaviour but understanding of human speech! It’s not their fault that they’re aggressive – it’s in their nature! But Luna’s studies have proven, concretely, that they are in fact highly intelligent and therefore, despite being dangerous, their classification has changed, and they <em>must </em>be protected!”</p><p>“At the cost of 50% of your department’s budget – fucking hell Granger! You’re stupider than I thought you were. They’re just going to eat each other once you put them in there!”</p><p>“My department’s budget is not your fucking concern Malfoy! But even if it was, it doesn’t change anything! After their classification was bumped and Luna’s work was published, they’re now considered an endangered species and I am <em>legally </em>obligated to protect them – this proposal has to go through or I’m breeching my contractual, and might I add moral, obligations! If I do nothing, I will lose my job!”</p><p>“So you crammed together a half assed proposal that is completely unthought-out and deprived of any logic and expect me to just approve it?” Malfoy was standing now, his hands planted on the desk and he was glaring at her fiercely. “What about my fucking job?! I’m responsible for signing off on the safety of the proposal and you’ve given me a proposal that hasn’t considered the fucking consequences of penning them in next to a natural gas pocket!!”</p><p>They were both screaming at each other at this point, Hermione was heaving and Malfoy looked ready to spit fire. She would once again be forced to drink a disgusting batch of ‘sore throat be gone’ tonight to amend the damage she was doing to her vocal chords. She had been spending a small fortune on the potion over the last few months. What was worse than that, was that she knew right now at this moment Malfoy’s staff were probably smiling and laughing and enjoying their argument. Like the whole thing was some big fucking joke. This somehow fueled her rage more and her hands balled into fists at her side.</p><p>“I didn’t know about the natural gas pocket! Do you seriously think I am that stupid?!”</p><p>“Well you’re not giving me much else to go on here – didn’t you do a geo-check?”</p><p>“No! Obviously not, otherwise I would have addressed that!” She seethed, her hands were back on his desk now and they were both leering at each other.</p><p>“Why the fuck not?! That should have been the first thing that you did! You’re talking about penning in violently flammable cre–“</p><p>“BECAUSE I’M UP TO MY FUCKING EYEBALLS IN PROPOSALS MALFOY!” Hermione pushed off his desk and threw her hands to her sides in frustration before dragging them through her hair.</p><p>Her heart was racing, her breath was catching in her chest, she was so angry she could hardly breath. She started pacing in his office before his desk. She was losing any tiny shred of composure she had left – though arguably there was none of that left, who was she kidding, it was gone the second she screamed in her office. But now she was on the edge of falling apart before him because the reality was, he was right. Every single comment he had made, although cruel and rude, had been right. The proposal was severely lacking, she had not had the time to properly check it and had irresponsibly relied on her assistant.</p><p>She hated herself for it – it was fundamentally so unlike her that it made her feel sick. Her job had become so strenuous and exhausting she couldn’t keep up with everything or oversee every report. She was doing the role of three people and the workload of the department had doubled since the war. Yet they refused to hire more staff. It was no wonder her predecessor had died from a heart attack – that was how she got this role and now it was slowly killing her too.</p><p>“Then get help – otherwise someone is going to end up getting KILLED by one of these!” He picked up the crumpled paper and sneered at it, dropping it back down to the desk in one swift motion.</p><p>“I DO have help,’ she spat back at him. “I sent Anton out to do the preliminary check of the land, it’s not like I didn’t know that it needed to be looked at before the proposal was finished. But I couldn’t get to it myself and I was boxed into a corner with the deadline on the Centaur Incorporation Regulation – so I had to pass a lot of the inspection tasks to him and <em>unfortunately</em>, as you can clearly see – he is an incompetent twat!”</p><p>“So then get <em>MORE</em> help, having an incompetent assistant is not an excuse for this crap!”</p><p>“I <em>can’t</em> get more help because, as you so kindly pointed out, my department’s funding has been cut, YET AGAIN!” she stormed back to his desk and slammed her hands down once more. “Everyone wants to feel fucking great and right the wrongs from before the war, but <em>no one </em>wants to pay for it!”</p><p>“So why not just fire the assistant you have and get a competent one?” Malfoy challenged, giving her a nasty look. He didn’t flinch at her closeness across the desk and if anything, he only leaned in further as if trying to get her to back off.</p><p>“I tried to!” she breathed through clenched teeth and glared at him with all the hatred she could muster. “But there is nowhere for my assistant to be transferred and there is no interest from anyone else to join my department right now.”</p><p>“Well – if that’s not a statement about you and your work than I don’t know what is.” His scoff was arrogant and pleased.</p><p>“It’s not about <em>ME</em> you fucking twat! It’s <em>YOU</em>! You <em>ruin</em> all my meetings, you torment my staff and you make our department a living hell! So now I’m stuck with Anton, who doesn’t know a god damned rock from a firecrab, and he didn’t think to complete a basic geo-check of the proposed land!”</p><p>“Pftt,” Malfoy scoffed in her face. “I would have thought that would be training 101 Granger, you’ve done a terrible job. How could he possibly not know he needed to complete a check?”</p><p>“Probably because he is a pureblood asshat who hates me! He doesn’t actually care about his job because he’s essentially a trust fund baby and he’s never considered or bothered to understand basic science – like the potential of an explosion from a natural gas pocket!”</p><p>“Wow,” he snorted, arching a brow at her and finally leaning back as he crossed his arms over his chest. “And you say <em>I’m</em> blood prejudiced.”</p><p>“Arrghh!!” She dropped her head toward his desk, her shoulders slumping as she bit her tongue in rage. “<em>You</em> are insufferable!”</p><p>“And yet, unsurprisingly, I’m still correct.” he said snidely pointing to the crumpled page below her hanging head. She could see his stupid perfectly manicured hand in front of her, tapping the crumpled paper under her nose. “This proposal is riddled with issues, and I will <em>not </em>approve it.”</p><p><em>I fucking hate him</em>, she felt like crying in exasperation. She felt like running back to her desk, gathering her belongings and never coming back. She fucking hated him. Bastard. She hated that he was right. She was so incredibly angry with herself and the situation she was in. She hated that this piece of crap proposal had her name on it and that she was even required to write it at all. Protecting Blast-Ended Skrewts in a pen was the most insane idea she’d ever come across, but her hand had been forced by her boss.</p><p>“Fuck I hope your hand hurts,” she breathed out, she had no doubt it ghosted against his skin as she raised her head to look at him. Her arms bracing her against the desk in between them as she fixed him with her hatred. “I hope it seizes – and aches, and renders you completely useless after all that writing.”</p><p>“Think again,” he snorted in derision. “My pens are charmed to prevent <em>exactly</em> that from happening.”</p><p>He paused, watching as Hermione’s eyes grew a bit wider and her face tinted a darker shade of pink. She knew what was coming. Then he smirked.</p><p>“Had to – once I saw the shit you were sending out for review it was necessary.”</p><p>Hermione flared with anger, she could physically feel it burning through her veins. She snatched the crumpled paper violently from the desk before she did something she would truly regret and left his office with a slam of his door.</p><p> </p>
