  <b>-Aftermath of the Second Battle of Passchendaele; November 10th, 1917; Wizarding Frontlines-</b>
</p><p>The first time he met Percival Graves, he was atop a furious Ukrainian Ironbelly with his hair spilling over his eyes due to his lost hairtie. </p><p>He wrenched on Justifiat's shoulder spines and the dragon arched his neck in an attempt to bite at Newt's thigh. </p><p>"Justifiat," he grumbled irritably, "you'd better have good reason for your fractiousness." </p><p>The dragon bulged in distress at the fallen soldier in American colors, shallow breathing the only indicator of life amongst the mud and blood and—</p><p>Newt batted his thought process away, tapping Justifiat's ribs gently in order to get him to land. </p><p>He hurried over and almost recoiled when he saw the MACUSA flag patch. An American out in this hellish landscape was the last thing he expected but, well, it was <i>war</i> after all. </p><p>Newt didn't dare use Lumos in the failing light, merely grunting as he hefted the other man over his shoulder, mumbling apologies for his awkward angles and sharp shoulders. </p><p>"<i>Accio</i> wand." A single wand, rowan by sight, shifted up and into the man's wrist sheathe. </p><p>All he got in reply was a low groan but it was enough in this forefront of hellish mechanizations. </p><p>A tiny spark of life in this place full of those bound for the Fields of Death.</p>
<hr/><p>Landing with a passenger in the middle of the field meant for the Wizarding half of the war effort brought forth an explosion of noise. </p><p>"Sgt. Scamander, what is the meaning of—By Merlin's linen drawers, is that—?" </p><p>"Someone from the American side, yes, and the only one to make it out." Newt confirmed as he dismounted Justifiat and led the Ironbelly by his chin into the dragon pens. </p><p>"No bridle again, Scamander! They need the training!" </p><p>"Justifiat will chew right through the flame guard and you know it, Hillard." Newt fired back as he chucked his mount under his craw. "Won't you, you great big wyrm?" The dribbled propellant had Hillard backing up but Newt only huffed and wiped it off on the flame-retardant fencing. "Who's a good beastie, hmm? <i>You are~</i>" </p><p>"Can't tell you Scamanders a damn thing, can we?" Hillard ribbed him with a fond snort. </p><p>"Liam, you mean Newie, don't you? I would never in a hundred years-" Theseus had a hand over his chest, looking mortally offended.  </p><p>"<i>Both</i> of you act as though these dragons wouldn't make you a snack in half-a-heartbeat if you removed the saddles." Liam countered. "Hero or not, you don't take the right precautions." </p><p>Theseus sobered at that, a scowl where teasing had been. "You know I hate that, Hillard." </p><p>It was the worst kept secret in the British section of the Wizarding Camp, honestly; everyone knew the Scamanders were of a kind with the Ironbellies, the Greens and the singular Black they had in their Company (much to the MacFusty's chagrin). </p><p>Draco corde protulerium, better known as Dragon Heart, was considered a neutral trait, so long as the families it ran in were correspondingly behaved. The Scamanders—as Newt had come to learn—were considered chaotic good. </p><p>The yell from the Infirmary tent had Newt bolting for it, his coltish limbs (as Mummy put it) coursing over the frosted ground. </p><p>"Unhand me, I need to-" the graveled voice had Newt interested even as dark eyes flashed like that of a dragon. He skirted around the Healers, got in between them and the soldier and raised both hands in the international symbol for surrender. </p><p>"You're in the British Camp and you're the only survivor. I picked you up, do you remember?" He soothed, slowly lowering his hands while keeping them in the sight of the other soldier. "I'm Sgt. Scamander of the Dragon Retention Unit. May I know your name?" </p><p>"Captain Graves, Warlock Rearguard Squadron... Though I suspect I'll be transferred now." Graves, Graves, Graves.... Why was the name ringing a bell? "My ancestor was of the original American Aurors." Newt nearly yelped at the response. "You were muttering it, Sgt. Scamander." </p><p>"My, ah, my apologies. You should let the Healers see to you." Newt couldn't meet the man's eyes for more than a moment, his bravery long dashed against the frost. </p><p>"Sgt. Scamander?" </p><p>"Yes, Captain Graves?" Newt held onto himself by sheer force of will, hazel locking briefly with fathomless dark pools. </p><p>"Thank you." </p><p>"You're welcome, Captain."</p>
<hr/><p>He lost himself in the dragon pens, particularly that of the sole Hebridean Black whom he'd named Gladiolus. All of the dragons had names and feelings; Newt felt more at home in the enclosure than he ever did around people. </p><p>A throat clearing at the edge of Gladio's pen had him looking up out of habit. Gladio huffed out a faint fog but went back to stuffing most of his face into Newt's lap. Newt absently scratched and received a soft rumble in response. </p><p>"I was told I'd find you here." Captain Graves' repaired uniform only made him seem sterner, the severity of the silver in the black hair only emphasizing the impression. "I would make amends, as it were." </p><p>"What for Captain?" Newt blurted. He was about to apologize again when the man gave a soft chuckle. </p><p>"I'm well aware that my reputation precedes me but you need not fear me. My Division won't be able to take me back until morning with the Wards being up for the night. I was hoping I'd be able to dine with my rescuer, if you wouldn't mind?" </p><p>"Of course, Captain." </p><p>"Percival." </p><p>"Huh?" Newt was in the middle of shuffling Gladio's head off of his lap. </p><p>"My given name. I hear enough of my rank as it is; being an ordinary Wizard for one night would be welcome." The faint smile softened the man's face, enough to where Newt's tense shoulders relaxed. </p><p>"Newt, then, if we're giving names." He offered with a rueful grin of his own.</p>
<hr/><p>Graves (Percival, his mind insisted) listened intently as Newt expounded on his book, still in pieces and bits of parchment stuck together with sheer will and a half-hearted Charm or two. </p><p>He talked about the trips he wanted to go on, gesticulating as he did with These and then he froze mid-point. </p><p>"I am so sorry! I've been blathering on about such a boring subject and I'm sure you'd like to..." </p><p>"I quite enjoyed it, actually." Percival murmured. "I find myself surprised at some of your work but it suits you. Please, by all means, continue." </p><p>Newt opened his mouth and all that came out was a surprised croak. </p><p>"Have some Fire Whiskey and tell me more; I think you were expounding on... What were they, Occamies?" </p><p>He blamed the fire and the bitter cold for the flush that caught his cheeks.</p>
