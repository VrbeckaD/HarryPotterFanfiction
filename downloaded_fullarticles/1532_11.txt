    <p>Tom was still there with him, he would stay. There was the blood that Harry chose to ignore and the limp lifeless way that Tom didn’t hold all of his weight, or any of it. Tom was staying with him, his pet was staying with him. Tom had promised that he would stay, so he would stay. He couldn’t lose him. Harry held the body so tight that he could feel arms going funny. </p><p>And then he didn’t. Harry shot up from his bed, breathing hard, hands clean from blood like they had never cut so deep into Tom’s body. Like Tom wasn’t dead. It was worse, sobbing without even having Tom’s body to hold onto. Now that Tom had completely left him and what would be left? What else did he have that could remotely compare to his pet? Nothing, the answer was nothing.</p><p>Then a truly desperate thought rushed through him, his hands were clean, he was in his pajamas and he didn’t remember coming back to Hogwarts. Only holding Tom’s limp lifeless body and then...not. He could have been dreaming. He almost shouted it to the rest of his dorm “It was a dream.” He could see Tom’s mangled body when he closed his eyes and he didn’t notice how badly his hands were shaking.</p><p>And then he remembered yesterday, he had cursed Tom so cruelly, Tom was wonderful and didn’t deserve that. In the dream, everything had become twisted and hopeless after that day. In the dream, he had walked away while Tom was still shaking, but in real life, he had held him. Harry would rather die than see Tom fade into that shell again...but he had held Tom yesterday. </p><p>It might be hopeless, he may have already shattered the person that he loved, but it could be different. It was just a dream. Tom was alive, probably, and Harry had held him after the pain. Tom had seemed alright, reactive, then. There was hope. Even if something was wrong, Harry might still have time. Harry could barely even make himself hope that Tom was alive and whenever Harry blinked he could see Tom’s corpse and the vision left him cold and desperate. It seemed impossible to believe that Tom was alive</p><p>He grabbed his wand frantically and cast a tempus. It was before two in the morning. If he hurried he could still see Tom, though he would have gone regardless of the time. He could…Tom wasn’t dead, he wasn’t dead. Harry told himself that again and again. It was the only thing keeping himself from falling apart. It didn’t seem real. Harry rushed down to the kitchens.</p><p>Painting, tickle the pear… a dozen House-Elves looked up at Harry with wide eyes, one of them dropped a wooden spoon. Harry was doubled over and panting. “Dobby…” Harry was forced to stop to breathe. “Can someone get me Dobby?”</p><p>Thankfully House Elves were naturally helpful and obedient so one of them quickly popped off allowing Harry to catch his breath instead of repeating himself. Sure enough seconds latter Dobby popped into the kitchen.</p><p>“What can Dobby be’s doing for the great Harry Potter?”</p><p>“Can you give Tom…” wait, Dobby didn’t know that Voldemort’s name was Tom. “Voldemort, a message from me?”</p><p>“At this hour sir?”</p><p>“Yes, wait… you can take notes, right? Could you take a person? Me, for example?” How had he not thought of this sooner?</p><p>“Yes, but The Great Harry Potter should be's staying at Hogwarts, where it’s safe.”</p><p>“Please Dobby, I really need to see him, it would mean everything to me if you could help me.” Harry had had the elf at ‘please’.</p><p>Tom was lying in an extravagant, larger than king-sized bed, his chest gently rising and falling. Harry’s heart lurched at the sight, and he froze, too afraid to move and disturb the practically heart-wrenching sight of Tom before him, breathing and alive. Tendrils of terror that had wrapped themselves around Harry's heart were slowly loosening with the sight of his Pet. He could cry. He did cry, but he was smiling as the tears fell. Eventually, he pulled himself out of it and wiped the tears off his face. </p><p>“Pet” Harry said softly and shook Tom gently.</p><p>Tom startled, face looking back and forth in the completely wrong direction. It was undeniably cute and it Harry smiled lightly. Tom’s actions warmed something in his heart that he had previously shoved down and ignored when watching Tom sleep. The actions were lively in a way that dream Tom wasn’t. Harry could focus, he could breathe.</p><p>Harry lightly turned Tom’s face so that it was facing him. “I’m here Pet. Sorry for waking you.” Tom smiled lightly face warming and eyes shining, looking up at Harry like he made the world spin. It was the way Tom always looked at him, and it was shameful that Harry hadn’t noticed it until now. He should have noticed sooner. At least the dread that had wound tight around his heart, and made it hard to breathe since that nightmare, unwound at the expression. Tom could smile; Tom wasn’t broken yet. </p><p>He couldn’t stop himself from pulling Tom into his chest and wrapping his arms around his pet so that he could feel Tom’s chest rise and fall gently as he breathed. People only breathed when they were alive. The motion quieted the dark parts of him that were shaking and terrified. Tom was alive, whole and his.</p><p>He was being stupid and overreacting but he didn’t care. He had rushed over here because of a vivid nightmare, that was only a nightmare and he had proof of that in his arms. Nothing that had happened in that nightmare was true, Tom was alive and things Tom had told him in that nightmare weren’t necessarily true. This Tom wasn’t the same one that he had begun to fall in love with. That thought hurt vaguely but it barely even registered. He had Tom alive and unbroken in his arms, that was everything and Harry would do anything to keep things that way.</p><p>“I’m so glad to see you, My Lord. I’d much rather see you than sleep.” No, he wasn’t being stupid. Harry held Tom gently so he could breathe normally and Harry could better feel the subtle rise and fall of Tom’s chest. It was only a nightmare, Tom was alive.</p><p>“Same pet,” Harry spoke the words into Tom’s ear. What did he do now? As much as Harry wanted to hold Tom until every fear quieted, there was something long overdue. “Hey Pet, why did you become a dark lord?”</p><p>The answer was almost identically to what Tom had told him in that nightmare. Some words were different, Tom talked less in general, the entire thing was more summarized. He talked more about the horrible things in his childhood that led to his way of thinking, more about his regret for the awful things that he had done. He barely even mentioned the people that he’d killed, he certainly didn’t tell Harry about when he ordered senior Death Eaters to teach the unforgivables to new recruits and all the tortured muggles that they practiced on. And of course, it was delivered with emotion, pleading at points and ashamed at others. Harry was so relieved at the emotion that he could barely listen to the words.</p><p>Harry could barely believe it. It was everything he could have wanted, Having the Tom from that nightmare alive and unbroken in his arms reacting so perfectly. There was kindness, and a childhood that Harry couldn’t help but relate to, and Harry’s breath was shaky and his heart was filled with so much fondness. Tom was his perfection and Harry couldn’t help but fear that this was just a dream, a desperate illusion that would slip away from him. If this was a dream, he never wanted to wake up. </p><p>“You don't have any reason to believe me, especially after telling you about how I learned to view lying as normal. I could give a wizard’s oath to prove it.”</p><p>Harry hated it, but he needed to know. “Did you influence my dreams or anything recently pet?” please say no, please say no.</p><p>“No My Lord,” Harry let out the breath he had been holding “Not after I…” Tom’s voice went quiet and shy, Harry could only guess what Toms' face looked like. “sucked a dildo to tempt you.” Harry turned Tom’s head towards him; the angle must have been uncomfortable for Tom. His face was an adorable red. </p><p>Harry couldn’t help but lean in and kiss him lightly. Tom’s lips were soft despite how thin they looked and Tom jerked slightly in surprise before letting out a small pleased sound while sliding slightly down so his face could be tilted up into the kiss. It was sweet and light and Harry pulled back before even opening Tom’s mouth. Tom was smiling, not as much as he did during some pain, but he looked happy and Harry wanted to give him everything he wanted.</p><p>“Could I have that vow now please pet?” He hated the mistrust, but Tom had offered and it wouldn’t break his Pet.</p><p>“Yes, of course, My Lord.” Tom held up his wand and did a quick motion making threads grow out of it. “I swear on my magic, that everything I have said so far this night is true. So mote it be.”</p><p>There was a sharp burst of light then Tom gestured to the dresser and with a flick of his wand it was floating. So things in the dream were true, but Tom didn’t instigate it. Harry didn’t know how that nightmare happened and he didn’t care. There was enough that he didn’t know about magic that it seemed vaguely possible, it was enough that Tom wasn’t dead. And if it was some sort of trick or illusion he didn’t want to know. He didn’t want to prod, only to have everything shatter and wake up to Tom being dead.</p><p>He had Tom, alive and whole, smiling and living. He had the person that he had begun to fall in love with back in that nightmare. Tom was a person that had lived a life ripe with unforgivable actions that Harry couldn’t help but forgive. Tom was someone who he could relate to, and there was kindness in him, just very misguided. He was also a person that Harry was almost in love with, who mattered more than anything else. Harry couldn’t lose him no matter what, doing that again would be worse than dying. He wanted to give Tom everything that he had promised in that nightmare, he never wanted to let him go.</p><p>“My Lord...are you mad at me?”</p><p>“No, I’m thinking Pet, you are perfect” Harry didn’t miss the sharp inhale that Tom let out at the statement. So Tom liked endearments and praise. “You’re so good for me Pet” He had been so unobservant before. Harry trailed a hand up and down Tom’s side and Tom’s breathing became the perfect kind of irregular.</p><p>Sure this Tom would be happy to take Harry’s cruelty and he would endure the lack of affection that Harry had previously been willing to give him. He would figure out a way to keep his Death eaters in line even though he hated it and he wouldn’t ask for more than stolen nights. But he deserved better and Harry wanted to give him everything that he wanted. In retrospect the answer was simple.</p><p>“Pet, would you like to run away with me?”</p><p>Harry wanted Tom in his arms, always. He didn’t care that he was changing all his ideas, all his plans because of a nightmare. This was the only option worth considering.</p><p>“Yes!” Tom almost shouted, interrupting Harry and turning his head back towards Harry. He was beaming. </p><p>Harry laughed slightly at Tom’s eagerness and smiled. He looked so perfect like this, full of life. “I didn’t finish yet pet. We could travel the world. You could teach me magic, Hogwarts is pretty incompetent, you’d probably do better. Ah, what else? I’d cut you up really nicely and let you pleasure me whenever you wanted. I’d hold you afterwards. We could sleep together...Maybe muggles have made more of the bomb things you talked about, we could get rid of them. So what do you say?”</p><p>“Yes, please, I want that so much My Lord, It sounds perfect My Lord. When can we leave My Lord?”</p><p>In that dream, Harry would have left that very same night if Tom had agreed and wanted it. He would still leave this very night it Tom needed it, but it would be responsible to say goodbye to friends. Tom wasn’t in danger of dying, he didn’t need Harry with him right at that very second. “Three days, how’s that pet? I’ll see you again and we’ll leave everything behind us.”</p><p>“Yes My Lord. Three days is...”</p><p>“I will be bring everything that I think we could need, but I might miss something. Can you also bring everything you think we might need?”</p><p>“You don't need to bring anything My Lord, I can bring everything. It might be hard to acquire things while you're still in school.”</p><p>“Generous pet, but no. why don't we go shopping and get everything together before we leave.”</p><p>“Yes My Lord.”</p><p>“In the meantime could you make sure that authorities apprehend your more destructive Death Eaters like Bellatrix Lestrange?”</p><p>“Of course My Lord.”</p><p>“Good Pet.” Harry leaned in and kissed him short and sweet once more.</p><p>“I will see you in three days, Monday night, midnight at our clearing. Will you apparate me back to the clearing Pet?”</p><p>“Yes My Lord...My Lord, I’m so happy, I can’t wait.”</p><p>“I’m glad pet.”</p><p>Tom hesitated before speaking. “You don’t have to do this, My Lord, I like what we have now. I want what you offered...so much, but I don’t need it. You have friends here.”</p><p>“No Pet, I want this as well. My friends will move on, I’ll move on. There’s always post.” Harry didn’t want anything more than this either. He was so happy.</p><p>“Alright. Are you ready for me to apparate you, My Lord? It is unpleasant.”</p><p>“Just a second.” Harry summoned a knife and pushed Tom back onto the bed harshly before moving his hand so that it caressed Tom’s neck to the point where it should be painful. When he heard a small moan Harry pushed down Tom’s nightshirt and made a slow, deep cut under Tom’s collarbone that had his Pet taking in shaky breaths and letting out a loud moan. When Harry pulled back the knife, he stoked Tom hard over his clothes with enough pressure to almost completely negate the pleasure. Tom moaned very loudly regardless and Harry was half-drunk on it, completely addicted to Tom’s expressions and noises. He had always been but had just been too stubborn to admit it. He reluctantly healed the cut.</p><p>“There pet, now I’m ready.”</p><p>“J-just a minute.” Tom was panting lightly, so visibly affected. It made Harry want to work him over until he was screaming, but then again, he just wanted to do that in general. Of course, he didn’t have much time now and he would have all the time in the world after three days. </p><p>When Tom did apparate them back to the clearing, it was very unpleasant. And then Harry had to let go. It hurt so much that the pain was almost physical. Every fear that had quieted while he had Tom in his arms came rushing back. When he looked away he could barely breathe. He kept expecting to turn around and find Tom’s dead and bloody body. He couldn’t breathe right or think right and after barely five seconds he couldn’t help but look back at Tom to sooth that thing gawing in his chest. Tom might not need Harry with him at that very second, but Harry needed Tom. There was no way that he could stand three days apart.</p><p>“I’ve changed my mind, I’ll be back in a few hours, we’ll leave then. Ok pet?”</p><p>“Yes My Lord. My Lord, I’m so happy.” That expression on Tom’s face was everything.</p><p>“That’s good Pet, come here.” Harry loved how Tom looked at him, loved how beautifully Tom obeyed him.</p><p>Harry pulled Tom against him so that there was no space between them and kissed Tom hard. Harry pushed his tongue into Tom’s mouth and greedily explored Tom’s mouth. The way Tom melted against him was divine. When he bit down hard enough to taste blood on Tom’s lower lip, Tom moaned into Harry’s mouth. Harry could have continued like that for hours but the sooner he pulled away, the sooner they could leave. That didn’t make it any easier to pull away.</p>
