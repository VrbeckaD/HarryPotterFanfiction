    <p class="p1">There are people who walk into battle helms high and breastplates shined.</p><p class="p1">And there are those whose fight takes them deep into the Dark, where the mark of the enemy covers all glory and the filth of the fight is the only thing an outsider can see.</p><p class="p1">There is often no distinguishing line between bravery and survival, despite how badly people want there to be.</p><p class="p1">This, then, is not everyoneâ€™s story, nor would I ever wish it to be. This is the story of how darkness can give as much as the light, and that love sometimes evades death by mere fractions of a second.</p><p class="p1">And finally, this is a story that warns not to dismiss the ugliness in people, but to embrace it as your own, for that is truly where you will find peace.</p><p class="p1">I am Adeline, and this is my story.</p>
