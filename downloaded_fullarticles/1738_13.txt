    <p> ‟I’m so happy to see that everyone is here for today’s group meeting. Of course, I know that the real reason as to why you are all here is because you wanted to see me!” Gilderoy Lockhart declared as he all but giggled out loud. ‟And I don’t blame you for this. It really does flatter me that even the Dark Arts’ representatives are here!”</p><p>As if on cue, everyone in the room stared at Vinda Rosier and Gellert Grindelwald, who had arrived late to the meeting, as usual.</p><p>The two students were famous for their surreal beauty, their tendency to jinx and throw hexes at everyone who got in their way and the fact that they were quasi-inseparable.</p><p>It was a known fact among the student body that one was rarely seen without the other.</p><p>At first, most had thought that the two were an item…Until Grindelwald had shown up in Demonology with a shirt on which was plainly written ‘GAY dark wizard and proud' which had quickly clarified things up for everyone.</p><p>Plus, there were rumors about Rosier too, so…</p><p>‟You should all be glad that we even showed up in the first place,” Gellert replied as Vinda gracefully sat down on the last worn out couch that wasn’t occupied in the room.‟I still can’t believe the Muggle Studies are hosting this year’s event,” the blonde added darkly as he sat down next to his best friend.</p><p>‟Well, if you hadn’t flipped a switch and yelled at the first years, calling them ‘bloody idiots’ and ‘incapable cockroaches’, the Dark Arts might have won last year,” slyly replied Elphias Doge, who was sitting across from him.</p><p>Gellert quirked an eyebrow at the ugly third year.‟What about you, Doge? What did you do to help your team win?”</p><p>‟If you remember correctly, I wasn’t there last year,” Elphias replied as he scratched his left arm in embarrassment.‟I was too busy not dying of the Dragon Pox.”</p><p>Minerva McGonagall, a Transfiguration major, glared at Gellert.</p><p>It was a known fact that she particularly despised the spoiled brat attitude of Grindelwald.</p><p>The tall brunette was also the best of friends with Doge and Dumbledore, two of Gellert’s least favorite persons in the world, which automatically placed her on the same list.</p><p>Hector Abernathy, a foreign student from the United States who rarely uttered a word, something that had sparked the rumor that he might be mute, looked back and forth between the two.</p><p>‟Might I remind you that I’m also tied to the department of Divination and that we literally crushed your team the year prior to last?” Gellert smoothly replied. ‟If the Dark Arts had won last year, I would have been on the winning team two years in a row. I must let the common folks win sometimes…”</p><p>Both he and Vinda looked smug at that point.</p><p>‟Won’t you shut up? I have a meeting with Umbridge at 2 and I would hate to be late.” Travers replied.</p><p>The Magical Law student always reported everything to their rectress, which apart from being annoying, was downright unhealthy.</p><p>Who wanted to spend time with that crazy woman by their free will, anyway?</p><p>Just as Gellert opened his mouth to throw something back at Travers and Doge, Albus Dumbledore, who had kept silent as of now, let out an annoyed sigh and placed the book he was reading down.</p><p>The latter was top of his class, majoring in Transfiguration and had a weird fashion sense. Today, he was wearing dark green jeans with a purple shirt and red shoes.</p><p>Everyone stared at the two geniuses, as it seemed another heated debate was about to go down between them.</p><p>You see, the thing was that Dumbledore and Grindelwald hated each other with a passion.</p><p>Their rivalry had even almost reached a legendary level at that point.</p><p>More often than not, the two could be seen arguing all over the campus grounds. Both Abernathy and Doge, used to stick by their respective friend, braced themselves for the epic discussion that was yet to come.</p><p>Surely enough, Gellert licked his lips, turned around with a nasty look on his elegant face and was about to snap something back at Albus, when he realized that everyone in the room was glaring at him. Even Vinda poked him in the ribs to show him to let it go for now.</p><p>Well, everyone was staring at him except Horace Slughorn, one of the university’s few Potions students, who was too busy checking the selling price of some obscure potion ingredients online than to partake in this heated argument.</p><p>Silenced for now, the blonde crossed his arms over his chest, placed one leg over the couch’s arm and propped the other against a writing desk as he leaned back in his seat; looking both handsome and murderous at the same time.</p><p>Abernathy, who hadn’t done much so far, gave a thumb up to Lockhart to warn him that all the arguing was over and that their meeting could on.</p><p>Of course, the latter, who had been too busy snapping yet again another selfie of himself, had been oblivious to what had been going on around him, which was classic Lockhart.</p><p>The pompous git giggled some more.‟I’m so sorry everyone! It would have been a crime if I hadn’t taken a picture of myself as soon as possible.  My hair looks so luscious today,” he apologized as Minerva facepalmed and Travers groaned.</p><p>Lockhart smiled some more before he went on. Slughorn finally put his phone down.‟As you all know, the Muggle Studies have won last year’s integration week’s competition, which means we had the honor of picking this year’s activities.”</p><p>Albus and Elphias nodded at Lockhart’s words, while Travers glanced at his watch and groaned out of annoyance for the third time in the last five minutes.</p><p>‟Well, I’m pleased to tell you that we are going to spend a delightful week in a muggle inn. Of course, during our stay there, we will partake in some various and fun muggle activities. You are all responsible for promoting the event to your respective department, since I am way too busy to do so. Looking good takes a lot of my free time, you know!” Lockhart dazzled them with a smile and a wink, while Travers quickly got up and left the room.</p><p>Gellert and Vinda shared a look of boredom as the others all got up and left to return to their respective classes.</p><p>Soon enough, the two Dark Arts students were the only ones left with Lockhart. The latter seemed to be quite pleased by that fact…</p><p>‟You know, <em>Gellert,”</em> the way Lockhart was insisting on the first syllable of his name made Gellert’s skin crawl as Vinda had some difficulty to stifle her laughter. ‟If we dated and ended up married, all of our initials would be “G”s. How cute would that be?”</p><p>Gellert shuddered at the thought, while Vinda was in stitches at his side.</p><p>Needless to say that the two quickly walked out of the room in order to get as far away from Lockhart as possible.</p><p>The thing was that Gellert didn’t like to be reminded of this story too much, but a few years ago, if Vinda hadn’t been there to save his sorry ass and to protect his reputation, he would have ended up pissed drunk and naked in Lockhart’s bed.</p><p>Since the incident, Lockhart, who had been less drunk than Gellert at the time, had some hope that a romance would blossom between the two and had declared more than once that after himself, Gellert was the most handsome guy on campus.</p><p>Which as long as Gellert was breathing and Vinda was by his side,  was never going to occur!</p><p>As the two best friends headed out to lunch, Gellert pulled his phone out and rolled his eyes at Dumbledore’s reply to his latest tweet. Couldn’t that git understand how wrong he was?</p><p align="center">∞</p><p>Everything had begun on Twitter, as usual.</p><p>Grindelwald had posted something dumb –to nobody’s surprise– and Albus had had no other choice but to answer something back. Unfortunately, like every other time, the characters allowed on this social media hadn’t been enough for them to express their opinion and to pursue their debate. They needed another way to argue and it was the sole reason why Albus had accepted to enter Grindelwald’s number in his phone’s repertory.</p><p>Which was why he was once more lying on his bed and debating with a dark wizard about the importance of the Statue of Secrecy.</p><p>Of course, Grindelwald had good arguments and Albus wanted to agree to everything he was saying; especially when the latter used such a charming tone.</p><p>Yet, Albus knew better than that. Grindelwald seemed to appreciate his opposition, even though he couldn’t help himself from teasing him from time to time.</p><p>“Albus! Dinner’s served!” His mother, Kendra, suddenly called from downstairs.</p><p>However, Albus was way too into what Grindelwald was saying to pay attention to her.</p><p>After all, their discussion was once more so interesting and Grindelwald’s voice was so appealing, even on the phone, that Albus continued to speak and speak as he answered Gellert’s arguments with his own.</p><p>Because of his passionate discussion with his nemesis, the redhead didn’t hear his mother call him for the second time in a row; which was why he was quite surprised when his bedroom door opened with way more violence than it was necessary and slammed into the wall.</p><p>Albus, startled, almost dropped his phone. Still in communication with Grindelwald, he tried to hide it, but he visibly failed because Aberforth rolled his eyes at him and said: “Come on! Mum is calling for you downstairs… Hey! Who are you talking to?  Still the same dude?”</p><p>“<em>No!</em> No one!” Albus protested.</p><p>He could hear Gellert yell something back on the phone: “<em>Excuse me?</em> I am Gellert Grindelwald! Not a nobody!” but it didn’t last long because Albus briskly cut the line.</p><p>His face was so red at that point that it was competing with his hair.</p><p>“No one? Really?” Aberforth mocked him. “That’s why you have called him almost every day since we are back to school?”</p><p>“Why  do you say “him”?” Albus stumbled. “It’s… it’s a girl! I was speaking with a girl!”</p><p>“Oh? A girl? Who is she? Your girlfriend? She had such a deep voice…” Aberforth smiled nastily at him. ‟ I hope I’ll get to see her at the integration week!”</p><p>Then, before Albus could have done anything to prevent it, Aberforth yelled: “Mom! Albus has a girlfriend!”</p><p>“Abe!” Albus shouted in return, while he ran after him as if they were children still.</p><p>Albus stumbled in the stairs behind Aberforth, since the latter stopped in the middle of his run to turn around and to face him: “I’m eagerly waiting for the day that you are going to present your bitch to mom. She is going to be ecstatic!” He sneered. “And I will laugh so much at you, you have no idea.”</p><p>And with that being said, Abe ran all the way downstairs and Albus followed him just as quickly.</p><p>When they arrived in the kitchen, Ariana and his mother were already installed at the table and ready to eat.</p><p>Kendra stared at her youngest son. “What did you say Abe? I didn’t hear you…”</p><p>“I said that Albus has finally a girlfriend, mum! Isn’t that great?”</p><p>“Aberforth! Stop this nonsense!” Albus protested again.</p><p>Why was his brother doing this? He was making him embarrassed and was laughing at his expense, the <em>idiot</em>! Yet, this wasn’t surprising: they had both been mocking each other since they were kids and since they didn’t get along very well back then, it was only natural that they had continued as adults.</p><p>Not that Albus was really considering his brother as an adult; but more like an irritating brat.</p><p>Unfortunately, this didn’t prevent his mother from listening to Aberforth’s silly remark.</p><p>“What? Did you finally confess your feelings to Minerva? The poor girl has probably been waiting after you for years!”</p><p>“Minerva? Oh Merlin, no!” Albus chocked on his saliva.</p><p>His mother had always wanted to pair them up since their first year at Hogwarts and she was without a doubt convinced that the two would end up married one day. Of course, she was utterly wrong: Minerva knew very well that Albus wasn’t interested in women and so did Elphias. The two were the only ones aware of this – without taking into account Aberforth, of course, who seemed to have a lot of suspicions about his brother's sexuality.</p><p>“Oh…” His mother said, visibly disappointed. “I hope the poor girl isn’t too sad about this. She has been running after you for so long now... Don’t be too distant with her now that you are dating someone else. Friends are still important…”</p><p>Albus was an inch away from eating his hat out of frustration.</p><p>Why was his mother like that?</p><p>Couldn’t she try to match Aberforth instead? Of course not, since she was counting on Albus to bring glory to their family.</p><p>She was way more lenient with her two other children.</p><p>“Mom! I’m seeing no one! Aberforth is saying stupid things to bother me, that’s all. I am way too busy to be dating.”</p><p>“So who were you talking to last night, then? I could hear you until late in the night!” Ariana chimed in. “I want to meet your girlfriend too, brother. I’m sure she is pretty and very smart!”</p><p>“I didn’t do such a thing, Ari. You must have been hallucinating voices...”</p><p>“If you don’t want to talk about it; it’s okay, Albus. But I don’t want to die without seeing you becoming a father. I want to be a grandma.” Kendra added as they all continued to eat their meal.</p><p><em>Oh… If you knew, mom, you would be so disappointed. I don’t plan on having any children; sorry! </em>Albus thought. He didn’t answer anything back and simply glared daggers at Abe, who smirked at him in return<em>. I am going to kill you</em>, he mouthed silently at his younger brother, who pulled his tongue out at him. Albus then discreetly looked at his phone, just to see at least three furious messages from Grindelwald who wasn’t happy to have been hang up on.</p><p>He didn’t have the time to answer him back though, since his mother saw him look at his phone.</p><p>“Albus. Put your infernal machine down! We are eating,” she ordered.</p><p>“Sorry mom.”</p><p>He was above twenty years old and yet, his mother was still treating him as if he was a child. It wasn’t the first time he had tried to break her rules either, but he had never managed to do so. For now. He decided to change the subject as quickly as possible:</p><p>“You are sure you want to drive us to the inn, mother? I mean… We could go there by our own means, you know.”</p><p>“No! I want to see where my children are going to spend the next week! You are a grown man, Albus, but Aberforth is still too young to be left alone.”</p><p>“I don’t want to go…” Aberforth mumbled. “Who wants to pass their time with such gits.”</p><p>“Aberforth! Don’t speak like that in front of your sister!”</p><p>“I can take your place if you want,” Ariana told Abe.</p><p>“Ariana, you are too young for this and I wouldn’t want you to be exposed to such people! I mean, there are even dark wizards who are coming to this event! I don’t even understand how they are all allowed to study this topic in the first place. It’s disgusting!”</p><p>“Don’t judge what you don’t know, Abe. The Dark Arts students may be a bit special, but they wouldn’t harm you, Ari.”</p><p>Kendra furrowed her brow.</p><p>She didn’t like to hear that her children were around people who practiced such sinister magic. Fortunately, Albus was in Transfiguration.</p><p>“Be careful, Albus. It’s not good to spend time with such shady wizards. Your future depends on it.”</p><p>“And that’s you that say this?! Don’t you have a rivalry with this insufferable asshole… Grindaweld or something? He is bad news, isn’t he? I’ve heard that he has caused a lot of problems last years, or so it would appear...”</p><p>“Grindelwald.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“It’s Grindelwald. Not Grindaweld,” Albus corrected his little brother as he felt his cheeks burn under Aberforth’s inquisitive gaze.</p><p>His secret really was not the best guarded ever…</p><p align="center">∞</p><p>Albus didn’t like cars. He didn’t like brooms either, to be honest, but cars were really despicable in his mind. He didn’t know why. After all, it wasn’t as if he would die from a collision: security spells had been disposed on the vehicle; yet, he just didn’t like it. Which was why he had been surprised when his mother had announced him that she had taken driving lessons and that a few months later, she had obtained her muggle license.</p><p>Why would one want to drive when one could apparate at will?</p><p>In reality, she had done so for Ariana. A praiseworthy attention, really, but it didn’t mean that she needed to drive them – Aberforth and himself – to the inn.</p><p>The place was lost in the forest  and was run by muggles, but still; Albus had not managed to convince her not to do so.</p><p><em>She is driving way too slowly,</em> Albus thought as he looked at the boring landscape. At least, he was sitting in the front seat, despite Aberforth’s angry protests.</p><p>His mother was speaking about nothing in particular and he wasn’t really listening to her, and neither was his brother, when a motocycle overtook them at a brisk path.</p><p>The driver drove for sure way above the speed limit.</p><p>His mother groaned and beeped at it. “Some people are careless, I swear!”</p><p>In answer, the passenger of the motorcycle showed her his middle finger.</p><p>Albus saw his mother’s eyes grow wild in a flash. If there was something that Kendra wasn’t accepting in life; it was this type of behavior from others. Being polite was very important to her, which was why she had raised her children with strict rules.</p><p>“Merlin! What a rude driver! If only I had them in front of me… Do you know who they are, Albus?”</p><p>“I’m sure they are dark wizards! Who would act like that except for those jerks?” Aberforth intervened. “They are walking on the campus as if they owned the place all the time. It wouldn’t surprise me at all if they were doing the same on the road...”</p><p>Since they had helmets on,  it was difficult to see who those two truly were, but Albus had the strange impression that he knew who those savages were.</p><p>And it wasn’t at all because he had recognized the passenger’s ass instead of the vehicle.</p><p>No, of course not.</p><p>But it wasn’t Albus’s fault: he had battled against Vinda and Gellert for so long now, that he had had to look at those two more often than not.</p><p>Which was why he was able to recognize Gellert’s ass everywhere by now.</p><p>To be honest,  it was such a nice ass to stare at too…</p><p>“I don’t. Why would I? There are a lot of people who are going to the integration week. Maybe it’s not even students we just saw…”</p><p>Now, Albus really needed to pray that he would never assist to a meeting between his mother and Vinda and Gellert, because it would definitively cause a few sparks to fly.</p><p align="center">∞</p><p>Albus was sure he was in a grade B movie, when twenty minutes later, his mother finally stopped her car in front of the inn where the integration week was being held. Of course, as Minerva had suspected and had told him all along, the place looked horrible and nothing like the pictures on the advertisement Gilderoy Lockhart had sent them to promote the event two weeks ago.</p><p>The grass in front of the inn hadn’t been cut for at least the last three months, the name plastered on the front of the establishment was missing at least half of its letters and some windows were broken as birds were freely flying in and out from them.</p><p>It truly was a charming sight…</p><p>As Albus studied the outside of the inn some more and wondered if he truly wanted to sleep in there for the next few nights and risk to catch the plague or some old ass deadly disease no one even remembered these days,he saw out of the corner of his eyes that the motorcycle that had passed them earlier on the road was parked a little farther on the right of his mother’s car.</p><p>His first reflex was to secretly pray Merlin (and Morgana while he was at it), that his mother wouldn’t spot the vehicle just now and be the cause of a new wizarding war. He really wasn’t ready to pick a side and to fight right now.</p><p>Luckily, Kendra was too busy telling Abe for the tenth time that he needed to shower every day if he wanted to make new friends and that she had packed a few extra pairs of underwear and of socks for him just in case, when the passenger of the motorcycle stepped down from it.</p><p>Of course, it was exactly when Albus was ogling the said passenger that the tall lanky boy pulled his helmet off and revealed his trademark golden curls, which confirmed to him that it was none other than Gellert Grindelwald who had flipped his finger at his mom.</p><p>Even better…</p><p>For a moment, Albus felt as though time had stopped as if someone had been playing with a time-turner, when the driver, who without surprise proved to be Gellert’s shadow, Vinda Rosier, handed the tall blonde a water bottle that the latter simply poured over his head.</p><p>To what purpose, Albus couldn’t say because it wasn’t that hot today, but the temperature in the car had clearly suddenly risen…</p><p>You see, Albus’ biggest problem in the last few years hadn’t simply been that Grindelwald was a git, a real pain in everyone’s ass and his enemy.</p><p>It would have been way too simple...</p><p>No, the problem was that he found Grindelwald extremely attractive.</p><p>And not just the 'damn he looks hot' kind of attractive, but more like the 'you are going to star in my next wet dream' kind of attractive.</p><p>In short, Albus was doomed…</p><p>His mouth went instantly dry and he wondered if he wasn’t drooling, when his mother snapped her fingers in front of his face and woke him from his trance.</p><p>‟Albus, have you been listening to what I’ve just said?” Kendra asked and by the tone of her voice, the redhead could tell that she probably had told him the same thing at least five times already.</p><p>‟Eh-” he began, as his brother Abe, who was sitting in the backseat, stared at him suspiciously before he too looked outside. His expression changed as he saw Vinda and Gellert and something seemed to click in place into his brain (an ill omen if there ever had been one).</p><p>‟So that’s the bitch you’ve spent all of your time on the phone with for the last few weeks?”</p><p>Their mother frowned as she too looked outside and spotted the gorgeous duo. Of course, she recognized who they were soon enough and seemed to be wanting to talk some sense into them.</p><p>‟Albus Brian Wulfric Percival Dumbledore! Don’t tell me this girl right there is your girlfriend? I’ll go out and tell those two exactly what I think,” she threatened as she struggled to unfasten her seat belt.</p><p>Aberforth had a nasty grin on his face and was about to say something else, when the bus that had been carrying all of the first years stopped behind Kendra’s car and blocked their view, like an answer to Albus’ prayers.</p><p> Abe suddenly panicked and asked their mother to leave (yet, she still managed to get a kiss on her cheek from both of them), before she ruined his chance of ever making friends during the week. Albus all but launched himself out of the car as thunder could be heard rumbling over his head and he rushed inside the inn to meet his best friend Minerva, who eyed him suspiciously as soon as he stepped in the building.</p><p>‟What is it?”She asked as he tried to seem casual, but of course she saw right through him and her frown deepened some more.</p><p>‟What? My mum didn’t want to leave and it was awkward. I mean I’m 21…” he feebly replied as he stared around the lobby and avoided his friend’s inquiring gaze.</p><p>The decoration of the inn surely dated back from 2000 B.C. and the air smelled like a curious mix of dead flowers and mildew.</p><p>‟Don’t lie to me. Did something else happen with Grindelwald?”</p><p>Albus grew a deep shade of red, which didn’t look good at all with his hair,and cleared his throat. ‟Have you seen this painting? It’s fascinating, truly.”</p><p>‟It’s a bowl of fruits and it isn’t even well executed. In fact this place isn’t-”</p><p>But Minerva rolled her eyes as Albus managed to avoid her questions once more as he smiled at her and walked up to the inn’s front desk, behind which a smelly overweight middle-aged woman with sparse black hair and a giant wart on her face was busy listening to her favorite TV show on her computer.</p><p>‟Can we get our rooms please?” Albus asked politely as Minerva walked up to him.</p><p>‟It’s not even 4 o’clock! Where do you think you are, young man?  The Ritz-Carlton ?”The woman wiped her runny nose on her forearm. ‟Like I’ve said to the others, y’all should wait in the common room until my brother Jolan comes to fetch you.”</p><p>Albus shared a glance with Minerva as they both silently thanked the woman, who was already back to watching her show.</p><p>Why had they agreed to come to this place already?</p><p align="center">∞</p><p>‟And that’s how you play this game of Mopoly,” Gilderoy Lockhart declared before he winked at everyone who was present in the inn’s common room. Rain was pouring outside, preventing them from leaving the dreadful building, as the weird and disgusting smell that seemed to float around the place was still following them around.</p><p>Truth be told, the common room smelt like cat pee instead of dead flowers, which made it even worse and harder to breathe.</p><p>The only person who didn’t seem to be too bothered by that smell was Abe, but he certainly wasn’t a reference in the matter, since he smelled like goat’s poo most of the time.</p><p>It would have been quite simple to use a spell to make the stench go away, and Vinda had suggested they do so for a while now, but since they weren’t supposed to use magic during their stay, no one had done so yet. The fact Travers was staring at everyone and taking notes now and then on a pad,  made it easy to understand that he was going to be the rectress’, Dolores Umbridge, eyes during the next few days and no one wanted to be stuck in that bitch’s office ever again.</p><p>Her detentions were truly the worst by far.</p><p>‟It says Monopoly on the box…” Minerva commented as Gilderoy all but simply ignored her. The latter had already moved on to something else and was pulling a duck face as he snapped a new selfie of himself in front of the inn’s soot-stained hearth.</p><p>A group of random first years was staring at Lockhart dreamily, while Tom Riddle, a Dark Arts first year student, was busy doodling snakes and skulls in one of his notebooks. It was still a mystery as to why he had decided to come to this week’s activities, since it seemed that he was way more interested in designing his future tattoo than in anything else.</p><p>‟Who wants to play that muggle game?” Elphias asked as no one made a move to sit closer to the game he had placed on a wonky table.</p><p>The first years for whom these activities had been organized in the first place didn’t seem very interested by it all either. Aberforth was staring outside at the rain, while Sybill Trewlaney was frowning and sighing dramatically every minute or so.</p><p>She had declared earlier that horrible things would happen during the game and because of her vision, she didn’t want to partake in it.</p><p>This sounded like a terrible excuse for not playing, but they weren’t going to force her hand either.</p><p>Truth be told, winning those activities was crucial for each department, since the association who would get the most win at the end of the week would be the one who would pick next years’ activities.</p><p>Finally, Abernathy shrugged, sat down and picked one of the game’s token, before he placed it on the board. Minerva grabbed the rules’ booklet that was still inside the box and tried to figure out the inner mechanics of the game, as Rita Skeeter, a Muggle Studies student sat down to play too.</p><p>She had probably figured out that she would be able to pick up more gossips for the uni’s newspaper by joining the game, than by remaining with Lockhart and his fan club of giggling girls.</p><p>‟Do you mind if I do this one, V? A game where the player who collects the most money wins sounds right up my alley…” Gellert declared with a smug look on his face as he weirdly sat in front of the board too and Vinda handed him one of the tokens.</p><p>‟I’ll play for the Care for Magical Creatures department, since no one from it seems to want to play,”Albus said as he glared at his brother (who couldn’t care less about it), sat in front of his enemy and picked a token too.</p><p>‟Don’t worry lads, I’ll be gentle with you…” Gellert said as he leaned so much toward the board it seemed as though he was about to topple down from his chair, but somehow managed to remain seated. Another mystery...</p><p>“Gross! I really don’t like the image at all,” Elphias commented as he shuddered.</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes and Minerva clicked her tongue, something she did when she was annoyed, as she handed every player the money they needed to begin their game.</p><p>Horace Slughorn cracked his knuckles before he sat down too. It seemed seeing all that fake money had dragged him toward the game board too.‟May the best association win.”</p><p align="center">∞</p><p>‟That’ll be a grand total of 1 675$ for stepping on my propriety,” Elphias declared with a smug look on his face as Gellert knocked his fist on the table.</p><p>‟For stepping two seconds on your damn lawn? How am I supposed to pay when I ended up in prison every turn?”</p><p>Minerva sighed some more. The game had been going on for the last two hours and she was more than done with it. ‟That’s how the game works, Grindelwald. Either you pay or you lose.”</p><p>Abernathy, who had stopped playing about an hour ago, nodded as Albus rubbed the bridge of his nose out of annoyance.‟ Just admit it, you’ve lost and Elphias won.”</p><p>Upon hearing those words, Gellert seemed to flip a switch. If there was someone he hated more than anything in this room, it was Doge. Vinda was fairly sure there was something behind all that hate, but now was not the time to comment on it, since drama was definitively going down.</p><p>‟OWWWW!” Elphias all but yelled as a token suddenly flew from the board and hit him in the middle of the forehead with surprising force.</p><p>‟Who used wandless magic? You know what Umbridge said,” Travers declared, red in the face with anger. How could one not respect their rectress’ order seemed to be a rather difficult concept for him to grasp.</p><p>Lockhart was still taking pictures in the back of the room and was winking and smiling some more as Bertille, one of the inn’s owners, who had come to tell them that their rooms were finally ready, had joined his giggling fan club.</p><p>‟Stop being such a sore loser!” Albus said out of desperation as Gellert gaped at him.</p><p>‟Scheiße, why do you need to be such a dick all the time?”Gellert retorted before he flipped the table, dramatically stood up, walked out of the common room and slammed the door shut behind him as both Vinda and Abernathy followed in his lead.</p><p>Slughorn let out a nervous cough. He placed the in-game money he had stuffed in his pockets back into the game’s box as Elphias rubbed the angry red mark that was already appearing on his forehead.</p><p>‟See, I told you horrible things would go down,” Trewlaney added dramatically as Albus sighed out loud.</p><p>This week was already proving to be a real pain in the ass. And it was only the beginning...</p><p align="center">∞</p><p>Albus would have preferred to share his room with Elphias for obvious reasons; but no, the inn’s owners had decided to do the sleeping arrangements without consulting anyone beforehand.</p><p>The two owners had decided that the boys were going to share their rooms with other boys, while the girls would be paired up together; stating that that way, they would prevent couples from doing unholy things with each other.</p><p>Gellert had commented that doing unholy things with boys was his specialty, but the owners hadn’t seem to understand just what exactly he had been on about.</p><p>Which was why Elphias was rooming with Abernathy – who at least would be calm since he wasn’t speaking a lot –  and Albus had to cohabitate with another student for the next few days.</p><p>“Don’t worry… I’m sure they will put you with a good guy. And who knows, maybe he could tempt you; if you know what I mean…”</p><p>“Elphias… Don’t be stupid,” Albus chuckled.</p><p>But when he opened his bedroom’s door he stopped chuckling and had only one instinctive reaction:</p><p>“You!”</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Grindelwald retorted back, seeming as shocked as him.</p><p>The blonde was lounging on the middle of the bed that was placed against the back wall of the room with his smartphone in his hands. All Seer he claimed to be; it was clear that he had not Seen Albus’ arrival.</p><p>The surprise on his face was a sure proof of it. He had probably guessed he would be alone in the room and had certainly already texted Vinda, who was rooming with McGonagall, to come over.</p><p>“Grindelwald…”</p><p>“What exactly are you doing here?”</p><p>“The owners placed me in this bedroom…”</p><p>Grindelwald sighed dramatically before he threw his phone on the bed carelessly and placed his hands behind his head.</p><p>Albus understood immediately what was going on: it was karma for all the dirty thoughts he had entertained about Grindelwald for the last few weeks.</p><p>Of course, he had to be paired with a dark wizard. D<em>amn muggles!</em><em><br/></em></p><p>“Baba Yaga; that’s all I needed! I swear if I have to support Doge’s presence around here I’m going to riot. There’s no fucking way this yokel is staying here.”</p><p>Elphias was about to answer something, but Albus was quicker: "If Elphias can’t come in here, then Rosier won’t put a foot in here either! I swear it on my brother's pet goat Blanchette’s head!”</p><p>“Because you think V would like to be in the same room as you? Don’t think too highly of yourself, ginger!”</p><p>The two looked daggers at each other.</p><p>Meanwhile, Elphias found the situation quite uncomfortable, especially when Grindelwald seemed to be on the edge of badly cursing him, since he had pulled his wand out of his boot. He had never understood why the dark wizard hated him so much. Since the first time they had met, the blonde had taken a dislike to him and it had only grown with time.</p><p>“Hum… I think I’m going to leave you two alone. If you have a problem, Al, text me, okay?”</p><p>“Yes, leave us alone… You wouldn’t want to be a dead weight to your bro if we duel, right?”</p><p>“Don’t speak to him like that!” Albus protested, while Elphias simply fled out of the room.</p><p>“I’ll do whatever the fuck I want.”</p><p>“I don’t want to share my room with you either, <em>Goldilocks</em>! I’m going downstairs this instant to ask for another room!”</p><p>“What? You mean that you are so afraid of me that you don’t want to be in the same room as I? Believe me, I’m not happy about it either. I mean, someone who says such stupid things on Twitter can’t be that interesting in real life…”</p><p>“Oh, so that’s only now that you feel the need to tell me this; when you called me and button held me for at least four hours every call?”</p><p>“What? It’s you who called me the last time because you thought that my tweet was “utter crap”!”</p><p>Albus was tempted to retort back, but knew perfectly well that Grindelwald revealed in their conflict.</p><p>The guy was always searching for a reason to confront him anyway. However, today, Albus wasn’t going to give the latter what he wanted.</p><p>Especially not after he had flipped his middle finger at his mother…</p><p>“Okay, stop. Never mind. We still have a problem. There is only one bed in this room.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And I don’t want to sleep with you.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, Dumbledore. I’m not going to jump on you!  You are not my type anyway.” Grindelwald sneered. “And we are both responsible adults too. We can sleep in the same bed without any problems, don’t you think?”</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes and put his bag next to the bedside table. This inn was really shabby and the decorations didn’t help, with the scene of witches’ trials painted here and there on the walls. Grindelwald did seem to mind them though, since he had enchanted them to change the scenery. Indeed, at the end of each animation, the witch was burning the inquisitor alive.</p><p>For a second, Albus thought about saying something about it – it was a muggle establishment, after all – but in the end didn’t.</p><p>“As if I wanted to be your type, Grindelwald. Don’t take your dreams for reality.”</p><p>“Everyone wants to be my type, it’s just that they don’t want to acknowledge it. You are just way too proud for that.”</p><p>“You sound just as full of yourself as Lockhart, you know?”</p><p>Albus knew where to hit. After all, he had discovered that Lockhart had tried to sleep with the dark wizard during their first year, and since then, Grindelwald had developed an aversion for the latter.</p><p>Not that Albus was really interested in what Gellert was doing or who he was sleeping with,<em> of course</em>. He had just learned that fact by chance, because he had looked at Vinda’s Instagram feed on a few occasions.</p><p>If he had found pictures of Gellert wearing booty shorts at last year’s pride and had saved them on his phone, it was solely for blackmailing purpose too.</p><p>“Oh please no… Not that prick!” There was an awkward silence before he went on. “That was a low blow, <em>Dumby</em>.”</p><p>“You deserved it, <em>Grindy</em>.”</p><p>It was Grindelwald’s turn to roll his eyes. Of course, the latter wouldn’t believe he deserved so much hate.</p><p>He was way too incredible for this, for sure – or at least he thought so.</p><p>If Albus had difficulties to accept the idea of Lockhart and Grindelwald together; it was for Lockhart’s sake of course, since the latter would probably end up being sacrificed on an altar by his 'boyfriend' during a full moon.</p><p>“Anyway, from now on and for a week, we are roommates,” Grindelwald declared with a little smirk.</p><p>Albus could already predict the numerous problems this particular situation would cause.</p><p>Especially when there was only one bed.</p>
