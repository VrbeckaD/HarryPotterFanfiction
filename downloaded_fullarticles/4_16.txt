  <strong><span>Drabble 10</span> : Goodbye</strong>
</p><p>Pairing: (Harry) Pre-Slash</p><p>Fandom: Harry Potter Xover Hellboy, in part II</p>
<hr/><p>The battlefield wasn't soaked with blood, it wasn't some great end of a war that had been expected, in fact when Harry faced Voldemort it was the Dark Lord who sought out the Savior while he was on the run. Harry had decided that he didn't want to fight; he couldn't handle the constant pressure on his shoulders while the rest of the world sat on their cushioned arses. So he ran, they called him a coward but Harry felt a relief as he wandered the continents and ended up somewhere in the mountains where he was accepted in a monastery that embraced him and taught him how to handle his magic and brought him a peace he had never felt before.</p><p>Two years after he had abandoned the wizarding world Voldemort found him in the temple meditating. At the time Harry wondered if the others knew, they had all gone on a <em>hunt</em> and each had given him goodbyes and suggested he should keep his belongings on him at all times. The last to bid him goodbye was Awen, the eldest, the seer of the group of men who took Harry in. When the man bade him goodbye with a kiss to the brow Harry shouldn't have squashed his anxiety, he should have questioned why they all had to go… but Harry ignored it.</p><p>When Voldemort arrived it had been with the twin ornate doors blowing inwards and Harry throwing up a shield to keep the piercing splintered wood from killing him. It had been an intense showdown of nerves. Harry had stood and watched as the Dark Lord took in the scenery and the Death Eater's flanking him. This was where he was going to die he was sure… he couldn't bring himself to touch his wand, not in the temple where he made a promise to never practice magic with said piece of wood.</p><p>Incensed watched from behind his flickering dome of magic as the Death Eaters one by one blasted a statue, lit up scrolls that lined the walls, desecrating a place of worship. Harry may have skill with a wand but he was mediocre at best with handling his magic wandless but he had enough confidence to <em>push</em> a basin of burning oil that sat innocently atop a short column that had been hand carved from a fallen tree many years ago. Fatigue touched him but he was immensely proud of himself as the spilled oil splashed atop several robed Death Eaters who bumped into others, the fire swallowing all who got in its way.</p><p>The screams would haunt him and Harry's glee quickly turned to horror as the smell of burnt flesh and the taste of death and fear settled on his tongue. This wasn't him… he pledged himself peaceful; he pledged to respect life and to uphold it at all cost. "Potter!" Voldemort roared as the standing Death Eaters that hadn't been touched tried desperately to soak the flames with their wands. Harry looked into angry red eyes and felt utterly miserable… what had he done?</p><p>Turning on his heels he ran, bare feet smacking along smoothed stone and then grass as the fresh air of the night washed over him. A spell whizzed by him and Harry made his way down a slope as he removed his wand from its harness. He wasn't ready for this, he didn't want to kill… this immense guilt he felt from what he had done was weighing heavy so Harry went to the one place that had been a sort of haven for him. Ducking another spell he ran along the wooden plank bridge that went over sand that had symbols drawn atop the surface with smooth rocks etched with protection.</p><p>Just a little further… reaching the edge of a pond Harry stared down not at the calm waters but ripples as a whirl pool existed in the very center. There weren't any fish but the gathered moss at the edge of the rocks that encircled the pond was well prized. Harry stared at the dark center, it was a shade of its own and no one knew where it went. The pond was revered by the men, it was the place where the dead were swallowed whole and if legend was correct, the living were sent to where they would do the most good.</p><p>While Harry had an open mind he believed that the whirlpool was striking and deadly. It was deceptive and if the living were to fall they would surely drown… "Any last words Potter?" Voldemort's hissed words were mocking.</p><p>So he would die, a small smile quirked his lips. Two years of learning and being one with himself, two years of relative peace would end on a night that mocked him with its beauty. No clouds just stars and a cool wind… "I could ask why but we both know the answer don't we." Turning Harry took a step back until his heels were at the edge. The churning water mingled with the shouts in the distance, he would die and be sure to remain dead and at the very least he wouldn't be in the hands of the Dark Lord. The water would swallow him whole. "All I wanted was to be left alone but you couldn't do that?"</p><p>"This ends here Potter. The prophecy must be followed through."</p><p>"I never believed it you know, it was too random, it could be meant for anyone." Harry glanced down at his wand hand, the jewelry of bands of polished bronze and silver on his fingers and wrists, each etched by him, were a comfort. They reminded him that in death he wouldn't be alone, he would join those who loved him, and even in death he would have close the last two years with him. Striking, Harry's wand silently let out a spell of puce that struck an electric green of death, the two spells tangled, and before both wizards eyes the spells joined to make one distinct reaction that split and struck one another in twin bolts.</p><p>Struck in the chest and tossed back off his feet Harry had enough time to see his own spell hit the Dark Lord in the face before he was consumed in icy water. He was able to get in one good swallow of air before he was dragged under by the whirlpool that never paused in its spinning. Back on land Voldemort let out a horrible scream of pain before his body went still, the spell eating away at his skin, muscle, his very magic until all that was left was the stained fabric of his robes and a ring that bore the signet of the Death Eaters.</p><p>o/o/o/o</p><p>This was supposed to be Harry/Abe Sapien or Prince Nuada.</p><p>That's not happening but I'm keeping it pre-slash for selfish reasons :)</p>
