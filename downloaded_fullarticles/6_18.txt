    <p>“Life Inprisonment – Azkaban.”</p><p> </p><p>They drag Hanamaki Takahiro away in chains, his piercing gaze reinforced with cold fury. He had been the ruthless chaser on the Slytherin Quidditch team, a senior who had graduated two years before, and then the manipulative death eater who’d killed houses of innocent muggles in their sleep and tortured half-blooded children to insanity.</p><p> </p><p>Even now, behind the many wards separating the prisoners from the wizengamot playing judge and jury, Sawamura Daichi feels a shiver travel down his spine when those cold, calculating eyes lock onto his own.</p><p> </p><p>While many of the more fanatic death-eaters had been killed in battle, the rest are being put on trial. The guilty ones are sent to Azkaban; the not-so guilty put on probation. Every sentence to life inprisonment reminds Daichi of the many old, noble pureblood families they leave ruined in their wake.</p><p> </p><p>It’s horrible.</p><p> </p><p>He’d never dared to think so far into the future, of what would happen once the Boy-Who-Lived kills Voldemort, finally puts an end to the war. Maybe, in the far reaches of his mind, he’d envisioned a world full of peace and prosperity. But his imagination is not a place for reality – and the reality of the situation is a community struggling to recover from two consecutive wars filled with blood and violence.</p><p> </p><p>Daichi doesn’t know if tearing the Wizarding Culture to shreds after something so traumatic is worth putting these mass-murderers to jail.</p><p> </p><p>Michimiya is in therapy – they don’t know if she’ll ever be the same, or if they’ll ever be able to erase the “mudblood” carved into her flesh. Ikejiri takes care of her at night, when the nightmares joustle them both awake, and sometimes she takes care of him too. No one says anything about the dark rings under his eyes when he shows up for auror training.</p><p> </p><p>A flash of grey pulls Daichi from his thoughts – and he watches with renewed interest as the guards escort in a new prisoner. This prisoner isn’t struggling, or shouting, or screaming. His feet are light on the ground, his wrists chained together, and his head is bowed in defeat. The tell-tale mop of silky, grey hair falls to cover his eyes – the unique shade only ever present in one noble, pure-blood family.</p><p> </p><p>“Sugawara Koushi.”</p><p> </p><p>Daichi remembers first-year, the grey-haired boy greeting him in front of the great hall. If possible, he’d been as reluctant as Daichi had been to introduce himself. But back then, it had been the truth that Daichi had no idea of the Sugawaras’ influence and wealth, or their status as proud purebloods.</p><p> </p><p>The two boys flanking Sugawara hadn’t been as kind – the pretty boy with the windswept hair had looked down at Daichi like he was scum, dragging Sugawara away by the collar, and the taller boy with the incredible bed-head had smiled at Daichi so nastily Ikejiri had to step in before a fight broke out.</p><p> </p><p>“I will now recite your war crimes.”</p><p> </p><p>Sugawara gives the briefest of nods, his chained hands resting between his legs and the softness of his features hardening for a split second.</p><p> </p><p>“In your sixth year of schooling, you allowed death eaters to infiltrate Hogwarts and proceeded to spectate as they murdered your headmaster at that point in time – Ukai Ikkei. You placed more than three wizards under the <em>Imperius</em> Curse – one of the three unforgivables – with the longest being a duration of one year. Furthermore, you attempted to murder one of your professors using tabooed dark magic and almost succeeded ending the lives of two of your schoolmates using cursed objects. It is also known that Tom Riddle and other known Azkaban escapees, such as Matsukawa Takahatsu, took up residence at Sugawara Manor for a period of more than two years. The prementioned Manor served as the headquarters of the death eater movement. As a resident of the Sugawara Manor, and its current owner, it is assumed that you were aware of the torture and capture of war heroes Michimiya Yui, Ikejiri Hayato and Sawamura Daichi, amongst other half-blooded or muggle-born witches and wizards.”</p><p> </p><p>Daichi grips his armrest so hard his knuckles turn white.</p><p> </p><p>He can still hear Michimiya’s screams – sharp and broken and shattered till this day; can still mistake the darkness behind his own eyelids as the dungeons below that infernal manor. He can still, clearly, feel the terrifying, utterly <em>paralyzing</em> fear that – this is all over, eveything we’ve worked for is over, that Sugawara Koushi, in identifying them, has ended their lives in a singlehanded blow.</p><p> </p><p>“Please display your dark mark.”</p><p> </p><p>The unmistakable skull and snake, tattooed into the milky pale skin of Sugawara’s forearm, makes the fine hair on Daichi’s arms stand. A hushed murmur runs through the crowd. Sugawara’s fingers curl into fists.</p><p> </p><p>No one stands to defend him.</p><p> </p><p>No one wants to – the evidence splayed out on his right forearm is incriminating on its own, not to mention the rest of it. <em>Imperius</em> for a year? Daichi is torn between acknowledging Sugawara’s power and feeling horrified for the person who lost a whole chunk of their life.</p><p> </p><p>Daichi can understand the hatred the wizarding community has for Sugawara Koushi perfectly. He wants so badly to let the jury pass the sentence for a life of inprisonment in Azkaban for this boy – the boy who’d destroyed the only safe haven he’s had since his parents had been murdered as an infant, the boy who’d helped the death eaters send that last <em>Avada</em> at the man who’d looked after him for years, the boy who had locked him in the dungeon under his house and allowed his deranged aunt to torture one of his best friends. Maybe, to some extent, even the boy who’d once been fourteen and done nothing but watch as his closest friends bullied “mudblood” children, calling them names and leaving them crying along the corridors.</p><p> </p><p>But Daichi also understands Sugawara Koushi too well to just let him rot in a cell.</p><p> </p><p>He’d felt it while hidden under the astronomy tower; watching the pureblooded boy, normally quietly confident, tremble with an <em>Avada</em> never quite able to leave his lips. He’d felt it when the silver-haired boy bent down onto his knee to look him in the eye – his face swollen beyond (hopeful) recognition. And he’d felt it again, right as the solid foundations of Hogwarts came crashing down, when his eyes met grey in the midst of the fighting and a stream of green knocks a death eater to the ground before he can cast a spell at Daichi.</p><p> </p><p>Somehow, for the second time in the span of an impossible situation, hardened brown meets soulful grey in the Ministry of Magic’s largest courtroom, and Daichi finds himself rising from his chair. Sugawara Koushi startles in his seat – and so does everyone else in the courtroom.</p><p> </p><p>“If you do not mind, minister, I would like to stand in defence of Sugawara Koushi.”</p><p> </p><p>Another murmur runs through the crowd, the attention now directed at Sawamura Daichi. The-Boy-Who-Lived, and the boy who ended it all.</p><p> </p><p>“..I-I don’t see any problems with that, Sawamura-kun, although… there’s no reason why you should? He tortured your best friend, and kept you captive only to send you to your death.”</p><p> </p><p>Daichi swallows, his adams’ apple bobbing as he purses his lips. Blinking, he redirects his gaze to the boy sitting chained in the centre of the courtroom. Sugawara is staring at him with wide eyes, wide eyes transparent with confusion.</p><p> </p><p>Sugawara might never have been sorted into Gryffindor, but Daichi can hazard that he’d probably been one of the bravest during the war.</p><p> </p><p>Having to barter for the safety of your family in the place of your father, to a madman of an unwanted house guest who enjoyed torture for tea? Sugawara would have been stupid not to have taken the mark, and selfish not to have attempted the impossible mission of killing his headmaster. Sugawara Koushi had no choice but to do the things he’d done to protect his family, and Daichi doesn’t think it should be considered a crime to want to survive.</p><p> </p><p>“With all due respect, minister,” When Daichi finally answers, ripping his gaze away from the grey-haired pureblood and back to the weathered man on his podium, he is surprised at how confident he sounds. “It’s because I don’t think you should convict an innocent man.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
