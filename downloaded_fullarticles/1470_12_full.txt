    <p>I.</p>
<p>
  <span>The first thing Draco is aware of is the pain behind his eyes. It pulses, a low, harsh hum that seems to drive into the back of his skull. Swaths of light try their best to burn through his lids, so he screws his eyes shut even tighter. His throat feels tight and dry, his mouth cottony. When he tries to move his limbs, he finds them to be heavy and aching. He can hear the scratch of cloth against the bed, can feel the rub of fabric on his skin.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It takes him several long, quiet moments of laying with himself to dredge up the memories of where he had been, where he might be now, what had happened, why his body ached-- it all came flooding back with a density that did nothing for his splitting headache. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The Battle. Bodies. Blood. Spells. His classmates, strewn over rubble like ragdolls. He did that. He allowed it. It was him. His own fear crawling up his throat like bile.</span>
  </em>
  <span> His body begins shaking without his permission and he can feel that same bile, real this time. He wrenches his body upward so that he can throw himself over the edge of the bed-- eyes cracking open, St. Mungo’s familiar teal wall-tiling filling his vision --and wretch up whatever is left in his stomach. It’s nothing much at all, as it turns out, and it splashes thick and disgusting on the floor. It burns his nose.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh!” A soft voice. He feels hands on his shoulders, drawing him to lay back on the bed. “Mr. Malfoy, try to relax. Here, drink this.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Small, brown hands hold a potion vile to his lips. He swallows, throat feeling like cut glass. The potion tastes just as vile and he does his best to keep it down. It settles his stomach, though, and for a moment he finds himself capable of breathing evenly. The Healer standing over his bed frowns, her brows pulling together in concern. She lays the back of her hand against his forehead. Her skin is cool to the touch, which means he must be burning up. He tries to speak but his throat aches. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Shh, just relax for a moment,” the Healer says. Her voice is soft. Draco’s eyes drop to the name stitched into her robes: </span>
  <em>
    <span>Yasmin</span>
  </em>
  <span>. “The potion ought to settle your stomach. We’ll give you something for the pain in a minute.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The pain. Settle his stomach. Draco’s stomach twists with snakes and guilt and roiling failure and humiliation. Why is he even </span>
  <em>
    <span>here</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Shouldn’t he have been left to die like all the other… the other… Another wave of nausea forces Draco’s thoughts to an unpleasant halt. He breathes unevenly, fingers curling into the itchy fabric of the hospital bed cloth. He can hear  the Healer tsk, can hear the scratch of a quill against paper. His eyes are squeezed shut again, his knuckles feeling bruised with how tight his grip has turned. Don’t they know who he is? What he’s done? What he deserves?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your family should be here any minute,” the Healer, Yasmin, says. When Draco pries open his eyes again, she’s returned to his beside with another potion vial. “For the pain. Easy does it, there you go.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The potion works. It goes down thick and unpleasant, but he can feel the pain in his limbs, in his head, in his throat, slowly start to recede. He still feels tender, but perhaps less as if he were about to fall entirely apart. He can keep his eyes open, at least. There’s a window just behind his bed where the bright light is coming from. It’s a private room, small and cozy and just a little bit crowded with left-behind chairs and extra hospital blankets and pillows piled on them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re a lucky man, Mr. Malfoy,” Yasmin says as she bustles around the small room, moving the chairs, pulling the blinds, pulling her wand and running a diagnostic spell or two to check his vitals. The magic prickles his skin, making him aware of the sweat clinging to his collarbone, the back of his neck. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“My parents,” Draco croaks. His voice is rusty from disuse. He can’t begin to fathom how long he’s been here. “They’re coming?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your mum was here,” Yasmin agrees. “And all the rest.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The rest?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Draco can’t get the words out so he doesn’t bother. He eases himself up a little on his pillows so he isn’t so supine. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you remember anything that happened before you were brought here?” Yasmin asks. She’s got her quill and her parchment attached to a clipboard. Fear makes the edges of his limbs go cold. Draco remembers clearly the ash-faces of those around him, the energy of the last stand, the vibrancy of what he knew, what they all knew, to be the </span>
  <em>
    <span>final battle</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Swallowing around the thick feeling in his throat, Draco shakes his head. Lies. It would do him no good-- it was over, whatever had happened. It was over and it didn’t matter what side had come out on top. He doesn’t even </span>
  <em>
    <span>know</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he realizes. He would be dead regardless. Thrown into Azkaban or killed, outright, wand to his throat for his acts of resistance. </span>
</p>
<p>They ought to have just let him die among the rubble where he belonged. </p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s alright,” Yasmin says. Her smile is so soft and easy. He doesn’t understand how she can look at him like this. “You were--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But whatever it was Yasmin was about to tell him about himself is cut off by the rattle of the door, the inward swing of it on its hinges and </span>
  <em>
    <span>bodies</span>
  </em>
  <span> spilling into the room. The first person he sees is Mother, her face stricken, white, her hair falling loose from a complicated plait at the back of her head. She throws herself over him and Draco’s body moves without his approval, arms coming up to cling to her. He presses his face to her neck while she clings to him. Her face is wet against his cheek. She strokes his face, his hair-- which he feels, now, hangs long and sweaty around his shoulders.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco is still trying to understand his hair when Mother pulls back and he sees the rest of the people who have crowded around his bed. It takes him embarrassingly long to place their faces because they’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>different</span>
  </em>
  <span>. They’re so different. He wouldn’t have recognized Harry Potter if it hadn’t been for the grotesque scar zig-zagging its way down half his face. He is otherwise entirely changed-- hair longer, pulled back off his face in a knot at the back of his head, cheeks and jaw obscured by black facial hair. Potter comes around to his other side on the bed, opposite mother.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione Granger floats, buoyant as she is with a rotund stomach beneath her knitted sweater. Two Weasleys, Ronald and the sister, crowd in at the end of his bed. He would not recognize Ronald, either, if not for the hair. Ginerva Weasley looks paler than usual, her face gone white as a sheet beneath her freckles. The last to crowd around his bed is the only other person he would have expected, maybe-- Blaise Zabini, broader in the shoulders than Draco could ever remember seeing him. They all look so </span>
  <em>
    <span>old</span>
  </em>
  <span>. When Draco focuses on Mother, she too looks aged by years, her soft hands knobby at the joints. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, okay, give him a little space,” Yasmin says. “He’s having some trouble with his memory.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Idiot,” Ginevra says with affection. It startles Draco out of his silence.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What--” Draco tries, croaks, swallows, tries again. “What are you--  why are you…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Potion experiment went bad, love,” Potter-- </span>
  <em>
    <span>Potter</span>
  </em>
  <span> says, reaching a hand to touch Draco’s cheek with the backs of his knuckles. Draco nearly pulls a muscle ripping himself away from the range of his touch. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Love?</span>
  </em>
  <span> The confusion swings him into another rush of dizziness and nausea. Mother’s hands steady him. Each face his eyes flicker to, in turn, have the same dawning confusion knitting their brows, pulling their lips down. Granger and the Weasley brother exchange furtive glances. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter’s hand hovers in the air. Draco watches his gaze warily meet Mother’s over his head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco?” Mother murmurs. She finds his hand, squeezes it. Draco tightens his grip. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why are they here?” Draco finally croaks out. “What-- why…?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You said he was having memory trouble?” Potter asks, looking over his shoulder to Healer Yasmin. But even she’s beginning to look alarmed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He didn’t remember what happened before he got here,” Yasmin explains. Her voice sounds uncertain. Draco turns his face away, presses it against Mother’s arm. She squeezes around him, pressing one cool hand to his temple. There’s too many bodies in the room, too many faces, too many sounds of accelerated, shocked breathing. Draco would rather sink back into unconsciousness than have to sit through whatever this is, whatever is happening. It’s hard to focus, hard to decide where he’s been misplaced. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What </span>
  <em>
    <span>does</span>
  </em>
  <span> he remember?” Blaise asks, the frown audibly blanketing his voice. “Draco? What do you remember?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco lifts his face from Mother’s arm. Struggles to focus. It feels like his heart might beat entirely out of his chest. “You know,” he says, feeling vicious. The words are rough from his throat, but biting. “You </span>
  <em>
    <span>know</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>How could they not? How could they not </span>
  <em>
    <span>know</span>
  </em>
  <span>? It couldn’t have been that long. Days, maybe. A week at most. He couldn’t have been asleep that long. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We don’t,” Granger says, her voice soft and kind in a way that seems foreign to him. Her small hand reaches over the end of the bed and touches his ankle through the blankets. Draco rips it away, curling his knees up to his chest. The hurt look that dashes across her face feels victorious. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco!” Mother sounds appalled. He pulls himself away from her, too. It’s the last thing he wants, but he doesn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking understand</span>
  </em>
  <span>. And maybe that’s the worst part of all of this. Being so certain and yet, not knowing. Feeling like there’s something that would make all of this fall into place and not being able to reach it. Everyone looking at him with a mix of confusion and pity. Mother looking horrified. Potter looking-- Draco doesn’t focus on Potter’s face. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Can’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> focus on Potter’s face. No potion in the world would settle his stomach if he were to keep looking at him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay,” Yasmin demands, stepping in. “Okay. Let’s… let’s give him a moment. Can we have the room?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Potter says, voice tight, hard. “What? No. I’m not-- no, if there’s something wrong with him, I get to stay. I get to know.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry.” Hermione’s voice. Draco pushes his hands up over his face, fingertips getting tangled in his hair. It falls around his shoulders, now. It’s so </span>
  <em>
    <span>long</span>
  </em>
  <span>, why is it </span>
  <em>
    <span>long</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Draco pulls his hands away from his face, trailing his fingers through his hair, pulling it forward to see it fall in lifeless hanks around his shoulders. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just for a minute,” Yasmin urges, low and quiet. Draco pushes the heels of his palms against his eyes. Draws his knees up closer. His chest feels tighter and tighter. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, come on,” Blaise murmurs. “Come on. Gin. Harry. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The shuffle of feet. Mother’s weight leaving the bed, the sound of her stifled sob. Ginevra calls her </span>
  <em>
    <span>Cissy</span>
  </em>
  <span> and tells her </span>
  <em>
    <span>It’s going to be okay, Cissy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When the door closes, the room feels so empty, so quiet, that the silence seems oppressive now. Yasmin’s voice nearly echoes as she eases to sit on the edge of the bed next to him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey,” she murmurs. Her hand is soft on his arm, guiding his hands away from his eyes. Draco looks at her, scans over the almond shape of her eyes, the upturn of her nose. When she smiles, it crinkles the corners of her eyes. “It’s alright. Can you tell me what year it is, Mr. Malfoy?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Five minutes ago he would have been very sure of his answer. “Nineteen-ninety-eight,” Draco says, cautious. The upward turn of his voice at the end makes it sound like a question. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s okay,” Yasmin assures quickly, despite the way she reaches for her quill and clipboard. “You had a bit of an accident. It’s natural that you’re a little confused. It’s the thirteenth of May, two-thousand and five.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>2005</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The number seems astronomical. It seems </span>
  <em>
    <span>impossible</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Not only that it should be 2005, but that he should be </span>
  <em>
    <span>alive</span>
  </em>
  <span> to see 2005. Draco’s eyes track back and forth, unseeing, as he struggles to do a bit of simple math. “That would make me twenty-five,” Draco says, voice tight. “I… I’m not… I’m seventeen. Barely. Barely seventeen.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That would make you twenty-five, yes,” Yasmin says, ignoring his other assertion. “You were brought in by your husband--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“By my </span>
  <em>
    <span>who</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Draco balks. “By my… my? I don’t-- I’m not… I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>seventeen</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You were brought in by your husband, Mr. Potter, after he found you in your potions lab, unresponsive. It seems like something went wrong. According to your husband--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco feels like he might pass out. He scrabbles his hands, grasping at Yasmin’s arm, her shoulders. “Please stop,” he begs. “Stop saying that. I’m going to be sick.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you need another potion?” Yasmin asks. She covers his hands with her own. “Try to breathe through it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco allows her to coach him through several deep breaths, in through his nose and out through his mouth. His stomach doesn’t feel any less unsettled, but he isn’t sure that it’s something a potion will be able to help him with. His mind struggles to even comprehend what Healer Yasmin has said to him. His-- Potter-- his… It feels like his brain physically recoils from the words. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay?” Yasmin asks. Wanting to shake his head, Draco nods instead. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mr. Potter found you unresponsive in your potions lab. He said it looked like something had gone wrong. A bad reaction, maybe.” Yasmin notedly does not call Potter his... </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>. “You were unstable for a few days. You might have some trouble with migraines in the next few weeks. We’ve got potions for that. They’ll come and go but it should wear off. The… erm, the memory problems, though…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco swallows. He refuses to believe that his memory is wrong. It can’t be. It must be, somewhat. But it can’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>possibly be</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’ll keep you here another night,” Yasmin says, squeezing Draco’s hand between her own. “Monitor you. See if any of your memories start coming back. I can have one of the staff Legilimens come in and see if they can’t poke around in there.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>More nausea. “No,” Draco says, his voice firm. “No. Absolutely not.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He meets Yasmin’s eyes. His mind feels clear, clearer than it has been since waking up. She nods, just a minute movement of her chin. “Alright,” she agrees. “But we’ll still keep you another night, just to be safe. Your memories might come back in… five hours, five minutes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Five days,” Draco supplies, dully. “Five years.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not likely,” Yasmin assures, a smile warming up her whole face. He likes her. He doesn’t know much, but he knows that. “Shall I let your family back in?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They’re not my family,” Draco insists. “Just… just my mum. She can come in.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Yasmin’s eyes seem sad when she smiles next, squeezing his hand. “Sure thing, love.”</span><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>II.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Exhaustion takes Draco out again only an hour into visiting with Mother. He doesn’t want to hear about the other people hovering outside the room, so they try to talk around it. It’s difficult. Draco learns that Mother has been in Nice, France, since the end of the war, since after the trials. She was acquitted of all charges for her instrumental role in the war. Draco doesn’t want to think about his own trial, what might have been said, what sentence might have come down on him. He asks her not to tell him, and Mother agrees-- though, reluctantly. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There seems to be so much she wants to say but doesn’t. Draco can’t get over the differences in her face. The new lines. The soft wisps of grey in her hair, darker than the natural blond. He wants to know where his Mother went, who this woman trying to replace her is, but every time she looks at him it’s like she might start sobbing all over again, so he says nothing. Eventually, exhaustion claims him and he lets it happen. Sleep comes as a relief, calming the churning his stomach and the near-constant anxiety about who else is waiting in the hallway, desperate to get back into his room. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco feels muddled as he comes in and out of sleep. Mother is there a few times. Others, it’s Yasmin, checking his vitals with a quick spell, offering him water. He sleeps through most of the day and awakens during evening. Yasmin is gone, another Healer having taken her place. This one brings him supper, asks if he’s in any pain, then leaves him to his own devices. He’s  grateful. He has nothing new to say. There are no new memories. He picks at his food, uncomfortable in the stomach.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The nausea wins out. Draco sets the tray on the bedside table and sinks down in his bed, staring at the ceiling. He can’t stop thinking about-- about what Yasmin said, about… Potter. It makes everything inside of him revolt. He tries to think of life paths that might lead him to </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span>. But no matter what he comes up with, he can’t imagine himself in the situation he’s in now. It doesn’t make sense. There’s no logical progression between the war and here. Not even with eight years in-between.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Eight years</span>
  </em>
  <span>. That thought almost sends his stomach into another tailspin. Draco scrubs his hands over his face. He sits up, slowly, feeling the aches in his body. The door to the small hospital ensuite, really just a toilet and a sink and nothing else, hangs open. Touching his hair, Draco eases himself to his feet. His legs feel weak and standing makes him dizzy, but he shuffles his way to the bathroom. A low candlelight burns along the wall when he enters, casting a gentle glow for him to peer into the mirror with. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He looks </span>
  <em>
    <span>sick</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Draco frowns, watching himself frown right back in his reflection. His skin is sallow, his white-blond hair lank and long. There are dark circles under his eyes, making him look like he lost a bar fight. And he’s different. Older. Less pointy, maybe. His face having aged into all of those things that had been his insecurities in his youth. Draco turns his chin this way and that, observing himself. Standing in front of the mirror is making him exhausted and dizzy again, though. He tears himself away from the mirror and stumbles back through into the hospital room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Undue anxiety drives Draco to pull open the door into the hallway. He’s half-expecting to see Potter and his cohorts sitting outside, waiting for him to let them back in. But there’s no one. He can hear a Healer down the hall talking low to another patient. Draco eases the door closed and drags himself back to bed, flopping onto the mattress, exhausted. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Twenty-five. He doesn’t feel twenty-five. He feels seventeen and stupid and terrified. He curls onto his side, facing the door with ever-increasing anxiety. He wishes Mother were here, still. He wishes she could stay the night. He doesn’t know where his wand is. He can’t even cast a </span>
  <em>
    <span>tempus</span>
  </em>
  <span> charm to see how many more hours he has to wait until Yasmin returns for the morning shift. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The night drags on. Draco sleeps very little. He gets up a few times and shuffles around his room. Checks the hall. A passing Healer corrals him back to the bed the fifth time he peers into the corridor, tells him not to worry about it, he needs rest, try to get some more sleep. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One of the migraines Yasmin mentioned comes just after sunrise. It makes him nearly kick his feet with how bad it aches, burning through his skull, roiling his stomach with nausea. He drags the blankets over his head and bites his fist to stop himself from sobbing. Eventually, a Healer comes around for morning rounds. It isn’t Yasmin. He’s given a potion to manage the pain. The pain ebbs away, slowly, until it’s just another dull ache behind his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How are we feeling this morning?” Yasmin asks first thing when she finally does come around, just past eight in the morning (Draco asks). “Any memories?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sitting up, Draco shakes his head. “No,” he says, voice tight. “Nothing new. I got a potion for a migraine.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Yasmin frowns. She waves her wand to run a diagnostic spell. Clicks her tongue. “You’ll just have to give it some more time,” she says, sounding apologetic. “But being around familiar things, familiar people… it’ll help.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Familiar. The word means nothing to him now. The last familiar thing he remembers is the castle he spent his childhood in crumbling around him. He doesn’t tell her that. Draco twists his hands together in his lap, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to drown out the last hum of pain from the migraine. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mr. Potter will be by in a few hours,” Yasmin says, her voice careful. Cautious. “He owled. He’d like to take you home and we have no other reason to keep you. The accident didn’t cause any lasting damage. The migraines should subside in a few weeks with the potions…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” Draco says, throaty. “No. I want… Can I go home with my mum? Can you… can I owl her? Floo her?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You can go home with anyone you want,” Yasmin assures. “If you’d rather be released to Mrs. Malfoy…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes,” Draco says firmly. If he had to leave here with anyone, it would be Mother. There’s nothing, nothing on this green earth, that might convince him to go home with Potter. Yasmin was, very pointedly, not calling Potter anything other than </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mr. Potter</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Yasmin nods. “We can arrange that. Whatever you need, Draco.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It’s arranged. In three hours time, Mother is waiting outside the door. He doesn’t know where Potter is, but he isn’t here. She’s brought him a change of clothes. Draco still feels a little exhausted and dizzy, but he’s glad to be leaving the cramped hospital room. Yasmin smiles and squeezes his shoulders.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re scheduled for a check up in a week,” she tells him. “Just to see how you’re feeling. Hopefully some of those memories will have started showing back up.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco swallows. “Right,” he says. “Of course.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The day outside is chill and drizzly. He and Mother walk, slowly, carefully, with measured steps, to the nearest apparation point. He clings to her arm as she Side-Alongs them to … Draco is expecting the Manor, but when his head stops spinning, he finds himself standing in the entrance hall of a small flat. Outside, he can hear the drizzle of rain. The flat is modest, with a cozy sitting room and a cramped kitchen. A single bedroom that overlooks a miniscule, overgrown garden in the back. Mother guides him to sit on a couch in the small sitting room, pulls out her wand to light the fireplace. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where is this?” Draco asks. It isn’t home and that’s all he knows. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother’s hands seem to be restlessly moving, fingers curling together, squeezing, tugging, twisting. “It’s mine,” she says, softly. “I come visit often. It’s where I stay when I do.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s small. What about the Manor?” Where is </span>
  <em>
    <span>home</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Why aren’t they going </span>
  <em>
    <span>home</span>
  </em>
  <span>?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother looks over at him with a pinched expression. “It… the Manor is gone, love.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you mean gone?” Draco demands.  He feels itchy all over. There’s so much information that everyone knows about him, about this life, about the world around him. He gets the distinct feeling that Mother is frustrated that he doesn’t know, that he has to ask.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother sighs, heavy, her shoulders seeming to slump with a weight that Draco can’t possibly comprehend. She comes to the couch with him, sitting with her hands in her lap, fingers laced tight together. “The Manor’s been gone for a while, my darling,” she says. Mother lifts one hand and covers his own. Draco turns his wrist and grips her fingers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The Manor was taken by the Ministry when Lucius was sentenced to Azkaban,” Mother says. The words feel distant. Like perhaps they should hurt worse than they do. The Manor is gone and Father is gone and it feels like he can’t feel it at all. He squeezes Mother’s hand tighter, dropping his gaze to his lap. Mother keeps speaking, her voice soft, a gentle murmur at his shoulder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It was the stronghold for the He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,” Mother explains. “There wasn’t… there wasn’t any way the ministry would let it keep standing. We were allowed a handful of heirlooms and portraits but the rest was seized or destroyed.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>We</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Draco lived through this. He tries to imagine himself as he is now, going into the Manor, picking out what would be best to take with them. Only allowed what they can carry. And the rest? He can’t even fathom what it is they would have taken. His childhood had been filled with beautiful, fragile heirlooms strewn about the Manor. Portraits that watched him with hawk-eyes as he played on the stairwell, in the drawing room, chasing the garden cat in through the kitchen’s open back doors. And now it’s gone-- mostly, almost all of it. The collection of vases from Great Aunt Beatrice. Grandfather Abraxas’ pocket watch. Was that among the kept? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco can’t imagine anything being kept in this tiny little flat. Perhaps Mother took them with her to Nice. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How about some tea?” Mother asks, finally. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Swallowing, Draco nods. “Tea,” he agrees. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother bustles into the kitchen, leaving him to the quiet of the sitting room. The clattering sound of a kettle on the stove. Water pouring. Draco pushes his hands against his face and exhales softly. He can feel the thrum of pain behind his eyes. He would almost welcome a migraine-- it would mean finding a quiet, dark place to curl up and forget the rest of the world. But even digging the heels of his palms against his sockets doesn’t urge forward much more than a pulse at his temple. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco drops his hands as Mother returns with a mug of tea. He takes it, letting the ceramic warm his palms. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you… what do you remember?” Mother asks. Draco swallows, squeezing his eyes shut for a moment. He doesn’t want to say. But her voice sounds so aching, so desperate for information. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco clears his throat. “The… the last stand, at… at school. When he… When You-Know-Who…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother squeezes his shoulder. “That was eight years ago,” she says. “You’ve… you’ve moved on. We all have.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then why doesn’t it feel like it?” Draco croaks. “I woke up and all I could think was </span>
  <em>
    <span>how am I alive</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Darling,” Mother says. It’s loaded. There are a million things she wants to say, he can feel it in the way the endearment rolls off her tongue. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He doesn’t want to hear it. He doesn’t want to know. His life had gone on without him and now he’s here-- not seventeen but not twenty-five, confused, frustrated, maybe terrified. He can’t stop hearing Healer Yasmin’s voice in his ear: </span>
  <em>
    <span>Your husband</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Can’t stop seeing Potter’s hand, soft, approaching from his peripheral in the hospital room. Familiar. Like touching him is so familiar, like he’s allowed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Please,” Draco says, voice tight. “I can’t. I don’t…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry wants to come by,” Mother says. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She says his name easily, like she’s had a fair bit of practice getting it out of her mouth. The sound of it hits the ear wrong and Draco hunches his shoulders against his jaw. Mother presses on, speaking gently over his obvious discomfort.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The Healer said it would be good for you to be around familiar people,” Mother insists. Familiar! As if Potter were anything other than a reminder of all his moral failings. A reminder that Potter was able to do what he couldn’t-- walked a path that Draco had turned his back on. How had they even come into each other's lives again? Had eight years changed so much about him, about Potter, that they were-- that this was…? His mind struggles to comprehend what he knows, what everyone seems to know. He keeps thinking around it, refusing to focus on Potter, on who he was. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t want to see him,” Draco deadpans. “He isn’t familiar. He’s-- I can’t. I don’t want to.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He doesn’t look at Mother but he can practically feel her staring at him. He looks down at his mug, the tea slowly going tepid. “I need to lay down,” he says, finally. He hasn’t taken a sip of tea.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course,” Mother murmurs. Her hands flutter in his peripheral before simply falling still. She stands, leading him through the small flat to the bedroom. The bed is turned down, fresh sheets. The window looking out over the garden in the back of the flat lets in grey, rainy light, making the room feel dark and cozy. Mother hovers. Draco wishes that this could all just go away. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Clothes have been brought from somewhere-- soft pajamas, nice slacks, button ups. They’re piled in a suitcase on a chair in the corner of the room. They’re his, clearly, but he doesn’t remember ever having owned clothes so casual, so borderline-Muggle. Mother leaves him alone, gently closing the door. Draco hovers by the end of the bed, looking around the dim room. There are pictures on the bedside table-- Mother and himself, smiling, waving. He doesn’t know where they are, when it was taken. His hair is shorter in the picture. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There are others, too, on the bookshelf. These ones are more startling. A picture of himself and Potter, looking over their shoulders from some unnamed balcony. It seems more recent, his hair in a plait, Potter’s face scruffy with the dark facial hair. They keep looking back out over the scenery, then over their shoulder at whoever is behind the camera. Potter’s hand comes up and presses behind his shoulder blades. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco turns the picture around so it’s facing the back of the bookshelf. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The others have a combination of himself and Mother, smiling in the sun, standing in front of monuments, having tea at an outside table at a cafe. All of these moments, immortalized in photographs, things he can’t remember. There isn’t a single picture of Father.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His stomach twists in hunger, but he’s already sulked his way into the bedroom. Draco changes into the soft pajamas that have been laid out for him, pulling his hair out from underneath the collar of the shirt. He doesn’t know what to do with it all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Crawling into bed is a relief. He pulls the blankets up over his head. They smell fresh and clean. It’s easy for him to burrow his nose in the fabric, squeeze his eyes shut and let the silence of the room wash over him. Beyond the closed door, Draco can hear Mother moving around the flat. The sounds of the kitchen. Of her soft footsteps. The sounds of the flat are contained, muted. It isn’t the same as the Manor. The Manor used to echo, the sounds slipping from one end of his home to the other. He misses it. He misses his home. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco rolls, restless. Sleep doesn’t come. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>III.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother tip-toes around him. The days are achingly long and Draco knows it’s his fault. He doesn’t want to hear about the life he’s missing and Mother runs out of things to say to him. Migraines come frequently now, just as Yasmin said they would. The potion for the pain knocks him out, leaves him taking long naps curled up on the couch or in Mother’s bed. His sleep schedule is so thrown off that he and Mother are awake at the same time for only a few hours in the morning and again in the evening. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They don’t talk about real things. He can tell that it’s getting harder for Mother not to say what she wants to say. Draco isn’t even sure if it’s helping him. Certainly, all it seems to be doing is making him more and more aware of everything he doesn’t know, drawing his anxieties out. He allows only snippets of information: how long Father has been in Azkaban, what it’s like in Nice, where they went for vacation in some of the photographs. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Three days after coming home from St. Mungos, Draco awakens mid-afternoon to the sound of voices on the other side of the bedroom door. One is Mother, the melody familiar but frustrated. The rhythm of them rise and fall, louder and then softer, furious. It’s difficult to make out the words. Draco lies there for a while, struggling to pick out the identity of the second voice. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rolling out of bed, Draco eases to the door and pulls it open a touch, leaning against the jamb. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s not ready,” Mother says, sounding exasperated. They’re in the kitchen. He can hear her fumbling with something, the clatter of dishes. “He doesn’t even want to hear about the trials. In his head he’s seventeen and the war just ended. He closes up every time I try to talk about his life, what it’s like now.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The sound of Potter’s voice shakes Draco to his core when he says, “He’s my </span>
  <em>
    <span>husband</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” as if repeating it would make it any more true. The word makes him dizzy. Nausea. It makes him want to wretch, though he can’t pinpoint why. Something like fear, like terror, running up his spine, nipping at his heels. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And my </span>
  <em>
    <span>son</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Mother scolds. Her voice softens again and Draco has to lean into the hall to catch her next words. “Darling, I am not </span>
  <em>
    <span>keeping</span>
  </em>
  <span> him from you. You know that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter sighs. “I know.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He’ll be seeing the Healer again in four days,” Mother says. “And maybe by then his memories will have come back.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And if they don’t?” Potter, again. “You’re going to stay holed up in this flat with my husband for who knows how long? There’s only one bedroom. What about Sadie?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Sadie</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Draco frowns, inching further out into the hall. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If I have to,” Mother says fiercely. It pulls something in the center of Draco’s chest. He wants to go to her, but the knowledge of Potter’s presence keeps him trapped in the hall. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There’s a beat of silence before Potter puffs a laugh. “Cissy,” he says. The same way Ginevra had said </span>
  <em>
    <span>Cissy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. All of these people, insinuated into his life, calling Mother by a nickname he had only ever heard Aunt Bellatrix use. Had never heard Father use. Draco takes another step in the hall and a floorboard creaks under his weight. The silence in the kitchen becomes purposeful now. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Darling?” Mother calls. Footsteps, more than just one pair. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother comes around the corner of the kitchen and into the hall, followed closely by Potter. His unruly hair is pushed back off his face but loose, his face clean shaven now. It makes him look younger, closer to twenty-five than he looked in the hospital room. Mother looks stricken, nervous, but Potter is looking at him over her shoulder with an expression that feels unreadable. Draco sinks back towards the bedroom door. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How are you feeling?” Mother asks. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fine,” Draco says, clipped. He lets his gaze drop. The flat, already small, feels immediately cramped with Potter there.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Darling,” Mother murmurs-- not to him, to Potter, now. “Maybe it would be best…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter exhales harshly. The sound of it seems pulled deep out of his chest. Draco refuses to look, finds himself staring pointedly at a spot on the opposite wall. “Right,” Potter says, out of Draco’s periphery. “Yeah.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother and Potter both retreat from the hall. Only then does Draco allow his gaze to lift, to follow their backs as they disappear into the sitting room. A low murmur of voices. Mother saying, “I’ll owl you, darling,” and, “I know this is difficult.” Potter’s voice is too low to hear the response, but before long there’s the familiar snarl of the Floo powder hitting the fireplace, swallowing Potter up and whisking him away from here. Goodbye and good riddance!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco chases the silence that follows out into the sitting room. Mother stands in front of the fireplace, the green flames still licking in the embers, her hands gripping the mantle. Her shoulders are drawn taut, her head bowed. He can see the infinitesimally small tremors that ripple through her shoulders. A familiar pain starts to take root in Draco’s chest-- disappointing Mother, causing Mother distress, a childhood terror that would cling to him, daily. It seems he has not shaken it, does not think he ever could. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Drawing a deep breath, Draco steps further into the sitting room, allows the pad of his bare feet on the floor to announce his presence. Mother moves only enough to straighten her back, loosen her shoulders. “Who’s Sadie?” Draco decides to ask. If he cannot hear about his own life, perhaps he could hear about Mother’s. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother turns to face him, her lips drawn into a thin smile. “Come have breakfast,” she urges, wrapping her thin arms around his shoulders and drawing him with her to the kitchen. He sits at the small round table while Mother commands eggs and toast with her wand-- skills he never knew her to have in his childhood --to cook themselves upon the strove. When the food is presented on a plate and settled on the table, Draco finds himself to be ravenous. His stomach, so used to the daily nausea from the migraines, had been picking at toast and filled with tea. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It takes all of Draco’s pure-blood upbringing not to swallow the eggs in two bites. He picks and nibbles at them, polite as he’s been taught. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sadie,” Draco prompts, once Mother seats herself across from him, passing a mug of tea across the table top. “Potter mentioned… I heard, that is… who is Sadie?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother’s smile goes soft, secret, her eyes turning downward. Draco watches a pretty flush come to her cheeks. “Sadie is a friend,” she says, which sounds like a warm, delighted, bold-faced lie. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The lie seems familiar, though, in an abstract way. Like she’s told it to him before, like they’ve had this exact conversation. It rings almost-true in the back of his mind, but when he reaches for the memory there’s nothing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A friend,” Draco repeats.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A lot has changed in eight years,” Mother says, lifting her gaze. She’s smiling, looking loose and soft. “I met her in Nice. She’s a Charms advisor for the French Ministry. We…” Mother’s gaze flickers. Draco wonders what she’s searching for in his face-- disapproval, disgust? He searches for it in himself, tries to find the gut-instinct that tells him </span>
  <em>
    <span>No, no, no</span>
  </em>
  <span> when Yasmin mentioned his </span>
  <em>
    <span>husband</span>
  </em>
  <span>. It isn’t there. He cannot turn it outward, onto his mother. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You,” Draco prompts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We.” Mother smiles, seems to flutter in her seat. “You attended the ceremony in November.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ceremony. Draco feels a little off kilter. Father is gone and Mother has moved on so thoroughly, so spectacularly, that </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sadie</span>
  </em>
  <span> the Charms advisor for the French Ministry has taken his place. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What was it like?” Draco asks, feeling dizzy. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother warms and brightens when she talks about it. A quiet, sea-side wedding. Only family had attended. Family, of course, being Draco and Potter and Aunt Andromeda and young Edward Tonks and the youngest Weasley siblings and Granger. Family. Draco had never had a large family, before. Mummy and Father and Auntie Bella and that was it. Grandfather died when he was too young to remember, Grandmother even before that. He’d never known Aunt Andromeda, nor any of his cousins as they stretched out further and further from the Black family name. And the Malfoy side, well, forget about it-- one son each for generations, no Aunties or Uncles or Cousins to spare.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And so there was a ceremony. There are pictures, Mother says, but they’re all back in Nice. It was beautiful, according to Mother. Draco can feel his heart thud, dull, echoey, in the center of his chest. He can’t pinpoint why. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sadie can’t take time off work to be here, Draco surmises from Mother’s nervous, jittery rambling. So she came on her own. Potter’s words seem to echo in his head-- that Mother is here, missing Sadie, holed up in this miniscule flat with him, because of him. Never having felt particularly brave before, Draco wonders if it would not be better to bite the bullet and return… home. Wherever his home might be. He suspected with Potter. The thought is so jarring and unsettling that he brushes it off and allows the guilt of his selfishness to gnaw at him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He wants to stay here, with Mummy, and that’s that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Talking about Sadie seems to loosen Mother up some, though. She hedges towards other topics, things about his post-war life that Draco isn’t sure that he’s ready to know. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He lives in a Wizarding district of London. Draco assumes with Potter, though Mother very carefully never says so. He’s going for his Potion’s Mastery and was in the middle of doing course-work when the accident happened.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Twenty-five seems a bit late to be trying for my Mastery,” Draco says, unnerved.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You weren’t sure what you wanted to do,” Mother explains, her voice etching the sound of her smile. “You had a bit of trouble finding someone to take you under as an apprentice, even after your acquittal--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ah. So he had been acquitted. Draco isn’t sure how to feel about it-- a clean slate, certainly, but it didn’t seem to have worked in his favor. Mother looks a little chastened that she’d let the information slip, but forges on all the same.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You gave Cursebreaking a try,” Mother says, nearly grinning at the memory, if such an expression were not unfitting of a woman of her standing. “It went a bit poorly. No fault of your own, of course, darling. Then there was your brief flirtation with law. You wanted to be a barrister! And then solicitor. You would have left a fair few Wizards penniless, I’m sure.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother barrels through his failed careers with something like amused joy, counting them off on her fingers. “You were twenty-three, I think, when you finally landed on getting your potions Mastery. You want to open up a specialty Apothecary. Of course you do, </span>
  <em>
    <span>of course</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” Mother laughs, not unkind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother tells him all these things that feel true for someone else. For a Draco who is twenty-five, eight years over the war. Not him. Not him, barely seventeen, still reeling from the idea that he had faced no criminal charges for the things that he’s done. The orders he followed. The people he hurt. The deaths he undoubtedly caused. No one seems to be talking about that. He can’t decide if they’re dancing around it or if it’s all been swept under the rug after eight long years. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re quite close to finishing,” Mother says. “And… and certainly you’ll get your memories back any day now. Before the week is out, I bet. Everything will make sense, then.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right,” Draco agrees, voice hollow. The idea of his memories coming back feels less and less likely the more he learns about himself. Eight years. Gone, in a single miscalculation of potion ingredients. And if they were gone forever… Draco can see the same uncertainty echoed back at him in Mother’s face, her lips gone tight and thin.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They’ll come back,” Mother assures.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The words are for herself as much as they are for him</span>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
IV.</p>
<p>
  <span>At the end of the week, Draco meets with Yasmin in a small exam room at St. Mungo’s. Mother waits outside, nervous and tetchy. It’s been a long week and he can tell with every passing day that Mother’s anxiety about his memories is getting worse. Holed up in the flat, there’s nothing for him to do but read the books on the bookshelf and stare out onto the street and explore the tiny, overgrown garden. He’s taken to pulling up the weeds strangling some of the flower beds up against the fence, if only to have something to do. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How are you feeling?” Yasmin asks, looking over an arrangement of papers detailing Draco’s treatment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tired, all the time,” Draco admits. “Migraines every day now.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Yasmin hums, nods, makes a note of it. “Those should start getting better soon,” she assures. “How about your memories?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco shakes his head, hands twisting together. “Nothing,” he says. “Mother has tried telling me things, but nothing seems to help.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Yasmin frowns over her papers before settling them in her lap. “You really ought to think about easing back into your regular life,” she says, tone careful. Draco knows what she means without her having to say it: he should move back in with Potter. He should accept the impossible: that he lives with Potter, that they are… somehow, they have… Draco shakes his head, pushing his hands through his hair and flipping it over to one side. He ought to cut it all off, seeing as he has no idea how to deal with it all. He can’t even do a proper braid. It’s long and getting in the way and really, he ought to just slice it off.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s not my life,” Draco says firmly. “It’s not. It’s someone else’s. Someone else lived this life for eight years, but it certainly wasn’t me. I don’t have a husband. I </span>
  <em>
    <span>couldn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span>... And if by some strange twist in reality I did, it certainly wouldn’t be… him.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Him,” Yasmin repeats. “Mr. Potter.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes,” Draco says firmly. “We’re not… </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m</span>
  </em>
  <span> not…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There’s an uncomfortable pause where all the things Draco </span>
  <em>
    <span>isn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> hover in the silence. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We can still have a Legilimens look,” Yasmin offers. “See how far down the memories are.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The thought of someone poking around in his head is so terrible that Draco physically recoils, pressing himself back in his chair as hard as possible. “I would prefer not to,” he says, voice gone thick. Yasmin’s expression is soft and gooey. Her hand is warm on his wrist as she reaches out to touch him, giving him a squeeze. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s going to be difficult,” Yasmin says, pulling her chair closer. Draco can smell her shampoo. She takes his hand in her own, pressing their palms together. Draco squeezes back, looking down and watching the contrast of her skin against his own. “But you </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span> live this life.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco exhales shakily, squeezing Yasmin’s hand until his knuckles hurt. “I don’t know what to say to any of them,” Draco admits in a quiet murmur. “Not even Mother.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’ll come when it comes,” Yasmin says. And as nonsensical as it sounds, as ridiculous, it settles something in Draco’s stomach. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It’ll come when it comes</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Draco nods, suddenly finding himself laughing, the sound caught in the back of his throat. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The rest of the meeting involves patiently sitting through Yasmin’s diagnostic spells before being told that, other than the memory loss, he’s recovering perfectly fine from the accident. Yasmin gives him another supply of potions for the migraines and then he’s free to go. Upon returning home, the flat seems even smaller after venturing back out into the world. It’s a perfectly fine place to vacation when visiting London, but Draco is certain it wasn’t meant to be lived in long term. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was easy to want to give into the selfish temptation of staying here with Mother-- she was, after all, his </span>
  <em>
    <span>mother</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and he her </span>
  <em>
    <span>son</span>
  </em>
  <span>. But in the days that followed, Draco found himself caught up in watching the way Mother stared with such longing at the Floo, as if hoping to get a fire-call from some mysterious Charm’s advisor. She hadn’t called Sadie, not once since Draco’s stay began. And why should he care, really? He didn’t ask for any of this. He woke up with a broken brain. Through no fault of his own! Through only the fault of someone else who had been piloting his body without his consent for the last eight years. Why shouldn’t he get to luxuriate, alone, unbothered by the outside world? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter is keeping contact. That much he knows. He watches Mother hastily tuck away letters and send off quick notes with an eagle owl that doesn’t reside in the flat. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Potter</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Thinking about him is difficult-- two parts embarrassing, two parts infuriating. Wholly unsettling. How dare he, really? Hadn’t Draco made it increasingly clear that he wanted nothing to do with him? That this false idea he had about him, about what they were to one another, wouldn’t be tolerated? Oh, surely Mother is telling him to just wait it out, that any day his memories would come back to him and it would all be just fine.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It wouldn’t! It certainly and most ardently </span>
  <em>
    <span>would not</span>
  </em>
  <span> be just fine. Draco could not imagine any scenario, any memory, that might bridge the gap of helpless, impotent anger he felt. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He doesn’t want to know how. He doesn’t want to know why. He wants, simply, to no longer be a hostage to a life he didn’t choose. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Darling,” Mother says in that loaded, careful way of hers in the days following his visit with Yasmin. It’s early evening and he’s just come out on the other side of a migraine, exhausted and tetchy as he lays curled up on the couch. Mother has brought him tea. He can hear the scrape of the ceramic on the glass top of the coffee table. Her hand is soft when it falls to brush his hair off his forehead. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I think you ought to talk with someone,” Mother suggests. Her voice carries just over his head to the left of the couch as she takes root on the settee. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve already spoken with the Healer,” Draco murmurs into the crook of his arm, deliberately obtuse. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I was thinking someone else,” Mother says patiently. “Perhaps Blaise Zabini might make it easier to…” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A beat of silence. Draco lifts his head from his arm and peers over at her, eyes still sensitive in the low light of the sitting room. “Easier to,” he deadpans.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother smiles, but it’s tight around her eyes. Mother’s smiles always seem to be tight these days. Or hiding something. Draco can’t quite pinpoint which, but he knows it has to do with him and this flat and the confining walls and the hours ticking away, one day rolling into the next. Talking to someone, even to Blaise, would be making an effort. An effort he wasn’t sure he was ready to make in the first place. Why should he have to… The thought cuts off, miserably, because he knows why.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Darling,” Mother murmurs. She stands and moves, only to crouch elegantly by his head, her hand stroking his hair back. Her thumb ghosts along the apple of his cheek. “You are </span>
  <em>
    <span>so</span>
  </em>
  <span> very loved. Everyone is worried. They miss you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The words itch the inside of Draco’s ribs. He’s never known that to be true. Not in the way that Mother means it. He frowns, turning his face against her palm. She leans in, pressing her dry lips to his forehead. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Everyone</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Draco thinks of the people in the hospital room: Granger with her pregnant belly, the Weasley siblings and Ginevra’s stricken, white face. And Blaise, who he could understand the most. But where did he fit into all of it? Who was he to each of them? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Loved</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Mother said, with conviction that Draco could not muster.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t understand,” Draco says, finally, letting it spill from his lips. It comes out rough, tight in the back of his throat, half-unwilling and half compulsory. “How did I get here?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother’s eyes turn sad. She drops her hands; Draco finds them with his own, squeezing. “Only you know that,” she says. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I </span>
  <em>
    <span>don’t</span>
  </em>
  <span>!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You will.” Her expression looks drawn taut, as if she is doing her best to keep her patience with him. It’s familiar. The look of a mother. Draco wretches his hands from her own and turns his back to the room, curling up tight on the couch. He’s tired of this, tired of everyone expecting his memories to come back. He hasn’t got them, he doesn’t want them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In the end, it’s Sadie that forces Draco out of inaction. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Two weeks since the accident has made the flat impossibly cramped. Draco has ripped all the weeds from the small back garden, read all of the most interesting books on the bookshelf, and exhausted what little information he can from Mother without treading into territory that he doesn’t want to know. Love him as she must, Draco can tell that Mother is growing tired. The migraines have subsided for the most part, leaving Draco with large swaths of his day no longer consumed by sleeping off a potion. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Coming in from the back garden, Draco can hear the soft murmur of voices in the sitting room, the crackle of the Floo. Inching just on the other side of the doorway, Draco peers in. Mother is sat kneeling in front of the Floo. In the fireplace is the head and shoulders of a woman, dark skinned and handsome, her tight curls cropped close to her head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I just don’t know what to do,” Mother murmurs. “He doesn’t want to know anything. I’m trying, Sadie, but…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d be petrified if I were him,” Sadie says. The insinuation flares up something rough and grouchy inside of him. “You can take as long as you need, darling.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Darling</span>
  </em>
  <span>. A new familial habit? Had Sadie picked it up from Mother, or Mother from Sadie? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I just miss you,” Mother murmurs. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Feeling much the voyeur, Draco slinks back out into the garden, shame chasing him all the way.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That night, long after the Floo has gone silent, long after Mother has retired for the evening, long after Draco has sat, irritated, with his shame and guilt, he drafts a letter. </span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Potter,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>It is with great reluctance that I reach out to you. It has come to my attention that staying in London with me during my recovery is keeping Mother from her duties as a new wife back in Nice. I have been informed that my usual residence is in the Wizarding district of London. After I have suitably informed Mother of my intentions, I will be arriving by Floo this upcoming Sunday. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Do not mistake me. I have no memory of our acquaintanceship and have no desire to know more. I am returning to our shared place of residence because it is, for all intents and purposes, my home.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>That is all.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Best.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Draco Abraxas Malfoy.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>He writes the letter three times over and then carefully etches out his final copy onto some nice parchment paper he found in the desk in the sitting room. Mother doesn’t keep an owl, though, so he folds the letter up and tries to pretend that it’s mere existence isn’t the thing keeping him from settling down to sleep on the couch. He tosses and turns through most of the night, wishing at least he had a migraine to blame for it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In the morning, Draco drags himself awake, showers, dresses, and finds Mother in the kitchen nursing tea and staring out into the back garden. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve got a letter to send,” he says, bravely. “And then I believe I should prepare to return… to where I live. Home, wherever that is.”</span>
</p>
<p>There’s a lot of weeping that goes into it all, all of it from Mother. She sends his letter off with the eagle owl that shows up with the daily checking-up from Potter. And then there’s weeping, Mother holding him in the kitchen and telling him, “I love you so much, my darling,” and pressing wet kisses to his temples and cheeks. Draco can tell there’s more to it, of course-- excitement, desire to return home, to get back to Nice, to see Sadie, to shepherd him off to someone else for a while. If Draco were not so bent on his martyrdom he might throw a tantrum over the whole display.</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter’s reply comes quickly, just before lunch. Mother insists on walking down to the bakery around the corner for fresh treats. Draco is sitting in the kitchen, watching the garden out back, when the eagle owl returns once more, pecking at the glass of the window. Standing, Draco lets it in and carefully unties the letter from it’s ankle. The bird coos and rubs against his arm, pinching the fabric of his shirt lightly with its beak. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The returning letter is short.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Draco,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Sunday. Sounds like a plan.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I miss you.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Love,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Harry x</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>“What is this?” Draco asks the bird, frustrated, furious, wanting to rip it to shreds. He shows the paper to the owl, who simply bites the corner and rips it off. “Absolutely,” he agrees, feeling all at once foolish and vindicated. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sunday comes quicker than he might have imagined.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The day is uncomfortably, unseasonably warm. The windows that overlook the street in the sitting room are open, letting in a short breeze. The whole house smells like fresh air, like springtime, like the onset of summer. Mother stands with him in front of the fireplace. Behind him, she hums soft and low. It’s a tune he doesn’t know. He’s been puttering about the flat for hours. Taking his time waking up, hogging the shower, insisting that he and Mother take breakfast out in the garden.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Then there was packing his clothes, which took little to no time at all. He had insisted on putting the books he’d borrowed back on the shelf and made a show of having misplaced one, finding it only after twenty minutes of poking around the sitting room. Finally, though, the time arrives. It’s just past eleven. He stands in front of the Floo with his heart racing, his stomach twisting, his brain buzzing through a million different scenarios as to what awaits him on the other side of the fireplace.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t want to go,” Draco says, staring at the Floo, twisting the handle of his suitcase in his hands. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother’s hands come up from behind, tucking in a loose strand of hair from the complicated plait she’d done in his hair for him that morning. “We don’t cancel plans last minute, darling,” she says warmly. “And I have a Porkey to catch back to Nice in two hours.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve changed my mind,” Draco begs. “I’ll come back to Nice with you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mother’s hands squeeze his shoulders as she comes around to stand in front of him. Her smile is indulgent now, her well of patience restored with the knowledge that she would soon be on her way back home. It isn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>fair</span>
  </em>
  <span> and all Draco wants to do is protest it down to the very last second. Mother would stay, he knows. If he asked, sincerely. If he begged her to stay, to not make him leave, to let him retreat in cowardice. She would do it because she loves him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Be brave, my darling,” Mother says, drawing him down, kissing his forehead. She smells like perfume. It itches his nose.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not at all,” Draco murmurs. “I’ve only ever been foolish.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Foolishness begets bravery,” Mother says. “You can do this.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And he does.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Floo powder trickles through his fingers before he throws the whole fistful down into the hearth and proclaims his destination, hoping his voice doesn’t warble too much. The green flames leap up, cool to the touch, wrapping themselves around him. His eyes squeeze shut as he rushes through the Floo network, pinched and rattled about until he finds his footing underneath him again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The first thing he sees as he steps out of the fireplace is a sitting room decorated in light grey with yellow accents:  the lampshade, the throw pillows on the settee, the rug in front of the hearth. The window to the left looks out over the street, the curtains drawn back to let in the early afternoon light. There’s a desk in the corner, piled with books and papers. His eyes follow the line of the furniture until they land on a figure in the doorway. Potter stands leaning against the jamb, his hair damp. He must have just gotten out of the shower.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There’s a moment of silence. Then, Potter pulls a wand from the back pocket of his trousers. He holds it out, handle facing Draco, as if trying to coax him the few metres across the sitting room floor. The wand is familiar in a way that kick starts his heart, has it thrumming in the back of his throat. The hawthorn wand. The last time he had seen it was in the drawing room at the manor. Potter had wrenched it away from him, had stolen it and disappeared before the Dark Lord had been able to come. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It hadn’t occurred to Draco that he might get it back. Now, eight years after the inciting incident. The last wand he had used, at Hogwarts, at the battle, to throw spells, had been his mother’s. The wand feels monumental. It feels impossible. Draco feels his throat tightening as he steps out of the hearth, dropping his suitcase to the floor with a dull thud. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“My wand,” Draco says.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Potter agrees. As if it’s that easy. “I forgot to bring it to St. Mungo’s when… after.” Potter clears his throat, pushes his free hand against the back of his neck. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco eyes him warily, taking enough steps only to be able to reach out and take his wand back. Having it back in his hand he can feel his magic curling up his arm, sinking into his skin, settling in the center of his chest. He had hardly noticed how desperately he missed having his wand in the last two weeks, stuck as he was with migraines and potions and sleeping the days away. Having it in his hands, now, though… Draco flips his wand over in his fingers before holding it firmly by the handle. He seems to have had his wand back for some time now, based on how blasé Potter had been upon returning it. The thought makes him want to turn back around into the Floo. So much of his life, so many milestones, just gone on without him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you,” he says, clipped. He can feel Potter’s eyes on him and the silence seems cautious. Draco keeps his eyes down for as long as he can before having to give in and look Potter in the face. The expression he finds there is open like a book, hiding nothing. It reminds him of the way mother has been looking at him when she thinks he can’t see. Draco swallows around the tightness in his throat. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You want breakfast?” Potter asks, casual as anything. “I was just about to make some. French toast? Your favorite.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Your favorite</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The easy presumption with which Potter says it puts Draco’s teeth on edge. He doesn’t want to </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> this. He doesn’t want to stay here and pretend that this sham of a life is something he would have ever wanted to live. He doesn’t want to make small talk with Potter over a breakfast of what would most certainly be shoddily made french toast, not his favorite, not by a long shot. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” Draco says, stiff and stilted. “I want to lay down. I’ve got migraines, you know.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter’s brows hedge up under his messy fringe. “Right,” he says in a voice that sounds indulgent, like Mother has already told him that Draco’s migraines have all but abated. Draco wills his face not to flush. “Bedroom’s where it always is.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco blinks heavily. “And that would be,” he deadpans. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter steps forward, into his space, and then smoothly passes him to he grabs the suitcase. “Come on,” he says, touching Draco’s elbow as he passes him through the doorway and into the hall. It’s all Draco can do not to flinch. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The bedroom, where it has always been, is down at the end of the hall. They pass by two rooms on the way. One looks like a study, the other is a bathroom. The last door is the bedroom. When Draco passes through the doorway, he’s struck by the lived-in feel of it. There’s a chair in the corner with piles of clothes and books, even more books set haphazardly on both bed-side tables, filled to the brim on the bookshelf. Potter grabs a pair of linen trousers off the end of the bed, which is still unmade from the night previous, and tosses them onto the laundry-book chair. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry,” Potter says. “Haven’t really had time to clean up.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter gives Draco a wide berth to circle back around to the doorway while Draco hovers at the end of the bed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This is the room where someone who isn’t him falls asleep, nightly. Someone who isn’t him probably has a side of the bed he sleeps on. Someone who isn’t him has no qualms falling asleep with another person in the bed, feet bumping, knees touching, arms brushing. The thought makes him want to crawl into a hole and never come out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, I’ll just…” Potter steps back into the hall. He doesn’t look like he wants to leave. His hand hovers on the doorframe, fingers digging at the wood.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes,” Draco agrees and closes the door firmly in his face. </span>
