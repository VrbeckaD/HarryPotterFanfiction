          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was obvious to Draco's eye that this was a Nott wedding, though he wasn't quite sure about the Weasley side of it all. In all fairness, however, he had been to a very few Weasley weddings, but Theo had absolutely insisted on his attendance to this particular one, and secretly, Draco was glad about it.</p><p>He looked around athe beautifully decorated pavillion, the hordes of guests, and the well-stocked bar, that, on any other day would have been his preferred spot to be at.

His train of thought was broken by the music that suddenly started up. He looked up at the pavilion to find that Theo was somehow already there, and had probably been the one to tell the musicians to begin.</p><p>Sighing, he turned to the redhead standing beside him, apparently lost in thought. He took a deep breath.</p><p>"Care to dance?"</p><p>She frowned in disbelief at him for a few moments. Then, she smiled.</p></div>
