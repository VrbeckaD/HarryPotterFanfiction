    <p>     “-this essay will have to be at least three pages long and turned in to me by the beginning of class Monday,’” Professor Amaro paused, obviously waiting for somebody to ask the crucial question. Remus Lupin glanced at his fellow Mauraders, imploring one of them to ask the question for him so the class could end and he could start studying. Finally, Sirius Black obliged and raised his hand, snickering all the while.<br/>
     </p><p>     “Oh, but Professor, whatever is this essay about?” James Potter smirked at Remus, who was obviously embarrassed at his friends’ antics.<br/>
     </p><p>     “I’m so glad you asked, Mr. Black,” Amaro uttered in a monotone voice, “this essay will be about werewolves and,” Here he paused, looking around ominously, “  the dangers they pose to the wizarding world,”<br/>
     </p><p>     The effect on the Mauraders was almost instantaneous. Remus sank into his chair further, the color drained from his face. Sirius’ face quickly turned a mottled red, and he would have jumped at the professor if James had not grabbed both of his arms and held him down. Peter Pettigrew, the fourth Maurader, glanced around the room nervously.<br/>
     The rest of the class talked excitedly amongst themselves. For once, they were actually excited about an assignment. In one corner, the Ravenclaws were already planning what scathing remarks they would make about the werewolves. Moments later, Professor Amano dismissed them, and all the students filed out. Sirius glanced around for Remus, concerned for his friend, but he was gone.<br/>
     </p><p>     “James!” he called after his best friend, “Where’s Remus?”<br/>
     </p><p>     “Dunno,” James said, waiting for Sirius “but I bet he just headed to the common room,”<br/>
     </p><p>     “James,” Sirius said again, “Do you think he’s all right?”<br/>
     </p><p>     “I dunno. Moony’s pretty tough, though. I’m sure he’ll be fine,”<br/>
     </p><p>     “I’m going to find him!”<br/>
     </p><p>     Sirius felt mildly irritated at his best friend’s apparent disregard for Remus’s feeling, and he scowled at the scuffed tips of his shoes.<br/>
     </p><p>     “You do that. As for myself, I heard Evans saying she was headed to the dining hall and I have some questions I want to ask her about Potions,” James winked at Sirius and left the room, whistling to himself jovially.<br/>
     </p><p>     Sirius rolled his eyes and set off towards the Gryffindor Common Room. With the absence of his best friends came silence, and, he knew, judgment from the other students. They had all hated him from the day he arrived at Hogwarts with them because he came from a family they didn’t like. The stares and whispers always followed him, burned into him.<br/>
      Whenever he was alone, he was also followed by the accusing stares from the Slytherins, who believed they had been robbed of another loyal Black, Of course, he never noticed them when he was with his friends, but he still felt them whenever he was alone.<br/>
     Hearing the snickers from a cluster of Ravenclaws still chatting in the corner of the room, Sirius hastened his pace and was soon in front of the Fat Lady, who huffed irritably and asked him for the password. Before she could even finish her sentence, he was answering and bursting into the silent common room. On first glance, he saw that Remus’ favorite seat by the fire was vacant He meticulously searched the room and their dormitories for his friend, even checking the bathrooms, but Remus was nowhere to be found.</p>
