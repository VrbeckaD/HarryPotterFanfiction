    <p>
  <span>       Everyone had been surprised by Harry Potter when the war had ended, Severus Snape included. The boy had stayed at the castle the whole summer with the aurors, the staff, and the construction crew to rebuild the school rather than immediately taking his place as an auror in training as Ron Weasley had. Weirdly enough, he didn't often assist with the things that used a wand to be fixed, he preferred physical labor, lifting stones one by one on the destroyed exterior, letting others in the castle place wards and protection upon the brickwork. Hermione and Ron had returned to do nothing more than set the paintings upon the walls with him. Severus overheard their conversation that day, they had claimed that he had the right to take a break, to let other people do the work instead of him this time. But he had refused, claiming he needed it. Sitting around made him go stir-crazy, a problem only made worse by the war. By consequence, boy had a huge appetite whenever meals were laid out. Severus avoided taking part in them, but on the rare times that he did, the smiles he got from the tanned and toned savior of the wizarding world were blinding. It drove Severus crazy that the boy was so involved in everything, and that all he ever did anymore was smile. Not once did he complain of being overworked or in pain, although several times Minerva came down to the dungeons to request a pain relieving potion for the boy because he had pulled a muscle somewhere, and refused to let anything stop him from working. Severus had to admit, he was rather astonished at the amount of work Potter had done in so little time, especially with the exhausting level of physical labor, but Severus would deny ever thinking that should it come up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Even after completing the rebuild of the walls, the spell work the boy did was nearly perfect. It was nothing more than whispers, briefly waving his hand, then moving to the next brick just to repeat the process a thousand times. Figuring the boy was half-arseing it like he did with all his school work, Snape tested several of the bricks, only to find they were heavily laced with spells he shouldn't have learned until auror training. The monotony had to be driving him crazy, Severus told himself, but nothing ever showed that this thought was true; the kid actually seemed to be enjoying it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Snape found that Potter never seemed to work around all the others, and on several occasions Severus almost commented snidely on how the James-look-alike must be too good to be around anybody, but all evidence proved the notion wrong. The boy was at every meal, made friendly conversation, was always smiling, and even when he was alone he was humming, or laughing at nothing, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>still smiling</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The last time Severus had seen the boy with any other emotion had been close to a month ago, when the rebuilding truly started. The potions master had found the boy looking distraught in places like the room of requirement, the astronomy tower, and even the dungeons. But even then, the look only lasted for a few minutes before Potter would take a deep breath, place a forlorn smile on his lips and return to his work. Nobody on the staff understood the inner workings of Potter, and how he could move on so easily from the war when he had lost so much, literally died, and then return to a place that should hold memories of remorse and torment. But nothing appeared to bother him. It was like he was glowing, radiating happiness, and his smile lit the room brighter than any chandelier would, almost like nothing could touch him. He was purely an ethereal soul.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       One time in the middle of the night, Severus had heard a voice initially thinking it was a ghost, but he remembered that they had given the ghosts a temporary hold elsewhere until they could rebuild the castle. So the potions master wandered out of the staff washroom, following the voice until he got to the doors of the main entrance hall. He cracked it open to find Potter standing there, singing freely a song Severus had never heard, entangled in the enormous threads of crystals on the shattered chandelier, fixing each tiny piece one by one and stringing them back up. By hand. They both were there for hours into the night, Severus watching, Harry fixing, until the boy pulled out his wand, incanted </span>
  <em>
    <span>wingardium leviosa</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and the chandelier lifted back to the ceiling to its rightful spot, glowing brightly. They both stood there in silence, staring at the light until Severus heard the boy say “goodnight professor,” and walk away. Snape was frozen in place, unable to guess how the boy, whom he had thought to be anything but smart, knew he was there. Needless to say, the professor did not show up for breakfast the next morning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       It was only a month before the new school year would start. Snape had not shown up for any meals for a few days, as he was stuck in his office with twenty cauldrons all bubbling furiously so he could stock up the medical wing like he did every year. The man had not had time to breath, let alone eat. The man was bottling up every potion he had just finished when he heard a soft pop behind him. He finished filling, labelling and courking the bottle he in his hands, and turned to find an elf from the kitchens standing there with a filled tray in her hands. He dismissed her, saying he didn't have time, and turned back to his work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>        “Master Potter is telling me not to be leaving sir until yous has finished everything on the tray.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       He stopped and looked back at the elf. She remained resolute, denying his demands for her to leave until he left a stasis spell on the potions and ate begrudgingly. Snape had not realized anyone would mind his absence at the meals; nobody had the audacity to bother him when he was brewing. Then he reminded himself that this was Potter, he did whatever he bloody well pleased, and no one told him otherwise. Severus sneered and handed the tray back, telling her to leave and inform Potter to mind his own loony bin business. However, the trays kept showing up at every meal hour, and the day before Snape finished the batches, he got a note that simply said ‘yes professor’. The potions master immediately lit the piece of paper on fire. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       And then the brat told on him. The next night, Severus was visited by Mcgonagall, and was lectured well into the night about proper self care and the need for sunlight every now and again. He shook his head once the new headmistress of the school left the room. Potter had done as he said and let him be, but the smug smile cast his way when he walked in the doors of the dining hall let him know that the boy had won this round. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       The school was finished by about three weeks before the start of term, and the silence in the halls was damn near therapeutic in the mind of Snape. Almost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then Potter started showing up at his </span>
  <em>
    <span>door</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Severus almost slammed the door when he saw the smiling face of the green eyed boy, but it froze in its tracks, and Snape almost let his shock show when he realized that the boy’s hand was held up to stop it with zero physical contact. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Hello sir, wonderful evening we’re having. Do you mind if I step in for a brief chat?” His voice held no smugness, it was a simple request.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “No.” And the door shut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       This happened several nights in a row, and Severus was starting to lose his will to fight this minuscule tick-like annoyance in the back of his head. On the fourth night he didn't even wait to let Potter ask to come in, he just opened the door, and let him in with a deep sigh of annoyance that seemed to come straight from the center of the ‘fuck off’ part of his personality. Potter came in and politely stood, waiting to be told to sit, and that surprised him. The boy had seemed so confident a moment ago, and now here he was, tapping his foot soundlessly on the stone floors. The boy stared around the room, but the boy’s gaze seemed to linger on the cauldron a few times before he was snapped out of his reverie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Potter, what are you here for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       The boy stared at his teacher feeling a sense of dread at asking what he was here for, knowing it would be turned down. “I was wondering if I could borrow the potion journal written by Warren Kinglsey? He has this really interesting theory on the use of Monarch butterfly wings in the memory potions used in Auror interrogations…” The boy slowly fell silent as he saw the arched eyebrow on his potions professors face. He burned a slight red, knowing he was acting out of character… Borrowing a book should not be this hard! He looked back up when a soft thump sounded on the desk in front of him. He saw the book, and felt shocked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>       “Do not damage it, and do not lose it. It was a rather expensive journal to buy, and I would hate to lose it. This should not be too difficult for you to understand even with your lack of a brain. I'm not sure as to why you would want to borrow this anyway, you don't show any interest in potions to begin with.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Harry just shrugged and stood, grabbing the journal gingerly. He held it close, and thanked the professor, leaving the room. </span>
</p><p><span>       Harry had seemed to be feeling different recently, incredibly different. And he thought for a while that maybe it was all coming from the grace period after the war ended, but the thing was, that usually ended after a few days. It had for everyone else it seemed, as immediately everyone began stressing to put people in Azkaban, death sentence, or release them with a pardon. Whatever everyone else seemed to be experiencing was not happening to Harry, and then he thought about it one day when he couldn’t sleep, working to fix the massive entry way chandelier. He realized that maybe it was because he no longer had a connection to Voldemort. When the dark lord held a presence in Harry's head, it created a cloud over reality. He felt anger, grudges, resentment, terror, and no real expression of what was in him because he was bloody 17 and had to fight a war. Now he felt good. Every step he took felt like he was walking on a trampoline, he could feel himself floating, the smile never left, and he felt like he could talk to anyone. There were still some people that he would have trouble talking to because of their history like Snape, Malfoy, and a few other people. </span><span><br/></span> <span>He also noticed his desire to learn things had come back. When he was a child, a firstie, he came to this new school and saw it as an opportunity to become a whole new person, learn new things, and really jump in head first. And then he met a three headed dog named fluffy, a man named Voldemort, a man named Snape, and an item called the philosopher's stone. He had no chance to become or do what he had desperately wanted to because he had a war to fight, but this year he resolved to delve into his studies. This ended up creating a new love for a few things he never thought of as a possible career in his future. There was always DADA, but tacked onto this list now was charms, and potions. As a kid so deeply sucked into the issue of a teacher being overbearingly hard on him like his relatives, he found potions hard to get into, but he read a journal in the paper before the rebuilding began, and fell for it deeply. Ashe didn’t have the knowledge to do what he found so interesting, he read up on everything he could before the school year could officially start. So added onto his already busy schedule of rebuilding, answering daily inquiries from several papers, doing interviews he couldn't avoid, and attending trials for death eaters, he lost even more sleep reading these things. However, this had no effect upon him; on the contrary, he didn't even feel tired anymore. That was another new thing that he was noticing; he had entirely too much energy, and excessive magical power in him since Voldemort died. Whether this meant that Voldemort had been subconsciously repressing Harry’s magical power his whole life or not, Harry did not know, but he realized he had no problem doing things like he did when he was a kid, accidental magic actually. The ministry made the exception for students working on the school, like warding magic, repairing magic, and summoning magic. He found that he could think of something, and raise a hand with a beckoning gesture to find it floating his way. There was also the thing with Snape's door. Harry had been doing pretty well hiding his extra magic, afraid it would mean a lot of trouble for him and wanting to avoid that at all costs, but then the professor had seen it, and Harry immediately released the hold on the door hoping it wouldn't raise too much suspicion. </span></p><p><span>       He also noticed that he had no physical fatigue until he got hurt, and the pain was usually only noticeable when it had become excessive. He knew he was killing his body by doing that, but he couldn't handle the power without a release. He used wandless and wordless magic, doing everything by hand, hoping that it would tire him. It served to make his appetite grow, he gained muscle hidden underneath his dark skin, but the energy was still there, so recently, he decided he should start flying or running, and ended up doing both everyday possible. He realized it was only a few weeks until school started and then he could release the energy through healthy magic usage. His wand seemed to buzz in his hand and it nearly made him fearful that he would do something like destroy it, or channel so much magic through it he feared the result of the incantation. He kept this behind his smile, and it worked. While Headmistress Mcgonagall was an incredibly powerful woman, and an incredibly intelligent one as well, she didn't have the sense Dumbledore did when Harry would lie.</span><span><br/></span> <span>The night of the chandelier incident, Harry realized that he could feel people. Not physically, but almost like he could feel their magic, or their souls. This was something that almost scared him. At first he thought it was instinct, but then he realized that he felt Snape specifically standing there staring; without looking back at him once to be sure, he just knew. </span></p><p><span>       At this point, Harry didn't know whether or not to be scared of these new powers, because yesterday morning, he woke up to see his glasses were blurry. He thought nothing of it, assuming the prescription needed renewing, but earlier that morning, he realized he could see without his glasses. At this point, his glasses were only on so it wouldn't raise suspicion, and it gave him migraines. </span><span><br/></span><span>       He pushed the thoughts to the back of his head like always, and sat in the newly repaired library, letting the light from the window illuminate the pages that he saw were covered in spidery handwriting. At the front of the book were the letters H.B.P. Written in a near black blue colored ink, much like the one in the potions book he used from the Half Blood Prince. Similarly, the notes in the margins of every page were the same handwriting. Just legible, but enough to know they were half-arsed in their intricacy. Harry smirked at every snide comment made by who he recognized as Snape now, and the chapter with the theory Harry was interested in was absolutely covered in notes, pointing out flaws in the judgement, errors in uses, better ways they could have been used, what could have been substituted for what, and even commentary on what he thought of the authors thinking whether or not he actually agreed. Harry had an almost permanent smile playing on his lips at everything as he finished the whole journal. He closed the book, and stood once he had finished, realizing it was growing dark outside. He walked out, smiling at every teacher and the rare student he passed. </span><span><br/></span> <span>A few people, all of them students, had been sentenced to help with rebuilding efforts to repay their role in supporting the dark lord. Harry made it very clear that while they played a part, they were still young and deserved a second chance to prove themselves; they should not be put in Azkaban. Harry only did this for a few, all of whom were Slytherins: Pansy, Draco, Blaise, Theo, Astoria, and several others. Harry was saddened to think about whether or not sentencing Lucius to Azkaban was a good idea compared to house arrest like Narcissa, but in the end, not even he could get Narcissa off as innocent. Lucius was a hard one to sentence, because while he did regret it in the end, he had played a large part in the dark lord’s ability to gain power over the ministry. Harry worried that he would never be able to make amends with Draco because of this, even if Harry did get him off as innocent with no more than helping with rebuilding as a reparation. Harry shook this train of thought off as he came to the door of the potions room where his teacher would undoubtedly be. He knocked, and waited. And waited. And waited. Until he heard a quiet, “come in.” He walked in to find the teacher writing something down as he stirred counterclockwise slowly. It was bright yellow like a street sign in the muggle world. He stood there and watched silently, assessing the ingredient curiously. The man was heavily engaged in his writing, and Harry watched diligently and silently, noticing he was making a potion he did not recognize at all. He put down the quill, and grabbed a teaspoon of what looked like minced lace wings. The potion suddenly released a puff of glittering dust, turning a very nasty, pus colored, slime textured paste. Harry looked at it curiously. The man shed his cloak, and rolled up his sleeves, writing the outcome in a highly detailed account. Harry looked the man over and realized why he had suddenly started wearing neck-high cloaks and shirts. The jagged pink scarring covering his throat was harsh in contrast with his pale skin. Harry saw that the dark mark on the man's arm was completely gone, something that had occurred when the dark lord had died completely. Harry looked at the eyes of the professor, and saw them glittering with excitement, but was heavily schooled on the rest of his face.</span></p><p>
  <span>       Harry couldn't take his eyes off the man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Thank you, Minerva, for being patient with me-” the potions master looked up, and his face immediately dropped. “Oh. Have you come to report that my book has mysteriously been destroyed by Mount St. Helens?” Harry snorted, and shook his head, setting the book on a safe portion of the table. “Did you grow bored like I imagine you did?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Harry looked back down and he shrunk into himself. “I actually finished it sir. And I wanted to discuss it with you. Some of your thoughts were good, but I have a few contending thoughts.” Harry’s voice grew quieter as he spoke, watching the man grow even more irritated, especially when he said ‘contending thoughts’. “I'll let myself out sir.” He backed from the table shyly, disappointment settling in his chest at the inability to have a conversation about the potions mentioned with someone willing to speak of them. He shut the door behind himself, and wandered to his bedroom provided by the staff for the summer, wishing he could have at least asked what it was he was making before leaving in silence.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>       He picked up the letters his new owl, Hooters, had left on his desk. He tapped a floating ball with his fingertip and it emanated light over the table top. He took off his glasses, and tore open the first letter from The Niffler, a new paper created after the war. They were asking for him to write his reply to questions they had for him, and like always, they were practically the same as every other one. In his reply, he wrote what he always wrote. While it was all completely true, and completely in good faith, he wrote the same reply word for word for nearly every interview he got via mail. He wrote something, but it was written to be purposefully boring. It made the paper lose interest quickly, he had learned, and they stopped writing about him very quickly. It made his life easier. He did the same for the rest of the interviews, and when he got to the bottom of the pile he found a package from Mrs Weasley, no doubt another box of homemade treacle tart. He opened it, and replied lovingly to the letters included from her, Ron, Ginny, and Hermione. He took a bite of his treacle and sealed his parchments. He put them together and gave them to Hooters, giving her a treat before she nipped at his fingers sweetly and flew off. He picked up his most recent book from his mail purchase, a book of advanced charms. It wasn't a cheap book, but it had been a relatively world renowned book, so he wanted to give it a try. He read the first few pages, getting bored quickly of the droning. It was practically the same thing as the other books piled under his desk, so he closed it, and left the room after noxing the light. He wandered the halls, wishing there was something left for him to do with his hands. The only thing left was supposed to be Filches job: restoring paintings. He looked at the slightly worn tapestries, and after asking politely of the subject of the image if he could touch the painting, he gently touched the canvas, pulled out his wand, and gently re-wove the fraying edges with careful mending spells, paying close attention to the pattern, making sure the color didn’t get damaged. He carefully reversed the color back to as close as he could get it to the original. He looked at it and smiled. It was vibrant, and the knight standing proudly thanked Harry. He nodded, and moved to the next painting to repeat the process, until he felt a soft tingling presence from behind him once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Hello professor Snape,” he spoke softly, trying not to wake the other paintings, but not losing his focus. It was silent for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Potter, what were those infernal yellow papers that littered my book that were not there when I lent it to you.” The man was quiet, and Harry didn't turn as he explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Those were a muggle invention called ‘post-it notes’. They have a temporary glue so you can take them off without damaging the paper. I figured you wouldn't appreciate it if I wrote notes of my own in your personal possession. Some part of me knew you wouldn't listen when I asked if we could discuss, especially since I disagree with you - a master of potions. I also figured you wouldn't trust me when I said I don't destroy my things, let alone other people's things, so I put them there, knowing you would look through the book for damage, and see them. It was the only way to get my thoughts across, accepted or not, so I did that.” By the time he finished speaking, he’d moved to the next painting. This one had sustained severe damage, so Harry took it down carefully, and turned around. The man, he knew, was right behind him, so he looked straight into the near-black eyes of the professor, and the man's eyes widened ever so slightly, his breath hitching. Harry realized then why.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Potter, where are your glasses.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Harry looked away, and shrugged slightly, and sat down to begin weaving the rip down the middle back together seamlessly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Lost them.” It was a hopeless lie, he knew that, but it was better than saying ‘I performed a sight-correcting spell’ for several reasons :1) He didn’t know how to do that, 2) he was also not a medic so it would be illegal to perform such a spell, and 3) he would be forced to go to Madam Pomfrey, who would find out about his predicament of his magic core’s growth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “So, even though you are legally blind, you are making an attempt to fix the home of a subject of a painting? And you are doing it successfully without a single hitch? Did it also not occur to you that you could also perform an accio to find them?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Harry stilled his movements only briefly in stunned silence, hoping the man wasn't catching on, but knowing the man saw the cease in movement, no matter how little it was. Harry shrugged, and continued to weave, making a show of squinting and getting closer to the painting as though he was having a hard time seeing. Harry just wanted the conversation to end, feeling tense. He squashed the feeling down, and thought of the sound of a gentle rolling boil in potions, thought of the ocean by Bill and Fleur's house, thought of the wind while on a broom, and he calmed down, a small smile gracing his lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “What are you smiling at, Potter?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Harry figured now would be as good a time as ever to change the subject.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Just wondering if you ever sleep sir. You look dead on your feet.” The man sighed and to Harry’s amazement, he sat beside the boy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “With all the potions needed for the medical wing here, I practically am. I'm surprised you aren't, with the physical labor of building this school brick by brick and using your magic so intricately all the time on tedious things like hand repairing a bloody chandelier.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Harry snorted in surprise. He hadn't expected the teacher to actually respond to the quip, or to fall for the subject change. Nor had he expected the man to make a joke of his own toward Harry, especially with it being in good faith that it wouldn't be taken as an insult. “Honestly, if I’m to be serious, I like the idea of my work being put into it, and the thought that well after I am gone, every brick I lay will be there for millennia after. It sounds weird I know, but it means something to me, and I don’t know how to justify it other than that.” Severus went quiet, nodding, watching the boy fix the painting before he spoke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Why do you do that?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Harry stopped short, wondering what he did “Do what sir?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Fix things by hand rather than magic.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>        “I suppose it allows me to think. I have a lot on my mind, and because I was raised muggle it feels more natural to do it by hand. With monotony, I don't actually have to think about what I'm doing. It lets me compartmentalize my thoughts and rethink answers for interviews and stuff.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “You're still getting letters from papers and requests for interviews this long after the war?” The man asked, a hint of distaste coloring his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Harry sneered at the thought of the letters. “I got 17 of them today alone, 6 an hour ago, the rest this morning. I bloody hate them! The Daily Prophets ‘wonderful Miss Rita Skeeter’ has so many questions for me about being an auror, and the six kids I apparently have with Ginny Weasley, whom I divorced a month ago to everyone’s absolute horror.” Harry spoke with a slight side of salt to his voice as he recalled every letter he got about the false rumors of his personal life. He hadn't been with Ginny in nearly two years; in fact, she was with Luna now. And he was also still a virgin. “She also has the balls to call me Harold, which isn't my real name, as she asks me which position I favor during ‘sexy times’.” Harry spat out that last piece without meaning to, turning a maroon as he got shushed by sleeping paintings, and realized he was still talking to a professor. He turned back to the painting, hoping he wouldn't hear anything about it. But then he heard something he wouldn't thought about hearing in his life. The man next to him actually laughed, not a scoff or a snort, a laugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Oh bloody hell. So how are your six kids, Potter? I'm assuming already flying around in their cribs?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       Harry was completely stunned at the joke, but played along. “They’re naturals, I say they get it from me, but Ginerva claims it's all from her. That was the reason we filed for the tragic divorce.” They both laughed for a short time, and fell silent, the only sound being the soft clicking of stitches getting pulled taut back into place. It was an uncomfortable silence as they both realized they had talked with each other as if they were best mates for the past 11 or so years, not a professor and student that despised each other. The banter had felt as natural as breathing, but now they were bolt straight, realizing that they were supposed to hate each other. Harry put the last stitch together, working quickly to put the colors back to normal and cast a preserving charm on it before hanging it back up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “I'd better get-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “I’d best take my lea-” they interrupted each other, stumbling over their words with stutters, awkwardness, and no eye contact. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “I um…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “Yeah…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “See you in the morning professor.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       “You too Potter.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>       And with that they both gratefully scurried away from each other in opposite directions, Harry mortifyingly missing a step on his way up and stumbling quickly out of sight to cover his bright red face that was a real show of his embarrassment. He pulled himself together and walked stiffly and rather quickly back to his bedroom, shutting and locking the door manually. Locking spells were not allowed on dorm doors so he settled for just the lock. He fell into his bed face first, groaning out of mortification as he rethought the situation and put himself in Snape's shoes, who probably now thought Potter was a complete dolt. He pulled the blanket over his head, stripped to his boxers, and hoped the morning would not be too awkward between them.</span>
