  <i>Arithmancy. 12 November, 1995.</i>
</p>
<p>I’m bored. My desk is covered with graffiti written by Gryffindors. I hate Gryffindors. Potter’s hair looks dreadful today.</p>
<p>
  <b>Ode on a Classroom Table</b>
</p>
<p>Thou lustrous bride of cursive script,<br/>Thou child of a poised, quivering quill<br/>Carved historian, who canst thus express<br/>A memory more sweetly than your etchings:<br/>What tales of boredom and brilliance haunt thy curves,<br/>Of wizards or Muggles, or of both,<br/>In Salazar’s great presence did you once dwell?<br/>What words are these? What brutish honesties?<br/>What figurative fancies? What struggle with staying awake?<br/>What glorious secrets? What unbidden desire?</p>
<p>
  <i>Potter woz ere ‘94</i>
</p>
<p>He probably used a compass instead of a quill. I plan to report him as soon as I get my Prefect’s badge for defiling school property.</p>

  <b>Sonnet 5879</b>
</p>
<p>Shall I compare thee to a bedraggled kneazle? <br/>Thou art more unkempt and more annoying<br/>Your tiresome face reminds me of a <s>fit</s> weasel <br/>And your glasses clearly need replacing<br/>I watch you <s>every day</s> hardly ever and observe<br/>The way you don’t suit burgundy and gold<br/>And I think about the <s>kisses</s> curses you deserve<br/>Because your hero routine is really getting old <br/>I think I’m better at Quidditch than you<br/>Even when you always catch the Snitch <br/>I imagine it’s probably some kind of fluke<br/>At least I’m better at being really rich<br/>Oh Potter! I’d love to tell you how much I despise<br/>The stupid green of your <s>gorgeous</s> <s>striking</s> bulging eyes.</p>
<p>Zabini stole my diary this evening. He asked why I keep writing love poems about Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Love poems???!!!!</p>
<p>Zabini can get fucked.</p>

<p>
  <b>Harry Potter Isn’t Hot</b>
</p>
<p>The first time Potter talked to me<br/>I almost had a fit<br/>The person they all flocked to see<br/>Was just a stupid git<br/>With his ill-fitting clothes and stupid hair<br/>And a scar that made the witches <s>and wizards</s> stare.</p>
<p>They say the lightning bolt is cool<br/>That Potter is quite hot<br/>I say that Potter is a tool<br/>And that he’s definitely not (hot, that is. Bleugh. Potter.)<br/>I don’t know why Zabini insists<br/>That Potter and I should probably kiss.</p>
<p>Oft, when on my bed I lie <br/>In vacant, or in pensive mood<br/>I think of Potter’s owlish eyes<br/>And must try not to brood<br/>On how my heart doth skip a beat<br/>Or the way my body starts to heat.</p>
<p>
  <s>I slide my hand—</s>
</p>
<p>Merlin. I’ve had too much port. This is the worst poem I’ve ever written in my life. </p>
<p>I hope my father never hears about this.</p>
<p>
  <i>Godric’s Hollow. Christmas Day, Years Later</i>
</p>
<p>Zabini told Potter that I used to write poetry about him after too many mulled wines at the Ministry Yule Ball. I’m going to KILL HIM. Of course, Potter decided to dig out my diaries because he’s a nosy fucker and just loves the thought of having poems written about him. As if he doesn’t already take up enough space in the <i>Prophet</i> or win every award they can think of giving him. </p>
<p>You want a poem, Potter? If you can stop laughing for long enough here’s a poem for you. I don’t know why I ever agreed to live with you.</p>
<p>
  <b>Potter is a Nosy Fuck</b>
</p>
<p>Keep your beaky nose out of my diaries.<br/>You annoying prick.</p>
<p>It’s freeform. Merry fucking Christmas.</p></div>
