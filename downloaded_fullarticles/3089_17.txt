    <p>“Leave me alone!” He stormed out of the room, slamming the door and knocking a photo off the wall. <em>Shit.<em> He’d have to fix that later.</em></em></p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
“What do you think gives you the right to walk out of here?” The door smacked against the wall, knocking a mirror off this time. <em>Seven years bad luck. Shit.<em> Still, she’d fix it later, right now she had bigger issues.</em></em></em>

      <em>
“Free will! A mind of my own! My right to peace and quiet!”</em>

There wasn’t very much space in their little flat, and he was running out of room to retreat. The kitchen had the most direct escape route, and that’s where he chose to make his stand. If she left him alone he’d be able to make himself a cup of tea to settle his nerves.</em>

“Like hell! You wake up screaming and I’m supposed to let you storm out here while I go back to sleep? Did you <em>honestly<em> think for one second that that would happen?” Her red hair flipped around the corner, and he had the vague impression that her arms were crossed, but without his glasses he couldn’t see much. He wished he had grabbed them before he left the room; his argument was never strengthened by his tendency to look slightly to the left of people when his vision was impaired.</em></em></em>

“I had hoped. I thought that maybe I’d be allowed one <em>moment<em> by myself to process, to recover, to do whatever I needed to do, but <em>no<em>, you have to <em>fix<em> me!”</em></em></em></em></em></em></em>

“Well I certainly can’t leave you alone for long; you can’t even remember your glasses these days, you’re so scattered, I mean, really, Harry!” He saw her vague shape approaching and backed into the countertop. Still, she kept getting closer, and he was on the verge of leaping out of the way when he saw the fuzzy black frames in her hand. She shoved them in his hand and stood there, just short of uncomfortably close, until he could see properly, when she moved a bit farther from him.</em>

“Cut me a break, Gin, you just don’t get it. You’ve got the job of your dreams and I’ve got whatever the hell I’m doing and I just don’t know, you don’t get how hard that is!”</em>
    </em>

“That’s a terrible excuse! You think I don’t know what it’s like to be uncertain if what I’m choosing is the right path? I’m a reserve on a professional Quidditch team, that’s a much more uncertain position than you’re in. You’re a shoo-in for an Auror position, and everyone knows it. But that’s not why I’m not letting you alone. We both know the nightmares are getting worse but you still haven’t told me a damn thing about them, and that stops now. Do you hear me? Now.” Her brown eyes were burning in her pale face, a lighter shade than he had ever seen them, as though they were trying to achieve an orange the same as her hair.</em>

“I can’t. I just can’t. They’re not getting worse, just more frequent, but I can handle them. I’ve always been able to handle them.” Still, he didn’t see what she saw. She saw a scared boy of twenty years, his pale face offset by the deep bruises under his eyes, hair even more rumpled than usual from the tossing and turning, glasses lopsided on his nose. Green eyes begging for some peace. From her, from life, from the dreams haunting both his sleeping and waking hours. There was no way he could handle these.</em>

“You absolutely <em>cannot<em> handle them, and you’re kidding yourself if you truly think you can. I can see it in your eyes.” Those same eyes were now pleading her to stop, to halt the interrogation (because that was how it felt), to just <em>let him be.<em> “Harry, we are in this together. We lived through this together. We both saw terrible, awful things, and we’re still just trying to put our lives back together, so if you could just tell me what’s going on…”</em></em></em></em></em>

“You have no IDEA what I lived through! I lived through death, Ginny! I died! How the HELL do you want to fix that?”</em>

“Maybe you’re too caught up in yourself at the moment, but when I was eleven I was nearly killed! Or had you forgotten that you saved my life? Was that moment not very important to you? Merlin, Harry, you’d think that you’d actually consider who I am before you complet-”</em>

“You <em>nearly<em> died! I really did! There’s a difference!” She was too close again, not registering that, in her anger, she was pushing him farther away.</em></em></em>

“What, do you imagine,” she hissed, her voice low and dangerous, so that he had to strain to hear it after her shouting, “that my soul and energy being drained into another person felt like? Did you think it was pleasant? Like stress being drained away by a long bath? Or slipping into a deep sleep? Because, Harry dear, I can <em>assure<em> you it did not. It felt like my fingernails were being removed, one by one, with a pair of pliers. And then my teeth. And then like every bone in my body was being snapped. And then like I was slowly being drenched in gasoline, and the fumes were making my head spin, and then - then I was set on fire, and left to burn to bits, until my very mind was charred into ash. I bet you thought I was lying there asleep, or comatose, or something similar, but I was lying there in sheer pain. Do you think that I didn’t dream about that for years? I <em>still<em> do, even now, even after all this time. Don’t tell me I don’t know death, Harry Potter, because I do.”</em></em></em></em></em>

He was afraid of her now, of this woman with eyes and hair of fire, with words to match. She had lived through that silently, and he had never known. How could he even compare his death with hers? His had been easy, virtually painless until after, and he dared to scream, to complain? And she stood there, waiting, arms at her sides, anger stitched into every inch of her frame, her posture aggressive and intimidating. And he was truly afraid of this woman that he thought he knew, afraid of what she was capable of.</em>

“I’m sorry,” he murmured, and looked at her for one second longer, before he spun on the spot, becoming immaterial as she watched. She lunged, trying to grab the hem of his shirt, his hand, anything, but he was gone. <em>Shit.</em></em>
