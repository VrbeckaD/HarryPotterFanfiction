    <p>The moment Hermione opened her eyes she knew it was going to be a long day. Like every Saturday her schedule was full. It wasn't necessary a bad thing. Usually she was waking up with a smile on her lips in anticipation of the day but of late her regularly breakfast meetings with a certain Slytherin was worrying her.</p>
<p>Though he never said it out loud she knew he was wishing for more than just friendship and wasn't hiding it as good as he may thought. But Hermione knew, deep down, it was not love he was feeling but loneliness and the constant fear that he would be left alone.</p>
<p>It broke her heart to see him like that, but she couldn't change the will of her own heart and that was beating for another one.</p>
<p>Unintentionally her eyes landed on a photo of <em>him</em> and she could instantly feel the happiness that spread through her body. It was one of her favourites and the result of a spontaneous snap. It showed both of them near the Quidditch pitch and was taken after the match. He was still wearing his uniform and was all ruffled up from the play. Both of his arms held her protectively around her waist while she was telling him something. She couldn't quite remember what, but it had been funny because he threw his head back to bark out a laugh before he lifted her up and kissed thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Breaking into a brilliant smile after all she pushed the sheets back and swung her legs out of bed to make her way to the shower.</p>
<p>Hermione would meet him later tonight.</p>
<p>For now...she sighed. For now she had to find a way to make it clear to a certain Slytherin that she wasn't the one for him without hurting him or worse giving him the impression she was pitying him. The curly haired witch winced at the thought. He definitely would not take kindly to that.</p>
<p>No, there had to be a way to make him see how much she valued their friendship and that she didn't ever intend to turn her back to him, but that they would never be more.</p>
<p>Yes, she could do that, she nodded to herself with a determined expression while she started to get ready for the day.</p>
<p>Something casual, without looking too sloppy.</p>
<p>Again, the smile found its way to her lips as her eyes glanced over the beautiful silk dress she had brought for tonight. But that was for later.</p>
<p>First breakfast with a friend and then... Well, truth to be told she had no idea how to declare the relationship with her other snake. It was odd at times, even uncomfortable but most of the time she actually enjoyed their shared afternoons. He was sharp-witted and had a surprisingly sensitive side to him. One he didn't show often but it was there and obviously she was the only one he was willing to share it with. Not that he had the opportunity to meet many people these days, though Hermione doubted that he would even if he could.</p>
<p>Her thoughts turned to their last meeting the previous week and their quiet walk through the beautiful garden he planted over the years. He didn't always feel the need to talk to her and she didn't mind. It was not an uncomfortable silence, not anymore.</p>
<p>Hermione had left feeling calm and refreshed. No, she didn't mind their meetings and after today she would not feel uncomfortable with her breakfast partner. She promised herself that everything would be fine and she would end the day with a smile on her face and so would her snakes.</p>
