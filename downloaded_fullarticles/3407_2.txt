    <p>Harry had shared a nervous glance at Ron before entering the Slytherin common room behind Malfoy. The two Gryffindors were currently disguised as Crabbe and Goyle. If Malfoy caught a hint of something wrong, their whole plan was all for ruin. The mood was very awkward for both Gryffindors as they listened as Malfoy ranted. Harry should have expected that Malfoy wasn’t a fan of their Headmaster. But something in his mind clicked and like his anger was ignited. Harry refused to let his emotions show as he slowly clenched and unclenched his fists.</p><p>“I’m not surprised that Dumbledore hasn't tried to stop all these attacks. Probably make him look good if managed to stop them when the Prophet finds out,” Malfoy droned. “Father always did say he was the worst thing to happen to this school.”</p><p>That seemed to be Harry limit, a person insulting the person that seemed to provide a way to escape the Dursleys’. “You’re wrong!”</p><p>Malfoy reaction was instant as Ron didn't do a thing. Eyes narrowed at fake Goyle as his lips curled in a sneer, “What!? You think there’s someone worse than Dumbledore?”</p><p>Harry instantly regretted his outburst, as it may just cost them any vital information. “Harry Potter,” he managed to quip as he regained his thoughts.</p><p>Malfoy let out a small hmmp, as his features relaxed. “You’re absolutely right, Goyle. Saint Potter.” The blonde bit out Potter like it was vile on his tongue. “Yet how anyone is to believe that he is the Heir of Slytherin is beyond me.”</p><p>Harry and Ron shared a bewildered look, Malfoy was not the Heir, yet everyone believed it was Harry.</p><p>Harry could almost step back if he wasn’t sitting on one of the Slytherin’s couches at Malfoy calculated glance.</p><p>“Suspicious, one would expect Potter to least have some knowledge of his heritage. It’s insulting to the wizard name not to count a disgrace.” Malfoy had looked like the thought itself was repulsing. “Not surprising if what they say is true, being raised by filthy muggles. Especially if your magical guardian is Dumbledore.”</p><p>Harry knew he had to be gapping at Malfoy’s words. Was it common knowledge to know of his living conditions in the wizarding world? What else did everyone know about him that he had no knowledge to? The young Potter chanced a glance at his friend, who didn’t look like the information was surprising. Harry’s heart sunk at the thought Ron knowing who is responsible for him in the Wizarding World.</p><p>Malfoy started to smirk, “I can just imagine the look on Potter’s face when he finds out his godfather is in Azkaban, something that Dumbledore personally approved of. That the Gryffindors’ hero isn’t as perfect as he portrays. Muggle lovers all of them,” Malfoy glared as he spat his words.</p><p>Harry almost felt he was hit by a train, ‘did that mean if his godfather wasn’t in… Azkaban… was it, that he would have taken care of him instead of the Dursleys? The young Gryffindor was curious if Malfoy only knew all of this because of the position his father had. Harry went to look back at Ron to see if he was shocked as Harry was. It was like Ron was emotionless about the whole ordeal, while it was shaking the Potter’s entire world about everything he knew. He knew that Ron wasn’t faking it as there was no way an eleven-year-old could have pulled that off. The young Potter knew he couldn’t question the youngest Weasley about any of this upcoming knowledge either. Harry’s heart began to sink, ‘what if Ron only pretended to be my friend because of all this fame?’ The raven haired didn’t want to think of the possibility, where Ron was the first friend he made. It was once Malfoy was distracted by the small green wrapped gift that the boys made a break for it. Malfoy caught the movement but they were already out the common room for the Snakes.</p><p>The young Potter’s mind was in overdrive, he couldn’t handle all this new knowledge. Harry needed a breather away from everything. The young Gryffindor felt a bit guilty when he informed Ron he needed to explain everything to Hermione. His excuse was that he was feeling ill, maybe a side effect of the Polyjuice potion. Ron didn’t look to happy at the prospect of informing Hermione himself but took Harry’s word for it.</p><p>The young Gryffindor made straight for his own dormitory. Harry’s sanctuary in the library was too risky at this time of night, despite that the room was hidden from all eyes. The Potter heir could finally focus on his thoughts about Malfoy’s words. ‘Heritage? What heritage?’ Harry knew that his vault had a lot of gold but even then, that wasn’t very much and he had to make it last for his whole seven years of school. The Gryffindor didn’t have any knowledge about his family except for a few things he’d been told over the past year. He looked exactly as his father and his mother was very talented at Charms. Harry gulped at the thought of having to ask someone about his heritage, mainly because of the fact it was likely to be someone in Slytherin. The Gryffindor knew it had to be a pureblood and Slytherin was the best option. Gryffindor was not an option, even though he knew there had to be purebloods never meant they knew or followed the traditions that Malfoy was so vague about. Hufflepuffs were probably the same as Gryffindor, while Ravenclaws would be more concerned about their studies and most of them had to be half-bloods. Harry had almost shaken his head at his own thoughts, they made him sound prejudice about the subject. As the Gryffindor hadn’t trusted any of the books in the library about traditions in the past. Harry didn’t know many of the Slytherins and would never ask Malfoy a single thing as he made it clear what he thought about if ‘Potter’ dared to ask him about the Wizarding World. Harry began having a sour feeling in his throat, what if the other Slytherins’ were a replica of Malfoy. The young Potter almost cringed at the image of having to instigate a conversation with his rival house. Harry’s name was already famous not to include the rumor of the twelve-year old being the Heir of Slytherin. It was during this moment that Harry has wished his parents were still alive, maybe this wouldn’t all be happening in the first place. It wasn’t the first time the small Gryffindor imaged himself without the Dursleys. A sudden thought occurred to him, ‘what if there are Slytherins in his year that prefer to remain in the background like Harry always wanted to?’ An endless hope flared up, ‘what if learning about his heritage could save him from the Dursleys forever.’ Harry tried to squash the thought down, the headmaster had already said there wasn’t a way to get away from his family. Yet Harry was starting to doubt Professor Dumbledore, ‘what if Malfoy was right about him? Did that mean the Headmaster was holding information from him?’</p><p>Harry wanted to growl in annoyance, ‘why did it seem like this was always happening to him?’ The thinking was doing no good but further riling the Gryffindor. His way was blocked either way, determining the Heir of Slytherin, finding information about himself, and a way to escape his relatives. Harry had almost wanted to claw out his hair, why did it have to seem so hard to get some truth. A heavy sigh was released, ‘I’ll need to look at the library and see what they have about Purebloods and traditions. And maybe try to find out what Azkaban is?’ Harry thought solemnly before lying down to sleep. Making the idea of speaking to Slytherin for another day to worry.</p>
