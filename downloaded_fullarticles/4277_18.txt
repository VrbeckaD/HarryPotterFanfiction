    <p>Chapter 1 - The Clouds Pile Up at the Horizon.</p>
<p>Lily Evans looked up to the sky as she, accompanied by her parents, made her way towards the King's Cross station. Her brown wool coat swayed as a breeze swept the street, carrying dust and the first fallen leaves of the autumn. She looked up to the sky — it bore a dark grey hue. A storm was coming. The clouds crammed up in a thousand shades of grey, the air was electric and the wind was picking up. She felt a knot in her stomach. She swallowed the gulp that was forming in her throat and followed her parents to the King's Cross station.</p>
<p>"Well, that's me then," she said faking up cheeriness as she turned to face her parents in front of the brick wall at Platform 9 3/4. A sense of dread grasped her. She had tried to brush off the feeling of paranoia the entire trip to London, but her it all came to nought. For some reason, she felt as if this parting with her parents was of more significance than in recent years. Like she wasn't going to see them again.</p>
<p>"Send us a letter once you've gotten settled in — won't you?" her mother said briskly. She stood tall beside her husband in a heavy, grey wool coat, her grey, grizzly, auburn hair woven in a tight braided knot at the back of her head. "Goodbye love, take good care of yourself."</p>
<p>They hugged. Lily wrapped her arms around her shorter mothers shoulders and squeezed tight. The lump in her throat wasn't getting any smaller. She cared so much for her parents. As a matter of a fact, she was scared for them. The little news she'd received in Cokeworth of strange accidents happening to Muggles and Muggle born wizards was enough to raise the hairs on the back of her neck. </p>
<p>"Bye dad," she said as she hugged her father as well. His thinning red hair was messy after the breeze outside.</p>
<p>"Goodbye sweetheart," he said warmly.</p>
<p>Lily blinked away the tears that were gathering in the corners of her eyes, sucked in a breath and turned to face the sturdy wall who hid the ruby red train that would lead her to the Hogsmeade station. She drew in a deep breath and headed for the wall. From outside, she could hear the rolling of thunder and crackling lightning as she left the Muggle world and entered the wizarding one.</p>
<p>It was a couple weeks later and the professors had wasted no time in drowning the fifth years in a heavy workload. The first week had all gone under serious speeches about the importance of hard work and discipline since they had their O.W.Ls in June. Butterflies swarmed in Lily's stomach as she listened intently to the serious speeches. Studying had never been a problem for her. Partly because she was absolutely in love with the wizarding world. Even now, five years after the fateful letter had arrived at her home. Ever since those warm summer days, all those years ago, when she and Severus had spent long days in their secret meadow in Cokeworth. Those bright days of her youth had passed quickly as she filled the spaces of silence with relentless questions directed towards Severus.</p>
<p>Lily had also always been a hard working student in order to prove her worth in the wizarding world. She knew that she stood on an equal ground with the rest of her classmates, she was no less worth the kids that came from 'pure blooded' wizarding families. But deep down there was an insecurity, a nagging little demon, that whispered into her ear that she was a fake, she had no right to be here at Hogwarts. She descended from muggles, she was a... Even the word was so painful and filled with shame that she couldn't even think about it. </p>
<p>So Lily Evans studied, she was at the top of her classes, she was the first to the library in the morning and the last one to leave in the evening, she raised her hand in classes, she always put her most effort into her studies. Partly she did it because of the pure fascination of the world, but also to prove a point. She had the right to take space. She could exist in this world. She was not a waste of space. She was a witch - a true witch.</p>
<p>But the fact remained that she had to fight for her right. Because despite her wonderful classmates who couldn't care less about her non-wizard heritage, there were a few students in school who weren't as open-minded. She'd been hexed in the hallways, nothing too serious, but hexes nonetheless. She'd been called slurs, never directly, she couldn't even point a finger at one certain culprit. But there was just the atmosphere, silently spoken words of hatred and prejudice and fear, and a few hateful stares in front of classrooms and in the hallways. And for some unwordable reason, she had a feeling of dread at the bottom of her stomach. It was a peculiar feeling mixed with the butterflies of excitement over being back at school and having challenging exams and assignments to work towards. </p>
<p>She remembered looking up at the sky while driving to London on September 1st with her parents. She remembered how she had looked at the horizon and seeing the sky darken as the clouds there piled up on one another, squashed and pushing against each other, heavy with rain and promise of darker days. She couldn't pin point the feeling closer than that. </p>
<p>It was like looking at a lopsided reality. Everything that came to her eyes' notice was the same as always but it was like looking through a filter that shone a new light on reality, giving it a strange hue. There was simply something wrong. There was some charge in the air. She had felt it in front of the Kings Cross train station as she watched the dried up leaves whirling through the street with the dust of the pavement. It was as if the breeze was warning her. There is something coming, and it's coming for you. Keep your head high and stay safe.</p>
<p>She must be getting mad.</p>
<p>These were her thoughts on a Thursday night. She was sitting in the far corner of the library close to the restricted section, it was a bit more reserved area. One couldn't quite say it was quieter than other parts of the library, for Madame Pince made sure that there was no excess of sound in her realm. </p>
<p>Lily gently stroke the soft end of her quill along her lower lip as she pondered over her thoughts. Her books and a couple of scrolls of parchment were scattered on the table in front of her. She always bore more books in her bag than she needed and her loan list from the library was alarmingly long in the second week of the term. Lily Evans would not half-ass any assignment that came before her. But still, despite her resolve on tackling the studies with brilliance, her mind was far, far away that night, her potions essay in front of her as good as forgotten.</p>
<p>Beside her sat her oldest friend and the first person she knew from the wizarding world. He was hunched over his own essay, his shoulder length jet black hair covered his face on both sides like two curtains, a shelter from the cruel visage of the world and enveloped him in the world of his transfiguration essay. He was scribbling away in a tight, crooked and little script, quill flying relentlessly across the parchment.</p>
<p>"Sev?" she asked in an absentminded tone. He mumbled something unintelligible in response, the quick, squeaky sounds of his quill never ceasing. "Have you noticed... any changes this year?"</p>
<p>He still didn't look up. "Even more irritable teachers?"</p>
<p>She seemed abruptly dragged out of her out of her daydreams at the response. Blinking a couple of times, she looked over to him, voice quiet. "No, I don't mean... as in the teaching."</p>
<p>At this, her friend looked up from his essay at her. His dark eyes expressed closeness and a great deal of care for the person beside him, showing mild interest and patience. His dark brows were slightly furrowed as he said: "What do you mean then?"</p>
<p>She huffed and looked a bit anguished up in the air at nothing in particular, she bit her lip and drew her eyebrows together. "It's just... this sounds so silly, but... there's something in the... air." She paused looking over at her quiet friend, who waited for her to elaborate. "Like... how some of the older students talk, the teachers seem even more on edge now, <em>more</em> than because of the tests, you know," she interjected quickly as she saw Severus starting to make a counter argument that that was probably because of the O.W.Ls now that they were in their fifth year. "Can't you feel it, Sev? And the news, the <em>news</em>! All those accidents and missing people. It ain't normal - it ain't right. It's like the air's charged with some... tension, like something is about to happen, like the lagoon's filling up faster and faster until the dam won't hold anymore and it'll burst." She had spoken so quickly she needed to regain her breath.</p>
<p>She looked in her friend's dark eyes. Hers flooded with feelings and anxiety. He took her rant all in stride as he pondered patiently over a response that he could give her.</p>
<p>"There are... definitely some changes," he said at last, choosing his words carefully. "But I don't think you need to worry too much about it."</p>
<p>A bit irritated at this curt response, Lily's worries didn't subside even a bit.</p>
<p>"And besides," Severus continued, with a little smile at the corners of his lips. "You still got that potions essay to worry about, less you want to fall out of the <em>slug club</em>."</p>
<p>He said the words with such attitude that Lily couldn't help but facing him, a smile tugging at her lips as well. It only widened as Severus mimicked the way Slughorn used to walk between the cauldrons of his students and ponder over the progress. "Oh, marvellous job Lily dear, just splendid. Oh, this love potion captures just right the aromas of crystallised pineapple, walrus pelts and arrogant social climbers from various parts of society that I used to teach and now benefit from knowing, quite splendid, yes, indeed!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Sev!" Lily scolded him as she punched his shoulder with her potions book. Despite the scolding, she couldn't hold her laughter. They looked from under each other's eyes at each other laughing quietly. Just then Madame Pinch rounded the corner, giving them a stiff look and shushing them. They immediately shut their mouths and poured once again over their essays. it wasn't long though until they both snorted again, trying to subdue their laughter as they looked sneakily at each other. Nothing but subdues smiles and witty glints in eyes.</p>
<p>Lily faced her essay but took a quick mischievous look at Severus. "Say Sev, what exactly is the role of Ashwinder eggs in the careful creation of <em>Felix Felicis</em>, oh you wise potion master."</p>
<p>He grinned back at her and explained the subject of the essay for her.</p>
