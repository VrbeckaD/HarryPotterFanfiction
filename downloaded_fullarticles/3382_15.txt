    <p>Finnigan, Potter, Weasley, maybe it is true bad luck comes in threes, three prats.<br/>
“Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, he walks into mine.”<br/>
Finnigan grinned “Milly! What the fuck you know about Casblanca?”<br/>
Weasley found his voice, “Who cares about Casa whatever, what the bloody hell are you doing in a muggle bar Bulstrode?”<br/>
I ignored him, it's easy, I figure his mother had to have been doing that his whole life, unlucky twat.<br/>
“What are you doing in my bar you Irish bastard?”<br/>
He laughed, “Milly I said I was sorry, give a bloke a chance.”<br/>
“I'd sooner give you an avada, you set my bar top on fire you minging cunt!”<br/>
Potter looked from him to me and back.<br/>
“This is your friend with a bar? Are you trying to get me poisoned?”<br/>
“Weasley doesn't seem to be scared, the bloody gannet is inhaling my snacks.” The pillock had the grace to blush, and order a larger, allowing Seamus to start on him<br/>
“Real men drink Guinness Ron.”<br/>
“Shite's too bitter.”<br/>
Potter stood away from the bar looking unsure, I should take pity on him he's the saviour and all that tripe, “What are you drinking?”<br/>
He stared at me, Seamus reached and yanked him forward by his collar, “Harry's having a whiskey, infact I'll have a bottle of your Ile special.”<br/>
I looked the three of them over, making sure to meet their eyes.<br/>
“If you three set anything on fire I'll send the goblins after you for damages. Understood.”<br/>
Weasley gulped his drink, Seamus grinned, Potter continued to stare.</p><p>Two hours later Finnigan was singing, and flinging insults with the regulars watching cricket. Weasley was passed out after eating bangers and mash and a pork pie, then stuffing his gullet with whiskey.<br/>
Potter like a lonely boy was sitting at the bar using all of his auror prowess on me to figure out why I didn't hate him.<br/>
“Why didn't we know you were a half bloody Milly?”<br/>
“Don't call me that.”<br/>
He looked hurt, “Seamus calls you that.”<br/>
“Seamus also shared my bed once, it's a bad habit to murder someone after you've fucked them.”<br/>
Potter blushed, “Oh! I didn't realize you and Seamus.”<br/>
“How are you an auror? We fucked once, what in my not killing him screams love and togetherness?”<br/>
“Oh.”<br/>
His eyes crept to my neckline not for the first time since he'd slid up to the bar, this time they stayed just a tad longer.<br/>
Oh. Oh shite! I'm a pillock! He's trying to chat me up.<br/>
I look at him them, really looked at him. He's still short, but he's got muscle in all the right places, and a sureness about himself that says he has nothing to prove, plus he is the savior of the wizarding world.  Why not, I'm single.<br/>
As his eyes lift he realizes I've been watching him, and blushes like a third year getting their first kiss. There's an innocence about Potter, I wonder how many women he's been with, and decide to add my name to that list<br/>
I smile and he smiles back, fuck it, grab his collar and pull him forward, his lips taste like smoke, fire whiskey, peat, and salt. I release him, and he reaches for me, I let him kiss me, it's soft and sweet, his tongue nudging mine for dominance.<br/>
Bad luck comes in threes, maybe not always.</p>
