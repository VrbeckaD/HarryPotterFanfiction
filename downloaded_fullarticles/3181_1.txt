    <p>Draco walked through Diagon Alley, for the first time in 2 years. He was under house arrest and he was finally a free man. He walked gracefully as he always did, ignoring the looks he was getting.<br/>
“Draco” Luna said as she appeared in front of him<br/>
“Luna” Draco said startled<br/>
“It’s good to see you out again”<br/>
“Well I was going stir crazy in the house”<br/>
“I thought your house arrest was finally over”<br/>
“It is”<br/>
“Then you should join me for dinner”<br/>
“Aren’t you dating Potter?”<br/>
“I am, we’re having a party tonight. You should come”<br/>
“I’ll have to decline”<br/>
“Why? You have nowhere to be. Most of your pureblood friends are either in Azkaban or fled. We have cake”<br/>
Draco was never used to her bluntness, even at school. He really didn’t want to spend any time with her.<br/>
“I’ve spent the past 2 years trapped in a house. I don’t want to be in another one”<br/>
“But you had me trapped in your house before”<br/>
Draco’s eyes widened at her words.<br/>
“I was there with Mr Ollivander, who was very nice to me, after the Deatheaters kidnapped me and snapped my wand. He was very nice and made me a new one”<br/>
“Luna-”<br/>
“I shall expect you by 7. It’s 12 Grimmauld Place. You know the address, the floo will be open to you. Don’t worry about bringing anything.”<br/>
“But-”<br/>
“It’s rude to decline an invitation from a lady, plus I’m sure you would want to put me at ease after all that time I spent in your house”<br/>
Draco was unable to form a response. She had guilted him and she knew it. He always felt bad about how Luna was treated in his house, how he was powerless to help her.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Draco walked through the Floo and saw there was a festive party of sorts with people he didn’t know. Luna greeted him and placed a glass of wine in his hands.<br/>
“I knew you would show. It would be rude to be late” Luna said<br/>
“Thank you Luna” Draco said<br/>
“This is some wine that Hermione brought back from her trip. It’s muggle wine, but don’t worry, it has no nargles in it”<br/>
Draco looked at the glass and sniffed it.<br/>
“Don’t worry, muggle germs won’t get you sick Malfoy” Hermione said<br/>
“Granger, still bushy haired” Draco said taking a sip<br/>
“Malfoy, how’s freedom treating you?”</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Draco relaxed a bit, drank more wine, ate a few bites, and generally had a good time. He felt a buzz and chatted freely. Towards the end of the night as people started leaving, he found himself looking at the Black Family tapestry on the wall. He looked and saw himself, still drawn as a child for some reason. He crouched down to the ground to take a closer look. He reached to touch it but stopped. He wondered why it hadn’t changed.<br/>
“Sirius gave the house and everything to Harry. When he did that, the magic stopped in the tapestry” Hermione said<br/>
“Potter can’t figure it out?” Draco said<br/>
“It’s not his family, so he can’t tell it to update, but you can” Hermione said<br/>
Hermione sat down on the floor next to him. She set her wine glass down and grabbed his hand and pushed it onto the tapestry. It glowed where his hand was and then the branches and leaves started growing and Draco’s face aged. He looked and saw Tonks appear, and then Teddy.<br/>
Draco looked over at Hermione. It felt familiar, as if he had done this before. Strange. His mind felt fuzzy as if there was something he was trying to remember. Hermione pulled her hand away and stood up. Draco got up as well and saw Sirius’s face was still burned off. He touched it and the tapestry repaired itself, showing Sirius's face.<br/>
“I should go” Hermione said walking away<br/>
“Wait” Draco said chasing after her<br/>
“Have an early morning. I think Luna disappeared with Harry already” Hermione said<br/>
“There’s still some of your wine left, we should finish it, not let it go to waste” Draco said<br/>
“Alright, one for the road” Hermione said<br/>
Draco poured them both glasses and handed it to her. His fingers brushed against hers and something in his mind sparked for a second. He couldn’t grab onto what it was trying to tell him.<br/>
Hermione drank her wine and smiled at him.<br/>
“It’s good to see you again. I hope things weren’t too hard for you” Hermione said<br/>
“I was trapped in a house, the same house I was trapped in with a mad man. I’m just glad to be out of there”<br/>
“What will you do now?”<br/>
“Not sure, probably travel and get out of here. Not like anyone would miss me. Blaise is still in Italy, maybe I’ll visit him”<br/>
“I’m sure he would love to see you. Take care Draco”<br/>
Hermione turned and walked into the floo. The green flames engulfed her as she disappeared. Draco finished his wine and walked into the floo.</p>
<hr/><p>Luna walked into the room with the black family tapestry in it. She saw that Draco updated the tree, and next to his older picture was a ribbon with another name on it. It was Hermione’s name. And then a branch sprouted from them.<br/>
Harry appeared behind Luna, wrapping his arms around her.<br/>
“He fixed it” Harry said<br/>
“He did, and he didn’t” Luna said<br/>
“What do you mean?”<br/>
“He doesn’t know”<br/>
“How can you tell?”<br/>
“Because he doesn’t remember. He doesn’t know they have a child together”<br/>
Luna pointed to the the child portrait that formed from Draco and Hermione. It was blank. Just like his memory.</p>
