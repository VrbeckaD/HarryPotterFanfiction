    <p>Disclaimer: I don't own anything that you recognise.</p><p>Newt Scamander shot his companion a worried look as they walked off the ship. His companion was walking incredibly stiffly, her arms flat at her side. "Ari, are you alright?" He asked taking her hand. Arianna or Ari nodded, sighing and trying to relax a bit. "I'm fine, I just hate being in the city. You know that." She said, giving him a small smile. Newt smiled back at her and squeezed her hand.</p><p>After narrowly passing through customs, Newt started to lead her through the city, although she pulled him into an alleyway and put a glamour spell on herself. Seeing his confused look, she smiled dryly. "Can't have the risk of witches and wizards recognising me." She explained vaguely. Newt raised an eyebrow. "Are you wanted or something?" He asked, really hoping that she wasn't. She shrugged. "People know me at MACUSA. That's all I'm gonna say." She answered, knowing that he wouldn't ask further.</p><p>He had met her after she had been injured in a forest, having been chased by evil wizards. He had patched up her wounds and they had started talking. He had offered to let her stay for a while to rest and heal more and she had simply never left. They had grown closer, with Newt awkwardly asking her out after several weeks. They had stayed in the case, but that had been just fine for them. </p><p>Arianna loved his understanding and acceptance, having been looked upon with disgust by nearly everyone during her entire life. Only her father had loved her for who she was, but people looked down on him for it. Not wanting to be even more of a burden, she had written a note and had fled her home in the middle of the night. She knew that her father had tried to look for her, but she had mastered both glamour spells and invisibility spells, so they had never found her. </p><p>Not wanting to take the risk of her father finding her anyway, she had snuck onboard of a cruiser going to Europe. There, she had travelled through No-Maj towns for at least a year, making sure to stay clear of wizards as much as she could. It had been hard, but she had survived by luck and sheer force of stubbornness. It had been an accident that a couple of wizards had stumbled upon her. She had managed to fight them off, but had been injured in the process, resulting in Newt finding her. </p><p>Back in the present, Newt looked at her in concern, before agreeing and walking out of the alley. They casually walked through New York, although Arianna never lost her stiff posture, trying to avoid people as much as possible. They arrived at a bank where a woman was giving a big speech in front of a crowd. Newt walked closer to listen, but Arianna stayed at the edges, trying not to walk into anybody. </p><p>She stiffened even more and hid at seeing a familiar face: Tina Goldstein. The other woman had not noticed her and Arianna thanked Merlin for that. She hadn't noticed what the woman had been saying, but her attention was pulled, when Newt suddenly ran up the stairs of the bank. She immediately followed him and in the crowd, so did Tina. Arianna quickly caught up with Newt inside the building. "Niffler?" She whispered and he nodded.</p><p>After an encounter with a portly No-Maj, they split up and looked around for the pesky thing. They missed it several times and Arianna having to stop halfway to avoid running into people was not helping matters. They reunited and saw the niffler get on an elevator to the vaults, when the No-Maj from before called to them, holding the occamy egg that Newt apparently had dropped and it was hatching.</p><p>Arianna grabbed Newt's arm and the wizard pulled his wand, summoning the man and apparating to the vaults. It hatched without trouble and both Newt and Arianna beamed at the new born chick, looking like proud parents. They walked down the stairs and if the portly man wasn't so confused and freaked out, he could've sworn that he felt something brush against him, even though neither of them were touching him.</p><p>Putting the new chick in the case, Arianna and Newt quickly noticed the niffler getting into the vault and Newt quickly opened it with magic. One of the bank's employees thought that they were robbing the bank and rang the alarm, before Newt stunned him, much to the portly man's shock. Turning around, Arianna saw that Newt had caught the niffler and was shaking it to let all the precious items fall out.</p><p>Seeing guards come down the stairs, Arianna grabbed Newt's arm again and the No-Maj as well and they apparated outside. Newt quickly put the niffler back, before attempting to obliviate the other man, only for the scared No-Maj to hit him with his own case and run away. Arianna was tempted to go after him, but right now she was more concerned about Newt. "Sweetie, are you okay?" She asked, a warm, comforting presence around his back.</p><p>He nodded. "I'm fine, love. Bugger about that though." He muttered. Arianna giggled and kissed his cheek. They started to walk out of the alley and Arianna stiffened at seeing Tina coming their way. She quickly grabbed onto Newt's arm as Tina grabbed him from the other side and apparated them away.Tina immediately asked them who they were. "Newt Scamander and this is Ari." The wizard replied, nodding at his companion who was standing a bit away from them.</p><p>Tina glanced at the woman, before focusing back on Newt. Arianna silently sighed in relief at that Tina asked about Newt's creatures, before revealing that she worked for MACUSA. Newt gave Arianna a quick glance at this, now knowing why she was so tense. Realising that they had failed to obliviate the No-Maj, Tina decided to take them in. She reached for Arianna, but the other woman stopped her. "I'll take Newt's other arm." She said and quickly did so. Tina frowned for a second, before letting it go and apparating away. </p><p>Walking towards the woolworth building, Tina noticed Arianna's tense posture and asked about it. The witch brushed it off, saying that this was her first time dealing with the law. "Well, there's a first time for everything." Tina replied flippantly, before asking the doorman to let them into MACUSA. They walked through the door, Arianna going sideways and stepped into a magnificent looking lobby. </p><p>They got into the elevator and went to the Major Investigation Department. On the way there, Newt noticed Arianna getting even more tense with the second, a consistent ruffling sound in the air, barely noticeable above the rattling of the elevator. They stepped into the room and Newt saw a woman and a man discussing something that sounded very important, before they noticed the small group entering.</p><p>"We made your position quite clear, Ms Goldstein. You're no longer an auror." The woman said, sounding impatient and frustrated. Tina tried to defend herself, but the woman wouldn't have it, sending them out of the room immediately and Tina obeyed, completely embarrassed. Newt saw Arianna give Tina a sympathetic look as she relaxed just slightly, only to step back slightly as the man from the room appeared. </p><p>"A minor incident, I take it?" The man asked, brown eyes glancing over Newt and Arianna. Tina just nodded. "Yes, Mr Graves." She replied. Mr Graves nodded and softly ordered her to check their wands and that he'd be down shortly, his tone very different than from the woman, who apparently was the president. He also told Tina not to take the dismissal too hard and Tina showed a little smile at that. </p><p>They went down in the elevator and walked past several desks, who all moved or rocked a bit as they walked past, much to Tina's confusion. They arrived at a dingy looking office, very different from the prestige offices above. Tina asked about their wand permits and Newt said that he had made a post application weeks ago. Tina glanced at Arianna, who shrugged. "Don't have a wand." She said simply. </p><p>It wa another thing that she had left behind when she ran away from home, knowing that her father could find her with it. She was quite capable of wandless magic or at least, enough to survive. Tina pulled her own wand and cast some spells, humming in thought as it turned out that she really didn't have one with her. A pompous man joined them, making Arianna quickly move away from him and scolded Tina for disappearing.</p><p>Just then, Mr. Graves appeared and Arianna moved again. Tina quickly stepped forwards. "Mr. Graves. This is Mr. Scamander and Ms..." She trailed off and looked at Arianna as she realised that she didn't know her last name. "Quince." The other woman quickly replied and Tina nodded at that. "And Ms Quince. Mr Scamander has a crazy creature in that case and it caused mayhem in a bank." She continued, walking right up to the man. </p><p>Mr. Graves asked to see said creature and Tina took the case from Newt and opened it to reveal... pastries. Newt and Arianna shared a look as they realised that the man from before had their case. Mr. Graves left and Arianna couldn't help, but watch him go. Something about him gave her a bad feeling. She snapped out of her thoughts, when Newt grabbed her hand and walked to the elevator withTina. They had to find the case, before it was too late. </p>
