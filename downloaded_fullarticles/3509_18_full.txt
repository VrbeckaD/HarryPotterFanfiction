    <p align="justify">Harry Potter wondered sometimes how different his life would have been had he not ben blessed- or cursed- with his beloved twin sister, Hayley.</p><p align="justify">For starters, Aunt Petunia would have barely tolerated his presence in the house . For what Harry understood of their family dynamics, their mother, Lillian, being a witch had driven her away from her sister, who also seemed to have her own reasons to ressent her youngest.</p><p align="justify">So it was not with happiness in her heart or out of family concern that Petunia took them in. It was actually a mix of Dumbledore shaming Petunia into it and the longing for having a daughter of her own.</p><p align="justify">Petunia had had a rough first pregnancy; her baby was too big, she had complications at birth and those left her forever impaired. She had assumed her dream of having a baby girl would never came to be and had told herself she was content in raising her beloved boy as a single child.</p><p align="justify">Then, Hayley came into her life.</p><p align="justify">Harry knew his aunt would have prefered just to take the small girl in, but Albus Dumbledore insisted both were to be raised together, leaving Petunia no other choice than to accept Harry.</p><p align="justify">Dudley was, obviously, the apple of his mother's eye, but Petunia indeed had a soft spot for Hayley and, in time, came to be almost nice to Harry, for his sister was very protective of the boy and make sure to share everything with him.</p><p align="justify">The room they shared were the smallest of the house and they were expected to keep it clean and organized at all times; they were well fed and, although their clothes were basically hand me downs of Dudley´s or from their distant cousins, Harry had to admit they were not unhappy or terribly mistreated.</p><p align="justify">Had not been for Hayley , I might have ended sleeping in a cupboard.</p><p align="justify">Hayley had always been smart and eager to make their lives better. It did not take long for her to realize that their well being was directly associated with making Petunia happy and the small girl sought ways to ensue their aunt had a smile on her face.</p><p align="justify">Sometimes, her desires and of her aunt´s were one and the same: “ Aunt Petunia, my teachers said I am quite talented and there is a casting call for Eastenders...would you have me try out?Would it not be fun if I get the part? You could meet all the famous people!”</p><p align="justify">Petunia was in heaven when Hayley´s agent informed them she had been hired. Aged five, Hayley Potter made her debut on television. It was a small part- three episodes- but the money was good and , since her aunt was their guardian, this meant that Petunia Dursley was able to take pictures with some of her favorite stars.</p><p>Hayley became one of the most sought after models-actress of her age and her income helped pay some of the Dursley´s bills. (thankfully, there were laws against parents and guardians taking too much of child start´s wages). Hayley insisted to have her moeny deposited in a shared account with Harry and even got him some jobs as extra player, as they were both quite good looking.</p><p>Petunia was very upset when time came for Hayley and Harry to leave for Hogwarts and was seriously considering not allowing them to attend. Hayley had the presence of mind of putting their aunt´s worries to rest the best way she could:</p><p>“I can still work during my vacations…”</p><p>and to Hogwarts they went.</p><p>***</p><p>Hayley was sorted into Ravenclaw; that silly hat wanted to place her at Gryffindor with her brother but the eleven years old, on the brink of womanhood, wanted to assert her individuality. Much to her surprise, since their arrival, Harry was being treated with almost reverence by some of students who believed him to be a child of prophecy.</p><p>Privatly, Harry believed they both had defeated their would-be-murderer...their mother´s sacrifice protected them both from the killing curse.</p><p>
  <em>Why is that everybody assumed it had been him to defeat Voldemort?</em>
</p><p>While Hayley was happy for her brother finally gaining recognition, she knew she was just too good to be shoved into a supporting role.</p><p>The years passed: Hayley´s breasts, rear and legs developed and well, everybody noticed. She would be lying if she said she was not happy at being, once again, the center of attentions: for fucks´s sake, the girl was a child actress, of course she liked to be admired and talked about!</p><p>Hayley made it to the Ravenclaw quidditch team and swore they would get the Cup that year. The girl was relentless in bending the rules of the game for her advantage, unashamed of using force and violence and all too keen from stealing the spotlight from Harry, reasoning he was shy anyway.</p><p>It was not only a hint of sibling rivarly that guided Haley those days, but her hormones too.</p><p>The thing was that, at fourteen, Hayley was simply dying to lose her virginity; but not with anyone and no, she would not give up her innocence for nothing.</p><p>No, no...sex was power and Hayley was all convinced there was a way of enhancing her magical core through pleasure.</p><p>Why not get as powerful as Voldemort or Dumbledore through multiple orgasms?</p><p>Hayley had developed a talent for stealing during her years in the Theater. When she found a book in the forbidden area of Hogwarts library about sex magic, she stole it on the spot. Hayley was an outstanding student but she found the book too theoretical and hermetic and concluded she needed not only willing partners, but a capable teacher.</p><p>There was only one man for the job: Severus Snape.</p><p>She hesitated at first. For starters, Hayley was a minor at fourteen and she hated the idea of being taken advantage of. Then, she knew that Snape had been in love with her mother, so the thought of him being interested in guiding this journey because he had always wanted to fuck Lily Evans was, well, gross.</p><p>Harry and Hayley returned to the Dursley´s the summer and, as usual, their aunt had booked the girl for some photo shoots and a small, blink you miss, role in the movie Persuasion. However being fourteen looking like eighteen was working against her at this point and there was not many jobs to be had, so Hayley was free to accept the Weasley's invitation to the Quidditch World Cup.</p><p>There, Hayley met the elusive Charles Weasley and, well, decided a too good to pass learning opportunity had presented itself.</p><p>She discreetely went to meet the red- haired young man when he was alone in his room:</p><p>“Hi there Charles...so, tell me: do you find Harry attractive?”</p><p>The poor red haired almost choked.</p><p>“No need to be so scared. You know, the outside world is coming around to this sort of things. Pretty natural, if you ask me. You have gay animals in the nature...why not have gay wizards too, right?”</p><p>Charlie lived far away from his family and did not know Hayley enough to trust her with his secret; therefore, she worked on calming him down and convince Charles she meant no harm.</p><p>“ Come on, I am not going to tell anyone and I do not judge! I just need your ...err...help?”</p><p>“Are you blackmailing me, Hayley?” Charles asked incredulous.</p><p>“No, no. Regardless if you agree to help me or not, I will not tell anyone. It is just that you, being gay, are the right man to teach me how to properly suck cock. You know, since you get your cock sucked and suck some, you do have both perspectives!”</p><p>Charles could not argue with Hayley´s logic and, for the next couple of days, the young witch was given a crash course in the art of fellatio.</p><p>Hayley had just finished licking the tip of Charle´s dick after he unloaded on her tits- something he delighted in doing now that he had allowed a girl near his man bits- when she asked him: “How would you rank your prick, Charlie? I mean, it does look good and it fits in my mouth, but I am curious to hear your opinion on the matter.”</p><p>“Men are obsessed about size and it is one of the few things in my lifestyle that sometimes make me wish for heterosexuality. I am versatile, meaning I like both to give and to get, and my cock is bigger than the average, but not by much. I would say my equipment is more than enough for possible partners and the ones who need more can have my fists.”</p><p>As he spoke, Charlie watched as Hayley played with his balls even though he had just ejaculated and smiled. After all, he had told her to familiarize herself with male anatomy and gave her free reign to handle him.</p><p>“ You see how I keep my pubic hair trimmed at the base? It is cleaner this way, but also gives the impression that my ding dong is bigger.”</p><p>The day after, Charlie had to leave for Romania. Hayley asked him to grade her efforts and, from 1 to 10, Charles said her blow job was a solid 9.</p><p>Hayley vowed to practice until she was sure she was a 10</p><p>***</p><p>Hayley took to wear more risqué clothes underneath her Ravenclaw robes. Draco Malfoy seemed to be a fan- actually, screw that, Slytherins were all but salivating everytime Hayley entered a room. The poor bastards. She had a huge crush on Lucius Malfoy and was beyond herself at the World Cup when she noticed Draco's father checking her out.<em> Hehe...just don't die before I get my hands on you, your sexy racist motherfucker.</em></p><p>Harry, however, was tired of being teased by the other boys on Hayley´s choice of attire. “ We are in the wizarding world, sis...stop wearing those lycra pants and tight, form fitting shirts.”</p><p>“Nah, I do not think so, big brother.” Hayley then winked at Draco, who was sitting at an oposite table; the poor boy's face went immediately red. “ You see, the boys do not mind it, the girls keep transfiguring their clothes to look like me and, most importantly, I am completely comfortable wearing those clothes, so you are the only person complaining about this …”</p><p>A day later, Hayley was called to a private meeting with the Heads of the Four Houses and the Headmaster:</p><p>“ Miss Potter, I asked you here to discuss your non compliance to Hogwarts dress code.” Dumbledore said sternly as soon as Hayley took her sit.</p><p>
  <em>Fuck you, Harry Potter!</em>
</p><p>“Wait, are you not even going to offer me lemon drops?” Hayley said dispassionately. “ Jeez, you must be really mad at me, huh?”</p><p>“I assure you, Miss Potter, I am not mad, merely doing my job. As you see, I called the four houses here to discuss this matter. Most likely due to your high profile, your non compliance of our rules has been not only observed, but mimicked by some of our pupils.”</p><p>Hayley´s knickers got wet when Severus Snape spoke. <em>Man, his voice is like melted chocolate</em>. “ While the girls at Slytherin have not been caught wearing such extravagant outfits, the boys have been affected during theclasses shared with Ravenclaw, where Miss Potter pervasive influence is most felt.”</p><p>Professor Flitwick shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “ I resent this comment, Professor Snape. Miss Hayley Potter is nothing but a good influence : she spends part of her time tutoring the youngers, is always ready to defend victims of bullying due to their blood status, has been very successful in her efforts at integrating the four houses and has the best grades in school. Miss Potter is an overachiever and this makes many people jealous. The clothing you refer to, as she explained to me, is used by muggle athletes during their practices. She has pitched the idea of wearing such apparal for training purposes and our team is happy with the results. That we just defeated Slytherin again has obviously clouded your judgement."</p><p>Severus Snape sneered. “Why is then that Miss Potter and her friends dress in such improper way after their practices? They are behaving like trollops, their arms and legs exposed in the courtyard...I saw it myself!”</p><p>Oh, yeah, and you liked it!</p><p>“Hey, listen...it is September and soon we will not have enough sunlight. This is Scotland, not Mallorca; we came out of practice once or twice ( more like three times, really) and we indeed exposed our skin, not to the other students, but to the Sun. We share the same biology as muggles and Sunlight is the best way to metabolize vitamin D. That boys see us there and found our presence hard to be ignored is not my problem! They should go their way and take a cold shower. I am only worried about my health!Lack of vitamin D causes depression! I mean, I do not want to be all bitter, doom and gloom during Winter! "</p><p>Hayley´s eyes watered; she pouted. Everybody seemed to take pity on the poor girl...everybody but Snape.</p><p>“Fine...bare your arms and legs to the Sun if that means you will be a happy girl coming Winter! Merlin forbid we have a depressed Potter in our hands! But pray tell, why you need to wear such form fitting dresses with much cleavage when we are inside?”</p><p>Hayley fought against rolling her eyes; she simply did not believe her girls had to be compressed and hidden under uncomfortable fabric.</p><p>She could not, however, admit that: “I have been working as a model and actress since I was five, six years old, saving money for my future. You know, because we are orphaned and far from the wizarding world, my brother and I did not known about our vault. My career as a child actress has been providing myself, my brother and even paying part of the Dursleys bills for years. In fact, my aunt Petunia only allowed Harry and I to come to Hogwarts because I am still working during my vacations. But I am not a child anymore…”</p><p>Hayley went on to explain the fashion and entertainment industry to her audience: youth was a desirable commodity and now that she had outgrown her child model days and with the blessing of her guardian, Hayley was all but an adult in the eyes of agents, photographers and directors:</p><p>“I am tall and pretty enough for the runway- well, I could lose a couple of pounds if we are speaking about Haute Couture- but since last year I became quite big breasted and the only jobs I am being offered at the moment are swimsuits photo shoots or period dramas. My agent says I must do it, to show the industry that I am not a child anymore and since I get their clothes for free…”</p><p>She had the audience at the palm of her hand. Professor McGonagall was scandalized; Hayley was implying her aunt forced her into basically selling her body and all she had to wear now were such clothes. Well, I do keep them after the shoot, but most of the money go to my account and my agent… aunt Petunia just gets ten percent and free champagne while I take the pics.</p><p>“Dear child, when I handed you and Harry to your aunt, I would have never imagined that she was capable of forcing you into labor. Would you mind showing us those images you spoke about? I want to make sure I know exactly how bad the situation is.”</p><p>Her first instinct was to show them pictures that exposed more of her body in hopes of enticing Snape, but fearing Dumbledore would go too rough on poor Petunia, Hayley accioned the ones took for an ad spot for Elle Magazine, where she had a wraparound skirt covering her bottom.</p><p>Hayley was having the time of her life watching them watch her pictures, their faces going from shame (for her? Or for their bodies reacting to the sight?) to pity ( which could be useful in due time, of course) until the Headmaster finally said: “ I think we have seen enough.”</p><p>“Thank you, Headmaster.” Hayley said in the most timid voice she could pull out.</p><p>
  <em>Good, even Professor Snape seems convinced I am some poor girl being exploited!</em>
</p><p>Hayley then begged Dumbledore not to do anything against Petunia: “ She does not know any better. Being a model is quite a good profession in their world.” She also agreed to be more discreet in the future and Dumbledore would take her to Gringotts in the coming week to withdraw gold and acquire “ proper” clothing.</p><p>The best, however, was the Headmaster suggesting they could request Hayley´s emancipation to the Wizengamot once she turned fifteen. This would include Harry, of course, and would give them both unrestricted access to the Potter's monies.</p><p>
  <em>Hehehe.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p>Once he returned to his dungeons, Professor Snape found a small flask at his desk. The Potions Master was sure he had not misplaced anything; someone had purposely left it there to be found by him.</p><p>Carefully, he opened he flask taking every precaution in the book not to spill anything or move too fast and provoke an explosion.</p><p>His long and hooked nose recognized the smell immediately.</p><p>
  <em>Menstrual Blood. Freshly harnessed. First day of the Cycle. Powerful, virgin witch.</em>
</p><p>This gift was very valuable and would not go to waist. Someone was trying to play with him- he had so many enemies he lost count- but a Slytherin will always take advantage of whatever came his way.</p><p>The potions he could do with this blood…</p><p>The day after this unexpected discovery, Snape found another vial; in the end, he had gathered four. Friday approaching, he got anxious. Her cycle is bound to end soon; will she reveal herself to me? Or simply provide me with more coming next month?</p><p>With anticipation, Snape opened the door of his personal chambers, his eyes falling on his desk. Empty. For a brief second, he was disappointed, until he heard her voice.</p><p>“I take you have received my gifts. They are, of course, a sign of good will. We should be friends, don´t you think?”</p><p><em>Should have known.</em> “Hayley Dorea Potter, how on earth have you not been sorted at Slytherin?”</p><p>“In case this makes you more receptive to my offer, the Hat considered it.”</p><p><em>She is wearing those sinful clothes</em>. Snape controlled his face as to not show his amusement: the chit had fooled him, playing the part of abused child. “You have a minute, Miss Potter.”</p><p>Hayley handed Snape a book. “I need a powerful wizard versed in the Dark Arts to tell me if it is possible...to enhance one´s magical core through sex. Honestly, half the things in the book seem to be inconsequential mumbo jumbo, but there is enough there to have left me intrigued.”</p><p>“The Black Book: some have suggested that no other than Morgan Le Fay is the anonymous author, which could account for its oddness, since the witch was known for being unorthodox.” The Potter girl wanting to know about Dark Arts...a very dangerous proposition. “ Miss Potter, tell me where did you find this book?It has been lost for centuries! Hogwarts has just but two pages in its forbidden area the Malfoys are very proud of owning a half burnt version of the book!”</p><p>Hayley told how she had found the Black Book at Hogwarts one day, how she felt strangely drawn to it. “I dare say destiny wanted me to have it. So, are you going to help me?”</p><p>“As much as your offer does intrigue me, Miss Potter, you are fourteen...I am not a peadophile.”</p><p>“Not now...but next year after I have my magical emancipation? I would allow you to harness my virgin blood if you rid me of my maidenhead, Professor Snape.”</p><p>Snape had loved the girl´s mother, but Hayley, apart from the eyes and mouth, looked like her Potter and Black ancestors. No doubt she would grow to be a great beauty, but virginity was a precious thing, not to be traded like chocolate frogs cards.</p><p>“Don´t you have romantic aspirations? Why do you wish magical power so badly to sell me your hymen?”</p><p><em>Is it possible that the girl is rolling her eyes?</em>: “ Look, Snape, in an ideal world, I would fall in love with a boy my age and we would both discover our bodies together and, I don't know, marry and have beautiful babies, but I feel in my bones that something very bad is about to happen and I want to have all the tools at my disposal to fight back. If banging a plethora of men and women in those crazy ass rituals described in this book will provide me with enough ammo to protect me, my family and friends from whatever comes my way, so be it. I can find love one day, when I am older and wiser…”</p><p>“There are other ways…” Snape tried to argue and was cut out by Hayley.</p><p>“Oh, sorry, I do not want to murder people and suck their life energy or whatever you Death Eaters used to do back in the day, you know, when you all tried to kill me and my helpless brother? “</p><p>Snape, the spy, paid with his soul for his mistakes. Still, it hurt him when Hayley reminded of the day Lily had died.</p><p>“Reading in a book and actually doing it in real life are two different things, Miss Potter. Do you really think you have it in you? To play with fire?”</p><p>“You sound like Dumble-whore now...you worry too much. What about having fun? Consensual sex is supposed to feel good, right? I am not like, asking you to go and rape underfed, brain damaged puppies…”</p><p><em>The girl has a gift for words.</em> “Thank you for the lovely image, Miss Potter, I shall sleep well tonight. Go to your dorm and keep your legs shut until you are of age. Then, we shall speak again." If I do not accept, the girl will go and find some dangerous dark wizard and probably get herself killed." I will accept your proposal once you are declared of age."</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p>Dolores Umbridge was a pain in everybody's asses, and was enough to convince Severus Snape that Hayley had all the reason to drabble in Sex Magic, if it meant to detsroy people like that harpy.</p><p>By then, Hayley and Harry had already been discreetly emancipated by the Wizengamot due to the Dursleys unfitness, the “ racy” pictures of Hayley in bikinis used as proof and, much to her utter and secret joy, Rita Skeeter got her hands on the material and Hayley found herself, once again, as the center of attention.</p><p>She, of course, loved every minute of it!</p><p>Their schedules had made quite hard to meet for preparing the ritual, but one day after a meeting with Umbridge, Severus decided enough was enough and threw caution to the wind: Hayley Potter was a promising witch and her sorry excuse of a brother would need all the help if he was to defeat Voldemort, who was back and oh, all so powerful.</p><p>If sex would grant Hayley powers to assist her brother, Snape, good guy as he was, had no other choice than to sacrifice himself for the greater good and take her virginity.</p><p>This and, well, he wanted to forget all about that pink clad menace that was Dolores Umbridge.</p><p>She was already waiting for Snape when he closed the door of his dungeon: “So, here I am, Professor...are you ready to make me a woman?” <em>hehehe...this is so cheesy!</em></p><p>“I suggest you take this seriously, girl.” he said sharply.</p><p>“You are all too worked up; of course, what we are about to do is serious, you are to open literally pump me with your seed and knowledge. Do not think for a second that I do not seethe seriousness of it. It is just that we are very different people in way we approach things: I always strive to find enjoyment in what I do whereas you are like the epitome of stoic, no nonsense older man.” Severus looked at Hayley with his dark eyes and silently agreed with her assessment. “ So, I suggest we relax a bit...I can even suck you to , you know, take off the edge.”</p><p>“Sounds reasonable to me.” Severus then stepped closer to Hayley and gave her one of those truly mind blowings, lustful, passionate, demanding kisses that leave you breathless and dizzy in the end.</p><p>With a move of his wand, Snape undressed them both.</p><p>Hayley ogled him : “ Severus...why do you hide this killer bod of yours under the priest outfit? God, aren't you well endowed!”</p><p>He was very glad she had liked what she saw, but Snape being Snape, he had to offer Hayley a retort:“Must you be so...crass, Miss Potter?”</p><p>Hayley giggled: “ I am sorry. Yes, you are definitely a man of substance but I am just a horny teenager. I am intelligent and ambitious yes, but my hormones and the company I keep make me a bit silly sometimes. If what I say makes you blush, you should never come near the Ravenclaw girl´s dorm...we have very filthy minds and even filthier mouths...not quite as the Hufflepuffs though, they are really obsessed about sex!”</p><p>Severus would have never imagined girls could be that forward. Yes, being a Death Eater, he had witnessed and participated in a fair share of sexual acts with witches of great sexual curiosity, but they had been more often than not, older and more experienced witches, of the kind that drabbled or were deep in the Dark Arts for years.</p><p>He was lost in this thought when a wet, marvelous tickling at the tip of his cock took him out of it: Hayley swallowed him in a single, elegant gulp, her delicate hands holding his length in place as she went from south to north and back again with brief stops at his head, where she licked the sensitive spot until it was glistening with pre-cum.</p><p>She knew enough to concentrate her efforts on the most responsive area- the tip- while pumping Severus rock hard cock in tandem with her tongue movements.</p><p>Severus was surprisingly vocal in his appreciation, his beautiful, melodic voice filled with lust, guided Hayley with affectionate praises. “ Very good.” , “Yes, keep this way.” “Please, more!”</p><p>Perhaps is the teacher im him. Hayley thought as she intensified the pace of her strokes. As expected, Severus was meticulously clean underneath his black robes. He was well above average in size- bigger than the Weasleys Hayley had so far played with- and kept his hoarse, dark pubic hair, well trimmed.</p><p>Still working her magical tongue over his shaft, Hayley raised her eyes and met his; she smiled and, after giving him a very playful lick, she raised her body and met Severus lips in a sensual kiss. “ Should I massage your perineum, Severus? Oh, may I call you by your name...or you have a student-teacher fetish?”</p><p>“Severus is fine...by all means, do not call me Professor when you are naked in my bed and yes, stick this dirty finger of yours inside my ass while you suck me.”</p><p>While Hayley´s finger were thinner than he would have prefered, Severus had to admit that she promptly found his prostate and stimulated it properly. Perhaps feeling he needed more, she added a second finger for good measure and in no time, he was grunting and rocking his hips, fucking her throat with an intensity that would have shocked her had she not been so adept at the act.</p><p>“Fuck--- girl!---gonna...cum…” he managed to say, alerting Hayley about the impeding explosion of life matter inside her mouth.</p><p>She continued to suck Severus, relaxing her throat to receive his load. When it finally happened, she was pleased to hear her name escaping his lips. “ Fuck---Hayley!”</p><p>The warmth, thick, viscous liquid hit Hayley taste buds with the salty, tangy flavour of him; she swallowed eagerly.</p><p>Severus was as mellow as a pup afterwards, holding Hayley in his arms while they waited his member to recover from the high. “I dare say you have a talent...and you looked like you were really enjoying yourself.”</p><p>“Well, I have over a year of experience giving head, Severus. I learned from the best and since then I made sure to exercise such skill at least once a week. I found that men- or boys- get happy enough if you suck them the correct way and well, they tend to reciprocate if you make it clear that is what you want. All in all, a good deal, I say.”</p><p>Severus had led a life of losses. This made him not only bitter, but incredibly protective of the few things and people he cared. He had feared developing feelings for Hayley- she was the daughter of Lily, after all- and be confused by the nature of their arrangement, but now, having her in his bed, listening to her, Severus was surprised: he was not jealous of the girl´s past experiences, nor resented her future happiness in the arms of another.</p><p>He wished her well.</p><p><br/> “I never heard any rumours about your extracurricular activities, so I assume you are either obliviating those lucky boys or your partners are not to be found among our pupils. No way a boy your age would not brag having your full lips around his prick...you are, in all probability, the most beautiful girl in the school and I am afraid many would consider half the fun sharing the sordid details with their friends.”</p><p>She planted a peck on his hooked nose and giggled: “ I have not embarked in an illicit, orally satisfying affair with one of our illustrious Professors, Severus. But the solution was quite simple, actually: Weasleys! “</p><p>Severus almost puked in his mouth. “ Ugh!”</p><p>“ Come on...they have some sort of working class charm, right? Besides, the Black Book has a very interesting chapter about twins.” Severus arched an eyebrow. “Fred and George have their girlfriends and this ensue their silence, at least around here. I am sure they write Bill about our exploits , but I don't much care. Weasleys are notoriously horny and well, some day I might need more of them...”</p><p><em>The girl is smart</em>.” You are a Slytherin in disguise, Hayley. “</p><p>“I will take it as a compliment, Severus.” Another kiss. “ Are you all set to go? Harry says our failed murderer is back. We need to move on.”</p><p>They had discussed the ritual previously and Severus concluded that Hayley had understood correctly: love should not be involved in the sex magic equation, at least not at the beginning. Flattering as it was- the gift of her virginity and first blood- Severus have never even considered drabling in this magic, so they were both experiencing an anxiety now that time had finally come.</p><p>“There is an almost pain free way of breaking your barrier, but the book says it has to be rough...forgive me, Hayley.”</p><p>Severus grabbed Hayley by her hips and placed his now very rigid cock at her entrance, noticing she was mildly aroused. The potion master was aware that the pleasure of sucking a man´s cock for a woman was more psychological than physical, the thrill of having the partner at her mercy, so finding Haley´s cunt in the first stages of lubrication was expected. Normally, he would use his fingers and mouth to bring the girl to orgasm before he was to claim her maidenhead, but this was quite an exceptional situation.</p><p>With a single, steady, fluid movement of his pelvis, Severus sheathed his cock inside of Hayley´s virginal pussy. "Aarg!" A painful wail,; then silence- her discomfort so palpable that Snape swore he could taste the girl´s tears in his mouth.</p><p>He moved forward and back until he saw blood. Severus then halted and went about the tedious task of harnessing her maiden´s blood for potion making purposes. Hayley did not move, allowing her teacher space to collect the physical proof of their sexual union in peace.</p><p>It was quick, but it felt like ages, so nervous she was.</p><p>This step behind them, Severus resumed their ritualistic coupling, fervously thrusting inside of Hayley as he chanted, inducing them both to enter a trance like state. They achieve a semi conscious instance, like we are when dreaming right before waking up, and continued to fuck relentlessly. He reveled in the feel of her tight, warm pussy around his prick and felt on the verge of spilling inside many times, but another force- the power they were creating- kept him from reaching completion before her.</p><p>The transfer was almost complete. Hayley´s body had let go of the pain and be guided by lust in its purest form guided to achieve their goal. Getting close to what promised to be a very intense, first orgasm, her animal instincts now ruling over her rational side, Haley grinded herself against Severus, forcing him to hit that spot in her core, finally bringing her to a peak.</p><p>“Willingly and eagerly, with you I share my seed, my knowledge, my magic. Willingly and eagerly, with me you share your body, your passion, your magic. “</p><p>They had slightly modified the ritual, which originally was done non consensually. This meant that Hayley would not be immediatly granted the same powers and abilities Snape had so diligently worked to attain, which was akin to theaft. Rather, Severus offer would show and guide Hayley to learn from his own magic, she taking a short cut, speading her learning curve.</p><p>His talent, personal experiences and magical core were, and would remain, his. Had they followed the Black Book verbatim on this, the result would make Snape spending some time at rest in order to regenerate his magical energy again.</p><p>The ritual complete, Severus extracted himself out of Hayley´s deeps and collapsed by her side.</p><p>They were both sweaty, tired and wasted.</p><p>But he was as happy as he could be.</p><p>Severus had heard the profecy: Harry and Hayley were two halves of it. Now that the girl had concluded as much and was expanding her corde,they had a real chance of defeating the madman now.</p>
