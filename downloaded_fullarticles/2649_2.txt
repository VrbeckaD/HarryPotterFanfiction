    <p>YEAR ONE<br/>
In Raina Oreloko's first year at Hogwarts, she was sorted into Slytherin and she was horrified. She’d grown up in a muggle setting and gone to a muggle school, although she’d known she was a witch all along. There she had gotten on well. Her town was small and her school was closely knit. She’d been the queen there – the popular girl, and it had come from being well liked. She didn’t think that would happen in Slytherin.<br/>
She could feel the suspicions of the others students threatening to drown her, and for a while it almost had.<br/>
Then she met Feron, another Slytherin. He was shy – she’d had to follow him around for days before he really spoke to her. There was a kind of hardness in his gaze, that left her in no doubt that when he wanted something he would work for it; now they were friends, they would stay that way.<br/>
Although she talked to the other Slytherins, and occasionally people from other houses, it was the twins who really changed her way of thinking. The Weasley twins of course.<br/>
They expected her to be evil, although they were nice to her on the train. The day they pranked her 'because she was a Slytherin' she decided she wouldn't let stereotypes stop her from being friends with everyone.<br/>
Some she met in the library and tentatively helped study should they need it. Some she sat beside in class, dragging Feron behind her all the way.<br/>
She had a kind of charisma to her. One that she didn't know at the time was supernatural. Later she would look at her first year self and wonder how genuine her popularity had really been.<br/>
At the time, she was well liked and confident, but almost wouldn't have minded if she wasn't; she had Feron and she knew that he and Catrina would stand by her no matter what. It was a nice feeling, and even nicer to have someone know all of her.<br/>
(She'd had to pretend more than once during her muggle schooling that she had no idea why things blew up or floated randomly)<br/>
YEAR TWO<br/>
In her second year Raina helped the new first years to the dorm. She knew the whole place looked creepy, so she and Fente, another Slytherin in her year, charmed bright yellowy orbs of light to float around the ceiling and the fire in the fire places to crackle a warm, glowy, orange rather than their previous green.<br/>
One of the newly sorted first years was freaking out about being in Slytherin. Their brother was a Hufflepuff, they said, why were they the bad one?<br/>
Raina softly explained the stigma surrounding the houses and to finally calm them down, she led them to one of the wide windows looking out into the lake. There she showed them the grindylows and occasional merfolk and taught them just how beautiful the common room was.<br/>
She was surprised when one of them came to her for help - surprised and flattered. Some of the first years from other houses even approached her, despite the green tie, and she showed them to classes and helped them with homework.<br/>
When Feron was not burying himself in his 'schoolwork' or hiding on the roof, Raina dragged him in. Out of their year group, he was the best at transfiguration.<br/>
YEAR THREE<br/>
This was the year Harry Potter came to Hogwarts, and the normalcy between houses slowly began to dissipate.<br/>
Raina tended to sit with a mix of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs then, although she was often joined by mutual friends and Maia Flitwick and Alicia Spinnet from Gryffindor.<br/>
Raina chose Study of Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures as her other subjects. She also skipped a year in history of magic because her muggle schooling had made essay writing easy, and despite Professor Binns droning voice, the content of the subject wasn't difficult.<br/>
Because of this, her Transfiguration was with the Gryffindor's. It was there she sat with Maia and inevitably, the twins.<br/>
She also led Feron into the Forbidden Forest to find werewolves and ended up finding a kneazle with a peculiar penchant for climbing. As mad as Feron was at Raina for dragging him out there, he and the cat were a good match, expecially since both liked to lie on roof tops.<br/>
It was a skill Feron had been seemingly born with. More than once, Raina had walked in on him reading on the roof under the impression that he was on the floor. Feron was just that distracted; sometimes Raina was surprised he hadn't ended up with the dreamers in Ravenclaw.<br/>
YEAR FOUR<br/>
In year four Raina and Feron dated briefly. It was the kind of thing they kept quiet; an experiment. Nothing much changed, although they did discover that girls just weren't Feron's type. This began their game during lunch, where they rated different guys.<br/>
It also begun Raina's attempts to drag Feron over to various groups of guys. He wasn't especially open with his sexuality, and Raina was content to help him keep it quiet. She herself eventually developed a crush on Cedric Diggory, who they had Herbology with.<br/>
This was a much louder affair and for sometime they were something of a golden couple, although she was met with some contempt from the older Slytherins (She and Feron managed to wreak havoc in their dorms and their hair didn't loose the garish purple shade for months).<br/>
Rather than drag him to the forbidden forest, Raina made them join the quidditch team. She was the only girl, and made chaser. Feron became a beater, and invaluable to the team.<br/>
This seemed to finally bring him out of his shell, as despite their reputation, their team was very closely knit.<br/>
There was however, the matter of Terrance, another guy in their year, being replaced by Draco Malfoy. It was Raina who found him after he stormed off when his position was replaced in favour of Draco Malfoy.<br/>
He wasn't happy to see her at first - she'd made the team after all - but after a lengthy conversation and a promise to get Feron to beat the blonde over the head with a bludger, her assured her there were no hard feelings.<br/>
(And she assured him that she would quietly make his life hell)<br/>
YEAR FIVE<br/>
Here it wasn't only puberty which (finally) hit Raina, it was her heritage. It started off with an enhancement of her ability to sense emotions and the occasional growth of talons and fangs. There was also the small matter of the wings which were (Thankfully) invisible when not extended.<br/>
They sure didn't feel invisible, hence Raina's permission to go onto the grounds at night. While folded up, they ached and cramped. Whenever she stretched she had to make sure she didn't extend them, however much she longed to.<br/>
She discovered she was part veela, and their ethereal beauty was locked as powerful magic inside her. She could access it whenever she wished, but she'd taken advantage of the prefects bathroom too see what she looked like with her 'glamour' on. It was perfect, but it wasn't her. She truly hated it. When she was little, her Grandfather had made her take self defence classes, and she'd learned how to fight. Now she understood why. She refused to use her glamour regardless, however. She hated it. She hated that once again she had a secret that she couldn't tell anyone - except for Feron, of course.<br/>
She heard the news of her parentage from her grandfather (Who she lived with), it was through a letter, given to her and explained by Dumbledore.<br/>
Yeah, her family was disappointing, but her one at school, her friends, left nothing to be desired.<br/>
She was also made prefect, and managed to get the password changed from 'Pure-blood' to 'Demon' - Feron's cat, who'd become something of a mascot for Slytherin house, what with his love of jumping from the ceiling onto people's heads.<br/>
Her night time flights were often accompanied with Feron, who used the time to improve his flying. Raina was especially nimble with her wings, and they joked about how easy quidditch would be if she could fly on the pitch.<br/>
The nights he didn't fly with her, she explored the grounds. She met a Hippogriff and a curious black dog.<br/>
It was here the presence of the twins began to bleed into her life more and more. The black dog was painfully skinny and Raina needed to feed it. She found the twins by tracking emotions through the castle, and got them to show her how to get into the kitchen despite the fact that it meant they would owe her a favour.<br/>
It couldn't be that bad, right?<br/>
Wrong.<br/>
She found herself involved in numerous pranks and desecrating her newly earned role as prefect. Feron was there to do the right thing, she supposed.<br/>
(Never mind the fact that he and Miles, the Slytherin keeper, were often found together in a dark corner of the dungeons despite the curfew)<br/>
As well as the black dog (Who she strongly suspected was an Animagus and eventually figured out was Sirius Black by the jump in his emotions as she said his name), she discovered Professor Lupin was a werewolf when sent to his office by Professor Snape on a full moon. He no doubt expected her to tell everyone, but she mentioned it only to Feron.<br/>
She enjoyed the late nights in the common room, even when she was studying. Sometimes she sat with the quidditch players, others Catrina's friend group (which Fente had finally joined despite Catrina's muggleborn status). Often she was content to curl up with Feron in their seats by the fireplace.<br/>
She often kept tabs on the emotional status' of her house mates - she had a gift, she reasoned every time she had doubts, she might as well use it. She found it fascinating to focus on Marcus Flint as he was teased for being held back. While he laughed along, she could tell it bothered him. As nasty as he seemed while on the quidditch pitch, there were also nights where she sat with him and helped him with the work. This helped her in her own classes, as well as him. He seemed to have trouble reading, and Raina thought back to her time in primary school, where one of her friends had been dyslexic. She'd gotten a teacher-aid to read for her. At Hogwarts there was no support, and she wondered what he'd do if he finally managed to graduate.<br/>
On top of her night-time escapades, adventures with the twins, and busy social life, she studied for her owls, neglecting ancient runes in favour of bringing up her grade in Herbology. She achieved O in transfiguration mainly due to Feron's tutoring, and gained one in each subject apart from Study of Ancient Runes. This didn't bother her as she'd set her sights elsewhere. It would also give her a free period to focus on History of Magic, as her she would be doing her NEWT for it in sixth year.<br/>
Those holidays, before the Quidditch World Cup (Which she managed to buy tickets for), she received her results and a thank you letter from Marcus Flint, who she decided that despite his flaws,  was not an entirely terrible person.<br/>
In fact, when she and Feron met up with him at the cup, she was all too happy to say hello. In the cup itself, she danced with the veela and during the death eater march afterwards, she snatched the youngest child from the hair and barrelled into the forest, flying into none other than the twins and their sister.<br/>
Of course, they could hardy miss the wings, but she handed them the child, and, bleeding from scratches all over her body, headed back up to help. When she finally landed with another of the children, it was Arthur Weasley who invited her back to the tent where they had essence of dittany to put over her many scratches.<br/>
It was with extreme relief that she reacted when they agreed not to mention her wings to anyone. She was sure, in retrospect, that she could have put it down to partial transfiguration, but it was almost nice to have others know the truth and not react badly. She knew that as nice as a person may be, there were some things which changed them completely. For years she'd been friends with Fente, but watched her shun Catrina because she was a muggle born.<br/>
YEAR SIX<br/>
The Triwizard tournament spelled the beginning of another year of much chaos. She was outraged at the cancellation of the quidditch season - yet another way she connected with the twins.<br/>
And of course there was the matter of her literally connecting with them. She was focused on Feron, who was walking along the roof and ranting to her about Miles. She had no focus on her surroundings and it showed as she barrelled into the twins, rushing around the corner. She realised Filch was close on the tails. Smirking she watched as the two boys tumbled into a broom closet and Filch came around the corner. He knew about her permission to go out at night but didn't like it.<br/>
She'd expected him to glower at her and ask if the twins had gone that way. She hadn't expected herself to defend them. Feron glared at her but diffused Filch's suspicion - he seemed to be a favourite of the old caretaker's. Fred, in particular, made fun of Feron's sudden breaking of the rules, and both of them saw an easy advantage to Raina's freedom to walk the grounds at night.<br/>
Raina also quietly watched Mad-Eye Moody, who's madness she recognized from somewhere deep in her consciousness. It was the kind of madness which hurt, and she found herself copying down Feron's defence against the dark arts notes after class when she could focus.<br/>
She initially hated Fleur when the other schools arrived. After supressing her glamour for so long, it seemed wrong to see someone who wore it so freely. Their friendship was slow but became firm. Fleur could fly on the full moon, and it was then when they discovered the dragons and the focus of the first task.<br/>
The yule ball brought many, many, people to bother Raina. Some she was able to turn down politely without causing a scene. Some wouldn't leave her alone. Cormac McLagan in particular, who'd gotten over his dislike of Slytherins to ask her out, took to following her between classes the spring the question on her. This prompted her to hide after class, finding herself in the same corridor as George Weasley. He helped her find a place to hide from passer-by and during that hour, they spoke a lot, and somehow, Raina landed herself a partner to the ball.<br/>
Platonically, of course. She and Fleur had both been cautious about partners; neither of them had any desire for this dance to be taken the wrong way.<br/>
Raina no longer blamed Fleur for letting her glamour show; she too had needed to learn to fight, and dealt with the dirty stares of older men when she'd first shown signs of her heritage at twelve.<br/>
The ball was the second time Raina let out her glamour in public, just a little, and the first time she did it as herself. She knew she looked stunning - in the midnight blue dress that Miles had helped her chose and the piercings she and Maia had gotten together at Hogsmeade.<br/>
Many of the girls in their year - from all houses - gathered in the prefects bathroom to get ready. Some came in after a morning in the snow, faces red from the cold. Others had spent the morning in face masks and painting nails. Raina was one of the former, but was glad for the latter group, who helped everyone.<br/>
She joined Angelina Johnson in straightening their hair with a specially made potion. Fente and Catrina also helped her with makeup, using a mix of magic and muggle products. Her nails were charmed to match her dress, which in turn matched her eyes. The silver jewellery adorning her neck, wrists, and ears, later prompted Feron to joke that she would be safe from any Vampires.<br/>
During the second task, Raina was asked to find the person the contestants valued the most. Some people were easy. She knew many people expected Fleur's person to be a boy, but Raina knew her sister held far more value to her.<br/>
While watching the entertainment many of the quidditch players had put together while the contestants were under water, she wasted several of her pieces of popcorn as she threw them at George, who insisted on water related puns:<br/>
'I wish I could sea what was going on'<br/>
'Water you doing here?'<br/>
'Dew you want more popcorn?'<br/>
And<br/>
'I don't know water problem is - I'm being the perfect gentleman.' (To Fred)<br/>
When the contestants finally resurfaced Fred joked about Harry and Ron being 'especially close' (which did make sense, Raina supposed, as both Krum and Cedric were dating their people). It was then Raina realised Fred might be just slightly bi.<br/>
She told Feron that night and her friend was just slightly too happy for him to sound uninvolved.<br/>
Oh she was so locking them in a closet so they could come out of it together.<br/>
During the third task she skimmed over the maze on McGonagall's orders, watching for red sparks. It was when she realised Krums mind had become a void that she knew something was very wrong. When she landed she sensed Sirius in his animagus form, watching from the stands. She may not have seen him for a long time, but she knew it was him.<br/>
And then the fact clicked, just as the portkey appeared in the middle of the pitch and the anguish of Harry Potter ripped into her mind.<br/>
There was a shadow in Sirius Blacks mind - the same one in 'Moody's'. The shadow brought from Azkaban, from the dementors.<br/>
She and Fleur stumbled up, trying to find someone to talk to. He'd already taken Harry - there was no time. It was Bill Weasley to help them. Later Raina would see the way he and Fleur looked at each other. How he didn't see her as an object and how that in itself made Fleur appreciate him. The bar really had been low, but Bill, Fleur later told her, had brought it up impossibly high.<br/>
It was their word that brought the Headmaster to Moody's office. Something in Professor Dumbledore's reaction told Raina he already knew exactly what was happening.<br/>
By the end of the year, she was one of the ones that believed You-Know-Who was back. There was as much fear in Slytherin as there was anywhere else. It was only a select few that reacted as if Voldemort back was a good thing, and they were met with contempt.<br/>
YEAR SEVEN<br/>
That summer Raina got a summer job at a coffee shop, and that was where she was now.</p>
