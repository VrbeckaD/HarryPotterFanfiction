    <p>Draco's POV</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I burst through the room of requirement doors as I was running late, she had set up our normal room. Which was just a plain blue room with several bookcases along the walls, a couch in front of the fireplace, and a king size bed off to one side. She was sitting on the couch, watching the flames from the fire, when I arrived. No one else besides me could enter the room so she didn't need to turn around to see who it was. I moved closer to the couch and walked slowly around it till I was in front of her. I crouched down on my knees and laid my hands lightly on her knees. Her beautiful brown eyes met mine and they were shining with unshed tears, I reached up and cupped her face softly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Don't cry, love," I told her gently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Draco, how could I not cry?" A sob racked her body and the tears fell down her cheeks, I wiped them away and kiss her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"We don't have another option," I said to her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I know but that doesn't make this any easier." She said and I nod my understanding, I know this was difficult for her. Hell, it was difficult for me too, but it needed to be done if she was going to be safe. She sighed and looked at the fire.</p>
<p>"Look at me." I turned her face so she was looking at me again. "We can still have tonight. We don't have to do it till morning." I pleaded with her to let us have one last night together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Of course I want one last night together Draco. I just don't know what I'm going to do after tonight ends. I don't know if I can handle it." She bit her lower lip nervously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You are so strong and you can handle anything that is thrown at you," I told her. "And when things get tough just remember that I love you and I always will."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I love you too Draco." She told me and I smiled at her words. She rested her forehead on mine and closed her eyes. Her curls go around us like a curtain and I breathed in the scent of cinnamon and parchment. I loved her scent and her soft curls and everything else about her. I didn't want to go through with this plan but there really wasn't another way that we could survive the war if we didn't do it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Don't change anything please," I said suddenly. I didn't want her to change, not the way she got obsessed over books, the way that she bit her lower lip when she's nervous, the way her eyes lit up when she talked about school. I didn't want her to change a single thing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I won't, I promise." She promised. "Give me one last night. Give me something to hold on to." I didn't hesitate to pull her into a passionate kiss that she responded to instantly. I pulled away from her and stood up, she squeaks in surprise when I picked her up and carried her to our bed. I set her down on it and look down at her. So far we hadn't gone further than some really intense make-out sessions which had me pausing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What do you want?" I asked while gazing into her eyes. I wanted to see any hesitation she may have but I could only find lust and love in her eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I want you, I want you in every way possible." She told me and I smiled at her before unbuttoning my shirt slowly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"If you want to stop at any point or if you are in pain tell me," I said to her, she nodded her understanding and ran her hand over my exposed chest. I pulled off my shirt and pushed her gently into the bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That night we made love over and over again, I woke up to her head on my chest and her curls spread out everywhere. I smiled and moved some of her curls out of her face, running my fingers lightly through her hair and suddenly tears were streaming down my face. I didn't want this to end, I just wanted to stay in this room with her forever and forget about the damn war that was about to happen outside of it. I knew that neither of us could do that but it was a bloody good idea. She raised her head up slowly and looked at me, she smiled sadly at me and wiped my tears away. I caught her hand and kissed it gently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Morning love," I said softly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Morning." She said quietly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Before we do anything I have a present for you," I told her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What? Why?" She asked and I chuckled,  always the curious one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Because I can," I told her, I waved my pants to myself and got the locket out of the pocket. I threw the pants back on the ground and held the locket out to her. The locket was pure gold with a dragon engraved into it. The dragon moved if you touched it and anyone who wasn't Hermione or myself would be bitten by it. She smiled at me and I nodded at her to open it, she opened it and gasped in surprise. In the inside was a magical picture of us in this room on the couch smiling and kissing and on the other side, it had our initials together. Hers were in my handwriting and mine in hers. She closed the locket and kissed me softly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thank you, Draco." She said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Let me put it on you," I said, taking it out of her hand. She pulled her hair up and I lightly clasped the locket around her neck, her fingers run over it slowly as she looked up at me in wonder. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I love you." She told me</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I love you too Hermione," I said. "It's time." She nodded and we both slowly got out of bed and get dressed. I kneeled down in front of her after we were both dressed and looked up at her. By now we both have tears streaming down our faces. She leaned down and kissed me one last time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I don't want to." She let out a soft sob.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I know but it's the only way." I reminded her while trying to swallow my own sobs. I needed to be strong for her, as strong as I could. She lifted her wand up to my head, her hand was shaking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I will always love you." She told me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"And I will always love you, even if I don't remember it." I looked her in the eyes and she looked back. A sob escaped me as she says the one word that rips away the only good thing in my life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Obliviate."</p>
<p>Hermione's POV</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As soon as the word was out, Draco collapsed. I levitated him onto the bed and checked him over before I left the room. Draco won't remember any of the time we spent together as friends or as a couple. He will remember having sex last night but he will think he got drunk and fucked a nameless random girl. I couldn't stop the tears that escape me as I made my way to Gryffindor tower. No one was awake so I didn't care about trying to keep them away, I managed to control myself at least a little bit before getting to the entrance. I fought the tears back and used magic to get rid of the red puffiness. I said the password and the door opened, I headed to the girl dormitory.</p>
<p>"Hermione?" I stop when I hear the voice, I had been so caught up in my thoughts that I hadn't even realized I wasn't alone in the lounge. I turned and see Harry and Ron sitting on the couch, both of them were looking at me in concern.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Yes?" I asked shakily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Did you do it?" Harry asked gently. I bit my lower lip and looked away. Some tears rolled down my face again and I just nodded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I'm sorry Mione but it will get better," Ron said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Don't!" I bit out in a strangled voice. "Don't ever talk about it again."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hermione you aren't alone, he was our friend too," Harry said placing a hand on my shoulder. I jerked away from it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I can't deal with it, Harry. It's just easier to pretend it never happened because that's what I'll have to do for the rest of my life. Every time I see him I will have to act like he never mattered to me and that I never mattered to him. So please for me pretend like it never happened and maybe one day I can move on with my life." My voice cracked from the sobs that I was trying to hold back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"We can do that," Ron says, I looked at them and nodded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thank you," I said and headed up to the dorms to get ready for the day that I still had to face.</p>
