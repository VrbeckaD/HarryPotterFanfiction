    <p>Geralt of Rivia could rembember a few instances in his life when he had to hold a baby. He also recalled that none of these moments were nice experiences. But here he was again, a wailing young child in his arms.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>The light had been blinding, illuminating the forest. <span class="adverb"> Fortunately </span> <span class="hardreadability"> , he wasn’t looking in this direction but Roach, surprised, had startled and bucked </span> . With a sharp tug on the reins, Geralt has turned around and pushed his horse in a gallop. He didn’t have to go far. The soil <span class="passivevoice"> was burned </span> in a perfect circle between the roots of a great tree, and a baby wailed in its center.</p>
    <p>But what could he do with this child ? <span class="hardreadability"> Geralt would have </span> <span class="adverb"> gladly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> left him in the care of the first willing family, but the little boy, looking </span> <span class="qualifier"> just </span> <span class="hardreadability"> over a year old, reeked of magic </span> . Not that he knew a lot about children, but this <span class="adverb"> clearly </span> wasn’t a normal human approved behaviour. The witcher sighed. At least the kid was calming down, those cries would have attracted wolves, to the least. He shrugged his cape and managed, rather <span class="adverb"> clumsily </span>, to tie the little body against his armor.</p>
    <p>He wasn’t too far from the village where he had to meet Yennefer. She would be a better bet than him to know what to do.</p>

      <p>Yennefer prided herself to be a woman of control. She wasn’t moved <span class="adverb"> easily </span> and her will was of iron. <span class="veryhardreadability"> But seeing Geralt enter the room she was renting with a young child </span> <span class="adverb"> carefully </span> <span class="veryhardreadability"> craddled in his arms, an unsure expression on his ragged face and hope in his eyes, she almost dropped her book </span>.</p>

    <p></p>
    <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
      <p>— "What did you bring me this time ?" she managed to say, her voice a bit too shaky for her taste.</p>

  <div class="">
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
      <p>— "Well…" Geralt looked at the baby, then at her. "I found him in the forest, it seemed to be some kind of portal, but no trace of it. Only the kid, crying his lungs out."</p>

  <div class="">

    <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
      <p>Yennefer left her chair and approached, letting her curiosity take a bit of her. <span class="hardreadability"> She extended her hand to touch the tuft of black hair poking out Geralt's cape and recoiled </span> <span class="adverb"> immediatly </span>.</p>
    </div>

    <p></p>
    <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
      <p>— "Oh yes, magic." She sighed and bite her lips. "A few kinds of magic, even, and none I am familiar with."</p>

    <p></p>
    <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
      <p>— "So… What should we do ? I don’t feel like dumping the kid in an orphanage like that. They never have enough. The kids always end up begging in the streets."</p>

    <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
      <p>The sorceress suppressed a shiver at the idea of such a young babe in one of those places, but not a sigh.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
      <p>She sat on her bed, her fingers running through the heavy bear pelt on the covers. For a few minutes, she observed the sleeping child, still in Geralt’s arms, his dark hair a mop upon his angelic face. Her heart clenched. So many desires battled in her mind, and she wasn’t sure reason would prevail this time. <span class="veryhardreadability"> The opportunity of being a mother, passing her magical knowledge to an heir she might have not carried but still educated, groomed and moulded to her content </span> . And, <span class="qualifier"> maybe </span> … <span class="qualifier"> Maybe </span> Geralt would <span class="passivevoice"> be interrested </span> in being a father figure ? She could convince him. <span class="hardreadability"> But seeing as the witcher still hadn’t made a move to put the baby elsewhere than against his chest, it was possible that it would not be necessary </span>. He was cradling him like a precious treasure, slipping worried glances every now and then.</p>

      <p>— "Last year, I have read a lot about purifications. It is the first step, for me. As it is now, I would not be able to touch him."</p>

    <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
      <p>Geralt looked up, straight in her eyes as he was trying to assess a potential threat. She wasn’t accustomed to having this look thrown to her. The amber eyes seemed to search, assess, calculate. She turned her own and continued :</p>

      <p>— "Those different magics do not feel like they should. The only fact that there are more than one is troubling, but one of them is <span class="adverb"> clearly </span> impure, leech-like. The other is his. It is quite the priority to rid the child of this corruption. <span class="adverb"> Fortunately</span>, the spell I have in mind does not <span class="complexword"> require </span> much material, we have everything on hand."</p>

        <p>The baby was crying again. Hiccups wrecking his little body, snot and tears marring his crunched up face. Geralt was starting to feel a migraine coming but couldn’t bare the idea to leave the room. He watched as the spell Yennefer was weaving worked around the boy laid on the bear fur.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
        <p>Strange, how he felt concerned about the wellfare of this child. There were hundreds outside, abandonned by poor families or unwilling mothers. Was it because of the magic ? The sorceress would have felt it if there was a charm on the kid. The strange way they crossed path ? It wouldn't be the fist time he saw something weird.</p>

      <p>He knew her, her deep want of a child she could never carry. The pressure of the Lodge keeping her from her desire of family. He thought of Ciri, stuck in Kear Mohren with a pile of old books and under the watchful eye of Vesemir. He smiled. It felt a bit like the first time he met the litlle girl. His conviction grew : neither of them would want to leave this child.</p>

      <p>He curled his lips in distate. Yennefer smiled again, rocking <span class="adverb"> slightly </span> back and forth to lull the little boy to sleep.

      <p>Her hesitation gave a pause to Geralt. It was a curious admission, and he was certain it was not a name given on the <span class="adverb"> fly</span>. She might have fantasised this name for a long time…</p>
