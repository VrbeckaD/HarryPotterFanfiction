          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale begins in Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry a week before the Christmas holidays. Second year student Merope Gaunt is talking to her girlfriend Isolt Sayre who is the Headmistress of Ilvermorny.</p><p>Merope smiled. "It's so beautiful this time of year, the school I mean."</p><p>Isolt said, "Christmas time is a magical time of year, pun not intended."</p><p>Merope asked, "Why aren't there any live creatures on the trees this year?"</p><p>Isolt told her, "Complaints from parents about it being cruel to them."</p><p>Merope stated, "Well, the trees are still brilliant without them. I especially like the addition of the colour changing lights this year."</p><p>Isolt beamed, "That was my idea."</p><p>Merope inquired, "Would it be alright if you stayed here during the holidays with me, Issy?"</p><p>Isolt grinned. "What a wonderful idea, Mer! We can spend Christmas together."</p></div>
