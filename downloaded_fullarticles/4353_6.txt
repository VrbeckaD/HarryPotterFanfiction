    <p>All Harry wanted was for Hogwarts to be exactly as it used to. A part of him wanted to run, to run so fast he’d find himself back in time. Despite the haunting past, and the painful future looming ahead, the present always seemed like the worst to deal with.</p><p>They were all still tormented by the war, and all Harry wanted were for things to go back to normal. Well, that was probably too much to ask for, and he hardly knew what normal meant anymore.</p><p>“Harry? Are you listening?” A hand waved frantically in front of his face, dizzying his once focused eyes and drawing them away from a mop of white blond on the Slytherin table.</p><p>His harshly chewed lips mumbled out a weak reply, “Yep.” It was obvious that Hermione realised Harry wasn’t paying much attention at all, and she quickly gave up on trying again to capture Harry’s attention, instead focusing on giving her boyfriend the lecture on taking their N.E.W.Ts seriously. It had been almost two months since they returned for an eighth year at Hogwarts to properly finish their education, and Harry often found himself caught up in his own thoughts, always having to reach for his mind and force it back into its own tired skull.</p><p>Harry only realised how intensely he must’ve been staring when Draco’s eyes suddenly flitted over to his direction, holding a swirl of uneasiness and surprise. The blond looked away so quickly Harry would’ve missed the initial glance if he hadn’t been observing so closely for so long.</p><p>Letting out a silent breath, Harry lowered his gaze and returned to his breakfast of thickly buttered hot toast and pan fresh bacon rashers. Not all of them had returned for Eighth Year, not all of them had <em>survived.</em> Harry winced at the thought, and then forced his head to empty itself from the horrific images. Many had lost loved ones and wanted no more of Hogwarts to serve as a raw, painful reminder. His eyes prickled as he thought of Professor Lupin and Fred, Dobby and Sirius. Others were forbidden out of fear by their parents, and others were disgraced by their families. Of the Slytherins, there was only Malfoy and two other girls who he didn’t seem to be friends with, or even be acquainted with.</p><p>Malfoy. In all honesty, Harry didn’t think that he, of all people, would be back. Malfoy was back, but he was only some placid ghost-like version of himself, and Harry hated it. Malfoy didn’t sneer or taunt or even talk anymore, all that was left were the occasional distant glances that vaporised the moment Harry caught them. There was some unspoken civility between the two of them, but it wasn’t comfortable at all. Maybe he missed the sense of ease that used to exist when he had time to be bothered about Malfoy’s childish antics. Besides, the dismal look in Draco’s eyes didn’t suit him one bit.</p><p>“I’m gonna get going to Potions first,” Harry pulled his heavy limbs out of his seat and gave Ron and Hermione, whose hands were clasped together over the table, a simple, forced smile. They nodded, and a familiar wave of sadness washed over Harry when he found his own sorrow reflected in his best friends’ eyes.</p><p>Hermione was in his Potions class too, but he often preferred walking alone, it gave him more time to think. And he didn’t have to feel guilty about mindlessly ignoring his friends. Plus, Hermione and Ron were better left alone together. Hermione knew how to comfort Ron with soft words that Harry sometimes privately took for himself, when he sat there brooding, and they thought that he probably hadn’t been listening.</p><p>Since Harry was early, the Potions classroom was deserted, and he took his usual seat at the table in the back corner of the room. He breathed in the comforting silence, running a finger along the cracked wooden desk from right to left then back, and again and again. It wasn’t long before another figure entered the room, and Harry twisted his head round to the door. It was Malfoy.</p><p>Malfoy took slow, relaxed steps towards Harry’s table and sat down. Opposite him. But as much as Harry stared, unknowingly, because Malfoy never showed recognition or discomfort, neither of them spoke a word to the other. In fact, Malfoy didn’t even acknowledge Harry’s existence. His eyes landed on anywhere but Harry; he stared at the desk, at the door, into space. Never Harry.</p><p>It had been like that since their first day back. In their first Potions class, Harry and Hermione had sat down together, and Parvati had joined them not long after. It seemed that the Eighth Year students had often bundled together in their classes, since they were now grouped up with the Seventh Years. Perhaps if he and Ginny hadn’t been avoiding each other, then her and Luna would’ve been sitting on his table instead. Instead of Malfoy. But no, Ginny had walked in and promptly tugged Luna away from Harry’s table, and across to the other side of the room. And it just so happened that Malfoy turned up marginally late for class. Harry still remembered the unnatural, flustered look on his face when he had glanced around the classroom, searching for a space. It was four to a table, Malfoy clearly knew none of the seventh years, and in what must have been an impulsive decision, Malfoy had hastily sat himself down next to Parvati, opposite Harry.</p><p><em>‘Are you just going to keep ignoring me?’</em> Harry wanted to grumble out, but he held back, just like he did every time he came close to Malfoy. Instead, he settled with staring. Staring and staring and staring, he would stare at Malfoy until he couldn’t take it anymore, until he finally said something. He would stare him into oblivion. Or the opposite. Maybe he could stare Malfoy back to life. Somehow, Harry felt like something would happen if he just willed it strongly enough in his mind and with his concentrated vision. So far, in the past two months, Harry had been wrong.</p><p>Students began to filter into the classroom, yet Harry kept his eyes on Malfoy. On his pale, worn complexion and bright blond strands of hair, the ones that fell over his forehead and seemed to tangle with his fluttering eyelashes.</p><p>“Hi, Harry,” came a familiar, ethereal voice. Finally, Harry unlatched his attention from the boy in front of him and found Luna smiling at him from across the room, next to Ginny. Harry muttered back a polite greeting and hurriedly turned away.</p><p>“Harry,” Hermione’s voice descended on his other side, and he looked over to give her a smile. “Don’t you think you ought to have talked to Ginny by now?” Harry’s parted lips looked like he wanted to object. He was mildly aware of Malfoy’s attention from across the table. “I know it’s not my business what actually goes on between you two, but as your friend, <em>and</em> Ginny’s friend, I think you ought to at least give her some sort of closure, as it seems to be going down that route,” she explained with that familiar, expressive tone of voice. The corners of Harry’s lips lifted at the thought of Hermione’s way of speaking to be something that would always remain. “Why are you smiling?”</p><p>“Nothing,” he shook his head lightly, “and I will talk to her. Just not… Just not right now.”</p><p>When Harry turned to face Professor Slughorn who had finally arrived to begin the class, he failed to catch Malfoy’s gaze yet again, despite knowing, quite surely, that Malfoy had been looking at him just moments before.</p><p> </p><p>After spending the lesson concocting a Blood-Replenishing Potion, in which Hermione had become increasingly annoyed by Malfoy’s natural talents, whilst Harry’s irritation was stemmed more from Malfoy’s strange unwillingness to brag, Harry headed down to Herbology with Hermione. Fortunately, Ginny didn’t take Herbology, but neither did Malfoy.</p><p>As they strolled down the corridors, Harry once again had to avoid the gawking among the crowds of students. First years, second years, every single student seemed to be watching Harry every time he found himself in even a mildly public place. This unpleasant phenomenon had begun when they first came back to Hogwarts, and astonishingly, its effect had hardly diminished in the past two months. It was like people didn’t get tired of his dull green eyes and dark nest of hair like he did himself every time he caught a glimpse of his own reflection. Not to mention, that scar.</p><p> </p><p>“Ginny.” It had been a week since Hermione had reminded Harry to talk to her, and it just so happened that Ginny was at the top of the flight of stairs Harry was heading up, coming down. There was no avoiding it now. Harry ran up the steps, two at a time, trying to think of a regular way to start the conversation. It was kind of an awkward situation. Harry had broken up with her at the end of Sixth Year, with the explanation that he had important things to do on his own, and she had understood. But since the war ended, things didn’t just <em>unpause</em>, Harry didn’t know how it was possible to just go back like that. And as much as Harry felt guilty to admit it, that wasn’t the only reason. He no longer saw clusters of stars in her eyes, no longer thought about the striking, warm shade of her ginger hair, or even the flowery scent she carried so lightly in the air around her. And he wasn’t sure if he ever truly did. He supposed this was something that Ginny wouldn’t understand if he didn’t explain. He owed it to her.</p><p>“Ginny,” he repeated, letting out a nervous breath. She was watching him tensely, her body stiff, but still, there was tenderness in her eyes and Harry appreciated that. “I uh, I realised that we should probably… talk.” He finished the sentence awkwardly, feeling like stating the obvious was making him seem incredibly stupid, and therefore increasingly less ready to say what he had to say.</p><p>Her lips folded into a small frown. “I know what you’re going to say. It just would’ve been nicer to hear from you sooner,” she said honestly.</p><p>A pang of guilt struck Harry in the chest as he remained a step below her on the staircase. “You do?”</p><p>“I can see the pity in your face, and really, I don’t need it.” Ginny’s words seemed blunt, like an unsharpened spear grinding into Harry’s heart, but she let out a soft sigh. “If you still wanted… us, you would’ve said so, ages ago. I’ve been avoiding you because I didn’t want you to be uncomfortable. Honestly, I’m past it.”</p><p>“Really?” Harry felt relief settle inside him, but he wanted to make sure, with absolute certainty, that Ginny was okay with it.</p><p>Finally, she smiled. And Harry smiled too, his teeth releasing his bottom lip from its grip. “Just promise me that you’ll find someone who makes you happy.” Her voice was so low now that it came out as a whisper, and then they both let out a tiny snort at how cliché the words were. Instead of a reply, Harry simply wrapped both arms around her, and let himself sink into the peaceful warmth. “And that we’ll stay friends,” she added, neither letting go of their comforting embrace.</p><p>“Of course,” Harry promised, patting her hair. “Of course we- I can’t believe you had to ask that,” he grinned bitterly into her hair, “Who was it that I rescued so desperately from the Chamber of Secrets? Who was it that made a brilliant seeker for the Gryffindor team while I was banned? Who was it that lead Dumbledore’s Army when I was away?” He felt her smile against his shoulder, her head dipped low. “Even though we aren’t… together, anymore, you’ll always be special to me Ginny.” And suddenly, Harry felt like he was going to cry. Not just with the memories surging through his heavy mind, but to realise that this was truly another end to something… Perhaps that was why it had taken him so long to talk to Ginny. Harry pressed his tears away with a heavy blink. </p><p>Just before he was about to pull away, the sound of regal, yet quiet steps ascended the staircase, and Harry lifted his head from Ginny’s shoulder to watch as Draco Malfoy passed the pair of them without even a sign of acknowledgment.</p><p>Harry lurched himself away from Ginny, eyes fixed on Draco’s rapidly disappearing figure. “So I’ll see you later then,” the words spilled from his lips in a rush, and Ginny looked rather startled for a moment. “I mean,” his attention was still darting from Ginny to Draco and back repetitively. “I’ve got Transfiguration, and lunch is about to end so-”</p><p>She smiled understandingly, gave Harry an assuring pat on the shoulder and shifted past him down the stairs. Without a second thought, Harry made a hurried dash to catch up with Malfoy. He wasn’t entirely sure why, but they were in the same Transfiguration class so there wasn’t really a reason not to walk behind Malfoy and… stay three paces behind him the entire time.</p><p>Strangely, Malfoy was taking a detour, probably well aware of Harry behind him. Still, like always, he didn’t say anything, and Harry was stuck once again trying to wonder what was going to induce the familiar drawl he hadn’t heard in what seemed like a long, long time. <em>‘What are you doing behind me, Potter?’</em> Malfoy could scowl at Harry with resentment, and Harry could smoothly reply, <em>‘going to Transfiguration, obviously.’</em> Except he couldn’t, because Malfoy didn’t say anything the entire journey to classroom 1B. Screw him.</p><p> </p><p>“You did what, mate?” Ron asked between large mouthfuls of his roasted chicken drumstick, face instilled with shock and horror. Harry hadn’t expected Ron to look so… displeased about the situation, so he could barely find his voice for a moment. A wave of guilt sank through him yet again.</p><p>Luckily, Hermione answered for him. “Broke up with Ginny officially, <em>finally</em>,” she emphasised at the end even though Ron turned to face her with an utterly scandalised expression. She went on. “Harry did the right thing, Ron! It’s not right to lead people on like he was doing for the past few months.” Another stab of guilt.</p><p>Ron chewed down his mouthful and took a large swig of pumpkin juice, before finally speaking. “I mean, okay, yeah, good on you mate, getting things together and all. But like, bloody hell, I just always thought- Well, when you were going out with my sister I guess I realised that there wasn’t anyone else better out there. If anyone deserved to be with her, it would be you mate.”</p><p>The honesty and respect in Ron’s words pushed a smile onto Harry’s lips, whose eyes widened just a little in pleasant surprise. “Thanks,” Harry responded, eyes flitting between Ron and Hermione, who was staring at Ron tenderly. “And sorry too,” he added a little quieter, poking the potatoes on his plate with his fork.</p><p>Before Ron could respond, the three of them spotted Ginny heading down the Gryffindor table, sporting an overly large grin. “Hey guys,” she beamed, swooping down onto the seat right next to Harry. “I’m starving, Quidditch practice ran over, our new keeper is a <em>disaster</em>, I mean no offense, they’re only a third year, but it’s tough without you two,” she rambled a little unnaturally, and poured a whole load of hot chips onto her plate before digging in eagerly.</p><p>Ginny’s arrival (she was still fully clad in her Quidditch uniform, strands of her fiery ginger hair clinging to her face from the sweat) reminded Harry of the longing that he had to play Quidditch competitively again. The Eighth Years were no longer allowed to be on the formal house teams, so that meant if Harry wanted to play, he’d only have lunch times and free periods, which were highly inconvenient to gather enough people to from two teams. Mostly, opportunities arose during the weekend. Still, it wasn’t the same. He really, really missed it. He missed the wind blowing through his hair, he missed the feeling of streaking so close to the sky, swooping up and down so intensely that his stomach would squeeze and twist and flip, hearing the crowd’s blazing roars in the background. He wanted it back.</p><p>“Hermione, Harry!” Parvati’s frantic voice cut into Ginny’s elaborate explanation of the new team formation. The four of them all looked up to see Parvati’s troubled expression, her lips twisting apologetically. “I wanted to ask for a favour,” she began.</p><p>Hermione’s expression told her to go on, and Harry had put down his cutlery to listen carefully too. “Well, I- it’s about Potions class.” The image of a tall, blond figure instantly ran through Harry’s mind, but he shook it away. Parvati was fumbling with her fingers now, and she plonked herself down next to Ron. “I didn’t want to ask this but, would it be okay if we switched Potions partners? I mean, if I could partner with Hermione instead, and Harry if you could go with Malfoy… I just! He doesn’t speak, I mean sure he’s smart, but he always seems so irritable, and well, scary. I really didn’t want to make a fuss but I already tried bearing with it for two months, and it’s not really working out…”</p><p>Harry had pretty much stopped listening at the mention of Malfoy’s name. Potions partners with Malfoy? That would give Harry a chance to speak with him, finally. Not that he was sure why he needed so desperately to talk to Malfoy, but Harry couldn’t help squirming at the thought of how smoothly things just fell into place.</p><p>“Put Harry with <em>Malfoy?</em>” Ron’s eyes bulged out of its sockets, his tone incredulous. Even Hermione looked concerned. “You’ll end up getting blown up from across the table I’m sure, those two wouldn’t last three seconds next to each other before one gets put in the hospital wing and the other in McGonagall’s offi-”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Harry interrupted, and turned to Parvati politely, “we can switch seats starting from our next Potions lesson if you’d like.”</p><p>Her eyes sparkled with gratitude, whilst Ron, Hermione and Ginny all rocked their heads forward in disbelief, eyebrows raised in synchrony. “Thank you, Harry!” Parvati gave a smile to Hermione too, who managed to pause her expression of shock at Harry and return the smile before Parvati skipped out of the Great Hall contentedly.</p><p>“So you’re really taking this civil and toned down front that Malfoy’s got going seriously? You don’t think he’ll try something?”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes at Ron, “Malfoy has barely spoken to me this entire year,” he reminded him with slight bitterness. “Also, you seem to have forgotten that Malfoy’s bed happens to be right next to mine, and that no, despite your adamant accusations, he hasn’t once tried to attack me in my sleep.”</p><p>Ron slowly sank back into his chair slowly, his mouth twisting thoughtfully. “Well we’ll be ready for it when he does try something,” he grumbled under his breath.</p><p>Shaking his head with a hint of amusement, Harry closed up into his own thoughts again. It wasn’t like Malfoy had strategically picked the bed next to his or anything. In fact, Harry was the one who chose the bed next to Malfoy’s. It had happened their first day back, when the Eighth Years were settling into their new common room and dormitories, and him and Ron had run up to claim their beds a little late. The spaces were all chosen, and Malfoy had opted for the corner, furthest from the door and everyone else. Clearly, all the other boys had also chosen to steer clear of Malfoy, so the two remaining beds were the one next to Malfoy, and the one next to that. Knowing that Ron would most definitely complain if he had to sleep in such close proximity to Malfoy every night, Harry had decided, as what he deemed a heroic act, to sacrifice himself and take up the unwanted bed next to Malfoy’s.</p><p>“When do we next have Potions, Hermione?” Harry asked, when Ginny and Ron had resumed their conversation on the new Gryffindor Quidditch team.</p><p>“Tomorrow morning,” she gave him a pitying expression, but he replied with a smile instead.</p><p> </p><p>When sleep in its usual form of haunted cries and green light drifted away from Harry the next morning, his eyes shifted open blearily to stare blankly at his neighbouring bed. Malfoy had already gotten out of bed. Just like usual. Harry always saw Malfoy fall asleep, with his back turned to Harry and his long limbs tucked close to himself, but he never ever saw Malfoy in the morning. He was always gone by the time Harry opened his eyes. One time, Harry thought he saw a mess of white blond dipped between the bed sheets when he first awoke, but by the time his vision cleared, Malfoy was nowhere to be seen.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was strangely excited for Potions, he had been since Parvati requested the favour of swapping partners. He just desperately wanted to see the look that was going to be scrawled over Malfoy’s sharp, irritated face.</p><p>And there he was. Slouched in his usual seat, entirely unsuspecting as Harry strolled into class with Hermione and Parvati right behind him. Moving swiftly, Harry took large strides past his own seat and towards the one next to Malfoy. He felt the blond tense up, but still he made no effort to look or say anything. The two girls took their seats opposite, and it only took Draco a glance at the two to confirm his suspicions. Harry confidently pulled the stool out and plonked himself down.</p><p>“Change of partners, Malfoy,” he said. Finally. His first words to Malfoy in what felt like an eternity. Harry delivered them like he was letting out a breath he’d been holding in for a long, long time. And then, with a motion that caused Harry’s chest to swell, Malfoy tilted his head to the left, and Harry finally caught his grey eyes.</p><p>“Right,” Malfoy’s drawl ended as soon as it began, and Harry’s frustration kicked in again the moment Malfoy turned his head away, looking like he was so bored, with his left cheek caged in his hand and an expression so bland, Harry thought he might have imagined their interaction just now. Wasn’t Malfoy going to ask why they were partners now? <em>‘Right’</em>? Was that really the only thing he had to say? Couldn’t he have thrown in a scornful ‘Potter’ at the very least?</p><p>Harry didn’t really like this new Draco Malfoy at all.</p><p>Professor Slughorn had instructed them to brew Draught of Peace, something that Harry remembered failing tremendously at during fifth year. So it clearly wasn’t going to go any better when his partner refused to speak to him. They only worked in pairs when brewing advanced potions, with many ingredients that were limited and irritatingly specific instructions. Harry honestly had no idea how he and Malfoy were ever going to get through it all. Malfoy had already walked off silently, and only by observing him closely did Harry realise he had gone to fetch the ingredients. So now he was left waiting by the table, looking like an idiot.</p><p>Halfway through glaring at Malfoy’s back while he was crouched over a particular shelf still searching for ingredients, Harry caught Ginny’s eye at the desk on the opposite side of the room. She looked a little surprised when their eyes locked, but Harry gave her a firm smile. She returned it, just barely.</p><p>“Don’t touch anything, Potter,” Malfoy snarled as emotionlessly as he could when Harry began to grab at the ingredients upon his return. Harry dropped all his attention from the worktable in front of him and everything on it, instead focusing on Malfoy and his words and his lips, the way he said Potter. Harry was waiting for his next remark, hopefully something witty and scathing. But Malfoy didn’t say anything else. No irritating quip on Harry’s apparent lacking Potions skills. Nothing.</p><p>“Oops,” Harry let out dramatically, halfway between brewing what would’ve been a perfect potion otherwise, “looks like I accidentally added a bit too much powdered unicorn horn.” He snuck a look at Malfoy. Malfoy was seething, almost as much as the boiling potion in front of them, which turned a muddy shade of orange rather than the desired pink. Without saying anything, Draco took control over their cauldron again as Harry watched the snarl on his face for signs of movement, something that indicated he was going to talk.</p><p>“Aren’t you mad?” Harry asked with a hint of frustration, stood off to the side and burning an uncontrollable glare into Malfoy’s back.</p><p>There was a pause, and Malfoy stopped stirring for a moment, as if to digest the question, “…Yes Potter, I’m fucking mad.” And Harry decided that he must be the one who’s mad, as in insane, because that familiar spark of irritation in Malfoy’s voice, no matter how suppressed, peeled Harry’s gloominess away immediately.</p><p> </p><p>Draco was still puzzling over Potter’s behaviour by the end of third period. What the fuck was up with Potter? He must have been in a scarily good mood, since when did he start joking around like that? Potter <em>hated</em> him. He was so lost in his thoughts hurrying down the stairs, that he missed a step and embarrassingly tumbled forwards.</p><p>“Fuck!” He cursed, knocking into a sturdy figure who caught him by the waist. Draco momentarily came to the realisation that the stranger’s arms were wrapped much too tightly and intimately around himself, a hand even resting on the small of his back.</p><p>“Malfoy?” The sound of Weasley’s voice made Draco jump, yanking himself out of the arms of his saviour. <em>Potter</em>. Just his bloody luck. Potter was blinking rapidly, his dark hair an outrageous mess. Draco’s cheeks turned even pinker. He averted his gaze from Potter’s bright green eyes to Weasley, who was scowling next to him.</p><p>Heart throbbing, Draco scrambled to pick up his dropped pile of books and hurried past, knocking into Potter’s shoulder as he did so, ignoring the tingling warmth on his body where Potter’s hands had been.</p><p> </p><p>“Someone’s in a good mood,” Ron let himself down onto the floor and shuffled closer towards Harry. He was huddled next to the fireplace in their Eighth Year common room with his legs tucked close to his torso and his arms wrapped around his knees. It was actually a spot he visited often when he wanted to think, <em>needed</em> to think. Something about the toasty heat and golden flickers of light made it safe to think cold, grey thoughts in his head. If there was fire around him, he could afford to let it rain inside him. This time however, he didn’t have Fred or Dobby or Sirius in his head. He had Malfoy. Considering his icy demeanour, Malfoy should’ve been a bitter thought, but he wasn’t. He just wasn’t.</p><p>“He’s been like that since Potions this morning,” another voice joined them, and Harry didn’t need to look up to know that it was Hermione.</p><p>“Hey guys,” he smiled, brushing off their comments about his mood as he tucked his legs to the side for Hermione to sit down. However, the looks on their faces seemed to indicate an unwavering curiosity as to why Harry wasn’t so dreary during the day. “Stop looking at me with such expectant faces.” The last conversation Harry needed to have with his friends was why Malfoy’s attention seemed to lift his spirits.</p><p>“It’s just nice to see you look less like the living dead, Harry,” Hermione placed a comforting hand on Harry’s shoulder, and he smiled a little wider.</p><p>“The same goes for you two,” he replied honestly.</p><p>“What’s that?” Ron asked, gesturing to the book in Harry’s hand.</p><p>Harry cracked a smile, “It’s Draco’s Potions textbook. He dropped it earlier. When he fell down the stairs.”</p><p>“And you haven’t returned it to him because...”</p><p>“I will. I just haven’t had the chance yet.” Harry hadn’t seen Draco since the incident, apart from in the Great Hall at dinner. Draco had appeared so flustered when he pushed Harry away, it was almost funny.</p><p>Ron spoke up again, “Oh right, Seamus and Dean have a couple bottles of firewhiskey to share and I was gonna ask if you wanted to join. Pretty much everyone’s up for getting wasted.” Harry nodded, getting up from the floor.</p><p>Soon, most of the Eighth Year students, Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws and even the two Slytherin girls were sprawled in a messy circle on the common room floor. Harry was sat between Neville, who was drunkenly leaning on Harry, and Ron, who wasn’t paying much attention to the group conversation at all due to a preoccupation with whispering into Hermione’s flushed ear and squeezing her hand softly.</p><p>“And yeah, McGonagall was fucking furious, and it was awfully embarrassing as well,” Seamus pressed a hand to the side of his flushed face as a memory of the story he was telling came to mind, “But well, probably worth the week’s detentions I got, I guess.” He finished with a lazy grin, adjusting his position so that his elbows propped him up a little higher from the carpeted floor than before.</p><p>Anthony Goldstein from across the circle let out an impressed laugh, “You really don’t care about the rules anymore do you?” As Eighth Years, they found that they often got away with a lot more than the other years, sometimes even treated like they weren’t official students. Still, they didn’t choose to abuse that opportunity. Not often, anyway.</p><p>“I almost died last year, and so did the rest of us- If I want something, I’m gonna get it. Not cause I think nearly dying is cause for special treatment, but just realising that someday it might be too late to do some things, have some things. We deserve to go after what we want. We deserve normality,” he rambled in a strangely coherent and philosophical manner, despite the level of intoxication he was experiencing.</p><p>Harry took in those words slowly and carefully, his mind was already hazy from the firewhiskey, and trying to process such profound messages wasn’t helping clear his head. Something about deserving to get what one wanted. What did Harry want? He wanted… Well, he wanted simplicity. And innocence. He didn’t like the mind that was marred with the images of Voldemort, damaged by memories of loved ones who had died right in front of his eyes. His head hurt.</p><p>“Harry,” Neville’s sleepy yet determined voice caught Harry’s attention. “I hope you get what you want, you deserve it. Lots,” Neville’s voice seemed to slip towards the end, voice descending into a series of incoherent mumbles, but Harry smiled at him earnestly.</p><p>“I think I’ll call it a night guys,” Harry turned to the rest of the group, gently easing Neville off himself, “My head hurts like hell,” he added as coherently as possible, which in fact wasn’t very coherent at all. There were slurred, synchronised ‘awww’s as Harry got up unsteadily, wobbling his way to the stairs leading to the boys’ dorm. No one else seemed to think they needed to sleep yet, so Harry wandered up the stairs alone.</p><p>When Harry shoved open the door to the dorm, he spotted a single figure sat up in his bed in the corner of the room, seemingly absorbed in a book. A figure who made no sign of acknowledgment to Harry’s arrival. A figure whose blond hair seemed to be illuminated by the glowing moon hanging outside the window.</p><p>“<em>Malfoy</em>,” Harry stormed towards their beds as well as he could, though he was sure he must have stumbled stupidly into a few obstacles on the way. His voice was full of intent, despite his lack of awareness and direction as to where exactly this was going. “Malfoy,” he repeated, this time louder, when Malfoy didn’t seem to have paid him enough attention. Apparently a glance and a curious tilt of the head wasn’t enough for Harry.</p><p>“Nice to see that you know how to keep it classy when you’re drunk, Potter.” A snarky comment. Good. But it wasn’t enough.</p><p>“What you reading there, Malfoy? Some dumb book- is it interesting?” Harry rambled stupidly.</p><p>Draco didn’t know how to respond to that one. But he stood, rising out of his bed to face a drunken Potter.</p><p>Potter seemed to be spurred on by some surge of sudden courage inside him, he took another step forward and grabbed Draco by his shirt, fisting it and pulling the Slytherin towards himself. “Malfoy,” he repeated, shouting into his face. Draco leaned back a little. “Are you dead?” His voice came out quieter this time, almost as a whisper, as if asking Draco to tell him a secret, but the ridiculousness of the question made it sound just as bold.</p><p>“Huh?” Draco’s eyes dropped low to search for the expression on Potter’s face, as he was staring intently at Malfoy’s chest. “Potter-”</p><p>“You don’t even talk anymore,” Potter continued in that quiet, defeated voice. If it hadn’t been so quiet, Draco might not have heard him. And so, even though Draco did indeed hear those words, he couldn’t be sure he hadn’t just imagined them. The underlying meaning, the request, the hope and the sadness weaved into Potter’s tone of voice; Potter wanted Draco to talk to him. But that couldn’t be right. Draco couldn’t bring himself to utter a reply, he was still debating the possibility that he had misheard, or imagined the entire moment.</p><p>But he had quite surely watched those words leave Potter’s lips, the lips that he’d stolen glances at over the years, the ones he’d guiltily thought about over and over again. And of all the fantasies that Draco had explored, the one happening now had never, ever even crossed his mind. A fantasy where Harry’s lips weren’t pressed against Draco’s skin, but whispering words that might’ve seemed normal if uttered in simply a different tone, or at a different moment, or to a different person. But <em>this</em>.</p><p>“Why don’t you talk anymore?” Harry’s voice rose again in frustration, snapping Draco out of his thoughts.</p><p>Draco cleared his throat and took a breath, “I’m very much alive, thank you,” he answered, purposely ignoring the other question. Potter was still gripping his shirt and shaking him wildly, so Draco grabbed Potter’s forearms and pushed him away harshly. He couldn’t just give in like that and make a fool of himself.</p><p>“Are you, though?” The way Potter’s voice came out caused Draco to freeze instantly. It was broken. And so, so vulnerable. Fuck. Why the hell was Potter doing this all of a sudden? Acting so strange, as if he cared about Draco, as if he thought of Draco as much as Draco thought of him.</p><p>“Stop it, Potter,” Draco whispered out weakly, though full of irritation and almost anger. And he did. Potter did stop saying awful, confusing things, but then he moved. Draco froze. Potter was closing the narrow gap between them, coming so close that Draco wasn’t sure if he was still breathing anymore. His heart was beating so fast in the silent blackness of the night, the wild palpitations and rapid pulses were bursting so loudly in his ear, he was so sure that Potter could hear it too. “What are you doing?” Draco breathed out, feeling unable to keep his composure. Potter had one hand clasped tightly over Draco’s wrist, and the side of his head was pressed against Draco’s chest.</p><p>“Shhh,” Potter hushed, his other hand wrapping around Draco to press steadily against his back. “I’m checking if you’re alive,” he whispered as if the answer was obvious. Draco’s expression crinkled in confusion for a second, and then, oh. Oh. Potter was checking for his pulse, his heartbeat. The one that was hammering against his chest at record speed. Shit. Draco shoved Potter away with full force, who barely steadied himself by holding on still, with one hand.</p><p>“Malfoy!”</p><p>Draco had no space to back away, “What do you want, Potter?” He wasn’t sure if he really did want him to answer that one.</p><p>“Why are you being civil? Why aren’t you trying to piss me off anymore?”</p><p>After a long moment of silence, Draco finally spoke up. “…Are you fucking shitting me?” His voice was pulled by fire, the rage apparent in its rough tone. “You’re saying you preferred it when I was- I was- I was awful to your best friends, I said disgusting things about you and your parents, I- I even-” Malfoy winced, recalling the horrid things he’d done over the years. He couldn’t comprehend Harry’s logic at all, and he threw his hands wildly to his hair, scrunching and raking with frustration. </p><p>“And here I was thinking that you, the saviour, would appreciate some fucking peace. Forget it Potter, things are different now. You’re mad if you’re asking why I’m not giving you shit anymore. I held allegiance to the ones who wanted you killed, and you saved my life. I’m not about to go making a new batch of ‘Potter stinks’ badges am I?”</p><p>Harry stood there, stunned, and Draco had no idea whether Harry had understood any of that in his drunken state, but he both hoped he had and hadn’t. He never meant to have any kind of emotional outburst in front of Potter, it was fucking embarrassing. Finally, Harry, with his voice suddenly soft and sensible, responded, “Yeah, you went too far sometimes. And I really did fucking hate you for that- But the rest, that’s okay- I’d rather have those badges to worry about than think about everyone that- everyone that’s been lost.”</p><p>Draco felt his tongue tie in his mouth. He didn’t know what to say, he jerked out of Potter’s grip, shoving him backwards and sending him toppling onto his own bed. He stood for a moment, frozen, unable to think or speak, only managing to stare at the figure beneath him. Harry fucking Potter. Why was he always so much trouble for Draco?</p><p>Hastily, Draco draped Potter’s blanket over his exhausted figure, ignoring the small, indignant cry of ‘Malfoy’ before climbing back into his own bed in a hurry. “Get some sleep Potter, you need it,” he grumbled out before flipping onto his side to face the wall, and not Potter.</p>
