    <p>“Lupin! You’re up!” </p><p>A guard yelled from the dark hallway outside the cell. A battered man stared to the door. He was chained to the back wall and forced to sit on the ground. Shadows bounced around outside, created by the light that flooded through the hallways’ barred windows. The light from the small window in the door of the sandstone cell light dimly illuminated the space in front of the man. The light source was quickly blocked by a tall figure.</p><p>“Remus Lupin?”</p><p>Remus glared at the guard</p><p>“He’s still here?! Most of these monsters don’t last longer than a few days!”</p><p>Another guard said.</p><p>“He’s been here for a few weeks. He doesn’t fight. For some reason the audience likes him enough to keep him around. One day he’s going to go up against one of them that’ll knock his head off.”</p><p>The guards laughed as they opened the cell, uncuffed Remus and, and led him down the hall. He was brought to a pair of giant stone doors. They opened slowly, letting the blinding light fill the hallway. Once the door was open fully Remus was shoved out into a huge arena. The light dirt floors stirred up dust as he fell from the push. The dust flew up and entered his lungs causing him to cough. He stood to his feet and dusted off the light dirt that had settled on the brown tunic, the color now faded from the weeks of wear. The area was also used as a theater. Remus had snuck some of the young cubs in to see a play many times before as a moral booster. The performers today, however, were replaced with victims, beaten and slaughtered by one another for the entertainment of the elite. The general public were cheering and booing in the thousands of seats. Higher in the audience were seats designated for the most prestigious families and the Emperor. The Emperor sat in the middle of the audience surrounded by his family. Emperor Black and his wife regularly attended these battles, but there was a third seat occupied by a man about Remus’s age. The three of them sat side-by-side in decorative thrones. Each of them draped in clean bright white robes with hints of golden thread. The Emperor and his wife sat elegantly and professionally in their chairs. The young man, however, sat with his back against the left arm of the decorated seat. His right foot sat on the seat all while other leg swung from the chair. The robe he was wearing was long enough to cover his body despite his promiscuous position. Even if something were to be seen, the young man, Remus thought, probably wouldn’t have cared. He was looking out into space, not paying much attention to the fight until the crowd fell quiet. It was the silence that made Remus realize he was staring at the young man.</p><p>“The Challenger, Remus Lupin!”</p><p>The crowd went into an uproar. Remus scanned the audience as a force of habit. He turned his attention to the Royal section. His eyes met the young man’s and stopped.<br/>
Sirius stared down at the boy in the arena. Everything about him peaked his interest. Sirius hated going to these things, seeing no entertainment in pointless violence. The thoughts of the fight almost faded completely when Sirius saw the challenger. He was young, definitely fit, and Sirius couldn’t help but wonder what he did to get in here. The thoughts in his head brought and coy smirk to his face. He bit his lip when he saw the challenger staring back at him. A red tint covered the man’s face as he turned his eyes away.</p><p>“And our champion! Fenrir Greyback!”</p><p>The crowd went into a frenzy as a large man walked towards Remus. He rose his fists in the air and slowly rotated, giving the crowd a better look at him. And evil smile filled the man’s face when he saw Remus</p><p>“Well, well, well.” he said</p><p>“If it isn’t the wayward cub. You have a great power you know, you’re just too stupid to use it.”</p><p>He began to circle Remus. Remus followed his every move. He hadn’t attacked yet but Remus had a feeling he would, and soon. The dirt stirred next to Fenrir’s foot as a guard threw something to him. A Morningstar lay at his side. They both glanced at the weapon and then at one another. Remus jumped for it but Fenrir was much closer, Remus didn’t get too far. Fenrir swung the weapon in circles with a menacing smile on his face.</p><p>“I knew you were a rat the day you found us.”</p><p>Remus said still matching Fenrir movements.</p><p>“They trusted you. There are so few of us. Why would you turn on your people! We’re being hunted like mon-!”</p><p>Remus was interrupted when Fenrir stomped forward in one step. His sharp teeth showing behind an animalistic smile.</p><p>“Like monsters?!” He shouted. He was only a few feet away from him. Remus’s eyes widened in fear.</p><p>“Like the abominations we are?! Do you know nothing of this world?” He began to talk softly, so that only Remus could hear him in the huge arena.</p><p>“They hunt us because they fear us. They fear us because they know our power. If they think we are under their control, we can destroy them from the inside.”</p><p>Remus slowly stepped back.</p><p>“So is that what you’re doing? Manipulating the emperor?”</p><p>“No. He treats me well, leaves me be. I’m merely enjoying the privilege of killing with weakness of our race. I see no need for a revolution.”<br/>
Fenrir slowly stepped closer.</p><p>“You may be strong young one. But if you wish to make a change,” He lifted the Morningstar above his head and shouted.</p><p>“Learn your place!”</p><p>He swung quickly, Remus barely dodged it. Fenrir went to swing again when the crowd went quiet.<br/>
They all turned to look at the emperor who had his hand raised, bringing the fight to a halt. The young man next to him was leaning over the throne to whisper something in his ear. The Emperor scowl before turning to his son.</p><p>“You can’t possibly be sincere about this?” Orion whispered sneering at the black haired boy.</p><p>“Oh my,” Sirius started mockingly.</p><p>“Is the great Orion Black going back on his word?” He looked at his father with innocent eyes.</p><p>The Emperor scowl and beckoned the guard to him. Fenrir stared up at the crowd watching the Emperor. Remus was afraid that Fenrir would attack again so he only watched through his peripheral vision. The guard in the stands quickly disappeared behind the seats. A few minutes later two guards walked into the ring and shackled Remus’s hands behind his back.</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing?!” Fenrir asked angrily through gritting teeth.</p><p>“Orders of the Emperor we are taking him back to the palace.” One of the guards informed him, being quiet enough for only Fenrir to hear.</p><p>Fenrir turned and looked at Orion as he swung his MorningStar casually before tossing it to the side and stomping back inside the Coliseum’s halls.<br/>
Remus was tied up in a cart pulled by two horses whose gold reigns sparkled brilliantly in the hot sun. Remus was overcome with terror and nervousness. What on earth would Emperor Black want with him? Was he to be tortured? Was he to be made an example of? Other werewolves have been disappearing for so long Remus feared that he may be the next. The two guards led Remus to a small house behind the palace. In the house were around 10 female slaves quickly running around bumping into each other while doing their chores.</p><p>“Make this one presentable, Master Sirius wants him in his chambers immediately.”</p><p>An older woman walked up to the guard that was speaking. She nodded and the guards released Remus from his shackles. The lady held out her hand, which Remus then grabbed, and the guards left quickly. All of the girls stopped to stare at Remus as if he were the most peculiar thing they had ever seen. The older woman smiled at Remus.</p><p>“My name is Minerva but all of the girls call me mother. We take care of our own and you are one of us now. I was told you would be arriving.”</p><p>Remus was afraid to make eye contact. Minerva grabbed his chin with her index finger and thumb lifting his head up. She inspected his face pulling down his bottom lip exposing his sharp wolf like teeth. Minerva smiled softly.</p><p>“You are safe now,” she started “Master Sirius is the kindest of the Black family. He will not hurt you. Now please come with me and let’s get you cleaned up.”</p><p>Remus nodded silently and followed Minerva to another small house behind the servants’ quarters. Minerva carefully bathed him being sure to clean him as best as she could. Some of the discomfort he had before seemed to have faded away. She seemed sweet and kind. Remus did not trust many people, he trusted her but not completely, just enough to let her help him. After he was bathed she wrapped a towel around him and dried his body. A guard came in shortly afterwards and gave a bright white toga to Minerva. He gently laid a golden Olive branch crown on top.</p><p>“Master Sirius wants him in this.” The guard instructed and then left.</p><p>Minerva looked at the cloth with sadness in her eyes. She seemed to have known why Remus was here. He was too afraid to ask. After dressing him in the elegant fabric, she gently placed the olive branch on his head. Her eyes were still filled with concern as she led him through the palace and to Master Sirius’s bed chambers.</p><p>“Master Sirius requests that you be sitting on the lounge in the back.” She said</p><p>She led him up to the door, smiled softly, kissed his forehead, and left quickly. Remus walked in to find the room empty. There was a large decorative bed with a golden frame and pillows that looked as soft as clouds. There was a red felt lounge placed against the back wall. He walked silently over to it and sat down. He made sure to keep his posture straight and focused only on that. Fears were rushing through his head as he started to piece together his purpose. The lovely clothing, the beautiful room, he had finally found out why he was here. He tried to calm himself down realizing that it could’ve been so much worse. But still the fear of what Master Sirius would do to him was overwhelming. Remus jumped slightly when the door slowly opened. The dark-haired boy from the Coliseum sauntered in, closing the door behind him. He smirked with obvious lust in his eyes.</p><p>“Well aren’t you gorgeous.” He smiled as he moved closer and closer to Remus.</p><p>With his thumb and index finger he held Remus his chin, in the same way Minerva did; tilting his head up getting very close their lips almost brushing his and Remus’s together. Remus swallowed hard his heart racing a million miles a minute.</p><p>“Your beauty would make the great Venus sob tears of jealousy.”</p><p>With the coy smirk still plastered on his face he kneeled down in front of Remus. He began to run his hands up Remus’s thigh. Remus stared straight ahead breathing quietly, trying to calm himself down in any way that he could. The man rose his hands gently moving up Remus’s torso. His left hand reached the draped cloth on Remus’s shoulder and slowly pushed it off, letting it run down Remus’s arm. Remus closed his eyes and swallowed hard once again. He had faced evil creatures, hunters, traitors of his own kind, but yet this form of contact, form of intimacy, scared him the most. Sirius began to trace Remus’s visible scars with his fingers. The scars Remus loathed. The scars he accumulated from years of painful transformations and forgotten nights. Sirius looked up at the boy. Remus’s eyes were closed tight, trying so hard to calm down his heart. Sirius Black was never the most moral person in the city, but he still had them. He cursed under his breath. His hands retreated for Remus’s body as he stood the rest of the way up.</p><p>“I’m sure you’re wondering why you are here. My guess is you have some sort of an idea, and it is only fair that you know the details of your services.” Sirius began to pace in front of Remus.</p><p>“As you can probably tell, I am Sirius Black. I am next in line for the Empire and therefore must produce another heir.” Sirius walked over and sat on the bed across from the lounge.</p><p>“My parents wish for me to marry and have a child. The only problem with this is I prefer the company of men.” His eyes seductively scanned Remus’s body. A red tent covered Remus’s face as he looked away from the man.</p><p>“You are given to me as a bargaining tool. I get you, my own little toy to play with, and they get in an heir from a woman of their choosing.”</p><p>Remus stared at the ground and nodded. He didn’t say a word. He was afraid to. Sirius sighed and leaned forward, propping himself up with his elbows on his knees.</p><p>“Let’s play a game,” he suggested.</p><p>“You get to ask me three questions, then I ask you as many as I want. That sounds fair don’t you think?”<br/>
Remus nodded quietly.</p><p>“All right you first then.” Serious directed.</p><p>Remus slowly built up the courage to look his new master in the eye.</p><p>“What woman are you to marry?” Remus honestly didn’t care. He was just afraid to ask for the real answers he wanted.</p><p>“Bellatrix LaStrange, and I would rather not go into detail about it; ever.”</p><p>Remus nodded understandably. Bellatrix was known as one of the craziest women in the Black bloodline. She was beautiful, true, but no amount of beauty can hide that amount of insanity.</p><p>“You have two more.” Sirius reminded Remus.</p><p>“Are you going to hurt me?” Remus asked his voice shaking slightly.</p><p>Sirius smiled at the question, his eyes once again scanning Remus from head to toe.</p><p>“Maybe a little, but not in a bad way.” Sirius explained</p><p>“Let’s just say I like to experiment.”<br/>
Sirius’s smile made Remus very uneasy.</p><p>“You have one more.” Sirius added</p><p>“Why me?” Remus asked, so afraid to hear the answer.</p><p>“Because you interest me.”</p><p>The words shook Remus down to his core. The same confession Fenrir made the day he found the den. Those sharp teeth being the last thing Remus saw before he was knocked out cold.</p><p>“All right now it’s my turn.” Sirius’s silky smooth voice brought Remus back to reality.</p><p>“Why were you in the arena? What makes you convict?”</p><p>Remus struggled to find a way to word the answer.</p><p>“I wanted to start an up-rise.”</p><p>Sirius smiled again.</p><p>“So it’s true, you are a werewolf. Oh how fun.” The words came out of Sirius’s mouth smoothly but he was trying so hard to contain excitement.</p><p>“They were going to kill you you know? You had lived for too long. The Emperor sends Fenrir out when he’s tired of the audience’s choices.” Sirius informed Remus with a blank stare.</p><p>Remus nodded. He had lost many of his pack members because of this.</p><p>“Were you going to fight back that time?”</p><p>Remus nodded at his new master.</p><p>“I was going to hold off as much as I could.” Remus’s voice was soft and sincere.</p><p>“So many of my brothers and sisters have died by his hand. If things got too bad, I would have attacked and gutted the bastard before he could take another swing at me.” Remus looked up from the spot on the ground he was staring at.</p><p>His eyes were sweet and he it sounded as if he was ashamed.<br/>
Sirius looked at him sympathetically. He could never imagine what it would be like to see so many people you care for, die right in front of him.</p><p>“Quite heroic type aren’t you?” Sirius smiled in an attempt to defuse the situation.</p><p>Remus nodded quietly, still staring at an empty space on the floor. After a moment Sirius then stood up quickly but gracefully.</p><p>“It has been a long day.” Sirius stated. “I wish to go to bed now.”</p><p>Remus looked up at Sirius and nodded. He gathered the long white cloth wrapped around in his arms and walked slowly for the door.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Sirius asked turning to him very confused.</p><p>“I am going to my quarters… M-master.” Remus stuttered nervously, he was afraid he had done something wrong.</p><p>“No no no,” Sirius shook his head. “No you stay in here with me.” He directed softly.</p><p>Remus simply nodded and walked back to the red lounge as Sirius left the room through an archway that led into the bathroom. Using part of the unnecessarily long toga, Remus created a pillow and laid across the lounge. Sirius returned in a more casual, yet elegant, tunic. He walked past the red lounge and began to look around for Remus. He turned around catching Remus’s eye and laughed softly.</p><p>“What are you doing now?” He chuckled.</p><p>“Going to bed sir, in here with you like you requested.” Remus sat up shaking nervously.</p><p>“In the bed.” Sirius smiled. “In the bed with me.”</p><p>Remus looked at the large comfortable bed in the room. He gulped. He was very nervous about sharing a bed with anyone. He feared because of his nightmares and night terrors he would end up hurting them. But now he feared more of what his new master would do to him in his sleep. Serious noticed his discomfort and smiled softly grabbing Remus’s hand gently.</p><p>“It will be okay,” Sirius reassured, leading Remus to the bed. “I won’t bite. At least, not yet.” Sirius smiled at his own joke.</p><p>Sirius stood on one side of the bed while Remus was on the other. Remus stared blankly at the sheets so many thoughts running through his mind. Sirius grabbed a few pillows and blankets and created a small barrier in the middle of the bed. Sirius crawled in and put his back to the barrier. Remus followed suit and began to relax in the bed. This was his life now. It could’ve been much worse. He could’ve been tortured or been killed in the ring. But if he got his hands on Fenrir, become the monster he feared.</p><p>“Good night Remus.” Sirius said.</p><p>“Good night.” Remus paused swallowing hard. “Master Sirius.”</p>
