    <p>“You’re joking.”</p>
<p>       Harry was sitting in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place, staring across the table at Kingsley Shacklebolt with his mouth hanging open.</p>
<p>       “No.”</p>
<p>       Harry’s hands reached up into his hair and yanked on the messy strands. “But you know how people are, Kingsley. This could be a disaster. This person could turn out to be mental! They could – “</p>
<p>       Kingsley held his hand up. “Harry,” he admonished, “do you really believe I would hire just anyone to be your bodyguard? Give me a little credit.”</p>
<p>       “Why do I even need a bodyguard? Voldemort is gone! This is ridiculous.”</p>
<p>       “Vanquishing the darkest wizard of our time only puts you at an increased risk, Harry. There are still many Death Eaters at large. How many of them wish you ill? You destroyed their master and they’re feeling resentful. Whether they care he’s gone is one thing, but they definitely care about their lowered social status. You’ve made them outcasts. Trust me, Harry, they will be after you.”</p>
<p>       Harry slumped over the table, head in his hands. Defeating Voldemort was supposed to make his life easier, not cause him more problems. </p>
<p>       “I also think it would be good for you to have a little protection from our side, as well.”</p>
<p>       Harry’s eyes snapped up to meet Kingsley’s. “Surely no one would try to – “</p>
<p>       “I think there may be some overenthusiastic Harry Potter supporters that may try to bombard you when you go out. You’re the hero of the wizarding world, the job comes with some drawbacks.”</p>
<p>       “Don’t remember applying for the position,” Harry muttered resentfully. He pushed his plate of sandwiches away, having lost his appetite. “So when will you have a decision?”</p>
<p>       Kingsley stood and strode over to the fireplace, grabbing a handful of Floo powder off the mantle. “Over the next couple of days. I need to get back to the office and review applicants. Don’t worry, I will be screening vigorously. Not just anyone gets to be Harry Potter’s bodyguard.” He grinned at Harry before stepping into the grate.</p>
<p>       Harry rolled his eyes. “Yeah, it’s a real treat, looking after me.”<br/>******************************************************************************<br/>       “Kingsley thinks I need a bodyguard,” Harry told Ron and Hermione later that evening as they ate their dinner, prepared by Kreacher.</p>
<p>       Ron didn’t look up from his chicken, but Hermione put down her fork and looked thoughtful. “I don’t think that’s a bad idea, actually.”</p>
<p>       “Oh, not you too. I’m not helpless! I can defend myself! I killed Voldemort – “</p>
<p>       “That’s exactly why you need a bodyguard, Harry,” Hermione cut across him. “You’re going to be a media magnet, even more than you usually are. It will be easy for anyone to attack you if you end up in Diagon Alley, surrounded by swarms of people. It makes sense for someone to be responsible for your safety.” She stabbed some broccoli with her fork and gave Harry a stern look as she placed it in her mouth.</p>
<p>       “She’s right, mate. With Voldemort gone, people’s guards will be down. It would make you an easy target, because no one would be expecting an attack.” Ron tore his bread in half and promptly stuffed the bigger piece in his mouth. </p>
<p>       Hermione wrinkled her nose as she watched Ron. “I don’t think you should give Kingsley such a hard time about this, Harry,” she said as she turned back to Harry. “It’s for the best. And you can trust Kingsley, he won’t give the job to someone he doesn’t approve of. I’m sure the candidates will be thoroughly scrutinized.”</p>
<p>       Harry sighed, knowing he would regret this. Then he nodded.</p>
<p>       As he prepared for bed that night, Harry thought about how much his daily routine would be interrupted by having someone hovering over his every move. What if this person tried to stop him from starting his Auror training? He knew he would never be able to take orders from a stranger claiming to have his best interests at heart.</p>
<p>        A copy of The Daily Prophet lay on the bedside table. Harry glanced at the front page briefly as he reached up to remove his glasses. Severus Snape Lives! His gut twisted painfully as he remembered hearing of Snape’s survival. He should have known it would take more than some snake venom and blood loss to kill Snape. Harry had been too preoccupied with Snape’s memories: of his friendship with his mother, Lily, how Snape had loved her; Snape’s loyalty to Dumbledore all along; how Snape had been the one protecting Harry since he’d first stepped inside Hogwarts seven years ago.</p>
<p>	Harry still felt guilty for not checking to make sure Snape was really dead. But it had seemed impossible at the time for him to have survived such a brutal attack by Nagini. Harry had not spoken to Snape since his survival was made public knowledge. Before the story was published, Harry had briefly visited Snape in St. Mungo’s, to apologize for his past behavior and for doubting the man’s loyalties.</p>
<p>	The most interesting aspect of their conversation, though, had been when Harry mentioned his mother. It seemed Harry had been mistaken when he interpreted Snape’s feelings for Lily. </p>
<p>	“Yes, Potter, I loved your mother,” Snape had rasped, still recovering from his wounds and struggling to speak. “I loved her much in the way you love Miss Granger. I may have believed it to be romantic love, but as I matured, I discovered I had… misconstrued my feelings towards Lily. Now, leave me in peace, so I can sleep before those damn Healers return to ply me with substandard care.”</p>
<p>	Harry smirked to himself as he climbed into bed, sliding beneath the covers. Snape may have done the impossible and survived, but he was still a surly bastard.<br/>******************************************************************************<br/>	An owl flew in the next morning, carrying a letter from Kingsley. Harry removed the letter from the proffered leg while the bird helped itself to a piece of his bacon. He opened the letter with trepidation, afraid Kingsley had already made a decision.</p>
<p>	Harry,<br/>	I spent most of the evening reviewing candidates for a potential bodyguard, and I believe I have made a decision. After a formal interview with the applicant this afternoon, I should have an answer for you. If it’s not an inconvenience, I’ll Floo in and tell you in person.<br/>	Kingsley</p>
<p>	Harry sighed as he took his plate to the sink, having lost his appetite. By the end of the day, he would know who Kingsley deemed fit to be his bodyguard for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>	Fantastic.</p>
<p>	Harry tried to keep his mind off the impending news by tidying his room, reading a book, and thinking about Auror training, but he was unable to finish each task, and found himself repeatedly checking the time. Ron was at the Burrow, his family was still grieving the loss of Fred, and Harry had chosen to stay behind, as he was avoiding an inevitable conversation with Ginny about their relationship status. </p>
<p>	Over the past few weeks, Harry had realized that it would never work between Ginny and him. He had changed too much, been through the unimaginable. He just didn’t think he would ever be able to be himself around her. Not to mention the fact that lately, Harry had realized that firm chests and muscled arms were more of a turn-on than soft curves and girly giggles. His life had always been so consumed by Voldemort, Harry had never been able to discover himself. Now, however, he discovered that he found the male form to be a very pleasing sight indeed. Not that he’d had a chance to do anything about it. Ron and Hermione were staying at Grimmauld Place with him for the summer, and he rarely had a moment alone. It would be impossible to go out and try to meet someone.</p>
<p>	Especially with a bodyguard on my tail, Harry thought wryly.</p>
<p>	Kreacher called him to dinner, and Harry tossed aside the book he hadn’t been reading and made his way into the kitchen, this bodyguard dilemma still on his mind.</p>
<p>	Hermione showed up after dinner. “Mum and Dad insisted,” she said breathlessly as she dropped her bag unceremoniously on the floor. “They’re still miffed that I’m not living with them. I told them there was too much work to do right now, the war just ended.”</p>
<p>	Harry nodded. “Don’t feel obligated though, Hermione. I want you to spend time with your parents, especially after what you all have been through.”</p>
<p>	Hermione smiled thinly at him over her cup of tea. “I know, trust me.” She sat down at the table and studied him carefully. “Have you heard from Kingsley?”</p>
<p>	“He’s coming over to talk to me about his chosen bodyguard. Any minute now, I’d imagine.”</p>
<p>	Hermione reached across the table and covered his hand with her own. “I know you don’t like this, Harry, and I know you feel like you’re being treated unfairly, but this is for your own protection. And it won’t be forever, just until the media frenzy dies down and the remaining Death Eaters are caught.”</p>
<p>	Harry said nothing. He wasn’t going to pretend that he was fine with this plan. A bodyguard still seemed pretty unnecessary to him.</p>
<p>	Suddenly, the fire turned a brilliant shade of green and Kingsley Shacklebolt stepped into the kitchen. Brushing his robes off, he sat down next to Hermione, across from Harry.</p>
<p>	Harry looked at him warily, noticing how Kingsley’s earring glinted in the dimly lit kitchen. “Well? Let’s have it.”</p>
<p>	Kingsley took a deep breath. “After much consideration, I have decided that out of everyone who applied for the job, the best bodyguard for you is Severus Snape.”</p>
<p>	Harry’s teacup exploded.</p>
