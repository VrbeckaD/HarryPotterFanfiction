    <p>Godric's Hollow, December 23, 2022</p>
<p>Harry sat in his favorite armchair in his personal study, staring out the window. The sky was beginning to grow dark as the sun slowly set on the horizon. A draft managed to creep its way into the room from outside, sending a light chill down his spine. Usually the brisk air didn't affect him as much, but this year had turned out to be a particularly frigid one.</p>
<p>He glanced over to the many photos adorning his desk. There were pictures of him, Ron, and Hermione, one from his wedding day, and many of him and his family having a fun time. He smiled lightly as he recalled the many memories that the pictures brought forth.</p>
<p>As his eyes wandered he settled on one picture in general. He had a photo of each of his three children before they boarded the train to start school. Each of the kids despised their pictures because they would find him reminiscing about those times when they were home on holiday.</p>
<p>Today however, his eyes were drawn to the picture of his only daughter, Lily Luna, his mind wandering back to a conversation he had with her on the very day the picture was taken.</p>

      <strong>Flashback</strong>

</p>
<p>
  <em>He stood alongside the scarlet train, nearly 20 years after his first trip on it, about to send his youngest child off for her first year at Hogwarts.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>There was something bittersweet about it, since it would be the last first year for his children. Even though he felt the weight of this occasion, his children didn't understand its magnitude yet and continued about their day like they did every first day of school.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ahead of him, Harry could tell that his daughter wasn't as confident as she appeared on the outside, her body locked in place at the sight of the Hogwarts Express, her expression saying that she was trying to solve something. He stepped forward and wrapped an arm around her shoulders reassuringly.</em>
</p>
<p>"<em>Nervous?" Lily turned her head towards her father and for the first time in a long time, Harry took the time to simply look at his daughter.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Much like her brother Albus, she inherited much of her appearance from Harry's side of the family. In fact, she looked like the spitting image of the late Lily Potter, including her fiery-red hair, with the exception of her eyes.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Looking into her eyes, Harry's mind began to wander to times right after the war, to quite possibly the most difficult time of his life.</em>
</p>
<p>'<em>Everyone needs to be saved sometimes.'</em></p>
<p>
  <em>He broke from his reverie when his daughter finally responded. "Maybe a little. I feel more excited than nervous." She looked back at the train, this time her gaze landing on her older siblings, her expression still contemplative.</em>
</p>
<p>"<em>What's on your mind sweetheart?"</em></p>
<p>
  <em>A blush quickly formed on her cheeks when she realized that her father had figured out that something was wrong. She opened and closed her mouth a few times, trying to find the words to voice her concern. Her brow furrowed for a moment before she turned back towards her father.</em>
</p>
<p>"<em>It's just that… Jamie's named after the two men who you saw as your father," she paused for a second, her father's nod of the head enough of a prompting for her to continue, "and you told Al before his first year that you named him after two headmasters who you said were incredibly brave." Again Harry nodded his head, not completely grasping where his daughter was going. "I know I get my name from my grandmother but I can't help but wonder…why name me after Aunt Luna?"</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Her question caught Harry completely off-guard, his mouth opening and closing like his daughter's had earlier as he tried to formulate his response.</em>
</p>
<p>"<em>She's one of your mother's and I's best friends growing up. Does there need to be more of a reason than that?"</em></p>
<p>
  <em>His daughter however, could not be deterred. "Then why not name me after Aunt Mione? Wasn't she one of your best friends growing up?"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Harr chuckled lightly in exasperation. He should've known that his daughter would easily be deflected from her questions. He glanced once again in her eyes, almost breaking and telling his daughter all that had happened after the war, but decided against it at the last minute.</em>
</p>
<p>"<em>Your right, it's more than just that she was our friend. Your Aunt Luna helped me out during one of the darkest moments of my life."</em></p>
<p>
  <em>His daughter's eyes widened, making her protuberant eyes appear even larger than they already were. "Really? How did she help you?"</em>
</p>
<p>"<em>I'll tell you when you get a little older. Now, you need to get on the train before you miss your first day at Hogwarts."</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Lily knew that her father was still trying to dodge her questions but after looking at the clock on a nearby pillar, decided that he was right and decided to drop the issue all together.</em>
</p>
<p>"<em>Alright daddy," she threw her arms around her father's neck as she saw that her mother had finished with her brothers, "I love you daddy."</em></p>
<p>"<em>I love you too, pumpkin," he replied before kissing her on the cheek. She released her grip on her father and did the same to her mother before boarding the train.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Harry and Ginny stood there waiting for the train to depart, seeing Lily find a compartment on their side, before waving to them again once it began moving. He continued waving for several moments, until all that could be seen of the train was the smoke as it ran over the horizon</em>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>He was broke from his thoughts by the thunderous sound of footsteps coming from the front of the house. Today was the first day of the Christmas Holiday for Hogwarts, so now all his children would be home for two weeks.</p>
<p>Stepping out into the hallway, he received hugs from both of his boys, who excitedly made their ways to their rooms. At the end of the hallway stood Lily, still very much the image of his mother. Readying himself for what was about to come, he opened his arms for his daughter.</p>
<p>"Welcome home Lily," he said wrapping his arms around his daughter.</p>
<p>"Thanks dad." They both made their way back into the study. It had become something of a tradition between the two of them, that they would spend much of the first night of the holiday talking about the events of the year.</p>
<p>They chatted idly for several minutes before Harry decided it was time.</p>
<p>"Lily, you remember your first trip on the Hogwarts Express?"</p>
<p>"Yes?" began his daughter initially confused at his question.</p>
<p>"Do you remember what you asked me before you boarded the train?"</p>
<p>Her brows furrowed for several moments as she wracked her brain for the information. Finally, her eyes lit up once she found the memory. "Yeah. I asked why I was named after Aunt Luna and you said you would tell me when I was older."</p>
<p>Harry nodded his head before taking a deep breath to prepare himself, "Well, I think it's time that I told you about what happened after the war and your Aunt Luna's part in it."</p>
