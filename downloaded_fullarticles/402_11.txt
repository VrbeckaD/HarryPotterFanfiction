  <span>“I’ve already told you thrice, Pickett. I am not under arrest or any sort of trouble. They just…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stared down and the porcelain coloured envelope for the millionth time, dark blue typewriter ink. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mr. Newton Scamander. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He had given himself a surprise when it arrived, flying through his door to the top of the piles that Jacob had neatly stacked on the divan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The just wanted to talk. Like civilised people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt Scamander, Destroyer of New York, enemy of the world’s most wanted wizard. Such high tittle never suited him, fame always being given to his brother rather than him. And Theseus fit well with it. War hero, perfect student, perfect son.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Contrary to popular belief, Newt never felt any kind of jealousy towards his brother. Quite on the contrary, he admired the man. Even so, nothing the auror said would ease his nervousness whenever at the Ministry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As far as he recalled, this was the first time the officials called upon him in a, quote on quote, non-aggressive way. It was always some form of fine or arrest due to his fascination with somewhat illegal creatures. He hated how dependent of his brother he became at first, but through the years and scars and creatures he became passively fond of annoying the auror with his worn case and yellow-black scarf.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bowtruckle on his pocket broke called upon his attention with a small pinch, urging him with constant squeaks to leave, flee as a priority from the dangerous men with wands and handcuffs. He couldn't blame the creature.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, fine, talking about the damaging usage of dragons for warfare is not civilised, but at least they did not lock you in a box and handcuff me to a raging fire.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pickett rolled his little seed-like eyes before blowing his typical raspberry. He turned around and climbed to the warmth of his breast pocket, but pinched him one last time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The magizoologist gave out a hearty sigh, stopping on his track to observe head of the creature. Sure, the meeting had stressed him out more than Bunty and her little sisters’ group of fanatics, but maybe this was a sign that they prefer to be on good terms. And, as Theseus constantly reminded him, maybe they would lift the damned travel ban. Again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before the whole fiasco in Paris, Newt’s bucket list was far more short than nowadays. He only concentrated on his book and maybe that certain MACUSA auror. ow, everything had changed. He didn't often think of the negative effects, like the lack of sleep and burdening guilt, but on the positive thought that Tina and him exchanged letters more than ever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was not particularly lonely either, no. At least not physically. Again referring to the Paris incident, as everyone around him that held some sort of important position liked to call it, Jacob had been living with him. Change, the short man had told him, was very much needed. With the bakery well taken care off and New York, Jacob had begun trying to open the store again in  London. Business, as guaranteed with his delicious confections, was booming, but Newt suspected that behind the sugar and smiles, Jacob was feeling as miserable as himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man terribly missed Queenie, he knew, but there was nothing to be done. After going back home to actually legalize his stay in London (magically appearing on the middle of the country had not suit his legal needs) he looked for a place to stay, but the Hufflepuff offered quickly. There was plenty of room in his little home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe enough for Tina, but she was busy off in America (He preferred to differ from that topic). Or maybe enough for Theseus to drop by at least one in a while. Maybe-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s such a rare sight to see you without handcuffs around here, little brother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Speak of the devil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Theseus. Long time no see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt stared up at the pair of eyes that mirrored his in colour, failing to ignore the eyebags under his brother’s own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You haven't slept in days, have you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could say the same for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sleep is for the weak.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That honest smile of his, reserved to only the closest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then we must be the strongest warriors upon England.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He swung his steps around motioning the direction of the flu fireplaces.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you busy this afternoon?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Natalie is three months pregnant and needs to bathe-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good. Spare me a pint then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you even hear me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Newt, Erumpets give birth ad six months, she’ll be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where did you learn that from?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This time he failed to see a little disappointment in his brother’s eyes, staring back they approached the constantly perishing green flames of the dark emerald hall. The gold decorations and reflection water from the grand fountain made the place glow faintly, illuminating the few wizards and witches that remained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You still believe I have not read your book?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not my fault that your department banned it for three whole months.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Newt, there’s a line between family and work.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A thin line for you, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As small as a snidget, but as golden as one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The younger one closed his eyes, smiling at the second reference of his work. The auror was right after all, maybe he wasn't giving Theseus the chance of rebuilding the bond they had shattered in Paris.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You seem awfully eager to talk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After all that’s happened, yes. I do care about you, Newt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He ignored the comment, holding back any emotion and trying to form another genuine looking smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where to, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thought you’d never ask.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>_____________________</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The door shut quietly and locked into place with a quick wave of his wand, the room already illuminated before he entered. A smell, that of apple and sugar and spice, filled his nostrils with the warmth of a well kept home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oi! Newt! Close the door before the cold gets in!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jacob appeared from the kitchen, wearing a slightly small apron, hands busy with a battered stained wooden spoon. His expression softened, smiling at the freshly arrived wizard. People constantly thought he kept a house-wife instead of an american muggle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wash your hands before you come to the kitchen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps he was keeping an american muggle housewife.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He entered the kitchen with still wet hands, admiring as his friend cooked without a wand. Newt had never been much of a cook; he could concoct deadly venom and life saving vials in the blink of an eye, but was never capable of cooking anything beyond fried eggs or warming up toast. Jacob began humming, slipping and apple strudel from the oven. The wizard might be wrenched with guilt and pain, but he never went hungry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both sat down as Newt set the table with his own wand, cocking an eyebrow at the unusual cheerines of his housemate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You seem happier than usual.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are ye talking about?” Jacob replied, chewing slowly on a piece of mince pie. “I’m always cheerful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“More, than usual.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The muggle shrugged his shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fair, fair. News came. Ye know, from Tina’s magical papers. she keeps sending them to me as a little token of gratitude or something. MACUSA says they are closer now to that Grindelwald idiot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stopped paying attention at the mention of the auror, but reduced any gesticulation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Say, your amount of letters keeps growing. Like you aren't paying your bills.” Jacob stopped chewing. ”Wait. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Are you</span>
  </em>
  <span> paying your bills?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t use electricity, Jacob.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jacob’s constant errors on the workings of the magical community amused Newt even on the darkest moments. The man was a truly fine specimen, never hiding his awe every time things floated around, ignoring the fact that he was constantly surrounded by magic. Newt had never given though to the fact that magic made things a thousand times more easy, but his friend always did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least Jacob tried to keep up the spirits.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any news from Tina, by the way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s been terribly busy in MACUSA lately, so it’s natural to receive few words from her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He terribly missed her, the cracked loneliness being the reason to most of his sleep deprivation and unusual intake of alcohol.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh well, governments always working hard for all of us.” He stood up, picking up his plates manually before discarding the apron. “I’m turning in. Tomorrow I have another big meeting with that bank near the bakery…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He kept on ranting before stopping at the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You gonna be fine tonight, Newt?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The magizoologist blinked, staring up with his numb expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, yes of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If the answer didn’t convince him, Jacob did not show.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure. Night then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodnight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sat motionless as he heard the last footsteps upstairs, the lights finally disappearing, leaving only him and the candle in the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He would not be fine tonight, but then again, when was he ever? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everything was settled for the night, creatures fed and tucked in. Theseus was content with his seemingly normal behaviour after a few drinks, Jacob also satisfied. he had not liked the Ministry meeting one bit, but at least they were now in rather non-aggressive terms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a  flick of his wand, a bottle of fire whiskey apparated before him, cap popping off. He swung down the burning liquor down his throat, ignoring the ticking of a clock nearby.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He never slept nowadays. Just killed the guilt away.</span>
