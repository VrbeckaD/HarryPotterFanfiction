    <p>“Merlin’s naked balls, Hugo… What is <em>he</em> doing here?!”</p><p>The words just jump out of my mouth. It’s either that or letting my jaw hit the floor. I glance around the room incredulously, checking if anyone else thinks it outright <em>mad</em> for Hugo to bring an outsider to our little shrine without clearing it with anyone first. To our band’s practice, of all things.</p><p>I mean, the basement of twelve Grimmauld Place – an old, transformed dungeon, really – is our holy ground, our safe haven, and, among other things, the rehearsal hole for our aspiring band. No one but the kids of the Potter-Weasley clan have access to it, and I’m secretly immensely proud of being the only honorary exception. No one else is allowed, and I mean <em>not one fucking person</em>. We even make my godfather Harry announce himself, and he owns the damn place!</p><p>Hugo’s dad Ron helped us set up the same sort of insulation that keeps the Weasleys’ Wizards Wheezes, their infamous shop for pranks, intact for years – which means we could probably have the Hogwarts Express running through here without anyone noticing. After we’d decorated it the way we saw fit, with everyone bringing in their favourite junk to make it homey, cosy, and colourful, we bribed Hugo’s sister Rose, who is a prodigy in charms and hexes, to help us place a pack of wards on the door, vicious enough to knock out any would-be intruder for hours. I <em>love</em> it here. I’ve always considered it my home away from home, packed with my favourite things, and my favourite people, doing the things I love best.</p><p>So, it makes perfect sense that Hugo bringing a guest feels like <em>such</em> a violation to me. I guess wards have yet to be invented against the one-man-blasting-curse that is Hugo Weasley. No wards in the world would do against someone who’s been <em>invited</em> and Hugo knows that very well. But did he have to invite <em>him</em>?! Scorpius bloody Malfoy… that… snot’s son! I can almost feel the hair on my head turning an angry red.</p><p>Honestly, I would find it easier if Hugo dragged some random chick in! Well, truth be spoken, Malfoy doesn’t look much like he wants to be here, and… oh, bloody hell, it looks like the mad, ginger fucker might have literally dragged him in: he’s still holding him by the hand! What was the redheaded menace thinking?! Oh, scratch that, no one knows what goes on inside Hugo Weasley’s marvellous brain – and I sure as hell don’t want to! I’m sure it’s a proper jungle of mad and wonderful up in that fiery head, but this time he took it too far. Oh, to hell with him… how could he?</p><p>But of course, Hugo is Hugo; just as unperturbed and cool as always. Honestly, I love the boy to bits, but he’s just a bloody machine, nothing gets through to him. I swear, he could get hit by a killing curse and he’d just shrug it off! Everything – criticism, good advice, angry orders, or honest-to-god pleading – it all just washes off him! He cuts through everything in his way, determined, focused and ambitious. I usually love that about the borderline-mad, ridiculously stubborn, and gorgeous-as-fuck young man, because he’s the reason our little band is going places. But at this moment... at this moment I might just hate him a little.</p><p>As laid-back as Hugo most cunningly likes to appear, he simply shoots me one of those infuriatingly blissful smiles that always manage to unhinge me a little, and shrugs casually.</p><p>“Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Lupin,” he says softly. “I’ve got my reasons. You know he’s got the right to be here now.”</p><p>And that kind of knocks the wind out of me, I confess. I’m sure I look just as miserable and flabbergasted as I feel, because I spot Al roll his eyes and glance at Hugo nervously, while the blond intruder at Hugo’s side sighs and murmurs something that sounds suspiciously like: <em>“I tried to tell him this was not a good idea…”</em></p><p>“Chill it, Ted,” Jamie, my best friend in the whole wide world, unexpectedly weighs in from behind his drum kit, hitting a cymbal forcefully as if he wants to make sure I got the point. “Hugo is right. It’s not like he doesn’t have the right to be here. He’s family now.”</p><p>Oh, fuck it, Jamie… seriously? You, too? But sadly, that’s exactly the essence of the fucking problem. Malfoys are family now. Of course, they were always <em>my</em> family – Scorpius’s grandmother Narcissa and my own grandma Andy… Andromeda are sisters, after all – but we never sought contact with one another, and I never cared to be attached to them much. The Potter-Weasley family, however… they are my favourite family in the whole world, and the one clan I was always desperate to belong to. I know that having Harry Potter as my godfather should have been enough, as it allowed me to spend as much time with the crazy Weasley-Potter bunch as if I was born right into their midst – but the truth is… I’d always wanted more.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, Grandma Andy is great and Harry could not have done his duty as a godfather better, but I… I suppose growing up without proper parents had somehow made me crave the safety net of having a large, actual family that was mine. By choice, by law; in any way I could have it… and for all times. As a child I’d spent long hours obsessing over and fearing what would become of me if something happened to Harry. Which it could: as the head of the Auror department my godfather has a dangerous job! The thought bothered me immensely. Would I still matter to any of them? Would I still be allowed to visit? Would they still care? Harry was my one connection to the wonderful, safe, loving world of the Potters and Weasleys – and it felt so fragile.</p><p>I wanted more. I craved a deep, proper connection with the one family that always made me feel right at home. It was the kind of hunger that made my heart ache in an inexplicable way every time I had to leave. It made me want to call the Potters and the Weasleys my own; made me want to belong. I would never let anyone know how desperate I was to be one of them – but that doesn’t mean I wasn’t willing to go to certain… lengths to get there.</p><p>I made a most desperate move when Harry got privately, and very amicably, separated from his wife a couple of years ago. They haven’t quite made it official to this day, and they still attend many of the social functions side-by-side –  as they’ve remained the best of friends – but for me, that separation triggered a top-notch alert. The fact that I thought it a good idea to start dating Victoire Weasley, with her werewolf-bitten father and her quarter-Veela mother, can tell you enough about my sort of panicked madness. Luckily, Victoire was an angel, and a smart one at that, so when she figured out I didn’t have a straight bone in my body – well, uhm, maybe one, improvised, occasionally – she put on a show of our break-up being mutual, us being too young to know what we wanted; you know, that sort of rot. That was a month ago, and I haven’t had any better idea on how to attach myself to the Weasley-Potters more permanently since.</p><p>But Scorpius Malfoy… that bastard just got there without even trying, didn’t he?!</p><p>People were still loudly debating whether it was a hex or some other suspicious mischief that made Ronald Weasley, an esteemed war hero, throw the wizarding world into a massive uproar about a year ago by unexpectedly divorcing his wife of twenty-five years – and not just any bland wife, but a wife who was a Minister of Magic, for that matter! – only to promptly propose and – wait for it! – <em>marry</em> his old school nemesis, Draco Malfoy. Yes, <em>marry</em>. Yes, <em>that</em> Draco Malfoy, the distinguished pure-blood and former Death Eater who deals in exclusive and terribly overpriced potions’ ingredients these days. And who just happened to have become “conveniently widowed” a couple of years ago, as the infamous reporter Rita Skeeter instantly labelled it. Yeah – I know, you couldn’t make up something like this up if you tried, right?</p><p>The scandal was immediate, overblown, and seemed never-ending. That bitch Skeeter was having a field day, one after another, dragging this “dirty” detail upon that “scandalous” detail of their relationship out in the open – true or false, it didn’t matter to her – and when she was done with the so-called facts, she switched to rumours and insane assumptions.</p><p>But the Potter-Weasleys just did what they did best – and what made me love them so: they closed their ranks and stood as one for one of their own. On a rare occasion when Skeeter actually managed to overhear Ron Weasley “… <em>that insensitive heartbreaker and terrible adulterer, stated nonchalantly with a dumb smile on his brutish, freckled face: “I just wanted to be happy”, before he dug straight into an obnoxious display of obscene kissing with his new husband as if he was completely unaware how scandalous and inconsiderate their actions were.”</em> </p><p>And I happen to know for a fact that Hugo’s dad, against all odds, manages to be genuinely happy with the Malfoy chap. We all knew that they’d been reluctant business partners for decades as it was impossible not to hear them shouting immature insults at each other if one was standing anywhere in Diagon Alley at any time they had a business meeting. But they were both in need of rare ingredients for their shops, and thus compelled to work together… until it was no longer just work. It seemed like the years of their constant banter and childish jabs eventually resulted in enough pent-up passion that <em>“we were either going to kill each other on the spot or fuck each other stupid and senseless”</em>, as I once overheard Ronald himself confess bluntly to his best mate, my godfather Harry, while still wearing that blissful, smitten expression he never seems to be without anymore.</p><p>And as hard as I found it to believe it myself at first, that blond snot actually seems to be head-over-heels in love with “his Weasel” as well. Long-gone are Draco Malfoy’s days of walking about with a cold, composed expression as if he owns and despises the world at the same time; these days he is mostly a flushed, starry-eyed, melted mess, who seems permanently attached to his husband’s face in one way or another. Seriously, one would think they’d get tired of snogging each other blind sooner or later. I mean, I almost overdosed from it just watching them! But the old fossils seem to have inexhaustible reserves of shameless craving between them, and they just won’t let up. Those years of pent-up tension really must have been something…</p><p>But after the initial shock and disbelief subsided, everyone just seems to have come to terms with <em>“the madness of King Ronald”</em>, as his brother George calls it behind his back. Even though Ron’s mother Molly still sometimes meets them with puffy eyes, and appears intent on running out of the room as soon as she spots Draco, rather than Hermione, standing next to Ron in the doorway – trying to fish for a kiss or two as he would these days – the Potter-Weasley family in general adopted a unanimous<em> “I’m happy if they’re happy”</em> sentiment. So, the Malfoys were gradually incorporated as family, everyone is jolly, and I… I’ve been miserable and… jealous. There, I’ve said it.</p><p>As far as I am concerned, Scorpius Malfoy just hit the jackpot without even playing, in more ways than one. Not only are he and his snotty father welcome at the family gatherings, he somehow passed the silent <em>Hugo Weasley approval test</em> and won himself a fierce ally. Now, one might think I just made this test up on the spot, but the Hugo Weasley approval test is a very real thing in the Weasley-Potter family: if Hugo doesn’t want you there, you won’t be. As simple as that. Sometimes, it might take a bit of time for the more resilient candidates, but mostly, it’s a matter of hours, and they all run away screaming in the end. Seriously, I’ve yet to meet a person Hugo could not chase away; the only Weasley sorted into Slytherin can be a right vicious bastard if he chooses to.</p><p>Look, I know it’s childish, but perhaps… perhaps I was a bit disappointed that Hugh didn’t go after Malfoy and his son. If anyone stood a chance of blowing this whole marriage calamity up, it was Hugh. His dad adores him and thinks the world of his opinion. Surely Ron Weasley would have listened to his son if he protested against such a mad… rash… unprecedented decision. But somehow, it didn’t happen. Perhaps Hugo just likes seeing his dad so obviously, undoubtedly happy, or perhaps he has some other utterly insane, hidden agenda – as he would. Sometimes it makes me wonder, though… he <em>did</em> seem a little <em>too</em> enthusiastic about his dad marrying the Malfoy plague – could it be it’s all a part of his scheming?</p><p>Nah, that’s… even for him… nah, I’m probably just paranoid… Yet, the fact remains that Hugo never does anything halfway. Not only did he not move a muscle to get rid of the Malfoys – he seemed to have taken an instant liking to the idea of a step-brother. He’s taken Scorpius under his wing from the very first day their fathers moved in together, and he’s been showering him with attention ever since. The way it looks, he positively adores Scorpius, and as shy and reserved as the skinny blond git always comes across, it’s impossible to miss the radiant smile he always has ready for his vibrant hurricane of a brother-by-marriage.</p><p>Rose casually mentioned once that Scorpius had always wanted a sibling, several even, as he grew up very lonely, and Hugo took the job gladly and very seriously. One can rarely be seen without the other these days. They’d always chat about something quietly, chuckle – or roar with laughter, in Hugo’s case – and Malfoy just seems so damn <em>pleased</em> in his company. It’s quite maddening, really, because… oh, damn, because I would love to be in his place. All I ever wanted was to belong. You know, to fit in somewhere with <em>them</em>, but it was Scorpius Malfoy who got there with no merit of his own… and I didn’t. It isn’t very hard to hate him right now, standing in our sacred basement. As far as I’m concerned, he’s trespassing… and fuck me if I know what to do about it!</p><p>I feel the heat of frustration rising in my cheeks and I gulp down a curse quietly. If there’s even an odd, tiny chance that this bonding between families was indeed Hugo’s doing, as I suspect, the Malfoys aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. And suddenly a tiny droplet of fear sinks down my angry chest like a leaden tear, and I nearly freeze: am I really up to making Hugo and his cousins chose between me and an intruder such as Scorpius Malfoy? I mean, I might come out on top… but then again… Malfoy is family and I… shit.</p><p>I need to calm the fuck down. Maybe I’m reading too much into this. Maybe Hugo’s agenda isn’t more elaborate than to casually introduce Malfoy to our music that plays such a vital part in our lives. He’s always been super proud of us as a band and of what we’ve achieved, not to mention very engaged in our future, and perhaps there’s just no way around it… Yeah… that has to be it. Still, it doesn’t do any harm to double check… just to be sure.</p><p>“So, what is he doing here?” I ask, hoping against hope I don’t sound too sulky but rather engaged and firm, simply pointing out the fact that one is expected to have a good reason to be here.</p><p>“He’s our new singer for the Christmas gig,” Hugo explains matter-of-factly, as if he just let a bit of fresh air in.</p><p>
  <em>The fuck… what?!</em>
</p><p>~</p><p>Oh, just look at him. Oh, holy crap. Shit on a stick, anyone? I never should have let Hugo talk me into this. I knew this was going to happen. Ted is so peeved off he can’t even talk. His hair-colour is going from his regular purple to fiery red in a flash, and to the deep glittering blue, only to explode in flames again. In short, it’s changing more rapidly than the Muggle neon-sign above a stripper-bar… what?! I had, er, a quick course in Muggle studies, courtesy of Hugo, I’ll have you know… It was, uhm… interesting.</p><p>Right… so I just dodged a flying drumstick…. Apparently, Ted’s magic is unpredictable when he’s livid. God, he’s gorgeous… Even like this – angry, frustrated, and… territorial? – yeah, even like this he is. And perhaps I should just quit lying to myself: this is why I’m here. This is why I let Hugo change my mind… because he didn’t really have to change anything, just help my pride and my rationality give into my heart’s pleading. Years of it.</p><p>Yup, you’ve heard that right. I’ve had a crush on Edward Lupin, informally known as Teddy, since I first saw a much older blue-haired boy joke around the Platform 9 ¾. I literally couldn’t take my eyes off him. From the lonely colourless existence of my first eleven years, I suddenly encountered a flash of light, colour and life in the form of one boy so bright and breath-taking that I still haven’t recovered eleven years later. I only saw him around the school during that first year, and after that whenever chance would have it. But I kept waiting for September first every year on pins and needles to see if I was going to see him again. And, sure enough, he never let me down. He only seemed to grow more handsome every year and my fascination with him never waned.</p><p>My heart just… flutters in my chest at the sight of him. What used to be a child-like infatuation had turned into a proper teenage obsession, and now that I see a lot more of him, I regret to report this that particular madness of mine doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. It’s just… so much more intense now, and joined by… <em>ohgod</em>… embarrassingly carnal fantasies of the worst sort that make me think of him day and night.</p><p>Father told me that very first time on the train station who Ted was, so I knew that if things were different, we could have been close. He could have been the company I so badly craved in the lofty loneliness of Malfoy Manor, but it never happened and Teddy Lupin never gave me – much younger and shunned for my surname – the time of day. I didn’t blame him. It was a miracle he didn’t outright hate me. He’s lost his mum and dad because of that stupid Voldemort venture my father took part in, albeit unwilling. How could I blame him if he chose to ignore me? I’ve grown accustomed to the idea of only admiring him from afar, but then Father just lost it one day and finally – god-fucking-finally! – fucked Ron Weasley after decades of being bonkers about him. Before I knew it, they were married and Hugo came into my life.</p><p>And Hugo… yeah, he’s a… oh, man, he’s really something, you know? He could go around selling ice to Eskimos, yeah? He can make anyone believe anything is possible. He read right through me at the very first family dinner, manipulated me – er, as in <em>got me drunk like an ape</em>, all right? – so I somehow ended up spilling out my feelings for Ted… and the rest is history. Here I am. But maybe… I shouldn’t be? This looks like a <em>seriously</em> bad idea from where I stand. Ted appears quite ready to do a <em>Reducto</em> on me.</p><p>Just look at his flabbergasted, devastated face staring at Hugo as if he had just stuck a knife into his chest. Hugh told me how hard he’s trying to belong and it must be such an insult to him to see <em>me</em> simply walk in here… fuck, this was a major mistake. I never should have come. Up until now, Teddy Lupin ignored my existence. But, judging by this hurt, angry look he just shot me, he’s ready to hate me from now on.</p><p>“Now, don’t be a drama queen about this, Ted,” I hear Hugo explain as casually as if he didn’t just rock Ted’s boat hard enough to throw him off it.</p><p>Everyone who knows Hugo even in the least knows there’s a quiet warning in there somewhere. My fiery half-brother came prepared – and… well, as much as I’m smitten with Ted, I don’t think Lupin can win this.</p><p>“Remember my graduation at the Oxford… never mind… at that Muggle University I attended for the last four years? I’ve just got the news that it’s on Friday and I’ve got to be there. And – I’m sure you remember that bit – we’ve also got that super-important gig at the Holyhead Harpies’ seasonal opening to play… yes, I know that one is on Friday as well. I can’t move one or the other – and I’ve got to be at both. Since the time-turner is, er, not so much in the Ministry’s good graces these days, I clearly can’t be at two places at the same time, and I had to choose. So, I got you a replacement for the gig on Friday: Scorpius here kindly agreed to help me and take my place. And just you wait! He’s such a fan of our music, and he’s got talent to boot. He’s just too fucking perfect, you’ll see. He’s…”</p><p>“<em>Perfect</em>?! How is he <em>perfect</em>, Hugo?!”</p><p>Oh, great… fucking great. Ted’s shouting now, and I don’t know he even realises it…</p><p>“Has he ever sung in a band, then?! Not every fucking sissy willing to swing their hips at the crowd is going to fit in, you know!”</p><p>Now, that… hurt, I’ll have you know.</p><p>“I know every song you ever wrote,” I hear myself speak, and I confess I even shock myself a little, especially with how cool and even a bit stand-offish I sound. I always thought I’d be a stuttering, quivering mess when I at last spoke to him – you know, just the way I am on the inside – but apparently, I’m a snotty, stuck-up, proud Malfoy through and through. Who knew?</p><p>“That’s not what singing is about!” he shouts yet again, finally turning towards me.</p><p>Much to my surprise, I realise that not only can Teddy Lupin change his hair colour – apparently his eye-colour is a subject to his emotions as well. Right now, it’s the disconcerting amber of a lion’s eyes. Gulp.</p><p>“Any damn fool can learn the lyrics. It’s about having the vibe, communicating with the crowd, having the right type of voice – and frankly, <em>Malfoy</em>, I don’t think you’re it.”</p><p>Well, damn… Looks like my chance – the tiny, shy hope of making an impression – was never more than an empty dream my desperate heart had made up. He just spat out my name as if it was an insult. I can almost feel my own shoulders sagging in defeat.</p><p>“Says an expert on the voice he’s never heard!” snaps the ice-cold voice to my left and strong fingers are suddenly gripping my hand like a vice.</p><p>Oh, blimey. Hugo. I nearly forgot about him. And judging by the tone of his voice, he’s mightily pissed off. Oops.</p><p>“Hugo, you know I’m right…” Ted tries stubbornly, but some of that amber colour fades into hazel, which seems to be the natural colour of his eyes. Oh, damn… it’s lovely…</p><p>“Ted Lupin, how dare you!” Hugo suddenly barks, and his voice sounds so very much like that of his mother, the notoriously intimidating Minister Hermione Granger, that everyone freezes a little, myself included.</p><p>“You need to stop with this terrible insecurity right now. <em>Right now</em>, Ted! Because it’s ruining <em>everything</em>. You’ve been a member of this family for as long as I’ve known you. A <em>rightful</em> member, in case you still doubt it, because the relationship between the godfather and his godchild is as sacred as it comes. And that, Teddy, is not about to change. No one can take this from you, mate. No one wants to,” Hugo speaks in a softer tone, looking Ted straight in the eye with those bluest of blue eyes that can steal anyone’s heartbeat.</p><p>Surely enough, I can see Teddy press his lips together to hold back some unspoken emotion, and his hair turns deep violet. He’s incredibly fragile right now, I can tell, but I know if anyone can do this, Hugo can. I’ve never met anyone who can read emotions and spin words better than he can.</p><p>“Do you think I, for one, would stand you being around for a minute after Harry announced his separation if I didn’t think you belonged, Ted?” Hugo speaks quietly, almost gently. “You’ve got every right to be here, you’re a part of this family as much as anyone else. Your name might as well be Potter or Weasley, and goddammit, Ted, it’s time you get that into that thick skull of yours! You’ve been acting strange and moody since the day Dad proposed to Scorpius’s father, and it’s only been getting worse since. You owe Scorpius here a chance, because he’s done nothing wrong. If nothing else then for who your father was and what he was put through.”</p><p>All right, I confess that caught me off guard as well. I can’t for the love of God make head or tail of the look Teddy shoots Hugo… but it’s heart-breaking. He looks as if he might want hit Hugo with a hex any moment now – or hug him fiercely and bury his head into his shoulder. But Hugo is, of course, entirely undeterred. That boy certainly knows how to ride the moment.</p><p>“Your dad… Remus Lupin, was the kindest, most gentle-hearted man by everyone’s account,” he says quietly, “yet he faced prejudice wherever he went for something he had no fault in. And Scorpius has had it much the same, Ted. He didn’t ask for his surname, you know, yet he has to live with the weight of it every hour of every day. He’s had it hard, Ted. All I’m asking of you is to give him a fair chance to prove himself. A fair chance, Teddy. Nothing else. Like your dad would have deserved.”</p><p>Damn… and now I’m teary-eyed as well…</p><p>“Fuck…” Teddy murmurs somewhat shakily, and quickly fixes a wayward lock of his gorgeous purple hair while covertly taking care of a rebellious tear that treacherously made it out of the corner of his eye anyway.</p><p>“All right,” he then sighs.</p><p>Really?! My god, <em>really</em>?! Merlin’s beard! That was… that was, unexpected. Am I ready?! Oh, goddammit, am I? I’ve got this one chance to impress him, to get a tiny reimbursement for the long hours I’ve put into listening to every bit of their recordings Hugo has armed me with… to catch his attention for one bloody moment, like I was never able to until now.</p><p>“One chance. That’s it.”</p><p>He’s looking at me now, properly, for the first time. With his eyes resting on me, measuring me up, I try to shake some of that stiffness from my shoulders and attempt a smile one that I’m sure comes out awfully awkward. It’s now or never, then. But I think… I think I can do this.</p><p>I’ve always had a special relationship with music, I just never knew how much until Hugo introduced me to the Muggle-style music their band plays. It was deep, intense love at first sound. I wasn’t lying: I know every word of the lyrics they’ve ever written. Al is an incredible songwriter and I always just kind of let go at the first notes of it. It’s like I can’t help letting the raw sound of it wash over me, let the energy take over, allowing it to pull me wherever it wants me to go. So far, my voice, and even my body has always followed it like I am possessed. I remember Hugo staring at me with something incomprehensible in those sapphire eyes of his when I first started singing along, but I thought nothing of it at the time, because I’m almost in a trance when I sing. I lose myself in it, I let it reach inside me and pull out the real Scorpius, the man I want to be.</p><p>Hugo has been telling me since that very first time that I’ve got real talent, and I guess we’re about to see if he’s right. I hear Al playing the intro of the first song, and I almost smile to myself when I pick up the microphone, because he has set me up with a challenge of his own. He has started with the hardest, most complex song he ever wrote. He smiles at me shyly, encouragingly, because he doesn’t have a bad bone in his body, and I know that he’s offering me a chance to prove myself good and proper. Thanks, Al, I got this. At least I hope so.</p><p>This… is for you, Ted.</p><p>~</p><p> </p>
