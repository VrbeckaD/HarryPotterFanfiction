    <p class="western">It was ten in the morning and Remus could already feel the sun on his skin. It was an unusually hot October and Remus cursed straws, cars and the smog in China. He disliked hot weather with a passion, almost as much as he hated the already drunk guests of AllOfLondon that stumbled around in the cramped smoking area just outside the hostel. Remus prayed that they wouldn't recognize him if he didn't sit behind the reception desk or crouched before a clogged toilet.</p><p class="western">The cigarette that he held gracelessly between his fingers was almost finished which meant he had to get back and face the day but he was desperate to drag out the moment a little while longer.</p><p class="western">His colleague Alice had quit last week and whilst Remus didn't particularly enjoyed doing double shifts, having to conduct interviews by himself somehow seemed far worse. Sybill, the young, unfocused manager of AllOfLondon had given him a handwritten sheet with a few questions he was to ask the interviewees but apart from that he was unprepared.</p><p class="western">Ten past ten, and Remus made his way back, having to shuffle past a few tipsy Dutch girls, trying hard not to make eye contact. The reception desk was crammed with papers, leaflets, bottle caps and barely fit the computer screen and the dusty keyboard. It was probably Remus job to clean this mess but Sybill either didn't notice the mess or it was part of the hostels shabby aesthetic; A concerning mix of esoteric trinkets, party culture and something specifically Sybill. The hostel always smelled of incense and dust and made Remus' head hurt. The smell was probably the reason he had started smoking. It was the only way to justify standing out front without looking lazy.</p><p class="western">Twenty past ten, and Remus checked the timetable. The first person was supposed to be here by now but apart from a few guests that wanted to check out, nobody had made their way to the reception. Remus was relieved as this meant that he only had to interview three people today.</p><p class="western">It was a quiet Wednesday morning, so Remus picked up the book he was reading at the moment. It was one of the countless ones that travelers had left in the hostel lounge over the years and was quite promising. He lost himself between the pages and didn't look up until he heard someone knocking on the reception desk.</p><p class="western">This wasn't the first time Remus had accidentally ignored a guest, so he wasn't too embarrassed, but the second he looked up, he felt like the air was knocked out of him.</p><p class="western">The man standing opposite him was, for the lack of a better word, absolutely gorgeous. Remus swallowed and felt himself blushing, he wasn't too pale but his freckled skin was prone to turning scarlet at the slightest emotion, a trade that Remus despised.</p><p class="western">He took at deep breath, that he hoped wasn't too obvious, and smiled his receptionist-smile.</p><p class="western">“Hi, welcome to AllOfLondon, I'm Remus, your receptionist. How can I help you?”</p><p class="western">The guy smirked, whilst somehow looking completely bored.</p><p class="western">“<em>My</em> receptionist?”</p><p class="western">His remark made Remus blush even deeper, but he tried to ignore the heat in his cheeks and simply shrugged.</p><p class="western">“Well you'll have to share me with about twenty Australian chicks, but if you're okay with that...”</p><p class="western">The man actually grinned, which made him look even more beautiful but slightly less intimidating. He wasn't as tall as Remus but made up for that with long, jet black hair, a perfect complexion and flawless, aristocratic features. His cheekbones were sharp, his lips sinfully curved and Remus could see the toned muscles beneath the guys worn out shirt. Grey, piercing eyes stared back at him and suddenly Remus was aware that in fact he was the one who was staring.</p><p class="western">He quickly averted his eyes searching for something to do with himself when his view fell on the interview timetable. It was five past eleven, that meant that the second interview was due and as if the man knew what Remus was looking at he stated:</p><p class="western">“I'm Sirius Black. I came about the job.”</p><p class="western">Remus nodded and kept staring at the timetable, trying to collect himself.</p><p class="western">“Right, how about you go sit in the garden and I'll lock up and be with you in a minute?”, he finally managed to say and, without looking up, gestured towards the concrete back yard that didn't really deserve to be called a garden.</p><p class="western">Sirius made a sound of agreement and Remus could hear him casually strolling out the reception. Remus first instinct was to just close the reception door and pretend he wasn't there but knew, of course, that that wasn't possible. There was nothing for him to do but to gather his half empty pack of cigarettes, the interview sheet and a pen and follow Sirius Black out into the garden.</p><p class="western">Thankfully it was empty, usually the old plastic chairs were occupied by guests that didn't even try to hide their beer bottles and lit joints. Empty except for Sirius who had draped himself artfully across the only bench, smoking a cigarette, looking like a rock star.</p><p class="western">This should have been ridicules, since Sirius was obviously not a rock star, but somehow Remus felt his hands shake. He had always had a weakness for the bad-boys, the ones that wouldn't even look at him twice, the ones that were cool to the touch, the ones that rode motorbikes, smoked rollies and made long hair look unironically sexy.</p><p class="western">Remus couldn't help but see himself through the eyes of this man, that was so obviously out of his league. A tall, lanky, tired-looking kid, flushed in his knitted jumper. He suddenly felt ashamed of himself, a feeling that he had been successful at keeping at bay for a while now. But only for a moment, then he managed to light up a cigarette and sit down opposite Sirius.</p><p class="western">“So, Sirius, this is a part time position. You would have to do either the morning or afternoon shift, depending on the roster. Apart from you there would be me, the main receptionist, Sybill, the manager, and Molly, who does night shifts.”</p><p class="western">He took a drag of his cigarette and tried to decipher Sybills notes. “Do you have any experience working in hospitality?”</p><p class="western">He looked up at Sirius, who looked distinctly bored.</p><p class="western">“No, Remus, the main receptionist, I do not”, he said.</p><p class="western">“Right, so what did you do before this, and how would that help you with being a receptionist?”</p><p class="western">Remus, took another drag and so did Sirius who seemed to think the question over.</p><p class="western">“I was at school before this,”, he gestured vaguely around the garden. “and have a lot of experience in dealing with drunk people, considering I am usually one of them.”</p><p class="western">He smirked and Remus felt a pang of annoyance.</p><p class="western">“Drinking on the job is not possible sorry. We don't have a bar and a strict no-alcohol policy.”, Remus said but Sirius laughed.</p><p class="western">“Oh yeah I'm sure the girls out there were drinking apple juice.”</p><p class="western">Remus smiled, but felt himself tense. The last thing he needed was for some spoiled rich kid to make fun of him for following a few rules.</p><p class="western">“The guests are one thing but Sybill doesn't tolerate the staff drinking.”, he stated, even though that wasn't necessarily the truth. Sybill didn't know her right foot from her left in the best of times, she wasn't able to tell a drunk from a sober person.</p><p class="western">Sirius shrugged but then suddenly leaned forward, closer and closer to Remus face. Before he knew what was happening, Sirius put his hand up as if to stroke Remus cheek but instead flicked his lighter. Remus cigarette had gone out without him noticing and was being re-lit. He swallowed and felt his heart race as Sirius lingered, looking straight into his eyes.</p><p class="western">“Don't worry, I can behave myself. If I have to”, he said.</p><p class="western">“Right.” Remus felt his own voice crack. He couldn't move back, as if Sirius eyes had trapped him right there on his uncomfortable plastic garden chair.</p><p class="western">“So, do I have the job?”</p><p class="western">Remus was still flushed by the time Sirius left. He couldn't deny how attracted he was to the man and was furious at himself. It had always been hard for him to calm himself down, he was too stuck in his own mind, replaying the embarrassing conversation over and over, and somehow the memory of Sirius gray eyes mocking him made it even worse.</p><p class="western">If he could just go home and hide with a book for a few hours, surely it would be fine, but home was far away these days and two more interviewees and a dozen or so more guests were waiting for him. Being a receptionist in a busy London hostel had sounded exciting and cool when Remus took the job. It was his first in London, a city he had moved to in order to 'get out of his comfort zone', as his mother had called it, but so far he felt miserable.</p><p class="western">He had no friends and worked too much to make any, at least that was his excuse. Living were he worked meant that he was always on call, there were no quiet nights at AllOfLondon and whilst Remus was flattered that Sybill trusted and relied so much on him he had to admit that he was in over his head. Nowadays even small inconveniences, like being awkward in front of a hot stranger, made him spiral into a dark, panicky place.</p><p class="western">The sound of someone clearing their throat pulled Remus out of his thoughts. A rather unpleasant looking man started complaining about his room the second Remus looked up, and so the day had to go on.</p><p class="western">The next two job applicants, a burly boy, who looked way younger than the 18 years he claimed to be, and a skinny woman in her thirties, who smelled of cat, were nice enough but somehow Remus couldn't help but compare them to Sirius.</p><p class="western">The woman was more experienced but lacked in charisma and the boy was a lot more pleasant but would never be able to deal with the rough crowd that the hostel seemed to attract. Remus knew he should have made notes on each of them, and then phoned Sybill at her massage workshop, but who was he kidding, he knew who he wanted to get the job.</p><p class="western">Maybe he was a masochist, he mused, willingly working together with someone that made him feel awkward and dull, or maybe he was a pervert who picked Sirius solely because of his looks. Or maybe he just wanted something to finally happen to him. Either way he had made his choice.</p><p class="western">After Molly had taken over for the night shift Remus went outside for his last cigarette of the day and dialed Sybills number.</p>
