    <p>Charlie sat there looking out through the cracked glass onto the mutilated landscape of a war-torn Hogwarts. They had just held the funerals for those lost during the battle, Charlie had just watched as his baby brother was lowered into the ground at far too young an age.</p>
<p>        “Char?” A familiar voice brought his gaze away from the window and to his older brother Bill.</p>
<p>        “Hey, Bill,” Charlie’s monotone acknowledgement sent a spike of worry racing through Bill’s system.</p>
<p>        “What are you doing out here? The feast started twenty minutes ago. The others were getting worried,” Bill slowly made his way toward Charlie, keeping his voice quiet and even, as if he was approaching a scared animal.</p>
<p>        “Not hungry,” Charlie muttered turning his body towards Bill.</p>
<p>        “You’ve been saying that for days now, Char,” Bill pulled Charlie in a hug and rested his head on Charlie’s. “Everybody is starting to worry.”</p>
<p>        “Fred is never going to eat again.”</p>
<p>        Bill tensed at Charlie’s words. “Come on, Char, Freddy wouldn’t want you to be doing this to yourself.”</p>
<p>        Charlie could feel tears in his eyes, but they just wouldn’t fall. “I know, but- It’s just so hard. We were supposed to go first. God, Bill,” Charlie shook his head and buried it into Bill’s chest. “I work with dragons and you travel around the world breaking curses for god’s sake. It shouldn’t have been him, not him.”</p>
<p>        “I know Char, I know. Life isn’t always fair, it rarely does what is expected,” Bill pulled away from Charlie slightly. “How about we just go get settled in for the night and then we can try again at breakfast, alright?”</p>
<p>        Bill gave a small smile as Charlie nodded. “Good, let’s go.” Bill threw an arm over Charlie’s shoulder and led him out of the hall and towards where the tents were set up for those helping with the relief efforts.</p>
<p>        Once in the tent Bill cast a warming charm and brought Charlie over to one of the beds. “Just rest for now.”</p>
<p>        “Good night, Bill,” Charlie mumbled before falling asleep.</p>
<p>        “Good night, Char.”</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>        “Weasley, Charlie!” Professor McGonagall called from where she stood beside the Sorting Hat.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>        Charlie took a deep, shuddering breath before pushing his way through the crowd of eleven-year-olds waiting for their names to be called. Sitting atop the stool Charlie looked out across the sea of strange faces and settling on the familiar face of his older brother Bill and immediately feeling at rest. There was no need to fear as long as Bill would be beside him.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>        <strong>‘So, a Weasley.’ </strong>Charlie jumped when he heard the voice of the Sorting Hat in his head.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>        <strong>‘Yes?’ </strong>Charlie replied, unsure of how he should answer.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>        <strong>‘My first reaction is to put you in Hufflepuff-‘</strong></em>
</p>
<p><strong> <em>        ‘No!' </em> </strong> <em>Charlie interrupted the Sorting Hat.</em> <strong> <em> 'Please, I’m a Weasley, I belong in Gryffindor.’ </em> </strong> <em> He had nothing against Hufflepuffs, but he had always been told that Weasleys belonged in Gryffindor. Plus, Bill was in Gryffindor.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>        <strong>‘You will always find friends amongst the loyal of Hufflepuff. But, it better be-‘ </strong>“Gryffindor!” The Sorting Hat shouted causing the Gryffindor table to erupt in cheers.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>        Charlie hopped down from the stool and quickly made his way over to table filled with red and gold to situate himself between his brother and another first year who introduced himself as Ben Cooper. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>        The Great Hall settled down again as Professor McGonagall called out another name. “Tonks, Nymphadora!” A girl with bright pink hair clambered up to the stool and waited for the Sorting Hat o be placed on her head. After Tonks was sorted into Hufflepuff, Charlie quickly lost interest in the sorting in favor of talking to his fellow Gryffindors.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>        “Villareal, Emily!” At McGonagall’s words all talking in he great hall came to a grinding halt. Everyone knew of the Villareal’s, more importantly, everyone knew of Jacob Villareal the troublemaker who got expelled from Hogwarts for searching for the fabled Cursed Vaults.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>        The Villareal girl didn’t stand out to Charlie, in fact he would describe her as being almost forgettable. What did stand out to Charlie about her was the determined glint in her eyes and the proud tilt to her head that seemed to say, ‘say what you will, you will not bring me down.’</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>        Charlie respected her for it.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>        “It better be, Hufflepuff!”</em>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>        Charlie jolted awake.</p>
<p>        “Hey, Char, you up to try for some breakfast?” Bill asked from where he sat with a plate in his hand. “I went and grabbed us some a little while ago, it should still be hot.”</p>
<p>        “Yeah, sure,” Charlie slowly sat up trying to keep hold of his dream. He normally would have let it go, but something about it seemed off to him.</p>
<p>        “What are you mulling over now?” Bill asks passing Charlie a plate of slightly warm food.</p>
<p>        “Just an odd dream, probably stress,” Charlie picked up some of his breakfast and stuffed it into his mouth, frowning at it’s ashy taste.</p>
<p>        “What about?”</p>
<p>        Charlie opened his mouth to answer but immediately closed it frowning. “I don’t actually remember.”</p>
