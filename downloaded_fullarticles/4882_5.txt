    <p>"You don't have to be here for this."</p><p>Those weren't the last words he'd said before she left, but sometimes they felt like the most important. He'd looked into Luna's eyes and saw the love and support she'd always shown, but they now barely masked the strain and anguish everyone strove to keep hidden in the Aftermath. He helped her pack, exchanged soft words of comfort and support, but they were washed from his mind whenever he remembered the sadness in her eyes.</p><p>"You don't have to be here for this."</p><p>"I think you made the right decision, Harry," Hermione said quietly, concern in her eyes, as they waited for the meeting to begin. He kept his focus on the door, nodding to the former Order members and old DA friends who had begun to trickle in. She sighed. Before she could speak again, he motioned to Ginny Weasley, who sat in the corner with a group of friends, to begin taking notes. As the crowd settled, he stood and waved for silence.</p><p>"You all know how this works. Just like last time, then. Reports, suggestions, volunteers. Who wants to go first?" With a grin, Tonks raised a hand and shuffled through her notes. They met every week or so, with those who couldn't attend sending reports in with a friend, taking stock of the recovery process and the overhaul of the Ministry. The Aftermath left the government in shambles and the faith of the country just as shattered. Harry had become a lone symbol of triumph overnight, and of the bright future ahead. That thought terrified him as nearly nothing else had. As soon as the dust cleared, he gathered his friends from school and the Order and told them his two goals: to tell people what happened and who was responsible while they rebuilt the government from the ground up.</p><p>They sent representatives to towns around the country and to Ministries across the continent, telling people what had truly gone on during the years after Voldemort's return, and sharing the stories of the brave men and women who had fought to bring about a new era of peace. Harry was adamant that the people know the truth, after living in a cloud of fear and lies for so long, and the last thing he wanted was for everyone to think he had 'won the war' single-handed. So instead of self-congratulatory parades and speeches, Harry held meetings in shadowy pubs and people's living rooms, keeping their group updated on their progress, gathering suggestions for how to proceed, and sending volunteers off to keep the masses informed. He did his best to let the others have their say, and he always gave Minister Shacklebolt the last word.</p><p>It was a long, frustrating, nerve-wracking process, but Harry was determined not to let the stress show. He put on a brave face for his friends, and for his few public appearances, but he was also determined to shield Luna from the spotlight, and from any threats of retribution from the remnants of Voldemort's regime. She'd been gone barely two months and he could already feel his resolve wavering; he could take on any threat (or a dozen screaming reporters) if he could only see her smile…</p><p>Kingsley cleared his throat. Harry started and looked up guiltily. Having gained the attention of the room, Kingsley grinned and stood to give his parting words. Harry did his best not to slouch in his seat. Hermione shot him a knowing look as the meeting broke up and several people came forward to shake his hand. Before he could cross the room to check in with Ginny, he felt a hand on his arm, and stopped with a sigh.</p><p>"I saw the look on her face when the Scamanders told her she could join them on their expedition. As excited as she felt, she was sad to leave you, but you and I both know it was for the best."</p><p>"She said I could go along, you know," he said softly, nodding to the Weasley twins as they slipped out the door. "I could be searching for Strangling Spider-Lizards in Thailand right now." Hermione rolled her eyes.</p><p>"As if you'd leave the mopping up to the Order to go mucking around in the jungle. You're far too noble for that." He fought back a smile as she continued. "You're doing the right thing by staying to help, but it was right to let her go abroad while you sort things out, too." Ignoring his flustered "We! While <em>we </em>sort things out! Don't let people hear you-", she pressed on, "She's not used to this sort of pressure, this scrutiny. You can ease her into your world slowly, once things begin to settle." She paused, then added carefully, "It was the right thing to do, but I know it doesn't make you miss her any less."</p><p>~*~</p><p>The months dragged on as they rooted out hidden threats, searched for the missing, and slowly rebuilt their society, brick by brick. Quite literally with new bricks at Hogwarts, which Harry left to a skilled crew of historians and masons; he wasn't ready to go back just yet. Unfazed by the publicity or the shadows of the past, Hermione jumped at the chance to return for her 7th year the moment the castle was declared structurally sound. As the threats around them began to fade, Luna took a Portkey to Harry's home once a month, then every other week, where they would stay up all night discussing her adventures. Rolf Scamander and his team were trekking across Asia to gather information for a new edition of his grandfather's seminal work and were keeping Luna safe and thoroughly entertained, as promised. In his dimly lit living room, she brought to life her journeys through rainforests and over mountains, cheerfully showing him her various insect bites and leaving little trinkets carved from wood and stone on his mantelpiece. Her first gift, a wooden lizard the size of his thumb, he kept in the pocket of his favorite cloak; he felt for it as he shrugged on the cloak and headed for the door after yet another meeting had come to a close.</p><p>"Harry?"</p><p>He paused and noticed Ron lingering in the hallway, a determined look on his face.</p><p>"What's up?" Ron beckoned him over, and Harry turned back with a sigh, watching his friend expectantly.</p><p>Ron took a shaky breath. "I'm going to ask her to marry me."</p><p>Harry's eyebrows shot up. "Hermione?"</p><p>Ron flushed. "Yes, Hermione! Who else? And she's right, we need to get Luna back from Nepal before you start walking into coat racks." Before Harry could defend his alertness, Ron pulled a small box from his pocket and held it up for him to see. "I figured it's time, you know? She's done with school, things are quieting down…"</p><p>Harry glanced around and saw that they were the only ones left. "I think you missed your chance, mate, she's already gone home."</p><p>"Not tonight!" Ron spluttered, shoving the box back in his cloak and looking around cautiously, as if Hermione might walk back in at any moment. "Next week, maybe! Or after Christmas. Maybe on New Year's Eve." He shrugged nervously. "I'll figure it out. Just letting you know. I want you to be my Best Man."</p><p>Harry clapped him on the shoulder. "Of course. And congratulations; I know she'll be thrilled." He grinned as they headed for the door and out into the cold night air. "I've never been to a celebrity wedding before. What should I wear? Are we allowed to speak to the press?"</p><p>"Ha, ha." Right before he Disapparated, Ron shot back, "Just wait, I bet yours will be a thousand times worse. There'll be reporters swinging from the rafters, and every witch in England will be lining up to talk you out of it."</p><p>~*~</p><p>He'd done well through all of the early planning, encouraging Ron whenever doubts crept up and assuring Hermione that the napkins were the perfect shade of cream. He'd held it together that final week of madcap preparation, with guests coming in from all over and reporters hiding behind every tree. It wasn't until he walked up to the humongous white tent and stepped inside an hour before the ceremony that the memories hit him full force: the laughter and chatter of Bill and Fleur's guests turning to terrified screams as the Death Eaters descended upon them, while he, Ron, and Hermione Disapparated into the night…he stood frozen in the doorway, watching the Weasleys set out chairs and flowers for their youngest son's ceremony, and felt the old fear and uncertainty twist inside his gut. <em>Is this how it's going to be? </em>He thought numbly as people bustled past. <em>I can't have one good thing, one day, without being reminded of something terrible. </em>And most painful of all: <em>How could I have a future with her if I'm still being torn apart by my past?</em></p><p>His mind abuzz with painful memories, he ducked out of the pavilion for a breath of fresh air, only to collide with a familiar figure as he sped down the garden path.</p><p>"Neville?" Harry asked, disentangling himself from the hedgerow they had both fallen into. He pulled his friend to his feet as Neville straightened his dress robes, looking rather frantic.</p><p>"Blimey, Harry, you took that corner rather fast. Where are you off to in such a hurry?"</p><p>"Sorry, Neville, just have a lot on my mind today," he said sheepishly. "What are you doing back here? Everyone will be sitting down soon."</p><p>"I, er…" He shifted from foot to foot, grasping something in his pocket, even though Harry knew his wand to be hidden up his left sleeve. "I've just…just been…" Harry watched him expectantly and Neville took a shaky breath. "After the ceremony," he said, his voice a bit higher than usual, "I'm going to ask Ginny to marry me."</p><p>Harry nearly fell back into the hedge. "That's great, Neville! I know she'll be thrilled." His heart beat faster as Neville rambled on.</p><p>"Things are settling down, it's finally time…it just feels right, you know? But now that I've decided, I don't know if I can go through with it without fainting on the spot." He laughed nervously. "But why are you barreling through the gardens, trampling Ron's guests instead of helping him get ready? What's got you so worked up?"</p><p>"Well, I was…" He turned and checked the path for other guests; they were alone. "Actually," he continued softly, "I was thinking I might ask Luna the same thing."</p><p>Neville's face lit up. "But that's brilliant! You ask Luna, make a grand gesture, get the room's attention, and then I'll ask Ginny and she's sure to say yes! Everyone will be so excited, she'll just-"</p><p>"Wait, wait a second!" Harry spluttered. "I haven't even decided if…and it was <em>your</em> idea first, you should go ahead and-"</p><p>"No, it's a great idea, you should definitely ask first. <em>Please,</em> Harry!" Neville grabbed him by the shoulders. "This could be the perfect moment, I don't want to ruin it by…everyone will be watching, and all of the Weasleys are here…what if she says no? I'd never live it down!"</p><p>Harry shook his head, holding up his hands in a placating gesture. "No, it'll be fine, she's sure to say yes. Then, when everyone's cheering, I'll look over at Luna, try and guess what she's thinking-"</p><p>"No one can <em>ever</em> guess what she's thinking!" Neville cried, throwing up his hands in frustration.</p><p>"My guesses can be pretty good, thanks!" Harry said indignantly.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>They both spun on the spot and cried, "Nothing!" as Ron and his brothers wove through the garden toward them.</p><p>"Yeah, Harry, what's up?" Fred asked as he came up beside them. "It's your job to keep this one from going off the deep end," he said with a grin, jerking a thumb in Ron's direction.</p><p>Neville shot Harry a terrified glance and stammered, "We were just, uh...that is to say…"</p><p>"We were just discussing the, uh….the cake," Harry said in what he hoped was a calm, rational voice.</p><p>Fred raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Yeah, we, er, just wondered if it had been placed properly, that's all, in the right spot and everything."</p><p>George shot them a curious smile. "Cake's been there all morning, boys, pretty sure it's fine."</p><p>"Right then!" Harry grabbed Ron's arm and began steering him back toward the pavilion. "Glad that's settled. Let's get you ready then, shall we?"</p><p>Neville was not to be put off so easily. "But Harry, the <em>cake</em>," he muttered into Harry's ear, eyes wide.</p><p>Harry shook his head, but Fred called over his shoulder, "I think I saw Ginny by the cake table, Neville, why don't you go ask <em>her</em> about it?" Neville blanched. Harry resisted the urge to hide his face in his hands.</p><p>Ignoring the twin smirks and confused looks they were receiving from the five older Weasleys, Harry told Neville, "Good, yes, you can fill me in <em>later</em>." He watched him turn nervously toward the tent before continuing to tow his best friend toward the ceremony space. "Right then, I'm sure you're all set. Who did up your tie? Looks great, even better than we practiced…"</p><p>"You sure you're all right, Harry?" Charlie asked, looking concerned.</p><p>"If they both have nervous breakdowns, do I get to be Best Man? I have an excellent toast prepared, just in case," Fred told Bill, rubbing his hands together excitedly as Percy checked his watch. Bill rolled his eyes.</p><p>"Do you have the rings, Harry?"</p><p>Harry nodded, grateful for the distraction. He clasped Ron's shoulder reassuringly. "I have them right here. Now all we have to do is walk in and smile until Hermione gets here. Nothing to it."</p><p>Ron stopped dead in his tracks, his face ashen. "<em>What if she doesn't come?</em>" He grabbed Harry's shoulders just as Neville had earlier, eliciting eye-rolls from all of his brothers and a poorly suppressed snort from Fred.</p><p>Harry patted Ron on the back. "I got word from your parents ten minutes ago, mate; she and the girls are dressed and ready." Harry gently turned him back toward the pavilion once more and began walking toward the entrance, trying to ignore his own shaking legs. "It's fine. Everything's going to be just fine."</p><p>~*~</p><p>The ceremony was a blur of flowers and lace, Ron looking pale as Hermione blushed, the cheers and laughter of their guests, Luna's arm looped securely through his own. While the newlyweds shook hands and accepted congratulations, Harry helped the Weasleys rearrange the furniture and clear a space in the center of the tent for dancing. Luna and Ginny stood on either side of Ron and Hermione, taking up what Ginny laughingly called 'guard duty'. Harry smiled over at them as he levitated a dinner table off to the side, watching Luna calmly survey the crowd of guests. The space thus transformed, everyone sought out a seat and continued to mingle as they waited for dinner to be served. Harry sat down at the head table while his friends made their way over, shaking hands as they went. Luna was the first to join him, happily taking off her shoes to rest her feet; Harry shook his head as she slipped on the ballet flats he'd brought for her, wondering why Hermione had insisted the girls wear such uncomfortable-</p><p>BANG.</p><p>Harry was on his feet in an instant. Shoving Luna behind him, he drew his wand in a flash and turned to face the imminent threat. The rattling of silverware and dropped glasses filled the air as the other guests jumped and gasped in shock; Ron's brothers fanned out into the crowd, wands raised, and out of the corner of his eye, Harry caught sight of Hermione grabbing frantically at her dress. <em>She brought her bag, </em>Harry thought wildly; <em>she brought her bag, just in case, but I'm too far to reach them…</em>but instead of her old beaded handbag, he realized she was only tugging her wand from a fold in her skirts. Dragging himself back to the present, Harry finally registered the source of the disturbance.</p><p>A terrified caterer knelt several feet away; the man stared up at Harry with wide eyes, a pile of metal serving trays scattered at his feet. The entire tent was silent as the Weasleys and their guests slowly put their wands away and turned to watch. Not taking his eyes off the man on the floor, Harry let his wandless hand fall to Luna's knee; he could feel her shaking through all of those layers of tulle. After giving her a reassuring squeeze, Harry took a deep breath, and another, then slowly stowed his wand back in his robes. He strode over to the man on the floor, took another deep breath, and reached down and helped the poor man to his feet. Harry held up a hand as the man began stammering out an apology and said, "Just be careful, yeah? You're finding your way around some pretty tough terrain."</p><p>The man laughed weakly and scooped up his trays; Harry walked back to his table and sank into his seat, resisting the urge to run his hands through his hair and embarrass himself any further. Mrs. Weasley was alternating between scolding her over-zealous sons and cheerfully encouraging her guests to take their seats and pop open the champagne. Ron and Hermione had finally reached the head table, watching in stunned silence as Harry straightened his robes and reached for Luna's hand. She flung her arms around him and he gasped, nearly choking on a cloud of blonde hair.</p><p>"I thought you were leaving," she whispered, and he struggled to breathe for an entirely different reason. "I thought they were back, and you'd leave with your friends, just like before." Harry shook his head and held her close, then gently set her back in her chair, still aware of the other guests eyeing him curiously. He handed her a glass of water, then looked straight into her over-bright eyes and said softly, "I'm not going anywhere. Not without you."</p><p>~*~</p><p>After dinner, during which Mrs. Weasley could be heard reassuring the guests at her table, quite loudly, that the wards around the tent were as secure as could be, Ron and Hermione got up to take some pictures by the cake while the band tuned up for the first dance. After casting a fond glance over at his friends, Harry turned back and realized that Neville was shooting him looks of increasing desperation from where he sat with Ginny, Bill, and Fleur. Harry tilted his head toward Ginny and widened his eyes, hoping he would take the hint, but Neville shook his head violently, pointing between Harry and Luna, then pretending to sneeze when Ginny looked his way. Harry turned determinedly to face the band, and found himself watching Luna instead; she was listening carefully to the tuning violinists and toying with the ruffles on her dress.</p><p>The sound of chairs shifting brought him back to Earth: Ron and Hermione had returned to the table, each carrying a small plate of cake. Still attempting to ignore Neville, who seemed to be twitching uncontrollably, Harry greeted his friends before turning to Luna once again.</p><p>"Hey, Luna?"</p><p>"Yes, Harry?"</p><p>He tugged at his collar; the tent suddenly seemed very warm. "Would…would you like a piece of cake?"</p><p>"Yes, thank you." She smiled and turned back to watch the musicians, who were currently rifling through their sheet music, which seemed to have gotten out of order.</p><p>He could feel Hermione's eyes burning into the back of his head; she must have sensed something was up. Even Ron had turned his way with a puzzled frown. Did the room seem quieter? How could it, with all of those people? He reached out and took her hand, and she turned toward him, head tilted inquiringly.</p><p>"Luna?"</p><p>"Yes, Harry."</p><p>He sat up straighter in his chair, took a deep breath, and gripped her hand a little tighter.</p><p>"Do…do you…I mean…would you like to go to Morocco with me?"</p><p>Harry thought he heard groans of disappointment from the nearby tables as Luna considered his question, but his ears seemed to be ringing, so he couldn't be certain.</p><p>"When?" she asked. "I'm told it gets quite warm there in the summer, unless…oh, look!"</p><p>At the next table over, Neville stood abruptly, sending his chair toppling over. His face red but incredibly determined, he sank to one knee at Ginny's feet and grabbed her hands, speaking in an incoherent rush. Ginny shrieked and pulled him to his feet into a crushing hug. She dragged him to the center of the room, where they spun and laughed across the dance floor. Startled, the band quickly struck up a tune, the bandleader looking around in confusion for the bride and groom.</p><p>"Oi! They're stealing our first dance!" Ron huffed, gesturing at the pair with his fork.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes and gave his shoulder a squeeze. "Just eat your cake, Ron." She smiled secretively at Harry, who regarded her warily, before she turned to watch their friends' joyful dance. "I'm sure we'll all be out there soon enough."</p><p>Harry sighed, wondering when and how he'd finally lost his nerve. Swaying to the music, Luna turned to him and smiled. "They look happy."</p><p>Harry couldn't help but smile back. "Yeah, they do." Rubbing the back of his neck, he continued, "So, about before…"</p><p>Her face lit up. "Oh yes, Morocco! That would be quite an adventure. When would you like to go?"</p><p>"Well, I figured…that is, perhaps next spring, after…after we're married."</p><p>He paused, biting his lip, waiting for her reaction. She blinked slowly; he wished desperately that he had planned this moment more carefully. She leaned toward him, watching his face. "Do you really mean that? Is that what you want?" she asked softly.</p><p>"More than anything," he replied, holding her hand a bit tighter than necessary.</p><p>Her smile lit up the room. "That sounds like a wonderful idea." Beaming down at the slice of cake a server placed before her, she continued animatedly, "I wonder…should we leave for Africa after we get married, or should we get married there to save time?"</p><p>"You could get married right now; we have a tent set up and everything," said George helpfully from two tables over, and was quickly shushed by his brothers. Harry felt his face heating up; why had they arranged the tables so close together? He focused instead on tucking into his cake, and the feeling of Luna's hand in his. Ginny had begun dragging an out-of-breath Neville from table to table showing off her new ring to her family and friends.</p><p>Ron pushed away his empty plate and sighed. "We should probably head them off before they get to Fred and George's table; Fred looks like he has something up his sleeve. Literally." As he stood and straightened his robes, he added, "And I'd like a word with Neville myself."</p><p>Hermione shot him a look as she stood up to join him. "Leave the poor man alone for one night; it's time for our dance. And you," she said with a nod in Harry's direction. "Come share the first dance with us."</p><p>Luna turned to Harry hopefully as Ron muttered, "The second dance, thanks to my sister and her <em>fiancé</em>."</p><p>Hermione gave him a light shove, and Ron had to fight to keep his scowl in place. Grinning, she said, "I think it's wonderful that we have more reason to celebrate, so stop whining and let's go celebrate together." With that she took Ron's hand and led him toward the dance floor, grabbing Harry with her free hand as she passed. Still clutching Luna's hand like a lifeline, the three of them were dragged out into the open to a barrage of cheers and whistles from the assembled crowd. Hermione waved Ginny and Neville over as Ron signaled the bandleader to start the next song.</p><p>As the six of them spun around the dance floor, Harry took in the scene around him: the assembled Weasleys and their guests clapping along to the music, his friends' beaming faces as they danced, the fierce joy in Luna's eyes when he held her close…<em>maybe, </em>he thought, <em>weddings aren't so bad after all.</em></p>
