  <u>Prologue</u>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">
  <em>And thus is it written</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>That the Faithful Child of the Lord shall live</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>through hardship and hear breaking</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>But though his faith in The Almighty may</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Waiver, it shall never be lost.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>And when the Righteous Man is close</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>To breaking</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>The Faithful Child will answer the call</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>And be given his redemption</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>For the Faithful Child will be the Guardian</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Of the final seal</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>And his faith will be the only thing that may</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Prevent the end of days</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>But shall the Faithful Child be pushed too far</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>And his faith made to break</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Then the wrath of the Lord will be felt by all</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>And all will be lost.</em>
</p>
<p>Throughout Heaven, the sounds of mourning could be heard as the aftermath of the war between the angels was felt. Lucifer had been cast in Hell by Michael and many mourned the loss of the brightest and most beautiful of the archangels.</p>
<p>The three archangels remaining however were all mourning for the loss of their brother and, unknown to the rest of the angels, the loss of their Father.</p>
<p>But in a small forgotten corner of heaven, where no one rarely visited, one of the last prophecies of God was uttered and only two were witness to it. Joshua and Gabriel both silently listened to the last official message of their Father and knew that there was a reason they were the only ones to hear it.</p>
<p>Silently, they both decided to keep quiet about the last prophecy as they were aware of what the Fall of Lucifer really meant for humanity. And perhaps here was a small hope that perhaps their Father hadn't truly abandoned them and that there was soon to be someone that might even return their own faith.</p>
<p>However Gabriel was aware that it wold be millenia before there was even a whisper of either the Righteous Man or the Faithful Child and he knew there was no way he'd be able to stick around. He could already hear the whispers of hatred about his older brother and could see the ending of the mourning as more and more angels placed the blame for the war entirely on the shoulders of Lucifer.</p>
<p>He watched as Michael slowly became more and more distant from the Host as the pressure he felt over their absent father built and he watched as Raphael became colder and colder towards any who dared differ in his own thoughts.</p>
<p>Gabriel stuck around for a few centuries after the war, keeping an eye on the garrisons under his own watch and the few lone angels that would listen to his word as well as the word of their Father. Then, when he had made sure that those few he could trust would carry on doing what he asked them to do, Gabriel finally made a visit to the Garden to speak with Joshua about the prophecy.</p>
<p>"We shouldn't tell anyone."</p>
<p>"No. Keep an ear out for the Faithful Child?"</p>
<p>"I will. What will you do?"</p>
<p>"I'm leaving. But I'll make sure to keep an ear out for the Righteous Man and the Faithful Child."</p>
<p>"We at least have an idea of what line the former will be from. But we have no idea where the latter could come from. Perhaps, if you are leaving, you should be the one to look out for the Child. If I do, it may bring attention to him that we can't afford."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. I'll do it but I'll get word to you when I find him. They'll need an angel to watch over him. I'll send one of my loyal independents."</p>
<p>"Which one?"</p>
<p>"From the wording of the prophecy, I can think of a few that would be best matched with him. It'll be best to see what month he's born in."</p>
<p>"What if he's born in a month you don't have an angel watching over?"</p>
<p>"Hopefully, if I don't then Lucifer will have."</p>
<p>"You think that's wise?"</p>
<p>"We each shared, for lack of a better word, responsibility of the seraphs that Lucifer resided over. But regardless of which archangel the independents were given tasks by, they ultimately remained loyal to God only. They should be open to watching over our Father's last true child."</p>
<p>"You're an angel of forethought, Gabriel. Are you telling me that you have no idea what is to come?"</p>
<p>"Father gave me a message before he left. I'm following His message."</p>
<p>"Can you share it?"</p>
<p>"Not fully. Just know that I'm following His will."</p>
<p>"But you will still leave? Is that His will too?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I doubt it. He never said anything to stop me though. I can't stay here, Joshua. I'm not like Raph or Mikey. I'm too wilful. I wasn't made for war. And it's only a matter of time before they start remembering that I was closest to Lucifer. That I was taught all I know by Lucifer."</p>
<p>"So you think it would be best to leave? Many will mourn you, Gabriel."</p>
<p>"Not all will think I've died."</p>
<p>"Most will though. I know what you've been doing since the war. I know the clues you've been leaving. Unless you tell them specifically, they will think you've died."</p>
<p>"I know. I've told a few trusted of my decision, including you."</p>
<p>"And these few, are they some of the ones you think would be suited to watch over the Faithful Child?"</p>
<p>"They are."</p>
<p>"Who will watch over the Righteous Man?"</p>
<p>"That is Mikey's decision to make, not mine."</p>
<p>"Fair enough. Are you leaving straight away?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Will you be okay, Joshua?"</p>
<p>"I believe so. I'm going to watch over the Garden. Just… if you can, let me know how you are occasionally. Goodbye, Gabriel."</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Joshua."</p>
