  <em>"Still, it's intriguing and beats waiting for Pansy, so he lets his feet carry him down towards the shop front...</em>

  <em>Wait.</em>
</p><p><em>Harry doesn't believe the breezy, singing boy dancing around in Malfoy's Blooms - bitch what? - is really Draco Malfoy</em>.</p><p>
  <em>He refuses to believe it, really, because this Malfoy has a light dusting of freckles over his cheeks and nose, hell, this Malfoy has lips as delicate as the pink tulips littering the shop window...this Malfoy wears suede tunics and white shirts tucked into beige chinos and this Malfoy looks damn good. Harry wonders why no one bothered to tell him the git was back from his 2 year trip to Paris, or why the ex-Death Eater is prancing around in a Flower Shop. "</em>
