  <strong>1999 - Potter Manor</strong>
</p><p>Fred and George would be leaving for Hogwarts next week and Holly was pouting. Neville sat quietly at her side, content to read his book. He and Holly had turned nine two weeks ago. Next week, the Hogwarts term would start and Holly's favorite twins would be leaving for the better part of the year.</p><p>Of course, the twins would be back for Christmas and summer holidays, but that would be ages yet and Neville doubted that Holly would have the patience to wait for them. Recently, since their birthday in April, the twins had stopped by Potter Manor more often than not, wanting to spend time with their favorite kids, or as they called it.</p><p>But Neville could tell that they both really wanted to spend time with Holly and Neville was decidedly grateful that the twins had deemed to include him whenever they came over.</p><p>While Ronald was their age but he was still such a jealous prat that Holly refused to converse with him unless absolutely necessary beyond polite pleasantries.</p><p>Neither Holly nor Neville knew what had gotten into the twins, but they would stop by every other day, or as often as their mother would allow. Holly had greatly enjoyed having their attention when they came over, always up to mischief.</p><p>During their most recent birthday party - it was still a must go event of the year for all the Purebloods, Ronald had accused Neville and Holly of stealing the twins away. Mrs. Weasley had turned a bright red in embarrassment at the loud and rather rude accusation.</p><p>Holly herself turned a shade of red that warned Neville, and anybody else who knew her well enough, that she was about to lose her temper. He was about to go over to his godsister when he saw a head of dark red hair make its way over to the children.</p><p>Aunt Lily had quickly separated the two, Holly's green eyes flashing dangerously. Mrs. Weasley had given Ron to his father who looked rather stern for the usually passive man. She approached Holly with a sad smile and apologized sincerely.</p><p>Neville was glad to see the anger wash away from Holly's face. Breathing a sigh of relief, he suddenly jerked when two hands landed on either of his shoulders. The twins stood on either side of him with charming smiles.</p><p>"Holly sure has-"<br/>"A bit of a temper."</p><p>Neville never knew which was which, usually leaving it to Holly to identify them. She had told him that if he really observed them, he would have been able to see how different their magic was. But try as he might, he had only been able to feel that the twins had magic in their bodies.</p><p>"Ickle Ronniekins is-"<br/>"Going to get a right shouting-"<br/>"When we get home-"<br/>"Later tonight."</p><p>Neville had looked at them warily. His mother hadn't really raised her voice, preferring instead to gently chastise her son with a stern tone. The only time that either of his parents had really yelled at him was when he had almost released the Hooked Pin Ivy from the greenhouse and it had almost captured Uncle Algie.</p><p>Neville shuddered at the memory. He remembered the spanking his mother had given him. And the stern look in his father's eyes as he forbid Neville access from the greenhouse for two whole weeks. He had only been allowed access into the greenhouse the day before his birthday and even then he was already preparing for his sleepover at the Potter's</p><p>Holly had patted his arm in an attempt to console him when he had told her of his grounding. The two had then decided to practice flying, the weather was nice and Holly hadn't been in a reading kind of mood.</p><p>Uncle James had gotten Holly a practice broom as soon as she could walk. They would take turns to fly it - Neville had never owned his own practice broom, not that he wanted on in the first place, Neville much preferred to stay on solid ground.</p><p>But Holly had taken to the air like a duck to water. She could only go about four feet above the ground but Uncle Sirius, who Holly still called Paddy, had tinkered and fixed the charm so that it could go up to five feet of the ground and almost as fast as a muggle bicycle going down a steep hill.</p><p>Holly had whooped with joy as she glided in the air as she raced across the Potter grounds, careful not to get caught by her mother. Aunt Lily had glared angrily at Uncle James and a shouting match that had made the paintings shake had ensued. Or so says Uncle Sirius.</p><p>The Weasley twins had visited, and more often than not Draco with his mother in tow, the four of them would race to the grounds. Draco had his own practice broom while the twins shared the one that Charlie had gotten as a birthday present all those years ago.</p><p>Neville was more than willing to play referee in whatever little racing games that the four of them would come up with. Usually, the twin who wasn't on the broom would be part of the course.</p><p>One time George, Neville was sure it was George because Holly had been calling Fred a red-headed giraffe with how tall he was getting while on their brooms, had hung upside down from a tree branch and each contestant of their little race had to give him a high-five before making a sharp turn back to the racing line.</p><p>Aunt Lily had marched them all back into the Manor the moment she caught sight of her precious daughter doing stunts, that she had deemed too dangerous, on her broom. The group of children spent the rest of the day playing in Holly's room with her army of stuffed toys she had received over the years.</p><p>
  <strong>Wizarding Primary School</strong>
</p><p>Holly and Neville still attended the Wizarding Primary School where both their mothers were teachers at. Lily had been incensed to learn that Wizarding children were totally homeschooled until they reached Hogwarts age.</p><p>Muggleborn children, like herself, had absolutely no knowledge of the Wizarding World whatsoever until she got her Hogwarts letter. Lily had ranted long and hard to both Severus and Alice about how unfair it was. She brought up valid facts, about how she had felt out of place among the other children, knowing she was different.</p><p>How even her own sister treated her differently because Lily was special and Petunia was not.</p><p>Lily never wanted any other magical child to feel like they didn't belong.</p><p>So she worked hard after the fall of the Dark Lord to build a school for students before they were of Hogwarts age. It helped children to get used to the idea of school work, of spending hours away from their families. It gave the children, especially those that had only been home schooled, a chance to interact and socialize with children their own age.</p><p>In primary school, the students had their own practice wands, to help exercise their magic. They couldn't do more than just a simple Lumos or a Nox, but they children enjoyed lighting the tip of the wands and changing it to different colors.</p><p>They also learned basic potion making skills, including the difference between powdered and crushed. Basic knowledge that Lily was sure Severus appreciated as he taught Potions in Hogwarts. She had heard rumors that Professor Slughorn would be returning to teach in Hogwarts in the coming years.</p><p>The children learned basic Latin as well as how to write using quills. Though Lily had been adamant that Hogwarts start using pens to keep up with the times because honestly, it's 1998 people! Not the Stone Age!</p><p>Alice had only laughed at her best friend's antics but she too had kept a pen in her pockets at all time, considering how convenient it was. Self-ink pens were getting more popular in the Wizarding World even if quills were still used by the majority of the population.</p><p>The primary school also covered the basic lessons, English and Math. A science elective was optional for those in their last year before Hogwarts. Holly heard from the twins that it was wicked cool and one time they had made an explosion using only 'volatile' liquids. They were reactive chemicals but Holly saw the spark in their eyes.</p><p>The school was decent sized building with three floors and a large open field. It was actually one of the Longbottom properties that they had converted and built over. They had demolished the farmhouse that had been there and built the rather modern building in its place.</p><p>Children would arrive either in the Floo Lobby or at the Apparition point with their magical parents. The school also had a driveway and a small parking lot for the muggle parents to send off their children. The classes were small, only ten or so students in a year, never more than fifteen at a time. But Lily had suspected that after the war of Voldemort, there would be a baby boom and had taken the necessary precautions to accommodate to larger numbers in the near future.</p><p>Majority of the students were muggleborn or the children of open-minded Purebloods. Lily had even contemplated including squib children but it was an idea for a later date when she wasn't absolutely swamped with her duties as Headmistress.</p><p>The school was protected with strong wards that only allowed the teachers, parents, and students through. Muggle parents had to be keyed into the wards on the first day of orientation to ensure the safety of the children. Lily had even made sure that the school provided healthy meals for the children and staff.</p><p>Majority of the funding needed to start up the school had been from the Potter accounts when it had still been in the planning stages. James had been more than happy to be a silent business partner for his wife to accomplish her goals.</p><p>However, James, with the help of both Sirius and Frank Longbottom, had managed to persuade the Wizengamot to provide a funding to the school. While the Purebloods didn't like the idea of muggles so close to their own children, they had to agree it was much better alternative compared to muggleborn students who enter the Wizarding World completely ignorant of their ways.</p><p>The school started just in time for Holly and Neville to enroll in their first year, being the pioneer batch of students, including the younger of the Weasley children who weren't already enrolled in Hogwarts.</p><p>Draco had joined them in their second year, Narcissa and Lucius had wanted to be certain that the school truly was up to par before enrolling their heir. While the Potter's and Malfoy's weren't on bad terms, partly due to Sirius being Head of House Black and James' mother being a Black, James and Lucius hardly got along.</p><p>Even if Narcissa and Lily met quite often for tea and what appeared to be idle gossip. Narcissa was apparently offered a lot of her help to come up with a curriculum that would have the other Purebloods more accepting of the Primary School. Narcissa provided insight on lessons that all Wizarding children would have been provided while being homeschooled.</p><p>Insight Lily would not necessarily have had considering her own Muggleborn heritage and while Alice was also a pureblood, she was not from a Noble house and her lessons had not been as intensive.</p><p>Muggleborn students would join at random times of the year, usually after they had manifested their accidental magic for the first time. The Ministry had granted Lily a magical device that would alert her when a child had performed magic in a muggle environment.</p><p>Alice Longbottom was the Deputy Headmistress and the ex-auror was also the one in charge of discipline. There had been many a time a mischievous student that would warily eye Neville after a trip to his mother's office. It made Neville shudder at what his mother could have possibly done to them that would strike such fear in their hearts.</p><p>The school had no uniform and Mrs. Weasley actually worked for the school cafeteria. While the Potters were well off and the school stood with the backing of the Ministry, the school could not realistically hire the same number of house-elves that Hogwarts employed to help take care of the grounds.</p><p>From what Holly had mentioned while sneaking into the cafeteria for a snack, there were only ten or so house elves to help take care and run the school. While the school was small and had small classes, ten house elves were barely enough to keep the place running smoothly.</p><p>Mrs. Weasley was pleased to have something to do while all her children were in school. She had only joined the staff when her youngest child, Ginny was old enough to be enrolled in classes. Lily paid her staff well, and the Weasley's looked to be less impoverished when Molly started working in the school.</p><p>Holly had given Draco a hard look that made the blond boy close his mouth before he could tease any of the Weasley children about their mother being a part of the staff. Seeing the boy attempting to control himself - and succeeding (a rare feat), Holly had given him a pat on the head and a bright smile.</p><p>Neville noticed how Draco's cheeks flushed a bright pink as the blond stared after the dark-haired girl who had flounced away. Neville also noticed how the twins had narrowed their eyes at the Malfoy heir. Neville filed away the information away for later, should Holly ever need it.</p><p>Neville quite like the idea that he could keep tabs on other people without them noticing. Holly had regarded him with a keen eye and pat him on the shoulder. "You've got a talent for reading people, Nev." Neville had only looked at his godsister, confused. Holly rolled her eyes at his expression. "You'll figure it out, Nev."</p><p>Holly had said it in such a way that really showed how much she believed in him that Neville had felt humbled. Holly was amazing, she was smart and brave. She had the prettiest green eyes Neville had ever seen. And she trusted him to figure it out.</p><p>Neville was sure he had a bit of slow start compared to the other children, he wasn't as fast to catch up with what they went through in lessons. Holly was always there to slowly guide him in his work and he was glad for that. But he knew sometimes the teacher would have a disappointed look in their eyes at his lack of progress.</p><p>Or the lack of prodigal talent that Holly seemed to ooze from her very core. Even at the age of nine, Holly stood out bright among the other children. Her magical core already glowing steadily, a development that should only have occurred about two years down the road.</p><p>Holly was so smart, Neville had heard whispers of how she should have been placed in the year ahead. Yet Aunt Lily had denied the teacher's requests. Neville had visited Potter Manor one weekend only to see Holly deep in a book of advanced spellcasting the likes only Hogwarts students in their upper years should be reading.</p><p>Neville had only shaken his head, well, of course, only Holly would be so much more ahead compared to everyone else. Holly would not be able to cast any of those spells yet since she was without a wand. Aunt Lily and Uncle James had been quite firm to not allow their daughter to start on wands so early on, regardless of how rapidly her magical core was developing.</p><p>Holly Potter would have to wait until her Hogwarts letter had arrived to get her wand just like everybody else. While being setback from wielding her own wand, it didn't stop the petite girl from reading up ahead on the theory behind the magic.</p><p>"Why don't you move up a year, Hols?" Neville asked in a soft tone as he settled next to her. Holly looked up from her book only to give her godbrother a toothy smile. "And miss out on teasing Draco? Never!" Holly fluttered dark lashes that made Neville let out a deep belly laugh.</p><p>The two settled in companionable silence. It was nice knowing that Holly always had his back. He was sure that Holly hadn't gone up a grade just so that Neville wouldn't be alone in class, of course, Draco was there and also Ronald (who they still didn't get along with thank you very much).</p><p>Looking at their hands that were next to each other, Neville hooked their pinky fingers together. Holly didn't even look up from her book, merely nudging his hand slightly with her own in acceptance.</p><p>Lily found the two children asleep in the library on the soft carpet that in front of the dying fire. Her daughter's dark hair glowed almost amber in the light and dark lashes brushed across soft round cheeks.</p><p>Neville was leaning on Holly's shoulder, mouth slightly open and she could hear his soft snores. His dark blond hair a mess and almost completely hidden by Holly's dark tresses. Holly had unfortunately inherited her father's hair, gravity-defying mess and all.</p><p>It helped that Holly liked to keep her hair long so that the weight pulled down the wayward strands into an illusion of control, unlike James' own nest of hair that could never stay down no matter what they had tried. Lily carefully approached the children and lightly nudged them awake.</p><p>Neville fluttered brown eyes open first, such a deep earthy color that he had inherited from Frank. Light lashes fluttering in the dying light. "Good evening Neville, will you be staying for dinner?" Lily asked kindly, allowing her godson to fully wake up from sleep before he answered with a soft 'yes please, Aunt Lily.'</p><p>"Why don't you wake your sister and come down to the small dining room. James will be back soon." Lily smiled, brushing her hand through her daughter's messy bangs before getting up and walking out of the library.</p><p>Not twenty minutes later when James had stepped out of the Floo, Holly was there to greet her father with an excited, "Daddy!" All bright eyed and messy hair - that was even messier from sleep. Neville was waiting in the dining room with Lily, helping to set the table.</p><p>James carried his daughter in his arms, feeling the weight of her small body and the warmth of her breath and the brightness in her green eyes. Holly really was a perfect combination of her parents.</p><p>Kissing her forehead, he relished in her giggles. "How was your day, Bambi?" He carried his daughter tight in his arms, listening as she told him about her day. James had spent the day with Sirius, settling some paperwork regarding Holly being Heiress to the Black Family. While he wasn't sure if he wanted his precious daughter to be the head of two very prominent families, he understood how Sirius wanted someone he loved like his own to be his Heir.</p><p>Seated at the table, he wasn't surprised to see Neville greeting him with a soft smile. Frank's son while taking after his mother's hair was a mirror image of Frank in every way. James was glad to see that his daughter already had such a loyal friend by her side - even if it was a boy (And he knew Lily would murder him in cold blood if he ever voiced that thought out loud). Dinner went by with chatter from Holly and Lily. Sharing stories from James' work as Head Auror and Neville even proudly talked about the new plant the Longbottom Greenhouse was cultivating. James basked in the warm atmosphere of having his family in his sight.</p><p>Nothing was more beautiful then their smiles.</p>
