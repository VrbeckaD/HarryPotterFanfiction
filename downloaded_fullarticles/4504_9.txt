    <p>Maybe, when James first professed his undying love to Lily Evans, it was a mistake. Maybe, when he proposed to her for the 17th time (but who’s counting?), it was a little over the top. But maybe, just maybe, it helped. The person he loved most knew it, and that must take an immense weight off of his shoulders. Maybe Sirius should do the same. Then again, maybe he shouldn’t.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>It was Saturday afternoon, right after a full moon.</p>
<p>Full moons were Sirius’ favorite and least favorite part of the month. For one, he had to watch as his best friend underwent a pain that no one should have to go through. And yet, there was something that felt right as Sirius stayed behind, long after James and Peter retreated up to the castle, to heal Remus' new wounds.</p>
<p>Sirius hadn't had much experience with non-abusive physical contact until he met James. Through the years, Sirius himself had become more and more comfortable with hugs, hair ruffles, and even the occasional peck on the cheek (only within Marauders, of course. No one else deserves it. Except maybe Lily. That girl is something else).</p>
<p>So it was no surprise to Sirius or Remus when they woke up, sun peeking out of the trees, shoulder to shoulder in a hospital wing bed. Madam Pomfrey always let the boys in; she knew how hard it must be to have a lycanthrope best friend, even if the Animagus state of the three friends was unknown to even Professor Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Siri." A whisper pierced the early morning in the white hospital. Sirius rolled over to face the sandy-haired boy.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Rem?" His voice was still scratchy. Sirius tugged the corner of his lip into a half-smile.</p>
<p>"Thank you." Auburn eyes bore into the dark grey ones. Sirius didn't flinch; he knew that Remus was sensitive, especially now, and though his heart was bursting to free itself, Sirius kept calm and let a soft smile creep onto his face.</p>
<p>"Rem, you say that every time."</p>
<p>"And I mean it every time. I don't know how I would have kept going without you guys. And I never wanted you to do this, but you did, and now I mean, I never have any scratches anymore and-"<br/>
"Rem, we did because we wanted to. Not for you." Remus couldn't hide a small smirk.</p>
<p>"I know. Thank you, Siri." And this time, Sirius just rested his head on Remus' shoulder, and they fell back into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>The boys awoke only when Madam Pomfrey felt the need to hit them smartly over the head with her folded blanket.</p>
<p>"Remus, I know why you need your sleep, but Merlin! You'd've thought Sirius had been given a sleeping draught!"</p>
<p>"Sorry Poppy," Sirius replied, rubbing his eyes and sitting up. "Hey, do you know what time it is?"</p>
<p>"Quarter to six. You better hurry if you want to make dinner. Remus, honey, are you sure you're feeling well enough to go back?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am. This moon wasn't too bad." It was true. Only the second moon after getting back to Hogwarts, Moony was ecstatic about his playmates and barely scratched himself at all. Aside from the usual muscle strains and bruises from the transformation, his injuries were nothing a good rest wouldn't heal.</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey nodded, still worried, but closed the curtains and retreated back into her office.</p>
<p>Sirius wrapped his arm around Remus' waist. He couldn't help but notice that they slid together perfectly. Limping back to the common room, the boys didn't have to worry about any other students getting suspicious about Remus' condition. Everyone else was too busy in the Great Hall, even James and Peter, who had left the Hospital Wing to get to Potions on time. They had tried to get Sirius to join them, but he was adamant on staying. Plus, it wasn't like he could improve anymore. Sirius was already top of the class in Potions, and he didn't even study.</p>
<p>Remus and Sirius finally made it up to the dorm, flopping down on their beds as soon as the door swung closed.</p>
<p>"Do ya think I can skip dinner? I'm not feeling up to it, and we can always nip down to the kitchen if we get hungry."</p>
<p>"Course, Moony." The bedroom dipped into a silence that it had probably never heard before. "...can I come over?" Remus shifted over, and Sirius took that as a yes. He slipped under the covers and turned to face the dark blonde boy.</p>
<p>"Remus?"</p>
<p>"Yes?" Sirius smirked.</p>
<p>"We love you." Remus couldn't help but smile. His friend was the soppiest git ever.</p>
<p>"Go to bed, you twat."</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>"Sirius! Remus! Peter! Wake up! Now! At this very moment! I have an announcement!" James was happy. No, James was dying of excitement. As the three other marauders sat up, still groggy, all they saw was James. James by the dresser, James by the bathroom, James on his bed. He was moving so fast there could've been ten of him in the room.</p>
<p>"Guesswhatguesswhatguesswhatguesswhat!" James' eyes were wide, glistening in the morning sun. Remus rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>"I have a feeling you're gonna tell us."</p>
<p>"Yup! Lily freaking Evans! Guess what she did! She punched me! Right in the jaw!" James was way too happy about this for Remus and Peter's taste. Unfortunately, the third marauder didn't understand what wasn't to love.</p>
<p>"Oh. My. God." By now, Sirius had migrated from his own bed to the window by James. "Did she really? What did you say?"</p>
<p>"Ok ok ok so -- I was in the Common Room this morning, sitting by the fire cuz you guys are lazy. And then, and you won't believe this, but Evans walks in with Snivellus! So, naturally, I stood up and was all like, 'Why is that slimy git in the Gryffindor Common Room?' and Evans goes, 'Piss off, Potter. We're doing homework.' and that's not okay, so I said 'Evans, no one wants him here. His greasy mop blinds us!' and she walked over, looked at me, and then slugged me in the face!!!!" At these last words, James hops onto his bed, landing on top of his pile of dirty robes.</p>
<p>Sirius is no better. He lets out a loud whoop, and -- runs into the bathroom? Remus and Peter share a confused look. James is in too much of a frenzy to notice his sudden absence, but Sirius doesn't take long.</p>
<p>He appears just moments later, quill and parchment in hand. A permanent sticking charm is set on the paper, and Sirius chooses a spot on the wall between James and Peter's beds. The other three marauders had become uncharacteristically quiet, only to hop up and gather around the paper once Sirius had stepped back.</p>
<p>Being Crazy in Love:<br/>
1. Getting excited when they punch you.</p>
<p>And thus a tradition began.</p>
