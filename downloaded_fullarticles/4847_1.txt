    <p>Harry was sitting in the Gryffindor common room, the war has ended six months ago, in the DoM in the heart of the Ministry of magic. Except his godfather Sirius, there weren't deaths on the light side. For the dark side Voldemort, Bellatrix and Yaxley, were dead by the hand of Harry for the former two, and by Remus for the last. The rest of the deatheaters and Dolores Umbridge were ripped off their magic and tossed in Azkaban, minus Malfoy's parents and Snape, who were spies for the light. To say Harry was surprised by the Malfoys turn of coat would be the understatement of the year, but it appear that parents would do everything to protect their children, and that what Lucius and Narcissa have done to protect their only child, but without Dumbledore testament and their admission under Veritasirum, the Dark Mark on their left arms would grant them a one way ticket to Azkaban.</p>
<p>As for Snape, being the adoptive father of the saviour helped his cause a lot. Yes, Severus Snape had adopted Harry Potter in the boy's second year after the fiasco of the stolen car, by the pretext of 'the boy needs someone to discipline him because the muggles clearly haven't done anything'; and Albus agreed. At first it was hard for both stubborn wizards, with time they grow accustomed to each other presence and by summer Harry started calling the older wizard dad. Of course the relationship was kept hidden, the only persons who knew were Harry's best friends and their family, his godparents and his head of house, and of course Dumbledore who pulled every string he has in the Ministry to kept the adoption secret.</p>
<p>Harry was pulled from his thoughts by Hermione's hand waving to catch his attention.</p>
<p>"Sorry, what did you say?" he asked her.</p>
<p>"I was asking you if you have you already chosen what would you sing in the Christmas Ball Performance?" she answered huffing.</p>
<p>"What Ball? And who said I will even participate?"he asked her surprised and angry at the same time.</p>
<p>"But mate, everyone is expecting you to participate" told him Ron who was playing a game of wizard chess with Neville.</p>
<p>"And why is that? I've never been asked nor have I agreed on something like this before" Harry half asked half shout his indignation.</p>
<p>"You don't have to agree, you must do this you are the Saviour" said Ginny who was sitting close to his side, too close.</p>
<p>"You have to set an example to the younger generation, encouraging them to explore art and charity work" added Hermione.</p>
<p>Yeah THE SAVIOUR, after the defeat of Voldemort, that what everyone think of him; funny how some people who accused him of lying and killing Cederic in the beginning of the fifth year, were trying to befriend him after the battle, or more like coming to him when they only need him like now, other times he was treated like the trophy in the shelf; setting up there collecting dust but when needed, he would be brought down, just to show off. Even for his so called best friends he is no more than a tool, all the summer they never asked how he was copping with the loss of his godfather; only asking about ministry galas and parties. If it wasn't for his dad support he would have lost himself to grief.</p>
<p>"And whose idea was my participation in this charity ball?" he asked annoyance clear in his voice</p>
<p>"Mine" said Hermione proudly, of course, "Professor Dumbledore agreed, and even Professor Snape was okay with it after we told him you'll be in, and that you haven't told him because you want it to be a surprise" when he gave her an incredulous look and start interrupting her she rushed to finish her speech "I wouldn't say I am sorry because I lied to your dad, because I needed to lie. I mean people from all around the wizarding world will come to the ball only to have the opportunity to meet you, and when they will know that the performance would be to collect donation to the S.P.E.W, and The Magical Association of Aid of Magical Creatures. Everyone will donate. It's only for charity purpose." She said in her Know-it-all voice.</p>
<p>"Is that so? Hmmm" he said sarcastically "Of course your only purpose is to help associations that YOU have created, huh. And what about orphanages and scholarships?"</p>
<p>"Oh we could help them if there would be a lot of money" she said without meaning it, which Harry sensed. She only wants to prove herself without even giving a single thought of what the Magical creatures want or need.</p>
<p>"Okay, I will participate but in my terms. I will chose the song and each associations share of the donations" he smiled coldly to her.</p>
<p>"But Harry! I've already chosen the Song and the band that will join you; and I've designed to whom the donations would go" she shrieked in horror.</p>
<p>"NO! Those are my terms I choose what to sing what to ear and to whom the money go. Understood?" Harry told her in a strong voice when getting up and detaching himself of Ginny who took hold of his arm.</p>
<p>"B-bu-But HARRY?!" cried Hermione.</p>
<p>"Agree or you will need an explanation, why your saviour will be absent in your party" he told her with DON'T ARGUE WITH ME voice. And walked over the portrait hole taking his leave.</p>
<p>"Al-Alright" Hermione said relieved that he hadn't say no to the band.</p>
<p>"and Hermione" Harry called her "yes?" she looked at him. "There won't be any band too" he smirked to her than closed the portrait.</p>
<p>"At least he will sing" said Ron trying to reassure her.</p>
<p>Yes, she thought, I will count it as a victory, knowing Harry he would easily shifted when using guilt. Or that what she thought.</p>
<p>TBC...</p>
