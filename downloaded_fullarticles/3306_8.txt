          <div class="userstuff"><p align="justify">Something was off when I woke up warm and sweaty one morning.</p><p align="justify">I opened my eyes and saw it.</p><p align="justify">A hand resting on my stomach and a body pressed to my back.</p><p align="justify">Potter.</p><p align="justify">I was ready to call it a night when he came that evening. After we fucked I went to sleep without cleaning myself up.</p><p align="justify">I disentangled myself from him and went to shower.</p><p align="justify">This was the first time he ever stayed the night.</p><p align="justify">I didn’t like it. It couldn’t happen again. I didn’t want it to happen again.</p><p align="justify">I was wet when I stepped back into the room.</p><p align="justify">Potter, sprawled on the bed, naked and sleeping. And warm.</p><p align="justify">He looked so calm.</p><p align="justify">I sat beside him.</p><p align="justify">I lightly touched a new scar on his shoulder. He opened his eyes and looked straight in mine suddenly aware.</p><p align="justify">He yawned. ‘You’re wet,’ he said and reached a hand to my dripping hair.</p><p align="justify">‘And you’re still here,’ I responded. My fingers unconsciously finding his heart.</p><p align="justify">‘Oh. Yes, sorry. I felt asleep, I was tired.’ He yawned again but didn’t move.</p><p align="justify">‘I think it’s time to go, no?’</p><p align="justify">‘Yeah. I’m going.’ No movement.</p><p align="justify">Except he pulled my head down. His lips were dry and hot. His tongue strong and lazy.</p><p align="justify">He sat up and pulled me into his lap. His hand sneaked down to wrap around my cock.</p><p align="justify">My thoughts were a wreck. I wished it would never end. I wanted him to stay. Now and forever.</p><p align="justify">No.</p><p align="justify">I jerked and jumped away.</p><p align="justify">He looked surprised by the sudden turn.</p><p align="justify">I was surprised too. Those thoughts were dangerous.</p><p align="justify">‘Well, this was great but it’s about time you leave. I have stuff to do.’ I was pathetic.</p><p align="justify">‘Okay?’ He stood up, reluctant. I saw he was half-hard.</p><p align="justify">I wanted to go on. To press him into the bed and touch him everywhere, kiss him everywhere.</p><p align="justify">I shook my head, trying to erase ant treacherous notions of my mind.</p><p align="justify">‘Have you seen my wand?’ he asked, already dressed. I rushed to help him look for it. I found it tangled in the sheets.</p><p align="justify">‘Thanks,’ he said as I handed it over and gave me a chaste kiss.</p><p align="justify">When he left I collapsed on the bed and repeated to myself every reason why this thing with Potter had to stop.</p></div>
