    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron and Hermione had been on the road for months, searching for any sign of their wayward friend.  Ron had grown used to the soreness in his legs, the aching of his back.  He would have walked from one end of the earth to the other if it meant there was even a chance of finding Harry again.  Harry was his best mate, and Ron would do whatever it took to get him back. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione stood beside him, taking every step with the same determined set to her jaw.  Ron was glad of the company.  He loved Hermione, in new and evolving ways.  One day, he hoped that she would make him her husband.  They took comfort in each other, in their feelings.  But every time he looked at her, all he could see was the empty space between them where Harry should have been.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There was no time for romance.  Not yet.  They had a best friend to rescue.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After yet another long day of traveling, they'd reached a tavern.  Hermione and Ron made an effort to frequent every tavern and alehouse they ran across.  These were where the stories gathered, where the tales of adventurer's feats and magical might made their home.  It was here, Ron was certain, that they would find their answer.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione was busy with the bartender while Ron had made himself at home in the corner.  The bartenders were always more willing to flirt with a pretty girl than they were to talk to a traveler.  Oh, they'd talk to Ron and tell him what he wanted to know, but it always took more coin than they could afford to spend to make them talkative.  If they ran out of money, that meant they needed to waste time on doing magical odd jobs until they could make ends meet again.  In the end, having Hermione do it was just sound strategy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron tugged gently on the small stud in his left ear, feeding it just enough of his magic to activate the enchantment within.  It had been the twins' design, and a gift to Ron when he told them that he was leaving and he wouldn't be returning until he'd found Harry.  The twins' response had been to give him a number of magical items for both him and Hermione, as well as a huge amount of gold.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Go find him," Fred had said, his jaw clenched.  "You do whatever it takes to bring him home."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Whatever you need," George had said when he hugged him goodbye.  "Whatever you need, you let us know.  We'll get it to you.  Just...stay safe.  Stay safe and bring him back."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron had nodded, his eyes burning.  Harry was family.  Harry was family to all of them,  And the Weasleys took care of their own.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Fred and George sent them money from time to time to ensure that he and Hermione could continue their search.  The twins kept their funds from running completely dry.  But it was the magical artifacts they created that were the most useful in the hunt for Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The spell in the earring flared to life, and Ron allowed himself a small smile.  Focusing on the table nearest the door while pretending to be buried in his cups, he slowly began working his way around the tavern, the enchantment allowing him to hear anyone he focused on as clearly as if they were sitting beside him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was the stories he needed.  No matter how random they seemed, there was always the hope of finding some hint of Harry buried in even the most fantastic of tales.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So Ron closed his eyes, and he listened.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Have you heard?" a bearded man near the fireplace asked.  "The story of the dragonslayer?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That had Ron jerking upright.  There hadn't been a dragonslayer in nearly seventy years.  The story of the last one had been told over and over and over again.  The tale of a young noble who had been captured by a terrible dragon.  A Slytherin, according to the rumors.  One of the last.  The dragon had stolen him while he was out riding one day, and his family had never heard from him again.  They'd recruited countless knights, offered a handsome reward for any information about their son or the dragon who had taken him, but there had been no word.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Until one day, in the small hamlet of Little Hangleton, a stupid lad went to investigate a local cave.  Inside, a man and a dragon had been found dead.  He rushed home to tell the hamlet the story, and one of the villagers recognized the description.  One of the dreaded Slytherins.  Dead.  And the man sounded like the young lord who had gone missing nearly half a decade before.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They stormed the cave, and found things just as the boy had described.  The great beast, dead.  The young lord, standing in front of the dragon, dead as well.  He had died defeating her, but in doing so, he had removed the scourge that had plagued them for so many years.  The king had rewarded his family handsomely for the sacrifice their son had made, and there was a statue in Little Hangleton.  At least there had been.  While Little Hangleton had still stood.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Everyone knew the story of the last dragonslayer, the one who had sacrificed himself to save others.  It was a tale told often at festivals and sung about by players.  There was no reason for the man by the fire to bring it up in such reverent tones.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man's companions agreed with Ron.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"That old story!" they scoffed.  "Everyone knows that story.  It's just a shame that Lord Hangleton didn't know about the egg, or we'd be free of the Slytherins once and for all!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"We are," the man said.  "We are free.  The last Slytherin has been killed."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The words came just in time with a lull in conversation, and the entire pub froze.  Every head in the tavern turned towards the man, Ron included.  The last Slytherin...that was...that was certainly something worth talking about.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You're pulling my leg," one of the men by the fireplace said.  "There's no way.  Everyone would have heard of it by now if it was true."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"When was the last time you heard about Voldemort attacking someone, hmm?" the bearded man demanded.  "That monster's never gone quiet this long!  He's dead, I tell you!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Who killed him?" a woman asked, skeptical.  "If he's dead, then who killed him?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The bearded man shrugged.  "No one knows.  Just that he's dead."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The woman rolled her eyes and scoffed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"As if anyone would slay a dragon and then keep it a secret.  No, that devil's sleeping, I'll bet you.  They do that, sometimes.  Take a decade or two and just rest.  He'll be back soon, mark my words."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Everyone went back to their conversations, but Ron stared down at his cup in deep thought.  He didn't think Voldemort was dead.  The woman was right.  If anyone had managed that, they would have cried it from the rooftops, been showered with gold, their name exalted.  The dragon was still alive and well.  Ron was sure of it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was the story of Lord Hangleton that had him so deep in thought.  The man had disappeared without a trace.  No one had known what had happened to him, had been able to find him by any means magical or mundane, until the body was found.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron pushed back from the table, leaving his cup where it was, making his way over to where Hermione stood, attempting to flirt with the barkeep with an uncomfortable expression on her face.  Ron, too excited to bother to pretend to be polite, reached out and grabbed her shoulder, spinning him so that she faced him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Ron?" Hermione said, a confused expression on her face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"A dragon, Hermione!" he said, unable to contain the feelings coursing through him.  "A dragon!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron watched her confusion morph into understanding, and didn't bother to fight the smile on his face.  He couldn't.  After so long searching they finally, <em>finally</em> had an answer.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"A dragon!" Hermione all but shouted, an answering grin stretching across her face.  "Of course!  Why didn't I think of it before!  That would explain everything, wouldn't it?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron's smile fell of his face as the enormity of exactly what they were saying caught up with him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A dragon. If they were right, Harry had been taken by a dragon.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron swore.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione reached out and took his hand in her own, squeezing it in reassurance.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"We'll get him back, Ron," she said, her eyes fierce with determination.  "We will."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron forced himself to smile at her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'I'm not worried," he said with confidence he didn't feel.  "Knowing Harry, he'll just rescue himself.  Even if he'd guarded by a dragon, he'll find a way out.  That's just who he is."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione laughed, and Ron felt his smile turn to something genuine.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"He'd have it wrapped around his little finger!" Hermione said, still chuckling.  “Made the dragon fall helplessly in love with him."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron guffawed at that.  The idea of some giant, fearsome beast following Harry around with a smitten expression in its slitted eyes was just the thing he needed to cheer himself up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“All without even realizing it,” Ron said.  "That's just how Harry is."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione shook her head, a smile still on her face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"That boy.  So astute about some things, but so oblivious about others," she said with a grin.  "Do you remember that time with the Veela..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They spent the rest of the night reminiscing about the people who had had the misfortune to fall in love with their best friend.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The laughter did them both good.  It was a good distraction from the knot in his stomach.  A dragon.  He and Hermione would have to defeat a dragon to get Harry back.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still, the shivers running down his spine weren't fear.  At least not entirely.  They were anticipation.  Finally.  At last.  After months and months and searching without hearing a word of Harry, they had a lead.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron would get Harry back.  No matter what it took.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">------</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I'm sorry," Ron said, staring into an unfamiliar face.  "What did you just say?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They'd spent four days on horseback, traveling to Camelot.  It was the city with the largest magical library, and Hermione was determined to research anything and everything about dragons before they pursued Harry in earnest.  As soon as they'd arrived, she had disappeared into the vast library, leaving Ron to secure them lodgings.  As soon as he'd found and inn that didn't have too exorbitant a price, he'd made his way to the messenger station he'd seen while he'd been searching.  Charlie was the foremost expert in dragons, and Ron wasn't just saying that because the man was his brother.  If anyone knew anything useful, it would be Charlie.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Out of habit, more than anything else, Ron had asked the woman behind the counter if she'd heard any news about a man named Harry Potter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron hadn't expected any sort of response, so when the woman's face had lit up, and he responded immediately with an "Of course!" Ron had understandably been caught a little wrong footed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You're talking about Harry Potter, aren't you?" the woman Ron had struck up a conversation with asked, turning to face him with a guileless expression. "The man that escaped from a dragon?"<br/>
</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Months. <em>Months </em>of searching.  Just a few months short of a year.  Exhausting every magical tracking option they could think of, talking to everyone they ran into, receiving only shrugs in response.  Traveling for days on end, covering what felt like the entire continent on foot.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"He...escaped," Ron said slowly, not quite understanding the words.  "From a dragon."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The woman nodded eagerly, face alight with delight.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You mean to tell me you haven't heard the story?" the woman behind the counter said.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron slowly shook his head.  It was all the prompting the woman needed to launch into the tale of the Harry Potter, a Sorcerer so strong that he had released himself from an enchantment designed to hold a dragon.  So compassionate that where others saw a savage beast, he saw only a fellow prisoner. A dragon, who, once released, did not turn on Potter.  The dragon Voldemort.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"The only person to ever come face to face with Voldemort and survive," she said reverently.  "The boy who lived."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Oh.  Oh, Harry would <em>hate</em> that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron, fighting to keep a straight face, managed to ask another question.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Did you hear where he was headed?" Ron asked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Back home, to his family," the woman said, a dreamy look on her face.  "What a good son."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron wanted to argue with her, but couldn't.  There was a reason Harry was Mum's favorite.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Where was it?" Ron asked.  "That the dragon was keeping him.  Where was that?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Tiny little town in the middle of nowhere called Riverdale," the woman gossiped happily.  "There was an old, abandoned castle less than half a day's walk from the edge of town.  That's where the dragon was keeping him trapped."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A map of the realm was hung on the wall, so that customers could indicate where their messages were to be sent and the person behind the desk could figure out how much they should charge.  The woman pointed to it, and Ron grinned.  Fred and George.  Harry would be heading to Fred and George.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Now," the woman said, turning make to him, "where were you wanting to send your message."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I've changed my mind," Ron told her.  The message wasn't needed now, after all. Harry had dealt with the dragon himself.  "Still, as thanks for your trouble..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron reached into his pouch and pulled out about twice what the delivery would have cost, placing it on the counter.  The woman's eyes widened and Ron offered her a smile and a wave on his way out of the shop while she stuttered out her thanks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As soon as Ron left the shop, laughter escaped his lips, a relieved, giddy thing that he could not have contained even if he wanted to.  Harry was alive. <em>Harry was alive.</em>  Harry was <em>alive, </em>alive and on his way to Fred and George, on his way back home.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry was alive, and he was coming home.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron ran to the library as fast as his legs could carry him, his vision blurry, laughter escaping his throat until he could laugh no more. When he finally stopped, tears were still running down his face, his throat was raw, and his sides ached, though he had no idea whether it was from laughter or his sprint through the streets of Camelot.  Regardless, he stopped outside the library, knowing he was in no condition to enter at the moment.  Only once he had cleaned his face with his handkerchief and taken a few moments to catch his breath did Ron make his way inside.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Looking for Hermione in a library was always like looking for a needle in a haystack.  Looking for Hermione in a library as big as Camelot's was like looking for a needle in three haystacks.    Normally, it was the kind of thing that would have driven Ron insane.  But not today.   Today Ron couldn't be anything but elated.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was something of an expert at tracking spells at this point, and Ron cast one while thinking about Hermione by rote.  He got several dirty looks for it, but  he ignored them all.   It was bad manners to cast magic in a library, especially a magical one like Camelot's, but Ron didn't care.  He took off up the stairs, making his way towards the direction his magic was tugging him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione was at one of the tables in the heart of the shelves, surrounded by books that nearly blocked her from view.  If it hadn't been for the familiar bushy hair and the tugg of the tracking spell, Ron would have walked right by her, none the wiser.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As soon as he saw her, he broke into a run.  A number of people glared at him, but he didn't care.  This news was too important to wait even a moment to share.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hermione!" he shouted.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She turned around to glare at him, but one look at his face and she stopped.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Ron?" she asked, her voice tentative.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Too afraid to hope.  He was familiar with the story.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This time, though.  This time, after more than a year of searching, it was finally safe.  Safe to hope. Safe to celebrate.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Harry's alright," Ron told her, reaching out to grab both her shoulders.  "He's alright, Mione."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She stood up at once, books forgotten.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"How..." she trailed off when she was all the dirty looks they were getting.  Instead she grapped his hand.  "Come on," she said.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They left the library at a walk just short of a run, and the moment they were outside on the busy streets of Camelot, she rounded on him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Tell me," she ordered him.  "Tell me everything."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron did, faithfully repeating the story he had heard in the messenger's office.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"He's alright," Ron finished, a wide smile on his face.  "He's alright, Hermione.  At Fred and George's, if I had to guess."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione's eyes were wet, and she darted forward, wrapping her arms around him tightly.  Ron held her close, running a hand up and down her back.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"That idiot," Hermione muttered.  "It's just like him too.  Drive us crazy with worry, and then rescue himself."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron laughed, his own vision more than a little blurred.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"That's Harry Potter for you," he said.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Excuse me," a voice said, breaking through the bubble of relief and happiness that surrounded the two of them.  "Did you say Harry Potter?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron looked up, taking in the stranger in front of them.  Wealthy.   Obscenely so, based on his clothes and the sheer number of jewels that adorned him.  Handsome, yes, but something about him had all Ron's hairs standing on end.  Dangerous.  This man was dangerous, and Ron wanted his attention elsewhere as soon as possible.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione clearly didn't see what he saw, if her reaction was anything to go by.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yes!" she said, excitedly, wiping at her face. "Do you know him?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man didn't answer, examining them both with shrewd eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You two," he informed them at last, "have complicated my life a great deal."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The words were ominous, sending chills down Ron's spine, and he called upon his magic, determined to defend the two of them. It didn't nothing to stop the man before them.  He waved his hands, dark eyes suddenly blood red, and Ron felt as if he were frozen solid.  No matter how hard he tried to move, his body would not respond.  A glance out of the corner of his eye let him know that Hermione had suffered the same fate.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man turned around and began walking to the edge of town, and to his horror Ron's feet began to move without any input from him.  Staring at the cloaked figure in front of them in horror, Ron fought.   This stranger had them in thrall, completely under his control.  And no matter how he struggled, Ron could not break the enchantment.  All he could do was watch in horror as he trailed obediently after his captor like a servant.  They followed him all the way out of town, over to a somewhat secluded copse of trees.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron wondered, somewhat hysterically, if this was going to be the place he died.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man turned to him, eyes glowing red, a wide smile on his face that revealed sharp teeth.  His skin rippled, and a moment later a massive figure burst into existence where only a man had stood before.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A dragon.  A massive black dragon, with sharp teeth as long as Ron's forearm.  The blood-red eyes were filled with malice as he glared at the two of them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron had no doubts anymore.  This would be the place he died.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The monster reared up onto his hind legs, his front paws reaching forward, gathering the two of them between his massive claws.  There was a loud snap, and a moment later the sound of flapping began to fill the air.  The dragon lurched beneath them, and wind began to stream between it's claws.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Paralyzed as he was, there was nothing Ron could do but sit there and wait for whatever fate the dragon had in mind for them.</span>
</p>
