    <p>The thunder boomed and lightning cracked like a harsh whip as the tiny boats atop the Great Lake headed for the castle. Each one held three or four shivering students, except for one. This final boat - which was, ironically, far ahead of all the others - held a singular, confident looking student.</p>
<p>She faced the winds head on with the air of one who believed they could defeat the world. By the way she defied the strength of the howling gusts and the thrashing waves, it seemed entirely possible. Her hair stayed obediently in its braid, only the smallest strands of dark brown fluttering behind her.</p>
<p>Not far behind, a huge man was shouting something at her, but she either didn't hear him or ignored him. He seemed to give up, looking annoyed but unsurprised, and turned back to comfort the other terrified students in his boat. She lifted her oars gracefully and swept them through the water, looking unperturbed by the disturbance around her. All around, chaos ensued, and she was in her element.</p>
<p>Not long later, she had docked in the small cove under the castle and was already ascending the stairs. There was a lock on the door at the top of the stairs, but she somehow opened it anyway.</p>
<p>Nothing could stand in her way.</p>
<p>The huge doors opened at the feather light touch of her finger, as if Hogwarts herself was welcoming her. A stern teacher, who was reaching out a finger to open the door, looked positively shocked, but schooled her features into a neutral expression. </p>
<p>The rest of the students had reached the door by the time the teacher, who was wearing emerald green robes, came out of her shock. </p>
<p>She coughed. "I-I am Professor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress. Follow me." </p>
<p>She lead them at a brisk march to an antechamber, where she proceeded to tell them about the Houses, and left with a "I will return when we are ready for you." </p>
<p>The girl flicked her hair over her shoulder and turned to survey her classmates, noting what type of personality they had, and who she would be friends with. She noted with disdain the dropping jaws of her future classmates as a smaller boy revealed a lightning bolt scar that marred his forehead. </p>
<p>She watched as a pointy-chinned boy insulted the boy with the raven hair and green eyes, only to reel back as he was snubbed. </p>
<p>It took everything in her power to keep the stoic expression on her face when the ghosts floated through the wall. She gave them a cordial nod, and watched them freeze in shock. </p>
<p>Just then, Professor McGonagall returned, and the ghosts glided through the opposite wall. She beckoned for them to follow her as she led them into an extremely large hall with an enchanted ceiling--or was that the sky? </p>
<p>"It's enchanted... Hogwarts: a History," a girl with bushy hair spoke. Ah. That would explain why she didn't know. The book was too thick and it looked extremely uninteresting. </p>
<p>The upper year students were all looking expectantly at a ragged looking hat, which looked as if it contained nits. She balked. She would not be wearing that if she had to. </p>
<p>Then the hat began to sing. </p>
<p>
  <em>Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>But don’t judge on what you see,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I’ll eat myself if you can find</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>A smarter hat than me.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You can keep your bowlers black,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Your top hats sleek and tall,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And I can cap them all.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>There’s nothing hidden in your head</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The Sorting Hat can’t see,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>So try me on and I will tell you</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Where you ought to be.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You might belong in Gryffindor,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Where dwell the brave at heart,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Their daring, nerve and chivalry</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Set Gryffindors apart;</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You might belong in Hufflepuff,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Where they are just and loyal,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Those patient Hufflepuffs are true</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And unafraid of toil;</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>If you’ve a ready mind,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Where those of wit and learning,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Will always find their kind;</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Or perhaps in Slytherin</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You’ll make your real friends,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Those cunning folk use any means</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>To achieve their ends.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>So put me on! Don’t be afraid!</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And don’t get in a flap!</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You’re in safe hands (though I have none)</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>For I’m a Thinking Cap!</em>
</p>
<p>The students clapped for the song, and she did too. It wasn't everyday you met a hat who could sing. </p>
<p>"Now, I will call you up. Abbot, Hannah!" </p>
<p>The hat placed her in Hufflepuff, before they moved onto the next student. Before long, "Potter, Harry!" was called. </p>
<p>Immediately, the whispers started. The small, dark haired boy walked uncertainly up to the hat, looking annoyed but resigned. It seemed he didn't like the attention. She frowned. People were not perceptive. </p>
<p>Before long, it called out Gryffindor and they moved on. After Blaise Zabini was called, there was a pause. </p>
<p>"Lady?" This was said in a confused tone. </p>
<p>The girl shrugged and walked over to the stool, where everyone proceeded to gape at her. </p>
<p>
  <em>Really? How childish. </em>
</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall placed the hat on her head, much to her mental protests. </p>
<p>"Oh, I quite agree." </p>
<p>The disembodied voice made her momentarily confused. </p>
<p>"Who are you?" </p>
<p>"I've had many different names, but I also respond to The Sorting Hat." </p>
<p>"Oh," she mentally muttered, feeling foolish. </p>
<p>"Anyway, I'm here to sort you. Ambitious... intelligent... poised... witty... cunning... where should I put you?"</p>
<p>"Somewhere I can succeed." </p>
<p>"Alright. SLYTHERIN!" </p>
<p>She gracefully glided to her House table after removing the hat, noting that her robes now had an emerald and silver trim. A few of her housemates looked almost welcoming, but most of them were scrutinising her quite obviously. </p>
<p>She ate her dinner while looking at the others through the corner of her eyes. It was obvious they didn't trust her, since she had no last name. This was meant to be a sin in the pureblood circles, basically, since she had no family legacy to fall back upon. </p>
<p>After the plates had disappeared when dessert had been eaten, the headmaster stood up and gave his notices. </p>
<p>Lady looked apprehensive when they came to the part about third door corridor death, but this was replaced by excitement as the prefects stood up and began herding them in the direction of the Slytherin Common Room.</p>
<p>It turned out that the entrance of the common room was along a very plain stretch of wall that opened when a password was spoken to it. They then stepped inside the room. </p>
<p>Immediately, Lady's eyes took in black leather couches, a fireplace burning with flames that had a green hue as light was cast upon it, and tables strategically placed around the room. It screamed pureblood, yet looked comforting. </p>
<p>The first years began to sit down near the fireplace in a semicircle formation. The wall opened and an imposing man stepped in. Immediately, a vague memory sprung into her mind. </p>
<p>
  <em>The man towered above her... "out!"... He didn't give her a second glance... </em>
</p>
<p>She was jolted out of her trance as he spoke. </p>
<p>"... Now you must all introduce yourself." </p>
<p>It got round to her after a while. </p>
<p>"I'm Lady. I'm most looking forward to Charms." </p>
<p>After the introductions were done, he dismissed them and left. The upper years came down and started mingling, and it all seemed to centre around a few seventh years.</p>
<p>"There must be a hierarchy," she mused. "Those seventh years at the top, and then those other people trying to get into their good books. But how would I get up there?" </p>
<p>Lady left to find her bed in the dorm room, still trying to figure out how she would climb the hierarchy. </p>
<p>"Yes, the Queen of Slytherin sounds like a good position to have. I either must get into their good books and do enough so they will choose me as their successor, or do something great so they'll elevate me." </p>
<p>She looked at a snake carving on her bedpost. </p>
<p>"I'll think about this tomorrow." </p>
<p>The snake hissed in assent. </p>
