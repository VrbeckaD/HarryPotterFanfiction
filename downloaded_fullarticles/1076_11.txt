    <p> </p><p>Astrid was looking out the murky window, the faint outline of trees in the distance reflecting in her eyes. The slow setting sun melting the blue sky, a soft cushion pressed up against her back and a rough but warm hand placed on her thigh. A million thoughts ran through her head, the people she had lost just shy of four months ago, the pain still burning in her heart. This summer so far had been horrible, people around her pretended they were okay, when really their eyes were almost drained of tears. Astrid had lost so many people in this war, a war she never thought she would survive. Astrid knew she had to do something, she needed to do something to ease the pain. She didn't know how it happened, or when she exactly decided it, but in the spur of the moment, the impulse of her actions she blurted it out.</p><p>"I want to go back." she said fiercely, her brother looking at her with raised eyebrows, his husband sitting next to him with calculating eyes, a small frown placed on his lips.</p><p>"Astrid? What do you mean?" asked Hermione who had stopped dead in her tracks, carrying some crisps, laying them gently on the table as she sat down next to her boyfriend.</p><p>"I want to go back." She repeated more firmly.</p><p>"Go back where?" Ron asked with raised eyebrows, reaching for a crisp.</p><p>"I want to go back to where it started, this whole mess. I want to go back to 1976." All around her people's eyes widened, gasps were stifled and jaws dropped. Astrid expected this if she was honest, it was no simple task, and it was of course a big deal.</p><p>"You can't be serious." Came the reply from her twin's best friend, Ron sat there, blowing out a deep breath.</p><p>"I am." She stated, "I want to go back." "Astrid Lily Euphemia Potter, you will tell me now you're joking." Hermione said, sitting up straight and glaring at the green-eyed girl.</p><p>"I'm not joking Hermione, I want to do this." Astrid said calmly, slouching back into the sofa, the hand being removed from her thigh. "It- the whole thing is too much, the pain, the guilt, I- I need to change something."</p><p>"That isn't the way to do it Astrid! You can't change it! Everything happened for a reason, it's over!" Hermione said sternly, words falling out of her mouth.</p><p>"You don't understand Hermione, this didn't happen for a reason! Voldemort wanted this! He wanted destruction, even now he's dead we still live in his shadows! Don't you guys understand! I hear the cry's of your mum." She gestured to Ron and Charlie, "I see you staring at your mark on your wrist all the time Hermione, yes it's a scar of how strong you are but it's a reminder, Harry and I are branded! Draco still has dry, pink skin where the dark mark was! He's got that scar on his stomach from when Harry was an absolute idiot!" Astrid exclaimed, standing up. "We're all marked with nightmares! Don't you see-" She paused sighed, turning round to face everyone, "I can change that."</p><p>"Astrid you've got this all wrong." Harry started, locking eyes with his twin, "I would love to change it as well but 'Mione's right, we can't change what happened, and yes, these scars are a reminder but please, think this through. There's no logic in it. Come on, don't do a Harry." He said jokingly, slowly creeping towards his twin.</p><p>"I just want to save everyone." She said sighing, eyes locking with Harry’s.</p><p>"I do too." He said sweetly. "But we can't sometimes, as much as I don't want to admit it, you can't save everyone."</p><p>"I wish you could." She muffled angrily.</p><p>"Come on, sit back down yeah?" He said pulling away, "Besides you've got enough here, you've got Me, you've got Pansy, Hermione, Ron, Draco, Blaise, Charlie, Molly, Arthur, Teddy, Andromeda and so many more people. Look around you Astrid, look at what you've saved." Astrid nodded slowly, eyes betraying no emotion of what she was really feeling, no one could see what she was thinking of.</p><p>"Well now that's over." Draco said waving his hand dismissively, "I'd like to discuss the Charity Gala. Will everyone be attending?"</p><p>"Yes, Ron and I will be," Hermione said calmly, eyes still worried. "You know I'll be there." Harry said, winking at his boyfriend and sitting down, "Luna and Ginny will be there as well."</p><p>"What about Blaise and Pansy?" Ron asked.</p><p>"Blaise is coming with Theo and Pansy will find a date, I'm sure." Astrid answer simply, smiling at Charlie next to her, "Charlie and I will be attending as well, with each other."</p><p>"Brilliant!" Draco exclaimed, clapping his hands together, though he pursed his lips and Teddy started crying. "I'll get that."</p><p>"No, no, I'll go." Harry said, already working his way across their living room, Astrid liked it at Harry's and Draco's, it was nicer than it used to be, most of the dark magic was clearing thanks to Harry and Astrid banishing it, though Walburga Black still screeched. Astrid lived down at the coast, she liked the peace and only a few people could enter, other's had to knock on the wards, Harry, Pansy, Draco, Blaise, Ron, Hermione and Andromeda were the only people allowed in through the wards and through direct floo. She smiled thinking about her home, glad that she was also only 20 minutes walk away from Bill and Fleur, who was teaching her French at the moment.</p><p>"I best be off anyways, tell Harry I said bye." Astrid said standing up, everyone rising with her. "Thank you for having me Dray."</p><p>"It's not a problem, you know you're always welcome here." He said hugging her tightly, "Always." He whispered.</p><p>"Thanks, keep treating my brother well!" She joked, hugging Ron and Hermione quickly, Charlie following her out of the living room. She reach the front door, grabbing her purse, tugging on the strap nervously.</p><p>"Can I come over tonight?" He asked sweetly, rubbing at his neck sheepishly. "Not tonight, Pansy's coming over." She said, standing on her tiptoes and lightly kissing his cheek,</p><p>"Maybe after the Gala?" She suggested.</p><p>"Yes, that sounds lovely." He brought her in close, his lips pressing onto hers, Astrid's hands soon tugging on his hair as his hands on her waist brought her even closer, their tongues twirling in symphony.</p><p>"OI!" Harry shouted, "That's still my sister Charlie!"</p><p>Charlie had the decency to look flushed, "Sorry Harry." He called back, eyes still strained on the brown haired girl into front of him, Astrid and Harry looked almost completely alike, aside from the obvious factors that Harry was a boy and had more manly features than Astrid, who also had brown hair, one that had gotten lighter in the sun, the almost ginger red coming from her mum, their piercing emerald eyes were the exact same, Harry's skin was slightly darker than Astrid's who still had slightly pale skin, though not super pale, she was still tanned The two of them had light freckles on their noses, dark eyelashes highlighting their emerald eyes, the colour being shared, she had plump lips, always a little pink or red and a strong jawline, dark eyebrows highlighting her strong yet mischievous nature. Astrid was a Slytherin, she was cunning, ambitious and had brilliant leader ship skills, she was also smart, a brilliant student throughout her schooling, her only competition in a duel was Harry, the two of them always having a go at each other for fun, though Astrid was brilliant at Potions, a natural Snape once said.</p><p>"Well, I suppose you're off then?" Charlie asked, Astrid nodded smiling,</p><p>"Yeah. See you Charlie." She popped her head round Charlie's shoulder, "See ya Hazza!" She shouted, grinning at her brothers frustrated face.</p><p align="center">-----------------</p><p align="left">
  <strong>2 Days Later, August 25th.</strong>
</p><p>Charlie was stood waiting, foot tapping against the floor, back leant against the wall. Ever since Astrid had brought up the topic of going back things had been... different. She had been more distant, a little closed off yet completely the same, smiling and grinning. He hadn't seen her but Hermione had and so had Blaise, Pansy and Theo. Harry had floo called her but him and Draco had been preparing for the Charity Gala which Charlie was going to be late for if Astrid wasn't down here sooner or later. Charlie looked up from his watch, searching the grand entrance hall again, looking for his date, when he spotted her he breathed a sigh of relief and took in the sight of her. Her long hair was curled at the bottom, a few pieces of it pulled back, her eyes glimmered through her long eyelashes, golden eyeshadow complementing the deep emerald green, her lips were coated slightly with a deep red lipstick, her cheeks slightly pink. She was wearing a long black dress, small straps accentuating her posture and back, the dress was elegant and had a slit which her long legs slipped through, outlines by her golden heels. She looked stunning.</p><p>"Good evening Charlie." She greeted, jokingly curtsying.</p><p>"Evening Astrid." He greeted, bowing in front of her and kissing her hand lightly, "You took your time."</p><p>"Well, I did slip over in the shower, rip this dress, don't worry I repaired it," She assured, "And walked into a door!" She finished grinning.</p><p>"Only you." He said shaking his head. "Now come on, Draco will have my head if we're not in there within 30 seconds."</p><p>"Right." She said, taking a deep breath and smoothening down her dress, "Lets go." Charlie knew for a fact that Astrid was nervous, she hated these events, much like her brother though she was slightly worse. She got panic attacks if it was really bad, the way people stopped and stares, the rush of questions or camera flashes. Astrid and Harry both weren't brought up any better than the other. Astrid was left with a rich muggle family, though they weren't any better than the Dursley's, the scars were enough to prove that, though she kept them away under a charm most of the time, as did Harry. When they had first met at Diagon Ally, Astrid with McGonagall and Harry with Hagrid, they were told of their relation, how they were twins. It came a shock to both of them, having grown up without any family's for themselves it was a miracle to find someone who they shared blood with and that loved them. They had immediately got on, going round Diagon Ally together and they stayed the best of friends throughout their first year, stopping Quirrel from getting the stone. Charlie was brought out of his thoughts by a tight grip on his arm,</p><p>"Hey, it's okay." he whispered, the doors in front of him spreading wide, Astrid and Charlie entering side by side, arm of arm. The chatter stopped, everyone staring and whispering, Charlie heard Astrid gulp, squeezing her arm he lead her down the steps, camera's flashing as the chatting started up again, people manoeuvring towards the two of them.</p><p>"Miss Potter, how good to see you!" Isaac Shaquif said, shaking Astrid's hand vigorously, "Mr Weasley." He acknowledged. "So, how is your career going, I expect being Minster of Magic is on the list? Though maybe an unspeakable?" He questioned.</p><p>"Actually," She said, a sweetly evil smile forming her face, "I'm thinking of becoming a lawyer, fighting for equal rights, weather that's for muggle-borns or creatures, I shall be hopefully working with my brother's friend Hermione Granger, which shall be a pleasure, I do not wish however, to become Minister of Magic, that job I shall leave for Mr Kingsley Shacklebolt. Speaking of which," She said, gently guiding Charlie away, "The minister is over there, lovely speaking to you Mr Shaquif." She said politely, venom lacing her voice, you could almost miss it, but you never would, it was too open. "Minster." Astrid greeted, grabbing the Minister's attention.</p><p>"Astrid!" Kingsley greeted warmly, shaking her hand thoroughly, grinning at Charlie, "And Charlie of course, how are you both?"</p><p>"Well thank you Kingsley, and you?"</p><p>"Alright, the Wizengamot have got another case filed against Narcissa Malfoy though." He said sighing, "Having her husband in Azkaban isn't great for her, makes her open to law cases."</p><p>"I'll vouch for her, send me the details of the case, I'll look over it and fight for her." Astrid said seriously, smile diminishing from her face.</p><p>"Thank you Astrid, your presence shall help. The hearing I believe is in two days time, 11 in the morning. My owl shall pay you a visit."</p><p>"Thank you Kingsley. I shall await your owl, have a good evening."</p><p>"Astrid, Charlie." He said nodding at the two, a new conversation being sprung on him as he turned away.</p><p>"Shall we find your brother?" Charlie asked quietly.</p><p>"Yeah, I'd like to speak to him about Narcissa Malfoy, sans Draco." Astrid said, determination displayed on her face. The two of them wandered through the crowd, hand in hand, Astrid ahead of Charlie. They finally reached Harry and Draco, both in a deep conversation with Ginny and Luna. "Hey guys." Astrid greeted, grabbing the four's attention.</p><p>"Hey Asti." Ginny greeted, pulling Astrid into a tight hug, "You alright?"</p><p>"All good." Astrid said withdrawing from the hug,</p><p>"Hey Lu!" Astrid said happily, "How's your article on Wonderful Creatures going? I heard you went to speak to Newt Scamander?"</p><p>"Oh brilliant Astrid! Thank you for asking, and yes Newt is a lovely man, his head fills with Wrackspurts when Tina's around, it's quite sweet really." Luna said in her bright voice, eyes gleaming.</p><p>"How's the Gala going so far?" Charlie asked Draco.</p><p>"Well thank you, we've made a lot of money so far, I think we're up to 10,000 Galleons, though I think Blaise, Pansy and Theo are sure to make some large donations, and of course Mr Shacklebolt who is making his donation on stage."</p><p>"Speaking of stage, shall I help do a last check?" Charlie asked, nudging Astrid slightly.</p><p>"Please, follow me." Draco said, pecking Harry on the cheek.</p><p>"Come Ginny, I want to see if Lycan Scamander is here." Luna said, grabbing Ginny's hand and pulling her away.</p><p>"I need you help." Astrid said immediately, Harry looking at her with raised eyebrows.</p><p>"My help?"</p><p>"Yes, Narcissa Malfoy has sadly had another case filed against her, I can get her out of it, I'm sure, however, in the court I need you there, i need you to testify against her. You haven't done so yet, and I would greatly appreciate it if you did." Astrid said, looking her brother dead in the eye, daring him to say no.</p><p>"I don't know Astrid, you said only if I had to and if you can get her out of it then-"</p><p>"I shall see you in court in two days time at exactly 11 in the morning then." Astrid said smiling. "Please." she added</p><p>"Fine." Harry said rolling his eyes, "You sounded like Draco then."</p><p>"Thank you, I'll take that as a compliment." Astrid said grinning. "Well, I should find Pansy, see you Harry."</p><p>"Bye Ri." Harry said, walking to find Draco and Astrid walking in the other direction to find Pansy, though she was unsuccessful. Draco had gotten on stage, introducing the charity and talking about it before Astrid and Harry walked on the stage saying their part. Astrid owned a third of the charity as did Draco and Harry. The Gala ended about an hour after that, photographs were taken, Kingsley made a donation of 3,000 Galleons and others adding more and more, the total donation reached 33,400 Galleons, something Draco and Harry were extremely happy about - and proud. Astrid was getting read to leave when a hand grabbed onto her wrist, spinning her around. "Pansy!" She said laughing, a small kiss being placed on her lips, a normal thing for her and Pansy to do. </p><p>"Potter." Pansy said grinning, "How are you? Enjoy the night?" </p><p>"Very much thanks Pansy, did you?" </p><p>"I did thanks, donated 2,000 Galleons. Draco told me about what you said the other day, you're a tad mental." Pansy said, a sly grin forming on her face. </p><p>"I am, come round in three day time yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah, see you then." Pansy said, Astrid kissing both her cheeks, waving Charlie over. </p><p>"Weasley." </p><p>"Parkinson." Pansy strutted away, scowling at Charlie, the two of them didn't get on so well. "She doesn't like me does she?" </p><p>"No, now come on, lets go." Astrid said, scooping Charlie's hand up, her lips swiftly pressing on his the two of them <em>popping</em> out, landing on firm feet in Charlie's small apartment, their kissing getting more vigorous and passionate, clothes swiftly being removed as Charlie moved them towards the bedroom, the bulge in his jeans already pressed firmly against her thigh. She backed him up against the wall, a devious smile breaking her lips as she moved her hand down fumbling with his belt. His trousers fell down as she got on her knee's, slowly removing his boxers, Charlie looking down at the sight before him and letting out a groan. <em>This was his weakness. Astrid was his weakness.</em></p><p align="center">-----------------</p><p align="left">
  <b>The next day, August 26th</b>
</p><p>“Morning.” Astrid greeted, figure effortlessly leant against his doorway, his shirt barely covering anything. He sat up, eyeing the sight in front of him, memories overloading him.</p><p>“Damn.” He said leaning back against his pillow as she crawled on top of him, kissing him slowly, lips moving down to his neck sucking on his sweet spot. He could already feel himself getting aroused.</p><p>Astrid made to move off of him but he quickly captured her, brining her lips back onto his, “I’ve got to go.” She muffled.</p><p>“Stay.”</p><p>“I’ve got Narcissa’s case Charlie.” She said, pushing herself off him and straddling his body.</p><p>“Yeah, you go do your work.”</p><p>“Thank you.” She said smiling softly at him. She made to get off him before stopping. “I really would stay you know? But I can’t.” She said seriously.</p><p>Charlie sat him slightly, leaning on his elbows, “It’s fine, you have to do what you have to do.”</p><p>She smiled again at him, this time a little sadder. She brought her lips to his again, this time the kiss was slow and soft, their lips moving in synch. Astrid tried to put her emotions into the kiss, everything she felt. The two of the parted slowly, “Bye Charlie.” She said, buttoning up his shirt and transfiguring her dress into some shorts.</p><p>“Bye Astrid, see you soon.” He said waving goodbye as he flopped back in bed.</p><p>“Bye.” She whispered, taking a last look at him before apperating out, Charlie hearing the pop of her departure.</p><p>Astrid flopped into her chair, freshly showered and dressed, files spread out over her desk, a tawny owl perched on her desk as she wrote to Kingsley, Draco and Narcissa. Astrid knew she needed this case to go well, she needed to know Narcissa would never be convicted again, and Harry would help with that, as well as Astrid being her lawyer, after all, Astrid only took big cases or those important to her. She quickly sent the owl off and started her work, this hopefully wouldn’t take long.</p><p>The next day came round quickly, most of the court attendants discussing who would be vouching for Narcissa Malfoy. Draco sat there, hands clasped tightly together, Harry rubbing his thumb soothingly on Draco’s hand. “She’ll be fine.” Harry whispered,”Ri knows what she’s doing.”</p><p>“I know, I just can’t help it, you know?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Harry said smiling shyly at him. The doors suddenly boomed open, Astrid strutting in hair tied back in a plait, pencil skirt worn, a robe attached to her button downed blouse, a daring smirk plastered on her face.</p><p>“Astrid Potter, representative lawyer or Narcissa Mafloy.” She spoke clearly, nodding at Narcissa who sat on the chair in the middle of the court.</p><p>“All rise.” Amelia Bones instructed, the whole court rising. “Please be seated. The court has gathered here today to witness the trial of Narcissa Malfoy, charges are as follows, playing the role of a death eater, housing the deceased Lord Voldemort in her house and the partaking on the Dark Side of the war.” Amelia said clearly, “Would the separate representative lawyers both rise please.”</p><p>Astrid rose quickly, looking straight ahead of her, feeling Henric Barns eyes on her. “Please state your full names.”</p><p>“Henric Edwards Barns.”</p><p>“Astrid Lily Euphemia Potter.”</p><p>“Thank you, Mr Barns please rise to court and speak.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Barns walked towards Narcissa stopping before her, “Mrs Malfoy, do you admit to housing Lord Voldemort?”</p><p>“I do.” Narcissa said confidently, eyeing Barns.</p><p>“Do you admit to fighting on the Dark Side of the war?”</p><p>“I do.” She said clearly.</p><p>“That is all, thank you.”</p><p>Amelia looked surprised but schooled her features, “Miss Potter, please rise to court and speak”</p><p>“Thank you.” Astrid said kindly, she made her way over to the center of the court, “To start off with, I believe Mr Barns has asked the wrong questions, or not included enough detail, the questions are unspecific and bland. I would like to ask Mrs Malfoy a few questions.” Amelia nodded, “Mrs Malfoy, do you admit to housing the deceased Lord Voldemort through choice?”</p><p>“No.” Narcissa said firmly.</p><p>“Please explain to the court.”</p><p>Narcissa took a deep breath, “My husband, Lucius Malfoy, had disappointed the deceased Dark Lord, he then took it upon himself to use our home as his base, he said if we didn’t, we wouldn’t free Lucius and he would injure Draco severely.”</p><p>“Okay, that answers your question Mr Barns, yes she housed him, but not through her free will, but through black mail. Now, do you admit to fighting on the Dark Side of the war but later switching sides?”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“Okay, I would like to ask my witness, Harry James Potter, to step forward and present the evidence of this matter.”</p><p>Harry got up, taking a seat next to Narcissa, “Please explain your evidence Mr Potter.” Astrid said smiling at him.</p><p>“Okay, so when the call came for Astrid and I to come to the forest, I left Astrid and went myself, when I got there Lord Voldemort immediately killed me however, my sister’s love protected me and of course, I was a horcrux, so I survived, Narcissa volunteered herself to check if I was dead, she walked forwards and I nodded, showing her I was alive and she pronounced me dead to Voldemort.”</p><p>“Thank you Mr Potter, please return to your seat, now, from our witness we can clearly see Narcissa’s change in sides, she chose to keep Mr Potter’s living status a lie, deceiving the darkest wizard of our time, who was indeed a powerful mind reader, she did this all to protect her son and our side of the war, she saw hope and a reason to live. Mrs Malfoy here is the reason for our sole existence, she still fought for us when we were giving us, in fact, I think we should be giving a round of applause to her.” Astrid said in a stern voice, smugness entering at the end, she looked over at Barns smirking.</p><p>“Under national law decree 36, it states ‘All death eaters branded with the dark mark are to be taken to custody at once and to be life imprisoned in Azkaban in a maximum security cell.” Barns stated.</p><p>“You are quite right Mr Barns, it’s swell that Mrs Malfoy here isn’t a death eater.”</p><p>“She has the mark!” Barns exclaimed.</p><p>“Mrs Malfoy, if you will, please roll up your left sleeve.” Narcissa did as told, her left forearm showing nothing but skin. “As you can see, Mrs Malfoy does not have the branded dark mark.”</p><p>“But-but he does!” Brans shouted, pointing a finger at Draco, Harry now snarling at him, ready to fight.</p><p>“I believe we are not here for the trial of Draco Malfoy which has already happened and he was found not-guilty however sentenced with 2 months of probation which he has completed and he has set up a charity, I think that’s more than you’ll do in your lifetime.” Astrid spat back.</p><p>“Silence!” Amelia shouted, “Do the court find Mrs Malfoy guilty and sentenced to 10 years in Azkaban in a high security cell, or not guilty, one month of probation. Please rise if you find Narcissa Malfoy not-guilty.”</p><p>More than half of the court rose, including Amelia herself and Astrid grinned, “NOT-GUILTY!” Amelia shouted, collecting her papers and smiling at Astrid.</p><p>“Well Narcissa, one month probation, that’s good.”</p><p>“Thank you Miss Potter, truly.”</p><p>“You saved my brother, I shall forever be in debt to you.” Astrid said, nodding at Narcissa and hugging her brother and Draco.</p><p>“Thank you Astrid.” Draco said firmly, “Really.”</p><p>“It’s not a problem, that’s the last time it will happen.” Astrid took a deep-breath, “I hope you live your life well Narcissa, spend it doing things you love.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Narcissa said kindly, “Maybe I can send an owl to you to schedule afternoon tea?”</p><p>“Sounds lovely, I do hope we can do that one day.” Astrid stepped forwards embracing Draco, “You keep taking care of my brother yeah?”</p><p>“Of course I will you numpty.” Draco replied grinning.</p><p>“Thank you Draco, for everything.”</p><p>“Don’t get sappy on me Astrid, it’s only a court case.”</p><p>“Only a court case.” Astrid said smiling, hugging Harry tightly, “Thank you Harry, for doing this. And everything really, I don’t deserve a twin like you, I love you lots.”</p><p>“I love you too Ri, but where’s this coming from hm?”</p><p>“I just realized you don’t know what could happen, so I thought I’d let you know I love you.”</p><p>“Thanks Ri.”</p><p>“See you Harry.” She said, waving goodbye as she excited the now empty court.</p><p align="center">-----------------</p><p align="left">
  <strong>1 Day Later, August 27th.</strong>
</p><p>It was 11 am when Pansy turned up, a small bag on her shoulder, wand in hand and a steady face. “You’re an idiot.”</p><p>“I know.” Astrid said, bag full as well, wand in her sock. “But you’re one too for coming with me.”</p><p>“I’m not leaving my best friend.” Pansy sighed, “Got everything? There’s no going back.”</p><p>“Lets do this.” Astrid said, grabbing Pansy’s hand as she attached the necklace around them both. “Lets do this.” She repeated again.</p><p>Harry walked out of Astrid’s fireplace, jumper on him and a bottle of wine, “Astrid!” He shouted but was greeted by silence. “Astrid!” He tried again walking further into the house again the sound of silence greeting him. Dread filled his stomach as he walked further into the house, the darkness greeting him. “Lumos.” He whispered, the light brightening up her living room, a small note left on the table.</p><p>
  <em>“To whoever finds this note and to those who the person who finds this note shares this note with,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’ve decided to go back, and I know you’ll all be royally pissed at me and I understand that, but please do not worry, I will be back soon, you won’t even notice I’m gone. Pansy has decided to come with me as well which shall hopefully put you at a bit more ease as she tends to shoot down my impulsive ideas.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I needed this a lot, I lived with the guilt and call me selfish but I couldn’t, it would grow and never leave. Below I have written messages to each of you, I hope after reading them you may understand better or you understand me better and my goodbye’s. </em>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>Dearest Harry, </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>You’re my twin, my brother, my best friend and I hate to do this to you, to go against your wishes but when have I ever followed them? I know right now you’ll hate me, but please don’t. I know it’s a blind thing to ask, and possibly very stupid, but I needed to do this, I needed to go back. I’m not sure how long I’ll be gone for but I do hope to hear about your adventures when I come back and I want three children from you and Draco along with Teddy. I want to tell you so much Harry, like how I treasure you and how you’ve helped me become the person I am today, and I will, when I come back. I hope your life blooms and is beautiful in every way shape and form and please do not worry about me. I love you so much and will miss you the most. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>-from your 1976 girl, Astrid. </em>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>Dearest Draco, </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I’ll keep this short, thank you for being my other best friend, listening to me rant, vent, scream, cry, shout, laugh and everything in between, I’m going to miss your sarcastic comments and your digs and your husbands hair. Speaking of which, please take care of him, Harry will not like I’m gone, he’ll scream and cry and he might take it out on you, but please, I’m begging you, do not leave him. You are everything he has and he values you and loves you so much. I know that you’ll take care of him for me Draco. I’ll miss you a billion you asshole. </em>

  <em>-Astrid xoxo</em>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>Dearest Hermione, </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Hi Hermione, I do hope when I come back you don’t kill me, but I hope you take interest in this matter and take it upon yourself to do research when I do come back, and hopefully things will have changed by then. Though I think you know the truth, I’ve done a little disguise here so no one can- </em>
</p><p>
  <em>-Astrid xo. </em>
</p><p>Harry scanned the rest of the paper looking for Astrid’s words to Hermione but they weren’t there and Harry couldn’t read them. He didn’t think he ever would. He carried on reading, putting that thought to the side.</p><p>
  <strong> <em>Dearest Ron, </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Keep beating Draco’s ass at chess and keep Hermione sane, I’m also expecting to see at least two Granger-Weasley’s when I come back, if not, I’ll be disappointed and might lock you two in a room together like last time. I will miss you immensely and I can’t wait to beat you in chess when I get back. And yes I will win, don’t you doubt me Ronald. Can’t wait to see you!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>-Astrid your brill chess opposition. </em>

  <strong> <em>Dearest Molly and Arthur, </em> </strong>
</p><p><em>Where do I start with you two? You took Harry and I in when we had no where to go, you became parental figures in our life and looked after us in the summer when we were allowed to stay at your lovely home. You became everything we needed and wanted in life and I will forever be in debt to your kindness.

  <em>Well, thank you I suppose. You have been my rock, you were there for me through my darkest moments and you taught me to breath again, to see clearly. I hope when I’m gone you’ll find love, someone who makes you smile on your rainy days, someone who loves every single piece of you just like I did and more. I hope you’re happy Charlie, because you deserve the sunshine and more. I will never be able express how much you mean to me. I hope you find what you’re looking for.</em>

  <em>-A girl that was indeed very much in love with you. Astrid xoxo</em>
</p><p>Harry had stopped reading, he didn’t know if he could go on because there were so many, he knew his sister was impulsive, a very Gryffindor quality, but he didn’t think she would ever do this. He felt the tears slip out of his cheeks and turned around, the letter hung loosely between his fingers and the floor roared and for once, Harry wished Draco wasn’t stepping out, Harry wished it was Astrid.</p><p>“Harry?” Draco said worriedly, rushing forwards to hold him.</p><p>“She’s gone.” Harry said collapsing in Draco’s arms, the sobs filling the empty house that Harry wondered would ever be full again.</p>
