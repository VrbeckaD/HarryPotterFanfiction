    <p>The child was wailing again, it wailed and howled from within the dwelling the white owl had stationed herself outside of the small house in the hideous unassuming neighborhood. The owl watched helplessly as the cruel rake of a woman dragged the filthy, second hand crib outside into the backyard and went back inside leaving the child to sob miserably into the cold, heartless sky. The owl left her perch when she saw the harpy return to her house, flying down to the freezing child. She could smell the hunger on the young infant, it looked to her with miserable hope, and yet resignation, used to rejection. </p>
<p>Young and small though she was, she puffed her downy feathers out as far as she could, desperately trying to warm the child. Hooting and nuzzling him gently, trying to get him to open his slim, far to dry mouth. She looked into the human eyes and she somehow knew that he was hers. Her owlet, as much as she possibly could with those awful creatures in the house. They wanted her owlet dead, as evidenced by leaving him outside to grieve in his hunger and fear all alone in the night. She would prevent that fate no matter what she had to do.  </p>
<p>With this determination in hand she gently coaxed his mouth open finally, hoping he wouldn’t reject the nourishment and allowed her own hard earned meant to travel down the gullet of her owlet. The baby coughed at the taste, but instinct and an aching, empty stomach kept him from spitting it out. It was nothing compared to what he needed, but it was enough that he wouldn’t starve for tonight. Not daring to leave him to hunt for more she stayed with him, giving him warmth throughout the cold dark night. The owlet stopped crying after a long time, finally, still hungry, but at least warm, feeling the first bit of love he had been given in what seemed like forever. </p>
<p>The owl dared not sleep for fear of her newfound owlet passing as she did, so hungry and weak he was.  She saw the dawn growing in the east, the oppressive dark slowly letting its grip be eased, allowing that it would not be taking the life of the boy that night. It was only then she felt safe enough to leave the child to hunt, never straying beyond the garden, feasting on the mice and lizards within it. Keeping none of it for herself, she knew she only had a short amount of time to feed her owlet before that hideous creature took him back inside the dwelling, she spat up as much into the boy as she could in the little time she had, knowing that no matter how much she gave the boy could not be full with how little she could produce and how much was needed. Still she tried, making many trips, the boy slurping down as much as he was given. </p>
<p>The woman came back out and screeched the owl away, looking down scornfully at the boy, sneering as if to say even as a snack for the owls you fail. Dragging the crib back inside before her neighbors saw what she had done, pushing him into the cupboard under the stairs where he would grow up and shutting the door before starting her day. The owl watched every single movement, her heart breaking with every muffled cry coming from behind the door.</p>
<p>It would be a long many years before she could teach her owlet to fly away from here. If she managed to help him survive.</p>
<p>Thus begins the life of Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived.</p>
