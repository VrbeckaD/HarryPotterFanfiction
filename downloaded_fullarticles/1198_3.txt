    <p>It was a cold December evening at Hogwarts when Severus Snape placed a black candle on his desk to light the room.</p><p>He was about to mark essays so he struck a match to light the candle. The match lit and he placed it on the wick.</p><p>Sighing, Severus sat down at his desk. He dipped the quill in ink when he smelled a burning odor.</p><p>He inhaled deeply to guess the source. Severus coughed uncontrollably as the scent entered his lungs.</p><p>Finally succumbing to the incense of the candle, he fell from his chair unconscious from the heavy fumes.</p><p>I was walking to ask Severus if I could borrow some ingredients for Dreamless Sleep Potion when I heard a thud inside the classroom.</p><p>"Sir?" I knocked on the door and then opened it when there was no answer.</p><p>I ran in when I found him sprawled on the floor next to the desk.</p><p>The candle that was burning caught my attention and I blew it out.</p><p>I knelt down by the Potions Master who was unresponsive. He seemed dead.</p><p>I placed my lips to his and gave him a quick breath followed by three presses to his chest.</p><p>On the second breath I forced into his lungs, a piercing gasp filled the room.</p><p>Onyx eyes flew open, peering at me. The black haired man wheezed harshly and coughed loudly.</p><p>"What do you want, Miss Broadway?" He sneered at me. "To take more of my ingredients?"</p><p>Severus stood, hovering over me.</p><p>I looked up at him in shock. "Are you quite alright, sir?"</p><p>The raven haired man wheezed again and coughed. He turned his back to me as I stood up, too.</p><p>Severus coughed forcefully until his lungs were cleared of the candle smoke.</p><p>"I came to ask nicely, sir." I said softly. "I'm glad you are ok, but I didn't come to take anything."</p><p>Severus coughed again. He sighed deeply, facing me again. "Very well, I shall take you to the storeroom. There shall be more ingredients there."</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>"What was that candle?"</p><p>Severus took a deep breath and sighed from his lungs. "It must have been a stray poisonous candle. I did not bother to check before lighting it. It can kill, if exposed to long enough."</p><p>"Are you saying that you could've died?"</p><p>He gave me a look of gratitude. "Yes."</p><p>Severus sighed as we walked the corridors. "I am being rather generous by allowing you to use these ingredients. Let us call it even, Miss Broadway."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Severus smirked. "You've very welcome for saving my life."</p>
