    <p>Jamie Johuntan wasn't liked by her peers. Through her six years at Hogwarts, she had yet to make a single friend. Perhaps it was because she was weird. She knew that. She knew that not even her own house liked her. Even her family disliked her enough to disown her. Everyone at school made sure to remind her. They make fun of her, take her things and jinx her. They called her 'Little Devil' because of the identical circular red scars on either side of her forehead. </p>
<p>Jamie didn't mind the scars. She fix her brown hair to be pulled back in a braid, often times flashing the scars. The teachers knew how she got them. They knew why she didn't go home at holidays. </p>
<p>But she was the brightest witch in the school. She had top marks in all her classes and was her teachers favorite. They would often ask her to tutor other students and she'd be glad to help them. Most students were thankful for the help until the found out that Jamie was the one that would tutor them. </p>
<p>All first years knew to stay away from her. That she was weird and would spread her 'weirdness' to them. </p>
<p>Jamie sat by herself during the sorting. No other sixth year or anyone else wanted to sit with her. She would always clap and cheer for everyone who got sorted, regardless of if they were Ravenclaw like her or not. The first year Ravenclaw's eye her wearily and the whispers start. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Nymphadora Tonks knew that she was falling behind in her classes. Just a little too much goofing off and she'd slipped. Because of her suffering grades and her ambition to be an auror, Professor Sprout told Tonks that she knew someone who could tutor her. </p>
<p>Tonks was relieved, thanking her head of house for going out of her way to help her get back on track. </p>
<p>The words die down when there is a knock at the door and Professor Sprout opens it. </p>
<p>"Bloody hell," Tonks whispers as the resident 'Devil' herself enters the room. </p>
<p>"You know Jamie, don't you?" Sprout smiles. "Top of herbology in all years. Smart one." </p>
<p>Of course Tonks knew Jamie. How could she not? Jamie was famous for the little scars on her head and known for being an oddball. She knew that Jamie had no friends and was ruthlessly teased for being disowned. But Tonks has had yet to have a conversation with the weirdo. </p>
<p>"You want Johuntan to tutor me?" Tonks blurts. </p>
<p>"Yes, dear," Sprout nods. "Jamie has passed nearly all her N.E.W.Ts and is doing independent study for most of her time. She'll have plenty of time to help you catch up." </p>
<p>Tonks supposes that this was the universe punishing her for skipping classes and goofing off. </p>
<p>"Alright, I suppose," Tonks nods. "Johuntan can tutor me." </p>
<p>Jamie looked surprised at the answer. "I'll tutor Tonks."</p>
<p>"Excellent," Sprout clasps her hands together. "I'll leave you be to work things out. Oh, and Jamie, be a dear and deliver those note you were talking about." </p>
<p>"Yes Ma'am," Jamie nods, giving a two finger salute to Sprout before turning to look at Tonks. "Shall we discuss this matter at another location?" </p>
<p>Tonks can't help but let out a sigh. "Sure. Lead the way." </p>
<p>Jamie does just that and moves to walk down the halls, waving the the paintings as she passes and occasionally commenting on how vibrant they look today. </p>
<p>Tonks just sulks behind her. </p>
<p>Jamie turns the corner and two seventh year Gryffindor's spot her, grinning. "Well, well. If it isn't our little freak." They advance on Jamie and Tonks feels her hand fly to her wand. </p>
<p>The first grabs the front of Jamie's robes. "Where do you think you're going, huh Johuntan?" </p>
<p>"I was merely escorting Miss Tonks to our place of meetings," Jamie blinks at him. "Would you please put me down?" </p>
<p>The boy sneers and lets go of Jamie with a shove, sending her crashing into Tonks, who was rather clumsy. The two girls collapse into a heap on the ground as the boys move away. </p>
<p>"Get off me!" Tonks snaps, shoving the smaller girl off of herself. "Why did you let him grab you like that?" </p>
<p>Jamie tilts her head at Tonks. "What else would I of done?" </p>
<p>"You could of hexed him," Tonks suggests. "Or threatened him. I would of gone with the good ol' kick between the legs if he grabbed me like that." </p>
<p>"But then I'd get punished," Jamie frowns. "No. I don't want that. Anywho, terribly sorry for the interruption. Shall we continue our walk, Miss Tonks?" </p>
<p>Tonks frowns at the hand pushed in her face and doesn't take it, settling to standing up on her own and following Jamie again.</p>
