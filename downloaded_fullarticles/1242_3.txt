          <div class="userstuff"><p>The storm blew in like they’d said it would.</p><p>He’d packed for it but somehow still burst into the Bronze Chalice soaked to the bone. His wool sweater and twill coat were no match for the tempest outside; his distracted and scattered thoughts led him astray, and he’d failed to remember to cast a single charm to repel the weather.</p><p>“Harry,” a familiar voice called from a nearby booth.</p><p>He ignored it.</p><p>He wasn’t ready to focus on the mission again, to let scenario after scenario play out. Each instance, something more terrible and horrendous than before would befall his partner, and Harry was powerless to stop it.</p><p>It hadn’t always been like that. But when one realises they’re in love with their partner, the stakes shift, and things get infinitely more complicated. Two years and half a dozen missions later and Harry had gone from confident and capable Junior Auror to a wet mess of confusion and unrequited tension. He couldn’t let himself get swept up in those emotions. It was bad enough that they had to spend the night together and finish the final details of the mission.</p><p>“You’re dripping all over the floor.”</p><p>With a rough shake of his head, Harry was only able to partially rid his hair of its wetness.</p><p>“Don’t do that. It makes you look like a dog.”</p><p>Finally, Harry raised his eyes. In the dreary, dim light of the tavern off Brebuff Lane where broken things got more broken and wandering souls lost themselves completely, he found a sliver of salvation in the sharp, stinging grey of Draco Malfoy’s eyes.</p><p>“Better a dog than a ferret,” Harry quipped and then attempted to cast a discreet drying charm, only managing to add a bit of warmth to his wet clothes. He sat down across from Malfoy and vowed to rid any thoughts of those grey eyes from his mind. “Anyway, I’ve just been down the street at the proposed site of the swap.”</p><p>Malfoy frowned. “Let me guess, you don’t like it.” “I don’t like—” Harry narrowed his eyes at the interruption, and suddenly all the worst-case scenarios he’d been trying not to fixate on came flooding back into his mind. “It’s dangerous! The alley is too narrow.” He banged a fist on the table. “I’ll never be able to see you clearly from the roof.”</p><p>“Look, Harry,” Malfoy said, and his name rolled off his tongue with such easy warmth one could almost assume he’d been saying it that way all his life. He hadn’t, of course, and because of that fact, the warmth of it weighed on Harry, on parts of him he hadn’t known he had. “I can take care of myself,” Malfoy continued.</p><p>“I know you can.” Harry sat back and crossed his arms. Malfoy was shrewd and unfeeling in the field, and the thought of that side of him sent an icy shiver down Harry’s spine.</p><p>Malfoy leaned forward, and the light hit eyes in just the right way, making the irises shine like liquid silver. “I would get out of those wet clothes if I were you, or it won’t matter that there’s no line of sight to the roof tomorrow. We’ll all hear you sneezing in the alley below.”</p><p>“If I didn’t know better,” Harry licked his lips, “I’d say you’re being thoughtful. Considerate even.”</p><p>“Maybe I just want you to take off your clothes, hmm?” Malfoy finished off his firewhisky and stood. “We shouldn’t loiter down here, we might be recognised.” He motioned for Harry to follow him up the stairs.</p><p>They ascended a steep staircase, meandered down a long hallway, and stopped in front of the very last room. Harry couldn’t focus on the mission, he could barely keep his eyes off Malfoy’s form in front of him. The mix of his worry and concern with the playful, teasing words off Malfoy’s tongue had Harry’s head spinning. He didn’t know what to feel. It wasn’t until Malfoy tapped his wand three times on the door to their room and it creaked open that Harry found any clarity.</p><p>Malfoy stared at him from the doorway. “Coming?”</p><p>In those grey eyes, Harry found a momentary respite from the chaos in his head. “Yeah,” he said and followed Malfoy inside. The room didn’t look as derelict as the rest of the tavern, but after a few blinks, Harry wasn’t paying attention to the furnishings. All he could focus on was the fact that there was only one bed.</p><p>“The department sanctioned two rooms,” he croaked. At barely a whisper, he added, “At least two beds?”</p><p>“Shall I go down to the Concierge and rectify this mistake?” Malfoy offered, his tone disinterested and almost snide. “Let me just announce to the room full of miscreants and criminals that we’re two undercover Ministry officials.”</p><p>“Fine,” Harry said. With his pulse racing at the thought of Malfoy’s proximity, Harry glanced at the rocking chair in the corner. “I’ll take the chair.” Malfoy sighed. “No need. I’ve cast a discreet Extension Charm on the mattress.”</p><p>Harry reexamined the bed and thin padding beneath the quilt. “Would we call that a mattress?”</p><p>“Wishful thinking,” Malfoy replied. “Now then, we need to solidify the plan for tomorrow.”</p><p>“I won’t do anything that puts you at great risk,” Harry blurted before he could stop himself.</p><p>“As if I have never been in dangerous situations with Dark and dangerous people.”</p><p>“You know,” Harry turned back and said, “I should be the one to do the handoff. I know this group and their tactics just as well as you do, and I have more experience with this—”</p><p>Malfoy threw his hands up. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>Harry frowned. “And why is that?”</p><p>His face closer than ever, Malfoy pushed a finger into Harry’s chest. “You don’t get to change the plan halfway through! You don’t get to raise the stakes!”</p><p>“Stakes?” Harry asked. “You want to talk about the bloody stakes? They’ve never been higher!” He whirled around to face the wall and try to calm down. His feelings were bursting from the core of him, and he couldn’t risk saying anything else.</p><p>Over a minute passed in silence until he felt something in the room shift. Harry froze when hands wrapped around him from behind and started unbuttoning his coat.</p><p>“Either way...” Malfoy lowered his lips to Harry’s neck and started trailing warm kisses down the side of his throat. “You won’t be <em>anywhere</em> tomorrow if you’re half dead before sunrise. What kind of—” he paused and kissed the spot just below Harry’s ear. “—partner would I be to let that happen?”</p><p>“P-partner?” Harry managed to get out. He turned his head just in time to see Malfoy’s smirk. “Is that all this is to you?”</p><p>“What?” Malfoy pulled away and walked to the vanity, leaving Harry breathless and uncomfortable in his now too-tight, wet trousers. “You still don’t get it, do you?” “What?” Harry croaked.</p><p>Malfoy snorted. “Oh Harry,” he shook his head, a look of resignation on his face, and headed for the door. “One day I’ll act on this scorching thing inside me. One day…but today,” he opened the door and turned around. “Today, I’ll just have another drink and think about the way you look at me—the way you burn me from the inside out.”</p><p>“Christ, Malfoy, I can’t even tell if you’re serious.” Harry threw himself forward. “Be honest with me.”</p><p>“I think we both knew the minute we got this assignment,” Malfoy stepped back into the room and shut the door. “I think we knew that by the end of this...things couldn’t stay hidden beneath the surface.”</p><p>“Things?” Harry met his eyes. There it was again, the grey that sliced through him and left him gaping open, vulnerable, unabashedly devoted.</p><p>“Things,” Draco whispered against his lips.</p><p>And then he kissed Harry like the roaring tempest outside. His touches were desperate, his fingers rough and selfish. Draco sought out parts of Harry he’d never shown anyone, but he relished in the newness of it all. Harry came alive with each electric touch, so far gone and blissed out he couldn’t remember when they’d moved to the bed. He couldn’t remember breathing in anything other than Draco, he could barely remember his own name by the time they’d finished, spent, heaving in gasping breaths against each other.</p><p>The storm blew in like they’d said it would.</p><p>Though he’d known it was coming, Harry hadn’t been prepared. Even after all these years, he had no idea how to prepare for Draco Malfoy.</p><p>But then again, some storms you just don’t see coming.</p></div>
