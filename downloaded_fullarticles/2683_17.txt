  <span>“Your goal is to document and report, and most importantly not to get involved,” Dominique Graves instructs, pacing in front of the recruits as she speaks. Twenty of America’s best magical historians stand before her, all listening carefully to what she says. “The fragility of time is something that should not be taken lightly, and any disturbance, intentional or not, will be considered an act of treason.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tina shifts uncomfortably in her boots. She’s one of the youngest in the group and getting invited to travel the past was and still is, a huge shock. The project is submerged in such secrecy that Tina has taken to looking over her shoulder at every turn. Now that Graves is talking about treason, she worries that she may accidentally mess everything up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Rest up recruits, tomorrow you go back.” With a stiff nod, Graves leaves the room and the shoulders sag of each in the lineup.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Most of the historians are in their sixties or seventies, the outliers of the group include a woman well over one hundred then, Tina, and Lysander at the other end of the scale. Lysander Alexander ‘Yes, I know it’s a terrible name’ Scamander is in his mid-thirties, making him a good ten years older than Tina is.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He approaches Tina as everyone starts to leave. “Are you okay?” He asks curiously, his hands in his pockets as he projects some sort of calming aura that she’s always associated with him. “You look pale,” he adds on for an explanation behind his question.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m fine,” Tina responds. In truth, she’s feeling more anxious than ever before. “Are you excited?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lysander considers the question before nodding. “I don’t want to fuck everything up, obviously, but this is going to be such an extraordinary learning experience.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re right,” Tina says walking with Lysander out of the deepest part of MACUSA. “What if I sneeze and it distracts someone, then the whole future falls apart? I want to do a good job.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tina, listen,” he turns to her and puts his hands on her shoulders. “You’re one hell of a smart witch, you’re not going to mess anything up.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You don’t know that,” Tina says, shrugging off his hands.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I do, because if you did royally fuck up, then the entire future,” he shakes his head and corrects himself, “the entire present would be fucked up.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Or I did fuck up the present already reflects it,” Tina says with a scowl.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s the spirit!” Lysander says brightly as they continue on their walk. “Stop being so down on yourself, it makes you more susceptible to a nargle infestation.”</span>

<p> </p>
<p>Tina sits on the edge of the bed in her tiny New York apartment. In her hands, she holds the envelope containing her assignment. In theory, it sounds straightforward. She’s supposed to go back and observe a critical historical event and record finer details that lead up to it. Ever since Tina was little, she liked listening to her grandparents’ stories about how different the world was. When she was old enough to go to Ilvermorny, Tina just about locked herself in the library to learn all that she could about history. It wasn’t uncommon for her to stay up all night entranced by the pages of passed down records. History of Magic was the class that defined her. After graduation, she took over the course and had become Ilvermorny’s youngest professor.</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re a part of history now,” Esther, her mother, had told her when she got the letter inviting her to teach.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tina sighs and breaks the seal of her letter, letting her reminiscing fade away. Her parents died the year prior and it still hurt Tina to think about it. She pulls out a crisp white card, flipping it over, she recognizes Dominique Graves’s elegant scrawl. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>December 16th - 17th, 1926, New York City, New York. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The identification of the obscurus and the first capture of Gellert Grindelwald.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Personally, Tina was hoping to get an assignment pertaining to Voldemort, but she has studied Grindelwald in depth and is genuinely curious about how charismatic he truly was. Pleased with this assignment, she picks up her wand and lights the card on fire as Graves had instructed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just to make sure she’s aware of what she’s getting herself into, she grabs her phone off its charger and goes to Google, fully prepared to spend the night refreshing her knowledge of the details.</span>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you related to Newt Scamander?” Tina asks, jogging up to Lysander an hour before they’re supposed to get sent back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lysander finishes his sip of coffee and nods. “He’s my great-grandfather, on my father’s side.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I think we’re related,” Tina says. “My great-grandmother’s sister is your great-grandmother. I was reading about my assignment and my great-grandmother’s name came up along with your great-grandfather’s so I did research and realized that the family trees connect.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, so we share great-great-grandparents?” Lysander asks, a smile spreading across his face. “That’s fucking awesome.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tina nods and sits next to him. “What’s your assignment?” She asks him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“June 23, 1927,” Lysander says, “Grindelwald’s escape from MACUSA.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m six months before you,” Tina rubs her eyes a bit, exhausted from staying up almost all night. “I got Grindelwald’s capture in the subway system.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You were supposed to be well rested,” Lysander hands her his half-drunk coffee. “Come on, get caffeinated so I don’t lose you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m a professor,” she takes a long drink before continuing, “I can stay up all night grading essays and then bounce back after three hours of sleep.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re in your twenties, that’ll change.”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>“Identify your given name.” Graves instructs as unspeakables put a wristwatch on Tina’s arm. Tina wonders briefly why she can’t put the watch on herself, but she decides not to comment.</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tina Esther Kowalski.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’ve decided to give you an alias,” Graves says, passing an ID card to an unspeakable, who then, in turn, hands it to Tina.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Flipping it open, Tina reads the name with a frown. “Porpentina Esther Goldstein?” She looks up at Graves. “That can’t be a possible name ma’am, I’ve researched this and someone with that name was already involved with this. She was my great-grandmother’s sister. Ask Lysander, he’s a direct descendant.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Kowalski,” Graves says apologetically, showing genuine concern for the first time that Tina’s seen. “There’s evidence that Porpentina Goldstein never existed before 1926.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tina realizes what is happening. Tears well in her eyes. “You’re going to send me to the past and abandon me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The MACUSA unspeakables received a sealed envelope in the year 1927, with express instructions not to open it until a month ago. It was written by you, telling of how your watch gets destroyed. Scamander, as in Lysander, tried to bring you back with him when you naturally caught up to his send back date, but something went wrong. You then decide to make the most of being suck in the past and live out your life starting anew from that point,” Graves explains.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tina drops down onto her knees, tears streaming down her cheeks. “That’s not possible,” she whispers. “I don’t want to do this assignment. I want to go back home and prepare lesson plans.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re already committed to this project, and we in this office will not be responsible for messing with time.” Graves makes a motion with her hand to each other the unspeakables.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Two of them lift Tina up by her elbows, while the other grabs her wrist. A cry comes from deep inside Tina’s being, but she has no way to express it other than to cry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The unspeakable grabbing her wrist sets the date for December of 1926. Graves is using powerful nonverbal magic to keep Tina still in the unspeakables grasp. “Please,” she whispers, her voice having gone raw from emotion. “Don’t do this.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It don’t hurt,” Bernadette, an unspeakable who Tina recognizes tells her. The button on the side of the watch is pressed, and all the unspeakables let go of her as to not get pulled back as well.</span>
