    <p>Chapter 1:</p>
<p>"Mama, Mama, he's here, he's here."<br/>
"Who is, Darling?" Sitting in her parlour, amongst all the richness money could buy and connections could procure, Pansy couldn't scold her son's exuberant entrance. She loved her baby too much, her only son. </p>
<p>"The man who saved me from the street ruffians. He was so heroic, he defended me alone against three."</p>
<p>Pansy was more than pleased. Besides deserving her gratitude for assisting her child in a life-threatening situation, she was quite keen to meet a real, fine gentleman. Her husband's companions and acquaintances left much to be desired in terms of chivalry. They all carried titles; still, the difference remained¬ between good breeding and new nobility. Although, Pansy couldn't complain, really, as she benefitted much from her status as Countess. </p>
<p>"Well, then we have to greet him properly, don't we, Darling?" She stroked her son's red hair and his heated cheeks with both hands. What would she do without her little darling boy?</p>
<p>The servant entered. "Madam, I present you the Duke of Exeter"</p>
<p>What, a Duke, thought the Countress of Devon delighted. She tried to get up for a courtsy, observing etiquette, before her tea cup slipped from her hands and shattered violently on the marble floor when a tall, well-dressed gentleman entered the parlour behind her servant. In anyone else Pansy would have thought he needed a decent meal, but, despite his slimness, this gentleman exuded resentfulness and rancour, and Pansy immediately dismissed any thought of ever hosting him. </p>
<p>When the man raised his head from the formal greeting and struck her with eyes grey as the London fog, she knew why.</p>
<p>"Draco!" Pansy's voice trembled with the suppressed shock of seeing him, and she raised herself on shaky knees with concerted effort.</p>
<p>"Pansy." Draco appeared calm and composed, but the long suffering had left a deep fury, which he barely restrained.</p>
<p>Pansy stayed where she stood but couldn't help reaching out a hand to her former fiancé. "Oh my god, Draco, how have you been? Where have you been?"</p>
<p>Draco's face darkened. "You have to ask me where? You know quite well where I was these past 10 years."</p>
<p>Her hand sank back like a sack of sand. "I know, but ... how ... what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>He sneered. "Is it so unthinkable that I want to see what became of the woman I was supposed to, no, about to marry when I was arrested? It's not as though you sent me any letters, to tell me of your lot, of your heartbreak and your trials to prove my innocence and free me."</p>
<p>Only when she whimpered, did Draco realize that they were not alone in the room. "And of your good fortune in having a child. Is he mine?"</p>
<p>That roused Pansy from her shock. "Draco!" she admonished in a hiss. Then she turned to her child. "William, darling, will you leave us? This gentleman and I have urgent matters to discuss. I will call you when it's time for you to come back."</p>
<p>Despite her soft tone, there was no mistaking the order she gave. The boy snuck from the room, eyes wide, and closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>With the closing of the door, all her noble pretenses fell away. If Draco hadn't seen this side of Pansy before, he might have been a little intimidated. "You know quite well that you were arrested before our wedding night. Of course, he's not yours. Can you imagine a Malfoy with red hair? Do you know anybody in my family with red hair? Of course not. You know who his father is. My husband, the Count of Devon, Ronald Weasley."</p>
<p>As it was, he wasn't even mildly impressed.  "Right, Pansy. From my bed into the next. How long did it take you, two months? And not a word of regret. Shame on you."</p>
<p>He still wasn't touched, even when tears flooded her eyes. "You know I didn't have much choice. What would have happened to me if I hadn't found another husband, and quickly? In those days, with the Dark Lord in power, a single woman was without protection."</p>
<p>Draco sneered, doubtful of Pansy's intentions. "And there was no honest man who could have taken you for a wife? You had to take the next best?"</p>
<p>Pansy was shocked, even though she expected his resentment. "How can you say such a thing? What would be wrong with Ronald? He courted me properly, supported me after your arrest, and his family is as old as yours."</p>
<p>Draco's scorn was a thing to behold. "Do you really have to ask? Do you really not know? I don't believe you."</p>
<p>"Know? Know what?" Pansy's confusion was real.</p>
<p>So was Draco's fury. "That your husband is behind my imprisonment. That your husband finally managed to get me locked up, so he could marry you."</p>
<p>He had bent forward, taken in by his own angry emotions, and he realized it when Pansy retreated from him, wordlessly grasping on to the back of her chair for support.<br/>
"I... what? I don't believe you. Ron wouldn't ..."</p>
<p>Draco straightened up. "Oh, he would, and he did. But his time to reap rewards for wrong-doing is over. So, unfortunately, is yours. The purpose of my visit today is to tell you that I own your house here, and I want Ronald Weasley and his traitor-riffraff gone by the end of the week."</p>
<p>If it was possible, Pansy blanched even more. "Own my house? What do you mean? Why? How can that be?"</p>
<p>Draco snorted. "Quite simple. I bought up all of his debts, which were quite a few, as he's more than willing to borrow money on his good name alone, and with this I own everything you do. And seeing as he is responsible for me ending up in Azkaban, I have no compunction whatsoever to put him out in the street. Where he will be picked up by law enforcement, for certain, because I believe he offended quite a few people in not returning their moneys."</p>
<p>"Listen, Draco, Ron will be back soon, and then we can sort this all out. Surely, he cannot be responsible for your arrest, and on the day I was getting married to you. He loves me, he really does," Pansy pleaded.</p>
<p>"He covets you, and for that, he went to all lengths," Draco spat. "Including the arrest of an innocent man."</p>
<p>In their heated discourse, they only noticed said man entering when he rounded Draco and came to stand next to Pansy, putting his arm around her shoulders. Immediately, she cuddled to his side. "Ron, thank God, you're home. What is this, Draco is saying, we are in debt and don't own our house anymore? Surely, he is mistaken."</p>
<p>In the ten years passing, Ron Weasley had begun to look more and more like his father, with a paunchy face, a gut from too many drinks, and a still red but receding hairline. He had a pasty complexion, and Draco figured Ronald Weasley wouldn't have stood a chance in a fight, unfit as he was from the abundance of wealth. All he had to offer his family in ways of protection were his good name and his noble title, undeserved as it was. Draco silently hoped that the bad conscience over misbegotten deeds may have wormed its way through what a feisty, ambitious young man Weasley had been. </p>
<p>"Malfoy. To what do I owe this displeasure?" Even his voice sounded pasty, Draco realized.</p>
<p>"He goes by Duke of Exeter," Pansy inserted urgently.</p>
<p>The recognition of the name, mixed with some fear visible in the other man's face gave Draco some satisfaction. </p>
<p>"I do, indeed. With the ownership of a certain island in the Mediterranean comes this title, bestowed by Harry James Potter."</p>
<p>Ron's face was as white as his wife's. "Harry would never ...," he blustered.</p>
<p>"Oh, but he did," Draco interrupted. "For services rendered to help defeat the Dark Lord. Potter was quite grateful that I could assist him in that, his final purpose. Something you should have done, I figure, or Granger, but you were too cowardly to be there for him. So, I did it."</p>
<p>The name Granger brought another wave of recognition mixed with fear and irritation ontoWeasley's face. Draco smiled grimly. "Alas, you do know what happened to Granger. So, let's say, she wasn't quite able to do her part."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Ron was rendered speechless; Draco felt his job was done. "I leave it to you to explain to your loving wife just how very many debts you accumulated and what happens if someone were to buy them up. I want you gone by the end of the week, Weasley. This is my house now."</p>
<p>That moved Ron to a last stance. "But, what will happen to my family? You just saved my son from an attack. You cannot be quite as heartless as to put us out in the street?"</p>
<p>Draco sneered. "As heartless as you, you mean, having an innocent man arrested on his wedding day to the woman he loved? Saving your son was common chivalry, something you are obviously completely lacking. Your staff will find other employment, I'm sure. The rest of your family is none of my concern."</p>
<p>"But my son, my son." Pansy was beside herself when her impending fate sank in.</p>
<p>Coldly, Draco replied. "Nothing will happen to your son. He will still have both his parents and be able to live, I'll make sure of that. Unlike me, that is, who lost practically everything, including, very nearly, my dignity. I do not avenge myself on innocent children, so he will live. Well enough, that is. I will put you two up in another house, until he comes of age."</p>
<p>Focusing his full fury on the man responsible for his fate and the woman he’d dragged along, Draco spat, "But you and your ’husband’ will feel the pain of it for the rest of your lives."</p>
<p>With that, he turned and left without another word. He never looked back.</p>
