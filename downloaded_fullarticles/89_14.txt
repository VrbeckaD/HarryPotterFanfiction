    <p>Molly Weasely was well aware how many people saw her family. They were the outcasts. “Blood traitors” to some of the more traditional type, flat out poor to just about anyone, and breeding faster than rabbits to those who took to gossip. And, quite frankly, she had been hearing it for <em>years</em>. Yes, sometimes it stung to know how others felt about her, but some people still stood by her, and she was thankful for them. There were, however, more important things than social standing currently.</p><p>The war currently going, for example.</p><p>The Death Eaters were everywhere, and the gossip even more prevalent. She wouldn’t have heard a word of it, of course, being home caring for her children not yet in Hogwarts, however having a few friends still fighting helped. Alice Longbottom came over as often as she could to tell her the news, and Aurthur kept her up to date on anything Alice couldn’t. It was still stifling to be cooped up so much, but the children needed her.</p><p>Her being pregnant, of course, made a difference in how much she got out.</p><p>When her and Arthur had found out, the joy of another child was replaced with fear. It was dangerous to have a child in the middle of a war, more so now with the rumors of Death Eaters targeting families with young children, and they already had so many. The murders of the Bones family recently only cemented this, though little Susan surviving was cause for some joy.<br/>
However, the imminent arrival of her daughter was still something she looked forward to. Having had all sons in the past made her ready for a little girl to call her own.</p><p>She did not let the imminent arrival of her daughter or the war stop her from caring for her family. Of course, if it meant shopping for groceries in the muggle town by the Burrow instead of Diagon Alley, so be it.</p><p>She walked through the aisles in the small grocers, making sure to keep Fred and George within eyesight. They were barely three yet, but still a handful. Ron had been left at home with a sitter, being young enough that she didn’t want to let him brave the cold.</p><p>“George...no, Fred!” she scolded, stopping her son in the act of trying to tip over a display. “Whichever one you are, don’t even think about it.”</p><p>The boy in question pouted, but came back to his mother anyways, the other one making an appearance on her other side. Molly was going to miss them listening this quickly later on, she just knew it.</p><p>She finally finished grabbing the last of her things, and double checked that she had both the boys before making her way back up to the front to pay.</p><p>“Mum, what's that ringing noise?” asked the twin to her right.</p><p>“It’s just the bell on the door, dear. Someone came into the…” she paused in her explanation as they came around the corner, seeing her neighbor Pandora Lovegood at the door, pale and frantic. She usually looked quite...odd on a regular day, but while her dress was usually made of colorful fabrics patched together, and for some reason insisted on wearing vegetables as jewelry, she was not usually one to wear disheveled or dirty clothing. Or to go barefoot, for that matter. Her long hair was windswept and it was obvious she had probably run here from her home not far from the Burrow.</p><p>“Pandora, dear, what are you doing here? Are you ok?” the woman turned to face her, and visibly relaxed, but seemed to still be upset.</p><p>“Death Eaters. At the Burrow. Arthur and Xenophillius are there, but we weren’t sure where you had gone and…”</p><p>Molly immediately pointed her wand at the woman at the door. There weren’t any Muggles around, but she had to act fast.</p><p>“What did I want to name Bill when he was born?”</p><p>“Franklin. But Arthur hated it. Thought it was to fancy. My patronus?”</p><p>“I...it’s a rabbit…” The basket fell from Mollys hands. It was her, so that meant it was true...Pandora rushed forwards to catch the basket, and placed a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>“More help is coming, Amos Diggory went to fetch them. He left Cedric with me, him and Luna are in our cellar with Amos’s wife.”</p><p>Molly steadied herself. Death Eaters. <em>Here</em>. She had to go help, and Ron, he was still in the house!</p><p>“Where is Ron? Did Arthur get him out?.”</p><p>“I’m not sure, but he’ll be fine, the nymphs around your house <em>adore</em> him, they won’t let anyone hurt him. I’ll take the twins, you go help.”</p><p>Molly nodded. She turned to the twins, who were for once, giving their full attention to an adult. She noted that they both looked downright terrified, and one was close to tears.</p><p>“Boys, go with Pandora. I will see you soon, ok? It’s going to be alright, mummy will see you in a bit, then we can play in the garden some, how does that sound?”</p><p>Both boys nodded, simultaneously, and went to Pandora. She took their hands, and with an audible ‘pop’ disappeared. Molly placed the basket on the counter.</p><p>There were more important things to worry about.</p>
