    <p>Belladonna heaved the long-suffering sigh of the eternally put-upon, wondering why in the world the current dark lord couldn’t just retire and GO HOME! She just wanted to rule the world, and he just had to go and make the stupid and make her job of killing him even harder. Honestly, who did that? Seven Horcruxes, seriously voldyface? Seriously? And they were scattered everywhere too... Cruel, cruel man. </p><p>It was almost like he didn’t want to be killed so she could take over the world, honestly. Wait. Maybe that was it, but he was currently too insane to do anything at all. She wished she hadnt destroyed the human Horcrux, and she wished Harry-I-Will-Mess-With-Your-Plans-Potter hadn’t destroyed the diary. </p><p>A shame she hadn’t been here to stop it. Oh well. She couldn’t fix everything, but who wants an enemy with 0.78125% of a soul?</p><p>Perhaps, just perhaps, she thought, glancing at Dumbledore’s wand, there was a way. There was always a way. She could get the lumps of his soul back from Death and force it into his body. I mean, how hard was it to become the master of death? With no remaining relatives, the cloak had gone to Harry’s murderer. If she killed Dumbledore, his wand would be her’s. But, how to get the resurrection stone? Another bridge to burn another day. For now, Dumbledore’s wand. For now.</p>
