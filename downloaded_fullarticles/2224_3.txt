    <p> It's comforting to know that when the world goes to shit and you are left screaming into a godless void, cake frosting will never let you down. Besides giving you the occasional stomach cramp from eating three and a half containers of "Happy Jon's Birthday Cake Icing" it's generally a great way to deal with the unresolved trauma from your past. Unfortunately, there are some repercussions of your dorm mates finding you in the kitchens at two in the morning with a spoon in one hand, and chocolate smeared over your face. 
</p>
<p> "I'm dropping out of school."
</p>
<p> "The hell you are, don't leave me with these useless fucks, Sev." Lucius crossed his arms and looked at the sorry sight of the Slytherin.
</p>
<p> Severus arched his back, listening with satisfaction as tiny pops rippled down his spine. "I really am this time. I'm seeng the Headmaster in the morning and transfering to Canada where I will continue my studies there. Frosting, Lucius?" Severus held out the grossly brightly coloured container with a cartoon clown printed on the front and gave it a tempting shake.
</p>
<p> "Er, no thanks," the blode shook his head and situated himself beside Severus, wincing at the coldness of the stone floor. "What do you plan on telling Lily?" he reached out as if to wipe the sticky sugar from Sev's face, but dropping his hand as if thinking better of it; opting to hand him a handkercheif from his pocket instead. "Perhaps a case of Ataxia? Or Sanguinare Vampiris?"
</p>
<p> "First off," Severus smacked the spoon on his friends thigh grinning at the yelp of indignation Lucius gave. "Those aren't even a real disease and you know it. And two, i'm not telling her."
</p>
<p> "Real solid mate," Lucius rubbed his eyes tiredly, his long hair coming loose from his messy bun, framing his pale face with pretty strands of silver. "She won't ever forgive you for that you know. Plus, you're all talk, Sevy. I bet you won't even do it." The corners of his mouth twitched as if he was trying to hold back a smirk. 
</p>
<p> "I'm choosing to ignore that you are baiting me. And I will do it," he absentmindedly dipped his fingers in a blob of icing that fell on the ground and licked it off. Lucius' face screwed up in disgust. "You just watch me Lucius Malfoy. This time tomorrow I'll be in Canada, eating poutine with bacon and enjoying maple syrup flavoured candy. I may even send you some if i'm in a good mood."
</p>
<p> "Annnnd..." he clicked his tongue. "Do you plan on telling Mr. Lupin about this little transfer?"
</p>
<p> Severus froze. Lucius knew his words hit their directed mark when Sev groaned and smacked his head against the wall with a concerning thwack. He felt a tiny bit bad for bringing that up, but decided he'd rather his friend be angry with him for a short while than loose him completely across the sea. After what seemed to be an actual growl, he gritted his teeth and spat "No," he seethed. "Merlin's bloody balls, no. I do NOT plan on telling him, you bastard." He glared at the pureblood with as much strength as he could muster.
</p>
<p>Severus' eyes were tired, and almost always had a purple bruising underneath. But on closer expection they were very pretty, like onyx, always sucking people's gaze further into the void; and Lucius wondered if he looked long enough he might catch a glimpse of stars. But before he could confirm his suspiscions Sev would always look away before he could get a good look. 
</p>
<p> Lucius gave a half hearted smile and let Severus' insults roll off him. Something anyone would have to learn how to do before they got close to the snappy teen. "I see," was all he said, and he grabbed the icing container from his hand and began to look at the nutritional value chart. Something Sev had to teach him how to read. "Good God, Sevy. How much did you eat?"
</p>
<p> "Too many."
</p>
<p> "You've used up your calorie intake for like...forever." Lucius shook his head. "Before you graduate i'm going to have to roll you everywhere you want to go. Which, honestly, wouldn't be very far. Seeing as you never <em>go<em> anywhere. Ever."
</em></em></p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
</em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em> "That's not true," Sev scoffed. "I go places all the time."

    <em>

  </em>
</p>

    <em> Lucius arched a perfect, sculpted eyebrow. "Oh really? Class, the privy, and your dorm room doesn't count."

  <em>
    <em>

    <em> "I'm diagnosing you with the 'lack of will to live.' And...dare I say stress eating?" he gestured to the abandoned frosting.

<p>
  <em>
    <em>
</em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em> "You don't know me!" Sev snapped. "It's perfectly rational to eat sweet things when you've had a less than perfect day."

</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>

      <em> The wolf let out a mournful howl as the transformation was completed, still reeling in pain as his nails broke the skin off his finger tips and curled into large black claws. He laid on the ground of the s shack for a little while, panting so hard his tongue rolled out of his mouth.  He was vaugely aware of a large stag snuffling outside of the shack, and the impatient barking that joined him soon after. Letting out a low whine, the wolf shakily stood, shaking out his mane of fur and glancing around his surroundings. He wasn't sure who he was before the agony started, but for now that didn't worry him. All he knew he needed right now was to <em>hunt.<em> He crawled outside on all fours, letting out a surprised little yip as the black dock playfully bit at his tail. The three of them barreled to the woods, followed by a skittish rat bounding after them squeaking nervously. They rolled in the grass, kicking up dirt in their wake, playing untill the small ours of the morning. His thoughts full of a familiar face always pinched in annoyance and a mop of raven hair.

      <em> Severus' lungs were burning. His breath came in gasps and his feet punded on the murky paths of the forbidden woods. Merlin! He was sweating in places he didn't even <em>know<em> he could sweat. And of course, Lucius was looking as annoyingly perfect as ever.

      <em> Severus was extremely greatful of the showers that morning. Since he was up before most of the students, he was able to take the time to thoroughly scrub at his face and wash his hair. He was always self conscious about the scars on his back and wrists so he was very picky about undressing infront of his fellow Slytherins. He stepped out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around him, steem fogging up the windows in his room.

<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em> He got dressed quickly, putting on his least ratty shoes and was out the door in a matter of fifteen minutes. Severus knew he had the grades to be able to seek any transfer he wanted, yet something held him back. He wasn't entirely sure he wanted to leave Hogwarts after all. A small nagging voice told him he would probably be happier if he left, but he couldn't help thinking of his friends...Lily would be crushed, Lucius would pretend not to care but be heartbroken, and Remus....
</em>
    </em>

      <em>
</em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em> Remus wouldn't care. Tears stung his eyes as we walked to the Headmasters office, and he willed them away. Remus wouldn't mind if Severus left because...because...he never...never truly...

    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
</em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em> He shook his head. No. There would be none of that right now. What mattered was Severus' future. He wouldn't have a good one if he stayed here, he just <em>knew<em> it. Just because they were having sex for awhile there doesn't mean anything. So, he took in a deep breath and knocked on the Headmasters door.</em></em></em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p> "Ah, Severus! There you are I was wondering if you would actually show up." Dumbledor smiled as he ushered the boy inside.
</p>
<p> "Well, I'm here aren't I?"
</p>
<p> "Yes, yes, now do have a seat, my boy. I see you're looking to transfer into Penderghast, correct? Remind me, that's the small wizarding school in Canada, correct? Near British Columbia?"
</p>
<p> Severus nodded. "Yes sir, it is."
</p>
<p> "Now, have you considered Ilvermorney? That's a much larger school with a tad bit more credibility..."
</p>
<p>"Er, yes Headmaster. But I'm wanting something more...seclusive." Severus fished for the right word to say.
</p>
<p> Dumbledore handed him the papers and watched closely as Severus leafed through them. "I've spoken with the Headmaster there....Lavita Ebonywood, I believe is her name. You understand that the fall term is not yet over,"
</p>
<p> Severus looked up. "Yes sir, I understand."
</p>
<p> "So, you realize you wouldn't actually make the switch until after the Christmas break?"
</p>
<p> Severus nodded and reached for the quill to sign his name, but Headmaster Dumbledore stopped him. "Are you sure about this Mr. Snape? I understand things were...tense...this year but you shouldn't let that stand in the way."
</p>
<p> Severus bristled and his skin became hot. He almost lost it, but remembered to reel himself in before things got...messy. He had to show Dumbledore he would not be pushed over. Especially after the incident. "I'm positive." he said icily. 
</p>
<p> "Well, I hate to see a student go...just...wait until Yule, Severus. Give yourself some time before making irrational decisions. Promise me." 
</p>
<p> He hesitated. It...wasn't a bad idea, he had to admit. It would give him some time to talk it over with Lily and maybe Narcissa a bit more. After a few moments of deliberation, he gave a quick nod and shoved the papers in his satchel. Lucius was waiting for him outside with a genuinely curious expression on his face.
</p>
<p> "Well?" he prompted gently.
</p>
<p>"Dumbledore asked me to think about it for a bit longer. But I have the papers...so I can sign them whenever I want."
</p>
<p> Lucius mask never once slipped, but he would never admit to Severus that his hands were trembling in his pockets. "Why don't we go out today, Sevy? I hear Hagrid had a liter of Niflers that were just born a few weeks back." 
</p>
<p>
______________________________________________________________________________________________
</p>
<p> Remus sighed as he rested his chin on his hands, staring out the window as the sun peaked over the horizon, washing everything in a brilliant gold. The transformation last night had left him very weak, so he was happy it was Saturday. He shivered against an oncoming chill and drew the quilted blanket over his shoulders. He watched as Severus bounded across the courtyard with Malfoy in tow, sending dozens of grazing birds flocking in every direction. 
</p>
<p> "Morning, Mooney." James yawned, sitting nest to Remus on the window bench. His hair was sticking out everywhere, and somehow through the night he had lost one of his socks.
</p>
<p> "Good morning, James." He said quietly, as to not disturb the sleeping Peter and Sirius. 
</p>
<p> After a few moments of comfortable silence, James tentatively asked. "...You and Sirius still not talking?"
</p>
<p> "No," Remus said, decidedly cool. "And we won't be for quite some time."
</p>
<p> "I know you're upset..."
</p>
<p> "That word doesn't even begin to cover it, James. I almost killed someone a few months ago. And all because You and Sirius have this childish hate against a boy who did nothing to earn it. And in doing so, nearly outed my secret to the entire school. At the very least my wand would have gotten snapped James, I could have been killed."
</p>
<p> "Dumbledore wouldn't have let that happen." He argued, and Remus almost rolled his eyes. James wasn't entirely evil, he knew that. Just sometimes he takes things waaaay to far. Sirius had a hand in it to, he didn't know when to stop and can be cruel at times. Unknowingly encouraging James to do something he would never do. Like lead Severus to a fully transformed Werewolf, for instance. If James hadn't have realized his dumbass actions...Remus didn't know what he would do. He lost someone he loved because of the two of them, and now Severus want's nothing to do with him.</p>
<p> "Anyways, it was just Snivellous."
</p>
<p> Remus had to turn away so James wouldn't see the fury that was written all over his face. He bit his tongue and said nothing. He wanted to talk to Sev about what happened, but Lucius wouldn't let him anywhere near him. A spark of jealousy flared in his chest, but he quickly swallowed it. He would have to catch Sev when he was alone.</p>
