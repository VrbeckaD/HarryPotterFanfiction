  <em>January 2, 1938</em>
</p>
<p></p><div>
  <p>Mrs Jones was a very strict person. She woke up at the same time every day, always wore her hair twisted into a tight bun and never wore ruffled clothes. Her house was always clean and her children <em>disciplined. </em>She had run the orphanage with an iron fist for thirty years now. And she didn't look like she was going away soon.</p>
  <p>So, when Harry saw her he stood up quickly, discarding his chore for now. She was standing at the doorstep of the orphanage, pine cane in her left hand. She looked angry for some reason Harry didn't understand. "Come here this instant, boy!" </p>
  <p>She looked more furious by the second. Harry scrambled to get to her side. "Did you need me for something, Mrs Jones?"</p>
  <p>Harry saw the look in her eyes and decided that; whatever it was, he would not like it.</p>
  <p>She looked at his appearance. Her lips pursed in a disapproving manner. "Did you roll in the mud?" Her every word as sharp as a knife.</p>
  <p>"I was just plucking some weed, as you told me to," Harry said, as politely as he can. She scowled, glancing at the lawn. "And not doing a good job about it, apparently."</p>
  <p>"Anyway," she continued. "You need to go up to your room. A gentleman is asking for you, <em>god knows why</em>, so be quick." She turned around to go inside, her cane clicking on the floor with every step. Harry was stepping through the door when he saw her hesitate. She turned to face him again. Her gaze unsettled Harry. But her smile was so much worse. It looked like two strings were tugging on her lips to stretch them as far as they went. It did not belong to her face. "And, Harry?"</p>
  <p>Harry tried to swallow the lump in his throat. "Yes, ma'am?"</p>
  <p>Her smile turned... something for a second. Harry took an involuntary step back. "Be on your <em>best</em> behaviour dear." </p>
  <p>The 'or' wasn't said. </p>
  <p>Harry nodded curtly. She tilted her head once and turned around swiftly, cane knocking on the floor as she moved away. Harry slumped with relief. He went inside, turned to the left and started climbing up the stairs. The wood creaked with his every step. He fastened his pace, hoping to make less voice. </p>
  <p>Their room was on the highest floor. With it being the only room there it was usually quiet and peaceful. It made hearing little things easier. Like little footsteps, five or six kids climbing up the stairs at night, when Mrs Jones wouldn't say anything when she saw a few bruises in the morning. Or one person coming up, a cane clicking alongside, its wood covered with a few drops of blood. Or two kids whispering, comforting, trying to heal bruises they are not strong enough to defend against.</p>
  <p>So when Harry finally made his way to the top floor, he knew something was wrong. He took a few steps forward, trying to understand what he was hearing. The smell of smoke got to him first. Then he heard the crackling of burning wood. </p>
  <p>He took a sharp breath, hands starting to shake. <em>Was the room burning? What should he do?</em> He couldn't call Mrs Jones, she would end up blaming him. All the other workers were out because of the holidays. The other kids couldn't or wouldn't help. Maybe he could use his... thing. <em>No</em>, Harry shook his head. He couldn't control it enough.</p>
  <p>He stood there, trying to decide what to do. Then he remembered. <em>Tom is in there.</em></p>
  <p>Harry acted instantly, his frozen limbs unlocking and moving. Even the thought of his friend hurting was enough. He reached for the door, turning the handle and pushing it open. Expecting anything.</p>
  <p>You can say it surprised him when all he faced was a burning closet with two people quietly watching it. “What’s going on?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tom noticed him first, getting up and pulling him further into the room. They sat together on his bed. Harry looked at his friend: His shoulders were tight and pulled together, he was slightly slouched and his left hand was twitching. Putting a comforting hand on his back Harry turned to the man sitting across from them. The fire was out by now. Probably distinguished by the man. How Harry didn't care right now. “Why was the closet burning, <em>Sir</em>?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The man turned his gaze from a silent Tom to Harry, his eyes twinkling. Harry felt his mind growing numb. His rage and concern distinguishing like the fire. <em>What... was he angry about before?</em> He couldn't remember. Harry shrugged internally. It probably wasn't important if he forgot it. The tension left his shoulders, his posture visibly relaxing. The man smiled. “We must introduce ourselves before such questions don't you think, my boy?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry nodded slowly. <em>Yes, that was for the best. </em>He smiled back. “I’m Harry, sir. Harry Snow.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“And I am Albus Dumbledore. Professor Dumbledore for you if your friend is right.” The man, Professor Dumbledore apparently, said. Harry didn't understand the meaning of it. “If my friend is… right?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The man looked at him with joy. “Yes Harry, you see, I'm not from a normal school.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“<a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/bc/1c/53/bc1c53cfef58758ecb8f70fb2d68d8ff.jpg" rel="nofollow">This</a>,” he said lifting his hand “is what we do.” Then a little flame appeared on his hand. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was… <em>blue</em>. It was a bright, dark blue and, Harry couldn't take his eyes off of it. The flames licked the man’s palm but didn't appear to hurt or damage. He could feel the heat coming from it. <em>It looks like fabric</em>, He thought,<em> like fabric in the ocean</em>. Moving with no restraint, curling and snapping and reaching. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“What is that, sir?” Harry breathed. He was still gazing at the fire, dazed. Dumbledore smiled, flicking his wrist and extinguishing the flame. With the fire gone Harry looked up at him. Waiting for an answer. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“It's magic, my boy,” he said. Looking at the two boys in front of him, he smiled a warm smile. The slight edge to it passing unnoticed. </p>
  <p>"And you both have it."</p>
