</p>
<hr/><p>Dark. It was dark in the room. The sort of darkness that oppressed everything and sent the senses alight with a strong feel of foreboding. The room in itself was quite nice, a rich furnished little study. A side of the study was decorated by dark wooden bookshelves, homes of lines and lines of ancient tomes with dark, leathered covers. Different languages could be discerned reading the titles of the covers: English, Latin, ancient Greek, and a strange sort of squiggly language. On the corner a warm fire, the only source of light in the chamber, crackled inside an ornate stone hearth, projecting a curious canvas of lights and shadows around the study. In front of the hearth were placed two plush armchairs in deep green and between them laid a soft black rug.</p><p>An eerie silence reigned inside the room, interrupted only by the crackling of the fire and the scratching of quill against parchment. Sat in a comfortable dark high back chair with green upholstery, in front a cherry wood desk, was a young teen. A tall, handsome adolescent partially covered in shadow. He had pale skin and aristocratic features. On his head, short, chestnut coloured hair perfectly styled. His eyes were the same mesmerizing blue of the deep ocean and on one of his long, elegant fingers he wore a gold ring with a black stone. On the desk, before the page in which was writing, laid a well-kept diary with a dark leathered cover. And beside it, a book, open. Every once in a while, the teen lifted his head from the parchment in which was writing and looked at the book, writing something down. The page was filled with strange symbol and drawings, used, it appeared, to represent some sort of ritual.</p><p>After a while, he stopped writing and lifted the page to observe his work. His features stretched in a grin and his eyes flashed red.</p><p align="justify">“Perfect!”</p>
