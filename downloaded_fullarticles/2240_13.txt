    <p>Alright, so here's my story and stuff. I hope you like it. I brought these people back to life.</p>
<p>-Sirius<br/>-Fred<br/>-Snape</p>
<p>Romione hasn't happened. (Sorry Ron and Hermione shippers.)<br/>Hinny has happened but won't last in this story.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione will be suspicious, and they are gonna be kinda jerk-like. Mostly Harry, but Ron and Hermione are too. </p>
<p>So I hate when people have the demigods reveal themselves so soon, so in this story, the demigods probably aren't even gonna tell the wizards about their parentage. They might tell a few like Ginny and Luna, but that's probably gonna be it. </p>
<p>And another thing. I absolutely hate it when the golden trio is being super annoying towards the demigods, but they don't do anything about it! In this story, the demigods aren't gonna just let the golden trio annoy them to death. Their gonna be snarky and sassy and tell the golden trio to back off.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
