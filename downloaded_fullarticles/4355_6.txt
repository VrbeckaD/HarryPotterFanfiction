          <div class="userstuff"><p>Chapter 1 - introduction</p><p>it was a pretty mundane day for the students at hogwarts. nothing out of the ordinary was going on, ron, hermione, and harry were all engaging in meaningless
conversation with the occasional eye flickering over to draco, and back again. harry wasnt eating much and ron seemed quite worried about it, while hermione
passed it off as "just an off day"<br/>
"Hermione, its the quidditch final tomorrow, he's got to eat" ron exclaimed
"let him do what he wants, i dont think missing a single meal will change a thing" replied hermione<br/>
Harry was busy staring at the slytherin table, where everyone was suspiciously hunched over the table, exchanging whispers and occasionally snickering, while
glaring at the hufflepuff table. Draco appeared uninterested, but the rest of the table either didnt notice or didnt care. hermione soon took notice of what
harry was ogling and nudged ron as if to say "i bet those slytherins are up to something"<br/>
ron gasped and said "i bet those slytherins are up to something"<br/>
hermione rolled her eyes and pointed at draco<br/>
"what is he doing?' she whispered<br/>
"i dont know, but i suspect he's planning something." ron replied<br/>
"i sure hope not; hes the most destructive of them all"<br/>
Harry was ignoring all the chatter, but maintained a fixed stare at the group. Ron and Hermione shrugged off what he was doing, as he was known to stay quiet for
days on end, then come up with brilliant ideas<br/>
"lets hope this ones a good one" ron hinted<br/>
soon all the students were clearing out, so ron, hermione, and harry followed suit. as the trio were about to enter gryffindor tower, harry broke out of his thinking
to tell his friends<br/>
"you go on ahead, i'll just hang around"<br/>
Hermione and ron exchanged confused looks, but continued walking onwards, up the unsteady staircases.
after a few minutes, harry stepped inside a closet, to be greeted by draco.<br/>
"i thought you'd never come" draco whispered.<br/>
instead of replying, harry handed draco a flask, containing a foul smelling liquid. While draco was consuming the mysterious liquid, harry handed him some spare<br/>
gryffindor robes.<br/>
"better be quick" harry told him, before briefly leaving, softly closing the door behind him. he quietly stepped up the stairs, leading to the gryffindor common room.<br/>
a he whispered the password to the lady in the painting, he stepped into the gryffindor common room, where he was greeted by his friends.<br/>
***<br/>
Draco had almost instantly finished getting ready and left the closet. the mysterious liquid - polyjuice potion - had disguised him as one of the less popular
hufflepuff first-years. he peeped through one of the cracks in the door and left the closet. he climbed up the stairss, reciting in his head the plans harry had
aforementioned. when he reached the painting of the fat lady, he echoed the password that harry mentioned. the fat lady seemed skeptical of this unfamiliar face, but
let him inside anyways, where draco bolted for the sleeping quarters. very few people noticed, but thankfully, harry was one of them. sensing the signal, harry
gradually started acting sleepier and sleepier, until telling his friends he had to go to sleep. his friends just nodded while continuing playing a particularly
intense game of wizards chess. harry walked tiredly into his sleeping area until he saw the hufflepuff first-year sitting on the foot of his bed. draco asked, worried,
"are you completely sure you put up the silencing charms?"<br/>
"100% sure." harry replied. he looked at his watch. "we've got about 5 minutes until the potion wears off."<br/>
Harry started pulling all the curtains around him closed. two minutes before the due time, this random first-year had turned back into draco. harry started taking off
his shoes and signalled for draco to do so too. soon both the boys were both down to their pants, however, harry started to hear people entering the room. harry pulled
himself and draco under the covers, until the mob had quietened down. he pulled the sheets back down and slipped out of his pants, and draco followed suit. draco looked
into harry's big, green eyes and nodded. draco put both his hands around the base of harry's cock and started to suck, starting from the head, gradually taking more in
his mouth. harry moaned, but not loud enough. draco loved seeing harry like this but wanted harry really pleased, so se started going faster, still managing to take
more cock in his mouth. harry started moaning loudly. draco got even faster and faster, and harry grabbled a huge fistful of his hair and pulled him faster. harry was
sensing he was about to cum, so he opened his eyes and looked down at draco's head bobbing up and down on his dick. he came instantly and draco swallowed it all. draco
knew what to do next. he crawled further up on the bed and stood on all fours. harry smiled and moved closer to him. he grabbed home lube from his personal drawer and<br/>
smeared it all over draco's hole. harry slowly added one finger and draco winced, but really just wanted harry's dick inside him. harry pulled his finger in and out of
draco's ass, before slowly adding a second digit. draco groaned. harry started twisting his fingers around, while pulling in and out, before adding a third finger,
then doing what he did before. draco was begging so hard, harry thought he'd ought to quit teasing. he removed his fingers and slid in his cock. draco moaned. he
started going faster, and harder. draco was crying out in pleasure and harry was pleased to see draco so pleased. harry reached his hand around and started stroking
draco's dick, until draco quickly came into harry's hand. harry licked off all the cum from his hand and put it back on draco's waist. harry started speeding up even
more, and eventually came inside draco.</p></div>
