"I'm not in love with Potter. Did you tell him that I was, mother?"</p><p>Narcissa said, "I can see it in your eyes when you speak about him, Draco. You love him."</p><p>Draco sighed. "I can't love him though, can I; father?"</p><p>Lucius mumbled, "Look, I love you Draco and I just want what's best for you."</p><p>Draco sneered. "You don't love me, you love what I could be."</p><p>Narcissa shouted, "Stop arguing!"</p><p>Draco told his father, "I'm not going to marry Astoria Greengrass, okay? I'm going to marry Pot... someone I love and I don't care if you disapprove. I'm fed up of trying to please you because I don't think anything I do could ever please you, father."</p><p>Lucius replied, "That's where you're wrong, I'm pleased that you've finally stood up to me; son."</p><p>Draco gasped. "You are?"</p><p>Lucius smiled. "Of course I am. I've been acting like your master not your father for many years and I'm pleased that you finally realised that."</p><p>Draco inquired, "So, can I marry who I want?"</p><p>Lucius stated, "Baby steps, Draco."</p><p>Draco smirked. "It's a start."</p></div>
