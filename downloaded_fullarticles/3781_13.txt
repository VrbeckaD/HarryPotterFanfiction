<p> </p>
<p>Trapped in a room with a man who had just been liberally doused with a bastardized lust potion was not a situation in which Harry Potter had ever wanted to find himself. But he was. And he was going to kill Draco Malfoy once he escaped. If he escaped. Harry wasn't sure it was possible to be buggered to death, but judging by the look in Severus Snape's burning black eyes, the man was willing to give it a go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything had been going well up until ten minutes ago. Defense class had been good, even with Snape glaring at him through the entire period. Harry hadn't risen to his teacher's usual sarcastic taunts, he hadn't lost his temper or earned himself a detention, and when Snape had given the class back their tests from last week Harry was pleased to see he had earned himself an Outstanding. It had been the best Defense Against the Dark Arts class he'd attended all year. Until ten minutes ago. Malfoy's lifespan was shrinking by the minute.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The strap on Harry's book bag broke just as he was shouldering it and readying himself to vacate the room after Snape dismissed the class, so he hunkered down and set about fixing it as well as he could to get him through the day. He would do a proper job of it once he got back to his dorm after dinner. He thought he was alone with his Professor until he heard Malfoy speak; and in such a tone! He had never, in the five and a half years he'd been at school with the ferret, heard his rival speak to or about the Head of Slytherin with anything other than complete respect. Now was a far different story.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Dark Lord sends his regards, traitor!” the blonde snarled, spitting the word traitor with as much contempt as he could muster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Still crouched over his bag, Harry's eyes widened in shock. That couldn't be Malfoy. Malfoy worshiped Snape just like the rest of the snakes. Snape was the one teacher at Hogwarts Malfoy had never insulted. What the hell was going on?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Draco, what...” Snape began, only to be rudely cut off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Don't try the innocent act, Severus. He knows. We all know now. What on earth was Dumbledore thinking to allow such a weak pitiful thief like Mundungus Fletcher in his precious Order anyway?” the boy sneered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stood and spun around to watch the drama unfold at the front of the room. Snape's cover had been blown. That much was obvious. It sounded as though Fletcher had run afoul of the Death Eaters and spilled his guts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Draco,” Snape began again, trying to placate his student. “You do not understand.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It doesn't matter what I understand. The Dark Lord understands perfectly, and sent you a gift.” Draco withdrew a small glass sphere from his robes and launched it at his former mentor. It broke at the dark man's feet and he was quickly engulfed in an eddying swirl of pink fumes. “Something new. Something special just for you, Sir. Death's Desire.” Malfoy mocked. “You didn't really think you were our Lord's only Potions Master, did you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape squeezed his eyes shut as soon as the blonde had launched the potion filled ball. Actually, in his hubris, Severus had thought he was Voldemort's only Potions Master. He had never heard of Death's Desire, but its scent reminded him of the properties of Amortentia. As a seasoned Potions Master he was able to detect the true scent of the ingredients behind the illusory fragrances it suggested to the common wizard. Yes, it was faint, but all the elements were there, plus something extra. Something new, as Draco had so happily informed him. Something special just for him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Malfoy what have you done?” Harry shouted, finally breaking himself from the stupor he had found himself in from the unexpected situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both Slytherin's heads turned in his direction and almost against his will, Severus' eyes snapped open, locking onto the form of the shocked young Gryffindor at the back of the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Excellent!” the blonde laughed, smirking. “Two with one stone! My Lord will be pleased.” The young Slytherin's eyes capered with manic glee as he shot out the door, slamming it in his wake. A moment later Harry heard the crackle and hum of wards slamming into place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No...” Snape moaned, collapsing into his chair, never breaking his gaze from the lithe seeker across the room. Already the first stirrings of intense desire were beginning to creep into his body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sir,” Harry began making his way to his teacher's side, worry stamped clear on his brow. “Are you alright?” He reached the man and lay a tentative hand on his teacher's broad shoulder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Potter.” Severus hissed. Harry had heard the man speak his name in many tones over the years, each more filled with loathing than the last. This though... this was different. Harry couldn't define it, he only knew it sent a strange shiver down his spine. “It just had to be you, didn't it?” Snape murmured.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What? I didn't do anything, Sir. Malfoy...” Harry was stopped from speaking when Snape's hands shot out and tangled in the front of his robes, dragging him forward to stand between his teacher's knees. Harry yelped in surprise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Just had to bloody well be you.” Snape growled as he ripped open the Gryffindor's robes, sending buttons flying. Slim fingered hands snaked inside and settled possessively on the young man's waist before jerking the shirt from where it was neatly tucked into Harry's trousers. “It's always you. Always.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Professor! What are you doing? Stop it!” Harry shouted, trying to bat the man's hands away. Severus snarled and backhanded him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry reeled back at the blow and fell into a tangled heap on the floor, gazing up at Snape with wide eyes in complete shock. Fear lanced through him when the older man's lips curled into a feral smile. Severus stood and stalked towards the prostrate student. Harry scuttled back like a crab, trying to escape. He wasn't fast enough. Snape was on him in seconds. Bending down, once more grasping Harry's robes, trying to haul the younger wizard to him. Harry panicked and did the only thing he could think of. Harry kicked his Professor square in the bollocks and then scrambled to his feet and put as many desks between himself and the mad man as he could.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>Harry reached inside his shirt and grasped the Order medallion Dumbledore gave him in case of emergencies.</span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>
      <span> Help! Help! Oh, please help! Defense classroom! Help! </span>
    </span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Harry chanted in his mind concentrating with all his might, never taking his eyes off his teacher writhing on the floor with his potion stained hands grasping his groin. Snape in turn did not take his eyes off the panicked student.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You... little... shit!” the man gasped, pain coursing through his body. As a hunted outcast student, Death Eater, and finally spy he had suffered countless injuries, but had never been kicked there. Addled though his mind was by the potion, he was still coherent enough to know that particular pain he never wanted to encounter again. He somehow managed to let go his injured organ long enough to dig through his robe pocket for a pain potion and swiftly swallowed it. The predatory smile returned and he staggered to his feet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry drew his wand and crouched ready to spring into battle. Snape was wild with whatever potion had been contained in Malfoy's sphere, and Harry, though never the best in Potions class, was bright enough to know it was some form of lust potion that had ensnared his teacher. He knew he couldn't out-duel the Potions Master, and couldn't keep out of his grasp indefinitely, but he wouldn't be taken without a fight. His only hope was that Dumbledore would arrive before anything too drastic occurred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry,” Severus purred, licking his lips as he drew his own wand, “Oh, Harry. You may play hard to get, but I will have you, my little prize.” Eyes like volcanic glass gleamed in the afternoon sun streaming through the classroom's windows. He began to circle around the desks separating him from his quarry. Harry moved in tandem, doing his best to keep the man at a distance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Professor, you really don't want to do this.” Harry pleaded, voice choked with fear. “You loathe me, remember? You'll really regret this once that potion's worn off.” Severus' only reply was a low throaty chuckle. Harry brandished his wand and tried to fire a disarming hex. Countering it was mere child's play to the more experienced wizard. Before he knew what happened, Harry's wand was wrenched from his hand and Snape held it up like a trophy before winking and tossing it over his shoulder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You are foolish to resist. I will have you, Harry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I'd really rather you didn't.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Severus laughed and banished the remaining desks between them with a casual flick. Even though it was locked and warded Harry tried to make a break for the door. Snape had him before he had taken five steps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry.” the man's hot breath wafted over his face as Harry was slammed into the wall and pinned. For one disjointed moment Harry marveled that Snape's breath smelled of fresh mint before the pain of impact flared in his back. “Submit, my prize. Make it easier on yourself. Submit and I'll give you pleasure like you've never imagined in your most fevered adolescent fantasies.” Snape's low seductive voice caused Harry to feel a tingle of arousal and the boy blushed. Tears came to his eyes and he felt awash in shame.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Please stop it.” the young Gryffindor mewled, pushing back against the larger man's chest. Snape pressed harder against him so that both bodies were melded firmly together. Harry could feel the man's erection grind against his stomach and gasped.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Long fingers grasped his face and the Potions Master's thin lips crashed against the younger wizard's in a heated and aggressive kiss. Sharp teeth nipped and bit the young man's mouth sharply until he cried out, and when he did the older man took the opportunity to thrust his sinuous tongue inside. Harry felt as though he was being devoured whole. He struggled weakly, overcome with fear. Against his will, Harry's body betrayed him, and he felt his cock twitch and harden. Severus groaned and rocked his pelvis against his unwilling paramour. When Harry stopped struggling and slumped in Snape's grip, the older man finally ended the vicious kiss.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So sweet, Harry. So delectable.” Again the man purred and Harry shuddered. Snape was not attractive, but his voice... oh his voice was beyond sinful. It dripped with sexual promise and Harry's youthful libido couldn't help but respond. “You taste even better than I imagined.” Severus lunged and began biting Harry's throat leaving angry red marks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Please stop? Please?” The plea came out a bare whimper and caused Severus to chuckle and rock his hips against the young man once more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I've only just started.” the older man whispered in Harry's ear, eliciting a shiver and a sob.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Severus loosened and removed Harry's school tie and then ripped open the boy's shirt as he had the robes only minutes before. Graceful fingers ghosted over smooth young flesh. Severus moaned in appreciation. Harry was an athlete and his body reflected that admirably, and it was late enough in the year that he was no longer painfully thin. He was not rippling with muscles, but well toned nonetheless. When Severus went for Harry's belt, the young man's paralysis broke and he began to fight back once more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No!” The cry was raw with anger and shame.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes!” Snape snarled and backhanded Harry again. This time the young man's lip split and his glasses were knocked away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Unhand him!” A blur of tawny hair and shabby robes cannoned into the Potions Master knocking the man off his feet. Harry crumpled to the floor weeping. He drew his knees to his chest and hid his burning face. Somewhere a little distance away he heard the sounds of fists meeting flesh and many voices babbling over one another.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Get off me, Wolf! He's mine!” Snape roared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You sick bastard! How could you!” Again the unmistakable sound of punches being landed. Harry wanted to be sick. He could hear others in the room but refused to look up to verify who was present.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Moony.” Harry sobbed. He was so shaken up, and terribly frightened, but it wasn't really Snape's fault. He couldn't let the beating continue. “Moony, it's not his fault. There was a potion. Malfoy did it. Moony stop!” Harry begged, hating that his voice sounded so vulnerable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Enough! Stupefy!” Dumbledore. Ever the voice of reason. “You may get off him now, Remus. He won't be getting up any time soon.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry,” the boy heard the soft Scottish burr and knew his Head of House had arrived. He looked up into McGonagall's usually stern face and was surprised at the amount of concern he saw there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Professor.” he whispered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Come on and get up now, Harry. Let's get you to the infirmary.” she said, pressing his wand into his hand. He allowed himself to be helped to his feet but couldn't help flinching when the witch wrapped her arm around his shoulders. “It will be alright, Harry. I promise.” she murmured. He wanted to agree with her, but he couldn't. He had a feeling things would only get worse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry loathed the infirmary since his first visit back when we was eleven. However it is only now that he finally understands why that is. The antiseptic scent, the obsessively clean atmosphere, the association with pain and illness... was too much like Privet Drive. The Boy-Who-Lived sat on his usual bed and pondered his discovery in a daze as the teachers and Order members twittered around Snape's bed at the other end of the infirmary. The potion Malfoy doused the Professor in must have been even worse than Harry thought, for Madam Pomfrey hadn't so much as offered him a single healing draught or waved her wand over him in a diagnostic charm, and she was usually rabid about such things. Harry hummed under his breath and went back to contemplating his rather sterile environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Kinglsey took a sample to Horace, hopefully we'll hear something soon.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I'm surprised the Ministry didn't insist.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Obviously some sort of lust potion.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I've never seen the man so out of control!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Perhaps we should move him to a private room?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Will there be an inquest?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Aurors are looking for young Mr. Malfoy, but so far nothing has been found. His dorm room has been cleared out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Shouldn't a general purgatory potion do the trick?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The report will only state that a teacher was slipped a malefic potion against their will.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Doubt it'll come to that.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The many overlapping conversations ebbed and flowed around the forlorn boy as he sat on his bed. He tried not to focus on anything said. No one seemed to care he was there. Perhaps he could return to his dorm now? No. Just because Madam Pomfrey hadn't noticed him when he came in didn't mean she would take kindly to him slipping away while still injured. Harry lay down and curled up on his side, deciding a nap was the best course of action he could take at the moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry awoke with a jolt to someone shaking his shoulder. The infirmary was now dark and deserted, and Harry shivered, wondering what had happened while he was asleep. His face and back were quite sore. Pomfrey hadn't healed him. It was strange that she would have overlooked him. It had never happened before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry, my boy. Sit up please. I need to discuss some things with you.” Dumbledore spoke softly, his voice, barely above a whisper, sounded tired.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sir?” Harry asked, sitting up. Dumbledore was a pale blue blur in the moonlit room. Briefly the Gryffindor wondered what had become of his glasses after Snape knocked them from his face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry, I need your help rather badly. Professor Snape is in quite a bit of danger due to that potion young Malfoy dosed him with this afternoon.” The Headmaster's voice was grave as he took Harry's hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“In danger? But... shouldn't the potion have worked its way out of his system by now? I thought it was like a hyped-up version of Amortentia.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If it were Amortentia, it could be countered, or allowed to diminish, we aren't so fortunate in this instance. From Professor Slughorn's analysis, this potion, which he has never seen before, cannot be countered, nor will it naturally flush from its victim's system after a set amount of time. It binds to the blood and will eventually kill any who fall under its spell.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You mean Snape is going to die?” Harry exclaimed. He didn't particularly like the man, but had never wished for his demise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Professor Snape, Harry... and yes, unless certain conditions are met, Severus will soon die.” Dumbledore squeezed his hands once and then released them. “Harry, Severus is very important to the school and the Order. We need him, and also... Harry, he is like a son to me. I love him dearly and would not see him meet such an ignoble end. I need your help. You are the only one who can help Severus now.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Professor... you know I'm next to useless at Potions, and I know even less about healing.” Harry looked at the blurry old man in confusion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, Harry, potions and healing cannot help him now. As I said, there is no counter-agent that will cure him. Judging by the circumstances in which we found you this afternoon, it is clear you were the first person he gazed upon after being exposed to the potion, correct?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, Sir. He closed his eyes when Malfoy threw it at him, and then opened them and looked at me when I shouted at Malfoy.” Harry nodded, thinking back, remembering the exact sequence of events.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It is likely that Voldemort thought Severus would look at Draco, and thus all hope of avoiding death from the potion would be lost when the young man fled the castle. That you were there and intervened when you did has given Severus a chance. Do you understand that, Harry? You are the key to his survival, my boy. His only chance to live.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry leaned back and twisted his hands in his lap, thinking about his Potions Professor, his behavior that afternoon, and what little he knew of love and lust potions. An ugly, niggling little idea was forming at the back of his mind that settled dread like a lead weight in the pit of his stomach. Harry pushed it away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sir... how exactly am I the key?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry, there isn't a delicate way to explain this, but I will try. Harry, in order to save Severus' life, you must give yourself to him. Do you understand?” The man sounded miserable and embarrassed. Harry knew the feeling as he was experiencing it as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You mean I have to let him... that I must...” Harry tried to speak, but he couldn't coherently articulate what he was feeling. He was sure he must be beet red.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know it must sound quite shocking to you, but, Harry, if you do not do this, he will die, and soon. Time is running out.” The Headmaster was beginning to sound desperate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But, Sir! I'm... I mean I've not... I haven't ever!” And he hadn't. Not with anyone. He had only been kissed that one time by Cho. And Snape was very much a man too. Shouldn't that be taken into consideration. The kiss he'd shared with Cho hadn't done anything for him, but that didn't necessarily mean he fancied boys. Did it? Did it even matter which gender he fancied if someone's life was on the line?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My boy, this may not be an ideal way to divest yourself of your virginity, but please do consider the fact that Severus will surely die if you do not. Harry, surely you see that your virginity is rather inconsequential in comparison to a human life!” Dumbledore's voice rose steadily through his tirade and became infused with anger. Harry recoiled from the man as if struck. The headmaster had never so much as raised his voice to the young Gryffindor before. Harry felt very low in that moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Inconsequential? Yes. Harry was inconsequential. Everything about him was inconsequential except for his use as a weapon. He accepted that after hearing the prophesy last Spring. Without Sirius, Dumbledore was the last person left who ever seemed proud of him. Lupin ran hot and cold. Sometimes he was there, and sometimes he drifted away or disappeared from Harry's life entirely. He didn't want to disappoint the Headmaster, no matter what the cost. Harry nodded and lowered his head. Dumbledore said he loved Snape as a son, that he was important. Harry would do what was necessary because even if the old man didn't really care for him in return, Harry still thought of him as a grandfather; the only one he would ever have.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry followed the Headmaster to the infirmary's isolation suite without further protest. Snape was bound to the bed with magical restraints that both kept him in place and relatively docile. The man was drenched with perspiration, his breath ragged, and without his voluminous teaching robes his arousal was very much evident. When he turned his head and saw Harry standing in the doorway his face lit up in, what was for him, a brilliant smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry.” Snape purred his name and his obsidian eyes pinned the young man to the spot. It seemed impossible to Harry, but the Potions Master looked even more ardent than he'd been that afternoon. The man was the personification of heat. Harry swallowed thickly before looking away from the man and instead at his elderly mentor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You know what you must do, my boy. Just remember most young men are delighted to lose their virginity as soon as possible. It's a trivial thing to give up for a man's life. This is for the best now, Harry. You will be fine, I'm sure.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Headmaster didn't even look at him. His gaze stayed riveted on the potion addled man on the bed. Then the old man pointed his wand in Harry's direction and fired off three quick spells that left the boy reeling. First a wave of nausea hit him as a cramping sensation bent him double, then he felt strangely empty. The next beam of light touched and stretched him so intimately Harry cried out in shock. Finally he felt a cool slickness fill his bottom. Harry gaped at Dumbledore, shocked that his Headmaster knew such spells, much less would use them on a student.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sir?” Harry croaked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That should make it a tad bit easier on you, Harry. Good luck.” Still the man didn't look at him. With a final wave of his wand Snape's restraints fell away and then he was gone. The door sealed shut behind him, leaving Harry alone and adrift in a situation he wasn't prepared to face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape sat up and stared at Harry with such intense hunger the youth trembled, feeling more than seeing the expression on the man's face. Still, Harry had promised in a round about way to see this through, and he wouldn't go back on his word. He walked slowly to the bed, stood just outside his teacher's reach, and removed his robe before tossing it on the nearby visitor's chair, then waited, staring steadily at the floor.</p>
