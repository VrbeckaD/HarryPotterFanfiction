    <p>They had <em> one </em>agreement, Abe and Draco. One agreement that was the central tenet of both their friendship and their business partnership. Abe could always rely on Draco for almost anything. Needed an unexpected cheque cut for a sum that would make most people quiver in their loafers? Draco was on it. Deal with the amp company that kept giving Abe the run around about why their commission prices had suddenly increased fifteen per cent? Draco would be on the phone for as long as it took. Pick up his sister from the airport so that her no-good boyfriend didn’t have the chance to leave her stranded? He could rent the most flash red sports car and dress in his best suit, kiss her on the cheek as he dropped her off and make the douchebag at the window wonder who the handsome blonde she’d showed up with could possibly be.</p><p>He would do whatever the man needed. It’s what friends were for. In return, Draco never, under <em> any </em>circumstances, had to be on the sales floor.</p><p>“Draco, I promise, this is the only time I will ever do this to you,” Abe whined into the phone. “I will deal with the paystubs for a month. <em> Two months </em> . Please, mate. You’re my last hope.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, dear lord. <em> Fine. </em> I’ll stop by and make sure Marco doesn’t burn the place down.”<br/>
<br/>
“Well,” Abe said hesitantly. “That’s...that’s the thing, Draco. Marco isn’t there either.”<br/>
<br/>
“Excuse me?” Draco shouted down the receiver. “What do you <em> mean </em> Marco isn’t there.”<br/>
<br/>
“Marco is sort’ve...here,” Abe replied miserably.<br/>
<br/>
Draco sighed, rubbed his temples, but was already standing up and pulling on his coat. It was hardly a surprise, the way those two had been circling each other this month, but being right about his best friend’s taste in men was poor comfort when he knew he was going to be surrounded by customers for the next five hours. Five, because at least at that point, he could fake some emergency and close the shop early with one of those kitschy sharpie written signs he saw all the time on other people’s doors.<br/>
<br/>
“So let me get this straight,” Draco said, retrieving his keys and locking the door behind him. He waited for the lift while leaning on the wall, hating the wall sconces as usual, angry at the blandness of the carpet beneath his feet.<br/>
<br/>
“Draco, don’t start.”<br/>
<br/>
“You, my ever reliable business partner, front-man of the best investment I’ve ever made, manager <em> extraordinaire </em> ,” Draco drawled. “That manager found a way to get stuck on the Isle of Wight over the weekend. In the middle of the winter. And you just so <em> happen </em> to have our assistant manager with you?”<br/>
<br/>
“Are you done?” Abe replied. Even his voice sounded mortified.</p><p>Draco laughed.”Yeah, I guess so. But just let me tell you...my father will be hearing about this in the quarterly meeting.” <br/>
<br/>
“Oh god, I hope not,” Abe chuckled. “He’d die of shock. I can basically hear him now. <em>But isn’t Marco a </em>MAN?”</p><p>Draco roared with laughter as he started his car and let his phone switch to handsfree. “Go enjoy your free day, you arse. I’ll try not to bankrupt us before the day is out.” </p><p>“Just don’t let Al into the guitar room and you’ll be fine. Draco?” Abe muttered gently. “I really am sorry.”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s fine.”<br/>
<br/>
“But we have a deal.”<br/>
<br/>
“Abrahim. It’s. Fine.”</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Harry was at a loss for what he was going to do with the day and it was seriously stressing him out. He <em> needed </em>to go look for a job. He just didn’t want to. Every day was the same story; get up, hand out resumes, eat a chicken sandwich in a cafe, hand out more resumes, go home to make dinner. He had to find something soon, or he’d go insane.</p><p>Ron and Hermione, best friends that they were, had been very calm about his decision not to enter the Air Force. They had no right to be calm about anything at all. He’d told them in a terrible way. At their leaving tea, with all their teachers standing around holding flutes of champagne, all of them dressed in the fanciest Dress Uniforms that their posh private school could imagine. It had been the entirely wrong time to blurt out that he had, over the last two weeks, changed the entire trajectory of his five-year plan.<br/>
<br/>
Hermione Granger, math genius and language guru, was very big on ‘Five Year Plans’. She had made Ron and Harry start making them the second they had determined that they <em> were, </em>in fact, friends. Ron’s had changed a lot over the years; as he determined that he hated a subject, or that he wasn’t actually going to make it onto premier league football, he made changes to what he was ‘sure’ he was going to be great at when he finally got out of Hogwarts. Harry’s plan had always stayed the same.</p><p>“Air Force,” he would say. “Like my dad. Going to go help civilians, just like him.”<br/>
<br/>
It was easy enough to say, especially when your entire school knew that you were the miraculous survivor of a wartime tragic love tale that had been splashed around the papers. It sold better than being the gangly, unwanted baby of a couple that was too young and then died. Discovering that he had not been unloved had changed the trajectory of his life. The letter to Hogwarts Academy all those years ago had been the rather a shock; a full scholarship, set up in the name of his parents, and a full ride to attend a preeminent private school where they had both gone. His name was on wings in the library, his father had a plaque in the upper halls, and his mother’s face smiled out at him from the common room in his dormitory. The parents who had loved him so much were heroes, both within the school and within the families who had been going there for generations.</p><p>Since the day he’d suddenly learned too much about his family, he’d never looked back. Now, though, at seventeen and with an entire future ahead of him that he’d never been foolish enough to count on? It seemed too simplistic, short-sighted. Childish.</p><p>So, he decided not to follow ‘<em> The Plan </em>’.</p><p>Which would have been great had he had a <em> backup </em>plan, an alternate? That had been the downside of the Hermione Five Year Plan Plan model. She’d not followed through with the boys to make sure they had choices.</p><p>Which was how he now lived on a couch in her flat, ignoring the fact that he could hear <em> everything </em>through the too-thin walls and pretending every day that he was looking for work. They were being patient with him, but the fact remained that their newly formed, adult lives were being cramped by his presence in a way that had never happened at school. No one needed to say it to make it true.</p><p>He threw on his last clean button up and ran a passing hand through his hair; yet another reason to get a job. He needed a haircut and he refused to use his parent's money to pay for something so trivial. As a result, his hair was currently more unruly than it had ever been. What had once been a fashionable sort of undercut flop was now just a chaotic mass of curls. He pretended to look Classic Rock, but he probably just looked like a ruffian.</p><p>He didn’t exactly have a <em> purpose </em> when he left the house, at least not one that contained anything more detailed than <em> ‘leave before Hermione came home for lunch with a new batch of classified ads’ </em>. So, he sauntered into the city, hit Soho, and realised how much had changed in a year. Normally, wandering the neighbourhood would normally have been dangerous for his pocketbook. It was hard, however, to spend zero pounds on useless things and expensive coffee.</p><p>After an hour spent in three bookstores, a shop that had recently gone from selling hair accessories to vintage records, and the weird new popup that seemed to be trying to market bottles of scented air, Harry found himself in front of the chic little music store that he’d always been afraid to enter when he’d come down this street before. Music people scared him; there was an arrogance about them that unsettled him. He’d once managed to go into one of those chain guitar shops, with the full intention of buying himself a new guitar. He’d fled after asking a question about an amp that had been met with indignant animosity and arched eyebrows. Guitar people could be mean and Harry Potter did not enjoy being looked down on.</p><p>Since he had only ever played in the dark hidden corners of the castle, on an ancient piece of shit with plastic strings that constantly went out of tune, he knew very little about the technical side of music. He supposed he’d gotten pretty good, using books of old Beatles tunes and <em> Learn to Play the Guitar; an introduction for kids, Level 1 </em>, which he’d taken out from the Hogwarts library and conveniently never returned. Still, only Ron had ever heard him play and that had been by accident. It made it hard to justify the pain of trying to buy a guitar.</p><p>Today though, he had at least an hour before he was going to let himself go home. More importantly, he was having a hard time. Surely he could justify something like a guitar with his parent's money; ultimate happiness had to be the goal of inheritance, right? He took a deep breath and pushed open the door. The melodic bells that went off were very appropriate but they made Harry want to cower behind the tower of amps he found himself faced with just inside the door.<br/>
<br/>
“Hello,” a posh voice called loudly from the back. Harry braced himself.</p><p>A tall man with staggeringly white blonde hair came out from behind the counter as the door shut behind him.</p><p>“Er, hey,” Harry replied.</p><p>“Anything I can help you with?” the man asked pleasantly. For some reason, he seemed slightly amused.</p><p>“Just...um, just looking around,” Harry mumbled.</p><p>“Okay, well, let me know if there’s anything I can help you with. You’re my first customer today. Which, let me tell you, is pretty hilarious, all things considered.” The man chuckled and Harry stared at him. He failed to see how having no business at all was funny.<br/>
<br/>
“Er, right. Well. Yeah. Thanks,” he responded.</p><p>“Oh, well, you see,” the man began to explain, unprompted. “I’m the owner. I don’t normally work in the shop but my manager decided to get stuck in the Isle of Wight with my assistant manager, which we all predicted would happen—well, no, not the Isle of Wight I suppose. That would have been a ridiculous prediction, but anyway. Now…oh god, I’m babbling, aren’t? Forgive me. I’ve had far too much coffee today. Al made a  whole pot and it’s just the two of us and it’s been dead in here, so...you do not care about this. Apologies, I’ll leave you to it.”</p><p>Harry surprised himself by laughing; something about this man, obviously completely out of his element and thrown off by his day, soothed his nerves. He took in the small silver earring that was peeking out from the man’s cartilage, embraced the white t-shirt beneath a tight blazer, and enjoyed the bright teal of the man’s trousers.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>“I’m Harry,” he offered, for no apparent reason, extending his hand. The man smiled in return.</p><p>“Draco,” he supplied, returning the shake. “So, seriously. Now that I’ve officially wasted five minutes of your time, is there something I can help you with?”<br/>
<br/>
Harry looked around the shop, eyes fixated suddenly on the wall of guitars. “Guess I’m looking for a guitar,” he said with a shrug. “Nothing fancy. Acoustic. The one I learned on was absolute shit so I honestly just want to…”</p><p>He let his sentence fall out of the bottom as he realised that he was following Draco closer towards the wall. He didn’t think that he’d actually planned on staying inside, let alone looking at an instrument.<br/>
<br/>
“They’re all here, free standing. If you want to play some, you can pull them down and put them on the stands in there,” Draco was explaining.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t...I can’t,” Harry paused and shoved his hands in his pockets. “I’m not buying one today.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco grinned at him. “No one is standing here pressuring you. Instruments are like parts of your body. There’s not much point in me trying to convince you which one you should buy. I’ll be back there if you need anything.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry laughed again. “You sell a lot with this strategy?”<br/>
<br/>
Draco turned back around with another grin, his long blonde bangs flopping forward into his eyes. “I told you, Harry,” he quipped. “I don’t normally sell <em> anything </em>, at all. Have fun.”</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Draco moved much more quickly back to the back room than he’d left it the first time. Al was still standing over the boxes of shipping orders that needed to be processed, looking as useless as he always did. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Everything alright?” he asked dully, seeing Draco in a state of slight exasperation. Draco was surprised Al even noticed, given that slight exasperation was his usual state around him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I may have accidentally flirted with our only customer,” Draco relented. Al snorted. “Though in my defence,” Draco amended. “He’s really cute.” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Some days, I really wonder how the hell I ended up working with the four gayest men in England,” Al teased. “Do you want me to go deal with him? You know, because of the whole ‘moratorium on men’ thing?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I really shouldn’t tell Abrahim anything, should I?” Al shrugged. “No, I’m going back out there.”</span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Draco lifted a clipboard from the desk beside him and started reading the list. Al arched an eyebrow at him.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“What? I am. You know,” Draco sniffed, raising his chin and trying to call forth all his public school pride and snottiness; he knew he was not believable but still. “In a minute,”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Four minutes later, he decided he should probably be back on the floor if only to stop Al from ending up in the guitar room. He stood up way too straight and tried to remind himself that he was, in fact, in the middle of a moratorium. He’d made Abrahim swear to slap him, fully and physically, if he managed to mess around with anyone his family hadn’t met and preapproved. As much as Draco hated to admit it, he was on thin bloody ice with his father. He—quite literally—could not afford to piss him off any more. He cleared his throat and forced himself not to consider the extremely fit nature of the curly-haired, bespectacled, nervous-around-guitars Harry that he was going to find in the next room.</span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>He failed miserably when he found him sitting in the booth, gently strumming. Though Draco couldn’t hear through the glass, he could </span>
  <em>
    <span>see </span>
  </em>
  <span>him, sitting there with Draco’s favourite guitar, the red oak Seagull classic. He’d had his choice of all the big fancy brands on the wall, had ignored the Fender’s and the Gibson’s, and had picked up a no-name guitar with more character in one fret than any of the mass-produced pieces. Draco was impressed. Perhaps even a little enamoured. He needed to find another reason to talk to this Harry bloke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry, the mysterious brunette whose shoes were expensive but scuffed beyond appropriate use, with a name brand button-up that was clearly several years old, and whose hair had needed cutting for at least a month. The Harry who’d made Draco, who very rarely showed emotion to strangers, smile and chuckle and share unnecessary information. The Harry who Draco had been pretty sure could </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>actually play the guitar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quietly, without making a fuss, Draco hit the record button in the booth, sending the sound out into the shop and also onto the hard drive on the desk. He didn’t know what possessed him to do it; in fact, he was pretty sure it was borderline illegal. He did it anyway. He also stood there and listened for the next five minutes. He didn’t claim to be an expert by any means; owning a music shop did not give him any qualifications that the average listener didn’t also have. But this bloke. There was something about him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was </span>
  <em>
    <span>good</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Really good.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he stopped a short time later, stood up, stretched, and walked out of the booth, Draco only just had time to switch off the recording devices before he opened the door with the guitar proffered in front of him. Though it wasn’t clear that the intention was there, Draco reached out and took the guitar from his hands. He cleared his throat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Interesting choice. This isn’t a popular brand,” Draco muttered, turning the guitar in his hands.</span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Harry shrugged. “Liked the sound when I strummed it. Rich. Colour’s nice too. They’re Canadian, right?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Draco nodded. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Wish I could take it home today,” Harry replied with an embarrassed shrug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I, uh,” Draco was suddenly very embarrassed. “You sounded pretty great. You play professionally somewhere?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Harry laughed. “Never even in front of my flatmates.” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“That’s ridiculous,” Draco said seriously. “You’re...I mean, you’re always welcome to come play here. Until you can take it home, that is.” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Harry smiled shyly. “I’d be embarrassed. I only did it today because no one could hear me—wait, how did </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>hear me?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Draco scrubbed the back of his neck; he hadn’t thought he was going to have to fess up so quickly. He unplugged the thumb drive from the booth. “I didn’t mean to do something creepy. It’s the only way to bring the sound through the speakers. You can take this. Go in there and listen to yourself. You should be submitting it to the producer I work with. He’s not big, but he’d definitely take it.” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Harry laughed again, but he did reach out and take the stick from Draco’s, hesitantly looking behind him in the booth. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I think maybe you’ve mistaken me for someone else,” Harry said eventually, gently placing the stick on the windowsill of the booth behind him. “Thanks a lot, Draco. Hope it gets busier.” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Good </span>
  <em>
    <span>lord</span>
  </em>
  <span>, I hope not,” Draco exclaimed. “Hope you reconsider.” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Won’t,” Harry chuckled. “Consider that thing your property now. Use it to remember me by, as I sell my soul to corporate life...I’ve realised after playing that absolutely beautiful instrument that I’m going to need a paycheck. Can’t justify living off my parents anymore.” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>He smirked as he gave a half wave, even though Draco’s head was reeling at the statement. How could a throwaway comment about from a stranger have rung so true for his own life? His entire being was demanding he stop the man who was walking away. Screw the moratorium on men. He was going to see Harry again. Draco didn’t care that for now, he had no surname, no permission, and zero idea how why exactly he cared. </span>
