    <p>Harry had always thought that Voldemort’s death was the key to his prosperous, serene and happy life. The prophecy had hinted at it. Dumbledore too, but all three couldn’t have been further from the truth. Voldemort was dead … but he didn’t feel at peace. He didn’t feel happy. He didn’t even feel sad or angry. In fact, he felt perpetually tired and completely hollow, as if nothing mattered.</p><p>He thought this … <em>state</em> was temporary … that it would wear off, go away and he would pick things up where he left them before he set out on the hunt for Voldemort’s horcruxes. He was going to finish his education, get a job, have a family and die of old age, but nothing changed. No matter how many months passed by, he still felt tired and empty. Even the simple act of waking and getting up in the morning proved difficult, when nothing about his life interested him anymore.</p><p>A month after Voldemort perished for good, Harry started attending sessions with a therapist who diagnosed him with major depressive disorder. He got counselling and antidepressants but neither were effective. He tried a few potions as well, but soon discovered that they were ineffective and that mixing them with antidepressants was an extremely bad idea when he almost died a few days before his eighteenth birthday and had to be rushed to St. Mungo’s where they emptied his stomach and blood of any chemical residue.</p><p>As a last resort, he subjected himself to electroconvulsive therapy, but even that didn’t help, if anything … it made everything worse, but instead of being open and honest about it, he faked his improved mental state, if only to stop the treatment that was clearly not helping him at all.</p><p align="center">…</p><p>When he turned eighteen, he still felt indifferent about everything and everyone around him. He couldn’t care less that he had turned eighteen, he didn’t care for all the presents he got from friends, the Weasleys and fans, the food, the party, nothing. Yet, he knew better than to show it, so he covered it with smiles.</p><p>Among the mountain of fan mail, there was a letter from Gringotts, summoning him to take over the Potter property, title and money officially. He didn’t really care that much about it. He was fine with living in his godfather’s house, but he still responded to the letter and presented himself at the bank.</p><p>After freeing the dragon locked underground and causing significant damage to the bank itself, the goblins weren’t thrilled to see him, however, business was business and money was money and goblins were first and foremost greedy little creatures and a generous donation in Harry’s name had worked wonders. He still wasn’t welcome, but at least the goblins didn’t look like they wanted to skin him alive, not that he cared.</p><p>What he thought would be a quick affair, simply signing a few papers, turned into an immensely insightful event. Before he signed anything, he had to take an in-depth blood test to see if his claim to the title, property and money was justified. As it turned out, he was a suitable heir, but what caught his attention the most was one tiny detail on the parchment where his soulmate’s name was written in blood red ink.</p><p>
  <em>Tom Marvolo Riddle (Lord Voldemort) (deceased)</em>
</p><p>‘Oh,’ was all he thought. There was no other physical or emotional reaction to learning such a shocking thing.</p><p>“You don’t seem shocked or otherwise surprised to learn that the Dark Lord was your soulmate, Mr. Potter,” commented the goblin manager overseeing the documentation. “Were you aware of the information?”</p><p>“No,” he deadpanned. “I wasn’t aware the man was my soulmate, and I probably would have reacted differently had I been able to feel anything at all, but, as it happens, I feel ‘meh’ about everything and everyone these days.”</p><p>“How long have you felt like this?” the goblin inquired warily.</p><p>“The moment Voldemort died,” he responded nonchalantly. “I tried different treatments, but nothing worked, magical or non-magical.” An idea occurred to him. “Say … would my predicament have anything to do with his death and the fact that he was my soulmate?”</p><p>“Indeed,” the creature concluded gravely. “His death has everything to do with your current predicament, Mr. Potter, and I am afraid you are going to be stuck feeling like this until you die, because losing one’s soulmate is like losing yourself and nothing and nobody can fill the void left behind by a soulmate’s death.”</p><p>“I see. Makes sense,” he commented in a flat voice. “Well, what a bummer, I guess. At least now, I know why I feel nothing. That’s also something. Where do I sign so I can go back to my house and sleep?”</p><p>The sudden shift in the topic of their conversation, the lack of reaction and emotion on Harry’s part, startled the goblin a bit, but he quickly recovered and presented the legal documents to Harry, who signed them in a heartbeat, waited for the ring indicating his new status in the wizarding world then politely ended the conversation and left.</p><p align="center">…</p><p>Despite knowing that he was damned to feel empty for the rest of his life, Harry did his best to continue surviving and play the part of the man everyone was accustomed to see. He was so convincing in his acting (he wasn’t sure how or when he had gotten so good at it anyway), that no one suspected anything. He faked sadness and tears when talking about the people lost in the war and he faked happiness and enthusiasm when he was with his friends and family … his godson. He faked disgust and anger when talking about Voldemort and Death Eaters. The only thing he didn’t have to fake was his disinterest in romance and sex.</p><p>His friends tried to convince him to give dating a try, but he stood his ground and never involved himself romantically or sexually with anyone. If he didn’t feel inclined when he was still emotionally functional and his soulmate was alive, now he was even less inclined to pursue anything when he was nothing but a shell made of bones, muscle, skin and internal organs.</p><p>He knew why his friends and Mrs. Weasley insisted. They wanted him to experience the joy of being with someone, of having a family. A pity he couldn’t tell them the real reason he would never be able to experience it, but he was fine with them being convinced he was what people called asexual and aromantic and letting the issue go.</p><p>If only the rest of the wizarding world had been as understanding as them, that would have been lovely, but apparently, there were people who believed they could change his mind on this even when the news became common knowledge thanks to the press.</p><p align="center">…</p><p>He finished Hogwarts with high grades. Almost as high as Hermione’s. However, instead of immediately entering the Law Enforcement Department at the Ministry, he surprised everyone by becoming a professional Quidditch player.</p><p>During the year, the ban he had on Quidditch had been lifted and he gave the sport another go, just to see if he could feel anything, however minuscule, doing what he once loved. And while he was still an excellent flyer and seeker, there was no thrill, no joy in feeling the air hit his face, no excitement in catching the snitch and winning the game. Even so, he ended up accepting an offer from the Chudley Cannons, signed a one-year contract with the team after Hogwarts, and led them to victory.</p><p>The team was eager to keep him, but he politely refused and tried being an Auror. After all, he had expressed an interest in the profession, had been offered a place among them due to his war effort and natural proficiency with Defence against the Dark Arts, so maybe by doing what he knew best (fighting criminals) it would get his blood pumping again, make him feel alive. However, during the year he worked as an Auror for the Ministry, he only managed to confirm further that he was nothing more than a living corpse, because nothing affected him as it used to.</p><p>Prior to Voldemort’s death, he would have felt anger and disgust hearing and witnessing injustice, torture, and oppression. He would have felt sick seeing the mutilated bodies of victims he encountered in his cases, but now he felt nothing. He felt completely indifferent to the suffering of others.</p><p>He didn’t feel pity or sympathy for the people he helped just as he felt no anger or disgust towards the criminals he was putting behind bars. The only thing he tried to uphold was law and order regardless of how it emotionally influenced the people involved. However, since he couldn’t let people become suspicious of his lack of emotions, he faked appropriate emotions and reactions depending on the situation.</p><p>However, no matter how much he tried to fake vomiting, he simply couldn’t bring himself to puke when faced with the most gruesome states of some of the corpses he encountered. Maybe that was why he spent the last few months of his one-year contract analysing and dissecting barely recognisable corpses for evidence.</p><p>After his one-year employment ended, instead of renewing his contract, he spoke to McGonagall, who was the new Headmistress of Hogwarts, and asked her for the DADA teaching position since the current DADA professor was on maternity leave for a year.</p><p align="center">…</p><p>On New Year’s Eve, Harry requested a private conversation with Dumbledore’s portrait to clear some of his doubts. He supposed that now that the war was over, the man could tell him everything without problems.</p><p>“Harry, my boy,” he greeted him. “What a surprise. I heard you are the substitute DADA professor while Mrs. Hart is on maternity leave. Is there anything I can do for you?”</p><p>“Good evening, Professor,” he greeted back. “I was wondering if you could tell me something.”</p><p>“If it’s within my knowledge, most certainly,” he said grandfatherly. “Ask away.” He smiled.</p><p>“It’s about Voldemort, sir.”</p><p>Dumbledore’s smile immediately fell away. “What about him, Harry?”</p><p>“When I turned eighteen, I was summoned to Gringotts to sign some papers … you know, family property, title and finances. However, in order to sign them, I had to take some detailed blood test and the test said that … I had a soulmate.” He paused for a bit. “That Voldemort was my soulmate, Professor.”</p><p>Dumbledore’s eyes widened.</p><p>“My question to you is, were you aware of that piece of information or were you as clueless as I was?”</p><p>“No, Harry,” he shook his head ever so slightly. “I didn’t know. I doubt anyone knew … not even your parents.”</p><p>He nodded. “And had you known, Professor?” he pressed further. “Had you known we were soulmates … would you have done anything differently?”</p><p>Dumbledore’s portrait fell silent. Harry took that as a no, but just as he was about to excuse himself and leave, the man in the painting spoke again. “I don’t know, Harry. Maybe … maybe not. Your soulmate or not, Voldemort was still a dangerous individual that had to be stopped.”</p><p>“What about Grindelwald, Professor?” asked Harry impassively. “He was also a very dangerous man that had to be stopped, yet as far as I know he was imprisoned and not killed. Why was he alive and why did Voldemort have to die?”</p><p>Dumbledore left out a sigh and he didn’t dare look Harry in the eye. “I didn’t have the heart to do it,” he confessed. “For all the pain and destruction he had caused, I couldn’t kill him.”</p><p>“Why?” Harry insisted flatly.</p><p>It took the former headmaster a few moments to answer. “Because I loved him.”</p><p>“Why wasn’t I able to recognise my true connection to Voldemort? I should have been able to feel some sort of attraction or desire for him.”</p><p>“Oh, I think you did,” he said, smirking mischievously and winking at him. “You were his horcrux after all. You shared thoughts and feelings. When we were reviewing the memories that featured him, I’m sure you noticed his good looks and felt attracted to him, I’m also quite certain that you felt sympathy for his situation at the orphanage.”</p><p>Harry thought back to all his interactions with Voldemort and whenever he saw him as Tom Marvolo Riddle in the form of a diary or memory, he couldn’t help but think how handsome he was and he did feel something akin to attraction, desire, perhaps even arousal. However, it had been so long since he felt those things that his memory wasn’t able to supply the exact sensations anymore and even if it could, he probably wouldn’t have felt anything either way.</p><p>“I suppose, but still … at no point did I have a revelation that it was anything else. Or Voldemort for that matter. Why? Aren’t soulmates meant to recognise each other as such since they apparently can’t function normally without one another?”</p><p>“I am afraid I don’t hold the answer to that, my boy,” lamented Dumbledore. “Perhaps reading about the subject might give you the answer you seek.”</p><p>Harry nodded. “Thank you for your time, Professor. And your answers.”</p><p>“You’re welcome, Harry. I only wish I had been more helpful. I hope you find the answers you seek.”</p><p>“Me too.” He turned to leave, when the portrait spoke to him.</p><p>“Oh, and Harry,” he called after him. Harry stopped, but didn’t turn. “Take care of yourself.”</p><p align="center">…</p><p>Harry spent most of his free time researching soulmates, trying to understand why neither he nor Voldemort had recognised each other as soulmates. Yet no matter how much he read, he didn’t get an answer to his question. Mostly because there wasn’t much written on soulmates to begin with, since there weren’t many studies conducted in the field to provide a generalisation or representation of the phenomenon, but apparently there were several types of soulmate bonds. There was the romantic soulmate bond, the platonic soulmate bond and the familial soulmate bond.</p><p>The first one, as the name suggested, bound two individuals as a couple, the second one bound two individuals as best friends and the last one bound two completely unrelated people together as family. The bonds were forged no matter the age or gender and could last a lifetime or an eternity. However, while having the bond in place was a good start for different kinds of relationships between people, simply being soulmates wasn’t enough to forge anything meaningful if there was no interaction between them. Even those who actively hated or disliked each other could forge a relationship, albeit one based on mutual hatred.</p><p>No matter the type of bond, the individuals who had outlived their friends, ‘family’ and partners had all reported losing the capacity to feel emotions to some extent and feeling empty, hollow or incomplete. The intensity of the feeling depended on a number of things, such as the type of bond, the rapport between soulmates and the time they knew each other.</p><p>Evaluating their situation, Harry speculated that while he wasn’t sure into which category their bond fell (because it could have been any of the three really), the intensity and the duration of him being unable to feel genuine emotions testified in favour of it being a romantic bond rather than a platonic or a familial one. Add to that the fact that Voldemort and he knew each other for at least seven years, during which they both disliked and worked against one another, but also came to learn a lot about the other, had been able to see into each other’s minds and feel what the other was feeling, and it was a deep enough connection to form a once-in-a-lifetime bond with each other.</p><p>He decided to give his condition another year or two to improve and if he remained as he was, then he was going to kill himself.</p>
