    <p>Ever since her mysterious appearance on the Dursleys doorway nearly fifteen years ago, Hadrian Potter had always been the one that stood out in her neighborhood. With bright-green piercing eyes, large, round glasses, jet-black hair, and bulky clothes, she was often the popular ‘conversation’ topic. Over the years, she got used to the points and snickers from the other children and rarely got personally offended by it anymore. By her third year in grade school, she had mastered all the detour routes to classes and was normally able to avoid people in general.</p><p><br/> Hadrian knew nothing of her parents. Whenever she would mention them as a child, she would be punished and given extra chores. Hadrian had always known that her relatives took her in when she was a baby, after her parents died in a car crash when she was only a year old. She had always just assumed that she had no other relatives. The Dursleys never liked it when she asked questions about her former-family, Uncle Vernon in particular. She did not know the reason for their hostility towards them, but found it better not to ask.</p><p> </p><p>The day before her fifteenth birthday found Hadrian in the middle of washing the breakfast dishes. The Dursleys never celebrated birthdays in their house. Except her cousin Dudley’s of course…and Aunt Petunia’s… and Uncle Vernon’s. Hadrian was used to being left out like that though, it didn’t seem to bother her anymore.</p><p> </p><p>The doorbell sounded through the house, spelling Hadrian out of her daydreams. This one involving an enflamed house and her adopted-families satisfying screams.</p><p> </p><p> She paused in the middle of washing a plate, debating whether or not to pause her work and answer the door, when she heard Aunt Petunia come down the stairs. From her spot at the sink, Hadrian could only make out bits of the conversation.</p><p> </p><p>“-a Ms. Potter?” a woman’s voice carried through the hall.</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian’s curiosity and shock bubbled up inside of her. While drying her hands on her large, patch-filled dress, she snuck towards the kitchen door and peeked out.</p><p> </p><p>A strict-looking woman was standing in the open door-way of the house. From what she could see at her point of view, she was wearing a finely pressed dress-suit, her grey-brown hair was tied back in a tight bun on top of her head. Silver spectacles balanced on the end of her nose and a letter in hand.</p><p>“Ms. Potter?” Aunt Petunia repeated slowly, and did not remove her hand from the doorknob. Hadrian could not see her face, but she could tell that her usual disgusted look was in place, the one that she always got at the mentioning of the surname.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, a Ms. Hadrian Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>“May I ask who you are?” Aunt Petunia replied curtly.</p><p> </p><p>“My name, is Professor McGonagall,” Supplied the woman. “And I am here on official Hogwarts business.”</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian saw Aunt Petunia’s hand tighten on the door knob at the mention of Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>“Hadrian did not apply for your school,” she replied coolly. “She is too young to study at-“</p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Potter has shown special potential.” Interrupted McGonagall “As young as she may be for this grade work, I dare say she has proven her capability. However, she will not be the only adolescent there. In fact, I am sure you have heard of one, or at least his father, Lucius Malfoy?”</p><p> </p><p>“I have never heard of such a man.” Aunt Petunia countered, and perhaps a bit too quickly because Hadrian could see that McGonagall did not believe her for a second.</p><p> </p><p>The Dursleys have indeed known of the Malfoy family. Lucius Malfoy was the co-owner of a large company owned by a man named Tom Riddle. Mr. Dursley had been trying to meet with him over the past few months in hopes of securing a position in his staff. At the moment, Mr. Dursley worked as the director at a company called Grunnings. Hadrian always thought it was a fancy name for a place that sold screw-drivers, but she would not dare say that aloud.</p><p> </p><p>“Really, I am surprised.” McGonagall replied, though her tone conveyed that she wasn’t. “Nevertheless, Ms. Potter is about to come of age and when she does, it is her decision to make.”</p><p> </p><p>“She will not be going.”</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian jumped back from the door at the sound of her Uncle Vernon’s voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, you must be Mr. Vernon Dursley.” Came McGonagall’s muffled voice.</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian recovered quickly and resumed her spot at the kitchen door. She could now see her Uncle making his way down the steps towards the two women.</p><p> </p><p>“She will not be going.” Uncle Vernon repeated stopping beside Aunt Petunia.</p><p> </p><p>“As I said earlier, Ms. Hadrian Potter will come of age before her term starts this year.” McGonagall stated “It will be her decision whether she attends Hogwarts or not.”</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian felt that she was about to explode from curiosity. What was Hogwarts, and why, if the Dursleys knew about it, had she never heard of the place? How is it that these people knew of her? How did they even know where she lived?</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian’s head was buzzing with so many questions that she missed what was going on in the hallway.</p><p> </p><p>“We will not be paying for that girl to go to some prissy Academy.” Uncle Vernon spat.</p><p> </p><p>McGonagall looked slightly nonplussed but recovered quickly. “I can assure you that Ms. Potter has already been well taken care of, financially.”</p><p> </p><p>Uncle Vernon sputtered and Hadrian could see the back of his pudgy neck turn purple. That was NOT a good sign.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you talking about?” He demanded “I have not authorized any payments to this freak school of yours and I don't see where she will be finding the funds otherwise!”</p><p> </p><p>“Surely you didn’t think that her parents would have left her with nothing?” chided McGonagall.</p><p> </p><p>The Dursleys remained silent.</p><p> </p><p>“Once Ms. Potter comes of age, she will be given access to her parent's accounts at Gringotts.” She said, annoyance clear on her face “You already know this, of course, because of the letter her parents sent you nearly thirteen years ago.”</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p><em>A letter?</em> Hadrian didn’t hear anything about this before. The woman must have made a mistake, she was only living at the Dursleys residence because her parents died fourteen years ago. No one could send a letter a year after their death. Hadrian was starting to feel frustrated, none of this made any sense.</p><p> </p><p>“Hadrian will not be having anything to do with your kind!” Uncle Vernon spat.</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your kind?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I haven’t the faintest idea what you are talking about.” McGonagall replied with a blank face.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Oho!</em> Don’t give me that!” Uncle Vernon replied coldly, his voice lowering to a harsh whisper so that Hadrian had to strain her ears to listen. “When we took her in we vowed that we would put a stop to that Order business!”</p><p> </p><p> McGonagall face remained expressionless, but Hadrian thought she saw her eye twitch angrily.</p><p> </p><p>“I am afraid that this is out of your hands now.” McGonagall replied with purport calm “Ms. Potter’s response will be expected no later than the 31st of July, as it says on this letter.”</p><p> </p><p>She handed Uncle Vernon the envelope she had been holding, Hadrian could see a flash of what she suspected was the school’s emblem stamped in wax on the front.</p><p> </p><p>“I am sorry if this situation has proven to be inconvenient.” McGonagall stated, though she did not bother hiding the glee in her tone.</p><p> </p><p>She turned to leave and started off down the walkway. Aunt Petunia started to close the door when McGonagall spoke again.</p><p>“Oh, and Mr. Dursley?” She called, turning back around. “I shall know whether or not Ms. Potter receives that letter. I will have you know, she will read it sooner or later.”</p><p> </p><p>Uncle Vernon gave her a look of upmost fury, but she either did not see or care. She turned back around with a satisfied smile and disappeared around the corner.</p>
