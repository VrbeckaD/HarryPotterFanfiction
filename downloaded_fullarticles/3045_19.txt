          <div class="userstuff"><p>“If you would just come back with me, we could do this properly,” Draco said, a hint of teasing in his voice. </p><p>“You know I would…” Harry trailed off, a smirk lifting the corners of his mouth. “If you weren’t trying to seduce me to your lair.” </p><p>“My <i>lair</i>?” Draco asked incredulously. “I don’t have a lair, Harry. My home is much more than that. And you would know that if you would just come back with me.”</p><p>“I’ve been warned about the dangers of voluntarily going to the Fae lands, Draco. I’m not some first year at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“But your magical education left so much out about the Fae. I’ve read the sections in your Hogwarts textbooks and they are laughable.” </p><p>“So I should trust your word?” Harry laughed. “Even if my Hogwarts education was lacking, they did teach me one thing, and that’s that you should never trust the Fae.”</p><p>“Harry, you wound me,” Draco said, actually looking a bit put out. “Have I ever lied to you in the years that we’ve known each other?”</p><p>“Yes, Draco, yes you have. You’ve told me that you would meet me for dinner and haven’t shown up.”</p><p>“That was <i>one</i> time, Harry. One time. And it’s not like you’re blameless in…” he paused, trying to find the right words, “whatever this is.” </p><p>“‘Whatever this is?’ What does this even mean to you, Draco?” Harry asked indignantly. “Because we’ve been doing this for going on three years, and I just don’t know if I can continue like this anymore.”</p><p>“Well, I know that I can’t,” Draco stated exasperatedly. </p><p>“Wait,” Harry said. “So you’re telling me that you actually want to give this a chance?” </p><p>“Yes, that’s what I’ve been trying to tell you for some time. I even invited you to my home, but you wouldn’t listen to me.” </p><p>“You were serious all those times?”</p><p>“Of course I was, Harry. This is something that I would never joke about."</p><p>"Oh," Harry considered that. "In that case, please take me to your <i>lair</i>, Draco." </p><p>Draco smiled fondly and took Harry's hand.</p></div>
