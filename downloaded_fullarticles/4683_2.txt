          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was just an inch but it was the most infuriating inch Draco had ever encountered in his life. It was just one small, in other situations insignificant inch but attached to Harry Potter it made a world of difference, because it meant perfect Potter with his scar and his broomstick was now taller than Draco. Taller. Than. Draco. It just wasn’t done.</p><p>“Why the frown, Malfoy?”</p><p>Draco turned around and found himself eye to eye – no, eye to nose – with the object of his frustrations.</p><p>“Stop being so tall, Potter,” he demanded.</p><p>“Never,” Potter said with a teasing smile.</p></div>
