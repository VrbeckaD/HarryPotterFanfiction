    <p>A boat appeared in the distance. A hooded figure lit an arrow on fire and shot it towards the beach. It exploded.  A second figure appeared next to the first. The first grabbed his hand and they ran towards the beach. The people on the boat noticed the explosion and sent a smaller boat towards the island. They found the two and brought them aboard.</p><p>They gave the two blankets and warm drinks. The two cuddled each other as they were taken to China. They received medical care. It was there that the doctors made a discovery.</p><p align="center">(Starling City- Merlyn Manor)</p><p>“This is Malcolm Merlyn speaking.”</p><p>“Hello sir. I am Dr. Li in Hong Kong. Oliver Queen and another has been found. When we were trying to confirm his identity we found that not only is he Oliver Queen but his DNA is a familiar match to you.”</p><p>“I see. What hospital it he at?” He was shocked.</p><p>“He is at Tung Wah hospital here in Hong Kong.” He informed the man.</p><p>“Thank you. I will bet here as soon as I can. Has his mother been informed?” He asked.</p><p>“No. He wished for us to call you and not her.” Dr. Li told him</p><p>“I see. Thank you.” He said.</p><p>“Of course sir.” They hung up.</p><p>The alpha sighed and quickly called Tommy. “Hey dad.” His son greeted.</p><p>“I'm going to be out of town for an unset amount of time.” Malcolm informed his son.</p><p>“Okay. Is everything okay?” He asked.</p><p>“No. I'll tell you when I have figured it out.” He promised.</p><p>“Alright.” He said.</p><p>“Great. Hopefully I shall see you soon. Goodbye son.” He said.</p><p>“Bye.” He hung up.</p><p>“Damn you Moira.” Malcolm said as he left.</p><hr/><p align="center">(Tommy Merlyn)</p><p>“Everything okay?” Laurel asked when he reentered the room.</p><p>“I'm not sure. He sounded angry and worried. He promised to tell me when he figured it out though.” He told her.</p><p>“I thought you and your dad weren't speaking.” She said.</p><p>After the yacht went down Laurel refused to talk to him for two years. They had a tentative relationship for a year and then for half a year they were just sex buddies. The beta only recently let the alpha date her so she was unaware that things with his dad had changed.</p><p>“We weren't but-” He cut himself off.</p><p>“But?” She urged.</p><p>“Dad contacted me after Ollie and…. Sara were declared dead.” He said.</p><p>“Oh I...I see.” Laurel said.</p><p>“He wanted to reconnect.” He told her.</p><p>“That's good.” She said.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><hr/><p align="center">(Hong Kong- Tung Wah Hospital)</p><p>“Mr. Merlyn?” Dr. Li walked up to him.</p><p>“Yes.” He confirmed.</p><p>The doctor explained Oliver's injuries. “Now usually I couldn't disclose this information since he is both an adult and an alpha but he allowed it when we informed him of your arrival.”</p><p>“I see. Has he said anything else?” He asked.</p><p>“No. He mostly talks to his omega.” He told him.</p><p>“He's bonded?” Malcolm asked in surprise.</p><p>“Yes sir.” He confirmed.</p><p>“Is the omega okay?” He asked.</p><p>“Yes. They are in here.” He said.</p><p>“Thank you.” He bowed.</p><p>“You're welcome.” He bowed back before leaving.</p><p>Malcolm entered the room. His son, which felt weird to think about, was laying on the bed. A black haired male was on top of him. Oliver was running a hand through the omega’s unruly hair.</p><p>Both turned and looked at him. They could smell his powerful alpha scent. Malcolm took a mental note that the younger male had emerald green eyes that glowed with power. The two sat up.</p><p>“Mr. Merlyn.” Oliver greeted.</p><p>“It's Malcolm, Oliver.” He wasn't going to force him to call him dad.</p><p>“Okay. Malcolm this is my omega, Harry.” The alpha introduced.</p><p>“It is nice to meet you Harry.” He said.</p><p>“It is nice to see you too Mr. Merlyn.” He said shyly.</p><p>“It is Malcolm, Harry.” He said.</p><p>Harry smiled. “Okay.”</p><p>Malcolm smiled back. “Oliver the doctor said that only I have been informed about you being found. I don't know if yours have been notified Harry.”</p><p>“My parents are dead and my relatives don't care.” He said emotionlessly.</p><p>“I see.” Malcolm forced himself to remain calm.</p><p>“Don't worry about it. I came to terms with it before I ended up on the island.” He assured his mate's father.</p><p>“Okay.” He smiled at Harry.</p><p>Harry cuddled into Oliver's side. His alpha smiled and wrapped his arms around him. Malcolm’s smile widened at the scene.</p><p>“Malcolm?” Oliver suddenly looked nervous.</p><p>“Yes Oliver?” He asked.</p><p>“After the boat went down Robert pulled me onto a life raft. He told me he failed the city and…” He trailed off not sure how to continue.</p><p>“And what?” He asked in confusion.</p><p>“He told me he had been unfaithful to mom on multiple occasions so she also cheated. Two of those occasions she took advantage of you being an unbound alpha. She used her heat against you. Both times she became pregnant.” Malcolm was shocked as he realized what Oliver was saying. “He told me Thea and myself were your pups and not his. He then shot himself so that I may live.”</p><p>“Thea is also mine?” He asked.</p><p>“Yes. Robert had found out before the yacht and was going to tell me during the trip.” He said.</p><p>“I see.” The alpha closed his eyes.</p><p>“I wanted to tell you now before my mom found out and stopped me.” He said.</p><p>“Thank you.” He opened them and looked at his son.</p><p>“You have every right to know. Robert was planning on telling you after but first he had wanted to tell me.” He said.</p><p>Malcolm was relieved to hear that his friend was going to tell him. “I would like to tell Tommy and Thea. After you were presumed dead I reconnected with Tommy.”</p><p>“Of course. I was planning on telling them. I'm glad you and Tommy have reconciled.” Oliver said.</p><p>“Me too.” He said.</p><p>“We should do that together.” The blonde said.</p><p>“So do I. But first you should reunite with your family.” He told his son.</p><p>“Alright.” He said.</p><p>“Now let's see about getting you transferred.” Malcolm said.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><hr/><p align="center">(Starling City General Hospital)</p><p>“Oliver.” His mom said before hugging him.</p><p>“Hey mom.” He greeted.</p><p>“You're alive.” She said.</p><p>“I am.” He smiled at her.</p><p>Moira noticed the other male in the room. Her son smiled at him and motioned him over. Once he was beside Oliver, her son wrapped his arms around the other man. She didn't like it at all. She would do a background check on him and if she didn't like what she found then she would get her son free of the gold digger.</p><p>“Mom this is Harry, my omega.” Oliver introduced.</p><p>She forced a smile. “Hello.”</p><p>“It is a pleasure to meet my alpha’s mom.” He could see that the smile was forced.</p><p>“Likewise.” She lied.</p><p>“Harry ended up on the same island as me.” He too could see how fake his mom was being.</p><p>“I see.” She still didn't like it and still believed he was a gold digger.</p><p>“I'm going to make sure we have everything.” Harry said before kissing Oliver's cheek and going to do so.</p><p>“Okay.” He said in fond amusement.</p><p>“Let's get you home.” His mom said.</p><p>“Alright.” Oliver said.</p>
