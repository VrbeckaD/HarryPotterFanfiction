    <p>Draco Malfoy sat up on the white marble floor of what seemed like the King's Cross Station. He looked around, but there was no one. He frowned as he thought back to what happened.</p>
<p>It has been ten years after the Final Battle of Hogwarts. The Dark Lord won the battle and the Boy – Who – Lived was severely injured and many of the light side lost their lives. The remaining light siders went into hiding. With occasional attacks here and there against the Death Eaters, they tried to raid the numbers which probed to be futile. On one such attack, Harry Potter was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange. And thus ended the hope of the Wizarding world. Their numbers decreased rapidly. Until it was only Five left on the light side. Kingley Shacklebolt, George Weasley, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy and Neville Longbottom. And as a final stand, they attacked Hogwarts, where it all started. And they fell with dignity.</p>
<p>And now Draco was looking around the very clean, almost empty Kings Cross Station. Did he mention almost empty? Yes, it was almost empty, age for himself and... is that Granger?</p>
<p>As the feminine figure made its way nearer and nearer, he was certain it was Hermione Granger. And only did he dare open his mouth, "Granger?"</p>
<p>As soon as he said the words, the girl in question started running towards him. And he was standing prepared for her onslaught of a hug, that even after ten years, made him uneasy. And she did not disappoint him. She did hug him with that same intensity. Had he been alive he would have died on suffocation.</p>
<p>"Malfoy " she said and stepped away from him. "Do you know what place is this?"</p>
<p>Draco grimaced and said, "No idea"</p>
<p>Hermione sighed and said, "Then there's of only one way to find out "</p>
<p>Draco nodded and held out his hand, "Shall we?" he smirked.</p>
<p>And together they started toward the direction from which Hermione came. Both with different things in their mind as they ventured through the endless white area. As they continued walking, Hermione clutched his arm and squeezed it silently asking him to stop. Draco turned toward her and asked, "What?"</p>
<p>"Do you remember the final battle ten years ago? " she asked.</p>
<p>Draco frowned, "Yes. What of it?"</p>
<p>Hermione swollen hard and said, "Do you remember the time Harry went to the Forbidden Forest to face Vole mort alone?"</p>
<p>Draco nodded.</p>
<p>"Well, Harry did die for a time period. When I asked him after the battle about it, he said that he saw Dumbledore at very clean and very white King's Cross Station. And he also said that Dumbledore said that he was in a limbo between the Other side and the living plane. Do you think that is where we are?" Hermione asked.</p>
<p>Draco frowned thoughtfully and said, "It could be. But if that is where we are, who do you think we are going to meet?"</p>
<p>Hermione shrugged.</p>
<p>But the answer came from an unlikely source, "That would be us"</p>
<p>Hermione and Draco whirled around to see two men standing in very old fashioned clothes. One with Green and silver robes and other with red and gold robes. Both had shoulder length brown hair. The man with the green and silver robes had grey eyes while the man with gold Andrew robes had brown eyes. Both carried themselves with aristocratic manner, which Draco recognizer rather well. After all he was raised the same way.</p>
<p>Draco stepped before Hermione instinctively and she stepped away and stood beside him daringly. Draco frowned at her. She glared back as if she was defying him.</p>
<p>Someone cleared their throat.</p>
<p>Hermione and Draco turned toward the sound and met with two smirks. Both from the newcomers of course.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" Hermione asked.</p>
<p>The man in red and gold robes said, "I am Godric Gryffindor and my friend here is Salazar Slytherine" he gestured toward the man in green and silver robes.</p>
<p>The brunette and the blonde blinked as if trying to decide if it's some kind of trick. But unfortunately it was not. "Okay" the brunette said tentatively. "What are we doing here?"</p>
<p>Salazar smiled and said, "We shall tell you later, Miss Granger. But tell me one thing, both of you, if you are given a second chance to do things right, will you take it?"</p>
<p>Hermione and Draco looked at each other and communicated through their eyes. They nodded at each other and turned toward the one half of the founders. "We will"</p>
<p>Godric said, "Not so hasty. If you are going to do this, you will have to sacrifice not only your name, but also your friends, family, identity and everything you know and did so far. Are you ready to do that? "</p>
<p>But they looked at them determinately and said, " Yes"</p>
<p>Godric and Salazar looked at each other and said, "Then we are going to send you back in time. You will remember everything that happened in your previous life and it will help you to accomplish your tasks. If all went well, you will live the rest of your lives in that time. Are you ready to do the sacrifice? "</p>
<p>Draco and Hermione nodded.</p>
<p>"Then we shall send you back. Your task is to make sure the things did not go wrong as they did first" Godric said.</p>
<p>Salazar stepped forward and said, " If I may I have a personal request"</p>
<p>When they nodded, he said, "Please prove the world that not all the Slytherines are bad people. If you can change their view."</p>
<p>Hermione nodded while Draco said, "I shall do all I can"</p>
<p>"Then it is time for you to go" Salazar said.</p>
<p>The next moment Hermione and Draco faded.</p>
<p>                                        ...............................................................................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Draco sat up abruptly from his bed. He felt different. He looked at his hands only to realise that they were shorter, like a ten year old's. He climbed down the bed and went toward his vanity mirror. What he saw shocked him completely.</p>
<p>His eyes were the same cold grey. But his hair, his platinum blonde hair was now a darker shade of blonde, with a tinge of dark brown, like his mother's. His hair could pass for brownish black, if one did not get a second look.</p>
<p>And to his horror he heard, "Draco Arcturus Black" from somewhere outside his closed door, "What are you doing still in bed?"</p>
<p>And then, Draco fainted.</p>
