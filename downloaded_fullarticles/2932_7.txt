    <p>B-A-B-Y, Baby?</p>
<p>Prologue </p>
<p>Doc was sitting on the most uncomfortable chair, hard and pokey in all the wrong places. The table he was leaning on was rusty and cold. And Doc was in the foulest mood. Not because of the fantastic decor (thought that may have been a factor.) No, he was grumpy cause he was staring right at the gleeful smirk of the little crooks face. God, he hated him. The smug air around him just wanted to make Doc throw up.<br/>
“So, if I do this, there’s no more stupid ‘favours’. No more ‘life-debts’.” Doc clarified.<br/>
The boy opposite  him lips curled even wider. “Sure.”<br/>
Doc wanted to punch him right in his pretty face.<br/>
“And no word that it was my team that did this.” Doc said through gritted teeth. The kid just smiled at  Doc’s frustrations. He got up.<br/>
“I want you to know that I respect you very much.” He said while adjusting his stupid velvet jacket. While fixing his sleeves Doc caught sight of a tattoo that looked different to the rest of other tattoos that he owned, but it was too dark to make out the details.<br/>
“Get the fuck out.” Doc said with venom. The boy wasn’t fazed and merely chuckled.<br/>
“Suit yourself.” He started walking towards the exit. Before he exited he yelled, “Remember. 10 o’clock sharp, Doc.”<br/>
“Sure.” Said Doc quietly, head in his hands.<br/>
“I’m sorry Doc, in my elder years my ears are getting a little rusty could you-”<br/>
“I’LL HAVE THE FUCKING TEAM, PRINCE! NOW GET THE FUCK OUT!”<br/>
Prince chuckled softly to himself and left the room, slamming the door behind him.</p>
