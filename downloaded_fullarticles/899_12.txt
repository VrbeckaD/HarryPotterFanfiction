  <span>"I'll be there soon. I promise." The alpha told his two omegas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay." Oliver hugged him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We understand." Harry joined in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slade tightened his arms around the two. "Good. I hate that I have to go."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Us too but you'll join us soon." Oliver said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know. You two take care of yourself and each other." He said sternly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We will." Harry nuzzled his alpha's chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good." He kissed the both.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Just don't kill anyone in Australia." Oliver said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I make no promises Oliver." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slade had belonged to the Australian army. He had been on a mission with his partner when their plane crashed. They were stranded on the island without a way to contact their bosses. They had been presumed dead. Hearing that Slade was alive they assumed he would return to them. They weren't too happy when he told them that he and his omegas were going to America. They refused to discharge him and threatened to arrest him so he was going there first. He was going to get them to understand what was going to happen. Whether they liked it or not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Worth a try." Oliver said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Indeed." The alpha smirked at him. "Bye you two."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Bye." Harry said as he cuddled into Oliver.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Bye." Oliver cuddled Harry back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll hopefully see you both soon." He left after he kissed them both one more time.</span>

  <span>(Starling Hospital)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oliver?" A woman breathed out after walking into the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mom." The minute he turned around she hugged him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Your home. Oh my boy is home." The omega woman said into his chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am." He said as he hugged her back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I've missed you." She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I missed you too." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can't believe it." It felt like one of her dreams.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Believe it." He said. "Mom?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes?" She enders the hug and looked at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I would like for you to meet my bondmate Harry Potter." He introduced Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Bondmate?" Moira asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes. Our alpha is in Australia." Oliver explained the situation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I see. It's nice to meet you Harry." She shook Harry's hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's nice to meet you as well Mrs. Queen." He greeted her politely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Call me Moira." She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Moira." Harry smiled at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you ready to come home?" The omega asked her son.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am mom." He answered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Great. Are you ready Harry?" She asked him next.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes." He said shyly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wonderful." She smiled. "I'll get the car ready while you both change." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes ma'am." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's Moira." She reminded Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes Moira." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She left and the two changed out of the hospital garb. Oliver put on a black button up and faded jeans. Harry put on an emerald green Mandarin collar tank top. There was a black dragon on it. He put on blue jeans and a white hoodie. It belonged to Slade. The two put on black shoes before grabbing their things. After that they signed the discharge papers and left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The car ride was long. Harry up into Oliver's side. He fell asleep. He never was one to get a good night's rest when in the hospital. His mate wrapped an arm around him and let him sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is he okay?" His mom asked in concern.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It is." He smiled fondly at his sleeping mate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"When will his family arrive?" She asked so that she could have the rooms prepared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He doesn't have one." He lied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh." She felt for the young omega.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't worry about it mom." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So who's your new alpha?" He asked knowing that she might not tell him if she thought it would hurt him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What?" She looked at him in shock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can smell him." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh. It's Walter Steele." She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Who?" Oliver asked in confusion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He was a friend of your father. He was there for me after…" Moira trailed off. "Anyway we fell in love. He is the CEO of the company."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is he taking care of you and Thea?" He asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good." Oliver smiled. "I was worried that you and Thea would be mourning over Dad and I and not actually living. I was afraid you both wouldn't be happy."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You were?" She asked a little surprised.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course. Despite being a pain I love you both. I never wanted you two to be miserable." He still remembered how Malcolm Merlyn was after his wife's death.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's good to hear. I was afraid you would be upset that I moved on from your father." She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not at all." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thanks Oliver." Moira said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're welcome."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We're home." She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh okay." He turned to Harry. "Time to wake up." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay." He sat up and rubbed his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Feel better?" He kissed his lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good. Come on." He exited the car and Harry followed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked to the trunk and grabbed their things. The two entered the house. All tall alpha greeted them. Oliver realized the man was Walter Steele, his mom's new alpha and husband.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's damn good to see you again Oliver." The man said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Your Walter?" He asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thank you for taking care of my mom and sister." He said with a bow of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Walter returned the head bow. "You're welcome."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oliver caught sight of another person. It was of a woman who helped to raise him and looked after him as a kid. He walked over to her. Harry followed behind. The blonde omega hugged her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I missed you Raisa." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I missed you too." She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This is my bondmate Harry." He introduced him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Pleasure to meet you." Raisa said before looking around. "Where is your alpha?" She asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Back in Australia." He told her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh. Well then I shall go make sure your room is ready for both you and your mates." She said </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thank you." The two said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're both welcome." She said with a smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Raise left the room and went upstairs. Oliver turned when he heard a noise. He saw that it was his sister. She was at the top of the stairs. Thea practically flew down the steps and hugged the omega. He hugged her back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I knew you were alive." She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You were right." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I missed you." She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Me too. You were always on my mind." Oliver told her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Um Ollie?" She backed out of the hug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes?" He looked at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Who's this?" She asked pointed at the black haired omega.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh sorry. Thea, I would like you to meet my bondmate Harry Potter." He put an arm around the other omega.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's nice to meet you Thea." Harry politely greeted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Um you too." She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oliver used to talk about you." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Used to?" She asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yup."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why did he stop?" She asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gave her a happy smile. "We were found."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh. That's a good reason." She said not knowing what else to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes it is." The smile never left his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We should unpack." Oliver said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're right." Harry said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"See you all at dinner." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two omegas went upstairs. Thea looked at her mom in confusion. She never heard of bondmates and she never heard of two omegas bonding. It was always alphas and omegas bonding or and alpha, beta, omega bonding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't understand. How can two omegas bond?" She asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It is rare but an alpha bonds with two omegas. It is the only way." Walter told her. "It is rare because usually the two omegas become jealous of each other. In some cases an alpha will get jealous of one of the omegas. It is why alpha, beta, and omega pairings are uncommon. They work better than the other because usually the beta can balance them out and there is no competing between dynamics." He explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh." That made sense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"As you know Oliver wasn't alone. Harry and his alpha had also been there. They bonded before they were found. Slade, their alpha, is currently in Australia." Moira told her daughter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why?" She asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He's getting discharged. He was in the army before he ended up on the island." She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Raisa?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes ma'am?" The woman looked at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Inform the chef that Harry is allergic to peanuts." She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes ma'am." She left to go do so.</span>
</p><hr/><p align="center">
  <span>(With Harry and Oliver)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This is your room?" Harry asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wow." He said. 'This is huge.' He thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You okay?" He asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah." He was happy that Oliver cared so much about him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two unpack their things. This was the first time Harry had put his clothes in a closet and dresser. Even before the island he didn't have one. He put the few clothes he had on the floor. It was nice he decided. After they were done they took a quick shower. They were tired due to the shift in time zone. Harry really was because he couldn't sleep in the hospital. They hoped a shower would help.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Will this be okay?" Harry had gotten dressed afterwards and showed his clothes to his fellow omega.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wore a black long sleeve shirt and grey sweatpants. White socks and black sneakers adorned his feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It is." He kissed him. "Don't worry about your clothes. They aren't your parents." He told him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"A-are you sure?" He bit his lip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am." Oliver said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay." He snuggled into Harry. "I love you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I love you too."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two separated and went downstairs. Oliver couldn't wait to meet Harry's parents. He was going to make them pay. Slade was going to torture them before they died. He had every legal right to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ollie?" Said omega blinked. "You okay there?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. Sorry just thinking." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Slade will be shocked." He teased.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oliver glared. "Ouch."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry giggled. Sorry. I couldn't help myself."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thanks a lot." He dropped his glare and pouted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're welcome." He kissed Oliver's cheek.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oliver?" The two turned to see a dark haired beta standing in the doorway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey Tommy." Oliver grinned at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey." The two hugged. "Man I missed you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Missed you too." He released Tommy. "I would like for you to meet my bondmate Harry Potter."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nice to meet you." He said as he shook Harry's hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You too." The omega said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Um where is your alpha?" He asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Australia. He is getting discharged from the army." Harry said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. Now let's go eat." Oliver said. "I'm hungry."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Me too." Harry said before his stomach growled. "See."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They laughed at that. When they calmed down they walked into the dining room. Oliver hoped this meant the two got along. Harry sat down between the two and began eating. He was silent as Tommy babbled about all the things Oliver missed. It was nice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>'Only thing better would be if Slade was here.' He thought happily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What was it like there?" Thea asked causing everyone to freeze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Cold." Oliver answered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry didn't say anything. He put a comforting hand on his mate's. Oliver gave him a smile. He turned back to give the new alpha and his mom a test.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So I planned on going into the office tomorrow." He told them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't think you should worry about that right now." Walter said. "We were too that you would!d need to adjust to being back and I fear the workers would cling to you." He explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oliver nodded. "Okay." He seemed genuinely worried about his safety and didn't seem to be hiding anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I was planning on taking you around the city." Tommy said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sounds like a great plan." Oliver said with a smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What about Harry?" Thea asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm planning on making the bedroom my own." Raisa had left basic untouched blankets in there for the moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh I see." She said. As an alpha she wasn't too familiar with omega instincts and routines.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Raisa had slipped. Her and the bowl of fruit she had been carrying started to fall. Oliver was quick to catch her and the bowl. Almost everyone looked at him when he spoke in Russian. He had done it unconsciously when he asked if she was okay.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I didn't know you took Russian in college." Walter said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I didn't. Slade knows many languages and he taught Harry and I." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh I see." He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the meal was silent. Afterwards Oliver and Tommy finalized their plans for the next day. When they finished the beta went home and the omegas talked to their alpha. They then went to bed.</span>
