    <p>When Harry returns home after a trip to St. Mungo’s, he overhears his one of his lovers speaking ill about him</p><p>“He is a slut, Severus! Don’t you <em>dare </em>deny it!” Draco Malfoy sneers fiercely. His voice pings off the walls of the large kitchen, and it gives it a hollow ring.</p><p>Harry moves closer, tears stinging his eyes.</p><p>Under different circumstances, Harry would not at all be opposed to being called a slut. In the past, he had once stood tall upon hearing the slur thrown at him. Either it is his past lovers or the gossip columns in the papers. He hadn’t flinched. In fact, he went out of his way to roll his eyes or outright laugh. It had been the truth after all, why deny it?</p><p>But hearing the degrading words fly out of Malfoy mouth with a tone of <em>utter disgust</em> and <em>loathing</em>?</p><p>It is crippling.</p><p>Just yesterday Harry had thought he and Draco had finally put their differences aside. They had talked. In for once, it didn’t quickly roll into an argument about pointless and petty shit. They hadn’t been trying to tear the other down with words, holding every slight against one another. Draco had joked and laugh. Hell, Harry had laughed and joked right back.</p><p>Things had been good. Really good. So much so that Harry finally pushed down his own insecurity and fear enough to set an appointment. To confirm something that he has been dreading and keeping secret for <em>weeks</em> now. </p><p>Harry leans heavily against the wall, clenching at his chest with a trembling fist. His heart feels like it’s trying to beat around a jagged dagger (The wound opens freshly around it, but there is already another scar there). He doesn’t know why this hurts so much. Malfoy and he hadn’t grown close until very recent. For them, it had just been pure lust and sexual attraction, fueled by their past.</p><p>Maybe that was it.</p><p>How many times had Harry, Severus, and Malfoy had sex now? Enough times to not be able to count using both of his hands. Enough times that Harry clothes and things can found scattered around the house. Enough times that he had been asked to move in. To “Stay a while.”</p><p>Malfoy often called him a slut when they were in the middle of sex, rucking up the expensive sheets. The tone was completely different from the one he is using now. Malfoy had sounded impressed then, even a little awed.</p><p>Severus used the term as well, and Harry even dared to think he sounded <em>fond</em>.</p><p>Harry started to calm down, and he thought to reveal himself to Malfoy. To dare the snotty blond to say the words to his face.</p><p>Malfoy wasn’t done, though. He seems determined to speak his piece.</p><p>“He was just supposed to be a fuck toy, Severus. It was never meant to be more than that. He wasn’t supposed to be <em>permanent</em>!” The words come out wobbled but hard.</p><p>Harry bites into his lip until he tastes blood. Draco last words ring into his ears and shatter all the meager confidence he had gathered around himself just for this day. He had sworn he would be brave. That he would take a chance. He would take a risk.</p><p>He thought Severus was worth it. The thought <em>fucking</em> Draco <em>Bloody</em> Malfoy was worth it.</p><p>Harry wipes away the tears with his too big hands, trembling on the spot.</p><p>Severus still remains silent. Harry chances a peek into the kitchen. Malfoy is standing with his back towards him, fist clenched tight to his side with a bent back. The table with a half finish cup of tea and mug filled with cold coffee rests between the two. Severus stands on the other side of the kitchen, facing Harry, but his hands are messaging his temples and his eyes are squeezed shut.</p><p>Both of them are clearly distressed, but Harry doesn’t register this. He sees how charged the air is, and how Severus is <em>still quiet</em>.</p><p>“Do you actually think he will stay? That he will <em>want</em> too? Potter has been going strong alone for <em>years</em> now. In fact, I bet he isn’t even at an ‘appointment’. He is probably hooking up with a new slag, bored already after <em>five fucking months!</em>” Draco shouts the last words, his voice cracking from the volume of it.</p><p>The teacup goes flying, smashing against the floor after Draco take a swing at it.</p><p>Harry flinches at the sound and ducks back around just as Severus looks up.</p><p>“Draco.” Severus finally speaks. He sounds weird. There wasn’t an ounce of scorn in his tone. None. Harry has never heard him like that. Never knew he could speak like that. So soft but stern. He sounded concerned. Like he <em>cared</em>.</p><p>Harry looks down at his too big hands. They clutch at his stomach without his say. He tries to urge himself to drop them, but they don’t budge. He is trembling. He can’t stop trembling.</p><p>Malfoy had just accused him of cheating. Of going behind their back. He should storm into the kitchen and set things right, tell them the truth. Maybe Malfoy would <em>stop talking </em>if Harry just speaks up. No one else was going to do it. No one was here to do it but him.</p><p>Malfoy had been getting in fowl strops more frequently as of late. Maybe this was him just letting off steam. Harry doesn’t know why he is trying to defend Malfoy. The fucker who just accused him of having a short attention span and <em>cheating</em>. </p><p>“<em>No</em>, Severus.” Malfoy sounds like he is crying. “Do you hear me? I said<em> no.</em>”</p><p>Harry starts to come down a bit. He is still trembling, but his heart is no longer lodged in his throat. The dagger is still present, but it hurt a little less. Only a little.</p><p>He knows its Malfoy’s voice. Hearing it so distraught and uneven gives him pause.</p><p>But Malfoy, once again, is not finished.</p><p>“It’s either Potter or me.”</p><p>Harry's heart leaps back into his throat, and the jagged dagger begins to turn.</p><p>“Draco,” Severus Snape <em>implores</em>.</p><p>Harry shakes his head, his hands come up to cover his ears.</p><p>“<strong>Choose</strong>!” Draco Malfoy’s snarled voice comes through, even muffled.</p><p>“Draco just listen. You aren’t thinking things through. We can put the other subject on pause until you are calmer and more reasonable.” Severus is trying to plead with him.</p><p>“<em>Pause</em>!? Fuck you!” Malfoy isn’t having it.</p><p>“Harry will be back soon. Why don’t you go out, get some fresh air? Call your mother. Talk to her. Or even Parkinson. Just calm down.” Severus isn’t giving up.</p><p>“Severus,” Malfoy voice is calm now, hoarse from all the screaming, but eerily calm.</p><p>Harry slowly uncover his ears and turns with watery eyes to the opening of the kitchen. He edges a little closer, tempted to get another peek.</p><p>There is a moment of silence. Harry holds his breath.</p><p>“Severus,” Malfoy says again, still calm, “If I leave, I’m <em>not </em>coming back.”</p><p>It’s an ultimatum.</p><p>Harry freezes on the spot.</p><p>
  <em>“Harry,” Ginny begins calmly, looking him dead in the eyes, “I will overlook this, but just once.” </em>
</p><p>Harry stops trembling. He arms fall limply to his side. He stares straight ahead with blank eyes.</p><p>
  <em>“Promise me, Harry. Promise me that you will stop. That you won’t do this again.” </em>
</p><p>Harry had made the promise. After all, Ginny had also given him an ultimatum.</p><p><em>“Or else I will leave</em>, <em>and <strong>never</strong> come back.”</em></p><p>Harry really thought he could keep that promise. For Ginny, his first love. For himself. He promised her.</p><p>“No, Draco, NO.” Severus isn’t pleading anymore.</p><p>Numbly, Harry steps forward and peek around into the kitchen. Severus grips Malfoy hard by the arms, shaking him a little as he shakes his own head in denial.</p><p>He can’t help but stare. To be a little in awe.</p><p>Because Severus Snape is<em> crying</em>.</p><p>Malfoy looks up, and the expression on his face stops Severus cold.</p><p>“<em>Choose.</em>”</p><p>Harry is starting up the stairs before he realized he moved. One hand is over his mouth while the other clutches at his rolling stomach.</p><p>“Who is it going to be?” Malfoy questions almost serenely.</p><p>His feet hit the hardwood but don’t make a sound. Severus Potion lab was underneath them. The stairs had been spelled quiet so neither Malfoy or Harry could distract him when they used them.</p><p>“Me or Potter?”</p><p>He doesn’t want to cry again. He doesn’t want to be hurt again.</p><p>“You can only pick one. You can only have <em>one</em>.” Malfoy voice is melodic.</p><p>Harry is halfway up the stairs when he hears Severus answer.</p><p>“You.”</p><p>Harry's knees give out and he falls. He dry heaves on the stairs. His throat burns, but his stomach is determined to purge itself. Even if there is nothing to purge.</p><p>Harry hadn’t eaten anything today. He had been too nervous, and his stomach had already been rolling dangerously the moment he woke up beside Malfoy. He had instead got up and cooked breakfast for Severus and Malfoy. He left them a note. Telling them where he would be at in the morning.</p><p>He eventually stops retching. He wipes his mouth and pulls out his wand with trembling, numb fingers. He vanishes the spittle on the stairs.  </p><p>“I choose you Draco.”</p><p>Harry closes his eyes and just sits there. He takes into count what was confirmed earlier today. He thinks about this new turn of events, and his past, his future. He can’t see far ahead. Not with his world ripped to shreds and broken. But he can try.</p><p>This isn’t the first time after all. </p><p>Harry has been through this before.</p><p>With Ginny.</p><p>The woman who broke his heart. Who broke him.</p><p>Harry recovered from that in the end, didn’t he?</p><p>When everything was raw, and he had been abandoned and left forgotten, he had thought the pain would be never-ending. That he would always feel this way.</p><p>He knows better now.</p><p>Time didn’t heal his wounds. Not by any means.</p><p>But it helps them become more bearable.</p><p>Harry gets up.</p><p>Malfoy made his voice known.</p><p>Snape made his choice.</p><p>Now it was just time for Harry to give up and move on. He no longer just had himself to think about.</p><p>With a hand cradling his still flat stomach, Harry continues his journey up the stairs. He doesn’t acknowledge the fact that he is still trembling, and that the dagger in his chest seems to jostle at every step he takes.</p><p>He continues on into their bedroom and summons his bag.</p><p>Harry hadn’t brought much.</p><p>Being a live-in lover had been an impulse. He had agreed without giving it any real thought. That’s why he only brought a single bag when he ‘moved’ in.</p><p>He had been cautious and skeptical, but still willing to give it a shot back then.</p><p>How easy it had been to through that all away once he was given hope.</p><p>But no more.</p><p>Malfoy made sure of it.</p><p>Harry doesn’t bother to wonder about the fact that in the thirty minutes it takes to pack up, neither Snape or Malfoy leave the kitchen.</p><p>The library on the second floor has its own floo. He has no reason to walk down to the first floor and use the one in the den. None.</p><p>Still, Harry stands for an additional five minutes in front of the floo on the second floor, fighting with himself.</p><p>In the end, he turns away and just leaves.</p>
