          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry woke up all of a sudden as soon as the baby started crying. He sprang from his armchair in no time and took the baby in his arms. Draco was asleep this time. </p><p> «Hey, toddler,» he said with a tired smile,«is it time for a change already?»<br/>
Harry took a look inside Teddy's diaper.<br/>
«Yikes! How come something as tiny as you can produce such an amount of dirty diapers?», he asked the boy while he changed him.<br/>
Little Teddy laughed sweetly.<br/>
«Good morning,» Draco said, looking at the scene from the door frame. His voice had a just-woken-up vibe to it and there was a little smile on his face.<br/>
«It’s 3 am,» said Harry, who kept Teddy in his arms, rocking him slowly. «You can go back to bed, dear.»<br/>
«For what? Three more hours? I’d rather not, thanks!», said Draco.<br/>
«I thought you were tired just 4 hours ago...»<br/>
«I don't want to sleep… Not on my own, at least.»<br/>
There it was. The reason Draco Malfoy wasn't sound asleep at 3 am: the lack of company in bed. Nightmares about the war were too vivid in his head — the kind that woke him up drenched in sweat.<br/>
«Teddy had a nightmare, too,» said Harry, smiling sweetly while he put him back on his crib.</p><p>«Am I a joke to you, Potter?» Draco asked, with a serious tone in his voice, while the two of them drank Earl Grey tea in elegant silver cups.<br/>
«Don’t you know the answer already?», Harry teased  as he put his empty cup down. The cup refilled by itself as soon as it reached its matching little silver plate.<br/>
«Am I a joke, Harry Potter?! Answer me!» Draco's voice, which he expected to sound<br/>
demanding, came out broken.<br/>
«Well, I’m genuinely impressed right now,» was all Harry said, followed by a little laugh.<br/>
«What kind of answer is that?!»<br/>
«The truth?»<br/>
«It has been three nights since the last time we...cuddled,» said Draco, sadly.<br/>
«Are you serious, Malfoy?» asked Harry, with a smile on his face. «Are you jealous of my one-and-a-half-year-old godson?»<br/>
«He’s an attention whore, Harry! He's manipulating you!»<br/>
«The only whore I know is sitting in front of me right now!»<br/>
Draco blushed, his cheeks turning crimson.<br/>
«I am no whore, Harry!», he retorted.<br/>
Harry Potter grinned mischievously.<br/>
«We'll see that, babe. The night is still young...»</p></div>
