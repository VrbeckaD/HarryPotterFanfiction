    <p>Have you ever felt insignificant; as though everything you've ever done is meaningless, having no impact and doing neither good nor ill? Have you ever felt that lurking hollowness in your chest as you reminisce on a past that only serves to be forgotten - memories that will love and die with you?</p><p> </p><p>That was what came over her as she lay in bed, the fading light of dusk creeping in through her cracked window like a quiet criminal of sickly moonlight. Her chest grew heavy and her breaths grew laboured as her mind continued to spin, flitting between tainted memories and heartbreaking echoes of a future she now knew would never come.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>She wasn't the same person as she had been all those years ago, when she'd dreamt so fondly of what was to come. No: her eyes were darker, half sunken into their sockets, having ong since list the innocent spark of youth; her lips were pulled down, thin and taut in a line that spoke only of apathy to hide the screams of guilt and anger that hid behind her silenced tongue; her frame was weary, aching and old, frail and cold yet still holding the facade of her schoool days. However much she denied it or tried to avoid the truth, <em>she had changed</em> - and <em>he</em> was the one that changed her.</p><p> </p><p>Twenty long years of standing by his side as he grew and bettered his skills in both regular magic and the dark arts. Twenty long years of advising him, teaching him and helping him rise where he had once fallen. Twenty long years of falling in love with someone she now knew she should have stayed far far away from. Twenty long years of spiralling deeper and deeper into the dark, twisted world of Tom Marvolo Riddle; the boy, now man, who had ruthelessly stolen her heart and dangled it over her head since the moment they started courting (<em>to call it dating would be an exaggeration, in her eyes</em>).</p><p> </p><p>Twenty long years and nothing had come of it. <em>Not for <strong>her</strong>. Not for <strong>them</strong></em>. <strong><em>Not at all</em></strong>. It were as though the last two decades had passed in the painful blink of the eye and may as well have not happened at all, aside from the lasting impact they'd had on her fragile mind.</p><p> </p><p>But this was no time to dwell upon such things (<em>though it would be laughable to presume she held a say in such matters</em>), so she instead elected to go for an impromptu walk through the gardens. It took a few moments to unwind his body from her, the whole affair feeling like the messy escape from a prison of flesh and bone, leaving with the hushed promise of a hasty return as she gathered her coat and sand before making her way outside.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>It was beautiful: the alabaster moon, a mirthful, cheshire grin half hidden behind sparse grey clouds, cast a pale light on the land below; the grass, lush and green, crunches quietly underfoot, the ocean of emerald adorned with a sparse collection of flowers, persisting from early Spring; the manor, an intimidating silhouette against the inky sky, seemed to take on a form of chatoyant glow from the windows. It was everything she had dreamed of during those long nights at Hogwarts, but in-spite of it all the calmness was ephemeral.</p><p> </p><p>How could one call it a success if countless witches and wizards died for them - for him - to live a life of luxury. It was pyrrhic; the thought that she was living with a man whose throne and influence was built upon the mass grave of her magically inclined brethren was sickening, leaving her reeling and hollow at the thought that she was in part responsible for so much pain, death and discourse amongst the young and old.</p><p> </p><p>She could feel bitter bile rising in her throat, burning her as she anxiously tugged at random strands of her (h/c) hair. This wasn't her and that wasn't the man she'd fallen in love with.</p><p> </p><p><em>Tom Riddle was dead</em>, she realised, he had died the moment he entered that ridiculous chamber all those years ago. There was no saving him, no redemption because all that she saw - the monster that whispered sweet lies and promises of change to her each night - was all that there was to him. There was only Voldemort left - no Tom. No hope.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><em>There was <strong>nothing</strong> for her; <strong>nothing</strong></em> to keep her at the manor.</p><p> </p><p>At that point she began to question whether the person she had loved - the person she'd devoted the past two decades of her life to - had ever existed, whether that had just been an act or alias to hide his true self, luring her in until she was so infatuated with him that she wouldn't leave. And twenty years ago she would have stayed. Hell, even last year she'd have brushed off such thoughts and gone back to sleep in his arms, preferring the feeling of being loved and protected as opposed to fleeing to the cold, unforgiving world outside of the manor walls.</p><p> </p><p>But she wasn't that little girl anymore; she was wise to his games and could see past his facade enough to know that all that remained was apathy and wrathful hatred. She didn't need to be protected (<em>she was a capable and powerful witch - a likely reason why he had initially pursued her</em>) and she could damn well face the world without his, or anyone's, aid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>(Y/n) took a shaky breath, allowing her eyes to gaze upon the monolithic building that she had called home for the past few years as she tightly grasped her wand in one hand. Then, she shook her head, smiling tearfully as she turned away, for the first time in recent memory walking from the manor alone, a single thought in her mind.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Leaving was the only option, because even if she had stayed, <em>nothing would come of it</em> and she couldn't go through it all again.</p>
