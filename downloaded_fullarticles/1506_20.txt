    <p class="p1">Four figure gathered in the main hall of Riddle Manor. Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan Lestrange, and Barty Crouch jr huddled together, worried. They all had felt the burning of their marks, but their master had not appeared yet. They had all heard the disturbing rumors - that the Dark Lord was dead, and a child was responsible. But if their marks burned, he must be alive.</p><p class="p1">Musn’t he?</p><p class="p1">Bellatrix, the most loyal of the foursome, had quelled any of the others doubts by reassuring them of their master’s power. But it had been almost an hour, and even she was starting to get nervous at their masters absence.</p><p class="p1">Just then, the front door burst open, bouncing off the walls. The four Death Eaters jumped, drawing their wands, before seeing who it was.</p><p class="p1">“Avery! You scared us. What on earth is going on?” Rabastan said, stowing his wand. The fifth death eater looked at him, revealing red eyes, and a familiar sibilant hiss came from his mouth.</p><p class="p1">“Avery has kindly allowed me use of his body, Rabastan. I’m sure you all have been wondering where I am?”</p><p class="p1">“My lord!”</p><p class="p1">The four death eaters fell to their knees, subservient now that they knew whose presence they were in. All were curious, but it was Bellatrix who was brave enough to speak up.</p><p class="p1">“Master, may I ask what happened? How did you come to be in Avery’s body?”</p><p class="p1">The hiss that came out of Avery’s mouth was inhuman in it’s anger, and Bellatrix flinched, sure a curse was coming her way. But to her surprise, there was only a dark laughter in response.</p><p class="p1">“You are bold, Bellatrix. Perhaps too bold. Fortunately for you, in this form I am <em>weak</em>. My body has been destroyed, but it is not so easy to defeat Lord Voldemort.”</p><p class="p1">“Forgive me, my lord.” Bellatrix muttered, bowing her head.</p><p class="p1">“The four of you are my most faithful followers, and I have chosen to bring you here because I know that you would go to Azkaban before betraying me. Would you agree?”</p><p class="p1">“Of course, my lord. We would die for you.” The response came from Rodolphus, the eldest of the lot.</p><p class="p1">“Well said. My other followers are not so devout. Even now, they are lying to the aurors, pleading the imperius curse, begging to be let out of Azkaban. But not you. I have brought you here for a purpose. Ancient blood magic has been cast upon me, magic that I was foolish not to foresee. As such, I am in a precarious position. I will only be able to inhabit Avery’s form for another few hours, before the strain kills him. What is required of you now is to create a new body for me. The world will think me dead, but I will remain here, in hiding, with you. This is only a temporary defeat, and we will rise again, more powerful than before.”</p><p class="p1">“We will do as you say, my lord.” Bellatrix said, her head bowed. “How shall we accomplish such a task?”</p><p class="p1">The dark lord laughed, a low chuckle that put the others nerves on edge.</p><p class="p1">“Worry not, dear Bella. I will tell you. But first, know that the aurors will be out for you now. The four of you, as well as Avery, will have to be in hiding for several years. You will go now, to your homes, and gather what you will require for a long stay. Lockdown your houses, then return to me.”</p><p class="p1">“Yes, my lord.”</p><p class="p1">With four <em>pops</em>, the Death Eaters disappeared, leaving the Dark Lord alone in Avery’s body. Avery sagged visibly, paling and shaking. It was difficult to possess even a willing victim at the best of times, but Voldemort was weak from his near-death experience, and though Avery was doing his best not to fight off the invading soul, animal instinct made that nearly impossible.</p><p class="p1">The dark lord staggered out of the room, and up the stairs, growing weaker and weaker as he went. By the time his followers returned, he would either have killed Avery, or have been forced out of his body. There would be just enough time to write down the instructions to create a homunculus, as well as send the letters he needed to, before then.</p><p class="p1">The Dark Lord Voldemort would not be defeated so easily.</p><p class="p2"> </p>
<hr/><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p1">The years passed. The five Death Eaters and their master remained at Riddle Manor, working diligently on creating the Dark Lords new body. Miles and miles away, a young boy lived, a boy who was prophesied to bring the Dark Lord’s downfall.</p><p class="p1">That boy was Harry James Potter.</p><p class="p1">Harry lived with his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and cousin Dudley.</p><p class="p1">He hated them, and Harry was quite sure that they hated him right back.</p><p class="p1"> When he was younger, all he wanted was for his family to love him. But Harry was seven, and considered himself quite grown up, much to old to be desperate for affection. No, it was better to just return the favor, and despise them.</p><p class="p1">He was old enough to know that the way he was treated was wrong, maybe even illegal. But Uncle Vernon’s threat of an orphanage still held weight, and Harry wasn’t completely sure that he was lying about it. No, better the evil you knew.</p><p class="p1">As old and mature the seven year old believe himself to be, he still lay in bed at night, wishing for someone to come and take him away. Maybe a long lost cousin. Maybe his relatives were lying, and his parents were really still alive, and searching for him. Not that he really believed that, but it was better to dream than give up hope.</p><p class="p1">Meanwhile, he was usually to busy to indulge in daydreaming. When he wasn’t in school, his family kept him occupied with chores. They were of the opinion that if he was doing chores, he couldn’t go out and get in trouble.</p><p class="p1">Harry disagreed. He could get in plenty of trouble doing chores. It seemed he never worked hard enough for his aunt and uncle, and always had to do things over.</p><p class="p1">Not to mention the Strange Things.</p><p class="p1">The Strange Things, or what his Uncle called his “freakishness,” were the odd things that happened to him. Like the time he turned his teacher’s hair blue when she was scolding him for something that Dudley did. Or the time his hair grew back overnight.</p><p class="p1">His family didn’t talk about the Strange Things, and Harry didn’t either. All he knew was that they happened when he was desperate, and that his family didn’t like them.</p><p class="p1">Harry thought that he would never understand the strange things that happened to him, and that he would be miserable with the Dursley’s for the rest of his life. Or until he turned eighteen, but that seemed centuries away.</p><p class="p1">At the moment, Harry was in the front yard, weeding his Aunt Petunia’s garden. It was one of his least-despised chores, because even with the sun beating down on the back of his neck, he at least had some peace and quiet. And sometimes the snake would visit him, and he could feel less lonely for a while.</p><p class="p1">He supposed that understanding snakes was another one of the Strange Things, and one that he was grateful for. The garden snakes were quite friendly, and having company that didn’t hate him was marvelous.</p><p class="p1">One of the snake was with him as he was weeding, sitting in the sun near his elbow.</p><p class="p1">
  <em>“Ssspeaker! Someone is coming. I have to hide.”</em>
</p><p class="p1">Before Harry could reply, the snake was gone, and a shadow had fallen over him. He blinked at the sudden loss of sunlight, and turned around. There was a man there, with a pale face and shaggy black hair.</p><p class="p1">“Harry? Harry Potter?”</p><p class="p1">The voice that came out of the man was hoarse and almost broken, like he was going to cry.</p><p class="p1">“Yes, sir. I’m Harry Potter. Did you need to talk to the Dursley’s? I can go get my uncle.”</p><p class="p1">The man shook his head, running a hand through his hair.</p><p class="p1">“No - well, I suppose. But Harry, I’m here for you.”</p><p class="p1">Standing, Harry brushed his dirt cover hands off on his jeans.</p><p class="p1">“Sorry, sir, but what do you mean?”</p><p class="p1">“My name is Sirius Black, and I’m your godfather.”</p><p class="p1">Harry froze, staring up at the man with wide eyes.</p><p class="p1">“My godfather? But how-“</p><p class="p1">“I’m so sorry I couldn’t come for you before, Harry. I was in Azkaban, I mean jail. I was innocent, of course, but-“</p><p class="p1">Just then, Harry’s Aunt Petunia came marching out of the house towards them.</p><p class="p1">“Get back to work!” she snapped at Harry, before turning to the man.</p><p class="p1">“How can I help you?”</p><p class="p1">The man glare at the woman for a moment, before speaking.</p><p class="p1">“I would speak a bit kinder to my godson, Petunia.”</p><p class="p1">“Who are you?” Petunia demanded, taking a step back. “Your one of <em>them</em>, aren’t you?”</p><p class="p1">“You mean a wizard? Of course. The name is Sirius Black.”</p><p class="p1">“Black! You were at Lily’s wedding, I remember now. What are you doing here?”</p><p class="p1">The man, Sirius Black, drew himself up proudly.</p><p class="p1">“I’m here because I have been awarded custody of Harry James Potter. Here, take this,” and he thrust a rolled up piece of paper at her. “The court order.”</p><p class="p1">With shaking hands, Petunia opened the odd paper, and read the contents.</p><p class="p1">“I see. Boy, go and pack your things. It looks like you’re leaving.”</p><p class="p1">Harry started at the man, then his aunt. It had happened so fast, he wasn’t quite sure that it was real.</p><p class="p1">“You mean… I get to live with you, sir?”</p><p class="p1">The man smiled at Harry, in a way the Dursley’s never did.</p><p class="p1">“That’s right, Harry. Everything is in order. Go get your things, and we’ll get out of this awful place.”</p><p class="p1">Harry stared for a moment longer, before he made up his mind, and took off toward his cupboard.</p><p class="p1">Anything would be better than the Dursley’s.</p><p class="p1">In his cupboard, Harry started throwing all of this things in a old rucksack of Dudley’s. He didn’t have many belongings, however, and soon the rucksack was full. Zipping it up, he left the cupboard for the last time, and went to stand by Sirius Black. His godfather.</p><p class="p1">“Bye, Aunt Petunia,” he said quietly, before slowly reaching to take his godfather’s hand, afraid that it was all a dream.</p><p class="p1">His aunt didn’t return his farewell, and watched in silence as the two walked away from Number Four, Privet Drive, forever.</p><p class="p1">Once they were about a block away, Harry turned up to his godfather, curious.</p><p class="p1">“Mr. Black? Were you really at my parents wedding? And what did Aunt Petunia mean when she called you a wizard?”</p><p class="p1">The man laughed.</p><p class="p1">“Please, Harry. I’m no Mr. Black. Call me Sirius, or Padfoot. As for your second question, well…”</p><p class="p1">Sirius paused, and knelt down so that he was at Harry’s height.</p><p class="p1">“Harry, that’s something that you need to know. Magic is real.”</p><p class="p1">Harry’s eyes widened, and he shook his head.</p><p class="p1">“No it’s not. Uncle Vernon says that magic is rubbish.”</p><p class="p1">Sirius chuckled a bit.</p><p class="p1">“And do you believe everything your uncle told you?”</p><p class="p1">That was a good point. Harry generally believed his uncle was a liar.</p><p class="p1">“Well, no. But magic… really?”</p><p class="p1">Sirius nodded, before glancing around, as if making certain that they were alone. He then pulled a long wooden stick from his sleeve.</p><p class="p1">“This is my wand. You’ll get one too, when you turn eleven. Watch.”</p><p class="p1">Sirius waved the wand in a complicated motion, and suddenly his hair was blond.</p><p class="p1">Harry gaped for a moment, before he started shooting out questions.</p><p class="p1">“Wow! Am I a wizard, too? Are there witches? Were my parents magical?”</p><p class="p1">Sirius laughed, turning his hair back to it’s natural color.</p><p class="p1">“Yes, yes, and yes. Now, let’s get back to my house. I’m going to do something called apparition. It’s like teleportation, I think. It’s very strange the first few time you do it, so don’t worry if you throw up after we get there, alright? It’s the best way to get around.”</p><p class="p1">At this, Harry was rather frightened.</p><p class="p1">“It’s safe, right?”</p><p class="p1">“Of course, Harry! I’m an expert at this. Now come here.”</p><p class="p1">Sirius wrapped his arms around Harry, who awkwardly stood still and silent. He had never gotten a hug before, and he didn’t quite know how to respond.</p><p class="p1">All of a sudden, the world blurred around them, and the started spinning. Holding on for dear life, Harry clutched Sirius, closing his eyes tightly.</p><p class="p1">Just as quickly as it had started, the spinning stopped. Harry held on to Sirius for a long moment, breathing heavily and trying to suppress the urge to vomit.</p><p class="p1">“You okay, Harry?”</p><p class="p1">Slowly, Harry let go of Sirius, shakily looking up at him.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, I’m okay. Where are we?”</p><p class="p1">“My flat. It’s kind of small, but you’ll have a room all to yourself.”</p><p class="p1">Harry looked up at his godfather, a wide grin on his face, the trauma of apparating forgotten.</p><p class="p1">“I get my own room?”</p><p class="p1">“Sure, kid! What did you think, that I was going to have you sleep in the cupboard?”</p><p class="p1">Harry went silent at this, looking down at his worn sneakers.</p><p class="p1">“No… you mean those <em>muggles</em> made you sleep in a cupboard?”</p><p class="p1">Harry nodded slowly, not looking up. Here it came. Now that his godfather knew what a freak he was, that would be it. He would be shipped back to the Dursley’s, and his hope for a better life would be gone.</p><p class="p1">“This <em>bastards</em>! How could they? Treating my godson - James and Lily’s son - like that!”</p><p class="p1">It would seem that Sirius was quite on his way to a good rant, and he would have continued, possibly with a great deal more swearing. However, he took a moment to actually look down at his godson, and he stopped immediately.</p><p class="p1">Harry had lowered his head, and was visibly shaking.</p><p class="p1">Sirius knelt down, frowning.</p><p class="p1">“Hey. Hey, Harry. It’s okay. I’m not mad at you, alright? I’m mad at the Dursley’s for treating you that way.”</p><p class="p1">He reached forward and gently took Harry by the chin, tilting his head up so that he was looking Sirius in the eye.</p><p class="p1">“Are you okay?”</p><p class="p1">Harry nodded.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah. I just… I got scared that you were going to take me back.”</p><p class="p1">“No, Harry, You’re my godson. I might have been a bit late, but every day I was in prison I thought about coming to get you. I love you, Harry, and I’m never going to let anything happen to you.”</p><p class="p1">Harry gave Sirius a tremulous smile.</p><p class="p1">“Really?”</p><p class="p1">“Really really.”</p><p class="p1">Harry darted forward, wrapping his arms around his godfather tightly.”</p><p class="p1">“Thank you, Sirius.”</p><p class="p2"> </p>
<hr/><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p1">Later that night, when Harry was fast asleep in his new bed, Sirius sat in his study, nursing a glass of firewhiskey, lost in thought. When the fire turned green, and a man stepped out of it, he didn’t even notice.</p><p class="p1">“Sirius? Are you alright?”</p><p class="p1">“What? Oh, Remus. I didn’t notice you floo in. Yeah, I’m fine.”</p><p class="p1">Pouring himself a glass of firewhiskey, Remus perched on the arm of Sirius’ chair, running his fingers through the shaggy black hair.</p><p class="p1">“Is Harry alright?”</p><p class="p1">“Hmm? Yeah, he’s alright. Sleeping.”</p><p class="p1">Rolling his eyes, Remus tugged gently on Sirius’ hair.</p><p class="p1">“Sirius. What’s the matter? I thought you’d be over the moon about having Harry again.”</p><p class="p1">Sirius seemed to wake from a daze.</p><p class="p1">“Oh, I am, I am! I just can’t believe it took me so long to get him out of that place.”</p><p class="p1">Remus sighed, shifting down so that he was nearly in Sirius’ lap.</p><p class="p1">“You know it wasn’t your fault, Padfoot. You couldn’t have known that Pettigrew was that cunning. And besides, who could predict Azkaban after no trial?”</p><p class="p1">“I know. But no matter how many times I tell myself that, it’s just… Harry let something slip. I don’t think he meant for me to know. But the muggles - they made him sleep in a cupboard.”</p><p class="p1">“What!?”</p><p class="p1">Remus shot up from his reclined seat, amber eyes sparking in anger.</p><p class="p1">“Those bastards! Merlin, I could kill them.”</p><p class="p1">“I know.” Sirius sounded completely miserable. “And I didn’t notice it right away, but Harry is thin. Too thin. And his clothes are way too big. I think they were treating him pretty badly.”</p><p class="p1">“Damn. I’m sorry, Sirius. I know this must make it so much worse for you.”</p><p class="p1">“Oh, forget my problems. I’m just a guilty old man. It’s Harry we have to watch out for. After all, he’s got to pass grandfather’s inspection.”</p><p class="p1">Remus moaned, collapsing melodramatically against Sirius.</p><p class="p1">“I’d forgotten. Your grandfather. What is the old man going to think of Harry?”</p><p class="p1">“We’ve got to make sure that he likes him. If I’m to make Harry my heir, we can’t have any objections from Arcturus.”</p><p class="p1">“Any new from him? Is he still set on making you his heir?”</p><p class="p1">“It’s already done. He made up a new will two days ago, and I’m it. The future of the Black Family.”</p><p class="p1">“Are you still as eager to take the position as you were last time we spoke?”</p><p class="p1">“Shut up, Remus! You know I hate to do it. Honestly, though, it’s not as if I have any choice. And maybe redeeming my family name is worthwhile. After all, I’ll be the one in charge.”</p><p class="p1">Remus laughed a bit at that.</p><p class="p1">“You will! I’ll bet you’ll love to toy with old Lucius, too. After all, he’ll be your ally.”</p><p class="p1">“Not Malfoy. Ugh, the prat will be such a pain.”</p><p class="p1">“Let’s not think of politics anymore tonight, Siri. Time for bed.”</p><p class="p1">Sirius raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="p1">“Does that mean we’ll need to put silencing charms up?” he asked, an excited tone in his voice.</p><p class="p1">“Damn right. We’ve got our pup back, I think it’s time to celebrate.”</p><p class="p1">Sirius shot up, and started pulling Remus towards their bedroom.</p><p class="p1">“Come on, lover! Let’s go!”</p>
