  <p><strong>"<u>HARRY POTTER</u></strong> <strong><u>AND AZKABAN'S OLDEST PRISONER</u>"</strong></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Chapter 1: The Final Dark Lord</strong>
  </p>
  <p>It was rather cool for July, even though it was night. The wind whipped around, blowing leaves and twigs everywhere. A man wearing an old black cloak walked down the abandoned road. He coughed, covering his mouth with a very old wrinkled hand. Slowly he made his way home. Home? No, safe-house was a better word. This was a man that would be arrested or killed on sight. He had been sentenced to a life in Azkaban years ago.</p>
  <p>But apparently, he had escaped. Not on his own. It would have been impossible on his own. He was the most heavily guarded.</p>
  <p>No, he had help. By someone trying to replace Lord Voldemort as the leader of the Death Eaters. What was his name again? Ah yes, Drake Dursley. The so-called New Dark Lord.</p>
  <p>The man laughed at the thought. The New Dark Lord, how ridiculous. He hadn't lasted long either. He was killed two years ago by his own uncle.</p>
  <p>A shadow came over the man's face as he thought of Harry Potter; the savior of the wizarding world. The man had a mission to do. And he was not happy about it.</p>
  <p>"<em>Damn Unbreakable Vow!"</em> thought the man.</p>
  <p>He knew the time would come when he would have to face the great Potter. He remembered back, almost three years ago, to the day he made the Vow.</p>
  <p>
    <em>Azkaban Prison. It was a dreaded place, located out in the middle of the ocean. It looked like a prison from Hell. And that was exactly what it was, or as close as it could get.</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>So this is Azkaban." said a cloaked figure. "I guess those that have been here weren't exaggerating. Wouldn't you agree, Dolores?"</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>A short fat woman with a toad like face and a blank look in her eye stood by him. Umbridge nodded and the figure laughed. "I guess we should go inside."</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>They reached into their robes and brought out a bottle. Inside was a nasty liquid that smelled of cabbage. The figure drank the liquid and gagged in disgust. Almost immediately they began to change. Holding onto the wall for support the figure completed their transformation. When it was finished, they breathed a sigh of relief and pulled off their cloak. Underneath it was Arthur Weasley. Or at least, that's who they now where.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Walking up to the giant metal door, the Mr. Weasley impostor knocked. The doors opened, and the impostor was greeted by a dementor.</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>Good day." said the impostor. "Arthur Weasley, Minister of Magic and Doloros Umbridge here to speak to a prisoner."</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>The dementor eyed the impostor suspiciously. Well not really, since dementors are blind. It definitely felt something different about the 'minister'. The impostor feared that the dementor wouldn't be fooled by the disguise, but the relaxed when it moved aside to let them pass.</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>Thank you." said the impostor.</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>They made their way down the chambers of Azkaban. If it looked bad on the outside, it was ten times worse on the inside. But the impostor kept going. When they was almost at the cell they turned to the dementors following them.</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>I need to speak to him alone."</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>The dementors shook their heads, not trusting the supposed minister. The impostor drew their wands and cried out, "Expecto Patronum!" The dementors fled as a silver crow erupted from the impostor's wand.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The impostor and Umbridge continued down the chamber until they came to the deepest darkest cell in all of Azkaban. There was a man in the cell. A very old man. His face was sunken and covered by a gray beard that was the same color as his long hair. His blue bloodshot eyes looked very tired. His skin was chalk white and extremely wrinkly, making him look like a shriveled old raisin. He eyed 'Mr. Weasley' curiously.</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>Haven't had any visitors in years." said the man in a harsh voice.</em></p>
  <p>"<em>I believe that." said the impostor.</em></p>
  <p>"<em>What can I do for you, minister?" asked the man.</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>The impostor laughed. "I am not Arthur Weasley. It's amazing how well the Polyjuice Potion works, isn't it?"</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The man smiled, revealing rotten teeth. "Ah, very clever. It must have taken quite an effort to brew the potion and sneak in here just to speak with me. You must really want something."</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>That I do." said the impostor. "I'm willing to make you an offer."</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>The man raised a bushy eyebrows. "What kind of offer?"</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The impostor grinned evilly. "I am a faithful servant of Lord Voldemort. One of his last few. All the others surrendered after his downfall."</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>So I've heard. What's your name, friend?"</em></p>
  <p>"<em>Drake Dursley. But very soon I shall be known as the New Dark Lord."</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>The man laughed. "The New Dark Lord? How amusing. But I'm not concerned about who you want to be. You said you were going to make me an offer, so that means you want something from me. What is it?"</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>If you are willing to do me a favor, I will get you out of here."</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>The man seemed thoughtful. "How?"</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>Well first, I have your replacement right here." said Drake, pointing at Umbridge. "She's under the Imperius Curse, in case you haven't noticed. I have some more Polyjuice Potion with me. Then you shall become her and she shall become you. Once your out, I'll simply kill her and tell the guards you were dead. Then you and me shall leave. No one will miss her. She's just another witch bum I found on the streets one day in Knockturn Alley. And to think, she once worked for the ministry. She was Fudge's little helper, and now she's mine."</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>The man's eyes widened in understanding. "Ah, I see. Very clever."</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>As much as I would like to take the credit for coming up with this plan, I can not. This is the same way a former servant of the Dark Lord escaped. I believe his name was Barty Crouch Jr. But never mind that. Do we have a deal?"</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>The man's face lit up. "We do."</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>Not so fast." said Drake. "You have be known to be a liar and a traitor in the past. I don't know if I can trust you quite yet. Before I release you, you will make the Unbreakable Vow to obey me until you complete the task I give you. Dolores here will be our bonder as well as your replacement."</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>The man glared at Drake who just sneered. "You can still say no, and I'll leave right now and let you rot in here until the day you die. The choice is yours."</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The man thought about it a moment. "What will you have me do?"</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The impostor smiled more broadly. "It's simple enough. Simply kill Harry Potter."</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>Kill Harry Potter?" repeated the man. "Very well. I shall make the Unbreakable Vow. But there is something I must do first. I dare not take any chances until my task is complete."</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>Drake eyed him suspiciously. "What task?"</em>
  </p>
  <p>"<em>That is none of your concern!"</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>Drake took a moment to think about it. "How long will it take?"</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The man shook his head. "That I can not say. But I will be as swift as possible."</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Drake pondered on this some more. "Fine. But once your task is over, you shall kill Harry Potter."</em>
  </p>
  <p>Yes, the man remembered that night all too well. He had been in Azkaban so long he would have done anything to get out and complete his task. A task that for nearly three years had been unsuccessful. And on top of that, Drake had been killed and his servants captured. So much for the New Dark Lord.</p>
  <p>But it made no difference. The Unbreakable Vow still had to be fulfilled. And the man didn't really want to do it. Not because he had to kill. Oh no, he had done plenty of killing in his past. He just wasn't feeling comfortable about facing the most powerful wizard alive. But when given the choice to face Harry Potter and spending a life sentence in Azkaban, he would choose the former option.</p>
  <p>But he couldn't be discovered. As far as everyone knew, he had been dead for nearly three years. But during these past few years, he had felt more alive than ever. After spending years in Azkaban, he couldn't dream of going back. During his long time of imprisonment, he wondered if death would be better, or if the deal he had made long ago was worth it. Not the deal with Drake, but the deal that landed him in Azkaban. He had agreed to surrender if he would not be sentenced to the Veil.</p>
  <p>Now, after all these years of misery, he was finally free. Not completely. He was still bound to the Unbreakable Vow. Once he completed his task, which was taking much longer and was much more difficult than expected, he would then have to kill Harry Potter. Then he would truly be free. Free to take control of this world.</p>
  <p>But that would have to wait. Right now, he needed some sleep. Tomorrow he would continue his task. He had an idea of where to go next. He was surprised that it took so long to think of it. Now the question was, how would he get into Hogwarts?</p>
