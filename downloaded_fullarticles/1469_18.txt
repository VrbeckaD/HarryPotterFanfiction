          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry Potter wasn’t a man for <em>fancy clothes</em>. </p>
<p>Of course, Harry liked presents well enough. Liked a nice, cuddly Weasley jumper. He liked a nice warm pair of knitted socks made by Hermione, or even one of her (slightly misshapen) hats. </p>
<p>Harry was even known to wear a scarf made from the shredded fluff of a Puffskein, because it was one of Luna’s special designs (and it was fully guaranteed: no Puffs hurt in the making of this garment.)</p>
<p>But Harry Potter wasn’t ever a man to shop for these items. Merlin, <em>no</em>. </p>
<p>That was a role entirely reserved for his fiancé, Draco Malfoy. </p>
<p>Draco just <em>loved</em> to shop. Every tailor, garment-maker and shoe-saleswizard lived for the day that his white-blond head bounded though their door for, as sure as night follows day, a full till of Galleons would soon result. </p>
<p>The problem, as Harry saw it, was storage. </p>
<p>~@~</p>
<p>“Draco… I’m not sure you actually <em>need</em> three pair of Manolo Blahniks? I mean… The price of this pair alone. Three of these could have paid our flat deposit…”</p>
<p>“I’d hardly expect a hair-brain such as yourself to notice the difference, Potter. There’s a myriad of subtle differences. The leather, the heel… No, love. I must have them <em>all</em>.”</p>
<p>~@~</p>
<p>“And you need two identical Gucci suits, Draco? I wasn’t aware you spent so much time in the muggle world...”</p>
<p>“<em>Circe</em>. Don’t expect <em>me</em> to dress like a scarecrow just because <em>you’ve</em> made it a fashion statement. They’re perfect for lazing at the weekend.” </p>
<p>~@~</p>
<p>“And the collection of Louis Vuitton bags? You truly need seven of the things? I thought you’d cast a Doubling Spell by mistake…”</p>
<p>“Well, I could hardly be seen carting around a filthy bloody backpack like a certain <em>Saviour</em> I could mention. That thing ought to be in a museum exhibit, Harry. <em>Relics of the Chosen One!</em>”</p>
<p>~@~</p>
<p>“And this? It’s an old grey jumper. A <em>child’s</em> jumper. Please don’t tell me it’s vintage. Or some heirloom..”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I was wearing that when we met. When we were eleven.”</p>
<p>~@~</p>
<p>And with that, Harry decided to give up asking. An Extension Charmed wardrobe was definitely the way forward. </p>
<p>After all, they <em>were</em> wizards.</p></div>
