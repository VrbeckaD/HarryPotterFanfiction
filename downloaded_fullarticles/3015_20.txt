    <p>Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or any of the characters. I make no money from this story, it is just for fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This story is based off a fanfic I did over a decade ago called The Broken Locket. Parts of the plot also are inspired by ShayaLonnie’s Debt of Time. Only parts though, the two will be vastly different. Hopefully, you’ll still enjoy it nonetheless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chapter One</p>
<p>1969</p>
<p>Black Manor</p>
<p>The chilled winds travelled across the countryside, frosting the windows of the ancient Scottish-manor that overlooked snowy hills. A small girl sat on her bed, watching the snow drift in from the west. She drew small shapes onto the frosted glass with her finger.</p>
<p>The squeak of wood straining under feet met her ears and she focused her attention on the old attic door hanging off the top hinge. It opened with more noise, as two boys shuffled their way into the room. Both similar in height; long ebony hair fell to their shoulders.</p>
<p>She crawled off her bed and crouched to retrieve a tin box from under it. She motioned to one of the beds in the corner of the room. “Sit, and show me what she did this time.”</p>
<p>The one with grey eyes gave a false grin. “What are you talking about, Mia? We’re fine. Right, Severus?” He nudged the other boy, who kept his gaze on the floor, looking down his hooked nose.</p>
<p>He nodded. “We’re fine. No need to worry.”</p>
<p>She tsked, pushing a straight strand of black hair out of her face. “Sirius, you were both down there with her for an hour. You’re not fine. Now, sit.”</p>
<p>They both winced at her motherly tone before hobbling over to one of the beds. With careful movements they took off their shirts, revealing their bruised and cut up backs.</p>
<p>Mia frowned before climbing over the iron bars of the headboard and settling behind them on the bed. She opened the tin in her hands and took out two small jars. One was nearly empty. “I need to sneak into the gardens, again, so Severus can make more healing salve.”</p>
<p>Sirius glanced over this shoulder. “We’ve got to be careful getting you back in there. She’s added more dogs to guard the gate. It’s going to take some extra planning.”</p>
<p>Taking a dollop, she coated the deepest cut on Severus’s back first. He hissed but didn’t move. She placed each dollop of salve with consideration, leaving the minor injuries to heal themselves. They needed to conserve as much of the sticky stuff as possible.</p>
<p>“There, that should do it. Let it sit for a little while, and then go wash it off.” She climbed off the bed and went to her own.</p>
<p>Severus rolled his eyes as he wrapped his arms around his skinny middle. “We know. We only do this every other day. Whenever that bitch decides we breathed wrong in front of her.”</p>
<p>Mia tsked. “Severus, language, even if it’s true.</p>
<p>“Mia, come down here! Your father wants you!”</p>
<p>She stiffened at the command. The brothers looked at each other, before glancing at her. With a gulp, she stood.</p>
<p>Sirius cleared his throat. “What do you think he wants?”</p>
<p>Mia shrugged. “I don’t know. But I shouldn’t keep him waiting, you know how he can get. I’ll be back soon, hopefully.”</p>
<p>Without another word, she left them in the attic to await her.</p>
<p>Chapter One</p>
<p>1993</p>
<p>His face stared back at her: crazed, laughing. Tattoos littered his chest, as he held up the sign with the runic case number on it. Above his picture read <strong>Sirius Black: Wanted. </strong>A frown pulled at her lips she hadn’t seen him in almost five years, but for him, it had been longer, much longer. Even if she did happen to run into him he’d never recognise her.</p>
<p>The Daily Prophet crinkled as she folded it against its creases and slammed it down onto the mahogany table big enough to fit twenty. At the other end sat an elderly wizard, the bright colourful robes disguising his true nature.</p>
<p>“We need to help him. Why are you just sitting here when we need to find him, and bring him here where he would be safe. I know he’s innocent, there’s no way in Hades he murdered those Muggles, and you know it!” A brunette curl fell down into her brown eyes and she swiped it away with a quick hand. Her chest heaved, she was almost fourteen, there was no way she was going to let the old man push her into a corner, again. She needed Sirius and Severus in her life.</p>
<p>The man set his own copy of the Daily Prophet down. He leaned onto the table his fingers interlacing in front of his mouth. “And what, may I ask, do you plan to do once he’s here? Tell him the truth? My dear girl, haven’t you learned that can never happen. No one, besides myself can ever know who you truly are. Your mere existence gives the dark side a fighting chance. If they knew you were still alive, you would be kidnapped and forced to play the part of Tom’s weapon of war. Do you want that to happen? No one, not even Sirius and Severus can know you still walk the plain of the living. You would be risking Harry’s life, do you want that? You like him, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Her cheeks glowed with a pink hue before she crumpled up the newspaper and hurled it on the ground. She stomped off toward the fireplace.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” The old man stood.</p>
<p>“To meet Harry and Ron in Diagon Alley.” She threw the Floo powder down with defiance.</p>
<p>1995</p>
<p>Her skin crawled as she peered around at the eeriness of it all. It had been years since she’d been inside its depressing walls, but the only thing that had changed was the added inch of dust on everything.</p>
<p>“Welcome to my home sweet home!” Sirius gestured wide around the room of the parlour.</p>
<p>“Traitors! Filthy blood traitors, get out of my house!” A woman’s voice screamed.</p>
<p>Hermione stiffened, it’d also been many years since she had to hear her voice. Long dead, the woman still managed to haunt her dreams, and now here she was screaming for all to hear. Yet, even with her wailing, she couldn’t take her eyes off him. Her brother. So much older, but she could see the child she remembered him as.</p>
<p>“This is your house, Sirius?” Harry stepped forward, closer to his Godfather, his emerald eyes in awe of the place around him. Sirius slapped him on the shoulder. “That it is, Harry, my boy! And one day, you’ll live here with me. Just need to get those pesky charges taken off my name.”</p>
<p>She bit her lip as she watched the interaction, a bit of ire rose into her chest. Why did any of this have to happen to her? Her hands balled into fists at her sides. The old man’s eyes were on her, always, making sure that she never slipped up.</p>
<p>“It needs a bit of clean up, but nothing a few good spells can’t handle. Let me show you and your friends where you’ll be staying for the summer.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll return later tonight, I have some things to see to.” Dumbledore nodded to them before giving her one last meaningful stare.</p>
<p>Hermione gave a subtle roll of her eyes and motioned for him to go.</p>
<p>She followed behind Ron as Sirius led them up to the second floor. Several rooms lined a long hallway. Sirius talked about his childhood in the house, never once did Severus or her name come up. A pang hit her in the chest, was he ashamed of them?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>………………………………..</p>
<p>“C’mon we have to listen in on this meeting. I need to know what they’re talking about.” Harry ran a hand through his hair as they stared down at the kitchen door from the landing on the stairs. Inside, the Order of the Phoenix talked about him and the war, but they would not allow them in on the meeting due to their age.</p>
<p>Hermione frowned, wanting to be able to hear the meeting as well. Both her brothers were in there. She hadn’t seen Severus since the end of the fourth year. Her heart ached at the sight of who he had become. An angry, bitter man who had seen too much pain for one person to bear.</p>
<p>Someone tapped her on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, we’ve got things covered.” Fred handed her some kind of fleshy tube.</p>
<p>“Fish them up to the door.” George showed them how with his own.</p>
<p>“And stick them in your ear.” Fred finished.</p>
<p>“We call them Extendable Ears,” they said in unison. </p>
<p>Ron and Harry used theirs in an instant. Hermione’s frown deepened. What if they got caught? She could just see Severus glaring at her for doing such a thing.</p>
<p>……………………………………</p>
<p>She gasped for air, sitting straight up in bed. Sweat pooled at the nape of her neck, her bushy curls clung to it. The nightmare that haunted her since that night, tumbled through her mind's eye, willing away any thought of more sleep.</p>
<p>Throwing the covers off, she made her way to the kitchen to put on the kettle. Her steps paused, however as she reached the kitchen door. An orange glow stretched from underneath it. She frowned, pulling her wand out of her messy hair bun. Molly wasn’t one to leave the fire going.</p>
<p>With caution, she edged open the door, only to find Severus and Sirius sitting at the table; tumblers of Fire Whiskey in their hands. Her heart sped up at the sight of them together. She hadn’t seen that in so many years. There were times she wanted to know if they remembered they were brothers.</p>
<p>Sirius glanced her way before clearing his throat. Severus jerked back to the present and glared at him “What?”</p>
<p>Sirius motioned to her before she entered the room. She could tell them everything, she had them together and no Dumbledore to tell her no. At that moment, confidence filled her chest. Telling them everything was her only option.</p>
<p>“What brings you here at this hour, Mione? It’s a bit late for you to be up.”</p>
<p>Severus stood. “I should be going. See you around, Black.”</p>
<p>Panic erupted through her. “No! Stay, please.”</p>
<p>He frowned at her from behind a curtain of stringy ebony hair. “What has gotten into you, Miss Granger?”</p>
<p>She licked her lips. There was no turning back. “I don’t know if I’ll ever get this chance again. He’s always watching somehow. Professor Snape, could you please lock and ward the kitchen, so no one can hear, even from the floo?”</p>
<p>He arched an eyebrow at her, distrust in his obsidian eyes.</p>
<p>Sorrow pulled at her. She wouldn’t be above falling to her knees and begging him to listen to her. “Please, Severus!” It’d been the first time she’d ever used his name in the past seven years.</p>
<p>“I think she may be on the brink of a mental breakdown, Snape, just do it!” Sirius sat his tumbler down and stared at her. “What is it, Hermione? What has you so distressed, who’s listening?”</p>
<p>With a shaking hand, she pulled the chair at the end of the table out and sat down. Sirius sat diagonally, and Severus would sit across the long table from her.</p>
<p>She watched Severus as he went about the room, locking and warding everything, including the Floo. Not a single word fell from her lips. Severus looked at her. “We’re completely warded against eavesdroppers, Miss Granger. Though I find your behaviour strange.”</p>
<p>She motioned for him to sit, again. “Dumbledore is everywhere. I’ve tried telling you both separately a thousand times, but he always stops me.” Hermione looked over her shoulder as if expecting him to materialise.</p>
<p>Sirius frowned. “Tell us what, Hermione? Is Dumbledore doing something bad to Harry?”</p>
<p>She shakes her head, her tousled curls going every which way. “No, this has nothing to do with Harry.” Her gaze went to each of them in turn before she let out a heavy sigh. “There’s no easy way to say this, so I’m just going to rip the bandage off before I lose more time. I’m Mia.”</p>
<p>Both their grips tightened on their glasses. “What?” Sirius swallowed hard.</p>
<p>She kept her breathing even. “I’m Mia, Sirius.” Her gaze turned to her other brother. “Severus, your sister.”</p>
<p>Sirius stood from the table and stumbled back. “That’s not possible, she’s dead.”</p>
<p>Severus growled. “You are not amusing, Miss Granger.” He stood from the table as well, ready to leave.</p>
<p>“When we were seven, our mother Eileen Prince killed herself after running off with the Muggle Tobias Snape. Our father remarried two months later to Fiona Nott. She hated us, but you two were the ones that took her punishments.”</p>
<p>Severus scoffed. “You call that proof? Anyone insane enough to delve into our pasts could find that information.”</p>
<p>She sighed. “What about when we were five? We went to Silverton lake with mother, and Sirius nearly drowned trying to do a backflip off the dock and knocked himself out. Or the time when Fiona had just became our mother, and we sneaked into her secret garden to get ingredients for salves that mother taught all of us how to make, but Severus was the best at perfecting the first go. The night I disappeared it was a full moon with a red hue. Moments before I was called downstairs, never to see you as children again, you’d both been beaten by Fiona, and I used the last of our salve reserves. Do I need to go on?”</p>
<p>Sirius ran a hand through his long locks. “Merlin’s balls. Are you serious? Actually serious? How?”</p>
<p>Hermione smirked at him. “I’m not serious, your Sirius. Our father, trying to get in the good graces of a still young Tom Riddle, wanted to give him the ultimate weapon against Dumbledore. Me.” Her hands trembled as she held them together.</p>
<p>Both men stumbled back into their chairs. Severus took a long gulp from his tumbler, finishing it off. He reached with shaking hands to pour himself more of the aged firewhiskey, Sirius only brought out for their secret get togethers to remember Mia. They never said a word, until that night. “How is this possible? How old are you really? Why do you look like that?”</p>
<p>Sirius wordlessly took the bottle from him and poured more of the amber liquid into his own glass. “What he asked.”</p>
<p>She wanted to reach out and take a drink from the bottle as well, to calm her nerves, but she wasn’t sure if they would let her even get it to her lips. “I’m almost sixteen, just like you’re both about to turn thirty-six, but no one knows you share a birthday. I was really dismayed to see that, I’m not sure what happened between you two over the decades, but I hoped you two would be closer than I came to find out you were. We were triplets, you two should’ve stayed as thick as thieves.”</p>
<p>They looked at each other, before their gazes turned on the table before them, shadowed in the darkness of a dying fire. “Mistakes were made, on both our parts as children, and we grew apart.” Sirius downed more of his tumbler.</p>
<p>“I see.” She snapped her fingers and the fireplace came back to roaring life. Filling the kitchen with a warm, orange glow.</p>
<p>They both jumped and looked to the fire before their wide eyes turned on her. Sirius gulped. “H-how? You’re still a minor.”</p>
<p>She grinned. “The law only responds to acts of magic done with certified spells, I’m using the rawest form of magic, pure intention nothing else. No words, or wand movements to make things complicated. What do you remember from the night I disappeared?”</p>
<p>Sirius blew out a loud breath. “I’m still trying to wrap my head around you being Mia. How?”</p>
<p>Severus sighed. “All I remember is you going downstairs to meet with father, and you never came back. He said you ran away without us, but we believed he killed you.”</p>
<p>Her brown-eyes turned onto the tabletop as her hands began to shake, again. “I did run away, but I didn’t do it on purpose, and if I could’ve figured out how, I would’ve gone back for you. I swear on my magic. I’ve been trying to figure out how to get back. But Dumbledore has been syphoning my power since I showed up in 1991 and he found me. I can’t harness enough of my power to travel, again. I swear, one day, I’m going to go back and change all of this. Stop you from ever being framed. And to stop you from turning into a cynic.”</p>
<p>Sirius frowned. “There’s still so much I don’t understand. How are you here? Why and how did Dumbledore begin to syphon your powers? He fights for the light, why would he do something like that?”</p>
<p>Severus and Hermione snorted at the same time. She laughed. “Dumbledore is as grey as they come, Sirius. He’ll never admit to being on one side or the other if he has something to gain from it. He’s using me, just like Tom would use me if he had the chance. The night I disappeared, a cosmic rarity happened. The planets aligned on the night of a blood moon. Allowing for a sacred ritual to take place, to invoke a god and house them in a human form.”</p>
<p>Both of their grips turned white on their glasses. “He didn’t,” Sirius growled.</p>
<p>She nodded. “He did.” Hot tears coursed down her cheeks as the memory came to the forefront of her mind, as vivid as the night it happened.</p>
<p>1969</p>
<p>Mia black knocked at the door of her father’s study. Her heart thundered in her chest. What could she have done this time to make him angry? She’d stayed in the attic all day, so he that he wouldn’t pay her any mind.</p>
<p>“Enter!”</p>
<p>She jumped at the seriousness in his tone. Turning the gold knob, she pushed open the door and stepped inside, before closing it without a <em>click </em>behind her. She leaned her body against the carvings in the door.</p>
<p>Her father stood with a group of people, all wearing black robes. Only he had the cowl off his head. With an outstretched arm, he motioned to her. “Come here, Mia. I need your help with something.”</p>
<p>Everything in her told her to run. To run until her legs broke under the strain and she was far away from this place. “W-what do you need help with, father?” she stayed stuck to her spot in front of the door.</p>
<p>He curled his fingers, motioning for her to come to him with more vigour. “Come here, and you’ll find out. Don’t make me come and get you.”</p>
<p>His voice held the tone of a threat that she didn’t want to try. The fear of his wrath unstuck her feet, but it didn’t quell the rush of blood in her ears from the terror that made her heart go mad. Her feet carried her forward until he could grab her by the shoulder and push her in front of himself, to the centre of the circle the group of people formed. Something growled from behind one of them, making her jump.</p>
<p>“Father, what do you need me to do?” She looked to him, but he’d pulled the cowl back up, hiding his eyes in shadow.</p>
<p>“Don’t move.”</p>
<p>Her heart wanted to come out of her chest. She wanted to die, whatever was coming, everything inside her said it wasn’t good.</p>
<p>They began to chant in a language she didn’t know. The air took on a buzz as the tiny hairs on her arms stood on end. Her breathing increased as she tried to run, but someone grabbed her arm and pulled her back. Another took hold of her cheeks and pried her jaw open to force something pearlescent in a fat-bottom vial down her throat. She gagged, trying to push it away while hot tears coursed down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Gasping for air when they pulled the vial back, she looked to her father, his face still hidden as he chanted. She fell at his feet. “Please, I’ll be good! Let me go back to my room. Please, father!” Her tiny hands grabbed at the hem of his black robes.</p>
<p>Someone grabbed her calves and pulled her back to the centre. A scream erupted from her. “Sirius, Severus, help me!”</p>
<p>Her skin glowed with a blue-hue as someone came to stand in front of her and something else growled from over her shoulder. She shut her eyes tight. She didn’t want to know what the creature was. Its hot breath ghosted over the skin of her neck.</p>
<p>The person in front of her knelt before they pushed back their hood. A beautiful woman with auburn hair stared back her, eyes glowing red in the moonlight light that came through the tall windows behind Mia.</p>
<p>“Open your eyes, child. I can make this painless.”</p>
<p>In an instant, her eyes shot open, only to be captivated by the woman’s eyes. Even if she wanted to, she couldn’t pull her gaze away.</p>
<p>The buzz of their chanting grew to a crescendo before the woman struck. Sharp fangs appeared in her mouth before she leaned forward to pierce the girl’s neck and draw the blood from her. Something warm hit her other shoulder, it hurt, but she couldn’t seem to comprehend the pain. Her body went limp in the woman’s arms before they laid her on the ornate rug of her father’s study.</p>
<p>Her body grew hot as she laid there, but she couldn’t move. All her limbs were too heavy. The woman still knelt over her. She bit into her own wrist before pressing the bloody wound to Mia’s lips.</p>
<p>“Drink, child, you’ll feel better, soon.”</p>
<p>The blood seeped past her lips to where she could taste it and a hunger like none she’d ever felt before awoke inside her. She sucked more of the nectar into her mouth before she had enough strength to hold the woman’s arm. She drank with desperate need.</p>
<p>With a hiss, the woman pulled her arm away. “That’s enough.”</p>
<p>Mia followed her arm, blood dripping down her chin. She wanted more, she needed more.</p>
<p>Storm clouds replaced the snow-filled ones, thunder and lightning erupted across the skies and the heavens opened and released a torrential downpour onto the already snow-covered land.</p>
<p>The woman pushed her back. “No.”</p>
<p>Her father’s voice came through the chanting. “She didn’t die, it’s time for the invoking.”</p>
<p>The blue glow around her body turned white as all her muscles became stiff. She sat upright on her knees, her head tilted back, as her spine strained against the magic. A sliver of moonlight came through the clouds as her body turned of its own accord. The light hit her in the middle of her forehead as her mouth moved, chanting words she’s didn’t know.</p>
<p>Fear seized her again, something was happening, something was entering her body, and she couldn’t stop it. It filled every crevice of her mind.</p>
<p>
  <em>Such a young being. Not even a decade old. Why do you invoke Hecate, child? You’re too young to hold my power.”</em>
</p>
<p>The voice of a woman filled her mind, as more warmth travelled throughout her veins. She couldn’t speak to respond, all she had was her thoughts. <em>‘I don’t know what’s happening. I just want to go to my room!’ </em>Hot tears dripped off her chin.</p>
<p>
  <em>This process cannot be undone, I’ll be with you until your physical form can no longer hold me. I am bound to you for life. I see your father wants to use us for his gain. What do you wish?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>‘I want to be far away from here.’</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>As you wish, so it will be done.</em>
</p>
<p>1995</p>
<p>“The next thing I knew, I was standing in the study, but no one else was there and it appeared unused for decades. I ran up to our room in the attic, but you two weren’t there. The voice in my head disappeared. I haven’t heard her since that day, but I know she’s there sleeping. Dumbledore keeps her at bay with the syphon, and I don’t know how to break it. Without her help, I can’t go back.”</p>
<p>Sirius passed Hermione his tumbler. “You look like you need this. Mother of Merlin. We should’ve helped you!” He slammed his fist down on the table.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t hear anything happening downstairs, but when you hadn’t come back by dawn, we knew something was wrong. The bastard wouldn’t tell us anything. When we started Hogwarts, I took mother’s new last name, and once he had Potter as a friend to run to in the summers, we never spoke.” Severus stared at the sip of firewhiskey left in his glass.</p>
<p>Sirius sighed. “I was young and stupid. You were sorted int to Slytherin and I Gryffindor. I became too wrapped up in House loyalties, and with you taking Snape as your name, I felt betrayed. Like you didn’t want to be my brother anymore.”</p>
<p>She finished off Sirius’ firewhiskey. “One day, I’m going to go back, I swear it. None of this will have ever happened. I’m going to go back to that night and grab you two, we’ll run from there. I’ll kill them all if they get in our way.”</p>
<p>“One thing I don’t understand. Why do you look so different?” Sirius took the empty glass back from her.</p>
<p>“It’s a glamour. Dumbledore made me do it before I entered Hogwarts because he knew Severus would recognise me.” She glanced around and listened, make sure no one was coming, and then she closed her eyes. She shook her hair out, the bushy curls melted away into straight, dark brown locks. Her cheekbones became more prominent. At last, she opened her eyes, sapphire stared back at the men.  Her short height stayed the same.</p>
<p>They both sat back in their chairs as they stared at her. After all those years of wondering and believing her dead, there she was. Then, in the brilliant orange glow of the fire, they saw them. The scars that rested in the crooks on both sides of her neck.</p>
<p>“So you were really bitten by a werewolf and a vampire at the same time?” Sirius couldn’t take his gaze off the werewolf bite, that looked like it had taken a chunk out of her.</p>
<p>She touched the werewolf scar. A motion, Sirius realised, she did a lot when around Remus.  “Everything I read, about being bitten by both says that I shouldn’t be alive right now. The two viruses should’ve gone to war in my blood and killed me, but here I am. I think it has something to do with the Goddess lying dormant inside me, but I don’t know. The books I’ve found  so far on invoking are all loads of shite. I’m not sure what grimoire our father used. I’ve been through the entire library upstairs and I haven’t found any ritual like the one I experienced.”</p>
<p>Severus frowned. “Do you need to be taking the wolfsbane potion? Who’s been brewing it for you?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I’m not like a typical werewolf. I change on full moons out of my own free will if I desire it. It causes me only a slight discomfort, and I have complete control of myself. So, I guess I’m more like a Lycan than a werewolf. As for the vampire side, I think the werewolf cancels out a lot of the symptoms. I can get bloodlust if someone is bleeding around me, but blood replenishing potions help take the edge off. If I get desperate, I’ll buy animal blood from a Muggle butcher. I’ve yet to bite someone and I plan to keep it that way.”</p>
<p>The kitchen door swung open as Remus came sluggishly through it. His blurry eyes turned on them and the girl he didn’t recognise at the table. Her blue-eyed gaze met his and he stopped moving, something about her made him want to be with her for the rest of his life. “Who are—” He stopped mid-sentence as darkness edged into his vision and he fell toward the ground.</p>
<p>Something soft caught Remus in the air, making sure his fall didn’t hurt him. Sirius and Severus looked at each other, before looking at Hermione. Her image returned to the girl they’d come to know. She stood from the table. “Don’t worry. I just knocked him out for a second. I’ve used too much magic today, Dumbledore will know I’m up to something. You must treat me like you always have. If you want to talk to me more about this, it has to be late, like it was tonight. At a time when Dumbledore thinks I’m sleeping.”</p>
<p>She hurried to grab the kettle, fill it up, and place it over the fire before she went to Remus’s side. The brother’s watched her, minds still not fully comprehending that their lost sister was right in front of them, possessed by the Mother of magic, and bitten by not only a werewolf, but vampire as well.</p>
<p>“Professor Lupin, can you hear me? Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Remus stirred at her voice. “Miss Granger?” His eyes fluttered opened to meet her gaze as she knelt over him. “What happened?” He sat up.</p>
<p>“You fainted, sir. Should I call for Madame Pomfrey?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “No, I, um…I’m okay. I’m not sure why that happened.” He then looked to where she’d been sitting and frowned. “Wasn’t there a girl sitting over there, one with blue eyes?”</p>
<p>Hermione frowned at him. “Your eyes must be playing tricks on you. I was sitting there, but I clearly don’t have blue eyes. That would be wonderful though. Go sit, and I’ll bring you some tea. You prefer Earl Grey in the morning, right?” She moved with him as he stood.</p>
<p>He took a seat next to Sirius. “Erm, yes, if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>A smirk spread across her lips as she shared a cryptic look with Sirius and Severus. “Not at all, sir. I couldn’t sleep either.”</p>
