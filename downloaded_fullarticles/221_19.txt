</p><p> </p><p>When Prince Perseus Weasley was born, it was on a crisp Autumn day. August 22nd was predicted to be a cool weathered day, but when the third son of King Arthur and Queen Molly Weasley was conceived, people said that the temperature took a drastic dip. The royal midwife had run back into the nursery to find the new babe cooing at a light flurry that had kicked up in the room, and she had fainted on the spot.</p><p> </p><p>The King and Queen had been pleasantly surprised, but shocked nonetheless. Of course, they hadn’t loved their son any less, but such a power had never appeared in their family lines before. Once young Percy was healthy enough, the King and Queen set out with their son to seek answers from Albus Dumbledore, the Stone Statue shaman. He told the two that Percy was a special lad to have been born with such a power. </p><p> </p><p>Arthur and Molly already knew this, but stayed silent in order to be polite.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore warned the two to be cautious with Percy as he grew, as though his power was magnificent, the wrong mindset could change what they would know as a loving boy into a dangerous monster.</p><p> </p><p>This, of course, set the parents off. Molly hugged the sleeping Percy to her chest, and Arthur had glared, telling Dumbledore that the boy was just a baby, it was wrong to predict such things about a toddler he knew nothing about. Dumbledore had quieted them, saying that as correct as Arthur was, they could never tell exactly what would come of the future.</p><p> </p><p>After making both of them promise to be cautious with the boy in the future, Albus requested that Molly stay and talk with him for a while. Assuring her husband that she wouldn’t be long, Molly followed Dumbledore further into his hut while Arthurtook Percy and begrudgingly waited in their carriage.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, we’re alone now,” Molly said brusquely, eager to return to her kingdom with her husband and son. “What is it you wish to discuss with me, sir?”</p><p> </p><p>The man chuckled as he took a sip from his stone mug. Molly almost felt inferior for having refused a cup of tea herself.</p><p> </p><p>“There is truly no need to be so hostile, my dear,” Albus told her. “This is a safe place, after all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Which means?” Molly asked, sweeping a lock of red hair behind her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing much.” The old man takes another sip. “Just that I like to keep a life devoid of secrets. Of course, I won’t force my values on you.”</p><p> </p><p>Molly blinked. Dumbledore looked up from his tea, and though he didn’t give a conspiratorial wink, Molly felt the effects of one regardless.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course you know.”</p><p> </p><p>“You have to tell him eventually.”</p><p> </p><p>Molly doesn’t dare ask who he means, lest she be handed a double sided coin.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not the right time.” It never is, she mused.</p><p> </p><p>“I suppose not.”</p><p> </p><p>Albus took another sip, and Molly wished she could do the same.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that all?” Molly asked. “I have a son to coddle unconditionally, lest he become a monster to be feared by all.”</p><p> </p><p>The tea cup hit the stone table with a <em> thunk</em>. Molly froze, and looked up at Dumbledore, who was more serious than she had seen him all night.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll do well to heed my warning, Molly Prewett,” he decreed. “There are hardships written in that boy’s destiny. Hardships that you and Arthur will powerless to stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Molly licked her lips. “We’re his parents, Albus. We’ll protect him with-”</p><p> </p><p>“You will not be around forever,” Albus said matter-of-factly.</p><p> </p><p>“We will protect our children with our lives.”</p><p> </p><p>Molly stood, not sparing a glance back as she left the hut. It didn’t take long before Dumbledore heard the fastly receding <em> clip-clop </em> that signaled the King and Queen’s departure. He raised the cup to his lips again.</p><p> </p><p>“I do hope she heeds my warning.”</p>
