  <strong>IN SHORT. </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Working for Miranda Honeycutt for the last four years has taught Kendra Carter many things, including how to spot a liar. She has always had an itch to uncover the truth, which leads her to investigate why a group of wizards and witches are gathering at the Honeycutt Tea House under the guise of a book club. </p><p>Surprisingly, or in fact - not surprisingly at all, her nosiness results in an uncomfortable reunion with the most infuriating wizard in Britain who drags her into a secret society that has been reformed to fight against the rising of the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters. </p><p>Kendra knows she has a choice - but does she really want to fight the good fight if she is forced to work with none other than her childhood rival Charlie Weasley? Because deep down she knows that in the end, the tension between them will prove more dangerous than any unforgivable curse. </p><p> </p>
