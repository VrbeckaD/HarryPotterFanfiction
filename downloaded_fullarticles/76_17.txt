    <p>Life was interesting for Draco Malfoy after his fifth year, many things changed for him and his family. His father had been a spy for the side of the light almost since the beginning of the first war. He was still a pureblood who believed in the things that the Dark Lord preached but never trusted him. He is a Slytherin for a reason, he knew that the Dark Lord just wanted power and once he got it he would only want more and would point to the pureblood families then. So he changed sides and became a spy for protection. When the first war ended it was an enormous relief for him. Draco never expects to be in the same position again, he began to remember the day his father told them about this.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>His father came home one night with a tense posture and lines of concern on his face "I need a word in the studio now"</p><p>"Lucius tell us what happened?" She put her hand on his shoulder for support, something he was grateful for.</p><p>Lucius took a deep breath before speaking with regret "<em><b>He</b></em> is back" the room stood still for a minute, everyone knowing all to well who he was talking about.</p><p>"B-but that's impossible ... this has to be a lie!" Narcissa said in anguish, she hated what the first war did to Lucius, this simply couldn't be happening again.</p><p>"It's no lie, I saw it with my own eyes ..." lifting his sleeve showing his now completely black mark instead of the faded gray it had become after the disappearance of the Dark Lord. "Wormtail performed an ancient ritual to give him a new body using Potter's blood, now he is even more powerful"</p><p>"What are we going to do father?" It was the only thing Draco could ask him.</p><p>"For now nothing. I will observe the current situation. We need to know more about the new power that the Dark Lord has and I will make sure that the Potter boy is able to win against him."</p><p>"Lucius he is just a child, he is even younger than our Draco, he cannot be the champion of the light" Narcissa said indignantly that someone would put a child in a situation like this, her heart ached at the idea.</p><p>"I know he is young, but it is the only chance they have or at least that is what that idiot Dumbledore insists on" he said in a serious tone, he had always hated the man. He didn't understand how he could say that a child was going to be their only hope in the war "at least the child has talent, he hold his own remarkably well."</p><p>"Potter has the greatest magical potential I've seen in my life, but he's not trained properly. I think he could do it, but not with the little school has taught him." That was the truth anyone could easily see his magical potential, he could be at the level of Merlin and Morgana if it weren't for their lack of education.</p><p>" We can only hope for now. "</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>All of them were on edge for days after that, the uncertainty of the whole situation was the worst. His father was away from home most of the summer either in a meeting with You-Know-Who, in a raid, or sending reports to Dumbledore. His mother seemed to always be a little distant even if she did try to smile for him. Draco was kind of numbed by the information, he couldn't really grasp the concept of a war. Yes he was born in one technically, but it ended before he had use of memory so it always sounded like a foreign concept for him. It was something you just know happened and learned about in school, but never imagined you are gonna live in it. He is certain he will have to live through it, you don't have a father like Lucius Malfoy and get to be neutral.</p><p>During that summer he also had another thing occupying his mind, he just couldn't stop thinking about Potter. He wished he could say that was a novelty but it wasn't. The guy had always managed to be in Draco's head one way or another. Ever since the first moment in Madam Malkin's when he saw those beautiful green eyes on the scrawny and shy boy, he was in trance, and something called him to this boy for reasons he couldn't come close to comprehend. Even after he had been humiliated by said boy their first night at Hogwarts he could not stop watching him all the time, craving his eyes on him constantly. He even decided to bully him to have Potter more aware of him. And yes, he is completely aware it is pathetic, but he just couldn't deal with not having Potter's attention.</p><p>By their third year he figured out the reasons he just couldn't leave Potter alone. He had a giant crush on the guy which is one of the stupidest things to ever happen to him. Potter is one of the only people Draco couldn't stand and yet that didn't stop him from dreaming about him every night. At first he refused to accept this, he blamed it on hormones and proceeded to date every wizard with black hair and light color eyes (not obvious at all) to convince himself it was nothing. Of course denial can only work so much. For the Yule ball he knew he was fucked, he had never felt so much hatred and pure rage before seeing Potter dance with one of the Patil twins. Even though the other boy was clearly uncomfortable something just snapped inside of Draco. If he hadn't had Blaise and Pansy he might have cursed the girl into hell for touching Potter. </p><p>Since then he understood that no matter how much he fought it he was completely in love with one Harry Potter. The same guy that has hated him for years with good reason to do so. He resigned himself to just look at him from afar and confined every trace of his crush for him in a corner of his mind. That worked for a while, but now things were different. There was a war coming and Potter was in the center of it. He couldn't help but be terrified of what would happen to him. Yes, he knew Potter was incredibly powerful even with all his lack of training and he could hold his own in a duel. But war was different, war needed a lot more than just power if you don't want to die. You had to be ruthless and fine with the possibility of killing another person. He has seen Potter, he knows his heart is as pure as they come with a childlike innocence that is looking for the good in the world even when there isn't any. He was not made for war and yet he was chosen to play the biggest part.</p><p>In the last year he saw how bad the pressure was hitting Harry. He could see that it was crushing him, the constant flow of hate from people who thought he was crazy for saying that the Dark Lord came back and the way Umbridge was dead set in breaking his spirit slowly but steady. He doesn't know what kind of detention she was giving Potter, but he knew that it drained him. Potter lookd pale and dead. His eyes were lacking the emotion that before they were so full of. Draco knew that he was close to snapping but he couldn't do much to help. The only thing he could do was not give him as much detention and try help him if he could to keep his little defense club a secret as long as possible. But once someone told Umbridge their location, nothing could be done there.</p><p>He knows what happened at the end of the year. The attack at the ministry his father tried to warned the light side about but they didn't listen. When the time came it was chaos, his father told them that only a couple of students were there defending the thing the Dark Lord wanted. Mere children were fighting against the most powerful Death Eaters all by themselves. They held up better than expected and they did contain them for a long time before the Order of the Phoenix arrived to "save" the day. In the end it was even more of a disaster. Draco's fathers' cover was blow when he tried, unsuccessfully, to save Sirius Black from falling through the veil. But what he said in pity for Potter is what exposed him,  <em>"The poor boy has lost enough people thanks to this war already." </em> They had to run from the manor in case the Dark Lord went looking for them. His mother was actually immensely proud of him for doing that even if that mean running away from their home.</p><p>The Order sent them to a house in a tiny muggle town south of Scotland. They were sent with his Uncle Sev and Lupin, which was surprising. His mother told him that it was because after Black's death Lupin's mental state got extremely bad losing one of the last members of his pack. The death hit Lupin hard. Severus was not pleased with this, but his mother seemed to adore the werewolf and no one dared to say no to her if you wanted to have a pleasant life.</p><p>So that is how he ended up like this. The five of them trying to live with each other. They had been with each other a little over 3 weeks already.</p><p>"Dragon come, it's time for lunch" his mother calls him from the door. Remus was actually the only one who knew how to cook a little. He made all the meals for everyone, his mother began to learn although he thinks it's just to spend time with the werewolf.</p><p>He was the last one at the table, they started a light conversation until a small piece of paper appeared in the center of the table.</p><p>"Well, this is strange, maybe it's the Order," said the werewolf when he tried to reach it.</p><p>"Or it could be a trap, don't touch it, fool!" Uncle Sev shouts and proceeds to cast multiple spells until he considered the note safe enough.</p><p>"Severus you don't need to scream at the table, please," Narcissa said as he grabbed the paper and looked at them shaken. The note was small, so there wasn't much to read. The alarming thing was that it was written in blood. "Help me," that's all it said.</p><p>By the time his mother finished, Lupin's eyes glowed golden and a wild growl tore his throat, scaring them all.</p><p>"That has Harry's blood!" He was up and ready to leave in seconds until Narcissa put a delicate hand on his face.</p><p>"Remus breath please. If this is Harry's blood and he needs help we will all go. But you need to be in control of yourself first," putting both hands on his face and forcing him look at her.</p><p>"Are you absolutely sure this has his blood?" his father asks with a neutral tone.</p><p>"I could recognize his smell anywhere, it's him."</p><p>"Why are we still here? He is obviously in trouble." Draco was nervous without knowing what happened to Potter to cause him to send something like that.</p><p>"Draco darling you can't come, it could be dangerous," his mother told him softly when she noticed him going out of the house with them.</p><p>"Mother with all due respect, I will help, I will not stay here," he said firmly.</p><p>"Dragon, this is not your place to help."</p><p>"Since when do you care about Potter?" Severus said a little confused by the way Draco was acting.</p><p>"I think it might be convenient, keep in mind which house you will go to. There is a very good possibility that Father and Uncle Severus cannot enter, I mean it would be a terrible lack of judgement if someone with the dark mark could enter the house of the savior, don't you think? " He was thinking about this on the fly, but he just had to go. "And it can't be bad to have someone else to be alert of the surroundings."</p><p>"I can see that there is some logic in your argument." Lucius said looking at his son with curiosity, it was really strange for him to act this way. "I guess it would not hurt to bring you with us as long as you are careful, now we should go quickly. "</p><p>They immediately left the barrier, Draco linked arms with his mother to apparate with her. The typical pull that comes with apparition was a little worse than normal as it was a location unknown to them only guided by the description of Lupin. Privet Drive was as quiet as ever, no car or inhabitant in sight.</p><p>"Potter lives here?" Draco said quite disgusted with the surrounding houses. They were all exactly alike, not a single bit of character or originality throughout the street.</p><p>"I know they are Muggles, but I expected them to have a minimal sense of style, this is horrible," Narcissa said with the same disgust.</p><p>"It's a common suburb, it's normal for all houses to be the same," said Remus as he began to move looking for number 4.</p><p>Once they got there, everything seemed normal, the lights were still on. They hoped not to have many problems trying to enter.</p><p>"There are not wards around this house" Severus concluded after a couple of spells.</p><p>"How can that be, if Potter lives here there should be at least one. What was the Order thinking? " Draco said. He might have been bluffing before but it was true that there should be wards for at least people with the dark mark.</p><p>They couldn't stop to think about it much because Remus was already walking to the door after it was deemed safe and knocked before they could catch him.</p><p>"Whatever you're selling, we don't want it!" someone screams from inside. Remus keeps knocking on the door until they hear very loud footsteps approaching. A whale of a man was standing at the door. "What do you all want, it's late?! Go before I call the police!"</p><p>"Sir, we are not here to sell anything, we are here to see Harry Potter." Narcissa decided to take the initiative because Remus seems ready to kill someone. Draco was holding his arm with gentle restraint.</p><p>The man's face became one of disgust and hatred immediately. "There is no Harry Potter here! Go away, you freaks!" Narcissa put her wand on his throat with a soft smile on her face but her eyes promised painful murder. She has limits to her patience</p><p>"Sir, I don't appreciate someone yelling at me or insulting me," Vernon jumped out of her way but ended up against one of the walls. The others were surprised by this, she normally wasn't violent in the least, "now, you are going to find Harry immediately."</p><p>"Oh god, this is worse inside," Lucius said with disgust, standing behind his wife.</p><p>Draco was standing next to his father examining the entry way of the house. The decoration was poorly matched in an obvious attempt to appear a better social status and more elegance than they actually possess. They also seemed to have an unhealthy obsession with their son, wherever he looked there was a picture of that elephant of a boy. It was a bit alarming, the total lack of Potter in the place. There was absolutely nothing to say that he ever lived there. Draco would even be tempted to say that they had the wrong house if it wasn't for the family's reaction.</p><p>"Vernon! Who are these people? Our little Popkin is scared to death..." Her face turned white when she saw Severus, and with her high pitch voice screamed "YOU!"</p><p>"For the love of Merlin woman, stop screaming." he sneered "Petunia, I should have guessed that you would have the bad judgement of marrying this whale. Now since we don't want to be here any longer than necessary, show us where Potter is and be done with this.</p><p>"Now wait a moment you lot of freaks can not come to my home and demand things! First we get stuck with that horrible boy who only causes problems for everyone, and now thanks to him I have to have these freaks in my house! He should have done everyone a favor and died with his useless parents. " Vernon had the bad choice of shouting. Narcissa did not bother to listen to more of the insults of the man and cast a silencer spell on him, while the other three men had the opportunity to cast a couple of curses in his direction that would not be visible outside.</p><p>"Vernon! .... That monster is in his room" her voice was loaded with such disdain that it surprised Draco a little. He could not believe that these were the people with whom Potter lived, he already wanted to kill them and he hasn't known them for more than 10 minutes.</p><p>She took them upstairs to a door with at least 7 locks on it and a tiny cat flap at the bottom. She then proceeded to practically throw the keys at them and run downstairs.</p><p>"Take him far away from here if you want but be out of my house before we come back! " she grabbed her husband and elephant like child and disappeared as fast as humanly possible.</p><p>"This doesn't bode well" thought Draco while his father opened the door with a nonverbal spell. What they see makes them all turn white.</p><p>The room was not big enough to even be a decent closet. The walls were bare, it had one window with bars on it, no light, and a tiny bed with a bare thin mattress. What really caught their attention was the boy in the bed curled up holding his legs to his chest for dear life, hiding his face while lying in a pool of dried blood. His exposed back full of horrible scars a couple of the lashes still red and raw.</p><p>Narcissa could not stop the gasp that fell from her lips. Unable to grasp how someone could do something like that to another human being, much less to a child. Harry must have heard her because in a matter of seconds. He jumped from his position to the far end of the bed, looking at them with pure fear in his big emerald eyes that without his typical glasses looked larger. His face looked so childish even with his hollow cheeks.</p><p>"An angel?" Harry spoke in a low voice, feeling dizzy from moving so fast after losing so much blood. He was looking at the blurry white outline that was Draco, unable to see in his current state. "Did I really die?"</p><p>Draco blushed slightly at that, but his body moved before he could think. Slowly approaching the bed until he was next to Harry.</p><p>"No, you didn't die, Harry. We're here to take you to a safe place." He spoke in a soft tone that no one had heard before, Harry seemed to relax slightly.</p><p>Harry didn't completely register what was happening around him, but something deep inside him relaxed at that gentle voice and the calming scent that hit him once the figure pulled him close to their chest. He was suddenly feeling very light and safe for reasons he couldn't quite explain. Harry knew he was safe with this figure. Soon he was sleeping peacefully in Draco's arms.</p><p>All the others remained completely paralyzed trying to process what just happened. It must be a collective hallucination because there was absolutely no way they had witnessed a severely beaten Harry Potter letting himself be cuddled by Draco Malfoy. Along with the later being extremely delicate and gentle with the other boy. It all seems so out of the realm of possibility that none of them moved for a couple of minutes.</p><p>"You should find your things, we have to get out of here. Harry needs medical attention quickly," Draco said quietly but firmly enough to urge you to action.</p><p>"Remus, we should look for their things while Severus and Lucius look for the appropriate potions." Narcissa took him by the hand and led him to the dining room where she hugged him "Now he will be safe."</p><p>"How could they do this? He's only 15 years old ... I don't even want to think about what they did all these years." His wolf wanted to dismember all those who dared to harm his cub, he was having a lot of trouble holding Moony back.</p><p>"I don't know, but right now he needs us. We have to be in our best form" before separating she whispered in his ear "everything will be fine."</p><p>They used "<b><em>point me</em></b>" to find Harry's things. They opened the cupboard under the stairs and took the truck exchanging silent looks of horror at the small cot with bloodstains that was inside. Narcissa gather all of the child's drawings that were in a small box in the corner. Remus released Hedwig telling her where to go while Draco lifts Harry in his arms. Draco's mother linked her arm with his and they all apparated to the safe house.</p>
