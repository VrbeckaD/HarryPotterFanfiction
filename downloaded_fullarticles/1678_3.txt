    <p>They hadn't thrown him under the stairs.  There'd been a quick hushed conversation as they pulled the squalling thing in, past door jam and not more than an inch beyond what was needed to close the door.  The letter had been consulted, and once assured it was an it, because Freaks were its, not people, less than things, a consensus was met.  Not here, not our home.</p>
<p>Still they had to bring it in, for just a little, because what would he neighbors think, a blanket from the laundry bin muffled it's noise well enough and they went deeper into the heart of their home to decide.  </p>
<p>Or rather for Petunia to declare and Vernon to nod and tentatively poke holes into the glaringly obvious plan her spite might have left undone.</p>
<p>Thus the thing was left to linger,in draft, and a side door was consulted for that night and the day that followed.  Once the thing was nice and horse and tuckered from it's hollering and hunger it was a late hour.  Not suspiciously so but fashionably so, and assured that their neighbors weren't deviating from their habits it had been child's play to toss him in the back shed like so much rubbish, bassinet and all.  Murky plans of "finding him later" once exposure had carried it off had been decided on.  <br/>To better dissolve themselves of culpability they'd taken their little Duddly-kins out.  To see pumpkins and mock those dressed outre because standards must be set young.  A quick drop off of their little bundle of joy with Marge meant they could stay out longer, let weather really turn chill and catch whatever was most popular at the cinema.<br/>They came home to weather so crisp they could see their breathes.  A crinkle of frost under every step seemed a promise being kept.  Petunia nearly skipped.  And thus they happy family bundled so well that Petunia seemed to have a scratch of bulk bundled in.  Thoughts of hot cider and dinner on their minds.</p>
<p><br/>Come late, past evening news, before dawn, they recalled obligation.  Cycled through scripts, and once assured that all was in place Petunia decided she'd "heard something" and her lovely husband lovingly wrapped in layers would go out.  It would be as easy as that.</p>
<p>And if timing were wrong well they could just do so again and again, freakishness ran out eventually after all.  They could wait but check from time to time until nature took it's course.  And if it took too long... well there had been a promised freeze on the tele, easy as that.  Such simplicity would help keep their stories straight, sat it wasn't their fault that crazy cultists had left somebody's baby in the shed.</p>
<p>So as her husband went out she settled in front of couch and quiet tele, looking to events and what not going on about town.  If they must be a few days gone they start with something close to home and branch out from there.</p>
<p>With a grunt Vernon staggered out of his chair.  Once gravity had been vanquished it was a quick hunt for the keys, back pocket made errand complete, and as after thought he took the fire place poker with him.  Circling a muesem trip that sounded just wonderful Petunia hummed to herself as her husband lumbered outside.  A few moments later and a metal clatter got her to thinking about heading out.  It was likely just time of day and chill but freaks and their freakishness could never be trusted.<br/>With that in mind she'd decided to break out of their little script and slip outside.  A quick walk around the side of the house and she found her husband.  It was a quick walk past the sheet covered potted plants on the artfully placed path of faux stone.</p>
<p>The crispness had failed to a soft squelch, but she assured herself of winter yet to come, a promise from the weather man who was rarely wrong.  Still the wrongness under her feet made her look from forward to down and the street lights were enough that she could see red.  Wide streaks covered her little pathway.  Her view of ahead and down somewhat was cut off as Vernon stepped in front of her, saying.  "No Pet' go in."  in a shaky voice.  Picking up the poker he'd dropped she steeled herself, stepped about her husband and saw...</p>
<p>A trail of blood, something dragged, big by the width and heavy by the fact the span about the narrow do it yourself garden path was indented. The door of their shed was ajar, more red seeped from it's base.  A few quick steps, never mind they squelched and a nudge of the poker later and one mystery was solved.  The blood soused, it'd gushed like that awful awful horror story scene and within, mercifully dimmed but not dark enough to hide there was shredded meat.  Clumps of fur and other things splattered on the walls of the shed.  Iron and.. wrongness assaulted her nose, suppressing a gag she stepped back, her husbands thick hands caused her to turn about.</p>
<p>"Did you..."  She could barely talk, the poker wavered like mad in her hands.</p>
<p>"There's nothing in their but animal Pet'."</p>
<p>The dampness on her shoulder, from his hands, made awful sense.</p>
<p>"Call."  Sickness crowded her throat.  "Police, same but..."</p>
<p>"I'm not mentioning anything about anything I didn't just see."  Vernon vowed.</p>
<p>It was that step before sickness pushed out of the throat, that span where pressure and taste met but before expulsion... And Vernon shoved dirty dishes aside and set faucet to cool and hep her hair.  His touch gummed her hair and that made the fit last so much longer.  After what felt an eternity he patted her back gingerly.</p>
<p>"Pet?"</p>
<p>"Call."  She rasped.</p>
<p>He left then, to do so, and alone she cried.</p>
