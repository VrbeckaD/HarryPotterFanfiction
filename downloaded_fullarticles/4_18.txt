  <p dir="ltr">It was the 29th of August 1992, a woman by the name of Victoria Ivy Hawthrone was on her way to move to England from Boston, Massachusetts after having discovered her fraternal twin sister had attended Hogwarts and in fact lived in England. It was only four years ago she had found out by her wealthy parents that she was adopted and in fact, adopted by her mother's family friend who ended up marrying a wealthy business man in America. Finding out that her biological parents couldn't afford taking care of three children, she rather have someone she knew adopt one of the twins, that happened to be Victoria. Of course, Victoria was twenty-eight when she was told, but it took that long to inform her because they didn't have the heart to after hearing news of her twin sister, Lily Evans' death. She was now thirty-two years old. Both of her adoptive parents were muggles and was told, so were her biological parents but there was magical blood in her since her twin was also a witch, but muggleborn meaning so was she. Four years after finding everything out and once her contract with teaching History of Magic and Advanced Potions (which was for high ranking students) at Ilvermorny, Victoria was headed to England to apply for the position of History of Magic at Hogwarts. There was word that Professor Binns had finally retired there and this was a chance she was going to take. She had already sent her application and resume by owl to Hogwarts two days prior, in which she was expecting a response soon. After selling her house and things, packing up only personal things she needed, Victoria opened her door with a box in her arms when an owl had dropped a letter on top of the box she was carrying. Opening the letter, she read:</p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">' <em>Dear Miss Hawthrone,</em></p>
</div><div>
  <p dir="ltr" align="center">
    <em>As the headmaster at Hogwarts, I, Albus Dumbledore welcome you to teach at our school.</em>
  </p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">
    <em>Please take the directions attached to this letter as a pathway to Hogwarts and we eagerly await to meet you personally on August 30th in order for you to get set up for your position as the new History of Magic professor.</em>
  </p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">
    <em>Sincerely,</em>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p dir="ltr" align="center">
    <em>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore</em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="center"><strong><em>Hogwarts Headmaster</em></strong> '</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Victoria was happy to receive the letter in time before she headed out the door. She had opened her deep bag and magically placed the box into it, stacking it with the others inside that included her closet of clothes and had a separate luggage cart that held her teaching books and potion ingredients from work in her grip before making her way to downtown Boston. Reaching a closed shop in downtown Boston, she went to the alley beside it and apparated, having enough experience to apparate country to country without risk of splinching. Apparating to London, England, Victoria made her way through the crowded streets in her Cap Sleeve Laced-neckline black dress that went to her ankles, her long, loosely curled ginger hair laid over her shoulders and wore black heels to match on her long legs. She had permission from the ministry of magic to enter their wizarding world but still had to check in. Walking down London, she found the red phone booth, stepped inside and dialed what she was instructed in the attachment with her letter. The booth went down and led to the ministry. Once inside she made her way to the Administrative Registration Department, approaching the front. "I'm here to register myself, just moved from America and transferring from my job at Ilvermorny to Hogwarts." Victoria stated. The witch at the front desk nodded as she went to look at the files. "Name please? And present your wand." the witch asked. Victoria took out her 11 inch Cherrywood with Unicorn hair core wand, presenting it. "Victoria Ivy Hawthrone." Victoria replied. The witch took her file out, examined her wand and filled out the missing spots before stamping it as approved and updating her status. "You're approved. Have a nice day, Miss Hawthrone." the witch stated, handing her, her wand back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Victoria then made her way to Charing Cross road and entered the Leaky Cauldron, following the instructions she got. She made it to the brick wall behind the Leaky Cauldron and tapped it with her wand before it opened into Diagon alley. Victoria walked through the Diagon alley, watching as the students went shopping for their supplies before stopping in front of the book shop, <em>Flourish and Blotts</em> where there was a rather large crowd gathering. Apparently from the sign on the window, Gilderoy Lockhart was doing a book signing, Victoria couldn't stand that man -Lockhart's vanity and conceit sickened her. There was a family walking towards <em>Flourish and Blotts</em>, a ginger haired family with one kid that had dark hair. The dark haired kid spotted her and kept his gaze on her as if he saw a ghost of his mother before Victoria decided to walk off, feeling a little awkward, unknown to her that the dark haired kid was in fact her late twin's son, making him her nephew. Victoria then headed to Hogsmeade, apparating to the village. Upon arriving, Victoria noticed differences in the British wizarding world compared to the American wizarding world.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Stopping in the Three Broomsticks, Victoria looked around and imagined that her sister would've been there, ordered butter beer and everything. Of course, Victoria knew about her muggle sister Petunia, but figured she would take her time with easing in with her biological family, perhaps will visit when there's a break. Deciding against having a butter beer, Victoria left the Three Broomsticks and headed towards Hogwarts which was only about a twenty minute carriage ride. She saw the huge historic castle as the carriages approached, noticing its welcoming entrance before the carriage she was in came to a stop. Getting out of the carriage, Victoria walked up to the castle and entered through its doors. Her black heels clicked along the echoing halls of the castle as her luggage cart's wheels rolled along as she made her way towards the headmaster's office. As she turned the corner, an older woman approached her. "Can i help you?" Minerva McGonagall asked. Victoria stopped across from McGonagall and formed a gentle smile onto her pink lips. "Yes, I'm looking for Albus Dumbledore. I'm Victoria Hawthrone, the new History of Magic professor." Victoria explained. McGonagall remembered Dumbledore mentioning her but McGonagall didn't expect to see a woman that looked quite like Lily Evans from what she remembered of her. "Very well, this way, Victoria." McGonagall stated. Victoria followed McGonagall down the halls, entering the headmaster's office a moment before Severus Snape had turned the corner only seeing a glimpse of her ginger hair, not thinking anything of it as he headed down to the dungeons but of course heard of two new teachers for the subjects of Defense Against the Dark Arts and History of Magic. Entering further into the office, Victoria spotted Dumbledore behind his desk. "Come, come. You must be Miss Victoria Hawthrone, our new professor." Dumbledore stated. Victoria parked her cart behind her before taking a few steps more ahead. "Yes. I can go by Victoria or Tori, either one is fine." Victoria replied.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">McGonagall remained behind Victoria. "I never knew she would look so much like her sister, Lily Evans. It's remarkable." McGonagall pointed out. Victoria assumed she would consider that a compliment. "I don't know much about my late twin, but perhaps as i stay here teaching at this school, i will find out more what she was like." Victoria stated. Dumbledore nodded. "You very well may, Victoria. However, i assume several here at the school that knew your sister will be quite taken back seeing you. Do not be surprised. But i must inform you, your sister Lily did have a son and most know him here as the boy who lived...surviving the killing curse from Voldemort. His name is Harry Potter. I would imagine he would be overwhelmed but thrilled to see another relative other than your older sister Petunia whom is his guardian.  After reviewing your resume, I'm glad to announce you as our new History of Magic teacher. Arriving a day early is impressive, i must confess. Exactly, what house were you sorted into back at Ilvermorny?" Dumbledore explained, ending in question. Victoria was overwhelmed by what she was told about having a nephew at the school (apart from a muggle nephew) and one that held so much on his shoulders that she zoned out for a moment before coming back to reality. "Thank you, sir. I was in the house of the Horned Serpent." Victoria replied. Dumbledore thought over the attributes of that American house. "Horned Serpent...ah, alas i think that would be Ravenclaw house here at Hogwarts. Lily was a Gryffindor. Minerva will show you to your classroom and where your living quarters will be located." Dumbledore stated.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Victoria took her cart and headed out of his office with McGonagall. "Severus will be awfully surprised." Dumbledore said to himself. Exiting the headmaster's office from the tower, Victoria and Minerva went all the way back to the first floor to the History of Magic classroom. "This is your classroom and your living quarters is behind the door in your office. Office is behind your desk here in the classroom." McGonagall explained. Victoria took it in and nodded. "Thank you, Minerva." Victoria stated. McGonagall smiled softly, knowing this would be quite the shocker. "Make yourself at home. Your sister loved this school and I'm sure you will as well." McGonagall said before politely leaving. Victoria looked around the classroom before heading into her office and living quarters, getting unpacked as her dark green eyes studied the room. The following day, the professors began settling in more after summer break as Sprout, Trelawney, Hooch, Flitwick and others arrived along with the other new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart. Stepping out of her living quarters in her Slash neck long sleeve Lace Bodycon black dress and black heels into her classroom, she began setting up the classroom a little before heading to a brief breakfast in the great hall.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Upon entering, she noticed the boasting Gilderoy Lockhart to Aurora Sinistra. "Lovely." Victoria mumbled to herself, despising the fact that her fellow co worker was the vanity of all vanity, Gilderoy Lockhart himself. Choosing to ignore him, Victoria walked passed them to the food on the front table of where the professors would be sitting the following day, taking a plate and grabbed a muffin. She figured she would take her breakfast back to her office so she could concentrate on getting her classroom in order. Lockhart turned his arrogant gaze onto the ginger haired professor and eyed her figure in her black dress before making his way over. As Victoria reached for a green apple, Lockhart was practically in her face. "Ah, a green apple to match your beautiful, glimmering green eyes. I'm guessing you are new here as well as i." Lockhart stated. Victoria's green eyes narrowed at Lockhart in annoyance before a forced smile played on her lips. "Thank you, but I'm not very <em>keen</em> on being compared to fruit. But yes, I'm new." Victoria replied, clearly trying to avoid him. As she walked further down the table, she spooned some eggs and a slice of toast onto her plate before grabbing a cup of orange juice before Lockhart followed, laughing his ridiculous arrogant laugh. "Oh well, as you might know, I'm Gilderoy Lockhart. Author of my current autobiography, <em>Magical Me</em>. What may your name be?" Lockhart expressed further. Victoria sighed in irritation before rolling her eyes. "I'm Victoria Hawthrone." Victoria kindly introduced herself, then walked down the steps off the podium. "Nice to meet you, Vicky-" Lockhart stated being cut off. "-<em>don't</em> call me <em>Vicky</em>...it's Victoria or <em>Tori</em>." Victoria scolded. McGonagall stepped inside the great hall, witnessing the middle of it in amusement. "Okay, Tori." Lockhart corrected himself but stopped upon McGonagall's arrival as he watched Victoria's exit to her classroom.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">After having her breakfast, she began getting her classroom in order, stacking the textbooks on the shelves and putting her supplies in her desk as well as placing a little personal decor on the top of her desk such as a flower vase full of red roses and framed photos from home. She began working on the curriculum for the first week of school, what she would begin teaching and what she will assign. It went like that for the next five hours or so hours until dinner would be served. Victoria had skipped lunch as she was full from breakfast and was buried in getting set up for the first day of school. On the other hand, Lockhart and the other professors went to lunch. "Ah, where's Miss Hawthrone?" Lockhart asked McGonagall curiously. McGonagall knew that Lockhart had his eyes set on the ginger haired professor but would make sure she wouldn't be scared away. "She's far too busy working to be bothered, Gilderoy. Do enjoy your lunch." McGonagall explained sternly before walking off. Severus Snape couldn't help but overhear the conversation. "Should i be aware of who <em>exactly</em> Miss Hawthrone is?" Snape asked curiously. Lockhart laughed awkwardly. "Ah yes, Miss Hawthrone is the new professor here like i am. She's quite gorgeous actually-" Lockhart stated, cut off after watching Snape walk off in the midst of the conversation, rolling his eyes - Snape wasn't interested in Lockhart's adult puppy love stories. The hours passed before Victoria had once again gotten out of her classroom and gotten her dinner, as this time, Snape had been staying late working on setting up the potions classroom. Victoria had done her best to avoid Lockhart at dinner, having had her dinner with McGonagall in full conversation.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">It was now September 1, 1992 and It was the first day of school for the students. As the professors prepped their classrooms and gotten ready for the school year, Victoria had already been one step ahead of them in preparation. Victoria took the time to walk the halls of the school, looking around and imagining places in the castle where her twin would've been. She made her way to the Gryffindor house, of course not entering the common room but standing outside it as the portrait looked at her oddly, even some thinking they recognized her. As the hours passed, the professors entered the great hall before students arrived that evening.  Wearing yet another black dress with lace on the top and went to the knees with black heels, Victoria made her way to the podium table where the professors sat and took Binns former seat next to Sinistra whom was on Dumbledore's left while Lockhart sat next to Snape being on Dumbledore's right. Victoria of course ignored Lockhart's eager stares as she focused on the large great hall and had small talk with Sinstra before the students began crowding the great hall. As the first years got sorted, Everyone noticed the new professors as they remained sitting at the their tables. The Weasley twins Fred and George were too eying the new ginger haired female professor. "Looks like Professor Binns finally retired." Fred pointed out. George elbowed his twin brother. "Yeah, the new professor is fit. Wouldn't mind taking her class." George replied. Hermione overheard them and rolled her eyes, wondering where Harry and Ron were.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Once the sorting was finished, Dumbledore took the podium. "I have a few things i would like to announce...as always, the forbidden forest is off limits to <em>all</em> students. Professor Binns has also retired after countless years of teaching.  I would also like to introduce two new teachers to the school. Gilderoy Lockhart...who will be the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher." Dumbelore addressed, Lockhart stood up arrogantly as the twins rolled their eyes and Hermione seemed lovestruck. "And our new History of Magic teacher whom transferred from Ilvermorny located in the United States, Victoria Hawthrone. She had previously taught History of Magic and advanced potions while there." Dumbledore stated, looking back at her. Victoria stood up from her chair as everyone clapped, Snape looked over at her and froze on the spot, noticing her green eyes and ginger hair. The moment slowed as she waved at the students with a polite smile before sitting back down as he kept his piercing gaze on her. Snape felt as if he recognized her instantly as she reminded him of Lily, nearly a splitting image of her. Lockhart was looking at her as well before she sat down and turned his attention to Snape. "Isn't she a beauty? She'll come around to me, I'm sure." Lockhart stated, picking at his food. Snape finally removed his gaze from Victoria to narrow his gaze at Lockhart from his remarks. "Don't flatter yourself, Lockhart. It is a <em>school</em>...after all." Snape pointed out to Lockhart, keeping calm although he was irked by Lockhart having interest in Victoria. The students and staff remained eating as Victoria did as well, checking out all the professors along the table as they would be her new co workers. As she did so, her eyes instantly locked with Snape's for a moment, having caught his stare before he awkwardly looked away as he was still stunned by her. Victoria found Snape to be an interesting individual by appearance and felt slightly drawn to him but hesitantly looked away, especially when Lockhart caught her looking in that direction.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Victoria turned to Aurora Sinistra, curious as to whom that man was. "Who is that sitting next to Gilderoy?" Victoria asked curiously. Sinstra looked over to notice whom she was talking about before turning back to her. "That is Professor Severus Snape. He teaches potions here at the school...quite strict and keeps somewhat to himself a lot." Sinistra informed. Victoria nodded as she took it in. Snape definitely would be keeping his eyes on Victoria and find out what he can about her, even if he had to confront Dumbledore himself to find out.</p>
