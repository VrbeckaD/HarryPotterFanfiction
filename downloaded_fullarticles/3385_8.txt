</p><p>Harry grinned. For breakfast they made poached eggs with a corned beef hash, a recipe learned on one of their days helping out at a local deli. Harry met the owner, Irina Levin, about a year ago at the market, and she took the child under her wing. Under Irina's care and tutelage, Harry learned about exactly which cut of meat was the best and cheapest, which would last the longest and how to make them last even longer, and how to cook them. Harry was a quick study at cooking, and their efforts yielded results even the Dursleys were not displeased with.</p><p>Even Uncle Vernon, who was quite picky and liked to complain about even food that he liked, couldn't complain about the dish, and settled his need to maintain his power over Harry, sending him off with "well then, clean up and back to the cupboard, Boy."</p><p>"Actually, sweetheart," their Aunt Petunia began, "I'm taking Dudders shopping for clothes today, and I could use an extra pair of hands to carry the bags."</p><p>"Whatever you need, love," Vernon replied, with a smile that was almost a smirk.</p><p>Harry was pleased to be getting to leave the house, though, even though their few trips out with her and Dudley were always unpleasant. The Dursleys grounded Harry when a teacher scolding them complained that her hair had turned blue, and that was a few months ago by now. Harry was lucky when they managed to get out to the market for food, the deli was too risky an expedition. Harry didn't want to expose the Levins to the Dursleys' vitriol if Harry was found out.</p><p>Harry scrubbed the plates and washed the cutlery, timing their work to be finished just as Petunia finished freshening up. On cue, Petunia appeared, and Harry carried her things to the car, and then waited outside for her and Dudley. This usually took around fifteen minutes, so Harry passed the time meditating. Harry had taught themself how to meditate after Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had complained that it was a bunch of mumbo jumbo. Harry found it relaxing, and discovered that it made dealing with flashbacks and their relatives easier.</p><p>Sure enough, around fifteen minutes later, the other two showed up. Petunia unlocked the car, and Harry clambered into the back seat and sat as far from Dudley as they could. Luckily, the car ride was silent as Petunia didn't like noise when she drove and by now even Dudley followed that rule, having taken her warnings more seriously since her car crash a few years back. These trips usually started and ended at the two toy stores at the mall, crossed a few department stores, and a jewelry shop.</p><p>Harry eventually realized she stopped there each time in the hopes that Uncle Vernon might one day follow her to the mall and surprise her later with the item her eyes lingered on. He never did, but brought home garish pieces she pretended to love, but would somehow destroy or lose. Personally, Harry thought that was a terrible thing to do to someone, and resolved to never lose or destroy a present, no matter how much they disliked it. Harry never had a present to keep, since Irina's food didn't last forever.</p><p>Once they all reached the mall, Petunia kept a tight hold on Dudley and Harry followed, grateful that Dudley was a slow walker because otherwise she'd be difficult to keep up with. Dudley was quickly put in a bad mood when Petunia had pulled him out of the store early. Harry barely managed to maintain their poker face in spite of growing trepidation. Sure enough, in the very next store, when Aunt Petunia picked a shirt for Dudley he liked less than the one he wanted, Dudley went off.</p><p>"Mum, why does the Freak have to live with us?"</p><p>Their Aunt pursed her lips. "I'm sorry, Duddy."</p><p>Harry was used to this question, and wisely didn't interrupt. Dudley pushed them around the store and punched them once when Harry accidentally dropped one of his bags from the toy store. They were used to earning their keep, and said nothing. As usual, most people minded their own business, although Harry thought they saw a tall woman who happened into a number of the same stores frowning, but wasn't sure.</p><p>Aunt Petunia fed Dudley at the food court at the end of the trip, putting further thoughts of Harry out of his mind, something for which Harry was grateful.</p>
