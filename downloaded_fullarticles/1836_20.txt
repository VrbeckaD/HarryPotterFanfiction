  <em> Eleutheromania (n) </em>
</p><p align="center"><em><br/> </em> <em> an intense and irresistible desire for freedom </em></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">Hermione Jean Granger. Muggle-born. Born September 19, 1979. The brightest witch of her age - though that comes later. She was always an independent child, especially when it came to her schooling. Her peers, in particular, saw to that. They - her muggle classmates - thought her too smart, too much a teacher’s pet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the owl arrived carrying a letter to an unfamiliar school that claimed to teach magic of all things, Hermione felt excited for a fresh start with children her own age. She didn’t want her parents to be with her, however, in case they accidentally embarrassed her in front of somebody influential - so when it came time to purchase her school supplies for Hogwarts, Hermione traveled alone. The stern-looking Professor - “McGonagall,” Hermione recalled. - had given her directions to Diagon Alley and what to do once she arrived.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em> “Go to the bank first and ask to speak to Ragnok. He’s the leader of the Goblin Nation, and runs the Hogwarts Scholarship Vault,” the Professor had said. So that was where Hermione went first. </em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mr. Ragnok, sir.” Hermione started speaking again. She had just received an enchanted bag keyed into her new Gringotts vault filled with 20,000 galleons to get her through her first two years at Hogwarts</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em> “Economic inflation is a very serious thing, fresh-blood.” Ragnok had explained to Hermione’s shocked expression. He also explained that when Hermione chooses her electives for her third through fifth years she’d have to come back for a vault refill, and another one before her sixth and seventh year, if she hasn’t found a way to earn herself money by then. </em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, Miss Granger?” Ragnok answered. Did he seem to have taken a liking to Hermione, perhaps because of her good manners?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What would you recommend I buy first? I am…” Hermione paused to think of the right word. “completely new to this world and otherwise have no knowledge.” She asked the Goblin Leader. Ragnok grinned down at her, and surprisingly, she wasn’t as frightened by it as she expected to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Most fresh-bloods buy all of their items first, without something to carry them in. I would recommend you buy a durable trunk. Some sort of dragonhide, perhaps, with featherlight, impervious,  and automatic shrinking/unshrinking charms that can be activated by a tap of your wand and also keyed to your magical signature for maximum security” Ragnok replied.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Many thanks, Leader Ragnok,” Hermione curtseyed to the Goblin Leader - not a king. Said leader inclined his head before she departed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Upon leaving the bank, however, Hermione’s eyes were drawn to the shop right next door - the Magical Menagerie.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well it’s not as if getting a pet first would make much difference,” Hermione muttered to herself under her breath before opening the door to the shop.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Immediately an array of different sounds hit her. Different pitches of cats meowing; toads croaking every so often; there were even rats squeaking constantly. It was quite overwhelming - although not as much so as the orange creature that immediately leapt at Hermione the minute the door was closed again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh! I’m so sorry dear. Crookshanks never behaves, and it’s just gotten worse over the years.” The shopkeeper rushed over to Hermione, apologizing profusely, before stopping in her tracks when she heard the animal purring.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He’s absolutely ADORABLE! How much is he?” Hermione gushed over the creature in her arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You… you can have him… for free… if you really want him .” The shopkeeper stammered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really?! Thank you so much! I just want to pop next door and order a trunk for school, do you mind keeping him here for a little while longer? He looks intelligent, maybe he could help pick out supplies I’ll need to take care of him?” Hermione asked politely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, he is half kneazle. So yes, he is very smart. I’ll start a box for the items you’ll need. You go on ahead and get your school trunk.” The shopkeeper seemed to have recovered from her shock during her mumbling and quite literally shooed Hermione out the door in her eagerness to get the supplies for the now-owned half Kneazle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, Hermione was out the door of the Menagerie and through the doors of the shop next door, Wiseacre’s Wizarding Equipment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah hello, Miss. Hogwarts?” At Hermione’s nod, the shopkeeper continued speaking. “My name is Mr. Wiseacre or Mr. W for short.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hello, Mr. Wiseacre. I was told to get a durable, preferably dragonhide, trunk with quite a few enchantments on it. Can you help?” Hermione replied.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course I can help! Follow me to the back room - that’s where the trunks are stored.” As Mr. Wiseacre led Hermione through the shop, she saw most of the bulkier items on her list.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Right-O. First things first, we’ve got to decide what sort of trunk you’re looking for - how many compartments you’ll be needing. Are you more into fashion to where you’ll need a compartment strictly for wardrobe? A bookish type in need of a self-sorting library? A potions extraordinaire that requires a stable place to store your tools and ingredients? An apt herbologist with a knack for picking up plant clippings that need an immediate greenhouse? The possibilities are endless, my dear.” Hermione looked baffled at the samples Mr. Wiseacre rambled off.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, I do enjoy a spot of reading…” Hermione trailed off. Mr. Wiseacre grinned at her and motioned for her to continue speaking.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hermione left the store 5,000 Galleons lighter. The trunk cost 4,500 G and included: a pull-out, self-organizing library compartment, a potions compartment with stabilizing and preservation charms, a wardrobe compartment, and an expanded compartment for Crookshanks to play in as well as the normal compartment for the other school supplies.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The basic, one compartment, not enchanted trunk was 1,000 G. Each additional compartment without the enchantments were 500 - Hermione had four additional compartments - which brought up the price to 3,000 G total. The package deal for enchantments for a first-time trunk buyer cost 1,500 G as opposed to 2,500 G. The deal meant, for Hermione, that instead of 500 G for each compartments’ specific enchantments as well as 500 G for the enchantments on the outside to make it impervious to damage, feather-light, and shrinkable for easy transportation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The telescope, eagle-feather quill set, self-refilling ink pots in the colors black, red, blue, purple, green, and glittery pink (<em> ‘I doubt I’ll ever use that colour but it’s funny to know that I own it’ </em>), the quill maintenance kit, and five 10-foot rolls of parchment cost 500 Galleons altogether.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The trunk would be finished by lunchtime, so Hermione figured that she’d get her robes next.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she reached Madam Malkin’s Robes For All Occasions, Hermione gently pushed open the door after maneuvering around a man that was most definitely too large to be fully human. The bell at the top of the door tinkled and one of the two boys being fitted on the pedestals glanced at the front of the store.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I say, look at that man!” The boy with gelled-back blond hair said suddenly, motioning towards the window next to the door, his grey eyes widening ever so slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s Hagrid” The raven-haired boy replied. “He works at Hogwarts.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hermione walked towards the two, having seen a woman taking measurements of the raven-haired boy, and waited patiently for one of them to be finished. The woman looked up and saw Hermione waiting and offered a gentle smile, which Hermione returned.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, I’ve heard of him.” The boy who Hermione named Blondie, said. “He’s a sort of servant isn’t he?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He’s the gamekeeper.” was the response from the other boy, who Hermione named Raven.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, exactly, I heard he’s a sort of savage - lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed,” Blondie said. Hermione decided to interject.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I mean… wouldn’t it be quite difficult to control magic while drunk? I’m sure that isn’t completely his fault. Even though he shouldn’t be getting drunk around children anyways…” Hermione said. Blondie nodded his agreement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, see. Exactly. What sort of ‘gameskeeper' get drunk around children?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well I think he’s brilliant,” said Raven. Hermione noticed his tone getting more and more defensive as their conversation went on, but Blondie hadn’t seemed to notice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you?” Blondie sneered slightly, “Why is he with you then? Where are your parents?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They’re dead.” Raven’s tone was clipped.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh. Sorry. But they were our kind weren’t they?” Blondie asked, not sounding very sorry in the beginning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They were a witch and wizard if that’s what you mean.” came the reply.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even <em>heard </em>of Hogwarts until they get their letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in old wizarding families. What’s your surname anyways?” Blondie asked, but before Raven could respond, Madam Malkin told him she was finished and that he could leave.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Blondie turned towards Hermione and a calculating look came across his face - as much as an eleven-year-old could be calculating.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What about you? What’s your surname?” He asked, his tone accusatory.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Granger. My name is Hermione Granger. What’s yours?” Hermione replied slowly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Malfoy. Draco, Malfoy.” Blondie, now Draco, answered back. He looked like he wanted to say more but was cut off by the bell ringing again, signaling the door opening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah, Draco. Still, haven’t finished? Who is this young lady?” A man, who looked to be Draco’s father, walked into the shop.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“My name is Hermione Granger, sir. Would you mind answering a question I have?” Hermione addressed the man respectfully. When he nodded his head, she continued.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Draco was speaking to a black-haired boy earlier and brought up parentage… He said that the ‘other sort’ shouldn’t be allowed into Hogwarts because they haven’t been brought up in the wizarding world. Are there books that I could purchase that, as one of the ‘other sort’, would help me integrate better into this new culture I find myself in?” Hermione asked. The man stared at Hermione for a moment before answering.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Draco, you know better than to say those things in public. It's disgraceful. As for you, Miss Granger, you are very intriguing for a mu-ggleborn. My name is Lucius Malfoy, Lord of the Ancient and Noble House of Malfoy. I would like to extend an invitation to finish your shopping with my family and I today. I will be happy to refer some books to you on wizard culture and tradition.” Lucius Malfoy said. Draco looked ashamed of himself for disappointing his father, Hermione noted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s very kind of you, Lord Malfoy, but I don’t want to be a bother or burden.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nonsense. Father invited you. It’s rude to turn down an invitation” Draco butted in, seeming to have gotten over his shame rather quickly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh… Right… Sorry. In that case, I’d be honored to join you.” Hermione lifted her arms to allow Madam Malkin to take her measurements.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Granger… Where are your parents?” Lord Malfoy asked softly, glancing around the store and noting the lack of adults in the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I, erm, didn’t want them to come with me. I didn’t want to stick out more than I already do and I figured having them with me would make it worse. Plus I wouldn’t’ve been able to splurge on my trunk and spend 5,000 Galleons at the Wizarding Equipment shop. I doubt I would’ve been able to buy my new cat either. Half Kneazle I mean.” Hermione started rambling, causing the elder Malfoy’s lips to twitch in amusement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t forget to breathe, Granger,” said Draco.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh! Sorry… I, uh, ramble. When I get nervous…” Hermione explained, and then paused, “Why did you call me Granger? My name is Hermione.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, I…” Draco looked to his father for an explanation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s a sort of unspoken, well-known rule within the traditionalist circle in politics. A normal part of our way of life. You see, for us, it’s more respectful to - until you have permission from the other person to address them by their given name - refer to them by their family name.” Lord Malfoy explained.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh! Well then, in that case… Malfoy, you have my permission to call me Hermione. But only if you want to, that is. It’s entirely up to you, after all, you don’t really -,” Hermione cut herself off when Draco held a hand up to stop her from rambling too much.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Only if you call me Draco.” He said, smirking at her. Hermione grinned shyly at him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s both of you done as well dears. Just a Hogwarts set for you both?” Madam Malkin clarified.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, just a Hogwarts set. The fabric will be Acromantula silk imbued with heating charms. Their winter cloak and gloves will be dragonhide with the fur of a Mngwa lining the inside with heating charms as well. All the clothes need fire-proof, water-proof, and impervious charms.” said Lord Malfoy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course Lord Malfoy, these shouldn’t take too long. If you could pick them up around noon?” Madam Malkin requested. Lord Malfoy nodded his agreement and guided the two children out of the shop.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Draco, your Mother is waiting for us at Ollivander’s. After you and your wands find one another, I will suggest to your Mother that she take Miss Hermione to Twilfitt and Tattings for her to buy a new wardrobe to wear outside of classes at Hogwarts.” Lord Malfoy whispered in their ears.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The group of three walked down the street to a shop that was narrow and shabby. Hermione looked up at the name of the shop and saw the peeling gold letters that read Ollivander: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. There was a single wand resting on a faded purple cushion in the window.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Here we are. Come inside, children.” Lucius instructed, leading them into the shop.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hello, darling. Lucius, who is this young lady you brought with you?” An obviously high-born woman with pale skin, black hair, and grey eyes asked, kissing both Lucius and Draco on their cheeks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mother, please, we are in public.” Draco protested, a faint pink tinging his cheeks</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Cissy, this young lady is Hermione Granger. She was left here alone by her muggle parents, and wishes to learn more about traditionalistic pureblood society and our traditions.” Lucius spoke, resting his hand on Hermione’s shoulder. “I have invited her to finish her shopping with us and, should my instincts be correct, we will most likely sponsor her after this school year.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are your instincts ever wrong, my love? Miss Granger, I have a strong feeling that you will be a good influence on our little Dragon.” Narcissa replied, smiling warmly at Hermione for a moment. Draco scowled at the nickname.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good afternoon.” A soft voice said, making Hermione and Draco - though he will deny it later - jump.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good afternoon, Mr. Ollivander,” Lucius said cooly - he has a reputation to uphold of course. “We are here for two wands today.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ahh, Mister Malfoy. I remember your wand quite well. 10 inches, Elm, with a dragon heartstring.” Mr. Ollivander said, smiling slightly. Then he turned to face Draco and Hermione. “Which arm are your wand arms?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Draco held out his right arm, Hermione followed suit, seeing as she used her right hand in muggle school. Mr. Ollivander pulled out two, silver-marked tape measures and started measuring the pair of children. He measured them from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit, and around their heads.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance. We use unicorn hair, phoenix tail-feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s, or witch’s, wand.” Mr. Ollivander said, rummaging through long, skinny boxes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mr. Ollivander?” Hermione piped up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, dear?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You said you only use three cores for your wands. Have you ever had a witch or wizard who didn’t match with those three cores? What do you do when that happens? Is there another wand shop in London? Why do you only use three, surely there are other magical creatures in the world, right?” Hermione starting blurting out questions, not giving the wand-maker time to answer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hermione! You need to remember to breathe.” Draco said, laughing. Narcissa quirked her eyebrow at Lucius, who inclined his head slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“My dear child, there has never been a witch or wizard who has walked out of my shop without a wand. I’m sure there are many other wand cores in the world, but my family’s tradition only involves using phoenix tail feathers, unicorn hair, and dragon heartstrings.” Mr. Ollivander replied, pulling out two wands and offering them both to Draco and Hermione.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches, nice and flexible. Give it a wave, now.” Mr. Ollivander said to Hermione before turning to Draco, “Ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches and quite springy. Go on, try it out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hermione and Draco looked at each other before each waving their wands in the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No no no that won’t do. Wait one moment. I will return.” Mr. Ollivander snatched the two wands back before the two children could do anything. Mr. Ollivander returned with two more wands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Here try these. 10 inches, hawthorn wood, and a unicorn hair.” He handed that wand to Draco. Draco grinned after he grabbed a hold of it and waved it in the air. A shower of silver and green sparks shot out of the wand. “Oh very good! Now for you Miss. 10 and three-quarter inches, vinewood, and a dragon heartstring.” Mr. Ollivander handed the vinewood wand to Hermione, who felt a rush of power course through her. She grinned at the Malfoys and waved her wand. Silver and bronze sparks rained down and Mr. Ollivander cheered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That will be 7 Galleons each. 14 Galleons total.” He said, standing behind the desk near the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mister Ollivander… I would like to purchase two wand holsters for the children. To go on their forearms. Dragonhide, preferably.” Lucius drawled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course Lord Malfoy. That will bring your total number of Galleons to 34.” Mr. Ollivander answered. Lord Malfoy pulled out a pouch and from that pouch, the exact number of Galleons Mr. Ollivander requested. “Pleasure doing business with you, Lord Malfoy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lucius responded with an inclination of his head. When the group left the shop, Lord Malfoy gave one arm holster to Draco and the other to Hermione, whose protests he silenced with the rise of his hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let this be… a precursor… of what will happen if you do well enough in your first year to warrant a sponsorship.” Lucius explained.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright…” Hermione replied. “You mentioned me getting a new wardrobe?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Narcissa and Hermione exited the high-end clothing shop Twilfitt and Tattings, Hermione was 2,000 Galleons lighter and it wasn’t even the clothes that were the most expensive part of the trip! The most expensive part was the growing charms, fire/water/dirt repelling charms, and the equilibrium charm (to keep the wearer warm in cooler weather, and cooler in warm weather).</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you so much Aunt Cissa! I would have been so confused if I was alone,” said Hermione, feeling more confident about not sticking out in this new world with each shop she walked out of.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think that’s why Lucius waited until after you and Draco had gotten your wands. So I could help you while he took Draco to the Quidditch shop.” Narcissa pondered, leading the young girl down Diagon Alley.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hermione!” Draco called, waving his arm when he saw her. Hermione turned and saw Draco with his father, who looked very much like the Lord he was - standing tall while resting one hand on his son’s shoulder and the other on his walking cane. Lucius leant down to whisper something in Draco’s ear, which Draco nodded to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Father said we’re going to get trunks next,” Draco explained, looking up at his father. “Father, may we walk ahead?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Stay close and don’t get lost,” Lucius warned, waving them off.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We won’t!” Draco promised. He offered his arm to Hermione. “Shall we, Miss Granger?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hermione looked at his arm for a moment before accepting it and replying, “We shall, Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Did I mention that I’ve already ordered my trunk?” Hermione asked, glancing at Draco quickly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah I think you did, what sort of trunk did you order?” Draco answered with a question of his own.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I ordered a trunk with five separate compartments and they all have their own enchantments on them. There’s the regular, standard-sized school trunk with one compartment but then I added a library, a wardrobe, a potions station, and a play-area type compartment for Crookshanks, my new pet.” Hermione explained. The pair walked arm-in-arm with conversation flowing easily between them until they arrived at Wiseacre’s Wizarding Equipment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Granger! Just in time as well, I just finished setting the charms on your trunk, you’ll need to come back and pick out how you want the outside of it to look.” Mr. Wiseacre said when he saw Hermione walk in. “Oh and you made a friend! That’s wonderful! Did the two of you want to wait for the adults to arrive?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes please, Mr. Wiseacre,” Hermione replied, smiling up at him.  A moment later the door opened again, to reveal the elder Malfoys.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh! Lord Malfoy! It’s an honor to have such an esteemed member of the Wizengamot in my shop.” Mr. Wiseacre exclaimed. “If you and young Mr. Malfoy could come to the back room where I store the trunks?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, Mr. Wiseacre. Lead the way. Cissy, could you keep an eye on Hermione?” Lucius turned to look at his Lady wife.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, of course, Lucius.” Narcissa set her hand on Lucius’ arm and whispered in his ear before kissing his cheek and moving towards Hermione. Lucius set his hand on Draco’s shoulder and the two followed Mr. Wiseacre to the backroom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, Hermione. Would you rather stay here and wait for Draco to nit-pick exactly what he wants his trunk to be, or would you rather quickly go next door to collect your pet?” Narcissa asked the girl in question.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’d like to go collect Crookshanks if it’s not a problem,” Hermione replied. Narcissa nodded her head and motioned to the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I will accompany you and wait outside the door while you collect your pet and his accessories,” Narcissa explained, and the pair walked out of the Wizarding Equipment shop. Hermione smiled shyly up at Narcissa and walked into the Magical Menagerie.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Welcome back dear, did it take that long to get your trunk?” The shopkeeper asked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, no it didn’t take long at all. I got fitted for robes and bought my wand as well. But my trunk is finished so I came to pick up Crookshanks and the box of stuff. You did get a box, right?” inquired Hermione.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course dear. There’s a scratching post, an automatic feeding and watering station that’s charmed to not spill, a bed with a light heating charm on it, some feather toys, catnip, and a traveling basket with Crookshanks sleeping in it already. The total comes to 2,000 galleons.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hermione let out a breath. “It’s a good thing I won’t need to buy most of those things every year.” She explained while handing the shopkeeper the money.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“The box has a featherlight charm on it, dear, so it shouldn’t be too difficult for you to lift. Thank you for your purchase.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course! Thank you for waiting for me to return, and sorting the box out for me.” Hermione smiled at the shopkeeper and exited the store.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The street wasn’t as bustling as it was earlier so it was quite easy for Hermione to carry the box to the trunk shop.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Merlin’s ba-beard! That’s a huge box, Hermione!” Draco exclaimed when Narcissa led Hermione back into the shop. He seemed to have not taken as long as his Mother had anticipated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, but it has a featherlight charm on it. It cost me 2,000 galleons though. At least the only thing I’ll need to buy again next year is more food, and maybe more catnip.” Hermione said, chuckling a bit. She set the box down on the floor near the counter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Granger, are you ready to design the rest of your trunk?” Mr. Wiseacre asked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course!” She answered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The group of four left the shop. Hermione had her new trunk shrunken in her pocket. The outside of it was covered in Basilisk hide - something that, if it weren’t for Lord Malfoy, Hermione wouldn’t have known about - with black trim around the edge. The corners had gold plating on them, and the lock matched.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Each of the compartments had a unique password that when spoken out loud, allowed Hermione to open it with a touch of her wand to the lock. To access the library compartment, the password is Shakespeare in reference to the origin of Hermione’s name. The wardrobe compartment’s password is Twilfitt, the potion compartment’s password was bezoar - the Malfoy’s helped with that too - and Crookshanks’ compartment password was Kneazle. In order to access the regular ‘school supply’ compartment, the password is first-blood, in honor of Ragnok.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Draco’s trunk was similar to Hermione’s except he didn’t get a pet-compartment and his passwords were different.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let us move onto potion supplies, and then we shall head to Flourish and Blotts for your school books,” Lucius instructed the pair of children.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After purchasing their cauldrons from the cauldron shop, they made their way to the apothecary for the rest of the potion supplies. At Lord Malfoy’s request, the shopkeeper gave both children the first year Slytherin kit that had better quality and quantity of potions ingredients and tools compared to the regular first-year kit. At Hermione’s confused expression the shopkeeper pulled her aside to explain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“At Hogwarts the most hated and discriminated against House is Slytherin. I was a Slytherin myself, but the discrimination against Slytherins has steadily gotten worse over the years because of the War. I know it doesn’t make much of a difference, but Slytherins protect their own, so I keep the very best supplies for those who have the ambition to use them. Lord Malfoy can surely explain better than I, however.” Mr. Mulpepper explained quietly to Hermione.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That makes a lot of sense, actually…” Hermione replied. “Thank you for taking the time to explain that to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, anything for a future snake.” The potions supplier winked at Hermione. Lord Malfoy nodded his thanks to the shopkeeper for explaining that to Hermione.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So we’re gonna go fill up mine and Hermione’s library trunk-compartments now, right Father? Mother?” Draco asked, looking up at his parents.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, Dragon,” Narcissa confirmed, smirking at Draco’s scowl.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Flourish and Blotts was <em>easily </em>Hermione’s favourite shop. She wandered off, away from the Malfoys, into the nonfiction side of the shop, which was roughly two-thirds of the entire shop and consisted of different sections. The sections include Religion, Politics, History, The Arts, and Text Books for Hogwarts’ students.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, my gosh…,” Hermione muttered. The vast amount of books almost made Hermione’s mouth water.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You should see the library at the Manor, Hermione,” said Draco. Hermione turned and saw Draco smirking at her. There was a slim boy with curly, light-brown/dirty-blond hair and roundish glasses standing next to Draco. His hands were in his trouser pockets and he wore a similar smirk on his face as Draco did.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hermione, this is one of my best mates, Theodore Nott. Theo, this is Hermione Granger.” Draco introduced.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Granger? Related to the famous Hector Dagworth-Granger who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?” Theodore Nott questioned, raising an eyebrow at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, I don’t quite know for sure, but I’m certain there’s a way for me to find out. I must have gotten magic somehow, after all. It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Hermione replied, turning back to the bookshelves. They were in the religion section of the shop.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I never thought I’d see the day where Draco Malfoy would willingly associate himself with a muggle-born,” Theo commented.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Father thinks she has potential, and you know Mother has always wanted a daughter to dote on. She fits right in, really. Reminds me of you a bit, if I’m being honest. She has that bookish vibe about her.” Draco explained, looking through the books nearby. “Hermione. Over here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Theodore snorted. “Draco you’re useless. Here, let me help.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">About an hour later, Theodore and Draco had successfully helped Hermione gather all the books they deemed necessary for her - with some input from the Malfoys. The two boys had also picked up their own school books whilst helping Hermione. The worker stationed at the till spent 20 minutes helping Hermione, who ended up spending 1,000 Galleons just on books alone. After paying for them, Hermione moved out of the way and opened her trunk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Theodore whistled softly when he saw Hermione’s trunk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Five compartments?” he inquired.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah. A normal one for my school supplies, a library compartment, a potions compartment, a wardrobe compartment, and a compartment for my half-Kneazle to play in.” Hermione said, opening the library compartment with a whispered, “Shakespeare” and put all her school books on the top shelf with the rest on the shelves below.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do we have time to look through the stationary area?” Hermione asked, looking up at Lucius and Narcissa.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Narcissa replied. Lucius nodded his agreement and Hermione grinned happily.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Within the stationary section of Flourish and Blotts, Hermione found a selection of trunk-organizers. She meticulously went through the different styles and chose one that had space for her rolls of parchment, the loose-leaf stack of parchment she had just picked up, her eagle-feather quill set and the self-refilling ink pots, her telescope, and all the other bits and pieces she found interesting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I do believe that it’s time for lunch now, children. Theodore, would you care to join us?” Narcissa said suddenly, jolting Hermione from putting her things inside the trunk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, Aunt Cissa. I’d be honored.” Theodore replied smoothly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After their lunch, the Malfoys and Hermione parted ways with Theodore - who agreed to a first-name basis with Hermione. Theodore met back with his father at Ollivander’s while the other four returned to Madam Malkin’s for Hermione and Draco’s Hogwarts robes. Hermione put the package of clothes in her wardrobe compartment to sort through later.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is the last of the supplies I’ll need…” Hermione spoke softly. “Is there a way we can keep in touch? I’ll probably have questions about the books you recommended.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Father, didn’t you say I could get my own owl for Hogwarts? Can we get Hermione one as well? You’re a school governor, surely if <em> you </em>bought it for her, she could have two pets.” Draco asked his father.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hmm… There may be a way we could allow Miss Granger two pets.” Lucius said, smirking slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So that’s a yes?” Hermione asked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, it’s a yes. Can we go to the Owl Emporium now?” Draco replied, looking up at his parents.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t see why not. Come along then, children.” Narcissa replied for Lucius, tucking her arm in his elbow. Hermione did the same with Draco, although there was far less familiarity between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Seeing as my parents will wonder why I have two pets, I can just tell them that the owl is an early birthday present,” Hermione mused.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Early birthday present?” Draco asked at the same time Lucius said, “Don’t worry about your muggle parents. You’ll be with us soon if Cissa has anything to say about it - which she does.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes. My birthday is September 19.” Hermione answered Draco first before addressing Lucius. “What do you mean, if Narcissa has anything to say about it? Aren’t you the head of the household?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“My husband might be the face of the family, but I have just as much, if not more, say in what happens to our household. But enough of the subtleties of household politics, I will teach you about it before you graduate. We’ve arrived at the Emporium anyways.” Narcissa said, motioning to the shop overflowing with different types of birds - mostly owls. There were even cages with birds in them outside the shop.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Hermione wandered through the shop, one owl, in particular, caught her eye. Reading the tag beneath the cage, Hermione discovered that the owl that caught her attention was an Indian eagle-owl.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Found one you like?” The shopkeeper asked, walking up to Hermione.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes. I’d like this Indian Eagle-Owl.” Hermione replied. Lucius walked over to where they were talking.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is everything alright, Hermione?” He asked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, yes. I found an owl I like. This one here.” Hermione motioned towards the caged eagle-owl.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“An excellent choice. My father’s favourite owl was an Indian Eagle-Owl.” Lucius commented. “We’ll take this, as well as the Eurasian Eagle-Owl my son found quite catching.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, sir. That’ll be 20 Galleons for both owls. For another 6 Galleons, both children can have a package deal of owl treats and food pellets.” The shopkeeper said.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lucius handed over 26 Galleons to the shopkeeper and picked up two boxes each of owl treats and food pellets. Hermione and Draco each grabbed their respective owl cages and the group of four left the shop.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I suppose I should be heading home now. Thank you for inviting me to shop with you today,” said Hermione, faintly blushing as she ducked her head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course. Now, child. Did the professor tell you how to get onto Platform 9 ¾ from the muggle side?” Lucius inquired, lifting Hermione’s chin so she was looking at him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well… The platform is at King’s Cross Station… I, erm… I don’t recall how to get onto the platform, no,” was the stammered reply from the young girl.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Typical. They preach about having purebloods adjust to the Muggle world, but when it comes to the muggle-borns they don’t even tell them how to get on the train.” Lucius let a sneer cross his face. “To get onto the actual platform from the muggle side, you have to walk through the barrier dividing platforms 9 and 10. If you ask anyone else, they’d say to run if you’re nervous, however that just draws attention to yourself. The best way that I’ve been told to arrive discreetly is to walk up to the barrier and lean against it like you’re waiting for somebody to show up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Lucius…” replied Hermione, looking at the clock near the entrance of Diagon Alley. “I’ve got to go now, actually. I don’t want to miss the bus. Thank you again. I’ll try to find you on the platform. If I can’t, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, Draco.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The young Malfoy nodded in agreement. “Yeah. See you on the first,” he mumbled, watching her walk away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p>When Hermione got home, she was disappointed by the lack of interest her parents showed. She went to her bedroom, set Athena - her owl - in her cage on her desk, and unshrunk her trunk to put it at the foot of her bed. After letting Crookshanks out and unpacking her new wardrobe into the wardrobe compartment, she looked around the room. Hermione sighed. She had some reading to do before term started.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The first book she opened was one of the few ‘discouraged’ books about the history of the last war in the wizarding world. It was written by Eleanor Greengrass, one of Narcissa Malfoy’s close friends. It only took Hermione a few hours to read the entire text, but it seemed like it took ages.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Reading this reminds me of what I’ve seen on American news on the telle…” Hermione mused out loud.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lady Eleanor Greengrass wrote about what the Light-side claimed the Dark-side propaganda was - mass-murdering all Muggles and Muggle-born - when in reality the Dark Lord’s original plans involved completely separating the two worlds and bringing in muggle-born children earlier than age 11, however, that message got lost in translation over the years and became a huge disaster. She also wrote about how all Slytherins were being incorrectly labeled as ‘blood-purists’ and Dark-side sympathizers just because the Dark Lord was in Slytherin House when he attended Hogwarts. They were bullied, harassed, and discriminated against because of the color on their robes, and that discrimination continues after Hogwarts and is especially prominent in how the Ministry treats supposed Death Eaters in their trials - if they ever got a trial, that is.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hermione sighed and closed her book. <em> ‘I’m gonna have to owl the Malfoys before Hogwarts starts and ask about this new information.’ </em>Hermione thought.</p><p align="justify"> </p>
