"Don' do tha' Ol, it tickles."</p><p>Maxime smiled. "Ah, but ze art of love is very ticklish, is it not?"</p><p>Hagrid playfully swatted her hands away from his beard and said, "I would say tha' the ar' of love is more romantic than ticklish."</p><p>Maxime sighed. "As always my 'airy friend, you are right. Ze art of love is very romantic as you so kindly put it."</p><p>Hagrid replied, "Besides, we should be more focused on our task tha' Professor Dumbledore gave us."</p><p>Maxime smirked. "But, he won't know if we 'ave a little fun on the way, will he?"</p><p>Hagrid muttered, "I suppose no', but we should complete our task b-b-before we d-do the dirty business."</p><p>Maxime smiled. "Ah, but ze business is not dirty my 'airy friend, it is the most romantic thing in ze world."</p><p>Hagrid's face turned scarlet and he stuttered, "W-We should ge' going before the sun rises."</p><p>Maxime put her hand on his to stop him leaving the tent and told him, "We've been on our mission for one day, we deserve a rest, do we not?"</p><p>Hagrid sighed. "I suppose so."</p><p>Maxime snuggled into him and assured him, "We shall continue our mission tomorrow."</p><p>Hagrid smiled. "Ah alrigh' then, but only because you my gian' friend are very persuasive."</p><p>Maxime smirked. "I 'ave been told that many times before."</p><p>Hagrid whispered, "Where have you been all my life Olympe Maxime?"</p><p>Maxime chuckled. "Ze best wizarding school in France, Beauxbaton's of course."</p><p>Hagrid admitted for the first time, "I love you."</p><p>Maxime smiled. "I know."</p></div>
