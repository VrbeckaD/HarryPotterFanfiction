    <p>STORY TITLE: Two Sisters, No Waiting!<br/>PART: 01 of 03<br/>AUTHOR: Red Jacobson (redjacobsonfiction@gmail.com)<br/>DISTRIBUTION:  My Yahoo Group, FanFiction.Net, HP FanFiction Archive, Archive of Our Own, <br/>Hentai-Foundry, Questionable Questing<br/>DISCLAIMER: None of the Characters You Recognize belong to me, they all belong to JK Rowling and her publishers. <br/>SUMMARY: Harry needs two heirs (from different wives) by his 21st Birthday to continue the Potter and Black Families, Cyrus Greengrass is in a desperate situation.  Can the two of them help each other?<br/>FEEDBACK: Of course! It Makes Me Write Faster<br/>RELATIONSHIPS: Harry/Daphne/Astoria<br/>RATING: NC-17<br/>WORD COUNT: &lt;7,595&gt;<br/>SPOILERS:   None, if you don't know how the Harry Potter story goes by now, why are you reading this story?<br/>WARNINGS: If You've ever read any of my stories, you know what to expect, Oral, anal, Femme-slash, dom/sub, multiple partners, and Femme-cest.  </p><p>The Leaky Cauldron<br/>Thursday, March 23rd, 2000</p><p>Cyrus Greengrass sipped at his glass of fire whiskey and wondered how things had gotten so bad?  Voldemort was dead, and the last of his marked followers had either been sent through the veil or were in Azkaban for the rest of their lives, their vaults confiscated to pay for war damages.  So why was he sitting here staring at the potential ruin of everything his family had built for the last 15 generations?</p><p>He snorted bitterly, it was easy enough to understand, and if he weren't intelligent enough to realize it, the letters from his suppliers certainly made it clear enough.  His families vaunted 'neutrality' which had kept them alive and relatively prosperous through multiple Dark Lords had finally failed them!  </p><p>With Potter and his allies victorious over Voldemort, he had thought that the schism in their society would heal over.  It was a reasonable expectation, after all, that's what had happened every other time, but things were different now.  Granger and Longbottom were on a crusade to reform the government, and Weasley and his family were expanding their businesses, so anybody who wasn't actively fighting against Voldemort was looked at with suspicion, even if they had never supported the Dark Lord!    No one wanted to be seen doing business with him, or a few of the other families, and so he was looking at losing everything!</p><p>And just to add to the misery, that nundu buggering whore-master Flint was smarming around, offering to help him out of his current difficulties, all he would have to do was sign concubine contracts for his daughters!  As if he was going to let the two of them be used as whores for that bastard son of a troll and a sea hag!   No, he would sooner hit the evil little shit with a killing curse in the middle of Diagon Alley before he would let him touch either of his girls!</p><p>But, what was he going to do?   </p><p>Putting the glass down, he reached for the bottle in front of him before pausing, 'No, getting legless won't help me figure this out.  I need a clear head for this.'</p><p>Signaling for Hannah, the new bartender, he soon had a pot of tea in front of him, and, to his surprise, a copy of today's Daily Prophet.</p><p>Nodding his thanks, he picked up the paper and glanced at the headline.  'Potter is the new head of the Black Family?  Well lucky him!' he thought bitterly, 'wonder how much luck he's going to have finding a pure blood virgin to marry him?'    </p><p>He chuckled, remembering Orion cursing the requirements when they were in Hogwarts.   Finding a pure blood girl wasn't a problem at all, but finding one that was a virgin at 17?  That cut the numbers quite a bit, especially since most girls were taught to use whatever they had to get what they wanted.  That was why his friend had ended up married to that bitch Walpurga, nobody wanted to even try and shag that poisonous bitch!  No wonder Orion had taken so many mistresses over the years.</p><p>Lifting his cuppa, he started to take a sip when it hit him, Potter needed two wives didn't he? That could be a way out for his family, but he needed to talk to his wife and daughters before approaching him.  If either of the girls had any serious problems with Potter his idea wouldn't work. It would also mean leaving the family's neutrality behind, but that really wouldn't be a major hardship, he'd long wanted to take the family in a different direction after all.</p><p>Leaving enough to pay for his drinks and a  tip, Cyrus folded up the paper and left the tavern, apparating back to Greengrass Manor.</p><p>Greengrass Manor<br/>Thursday, March 23rd, 2000<br/>Two Hours Later</p><p>It actually hadn't taken long to convince Anastasia of the wisdom of his idea, since she had been friends with Charles and Angelina Potter when they were in school, before the divide between Gryffindor and Slytherin had become impassible thanks to Dumbledore's so-called leadership.   She had actually impressed him with her command of invective used to describe the entire Flint family when he told her about the “offer of assistance” and swore that she would poison him before he could even think about selling the girls to that festering boil on a giants scrotum!</p><p>Since he had absolutely no intention of even considering the idea it was easy enough to convince her that she didn't need to worry.</p><p>But now, he was waiting for his daughters to make their way into his study so he could ask them a question no father ever wants to have to ask his daughters.</p><p>There was a soft knock on the door, and he looked up, seeing Daphne and Astoria both standing there anxiously.  Putting a smile on his face, he waved them to the chairs in front of the desk.   He was still amazed at the differences between the two girls, Daphne, as blonde as her mother, with ice blue eyes, while Astoria took after his side of the family with her dark hair and brown eyes, but they both had their mother's beauty fortunately.</p><p>Seeing the girls were nervous, he cleared his throat and said, “Thank you for arriving so quickly, girls.  I'm afraid this is going to be a rather embarrassing conversation, but I have a reason for asking this question, which I will explain before we are finished.”</p><p>Daphne just raised an eyebrow in question, while Astoria just looked a little confused.  Deciding to just tear the bandage off and get it out there, he said, “Are both of you virgins?”</p><p>From Astoria's gasp of shock and flaming blush, he was certain that at least one of his daughters qualified, but Daphne's reaction was far more shocking.  His elder daughter daughter gave a rather indelicate snort and said, “Really, Father? I didn't think you would be interested in my sex life!”</p><p>Cyrus closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, “I really would much rather not have had to ask that question, but, please, spare me the details.”</p><p>Opening his eyes again, he said, “Hopefully this won't be as embarrassing for any of us, but, what are your thoughts on Harry Potter?”</p><p>Astoria spoke up eagerly, looking far younger than her 18 years, “Harry? He's really nice!  When a couple of Gryffindor's were giving me a hard time for being in Slytherin he stopped them and ripped them apart, he does sneering and sarcastic almost as well as Daphne does!”</p><p>Cyrus nodded, that was good to know that he was on  friendly terms with at least one daughter.  Turning to Daphne, she shrugged, “I don't know him all that well, I was friendlier with Granger because we were in several classes together.  He kept to himself most of the time, but, unlike Weasley and Finnegan and the others, he didn't seem to have a problem with those of us who were left in Slytherin.  Why are you asking? Did he make an offer for the two of us?”</p><p>“Would you object if he did?” Cyrus asked, not answering her question.</p><p>Daphne shook her head slowly, “No, not really, he's got decent manners and a great deal of power, but he doesn't seem to know how to use it, and his strength goes without saying.  If he had made an offer, I wouldn't mind at all.”  She grinned quickly, “Of course, you don't even need to ask 'Stori, since she's had a crush on him since the Night of the Dementors!”</p><p>Looking at Astoria, she was still blushing slightly, and it drew a slight grin from him, it seemed that his older daughter was correct about a crush.  That would make it easier, but now he had to contact Lord Potter.</p><p>Feeling Daphne's eyes on him, he said, “No, Daphne, Lord Potter hasn't made any offers, however, I saw in this morning's Daily Prophet that he is now the head of both the Potter and the Black families, and so he would require an heir for both houses.   I'm going to send him a letter requesting a meeting and offering the two of you as potential wives.  I'll be blunt, if the family weren't in the straits we are currently in, I wouldn't even consider making an arrangement like this, instead I would allow you to find your own husbands, the way your mother did.  But, this is not a normal situation, and, since the two of you don't seem to have any objections that can't be overcome I will be moving forward.”</p><p>The two girls nodded, they were aware that things had been uncomfortable for the last year, but didn't say anything as they got up and left the room.  He knew that Astoria would be pestering her sister about who she had slept with.  He honestly wasn't that surprised that Daphne had taken a lover, but he really didn't want to know any of the details.</p><p>Grabbing a fresh sheet of parchment, he picked up a quill and started to write.</p><p> </p><p>Daphne's Room<br/>A Few Minutes Later</p><p>Cyrus would probably have been amused if he had seen his two daughters after they got into Daphne's bedroom.  He had guessed his youngest daughters reaction almost exactly.  The door had no sooner closed behind the two of them when Astoria was bouncing around like a Gryffindor on a sugar high.</p><p>“So who was it Daph?  Who did you have sex with? It wasn't Draco was it?” Her face screwed up in a scowl, “Please tell me it wasn't Draco, that would be nasty!”</p><p>Daphne laughed and cuffed Astoria affectionately on the back of the head, “No, it wasn't Draco, or any of the others in Slytherin.  Do you really think I would let any of those creatures touch me?”</p><p>“Then who was it?  I don't remember you paying attention to anybody in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw.... was it a Gryff?”  She must have seen something on Daphne's face because Astoria broke out into a wide grin.  “It was!  You shagged a Gryffie!  Who was it?  I know it wasn't one of the Weasley's, there isn't enough alcohol in the world to make them desirable, so who could it be...   Potter?  Did you actually have sex with Harry?”</p><p>Daphne had been watching her sister bouncing around the room as she fired out the questions, and finally had had enough.  Fun was fun but this was getting tiring.  Drawing her wand, she petrified her younger sister and moved her to a chair before releasing the spell.</p><p>“There! No, if you can manage to sit still for five minutes and not interrupt, I'll tell you who it was.  And no, it wasn't Potter, although I have heard a few stories about him.”</p><p>Astoria mimed sealing her lips and sat back in the chair, her hands in her lap, the very image of a demure young lady, even with the corners of her mouth twitching as she tried to keep her face impassive.</p><p>“Okay, so it wasn't Potter, it was Longbottom.    It was during the last few months that Snape was in charge, and I saw him coming back from from one of the Carrow's detentions.  He really looked bad, bleeding from cuts all over his face and hands, and I remembered that he had gotten the detention helping out Evendine Alberts, remember her, the half-blood girl who was a first year in Slytherin?  Anyway, I knew that Draco and his goons were patrolling, and if they found him it would have been uglier than usual, so I decided to help him.”</p><p>Astoria was listening, fascinated, and Daphne continued, “I managed to get him into one of the empty classrooms and started healing him up, and, I don't know how it happened, but I could feel the anger and magic flowing through him, and it affected me somehow, I realized I was wetter than I had ever been before!  I didn't even think about it, I locked and silenced the door, and then I was kissing him, and he was kissing me back!  We were naked before I even realized what I was doing, and he was pushing inside me, and there was no pain at all, it felt really, really good!”</p><p>Daphne closed her eyes, remembering the way he felt inside her, and the way the wood of the desk had scraped against the bare skin of her back, but she didn't care.  He was kissing her and she was kissing him back, and they were moving together and everything else fell away....</p><p>“It was over way too soon, the first time anyway, but we managed to get together a few more times, and it got better every time.  We finally ended things after Voldemort was dead, because we both wanted more out of life than just shagging, no matter how much we enjoyed it.  We really weren't compatible with our clothes off.”</p><p>Opening her eyes, she smiled slightly and turned to look at Astoria, who had a slightly glazed look in her eyes and her mouth was open slightly as she was picturing what had happened.  Daphne had to hold back a laugh, her innocent sister wouldn't believe what the two of them had gotten up to in the times they were together, although Hannah Abbott had made a point to quietly thank her after she and Longbottom had gotten together.</p><p>She briefly regretted that things with Neville hadn't lasted, because he would have been very helpful in getting their family back on it's feet, but he just wasn't strong enough for her to commit to, so it was best that he stay a fond memory.</p><p>Greengrass Manor<br/>Saturday, March 25th, 2000<br/>Just after Noon</p><p>Cyrus was actually favorably impressed with the  young Lord when he arrived, precisely on time.  Cyrus had heard that the young man had been raised by muggles, but, if so, he had found an excellent tutor since then, because his manners were impeccable.   After joining the family for the afternoon meal, where he had successfully charmed Anastasia as well as his two daughters, the two of them adjourned to his private study to discuss the reason he was there.</p><p>“Lord Potter-Black, thank you for accepting my invitation.” Cyrus said as the door shut behind him.  “It was nice to see you again in much friendlier circumstances than the trumped up charges Umbridge and Fudge decided to try you on several years ago.”</p><p>Lord Potter nodded, smiling slightly, “And, if I remember correctly, you were one of the ones who voted to acquit me, which I did appreciate, even if I had no idea at the time who you were.”  Leaning forward in his chair, he said, “Now, I believe your invitation said that we could be helpful to each other, and with the way that Daphne and Astoria presented themselves, I gather that you are aware of the requirements for two of the houses I'm responsible for?”</p><p>Cyrus raised an eyebrow, “Are there other houses besides Potter and Black? I was only aware of the two of them.”</p><p>Harry shook his head, “No, I've got three others, but I have several years before I need to make a decision about them, fortunately.  Now, I'll admit that I find both of your daughters attractive, and, while I don't know either of them all that well, for reasons that I'm sure you understand, I do know that neither of them were followers of Malfoy and his sycophants, which would be an absolute deal breaker.  So, I'm asking, what do you need from me?”</p><p>“Lord Potter-Black, the Greengrass family has long prided itself on it's neutrality, and for several generations that served us well.  That is no longer true, and I wish to align the family firmly with the light side, having seen what those of the darker houses would do when they are unchecked.  To that end, having you marrying my daughters would make a statement that could not be refuted.  This would allow the family to prosper again, and would provide you with allies in the Wizengamot as you, Lord Longbottom and Miss Granger work to change society.  In return, I would ask a bride price of 5,000 galleons each for my daughters, and your willingness to have a second son to carry on the Greengrass name.”</p><p>Harry nodded, “That's a reasonable offer, but I would like to know, have you asked your daughters if they would wish to be married to me?”</p><p>Cyrus chuckled, “Do I look a fool, Lord Potter-Black? I discussed it with both my wife and my daughters before I sent the invitation.   All three of them, my youngest daughter especially, are in favor of the idea.  Daphne has said she doesn't know you all that well, but has a generally positive impression of you, which I can guarantee was only improved by your demeanor during the meal, and Astoria seems to have developed a bit of a crush on you after all the madness of your years at school.”</p><p>Harry smiled, “I'm glad that you consulted the three of them, it makes me more comfortable with the idea of aligning with you and accepting your offer.  In fact, I was aware of the difficulties your family has encountered since the end of the war, and have included a possible solution to them in the contracts I had my solicitors prepare once I got your invitation.   </p><p>“I'll let you read them in just a moment, but you'll find them to be the standard contract that the Potter and Black families have used for generations.   The key points are that I am actually offering you 10,000 galleons each for your daughters because to do otherwise would be seen as an insult in certain circles.  I'm also willing to grant an interview to the press about the respect I have for the Greengrass family and their support, going back to the trial.   That should see your reputation start to return to it's previous status.”</p><p>Cyrus stared at the young Lord in shock, he hadn't expected that level of honor, not to mention the generosity! He was about to start thanking the young man, but Lord Potter-Black held up his hand before he could say anything, and he continued speaking, </p><p>“However, there are certain things that I require from my wives, and I would need to speak to them privately before we sign any contracts.  If they are comfortable with what I will ask of them, then we can sign the contracts this afternoon and they will leave me.  If not, I'm still willing to assist you financially and invite you into the Potter-Longbottom Alliance but that will be the limit of our connection and I will contact my next choices for the Potter and Black families.”</p><p>Cyrus nodded, “Of course, that's understandable, I had a similar conversation with Anastasia when our parents were discussing a possible marriage.   If you will give me a moment or two, I will have the girls join us and I will leave you to your discussion.  Do you mind if I take the contracts with me to read over?”</p><p>Harry nodded and he left the room, returning a few minutes later with Daphne and Astoria.   Leaving the three of them in his study, he closed the door behind him and went to speak with his wife.</p><p>A few minutes later</p><p>Harry grinned at the two girls as they sat down across from him, and he said, “Okay, I hope the two of you don't mind, but I've had about all the formality I can handle for one day!  Your father told me that he had discussed offering the two of you to me as my wives, is that true?”</p><p>Daphne nodded, “He did, and both Astoria and I are both in favor of the idea.  But, if you don't mind me asking, since we are going to be informal, how do you want us to address you?”</p><p>“Just call me Harry, and I'll call you Daphne and Astoria, or do you prefer something else?”</p><p>Astoria grinned, “Just call me 'Stori, it's less of a mouthful, and when somebody called me Astoria I think I've done something wrong.”</p><p>Daphne snickered, “That's because it's usually the truth, brat!”</p><p>Her sister very maturely stuck her tongue out at Daphne, making all of them laugh, and Harry said, “What he did not know, was that you will not be my only wives, I'm also responsible for continuing three other families as well, but I have several years before that will be an issue.”</p><p>Daphne looked at him curiously, “Do you mind if I ask what other families you will be continuing?”</p><p>“The Peverell family, I am actually the last surviving member of the family through Ignotus, who married into the Potter family several hundred years ago, the Slytherin family, due to my defeat of the last Heir, and, one other.” He grimaced, “the last family is actually the Dumbledore line, which I'd just as soon let die out after Abe passes, but you know how the laws work, if I continue one line I have to continue all of them!”</p><p>Astoria gasped, “That means you're going to have to have consorts and concubines for all the families too, doesn't it?”</p><p>He nodded, “I would really love to know who came up with these asinine laws, and how they justified them in order to get them passed, but, yes, I've already got a fairly good idea of who I will ask to be consorts for the Potters and the Blacks.”</p><p>Daphne frowned, “I hope you don't take this the wrong way Harry, but, can you please tell me that Granger isn't one of the women you are considering?”</p><p>Harry laughed, shaking his head, “No, as much as I love Hermione, she and I would drive each other insane if we tried to make a relationship work.   We are the best of friends, and will probably always be friends, but that's the limit of our relationship.   Besides, I think that she's been talking to Neville and Hannah about becoming his wife for the Lestrange family, to try and bring that family back to what it used to be before Grindelwald and Voldemort took them down the wrong path.”</p><p>“Actually, you know the witch that I'm considering for the Potter family, considering that you roomed with her for eight years.   It's Pansy Parkinson, which will really drive the albino ferret spare if he ever hears about it.”</p><p>Daphne choked, “So you were the guy she was shagging?  I knew she was seeing somebody, because she always had a satisfied smile on her face when she snuck back into the dorms, but she'd never say who it was.  It drove Draco crazy, because she never let him touch her, even with the betrothal contract Lucius was trying to get signed.”</p><p>“Did she?  I'll have to think of a way to reward her for that.  But yes, Pansy and I were lovers from the night of the Yule Ball.  And, if you know that much about her, I'm sure you know what I will be expecting from both you and 'Stori.”</p><p>Daphne looked at him uncertainly, “I've never actually been buggered, doesn't it hurt?”</p><p>He shook his head, “I've got more than enough experience that I will promise you that you will enjoy it, don't worry.  Pansy and Luna were both virgins the first time, and both of them loved the experience.”</p><p>“Okay, but, did you really have Pansy having sex with other girls?  She always looked down on the girls in the dorms who shared a bed.”</p><p>Harry chuckled, “I think that was mostly because her parents were very conservative about things like that, she didn't even blink when I had her kneeling in front of Fleur or the other girls.”</p><p>She laughed, shaking her head in disbelief, “Fleur? Delacour? The Beauxbaton's Champion?  Damn Harry, how did you manage that?  Hell, I would have shagged her if I'd had the chance!” </p><p>He just smirked and said, “You'll probably get a chance to ask her yourself one of these days.  But, we've gotten away from the subject at hand.   Yes, I'm going to be buggering both of you, and will also be expecting the two of you to pleasure each other as well as myself. Do either of you have any problems with the idea of having sex with each other?”</p><p>The two girls glanced at each other and blushed, but didn't seem to have any objections.  He briefly wondered if his magic was already affecting them or if they were just as kinky as the other pure blood witches he'd bedded?  Hestia and Flora certainly had no problems going down on each other when he'd suggested it, and Padma and Parvati were grinding against each other practically before he got the words out!   That was something to look into in the future, but now he needed to make sure they understood the most important part of being married to him.</p><p>Relaxing his grip on his magic, he let it fill his body and reach out for the two of them.  He could almost see the magic of Daphne and Astoria reacting to his power as he started speaking,</p><p>“Now, one thing that I want to be very clear on, I know that it's almost expected that wives manipulate their husbands so they can get what they want.  I will not tolerate that sort of behavior, is that understood?  I had enough of that from Dumbledore and Molly Weasley and will not accept it from either of you!  If you want something, talk to me about it, I'm not unreasonable, but I am the head of the Family and I will be in charge.  If you try to manipulate me, I can promise you won't enjoy the consequences, are there any questions?”</p><p>Both witches shook their heads, and his magic flowed around them, caressing them and sinking into their bodies, merging with their own magic and becoming part of them.  He nodded, the family magic had accepted them already, the rest was just a formality.</p><p>Stepping back, his eyes looked between the two, the blonde Daphne with her curves and a hungry look in her eyes, and slender Astoria, her dark hair hanging over her shoulders, nervous but trying not to show it, both of them trusting him not to hurt them, and he swore that they would never regret joining his family!</p><p>He softly said, “You two are absolutely amazing, and I'm very glad that you are my wives, and will be mothers of our children.  I'm sure it goes without saying, but it should be obvious that I don't hold with the tradition that says sex between husband and wife is only for the purpose of having a heir.  The two of you can expect to be having a hell of a lot of sex on a daily basis.  You can plan on spending time on your knees, on your back and on your bellies, usually cumming your brains out, a great deal of the time.” </p><p>Taking a breath, he continued, “That doesn't mean that I will expect you to have sex when you aren't in the mood, or are too tired, or not feeling well, but, to be blunt, don't be surprised if you are randy a lot of the time once we marry.  Both the Potter and the Black family magic seems to have that affect on the members of the house, as I'm sure you noticed Daphne, all the times you watched me disappearing with different girls over the last couple of years at school.”</p><p>Harry suppressed the urge to grin at the blush on Daphne's face and the curious look on 'Stori's, and said to the younger girl, “I'll tell you about it later,”  before addressing them both.  “So, do either of you have any problems with what I've said so far?”</p><p>Both girls shook their heads quickly, and Daphne licked her lips slightly, her eyes smokey.</p><p>“There will be times that I wish to tie you to bed drive you out of your minds with pleasure, until you are begging to be allowed release, and when I finally let you cum, you pass out from sheer pleasure.  Do either of you have a problem with anything I've described to you?”</p><p>He watched Astoria as she flushed in excitement at everything he was describing, and knew that she would be eager to learn, just like her sister.  He already had a fairly good idea of just how much experience Daphne had, she and Neville hadn't been anywhere near as discreet as they thought they were being, and he had seen the sexy blonde on her knees in front of his fellow Gryffindor on more than one occasion.  </p><p>The girls kept silent for several seconds, and Harry asked them again, “Is there anything that I've told you I require that will be a problem for either of you?”  And when the two of them shook their heads, he smiled and stood up, “Well then, let's go join your parents and make the two of you Lady Potter and Lady Black, what do you say?”</p><p>Twenty minutes later the girls were hugging their parents and then taking the Floo to Potter Manor.</p><p>Potter Manor<br/>Twenty Minutes Later</p><p>Astoria couldn't believe things were moving so quickly!  After briefly being introduced to Harry's elves, they found themselves up in the Master bedroom, and without even using his wand, Harry had all three of them stark naked.  Granted, it wasn't the first time she had imagined being naked with Harry, but usually it was just the two of them in the room, Daphne wasn't involved.  But this was reality, and now Daphne was her sister-wife as well as her sister, and, from what Harry had said, she was going to be her lover as well.</p><p>That idea didn't bother her as much as she thought it would, surprisingly.  She had played with girls before, just about all the girls in the dungeons did, but hadn't really considered having sex with her sister before.  She probably should have, considering the gossip she picked up from Romilda during cuddle time about some of Harry's adventures in school. </p><p>Apparently she and Daphne were only the latest in a series of sisters he'd had together.  The Patil twins weren't that big a surprise, since Parvati was known to be an absolute hedonist and could be counted on to bring her sister in on whatever she was doing, but the Carrow twins?  That was a shock!  The two of them had made no secret of their disgust at the relationship between their Father's sister and brother, Amycus and Alecto.  But from what Romilda had been able to find out, Harry had the two of them tonguing each other within minutes of getting them naked.  </p><p>It was Romilda's comment about Harry making all the girls shave that had her shaving herself bare, and suggesting it to Daphne.  She was glad that she had, because Harry's eyes lit up when he saw her, and Astoria would swear that his cock got even bigger! And that's when things really escalated!</p><p>The next thing she knew, Daphne was kneeling between Harry's legs, licking and stroking him, and she had her arms around her older sister at Harry's direction, one hand playing with her breasts and the other rubbing Daphne's wet pussy.  Astoria had to admit that she enjoyed the feeling, hearing the moans and sighs coming from her always controlled older sister, and knowing that it was her fingers, and her mouth as she sucking on Daphne's earlobes, that were causing them.  </p><p>She could hardly believe what she was seeing as her sister, who hardly ever showed emotion to anybody that wasn't family was smiling widely as she licked his head and shaft, before locking her lips around him and sucking.  And the way Daphne was moaning when she opened her mouth?  It was obvious that Daphne was loving what she was doing, and her excitement seemed to be contagious, because Astoria felt her mouth watering and her pussy starting to tingle as she watched.  She had practiced sucking some of Romilda's toys, so she was sure that she would be able to pleasure Harry, but she didn't really understand why Daphne was getting so much pleasure out of it?</p><p>Minutes later she saw Harry tense up and he growled out Daphne's name before her eyes went wide and she pulled back so that just the head was in her mouth before starting to swallow.  Astoria was still holding her sister, stroking her pussy when Daphne stiffened and took her mouth off of Harry, throwing her head back and crying out in ecstasy! </p><p>She barely realized what was happening, because Harry was still cumming, and, without even thinking about it, Astoria released Daphne and leaned forward, locking her mouth around him and taking a burst of his cum in her mouth.   She didn't even notice the taste, because all she could feel was the magic in his seed, and she swallowed eagerly, her own magic flaring to life inside her.  It was then that she noticed the tingling from her pussy had magnified and was shooting all through her body, and waves of pleasure were pulsing from the tips of her toes to the tops of her ears, and it was the most amazing thing she had ever experienced!  The pleasure kept building and building, until finally it overwhelmed her and she opened her mouth, falling back on the carpet as she came with a keening wail and then knew no more!</p><p> </p><p>A few minutes later</p><p>If Astoria or her mother would have asked her earlier that day what her wedding night would have been like, Daphne probably would have told them about wearing a white silk night robe, and being carried to the luxurious bed, with candles floating around the room, providing the only light as she opened herself to her husband for the first time.   She might have even made them believe that she was looking forward to a night like that, if she was a very good actress.  She certainly wouldn't have told them what she really dreamed about when she thought about her wedding night, but fortunately, it seems that she didn't have to tell her husband what she truly desired, he seemed to know already!</p><p>From the second that Harry had gestured, and she stood there, naked and hairless before him, Daphne knew that her husband would be the man to make her dreams come true!   And when she was on her knees before him, and her sister was fondling her body, it was all she could do not to moan in pleasure as he managed to pull some of her deepest fantasies from her soul!    He was making her experience things that Neville would never have imagined, even though he had become an excellent lover.  The Longbottom Heir didn't have the command of his magic to truly satisfy her, even though he did his best.  He just couldn't compare to the man she was worshiping, and Daphne couldn't be happier!</p><p>She had barely recovered from the massive orgasm that swallowing his cum had given her when she felt his eyes on her, and, looking up, saw him gesture to her sister, who was still shuddering from a climax of her own.  Seeing the cum on Astoria's lips and face, Daphne didn't hesitate, she moved on top of the younger girl and started licking Harry's seed away, enjoying the shivers of pleasure from the magic that was still in his cum, and soon found herself snogging her sister, who responded eagerly.  She probably would have continued kissing the other girl if Harry hadn't tapped her on the shoulder, making her stop.</p><p>Daphne didn't have time to miss the feel of 'Stori's mouth on hers, because she found herself floating from the floor and moving to the bed!  As soon as she felt her knees hit the mattress, Daphne fell forward so she was spread out, her wrists tied to the corners of the headboard, and her legs stretched out and cuffed to the foot of the bed, it was all she could do not to cum again as Harry was ticking off all her hidden fantasies!</p><p>She felt his fingers entering her, and bolts of pleasure shot through her body, making her bite her lip to keep from moaning, but then he sent some of his magic deep into her core and the pleasure was magnified beyond anything she'd ever even dreamed could exist!   She strained against the bonds, trying to push back against him as she clenched around his fingers and a cry tore from her throat before collapsing on the bed, pleasure carrying her to the far corners of the world and she just enjoyed the journey.</p><p>The strangest thing was, she wasn't alone on her journey, she felt Harry's magic surrounding and caressing her filling her with his affection and love? Love? He loves her already? She wasn't expecting that to happen for years, but it just made everything even better!  </p><p>An unknown time later, she felt herself easing back into her body, and she felt him rubbing against her, his cock at her entrance, the head teasing her lips and she moaned, “Please, don't tease me! Fuck me Harry, make me your wife!”</p><p>She could hear the amusement in his voice as he said “Be careful what you wish for, Daphne, you just might get it!”</p><p>There was no more talking after that as he slid all the way inside her soaking quim, his cock filling her the way she had always dreamed of being filled! She reveled in the feeling of being taken, her body helpless under him, the bonds holding her place as he took his pleasure from her, and she knew she would never want it any other way!</p><p>The only sounds were her harsh breathing and the slap of his body against hers as he pounded into her pussy, pumping his magic through her center, and she lost track of the number of mini orgasms she experienced, until they all ran together and she thought she was losing her mind from she pleasure overload!</p><p>And then he leaned down, his body pressing against her, and his voice saying, “Do you like this Daphne, letting me take you however I want, while Astoria is sitting here watching?  Did you know that she's got all four fingers buried in her pussy right now, and she's already cum more than she had in her life!  Her eyes are locked on where my cock is stretching you, and I'm sure she's imagining licking my cum from your freshly fucked pussy and arse, and she's going to get a chance to do just that very soon, before you get to do the same thing to her.   Are you looking forward to tasting your virgin sister's sweet pussy juices? Making her cum by licking her pussy, and working your fingers and tongue into her arse so she's ready for my cock?”</p><p>He kept talking, telling her all the filthy things he was going to have her doing with her sister, but the pounding of the blood and magic in her body was getting so loud that Daphne couldn't hear him.  All she could hear was her own voice yelling her pleasure, and swearing that she would do everything he wanted, even seduce her mother if he wanted, just keep fucking her!</p><p>She had no idea how long they were fucking, and it didn't matter, but she eventually became aware of his fingers stretching out her rear, and knew that she was about to lose her last virginity.  She couldn't wait for it to happen, she had been willing to let Neville have her there, but he would have had to ask for it, and he never got the nerve, his loss!   Harry didn't ask her, he just took what he wanted, and to Daphne, that was just the way it was supposed to be, so she relaxed as much as she could, which was quite a bit, since her entire body was still tingling from the massive number of climaxes she'd already enjoyed.</p><p>It was while she was focusing on his fingers that it hit her, he was still pumping into her quim!  How is he still so hard? She wondered, before his cock hit another magical spot and the fireworks in her mind washed away all her questions again.  </p><p>She vaguely realized that he swelled inside her, and the feeling of his hot seed splashing her inner walls triggered yet another climax and she wondered how much more she could take? She couldn't wait to find out it she actually could lose her mind from pleasure, and would she even miss it?</p><p>Daphne heard herself moan as she suddenly felt empty, and the small still rational part of her mind realized that Harry had pulled out of her, leaving her feeling bereft, but then his warm breath was on her her skin, and his voice was saying, “I know you're tired, Daphne, but don't worry, you'll get used to it soon enough, all my lovers did.  As soon as I fill your arse, you can rest for a bit, then you can take us into the shower and clean me and yourself, do you want to do that?”</p><p>She heard herself agreeing, although part of her wondered at the way he phrased his comments, like he was expecting her to act like a body slave, and she was surprised it didn't bother her in the slightest.  </p><p>His fingers were still stretching her arse as her mind cleared, but she felt a gentle pulse of magic washing inside her tightest hole, and felt it relaxing around his fingers, and a warm liquid coating the tunnel.  She must have made a sound, because he said, “I just cleaned and lubricated you, Daphne, I told you I knew how to make sure you enjoyed yourself, didn't I?”</p><p>She nodded, and his fingers pulled out of her, being replaced by the head of his cock.   She held her breath against the intrusion, but was surprised when he pushed through the ring easily, and there was no pain at all!  She felt the heat of his cock as he slid into her, and it was wonderful, all she felt was the feeling of fullness, of completeness, and her magic danced inside her happily as the Potter Family magic flowed into her and joined with hers.   She was so fascinated with the feeling of the new magic and the connections it made to the spells she already knew, that she was barely aware of her husband burying his cock in her bowels until he started moving again!</p><p>She moved against him as much as she could, taking him fully into her body and sighing in pleasure as she felt his hips slap against her skin, before he pulled back and pushed forward again.   She managed to lift her hips up off the bed and groaned as he seemed to go even deeper before pulling back until only the head was inside, and then slamming against her, making her jerk against the bonds holding her in place  “Yes! That's it! Fuck my arse, Husband! You own my body, take what's yours!”  Daphne had no idea where these words were coming from, but they felt right to her at that moment so she didn't bother questioning it, she just continued exhorting him to plunder her rear the way he had been doing so nicely.</p><p>As his cock was plundering her arse, his fingers were stroking her pussy, and she shuddered, his magic was bleeding from his fingers into her over stimulated body, and she didn't know how much more she could take!  She struggled to hold back the pleasure that was building, trying to keep from climaxing again, because she was tired, damn it!  It was no use, the feelings were getting stronger and she felt him moving faster in her arse and suddenly he growled out her name and she felt him explode inside her!  </p><p>That was all it took, the molten lava of his seed flooded her body and the magic in his fingers met and merged until her entire body was nothing but a quivering mass of pleasure and she wasn't capable of doing more than just shrieking out her feelings as he pulled out and freed her arms and legs before rolling over and taking her in his arms.   </p><p>She found the energy to look up at him and smile tiredly, before it was all too much, and everything went black, and she was sound asleep in an instant.</p><p>If she had been aware, she would have noticed a frazzled Astoria stumbling to the bed and climbing in beside her, but Daphne was lost in her dreams, and it wasn't till she woke up several hours later that she discovered she was spooned with her younger sister, her hands cupping 'Stori's breasts as Harry's cock nestled between her thighs.  She looked around briefly, before yawning and going back to sleep, a sated smile on her face.</p><p>End Chapter One</p>
