    <p class="western"> </p><p class="western">(requested by <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/VictoriaHolmesWriting/pseuds/VictoriaHolmesWriting" rel="nofollow">VictoriaHolmesWriting</a>)</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Babies were very much a foreign, strange concept for Severus. He´d spent a significant part of his life around children aged 11 and up, but had virtually no contact with a human younger than that. Unless he counted the occasional visit to Lucius and Narcissa while Draco was still little.</p><p class="western">He couldn´t say he really interacted with the younger Malfoy in any of those, usually rather brief, encounters. Lucius had chosen him as a godfather more as a matter of convenience than anything else, after all, so it wasn´t like any of the adults involved in the arrangement were too eager to make sure Severus was an involved 'member of the family' and spend quality bonding time with the little master of the house. It was safe to say, then, that Severus had close to no experience in dealing with small children. And he never felt like it was the type of skillset he would ever need in his arsenal of already limited social graces.</p><p class="western">Evelyn on the other hand...She loved children in general and babies in particular. Which wasn´t particularly surprising. She had two nieces, and had been in their life from their birth, and was even godmother to the older one, Alice. She had helped her sister through countless nappy changes, bottle feedings and whatever else she could.</p><p class="western">Evelyn also came from a large family on her mother´s side. While her father had no siblings, her mother had three brothers and a sister. That meant lots of cousins, and these cousins had children of their own. Severus could hardly keep track of all the names, and didn´t particularly care, but he knew the family was full of children, and Evelyn had at some point babysat for each and every child of each and every one of her cousins.</p><p class="western">So, of course, when he finally had taken the steps to introduce Evelyn to Andromeda, little Teddy had quickly become the most popular topic of conversation for the two of them and the main reason for their immediate bonding.</p><p class="western">Andromeda had been absolutely ecstatic at the discovery that she had surviving family.</p><p class="western">Severus could hardly blame her, given her circunstances. She had then asked him to arrange a meeting, anxious to reach out and include Evelyn, her sister and the rest of the muggle Blacks in her and her grandson´s life, which Severus certainly understood. But that had posed a significant issue.</p><p class="western">Evelyn was still in the first stages of getting acquainted with the very concept of magic and all that plethora of reprcussions that came with it. It had been a massive, and even somewhat traumatic, adjustment in their relationship.</p><p class="western">Minerva had been the one to convince him that introducing Andromeda into the picture would improve things. And to his surprise, it did.</p><p class="western">Severus had never been particularly close to Andromeda, even though they were in the same house. There was a bit of an age gap between them and they didn´t really frequent the same acquaintances, even if Andromeda´s two sisters were among Severus own 'circle of conections' (he wouldn´t dare call any of the relationships we cultivated at the time 'friendships'). But Andromeda was still a Slytherin and she had always been courteous to him, even more after the facts of his participation in the war had come to light, and she found out they had been on the same side all along.</p><p class="western">So, out of the same spirit of common courtesy and house comraderie, and in hopes that she could help him ease Evelyn into the transition from not knowing magic existed to living with a wizard, he decided to introduce the two of them, They were cousins after all. Distant cousins, granted, but family, nevertheless. And Andromeda could use having something like am adult family member around again.</p><p class="western">He wasn´t too surprised when the two women hit it off almost immediately. Andromeda was eager to know more about Evelyn and her relatives and had almost shed tears of joy in finding out there were two little girls in the family. It was a shame that it would take some time for Alice and Lizzie to be introduced to any of their magical relatives (although Severus suspected Alice may need an earlier introducitions soon, if some phenomena he had been observing were indeed what he thought they were), but Evelyn was more than happy to provide Andromeda with photos and videos.</p><p class="western">Evelyn had been enormously conforted by the presence of somebody other than himself and Minerva who could walk her through the overwhelming amount of new information she had been constantly bombarded with since Severus had told her he was a wizard. The fact that Andromeda was grandmother to a lovely baby boy, barely two years old, was the icing on the cake. As soon as the initial shock of seeing Teddy´s hair change from light brown to neon green wore off, Evelyn was completely smitten with him.</p><p class="western">Soon enough Evelyn and Andromeda were meeting on a weekly basis and whenver it was Andromeda who came over to their place she would bring Teddy with her. It didn´t bother Severus much. All he had to do was keep to himself and ignore the child, and since their presence made Evelyn happy he was actually willing to join their conversations sometimes.</p><p class="western">Over time Evelyn started to get included in some of Andromeda´s little afternoon teas and sunday lunches with Molly Weasley as well. Severus didn´t mind that all too much either. Arthur was generous enough to provide him with some distraction whenever he happened to get roped into attending, and he rarely had to suffer the presence of any of their children. All the Weasley kids (which now seemed to include Potter and Hermione Granger) were off to mind their own business and lives, full grown adults the lot of them.</p><p class="western">Mrs. Weasley was overjoyed to have people over (empty nest sydrome must hit one hard when the last of that many children moves out, Severus imagined), and Arthur jumped at the opportunity to have Evelyn ready at hand to answer his endless list of questions about muggle history, their daily life and habits. Severus wasn´t that eager to socialize with the Weasleys, but it wasn´t all that unpleasant altogher, as Evelyn, mercifully, was much more of a conversationalist than him. He had a slight suspicion that if not for Evelyn and Andromeda, dear Molly and Arthur wouldn´t have suffered his presence, so they were considerate enough to not expect him to be too engaged.</p><p class="western">But now...now he was starting to wonder if it hadn´t been a mistake on his part to let himself get too comfortable with the whole arrangement.</p><p class="western">It was a pleasant Sunday at the Burrow, and Mrs Weasley had decided it would be a lovely idea to have tea in the back garden so Teddy could play for a while in the mild late afternoon sun. The table was set outside for the adults and little blanket with some toys for the baby, who toddled around and played with Evelyn and Mrs Wesley as a breeze made the leaves fell all around them.</p><p class="western">Then, Andromeda decided to bother Severus a bit.</p><p class="western">“Evelyn is very good with kids, isn´t she?” she commented in a relaxed tone, sitting by the table where Severus and Arthur were having tea and talking about the latest news.</p><p class="western">He looked up from the newspaper he´d been reading and watched as she sat down with her own cup of tea, casually reaching for a pastry on the neat table Mrs Weasley had set for them. He could hear Teddy cooing and giggling, and Evelyn and Mrs Weasley talking and fussing over him, just a few feet away.</p><p class="western">Severus was not yet aware he was being set up.</p><p class="western">“She is.” he replied, naively.</p><p class="western">If he had bothered to look at Arthur´s bemused expression, he´d know he was walking right into a trap.</p><p class="western">“She´ll make a fine mother one day, I´m sure.”</p><p class="western">Andromeda had a sly little grin on her lips as she lowered her teacup and primly set it down on the saucer, her eyes sparkling with that kind of begnign yet ruthless brand of mischief so unique to mothers and grandmothers.</p><p class="western">Then it hit him.</p><p class="western">“She does have a way with children.” Severus trailed off, hoping that would be the end of it.</p><p class="western">“I mean, she does want children one day, doesn´t she?...it would be a shame if...”</p><p class="western">“We never really had this conversation” he let out, dully, before she could finish.</p><p class="western">“Of course you haven´t” Arthur offered, mercifully, with a compassonate smile. “it´s a bit early for you two to be discussing children.”</p><p class="western">As if summoned, and Severus did wonder wther it was a bit too perfectly choreographed, Molly approached the table, ostensibly to get Evelyn a piece of cake. If Severus didn´t know any better, he´d think some rehearsing had gone into her flawless timing.</p><p class="western">“Too early for what?” she asked</p><p class="western">“I was just telling Severus here how I believe Evelyn will make a wonderful mum one day, don´t you think?” Andromeda informed her, basking on Severus unease.</p><p class="western">“Oh, she absolutely would. But dear me, it´s a bit too early for that, no?” Mrs. Weasley said, and Severus silently thanked her...until she continued. “They haven´t even started the wedding plans...yet.”</p><p class="western">Severus´pleading eyes went to Arthur who simply shrugged.</p><p class="western">“That´s true. You are making plans for that, aren´t you Severus?”</p><p class="western">“Marriage is not something we have discussed, Andromeda.” his tone was more pointed now.</p><p class="western">“You´re not stringing my cousin along are you?</p><p class="western">“Excuse me, Andromeda, but...” he sat up, preparing a proper speech to let her know, with the proper amount of proper ettiquette, that his private life was, properly speaking, none of her bloody fucking business.</p><p class="western">“Severus!” Arthur yelped all of the sudden “I entirely forgot. I just acquired a bottle of wormwood brandy and I´ve been meaning to get your opinion.”</p><p class="western">“Sure, of course.” Severus breathed out, relieved, following Arthur back inside the house.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You will forgive me if I don´t really have any wormwood brandy” Mr. Weasley told him when they were safely out of earshot “but you look like you can use a bit of regular old dragon barrel.”</p><p class="western">“If you please.” Severus let out, taking a seat.</p><p class="western">Arthur poured him a generous dose, which Severus downed in one gulp.</p><p class="western">“Don´t mind that.” He smiled, pouring himself a glass. “They don´t mean anything by it.”</p><p class="western">“Well, I surely hope Andromeda doesn´t go about trying to put ideas in Evelyn´s head.”</p><p class="western">“I take that you really haven´t talked about marriage and...”</p><p class="western">“Not exactly. I mean the only time we vaguely talked about it, Lyn all but said she doesn´t want to get married right now. She´s working on a new book, and she´s been invited to give semester course at Manchester University, the last thing on her mind is marriage and children.”</p><p class="western">“Excellent, then carrry on carrying on, my lad. Don´t pay Andromeda any mind. She´s just excited about having Evelyn around, and maybe meeting more of the family soon. You must understand, she lost her daughter and Teddy is all she has... Maybe it´s the idea of adding to the family that has her like this. And Molly...well now that the children all moved out..”</p><p class="western">“I suppose I get it.” Severus rolled his eyes and sighed, but to some point he did get it.</p><p class="western">Severus could only imagine how difficult it must have been for Andromeda when her daughter died, leaving her with a grandson to raise, and no other family but an estranged sister. To this day Andromeda and Narcissa didn´t talk to each other, and he could only imagine how much it would help matters if Mrs. Malfoy were to discover they had muggle relatives. And that Severus was currently in a romantic relationship with one of them.</p><p class="western">He still remembered how well Evelyn and Narcissa´s accidental first meeting had gone, so he could hardly imagine them having a nice chat over tea and crumpets and calling each other “cousins”. And as much as he liked Andromeda and wouldn´t mind that she considered him family in some capacity, he idea of being related to the Malfoys by marriage was not all that enticing.</p><p class="western">When they returned to the table, Evelyn had taken her place, with Teddy hapilly bouncing on her lap. Mercifully the conversation seemed to have shifted to something else, but the moment Andromeda laid eyes on him, she decided it was time for round 2.</p><p class="western">“That´s such a lovely offer, but I hope Severus won´t mind.” she said, turning to him</p><p class="western">“I won´t mind what?”</p><p class="western">“Well, Evelyn just offered to babysit Teddy for a day. But I would hate to be a bother.”</p><p class="western">“She offered what?”</p><p class="western">“Well, it´s no bother at all! I would love to have him all to myself for a while.” Evelyn beamed, playfully tickling and squishing the little boy´s belly, prompting delighted squeals from him.</p><p class="western">“Sure...It´s no bother at all.” Severus let out, defeated.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Why are you so bothered?”</p><p class="western">“Did you really have to <b>offer</b> to take care of the kid? Like that?”</p><p class="western">“Poor Andromeda deserves a day off, and is not like I haven´t done it before. Jesus, Severus, is not like WE haven´t done before, so what gives?”</p><p class="western">They had. Once, for barely a couple hours, when a co-worker of Evelyn´s had nowhere to leave her daughter while she had an emergency doctor´s appointment. And little Sadie had blessedly slept all the time and Severus barely noticed she was even in the house. But Evelyn had just comitted to a full 24 hour period, smackdab on a Saturday. Andromeda would drop the kid off in the morning and come back for him the morning after.</p><p class="western">“I can´t belive we´ll babysit Remus Lupin´s son. I swear if the man was alive he´d have a good laugh at my expense.”</p><p class="western">“Severus, stop. It´s just a little baby. With technicolor changing hair...but just a baby.”</p><p class="western">“Fine, but don´t even think of taking him for a stroll around the neighbourhood.”</p><p class="western">“That´s a horrid thing to say.”</p><p class="western">“Oh is it? Let´s take him to visit Fr. Thomas at the church then, maybe he´ll turn bright pink and give the good priest a heart attack. Orwe´ll get a good deal on an exorcism”</p><p class="western">“Well, I didn´t think of...” knocks interupted her, and she almost hopped her way to the door “There they are!”</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Severus eyed the toddler sitting on the playmat.</p><p class="western">He had never noticed how much Teddt looked like his father. Then again, he had never bothered to truly look at that child. He was just this sort of shapeless little presence that happened to accompany Andromeda when she visited. He never bothered to interact with him much at all.</p><p class="western">In fact sometimes he almost forgot that wasn´t just Andromeda´s grandson, but also Remus Lupin´s son.</p><p class="western">Severus had received the news of Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks´deaths with a mixture of indiference and bitterness. He didn´t care much at all for Lupin, but the thought that he, Severus, had outlived him didn´t bring him any joy. He had no love lost for Andromeda´s daughter either, but it seemed rather cruel senseless for her to die so young leaving a young child behind. It wasn´t something that was supposed to happen...again.</p><p class="western">But when it came to their child, maybe because he didn´t have any personal or emotional recollection of the two of them as parents, Severus felt oddly detached. It was just a child. A healthy, happy child, that Evelyn had grown attached to, but he didn´t mean much to Severus.</p><p class="western">Only now did he take a good look at Lupin´s child, running around on his short wobbly toddle legs and babbling cheerfully, using his limited vocabulary to have something that vaguely resembled a conversation with Evelyn. She was entirely taken with him. It was like everything else had disappeared the moment Andromeda had put that boy in her arms and left (not without giving Severus a petulant little wink).</p><p class="western">It was odd, almost uncomfortable in a way.</p><p class="western">Evelyn didn´t see that child in the same way he did, of course. She had never had the chance to meet his parents or create any kind of opinion about them. To her this was just an innocent child she happened to be related to, and being that he was family in her eyes and that she loved children she felt the urge to care and protect him.</p><p class="western">As he watched her play with him, hug him, kiss his chubby cheeks, Severus felt mildly unnerved. The more he looked at Teddy the more Lupin he saw, and the more Lupin he saw, the more he remembered Lupin was dead, the more he wondered if he should have been dead as well.</p><p class="western">Lily, James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin...for some reason it felt like a joke in bad taste that he had to be the last one standing. To outlive all of them, and live with the memories of all that had been said and done between himself and the self-styled Marauders. That not only he had Harry Potter walking the earth the living embodiment of a part of his life he´d been desperately trying to let go, but to have Lupin´s son right there in his living room, as innocent as a child of two can possibly be, to remind him that maybe, just maybe, Lupin deserved to be alive more than he did.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Teddy Lupin had been in the house for less than an hour and Severus was already exhausted. Small mercies that he seemed moderately well behaved. But children that age, as behaved as they could possibly be, created noise and comotion merely by existing. At least Evelyn hadn´t asked for any help, nor did she seem like she would. She had it all under control, it seemed.</p><p class="western">She had all but forgotten Severus existed. Which was a bit of a blessing. It allowed him to step back and disconnect from the entire situation and be left alone. He had almost believed he would get away with it even.</p><p class="western">Eventually Teddy grew sleepy and there was silence, and Severus almost believed he would have peace finally. He probably should have suspected the short phone call Evelyn had gotten righ after she had put him down his nap was not a happy omen the moment she hung up the phone and, miraculously, seemed to remember he was in the room.</p><p class="western">“So, are you planning on just sitting there with this book I know you´re not even reading all day?”</p><p class="western">Evelyn walked to him with that cat like sway of hips she put on when she set out to break down his feigned blockage of indifference, and removed the book from his hands, sliding onto his lap.</p><p class="western">“How do you know I´m not reading it?”</p><p class="western">“You haven´t turned a single page in half an hour.”</p><p class="western">“Well, it´s hard to concentrate with a child in the house.”</p><p class="western">“Have you no shame?” she laughed “Teddy is all but a little angel.You´re being needlessly mean now.”</p><p class="western">Severus didn´t want to admit, but she was right. Evelyn had played with him fed him, washed him after he ate and put him down for a nap, and Severus couldn´t say he had trully had his peace and quiet too terribly disturbed. Severus looked over to the neast little nest of blankets and cushions Evelyn had made on the sitting room floor, where Teddy was peacefully sleeping on his belly, one tiny little hand clutching at a plush toy lion.Yes, he was quiet all right.</p><p class="western">“I need you to do me a favour, though” she continued. “Angela just called, her car broke down, and she needs a lift back home. Can you watch Teddy for a little while I go rescue her?”</p><p class="western">“Wait, what?”</p><p class="western">“It won´t take long, it´s a Saturday, there´s barely any traffic. I´ll pick her up, drop her off at home and be right back.”</p><p class="western">“But...”</p><p class="western">“Teddy won´t even wake up before I come back. And if he does just entertain him.”</p><p class="western">“Entertain him!?”</p><p class="western">“He´s been fed, he´s clean, he will be well rested afts his nap. Just entertain him. You can do that.”</p><p class="western">“Unless he wants to talk about the subtleties of potion making or discuss effective strategies to counter curses, then I don´t see how I can possibly 'entertain' him.”</p><p class="western">“Well, he might like those thing, you don´t know. Try! maybe you´ll find something in common.” she laughed softly before giving him a kiss and getting ready to leave.</p><p class="western"> </p>
