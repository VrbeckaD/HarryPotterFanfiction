<p class="p5">Draco was not having a good time of it in Potions. He’d finally made the decision—the morning of, not one of his prouder moments in the planning department—and all he could think about was what he was going to say. Pansy continually nagged at him through the lesson, trying to get him to focus, but his eyes kept flicking towards the front of the classroom, and at any rate looking at Pansy gave him a headache. She was covered head to toe in pink, and he couldn’t help but be forcibly reminded of Professor Umbridge, whom he would just as assume not think about. Besides, the colors were so bright they were nearly blinding, and the way her jumper sparkled made him a little nauseated.</p>
<p class="p5">By the time class ended he had managed to produce a reasonable facsimile of the assigned potion, though it was far from his best work. He told Pansy to go ahead, giving some vague, transparent excuse for staying behind even he didn’t fully register. She gave him an odd look but left, falling in step beside Blaise and joining the flow of primarily red- and pink-robed students out of the room. He bottled his potion, cleaned his station, and gathered his things excruciatingly slowly, continually running over a variety of possible tactics. He was Draco Malfoy, and he got what he wanted.</p>
<p class="p5">He had a sinking suspicion this would be one of the few times he failed, and almost certainly catastrophically. But he had made up his mind, and he also didn’t run away.</p>
<p class="p5">Well. Not mostly.</p>
<p class="p5">Not about this.</p>
<p class="p5">“Draco, what are you doing?”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus’s voice cut through his thoughts like a knife, and he flushed, shoving the last of his things into his bag as quickly as possible. “Sorry, sir,” he said, walking up to his desk and handing in his potion. “I was distracted.”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus rolled his eyes. “Obviously. No doubt you have more important things on your mind today than producing a proper anti-venom.” He picked up the flask and examined the liquid. “This wouldn’t cure a mosquito bite.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco worked very hard to retain some level of dignity. This wouldn’t work if he let Severus get to him. “I disagree,” he replied, which was not in any way helpful.</p>
<p class="p5">Severus shook his head slightly, more of a single jerking movement than an actual response, and set the flask down. “Leave,” he said, sounding bored. “Clearly you are not in a state of mind to make such decisions on your own, and I am sure my classroom is not where you intend to spend your evening. Have you planned out your current conquest, or are you waiting to see where the night takes you?” His question was accompanied by a sneer, and Draco squared his shoulders.</p>
<p class="p5">Now or never.</p>
<p class="p5">“I think we should sleep together.”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus’s eyes sharpened and his jaw clenched. “Excuse me?”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco flushed again. That was not what he had meant to say. He’d thought of a hundred quasi-reasonable, much more subtle ways of asking, but it seemed he’d forgotten. “Rather, if you don’t have any plans.”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus’s eyes bore into his, and it took a lot of effort not to turn and run, whether he was Draco Malfoy or not. “The only potential problem you see with your suggestion is whether or not I have plans?” he asked, eyebrow raised.</p>
<p class="p5">“I don’t,” Draco replied, willing himself to maintain eye contact. “Have plans, I mean. Or a problem.”</p>
<p class="p5">“I disagree,” he echoed sarcastically. “Judging from your poor performance during class and the determined look in your eye, I would say I am your plan.”</p>
<p class="p5">“An option, nothing more,” Draco replied, shrugging lightly as if it meant nothing to him. “I have a plethora of offers, but I find myself tired of sleeping with only those who are sucking up to me. So to speak; I do enjoy being sucked.” He was frankly amazed with his bravery. “Besides, the student population is hardly up to my standards.”</p>
<p class="p5">“And I am,” Severus said.</p>
<p class="p5">“Presumably,” Draco replied, a hint of a challenge in his voice. “I would hope you have more experience than an average teenager.”</p>
<p class="p5">“What makes you think you are up to mine?” Severus said, throwing the dare back. “Are you so much more talented than your peers?”</p>
<p class="p5">“Of course,” Draco replied nonchalantly. “Why do you think I’ve had so many offers? It’s not just because I’m devastatingly attractive; I have the skills to back up my reputation.” It was unreal, having this conversation with Severus. It wasn’t going at all the way he expected, but he thought that might be due to a lack of foresight on his part. He’d imagined something heated and passionate, whether with lust or anger. A reasoned civility made perfect sense, given to whom he was talking. He just wasn’t sure how to respond to it.</p>
<p class="p5">Severus continued to regard him for a moment before turning back to the papers he was grading. “No.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco’s heart twisted nastily, but he pushed it away. “And why not?”</p>
<p class="p5">“I am under no obligation to explain myself,” Severus replied. “I am your teacher, Malfoy. You shouldn’t have asked in the first place.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco felt a little like dying. His feelings towards Severus were longstanding and profoundly complicated, ranging from pure lust to deep respect to pathetically needy love, all shot through with crushing self-doubt and the knowledge there would never, ever be anything between them. Except maybe, just maybe, sex. Severus was exceedingly logical, and Draco really was a good lay. If he could convince him of that, he had a chance.</p>
<p class="p5">The dying, though. Severus calling him by his surname was tantamount to being slapped.</p>
<p class="p5">“Malfoy, really?” Draco asked, vying for teasing. “Did I offend you so much? I thought you’d be flattered.”</p>
<p class="p5">“Implying you are such a catch I could do no better,” Severus replied dryly.</p>
<p class="p5">“No, of course not,” Draco backpedaled quickly. “Implying you’d enjoy having someone tell you they wanted you.”</p>
<p class="p5">“Implying I do not hear such a thing often,” Severus shot back.</p>
<p class="p5">Draco raked his brain for a response. It was so hard; as if it wasn’t awkward enough, there was the embarrassingly strong pain of rejection. After an unsuitably long silence, he gave up.</p>
<p class="p5">“You could’ve just said no,” Draco said sharply. “You didn’t have to insult me. I’m not a bloody Hufflepuff, I can handle rejection.”</p>
<p class="p5">“I did not reject you,” Severus replied with no inflection whatsoever. “Your bumbling attempt at flattery is pathetic, and if you do not rephrase yourself very quickly, you will find I am quite capable of doling out rejection with no regard whatsoever to your feelings.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco froze, body and mind. He needed to reply, he knew that, but there weren’t any words to be had. “It’s Valentine’s Day and I’d enjoy a good shag,” he said. “I thought you might, too. I’m pretty confident you don’t have any plans because as private as you are, I think you would have told me if you were sleeping with someone. I know you hate holidays, but it’s an excuse for good sex. If I’m not up to your standards, that’ll leave me embarrassed, not you. I don’t see the downside.”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus remained silent for so long Draco nearly gave up again. He probably would have if he didn’t hate running away so very, very much.</p>
<p class="p5">“Be at my quarters at eight. I will not be impressed if you are late.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco gaped at him for a moment before collecting himself. It was hard, given how—well, <em>hard</em> he suddenly was. “I’m never late,” he said, and left.</p>
<p class="p6"> </p>
<p class="p3">

</p>
<p class="p5">Draco was an utter mess. He took a shower as soon as he got back to the dorms, mostly as an excuse to wank, though he did want to look his best. Still, the wanking was more important. The last thing he wanted was to come too quickly; he was fully capable of coming more than once, but that wasn’t an excuse for embarrassing himself. He didn’t even have the chance to finger himself, Severus’ words echoing through his head. It was obscene that the man could make a threat so sexy.</p>
<p class="p5">He spent the rest of the time before dinner getting ready. There was his hair, his skin, his scent, his clothes. Pansy looked on with amusement, offering opinions despite Draco’s insistence he didn’t want them. She made an effort to tease him over how obsessive he was being, but when he pointed out that he’d gotten <em>Severus Snape</em> to have sex with him, she quieted.</p>
<p class="p5">Dinner was revolting, filled with glittery red and pink streamers, an abundance of disgusting lovesick gazes through the hall, and drifts of Valentine’s Day cards. Draco got his fair share, but he vanished them without bothering to look. The only person he cared about he was seeing, and wasn’t exactly the type to send a card anyway. He barely ate anything, only relenting when Pansy pointed out he’d probably want the energy later on. A few brief glances at the head table assured him that Severus looked no different than ever, just his usual dour self.</p>
<p class="p5">After dinner was even worse. Everyone was paired off, leaving him to stew by himself for a full hour. Rather, the clock said it was an hour; Draco was fairly certain it was at least three or four before the minute hand finally completed its revolution. The walk to Severus’ quarters, on the other hand, passed in a split second, while the time between his knock and the door opening lasted several years.</p>
<p class="p5">Severus was wearing a button down white shirt and black slacks. Draco licked his lips subconsciously, unable to keep his eyes from wandering. He himself was wearing a tight black cashmere sweater and tighter dark skinny jeans, but despite spending so long on his appearance when Severus had no doubt thrown on whatever was closest, he was positive there was no way he looked anywhere near as good.</p>
<p class="p5">“Are you going to gape all day or do you wish to come in?” Severus asked.</p>
<p class="p5">“Yeah, sorry,” Draco muttered, stepping through the door. He had been in Severus’ quarters plenty of times, but never before had he been so nervous or so desperate to move from the sitting room to the bedroom. More often that not he felt more at home here than in his own dorm, but not at this particular moment. “So, er, how was your day?” he asked, turning to face Severus, who raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="p5">“You wish to spend your time on idle chitchat?” he asked, moving forward into Draco’s space. “I thought you had something more interesting in mind.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco’s mouth went dry, his breathing sped up, and he was starting to get hard again. “Uh, just being polite,” he said, transfixed. Severus’ eyes were darker than usual, the slightest tint of pink high on his cheeks, and his lips as captivating as ever. Draco knew every inch of his face, and the thought of being able to touch the lines and contours he knew so well was extremely distracting. “Manners and all.”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus smiled slightly, and Draco had to focus nearly all of his energy on continuing to stand. It wasn’t even a particularly nice smile, more teasing and condescending than anything else. “I was assured you were a cut above your peers,” he replied. “You are not living up to your word, Draco.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco decided words were unnecessary. He leaned up, tentatively resting his hands on Severus’ face, and pulled him down for a kiss. It was electric; the moment their lips touched, Draco was completely gone. Severus was responsive beneath him, though he didn’t instigate anything. Draco was vaguely aware he was being tested, which was less than spectacular given that his brain had melted beyond all recognition. Severus’ lips were slightly chapped and skin much softer than he’d expected. He mapped his face, relearning everything he thought he knew. Severus rested his hands on Draco’s hips, and Draco whimpered quietly, licking his lips until he opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="p5">Kissing Severus was beyond everything Draco had ever thought, and he’d thought a lot. Severus was still passive and Draco was very aware that he was in charge, and that he needed to make this absolutely spectacular. The problem was he’d never really <em>thought</em> about kissing before, he’d just done it and his partner would melt beneath him. This was very different. For one thing, Severus was not one to melt. For another, now that Draco was actively thinking about it, he was slipping. He could feel years of experience vanishing, turning him back into an inexperienced eleven-year-old, blinding sticking his tongue into Blaise’s mouth behind the Quidditch bleachers.</p>
<p class="p5">Draco jerked away, blushing darkly. “Sorry,” he mumbled, running a hand through his hair. “I don’t know—I mean, I’ve—you, rather, you’re intimidating and I said things, and I promise those things are true, but I think I’ve forgotten.”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus tilted his head up so Draco had no choice but to meet his gaze. “I do not expect you to possess the same—predisposition as myself.” Draco shivered. “Relax, Draco.” He shivered again. The way his name was drawn out was absolutely sinful. “Perhaps a more suitable location than standing in the middle of the living room would be advantageous?” Draco nodded, heading towards the bedroom. Severus grabbed his arm, and Draco let out a quiet gasp at the fingers brushing the sensitive skin of his inner wrist. “Not yet. Sit on the couch.” He released Draco, who walked over to the couch and perched at the very edge, already humiliated.</p>
<p class="p5">His one chance, and he was blowing it completely.</p>
<p class="p5">Severus joined him a moment later, holding a single glass of red wine. “You are too tense,” he stated, and Draco reached for the glass only to have his hand batted away. He immediately looked away, finding that he was near tears. Bloody hell, what was wrong with him? How did he think Severus would make this easy?</p>
<p class="p5">A finger was on his chin again, turning him towards Severus. He met his eyes for a split second before Severus leaned down and kissed him. Draco sighed against his lips and suddenly his mouth was flooded with the sharp, fruity taste of a particularly fine vintage of Cabernet Sauvignon. He let out a quiet moan as he swallowed, Severus stroking his tongue with his own. Draco tangled a hand in his hair, even silkier than his own, and once again took control, licking every drop of wine from his mouth. Beneath the alcohol he tasted musky and spiced, like testosterone and need. Draco wasn’t sure how good it was, but his own need was overtaking him, and he no longer had the strength to pull away, he had wanted this for far too long.</p>
<p class="p5">A small voice in the back of his head reminded him that this was nothing other than sex and it would serve him well to remember that, but Draco pushed it away.</p>
<p class="p5">Severus still wasn’t responding, not the way Draco wanted him to. He was allowing himself to be kissed but not much more, and Draco was going to be kicked out any minute now, and—</p>
<p class="p5">The moment before Draco pulled away to mumble an apology and disappear forever, Severus let out a small sigh. It was tiny, barely enough to hear, but it gave Draco the confidence he needed. He redoubled his efforts, losing himself in Severus. He forced himself to focus only on pleasing Severus and not himself, pretending this was one night of many, that he had nothing to prove because he’d already won his place in his bed.</p>
<p class="p5">Draco kept one hand twined in Severus’ hair and let the other trail down his chest, focusing only on Severus’ reactions. He untucked his shirt and ghosted his fingers along the freshly bared skin, staying just above his trousers and not daring to actually venture beneath his shirt. Draco broke their kiss and moved to his neck, licking, kissing and nibbling the sensitive skin. Severus let his head roll to the side giving him access, and hummed appreciatively. When Draco licked along his pulse and sucked, almost certainly hard enough to leave a mark, Severus let out a gasp, and Draco moaned quietly in response. He was straining against his jeans, knowing full well he was far too aroused, but the pain of his zip digging into him was starting to become a legitimate distraction, as well as the trickles of wetness leaking into his pants.</p>
<p class="p5">Draco lost the battle with his hands. Before he realized what he was doing, both hands were beneath Severus’ shirt, exploring the body he’d envisioned so often. He was surprised by how many of his fantasies were true—beneath all his robes and layers he was muscled but not overly so, just enough to keep himself in shape for anything that came his way, despite the war having been over for almost a year. A trail of hair leading downwards that Draco had to work very hard to ignore, and a spattering higher on his chest. Nipples hardened beneath his fingers, drawing another sharp breath from Severus. Draco found his way back to his lips, and now Severus was responding much more evidently, their tongues dueling for control.</p>
<p class="p5">Time was moving strangely. Draco’s hands were no longer under Severus’ shirt but unbuttoning it, moving with a deft speed he was half proud of and half annoyed with, wishing he could take the time to savor the moment. His mouth was following his hands, licking his way downwards, requiring a lot of self-control to move back up when he finished the last button. He pushed his shirt open, sparing a moment to appreciate his chest before dipping his head and placing a gentle kiss on his left nipple. Severus moaned quietly, and Draco could feel the vibrations against his lips. He needed to get out of his own trousers very soon, but now he was too busy swirling his tongue around the tightened nub, experimentally scraping his teeth along the sensitive bud. Another louder moan, and Draco couldn’t help the answering whimper. He switched sides, not stopping until Severus twined his hands in his hair and pulled him up for a proper kiss.</p>
<p class="p5">That was when Draco learned he had no idea about how to kiss or what it was supposed to feel like. Sparks and electricity and fireworks and explosions, tingles and shivers racing through his body. Severus anchored them together, one hand staying in Draco’s hair, the other going to his hip. Draco couldn’t stop small whimpers and quiet moans from escaping, no matter how inappropriate it was for just a kiss.</p>
<p class="p5">It was also when Draco realized how deeply he was in over his head. Any doubts he’d had about being in love with Severus were gone. This was perfect, stunning, absolutely exactly what he’d been missing his entire life. His heart was aching, and he hated himself for it. He knew he needed to stop now, he was only going to get hurt, but he couldn’t. Instead he focused on Severus’ mouth and his hands and how, just for this moment, he could pretend that he felt the same.</p>
<p class="p5">The fact that the pretending was even better than the kiss itself was in no way an issue.</p>
<p class="p5">“Sev,” Draco sighed, the name escaping his lips without his permission. He tensed; was that allowed? Probably not, especially not while they were just kissing. It was just that they <em>were</em> kissing, and it was Severus, and it was so beyond good. But Severus didn’t reply, just continued to kiss him, so Draco returned to exploring his chest and pushing back on his shirt, trying to slide it off his shoulders without success. Severus refused to let go of him, which Draco supposed was a good sign.</p>
<p class="p5">Draco needed more. Now. He was very used to being in the dominant roll and he wasn’t sure how to proceed. He certainly wasn’t going to push Severus back so he was lying on top of him, or pull him onto his lap so Draco was beneath him. What did the passive partner do? Sit and wait? He was too impatient and still worried about proving himself and should be doing <em>something</em>, only he didn’t know what.</p>
<p class="p5">He pulled away from Severus, pulled his sweater off and went back to kissing. That was reasonable, probably. Severus certainly seemed to think so—his hands immediately moved to Draco’s buttons, undoing them with much more dexterity than Draco had possessed. He was gasping as Severus’ fingers brushed his bare skin, not purposefully feeling him but ghosting along as he took care of the buttons. Draco was becoming ridiculously desperate, his kisses growing sloppy as he was undressed, forgetting how to use his hands entirely and just resting them on Severus’ chest. This was not how it was supposed to go and there was nothing he could do about it.</p>
<p class="p5">He did manage to take advantage of Severus completely removing his shirt, and get rid of Severus’ as well. He licked his lips, heart pounding wildly, extraordinarily aware of the situation. Snogging Severus Snape, on his couch, while they were both shirtless. Draco pulled him closer, needing to feel their bodies pressed together, unable to help the loud moan that escaped at the contact.</p>
<p class="p5">“Eager, are we?” Severus asked quietly, though he didn’t move away.</p>
<p class="p5">Draco chose not to answer verbally. Instead he slid a leg between Severus’, the angle awkward but irrelevant. He was still thinking clearly enough to remember not to move too closely lest Severus feel <em>exactly </em>how eager he was. The extra contact and the symbolism of being between Severus’ leg was too much as it was; if his erection came into contact with him, that would be the end of it.</p>
<p class="p5">His plan didn’t work. Rather, it worked too well. Severus growled in the back of his throat and pulled Draco onto his lap, moving him so he was straddling his leg, bodies pressed firmly together, and Draco bucked forward uncontrollably, rubbing his clothed erection against Severus and only barely not coming. Severus grabbed his arse and shifted him, and Draco legitimately thought for a few seconds that he had something in his pocket before coming to the revelation that he wasn’t the only one who was hard.</p>
<p class="p5">Draco groaned, grinding against him. “Oh fuck,” he breathed, the fact that they were half naked completely unimportant. He stopped their kiss entirely, resting his head on Severus’ shoulder and scooting back so he had access to his trousers. He moaned again at feeling the hardness beneath his fingers, not missing the light hiss that Severus made. He fumbled with the button, hands shaking, before finally managing it and moving onto the much easier zip. He couldn’t bring himself to slide his hand beneath his pants, that was too scary, but he did go beneath his trousers and palm him through the thin fabric. They moaned together at the sensation, and Draco instinctually tightened his grip, more because his entire body was clenching than anything else.</p>
<p class="p5">“Above pants groping?” Severus asked, though his voice wasn’t entirely even and his hands were still sliding over and squeezing his arse. “I thought you were above such teenaged foolishness.”</p>
<p class="p5">“Just warming up,” Draco muttered, hiding his head in Severus’ shoulder. For fuck’s sake he knew what he was doing. Really. Probably. Or he had, at least, before he was sitting half naked on Severus’ lap with his hand down his trousers. And, as Severus pointed out, above his pants.</p>
<p class="p5">“Consider yourself warmed,” Severus replied, grabbing his chin and pulling him in for a deep kiss. Draco whimpered into his mouth and, gathering his courage, moved beneath his pants. His breathing stopped; Severus was long, thick and harder than he seemed through his pants. He was hot and velvety and fuck, leaking. For Draco. Because of what he was doing. Draco’s breath came back in sharp pants, but at least the knowledge spurred him into action. He ran his thumb over his slit, eliciting a low moan, squeezing and stroking his head, dancing his fingers along his shaft, doing anything and everything he could to gather more fluid. Severus was responding beneath him, panting lightly, thrusting up and moaning occasionally when Draco found a particularly sensitive spot. The angle was awkward, but Draco made the best of it, and apparently his best was decent at the very lest.</p>
<p class="p5">“Take off your trousers?” Draco asked breathily. “And pants?”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus muttered a spell, and Draco was sitting on an entirely naked Severus. Draco let out a long, low moan, once again involuntarily tightening his hand, which caused Severus to reciprocate. From Draco’s perspective, forehead leaning on Severus’ shoulder, he had the perfect view of his erection, and it was the single sexiest sight he had ever seen. A wave of tingles washed through him, his balls started to tighten, and he had to squeeze his eyes closed and think of a naked Dumbledore to prevent himself from coming.</p>
<p class="p5">Severus cast another unheard spell, and then Draco was naked as well, and all his work went out the window. Everything tightened again and he wasn’t able to breathe at all and tingles were taking over and he was going to come, now, because what else was he supposed to do? In a last ditch effort he released Severus and wrapped a hand around himself, tightly squeezing his base, and while the need didn’t recede, at least he couldn’t physically ejaculate.</p>
<p class="p5">“My, my,” Severus said silkily. “Already, Draco?”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco closed his eyes. “Shut up.”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus’ hand was suddenly on him, squeezing and stroking, doing things to him Draco had never heard of, let alone been on the receiving end. All he could think was <em>Severus, Severus’ hand, Severus touching me, oh fuck Severus’ hand</em> and he melted completely, all muscles going slack, including his hand, and that was the end.</p>
<p class="p5">Draco screamed as his body convulsed. Severus continued to do whatever ridiculously amazing thing he was doing as Draco emptied himself onto them. Everything, absolutely everything was gone, leaving only pure sensation, absolute pleasure and the knowledge that this was <em>Severus</em> who was making him feel this way. He had never had an orgasm last so long before, and even though by the end it was nearly painful, he would have been more than happy if it never stopped.</p>
<p class="p6"> </p>
<p class="p5">

</p>
<p class="p5">He barely heard the cleaning spell Severus cast, only registering it at all because his voice would <em>always</em> register. He was a pile of mush, unable to do anything other than slump pathetically against Severus, who rearranged him so he was wrapped in his arms, cuddled against his chest. If he had any energy whatsoever he would have reverted to pathetic self-pitying desperation but he physically couldn’t muster up the emotion. All he could think was that Severus had made him come, Severus was cuddling him, Severus was rock hard beneath him, and Severus might possibly feel the same way about him because he had made him come and was cuddling him and was rock hard.</p>
<p class="p5">Probably not.</p>
<p class="p5">But maybe.</p>
<p class="p5">Then he was being lifted, walked into the bedroom, and laid down on the bed. He let out a sigh of contentment and forced his eyes open. Severus was lying next to him with a look of vague amusement, disappointment and his trademark disapproval.</p>
<p class="p5">“You have oversold your abilities,” Severus said, lecturing voice creeping in. “I was pleasantly surprised at your handjob, but clearly you leave much to be desired.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco flushed, and he found he did indeed have the energy to feel awful. “You’re assuming,” he replied angrily. “You haven’t seen how many times I can come.”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco smirked. “More than you can handle.”</p>
<p class="p5">“And your turnaround time?”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco’s smirk widened. “See for yourself.” Severus gave him a firm stroke, and Draco shivered. “Think you deserve my attention, though. I owe you.”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus hesitated a moment. “I may have understated your skills. Give me a few minutes.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco whimpered. Was it really possible he had turned Severus on so much in such a short period of time? It couldn’t be. But it was growing less and less important as Severus continued to stroke him and he started to harden again. While the process was sped up by his partner being Severus—actually <em>Severus</em>—he was proud of his ability at repeat performances. It didn’t take long at all for him to be hard again, and thrusting lightly into his hand.</p>
<p class="p5">“See?” he said breathily. “I could go all night. Longer than you, certainly.”</p>
<p class="p5">“My age gives me experience you clearly lack,” Severus replied, removing his hand.</p>
<p class="p5">Draco whined. “I didn’t mean stop.”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus finally returned the smirk. “Rest assured, I am not stopping.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco hadn’t realized he closed his eyes, and he opened them to see Severus dipping a finger into a jar of lube. Draco let out a noise somewhere between a whimper, a moan, and the final croak of a dying frog at the image. Not one of his finer moments.</p>
<p class="p5">“Draco, spread your legs.”</p>
<p class="p5">He did as instructed. He shouldn’t have been turned on by Severus sounding as he did in the classroom, but he was. He also lifted his knees, giving Severus better access.</p>
<p class="p5">“Are you going to come again as soon as I am inside you?” Severus asked conversationally, circling his hole and gently pressing.</p>
<p class="p5">Draco pushed down uncontrollably. “<em>Ohh.</em> No. Probably not. See for yourself. Maybe when you—<em>fuck.</em>” He broke off as Severus pushed a finger inside. Draco thrust down against him, needing more contact, more friction, more everything, and then he brushed his prostate and that was a <em>lot</em> more and he screamed again. “Sev, <em>fuck</em>, more.”</p>
<p class="p5">“I feel like I shouldn’t encourage your ego, but you are <em>incredibly</em> erotic,” Severus said lowly, and Draco almost came from his words alone, never mind the second finger he added and the way he was being so skillfully stretched. A slight burn, just enough to heighten the pleasure, and the continual teasing his prostate. Draco knew he was attractive, but the thought of Severus noticing or finding his body erotic, that was nigh unbelievable.</p>
<p class="p5">Despite the overwhelming feeling of Severus inside him, Draco attempted to use this new knowledge to his advantage. He arched up slightly, licked his lips and drew his bottom lip between his teeth, and ran a hand through his hair. Severus let out a hiss, and Draco spread his legs even further and gently wrapped a hand around himself, not stroking, just projecting the visual.</p>
<p class="p5">Severus growled deeply and shoved a third, then fourth finger into him, barely giving any warning at all. Draco screamed again, arching up uncontrollably, biting hard on the inside of his cheek to distract from the pain, and balling his hand in his hair because he needed to hold onto <em>something</em> and his hair was closest.</p>
<p class="p5">“Oh, <em>fuck</em>, Sev,” he moaned, voice cracking. “Merlin fucking <em>Christ</em>.”</p>
<p class="p5">“Am I hurting you?” Severus asked, not exactly sounding like he cared.</p>
<p class="p5">“Yeah, don’t stop,” Draco gasped. “Good, really good. Don’t stop.”</p>
<p class="p5">“Hmm, my little Draco is a masochist,” Severus mused, and Draco’s heart jumped at the possessiveness. “I find I am not surprised in the least.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco was so full, the fire equal parts pain and pleasure, his prostate slammed against so hard it would probably be bruised, but <em>fuck</em> it felt fantastic. Better than anything he had ever felt. Of course Severus would be his best lay, but this was better than any and all of his fantasies. And he had a lot of fantasies.</p>
<p class="p5">“Fine, whatever,” Draco breathed. “Just. Fuck me. Please.” Strictly speaking, a fuck was the last thing he wanted, but begging to be “made love to” was out of the question for so many reasons he couldn’t list them. Severus withdrew his fingers, and Draco moaned in disappointment. He was so empty, muscles fluttering around nothing, and he needed to be filled again <em>now</em>.</p>
<p class="p5">“Sev,” he whimpered. “Sev, please. Don’t tease. Fuck I need you. In me, fucking me, please, you.” He ran through his words and realized he may not have said the right thing. “Your cock. In me. So big, thick, <em>fuck</em>, please, fuck me, now, need you.”</p>
<p class="p5">Severus made that growling noise again as he settled between Draco’s legs, lining himself up and rubbing teasingly against his hole. “Keep talking.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco groaned. He didn’t usually talk during sex and was more well versed in dirty talk as a means to get someone in bed rather than an in bed activity, but he could wing it. Talking about Severus, that was easy. It was knowing when to shut up that would be the tricky part.</p>
<p class="p5">“Sev,” he moaned, pushing down, trying to get him inside. “Please fuck me. Please, Sev, your cock, I can feel you, <em>ugh</em>, leaking. Against me. Please, inside me. Feel you stretching me, leaking in me, <em>coming</em> in me.<em> God</em>, fuck, coming in me, filling me, <em>please</em> stop teasing me. <em>Please</em>.”</p>
<p class="p5">“Like this?” Severus asked teasingly, finally breaching the rim of tight muscles and sliding just his head inside.</p>
<p class="p5">Draco screamed again, throat starting to turn raw. “<em>Fuck</em> yes, more but more, Sev, oh fuck, you, just you.” He vaguely remembered that was wrong. “So good, you feel so good, more, all of you, <em>please</em>. You’re so big, I love you—love it, your cock, <em>please</em>, I need it.” Clearly he couldn’t trust himself, but he wasn’t able to be too upset, not when <em>Severus was inside him because they were having sex</em>. Of course he kept slipping, how the fuck could he not when they were <em>having sex</em>?</p>
<p class="p5">Severus slammed the rest of the way in, and Draco screamed again. “You’re so tight,” he said lowly, circling his hips. “Draco, so tight and hot, you feel so good.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco was going to explode. Everything. Just. Gone forever. He was going to remember those words forever. No matter what happened, Severus thought he felt good. He didn’t have the breath to respond or the mental capacities to figure out what to say, so he reverted to incoherent noises. When Severus started to thrust properly, Draco started screaming again, and he returned the hand that had drifted away to his base and held himself, once again on the edge.</p>
<p class="p5">“Move your hand,” Severus demanded.</p>
<p class="p5">“Can’t,” Draco breathed. “Fuck, Sev, gonna come.”</p>
<p class="p5">“I know,” Severus groaned. “I want to feel you around me.”</p>
<p class="p5">Draco whimpered. “I, uh, yeah, okay.” He loosened his grip, Severus sped up, and Draco came again, somehow stronger than the first time, and that shouldn’t have been possible, but evidently it was. Severus was <em>huge</em> inside him, rubbing against his prostate just by being there, Draco’s cock was rubbing between their chests, Severus leaned down and captured his lips in a kiss, and Draco was desperate against him, pulling him as close as physics allowed. He needed more, so much more, but he was still coming and Severus was still inside him, actually inside him, and impossibly hard, and everything was so <em>good</em>. Awful, too, but physically <em>astounding</em>.</p>
<p class="p5">Severus broke away just as the last few spurts shot between them. “<em>Merlin</em> Draco,” he moaned. “Fuck you’re tight.”</p>
<p class="p5">“Uhh, yeah,” Draco sighed, shivering as Severus continued to slam into his over-sensitized body and rub against his over-sensitized flesh. He forced a smirk onto his face. “Still hard, too.” Severus rammed into him, and he shrieked, smirk gone.</p>
<p class="p5">“Maybe,” Severus panted. “But I’m not screaming.”</p>
<p class="p5">“I don’t care,” Draco groaned. “<em>So</em> good.” He managed one more coherent thought before losing himself completely. “You were moaning about me. Don’t need to prove myself.”</p>
<p class="p5">“Shut up.”</p>
<p class="p5">And then everything was gone but Severus and the friction and pressure and <em>Severus</em>. Draco couldn’t do anything other than lie there and let Severus take him, but neither of them seemed to mind. Draco had no idea how long it lasted, only that it wasn’t nearly long enough—as in not forever—before he was on the edge again and Severus’ thrusts grew erratic.</p>
<p class="p5">Severus gave a final thrust, slamming in as far and hard as he could before coming. He moaned continually, filling Draco in a way he never had been, and Draco came as well, the orgasm ripping through him, screaming his name. Severus collapsed onto him and Draco turned boneless, so exhausted he didn’t understand how he was awake.</p>
<p class="p5">Severus rolled off him, cleaned them both with a quick spell, and lay on his back, relaxing. Draco wanted to move against him for more cuddles but he didn’t think that would end well so he stayed where he was, also on his back and half a bed away.</p>
