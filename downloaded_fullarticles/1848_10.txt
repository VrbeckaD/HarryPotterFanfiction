"Just keep your head down Mcgonagall says, ha!  Bloody lot of good that does me when the bloody woman seems to have a vendetta against me- I can't take another detention with that bloody cow-" Harry Potter ranted hand stinging.<br/>
<br/>
"What did I just hear you say young man?" A woman's voice had him jumping out of his skin<br/>
<br/>
"Uh, Madam Pomfrey, ah, I just, um, walking and heard a voice saying horrible things about cows, did you hear that too?"  Harry asked.<br/>
<br/>
Madam Pomfrey glared at him.<br/>
<br/>
"Um, and you're looking lovely this evening?"<br/>
<br/>
Her lips thinned, not good Harry, run, run while you still can!<br/>
<br/>
She looked down and saw him clutching his hand and he fidgeted, he couldn't help it and she saw it, the bleeding wound caused by hours of writing "I must not tell lies" with a blood-quill.<br/>
<br/>
"Ow, bloody- ow! will you stop twisting my- Ow! -ear!" Harry rubbed his ear after the long trek he'd been dragged by it all the way to the hospital wing.<br/>
<br/>
"Sit, stay."  She commanded him and he reluctantly sat after judging his chances of escaping for longer than a few minutes as next to none.<br/>
<br/>
"What happened to do no harm?" He hissed as she painfully grabbed his hand in her claw and spread something gray that smelled like manure on his cut hand that stung and then.. hurt worse as it steamed away leaving clear unbroken skin.<br/>
<br/>
"I wouldn't have had to if you hadn't tried running.  Now, just who did this to you?" The Healer demanded.  Harry didn't- no one ever believed him about anything and she was from the ministry... and besides, this was between him and her, a contest of wills,he didn't need help anyway.<br/>
<br/>
"Um, I tripped and fell on a very oddly shaped knife." He tried.<br/>
<br/>
"Ow! ow!  Alright, it was Umbridge's detentions!" Harry rubbed his other ear glaring daggers at the woman.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh.  I wish I could help you directly Potter but I'm just a healer, it'd be hearsay and she's..."<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, I figured as much."  Harry said dejected even as he'd expected as much.<br/>
<br/>
"There's a way you can get out of detentions with her but I'm not sure you'll like it." She admitted.<br/>
<br/>
Harry's eyes wide he said "Sold and I'll buy two more to go, can I get fries with that too?" with barely tinged sarcasm.<br/>
<br/>
"Ow!  Why do you hate ears!" Harry yelled.<br/>
<br/>
"Stop being a smart arse and I'll stop.  Sadly I doubt that will happen considering you have accepted my offer."<br/>
<br/>
"What?  I was being sarcastic!"  Harry worried what the foul woman would do to him, maybe Umbridge could save him?  Wait, what was he saying!?<br/>
<br/>
"I know Trainee Healer Potter, I just don't care."  Madam Pomfrey said smugly.<br/>
<br/>
Evil loathsome woman...</p>
<hr/><p>The next few weeks were boring enough as Harry was forced to in every spare minute to be in the Healer's office touching nothing but the books she loaned him to read, a quill and parchment to take notes and when she was there his wand on people transfigured from rats which was <em>weird</em>.  They twitched and would run at the slightest provocation if you didn't keep them strapped down and they were biters.   <br/>
<br/>
He couldn't help but thinking no wonder Madam Pomfrey was such a shrew if she had to deal with transfigured ones so much.<br/>
<br/>
Still, it did actually get him out of detentions, the next time he had seen Umbridge after Madam Pomfrey's decision she turned the same red as Uncle Vernon looking anywhere but him, evidently trying the same tact the Dursley's occasionally had by pretending he didn't exist.</p>
<hr/><p>"Potter, I have some paperwork to catch up on, so you get to play healer.  Call for Nippy the Elf to come get me or knock on my office door if you have need of me.   You do remember my golden rule?" Madam Pomphrey knew he didn't as she'd not yet told him but thought the answer would be amusing.<br/>
<br/>
"If the patients annoy you hurt them by twisting their ear?  Ow!  That's not a no! Ow!  Merlin!"  Harry rubbed his sore ear while Madam Pomphrey grinned.<br/>
<br/>
She smirked, "No, but I rather like that one.  No the golden rule is no questions asked unless you absolutely need the answer to treat them. No stories told either.  Students have a hard enough time coming in here when it's just cuts that are no fault of their own except certain stubborn ones-" She gave him a pointed look, "-but many get injured, hexed, poisoned, potioned doing something against school rules or something embarrassing, often both, and we don't want them hiding injuries like stubborn idiots, so no questions asked, no stories told, understand?"<br/>
<br/>
"No but I'll follow it anyway- ow! Merlin's short hair's I said I'd do it!" Harry said clutching his ear.<br/>
<br/>
"Good, now out you get, good luck Potter... You're going to need it." Pomfrey said almost kindly</p><p>"Oh, and if it's something you can solve yourself and you bother me about it and interrupt my work your ears will never be the same again." She added threateningly slamming office door shut in his face.<br/>
<br/>
"I can see the romance novel you're reading you know, there's a window on the door!"  Harry shouted through the door before scampering off as she moved to get up hand already reaching out as if for his ear.</p>
