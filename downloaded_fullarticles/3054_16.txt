  <p>The collar round his slender throat made Draco<br/>
madly want. "Do you recall your safety word?"<br/>
asked Harry, voice dripping lust and need.<br/>
At Draco's nod, a grin lit Harry's face.<br/>
"Get on your fours," he ordered in demand.<br/>
So Draco turned on hands and knees, his bum<br/>
up in the air. The collar chafed, but Draco didn't care.<br/>
The first hot lash of Harry's tongue brought forth<br/>
a primal moan, and Draco squirmed upon<br/>
the bed, his hands clenched in the silken sheets.<br/>
That wicked tongue did not let up; instead,<br/>
it carried on with tender licks, while teeth<br/>
got in some naughty nibbles of their own.<br/>
And through it all, did Draco writhe and twist<br/>
upon the bed, silken sheets in trembling hands.<br/>
His parted lips let passion slip in form of sighs.</p>
  <p>That clever tongue (oh wicked tongue!) began<br/>
to ply his hole, and Draco lost any hold<br/>
he had on his control. His spine dipped in<br/>
a perfect arch to raise his arse up high.<br/>
He begged, he groaned, he shook and moaned for want<br/>
of some relief. Harry kept him on the edge,<br/>
withholding sweet release. He used his tongue,<br/>
that wicked tongue, to tempt and taste and tease.<br/>
He kissed and probed and licked that hole<br/>
ignoring Draco's pleas. "Don't make me wait,"<br/>
he begged, so close now to that edge.<br/>
Harry strove to keep him dancing on the ledge.<br/>
A tremor ran through Draco's frame, a bead<br/>
formed at his slit and dribbled on the sheets.<br/>
His sobs and bleats, his cries of need remained<br/>
unheeded in that bed as Harry's tongue,<br/>
that naughty tongue, drove Draco mad, indeed.<br/>
He held onto his safety word, in spite<br/>
of how he ached, trusting Harry to<br/>
deliver sweet release, which Harry did.<br/>
He reached between and underneath<br/>
to tickle Draco's balls. It was all it took<br/>
for Draco to achieve his sweet release.<br/>
He screamed, he came, he felt no shame,<br/>
his body convulsing in bliss. Replete<br/>
at last, heart beating fast, collapsing on<br/>
his side. Then Harry's lips, licentious lips,<br/>
bestowed one final kiss. He sat back with<br/>
a cheeky grin and said, "Now open wide."</p>
