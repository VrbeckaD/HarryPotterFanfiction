"</p><p>The petite woman left and a moment later ushered in an overweight man with a grey mustache. Draco rose and extended his hand. "Mr. Wiseman. What can we do for you today?"</p><p>The man stuffed himself into the chair opposite Draco and wiped his sweaty mustache with his hand. Draco clenched his fists. He'd have to sanitize his hands after this.</p><p>"I'd like to withdraw $20,000," The man said. </p><p>Draco sat up a little straighter. "You've only had your investments in holdings for 2 years, Sir, and we've done prospects for a 5 year period. Are you sure you want to do this?" </p><p>Mr. Wiseman wiped his face again. "Yes, I'm sure. I need that $20,000 early. I need it."  </p><p>Draco pulled some parchment towards himself on the desk. "Very well, what are you planning to do with the money, if you don't mind me asking?" Draco looked up after writing a few things down on his ledger. He leaned to the side to pull open the drawer of his desk and pulled out the single key that could access Mr. Wiseman's funds. The had gone red in the face and Draco was about to apologize.</p><p>"Sir-"  </p><p>"It's for CRS." </p><p><em>Oh. </em>Draco didn't know what CRS was so he decided not to pry.</p><p>"Well then, here's you're key. If you'll follow me." </p><p>Draco led Mr. Wiseman through the building, to a goblin bank teller. Once he'd handed off his client, he returned to his office. Draco told his assistant to take his calls, as he was leaving for the day.</p>
