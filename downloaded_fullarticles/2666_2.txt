    <p>Harry's pov 

</p><p>Chapter 1: the veil</p><p> </p><p>"Stupify!"  "Expelliarmus!"</p><p> </p><p>Glass shattering.   Too many voices talking at once.  We run.</p><p> </p><p>"Give me the prophecy, Potter," Lucius Malfoy demands.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't give it to him, Harry!" Neville shouts.</p><p> </p><p>"Stay away from my godson!"</p><p> </p><p>"Sirius!"</p><p> </p><p>He fell.  He fell behind the curtain.  The veil.  A this shimmering curtain in a large stone archway.  Hes only just fallen through!  I can reach him.  I can pull him back.  They scream for me to stop but I'm too fast.  No one can stop me.  I wont let them stop me!</p><p> </p><p>I leap through.  The curtain feels weird, liquid like or perhaps gas.  A strange sense of vertigo hits me hard.  I'm falling.  I can't see.  I can't hear.  I try to scream.  I'm just falling.  

</p><p>Falling.  

</p><p>Falling.</p><p> </p><p>I land hard.  My breath is knocked out.  

</p><p>Wet grass.  I roll with the fall.  Rolling down hill.  Grass, trees, night.  I stop.  

</p><p>My name whispered nearby.  Sirius!</p><p>I don't know how long I'm unconscious.  All I know is I come awake with Sirius wrapped around me.  We're hidden in a hollowed out tree.  Sirius must've dragged us in here.  But how?  I can barely move.  My limbs heavy, far too heavy.

</p><p>The air smells green and clean and so very different from what I'm used to.  It's similar to the forbidden forest and yet it's different.  It doesn't have that oppressive dark and cursed feeling.  Instead it feels clean and vibrant and bright.  Safe.  It feels safe.

</p><p>I must have made some kind of noise because Sirius wakes.  He huffs and sniffles against my hair.  He's too tired to even keep his eyes open.  But then, so am I.  His voice is as exhausted as I feel, "Sleep, pup, we're safe for now."

</p><p>Perhaps not the most comforting thing I've ever been told but at least I'm not alone.  I don't know where I am or if we're safe  but at least I'm still with Sirius.  And it's weird to be held like this, weird but nice.  This must be what it's like to have parents.</p>
