    <p>Harry made his way down the hall, nearly tripping on his small robes. He had a thumb in his mouth and moved to knock on a door he couldn't yet reach the handle to.</p><p>Draco perked up from his toys at the knock, waiting a beat before standing and walking over to the door. His parents would have knocked before coming straight in. Which means it was someone else.</p><p>"Comin'." He said a little louder than normal, before reaching for the handle he was know just tall enough to open without having to get on his tiptoes. Behind the door was Harry. Draco smiled. "Hawwy!" He said happily, before pouting a bit. He still had trouble getting his 'r's out, and his parents had gotten him a tutor to help him out.</p><p>“Hewo Dwagon!" The child happily chirped up to his friend. He gave the blond a toothy grin, peeking his head inside the room.</p><p>"Hi." Draco replied, taking his friend’s hand and bringing him into the room. "I didn' know you wewe comin' today, I must have fowgot." The blond giggled lightly.</p><p>"Papa said he wannad uncle Wuci's help wif somtin'," The smaller boy said, holding on to the other's hand tightly. Severus had needed advice on acquiring a potion ingredient so he decided to pay the Malfoys a quick visit, Harry tagging along to see 'his favowit Dwagon'.</p><p>"Uncle Sev is hewe?" Draco asked. He loved sitting next to his Godfather as he watched the man brew potions. But enjoyed spending time with Harry more.</p><p>Harry nodded with a grin, following Draco to the toys strewn across the floor. He happily sat and nearly bounced with excitement, eager to play with the older boy.</p><p>Draco giggled when he noticed something on Harry's face. "You'we messy." Draco stated, reaching forward and wiping Harry's face with a little handkerchief he had.</p><p>Harry didn't mind too much at the action, preferring it was Draco, rather than anyone else. He moved to sit close to the grey eyed boy, careful not to sit on him.</p><p>Draco shuffled closer to Harry, even though it was pretty much impossible, leaning over to grab one of his toys to show off to Harry, before his tummy rumbled, causing the blond to blush.</p><p>Harry giggled, his hand coming up to muffle the sound as his shoulders shook. "Souns like my Dwagon! Hear him roar!"</p><p>Draco pouted. "Is not my fault. I'm hungwy. Let's go get a snack fwom de kitden." Draco said, moving to stand.</p><p>Harry looked away, being reminded of what happened just a bit earlier. He, too, stood. "N-no sweths, ‘kay?" He asked a bit hesitantly.</p><p>Draco had already gotten to the door, turning to his friend with a confused expression. "Why? Sweets awe de best."</p><p>"But D-dwagon," Said the small, now teary-eyed boy as he approached his friend.</p><p>"What is it Haw-Haw-Harwy?" said the older, pouting when he couldn’t get his friends name right once again.</p><p>"Uncle Wuci said sweths were bad... said I coulnt eat them" He told the blond.</p><p>"But Daddy always lets me eat all de sweets I wan'." The blond said, confused.</p><p>"Tol' me I coulnt 'av tweacle tar!" Cried the smaller. He looked tearily up to Draco, and held out his hands the way he did whenever the ravenette needed a hug.</p><p>"That won' do." The older said, hugging his friend. "I'w talk to Momma." And so the blond took his teary friend to his mother for sweets.</p><p>Narcissa seemed troubled. Handing the small boy a treat, which he gladdy began to nibble on. She went to have a talk with her husband. The two boys, oblivious to what was happening around them, happily went to play with the new toys Draco had gotten. The blond's favorite being an enchanted dragon that could fly and breath fire.</p><p>Harry liked the small flying creature, it reminding him of the blond himself. He giggled a bit as he watched the small reptile land in his messy black hair. Draco couldn't help but laugh as well, a wide smile on his face as he watched the dragon laying down in what it has apparently claimed it's new nest. Harry's eyes drifted over to his friends, a smile settling on his face at his grinning face. He loved when Draco was happy.</p><p>A bit later, Narcissa poked her head in the room. "Harry dear?" The small boy looked up to her. She entered the room, moving to sit by the raven haired child. "Did you happen to eat all the treacle tarts we were saving for dessert tonight?" The older female asked. At the question, Harry bit his lip and looked down.</p><p>Draco's eyebrows came together with confusion. When realization hit, he gasped. "Hawwy ate desewt befowe dinner?"</p><p>The green eyed boy continued to not meet the others gaze, the tips of his ears a bright pink. "I dint mean to... no won twold me no... no won was tere... and dey just sat tere..." The smaller said, in an ashamed voice.</p><p>Draco stared at the younger. He was mad. But he couldn't stay mad when those green eyes began to tear with shame. And Draco remembered eating all the truffles on many occasions. Or maybe it was only once and there were a lot of truffles. He couldn't remember those details exactly. So with a huff, he pulled Harry to him. "Naughty Hawwy." He said. "You always ask befowe you take somethin’. You told me that, wemember?" The grey eyed boy tried to catch the other's eye.</p><p>Seeing the glint in the others liquid mercury, he gave a very small nod. He glanced up to the tall woman, bowing his head. "Im sowy..."</p><p>Narcissa sighed, shaking her head softly. Motherhood was making her soft, being unable to be angry with those forest green eyes. Her husband could have a fit all he wanted, the man didn't need dessert anyways. "You're forgiven. But remember Harry, and this goes for you too, Draco. If you want something, you have to ask first." </p><p>Harry nodded eagerly before he was surprised by the dragon who had taken the boy's hair as his new home, as it leapt out and circled his head, giving a tiny roar in the direction of Narcissa. Harry burst into a fit of giggles, the situation so funny to him. Draco giggled a little as well, his mother huffing lightly at the toy. The three didn't notice Snape peek his head in to tell Harry they were staying for dinner, seeing his adopted son laughing with his best friend as a toy dragon flew around and roared at Narcissa. The potions master shook his head fondly, risking a small smile.</p>
