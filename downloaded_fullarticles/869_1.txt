    <p>I threw my cigarette on the floor, crushing it with the tip of my boot, as a man appeared. Under his hood I could tell he was bald and I could see a large scar running down one of his cheeks. Dressed in all black, he walked over carrying a small, black sports bag. I eye it carefully, not wanting any tricks.</p><p>“Lovely weather this evening?” He asks once he’s near enough. Although we were stood in a dark alley, the sound of rushing cars travelled from far away. The question prompts me to answer with the code I was given.</p><p>“I always preferred the June sun.” He nods stiffly at my reply.</p><p>“Griffin?” He checks and I nod a reply. He chucks the bag on the floor by my feet, and I throw my identical one to him. He looks inside, counting the money. “Perfect.” He says before leaving and I head back to my car. I check the bag, seeing a couple bags of marijuana and a small, clear bag with a dozen or so small pills in. I open the boot, placing the bag in the empty spare wheel slot and cover it smoothly with the carpet before getting in and driving off.</p><p>As I’m driving down the long stretch of road, I check the time and see I’m behind schedule. If I was late, it was to be assumed something had gone wrong and the others would be out looking for me. I had to get back on time before they started crawling the streets in search for me. The police were already getting pissy with us. I press down harder on the throttle, going up a couple gears and speeding down the road at 90. I turn my music up and focus on getting back quickly.</p><p>Suddenly, something catches the corner of my eye and in my rear view mirror I see blue flashing lights.</p><p>“Fuck.” I mutter under my breath. I turn my music down but don’t lower my speed, instead turning off down a road into a housing estate where I know I can lose them. I zig zag down streets upon streets of houses, my engine roaring loudly through the small town I’ve ducked into. By now I was going to be back way too late and I was too far from home to get there quick enough. Still, I’d rather be late home than caught by the pigs.</p><p>I glance in my rear view mirror, seeing the blue lights have gone, and smile. I don’t lower my speed, but as I turn a corner I see the police car parked across the road, lights blaring, waiting for me. Both police officers have exited the car and are standing with shit eating grins on their faces. I panic, slamming on the breaks before I crash into them. I get out as one walks over.</p><p>“Sir, you are being arrested on charges of dangerous driving.” I give him a once over as I shut the door behind me. He’s blond, with silver eyes and a strong jawline. He’s taller than me, maybe not as muscular but he could definitely pin me down if he needed to. Or wanted to. “You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can or will be held against you in a court of law.” He presses me face down onto the bonnet, where he then attaches a pair of handcuffs to me.</p><p>“We’ve only just met and you’re tying me up? Officer, I’m flattered.” I flirt, feeling his crotch lightly press against my ass.</p><p>“I said you have the right to remain silent.” He reminds me, his voice sending shivers down my bag.</p><p>“Mhmm. But it’s just a suggestion, right? I’m much better at following orders.” I press back against him and I can sense the gasp he holds back. He ignores what I say and looks to his coworker.</p><p>“Get this towed back to the station. We’ll find someone to return it to tomorrow.” The officer nods, before speaking into his radio.</p><p>Blondie hauls me into the back of the police car and we wait for a truck to arrive to pick up my car. I watch with horror and worry about what they’ll find when they search it.</p><p>No. No. Not when. If. I’m only getting done for speeding. I can pay the fine easy. They won’t search my car for drugs. I’m fine.</p><p>Once we reach the station after an awkward car ride, I’m taken in for questioning, mostly so they can get my details, but the officer who’s interviewing me – Not Blondie, but some big fucker who’s an absolute dullhard – is making me infuriated.</p><p>“What’s your name, kid?”</p><p>“Tyler. Tyler Lee Joseph.” I lie through my teeth.</p><p>“Age?”</p><p>“21.” Another lie.</p><p>“Gender?”</p><p>“My gender? Was that not obvious? What’s my dick got to do with this? Sorry I didn’t realise I was at a speed dating event. How many siblings do you have? Any pet peeves?” I could tell my voice was growing louder.</p><p>“I suggest you calm down kid. What’s your gender? What’s in between your legs? Not that difficult, kid.” I stare at him blankly. Where do I begin with this?</p><p>“I suggest you learn the difference between sex and gender. But I’m a dude with a dick.”</p><p>“You sure about that?”</p><p>“Ask your father. He’s a big fan.” I can barely handle my anger. I thought getting done for speeding was way simpler than this? Douchebag throws a pink card onto the table and it slides to me. I take one glance and look away.</p><p>“Miss Hayley Lily Potter. 19 years old. Female. With a vagina.” He speaks bluntly. I can’t contain my anger and slam my hands on the table.</p><p>“I DEMAND to speak with another officer THIS INSTANT! I don’t give a FUCK what you think about people like me but I REFUSE to answer ANY MORE of your questions your fucking ARSEWIPE!” Spit flies from my mouth and the door opens quickly. I look up to see my saviour, Blondie, looking on concerned.</p><p>“Officer Goyle. Everything alright?” He asks.</p><p>“No! It fucking isn’t! I refuse to speak with this twat! I don’t give two shits if he’s a policeman! He’s a cunt and he knows it!” I shout in answer, interrupting the man opposite me.</p><p>“Officer Goyle, I think Officer Crabbe was looking for you.” Blondie ignores my existence, but thankfully ‘Goyle’ gets up and leaves. Blondie takes his place. He studies me for a second, and I realise now I must look like shit. I’d gone straight from working in the garage to the deal, so my face was still dirty. Blondie sees the card on the table – my driving license – and picks it up.</p><p>“So, name?” He asks, putting the license away in his pocket.</p><p>“Tyler Lee Joseph.” I lie again.</p><p>“I said your name, kid. Not some made up shit.” I sigh, my stomach twisting.</p><p>“Hayley - ”</p><p>“Third time lucky, kid. Name. Your name. The words people use to get your attention.” He rolls his eyes. Something in me lifts.</p><p>“Harry. Harry James Potter.” I say, a small smile etching onto my lips.</p><p>“And your age?”</p><p>“19.” The truth this time. Something crosses Blondie’s face, almost like relief. I shake it off.</p><p>“May I ask why you were speeding?”</p><p>“Trying to get home quickly. Friends get worried and I can’t have them prowling the streets for me late at night again. You lot have had ‘em in for it.” Blondie looks in thought for a second and then speaks.</p><p>“You’re not from the Griffins, are you?” He asks.</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>“How is it that you guys are the most lawless people in this town and yet we can’t bring you in because we’ve no concrete evidence?” I shrug my shoulders.</p><p>“What can I say, I run a tight ship and everyone else does as told.”</p><p>“So you’re the leader, huh?” Blondie raises an eyebrow. “The Griffin King. I’m honoured.” He drawls sarcastically.</p><p>“Enough about me. Tell me about yourself.”</p><p>“No.” He shrugs me off. “Back to your speeding. You’ll be fined £200 and given three points on your license as well as a three month ban.” I frown slightly. “Just so long as I don’t see you back here anytime soon. Think of it as a gift.”</p><p>“Because I’m so hot?” He doesn’t deny it. In fact, he smiles a bit. “What if I am back here soon?” I tempt.</p><p>“If you’re here any time soon then trust me, I’ll make you learn how to follow orders quick enough.”</p><p>“Is that a threat, Officer?”</p><p>“It’s a promise. Now, get out of here.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
