    <p>     Draco groggily awoke to a loud voice coming from the parlor. He sighed, instantly knowing that the voice belonged to a man named Lucius Malfoy, his father. Not wanting to go downstairs and direct his father's rage towards himself, he sat up in bed and checked the time. His grandfather clock showed that it was 7:16 AM.</p><p>     "What the hell is he yelling for? Jesus Christ, I can't catch a break anymore." Draco said aloud.</p><p>     Draco got out of bed and opened the door to his closet. The day was important, being his eighteenth birthday, so he had to dress formally. He slipped out of his embroidered silk pajama set and into a sleek suit. He grabbed his wand and slipped it into a thin pocket on the inside of his blazer. After he finished getting ready, Draco finally left his room and went downstairs. He mentally prepared himself for the worst; his father was especially uptight today. After sneaking a peek into the parlor and finding it empty, Draco went into the kitchen. His mother was reading at the breakfast bar, her face stoic though he could see the rage in her eyes. Lucius would often yell at Narcissa. Ever since the war, he became even haughtier.</p><p>     Draco cleared his throat and his mother directed her attention towards him, "Are you okay, Mom? I heard yelling earlier."</p><p>     "Draco, we're not going to talk about it. It had nothing to do with you." His mother replied, obviously lying.</p><p>     Draco grabbed an apple and returned to his room, locking his door. He needed a break from the stress of his home life. He grabbed his headphones from his bedside table and plugged them into his phone while turning on music. He sat on his bed with his eyes closed for an hour until his father rapped on his door.</p><p>     "Draco, open this door at once!"</p><p>     Draco removed his headphones, sighed, and whispered, "Alohomora."</p><p>     His father opened his door and entered his room with his cloak flowing behind him. Lucius eyed his son, laying on his bed with a frown on his face.</p><p>     "As you know, today is your... birthday. I remind you that we have guests coming at 5 in the evening. I assume you will be ready by then?" Lucius raised his eyebrow.</p><p>     "I already look lovely, don't I?" Draco smirked.</p><p>     Lucius' face leered, "If you're going to be a cocky brat then you can get out of my house."</p><p>     "Jeez, I love you too, Dad," Draco said under his breath.</p><p>     Lucius' hand shot out from under his cloak and collided with Draco's cheek <em>- smack.</em></p><p>     He whispered, "Don't talk back to me, do you understand?"</p><p>     Draco stared, his father's face turned red as he shouted, "DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?"</p><p>     "Yes, Father," he replied.</p><p>     Lucius swiftly exited the room and slammed the door on his way out. As soon as the door struck the frame, a tear slid down Draco's red cheek. His father slapped him all the time, but it would still catch him by surprise. </p><p>     Draco took a shaky breath, "I need to leave this shithole."</p><p>     Soon enough, it was time for the party. It was a very drab celebration, consisting of only Lucius' guests. Draco wasn't permitted to invite his friends to such a formal event, despite them coming from such wealthy families. The party seemed to go on for ages, the only talk was about blood status and high-class families. He couldn't believe that even though Voldemort was dead, his family only cared about how pure they were. At least there was a cake - it was 3 tiered and covered in smooth vanilla frosting with dark green serpents.</p><p>     "Don't mind if I do," Draco said while making his to the cake table.</p><p>     Draco ate and waited for the party to finish. Finally, 3 hours later, the guests left and he went inside. He was almost to his room when his mother called to him.</p><p>     "Draco? Your father and I have to talk to you."</p><p>     Draco turned to his mother and father and they led him into the parlor. Lucius gestured to a chair and Draco sat down. </p><p>     His father cleared his throat, "Since you're of age, your mother and I believe you should move out."</p><p>     "Oh, where am I going to go?'</p><p>     "It's up to you, you're the one that's going to be paying for it." his father replied.</p><p>     Draco looked bewildered, "Wait, you're not paying? I don't have a job or anything."</p><p>     "As an adult, you need to be able to provide for yourself. Your mother and I are helping you by making you leave, you need to be independent. Even if times get bad, we Malfoys always fend for ourselves. So, I expect you to be gone by next week." Lucius said.</p><p>     Draco nodded though he was obviously shocked, "Yes, Father."</p><p> </p><p>  </p><p> </p>
