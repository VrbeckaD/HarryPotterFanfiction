          <div class="userstuff"><p>Molly Weasley was cooking in the kitchen.</p><p>She was awaiting the moment when her son Charlie would arrive home to visit the family. He had written a few ago asking if it was alright to come and visit during the summer break.</p><p>Molly, of course, responded with enthusiasm at the thought of seeing her son who she hadn't seen since Christmas the year prior.</p><p>Just as she was chopping some parsley to add to the pot she heard a peculiar noise.</p><p>It startled her, to say the least when she saw a small Ford driving through the fields and towards the Burrow.</p><p>After staring at the car for a minute as it got closer and closer with a soft drawl of the engine and clouds of dust following in its wake she realised that this was something unexpected.</p><p>"Arthur!"</p><p>Within minutes everyone was gathered downstairs including the twins, Ron, Ginny and oh, Harry was here too!</p><p>They all wanted to know what the commotion was about and why the normally soft and composed Molly Weasley was screaming bloody murder.</p><p>"Calm down, mum!" Fred started.</p><p>"It's probably just, Bill," shrugged George, finishing the thought off.</p><p>Molly wasn't convinced and she rushed to the door the second she heard a light knock.</p><p>As she walked closer she heard murmuring followed by a loud banging on the door.</p><p>"Coming!"</p><p>She unlatched the wooden door and swung it open so violently that the giggling girl on the other side went quiet, hearing the bang of the door against the wall.</p><p>It made Molly, the unknown girl and Charlie, who Molly had just now noticed, all flinch.</p><p>"Charlie!" Molly pulled her son down by his shoulders and hugged him tightly which he reciprocated a tad less intensely, already used to the overly affectionate actions of his mother.</p><p>The girl shuffled her feet and stared at the ground awkwardly. She didn't want to interrupt the lovely reunion.</p><p>Molly was not having that.</p><p>In less than a second, the girl found herself being embraced by the short woman. Thankfully, a tad less enthusiastically.</p><p>"And who might you be, pumpkin?" the ginger-headed mother asked holding the younger girl's face in her palms.</p><p>"(Y/N). Lovely to meet you, Mrs Weasley." </p><p>"Oh, please sweetie-pie! Call me Molly!"</p><p>As everyone's heads popped around the corner to see who it was, Molly ushered the young couple inside.</p><p>"So (Y/N) is my girlfriend as you can probably tell," Charlie said, scratching the back of his head.</p><p>"Damn," George scowled as he handed Fred a few coins.</p><p>"That's lovely dear!" Molly grinned at her son.</p><p>(Y/N) was greeted by the insane amount of Weasleys and small black-haired harry. It all seemed as though it was going well until, while everyone was filing into the minuscule kitchen, a scream was heard.</p><p>Charlie, instantly recognising the noise as his girlfriend, ran into the living room where the girl was flattened as much as possible against the wall with her hand outstretched and finger-pointing at the chair in the corner of the room.</p><p>"Ch-Charlie! Why is the scarf knitting itself?!" she was obviously shaken up by the sight.</p><p>The second oldest Weasley sibling bust into intense giggles. The scream and his chortles of laughter confused everyone until Charlie responded through his tears of laughter.</p><p>"Love, that's another one of those magic things we talked about! I knew this would happen!"</p><p>(Y/N) relaxed visibly but now a small pout was visible on her face.</p><p>"How come she doesn't know that Charlie?" Molly asked her son, confused as if the youngling in her living room had just turned into a zebra. Which would probably have been less shocking.</p><p>"She's..a-uh...She's a muggle," Charlie replied innocently.</p><p>"A muggle?" Ron shouted. Harry's eyebrows nearly hit the ceiling with how fast they shot up.</p><p>You grimaced slightly but quickly quipped back with a hint of snark.</p><p>"The muggle has a name you know."</p><p>Harry's eyes widened even further, though that was almost impossible, and glanced between you and Ron.</p><p>As Molly gained her composure and smacked the back of Ron's head, her face morphed into a smirk and soon you found yourself encompassed in her soft, warm grasp. She was hugging you again as Ron muttered about child abuse or something.</p><p>"That's perfectly fine dear. As I see it, you're a lovely young lady that makes our Charlie happy. There's no issue with you being a tad bit more...ordinary."</p><p>"Mum!" Charlie gasped, "You can't say that."</p><p>The older Weasley quickly corrected herself and apologised but not before you let out a chuckle.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, love. We're a family of doers, not say-ers." Charlie muttered, wrapping an arm around your waist.</p><p>"I can see that." you grinned back at your boyfriend.</p><p>"Let's just get dinner going. The old-fashioned way," Molly said as she huddled everyone into the kitchen, "Who's on potato peeling duty?"</p><p>"I'll do it!"</p></div>
