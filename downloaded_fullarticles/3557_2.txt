    <p>Peter woke up. That was the first clue something was Not Right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last thing Peter remembered was the feeling of falling apart. Every atom in his body had felt like they were forcefully disconnecting. He recalled how his spider-sense had somehow picked up on the fact that half the universe was dying, and that he was going to be next. Peter remembered watching as one by one, the Guardians of the Galaxy turned to dust. And he remembered feeling suddenly and overwhelmingly afraid as he collapsed in Mr. Stark’s arms, filled with excruciating pain beyond anything he had ever felt before. He had realized at that moment how afraid he was of dying. How scared he was of leaving his aunt and friends behind. How he was going to die at age <em>16 </em>and how nobody could prevent it. But the facts were, no matter how afraid he had been, Peter had still died. So, it made no sense that he was alive enough to be waking up. Nevertheless how he was alive at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As awareness returned to Peter, he realized that he was laying on his back in what felt like a hospital bed. He slowly lifted himself up to a sitting position. As he looked around, Peter grasped how strange the situation was. The hospital he was in was like none he’d ever seen before. First of all, there were intricate carvings in the ceiling that made it look like it belonged in some antiquitous and weathered Renaissance structure. Just how rich were the owners of the hospital to have that architectural feature in such a building? Second of all, intimidating arched windows with sheer curtains covering them lined the walls of the room. How old was this building? Third of all, there were rows of identical empty cots on either side of him. What type of place needed that many hospital beds in just one room? Fourth of all, there were no doctors or nurses anywhere around him. How did he get here? And last of all, perhaps the weirdest thing about the room was the absence of the usual beeping of heart monitors and of IVs. What kind of hospital had no machines?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peter’s attention was drawn into the center of the room by the entrance of a lady he assumed must be the doctor. She was wearing a medical uniform that looked much more old-fashioned than of her appearance. And she looked as old as his grandma. Well, he assumed his grandma would have looked like that. Peter had never met either of his grandmas since they had both died long before he was born. Peter idly wondered why there was so much death in his life before he snapped back to the present. He focused back as the doctor gave the room a cursory glance before she spotted him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh good, you’re finally awake! We were beginning to think you’d sleep forever.”</p>
<p>“Where-” Peter cleared his throat “Where am I? Who are you? And how am I alive?”</p>
<p>“How about this; an answer for an answer. First, tell me your name, young man.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m Peter Man. I mean Spider Parker. No wait, it’s just Parker. Peter. Peter Parker. Peter Benjamin Parker.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well Mr. Parker, I’m Madam Pomfrey and you’re in the infirmary. You somehow arrived in the Great Hall during lunch around a week ago. You landed in Professor Snape’s plate of potatoes and gave us all quite a fright! And to answer your third question, you’re alive because I healed you here. You had many injuries including but not limited to: a concussion, three cracked ribs, a broken leg, and quite a bit of internal hemorrhaging.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peter frowned. That sounded bad, but he didn’t feel as shitty as he assumed he should, so he didn’t dwell on the injuries too much. Plus, right now there was a more pressing manner. Some of the things Madam Pomfrey had mentioned sounded vaguely familiar, but Peter’s brain was struggling to connect it all. “I still don’t understand… Where exactly am I?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey smile, not in a condescending way exactly, more like she was surprised that he still hadn’t comprehended what was happening. “Hogwarts, dear.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peter’s brain was working a little better now and he recognized that something about the whole thing seemed off. “Wait, what? Hogwarts? Snape? Oh, I get it. This must be a prank! And a really elaborate one at that. Mr. Stark or whoever else set this up really went all out. Is this payback for that time with the coffee. I already told him that I didn’t know my webs would explode when exposed to such high temperatures."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peter didn’t know when Mr. Stark would have had time to set this up between battling Thanos and probably helping with the aftermath of what Thanos had done, but he just figured that billionaires could do anything they wanted. Also, Peter was still waiting for an actual explanation of how he had survived the snap. (He had decided to call it that because referring to it as an evil maniac getting a bunch of stones and murdering people was too long, even in his head.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey’s smile dimmed. “What are you talking about. I have never heard of this ‘Mr. Stark.’ Is he a muggle or something? And as for the webs, I haven’t the slightest clue what you mean young man.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peter scoffed. “Alright, this isn’t funny.” He eased himself to his feet. He walked over to the window closest to him and pulled aside the drape. He gasped as he saw the view outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a huge expanse of green grass, similar to the football field at Peter’s school. However, this field was much larger than any athletics field that could have been funded by Midtown Tech, or any school in New York City for that matter. There were high-rising towers with bi-colored tarps covering them on both sides of the field. Additionally, there were goal posts with three hoops, fairly high above the area, on opposite ends of the field. The part that really managed to shock Peter (who thought he couldn’t ever be surprised again considering that he had recently fought a giant, murderous, purple, raisin looking alien with a weird name on an abandoned planet), however, was the fact that people seemed to be whizzing around the air on brooms with yellow or green uniforms. What could they have been doing, thought Peter. Quidditch, the part of his mind that was devoted to his all-time favorite book series supplied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well I’m fucked,” Peter whispered to himself before everything went wobbly and he promptly fainted.</p>
