    <p>The first time it happened was the night his name came out of the Goblet of Fire. He went to bed feeling terrible, not only was he emotionally drained, his body was aching all over, the day just couldn’t get worse.

He blacked out as soon as his head fell on the pillow.</p><p>What happened next was both new and confusing. He found himself in the great hall, the tables were gone, in their place there was lines of chairs, filled with students and teachers. The dais where the teachers table usually occupy was also empty, instead there was only Dumbledore's throne like chair. Harry found himself on his knees, chained to the throne. Naked as the day he was born.</p><p>He tried getting up but he couldn’t, the chain was not long enough for him to get on his feet and without his wand he couldn’t do anything about the chain. He cried out for help but the spectators didn’t move, didn’t even blink.</p><p>As he started having a panic attack a voice in the back of his mind whispered for him to calm down, immediately he went limp, a wave of calmness washed over him. It was eerily reminding him of the Imperious Curse. But Harry could feel it was different, that whatever this was, it was not a threat towards him, it was trying to help somehow. Perhaps it was a curse that made him feel like this, but he just couldn’t fight.</p><p>Harry’s musings were interrupted by footsteps, he looked at the direction of the sound and gasped at what he saw. Ron was waking to him, dressed in comfortable silk pants and expensive looking shoes. He was shirtless, showing off his pale, freckled skin, he was gangly and had copper colored hair beginning to grow on the middle of his chest.</p><p>The tall boy paused for a second to look at Harry before seating at the throne. No one did anything, it was like they were all there only to gaze at Ron like he was some kind of god.</p><p>Ron had his chest puffed out and a smug smile, he began caressing Harry's hair. He looked at home in this setting, something that Harry knew would not normally be true, as much as Ron wants recognition he got shy in the public eye just like Harry.</p><p>Suddenly Ron pulled his hair, making he look at him. “Well, get to work.”</p><p>Harry didn’t know what Ron wanted of him, but his body did. For a second Harry thought of fighting but then he let go of his control, from that point own he was but a passenger in his own body.</p><p>“Yes Master.” He answered, voice sultry.<br/>
Harry kissed Ron's knee, as it was so close to him before moving so he was kneeling in front of Ron, the chain tinkling loudly. Harry watched as his body took off one of Ron’s shoes, he looked at Ron who meet his eyes and smirked.</p><p>“Worship my foot slave.”</p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p>He leans forwards, he give a wet kiss at the sole of the foot before taking a sniff, breathing in the strong smell, it give him shivers. He started licking the sole and kissing it, licking long stripes from the bottom to the toes.</p><p>“Don’t forget between the toes.” Ron commanded, he had reclined on the throne, looking comfortable in this situation.</p><p>Harry didn’t forget about between the toes, he took the toes in his mouth, sucking them for almost a full minute each, before licking between them.</p><p>Harry couldn’t believe what he was doing, he may have given up control of his body, but he still felt, tasted and smelled everything his body did, and Merlin help him, he was embarrassingly turned on by what his body was doing and he was feeling. </p><p>He did the same with the other foot, licking, kissing, sucking, worshiping. By the end of it his mouth should be numb, but Harry felt like he could keep going for hours.</p><p>“That’s enough!” Ron stopped, loud and strong, it sends shivers down Harry’s spine, he never heard Ron sound so commanding, so masculine. “It’s time for the main dish.”</p><p>Ron back straighten and he undid his pants, a few agonizing moments later his pants are down around his thighs, shoved down far enough to release his manhood.</p><p>Harry gasped, had never seen another man hard before. Ron cock was just like the rest of him, it was long – At least six and half inches long. –, slim, straight as an arrow, pale with a pink blush, he was uncut, the skin covered most of the pinkish head. Harry thought it was the most amazing sight he has ever seen.</p><p>He reached for the cock and took hold of it gently, stroking it slowly, causing Ron to moan. Running his thumb across the head, Harry presses it against the slit, teasing it.</p><p>“Fuck! Stop teasing me slave and put that pretty mouth of yours to work.” Ron commanded, he was already leaking copious amount of pre-cum.</p><p>Harry looked at Ron one last time, the boy was sweating, there was no end to his blushing, eyes closed and head throw back as he moaned in pleasure. It send thrills down Harry spine knowing that he was like that because of him, that it was Harry’s ministrations that affected him do much.</p><p>He bend forwards and took the whole cock in his mouth, all in one go. Harry didn’t know it was possible to do that, but his body did without gagging. Harry didn’t care, he was being hypnotized by Ron’s taste, his pre-cum and the taste of his intimate flesh attacked his taste buds, if that was not enough his nose was nestled in Ron’s growing pubes, the strong musk clouding his senses. Harry moaned, he could never imagine that he would find the taste and smell of Ron so enticing. Even if his body was out of his control it followed him, moaning around the cock.</p><p>Harry focused on his overloaded senses as his head started bobbing up and down at the cock, tongue lashing out, while his hand massaged Ron’s fuzzy balls.</p><p>“Fuck! That’s it, so good.” Ron moaned, his hand going to Harry’s hair. “That’s the only thing your mouth is good for, sucking dick. Fuck! That’s your fucking place, on your knees in front of me.”</p><p>While Ron was lost in his world, cursing and moaning loudly, Harry was lost in his own pleasure, he didn’t thought it was possible to get pleasure out of giving head to another person.</p><p>Ron took control of the rhythm, setting a brutal pace, forcing Harry to take all he could give as he started to fuck his face. Even if Harry could he wouldn’t complain, instead he sucked harder, moaning around the cock.</p><p>He wanted to stroke his own cock, but his body wouldn’t move as he wanted.</p><p>“Fuck! Fuck! That’s it! Ahhhh!” Ron’s balls draw up as he came down Harry’s throat.</p><p>Harry gulped down the salty, hot essence, tasting it, savoring it.</p><p>He love it.</p><p>“Ah! Merlin’s balls!” Ron exclaimed. He was breathing hard, his chest going up and down quickly.</p><p>Ron rested on the chair, one arm going behind his head and he looked down at Harry, his cock still in the green eyed boy’s mouth.</p><p>“How was it?” He asked, a sly smile parting his lips.</p><p>All Harry was able to do was hum, he barely heard what Ron was saying. His body kept the cock in his mouth, while Harry was swimming in sensations he never felt before, he was really out of it. </p><p>Ron looked at Harry’s eyes and smirked maliciously, “Stay still slut. I have to take a piss.” he said. Harry snapped out of his trance and tried to force himself to move out of the way, but it was in vain as his body was still out of his control. So he stayed still as Ron ordered, at his knees, mouth open with Ron’s cock in it, waiting for the urine. “You’re going to drink it all and you’re going to be grateful for it. Right slut?” Harry nodded. “Then drink it bitch, I don’t want one drop to escape.”</p><p>Ron started letting go of his bladder control, hot stream of the liquid started flowing in Harry’s mouth. Harry never drank anything that tasted close to it. It was strong, with a musky flavor to it. For all of Harry’s initial disgust, he couldn’t say he wouldn’t drink it again if he had the change.</p><p>He gulped and gulped, drinking the piss as fast as he could, not letting a single drop out. Finally when Harry thought he wouldn’t be able to take anymore the stream slows down.</p><p>“You really drank it all down. Such a pig Harry…” Ron said, but his voice was strange, it was becoming distant.</p><p>Harry was suddenly back in the control of his body, but before he could do anything the world around him started to slowly distort, blurry images filtering Harry’s vision, before it all went black.</p><p>Harry blinked, his breath hitched. He was not in the great hall anymore but in his own bed. Was it all a dream? He mused. </p><p>He heard quiet cursing, not wanting anyone to know he was awake he opened just a small breach at his bed curtains. He saw Ron getting up from the bed and taking the sheets to the bathroom, he couldn’t see much as it was dark, but he could see that the redhead was visible shaking. He wanted to go to him and comfort him about whatever was on his mind, but he couldn’t, not now that they were fighting.</p><p>He was so lost in his thoughts that he only snapped out of it when Ron came back to the room, the boy didn’t even look at Harry’s direction, he got back to his bed and closed the curtains.</p><p>Harry fell back on his bed, he huffed thinking back on the strange dream, he never imagined his first wet dream was going to feature Ron… he couldn’t have feelings for Ron, could he?</p><p>He stretched, while his mind was clouded with confusion, his body never felt better, was like he had a new body, one without years of beatings and starvation. So alive he was feeling that no matter how much he tried he couldn’t go back to sleep. He swung his legs out of bed and left it, he went to the window, it was still dark outside.</p><p>It was a cold night like any other in Hogwarts, but he wasn’t much bothered by it.</p><p>Something flutters far away, he squints, he could swear he saw a owl, but it was so dark he could have been seeing things.</p><p>He rubs his eyes… </p><p>Harry blink once, twice. He was not using his glasses, even so his vision was perfect, even better than it ever was with the glasses.</p><p>He didn’t know if he should cry from happiness or be weird out that something magically fixed his eyes. He didn’t have time to contemplate his options when a owl, as black as the night, flew closer and perched at the windowsill.</p><p>Harry slowly, fearing it had some curse on it, took the letter from the bird feet. The owl hooted once before taking flight.</p><p>The dark haired boy was confused and lost. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. </p><p>He went to the bathroom, left the letter in the sink and paused as he saw his reflection at full body mirror near the sink, his jaw dropped. He didn’t change enough that everyone would immediately be aware of it, but he could see the difference. Because of the periods of starvation at summer he was never truly able to gain much of a muscles mass, now that changed he was still slim but his body was more toned, no signs of malnutrition. His jaw was sharper, his cheekbones were higher, his eyes even brighter than before. His cock was bigger as well, from four and half inches long to six.</p><p>“What the hell?” Harry was about to hyperventilate.</p><p>He washed his face with cold water, counted to ten and back, did anything he could trying to calm down. It was not working, he needed something to take his mind out of whatever happened to his body. That’s when his eyes fell on the letter left in the sink. He took the envelope with trembling hands and saw the crest on it.</p><p>“Gringotts…” He whispered to himself, before breaking the seal.</p>
