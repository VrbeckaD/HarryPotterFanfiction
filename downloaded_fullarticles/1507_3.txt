  <span>“Sirius, come on. You can’t actually tell me you believe in this shit?” Remus props himself up on his elbow to look directly into Sirius’s storm grey eyes, determined to catch the little glint in them that will alert Remus to the level of teasing that his boyfriend is employing. He sees none of it, just sincerity, despite the absurdity of the topic at hand. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Though really, Remus shouldn’t be surprised. The Black family has been so deeply invested in the stars that Sirius’s family tree reads like one of those overly detailed natal charts that Professor Trelawney made everyone analyze back in third year. The same type of chart that had prompted Remus to drop the wholly ridiculous subject that was Divination in the first place. Sirius however, thrived in that class. And Remus had always just assumed that it was Sirius’s natural penchant for bullshitting that allowed him to excel, not an innate ability to decipher someone’s sun and moon sign after a ten minute conversation. Whatever that means. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“We live in a literal world of magic Moony. I really don’t understand why this is such a hard concept for you to wrap your brilliant brain around.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Because it’s absolute rubbish!’</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“It’s not rubbish, there’s a lot of truth in it.” The eye roll Sirius gives Remus is so deep and exaggerated, that Remus is surprised and a little disappointed that Sirius’s eyes don’t get stuck back there.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Fine. If you believe in this so strongly, then by all means explain to me how our sun and moon signs have dictated our sex life.” Remus, tired of arguing at this point over something so trivial, lays his head back down on Sirius’s chest. Back to the position he was previously enjoying post orgasm, before Sirius decided to claim Remus’s moon sign was the reason for his secret kink. Sirius begins to idly run his fingers through Remus’s curls. He relaxes deeper into Sirius’s chest.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Let’s start with our sun signs, it all works together after all.” Sirius’s voice is deep and smooth, and maybe even a little bit smug as he begins to explain the intricacies of the stars. “You’re a Pisces and I’m a Scorpio, and though we’re both water signs, my sign being fixed and your sign being muted makes me more dominant over you. Do you agree?”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“What? That you’re more dominant over me?” Remus tries to lift his head, but Sirius uses his hand to gently place him back down. “I’m not some weak damsel that lets you walk all over him you know.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“I know that Moony, all I’m saying is that our bedroom dynamic puts me in charge. Correct?”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Fine, but nothing gets done without the bottom.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Yes Moons, and you’re a great bottom.” Sirius places a kiss into Remus’s hair and Remus’s cheeks flush slightly at the praise. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Thank you.” Remus burrows himself in a little closer to Sirius, happy to have been told how good he was. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Now, it’s our moon signs that I find particularly interesting. Moon signs are more telling as far as our innermost desires and secrets go,” Sirius carries on and resumes his stroking of Remus’s hair. “I’m a Sagittarius moon to your Leo, both fire signs. This time, your the fixed sign and I’m the muted, meaning I’m more likely to bend towards your wants, needs and desires. And as a Sagittarius moon, I’m open minded, adventurous and willing to try just about anything. And you, as a Leo moon, well you like to have your ego stroked.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Hey, I resent that! I’m not some ego maniac,” Remus grumbles.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“No you’re not.” Sirius places another kiss into Remus’s hair. His free arm reaches across their torso’s as he turns and pulls Remus even closer to him, pressing their naked bodies firmly together. “But…” Sirius pauses, a devilish grin pulling at his lips, “you really do love it when I tell you what a good boy you are while I’m buried deep inside.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Remus takes in a sharp breath and feels the stir of arousal at Sirius’s words. His sudden eagerness and attentiveness at Sirius’s simple praise, a reminder of words shared between them when they are at their most intimate, causes a conflict within Remus’s own mind. In a burst of irrational anger, like a fire doused in gasoline, uncontrolled words explode out of Remus’s mouth. “That has nothing to do with when I was born.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Keep telling yourself that love,” Sirius’s voice rumbles. He brings his hand to stroke the indisputably hard proof of Remus’s desire to be praised that has risen between them. “Now be my good boy, and roll over for me.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Remus shivers as he complies.</span>
