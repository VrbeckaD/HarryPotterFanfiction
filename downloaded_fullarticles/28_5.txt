    <p>Steam clouded the air. Footsteps rang out as feet hit hard stone. Shouts rose above the clatter. Chatter muddled together into a roar of noise. People took up every inch of space, pushing through the crowd. </p><p>The commotion of the train platform overwhelmed Albus, his senses on high alert as the world seemed to rush around him. He felt like a fish trying to swim upstream--no, not upstream, up a rapid river--the water trying to overtake him. His own beating heart only added to the noise that filled his head.</p><p> Albus tried to keep up with his family, navigating through the hoards of people the rushed around, pushing trollies piled high with trunks, broomsticks, cauldrons, and owl cages. He pushed his own trolley in front of him, swerving through small gaps and trying his best not to run over anyone. Returning students raced down the platform to greet their friends with cries of glee and enveloping hugs. Parents looked over their children with teary eyes, instructing them to be good and promising to write.</p><p>Albus' heart slammed against his chest as he gripped onto the handle of his trolley for support. He chewed at the inside of his cheek, his stomach churning, despite the little breakfast he'd eaten that morning. He could barely hear his family, who conversed with a certain cheer and exhilaration that could only be brought by the excited thoughts of the year to come. James ran ahead to meet up with his friends, leaving their mother to push his trolley. Lily clung to her father's arm, looking at the train with starry eyes, eagerly awaiting the day she would be able to board along with her older brothers.</p><p>Albus only caught pieces of his father's expressive tales from his years at Hogwarts.</p><p>"--Met your aunt Hermione and uncle Ron on this very train my first year--"</p><p>"--Had some brilliant times in the common room--"</p><p>"--Coming back to Hogwarts was always--"</p><p>"--Made the quidditch team the very first year. Ended up choking on the snitch!"</p><p>Albus had heard all of it before. Whether it was in books, The Daily Prophet, or his family's stories, he was always hearing about his father's school years and amazing feats. He wondered what his first year would bring. What friends would he make? What classes would he be good at? What adventures awaited him? He'd waited for this day since he was a little kid listening to his dad reminisce about the cosy Gryffindor common room. Albus could imagine sitting by the warm, crackling fire, curled up in a red, plush sofa, surrounded by bright red and gold tapestries, joking around with a group of friends.</p><p>When his older brother, James, started at Hogwarts just a year previous, he was overcome with jealousy, so much so that his parent's had to buy him a book filled with moving pictures of the castle and its magical origins.</p><p>But now that the long-awaited day had finally arrived, everything seemed so much more daunting.</p><p>The whole journey to King's Cross was filling with his brother's pestering.</p><p>"If you're late to class, they hang you in the rafters by your cloak!"</p><p>"James," Ginny said with a warning tone before taking her youngest son's hand and giving it a squeeze, "Don't listen to your brother, Al. He's just trying to scare you. Hogwarts is a wonderful place."</p><p>Albus pulled his hand away, not convinced.</p><p>James didn't listen to his mother, leaning over to whisper in Albus' ear, "Watch out for the Slytherins! They'll jinx you in the halls if you even look at them the wrong way. They sense fear." He snickered at Albus' sudden intake of breath.</p><p>
  <em>Slytherin.</em>
</p><p>He'd heard the cautionary tales and rumours. <em>The Dark Lord's house</em>. An aura of darkness and fear surrounded it. But James insisted on teasing Albus about it, claiming that he could be sorted into Slytherin. Albus tried not to think about the possibility. A Potter in Slytherin? That couldn't be possible.</p><p>Could it?</p><p>Albus' daze was broken as he stopped abruptly, nearly crashing his trolley into his family, who had come to a halt. It took only a second to realise why they had stopped.</p><p>"Hi, Al!" A chipper voice greeted him.</p><p>He turned to see his curly-haired cousin, Rose, who practically glowed in exhilaration--the opposite of how Albus felt. She rocked back and forth on the balls of her feet, her hands clasped together, and a smile overtaking her face. </p><p>"Aren't you thrilled? I can't believe it's finally here! I've reread <em>Hogwarts: A History</em> at least twelve times this week, just to prepare." Rose rambled, not sensing that Albus didn't mirror her excitement.</p><p>Albus looked passed his cousin to see his aunt and uncle, who greeted him and his parents.</p><p>"Are you ready, Al? Big year ahead of you!" His uncle Ron grinned.</p><p>Albus managed to muster a smile, "Yeah." He swallowed the lump in his throat as he tried to hold back the quiver in his lips, as not to show his family how he truly felt. Ron seemed satisfied by that answer and turned back to talk to Harry. Hugo broke away from his mum's side to chat excitedly with Lily about their future Hogwarts houses.</p><p>"I'm positive we will be in Gryffindor, of course," Hugo boasted with confidence. He placed his hands on his hips and jutted his chin in the air--the stance of a true Gryffindor.</p><p>"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you," Ron said to the young ones, "but no pressure."</p><p>"Ron!" Hermione exclaimed, giving him a light slap to the arm.</p><p>Rose and Albus exchanged an uneasy glance.</p><p>"He doesn't mean it," Hermione reassured them, placing a hand on each of their shoulders.</p><p>Rose brushed it off, used to her dad's sense of humour, "Doesn't matter. I know we will be in Gryffindor. Right, Al?" She elbowed him in the ribs a little harder than she meant to.</p><p>"Mhmm," He nodded but his thoughts drifting back to what James' had said.</p><p>The train whistle broke through the family's conversation.</p><p>His father glanced down at his watch, "It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board."</p><p>Rose skipped away to say goodbye to her parents. Hugo jumped into her arms before she could even get to her mum and dad, engulfing her in a hug. </p><p>James rushed back over give his farewell. He gave everyone a hug goodbye but stopped in front of Albus.</p><p>"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals." He said with an impish grin, giving his little brother a small kick to the shin.</p><p>Albus' heart dropped into his stomach, "I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!" </p><p>James laughed before dashing off to join his friends, who waved him onto the carriage.</p><p>Harry turned to Albus, giving him a soft clap on the shoulder and a gentle smile, "Thestrals are nothing to worry about," he told Albus. "They're gentle things, there's nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages, you'll be going in the boats."</p><p>Albus swallowed the lump in his throat with a small nod.</p><p>His mother came over to pull him into a tight embrace and gave him a peck on the cheek, "We're gonna miss you, Al. But you're going to have a great year. I love you. Be good, and watch over your brother. Make sure he doesn't cause too much trouble." She chuckled, knowing that wouldn't be an easy task. "We will see you at Christmas. Don't hesitate to send an owl if you need anything." She let him go, allowing her husband to wish him off.</p><p>"I'm sure he'll be much too preoccupied at school to send an owl," Harry chuckled to his wife before turning to his middle child, "Have a great first year, Al. It will certainly be one to remember. Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you've learned how. And don't let James wind you up."</p><p>Albus took a step back, his fears still clouding his head.</p><p>"What if I'm in Slytherin?" He muttered for only his father to hear.</p><p>His father took a deep, pondering breath then kneeled down before his son, looking him right in the eyes.</p><p>"Albus Severus," Harry said quietly, "you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew."</p><p>"But just say--" Albus started.</p><p>"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it?" His dad cut him off. "It doesn't matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."</p><p>"Really?" Albus lifted his head slightly.</p><p>"It did for me," Harry assured him.</p><p>The train whistle blew again, calling for the final students lingering on the platform to board. Harry stood, pulling his youngest son into one last hug before giving him a gentle push towards the train, where Rose waited for him. Albus glanced back at his family one last time, before joining her.</p><p>Large clouds of steam began to gather as the train prepared to leave. Albus bit at his lip as he watched his family wave them off. Rose waved back enthusiastically, but Albus turned away, not wanting them to notice the tears gathering in his eyes.</p><p>The train jolted. The metal wheels screeched as they started to turn, moving the train slow at first, then picking up speed.</p><p>Rose stood at the door, waving and yelling goodbyes until the platform was out of view. Then she turned to Albus, her hands on her hips and a bright smiled painted across her face.</p><p>"Well Al, this is it!" She stated, full of pride. "Now, let's find a place to sit."</p><p>---</p><p>The journey felt endless as he watched the countryside fly past the window. Albus was glad that they had found a compartment to themselves at the back of the train, where he could spread out and not have to worry about sitting with strangers for the next five hours.</p><p>Rose had occupied the first hour by chatting her cousin's ear off about Hogwarts and all her expectations of the school.</p><p>"Do you think we will get to go in the Forbidden Forest at all? Like I know it's <em>forbidden</em>, but mum and dad have been there loads of times and it sounds <em>incredible!</em>"</p><p>After a series of one-word answers, Rose gave up on trying to hold a conversation, delving into her collection of books that she brought.</p><p>As the train slowed to a halt, reaching its destination, time seemed to speed up. His legs seemed to move by themselves and Albus soon found himself on another train platform, crowded with students. Soon he was loaded into a boat with Rose behind him, marvelling at the stunning display of the castle before them.</p><p>The windows shone against the night sky like flickering stars that climbed the impressive towers that stood proudly on the rocky hill above the lake. For once Rose was speechless, marvelling up at the magnificent castle.</p><p>An explosion of warmth spread across Abus' chest and he suddenly felt at ease as they drifted on the smooth, silent water. Maybe going to Hogwarts wouldn't be as scary as he thought.</p><p>But all too soon, the view sank behind the stone ceiling of a vine-covered cave.</p><p>Albus was lifted from the boat and pushed into the centre of the crowd of jittery first years. They were ushered through the large wooden doors and guided down the magnificent Entrance Hall. Candlelight flickered against the stone wall, casting the hall in a warm orange glow. A professor gave a speech about the sorting ceremony--something that had already been explained to him by both his parents and older brother--then led them to The Great Hall.</p><p>Albus had seen plenty of pictures of The Great Hall, but he didn't realise how <em>great</em> it would actually be.</p><p>Hundreds of students watched as the first years paraded into the Great Hall, each seated at their assigned table, each neatly set with golden goblets and cutlery. Normally this amount of attention would have made Albus anxious, but he was too distracted by the bewitched ceiling to notice. He found his eyes tracing the constellations that mirrored the sky outside as if Great Hall reached all the way up to the heavens.</p><p>"Can you believe it? It's amazing. Even better than I imagined!" Rose whispered to him in awe, gazing around with a twinkle in her eyes that matched the sky above. She gripped onto his wrist with excitement, and for the first time all day, he gave her a genuine smile. He started to let his guard down, caving into the comforting atmosphere of the castle.</p><p>'<em>Maybe this won't be so bad after all,</em>' he thought. </p><p>He looked over at the Gryffindor table, scanning over the students until he caught the eye of his brother. James waved, turning to his friends and pointing his little brother out to them. They, too, waved and gave him friendly smiles. Albus waved back, keeping a mental note of where they were sitting so he could join them after the sorting. He hoped James wouldn't mind his little brother tagging along.</p><p>'<em>Just until I make friends of my own,</em>' Albus assured himself.</p><p>The sound of someone's throat being cleared caused the noise to dim to silence. Albus turned to see Neville--<em>Professor Longbottom</em>--standing at the front of the hall, a scroll in hand. As expected, a raggedy old hat rested on a stool beside him. The crowd waited in expectation as the hat began to stir. The tear in the fabric began to move and its song began.</p><p>
  <em>"I am the greatest hat you shall see,</em><br/>
For I am the Sorting Hat,<br/>
No greater hat there be."
</p><p>Albus heard a soft gasp from behind him, presumably from a muggle-born. But even with all the magic he had seen in his life, Albus, too, found the singing hat rather surprising and amusing. The rest of the Hogwarts students watched in silence as the raggedy hat continued.</p><p>
  <em>"Although my looks are not divine,</em><br/>
As you can see I am patched and torn,<br/>
It would be hard to get a hat this fine,<br/>
For I am the Sorting Hat.
</p><p>
  <em>Place me upon your head,</em><br/>
And I will look deep inside,<br/>
And your house is what will be said."
</p><p>Albus' stomach began to tumble around inside of him, like a single marble in an empty jar. He wasn't sure how he felt about a magic hat looking through his mind. He glanced around at the other first years. They all looked equally unsettled at the thought, which reassured him.</p><p>
  <em>"Maybe Gryffindor,<br/>
The brave and the daring,"</em>
</p><p>Rose elbowed Albus softly, shooting him a wink. He glanced back at the Gryffindor table, who sat proud under their banner of red and gold. Their parent's house held a special place in their hearts--and in the history books. All the Weasleys and Potters before them had been sorted into Gryffindor. James gave him a thumbs up from across the hall, which made Albus smile before he turned back to face the front.</p><p>
  <em>"Hufflepuff where you'll find</em><br/>
The kindest and the caring.<br/>
Maybe Ravenclaw,<br/>
The creative and the smart,<br/>
Or Slytherin,<br/>
If you've got a cunning heart.
</p><p>
  <em>Where you will be,</em><br/>
Well, no one quite knows,<br/>
No one else but me.
</p><p>
  <em>So try me on,</em><br/>
For I am the best,<br/>
Still, no greater hat than I,<br/>
For I'm the Sorting Hat!"
</p><p>There was a brief moment of silence when the hat finished its song before the students erupted into applause.</p><p>Neville stepped forward again to address the crowd, unrolling the long parchment scroll in his hands, "Settled down everyone and the Sorting Ceremony will begin." A few cheers lingered before all attention was refocused on the ratty old hat. "When I call your name, please come forward to be sorted'" Neville instructed before looking down at the scroll to read the first name, "Andrews, George."</p><p>A short and stout boy at the front of the crowd walked up to the stool tentatively and the hat was gently placed on his head. With just a moment's thought, the hat shouted out its decision.</p><p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p><p>George jumped up and ran to take his seats with his new peers, that congratulated him as he passed by.</p><p>Albus began to wonder what it would be like when it was his turn to be sorted. The Potter name carried weight with it, and would surely attract attention. He remembered James telling him about how excited the Gryffindor table got when he was sorted.</p><p>"Of course, no one was surprised," He had said, "Where else would the son of Harry Potter be sorted?"</p><p>"Granger-Weasley, Rose," Neville called, bringing Albus' thoughts back to the present.</p><p>His cousin stepped confidently up to the front, addressing the crowd with a confident grin as the hat was placed on her head and immediately made its choice.</p><p>"GRYFFINDOR!"</p><p>Rose skipped cheerfully over to her assigned table. James slid over to make room for her next to him. She left a spot next to her open, shooting Albus a thumbs up.</p><p>Albus barely paid attention as more names were called and the group of first years widdled down around him. Instead, he examined each of the long wooden tables that stretched out along the Great Hall.</p><p>At first glance, they each looked the same. But it was the significance of the house that differentiated them. Above each table, a banner flew, boasting the house colours. Everyone had their own house, their own family. Houses were meant to be a symbol of pride, where they would not only live but work, play, and make memories. It was where the legendary trio became friends, and where they spent their days when they weren't galavanting off on their adventures. Albus hoped he could make a group of friends that strong, just like his father had.</p><p>"O' Hare, Leanne," The list was starting to narrow down now.</p><p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p><p>"Pachelli, Antonio!"</p><p>"HUFFLEPUFF!"</p><p>"Potter, Albus!"</p><p>Albus' heart started to thunder against his chest. He stepped forward, feeling like a spotlight had suddenly fallen on him, every eye burning into him.</p><p>"That's Harry Potter's son!" He heard someone whisper in awe.</p><p>"I can't believe he is in <em>our</em> year!"</p><p>Albus tried to block out the all the looks and whispers he got as he made his way up to the stool in the front of the hall. Ahead of him, he saw Hagrid, who towered over the rest of the teachers at the head table. Noticing the little boy's nerves, Hagrid gave him a wide smile. Neville also snuck him a subtle nod of encouragement that only he could see.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Albus planted himself down on the wobbly old stool. He felt the hat brush over his hair as it was gently placed upon his head. Albus held his breath, staring down at his shoes to avoid looking out at the crowd of faces that all pointed towards him.</p><p>A small, gruff voice in his ear made him jump, <em>'Well, well, well, another Potter,'</em> The Sorting Hat spoke to him. <em>'Hmm, not like your brother, no... No, you've got a mind just like your father's, you do.'</em></p><p>Albus was taken aback, <em>'I do?' </em>He thought. All his life he had been told how much he looked like his father, inheriting the same black hair and green eyes, but never in any other respects.</p><p><em>'Yes...'</em> The hat drawled with an eerie sense of confidence,<em> 'I know a great place for you,' </em>the Sorting Hat continued, <em>'you'll fit in well with them. You'll make strong friendships. If you're willing, you can really thrive. It would be the perfect fit.'</em></p><p>The offer tempted Albus. He looked up at the Gryffindor table, where Rose and James watched him in anticipation.</p><p>Albus made up his mind, <em>'Yes,'</em>  he told the hat, <em>'That's where I want to be.'</em></p><p><em>'Good...'</em> The hat spoke to Albus one more time before it shouted out to the waiting hall of students.</p><p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p><p>There was a moment's silence as the name echoed through the hall. Shock fell over the students and even the teachers. No one moved or clapped.</p><p>Harry Potter's son a <em>Slytherin?</em> It was all wrong.</p><p>Albus' heart dropped into his stomach. The Great Hall began to sway before him as if he was still on the boat crossing the lake.</p><p><em>'No!'</em> He thought, frantically, <em>'That can't be right!'</em></p><p>The Sorting Hat was silent. Its decision was final.</p><p>As the hat was slowly lifted from his head, the initial shock wore off of the students and the whispers began.</p><p>Slowly, as if he had treacle on the soles of his shoes, Albus stepped down and trudged over to his respective table. The green and silver banner flew overhead, the serpent's beady eyes staring down the newcomer, unwelcoming and unapologetic.</p><p>"Is that really Harry Potter's son?" He heard someone whisper.</p><p>"Slytherin? Bloody hell!"</p><p>No one welcomed him as he took a place on the bench. Their stares burned holes in his skin and their whispering tones slashed through his skin like claws.</p><p>He stared down at the plate in front of him, wishing he could just melt away into nothingness, like the candles that decorated the hall. He couldn't bear to turn and see Rose and James' reactions. He knew he had let his family down. A Potter in Slytherin? He was a disgrace. A disappointment. What would his parents think?</p><p><em>Oh Merlin, his parents. </em>How would he tell them? The question lingered in his head throughout the rest of the evening.</p><p>He hardly touched the feast; the thought of food disgusted him. He didn't pay attention to Headmistress McGonagall's speech, or even the Hogwarts song, which used to make him laugh whenever his parents sang it to him as a child.</p><p>The castle didn't seem so comfortable anymore.</p><p>As the Great Hall emptied out after the banquet, Albus followed the rest of the Slytherins to the common room, staying at the back of the group with his head hung.</p><p>"Albus!" He heard someone call. He glanced over his shoulder to see a concerned Rose, jogging to catch up with him</p><p>Albus turned his head, "Just, leave me alone." He picked up his pace, keeping up with the rest of his house, leaving Rose looking dejected.</p><p>The castle air felt colder and damper as the descended into the dungeons, the candles casting flickering shadows against the cold stone.</p><p>Albus didn't even bother to look around the common room like the rest of the first years. Instead, he went straight to the dormitory, where his trunk and belongings were already waiting by a four-poster bed. </p><p>He sat on the bed curled up, resting his chin on his knees. He tried to digest the day, but he couldn't come to accept his fate.</p><p>Slytherin.</p><p>
  <em>Slytherin.</em>
</p><p>Albus Severus Potter was a Slytherin.</p><p>His father's words lingered in his head, but they brought him little comfort. He was just trying to console him at the station, he didn't truly mean it. How could he? How could Harry Potter accept his son in the house of Voldemort? Thoughts and questions swarmed his mind. How would his parents react? And his aunt and uncle? His grandparents? They would be so disappointed. A whole Gryffindor legacy ruined by him. Why him? What did he do to deserve this? What did he--</p><p>"Jelly slug?"</p><p>Albus' train of thought was interrupted by a hand holding out a green gummy in front of him. He peered up to see a boy standing over him, clutching a bag of sweets in his arms. He smiled softly, encouraging him to take the slug.</p><p>Albus hesitated at first, but the rumble of his empty stomach got the better of him--plus jelly slugs were one of his favourite sweets and he couldn't resist. He accepted the sweet, chewing on it halfheartedly.</p><p>"Thanks," He muttered to the boy, who looked happy that Albus had accepted his offer.</p><p>"I've got loads more. My parents gave me a whole case full of sweets. They said it would help me make friends." The boy smiled, teeth as just barely whiter than his pale skin. His hair also a similar colour: pale blond.</p><p>He offered Albus another slug, which he took without complaint, "My mum was worried about me leaving for Hogwarts. She worried that I would get homesick, but really, I think she'll miss me more. I'm an only child. She isn't used to not having me around to care for," The boy told him, "What about you? Do you miss your parents yet?" He asked, knowing fully that something was bringing Albus down.</p><p>Albus shook his head, "Sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm really not in the mood for talking right now." He told him truthfully, expecting the boy to be insulted or upset.</p><p>But the boy just shrugged, "Okay. Well, when you're in the mood to talk, I will be here. I'm Scorpius, by the way." He told him, giving him another jelly slug.</p><p>Albus took the sweet, letting a grateful smile slip, "Albus. My name's Albus."</p>
