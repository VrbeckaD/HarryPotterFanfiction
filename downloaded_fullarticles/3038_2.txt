    <p>A twenty five year old Harry Potter was asleep on his bed in his cabin. It had been eight years since Voldemort's downfall by his hand. He still had nightmares. He lost many of his friends and family in the final battle.</p><p>Ron had thrown himself in front of a killing curse cast by Bellatrix Lestrange in order to save Hermione. Remus had done the same to save Harry. Fred had died in midst of battle. He wasn't quite sure who had killed the red head.</p><p>That wasn't the worst of it. Right when he was beginning to get his life back on track he was drawn into a kings war. A war that had only ended a few days ago. While they had succeeded in destroying the Slates it was too late to save many. Including the man that Harry was bonded to. Reisi Munkata's sword had begun fall just seconds before the Slates destruction. Zengo killed him to prevent anymore civilian casualties.</p><p>Harry was down in the basement with Weissman when he felt the bond shatter. He didn't remember anything that happened after that. The next thing he remembered was waking up in a hospital room. He couldn't bring himself to go to his Captain's funeral. Instead he hid himself in his cabin hoping that he would just die.</p><p>Once again fates had other other plans for him. When he woke he heard a familiar train whistle. He blearily looked out of a window he was laying against. It took him all of five seconds to realize he was in King's Cross and on the Hogwarts express. How in the fuck did he get here? He needed to get off this blasted train.</p><p>Standing up he was stopped by a voice saying," You don't want to do that little wolf."</p><p>His hand automatically went for the sword that typically hung off his hip. It wasn't there. A man sat across from him. He was wearing typical muggle suit. The eyes were golden very similar to that of a werewolf.</p><p>He asked his hand finding his wand," Who are you? Why I am i here? How did I get here?"</p><p>The man pushed his wand out of his face," I am the Apollo the God of Music, Poetry, Truth, the Sun, Healing, and the God of Prophecy, of course. I already know you, Harry Potter. You are in an alternate dimension that we the Gods felt you would be happiest."</p><p>Come again? He said narrowing his eyes," Again. Why? I was doing just fine on my own in my dimension..."</p><p>That's when he felt it. A slight brush on his mind. One he was all too familiar with. It shouldn't be possible! He felt Reisi die!</p><p>He glared at Apollo who smiled and said," In this world you are currently 13. You do not have a silver bullet dangerously close to your heart. Your king is still alive. Voldemort rules this world but he is not the same man you once knew. Death Eaters are a political party that you can join once your of age."</p><p>Harrison only heard the first half of what had been said. Reisi was still alive. He tested his shoulder to find that he once again had full range of motion. He hadn't had full range over his right shoulder since he was thirteen. It felt odd to have it so suddenly.</p><p>He asked worriedly," What about my aura control? I worked hard to not need suppressors."</p><p>Apollo just rolled his eyes and said," No you will have the control you once had."</p><p>Accepting this he asked tiredly," Why?"</p><p>Hecate wanted to give her favorite magical child another chance," Apollo said. "I, for one, didn't like how your life turned out to be. A child is supposed to be cherished, loved, protected — not raised like a bloody pig for slaughter." Apollo's eyes flashed, the compartment trembled, and Harry stared.</p><p>"Anyway, you're going to be a third year at Hogwarts. However, there are many differences in this world than the one I brought you from." Apollo reclined back in the seat. "For one,there is no Boy-Who-Lived or Prophecy proclaiming the end of the Dark Lord. However, Dumbledore and his Order are known as…renegades."</p><p>As long as he didn't have to deal with the man he didn't care what Dumbledore was up to. That man had been the cause of so much of his pain. If he never saw the man again it would be too soon.</p><p>Apollo said after letting it sink in for a moment," In your trunk you will find all the information you will need. Do try to keep an open mind on who you will meet? Some people will be similar in personalities while others will be completely different. Judge them for how they are here not for how you knew them."</p><p>Harry could tell the man was getting ready to leave. He asked," What about my friends? Will they come here too?"</p><p>Apollo smiled knowingly as he said," I cannot tell you that. Just remember what i said little wolf. And try to live a little. Heal from what has happened to you."</p><p>Heal... yeah that would take time. Lots of time. He wondered if he would be able to live in peace for once at Hogwarts. Pushing up the sleeve to his robes he caught sight of the scent seeker mark. With that still on his arm most likely not.</p><p>What caught his eye was the unmarked wrist. He wasn't a clansman to Reisi? He looked to Apollo for answers.</p><p>The God said," You haven't met Reisi yet. The bond between you is weak because it's from the other world. Yes I know it shattered upon his death."</p><p>He rubbed at his eyes to prevent the tears from falling that had formed. It was much too soon for him to be ready to talk about that.</p><p>Apollo said looking up," It's time for me to leave. Don't worry little wolf you will be happy here."</p><p>With that the god was gone leaving him alone. With a sigh he pulled his trunk down to get the information he needed. It was a fairly thick folder. The first thing he came across was his parentary. His mother was Lilian Rodux. She had been killed in a raid. His father though all it said was unknown. His name was Harrison Rodux.</p><p>As he read through it he realized thay he was an exceptional student. He made mostly E and O. He was also fourth in his class at the Nightingale Academy. A member of the house of Lupus which correlated to the Hufflepuff's in Hogwarts.</p><p>Wincing he read through the report on what happened. The school had beem attacked by renegades. Many had been killed in the attack. He had assisted in the counter charge with Percy Weasley and Hermione Perwitt. Percy had been badly injured but was expected to make it. Nothing was known on Hermione's condition.</p><p>The next thing he found was a list of classes he could take. He could take a maximum of four elective or a minimum of two. Going through the list he noticed there was more than he expected. In particular Swordsmanship, healing, and blade smithing caught his eye.</p><p>After reading through the list twice he signed up for swordsmanship, healing, blade smithing, ancient runes. On the list was also fencing but he had little paitence for that art. Fencing could get one killed in a real battle.</p><p>He had just put it away when the door to his compartment opened. On instinct his hand went to his side forgetting his sword was not there. He cursed himself for his jumpyness. It took several seconds for him to recognize who stood in front of him.</p><p>Draco Malfoy, Theodore Knott, and Blaise Zabini. He wished now more than ever he had his sword. Draco said looking him up and down," Look its a first year. Hello there."</p><p>The blond held out his hand for Harry to shake. Not wanting to start off on a bad foot he shook it. He said," Hi, Harrison Rodux and I'm not a first year. I'm a transfer student. Going into my third year."</p><p>Draco said his eyes widening," My condolences. Everyone has heard what happened at your school. I hope that Hogwarts will become your home."</p><p>He had to keep telling himself this was not the Draco from his world. He said smiling slightly," Thank you. I hope it will too."</p><p>:Must not attack them. Must not attack them.: he chanted in his head. The king's war had pushed him to the brink of his sanity. This was making things much worse.</p><p>Theodore Knott said as they took seats across from him," I'm Theodore Knott. Just call me Theo."</p><p>Blaise said calmly," I'm Blaise Zabini."</p><p>He nodded to them each in return. Leaning back he looked up at the ceiling. Unwillingly his thoughts turned to just before the king's war. When Mikoto had given his life to kill the one who murdered one of their own.</p><p>Flashback</p><p>In his wolf form he climbed up the steps to where the kings were fighting. He had to save Shiro. The boy was innocent. He had to tell Mikoto the truth. He was too late for as he reached the top of the stairs Mikoto's hand went through the boy's chest. Red aura rushed past them blocking the two from view.</p><p>When it cleared there was a giant crater with Mikoto in the middle. He was alone with no sign of Shiro. Looking up he saw the light go out in the other's Sword of Damocles. He knew what was going to happen and there was nothing he could do to stop it.</p><p>Mikoto had said something to Reisi but he couldn't hear what was being said. The red haired man held out his arms like to welcome a hug. That's when the sword began to fall. Reisi rushed forward plunging his sword deep into the man's chest.</p><p>Tears filled his eyes as he watched the light go out behind the man's eyes. Mikoto collapsed onto Reisi shuddering as he took his final breath. Then the red king died leaving behind broken hearted clansman.</p><p>End of flashback</p><p>He was being shaken awake. Where was he? Instantly his wand was out jabbed imto the person shaking him's throat. When his eyes focused he saw a very tense 13 year old Draco Malfoy.</p><p>Slowly he lowered his wand until he was sure no one would curse him before putting it away. Draco asked concerned," Are you okay?"</p><p>All Harry could do was shake his head. He was far from alright. He was in an unfamiliar world. Hadn't he done enough to die peacefully? Stupid interfering gods.</p><p>Draco said with an understanding look," You don't have to talk about it. Things must be tough for you."</p><p>All he did was nod and keep his silence. Eventually they realized he wasn't going to talk to them and began chatting amongst themselves. He was once again left to his thoughts.</p><p>For him the silence wasn't broken until they were five minutes from Hogsmede. Draco said startling him from his thoughts," You need to get changed. We are almost there."</p><p>He changed into plain black robes and sure enough they were soon there. He followed Draco and the others to where the carriages were. As the carriages made their way to the castle Harry let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. The school looked like it had in his first six years. No longer was it damaged by the war. Maybe things would really work out.</p>
