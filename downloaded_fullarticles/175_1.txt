    <p>The Dark Lord needed to trust her. Dumbledore had said as much, “You must gain access to his inner circle, but that won’t be enough. He must trust you <em>above all others.</em> He must be completely sure of your loyalty and devotion to him. This is <em><strong>vital.</strong></em>”</p>
<p>
  <em>Oh Lily, the things I do for you.</em>
</p>
<p>Severina wanted to hate Dumbledore, but she couldn’t help but be grateful he stopped her after she heard the prophecy and explained the potential danger for Lily and her unborn child. Severina had gone to apply for the position of Potions Mistress; Slughorn intended to retire and she had been nothing but a lowly laky in the Dark Lord’s service. She needed something to help her rise in the ranks. She thought spying on Dumbledore might be enough. When she’d heard Sybill Trelawney's prophecy, she would have run straight to the Death Eaters right then. Had Dumbledore not stopped her, she might as well have killed Lily herself.</p>
<p>Despite her fallout with Lily, Severina wasn’t willing to sacrifice the closest person she'd ever had to a true friend. Lily was her sister in all but blood; no matter what- always. Nevertheless, the whole situation put Severina in a rather awkward position. Dumbledore wanted her to be his spy; wanted her to go through with rising in the Dark Lord’s ranks. Severina had nothing to offer the Dark Lord in exchange for the Dark Mark. Dumbledore seemed to be under some misunderstanding that the Dark Lord would take any scum that came crawling.</p>
<p>
  <em>The fool. </em>
</p>
<p>He didn’t understand, it wasn’t that simple. The promise of a spy within the halls of Hogwarts was only enough for an invitation to the Marking Ceremony but she needed to offer something in addition for the Mark itself. The Dark Lord would not settle for less than absolute devotion to himself and to his cause. A potential Death Eater needed something worth a great deal- a gift, an offering, a sacrifice. It was how he determined the worth and devotion of his followers. The more Severina gave the more value he’d see in her.</p>
<p>Death Eaters didn’t fully understand the Dark Lord’s machinations. They joined him, lusting for power, craving freedom in the dark arts, or simply wanting to survive- a join or die mentality. Did they not see or did they ignore, the cost of power, freedom and survival was to sacrifice those very things they wished to gain? It was an empty sort of servitude- mindless, soulless, self-destructive. Severina thought, they must see, they must know but they just didn’t care.</p>
<p>
  <em>Maybe, he tricked us or maybe we’ve tricked ourselves. </em>
</p>
<p>Why did <em>she</em> want this- power, freedom, survival? What power did she have? What freedom? What life? She had nothing to lose, nothing to give, nothing to risk. She meant take her chance; take what she could get. What did it matter in the end? She had been hopeless and reckless and she hadn’t cared.</p>
<p>Until now. Until it was too late to turn back. Until there was something to live for; something to die for. <em>Lily.</em></p>
<p>Severina needed to present the Dark Lord with something worthy of the Mark, but she had nothing. She was a penniless half-blood and ugly to boot. She had her skills and her knowledge and she almost laughed aloud at the thought. She promised those to another. She was Dumbledore’s Potions Mistress at Hogwarts and his eyes in the Dark- a spy for the Light. She felt trapped.</p>
<p>If the Dark Lord found her worthless, she could die tonight. Again, she was plagued with the realization that had nothing to offer. The best she could do was lie. Convince the Dark Lord that she was <em>his</em> servant and not his enemy’s.</p>
<p>She did have one thing but it wouldn’t be enough. Her hand gripped the potion vials in her small velvet pouch- charmed to keep the vials from breaking when stored together. Among the empty vials, only one contained a potion. Severina had tried to brew something that would show her creativity and her innovations in potions. The results of her efforts- a concentrated variation of Felix Felicis, a drop could last an entire day, the bottle, a month. The ingredients had cost her every knut she had.</p>
<p>Severina Snape reached Gaunt Manor with a portkey- a special invitation to meet the Dark Lord himself. When she arrived, she was lead into a large hall, full of Death Eaters- elitist purebloods. How did she ever think she could fit-in here? The room was dark, lit by floating candles burning black flames. Pillars lined the sides of the room, draped in silver and green silken banners that waved like flames, slithering in the absent breeze. Severina felt it gave the illusion of having been thrown into a snake-pit. It was oddly comforting.</p>
<p>“Nervous?” Regulus spoke into her ear. Thankful she'd been occluding, otherwise, she may have jumped at his proximity. He smirked at her. She hated that look on his face; he looked just his brother when he smirked like that.</p>
<p>“Of course I am. I’m not a fool.” She answered, feigning bored.</p>
<p>“You’re smart Sev, no doubt about that, but that doesn’t make you any less of a fool. You should’ve run.”</p>
<p>
  <em> Run where? Even now she wondered what other options she had, other paths she could’ve taken to avoid standing here tonight. She kept coming up with nothing. Besides, it was far too late for that now. </em>
</p>
<p>“Careful, Black, you almost sound like you care.”</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy graced the pair with his presence, “Good evening, Regulus, Severina.”</p>
<p>Lucius looked at them with hollow eyes. She glanced at the sleeve of his left forearm. He had waited to receive the Mark until after his honeymoon with Narcissa née Black. Which, in Malfoy style, meant a honeymoon that lasted nearly four months. Lucius had taken his Mark the night before, along with several other wizards from her year. Severina wondered how Abraxas Malfoy was able to delay Lucius’s Marking ceremony for so long and why.</p>
<p><em> Does it hurt? </em> She wanted to ask him. <em> Did it feel like death? Does he leave any of yourself behind, or is he a demon that possesses you? A dementor that eats your soul and leaves not but his Mark?</em></p>
<p>“I doubt anyone has warned you. The others know; their families would have told them.” His jaw clenched. “The Dark Lord will visit each of you tonight.”</p>
<p>Severina waited for more explanation but he looked reluctant to continue. She looked to Regulus; he’d gone tense.</p>
<p>“There’s more that you are not telling me, Lucius, please.” Oh Merlin, she had taken to begging already. This night was not going well. She needed control over her emotions.</p>
<p>“He… He likes to assert his dominance.” Lucius answered.</p>
<p>“Luc, you’re being cryptic. Usually, I’m all for cryptic but for Circe’s sake not tonight.” She said.</p>
<p>He bent his head down, his lips almost touched her ear as he hissed between his teeth, “He’s going to fuck you all tonight.”</p>
<p>Severina’s stomach gave a painful twist. Her natural complexion was already pasty and pale, but her lips no longer held pigment.</p>
<p>
  <em>All of us? </em>
</p>
<p>“Who is to be marked tonight?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Last night was just wizards, tonight will be for the witches; four of you: Bellatrix Lestrange, Alecto Carrow, you and Narcissa.”</p>
<p>His chin quivered fleetingly but his eyes remained blank.</p>
<p>
  <em> Oh god, Cissy. </em>
</p>
<p>She almost didn't want to know, but she had to ask, “Last night, were you visited?”</p>
<p>“No, our wives suffice. That’s why Bellatrix’s Marking was delayed. Rudolphus made her wait until they were married.”</p>
<p>Narcissa Malfoy stood with her sister not far from them but she didn’t look over at Lucius once; not once.</p>
<p>“But if not married?”</p>
<p>Lucius nodded. “Well, unless they’re too ugly.” He shrugged.</p>
<p>Severina looked at Regulus.</p>
<p>Regulus didn’t meet her eyes, “My mother is delaying my Marking until she finds a suitable wife for me.”</p>
<p>Severina tasted bile in the back of her throat. So, that was how the pureblood families protected their sons, by offering their daughters.</p>
<p>Lucius put in, “I doubt it’ll come to that though,” thinking that would be an encouraging thing to say to the younger wizard. Regulus only looked at the ground in front of him.</p>
<p>Severina turned her attention, again, to her own predicament, “If ugly is a deterrent, perhaps Alecto and I will have a quite enough night.”</p>
<p>Lucius looked at her with an expression she could not read, but he seemed to be studying her.</p>
<p>“Oh, Merlin, Sev, you’re not a virgin are you?”</p>
<p>She just stared at him. Regulus shifted uncomfortably beside her.</p>
<p>“I thought…” Regulus started.</p>
<p>If she wasn’t so nervous she might have been tempted to laugh.</p>
<p>“Oh, do tell. Who did you have in mind?” She asked, in a self-deprecating huff.</p>
<p>Regulus swallowed and she hoped that wasn’t pity behind Lucius’s grey-eyes. Regulus looked like he might say more but his lips thinned as Lady Walburga Black approached, followed by Bellatrix, Alecto and Narcissa. Lady Black walked with her nose inclined, shot a disapproving look at her son and looked down at Severina, “It is time. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Severina fell in step behind the other witches. Narcissa showed none of her feeling but the sharp contrast between her sister’s excited eyes and unconfined smile was enough. Severina thought, if she were more like Lily, she may have reached out to Cissy just then. If Lily were here, she’d know what to do. She’d be able to offer comfort with just a touch of her hand on Cissy’s elbow or with a look and a gentle smile, but Severina was not Lily. Lily wasn’t here. <em>Thank Merlin for small mercies.</em></p>
<p>Walburga Black lead the younger witches into a changing room. There was four wardrobes separated by dividers and a house-elf standing in each area holding a black cloak. Lady Black directed each of them to an elf.</p>
<p>“Undress. You’ll appear before the Dark Lord, adorned in only that, which he provides.” Lady Black ordered.</p>
<p>The house-elves helped them undress until they were completely bare and clothed in the cloaks. The cloak was made of the softest silk Severina had ever touched but it was as strong as wool. Throughout the fabric, stitched in fine detail- green and silver threads that shimmered like snake scales.</p>
<p><em> Acromantula silk. </em> Her inner-voice gasped.</p>
<p>Lady Black gestured them out of the room. Bellatrix lead the way, being the eldest in the group, followed by Narcissa, then Alecto and lastly Severina.</p>
<p>The four witches carried gifts, held at the level of their hearts, as they walked; Severina’s velvet pouch cupped in her palms. They kept their heads down, their hoods covered their faces. They were far enough apart not to step on each others cloaks but close enough that together, the shimmering threads gave the illusion of a green and silver serpent rising up and diving down in segments, swimming through the floor.</p>
<p>Severina did not look up when they stopped; she stayed as still as the atmosphere that surrounded them. Not a whisper could be heard, a shuffling of feet, nor a cough. Not a sound was made until <em> his </em> voice cut the silence like a knife through the skin. His voice was strong, it carried to every corner of the room without aid. He had power even in his voice.</p>
<p>Bellatrix presented the Dark Lord with ancient family tomes that were worth more than Severina cared to calculate. It did not help her situation to compare her measly potion with such a gift. Severina wondered at the awe and devotion so evident in Bellatrix’s voice. She sounded like a woman standing at the alter with the man she loved most in all the world. Severina thought of Rodolphus, Bellatrix’s new husband, and wondered what his thoughts might be at this moment. Was it an act? Were they all to play the part of adoring bride, tonight? Is that what the Dark Lord expected? What he wanted? Severina wasn’t confident she could feign love. No, it was better to minimize the lies.</p>
<p>From the edge of her vision, Severina observed Bellatrix pull back her left sleeve and present her forearm to the Dark Lord. He gripped her wrist and his wand tip dug into her flesh. The skin began to writhe and smolder and turn black. Bellatrix groaned and gasped, indistinguishable from pain or pleasure. Finally, the Mark settled into a jet black skull with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue.</p>
<p>Narcissa was next with an equally impressive offering from the Malfoys. Her voice was measured and dutiful. When the Dark Mark was added to her arm, Cissy’s body shook. She cried out in pain before biting her tongue and turning her cries to whimpers. Severina ignored her cries. She couldn’t help Cissy. She couldn’t even help herself.</p>
<p>
  <em> All I have is this potion and lies.</em>
</p>
<p>Alecto approached with a treasure of dark artifacts. Her voice held awe and fear. She shrieked against the Mark and her body wriggled like a worm.</p>
<p><em> Oh gods, I can’t give him liquid luck! What if he saw it as an offense? As though, I thought he needed luck? I should’ve drank the damn thing myself.</em> <em><strong> All I can offer is lies. </strong> </em></p>
<p>Severina approached but did not raise her head. She spoke no words as she reached into her velvet pouch. Her hand wrapped around the Felix Felicis. Then she released it, grabbing an empty vial instead. She placed the vial at the feet of the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>For the first time that night, there was noise from the witnesses- indistinct but discernible in its overarching scorn. She kept her gaze on the hem of the Dark Lord’s robes. She sensed the Dark Lord raise his hand and the noise died at once.</p>
<p>His hand entered her vision and Severina was almost surprised to see the slender masculine hand of a man, instead of an inhuman claw. The hand lifted the empty vial off the ground.</p>
<p>“An empty potion bottle.” His voice was flat; she couldn’t tell if he was angry, bored or annoyed.</p>
<p>Regulus complimented her, once, on her voice. So, as she spoke, she focused on making her voice clear and careful.</p>
<p>“My gift to you, My Lord, is a symbol and a promise. It is myself- empty, nothing, worthless. Nevertheless, an empty potion bottle to a true master is filled with potential. A true master may bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death. I am like this vial. I am nothing unless you, my Master, give me purpose. I have no gift for you, My Lord, but myself. All of myself, which is nothing but the potential you see and the purpose you give me. So, I humbly offer myself to you as the only thing I have and the only gift I can give. All, do I give to you and nothing do I withhold; for, I have nothing and I am nothing without you.”</p>
<p>The most honest of lies. She still breathed; that was encouraging.</p>
<p>
  <em> See Lily? I can be optimistic.</em>
</p>
<p>Severina studied the ground in front of her as she presented her left forearm. Time passed- how much, she was not sure, but it felt too long; her arm grew sore. Was he laughing at her? Were they all laughing at her? No, she heard nothing. Was he displeased? Was he angry? Would death come quickly or would it seem as eternal as this waiting? His hand reached down but not to her uplifted arm; instead he lifted her chin. She suspected what would come next; she emptied her mind. His eyes were blueish green- that’s all she noticed, before his eyes bore into hers and she felt him enter her mind.</p>
<p><em>I have to give him something or he’ll break down my walls.</em> She realized, in a panic.</p>
<p>So, Severina gave him a door, plain and black with an ivory handle- carved into the likeness of two snakes entwining. She hoped it would be enough to entice him away from her walls. She allowed herself to feel a measure of pleasure when he opened the door. On the other-side she had put a table and on the table, the empty vial with a note that read: ‘fill me, as you will.’</p>
<p>She felt his fingers grip her wrist and the tip of his wand press into her flesh. She may have screamed out if he hadn’t still been inside her mind. Instead, she focused on her mental image, directing the pain into the vial, filling it with fire and smoke and tar. Her physical flesh felt like it would melt from her body. A burning in her veins exploded from his wand and shot up to her throat and then to her heart. By the time it reached the rest of her body, she thought she might pass-out. She was sweating and breathing deeply but she made no sound. Her body may have trembled but she did not move away nor drop her eyes from his. Only when the Mark had settled did he release her mind. He took her hand and raised her to her feet. Severina then found her place beside Alecto. She’d done it; her other Master should be pleased.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord spoke, closing out the ceremony and for the first time, Severina examined him. He was handsome, too handsome. She wondered if it was a glamour. He was older, but not as old as she had expected. He looked to be in his thirties but she’d heard that he was of a similar age to Abraxas Malfoy, who was in his early fifties. No wonder Bellatrix sounded infatuated.</p>
<p>Was he vain? Certainly, but about his looks; so much so as to use a glamour? She looked close and noticed that his hair was thinning- it wasn’t obvious, but it was noticeable. Such a thing could be easily remedied with certain potions or charms. So, no he wasn’t vain about his looks. He was naturally this handsome. He used it to his advantage, but it wasn’t his source of pride. Severina took note never to flatter his appearance. If she was to gain his favor, she couldn’t make foolish mistakes like that.</p>
<p>His pride would be in his power then? Though, maybe not. If he had always been gifted with raw magical prowess, there is only little pride in that. To be in awe of his power would be to reveal your own magical shortcomings or insecurities. No, there must be something else that drives him.</p>
<p>Perhaps, his pride was the same as her own. His knowledge. Not his natural physical appeal nor his latent power nor even his higher intellect. It would be the skills he honed, the knowledge he worked to gain, and something else she was missing.</p>
<p>Severina looked across the Death Eaters who paid him rapt attention. It was the influence he gained over them all. It was his control over them.</p>
<p>Her left arm smarted.</p>
<p>
  <em>Us.</em>
</p>
<p>His control over <em>us.</em></p>
<p>After the ceremony, Bellatrix, Narcissa, Alecto and Severina were lead to their rooms. The rooms were not, however, near each other. Bellatrix was lead to the room that she would share with her husband which was also among the other members of the Lestrange house. Narcissa with Lucius and the Malfoys. Alecto beside her brother and father. Severina was lead to an almost obscure wing.</p>
<p>Her room was more modest than she expected, though she wondered why she might have expected more. It was decorated in deep blues and ivory satins. There was a door to an adjoining bathroom and a house-elf was present to help her bathe. The soaps smelt like lavender and sandalwood; with the elf's magic, her skin and hair never felt so soft before. After she dismissed the elf, Severina took out the Felix Felicis and thought of what Lucius had told her.</p>
<p>
  <em> “He likes to assert his dominance.” </em>
</p>
<p>It wasn’t lust that drove him to fuck his inner circle, it was <em>dominance</em>- a power play. Did he think them animals and he alone evolved? What of their placements? He’d fuck them in the beds they share with their husbands, in the rooms beside their fathers and brothers, and their families would believe they were powerless to stop him. The power isn’t in the act itself, however, it’s in the <em>inaction</em> of his followers. By not acting against him, they convince themselves that he is stronger than they are: cognitive dissonance. He’d use their own minds against them. Thus, he gains more power, more control.</p>
<p>
  <em>Four witches in one night, he must take a potion or he isn’t planning on visiting all of us. I would be last, in any case. He may not come to me at all. Still…</em>
</p>
<p>Severina lifted the stopper from the Felix Felicis and a golden drop hung, suspended on the tip of the stopper. She lifted it to her tongue. It tasted like wildflower honey.</p>
<p>The effects were immediate. Her eyes dilated and her mind was perfectly at peace. It seemed like a lucid dream. Her body moved and she watched. She did not feel disturbed; no, the potion made sure she’d be at peace with whatever happened. She removed her bathrobe and hung it on the golden hook in the bathroom. She put out the lights, opened the drapes and dimmed the fire to embers. Severina watched herself pull back the satin sheets, climb into the softest bed she’d ever known, before she swiftly fell asleep.</p>
