    <p>"Is Harry asleep?" James asked. Lily nodded as she sat beside her husband. They had only been discussing the war for a short time when they heard a conspicuous creaking of the gate. James peered out and looked back at Lily with horror.</p><p>"Lily, get Harry, run, hide. I'll try and stall him." She hesitated. "Run!" She ran upstairs and as she entered Harry's room; she heard the lock break. She grabbed Harry. The wards had been broken.</p><p>"Run, James, run to us." She said to herself out loud. Just then, she heard the very words she dreaded.</p><p>"Avada Kedavra!"</p><p>"No!" She called out, but stopped herself from a scream. He was gone. Her husband was gone. She had to save Harry. She heard someone coming up the steps. "No, no." She had to think fast. "Apparate." She shut her eyes and thought about somewhere she once felt safe. They disappeared into oblivion as the door shot open to Harry's room.</p><p>Lily landed on the grass and looked at Harry. He had thrown up on her blouse. Perfect. At least they were safe. She looked around. She was in her old neighborhood. Her parents didn't live there anymore since they had passed away, but it was place of refuge. Still, that thing didn't know where she grew up and she highly doubted he'd ever come here.</p><p>It was dark. Harry whimpered and a rumble of thunder rang in the air. She had to find a place of shelter. A restaurant, anywhere. Tears formed in her eyes as she took off down the road. She was not sure where to go or what to do now. She heard a noise and turned around. A cat. When she turned back, she hit something.</p><p>"Watch where you're going!" The man snapped at them, but then gave a gasp. "Lily?" Lily looked up in shock.</p><p>"Severus?" She had forgotten he used to live here too. How could she have forgotten? "You never saw us, understand?" She started away.</p><p>"Lily, wait." She stopped. "What happened?"</p><p>"He's after us. I'm sure you knew that, being one of them." She said it cockily, but at the look of shock on his face, she winced. He hadn't known.</p><p>"But, he, how? You were supposed to be hidden."</p><p>Lily was rather shaken that he knew that bit of information. "How did you know that?" He winced. "Tell me, dammit!"</p><p>"I told,"</p><p>"Voldemort where we were! You traitor!"</p><p>"NO!" She jumped slightly. "Not really. It's a long story, but no. Dumbledore was supposed to hide you. All of you."</p><p>"I know he hid us, but why would you know that?"</p><p>"The prophecy."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"The prophecy. It's my fault. No one thought he would believe such nonsense."</p><p>"What?" She was still confused. He looked guilt-ridden. "What did you do?"</p><p>"I overheard Trelawney make a silly prophecy.  I gave him what I heard as his former spy, thinking it was utter nonsense. He didn't think so and decided it meant you and your baby."</p><p>"How could you?" The hurt in her voice was unmistakable. It made him cringe inside.</p><p>"I didn't know. It was hogwash, or so I thought."</p><p>"Why you little" She stopped. "Was a spy? What do mean by that? You aren't anymore? He promoted you? What? To find us?"</p><p>"NO!" She jumped in surprise. "No one else knows. I went to Dumbledore after Voldemort took the prophecy seriously. He was supposed to protect you. How could it fail unless someone ratted you out somehow?" 

</p>
<p>She gasped. "He wouldn't have!"</p><p>"You didn't make yourselves secret keepers?" 

Lily gulped as tears pooled her eyes. "James wanted a friend to do it." She whispered. 

Severus scoffed. "Well, I wouldn't put it past Black to do that."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Black wasn't the secret keeper. He thought that would be too obvious. Pettigrew was."</p><p>Severus's eyes grew wide. "You're still friends with that rat?"</p><p>"James is, but why would you care?"</p><p>Severus's jaw locked as his eyes locked with hers. "I saw him."</p><p>She raised her forehead. "Where?"</p><p>"At the last Death Eater meeting. I thought you all had dropped him." Lily nearly dropped Harry, who was asleep in her arms now.</p><p>"No! No, he sold us out?" Tears began to fill her eyes again and she started to become dizzy. It was all too much at once.</p><p>Severus's expression softened as she headed into a panic. "Come on, we have to go to Dumbledore. I mean, Professor Dumbledore. Hogwarts is safe. We can apparate once away from here."</p><p>She didn't know why she trusted this man who was once her best friend. Something told her he would not harm her. Deep down, she knew he never would have harmed her.</p><p>"What happened to your shirt?" He asked suddenly.</p><p>"Oh, Harry didn't take kindly to being apparated, I guess."</p><p>"Where's Potter?" He asked with a sneer until he saw Lily's face fall in misery. "No."</p><p>"He's gone." She choked back tears as they walked. Out of sight, they apparated outside the gates of Hogwarts and entered inside the castle where they found Dumbledore wandering the corridors. The students were all in bed this time of night.</p><p>"Albus!" He turned.</p><p>"Lily, dear. What happened?"</p><p>"James. Voldemort. He came after us." She choked back tears, not wanting to break down right now. "He killed James. I got Harry and we got out just in time. He was coming for us, I heard him upstairs as we left."</p><p>"Oh, no. No, how did he find out?"</p><p>"Pettigrew." Severus spoke before Lily could. "He's a Death Eater."</p><p>"You saw him?"</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>"Black suggested Pettigrew. He thought it would be safer." She was shaking.</p><p>"You put your trust in the wrong person." Dumbledore said before turning to Severus. "Just like someone else I know."</p><p>Severus put his head down. Lily could have easily died tonight because he had trusted Voldemort and all because of a silly, stupid prophecy. If she had died, he never would have forgiven himself.</p><p>"I must find Black and inform him of what happened and that you two are okay." He started to leave the room. "Oh, um, Severus?" Severus looked at the Headmaster. "Take Lily and Harry to your place for the night. It should be a safe location. It'll be the last place Voldemort would look for them."</p><p>Take Lily to his place? He rarely ever let Lily in the place when they kids, but that was because of his father mostly. Now that his parents had passed away, he did not have to worry about that. It wasn't quite the pigsty it was when they children, but it was still a drab place.</p><p>"Yes, sir." He agreed reluctantly.</p><p>Dumbledore left and they followed. Lily wasn't sure she wanted to go Severus's place, but Dumbledore seemed to trust him. They left the grounds once more and apparated, landing at Spinner's End. Rain was pouring down. He led her inside, unsure how this was going to go. He expected this would end up being a complete disaster.</p>
