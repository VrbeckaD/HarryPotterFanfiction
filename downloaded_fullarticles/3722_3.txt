    <p>Remus dreamed of Sirius’ death years before it happened. He dreamed it every night, without fail, except for five different nights. </p><p>	For a while, Remus didn’t know why he had these dreams about his best friend. Why were the nonsensical dreams about Snape splitting James’ head in two with a cauldron after eating Peter replaced by a never-ending series of dreams featuring the transformation from live Sirius to dead Sirius? He therefore watched his friend closer, trying to make sense of it. For a short period of time, Remus thought that maybe it was related to the increase in stress he had to deal with. They were, after all, in their third year, and new classes meant an increase in homework and difficulty. He studied Padfoot further, trying to find a connection. All he saw was the shiny, lucious black hair set against the beautiful brown skin and dancing brown eyes. Nothing different. Nothing new. The only thing new he could detect about this situation was a strange occurrence from himself. Sometimes, when Moony was studying Padfoot’s profile, Pad’s would notice his gaze and make eye contact. This kind of eye contact was different than the kind they usually made; the laughing look when Sirius and/or James had just made a joke or pulled a prank, the soft look when discussing personal problems, the angry look when Snape had made a crack about Remus’ robes during the first week of their friendship. This eye contact gave Remus the chills. It sent a ripple through his body and he felt like he could fall into those dark eyes and never want to come out. Moony didn’t know what this meant, but he was wise enough not to immediately share it with his friends. This was a perplexing ordeal he’d have to figure out on his own. It was only, a month or two later, when James was describing the exact same symptoms he was experiencing due to Lily Evans, that Remus realized what was going on. He liked Sirius. And the first night he’d had a dream about his death, why, that was the day Remus Lupin had fallen in love with Sirius Black.</p>
