    <p>Elizabeth</p><p> </p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p> </p><p>I'm probably over thinking it all.  It's understandable to be weary.  After all, Hadrian killed Adalind.  Not that it bothers me that she's dead.  I never cared for her.  And its not that he killed her.  He's killed before and it's never bothered me before.  So why does it bother me now?</p><p> </p><p>I set my cup down with a click.  My hands tremble.  I have to be calm.  I have to be strong.  I can't let the others see that I'm unnerved.  I am the leading matron, they all look to me for guidance.  I must remain calm.</p><p> </p><p>They're all tense enough.  Each of them as shocked as I am.  Thankfully none of them have made a fuss.  They held themselves well and have stayed out of the way.   I suppose it's because they don't want to earn his wrath.  Especially with how calmly he cast the curse.  </p><p> </p><p>And that's the issue.  That isn't an easy curse.  It's difficult and exhausting and requires an entire woged coven and it may not even work completely.  It takes a very delicately laid circle of ruins to channel It.  Not just a rough circle of salt.  It takes hours of chanting and channeling power to fuel the curse.  But Hadrian set it up and cast the curse with a partial woge and he never touched the power of the coven.  </p><p> </p><p>It shouldn't be possible.  That curse is difficult for a reason.  And he cast it like it was nothing.  Like it had no effect on him to do it.  As if it took next to no energy.  As if such a powerful curse was no different than a woge.  It should never be that easy to cast!</p><p> </p><p>He was already exhausted from the potions effects that he pulled from Sean.  I have no idea how he managed that but I am grateful.  He shouldn't have been able to move for a day just from that.  And the curse takes so much out of you that it usually knocks the coven out for days.  At least he should've been exhausted.  But instead he acted as if it didn't even affect him.</p><p> </p><p>I sit down quickly before my knees give out.  I need to think this through.  I've never heard of anyone that powerful.  No one in all our written history can compare to that boy.  So how did he become so powerful?  It can't be the addition of royal blood.  Such a thing has happened before.  The halfbreed was killed while barely an adult and without any heirs but he did exist.  </p><p> </p><p>And children of halfbloods are weak.  That's a known fact.  Even when the halfbreed men get full hexens pregnant, the child is never as powerful as the mother.  It's why there is such a stigma against half-breeds.  They just aren't worth the trouble.  They don't have the power to contribute to a coven.  No one wants the liability they represent.  </p><p> </p><p>I remember Joselyn.  She came from a good pedigree, equal to my own.  But she was no great power.  Her abilities were average to any other hexen.  There was nothing exceptional about her.  So how is her son so powerful? </p><p> </p><p>Unless...  </p><p> </p><p>Joselyn was sweet and mild tempered with a sassy streak and pleasant humor.  She was small and slender and would've never survived in a traditional coven.  It's why I snatched her up.  She wanted to help others, so compassionate.  I still don't understand how she came out so gentle, I knew her mother well, but it worked in my favor.</p><p> </p><p>Sean loved her.  He was smitten from the moment they met.  And she sent sweet smiles his way from that moment on.  My shy boy took months before he worked up the nerve to talk to her.  And she liked him so much too.  I didn't have to push either of them too hard.  They just seemed to complete each other.  And she made Sean so happy.  I had never seen him so happy as he was when he was with her.  And to be honest, I've not seen so happy since.  Though he is getting much better now that he has his son back.</p><p> </p><p>I was proud when they conceived.  I knew the child wouldn't be very powerful but Sean's royal blood would protect them from the stigma of being born of a halfbreed.  And I could set up a good match for the child.  It would only take a couple generations for their powers to be up to my level and that's okay.  I accepted that when I had my son.  So long as we're careful to choose the right hexens then my son's half-breed blood will be bred out quick enough.</p><p> </p><p>None of this explains his son.  Unless...  But it's preposterous.  Sean would know.  If nothing else then he would know.  A parent always knows.  And he was so certain from day one.  He has never doubted.  And that's a bit odd.</p><p> </p><p>When he called me I thought he had gone mad.  To say that Joselyn's child was alive and found in his own territory.  It's insane!  No one would believe such a claim.  There would have been hints and rumors long before now.  There should've been something.  But there never was even the faintest rumor.</p><p> </p><p>I listened to his rambling and tried to piece it all together.  It wasnt easy.  His words came too fast and what he was claiming was so far out there.  Even if his child survived, where has the boy been all these years?  How did the boy get into Sean's canton?  Who kept him prisioner to the point that no one even knew such a child existed?</p><p> </p><p>And I did ask around.  With what Sean was able to tell me I spoke with old friends in the laufer.  They knew nothing of any such child.  They have spies in every royal house and none of them are keeping a child prisioner.  Not a one.  And i trust the information I gathered.</p><p> </p><p>So when I arrived in the territory with four young hexens at my back, I was ready for anything.  I was ready to welcome a grandson or scream imposter.  I was ready to help protect my son's lost heir or fight off a manipulative enemy.  I was ready for anything, but i held out little hope.</p><p> </p><p>Still, Sean pulled me into his room to talk.  He told me of the boy, how he had been found and a brief description of his protector.  He told me of what little more the boy has admitted too.  He told me of the boys desire to help others, so like his mother.  And I started to believe it to.</p><p> </p><p>He showed me the boys journals.  The ones with drawings of Wesen and information that would be relevant to heal them.  He showed me the journal labeled potions.  He even let me see a few samples of what the boy has brewed.  It was all beyond impressive.</p><p> </p><p>It painted a picture of a tortured boy who only wants to help others.  A boy that is eagar to please and desperate for affection.  A boy that never had an adult, or anyone, that he could trust but he wants that.  A child who is desperate for a family.  Found by a man who never moved on from the loss of his child.</p><p> </p><p>I wondered if that was the reason.  I wondered if it was their desperate desire for family that linked them.  And its possible.  It's entirely possible that they latched onto each other.  Its also possible that the boys powers have bound them closer.  Especially if he's half as powerful as Sean claimed.  </p><p> </p><p>Either way, Sean claimed the boy and I wasn't going to argue.  No one else was missing a child.  No one else would have cared to take in the boy.  And if he is so powerful as Sean says them it can only be a good thing.  The boy will be a boon to our bloodline.  He will be a blessing.  And no one needs to know if it's not true.</p><p> </p><p>Then the boy came home and power slammed through the apartment.   It was such a strong hit that both Sean and I fell.  I thought we were under attack.  But then Sean screams the boys name and struggles to race out there.  I try to stop him because there is no way I'm fighting that power for some kid he found.</p><p> </p><p>Only the power came from the boy.  And the boy immediately pulled back.  Not completely, not until Sean told him too.  But he obeyed and even looked embarrassed by his actions.  He even seemed unaware of what exactly he did.  But he responded so well to Sean and in that moment I could see the connection.  In that moment it only made sense that this child is Sean's. </p><p> </p><p>I've ignored all the discrepancies.  Like how the boys eyes are such a startling shade of emerald while both Sean's and Joselyn's eyes were much lighter.  I ignored how the soft lines of his face are so different to the sharper edges of his parents.  How his hair is black while neither parents hair is so darkly colored.  Genetics can come out different than you would expect.  </p><p> </p><p>Any differences in appearance I simply shrugged off.  Any time I would look at him and wonder, I just pushed it away.  From the moment he blushed and ducked his head shyly while calling me grandmother.  My heart just melted at the sight.  And nothing else mattered.  He was so obviously my grandson and no one who met him would think different.</p><p> </p><p>But could that be the problem?  Could meeting him have changed my thoughts so drastically?  I was still skeptical when Sean was telling me about him.  So why did my opinion change after meeting him?  I never saw him cast any spell.  But considering what he has already done, would I have noticed?</p><p> </p><p>And didnt he do something similar before?  Didn't he, with only a partial woge, command a hundjager to obey his order?  And didn't the hundjager do so with no notice of any other commands issued by his king.  And when they reached the hotel, didn't the hundjager remain catatonic?  Didn't they have to put him down?</p><p> </p><p>Could the boy be unaware of what he's doing?  He does seem somewhat clueless to the effect his power has on others.  Could it be that he wants so desperately for a family that he is unconsciously binding us to believe it too?  It would explain why even Frederick believes it.  If the boy believes it to be true and his power is making it true.  </p><p> </p><p>And hasn't he been changing?  His hair isn't as dark, now it's more of a dark brown.  But I know it was black when I first met him.  And he's grown taller.  That could be due to him getting regular meals and learning to build up muscle.  I imagine in a few more years he'll have a similar frame to Sean.  That seems to be where he's going.  One could argue it's just because hes a growing boy.</p><p> </p><p>But I have a picture of their first Christmas.  The tree decorated in gold and white.  The boy, just a slim pale thing curled into himself.  So unsure as he smiles for the photo next to a proudly beaming Sean.  It could be simply that he has changed as he has grown.  It could be natural.  But what if it's not?</p><p> </p><p>The timer chimes on the counter.  Time to stir the potion.  It's a simple one.  An average potion to stop conception.  Because with the power rolling around upstairs there will definitely be babies unless something is done.  This is just if they need it.  Just on case Sean orders it.  And he most likely will.  That son of mine doesn't want children.  I know, I've been trying to fix that for years.  But Hadrian will most like be proud of more babies.</p><p> </p><p>Should I be proud or worried?  And Sean is bound into the coven with Hadrian.  I've never heard of such a thing before.  Why in the world would two Zauberbeist want to share a coven?  Could it have been a trap?  Could it be a way to control Sean?  Could it be a way to control royal blood?</p><p> </p><p>But the boy is so sweet.  Isn't he?  Hasn't he so eagerly wanted to learn to help others?  Hasn't he been quick to apologize when he realizes his power has scared others?  Doeznt he scoff and grumble about the darker curses and tranks?  </p><p> </p><p>So why did he cast this one?</p><p> </p><p>That's the question.  That's what's thrown us all for a loop.  Because if he can cast such a curse with ease then what else will he do?  It's clear that his power holds no limit but the one he gives himself.  So what all is he willing to do?  How far is he willing to go?  </p><p> </p><p>I need to know more.  I need to know where he came from.  I need to know where he was held prisioner.  I need answers.  And I'll not find them here.  No, I won't find them here.  I'll have to leave.  </p><p> </p><p>I can pass the clinic to Hannah Buckley of the Lawder coven.  She's an obgyn and her license should come through any day now.  She had to jump through a lot of hoops since arriving, medical degrees don't cross international borders easily.  But she's worked so hard to get everything in order.  Yes, she can handle my appointments until I get back.</p><p> </p><p>I'll leave now, before the boys wake for the day.  I'll talk to the hexens first to be sure they're settled.  It won't do to have them panicking while I'm gone.  And I'll write a note for Sean.  If I wait for him to wake them he'll ask too many questions.  I'm not sure he would believe any lie I tell.  And I can't risk tipping off the boy, not if my suspicion is right.  I hope for Sean's sake that I'm wrong.  But as I always say, plan for the worst so you're never surprised.</p>
