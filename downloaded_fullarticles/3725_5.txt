    <strong>"Sirius!"</strong>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="justify">It was with a shout that Harry awoke, again, from a nightmare. He didn't look around his dorm this time as he made himself remember that he had put up a silencing charm around his four poster bed. Although his friends had told him not to worry about waking them after a nightmare, he couldn't let that keep happening, lest he make them angry, as he was sure they already were.</p>
<p align="justify">It had already been at least a week since his godfather had died. He had been having the same nightmare continuously since the events of the Department of Mysteries. Well almost the same. They had started as it happened, with Bellatrix Lestrange cursing Sirius, and thus Sirius falling through the Veil. Now, however, they had changed and now continued the same; instead of Bellatrix cursing Sirius and falling through the Veil, it was in fact he who pushed Sirius through the Veil. Harry knew that that was not how it happened but since the guilt he felt since then, he felt like it was what had happened. </p>
<p align="justify">Dumbledore had told him that it was not his fault, that Sirius was his own man and made his own decisions. Harry tried to take comfort from that, but a few minutes later, he just felt the same guilt settle over him like a well worn blanket. He bitterly took comfort in the guilt, knowing that he was to blame and that even though others said differently, they thought the same. Ron and Hermione had been good to him, but he always saw the looks of shame on their faces when they thought he was not looking. It was like, even though they were his friends and wanted to be there for him, they blamed him.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry felt like everything was always his fault. At least the bad things that happened to him and those around him that he cared about. Just because he was the damn Boy-Who-Lived. First his parents, then Cedric, then of course the attack on Mr. Weasley. Then now, the worst of all of them, Sirius.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry continued to stare at his curtains with blank eyes. He didn't like waking up at all ends of the night, but he felt it was the least he could do. To atone for murdering his godfather. He could go with sleepless night for a long while. He sat there for a few minutes trying to reign in his breathing. After his breathing was normal again, he crawled over to the side of his bed and peeked out of the curtains to see his bedside table, looking at the clock he saw that it was only 3:30 AM. Harry groaned silently, then swung his legs around and over the edge to dangle on the side of his bed, and stood up.</p>
<p align="justify">The sudden dizziness that occurred did not even hinder him, he just simply stood, waited for the dizziness to pass. After it had, Harry went to his wardrobe, pulled out his bed robe. He wrapped himself in it and tied the sash around him. He then went to his school trunk and fished out the Marauders' Map and the invisibility cloak. He took a glance over at all his friends' beds and sighed when he saw that he had not awoken any of them. Knowing that he was not discovered, he made his way to the dorm bathroom on the far side of the large room. He gently opened the door, slipped inside and then closed it just as gently. As soon as he heard the soft click of the door settle, did he breathe easier. He automatically went towards one of the sink mirror to asses what he had to work with.</p>
<p align="justify">He knew that the school would be letting out for the summer in two days time, so he wanted to make sure that nobody knew how troubled he was. What a complete wreck he was. Oh he k new people were worried about him, thus the reason to cover up any appearance that would say <em>'Hey! I am totally <strong>screwed </strong></em><em>up here! Help me! I need help!" </em>He made it over to the sink and before he looked up, he took a deep breath. He kept his focus on his breathing to make sure that it would remain calm. After a few minutes of retaining a calm mind he looked up to the mirror.</p>
<p align="justify">The sight that greeted him was not in any way recognizable. The imaged presented did not look good nor happy. He actually gasped at what he saw. It was the first time in close to five days that he had actually had the courage to look at his own reflection. He had deep, dark circles under his eyes; his cheek bones were sharp and sunken, making them and his chin quite noticeable. His neck was as slender as a twig. (okay, maybe that is exaggerating a little, but you get what i mean.)</p>
<p align="justify"><em>'I knew that I wasn't eating a lot,' </em>harry thought to himself. <em>'But I didn't think I was actually this bad off! It looks like I am starving myself! Damn! I look like a freaking pole!' </em>Harry didn't realize that he had not rally eaten a smidgen of what a bird would eat for a little snack. The teenager just didn't have much of a appetite. <em>'No wonder...this explains why I have been dizzy all the time!'</em> He thought to back to himself wryly. It almost made him laugh. He would have if he didn't know that if people ever saw him this way, he would be in serious trouble! But at this moment in time, Harry just couldn't bring himself to care.</p>
<p align="justify">He continued to stare at himself for a couple more minutes. After a little bit, he closed his eyes, and gave a big forlorn sigh. He had to put the glamours back up before he snuck out, in case he was caught by anyone. Teacher or fellow student. He didn't want to even risk getting caught tonight.</p>
<p align="justify">He had a plan to carry out tonight. He knew exactly what he wanted to do. He was just unsure on <em>if</em> he could pull it off. He wanted to see his mother and father and Sirius again. No he didn't <em>want</em> to kill himself, not at all; but he knew he <em>needed</em> to. He had thought about it a few times in the last couple of days, and a lot more throughout his life, but he knew he had to fight. He was the 'Chosen One' after all. It was up to the Famous Boy-Who-Lived Potter to defeat the greatest Dark Lord ever!</p>
<p align="justify">When Dumbledore had told him the prophecy, he took it in stride. <em>'Nothing different then what I have done four times already!' </em>He had thought bitterly. He couldn't believe that Dumbledore expected him, a 15 year old boy to defeat a well over 50 year old dark wizard who had more experience and  had killed his parents. No, not defeat. Kill. Dumbledore and the whole big world was depending on a boy to kill. </p>
<p align="justify">Harry just shuddered at the memory of what Dumbledore had told him. He had always thought of Dumbledore like a Grandfather and that Dumbledore had cared for him. Apparently he was mistaken. Dumbledore had been using him. All this time, he was using him as a pawn! Harry growled silent at the thought. Everyone always just used him. Dumbledore used him as a pawn, Ron for his fame, Hermione used him to make herself feel superior, Snape used him to vent his hatred for his father on. Aunt Petunia used him as a house-elf, Duddly; a punching bag. And then his uncle Vernon...he cut off all thoughts on that thought. No use feeling any more shame. He was not going there right now. Long story short, though, people just used him.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry stopped his thinking there, not wanting to dwell on anything other than the task he needed to accomplish. He didn't want to keep feeling, if all he was to feel was unhappiness, hate, guilt, and despair. He wanted to be happy for once, and tonight, he was going to find it. So he gathered all his focus and concentrated it into visioning what he need to look like, then massaging his magic to complete the appearance of his glamour. It took a lot longer for him to complete then it would a <em>healthy</em> young wizard to do. When he felt the magic settle across his skin, he looked in the mirror again. This time, he smiled at the now familiar and more recognizable face. He looked like any normal teenage boy.</p>
<p align="justify">He spared another second to study himself, then abruptly closed his eye, turned away from his reflection, gathered his cloak, and swung it around his shoulders. He pulled out his wand from his sock, holding it, he whispered, '<em>LUMOS,' </em>. He then took out his map, said the words to activate it, and opened it up to see who all was still awake at this ungodly hour. When he saw that only a few ghosts were present, and not a single teacher or student moving, he smiled again. He stalked towards the bathroom door, and just as gently and silently as before slipped through it. This time instead of heading back towards his bed in which he came, he made for the door that led to the common room downstairs.</p>
<p align="center">It took Harry a few minutes to make it to the common room, and to the Fat Lady's portrait that guarded his house's tower. He again glanced at his map, still seeing no one moving, he held his breath and pushed the portrait open.<br/>~~~~~HP~~~~~HP~~~~~HP~~~~~</p>
