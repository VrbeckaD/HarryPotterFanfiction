    <p align="center">The Last Summoner</p><p align="center">Chapter 1</p><p align="center">The First Summon</p><p>            “Well,” Harry said with a confidence that was only known to him when he was about to say something brash or ill-planned, “I thought of becoming a teacher, for Defense Against the Dark Arts.” Harry Potter, a short handsomely cute fifteen year old, was sitting in the office of his head of house, Professor McGonagall, for career advice. On Professor McGonagall’s desk was a mass of leaflets and pamphlets, however both Harry and Professor McGonagall did not look at the pile, for their eyes shifted towards the intruder of their meeting.</p><p>The intruder was a stout woman with a toady face and bulging eyes, wearing a pink cardigan and bow on the top of her hair. Professor Umbridge, Ministry appointed teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts, Hogwarts High Inquisitor, also appointed by the Ministry, and the worst person that ever existed and Harry had the most unfortunate luck of meeting. It was she, sitting in the corner with a clipboard on her lap, who ruined Hogwarts for Harry. Banned him from Quidditch. Ran Dumbledore out with her and the Minister’s stupid belief that the kids Harry was teaching was an army. A most vile, disgusting and heartless woman whom Harry wanted nothing more then to just never exist.</p><p>“You will need top grades for that,” Professor McGonagall said, not moving to get a leaflet. “Obviously you will need to have a N.E.W.T. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, however at least for Hogwarts, you are required to have a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s as well as a personal interview with the headmaster. However, I must warn you that experience, above all else, will be needed.”</p><p>At this moment Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor McGonagall ignored her.</p><p>“You’ll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?” she went on, talking a little more loudly than before.</p><p>“Yes,” Harry said.</p><p>“Naturally, you will need Defense Against the Dark Arts, as it is the subject you are hoping to teach. I would also advise you to take other subjects to round out your education, Headmasters like to have a professor who is competent in their own subject, and knowledgeable in others. In this light, I advise Transfiguration, and I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T. classes unless they have achieved “Exceeds Expectations’ or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I’d say you’re averaging ‘Acceptable’ at the moment, so you’ll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,” she added, with the merest flick of a smile. “When encountering the Dark Arts it is useful to have a knowledge of potions and antidotes, Potter. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than ‘Outstanding’ in their O.W.L.s so—”</p><p>Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.</p><p>“May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?” Professor Umbridge asked curtly, without looking at Umbridge.</p><p>“Oh no, thank you very much,” Umbridge said with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much. “I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interrupted, Minerva?”</p><p>“I daresay you’ll find you can,” Professor McGonagall said through clenched teeth.</p><p>“I was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has quite the temperament for a teacher?” Professor Umbridge said sweetly.</p><p>“Were you?” Professor McGonagall said haughtily. “Well, Potter,” she continued, as though there had been no interruption, “if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between ‘Acceptable and ‘Exceeds Expectations’ for the last two years, so your Charm work seem satisfactory; as for Defense Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought—<em>are you quite sure you do not need a cough drop, Dolores?”</em></p><p>“Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,” simpered Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. “I was just concerned that you might not have Harry’s most recent Defense Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I’m sure I slipped in a note …”</p><p>“You mean this?” Professor McGonagall said in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry’s folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment.</p><p>“Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed pronounced aptitude for the subject, which we are always looking for in future teachers—”</p><p>“Did you not understand my note, Minerva?” Professor Umbridge asked in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough.</p><p>“Of course I understood it,” Professor McGonagall said, her teeth clenched so tightly that the words came out a little muffled.</p><p>“Well, then, I am confused. …I’m afraid I don’t quite understand how you can give Mr. Potter false hope—”</p><p>“False hope?” Professor McGonagall repeated, still refusing to look at Professor Umbridge. “He has achieved high marks in all his Defense Against the Dark Arts tests—”</p><p>“I’m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me—”</p><p>“I should have made my meaning plainer,” Professor McGonagall said, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. “He has achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.”</p><p>Professor Umbridge’s smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning.</p><p>“Any questions, Potter?”</p><p>“Yes,” Harry said, “You mentioned experience earlier, what sort of experience is Hogwarts looking for in their professors?”</p><p>“Personal experience in your subject, Potter,” Professor McGonagall said. “In the past, you have proven time and again your expertise in dealing with the Dark Arts, it is experience such as yours that is sorely lacking in our current staffing.” Her eyes glared at Umbridge as she said that. “You will not be hired right away after you graduate, Potter, but through dedication and persistence, you will teach. If not here, then another school. That concludes our career consultation.” Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Umbridge.</p><p>He remembered that he promised to meet Ron and Hermione in the library afterwards, so that was where he headed. As he walked, he stopped when he heard a voice called out, “Potter!”</p><p>Turning around, Harry saw a tall older teen with a built frame and wiry blonde hair walk up to him. Dressed in Gryffindor colors, the teen stopped and smiled at Harry, which caused the teen’s cheeks to redden slightly. “Wanted to talk with you,” he said.</p><p>“Oh uh.. okay um…” Harry found himself blanking on the teen’s name.</p><p>“Cormac, Cormac McLaggen,” the teen introduced himself, giving Harry’s hand a very strong handshake. Still holding onto Harry’s hand, he said, “I heard about your lessons and teaching stuff. Too bad about it, eh? Shame I didn’t hear about it so I could join.”</p><p>“Uhh yeah,” Harry said. “Who did you hear it from?”</p><p>“My mates who were in it, I couldn’t join because I was sick in the hospital wing,” McLaggen said. “I ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet,” he grinned, his teeth somehow sparkling. “Missed the Quidditch tryouts too because of that. Which is a shame cause I’m a great Keeper—better than that Weasley bloke. I mean he got better, but I’m still the best.”</p><p>“Excuse me but ‘that Weasley bloke’ is actually my best friend,” Harry said hotly. “Is there a reason for calling me up or—”</p><p>“Oh right, well I just thought that since you’ve freed up your time, and I heard a small rumor about you, so I want to ask you on a date,” Cormac said confidently.</p><p>Harry’s cheeks redden more. “Uhh… gee that’s a nice offer but I have to go,” he said, pulling his hand out of Cormac’s, “I’ll uhh think about it though, goodbye.” And without another look, Harry spun on his feet and walked away quickly.</p><p> Distracted, Harry walked into the library to find that it was strangely empty. Frowning, Harry stood in the doorway, looking at the empty large hall of bookcases and tables. Madam Pince, the librarian, was nowhere to be found. Finding this weird, Harry walked further into the library, the doors closing behind him. <em>I guess Ron and Hermione are here somewhere, </em>Harry thought to himself.</p><p>He ventured further in, taking his time as he looked for his friends, he wanted to clear his head about that strange Cormac encounter. It was strange, in Harry’s mind, that he never saw or heard of Cormac before today. He thought he knew all the older years, and yet there seemed to be more popping out whenever was needed or convenient. <em>I wonder if the friends are Fred and George, </em>Harry mused as he turned a corner in a series of bookcases expecting to see a table. But he didn’t.</p><p>Instead, Harry walked into something he never saw before in his life. The bookcases all grew and curved onto themselves, their books staying perfectly still inside as a long, dark corridor greeted him. Harry could barely see the end of the corridor, instead it seemed to go on and on for miles. He knew that he should have turned around, but he did not. Something pulled Harry, something deep inside him pulled on his soul it felt like. Harry took a step forward and went into the corridor.</p><p>As soon as he stepped into it, all noise around him stop, his footsteps left no muffled noises, his breath was silent, it was as though he was walking on nothing. He turned around only to be met with the same long corridor that was before him. <em>This doesn’t make sense, </em>Harry thought. But seeing no way back, he decided to venture onward. As he walked, Harry tried to read the book spines that filled the cases that made up the corridor. Most of the time, it was too dark. When he squint and focus, he could read out a word or two here and there. Some in English, but most in a language he did not understand or recognize. Deeper and deeper he walked on, and as he walked, he noticed that the book conditions worsened. Letters faded, spines loose, even the bookcases looked to have aged and cracked as his eyes gotten used to the darkness. But still there was no sound, no footsteps or breathing, after a while Harry felt that instead of walking, he was floating down the corridor, it’s impossible end slowly growing inch by inch after what seemed a lifetime.</p><p>And suddenly, sound invaded. Harry’s footsteps thundered into the room, his breathing shook his core and an unearthly hum echoed around Harry as he looked at his new surroundings. “This is Hogwarts?” he spoke aloud. The room was perfectly circular, it’s stone walls and flooring covered in thick layers of dust and cobwebs. There was nothing in the room except for three things: A door, a bookstand, and a book. The door was on the opposite side of Harry, so completely covered in dust and cobwebs, he almost missed it. The bookstand, however, was perfectly clean. As was the floor directly under it. It was as though the dust and deterioration of age was afraid of touching the bookstand, of ruining or touching the contents that laid so preciously on it.</p><p>With cautious steps, Harry approached the stand and saw on top of it an old thick book, whose cover was black leather and written in gold, in perfect condition, read <em>The Art of Summoning</em>. There was no author. “Summoning?” Harry read. He touched the book’s cover, and a shock tore through his hand, causing the teen to jump back.</p><p>The unearthly hum in the room rose, as though awaken, and whispers came from it, whispering in a tongue Harry did not know. The tugging pulled Harry closer, combining with his innate curiosity. Despite the shock, Harry approached the book once again and touched the cover. There was no shock, and the whispers stopped, as though anticipating Harry’s next move.</p><p>He took a deep breath and opened the book.</p><p>Wind roared throughout the room, the whispers chanted their foreign chant and the pages in the book began turning themselves, its pages glowing as Harry found himself stuck staring at it. He stared in marvel as the pages turned, the glow of the book almost blinding him, symbols appearing that made Harry bend over, his hands holding onto the edge of the bookstand. Then, it stopped. The pages laid flat, the wind died, and the whispers remained. Harry stared at the pages. It was an unrecognizable language that greeted Harry. A language that, in Harry’s opinion, must have died hundreds of years ago. He shook his head, “I can’t read this,” he said to the room.</p><p>As if hear him, the book gave a warm, gentle glow. There was no winds, but the whispers shifted, sounding just as warm and calm as the light that came from the thick book. Harry watched amazed as right before his eyes, the runes in the pages shifted, word by word becoming recognizable, becoming English for him to read. Even the whispers, Harry felt, were changing as in his ears, gentle like a lover’s kiss, the whispers enchanted him. “Read… Read…Read…”</p><p>Encouraged by the whispers, Harry looked down at the book. Above it, a circle glowed, around its edges were sigils and marks that moved with the circle slowly. Harry looked through the circle, and read, the air heavy with a magic older than what felt like the castle itself.</p><p>“<em>Come from the earth and air, come from the fires and waters, come from the light and dark. Come from the six elements and listen to my call. I summon you, bind you, and bring you into form! Come and heed my call! Come beasts of the earth and air, of the fires and waters and light and dark! Come! I summon you!”</em></p><p>The whispers sang and cheered, dancing around the room as the circle gave out its most powerful glow, and from it a form appeared. Harry watched transfixed as the old magic gathered and formed in front of him, and out of the circle came a snake. It was long and thick with scales as black as night and eyes as yellow as the autumn moon. The circle faded as the snake coiled itself on top of the book’s pages, its head raised to meet Harry at eye level. Harry surprised himself as he felt no fear, instead they stared at one another as the circle faded completely, leaving only the book and the cheering whispers.</p><p>The snake flicked its tongue out, hissing for a few moments, and, much to Harry’s surprise, talked. “Thank you for releasing me. I am called Nazir, and I will be your instructor and familiar, little Summoner.”</p>
