    <p>It was Ron who realised it. Not the ghost part. That came much later. It was the lack of hunger that pinged him. Now, some people (Ginny) may say that Ron ate too much. But Ron personally believes that he ate just the right amount.</p>
<p>Harry, on the other hand, did not really seem to eat. Or even get hungry. He skipped breakfast most days, and he avoided contact like it was contagious. Now Ron wasn't the most tactful person(thank you Bill) but he tried (according to Percy, at least) and he wanted to be a good friend. So he played along. Gave a clap-back to Seamus and ensured that Harry has the space he needed. </p>
<p>Perhaps, that is why it took him a week to realise that something was off. He almost brought the topic up with the twins, but bit his tongue at the last moment. Those two did not need more ammunition for their latest routine of Ickle Ronniekinns. But something was off, and now that he had thought about it, it did not escape his mind.</p>
<p>He made a list of possible reasons Harry had an aversion to food and touch. There was an issue of Mad Muggle that said some muggles have anxiety. And while Harry was not a muggle, his family was. That was probably it. He was going to ask Harry about it and be tactful and ensure Harry that it's okay and surely Madam Pomfrey could fix it. </p>
<p>And honestly, what you should remember is that he tried. He waited for the perfect moment, just the two of them. Only, instead of asking about Harry's family, he said, "Can I touch you, Harry?"</p>
<p>And while he was mortified, Harry simply seemed amused. So, at least he didn't botch it up too much. Maybe. Harry was almost nonchalant about it, "If you must, Ron" and extended his hand for a shake. Breathing a relieved breath, Ron smiled and went to shake his hand. Only his hand passed through what felt like a curtain of ice.</p>
<p>As their eyes met, all Ron could say was "Bloody hell"</p>
