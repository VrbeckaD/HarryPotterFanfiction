  <strong> <u>Chapter One</u> </strong>
</p><p>“Happy birthday Draco.” Narcissa smiled at him from across the table in the dining room where they were partaking in a succulent breakfast. The House Elves bustled around the dining room, placing wrapped presents at the head of the table. Once they’d finished eating their rich meal, Narcissa gave Draco a look. It was an assessing one, a scrutinising one. It left Draco feeling apprehensive.</p><p>“Mother…?”</p><p>“I have something from you father. He wanted me to give this to you on your nineteenth birthday.” Narcissa drew a letter from her formal robes and handed it to Draco. It had their family seal in wax, keeping it closed, but there was also another seal on it that he did not recognise off the top of his head. He broke both seals and recognised his father’s looping script. </p><p>
  <em>Dear Son of Mine,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It is on this day, your nineteenth birthday, that you begin the ultimate journey of upholding your birthright: bringing an heir to the Malfoy name, through courtship and marriage. As is tradition, one of the lovely eligible women of The Sacred Twenty Eight has been chosen for you. We believe she is of good pedigree and sound intelligence. She is from the Greengrass family. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>We, The House of Malfoy, hereby pair you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, with Astoria Greengrass. The courtship period begins today. Your presence is required at the Greengrass Residence at two in the afternoon. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Make us proud, son.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lucius Malfoy.</em>
</p><p>On the next page was a list of rules, ending with signatures of both patriarchs from the families. He read some of the rules:</p><p><em>1. </em><em>You are to be accompanied by a chaperone at all times while with your intended</em> <em>(unsupervised visitation and outings are outlined in Rules #20-22).</em></p><p>
  <em>5. </em>
  <em>The courting period will last for a period of six months; again, all excursions will be chaperoned.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>14. </em>
  <em>The engagement must be witnessed by the Heads of the Families; should they be unable to attend, agreed upon replacements are acceptable.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>30. </em>
  <em>The intended pair must attend family dinners hosted by either family.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>31. </em>
  <em>The intended pair must attend social gatherings together.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>37. </em>
  <em>Intercourse is not approved or allowed until the intended pair have bound themselves in matrimony.</em>
</p><p>"This is barmy." Draco murmured as he lifted his head to look at his mother. A serene smile graced her angular features.</p><p>"This is tradition, my son."</p><p>“I understand, mother. But…”</p><p>“If you fail to embrace this tradition, Astoria will never be able to marry, ever. Her reputation will be tarnished; she will be considered used goods, even if you never initiate the process of courtship. You two have been bound for the last five years, intended for each other. She is a lovely young woman, Draco. You will not be disappointed. The robe you are to wear to the Greengrasses is in your room on your bed. Go get dressed.” Draco stood and walked to his room in the East Wing. On his bed, as promised, were the robes he was supposed to wear. They were a midnight blue, and the collar, hems, and sleeves were lined with slate grey. He put on the robes and looked at himself in the mirror. His hair had grown, and was no longer slicked to his head. It ran to just past his ears and slight wave to it. He had a light scruff of facial hair. Pansy, ever obsessed with fashion, had called it ‘the surfer look’, which had bewildered him. He sat down at the desk in front of the window nook and took out a piece of parchment and a quill. He paused with the quill over the inkwell for a moment, just thinking. Then he set the quill to parchment and started to write, the script so similar to his father’s.</p><p>
  <em>Blaise,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I haven’t had a chance to open your present yet, but thank you in advance. I got a… surprise which stalled any more unwrapping of gifts. Astoria Greengrass, Daphne’s sister, and I have been arranged to be married. There was a letter from my father telling me that I needed to ‘bring an heir to the Malfoy name’, and there were rules! Fifty of them! They are all ridiculous. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>There’s no way out of this, but what if I don’t like her? What if we aren’t compatible? How do I do this? It’s going to be incredibly bloody awkward. I need to be there later on today for the first meeting to take place. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Wish me luck,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco Lucius Malfoy.</em>
</p><p>  He tied the parchment to his eagle owl, who flew out the open window and grew smaller as the distance grew. He glanced at the time and realised he had to get going. He moved downstairs, slipping his wand into the inside pocket of his robe. Narcissa was waiting for him, holding out a box.</p><p>“A family heirloom, to give to Astoria. It belonged to my grandmother. It is customary.” Narcissa said when Draco’s eyebrows winged up. He took it from her and opened it. Inside lay a silver pendant, the charm depicting a snake, also in silver, curling around a thumbnail sized emerald. He closed the box and put that in the inside of his robes as well.</p><p>“It will be a fitting gift for her, I hope. Thank you, mother. I am going to apparate, less mess that way.”</p><p>“You’ll be met just outside the property by one of your main chaperones. You’ll be fine.” Narcissa’s hands smoothed along Draco’s shoulders, and then she kissed both his cheeks.</p><p>“See you when I return, mother.”</p><p>“Yes! You must tell me everything.” Narcissa said, excitement making her voice not completely steady. Draco left the house, walked outside the wards. He took a deep breath to settle his nerves, and spun to apparate, hoping this initial meeting wouldn’t be the disaster he thought it was going to be.</p>
