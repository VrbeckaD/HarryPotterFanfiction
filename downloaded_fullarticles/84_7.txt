    <p>Rey knew something was up from the moment she stepped onto Platform 9 3/4 , but she couldn’t quite place what it was. A second ago, it was only her and the cart she was pushing through the wall, but now—there was something else, like another presence in her mind. She felt like she was being watched. She looked around, but everyone else was too engulfed in the families they were hugging and kissing goodbye and the suitcases they were lugging onto the train. She didn’t have one of those. That is—she didn’t have a family. She had plenty of suitcases. She decided that for the time being, she would focus on getting on the train and finding her friends, and worry about whatever was going on inside her head later. Maybe five years ago, before she had gotten her Hogwarts letter, before she even knew that magic was existed, back when the four walls of her orphanage were the most exciting place she had ever been, she would have dismissed this as nothing. </p><p>But having lived in the magical world for five years, she knew, at least, that there was so much she didn’t know. This could be nothing, sure, but it could also be, like, the next great dark lord peaking around in your brain. She’d ask her friends about it later, then maybe snoop around the library a bit. She relegated whatever it was to a corner of her brain, putting a metaphorical cage around it and promising to return later. </p><p>Rey began hauling her suitcases onto the train. She stepped up into the aisle, peaking into each of the compartments, looking for any of her friends. She didn’t find them there, but she practically walked right into Finn. “REY!” He yelled, something like excitement or fear in his eyes. “I need to talk to you.”</p><p>“Finn, I’ve missed you.” She said with a smile. The two tried to hug, finding it a somewhat awkward arrangement with all that was in Rey’s hands. Finn took one of her suitcases and ushered her down the aisle. </p><p>“So, what do you need to talk to me about?” </p><p>Finn looked around at all the other students walking in and out of their compartments, and thought better of it. “Er, maybe later. Hey, did you see Rose yet?”</p><p>“Not yet, no. I imagine her and Paige are still out there with their families. Have you?”</p><p>Finn shook his head, that wild look in his eyes again. “No, I’m avoiding her.” He said in a rush. “And you haven’t seen Poe yet, have you?”</p><p>It was slowly coming together for Rey. “Um, no. You’re the first one I’ve seen. Is this what you needed to talk to me about? Did something happen?”</p><p>“No, no,” Finn said, his voice low. He opened the door to a compartment, already stacked with Finn’s own luggage and a frog waiting for them on one of the seats. “Nothing happened, exactly. It’s just, well, that’s why I needed to talk to you.”<br/>
Rey deposited her own luggage up above, beside Finn’s. She wondered if their friends would be joining them, and if so, if their luggage would fit. “So spit it out.” She said, trying not to sound too harsh. </p><p>“Well—”</p><p>There was a gentle tap at the compartment door, and Rose waved from behind it. Rey opened the door for her. The two of them hugged briefly, before pulling back. “Hey Rey!” Rose said, “I hope you had a great summer. I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to respond to your last letter, things got so busy and I just…”</p><p>Rey waved her off. “Don’t worry about it. I had way too much time on my hands, anyway.”</p><p>Rose smiled, before looking anxiously between Rey and Finn. “So, um, would you mind if I sat with you guys? I think Paige went off to find her friends…” </p><p>Well, that was weird. Rey thought that Rose, being Finn’s girlfriend and Rey’s friend, wouldn’t hesitate to sit with them on the train ride in. That’s what they had done the past two summers, anyway. Unless that was what Finn had wanted to talk to her about. She was suddenly very much dreading the ride.</p><p>“Yes, of course, Rose.” She said, not missing a beat. Rose went to sit beside Finn. </p><p>“Hey, Finn.” She said, softly. She picked up the frog beside her, “Hey BB-8,” and gave him a little kiss on his back. “But that means…where’s—”</p><p>Right on cue, Poe came barreling down the aisle. He paused to look into the compartment and his expression shifted. He looked somewhat sour. He walked past the group. </p><p>And turned right back around in a huff. He opened the compartment door. “There you are, BB-8,” he said with a sigh, taking him from Rose’s hands. “I’ve been looking all over for you, buddy.”</p><p>The train sounded, and suddenly they were moving. In a few hours, Rey would be back home. Surrounded by people she loved and people who loved her, in a place where she felt like she belonged. She loved magic. She craved to know more. But first she had to endure the train ride. There was silence in the compartment, as everyone pretended to be interested in various passing scenery. </p><p>Rose spoke up first. “Hey, I’ll…uh…go track down the trolley lady. Anyone want anything?” There were a few mumbled replies, and Rose was off, seeming glad to be out of there.</p><p>As soon as the compartment door had been slammed shut behind her, Rey turned on Finn accusingly. “What is going on?!” She hissed. </p><p>Finn didn’t look her in the eyes. “I, uh, I don’t know?”</p><p>“What do you mean ‘I don’t know’? How do you not know? Did you two break up?”</p><p>Poe’s eyes darted up to Rey, but Finn was still avoiding the question. Now he was fidgeting with his fingers, staring out the window, and looking very much like he was willing himself to disaparate. “Not really?”</p><p>“So what happened? I didn’t know I was coming back to this. No one told me. You guys barely wrote all summer!” She didn’t mean for it to spill out of her, but it was true. They had exchanged a few letters, sure, but not enough for Rey, who had been desperate for communication from the magical world. </p><p>They both looked sheepish at the accusation, starting with the apologies before she waved them off again. “Forget it, I just mean that I missed you. Really, I did. I wasn’t expecting this.”</p><p>Finn sighed, finally turning back from the window. “I didn’t respond to her letters.”</p><p>“You WHAT?” Rey practically screamed. Poe tried to cover his mouth with his hand to contain his laughter but was horribly unsuccessful. It burst out of him. Just at that moment, the door slid open again. Rose had returned with the snacks. She threw them at their respective owners and took her seat. </p><p>Wrappers were unwrapped, and silence once again befell the compartment. It was Rey’s turn to break it: “Bloody hell, I can’t wait to play quidditch again. Haven’t been on a broomstick all summer.”</p><p>The awkwardness was broken immediately. Finally, an even playing field. “Is that really something you want to be saying in front of your captain, Rey?” Poe asked, his head cocked jokingly. </p><p>Rey kicked him, “You’ll still let me on the team, won’t you?”</p><p>They all laughed. “Hey,” Rose chimed in, “no playing favourites! I hear Connix’s gonna try out for Seeker.”</p><p>Finn turned to the conversation, “Connix? No way. I’ve always pegged her for a Keeper, if anything.”</p><p>And the conversation continued until it was time to change into their robes and finally, finally go home.</p><p>*</p><p>They were sitting once again at the Gryffindor table, all anxiously awaiting the feast. Poe and Finn were talking excitedly about some Muggle show that Rey had heard of but never seen, and Rose was in conversation with her sister. The doors to the Great Hall suddenly flew open, and in walked Professor Holdo, accompanied by a line of first years. Well, they were mostly first years. There was one individual, further down the line, who stood out from all the rest with only his height. Rey couldn’t see him very well over all the heads in her way, but the conversation in the Hall certainly just got louder. </p><p>The sorting begun. Rey tuned out, playing around with her cutlery and looking around the Hall at all her classmates. She felt herself starting to miss them, even though they were all right in front of her. But she was already in fifth year. Three more years and she’d have to leave this place. The only place she’d ever really considered home. She forced herself to stop thinking about it, noting that it was still years away and there was no use in worrying. She looked around at all her friends and took a deep breath, feeling grateful that they were all still there with her. </p><p>Her attention was brought back to Professor Holdo’s roll call only when the latter paused. “Our last student just transferred to Hogwarts from Ilvermorny under extenuating circumstances.” She hazarded a look at Headmaster Organa. “I hope you will join me in welcoming him.” She paused again. “Ben Solo,” she called.</p><p>The Great Hall erupted. “Not Ben Solo? THE Ben Solo? Are we talking about the same Ben Solo?” It came out of Finn in a rush. He was looking between the four of them for answers, but they were all staring, open-mouthed. </p><p>“A Skywalker.” Rose breathed. “A Skywalker at Hogwarts!”</p><p>Everyone in the Great Hall was familiar with the rise and fall of Darth Vader, the Jedi gone dark and his son, the Skywalker Legend, who turned him back to the light. His sister, after all, was standing before them. Distantly, Rey registered that everyone had burst into similar discussions. She heard bits of their conversations: “Is that the Headmaster’s son?” and “Wait ‘til I tell my mum about this!” and “D’you think he’s as strong with the force as Luke?”</p><p>Rey was nodding. Or, she thought she was nodding. She was too transfixed on Ben Solo’s dark hair and long legs and those eyes that she could somehow see from across the room. She felt like she had been drugged with a love potion. It wasn’t often that a student transferred from another wizarding school. Actually, Rey had never heard anything of the sort happening. She guessed they made certain exceptions for the son of two war heroes, one of which was the Headmaster.</p><p>Ben, the tallest of all those who had been sorted today, moved out from the group. He didn’t look around or acknowledge all the noise around him. He took his seat by the Sorting Hat and—</p><p>Nothing happened. Nothing happened for a long time. A hush came over the Great Hall. After a few moments, the Sorting Hat finally spoke, “Hmmm.. curious one we have here. A Thunderbird at Ilvermorny but not so easily sorted at Hogwarts…” and there was silence again. “Gryffindor? You’ve a heart of gold, that’s for sure. And passion, too, my is there passion in you.” Rey felt her cheeks turning red. “But your head.” Another pause. Rey could barely take the anticipation. She looked around the Hall to find her other classmates similarly raptured. “Your head yearns for Slytherin. Either way, there’s so much ambition in you, Young Solo.” Ben grimaced at the name. “But you don’t like that name, do you? Hm…”</p><p>Under her breath, Rose said, “A hatstall.” So simply and so entranced by what was happening before them. </p><p>The hat seemed finally to be bored of the situation, after what Rey would guess was nearly seven minutes. “Better be… Slytherin!” It called, and the Slytherin table sounded off in cheers that caused Rey to bring her hands to her ears. </p><p>Ben didn’t seem amused. He left the stool and walked down beside the tables, looking around. Rey felt her head getting dizzy as his eyes locked on hers. </p><p>At first, the pain was so poignant that Rey clutched her head and couldn’t help but let a gasp of pain escape her lips. Finn grasped her arm, looking concerned. “Rey? Are you okay?” She tried to give him a thumbs-up, but he continued to look at her long after the pain had passed. </p><p>Ben Solo was slowly walking toward the Gryffindor table, his eyes locked on Rey and a look of utter bewilderment on his face. Someone from Slytherin spoke up: “Hey, Solo, Slytherin’s over here!” Ben didn’t look embarrassed, exactly. Just annoyed. He turned around with one last glance at Rey and found his seat at the edge of the table. </p><p>Rey tried to offset the strangeness of the situation. “Americans.” She huffed, her eyes finally moving from Ben. </p><p>Headmaster Organa cleared her throat. "I know you’re all eager for the feast after your long journey.” She took out her glasses from her pocked, adjusting them onto her face. “Just one announcement, and an exciting one. Our professors, “ She gestured at the main table, full of professors of all sizes, some ghosts (Professor Yoda was the notorious saviour of the Defence Against the Dark Arts position), and some barely extending tall enough over the table (Professor Maz seemed particularly annoyed with her accommodations). “have worked tirelessly all summer to bring what I’m told is a variation of a Muggle pastime t Hogwarts. This Saturday will be our first game of Capture the Flag in the Forbidden Forest, which has been cleared of all threats for this purpose.” Headmaster Organa spoke over the noise. “This game will be restricted to fifth years and up, and teams will be determined based on houses. The winning house will receive…” Her eyes glittered, clearly enjoying the spectacle. “A prize.”</p><p>The excitement was perhaps moreso than if she had said the prize outright. Murmurs broke out among each table, everyone theorizing about what it may be. Headmaster Organa needed only to raise a hand, and the room silenced. “There will be more rules to follow. All those interested in participating will meet in front of the Forbidden Forest after breakfast on Saturday. Let the feast begin,” she said with a smile.</p>
