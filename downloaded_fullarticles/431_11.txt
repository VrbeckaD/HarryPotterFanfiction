    <p>It was tough to find out that your best mate was a shirt-lifter. It made Ron feel sort of weird when he remembered all those summers filled with rough-housing and jumping starkers into lakes, all those times Ron had looked over and peeked, just peeked, tried to judge who was bigger, who was hairier. When Harry laughed sometimes and his smile was wicked as a girl. When Ron had begged and begged and begged to spend that year in Manchester, and his parents relented and he got it, night after night of he and Harry sharing a room, sometimes laughing so hard over comic books or stolen rags they’d fall asleep in the same bed, and when Ron woke up Harry’s hand was touching his arm, Harry drooling and his glasses gone crooked. No one else could look quite as ridiculous as Harry at his worst.</p><p>So it was just as well that Ron was straight as… Well, as straight as anything could be. And Harry’d looked at him that one time, that one time when he’d asked, just to make sure, and Harry had grinned and laughed and punched him lightly in the ribs, the demented little chuckle Harry had adopted about the same time he’d discovered a fashion sense.</p><p>When they’d discovered a fashion sense – Ron had learned that that was what women wanted these days, not enough to just be… just be a man. Had to be fit as well, and Harry had dragged his feet. ‘But the birds, mate, the birds.’ Dreading dancing. Drink to clear away the fear, but they had to go to clubs, had to wear the tight trousers and the open shirts, had to look good enough to pull - glued to the bar, trying to not to look too desperate. While Harry just looked bored and uncomfortable.</p><p>Just as well the lad was queer. Harry was a magnet to them. They usually only saw Ron as an afterthought.</p><p>Still, it was strange, sometimes. Sort of a relief - I’m not the weird one; Harry is. Harry is different and separate and they only want him, at first, but they can’t have him, want something they can have, and after all he’s not that special, just a ponce like half of London, to hear them tell it. And Hermione, who even though they’d only known her a couple of years now, had insinuated her way into their friendship, even though she was a girl – Hermione would roll her eyes at all his convoluted logic. ‘Of course he’s not any different, Ron.’ With her public school voice and her study grants, though Ron knew she’d gone to state schools, just like them.</p><p>She was probably jealous, anyway. Ron knew Hermione would never admit to fancying anyone, acted like she was above it all, but he saw the way she looked at Harry sometimes. He remembered the one time they’d surprised her in Brighton, and she’d blushed and too-late snatched a picture of that Russian football player off her wall.</p><p>Just as well.</p><p>Strange to think of Harry fancying a bloke. Strange to think of… Strange to think of him doing anything, and Ron’d almost asked that one time, but then he hadn’t. And Harry had seemed to know what he was going to ask, and Harry had blushed and shaken his head.</p><p>Just as well. Ron didn’t want to know… that. It was bad enough when Bill came home, dropping hints at Christmas dinner just to see Mum flush, see the twins and Charlie choke with laughter. And that was before he’d had a French girlfriend.</p><p>Just as well. Harry had looked at him like he was considering, until Harry couldn’t hold it any longer and he chuckled that demented chuckle that made him look like his father, though Ron would never tell him that.</p><p>Mrs Potter (‘Call me Lily’) in her tight clothes, smiling at the boys while she leaned over the breakfast table to serve, looking like somebody’s sister, not a mother of three, while Ron tried not to gape and Harry delved into his morning mush, oblivious.</p><p>Just as well Harry was gay. Even if he was taking the easy way out, never having to deal with women.</p><p>No, Ron didn’t always know what he was, but he knew soft breasts and enticing rears when he saw them, and he knew what made him act like a fool.</p>
