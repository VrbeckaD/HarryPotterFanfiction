    <p>Draco,</p><p>    Last week I learned my son is a homosexual. I suppose I can live with that. I cannot, however, stand to let you destroy the Malfoy name. I agreed that it is appropriate for you to come and finish your education at Hogwarts, but that does not mean that you will not adhere to tradition and produce a rightful heir in our eighteenth year. I know of your infatuation with Potter and I do think that an heir between the Malfoy-Potter bloodlines will bring honor again to our namesake, despite his half blood status.</p><p>      For this reason, as you are reading this letter, my plans are set in motion. Tonight, Harry Potter’s dinner is laced with somnium fertilitatis by a Hogwarts house-elf. Somnium fertilitatis is an ancient potion. Harry Potter will be impregnated by the first person to bed him. He will not be satisfied, or of right mind, until he is with child. </p><p>     Don’t attempt to be noble son. There is no reversal. There is no cure. The Potter boy will have a child. </p><p>     If you want this young man, this is your last chance. Take what you desire. If not, someone else will.</p><p>Bring a new generation of Malfoy’s into this world. I have faith in you.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>Draco looks up from his letter as Harry eats the last bite of his treacle tart. A sense of panic fills the blonde.</p><p>Harry swallows the sweet treat and sits back, relaxing.</p><p>That was his last bite of food, and Draco couldn’t have stopped him if he tried.</p><p>Within moments, Harry’s eyes grow distant. It doesn’t take long for Hermione to notice. She snaps her fingers in Harry’s face. When he finally sees her, he mutters a few words to his friends and stands up in a daze. He exits the great hall.</p><p>A beat later, Draco stands up as well, following Harry. He sincerely hopes somehow the plan didn’t work. </p><p>Harry sways from side to side down the corridor. Draco tracks every movement.</p><p>When finally there are no students around, Draco walks up beside Harry. He wraps an arm around the slender young man, steadying him.</p><p>Harry leans into the embrace.</p><p>“Draco,” Harry breathes into the blonde’s shoulder.</p><p>“Hello Harry. Do you feel alright?” Draco asks.</p><p>Harry lifts his head and locks eyes with the Slytherin. His face grows confused.</p><p>“Draco, I don’t feel normal.” Harry says</p><p>Draco forgets to breathe. </p><p>“What do you feel?” Draco asks.</p><p>“I feel, um-“ Harry said, a red tint coloring his cheeks, “ well, I feel horny”.</p><p>Draco frowns. It would be easy to take advantage of Harry in this state, but he refuses to do that.</p><p>“Harry, something is happening to you and I need you to understand. This is probably the most sober you will be for a while. You need to make a very important decision.”</p><p>Harry giggled, losing his balance slightly. Then, he attempts to straighten his features. </p><p>“Yessssir,” Harry slurs.</p><p>“Harry focus,” Draco says. He claps his hands in the dark haired boys face. Harry tries to concentrate, with some success.</p><p>“Harry, you are under the effects of a very old and dark potion. There is a very real chance that you will be pregnant.”</p><p>Harry beams as if he were the sun himself.</p><p>“A baby! Yes, I want a one soooooooo bad. I’ve always wanted one. A family of my very own! Draco, how wonderful!”</p><p>Harry throws his arms around Draco, hugging him tightly.</p><p>The effects are already starting, clearly.</p><p>“Okay Harry, you can have a baby.”</p><p>Harry squeaks.</p><p>“Now you just have to decide who the father of your baby should be.”</p><p>Harry’s expression grows thoughtful. He rubs his chin.</p><p>Harry snorts and throws his head back in laughter.</p><p>“Well not Ron, Hermione would NOT be pleased about THAT.”</p><p>When Harry’s laughter dies out, he stares at Draco. Harry’s eyes widen.</p><p>“You!” Harry says. He jabs a finger in Draco’s face.</p><p>That is the answer Draco wanted to hear, but still it feel so very wrong.</p><p>“Me?” Draco asks, lifting an eyebrow.</p><p>Harry nods enthusiastically.</p><p>“Yes!” Harry grabs Draco’s cheeks, “You are so bloody gorgeous Draco! I want my baby to look like you! Plus I already crushed on you! Please Draco! Please give me your baby!”</p><p>Draco is a strong young man, but he isn’t that strong.</p><p>He pushes forward, smacking his lips to Harry’s. Their lips move together in rhythm, each second they growimpossibly closer together.</p><p>Harry can hardly stand on his own anymore.</p><p>Draco needs to move them, now.</p><p>Draco half carries Harry into the Slytherin dorms.The other students are still eating in the great hall. They were alone.</p><p>Draco drags him to his bed. Despite no one else in the room, he still casts silencing and privacy charms. When he turns back to face Harry, the drugged boy is blatantly palming his crotch through his trousers and squirming restlessly.</p><p>It is so damn hot.</p><p>Draco kisses Harry again, draping his body lightly on top of the Gryffindor. He makes work of their clothes, spelling them off instantaneously.</p><p>Harry moans at the friction of skin on skin contact.</p><p>“Please,” Harry says, “Draco.”</p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Draco grabs Harry’s cock firmly, working his hand slowly up and down.</p><p>“What do you want?” Draco asks huskily.</p><p>“You,” Harry answers, he squeezes his eyes tight in pleasure, “You and your baby, Our baby Draco! Give me our baby pleeeeeeeease. Give me our baby and we can be a real family. ”</p><p>Draco kisses him again, throwing as much love as he can into it.</p><p>Lips still locked, he lets go of Harry’s leaking member and lets his hand travel even further south. When he finds what he was looking for, Harry yelps in surprise.</p><p>Remembering, Draco accios the lube from his bedside table and into his free hand. He coats  his fingers and goes back to his original mission.</p><p>Harry is making the most delectable noises already, but as Draco pushes two fingers in, Harry lets out a long cry.</p><p>Draco begins pumping his fingers, his own hard cock twitching in interest.</p><p>When Harry is hit in his perfect spot, he stars weeping.</p><p>Alarmed, Draco stops his movements and draws Harry closer, attempting to console him.</p><p>“Sssssh, hey it’s okay. What’s wrong Potter?”</p><p>Harry wails. “You are just playing with me.”</p><p>“No, I’m preparing you.”</p><p>Harry slaps Draco’s biceps.</p><p>“Well stop that. Get inside me!”</p><p>This potion is insane. Is he really going to do this? </p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>Draco lines his leaking cock up to Harry’s twitching hole.</p><p>Harry nods enthusiastically.  </p><p>Draco kisses him lightly on the cheek. </p><p>As he pushes in the tight hole, he can’t hear Harry’s responses anymore.</p><p>All he can hear arehis own thoughts. His thoughts about the life they were creating, together.</p><p>Even as he thrust his hips forward and Harry moaned earnestly, he is still thinking.</p><p>He counts the months until this child will be born. He thinks of their future. </p><p>He snaps forward, his body on a mission.</p><p>Draco keeps thrusting, savoring the feeling of his balls slapping against the skin of Harry’s arse. He grunts with every motion. He reveles in the feeling, the pleasure growing with every movement.</p><p>“Oh, thank you Draco. You are gonna do it! You are gonna make all of my dreams come true!”</p><p>Harry squeezes his hips around Draco in a vice grip. </p><p>Surprised by the sensation, Draco is thrown over the edge. </p><p>With one final thrust, Draco pushes in as deep as possible, shooting ropes of cum in the boy under him, making sure to complete the deed.</p><p>“”Oooooooh!” Harry cries, slamming his head on Draco’s pillow. </p><p>Draco thinks it is safe to wrap him up in his arms, cuddling him.</p><p>Harry rubbed his face.</p><p>“We did it,” Harry said shifting away from the tangle of limbs.</p><p>They really did.</p><p>“Thanks Draco,”  Harry says. He places a peck on his cheek.</p><p>Harry gets up to leave.</p><p>“Harry where are you going?” Draco asks sitting up.</p><p>Harry turns around. “Oh, um, to my dorms.”</p><p>“Naked?” Draco asks.</p><p>Harry looks down at his body and starts giggling. “Whoops.”</p><p>With a flick of his wand, Draco spells Harry’s clothes on. He looks completely normal and not like he had just been shagged thoroughly.</p><p>“Oh, thank you Draco. I must be leaving now. I need to sleeeeeep. Tah tah!” </p><p>Harry skipped out the door. Draco falls back on his sheets, groaning.</p><p>What has he done?</p>
