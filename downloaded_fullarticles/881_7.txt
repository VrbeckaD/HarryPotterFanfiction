  <span>Lena Luthor had always been a reserved child. She preferred reading her older brother’s books on Potions whenever she had ‘free time’ when she wasn’t studying or going to multiple classes just to satisfy her mother. She never had many close friends, just classmates that would team-up just to get Lena to help them with whatever group assignments that they required to do. Sometimes, her classmates would strike up small talk just to somehow direct the conversation into asking Lena to let them copy her homework. She actually let them do just that at first but stopped after realising that she was being taken advantage of.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her brother, Lex, used to be Lena’s role model for the longest time in her life until two years ago he decided to turn to the dark side and became a devoted Death Eater without uttering a single word to her. Just a few days after she spent time with him at Hogsmeade, he disappeared from Hogwarts. The only clue he left was a Death Eater branding burned into the floor of his bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lena stopped believing anyone after that incident.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And now, the time has come to announce the participants of the quinquennial Triwizards Tournament!” Professor McGonagall announces using the amplifying charm echoing through the Great Hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Firstly, Mon-El, from Daxam Institute!” a loud cheer is heard from the students from Daxam next to the table Lena was sitting at. She rolls her eyes at her fellow Slytherin housemates that were clearly smitten with his charming smile as he stood up and bowed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Next, Adalene Chevrolet from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic!” the hall was filled with applause for the fellow Beuxbaton in her blue uniform.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lena Luthor was getting impatient. It was a Monday evening and she was getting bored with the announcements for the Triwizard Tournament that was apparently the hot-topic of the season. All she wanted to do was get back to the library and work on her Potions homework that's due tomorrow morning. Lena finally looked up from the book she was reading under the dining table, A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes by her favourite Muggle author Stephen Hawking when Professor McGonagall announced the Hogwarts Champion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And finally, for our very own Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Kara Danvers!” the hall was instantly overflowed with the applause of students from every table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was when Lena realised the table to the left of her was emitting the most noise that she saw Kara Danvers blushing and smiling widely at the applause her friends were giving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What an idiot.” Lena thought to herself and turned away to continue reading her book.</span>
