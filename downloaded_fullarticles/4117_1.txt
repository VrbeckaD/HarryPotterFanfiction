    <p align="center"><u>Chapter 1</u> </p><p>A moist towel was wiping Harry's forehead when he woke.</p><p>"Ahhh." Hissed Harry in pain. His eyes slowly opening to see a young brunette woman carefully dabbing his stinging brow. Everything seemed blurry. Harry wasn't wearing his glasses. He couldn't recognise where he was, or immediately remember how he had got here.</p><p>"Good. You're awake. Dumbledore will be down soon." The woman said. Harry couldn’t make out her features, but her voice did sound similar.</p><p>"Dumbledore?" Harry questioned feeling disorientated.</p><p>Could the nurse possible mean Aberforth Dumbledore? Harry hadn't seen the hogshead owner in years. Heard he’d long since retired. The stinging on his head began to throb interrupting his train of thought as the woman touched it with her cloth again. Harry looked around confused. He was lying injured in a bed, in what looked like a small Hospital ward. It must be somewhat late in the day for the sun was low in the sky and shone blindingly in Harrys eyes.</p><p>"Yes, Dumbledore? What did you expect, Professor Dibe-"</p><p>"Poppy dear, it seems Hogwarts has an unexpected guest." The doors to the hospital wing swung open as Albus Dumbledore the man himself walked in. "I'm right by saying, Rubeus found him lying naked and unconscious near the forbidden forest?"</p><p>"Yes. Headmaster." The nurse Poppy abandoned treating Harry's forehead, and stood beside the old man whispering quietly to him. Harry sat up slightly. He couldn’t believe his eyes. He could faintly hear a few mumbled sentences confirming Harry to be in fact human, not baring any weapons, nor the dark mark, and not currently effected by any potions in his system.</p><p>"Dumbledore..." Harry mumbled, his foggy mind raced. Dumbledore alive? How? There was no mistaking it. Dumbledore stood alive and well in front of Harry. The room began to spin. Why does his head hurt so much? He began to feel nauseous.</p><p>Harry thought he must have died again, seeing Dumbledore on the 9 3/4 platform wasn't enough apparently. Maybe each time he died he would be visited by those who meant so much to him in his life.</p><p>"Yes, dear boy." The old man replied. Standing beside Harry, curiously looking at him. "Have we met before?"</p><p>“Am I dead?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Not for the time being.” The old man chuckled.</p><p>"And you're not dead?" Harry questioned perplexed.</p><p>"Not yet, but a dear friend once told me. Death is just the next great adventure." Dumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling fondly. "Now, are you going to tell me how and why you broke into my school? Finding yourself injured and naked on Hogwarts grounds?"</p><p>"Hogwarts?" Harry shot up. Looking around, he found the old man to the telling the truth. Harry was lying in the hospital wing at Hogwarts. "Fuck. I'm dead. I’m dead aren't I? That experimental spell backfired, and now I'm dead. It's Kings Cross all over again."</p><p>"If you don't mind me asking, I'm a little confused as to what is going on here."</p><p>"I think we all are, Headmaster." Poppy Pomfrey called as she marched her way through the wing towards Harry. "What is your name?"</p><p>"Harry, Harry Potter."</p><p>"A Potter!" Madam Pomfrey retorted. "I thought James was the last one? Any long lost cousins of the Potters should have come to Hogwarts, surely."</p><p>"As did I. How extraordinary. How-" Dumbledore was cut off by Harry.</p><p>"-James Potter? Wait a minute, hang on. James Potter as in my eldest son. James Potter as in James Sirius Potter born April 13th 2004?"</p><p>The room was met with silence. Both Madam Pomfrey and Dumbledore looked worried. After a few tense moments Harry spoke again as realisation dawned on him.</p><p>"What year is it?" He questioned slowly, letting the words tentatively creep off his tongue.</p><p>"It's the summer of 1977, dear boy." Dumbledore beamed sympathetically. Harry sat completely still as he processed the news. "Poppy fetch some pumpkin juice for Harry here, he seems a little shook."</p><p>Madam Pomfrey marched off. "I feel you are far from home Mr Potter." Dumbledore said, his eyes twinkling kindly.</p><p>"I'm from the future, I mean it is- no- was the present back then. But I didn't mean to be here, it was an accident... Why does my head hurt so much?" Harry tried to get out of bed.</p><p>"You're bleeding, it seems your travels here haven't left you unmarked. Lie back down, Poppy will have my head if she catches you like this." Harry raised his hand to his scalp, feeling the hard shell of a scab forming across his temple. "I must warn you Harry, if what you are telling me is true, and you are from the future. You must not under any circumstance interfere with time. Or I am afraid, the future, your present as you know it will never be the same."</p><p>Harry sat there for a moment thinking. "But Professor what if I stopped him, I could save everyo-"</p><p>"Silence!" Belted Dumbledore, the room seemed to shake with unbridled power. "You must not reveal any details of your future, to anyone. No one can know, you are not of our time line. You are a potential target Harry, dark forces are moving-"</p><p>"Voldemort."</p><p>"He grows more powerful every day. He would be unstoppable if he got to you or your knowledge of what is to come." Dumbledore became very sombre in that moment. Harry nodded, understanding that he couldn't tell a soul. But that doesn't mean he can't help, and push other people in the right direction.</p><p>Fawkes the Phoenix's swooped in through the open window and came to land on Harry's shoulder. "Hey Fawkes, are you here to cry for me?"</p><p>The great red bird gave an almighty squawk leaping from Harrys shoulder to Dumbledore’s. "Fawkes is a Phoenix Harry. He seems rather fond of you."</p><p> "Fawkes has-no wait, will save my life one day. Doesn't quite feel like crying for me today however." Harry said fondly remembering his second year, down in the Chamber of Secrets rescuing Ginny from a 16 year old Tom Riddle. </p><p>Ginny. His wife. His wife who hasn’t been born yet.</p><p>"Funny how a Phoenix can remember an event that is yet to happen, but has happened in one of their many lives... Something the matter?" Dumbledore probed, noticing the change in Harry's demeanour.</p><p>"Nothing. I just realised everything I have is gone. My children... I haven't even been born yet. My job, my life doesn't exist. How can I return home to my own time? I have links with the Minister, but she can't help, she hasn't been born either." </p><p>"I will send an owl to the Ministry, alerting them to your situation. Let's see if they can offer the use of one of those time turners, they recently confiscated. I'm sure we can persuade an unspeakable to lend one. Professor Slughorn still keeps in contact with a few of his old students high up in the ministry." Dumbledore said rather to himself than to the man in the hospital bed. "What is it you do, or did, did you say?"</p><p>"I'm an Auror." Harry replied.</p><p>"That's fortunate. I find myself in need of a new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher. You could say, stay at Hogwarts, safe and protected, and teach whilst your quest to return home continues." Dumbledore smiled.</p><p>"Hogwarts always has been home." Harry mumbled, contemplating teaching. He did teach the DA in 5th year, after Umbridge refused to. Lupin was the best teacher he ever had, maybe he could teach like Lupin did. The idea of being a Hogwarts teacher was always a dream of his. "Okay, sure. Why not? I'm stuck here anyway. Who knows how long it will take to get back to my time."</p><p>"Wondrous, I do recommend you change your name however. As to not arouse suspicion of your true identity, that is." Dumbledore suggested. "We can't have you changing the future, because James or anyone else you know from your time realises who you truly are."</p><p>"You're right. Um, I'll change my name to Professor Smith, no no that's awful... umm... Professor Thomas. Harry Thomas. Has nice ring to it." Harry agreed, he stole the surname from his muggle born friend Dean. In the hope selecting a muggle surname would distance himself from other wizard families.</p><p>"Alright Professor Thomas, Madam Pomfrey will be back soon with Pumpkin Juice I’m sure. Within a few hours she will send a house elf down with you to show you to your sleeping arrangements. The students shall be arriving tomorrow evening I believe."</p><p>Just on cue, the nurse came through the door carrying a pitcher of juice. Fawkes who had fallen asleep on Dumbledore’s shoulder, awoke with a screech. Feathers alive with fire fell and burnt onto the floor.</p><p>"I'm sorry Headmaster, but I must ask you to leave. My patient needs time to heal."</p><p>"Good news Poppy, Harry Thomas here, has accepted the role of our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher." Dumbledore stressed Thomas knowingly.</p><p>"Then Professor Thomas needs to be bandaged up before the students arrive ready for the welcoming feast." Poppy said shooing the old man towards the exit and out of the door. "Ahh good. You've stopped bleeding. I don't know what could have done this, even wounds inflicted by dark magic don't behave this way. None of my healing spells nor any of Horace's potions could heal it... My strongest dittany did nothing... It'll have to be healed naturally, the muggle way. It'll leave an awful scar."</p><p>"I'm used to having a few ugly scars." Harry lay back into the hospital bed. The nurse’s eyes flashed down towards his forearms, piercing her lips disapprovingly. Harry shifted uncomfortably under her gaze. "Do you know where my glasses are?"</p><p>"Glasses? You weren't wearing any when Hagrid found you. I can fix your eye sight, if you like. I've never done it before, but it seems relatively straight forward from what I've read. It's a very painful spell, though mind you."</p><p>"I think I’ll stick with glasses." Harry said nervously.</p><p>"I'll send for an owl to Spectacles &amp; Glassware, I took your measurements whilst you were still unconscious. Only be a minute." Poppy popped into the opposite room. Only to re-emerge a second later.</p><p>"Rubeus found you stark naked, I assume you'll be needing a wand too. The castle's house elves will take your measurements to Diagon Ally and accommodate everything else you have are missing. I'm sure they can take it out of your wages."</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>Harry found himself excitedly walking through an all too familiar Hogwarts, being led by a House elf called Totty. Totty reminded Harry of Dobby the free House elf. It has been many years since Harry allowed himself the liberty of remembering his old sock loving friend.</p><p>She meandered him through many hidden passages around the school ending up in his old Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom's office. With a click of her little wrinkled fingers a hidden door appeared from behind the wall. She bowed low, her large nose touching the floor, as Harry stepped forward. Entering showed a large sitting room. Not as cosy as the Gryffindor common room, but both shared a familiar sense of home, the safe smell of Hogwarts. Totty bowed low once more and bid Professor Thomas a good night, wishing him a happy feast before apparating with a tremendous crack.</p><p>Harry explored his new home for the upcoming school year. A bed chamber to the left with an en suite. A deep mauve coloured, large, four poster bed was located in the centre of the bedroom. To his surprise it was delightfully soft when Harry lay on it. The chambers walls were decorated with bizarre ornaments and findings, diagrams of creatures extinct to the world adorned the walls. In the living room on a shelf high above stood the pickled head of a mermaid floating in green iridescent liquid, which greatly disturbed Harry, as the mermaids eyes were open and looked as though it were watching him. The colourful house tapestries stood proudly hanging on the fireplace. Opposite were a collection of soft looking green arm chairs and a matching black overstuffed love seat. Harry inspected the large bookshelf, hundreds and hundreds of books on magical creatures and dangerous spells stood before him. All different sizes and shapes, varying in age and deterioration. A black leather book was placed alone on a pedestal on the desk, Harry skimmed through turning the pages. Pages and pages of names were signed in the book with a start and a finish date next to the signature. This is a sort of guest book for previous Defence teachers Harry realised. The latest entry was "Aether Caelum Hilbert" 3/8/1976 - 29/8/1977. Harry found a black quill and bottle of ink in one of the draws. He wrote "Harry James P-" but stopped himself, his quill ghosting over the books ancient parchment. He was no longer Harry Potter, but Harry Thomas. He begrudgingly turned the P into a T, and wrote Thomas, but stopped there, as he didn't know the exact date. Only that it was towards the end of summer 1977.</p><p>He skipped to the start of the book. The first name was written in emerald green ink, the lettering beautifully sliding across the page like a snake creating the words: Salazar Slytherin.</p><p>Harry had always assumed the founder of Slytherin would have taught potions, being as both of the schools previous Potions Masters had been head of Slytherin.</p><p>In the toilet Harry admired his reflection in the mirror. His new rectangle glasses made his face look different somehow. More square, his jaw appeared wider, his nose thinner. Madam Pomfrey wouldn't allow him to leave the hospital wing until his new glasses arrived by school owl.</p><p>“I can’t have you falling off a moving staircase, Professor.”</p><p>He knew the healer wouldn't be happy if he removed the newly wrapped bandages around his forehead and scalp. So he kept them in place, having to wait to see the damage the spell has done to him. Ironically Harry looked like Professor Quirrell with the bandages engulfing his head in a turban.</p><p>Quirrell, Lockhart, Lupin, Crouch, Umbridge, and Snape. All will stay in this room in the future. Harry gagged imagining Umbridge removing the decorations of animal skulls and sketches, and replacing them with pink kitten plates and ribbon. Lockhart with adorning pictures of himself. Harry quite liked the eclectic mass of decorations, deciding he wasn’t going to change anything.</p><p>Remus, Barty, and Severus as students should all be arriving at school off the train soon.</p><p>A dark red chair in the bedroom was decked with parcels bought from Diagon Ally. Harry opened the smallest, a thin rectangular box holding inside Harry's new wand. Silver Birch, 13 and a half inches, Phoenix feather. The wand had a heavy, rather flexible feel to it. It didn't react to Harry's magic the same way his old Holly wand did, nor the Elder wand, but Harry enjoyed the feel of the wand between his fingers. Harry wondered why he wasn’t given his original Holly wand he received from Ollivander in his first year.</p><p>Harry quickly opened the rest of the brown parcels, revealing several rolls of parchment, a dozen quills, with several colours of ink, a copper cauldron, and basic potion making ingredients. Harry ran his hands down the new pair of ordinary black wizard robes, grey underwear, black socks, and black shoes. Nothing spectacular, but they would do, until Harry had a chance to buy his own preferences. He banished the parcel wrappings with a flick of his new wand.</p><p>He grabbed the list of students he would teach this year, and scanned his new students. He began planning for the years classes. Several names he hadn't heard of jumped out of him, many more were names he had seen in the war memorial instalment in the Ministry of magic. Thousands died at the hands of Voldemort and his followers, and Harry was determined to make a difference.</p><p align="left"> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
