  <u><strong>RemusÂ </strong> </u>
</p><p>
  <em>It was over... We had won... The enormity of that fact hadn't quite sunk in, everyone too busy riding on the adrenalin high. It was a day that every witch and wizard would remember. A day that everyone in the wizarding world, those present and yet to come, would be told of.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They would know that May 2nd 1981 was the day we defeated the Dark Lord - the day we defeated Voldemort.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The day wasn't without its losses. Everyone lost friends and family, everyone lost someone we knew. The hardest loss, for me, had to be Peter. The entire time, Peter was working for him. Peter was feeding him information about James and Lily! Peter, one of my best friends, turned out to be a traitor. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He deserved to be a rat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Peter was taken to Azkaban. He was to be kept in a cell, a charm stopping him from transforming into his Animagus and escaping. It hurt to know that someone so close to me, someone that had been one of the first to befriend me, could do that. To know that someone so close to me was such a coward! </em>
</p><p>
  <em>But I still had the others.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I still had James and Lily - and little Harry!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I still had Sirius.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I still had the friends that counted and little Harry would grow up with his parents, as well as his Godfather.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Remus, please, you know I wouldn't!" Peter begged, yelling as he was dragged away. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>His voice. The voice of a friend that I had lost. The voice that would haunt me as I thought of all the trust we had placed in him over the years. We were the only ones that treated Peter with kindness, treated him like the person he was. None of that mattered anymore.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Turning my back, I took my first step away from Peter, stumbling towards the friends I could trust. I wasn't going to fall for any more of his lies, I wasn't going to be treated like some gullible idiot! I wouldn't be a doormat. Not when it came to this.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>No, I didn't need Peter. None of us did. We would be better off without him and so would little Harry.</em>
</p><hr/><p>It had only been a week since the battle. The Daily Prophet was still running the story, speaking out about our fallen comrades. They didn't twist the story, they didn't put worse in anyone's mouth. They kept it factual, <em>truthful</em>.</p><p>I was sitting in the kitchen of Lily and James' house, looking through the doorway at Sirius with his Godson. I never would have thought Sirius would be good with kids, if I was being completely honest. I thought he would have no idea how to look after a child, what to do with a child... But, with Harry, he was amazing. He would help feed him, wash him, <em>change </em>him. It was absolutely mindboggling. It made me wonder how he would be with his own kid - come on, if James had a baby, I was sure Sirius would too!</p><p>Honestly, the thought of Sirius having kids was hard to swallow. For years - I wasn't sure when exactly it had started - I had been in love with my best friend. Well, I was sure it was love. Everything Lily would tell me she felt about James would be exactly how I felt about Sirius... Lily was in love with James... Lily was the only one to know, the only one I had told. There were often times when she would try and get me to do something, tried to make me see that it wasn't just me... Obviously, it hadn't worked. But it was fine, I was fine.</p><p>"You're pining again, Remus." Lily giggled, handing me a cup of coffee.</p><p>"I am doing no such thing." I protested, already feeling my face heat up.</p><p>"That is a lie, if ever I heard one!"</p><p>Glaring at her over the rim of the cup, I couldn't keep a small smile off of my face. It couldn't be helped that I was in love with my best friend. Just like it couldn't be helped that I was too much of a chicken to say anything to him. Just like it couldn't be helped that he, more than likely, didn't feel the same. I had resigned myself to that fact years ago.</p><p>Sighing a little to myself, I looked back towards the living room. Sirius had stood up from his perch on the coffee table, little Harry in his arms and walking our way.</p><p>"I think this fussy little sprog wants his mummy." Sirius grinned. "Does he need feeding yet?"</p><p>"Not for another hour." Lily smiled, standing to take her son.</p><p>It was obvious to me that Lily was going to be a good mother. The fact she was able to put up with both James and Sirius was proof of just how much she could handle; she always knew just what to say, even if it didn't seem like it at that moment; she was kind and caring... There were so many things about her that, when you looked at her, you could tell she would be an amazing mother. And she was. Now, don't get me wrong, she wasn't perfect - no one was perfect, especially when it came to raising a child - but she did everything she could and did her best. I think it helped that she had James, Sirius and I to lend a hand whenever she needed.</p><p>I watched as Harry's face broke into this big grin, a little laugh bubbling up from his throat as Lily hugged him to her. I always found it rather funny - though I could see Lily having a child, I was never able to envision James having a child. I always thought he'd stay the massive kid he was. But he had grown up. Only twenty one and he was married, with a kid and mature enough to handle all the responsibilities that came with it. It was...<em>insane</em>. James was a terrific father, something no one would have thought when seeing him at school.</p><p>"Never saw it coming." Sirius chuckled as Lily went to get one of Harry's toys from the other room.</p><p>"Huh?" I hummed, twisting my head to look at him.</p><p>Sirius had, well, let's face it, puberty had been kind to him and his looks were only improving with time. He was well built; his muscles noticeable yet somehow subtle; his dark hair cut off just above the base of his neck, a fringe sweeping to the right and slightly covering his stormy blue-grey eyes; his skin slightly tanned - how he managed that with the British weather, I didn't know! But whilst he looked like a male model, I...<em>didn't</em>.</p><p>"James - getting married, having a kid. I thought for sure you'd be the first of us, Moony." Sirius explained, hooking his arm around my shoulders as he reached for the cup Lily had put on the table for him. "You were always the more mature one. Never thought it would be Prongs!"</p><p>"He's grown up a lot, Pads. I think the war aged him." I told him, trying not to flush from the close proximity. "Believe it or not, you've grown up too."</p><p>"Padfoot? Grown up? Have you lost your mind, mate?" James laughed as he walked into the kitchen and reached for an apple from the fruit bowl, pushing himself up to sit on the counter. "Pads will never grown up, he's like that kid from that muggle story you keep telling Harry."</p><p>No matter how long James and Sirius had been around Lily and I, they never quite seemed to get a handle on every muggle thing we taught them. They knew a lot, believe you me, but there was always one little thing about something or other that they just quite didn't get.</p><p>"You mean Peter Pan?" I asked.</p><p>Just like that the mood dropped, the three of us turning our eyes to the ground and standing in an awkward silence. No one had said anything about Peter, let alone said the name, since we found out he was the traitor. It was like an unspoken rule at first.</p><p>"You both realise we have to talk about it soon." I sighed, slumping further back into my chair.</p><p>"We don't <em>have </em>to." James glared, the anger rising inside him at remembering how his family was almost destroyed.</p><p>"Yes we do. He was our friend since we were all eleven years old. For a decade, he was our friend. We can't just keep quiet about it all."</p><p>But neither of them said anything. Neither of them wanted to reply, neither of them seemed to want to acknowledge it anymore.</p><p>"Well, he wasn't always like that." Lily commented, appearing around the corner with Harry on her hip. "It was only recently, ever since Harry."</p><p>"He was one of the kindest people I had ever met, very trusting." I agreed. "Too bad he was such a coward."</p><p>"It was exactly what my parents would do." Sirius whispered, all traces of joy gone. "He betrayed us, just like they would have done."</p><p>"We trusted him, <em>I </em>trusted him, too look out for Harry." James growled. "He was willing to help murder a baby."</p><p>Just like that, the gates opened. We couldn't stop talking about Peter - what he used to be like, how betrayed we felt, how twisted the whole situation was. I could only speak for myself, but I was sure that talking about it really did make it all a little easier to deal with, now no one was keeping their thoughts to themselves.</p><hr/><p>Making dinner had become a routine of sorts whenever Sirius and I stayed round. Two would always make it, the other two would always wash, dry and put away. Lily and I were usually the ones to do the cooking, which was fine by us, we had fun! And the other two? Well, it would always end in a bubble fight.</p><p>We went for simple that night, deciding to just get a takeaway, saving the mess. We all sat on the floor in the living room, sitting around the coffee table with Harry in between Lily and James. Having a takeaway wasn't something we all indulged in often though, given his way, Sirius would do it every night. It was something we would all treat ourselves with about once a month, if that. That night was definitely a night to treat ourselves.</p><p>We sat around the table, just talking about our time at Hogwarts, just remembering little things that happened there. It was nice to reminisce, something I never thought I'd be able to do after being bitten. I never thought I would have friends, especially not ones that cared about me as much as they did. The three of them didn't treat me differently because I was a werewolf, two of them became Animagi for me! The three of them treated me better than I ever thought I would be treated. They never acted like I was a monster, they trusted me. That was more than I could ever imagine having.</p><p>And I told them as much.</p><p>"Before I met you three, I though Dumbledore telling me I could go to Hogwarts was the best thing that could have happened to me." I told them, smiling slightly. "You're my best friends."</p><p>"And we love you too, Remus." Lily said, kissing my cheek as she hugged me.</p><p>"I can't wait for the day when they rule out that stupid law." James muttered.</p><p>"There are a lot of laws they need to get rid of." Sirius mumbled. "But, first, people need to stop being such bigots."</p><p>"That's a big word for you, Sirius." Lily joked.</p><p>Every time I was with my three best friends, I felt like an eleven year old again. I knew it had only been ten years, not that long yet it felt like a life time, but the war <em>had</em> aged us all. Maybe not physically, but mentally and emotionally, definitely. However, despite that, we could still joke around. We could still act like the teenagers we were only two years before. It was something like a miracle, if I was being honest.</p><p>It was as I thought that that I felt little hands grabbing at my cardigan. Looking down to my right, I found that Harry had crawled away from between Lily and James, grabbing onto the fabric covering my arm and using that and the side of the table to pull himself up. For a while, Harry had been so close to walking - he wanted to, believe me, and he had been so close! But he hadn't yet managed. He would take a few tentative steps holding onto something, he could walk if someone held both of his hands... He was just so close. I thought he would try walking again once he had pulled himself up. But no. Instead, he just stood there, grinning at me and giggling slightly. His smile was infectious, how couldn't be when you could see it shining out of his emerald green eyes, exactly like his mothers? Gently hooking my arms around the little mite, I lifted him up, standing him in my lap facing me, making faces and moving side to side as he laughed. Lily loved to say that I was her favourite out of '<em>us boys</em>'. James liked to say that his son loved me more than him. Sirius said that Harry need sort out his priorities, always throwing in a wink towards me. I think it was simply Harry watched me thinking I was absolutely mad. But I would take what I could get, as long as he wasn't screaming bloody murder!</p><p>It was amazing, I thought, looking at Harry and seeing so much of James in him, but with Lily's eyes. I always found it so extraordinary. We could only hope that Harry adopted the best of Lily and James' traits, leaving the rest behind as he grew up. Lily was hoping that, with three male role models, all of whom had different values and personality traits she wanted for Harry, would help with that. I honestly didn't know what he could get from me, other than understanding that not everyone like me was a killer. That was all I could think he could learn from me. Well, that and the fact that I would always have chocolate if he needed it.</p><p>We would just have to wait until he was older to find that out.</p>
