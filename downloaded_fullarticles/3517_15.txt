    <p>It has been a long day at Brewed Awakening café. 

Serving customers their coffee and/or meals, Remus had been on his feet all day.<br/>
Reaching his apartment exhausted, he unlocked the door and made his way to his bedroom and slept. When Remus woke he went towards his kitchen only to find someone sitting on his couch flicking through the TV channels. This person had long shiny black hair that he sported in a bun with loose strands at the front and Remus was stupefied, he was the most handsome person Remus had ever laid eyes on. Gaining the ability to speak he opened his mouth but the stranger bet him to it,<br/>
“Did you know you have a piece of rug that says ‘Come right on in’ in front of your door?”<br/>
“It it does not say that. It says WELCOME.” Remus said.<br/>
‘Exactly.’<br/>
‘How did you get in?’ Remus asked, placing his coat on the table on the right of the door.<br/>
‘Through the window. What’s your name stranger?’ asked the stranger placing his legs crossed over each other on the small coffee table in front of him.<br/>
‘I’m the one who should be asking. You happen to be a stranger who somehow came through the window of my locked apartment that happens to be on the fifth floor!’ he rambled ‘I’m Remus if you must know. Remus Lupin’.<br/>
“Sirius.”<br/>
Remus felt the need to defend his name. “Hey! I know my name is unusual and I’m basically christened Wolf Wolf but-“he was cut off.<br/>
“No, that’s my name. Sirius Black”<br/>
“Oh” he said. “Well um nice to meet you star boy” Remus sheepishly ran his fingers in his hair, “Hey, uh what are you doing in my apartment?”</p>
