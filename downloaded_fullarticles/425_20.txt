    <p>Dahlia Potter could hardly believe her life was ending like this. What life she had had, anyway. She won a War, vanquished a madman, saved the world- but here she laid, in a pool of her own blood. She had been taken down, felled by a hidden enemy (her ex best friend).</p><p> </p><p>Apparently, Ron had been of the opinion that they would get together after the War. Dahlia had no idea where that idea came from. They had NEVER dated. She had NEVER showed one speck of interest in him, as anything other than a friend.</p><p>Everyone knew Hermione was in love with Ron. Everyone believed he returned her feelings.<br/>
When Ron tried Courting Dahlia after the long War, everyone was shocked.</p><p> </p><p>When Dahlia refused, and brought up Hermione, Ron explained that Hermione and 'her kind' were good for 'practice', but not for marriage. He felt that Dahlia owed it to him to marry him, for all of his help over the years.</p><p>Needless to say, he was thrown out on his arse.</p><p> </p><p>Dahlia, sadly, lost both best friends that day. Hermione refused to speak to Dahlia, ever since Ron asked to Court her, with intent to marry. Dahlia thought this was very unfair.</p><p> </p><p>She had never wanted Ron, and truthfully, had only stayed friends with him because of Hermione.</p><p>She thought he was rude, had no manners to speak of, and was a disloyal friend to boot. He was greedy, jealous, spiteful, and he refused to bathe everyday- She could go on and on. Ron wanting her money, I mean, wanting to marry her, was taken as a direct betrayal. Hermione blamed Dahlia, alone.</p><p> </p><p>Three years later, things were good. She had traveled with Luna for several months. Many men had tried to Court her (Properly and improperly) but she had resisted. She stayed single. Only two other people knew why.</p><p> </p><p>Neville and Luna had become her best friends, and she didn't know what she would do without them. They had supported her during the war, and especially the last few years. When Neville asked why she didn't date, Dahlia tried to explain.</p><p>"I have been attracted to people. I mean, I'm not dead! I just... I feel like forming an attachment, or a..." Dahlia blushed slightly. "physical relationship with someone would be wrong. I feel, I feel... like I am meant for someone in particular. Someone special." Dahlia said, finishing somewhat sheepishly.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh! We have to go to Gringotts! You might be the Mate of a Creature!" Luna said excitedly, bouncing up and down in her seat.</p><p> </p><p>Neville furrowed his brow. "A Creature? What do you mean? Like a werewolf? Like Professor Lupin?" He said, then looked apologetically over at Dahlia. She had taken Remus and Tonks' death hard. She loved spending time with Teddy, though.</p><p> </p><p>"A Werewolf, Vampire, Veela, Siren- there are numerous Creatures that can have human Mates. Usually, it is a Vampire, or Veela. Gringotts has a test. Do you want to go see? That may be why you feel the way you do.  Many Creatures prefer virgin Mates, which explains your lack of desire for a partner." Luna said bluntly. She was excited at the prospect of Dahlia being a Mate.</p><p>Dahlia rolled her eyes, while blushing at Luna's comment. It was true. She had had plenty of offers while traveling. Hell, Wizarding Britain was like an open meat market for her! She was just not interested.</p><p>They had gone for the test, and it was confirmed. Dahlia Potter was the Mate of a Vampire. It didn't give her a name, or any other information about him, just that somewhere out there, she had a Vampire Mate waiting for her.</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, she would never meet him now, it seemed.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p> </p><p>The last three years had not been good to Ron Weasley. He had squandered the cash award that came with his Order of Merlin 2nd Class he had gotten for his part of the War. He had immersed himself in liquor, and women, and when the money ran out, so did they.</p><p>He had tried to join the Auror Corps then, but was denied because he never took his NEWT'S. Imagine! Not letting a War Hero bust up bar fights, because he hadn't sat his Herbology Final! It was madness! A disgrace!</p><p>He was back, living at the Burrow, with no prospects. His brother finally took pity on him, and gave him a job stocking shelves. STOCKING SHELVES! After all he had been through? After all he had done?</p><p>He had found out that Potter was out, being a Socialite. Traveling all over with Loony. Refusing Courtships left, right, and center. Uppity bitch! Thought she was better than everyone. Better than him. </p><p>This was all HER fault!  If he had married her, he would be wealthy beyond imagining. He would have money, power, and respect. He wouldn't be a washed-up has been, stocking shelves, and living with his mother. Well, maybe he could make her pay, and make some money out of it at the same time.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p> </p><p>It had all gone wrong from the start. Seeing Ron, after all this time, Dahlia was on alert, but she really felt that he would never actually hurt her.</p><p>She was walking to an apparition point, after a charity gala for Creature Rights. (Oh the irony!)</p><p> </p><p>The glaring contrast was clear, and made his anger blaze even hotter. Dahlia looked beautiful, and obviously wealthy. She had fully embraced her wealth after the War, and had become something of a fashionista.</p><p>Her dark, riotous curls were in a graceful up do, curls escaping and cascading down her back. Her makeup was done to compliment her almond shaped eyes. Their emerald color putting the jewels around her neck to shame. Her sharp, Aristocratic cheekbones were accentuated nicely,  and her pouty lips were a deep mauve.</p><p>She was clad in a sumptuous, sapphire blue silk gown with a corsetted bodice. It had 3/4 length sleeves, and was almost floor length. Her four inch, Louboutin heels completed the look.</p><p>Conversely, Ron was wearing a worn out pair of Trainers, a pair of torn, dirty jeans, and an obviously hand me down maroon robe. He had a smudge of dirt on his nose, and smelled unwashed.</p><p> </p><p>"What are you doing here, Ron?" Dahlia asked, wand out, but pointed down.</p><p>Ron fumed, his ears turning red. "Oh? So I'm not allowed to breathe the same air as the 'Great Dahlia Potter', am I?" Ron said scathingly. "You seem to forget, who was standing beside you the whole, damn time! You would never have survived without me, you bitch!" Ron said, spittle flying.</p><p> </p><p>Dahlia placed her hands up, placatingly. "Ron, I have NEVER said that you, and Hermione, didn't help. In fact, I sang your praises. It's not my fault that the media didn't print it. You both decided to not talk anymore, not me." Dahlia said, trying to defuse the situation.</p><p>"Why wouldn't you just marry me? Everything would have been perfect." Ron said, crowding close to her.</p><p>Dahlia could smell the alcohol on his fetid breath. It brought back flashbacks of her Uncle. Vernon never beat her when he was sober - you don't hit a girl, not even a freak- but when he was drunk, all bets were off. She still had the scars all along her back, and bottom, from the belt. ( She usually kept them glamoured.)</p><p>While Dahlia struggled in her flashback, Ron grabbed her. 'She had turned into a hot piece of ass!' He thought. She would pay him back, one way or another.</p><p> </p><p>Dahlia started fighting like a Hellcat. She would not go down without a fight! Ron was holding down her wand hand, using his superior strength against her. She punched him with her other hand, but she didn't have much strength behind it, as it was her left hand. She kept struggling, and he twisted her wand arm so hard, she felt it break.</p><p>Ron raised his wand. In his drunken mind, he decided to cut off her dress, instead of disarming her, or tying her up. "Diffendo!" He cried. He tried to use only enough force in his severing charm to cut open her dress, but he put too much power behind it. Dahlia, still struggling, had moved enough  that the trajectory of the spell was changed.</p><p>In other words, he missed her dress, and hit her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Blood, rich and warm spurted out, and Dahlia slid to the ground, clutching her throat. Time seemed to stand still for a fragile moment, as their eyes met in disbelief. And then Dahlia tried to take a breath, and blood flooded her throat. Her eyes bacame panicked, and bubbles of blood escaped her lips. She felt liquid run from her nose, and the smell of blood was cloying.</p><p> </p><p>Ron looked upon what he had wrought, and panicked. He ran away, with her blood on his hands.</p><p>Dahlia lay, drowning in her own blood, in an alley, all alone.</p><p> </p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p> </p><p>ONE WEEK EARLIER</p><p> </p><p>An unearthly, beautiful figure, sat stiffly in a High School cafeteria, somewhere in Alaska. She looked like a pixie. Short in stature, with short, brown hair. Her amber eyes were vacant, far away. The other beautiful, statue like teens, surrounded her protectively.</p><p> </p><p>A gorgeous male, with bronze colored hair was also still. He had his head cocked, like he was listening to something no one else could hear. Suddenly, a look of wonder crossed his face, making him even more breathtaking.</p><p> </p><p>Alice Cullen giggled, coming out of her vision. "Finally, after over three hundred years! Carlisle's Mate is coming!" She said excitedly.</p><p>"WHAT?" A gorgeous girl exclaimed. Rosalie Cullen was model worthy. A blonde bombshell. She was known for her gorgeous looks, and bitchy attitude. Her tall, muscular Mate, Emmett was similarly dumbfounded.</p><p> </p><p>"Really Darling? Can you explain?" Jasper asked. Alice's Mate was a handsome, blonde, Southern Gentleman. He was an empath, and was sensing joy, tinged with sadness.</p><p> </p><p>"Carlisle's Mate is in England. We need to go there. I need to call Carlisle." Alice said, reaching for her phone.</p><p>"Wait!" Rosalie said, coming closer so as not to be overheard. "Is she a Vampire? How do we meet her? We need details!" She whispered harshly.</p><p>Alice's face fell, and she became sad. "No. She is a Witch. She is going to be on the brink of death one week from now. She will die if Carlisle isn't there to turn her. There is nothing we can do to stop it."</p>
