    <p>Acquiring a soulmate was something that happened to mages and could happen at anytime during a mage's life, at any age after they reach the age of 18 years old. It didn't happen to all mages so it wasn't something to be relied when searching for a romantic life partner but when it did happen the individual would find out about their soul mate by experiencing dreams of them. In the dreams the soul mates couldn't touch each other physically but they could talk, see each other and remember each dream quite clearly as though it had happened in the waking world. Both soul mates would receive the dreams no matter where in the world that they lived and the dreams would only stop if one of  them died or once the individuals first met in person.</p><p>Dorian Pavus, at the age of 30 years old, first received his first soulmate dream 3 months before meeting the Inquisitor. His soulmate was a man, much to his intense relief, and was another magic user but lived literally in a completely different world than Dorian. His soulmate was a man named Harry Potter and in Dorian's own opinion Harry was the most beautiful man Dorian had ever met.</p><p>Harry was a 25 year old man with messy black hair, beautiful emerald coloured eyes behind a pair of black , round glasses and on his forehead he had a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt . Harry's right hand was littered with scars of words that were in a language that Dorian didn't understand, but Harry had told him that translated the words said "I must not tell lies". Harry had a slender but slightly muscled body and was of average height.</p><p>Dorian and Harry had both since first experiencing the shared dreams gotten to know each other and both had quickly developed genuine romantic feelings for the other. Dorian told Harry about his world and Harry would tell Dorian about the world that he lived in. They had even promised each other they one day they would figure out a way for the both of them to really be together.</p><p>One day however the dreams stopped completely and Dorian after a whole month of not experiencing the dreams knew that something was very wrong but he simply refused to believe that his soul mate could possibly be dead. He was certain that if Harry had died that he would definitely know …. Harry was his soul mate …He would be able to feel it.</p><p>When Dorian went with the Inquisitor, Cole, Solas, Hawke and the Grey Warden Alistair to Adamant they got sucked into a Fade rift. On this certain trip to the Fade he would learn that Harry was in fact not dead after all.</p><p>5 years after Harry Potter had defeated the dark wizard Lord Voldemort and had helped capture and imprison the remaining Death Eaters ,Harry was trapped in a place called the Fade. He had found himself there after having being forced to enter through the mysterious magical artifact known as the Veil of Death.</p><p>Harry had been betrayed by the wizarding world, the world that he had grown up in. It had been a precaution …. the majority of the wizarding world believed that he was now the most powerful wizard alive and so had turned on him so he wouldn't become the next Dark Lord. There had been no trial and none of his friends had been on his side either. In this Harry was alone.</p><p>No one really knew what would happen to Harry once he would go through the Veil, the Veil was a mysterious magical artifact that the Unspeakables even today had very little knowledge of. All they really knew was that people had disappeared through it to never come back out and that there had been reports of people who had suffered losses hearing strange voices coming from the Veil itself.</p><p>Harry wasn't allowed to keep his wand when he been pushed through the Veil, just like prisoners sent to Azkaban it had been snapped. Harry was left without a way to defend himself from whatever would be waiting inside the Veil and it both angered and scared him.</p><p>Harry felt scared as right after he entered the Veil he turned around to find that the way he had entered had automatically closed up behind him, it had apparently been a one-way entrance and there was now nothing there. Harry was now trapped.</p><p>The wizard fell to his knees, unshed tears in his green eyes as he saw the way he had entered now gone. A mixture of emotions was inside him misery…betrayal …shock …anger…fear…but he pushed them all down so he could focus on trying to find a way out of the situation he now found himself forced in. However even though he thought this he couldn't stop the tears that fell down his cheeks, he had been betrayed by those who he had cared for and betrayed by the world that he had grown up in . He had saved them all from Voldemort and had helped put away the remaining Death Eaters in prison so the war wouldn't be started up again in Voldemort's name and now they had rewarded him with betrayal…. imprisonment in a strange magical artifact that would probably end up getting him killed.</p><p>Silent tears soon turned into sobs of anguish and misery. He had expected nothing less of the majority of the wizarding world …the public had always been so quick to turn on him before …but Ron …Hermione…the Weasleys …. He had trusted them and they had been like family to him. He would have gladly died for them with no regrets if he had to…and yet they hadn't been on his side when he had needed them. It was too much.</p><p>When Harry had stopped crying, he was suddenly aware of some noise …the sounds of growling and hissing reached his ears, it sounded like it was nearby…. somewhere behind him.</p><p>Harry wiped his eyes hurriedly and he looked around him almost desperately for some kind of weapon to use against whatever kind of enemy he would be facing.</p><p>Harry found himself drawn towards a staff and felt his magical core reacting to it.</p><p>The staff was made out of what appeared to be iron and at the end there seemed to be flames coming off of it.</p><p>Harry channeled his magic into the staff and he muttered a simple light spell just to test it out at first, muttering "Lumos" and directing the staff in front of him. Instantly light appeared at the end of the staff replacing the flames for a moment and at seeing that the object could be used for magic an overwhelming feeling of relief flooded his insides.</p><p>He wouldn't be defenseless after all, he could just use this staff as a wand.</p><p>Harry gave a nod of approval to himself and cautiously approached the sounds that he could hear, with something to use to fight with now he could attempt to survive this place he had been forced into. He refused to give up just yet …. he wouldn't! He would survive and find a way out.</p><p>Though Harry didn't know it as it turned out he didn't really feel the need for sleep anymore, a month had passed by. Harry survived with using various spells, different kinds of spells for different kind of enemies, as well as placing protective spells on himself to help avoid attracting the attention of the really dangerous monsters. Thankfully in this place Harry didn't require food or drink to survive…but unfortunately because he didn't sleep anymore, he couldn't dream anymore either.</p><p>No more dreams of Dorian Pavus, his soul mate who lived in another world.</p><p>After a while of being trapped, probably after the first couple of weeks Harry had noticed that his magic had seemed to have changed. There was more power to his magical core …he could feel it, though elemental spells had changed the most it was quite alarming to him. His normal spells still retained the same level of power they had before he had entered the Veil but elemental spells had become overwhelmingly powerful now.</p><p>It seemed that Harry could also perform wandless magic quite effortlessly now as well…. even non-verbal magic was easy to him now . One day he had temporarily lost his staff and without thinking he summoned it to him. It had worked, afterwards he had even tested this out with other different spells without using his staff and each and every time he did so he was successful as well.</p><p>It wasn't just Harry's magic itself that from being inside the Veil affected Harry but Harry himself as well, Harry was now more vigilant than ever before, always looking over his shoulder, always scared and listening carefully for any enemies that might attack. He had also become scared that he would never have the soul mate dreams with Dorian again.</p><p>Harry's appearance had also changed slightly, his clothes were clean from cleaning spells but they were torn. His green eyes, though they had always been a beautiful bright green now seemed to glow brightly whenever he used his magic.</p><p>One day the area in the Fade that Harry was in changed and became a lair for a new monster of a demon, a nightmare demon. This change affected not only Harry's surroundings but the demons and corrupt spirits inside the Fade as well. A short time after that Harry was joined in the Fade by other people who had appeared in it…...Harry wouldn't be alone anymore.</p>
