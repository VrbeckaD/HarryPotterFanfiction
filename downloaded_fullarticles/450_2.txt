    <p>It began like this:</p><p>After that disaster with the Tower of Babel, Harry turned to his companion.</p><p>“I think I’ll like to live some time as a human,” he said.</p><p>His companion cocked its head, “why?”</p><p>Harry gestured to the people they were watching, “do you not think they’re amazing? I had my doubts, initially, when Chuck created them. I did not believe they could compare to the leviathans or the angels, and yet, barely a few centuries since their creation and they’ve already tried to reach heaven. That’s a more momentous feat than any of Chuck’s creatures have done in the past few millennials!”</p><p>“But their attempts were unsuccessful,” his companion reminded him.</p><p>“Yes, Chuck was always the spoilsport, wasn’t he? Even now, when he has disappeared,” Harry sighed, “but I think they’ll overcome the language barrier, sooner or later. And, ah, how I’ll like to be there, among their midst, when they do. Yes, yes I do.”</p><p>His companion did not answer, for it did not yet understand the basis of Harry’s wish. From what it had seen so far, they were impulsive and illogical beings. For a while, the two stood together, content to observe the humans as they shouted, frustrated at the sudden appearance of the different languages.</p><p>Harry broke the silence, “The other day, I saw an angel tear out its grace. Then, it fell.”</p><p>“It became a demon?”</p><p>“No, not a demon. I think it was reborn as a human boy.”</p><p>“How fascinating.”</p><p>“Quite,” Harry agreed, “and, I wondered, if the same would happen to me if I lost my powers.”</p><p>His companion was alarmed, “Master?”</p><p>Harry smiled at it, “I think it would be rather interesting, don’t you agree?”</p><p>“Interesting, maybe, but who would collect the souls of the dead?” His companion questioned.</p><p>“Hmm,” Harry tapped his chin, his ring glinting as he did so, “perhaps…you?”</p><p>His companion seemed shocked at the prospect, although its emotions were always difficult to perceive. Of course, this was not its fault. His creator, being the entity that is Death, had troubles sculpting expressions. There was a reason why Chuck was God, the Giver of life, and Harry was Death, the Taker of life.</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>Harry placed a hand on its shoulder, “you’re my first creation, and I trust you like no other. I will give you my powers, and you will be Death.”</p><p>“What about you?” His companion demanded. “Will you cease to exist?”</p><p>“No, nothing so drastic.” Harry chuckled, appeasing his companion. “If things occur as I suspect they will, I will be reborn as a human.”</p><p>It remained hesitant, “Master, I can’t…”</p><p>Harry’s expression softened, “I am aware this may seem like a great burden, but I assure you it is not. You have seen me reap many times; you yourself have reaped many times. Furthermore, I do not think you will have to bear it for long. Humans die rather quickly, as we have both witnessed. When you reap me after I die, you can return my powers to me, if you wish.”</p><p>His companion mulled over his proposal, “and what if the Apocalypse occurs in your absence? I am not capable of collecting that many souls alone.”</p><p>“Indeed you will not be,” Harry agreed. “To assist you during that time, I will create other companions before I leave.”</p><p>“But…” His companion struggled to devise another counter-argument.</p><p>“If the Apocalypse do occur during my time as a human, I grant you special permission to find me and return my powers to me.” Harry added. “Any other times, however, you must leave me alone to live my own life freely as I will.”</p><p>“That is agreeable,” his companion finally said. It appeared that no amount of persuasion could change its Master’s mind. The entity was incredibly stubborn, after all. It still remember when he and Chuck had argued about the creation of Purgatory, and how the planets came to have craters.</p><p>Harry squeezed his shoulder, “thank you, my friend,” he dropped his arm. “Then, I will go and create your companions. Afterwards, I will give you my powers, and you will be Death.”</p><p>His companion said nothing as he walked away.</p><p>*</p><p>It continued like this:</p><p>Death watched as the human, named Shelah by his Earthly parents, took his last breath. By human standards, he had lived a decent life. Death could only hope that it had been enough to satisfy its Master’s curiosity. It had been a long 433 years as Death, and the being could now understand why its Master was so desperate to escape and be a human instead.</p><p>When the body’s heartbeat finally stopped, Death reached forward, eager to give the powers back to their rightful master and return to being just another companion of Death. Or, as the humans called them now, reapers.</p><p>But its Master’s soul had only exited Shelah’s dead body for a second before it disappeared.</p><p>Death paused, glancing around to check that another reaper hasn’t reaped the soul by mistake. It had given out clear instructions, stating that this soul was its and its alone.</p><p>None. There was nothing that suggested another reaper had been here.</p><p>Death was befuddled, until it suddenly felt its Master’s soul again. But it was no longer here, where the body of Shelah laid. No, it was across the ocean, and…</p><p>It was in the body of another human, this time of a baby girl.</p><p>Death stared at the wailing infant for seven minutes and 54 seconds before understanding dawned.</p><p>Its Master was the original Death, an immortal entity. Like his counterpart God, he could not die. He cannot be reaped.</p><p>He will only be reborn as human. Again and again and again.</p><p>And Death, who has been instructed to not bother its Master while he—she is alive, cannot return her powers to her until the Apocalypse came.</p><p>*</p><p>And it continued like this:</p><p>Henry Winchester was born on July 31<sup>st</sup>, 1981, to one Mary Campbell and John Winchester. When he is brought home from the hospital, he is greeted by his older brother, Dean. Two years later, they will both welcome Sam similarly.</p><p>Six months later, his mother will die, and John will throw away everything to hunt the demon that murdered her.</p><p>Included among the casualties are the childhoods of his three boys, but he will never spare that a single thought.</p><p>And Death will watch, and will count down to the second when Dean will say “yes” to Alastair.</p>
