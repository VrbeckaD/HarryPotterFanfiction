    <p>Draco stared at himself in the mirror after he had finished getting changed. He dusted off his chest, holding down his shirt at the bottom before shoving his hands in his pant pockets.</p>
<p>He wore a long sleeved black turtleneck, with a black suit jacket over the top. These were paired with black jeans that fit his legs snug, and black shoes. </p>
<p>There was a knock on the door and then it slowly opened. “Master Draco,” A voice said. Draco turned around. It was Zoody, the servant. “Your parents are waiting on you to start the drive,” Zoody explained.</p>
<p>“Right, yes,” Draco nodded at himself one more time in the mirror. He grabbed his book bag and phone off his bed. “I’m ready.”</p>
<p>Zoody nodded. He wore beige pants with a thick belt and a loose hanging green shirt with a deep V-neck. His head was buzzed, but the faint hair was a deep brown. He had dull, hazel eyes. Zoody stepped into the room more, opening the door wider for Draco to walk through. The higher class boy did, with a curt nod to his servant.</p>
<p>Draco walked through the Manor and out the front door, down the pristine steps, to the short limo his parents were talking in front of. Zoody was not far behind.  The other servant, Rosmey, stepped out from the other side of the car. </p>
<p>Rosmey looked very similar to Zoody, as they are twins. She wore a brown skirt going to her ankles, and a heavy green shirt tucked into the skirt. She had long brown hair, plaited, and down to the top of her ass. The same, dull hazel eyes as her brother.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Master Draco,” Rosmey greeted. She then turned to Draco’s parents. “Master Lucius, Mistress Narcissa. Young Draco is ready, shall we leave?”</p>
<p>Narcissa looked up to her husband. Lucius wore clothes similar to Draco, yet with more designs of gold on both the shirt and suit jacket, his was also longer. Narcissa wore a white flowy shirt and a long black skirt, with a long jacket matching her husbands. </p>
<p>“Yes, I think we are ready to go,” Lucius nodded his head to the servant.</p>
<p>Rosmey nodded and opened the back door of the limousine. Draco got in first, going to the seat at the back and throwing himself into it. His parents followed into the seat in front of him, with a lot more grace. Rosmey shut the door and hurried to get into the driver's seat, Zoody jumped in the passengers. <br/>Then they were off, heading to the train station. It was only a two hour drive, Draco still dreaded it. He checked his phone and saw he had two snapchats and one text message.</p>
<p>Draco didn’t understand the point of snapchat, or any social media for that point. If you are selling stuff, then sure. He just doesn’t see the appeal of it.</p>
<p>Opening the snapchats, first was Pansy sending ‘streaks’. Draco also didn’t understand streaks, nor did he ever do them, but Pansy always sent him them. The ‘streaks’ photo was of the girl in front of her mirror, sitting on her knees on the ground. The flash was on, so you couldn’t see much, except for her only item of clothing which was her laced black bra and underwear. This made Draco snort.</p>
<p>She had sent another photo after that, which was just of her smiling face, holding up her Slytherin tie. It was captioned ‘5th year, so pumped! Missed you guys so much!’ and a bunch of other words Draco couldn’t be bothered reading. He did not send a snap back.</p>
<p>His other snapchat was a very close up photo of Blaise’s face. The caption for that read ‘are you out of bed rich boy?’</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes at that. He sent a photo back of the farmland he was passing. He captioned it ‘Yes, Blaise, I am out of bed and am on my way. You are also a rich boy, and I wish not to see that much of your face’.</p>
<p>He then checked his text message, it was from Astoria that simply said good morning. Draco chose to ignore that.</p>
<p>He put his phone down and stared out the window, watching as a baby calf nudged it’s big mother.</p>
<p>“Draco, dear,” Narcissa grabbed her sons attention. “How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>Draco merely shrugged. “Like I want to go back to bed,” Was his response.</p>
<p>“So you can laze around like you did all holidays?” Lucius scoffed. “I think not. You were terrible these holidays, I expect better. Especially with everything starting to come together.”</p>
<p>“Yes father,” Draco replied, quietly.</p>
<p>“While your father does have a point,” Narcissa started. “This was your last holidays to relax, and you know that. It’s going to get much busier from now on.”</p>
<p>“I know mother,” Draco sighed. “I will start to participate more.” Narcissa just nodded at him.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>After Draco bid goodbye to his parents, Zoody grabbed his luggage and assisted Draco to his platform. He was early, but the train must have just pulled in.</p>
<p>“Will Master Draco be alright?” Zoody asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, I will be fine,” Draco brushed the servant off and grabbed his stuff, climbing into the train. He found a compartment and got in, stowing his suitcase into the overhead storage. He sat next to the window and waited, as families and teenagers slowly started to fill the platform. </p>
<p>Another year at Hogwarts. He has his friends, Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy and Blaise. He also has his rivalry, Harry Potter, and his group of Gryffindor friends. That, Draco was not looking forward to, but he had his Godfather.</p>
<p>He heard a commotion on the platform and looked. The Weasley twins were laughing while their mother was apologizing to some poor old lady. Draco went to scoff to himself, but the door behind him opened.</p>
<p>Looking behind him, he was glad to only see Blaise. Said boy came and sat next to him, slinging an arm around his shoulders. </p>
<p>“You ignored my snap,” Blaise pouted. “I used a funny filter,”</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes. “That seems very pressing. I am so dearly sorry I did not open your snapchat Blaise,”</p>
<p>“As you should be,” Blaise smiled. “Ready for school?”</p>
<p>“And deal with Potter?” The name was said with venom, as it usually is. “Merlin no,’</p>
<p>This time Blaise rolled his eyes. “Right. How about your other situation?”</p>
<p>“Well, I assume we are having the same sleeping quarters, same people, shared bathroom, so it should be fine. Provided I do make sure people don’t try to strip me nude. It will be fine.”</p>
<p>“Am I still the only one who knows?”</p>
<p>“Yes, apart from my parents.”</p>
<p>“So, it would be easy to spot the traitor if the whole school was to find out,”</p>
<p>“Blaise…”</p>
<p>“I’m kidding! Draco.. It’s a joke. It’s a joke! I’m sorry! Don’t hurt meee, please, stop!!”</p>
<p>“You know to others it sounds like you’re having sex,” A feminine voice chided. Draco halted his hand that went to slap Blaise’s arm again and saw Pansy standing there smugly. “Hello, boys,”</p>
<p>Draco straightened up as Pansy sat across from the two boys. “I think people need to watch better porn.”</p>
<p>“Gasp, Pansy!” Blaise mock gasped. “Our baby said a naughty word!”</p>
<p>“He.. he knows what porn is?” Pansy asked, in faux shock. “I don’t, I can’t believe it. He is soiled, tainted..”</p>
<p>Pansy kept going and Draco just rolled his eyes. </p>
<p>“Pansy,” Blaise interrupted. “We were having sex, you have disturbed our hot passion,”</p>
<p>“Blaise, my friend,” Draco put a hand on his shoulder. “I think you need to watch better porn.”</p>
<p>“I believe this is just going in a circle,” Pansy summed. “Are you insinuating.. The no-no sex Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“The no-no sex….?” Draco shook his head. “Yes?”</p>
<p>“Hey guys,” Crabbe stopped the concerning conversation, Goyle by his side. “How were your holidays?”</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Draco, in annoyance, adjusted his school tie. He had gotten dressed while on the train, as most other students do. The uniform was a white shirt, tie, grey sweater and dark blue dress pants, with black leather shoes. The tie had the colors of whatever schoolhouse they were in. </p>
<p>“Draco, stop fiddling with your tie,” Pansy ordered, slapping the boys hand. He just huffed in response.</p>
<p>The train pulled to a stop and loud chattering was now heard throughout the train. Everyone in Draco’s compartment stood up and started pulling their stuff down from the overhead storage. Draco threw his backpack over his shoulder and held the handle of the suitcase.</p>
<p>Crabbe and Goyle were out first, then Pansy, Blaise, and finally Draco. They walked off the train and over to the horse drawn carriages. They got one between the five, leaving their luggage with Filch and the other helping staff.</p>
<p>“Yay, back to school,” Blaise said in a tone, not excited but not upset. As he was speaking, he gently threw his fists in the air.</p>
<p>“Fantastic, I missed this school so much,” Draco snorted. “Can’t wait to deal with cunts..”</p>
<p>“Merlin Draco!” Pansy gasped. “Such foul language, I cannot comprehend it..”</p>
<p>“I think that’s one of the nicer things he’s said,” Goyle pointed out. Crabbe agreed.</p>
<p>“Yes, well,” Pansy also agreed.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re probably right,” Blaise agreed.</p>
<p>“I am aware that I am an asshole,” Draco smirked.</p>
<p>“Are you..?”</p>
<p> “I don’t care about all of that no..” His eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>“Oh god please don’t.”</p>
<p>“I got nothing to prove..” His smirk grew.</p>
<p>“Stop, stop, stop,”</p>
<p>“But honestly I’m just like you,” He was now full on grinning.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you just quoted Falling In Reverse,” Blaise was disgusted to say the least.<br/>Draco just blew a kiss.</p>
<p>The carriage pulled to a stop and the five jumped out and headed to the great hall. They walked through the old school, Draco still didn’t understand how it was so tall, complicated and still in one piece. </p>
<p>Upon entering, he noticed the Golden Trio already sitting and laughing with all their Gryffindor friends. Draco fake gagged. </p>
<p>They went and sat at the Slytherin table, being greeted by housemates and friends. They all talked as the hall slowly filled up. Dumbledore stood behind the podium and cleared his throat. The chatter quickly died out.</p>
<p>“Welcome back to another year of Hogwarts!” His voice was booming. “I hope everyone had a fantastic holiday, spent good time with their family, but are prepared for the new year! Now, let's get in our new students..”</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick walked in, followed by many first years. They went through the usual process of them being sorted into their houses. Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff. This went on for awhile. Dumbledore then spoke again, telling everyone the Forbidden Forest was as is said, forbidden. He then introduced the new teacher of Visual Arts, Dolores Umbridge. She seemed like a bitch in Draco’s humble opinion.</p>
<p>Then he let the feast begin and everyone took the tops off the delicious meals and filled up their plates.</p>
<p>“What electives did you choose Draco?” Pansy asked curiously. “I chose Food Technology and Ancient History.”</p>
<p>“I’m doing Business and Ancient History,” Draco answered. “Blaise?”</p>
<p>“Computer science and music,” Blaise grinned. “Crabbe?”</p>
<p>“Food Technology and Computer Science,” Crabbe replied. He then nudged Goyle.</p>
<p>Goyle mumbled around his mouthful of food then swallowed. “Food and Music,”</p>
<p>After the feast, most students waited for the first years to get to the dorms before they made their way. Which is exactly what the Slytherin friends did. Once at the dorms, they went their separate ways and got the rooms and beds ready.</p>
<p>Draco was thankful to have Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle as his roommates again.</p>
<p>They stayed up quite late, talking about what they did during the holidays. Then played a game of the assorted jelly bean flavors. There was no name for it, but it was foul.</p>
<p>All in Draco’s words as he spat a vomit flavored bean into Blaise’s lap. The boy screamed in disgust.</p>
<p>Once they went to sleep, Draco waited to hear Crabbe and Goyle’s snores. Once he heard the loud noise fill the room, he felt comfortable to take off his binder.</p>
