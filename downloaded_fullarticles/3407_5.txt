  <em>My daughter Rose is the most beautiful little girl I've ever seen. I love her more than I have ever loved anyone or anything in my entire life.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But she reminds me of the one person I wish to forget more than anything. Her platinum blond hair taunts me when I see her out in the sunlight, her regal nose takes me back in time to when a similar one was always around me, usually poised above a signature smirk, and her grey eyes that sparkle with mischief, so much like his did, only further my torment.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That's okay though, because I love her, and she loves me. And most days that's all I need.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Except some nights. Some nights it's bad. I lie in bed alone and I can't help but wonder why I never told him. Why I never let him pull me back into his arms.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But then I remember. He was engaged. It was wrong. It was dirty.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And I missed it. I missed how he made me feel. I missed him. Some nights I missed him more than others, but the guilt and remorse...it never failed to wrap it's icy fingers around me and make me feel like I couldn't breathe.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But then, just like that, with the rise of the sun, everything would be okay again. I would get up and go about my day as I always did. And only on rare occasions would my mind stray to the man who had given me the greatest and most painful gift of my life. And sometimes I could convince myself that he meant nothing, that he never thought of me, and that I didn't need him to. But most times I couldn't lie to myself and I had to face a truth that I tried my hardest to run from.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And that was, that no matter what we'd had five years ago in Hogwarts, I would never mean anything to him. I never did and I never would.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco Malfoy was, and would always and forever be, my most beautiful nightmare.</em>

</p><p>"Ginny, what am I going to do? He's expecting me to interview them!"</p><p>I was currently sitting in Ginny Potter's living room, completely freaking out.</p><p>You see, I work at a high end law firm called Buxom and Brant Industries, and I'm one of the lead lawyers. The only trouble is that my boss, Kyle, decided that he wanted me to have a partner or assistant or-whatever. I hadn't minded too much, up until the part where I had to be the one to interview them.</p><p>I had argued until I was blue in the face, to no avail. I have entirely too much on my plate to worry about handpicking a bloody assistant, but apparently Kyle wasn't too concerned with that.</p><p>"Mione, it'll be fine. I mean it can't really take up <em>that </em>much of your time." said Ginny, trying to console me.</p><p>I sighed and ran a hand through my hair. "I have a daughter, I have my clients, aside from that you know I'm trying to open my own business."</p><p>"And you can do all that and <em>still </em>interview a few blokes for the position. Besides," she said, pouring me more tea, "You know that Rose is always welcome here. James, Albus, and Lily just <em>adore</em> her."</p><p>At that I smiled. Ginny and Harry's children were like my own. We were always hanging out together, doing family activities, getting together at the Burrow-it was like Rose and I were an extension of their family, and I was eternally thankful for that.</p><p>"I know. Thanks Ginny."</p><p>All of a sudden she got a devilish smile on her face, and she said, "Oh Merlin, can you imagine if you get a complete <em>hunk</em> of a man as your assistant?"</p><p>I rolled my eyes, "On that note-Rosie come on!"</p><p>Ginny only laughed, "You know you'd enjoy it. You need a little passion in your life!"</p><p>"I have plenty of passion for my job and for being a mother." I said indignantly.</p><p>She shook her head, "I mean passion with a <em>guy</em> Mione. Real red hot, make your knees buckle, <em>passion</em>."</p><p>I couldn't help but chuckle, "Shall I leave you alone with your thoughts?"</p><p>At that moment Rose ran up to me and I picked her up, holding her on my hip.</p><p>"Oh whatever Mione, you know I'm right. And when you find the perfect <em>assistant</em>, I'll be right here waiting to say I told you so."</p><p>I just rolled my eyes and apparated home, but I couldn't help but think that maybe, just maybe, Ginny was right.</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>"Father, for the last time, I am <em>not </em>getting back together with Astoria."</p><p>The entire bloody arrangement had been a fucking mistake, and I was done pretending to be in love with a woman I barely spoke two words to before our wedding. The wedding contract bound us for five years, and those five years were up yesterday.</p><p>I would never have gone through with it if it hadn't been for my bastard of a father, that was for sure. All that talk about responsibilities and the family name. I'd let him talk me into giving up the best thing that had ever happened to me.</p><p>Because I'm a <em>fucking idiot.</em></p><p>"Think of what the press will say Draco." said my father, no doubt trying to 'reason' with me.</p><p>"Do you think I give a damn about the press? Do you think I give a damn about <em>any of it</em>?"</p><p>"You're being unreasonable."</p><p>"No, what's unreasonable is expecting me to stay with someone I have absolutely nothing in common with, someone I don't love and never will. <em>That</em>, my dear father, is unreasonable." I said, my anger barely concealed. "Besides, it's already done."</p><p>I'd made sure that the <em>second</em> I could get a divorce, I did.</p><p>"Don't you take that tone with me. I am still your father."</p><p>"Funny how you pick and choose when you want to act like one."</p><p>"Get out of my house and don't you dare come back." he stormed from the room, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>The only thing I could feel was relief. Fucking <em>relief</em> at the fact that I was finally free. Packing the belongings I had, I was quick to get out of there.</p><p>I didn't particularly know where I was going until I ended up in Diagon Alley. I needed a place to stay, and I surely wasn't going to find that anywhere near Malfoy Manor.</p><p>I don't know how long I walked, but I definitely walked <em>out</em> of Diagon Alley, because when I finally looked up I saw a park in the middle of muggle London.</p><p>
  <em>Bloody hell.</em>
</p><p>Great. Just great. This was probably the last place I wanted to be.</p><p>But then I saw her.</p><p>Her curly brown hair, her toffee colored eyes, her bright cheeks, and pink lips...I would recognize Hermione Granger anywhere.</p><p>I'd dreamed about her almost every night, but nothing compared to actually seeing her in real life. She was so much more beautiful than I remembered.</p><p>She was sitting on a bench, watching the kids on the playground with a soft smile on her face. Before I knew what I was doing I was walking up to her.</p><p>"Hermione,"</p><p>She looked up at me, and her eyes grew wide, her mouth open, forming a perfect 'o'.</p><p>Of all the things I could have <em>possibly </em>said, I chose to say, "Hey,"</p><p>She blinked a few times, as if trying to figure out if I was really standing in front of her. I couldn't really believe it either, but I really wanted her to say something, anything.</p><p>"How've you been?" I tried, taking a seat next to her, but not close.</p><p>She looked at me for a few more moments before she turned her attention back to the children on the playground. I couldn't help but wonder if one of them was hers.</p><p>I tried to guess which one it could be. Maybe the little girl with the curly brown hair? Not likely. The redheaded boy? Merlin, please no. The thought of her having a child with Weasely was enough to make me want to vomit.</p><p>Instead I decided to look back at Hermione. Her gaze was still on the playground, but by the look in her eyes I could tell she was conflicted.</p><p>I'd seen that look more than once during our days at Hogwarts.</p><p>I took a deep breath and tried one more time, "Please say something, anything."</p><p>At that she turned to look at me, her toffee gaze holding mine like a vice grip. I could see a whirlwind of emotions cross her face, before she decided on impassive.</p><p>"I'm fine, and how are you? Is Astoria well?"</p><p>Her voice was similar to what I remembered, but it lacked the happiness it usually held, and I couldn't help but believe that part of that was my fault.</p><p>"I'm better now than I was before...as far as Astoria goes, I wouldn't know honestly."</p><p>She raised an eyebrow, "Why wouldn't you know how your wife is?"</p><p>"I divorced her."</p><p>She nodded her head, "Right, the marriage contract lasts for five years. I suppose it's really been that long."</p><p>"You sound surprised." I couldn't help the smirk that flashed across my face. I thought that I saw a slight smile, but it was gone before I could be sure.</p><p>"I am. I never thought you'd leave her. The papers made you both look so...happy." she said the word happy like it burned her.</p><p>"You have to know that I never loved her. I only ever loved-"</p><p>"Don't," she snapped, her eyes holding mine again, "You don't get to come over here and try to make yourself feel better by confessing your mistakes to me. You made your decisions and you have to deal with the consequences."</p><p>"Hermione, I'm <em>sorry</em>. I never meant-"</p><p>"Yes, it's quite obvious you never meant a lot of things."</p><p>Before I knew it she was standing up and scanning the playground. So she did have a kid. I couldn't help the feeling of jealousy of her being with another guy that wasn't me.</p><p>"Hermione, please-"</p><p>"Rose come on. We're leaving."</p><p>What I saw almost made my heart stop. The little girl that ran into Hermione's arms had the same blonde hair I had, and when she looked over at me, I saw <em>my</em> eyes staring back at me. The little girl-Rose-smiled at me, but before I could react Hermione was walking away. Gone with a crowd of people.</p><p>I don't know how long I stood there trying to reason it out in my head. I mean there was no fucking way that she was my daughter.</p><p>Well of course there was a way. Plenty of ways actually.</p><p>
  <em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>The evidence was staring me in the face every time I closed my eyes. Her hair, her eyes, her smile, her freckles...she was the best of Hermione and I.</p><p>She was my daughter.</p>
