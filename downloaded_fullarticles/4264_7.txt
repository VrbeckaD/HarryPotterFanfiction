    <p>Harry Potter watched as Hagrid vanished around the corner as the train pulled out of Kings Cross in London, nine months he wouldn't have to see The Dursley family and he was at a boarding school for <em>wizards</em> as well! He felt a great leap of excitement as he watched the countryside pass him by while the train sped up past the houses outside of London, finally he was free to do what he want! The door of the compartment opened and he looked up to see a blonde haired girl with heterochromia eyes in her Hogwarts uniform without the bulky robe "d'ya mind? Everywhere's full" she said in a distinct American accent "not at all" Harry gestured for her to sit "Jess, you here?" "In 'ere, Mattie!" A black haired boy with an olive skin tone appeared "I got to head up fornt and pay Marcus for that bet, won't be long" he said "alright, Mat" the boy left "who was that?" Harry asked "ma older brother Matt. I'm Jess, by the way. Jess Hardy" "Harry Potter."</p><p>Jess gave a grin that reached up to her green/hazel eyes "Jess, can I ask why..." "Why I've got two different coloured eyes? I was born that way" she said with a shrug "my mom had green eyes while ma Daddy has hazel/brown ones" she grinned "I like you already" Harry smiled, wondering why she wasn't gawking over his scar as the famous 'Boy Who Lived' "I'm not rude and I practically don't care" she answered the look on his face "oh, I thought..." "I ain't like those single-minded morons" Jess smirked as Matt came back "hey, who's your new friend?" He asked "Harry" she said "good to meet you, Matt" he said, nodding at the other eleven year old "same here, kid" Matt sat next to his younger sister "was that a redhead crying earlier, Jess? I swore he said some 'blondie American girl' punched him" Jess snickered "well, he <em>did</em> insult me because I'm American, Mattie" Matt rolled his eyes as a bushy haired brunette joined them "can we sit here?" She asked, a platinum blonde boy behind her "sure" Matt said, gesturing to the seats</p><p> </p>
