    <p>Harry could barely see anything without his glasses, but he could smell the dampness and mildew of the walls, and a combination of other terrible and foul scents, some unidentifiable, but mostly sweat and blood and vomit. He could perceive the dimness of the lights in the room, and it was so very dim, almost black in the pervading blur of his vision. There was a formless blob of something here, at the distant corner, paler than everything else around him.</p><p> </p><p>His hands were chained to the wall beside him, the ropes that previously tied his hands together gone. He could feel his rounded glasses digging into his thigh from the pocket of his trousers. He craved to put them on the bridge of his nose, to finally be able to see, to not feel even more vulnerable and defenseless and panicked than he already felt, but he couldn't. Not yet. They took his wand, but thankfully, they never checked his pockets, for if they did, if they had found his trademark glasses, it might have solidified their presumption that he was indeed Harry Potter, and the longer that could be avoided, the better.</p><p> </p><p>He had no clue why they had brought him here and thrown him into this corner. Bellatrix had demanded all prisoners to be sent down to the basement, except for Harry and Hermione. The Snatchers had spoken among themselves, but Harry hadn't been able to hear what they were saying over Hermione's horrible screams as Bellatrix Crucio'ed her in front of him, hadn't been able to think or focus past his panic and horror at the thought of his best friend underneath that wretched, deranged witch. He remembered vague observations of hearing Greyback's sneering tone, Narcissa sounding desperate and aghast and on the verge of tears for whatever reason, and Lucius appearing gaunt and hollow as if he was fresh out of Azkaban as he eyed him closely.</p><p> </p><p>They had then separated him from his friends, Ron, Luna, Seamus and Griphook locked up in the basement, Hermione left with Bellatrix and tortured. He could only desperately hope that they all somehow make it out alive and safe, and perhaps come find him, because by the looks of it, they had more of a chance to escape their captivity than he did.</p><p> </p><p>That made the despair rise within Harry—he tried to stuff it down. He had to believe that his friends would make it out, that he would too. There wasn't any other choice, because the only other thing left to believe was that they would all be dead, and Voldemort would win and reign over the world.</p><p> </p><p>Harry knew they were still in the room. Greyback and Rowle. He could hear their scuffing of feet up ahead at a distant corner of the suffocatingly small room, hear them hissing words, hear a small, choked noise of fear and pain, which meant somebody else was there with him.</p><p> </p><p>"You're gonna give us a good answer, aren't you, pretty?" Greyback was muttering. "Tell you what, you confirm Harry Potter's identity here, and you get yourself a guaranteed supply of food and water for the week. How does that sound?"</p><p> </p><p>The pale, formless blob was wrenched upright, a high scream of agony and terror tearing out of him (it sounded like a him), and dragged nearer to Harry, by the sounds of scraping and scuffing against the floor. He was making these horrible, anguished sounds, helpless moaning gasps ripping out of him until they left him breathless, and then completely silent by the time the pale blob was right in front of his face. Harry couldn't tell if he had gone quiet or if he just couldn't get in the air to make any more noises.</p><p> </p><p>And then there was one strangled, hitched gasp that went choked-off half-way through, as if he was in too much pain and didn't have enough air to inhale. The answer had turned out to be the latter.</p><p> </p><p>"Is this Harry Potter?" Rowle asked, his voice cold.</p><p> </p><p>Silence.</p><p> </p><p>The blob was shaken violently in front of him, which forced out a cry of pain from him. It seemed to hurt him immensely whenever they moved him in any way. Harry desperately hoped the boy, whoever it was, couldn't recognize him, because if he did and he told them, that meant guaranteed death for Harry here and for his friends at the Manor. As soon as the men discovered who he was, they would press down on the Dark Mark on their forearms and call Voldemort over.</p><p> </p><p>"Answer me!" Rowle hissed.</p><p> </p><p>The boy was breathing hard and fast, panic and pain. "I don't know," he sobbed, and Harry froze to a still at the voice. The boy had sounded far too much like…</p><p> </p><p>No. It couldn't be.</p><p> </p><p>It wouldn't make sense at all.</p><p> </p><p>Harry heard a hard thud, like something colliding with bone, the blurred form jolting as the boy screamed again, breaking into more gasps, now full-out sobbing. Harry's heart pounded hard in his chest, his mind barricaded and scattered with terror, and he couldn't help but remember Hermione screaming like this too, feeling sick as both of them rang together in his head, mingling.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. Or no?" Rowle gritted out.</p><p> </p><p>"P-please. I don't know, please," he cried feebly, incoherent mumble of words that Harry barely would have understood if they weren't so close to each other.</p><p> </p><p>It was Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>It sounded like Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>Why were they hurting him, someone of their own kind? What was the point of this?</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt a conflicted sense of relief that Malfoy didn't know it was him. He was conflicted about it because he was fairly certain Malfoy would have recognized him easily, having spent six years together in a school and too much time glaring into each other's faces back then, but he must have been in too much pain to be able to focus enough on Harry to identify him.</p><p> </p><p>"I-It could be him," Malfoy forced out with haste, thick and feeble and sounding like he was on the verge of passing out, as if trying to compensate by giving a somewhat more solid answer, even though it wasn't solid at all. "B-but I can't—c-can't tell—" He inhaled sharply, trying to gain air. </p><p> </p><p>Malfoy's hazy form then abruptly vanished from his vision, the sound of flesh violently colliding with ground, another high, blood-curdling scream that rattled into Harry's chest.</p><p> </p><p>"Fucking useless you are, aren't you, you stupid little shit?"</p><p> </p><p>There was silence, and then a hard sob that seemed to suck every bit of air out of him at the end of it, and then, barely even audible, "N-no—ple—"</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Crucio!</em>"</p><p> </p><p>The screams went on and on and on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>Harry didn't know how long it lasted. It must have been hours, or so it felt like, but eventually, they left. They finally left, the heavy door closing with a click. The screams were still echoing in his head, and his heart was sick and hammering. The room smelled of bile and sweat.</p><p> </p><p>He kept thinking of all his friends, particularly Hermione after what had just happened, desperately praying to whatever would listen that she was okay and alive, because to imagine anything else made him want to curl up and die right here. He'd already lost too much, Sirius and Hedwig and Mad-Eye and Cedric and Dumbledore, and if he had to lose one of the best people he had ever met, he didn't know what he would do with himself. She along with Ron were one of the biggest reasons he lived and fought, and if she was gone, then one of the biggest reasons he had to fight and live would leave with her too.</p><p> </p><p>No. No, he had to believe she was okay, that Bellatrix left her alive, that they all made it out alive somehow.</p><p> </p><p>Harry quickly reached into his pockets for his glasses, putting them on even though it hurt his swollen and aching face. He wasn't worried about Malfoy seeing him right now, since he was obviously not conscious, but he wanted to check on him. Greyback and Rowle hadn't held back with him at all.</p><p> </p><p>The blur in his vision cleared, everything coming into sharp focus. He could now make out all the clear outlines and edges of all that surrounded him, of the room, small and dank and dimly lit. He could see Malfoy's sprawled form just a few feet away, clad in an oversized, filthy shirt that reached only just above his knobby knees. Harry could see the rise and fall of his narrow ribs, his eyes closed and his face pinched in profound unease, and the knots of anxiety loosened in his chest. Harry breathed, exhaling in relief. Malfoy was alive, even if in terrible shape. Harry could see he was covered in bruises and blood. Beneath him were dried smears of blood too.</p><p> </p><p>Harry could not think why they were keeping him here, why they were doing this to him. Was he not one of them? Perhaps not so willingly anymore, but they didn't really know that, and he was still a Death-Eater. He bore the same Dark Mark that Rowle did, shared the same blood-purist beliefs as Voldemort and his followers did. He had seen punishment at the madman's hands, in the many visions his mental connection with Voldemort provided him, but he had never seen this. </p><p> </p><p>They may have been enemies, once—perhaps not anymore, not really—and Malfoy had several traits and values that Harry despised, his bigotry for one, but Harry did not want this to happen to him, did not want to see him like this, being in so much pain.</p><p> </p><p>It was a very long while after, of trying to think of ways to escape and devising plans that only seemed that they would end in failure and in his identity coming out, that Malfoy awoke, fingers twitching and his head stirring. He didn't move in any other way, however. Harry did not bother to take off his glasses, certain that Malfoy wouldn't be able to see him properly in the corner the way Harry could see him in the dim moonlight through the small window on the wall.</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn't know how long the Stinging Hex would last. He didn't know what would happen when it wore off, or if Malfoy would manage to recognize him before it did. He would surely try to buy leniency and mercy for himself at the hands of his tormentors. </p><p> </p><p>It was wishful thinking to hope he was found and rescued, or that he found his way out, before that could happen. The Stinging Hex would hardly last more than a few hours since it was cast.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy's silver eyes opened to the ceiling, half-mast and heavy-lidded with pain, his sweat-sheened, ashen face slack, his lips parted. Harry watched him come back to his surroundings, something inside him deeply unsettled at the sight of his sickly state. He wanted to say something, but he couldn't risk Malfoy recognizing his voice. </p><p> </p><p>Malfoy retched and gagged, and then wriggled, painstakingly slow even in his franticness to roll over to his side in order to avoid choking on his own vomit, tremors running up and down his body. His eyes rolled into the back of his head as he gagged again, his face crumpling in anguish and malaise as tears streamed down his cheeks. </p><p> </p><p>Nothing came out except a few strings of bile. </p><p> </p><p>Harry thought about crossing the few feet between them, scooting forward to help him turn to his side, but he was too afraid getting so close would end up in him being figured out.</p><p> </p><p>He felt terrible anyway when it occurred to him that he didn't know how long the other boy had been here, and how many times he'd had to do this by himself.</p><p> </p><p>It was silent then. Harry had assumed that was how it would have stayed, but it seemed Malfoy had only been gathering his bearings.</p><p> </p><p>And then he whispered, "Potter?" with a hitched breath, and Harry felt like someone had dunked him in freezing water, the blood in his veins turning to ice. Malfoy had somehow discovered that it was him, and Harry didn't know what it was that gave it away---</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy whispered to him, as if afraid they might be heard, "My—parents. Do you… do you—know anything ab-about—"</p><p> </p><p>"They're well," Harry murmured, almost just as quiet, realizing with a jolt of incredulity that Malfoy had known even before this. It seemed that he might have refused to give him away, but for how long? "I saw them at the Manor, before they brought me here."</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy's face twisted painfully, his lips crumpled downward and parted as if he was about to cry, but no tears or sounds came out. His shoulder slipped slightly against the floor by the force of his emotions, as if he was about to fold over from them but couldn't, a shallow sob torn out of him. </p><p> </p><p>"They—they told me—" Malfoy's face crumpled again, as if the very thought of whatever they had told him hurt him physically. "H-he killed—them. I-I hoped—"</p><p> </p><p>Harry scooted forward, tentative. He wondered if he was about to try and console a boy that was going to turn him over to Voldemort and his followers in the next minute, now that he'd gotten the answer about the welfare of his parents. It was that thought that made him stop half-way through, and then he wondered if he was a terrible person for thinking that he could have withheld that information from Malfoy to ensure his own security of life. </p><p> </p><p>And then he wondered if it even mattered, Malfoy telling them who he was, because the hex was going to wear off soon anyway, and if he wasn't found by the next time they came, which seemed beyond unlikely, then the end-result would be the same.</p><p> </p><p>"They're alive. They're all right," Harry said softly. He remembered their gaunt faces, Malfoy's mother looking frail and ready to break, and his father's hollow and haunted eyes. "They're worried though, of course."</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy's lips quivered, and he bit his bottom lip. He didn't say anything more.</p><p> </p><p>"Why… why are they keeping you here?" Harry didn't know if Malfoy would be able to hold a conversation, or if he would even want to with <em> him </em> given their history, but the question nagged at him. Why hurt another Death-Eater so terribly, the way they would hurt muggles and muggleborns?</p><p> </p><p>The silence went on too long, and Harry began to think no answer would come his way.</p><p> </p><p>"Dumbledore…" Malfoy mumbled. Harry tried to lean a bit closer to hear him better. "I didn't—kill. H-he wondered why. He thought—n-not devoted—so he wanted to… to make...example." Malfoy swallowed and squeezed his eyes shut, drained and breathless as if it was taking more energy than he had to talk. Harry wondered why he bothered to humour him in this way. Perhaps it was because he hadn't had much harmless company in a while. "For those...who may be...disloyal and…disobe—bedient."</p><p> </p><p>That was it, then, the reason they had hurt him so bad that he could hardly move or speak. Malfoy hadn't been able to kill one of the most powerful wizards in history with his own hands, had only not committed murder. Malfoy hadn't been fully loyal and obedient to the deranged wizard, made clear by his reluctance to carry out Voldemort's orders.</p><p> </p><p>"Will you—talk—to me?" Malfoy whispered. </p><p> </p><p>He felt a swell of emotion in his throat, a dull ache in his chest that burned up to his eyes, unsure of why the simple request had provoked such a reaction. Mingling with it was fury, flowing through his veins like his blood was oil, meeting at the deep centre of his chest like a ball of flames. Perhaps it was also the months of being on the run in a forest, the exhaustion and starvation and thirst, and the terror that had made a pit in his gut at the thought of all his friends being—at the thought of them getting hurt, and at the thought of never being found, and the thought of Voldemort winning and millions dying because he had failed, and then this. Malfoy. The sight of his sickly, whitewashed face and body, and the idea that he had been made to believe he was all alone in the world, his family dead, for however long he had been here. All the horrors of the world, the knowledge of how dark and awful it was, accumulating in his mind and into the leaden weight in his chest and pressing into the back of his eyeballs.</p><p> </p><p>It all made his chest raw, too raw and easy to burn, and he couldn't speak for fear that he would lose all control.</p><p> </p><p>"S'just...been...v-very quiet." </p><p> </p><p>In his mind, Harry tried to put him next to the boy he used to be back at Hogwarts. They hardly felt like the same people anymore. There was no hatred or malice in his grey eyes, just the quiver of desperate loneliness and the droop of fatigue and anguish.</p><p> </p><p>Harry swallowed hard, looking down into his hands. He didn't know what to talk about. What did you talk about with your old foe that looked to you in need of distraction from their anguish and loneliness? Right now, all he could think about was his friends, and whether they had escaped captivity at the Manor, and the slow, torturous death that might lay ahead of him. It felt too personal and vulnerable to share.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you going to turn me in?"</p><p> </p><p>"Don't think—I'll have to." Malfoy didn't sound mirthful or sarcastic, only factual. Either way, the answer didn't sound promising.</p><p> </p><p>"If the hex doesn't wear off by then?"</p><p> </p><p>The silence reigned, then. Harry had expected an instant answer along the lines of the affirmative.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, what he received in response was a very surprising and soft, "No."</p><p> </p><p>Harry's brows shot up to his hairline. He couldn't help but ask, "Why not? It'll definitely earn you some favours, if nothing else." And then he wasn't sure if he should have said that, lest he changed Malfoy's mind after all.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy's shoulders twitched slightly, in some feeble shrug. "It ends the same."</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn't entirely know if he understood what that meant. He didn't know if he wanted to.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>***</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>On the day they took him away and brought him here, Draco remembered his father shaking and pale, his mother crying and begging to the Dark Lord to let him take his place. The Dark Lord did not listen. If anything, Draco was fairly certain his parents' mourn and distress encouraged him even more.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't want to remember what happened after that, what happened before they brought him here and threw him in. He could still hear his mother's screams, his father crying silently beside her, crumpled to the floor of their living room.</p><p> </p><p>They told him the next day that his parents were dead, two bolts of green light from the end of the Dark Lord's wand.  He bounced between being suspended in pure and utter disbelief and denial (if he didn't see it, it didn't happen) and the horrible days when he couldn't control his mind, couldn't stop himself from falling for it, from seeing through his own denial because he knew if he let it be true in his mind, it would kill him. </p><p> </p><p>On those days, he had wept so hard he couldn't breathe, even when it had hurt everywhere and he didn't know what to do with it all, but it had hurt so much inside that it almost didn't matter. He had hoped that the day they went too far would come soon, because if his parents weren't out there anyway, then he had nothing to get out to, to go back to. Nothing had mattered then.</p><p> </p><p>They'd have died because of him. It was only fair that he died too, all alone in his misery, all alone in the world. Maybe this way, he could be with them again.</p><p> </p><p>And then they put Potter here, and suddenly he wasn't alone.</p><p> </p><p>And then he told Draco that he hadn't been orphaned at all. He talked to him softly, in a way nobody had for a very long time, when he told him his parents were all right and alive, and he kept talking to him when Draco asked him to, even when their history as well as the nature and dynamic of their relationship demanded that Potter should not give a damn what Draco wanted of him.</p><p> </p><p>"How'd they get—get you?" He hated how airy and frail and sickly his voice came out, nearly a whisper that seemed to spend much of his breaths and require much focus, but Potter always leaned closer where he was to listen, just a few feet away. He could come closer if he wanted to, could come right next to Draco. The length of the shackles around his ankles would have allowed it. But he didn't, and Draco didn't want to dwell on why, even though it was obvious enough.</p><p> </p><p>Potter was silent. Either he was, perhaps, reluctant to answer, or he was contemplating on how to best word his response, or he wasn't going to answer at all.</p><p> </p><p>"It was my stupidity," Potter finally said, sounding more an admittance or a confession than anything, quiet and rueful. "I...I said his name. They found out where we were. We were in the forests, running, and they caught us. The Snatchers. Hermione— she casted his stinging hex on me, to disguise me, before they did." Draco could have worked that out on his own. Granger was the smartest out of all of them, a fact that he had once begrudged and hated. Now, it might be one of the things that would save them all. "They took us to the Malfoy Manor—your home—your mother opened the door. They dragged my friends down to the basement, but they brought me here."</p><p> </p><p>They wanted to keep him separate from his friends, ensure he could never escape in case he did turn out to be Harry Potter. Part of it might have also been because they had hoped to scare Draco into identifying him.</p><p> </p><p>But Draco had had enough time to work it all out, and he realized this: no matter what Draco did, he was going to be in for a world of excruciating pain anyway here. He was already in it, and it was never going to stop. It could only get worse, but never better, and some days, not as worse was preferable, but it was still agony. Whatever he did or didn't do to appease them, they were going to hurt him, if not today, then certainly tomorrow. They were going to Crucio him and they were going light his nerves on fire as he screamed and they were going to hold him in it for hours, and leave him with muscles so cramped and knotted and stiff that he couldn't move without wanting to cry, and they were going to break his bones and put some of them back together if they felt like it, just so it would hurt some more. They were going to starve and dehydrate him and give him the bare minimum to survive, only. And Greyback was never going to stop—</p><p> </p><p>Draco swallowed hard, feeling the lurch of sickness in his gut on top of the ever-pervading nausea already present in his body. Maybe that would stop now, since they wouldn't be alone anymore. He didn't know if that made any difference, but he hoped it did.</p><p> </p><p>And he realized this: Potter was the only hope any of them had.</p><p> </p><p>More than anything, now, Potter was the only hope his parents had. He didn't know if Potter could do anything for him, if he could save Draco (and that was if he would even want to), but he knew he could save his parents. Now that he had learned they were still here, that they were alive, had known what it was like to feel the grief of their loss (even if it hadn't been real) and to feel a world without them, he could not bear to let that loss be real, to let that world be real.</p><p> </p><p>And the only person who could make sure of this was Potter.</p><p> </p><p>He could convince him to. He could beg him to, to ensure his parents walked out of this war alive and free, for him to spare them the lifetime of Azkaban and the Dementor's Kiss in the aftermath. He and Potter had bad history, partially due to fault of his own, but Potter was a bleeding-hearted fool. He would hardly refuse Draco when he was in the state he was in, would he?</p><p> </p><p>Then again, Draco didn't know if his bleeding-hearted foolishness would apply to someone like him, someone who had made Potter's already hellish life even more hellish for years and years, who had bullied his friends based on race and financial status, a Death-Eater whose black-inked Dark Mark was so very visible on his forearm at the moment as a reminder of who he truly was, who had a large part in the murder of Potter's friend and favourite Headmaster of Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore.</p><p> </p><p>The familiar boulders of guilt and remorse weighed down his chest, the shame churning his already nauseated stomach. It was just one more thing that Draco was paying for now, not only in the karmic sense, but in the sense that, perhaps, if Dumbledore hadn't died because of him, if he had gotten Draco and his family to safety, none of this would have happened.</p><p> </p><p>This was a perfect opportunity, even if the circumstances were far from perfect. Draco would never have had a chance before to even get to <em> talk </em> to Potter, let alone convince him to secure anything for his parents, and now he did. He could guarantee liberty and safety for them after the war by Potter, even if what happened to them now was less in Potter's hands and more in the Dark Lord's and their own. Draco briefly considered securing his own freedom and escape, in momentary and overwhelming desperation and desire, and then shot down the thought immediately. Not only would Potter not want to bother, but it would be asking too much of him. </p><p> </p><p>Taking him along would nearly guarantee Potter's death, because the Dark Lord would know where to find Draco. Even without that, he was crippled, his body too ruined now for it to be easy to take him along, for him to be of any help or use or contribution anymore. He would only be a burden, would only slow Potter down at a great risk to his life, even if there would be people coming from the outside to get Potter out. Unlike for Draco, it was a must that Potter left this place alive and unscathed, because too much rested on it, including the fate of his parents. The Dark Lord needed to be destroyed, so that his family could finally be free of him.</p><p> </p><p>If Draco died here, it would hardly matter. </p><p> </p><p>But if Potter died, millions of people died with him. His mother and father, everything that Draco held dear, died with him. </p><p> </p><p>He wasn't even sure if he wanted the life he had waiting for him out there, his body never to be what it once was, never to be functional again in the same way, ever. But even so, the thought of the remaining alternative seemed to suck the air out of him. He swallowed hard. The thought of it was daunting, painful, to die alone in this cell, his body broken, tormented and in anguish and degraded in every way possible, with nothing to remember him or like him for. Nobody outside of his parents would miss him, or know, or care that he was gone.</p><p> </p><p>Draco wished, not for the first time, that he was anyone other than Draco Malfoy, that he had lived a far different life than the one he had lived, had been a far different and better person than the one he had been. </p><p> </p><p>He watched Potter in the very dim light. Potter had gone quiet too, had gotten lost in his own thoughts. He had looked terrible and exhausted when Draco could see him, all hollow-eyed and drained of colour and energy. Draco looked at the green-eyed boy, the silhouette of him in the dark, and wished he could reverse time and start everything over. He would do everything right, and they would be friends, and Potter would teach him how to be good, and he would save him.</p><p> </p><p>Draco could have been good, then, could have been saved, and he could have been undeserving of everything that was happening to him now. Potter would have missed him, and he would have known and cared that he was gone, like he would for everyone else, for anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps none of this would have even happened in the first place. </p><p> </p><p>It was just one more thing he was paying for.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
