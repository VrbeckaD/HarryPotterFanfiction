    <p>James lent his broomstick against the wall, running a hand through his perpetually wild hair. James slipped his glasses onto his face as he pulled his gloves off. James held a letter with too neat handwriting lining the surface, clutched in his hand. </p><p>He read the crumpled letter a few more times, shifting his weight from one leg to another. He carelessly shoved the letter into his pocket, letting out a heavy breath as he walked to the changing rooms. </p><p>Rodolphus Lestrange stood, eyeing James as he approached, noting his quidditch robes were haphazard compared to practice. </p><p>“He’s waiting for you in there” Rodolphus spoke, moving aside just enough for James to slip though before standing in the doorway again, keeping guard. </p><p>Lucius Malfoy stood dressed in a warm emerald green jumper, his cloak hanging neatly from a nearby hook.<br/>
“You got the letter I sent you?” Lucius questioned from his place against the wall as James pulled off his own cloak, hanging it. </p><p>James cleared his throat slightly, his face turning pink as he nodded “You said you wanted to talk. I don’t have long” James spoke up “Sirius is starting to get suspicious about where I go.”</p><p>“We don’t have much time now do we?” Lucius put a hand to James’ chin, locking eyes with him “Do you want what I offered?” He continued</p><p>James made a noise, unable to nod with his chin held by Lucius. “Don’t make me ask for it” he whispered as Lucius’ lips twisted into a smirk </p><p>“But if you want me to…you need to” Lucius continued, not letting go of his chin. </p><p>James tried testing the grip, his want to be stubborn filling him. He locked eyes with Lucius “I want you to fuck me” He spoke, shifting in his grip “Fuck my throat till I can’t speak.” </p><p>Lucius let go, a small red mark left on James chin “You know what to do” he reasoned, Rodolphus still standing guard. Lucius slowly unbuckled his trousers, his large bulge pressing against his tailored pants. </p><p>James slowly knelt down in front of him, his own trousers growing uncomfortably tight as he looked up to Lucius. Lucius reaches down, pulling his hard length from his pants, the tip of his arousal leaking with precum.</p><p>James met his eyes as he gripped Lucius’ length, licking down his hard cock. Lucius let out a moan as James took his balls in his hand. </p><p>Lucius gripped James’ hair tightly as James took his long girth into his mouth, choking slightly as Lucius thrust abruptly into mouth </p><p>“You’ll take me, all of me Potter” Lucius spoke, putting James’ hands on his hips so he could stop Lucius if necessary. “I know you can” he murmured gently.</p><p>He pulled back, giving James a moment to catch his breath. Lucius met his eyes, breathing heavily before he thrust harshly into James’ mouth. </p><p>James gagged as he tried relaxing his throat, obscene noises coming out of his mouth as Lucius thrust faster. Lucius pulled back, pausing as his chest heaved, letting James catch his breath. </p><p>He thrust in lazily for a moment, watching the spit fall from James’ reddened lips. Lucius held James’ head gently, shoving his cock down his throat. James’ throat tightened around Lucius’ cock, his nose nestled in the blonde curls surrounding his dick</p><p>James pushed him back, gasping for air, spit trailing from Lucius’ throbbing dick to his mouth.</p><p>“Such a whore Potter” Lucius spoke, stroking himself quickly “if I had more time, I’d bend you over and take you. Let Rodolphus have a turn” he whispered </p><p>James had his own cock in his hand, stroking quickly along with Lucius. Lucius hissed his release, deliberately decorating James’ face as he did . James let out a gasp as he came, his cum looked below him on the locker room floor. </p><p>Lucius stepped back, lifting James up into a chair. He helped clean him up, kissing him softly. </p><p>“You’re always beautiful with my cock down your throat Potter” he murmured, silently casting a cleansing charm over them. James’ cheeks were pink as he breathed heavily, watching Lucius </p><p>“Next time Rodolphus and I will have you…maybe If you ask nicely Black can join” Lucius whispered in his ear “my little whore” </p><p>James smiled slightly “I’d like that…but Sirius won’t want to” he admitted, his voice hoarse. He  fixes his cloak again, walking out “be more subtle next time Malfoy. You’re going to get me caught” </p><p>He walked past Rodolphus on the way out, winking at him as he left, warmth growing in his belly at the thought of the next time he’d be seeing Lestrange. He took the steps up to Hogwarts two at a time, running to the great hall to find Sirius.</p>
