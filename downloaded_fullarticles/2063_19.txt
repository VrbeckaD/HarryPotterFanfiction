    <p>Sirius Black falls through the Veil—and back into the world.</p><p>Except the world’s gone all strange. Grey like those muggle movies Remus loved, and cold, although not like Azkaban, and…ghostly. He’s the only solid, colourful creature, even though all about him are the Order fighting the Death Eaters, the students Harry brought along and—</p><p><em>Harry!</em> Sirius thinks, desperately, and whirls around.    </p><p>Harry is screaming wildly, Harry is staring at the Veil in horror, Harry is being held back by a Moony with a terrible look on his face, half desolation, half dogged determination, a look Sirius last saw after the McKinnons were murdered and James and Lily said they were going into hiding and Sirius had said terrible things because there’d been a spy and he’d been afraid, and he always said the worst things when he was afraid or angry or both.</p><p>For just a moment, Sirius doesn’t understand. And then he does, when a jet of colourless light bursts through his chest from the end of someone’s wand and it doesn’t affect him at all. As if he, and not the world, has gone ghostly.    </p><p><em>No</em>, he thinks, hollowly. He still has his wand. He lifts it, says, “Lumos," and nothing happens.    </p><p>Worse, for the first time, he notices something lacking that he’d never before noticed was even there, because it had always been there, until now. There is no warmth in himself, or in his wand, no surety that comes from casting a spell and having the magic in him respond.   </p><p>He remembers turning eleven and getting his first real wand, though he’d been casting with a practice wand since he’d been old enough to speak real words. He remembers going through three wands before Ollivander had handed him his, and it had filled him with…rightness in the centre of himself that he’d only found again when he and Prongs and Moony and that bastard Wormtail had become friends, after a horrible six months as the first and only Black in Gryffindor.    </p><p><em>No</em>, thinks Sirius, looking around. Dumbledore appears, and then the Dark Lord, and Harry, Harry, his Harry, his godson…    </p><p><em>It’s not fair</em>, thinks Sirius, a terrible gaping chasm in his chest only so recently pasted over cracking open. <em>I just got out. </em>And for the second time in his life, he’s made to watch the world move on without him. . .</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The worst part, he thinks, is he can’t touch anyone. He is very much a ghost, despite being both invisible and fully colourful and corporeal, if only to himself. So, a ghost. He can walk through anything, and everything can go through him, although he can control it somehow through intent, it seems. If he wants to climb a staircase, he can. If he wants to cross a road, he can. If he wants to sit in a car, he can.    </p><p>But he can’t touch people. And they can’t touch him. And for the first two weeks, that’s the worst part. He follows Harry, although a part of him wants to go to Moony, who is alone the way he’s too often been in his life. He follows Harry because he’d promised James and Lily that he’d look after their kid, and the last time he broke that promise and did what <em>he</em> wanted he ended up in Azkaban for twelve years and Harry ended up with Lily’s awful fucking sister.    </p><p>He follows Harry and watches helpless as his godson, this child who’s gone through too much to be just a kid anymore loses it in the Headmaster’s office, and all Albus does is watch sadly, when he should be—should be—    </p><p>“You do care,” Albus says, as Harry breaks everything he can get his hands on. “You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.”    </p><p><em>Yes</em>, thinks Sirius, who has been bleeding to death with the pain of it for fourteen years now. And also, <em>fuck you, Albus, give him a hug or something. </em></p><p>Because Sirius can’t, can he? He can just stand there and watch as Harry cries and cries and cries. He can just follow along as Harry goes very quiet and ghostly himself, and then watch with a horrible lump in his throat when Harry comes alive with hope at the sight of the ghosts only to go numb again when Nick says he doesn’t think Sirius would choose to linger after death.    </p><p>Sirius doesn’t know if that’s right. It’s not like he was given the choice. And faced with Harry’s grief, he’s not sure he <em>wouldn’t</em> choose to linger, even if the idea of maybe seeing James again, of—but it doesn’t matter. He’s not gone. Not really. He’s <em>here</em>. </p><p>So Sirius stays where he is, following Harry onto the train, into the car with his horrid relatives, and into the tedious little house Tuney Evans seems so inordinately proud of when Sirius thinks its the most boring thing he’s ever seen in his life, and he had Binns as a teacher for seven years.   </p><p>Harry wanders in and wanders up the stairs and wanders into his cramped little bedroom full of broken things and wanders onto the edge of the bed, where he sits. Sirius sits next to him. They don’t move again for hours, until Hedwig hoots softly, apologetically, and Harry stirs himself to release her from her cage and then fall into bed and—apparently—back to sleep. </p><p>Sirius looks at him, reaches out, traces the curve of Harry’s cheek, the line of his glasses that he hadn’t bothered to take off.    </p><p>“I’m so sorry,” he says.   </p><p>Hedwig sidles out of her cage and flies soundlessly over to the headboard of Harry’s bed. She hoots again and Sirius looks up to find her staring straight at him. His heart gives a painful jolt against his ribs. Can she—can she really see him? He waves his hand in front of her face and she darts her head forward to nip at him, startling him into yanking his hand back. She can see him. She can <em>see</em> him.    </p><p><em>Can he— </em>   </p><p>He reaches out a long, trembling finger to stroke the side of her wing, and his hand sinks through her. She ruffles all her feathers and flies off, shooting him an indignant look before winging out the open window, and Sirius stares after her, torn between treacherous hope and despair. </p><p>It’s a familiar feeling. </p>
