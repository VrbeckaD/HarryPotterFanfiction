          <div class="userstuff"><p>It's the 3rd of May 1998, the day after the Battle of Hogwarts and our tale begins with a compliment from a rather squeaky voiced Charms Professor.</p><p>Flitwick approached Sprout and said, "The mandrakes were a smashing idea, Pommy."</p><p>Sprout glanced down at him and smirked. "Told you they would be a hit, didn't I?"</p><p>Flitwick replied, "Sorry that I didn't believe they would work."</p><p>Sprout assured him, "It's alright, Filly. Nobody believed my mandrakes would work."</p><p>Flitwick sighed. "I bet Albus would've been on your side."</p><p>Sprout smiled. "I know that he was smiling down on us when Harry delivered the final blow to Voldemort yesterday."</p><p>Flitwick grinned. "He sure told him who's boss."</p><p>Sprout chuckled. "More like, he sure vaporized him into non-existence."</p><p>Flitwick agreed, "That he did, Pommy."</p><p>Sprout asked, "What was the real reason you approached me, Filly?"</p><p>Flitwick told her, "I wanted to tell you did a good job yesterday."</p><p>Sprout prompted him, "And?"</p><p>Flitwick admitted, "That I love you."</p><p>Sprout gasped. "Wh-What did you just say?"</p><p>Flitwick responded, "I love you, Pomona Sprout."</p><p>Sprout beamed, "I thought you'd never admit it."</p><p>Flitwick inquired, "You knew all this time?"</p><p>Sprout smiled. "I always knew."</p><p>Flitwick whispered, "Lean down."</p><p>Sprout leaned towards Flitwick and he pulled her into an awkward yet spectacular first kiss and neither of them noticed that they were being watched by those nearby.</p></div>
