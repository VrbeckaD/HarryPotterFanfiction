  <em>Mean ol’ moon</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It must be fun</em>
</p><p>
  <em>To shine upon me as I come undone</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Till I'm all alone beneath the sun</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Despite the freezing air that sent chills up your spine, warmth exuded from deep in you and despite the dark of the night, the moon above lit the yard as though it was daytime.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>You mean ol' moon</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With your bean</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You led the way</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And found me love I thought was here to stay</em>
</p><p> </p><p>You didn't dare to look into the crowd out of fear of seeing one person's face because you know that if you saw those eyes, you'd be lost.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Then you went and took my love away</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You mean ol' moon</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Then you feel it. You can't explain it but you know that he's looking. His gaze is infinitely more powerful than the earth's population combined and suddenly, it's as though a hand is clamped around your heart, squeezing tighter and tighter, making your veins tense and your head go fuzzy.</p><p>Without any conscious actions, your body moves as though your limbs are controlled by some cosmic force with strings attached to you. You go through the routine, let the words slip out just how you practiced but you finally lift your eyes. And there he is. Your peripheral vision melts away, nothing mattering besides the grey piercing you and making the hand around your insides twist.</p><p>Vaguely, you're aware that things are happening, that the song is now coming to an end, but time has long since stopped and it has been a century of staring into your lost love's soul. The night air cools your skin and as you hear the muffled sounds of the orchestra coming to a close behind you, the contact is broken. He's disappeared into the sea of faces just as easily as he appeared and your vision and hearing is now returning, but so are the emotions.</p><p>"Fuck," you mutter, and with that, you're gone. Running with no purpose, no destination, no clue of what the hell you are doing (not that you ever do, that's how you ended up feeling this way after all). At some point your heels are lost in the grass but you can't seem to remember when or where but you know the soles of your feet are bleeding because of the twigs covering the floor of the Forbidden Forest, which somehow you had made it into.</p><p>With a crash, you're laying on your back in the middle of a clearing. <em>I must've tripped</em>, you think. Through the branches providing a canopy over the forest the moon is glaring, unnaturally bright and terrifying.</p><p>You rest, your lungs gasping for a break from the aimless sprinting. Soon, your eyelids drop, and sleep captures you.</p><p> </p>
