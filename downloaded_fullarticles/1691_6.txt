    <p>Samuel Johnathon Winchester met Newt Scamander for the first time in the Subway; to say this meeting was uneventful would be to say the sun revolved around the earth, inaccurate but some will continue to claim it was. Sam had had what some would call a terrible upbringing and others would call the worst fucking luck; the latter was mostly from his brother and the one good thing in his life. </p><p>Newt had seen an obscurus before and knew two things, the host generally dies before the age of ten and that those with an obscurus lived shitty lives. Maybe not phrased that way per se, but it was true nonetheless. However, the thing about having a shitty life, is there wasn’t specific rules or a checklist to say it was bad; it wasn’t for others to determine, if the individual felt they grew up in a crap situation and felt fear, anger, or hurt, no one could claim it was not true. No matter how others may have it, pain is not relative, pain is not comparable, and no one can claim it does not exist, everyone’s feelings are legitimate in their own right. Therefore, just because Sam’s life could have been worse, does not mean he did not receive a shitty deal when he was born. </p><p>The Winchesters were relatively normal people, well it was at least assumed so. John and Mary Winchester had met and fallen in love regardless of what her family had thought, she married John and bore two children, Dean and Samuel Winchester. Six months after Samuel was born; however, John who had found out about the true nature of his wife, a witch, ensured that she would not taint his children. He had wished to teach his children the horror of witchcraft and what should happen to those who perform it, by forcing his four year old son to watch as he stabbed and burned his ever beautiful wife in Samuel’s nursery. He had informed his child that his mother was a witch and that all witches deserved to burn especially those deceitful ones, like Mary. He had him stay as his mother screamed and burned, until he was satisfied, then he handed the four year old his younger brother and ordered him to take him outside as fast as he could. John Winchester was not a nice man. His fear of those different from him, those more powerful than him, led to the loss of everything he had once loved. The loss of his wife, whom he murdered, and his sons who grew to hate him. Unfortunately, the Winchesters were relatively normal people, well at least it was assumed so.</p><p>Therefore, there was no room for witchcraft in the Winchester household.</p>
