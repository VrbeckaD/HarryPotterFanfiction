    <p>I DO NOT OWN ANY HARRY POTTER CHARACTORS AND MAKE NO MONEY FOR THE WRITING OF MY STORIES.<br/>
.<br/>
Chosen Mate</p><p>~Chapter 1</p><p>Deep within the forest of Dean, a very agitated Hermione Granger, sat and listened to her two best mates playfully argue over a game of wizards chess.<br/>
Hermione was experiencing some extreme irritability: though she had finished her cycle 2 days ago, Harry and Ron just seem to push all her buttons at the moment. (and not the good ones!)</p><p>"Ah." She let out a soft long suffering sigh it was time to put some distance between herself and all of this testosterone, before she tied them to a tree and pulled out their hair one strand at a time just for fun, until they were bald!</p><p>Ok! So she was a little stressed.</p><p>Ronald's utter lack of manners, and no understanding of one's personal space. (a.k.a her own!) Was about to get his ear hexed off! It completely annoyed her that he thought he needed to practically sit in her lap or he wasn't close enough, and to be quite honest she didn't care for him in 'that' way: he just wasn't taking her non to subtle hints.</p><p>Harry, on the other hand, was taking roll of protector to new heights.</p><p>Oh, he noticed her annoyance at Ron alright, and made sure to put himself between them; so that Ron wasn't so close to her, which only served to put Harry in the same position that Ron could no longer fill. The poor idiots wouldn't let her out of their sights. It had gotten so bad, that he insisted on standing watch when she needed a bush for personal bodily functions, standing with his back to her. She had to literary shoot him with a mild stinging hex to get her point across, that he was crossing the line. Reluctantly, he gave her a little more breathing room and stood guard at a slightly further distance.</p><p>Harry also insisted that she bathe inside the tent instead of in the river when the weather permitted, as both he and Ron did. That way they could guard her more thoroughly.<br/>
As exasperating as they were, they had her best interest at heart. </p><p>She knew this, still, she needed some breathing room.</p><p> The two wizards were enjoying the warmth of the late fall day, good naturedly arguing over their game of wizards' chess as Harry's piece destroyed one of Ronald's unexpectedly. Hermione took this as her chance for that much needed fresh air away from them, alone for just a little while for her own sanity. Therefore, she took the opportunity to slip away.</p><p>~X~</p><p>"I'm going for a walk." Hermione announced to the grinning wizards, as yet again, one of the chess pieces smashed into its opponent.</p><p>Harry glanced up at her, pushing his glasses up his nose a little from where they had slid down.</p><p>"Don't go far, yeah?"</p><p>Poor Harry had become quite paranoid about her safety and would go into panic attacks if he could not find her within the first five minutes of searching. Running, screaming for her until she finally had to stun him so he could hold still long enough to realize she was close by the whole time.</p><p>With a sigh, she answered her friend. "I won't go far Harry." She smiled a bit to take the sting out of her tone.</p><p>He smiled in reply as he waved her away.</p><p>Relieved, Hermione started down the hill between the many rolls of trees; just trying to find a spot to relax without her companions.<br/>
Leaning against the a tree, looking out at the river, Hermione let her thoughts wonder to nothing in particular, when the raised voice of Ron floated down to her and she caught part of his conversation.</p><p>"…bloody wanker! Dark Lord my smelly a… Voldemort… "Hermione gasped.</p><p>"No!" She shrieked as she raced toward Harry and Ron. However, she was too late. Ron had already said his name. The name of the dreaded Dark Lord. Voldemort!</p><p>Voldemort himself had created a spell to alert the snatchers, whenever a so-called brave soul would utter his name, allowing the snatchers to trace the poor witches and wizards who had mentioned it.</p><p>Hermione raced into the clearing where their tent was pitched, just as the pop of apparition sounded all around the glade.</p><p>Hermione whirled around quickly, drawing her wand as Harry and Ron leapt to their feet. She cast a frantic look at her best mates before she made a quick decision. It was far better to run than to stay and fight.</p><p>@@@@@@@@</p><p>"Run!" She screeched and all three took off in separate directions.</p><p>Panic caused adrenaline to scorch itself almost painfully through Hermione's veins.<br/>
Run, run, run! Was the only thoughts that filled her frantic mind as she tried to escape the snatcher, breathlessly she ran for her life, lungs aching, and muscles burning with the over-exertion and need for rest.</p><p>But, she did not dare stop.</p><p>She could hear the desperate shouts and curses fly hitting branches as they missed their targets.</p><p>Curses flew by one after another, singeing her hair, grazing her skin, and clothes. </p><p>Wordlessly, she cast hexes and curses over her shoulder; breath to precious to waste on speaking, as she dodged trees zig zagging through the forest trying to escape her pursuers.<br/>
Slowly, her pursuers were disappearing, heading for the louder noises of the others as young wizards put up more of a fight. However, they had not forgotten her completely.<br/>
Harry and Ron had separated when the snatchers started popping up everywhere. By the shouts, Ron had been captured and the pursuit for Harry continued, as well as her own. Luckily, Hermione had scouted the area while hunting for food the day before, not far up ahead, lay a huge ravine just wide enough that she should be able to make the jump in her animagus form.</p><p>The next problem was finding enough time to shift forms in order to make the jump.<br/>
If I can make it to the thorn thicket, I can make it to the big oak that would give me enough time to make the change. Hermione thought to herself.<br/>
The thicket was harsh, but there was a small hidden tunnel through it, low on the ground that was too small for a man's large frame but just big enough for Hermione's small one to get through. </p><p>Quickly, she turned and called "Inferno!" a line of fire erupted from the grown between herself and her pursuers.</p><p>Hoping to cover her tracks, better Hermione cast a fog charm.<br/>
"Fogosas." Thick billowy smoke shoots from the end of her wand and obscures her further from the enemies view.</p><p>Like a mouse in a cornfield, Hermione tore through the hidden tunnel of the thicket as quickly as possible. The thorns scratched her skin and pulled her hair from its place in the ponytail on her head, but there was no time to stop, so she ignored the pain and carried on. Surely, if she was captured, she would endure much worse pain than this. </p><p>A frightening thought indeed.</p><p>Clearing the other side of the thicket, she hunkered low until her body was hidden by the big tree, an oak tree that stood bigger and rounder than an oil drum. Concentration was hard to come by, with the noise of her followers nearby getting closer. Panic started to set in, but at last, she managed to shift with only seconds to spare.</p><p>Where once stood Hermione Granger, now in her place stood a small chocolate brown wolf. With a huff, she headed for the ravine at top speed, leaving the sounds of footfalls behind as she sprinted forward for the jump.</p><p>Just in sight of the ravine, she readied for the leap that would hopefully save her life. Her only hope was that her friends fared as well as her. If not, she would simply round up a rescue squad. Hermione's muscles bunched up and prepared for the spring. She glided through the air like an eagle across, with agility and grace. She landed just shy of the edge of the cliff face, the ground breaking off under the force of her hind parts; she hustled forward, then looked back at the great accomplishment.</p><p>No, I would have never made that jump on two legs. She thought, as she took in the great gap between where she now stood and where she had been.<br/>
That is when a howl broke the quiet, the sound made her blood run cold: a werewolf. Hermione had not counted on her pursuer being anything other than wizard or witch. In this form, she could distinguish the difference between that of a wolf and that of a werewolf. She could feel the magic on the air. Magic that allowed humans to take beast form. The sound rang in her ears, the magic caused her to tremble, and her animagus instincts told her to run; the hunt was still on and the predator was much greater than a simple wizard with a wand.</p><p>No!</p><p>The wolf's footfalls could be heard even from across the ravine from where Hermione stood, she knew without a doubt that it was coming for her.</p><p>Bloody hell!</p><p>Like a bow shot from an arrow, she took off into the rapidly darkening forest still on four legs, hoping it would give her enough speed to escape the creature of the night.</p><p>A second howl rung out: it was much closer now. Hermione could tell the wolf was alone. She hoped that would raise her odds of escape. However, animal instincts told her she was in big trouble. This wolf was not only male, but also huge and powerful, both magically and other wise. Her two sides warred with one another. Human instincts told her to run, animal instinct told her, the Alpha was calling and she had better not upset him.<br/>
Bloody hell!</p><p>I do not have an Alpha I am a bloody animagus for Merlin's sake! She thought.</p><p>Yelp!</p><p>While Hermione was scolding herself, she failed to pay attention to where she was going. Therefore, she suddenly found herself boxed in on three sides, by a sheer rock cliff. Whipping herself around, putting her back toward the cliff, she tensed, waiting for her captor to show himself. She did not have to wait long and her hackles rose in response to his presences.</p><p>A twig snapped and Hermione focused her eyes on the biggest Mother of all beasts. She was not sure whether to growl or whimper she chose the former. This thing was huge, a dark brown almost black wolf that made her already small size look like a tame kitten. His very presence demanded her submission, which right about now seemed like a good idea. Hermione wanted nothing more than to just wanted lay down, put her paws over her eyes and whimper, pretending that maybe if she could not see him, then just maybe he could not see her either.</p><p>Fat bloody chance!</p><p>Shaking her head to dispel the thoughts of both instincts, trying to run ramped inside her, she growled again in warning, letting him know not to come any closer. He returned the growl with one of his own, that clearly stated not to mess with him or her behind was going to be his.</p><p>I do not think I like the thought of that! I believe he means it quite literally.</p><p>Not being able to help herself she cowered slightly, but tried to remain firm.</p><p>I am not a werewolf I should not have to obey this creep.</p><p>The wolf smirked internally, at the sight of the female trying not to cower before him, for they all did eventually.<br/>
Right before her eyes, the dark wolf's form changed into that of man, who looked no older than his late twenties, with no shirt, and a tan well-muscled body, without an inch of fat anywhere. His dark brown hair was in a long braid that reached the middle of his back, he had a strong nose and set jaw, sharp but clearly beautiful features, and arms nearly as big around as a small melon. He stood at her estimation of about a head taller than her 5' 4 inches; tight jeans frayed at the bottom, covering up his boots.<br/>
The man watched Hermione closely for a moment, standing tall and firm, looming over her to prove he was in charge, and she fought her instincts not to lie down on her furry little belly with her rump in the air and tail between her legs. She did her best impression of rolling her shoulders as best she could in this form, her hackles rose and she growled baring her teeth as the stranger still dared to approach her.</p><p>He merely smirked, seeming pleased at her defensiveness and walked closer still, clearly unfazed by the warnings. -For what could a mere pup do to him other than have a little roll in the dirt, if she was lucky?</p><p>"Quiet, pup." He demanded, and to Hermione's horror, her stupid body listened and shut up… at least for a moment. Regaining control of her body, she growled again, he was almost within arm's reach, and poor Hermione was backed into a corner. She stood a better chance of fighting in her wolf form, so therefore, she did not try to shift. A wolf form was stronger, faster, and she needed to get away.</p><p>The large man let out a loud snarl at her, a sound that should not have come from a human body, causing her to yelp, dropping to her belly tail tucked firmly between her legs. That was one of the scariest sounds she had ever had directed at her in her entire life!</p><p>When he stooped down and reached a hand out toward her, she growled and snapped her teeth at him, wiggling forward, belly still on the ground, showing the submission he wanted even though she was acting feisty. After all, a little spunk kept things interesting, and his little Poppet seemed to be very interesting so far, showing more defiance than most females would in his presence.</p><p>He was not deterred to say the least, he growled warningly, and Hermione's human instincts fled. Suddenly, she was overwhelmed by only those instincts of her wolf. Instantly, her body hunkered down the rest of the way, her head on her paws whimpering lowly. Whoever this man was, he held great power over her wolf form. He laid his hand firmly, but gently on her muzzle, keeping eye contact, daring her to make a move to harm him, promising to make her pay if she did.</p><p>Hermione's nostrils flared taking in the alpha's scent. His hand was warm, he smelled of the forest, clean and fresh…ok, and a little wet. He let his hand run up her nose to her ears as he petted her head, scratching behind her ears in just the right spot: making her whimper a little and lean her head into his touch. She had never been petted before and it was heavenly. Then, he ran his hand further down her back clenching fur and skin in his grasp as he went, it was not painful, and Hermione had to clench her teeth together to resist the<br/>
urge to stretch out and roll her belly up into the air under his ministrations. Her muscles twitched and bunched with anticipation as he petted along her body.</p><p>"Such a pretty pup you are." He stated, and she whimpered.</p><p>"Now change back." He ordered his voice was low but firm.</p><p>Hermione's body chose that moment to betray her, yet again, and obeyed the alpha wolf's command, changing back to her original form on two legs.</p><p>Fear gripped her very soul at being so vulnerable. She lay on the ground in a humped up position, visibly shaking from both cold and fright; afraid to move a muscle as this man hovered over her, making sure she knew who was in charge: who the master was in the situation, making sure, she knew he demanded submission.<br/>
The unknown man, smirked down at the slight form of a beautiful brown-haired woman, lying before him on hands and knees, stomach low to the ground, head bowed at his mere presence. And felt his cock tighten his pants at the sight of her submission, her neck slightly bared to him just waiting for him to bite into her soft flesh.</p><p>"Ah, very beautiful indeed." He cooed, as he brushed his fingertips over Hermione's jaw. She whimpered again and he smirked, catching her by back of her shirt he toted her roughly to her feet and began to circle her, as she shuddered under his intense gaze. Her 5'4" was still nothing in comparison to his, even though he only stood a head taller than her, and she wanted to shy away from him.</p><p>With her primal instincts still on high alert, her fuzzy brain could finally start to take control of her human instincts. Fight or flight became her options; no longer submit and obey, as her breathing became labored, her heart pounding in her ears. He was too close for her to run, and would surely catch her if she did.</p><p>The man knew he was intimidating her.</p><p>She will run soon. The thought of getting to chase her down again bring him immense pleasure. He wanted to play with her for a bit longer. Quickly, he rushed up behind her, relishing the feel of her soft slightly chilled body against his; the scent of her fear hung heavy in the air.<br/>
Hermione's train of thought stopped abruptly, when she felt a sudden rush of heat up the backside of her body. Every muscle in her body went on lock down, tensing for fight, hot breath fanned out over the back of her neck where her hair was pulled into a ponytail to keep it out of the way. Goosebumps erupted down her neck and arms and she shivered.<br/>
The front of his body pressed against her back and rump, but had, as of yet, to physically restrain her. The breath stuttered in Hermione’s chest, slowly. she tilted her head to the left to try to see what he was doing.</p><p>His strong hand clamped down firmly on her shoulder as he inhaled the scent of the milky white skin of her neck.</p><p>"Mm, you're the one that got away from the other snatchers at the camp site. You smell of your male companions." he growled in her ear.</p><p>"I…" he cut her off with a growl before she could reply.</p><p>"I find I do not like it that you smell of other men." Anger washed over Hermione and she huffed how dare he. He doesn’t own me I am my own person. I don’t even know the damn wanker! </p><p>"Sod off!” Hermione growled as she tried to shrug free of the wolf’s hold on her shoulders. “ I don’t belong to you! I don't even know who you are for Merlin's sake!" Hermione realized a bit too late, that she really should think before she blew up like that, it could end very badly for her. </p><p>The man in question puffed up behind her to his full height, looming over her as if he were about to deliver the deathblow, a steady growl rumbling in his broad chest. Before Hermione could move the wolf man had one hand wrapped her hair causing her to yelp in surprise as she suddenly found her head yanked back and to the side. His other arm wrapped firmly around Hermione’s waist holding her in place so she could not get away. Not giving her time to react he quickly bit down on the juncture on her neck and shoulder: </p><p>Teeth sinking deep into the tender flesh as blood filled his mouth. Hermione’s scream rang through the forest.<br/>
Hermione whimpered one hand trying to free her hair from the man’s grip the other trying to prize him off of her throat by pulling his hair.<br/>
He growled at her attempts and tightened his hold on her waist.</p><p> After, the initial panic subsided a little bit Hermione slowly, realized that with the wolf’s teeth still in her neck, it hurt less if she held still. It wasn’t like she stood a chance of breaking free of the man’s hold and she feared if she struggled to much she may accidently cause her own throat to be torn out.</p><p>A growl of approval rumbled from the man’s chest, as Hermione tried to calm herself, and slowly lowered her arms. Well, the one that was pulling his hair anyway. She whimpered as he removed his teeth from her neck. She could feel the blood as it spilled from the wound over her cold clammy skin and she nearly fainted. Her legs gave out, and the wolf thinking the fight has finally left her, lowered her to the ground and stepped back so he could admire at his newest pack member.<br/>
Hermione slowly gathered her legs beneath her as she took deep breaths trying to calm her racing heart and calm her frayed nerves.  Pulling her trembling hand away from her shoulder she tried to take inventory of how badly she was bleeding. Her brilliant mind raced through the implications of what this wound would mean for her. The possible scenarios flashed before her eyes and she knew her only hope was to escape to find Remus. He would help her through this and watch over her it would be too dangerous to be around the boys till after the first full moon. </p><p> Hermione decided that at this moment, it was time to take her leave, while she still had two legs to walk on. </p><p>Or four to run on.</p><p>With that thought in mind, Hermione cautiously tried to see what her capturer was doing. (He was appraising her like a prized pig!) She pulled all her concentration together and shifted into her animagus form and ran like a speeding bullet into forest; away from the little boxed in hole that she had gotten herself into. The man's footfalls were heavy, and she had no doubt he would overtake her soon. The fact that he was a werewolf, just reassured her that it would be sooner rather than later.</p><p>Adrenalin rushed through her veins as she ran for her life, she heard him chant a spell that blasted past her shoulder. Hermione pushed herself harder, she was quick,  but not quick enough to avoid the heavy paws that landed on her shoulders, plunging her toward the earth, causing her legs to buckle under the combined force of both of their bodies colliding together.</p><p>The big wolf was quite impressed with her ability to concentrate enough to still try to get away.</p><p>Yes. He decides, his plans for this female have suddenly changed. She will make a fine mate. She has much skill and he will enjoy forcing her to submit beneath him.<br/>
Hermione and the great wolf hit the ground and rolled, growling and snarling down the slight incline. The air around them shimmered, but Hermione in her frantic state to somehow escape from this wolf did not notice that they had just rolled through a portal into an unfamiliar place.</p><p>Home.</p><p>The huge wolf had taken her to her new home: here he could challenge her disrespect, and make her obey him without the worry of the snatchers trying to hurt his chosen mate. The only pain she would endure now was that, which he inflicted on her, and he would inflict his pain on her. She must know her place so that he can keep her safe.</p><p>The Order of Phoenix was not keeping her safe, he could see plainly that they could not control her, and the dark side had almost caught her. The things they would have done to his female, made him want to kill every one of them on sight. She would not be permitted to return to the Order of Phoenix's headquarters unless escorted by himself, when goes to the next meeting.</p><p>The two wolves fought snarls and growls and yelps of pain could be heard. Gathering the attention of his pack. He did not fight fully, for he did not wish to kill her, only force her into submission. He sensed, she needed the out let for her own emotions too; he could smell her fear and sense her frustration.</p><p>Viciously, she sunk her sharp little teeth into his front leg and he jerked away from her with a snarl, which gave her time to make it to her feet.<br/>
His little bitch had played long enough; it was time to show her, her place. As she turned to run off into the forest again, he pounced on her back, with the brunt of all of his weight bringing her once again to the ground; pinning her with his massive body, under him where she belonged, then he sunk his teeth deep into her shoulder. Again.</p><p>She yelped and whimpered with pain, struggling to get away from his vicious hold. Her body to tired too fight any more betrayed her, and she slipped once again into human. He let his own body do the same, all the while keeping his teeth firmly in her skin. She cried a little sob, wiggling a little, with great effort to get away. His growl was loud as he warned her to hold still. He took a heavy draw of her blood, and she shuddered before collapsing to the forest floor with defeat, finally surrendering to him. Her vision swimming out of focus quickly.</p><p>Yes, what a fine female he has chosen. Most are bull headed but will submit when forced with little fight.( Some mind you or it wouldn’t be any fun.) My little bitch fights. The proof, which made him grin, was running down his arm even as he thought about it. Yes, she is worthy to be called my mate. The alpha's female. He thought with pride.<br/>
The air around them erupted with cheers and howls, his pack congratulating him on the victory with his mate. The wolf smirked as he pulled her body flush against his own, releasing her neck. He lapped at the wound and it clotted over. Hermione vaguely noticed the commotion, and somewhere in her brain, she realized that it must be the Alpha's pack. </p><p>Nevertheless, she was just too exhausted to even move any more. Unable to keep her eyes from rolling back into her head.</p><p>Hermione heard or rather felt the vibrations of his chuckle, as he scooped her limp body up into his arms bridal style, and started to carry her away to somewhere unknown to her, and at that moment she just couldn’t seem to care. She felt strangely safe, right then, in her captor's arms. As if she were a by stander watching what was happening to someone else. Fighting to stay conscious, with bleary eyes she looked into the handsome face of the wolf that carried her, his face was full of pride, as if he won the best prize the world had to offer. He smirked down at her knowing she would be no trouble for a while now.</p><p>She could barely keep her eyes open.</p><p>"I'm Fenrir Greyback." He spoke, to his barely awake beauty. "Welcome to your new home, my mate." He states proudly, as she succumbs to darkness and much needed rest.</p>
