    <p>It had been a week since Hermione arrived at the Burrow for her holiday. She’d been pressured by her boss at the Ministry to finally take the time off she’d been accruing for the past year. After some protests, the compromise she allowed was spending a month at the Weasley House. Molly Weasley was, of course, delighted to have her company over the summer. And with Ginny and Harry staying there while the two of them prepared for the arrival of their first child, Hermione was more than happy to take a break from work. (But not before sneaking off with a pile of documents to take care of while she was away.)</p><p>In the week since she arrived, no less than three Weasley siblings had ducked into the house for varying lengths of time. Bill and Fleur visited for an afternoon, with little Victoire cradled in her father’s arms.</p><p>Percy and Audrey stayed for a few days. He and Hermione discussed their work at length until Mrs Weasley hushed them for talking shop over dinner.</p><p>Ron stayed the longest. His visit with Harry and his sister didn’t end until his fifth dinner came to a close. He and Harry spent the days flying out in the backyard and playing chess. Catching up with Hermione had become their evening routine. She enjoyed this Weasley visit the most so far. She had missed her friends.</p><p>Hermione thought after Ron’s departure that the whirlwind of redheads had finally finished. The flurry of relatives was not unwelcome, but Hermione could tell Mrs Weasley’s hospitality had been stretched thin by the in-and-out of children and grandchildren and guests. Hermione helped around the house whenever she could, but nothing could soften the blow of their next visitors.</p><p>The swing of the front door and harmonized greetings one Sunday night meant the two most exhausting members of the Weasley clan had flooded in. Fred and George hugged their parents and set down their luggage with loud formalities and the announcement of their three-week-long visit. Hermione was pulled into a tight embrace by the both of them.</p><p>“Hermione!” The twins said in unison. “What a treat!”</p><p>“Hello boys,” she patted their backs, warmed by their affections.</p><p>“We didn’t expect to see our favourite classmate before Christmas,” George said as he drew away.</p><p>“I’m on holiday.”</p><p>“Holiday?” Fred asked, hands still on her arms. “What, so the paradise of the Ministry wasn’t enough for you?”</p><p>“They forced me to take my annual leave.”</p><p>“Ah, that sounds more likely.” Fred laughed, patting her on the cheek. “Well, I’m glad you’ve chosen <i>Casa de Weasley</i> for your luxury resort.”</p><p>“We’ve had the same idea.” George helped his father in picking up their bags. “We left Lee in charge of the summer rush while we spend some time strategizing our Fall Line.”</p><p>“Always found good luck in returning to our roots for inspiration.” Fred elaborated.</p><p>Mrs Weasley put her hands on her hips. “I hope that won’t mean you’ll be causing trouble for me all month.” </p><p>“Of course not, Mum.” Fred draped his arm around her shoulder. “We are grown adults,”</p><p>“Professional businessmen,”</p><p>“And very good sons.”</p><p>“We’ll be quiet as mice; we won’t bother you in the slightest.”</p><p>“Plus,” Fred’s arm now moved to Hermione. “We’ve got the sharpest Prefect in the history of Hogwarts under the same roof.”</p><p>“No nonsense with Granger here keeping an eye on things.” George agreed.</p><p>“I should hope not.” That seemed to put Mrs Weasley at ease. “Arthur, help me with these bags.”</p><p>“I’ve got it, Mum.” George held out a hand to keep his mother from fussing. She followed in step behind her husband and son, tutting for some way to help, as they made their way upstairs.</p><p>Fred remained in the living room with an arm around Hermione.</p><p>“It’s good to see you,” Fred grinned at her.</p><p>“Good to see you, too.” She said.</p><p>“Been keeping out of trouble?”</p><p>“I should be asking you that.”</p><p>“You shouldn’t if you know the answer.”</p><p>“Right.” </p><p>She couldn’t hold back her smile. For all their headaches, she did miss the Weasley twins a great deal. Fred had kept his hair short and tidy, something Hermione was sure to be for the sake of his mother. His summer attire was a breezy blue button-up, rolled to the elbows and falling loosely on his chest. He’d gotten taller.</p><p>“Are you really planning on staying for three whole weeks?” Hermione asked him.</p><p>“Don’t sound too excited.” He said. “George and I should have plenty to keep us busy. We will leave you to enjoy your holiday in peace.”</p><p>“You two are incapable of leaving me in peace.”</p><p>“And yet you’re still happy to see us.” Fred gave her nose a small tap with his finger. He let his arm fall from her shoulder. “Well, the feeling is mutual, Granger Dear, and I look forward to our stay together.” Fred gave her a wink before departing for the stairs. Hermione shook her head, chuckling. This was going to be a long month.</p>

</center>Hermione was up early the next day. Recently, she had fallen into the routine of helping Ginny make breakfast for the family. Cooking wasn’t something she was particularly good at, so she mostly helped by handing off ingredients and setting the table. With the addition of two more Weasleys, the end result resembled more of a buffet than a simple meal.<p>The rising sun cast streaks along the dining table as Hermione laid out dishes. When Ginny approached the table with another handful of plates, she gestured to the stairs.</p><p>“Would you mind getting everyone?” With a mild groan, Ginny put a hand to her lower back that had been aching all morning. At six months pregnant, she wasn’t keen on making trips upstairs to herd her family. With a nod, Hermione gladly took on the task.</p><p>Harry and Ginny’s room was first on her route. She made light steps on the wooden floor as she approached.</p><p>“Harry?” Hermione called quietly, knocking only barely and pushing the door open a sliver. She saw a mop of black hair shift under a pile of white sheets. Harry let out a groan as he rolled over, curling himself tighter into the blankets.</p><p>“Breakfast is ready when you wake up,” Hermione assured him. Harry gave a noise that sounded like “yeah, thanks, ‘Mione...”, muffled by the pillow. When the lump of sheets began to snore again, Hermione shut the door and latched it quietly into place. </p><p>She headed up another flight and passed Arthur in the hall. </p><p>“Good morning, Hermione,” He greeted in his ever-cheerful voice.</p><p>“Good morning, Mr Weasley.” She said. “Ginny’s got breakfast ready.”</p><p>“Excellent,” He nodded, adding the final loop to his tie. “Molly and I will grab a bite of it before we leave. I’m taking her out shopping today. Something special for the end of summer. Thought I’d treat her to new fertilizer and gnome-repellent.”</p><p>Hermione laughed politely and Mr Weasley went off to fetch his wife. </p><p>As Hermione continued up the stairs and around hallways and empty bedrooms, she was aware of the uncharacteristic quietness of the Burrow. The greying wood creaked under her soft footsteps, but no other noise could be heard up on these higher levels of the house. </p><p>Percy’s room was locked, with magic and muggle protection. With a few more steps she passed the door to Ron’s room. It was left ajar as if he’d only just left and expected to return in a moment. She padded past the room Bill and Fleur had turned into storage. Hermione had been using Charlie’s old room for her holiday, the emptiest and easiest in which to unpack her things. </p><p>Hermione let the dull ache of old memories run through her as she traced the railing with her palm. She felt comforted by the walls that creaked and rugs that had worn threadbare. This home, quiet and empty, felt soaked with the presence of her second family. The light breeze of summer morning came through dusted windows and she took a deep breath.</p><p>The few steps to Fred and George’s door were different. As Hermione approached, she disliked the lack of chaos usually heard from their room. It was calm, and she did not trust it at all.</p><p>She brought her hand up to the grain, about to knock lightly, when the door swung suddenly open.</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione exclaimed as she nearly bumped into the chest of Fred Weasley.</p><p>“Good morning.” He grinned down at her. His expression, soft with sleepiness, brightened when he saw her.</p><p>“Good morning,” Hermione took a step back to give him space. “Breakfast is ready.”</p><p>“Great,” Fred smiled. “Thank you.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to be up.” She said.</p><p>“I was just about to head down.” He said. “It smells fantastic.”</p><p>“Yes, well, that’s mostly Ginny’s doing,” Hermione admitted. “I’m not so great in the kitchen.”</p><p>“I bet you did fantastically.” Fred patted her shoulder and made his way downstairs. He had closed the door behind him, and Hermione didn’t get the chance to tell George. She decided he must have heard them, anyway, and followed Fred down the hall.</p><p>“Did you sleep well?” Hermione asked, “I hope your beds were alright. I made them about a week ago and didn’t know how you liked your pillows fluffed.”</p><p>Fred glanced at her over his shoulder. “I didn’t realize you were running a Bed and Breakfast.” He chuckled. “Everything was perfect. I slept wonderfully. It’s amazing how easy that is to do without Ron and Ginny shouting at each other.”</p><p>“They got along fine when he was here a few days ago.” She walked a bit faster to keep up with his long strides.</p><p>“Oh, did I miss his visit? Shame,” Fred said, and he really did sound disappointed. “Wanted to see if he’d improved since our last match. I know Ginny’s been teaching him some of the Harpies’ techniques.”</p><p>“I bet she’d be happy to help you out, too,” Hermione offered.</p><p>Fred shrugged. “Oh, I don’t need the help,” he grinned. “Plus, with how pregnant she is, I doubt Gin would be feeling too up to a game of Quidditch.”</p><p>“Oh, no, she would!” Hermione said. “You should have heard her when her manager told her to take maternity leave. ‘This child is going to be born with a broom in their hand; I’m playing until it bloody pops out of me!’”</p><p>Fred laughed with her. “That’s my sister,” he said wistfully. “Oh, speaking of her,” Fred paused, turning on his heel. “I’ve forgotten something. Meet you down there, yeah?”</p><p>Hermione nodded and returned to the kitchen. She chatted with Mrs Weasley as she cut through her toast. She and Mr Weasley left a moment later, dressed for a summer day out. When twenty minutes had come and gone, Hermione wondered when the boys would finally be down.</p><p>“Honestly,” she said as she brushed crumbs off the tablecloth. “Why even bother fetching them in the first place?”</p><p>Ginny shook her head as she downed another helping of bacon.</p><p>The swift sound of footsteps rushing down several flights of stairs pounded through the walls. Fred jumped down on the landing, holding something behind his back. He bowed to the girls as they rolled their eyes at him. </p><p>“Dearest sister,” Fred moved to the table, bending down to plant a kiss on Ginny’s cheek.</p><p>“You need to shave.” She complained, rubbing at the spot where his scruff had made contact.</p><p>Fred ignored her and turned. “Dearest Granger,” He leaned over to kiss Hermione on the cheek as well, but she ducked out of the way.</p><p>“No,” She warned, holding up her index finger admonishingly. </p><p>Fred, undeterred, leaned in again. When his second attempt was met with another quick dodge, he aimed for the top of her head and kissed her bushy mane of hair.</p><p>“Ack,” He pulled away and stuck out his tongue. “Hairball.”</p><p>“Very funny,” Hermione said.</p><p>“For you, sister dear,” Fred removed his hand from behind his back and presented Ginny with a box wrapped in pastel green paper.</p><p>She accepted the gift, cautiously untying the ribbons wrapped around it. She fixed Fred with a look of suspicion, which he waved off.</p><p>“C’mon then, I haven’t rigged it.” He said assuredly.</p><p>Ginny took one more beat of hesitation before tugging away the paper in a final sweep. Inside the box, there was a bit of soft fabric. Ginny examined it as she took it into her hands. A small plush lion gave a meek roar at the contact. Smiling, Ginny watched the lion roll onto her palm and purr against her skin. It was rounded and soft, and very cute.</p><p>“For my niece,” Fred elaborated with a grin. “Or nephew. Or whichever,”</p><p>“Fred, this is wonderful,” Ginny pulled her brother into a hug. “Thank you,” She placed the lion on the table, letting it pad along the wood with its stuffed feet.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” He said. “That one’s just from me. George will have another gift for you soon. We’re still working on the right charm.”</p><p>“Where is George, anyway?” Hermione asked, peeling back the rind of an orange.</p><p>Fred turned to go pour himself a cup of coffee. “Still in bed, the old sleepyhead. He was up late last night working through some of our books.” After a few years of figuring out how to balance responsibilities at Weasley Wizard Wheezes, the twins decided that Fred would handle the production side of things while George was in charge of their money. The system worked well enough, and only once had there ever been a fight over which one would be in charge of the boring parts.</p><p>Fred sat down across from them, curling his fingers around the hot coffee mug. “So,” He exhaled, settling in. “What have the prettiest witches in the house been up to all summer?” Fred winked at Hermione, who rolled her eyes.</p><p>“You’d know if you read the letters Mum’s been sending you.” Ginny scolded. “She only hears from you two about three times a year.”</p><p>“Shop’s hard work.” Fred offered a vague defence. He took a sip of his coffee and pulled a face at the bitterness. He scooped up a few generous helpings of sugar as Hermione shook her head at the display. She took her coffee black.</p><p>“Besides, to my credit, I <i>read</i> every letter.” He elaborated. “It just takes a lot out of me to write her back. I love the woman, bless her, but some goings-on are too complicated to get into over parchment.”</p><p>“Too complicated, or too dangerous?” Hermione asked, raising her eyebrow and knowing the answer already.</p><p>“Well, there’s no sense in giving the poor woman a heart attack every week, is there?” Fred allowed. “And I respond to the important news!” He turned to his sister, insistent. “When she told me you were pregnant, I was the first in the family to send a congratulations letter!”</p><p>“Actually, Ron was,” Ginny confessed. “I owled him about a week after we found out.”</p><p>Fred clutched his chest in shock. “You told Ickle Ronniekins before your favourite brother?!”</p><p>“Charlie’s my favourite brother.” Ginny reminded him, earning a groan of pain from Fred. “And we had to tell him, he’s Harry’s best friend.”</p><p>“And where is Professor Potter this morning?” Fred let out a huff. “Waiting with other news to tell his best friend about before me?”</p><p>“Sleeping in.” A call came from the stairs, and Harry entered the kitchen with a mop of jet-black hair looking more dishevelled than usual. “And I promise, the next time we experience a very personal, important life milestone you’ll be the first to know, Fred.”</p><p>“Speak of the Stag,” Fred grinned at his entrance. “That’s more like it. Alright, Harry?”</p><p>“Just fantastic.” Harry dragged a hand over his tired face. He greeted Ginny with a sleepy kiss. Giving Hermione a companionate side-hug, he headed to the counter to make himself tea.</p><p>“It’s a little early to call this ‘sleeping in,’” Hermione glanced at the clock that read 8:15.</p><p>“He’s been up at four all this past week,” Ginny explained for him as Harry nodded along and drank his tea. “Prepping for classes.”</p><p>“That’s right,” Hermione said, coming to the realization. “It’s nearly September!”</p><p>“Just a few more weeks,” Harry said. “I’m trying to see what I can arrange with Professor McGonagall about switching the curriculum for the fifth years.”</p><p>Fred hummed attentively, reaching over to pull a slice of fruit off of Hermione’s plate. She shot him a look that he accepted with a cheeky grin.</p><p>“Their OWL scores went up since I introduced counter-jinxes to their schedule...” He removed his glasses to rub his palm against his eye. “So, I hope that means the lessons I have planned for the fall will be challenging enough for their sixth year. Of course, there’s always their NEWTs to think about… Hopefully, their scores won’t dip too badly. I don’t know how great an idea it would be to throw Dangerous Beast identification into the mix…” Harry trailed off distractedly.</p><p>“Look at you, prattling along about schoolwork.” Fred tilted his head and grinned at Hermione. “I wonder where you got that from.” She bit back a smile.</p><p>“Harry, don’t worry too much,” Hermione offered. “You’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Hogwarts has ever had.”</p><p>“That’s not saying a lot,” Fred added, and Hermione glared at him. “But she’s right,” He backpedalled. “You’re doing fine, mate.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Harry let out a breath. “And honestly, it’s not that bad. It’s challenging, but I feel better working at this than… really, anything I’ve ever done before.”</p><p>“Not that you’ve had the most conventional upbringing,” Ginny joked, rubbing a hand along his back.</p><p>Harry chuckled. “You’re right. For some reason teaching about the Dark Arts is a whole lot better than actually fighting against them.”</p><p>“Here, here.” Fred raised his coffee to his mouth.</p><p>“Any big plans for the day?” Harry asked his wife. </p><p>“Not really,” Ginny shrugged.</p><p>“Good,” Harry said sternly. “Then you’re perfectly free to lay around and give me lots of attention.”</p><p>Hermione snorted. “Oh, god,” </p><p>Ginny laughed at her husband and patted his arm. “I was thinking something along the lines of going over your lesson plans together, but yes, I suppose I could do that too.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Harry gave his words an extra bit of flare.</p><p>“You two are just sickly sweet.” Fred shook his head.</p><p>“You’re just jealous.” Ginny stuck out her chin.</p><p>“I am not,” Fred said. “I could be just as adorable with Hermione any time I want.”</p><p>“You could not,” Hermione said.</p><p>“But I keep myself decent,” Fred continued, “For company’s sake.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes for what felt like the hundredth time.</p><p>“Hey,” Fred said. “Later, if you two aren’t busy being the second cutest couple in the house, how about a bit of Quidditch?”</p><p>“Yeah, alright,” Harry nodded. “It’s been ages since I’ve been out.”</p><p>“You were playing with Ron just three days ago!” Hermione spoke up.</p><p>“Like I said,” Harry held up his hands. “Ages.”</p>

</center>Hermione did not join them that afternoon in the backyard. She stayed inside, up in her room, toiling away on Ministry appeals and cases. She didn’t mind it, sitting and working. She needed to be productive this month, or she’d be behind. From her spot on the windowsill, she had a decent view of the yard and the makeshift Quidditch field below.<p>George had awoken just in time to play some two-on-two with them. With their teams established, Harry, Ginny, and the twins gathered in the yard for their match. They zipped and spun through the air energetically. Ginny looked just as skilful as ever on her broom, dashing around the field and scoring circles around the boys. They weren’t playing with bludgers, so Fred and George were taking up Chaser and Keeper positions. Their stockier builds weren’t as adept to the agility required for the role, so Harry was easily out-manoeuvring them. They caught up to him a few times, though, using techniques they’d seen at old World Cups and matches. By the time they’d properly warmed up, all four of them were playing to their fullest.</p><p>A strange feeling overcame Hermione as she watched Fred dart around the field with that huge grin on his face. She felt something that she had never associated with Quidditch before. Longing.</p><p>Well, maybe that was a bit too serious. But still, the feeling came to her all the same. Hermione wanted to be on that field with them. She wanted to play and laugh with her friends, to feel the wind whip through her hair and a swoop in her stomach. To dive and rush and hit and catch. Her longing for it was so strong at that moment that she even considered taking the risk of getting on a broom to do so. </p><p>When her indulgent daydreaming came to pass, Hermione shook her head. Honestly, what was she thinking? She hated flying. She was terrified to do it. What could be so important to her that she would take that risk? </p><p>Hermione turned back to her work, removing the uncharacteristic desire from her mind. She scratched away at her paper, determined to regain focus. Her attention slipped only slightly, and in a moment of weakness, she glanced at the window again. Fred looked very good on a broom.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊</p>
</center>The next morning was quiet. Harry and Ginny were off shopping for baby supplies in London, and Arthur and Molly were off to work. The twins had yet to come downstairs, so Hermione decided to enjoy this rare moment of peace.<p>The Burrow, with its unreliable insulation and constantly steaming machines and tea kettles, was unbearably hot on summer days like this one. The sun beat down its scalding heat until the late afternoon.</p><p>Hermione sat in the living room, curled with files and documents on her lap. Beads of sweat dripped from her forehead. She’d had to twist her unruly hair up in a bun to keep its frizzing under control. Even in her coolest summer outfit, she was still smothered by the humidity that settled into her skin. She continued through the sweat until she heard the steps coming from upstairs.</p><p>Fred sauntered down with exaggerated effort.</p><p>Hermione looked up from her work with a questioning quirk of her eyebrow. Fred let out a dramatic sigh, fanning himself with his hand and puffing out his shirt. As he slumped into the armchair next to her and let out another pathetic moan, Hermione humoured him.</p><p>“Yes?” She continued scrawling onto her paper.</p><p>“It’s so hot out,” Fred whined, glancing to her for a reaction.</p><p>“I could cast a cooling charm on you.” She offered.</p><p>“No, that’s no fun,” Fred declined.</p><p>Hermione chuckled. “Bored and hot? Goodness, how will you ever survive?”</p><p>“It’s quite a curse, really.”</p><p>“Well, don’t look to me for entertainment,” Hermione blotted ink against a scrap piece. “I’ve got a lot of paperwork to catch up on.”</p><p>“While you’re on holiday,” Fred said flatly. “Visiting friends who would love to spend time with you.”</p><p>“Mmhm.” Hermione continued to write.</p><p>“You know what would be great on a day like this?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Going for a swim.” A grin crept to Fred’s face.</p><p>“Where would we do that?” Hermione asked, though she hardly thought Fred would bring up the subject without a plan of his own already in mind.</p><p>“The pond outside is quite lovely this time of year.”</p><p>“I think I’ll pass.”</p><p>“Now, Hermione,” Fred deflated. “It’s hot out and I want to go swimming!”</p><p>“You are welcome to go without me.”</p><p>“It won’t be as fun.”</p><p>“What about George? Can’t you go with him?”</p><p>“He’s in meetings at Gringotts today. Treasury stuff.” Fred tilted his head at her. “Plus, he doesn’t look nearly as good in a suit as you would.”</p><p>“Oh, I bet he could pull off a bikini quite well,” Hermione replied in monotone.</p><p>“About as well as I can,” Fred joked, “And from experience, I can tell you it’s not flattering.”</p><p>Hermione shrugged. She flipped a page over casually. “He’s grown taller than you.”</p><p>“George?” Fred snorted. “No, he hasn’t.”</p><p>“He has,” Hermione tapped the paper with her quill. “By about half an inch.”</p><p>“Impossible.”</p><p>“It’s quite possible,” Hermione smirked. “That’s what you get for not drinking your milk.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Fred waved her away. “Anyway, I still tower over you so what does it matter?”</p><p>“I would hardly call one foot ‘towering’.”</p><p>“You’re so tiny,” Fred’s mouth curled into a grin as he teased. “Little Granger. Five feet tall, you could fit in my pocket!”</p><p>“Oh, hush.” She bit back her smile. “If I didn’t like you so much, this would be bullying.”</p><p>“You like me?” Fred faltered.</p><p>“Of course, I do,” Hermione stated, matter-of-factly without meeting the cocky grin she knew he was wearing. “I’ve known you for over ten years, Fred, it’s hard not to like someone you’ve known that long.”</p><p>“That’s your reason? Persistence?”</p><p>“You certainly are,” Hermione said, “Persistent to the point of annoyance. I can’t get rid of you.”</p><p>“Nor would you want to.”</p><p>“No,” Hermione agreed in her very professional way. “I wouldn’t.”</p><p>Fred thought on this for a bit. Hermione glanced up at him and saw his expression twisted into something resembling mild surprise.</p><p>“Well, you certainly know how to sweep a guy off his feet, Granger.” Fred finally let out a sigh and relaxed into the chair. “Honestly, that has got to be one of the most frigid declarations of love I’ve ever been privy to.”</p><p>“I said nothing about ‘love’,” Hermione stopped her pen. “You are so dramatic.” </p><p>“And you love it.” Fred quirked the corner of his mouth. He leaned over to her paper, getting a better look. “What are you writing?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m not.” Hermione flipped the piece of parchment up. A grin snuck to her face as she revealed a page full of ink. It was covered in scribbles and mindlessly looping strokes.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Fred broke out laughing. “You really weren’t.”</p><p>“Do you think I can focus <i>at all</i> with you bothering me like this?”</p><p>“I’m only bothering you because you need a break.”</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“You have been working since six in the morning, Hermione,” his tone turned a bit serious. “You need a break.” He repeated.</p><p>Hermione gave him a look, and he held up his hands in surrender.</p><p>Fred let out a laboured sigh, slouching back. He allowed for a few beats of impatient silence before speaking up again.</p><p>“Nice glasses,” he tilted his chin at the tortoiseshell frames around her brown eyes. “Those new?”</p><p>Hermione folded the piece of paper neatly. “Relatively. I saw an optometrist—A muggle doctor for eyes—a few summers ago and she said I needed them.”</p><p>“Man, I’d hate to be the person telling Hermione Granger she can no longer read by candlelight.” Fred chuckled.</p><p>Hermione smiled genuinely. “Yes, it was quite disappointing.” She removed the glasses from her face, a few stray curls of hair bouncing back into place.</p><p>“They’re just supposed to be for reading, but I’ve charmed them for a little more than that.” She handed the glasses over to Fred, who took them graciously and put them on his own face.</p><p>“When the glasses recognize a book it’s already seen, it highlights important parts.” She explained, turning her open book to face him. “I’ve charmed it to pick up on themes, motifs, important quotes, character motivations, and other helpful syntax.” She pointed to each of her examples in turn. Fred poured over the page, eyes wide and fascinated.</p><p>“The highlights are multi-coloured, as well,” Hermione said, pride unhidden in her voice.</p><p>“Incredible,” he mused, touching the parchment lightly. “Really, this is next level. You could make a fortune on these, Granger. ‘Re-Reader Lenses’. Has a nice ring to it.”</p><p>“If you steal my invention, I want royalties.” She chuckled pleasantly, resting her chin in her palm.</p><p>“Do you think we could charm them to see through clothes, as well?” With the question, he turned his gaze on her.</p><p>“Absolutely not.” She laughed, swatting at his face as he looked her outfit up and down.</p><p>Fred unsheathed his wand with a flourish. “I bet I could fix that—<i>Vestimenta Reveli</i>— “</p><p>“Fred!” Hermione shrieked, lunging for the glasses. He ducked his head out of her reach.</p><p>“Honestly,” she huffed. “I take you to one muggle joke shop and it fills your head with all sorts of dangerous ideas.”</p><p>“If you think we haven’t given X-Ray glasses a shot before, you don’t know us at all,” Fred said with a shake of his finger. “George and I started inventing when we were fourteen years old. Do you really think that wasn’t one of the first things on our beta line?”</p><p>“How’d they go?” Hermione laughed, replacing the glasses back in their self-cleaning box.</p><p>“They could see through skin.” Fred gave a shudder. “Not the sexiest thing we could have hoped for. Kind of traumatized us to the idea after that.”</p><p>“I bet.” She leaned back in her seat. “I suppose that’s the only way either of you will end up seeing a woman without her clothes, anyway.”</p><p>“Oy!” Fred yelled; fake shock broken by his laughter. “Uncalled for!”</p><p>Hermione giggled, ignoring the dramatic hand clutching his chest.</p><p>“I’ll have you know my dashing good looks and charming personality has had an excellent success rate!” He defended.</p><p>“Right.” Hermione raised her eyebrow at him. “That’s why you’re spending your holiday at your mother’s house.”</p><p>“And what’s your excuse?” He quirked his eyebrow in challenge.</p><p>Hermione crossed her arms. “I wasn’t the one who just tried to magic away their friend’s clothes.”</p><p>“Speaking of disrobing,” Fred continued, ignoring Hermione’s scoff. “How about that swim, then?”</p><p>“I haven’t got a bathing suit.”</p><p>“What you have under there is fine,” Fred took the hit to the arm with a laugh.</p><p>Hermione glared at him for a moment before letting out a huff of air. “I’ll see if Ginny’s got something for me to borrow.” Hermione stood, ignoring Fred’s excited fist-pumping as she left the room.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione met Fred downstairs. He had changed into his own suit. A vibrant pair of orange trunks with purple stripes contrasted the modest blue one-piece Hermione had on. She caught his eyes dipping across her form, but he didn’t comment. She accepted the towel he threw to her and followed him outside.</p><p>As they passed the garden, the smell of freshly watered soil and greenery floated through the air. Hermione admired the flowers and crops in full bloom as they continued around the house. The humidity mixed uncomfortably with the summer heat, and she was decidedly very glad to be going swimming after all. </p><p>Cattails and weeds clung to the perimeter of the pond. Waterlilies rose to the surface in clusters, and Hermione examined the rippling water. They walked down the small wooden pier, stopping before it ended.</p><p>“Are you sure it’s clean?” She asked, leaning over the edge tentatively.</p><p>“Granger, the dirtiest thing in this water is going to be me.”</p><p>Hermione looked at him, eyebrows flat and unamused. “Do you have an ‘off’ switch?”</p><p>“No,” Fred said. “But I <i>do</i> have an ‘on’ swi— “</p><p>“I’m going back inside.”</p><p>“No, no, Hermione, wait,” he laughed and slung an arm around her waist before she could turn to leave. “I’ll tone it down a bit, I promise.”</p><p>Hermione let out a sharp breath of air, blowing a few curls out of her eyes. She looked to him expectantly.</p><p>Fred’s grin made her nervous. “But I’m about to do something that has a high-risk, high-reward probability of coming off either ridiculously charming or ridiculously stupid.”</p><p>She eyed him suspiciously. “What?” She was suddenly nervous about his arm at her waist.</p><p>“Do you trust me?”</p><p>“Just barely.”</p><p>With a smirk, Fred gave a firm tug, and he and Hermione were falling into the water.</p><p>They hit the surface with a deep splash. Hermione’s scream of Fred’s name was cut short on impact. She twisted against his grip while they sunk, bubbles and water grass swirling around them. When they finally resurfaced, Hermione shoved away from Fred, who was laughing hysterically.</p><p>“Frederick Gideon Weasley!” Hermione screamed, incredulous. “You are <i>twenty-five</i> years old!” She whipped her sopping hair away from her face.</p><p>“And that means I’ve had that many years to perfect my technique. Now, Hermione, please,” Fred reached out to pull her closer to him in the water. “Just relax. Don’t worry, I’m here.”</p><p>“That’s exactly what I’m worried about.” She splashed him, attempting to keep her expression stern, but feeling laughter break her façade.</p><p>“So, what’s the verdict?” Fred said. “Charming or stupid?”</p><p>“Stupid!” Hermione shouted, unable to hold back her giggles. “So, so stupid!”</p><p>“Ah well,” Fred’s grin widened. “Worth a shot.”</p><p>After a moment of recovering from the initial shock of being dunked in, Hermione allowed herself to relax. The water was cool and surprisingly clear. She could track the waterlilies’ roots down to the bottom. The sand was about another three feet deeper than what she could reach. She treaded water around Fred as he floated. </p><p> “This <i>is</i> nice,” Hermione admitted, once she’d gone under again to straighten out her hair as best she could.</p><p>“Thanks for coming,” Fred replied, lounging. “I felt bad not having you out playing Quidditch with us yesterday.”</p><p>Hermione paused, looking to Fred. She examined his blank expression. “You didn’t have to do this out of pity.”</p><p>“Oh, no that wasn’t it.” Fred looked down at her. “I wanted to spend time with you, and I was disappointed we couldn’t yesterday.”</p><p>“Oh.” She thought on that. Her face held the faintest of blushes. “Well… I’m glad we can today.”</p><p>Fred smiled at her. “Me too.”</p><p>He righted himself in the water. “Hey,” he pointed to the other end of the pond. “Race you?”</p><p>“Alright,” A grin grew from Hermione’s face. She and Fred set up and were soon properly enjoying the water.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊</p>
</center>There were only a <i>few</i> weeds tangled in her hair.<p>“Honestly, Fred, I’ve got it!” Hermione insisted, swatting his hand away as they walked back to the house.</p><p>“<i>I’ve</i> almost got it, come on,” Fred reached for her mass of wet hair again, taking the strands delicately between his fingers. “Just… let me…”</p><p>“Ow!” Hermione exclaimed as he gave another tug.</p><p>“Got it! I’m sorry! I’m sorry, love,” he comforted, laughing and cradling her head apologetically. “Blimey, did you catch a whole tree in there?” Fred held up the twig he’d rescued from her curls.</p><p>Hermione exhaled sharply, turning to hide her blushing face. “Thank you,” she rubbed the spot on her scalp.</p><p>The sun was beginning to set by the time they returned from their swim. Fred’s face was flushed and glowing from the excursion in the sun, Hermione admired the way the light caught in his eyes. He led them back inside, fluffing his hair out with the towel. Hermione gave her own a preliminary squeeze before reaching for her wand and drying it out the rest of the way. She provided Fred with the same service, and he accepted the jet of warm air with a grin akin to that of a pleased cat. </p><p>They went up to their rooms to change, and when they returned downstairs, Mrs Weasley was entering through the front door. </p><p>“Welcome home, Mum,” Fred greeted, hugging her and kissing her cheek. </p><p>“Thank you, dear,” Mrs Weasley set down her things “Where’s your brother?”</p><p>“George should be back soon. He was going to check in with Lee after his meetings, so I expect him back within the hour.”</p><p>“Wonderful.” She let out a sigh, weary from the day. She checked her watch. “Well, it is Sunday night. I’ll tidy up a few things, then leave the kitchen to you, dear.”</p><p>“No, Mum, don’t worry, I’ve got it.” Fred patted her shoulder. “You’ve had a long day; I can take care of things.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Mrs Weasley glanced around.</p><p>“I’m sure. Go rest before dinner, I’ll call you when it’s ready.”</p><p>“Alright,” she let out a heavy sigh and ran a hand through her greying hair. “I’ll be upstairs. Hermione, dear, shout if you need me.”</p><p>“I’ll take care of Hermione,” Fred insisted. “Now go.”</p><p>Mrs Weasley retreated upstairs finally with a nod of her head. “Don’t set the house on fire.” </p><p>“Aw, Mum, that was only two times!” He called to her.</p><p>Hermione watched as Fred began opening cupboards. He opened the icebox and began sorting through its contents.</p><p>“<i>You’re</i> making dinner?” She raised her eyebrows.</p><p>Fred chuckled, turning to face her with an armful of ingredients. “Don’t look so surprised.” </p><p>Fred set the supplies on the counter. He turned to a shelf and pulled a heavy book from it. He set the recipe book down with a <i>thud</i> and began flipping through it.</p><p>“You can cook.” She said, still in disbelief.</p><p>“I can.” He kept turning pages.</p><p>“And you’re making dinner.” Hermione repeated, still dubious. She had sat down at the counter across from him.</p><p>Fred raised an eyebrow at her. “I promise I won’t poison you,”</p><p>Hermione let out a short puff of air but did not protest further.</p><p>She stared as he continued to move through the kitchen with ease. “Do you do this every Sunday?”</p><p>“Since I was twelve.” Fred nodded. “We all took turns for a while. With seven of us, it seemed only fair to help Mum out sometimes.”</p><p>Hermione hummed in understanding.</p><p>“Though, the rest of them kind of got sick of it. I kept taking over their shifts because I actually didn’t mind it. Eventually, I decided I kind of liked it, and I’ve been the only one making Sunday dinners for about seven years now.” Fred said, pulling a large pot from under the sink and placed it on the wood in front of her. “I cook for George back at our apartment, and then for the rest of us whenever we visit home. It’s quite fun, actually.”</p><p>“Ah,” Hermione said, contemplatively. He seemed to know exactly what he was doing, dipping in and out of cabinets and shuffling around spices. She figured she was just being paranoid, and honestly, she really did believe him. It just seemed too uncharacteristic for Fred Weasley to be acting so responsible. Not a firecracker or dung bomb in sight.</p><p>Hermione stood and met him at the sink. “Can I get you anything?”</p><p>“No, I’m alright,” Fred said calmly, picking up a sack of potatoes.</p><p>“Are you sure?” She moved to follow him when he turned away. “I could cut the onions or peel the potatoes.”</p><p>“That’s okay, I’ve got it.” He waved his wand and they began peeling themselves.</p><p>Hermione continued to hover. “I could slice the meat?” She tiptoed around him, manoeuvring around his path. “Or… something?”</p><p>“Hermione,” Fred turned. He gripped her arms at the elbow, thumbs on her skin and eyes locked on hers. “You are spectacular, amazing, and wonderful at <i>so many things</i>,”</p><p>Hermione blushed a lovely shade of red.</p><p>“But cooking is <i>not</i> one of them,” Fred admitted with a stern expression. “I can handle this. Now sit down and let me make dinner.” He finished with a soft smile and gave her a twirl. He placed her gently back on the stool at the counter. Hermione sighed impatiently but remained in her seat. Her face, still warm from the exchange, relaxed as Fred continued at his work. She leaned her arms on the counter, watching him search through cabinets. He turned on the stove, set up pots, gathered knives. Hermione’s eyes trailed him with a soft look of appreciation.</p><p>After a moment, she spoke up. “Are you going to wear the apron?” She pointed to the blue frilly thing hanging from a door hook.</p><p>Fred laughed. He put his hands on his hips, fixing her with a look. Spinning on his heels, he reached for the fabric and tied it around his waist. He presented his outfit to her with dramatic gesturing hands.</p><p>“Now you look the part.” She giggled at the display. “I trust you. Please continue.” </p><p>She gave her wand a flick, and her books flew over to where she sat. She set up her workstation while Fred whirled around the kitchen. The two of them carried on in amicable silence. Fred would whistle a few short tunes, and Hermione would tap her foot at the patterns. Her mistrust forgiven, they worked until dinner was ready.</p><p> </p><p>George arrived home around six thirty. The pinstripe vest he wore reflected the bright colour of his hair, and Hermione wondered if Fred had an outfit just as orange.</p><p>“Georgie, perfect timing,” Fred turned back to his work. “Dinner’s nearly done.”</p><p>“It smells great,” George said, gathering his silverware. “Beef stew, Freddie?”</p><p>“Only the best,” Fred said, placing the dish at its setting. </p><p>“Nice look,” George joked, tugging at the bit of blue lace around Fred’s waist.</p><p>“Thank you,” he gave his hips a little shake. “Hermione <i>insisted</i> I dress up for her.”</p><p>Hermione scoffed as George laughed.</p><p>“Well, you have excellent taste,” George told her, greeting her with a hug. “Hiya Granger. Where have you been all weekend?”</p><p>“Working” Hermione admitted, slightly sheepish.</p><p>“You are on <i>holiday</i>¸ Hermione,” George criticized. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ve put a stop to it as much as possible,” Fred said, pointing the ladle. “But every time I turn around, she’s got a quill in her hand!” He tapped the tip of her nose with the metal.</p><p>“I haven’t been <i>that</i> busy,” Hermione defended as she set down a glass of water.</p><p>“I’m surprised her hand hasn’t fallen off with all the writing.” Fred teased. He set the final dish onto the table and gave his hands a resolute clap. “Right. I’ll go get Mum and Dad. George, Hermione, make yourselves comfortable.”</p><p>Harry and Ginny walked through the door just as everyone was sitting down for the meal. They put away their packages of shopping spoils and joined everyone at the table.</p><p>The atmosphere was light and friendly. Hermione sat next to Ginny and Harry on one side, while Arthur, Molly, and George sat across. Fred sat at the head of the table, dolling out serving spoons and offering side dishes to anyone with an empty spot on their plate. He was insistent on acting host, and Hermione couldn’t help but admire how well he filled the role.</p><p>They all conversed long after their plates had emptied. Hermione nursed her glass of wine as she listened to Ginny tell one of her many Quidditch stories. Hermione would laugh, and she’d feel Fred’s eyes on her. That happened a lot, she was noticing more with every sip. She would speak and have Fred’s rapt attention. Even when they’d all be in other conversations, Fred’s glance kept landing on her throughout the entire meal. </p><p>She found her face blushing and blamed it on the wine.</p>
