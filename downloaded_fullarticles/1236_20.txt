<p>Draco Malfoy was grinding his teeth in frustration as he stared across the desk at the muggle estate agent.  She had to be at least eighty years old, which wouldn’t have been a big deal had she been a witch, but the crotchety old bag wasn’t a witch, she was a muggle and a difficult one at that.  She looked like the Queen of England with her perfectly coiffed silver hair and gaudy jewelry but she lacked the personable yet proper demeanor of the monarch.  No, this woman made Her Majesty look like that muggle bimbo Paris something or other that was all over the muggle publications.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Madam, I’m afraid I don’t understand the problem here,” Draco said as politely as he could manage in light of his irritation.  “You listed the property for sale, I have the money, in cash, to purchase it, yet you refuse me?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It isn’t that I don’t want to sell you the property, Mr. Malfoy, believe me when I say that I would love to wash my hands of that estate,” the prune faced crone said tightly, her nose in the air higher than any Malfoy ever attempted. “It has been listed in this agency for nearly a century, my grandfather was the original agent who listed it, but I can not, in good conscience sell you that property.  Not even to get it off of the books.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco seethed inwardly, he wanted that estate. He had only seen photographs of the exterior, the interior mattered very little to him, he would have it redone anyhow, but it had everything that he was looking for.  Settled into the Northern countryside it was wonderfully secluded with miles and miles of land attached to it.  Lush, green forests would provide wonderful hunting and a large lake in back would be perfect for fishing. It was far enough from Wiltshire and Malfoy Manor that he wouldn’t have his parents up his nose continuously and yet close enough that his mother wouldn’t have conniptions.  Though why it mattered when they could travel by floo or apparition he didn’t know.  And best of all it was large enough for a family, if and when he decided to settle down and make one.  If only the old hag would sell it to him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I still don’t understand, Madam.  I told you that I have no issues with the house being gas lit and the old plumbing doesn’t matter either, I fully intend to have the interior extensively renovated,” he persisted.  He had inherited his father’s uncanny business sense and charming manners, yet neither were helping him close this deal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Let me show you some other properties within your…”  The old woman stiffened when Draco held up his hand to stop her offer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I appreciate the offer, but I want <i>that</i> property,” he insisted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sir, the truth is that the estate comes with…baggage,” she said tightly her face coloring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Baggage?  What sort of baggage?” He asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The supernatural sort,” she said tightly.  She watched a slow smile creep over the handsome young man’s face and waited, fully prepared for him to scoff, as had all the others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Do you mean ghosts?” he asked, his rather mischievous grin making him even more attractive.   “Ghosts do not bother me, Madam.”  He said.  It never failed to amaze him how muggles looked at ghosts as something to be feared, something evil and wrong when to him they were the norm; they roamed the halls of his family’s estate and had guarded the halls of Hogwarts.  “If that is your reason for refusing to sell then let me assure you I am not at all bothered by it, I will sign documents releasing you from any responsibility if it will ease your mind.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m afraid it isn’t as simple as that, Mr. Malfoy.  That house is evil, that is why it remains empty,” she persisted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Look, the bottom line is that I want this house.  What will it take for you to sell it to me?  Do you want more money?”  He watched her rheumy eyes light up and knew he had her.  “I will pay ten percent more than list.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ten percent?” Her voice quavered and Draco smiled smugly.  Greed was a language he spoke fluently.  “Alright, Mr. Malfoy, I will sell you the house, for ten percent above list on one condition.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What is that?” he asked, leaning back in the chair and crossing his legs, the warm satisfaction of a winning deal washing over him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You hire someone to investigate and exorcise the house of it’s…problem,” she said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Done,” he smirked and leaned forward, extending his hand which she shook firmly.  </p>

</center>Draco sat on the sofa of his penthouse London flat and stared at the screen of his laptop.  He loved muggle technology, a quirk that drove his father crazy, mainly because every time his father touched an electronic device it wouldn’t function.  He couldn’t count how many gadgets his father had fried or hexed over the years.  He had finally decided to leave the electronics to Draco, content to watch his son work the gadgets over his shoulder.<p> </p>
<p> He was scrolling through a list of paranormal researchers searching for someone to “clear” the house so he could close on the property.  He had wanted badly to use the confundus charm on the old woman, or the imperius so she would just sign the blasted deal and be done with it but the ministry had laws against performing magic on muggles and he didn’t need them breathing down his neck. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Charlatans,” he muttered, navigating his way through website after website of people claiming to be able to “exorcise” ghosts and demons.  They didn’t need ‘exorcising’, ghosts were harmless and most of the time preferred to be left alone.  Hell the ones in Malfoy Manor rarely left the south wing which was rarely used.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He found a listing of the top rated researchers in the field, he didn’t bother searching through the list, he clicked on the top rated name and sent the information to print, using his wand to accio the document to him from his home office.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“H.J.G Investigations,” he read. “London address…not too far from the Leaky Cauldron…perfect.”</p>
