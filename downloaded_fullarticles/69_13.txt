    <p>Chapter 1- Discovery</p><p> </p><p>July 25, 1936</p><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle sat alone along the shore, trying to stay out of sight.</p><p> </p><p>The staff of <strong>Wool’s Orphanage</strong> always made going to the Jersey Islands seem like a holiday, but for someone who had been born in the orphanage, Tom knew better.</p><p> </p><p>He knew that it was where creeps who cornered children of various ages and both genders congregated…</p><p> </p><p>With his chocolate coloured hair and vibrant maroon eyes, that flashed crimson when he was angry, Tom had become a sort of favourite. He was also pale and slight for his age…</p><p> </p><p>He despised being called ‘pretty’, he was never trotted out as adoptable due to his having been born to a presumed ‘nun’. Tom was mature enough to know that when it was attributed to his mother, it did not mean anyone associated with a proper church, but rather someone who worked for a brothel. His father was presumed to be a client, he was often taunted by the other children for that.</p><p> </p><p>Regardless of the truth, given that he was born in an orphanage, Tom had little worth. His only use was to be used to ‘entertain’ prospective and current donors. He was hidden away in the cellar with the others that weren’t considered ‘adoptable’.</p><p> </p><p>Tom was hiding in the pile of rocks; he’d rather be beaten later then found by some of the guests of their host.</p><p> </p><p>Officially, they were staying at the orphanage nearby, but their transportation was on a yacht belonging to a prominent politician. Tom had the misfortune to be one of the creep’s favourites…</p><p> </p><p>He just wished he could stay here or run away; at any rate, he didn’t have much to look forward to as he grew up.</p><p> </p><p>Tom learned to read only because some of their patrons liked to hear them sing or recite poetry. They learned just enough to be able to hold a job…</p><p> </p><p>Tom had been beaten for ‘stealing’ books and candles to read them by, but he loved learning. He had stolen a book from the yacht, he’d learn to steal if he wanted more of anything. Occasionally, he’d be paid for ‘entertaining’ a patron and he’d learn to hide it under a loose floorboard in his room. He had one of the smallest rooms, the only reason he had his own room was that he was whored out.</p><p> </p><p>Tom was curled up as small as possible and was soon enthralled with his stolen book.</p><p> </p><p>Then he heard the despised voice of their host, “Well, this is a fine place. Not quite the romantic place I would have chosen.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom flinched.</p><p> </p><p>“Now Tom, one would think that you were ungrateful. Come out of there.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom felt all of his fury at his being used by the adults in his life vibrating through him. He hissed, “<em>No! I wish that you would just go!”</em></p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>A snake appeared at Tom’s feet, “<em>Thou are a speaker?”</em></p><p> </p><p>Tom blinked at the dull green snake, he could see just the hint of a cream belly and some lines called ‘bars’ on its sides. <em>“Are you talking to me?”</em></p><p> </p><p>“Come out of there, Tom,” his loathed companion said softly, the whisper of a weapon being drawn could be heard, “it isn’t safe.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>The muggle has a weapon, speaker. Are you in danger?”</em></p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Tom knew that the weapon was meant for the snake, “<em>I think the man intends to injure you first and then me.”</em></p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Shall I leave you, speaker?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p><em>“Come, I will protect us,” </em>Tom said with more conviction then he truly felt.</p><p> </p><p>The snake slithered towards him, wrapping around his leg, coiling around his waist and slipping under his worn t-shirt.</p><p> </p><p>“Tom, why do you disobey me?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t wish to be your whore.” Tom snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re the son of one, you’re lucky to still be at <strong>Wool’s</strong>. Displease me and you’ll find yourself in a moly house servicing more men then you do now.” The politician said moving closer to Tom’s hiding place.</p><p> </p><p>Tom felt trapped; his choice of hiding place hadn’t seemed so before. He needed to get away…</p><p> </p><p>The air around him vibrated and there was a loud crack, louder than a gunshot.</p><p> </p><p>Then Tom found himself on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the sea. His tormentor nowhere near…</p><p> </p><p>Tom collapsed, shaking.</p><p> </p><p>What just happened?</p><p> </p><p align="center">XoooooooX</p><p> </p><p>Philip Gorlois Flitwick, better known as ‘Filius’ was on a yacht off the shore of an isle between Britain and France.</p><p> </p><p>With him was his wife Lady Victoria, formerly of the House of Parkinson and their son Daveth Caellum. Their yacht was crewed by a few werewolves and squibs, with his goblin ancestry (an open secret in the titled families), Filius was more understanding of their difficulties with finding and keeping employment. His grandfather lost a bet with a goblin who demanded the right to sire his firstborn… his father was blood adopted of course, but they were both still affected by the height of his father’s original sire. He was surprised that Lady Victoria had accepted his suit, his lack of the usually accepted attributes of one thought handsome had others laughing at his audacity. Despite being heir to a lordship and being born in a castle, his pointed ears and short stature had him called ‘the goblin’. He was often bullied and lived very much in the library during his time at Hogwarts. He had been a model Ravenclaw, becoming a prefect to his parents’ pleasure and represented Hogwarts in the junior duelling championships.</p><p> </p><p>As an adult wizard, he had competed internationally as a dueller, while pursuing both a Defence and Charms Mastery.</p><p> </p><p>Filius had lately been serving as a duelling tutor for Beauxbatons, while the heir to a title was not required to work, he wished to set a good example for his son. Even if his son was too young to understand the lesson…</p><p> </p><p>He sensed a large explosion of magic, as well as the loud clap of apparition. It felt as if it were an incident of accidental magic, he was a parent after all.</p><p> </p><p>He cast a notice-me-not charm on himself, after informing Victoria of course. Since Filius was heir to a seat on the Wizengamot and technically, a teacher; he felt that he ought to investigate. If a parent were present, then he would merely remind them of the International Statute of Secrecy.</p><p> </p><p>He used a broom because it was the best way across the water. It was too dangerous to apparate across large bodies of water and charms could levitate one but not truly enable a person to fly. He had tried to create one, but no luck yet. Filius followed the echo of the explosion, where he found a trembling boy who appeared to be about Daveth’s age with a snake darting out from under his shirt to hiss protectively.</p><p> </p><p>Filius clambered off the broom, stepping out from a stand of trees and dispelling his notice-me-not charm. “Are you alone, young man?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I have a snake.” The boy said defensively.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, is a parent with you?”</p><p> </p><p>“I have no parents. My mother died giving birth to me and I know nothing about my father.”</p><p> </p><p>“A guardian then?”</p><p> </p><p>“I live at an orphanage…”</p><p> </p><p>The boy seemed honest, though his eyes were darting about with fear.</p><p> </p><p>This boy had been mistreated…</p><p> </p><p>As a parent and someone bullied, Filius’ heart went out to the boy.</p><p> </p><p>He watched in surprise, as the boy and the snake seemed to communicate. Rather than being uneasy or disgusted, Filius found himself intrigued. It was a gift that was said to be the mark of Slytherin’s line…</p><p> </p><p>To Filius’ knowledge, the last of them were imprisoned for using Magic on Muggles and attacking a member of Magical Law Enforcement. The father died in Azkaban, the most infamous Wizarding prison under the authority of the International Council of Wizards. Filius was uncertain if the man’s son was released or not.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want then?”</p><p> </p><p>“I can tell that you have been mistreated, and you expect me to do the same.” Filius brushed his hair behind his ears, “I too have experienced such things for circumstances beyond my control.”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you?” the boy asked in childish curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>Filius suspected he was a Muggleborn; perhaps, the descendent of a squib born to the line of Slytherin. He was not offended since the boy meant no harm in his question. “You have read fairy tales?”</p><p> </p><p>The boy nodded, with wide eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“There is often some truth to such tales; through no fault of my own, I have some goblin ancestry,” Filius admitted honestly.</p><p> </p><p>“Goblins are real?” the boy whispered in awe.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you like to meet some?” Filius asked softly.</p><p> </p><p>“Could I?” the boy blurted out, then his eyes narrowed. “You’re teasing me…”</p><p> </p><p>“No, if you chose to come with me, my wife and I will have you as our guest for lunch. You seem to be of an age with our son. Perhaps, you would like to meet him.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“But first, I would like to know your name that I might introduce you properly mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tom Marvolo Riddle.” The boy, Tom said with a nervous tremble to his voice. “I am nine…”</p><p> </p><p>Marvolo? Wasn’t the last Lord Gaunt named Malvolio? No matter…</p><p> </p><p>Nine? Filius would have placed his age younger; clearly, this orphanage had not been feeding him properly either.</p><p> </p><p>Filius cancelled the charm on his broom, a fine <em>Silver Arrow</em> and leapt aboard it.</p><p> </p><p>“A broom?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you apparated. That was how I found you by tracing the echo of it. Unfortunately, it is dangerous to apparate over water and my family is on a yacht out there.”</p><p> </p><p>The mention of a yacht seemed to unnerve the boy…</p><p> </p><p>“What if I gave you a quick lesson? Then you could fly us…”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?”</p><p> </p><p>Filius hoped the boy had no near relations, he quite wished to treat the boy with kindness. Hopefully, the fact that the boy was a parseltongue would charm Victoria…</p><p> </p><p>Filius gave the boy a quick lesson, quietly registering that the boy stiffened or trembled when he was touched. Once the boy seemed confident enough, he gave Tom directions to where <strong><em>Cerridwen</em></strong> was moored.</p><p> </p><p>They found Victoria supervising Daveth as he played with his paints, she glanced at them and frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“Filius, I thought you were merely going to investigate.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was until I found a mistreated Muggleborn parseltongue.”</p><p> </p><p>“How do you know he is a parseltongue? It is a rare gift and thought lost to us…” Victoria mused.</p><p> </p><p>“He has a snake, anwylyd.” Filius said quietly, “A grass snake, no doubt native to the island. They were communicating when I arrived.”</p><p> </p><p>“There are none that would miss him?”</p><p> </p><p>“No one of any worth,” Tom said stiffly.</p><p> </p><p>Daveth turned at their voices, “Tad, who is this?”</p><p> </p><p>“This is my friend Tom; he is going to stay with us for a while,” Filius said as he squeezed Tom’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Daveth nodded, “Would you like to paint with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Tom blinked in obvious shock, “You… want me to play with you?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m Daveth Caellum Flitwick and I’m going to be six soon.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom swallowed, “I’ll be nine in December…”</p><p> </p><p>Filius gently gave Tom a nudge, so he would join Daveth before perching on a stool beside Victoria.</p><p> </p><p>With practised ease, he cast a silencing charm.</p><p> </p><p>“You do realize, you might be accused of kidnapping.” Victoria frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“He apparated out of fear, anwylyd.” Filius said quietly. “He expects me to hurt him…”</p><p> </p><p>Victoria scoffed, “Clearly, he has much to learn.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wish to take him to Gringotts to have them test him. If he has no close relations,”</p><p> </p><p>“You wish to adopt him.” Victoria sighed, “If he is a parseltongue and has been mistreated, he deserves better then to languish in the Muggle World until he is eleven.”</p><p> </p><p>“While it is too soon to be sure, it is unlikely that Daveth will be a Slytherin.” Filius teased.</p><p> </p><p>“Yet, a young parseltongue who might be a descendant of a squib from Salazar’s line would be.” Victoria mused.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you feel his magic? It is strong, to apparate untrained at eight…”</p><p> </p><p>“If he has no close relations and you see to it that he is legally adopted or otherwise disappears from the Muggle World, I have no objections.”</p><p> </p><p>Victoria wandlessly widened her chaise and pat the space beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Filius cancelled his privacy charm and summoned a book before joining her.</p><p> </p><p>While they might be thought a comical couple due to their height difference, they had stood strong against their distractors.</p><p> </p><p align="center">XooooooooX</p><p> </p><p>Filius and Victoria ate with their son Daveth and their current ward, putting them both to bed in Daveth’s room.</p><p> </p><p>The boy seemed quite nervous but was obviously surprised when Daveth offered to share his bed and was treated to a bedtime story.</p><p> </p><p>Victoria was less demonstrative of her affection than her husband, she was a former Slytherin after all. But she noticed the boy’s wet eyes as he sat on Filius’ left opposite of Daveth as her husband read them the tale of <strong>The Wizard and The Hopping Pot</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>The boy had been surprised when the bath was prepared, and they were left to play. Before that, he had been served the same amount of steak and kidney pie as Daveth. Despite being a bit older, Tom was a quiet observant boy who didn’t complain about wearing Daveth’s clothes.</p><p> </p><p>If he had no suitable relations, then Victoria intended to take him to <strong>Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions </strong>for a proper wardrobe. After all, it would be two years before Daveth would graduate to trousers from knee shorts. It was customary for such a milestone to occur when a boy turned eight after all and by his own admission, Tom was eight.</p><p> </p><p>Once the boys were tucked in, Filius kissed their foreheads and Victoria patted their heads. The lumos-chandelier dimmed as they left the room.</p><p> </p><p>They would dock in Plymouth tomorrow morning, Daveth and herself would portkey to Flitwick Castle while Filius would take Tom to Diagon Alley to meet with the goblins.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
