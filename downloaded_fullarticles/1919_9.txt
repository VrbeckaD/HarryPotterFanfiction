  <strong>I Paperchase</strong>
</p><p>“Mind if I sit here?”<br/> Hermione looked suspiciously at Pansy. She tried to smile, but it looked studied and not a bit honest. Still, she appreciated a try.<br/> “Of course not,” she answered, biting her tongue before she asked why Pansy didn’t sit at any of the other vacant tables. She promised Harry she would be polite, even if it was a bit hard after a day at work. “What are you doing here?”<br/> “Working on an article.” She sat in front of Hermione with her plate of salad. “Are you okay? You look pale.”<br/> Hermione burned her tongue with a tea she took a sip of to stop herself from a rude comment.</p><p>She should have predicted it. It seemed odd, she must admit, that suddenly Pansy was at the building where she had an office definitely more often than she had a sensible reason for, or that Harry and Draco happened to throw a party for the second time in three months and invite both of them. The fact that Pansy attempted to approach Hermione during these occasions and even be unusually polite seemed even more odd, considering they’ve barely seen each other since the end of the war.<br/> She was usually good at guessing peoples’ intentions. She was fairly sure Pansy wanted to change, and she appreciated the try. She knew it must be difficult to redeem yourself, change peoples’ opinion of you, and she wasn’t to try and make it more difficult for Pansy.<br/> A letter on her desk seemed almost offensive to her. It smelled like cigarettes, contrasting with an expensive looking paper it was written on and Pansy’s unnecessarily fancy, archaic and hard to decipher writing. Hermione leant to look at it again, massaging her temple.</p><p><em>Hermione,</em><br/><em> Excuse me for being blunt, but I want to keep this short and elaborate tomorrow if you agree to meet with me.</em><br/> (Of course, Hermione would meet with her. She would have probably died of curiosity, if she did not find out what Pansy wants to elaborate on.)<br/> <em>I have an interesting proposition for you, I would describe it - business and culture related. It may not seem interesting, put that way, but I sincerely hope you would give me a chance. Please meet me at Rosalie’s Birds cafe tomorrow at five, if you decide on listening to my offer.</em><br/><em> Pansy</em></p><p>
  <strong>II Hostile territory</strong>
</p><p>The cafe was dim, candles being the only source of light, and smelled like incense and cinnamon. The wooden floor creaked under Hermione’s feet as she walked slowly, searching for Pansy. She saw her sitting in the corner on a leather sofa, with a cup in her hand resting on her crossed legs. She raised her head as Hermione approached her and nodded.<br/> “Is that for me?” Hermione asked, pointing at the other cup of coffee on the table. Pansy nodded. “Thanks. Really nice spot, by the way.”<br/> “I mostly chose it so I wouldn’t feel like too much of a fool if you didn’t come,” admitted Pansy. “As you can see, usual guests here are sort of freaky, if you don’t mind the expression.”<br/> Hermione snorted and glanced at the room. Pansy was right; people at other tables seemed to caught up in their own world to pay attention to their surroundings.<br/> “So if you did, I figured I would just give the other coffee to Rosalie and listen to her speak about poetry for some time.”<br/> “Oh, so you know the owner?”<br/> “Yes, she’s the witch behind the bar. She is actually really lovely, I met her while working in Poland. Never would have guessed I would be able to genuinely like someone like her.” Pansy shook her head and put a cup on a table. She had long nails painted dark, flaring with lights reminding Hermione of stars. “But I know, Hermione,” she continued, and addressing Hermione by her actual name seemed so strange for her she wanted to repeat it in every sentence, “you’re not here for a chat. I know you were never interested in this kind of thing, but I figured I could at least try, right?”<br/> “I’m listening,” Hermione said, smiling warmly.<br/> Pansy thought briefly, that Hermione should not be this polite to her. She would have rather Hermione be a little rude, it only seemed fair after years of being horrible. Draco told her about it; how bad he felt for all those years of treating Harry badly and how he wanted to confront him about it, but every time it did it went wrong, with Harry either comforting Draco when he shouldn’t or having a fit. Pansy definitely didn’t feel like having either of those anytime in the future.<br/> At least, she figured, she did not live in a house, where either Hermione or one of her close friends nearly lost a life.<br/> “I wanted to write your biography. You’re one of the most significant witches in today’s politics, but also, as you can probably see, one of the only witches, period. And as much as I hate giving compliments, you’re really, unusually smart and powerful, especially for someone so young.” Hermione wrinkled her nose slightly. Pansy thought through how to approach her, yet now she lost her confidence. She felt stupid to even come up with this idea. “What I mean, people know hardly anything about you, except that you helped Harry save the world, and I think you shouldn’t be left in peoples’ memory as just his help.”<br/> “I’m not going to take more credit than I deserve,” Hermione said, frowning. “I didn’t sacrifice and didn't suffer nearly as much as Harry.”<br/> “That’s not what I had in mind, you know that,” Pansy said, hating Gryffindor's righteousness. “I know you don’t do interviews, but I hoped maybe you would consider this.”<br/> “But why did you think I would agree to you, if I refused to exactly everybody until this point?”<br/> Pansy looked at her; Hermione looked tired. She had dark circles under her eyes and she was unhealthily pale. Her red jumper was slightly too big and her collarbone stuck out of it.<br/> “Because you know they would either make you a war hero and put you in bronze, or try to find the smallest detail to make a scandal,” she answered casually.<br/> “A moment ago it seemed you would do just that,” she sighed and shook her head. “So how do I know you won’t do that?”<br/> “Draco would be very mad,” she answered with a smirk, ignoring her first remark. Hermione snorted. “And you can be sure I will not glorify you.”<br/> Hermione leaned on the sofa and finished her coffee. “I can’t promise you anything.”<br/> But Pansy knew from the look on her face, she would at least think about it.</p><p>
  <strong>III A sheep</strong>
</p><p>Pansy looked on a silver otter, which just arrived next to the bowl of her yogurt. It jumped around playfully, announcing with Hermione’s voice that Pansy is expected to please come to Rosalie’s cafe at five, then slowly changed into a sparkling mist in the air.<br/> She smiled and continued to read a newspaper, but concentrating on an article about her distant uncle’s bookshop and its financial problems suddenly became extremely difficult. She put it aside, noting in her head to lie to her mum she really had read it, and stared at the window, trying to come up with a plan to approach Hermione.<br/> She had a plan for this book, although it only existed in her head. She didn’t really expect Hermione to agree, thus it was more of a vague idea. Pansy would’ve had to improvise and see where the story gets them, but she didn’t worry about that at all. It had worked for her so far.</p><p>This time it was Hermione who waited for Pansy in the same place. She had bought a coffee for her - Pansy felt badly immediately. She should have been there earlier and she shouldn’t have let Hermione buy anything for her. Not only was she the one doing Pansy favour, but also Hermione was struggling financially. Even if Pansy didn’t know, she only needed a glance at her clothes, the same worn-out jumper as the day before and faded black chino.<br/> She also knew better than to say anything about it. Draco used to get so mad at her when she didn’t want to let him pay for her food, even though he was on the verge of bankruptcy and she inherited enough money to buy the whole restaurant. Hermione probably wouldn’t go as far as he did, but she didn’t want to try her.<br/> “I was a bit early,” Hermione said and moved on a sofa to make a place for Pansy. “I didn’t know how long it would take me to get here, so I left work a bit too early.”<br/> “You don’t have to do that, I would wait.”<br/> “I don’t like being late.” Pansy figured. “So, how do you see it?”<br/> “I thought we could start with your childhood and go through your life, but I guess we should concentrate on your work after the war.” Pansy looked down, losing her courage, but she tried not to let Hermione know. She knew it would be hard to talk about the time of the war when she herself didn’t do a single thing to help. “Because I figured it’s important for you.”<br/> Hermione looked pleased; Pansy knew that look, getting ready to talk about the work that inspires you. Hermione loved the idea.<br/> Pansy pressed a button on a recorder sitting next to her. Hermione looked at it surprised; she didn’t expect Pansy to use muggle devices. She cleared her throat and hesitated for a moment before she started talking about her childhood. How she was sick all her childhood, at home all the time with her books and grandma and her grandma’s lovely stories; she liked the real ones especially. She told Pansy about her favorite story, how her grandma met her granddad in a diner where she had worked and how he would come there every day, both of them too shy to talk to each other. One day he didn’t come at his usual hour and she waited for him, worried to her death, and an hour before closing the place he arrived, all soaked from the pouring rain, and her grandma jumped on her feet, exclaiming too loudly “oh my dear, where have you been, I’ve been worrying sick!” before realizing what she had just done. That was their first interaction besides ordering coffee and a pie, but it worked fine.<br/> Hermione was looking absently at the wall in front of her; she doubted Pansy was interested in her grandma’s stories and was only grateful that she didn’t interrupt her, but to her surprise when she looked at Pansy’s face, she saw her smiling under her lowered head.<br/> She told her about the kids at her school. First about her friend, a Japanese boy who liked books just as much as her, and how sad she was to leave him, knowing well he didn’t have friends beside her. They didn’t keep in touch, but it was probably only for the better for him - she kept that part for herself, though. (Hermione tugged at her hair absently; they were short now, a bit messy, but Pansy thought she looked pretty, child-like with her bare face and rust-colored freckles). She told Pansy about kids at school calling her a squirrel and laughed, the bitter tone in her voice.<br/> “How was leaving your parents for Hogwarts?”<br/> “Oh, you know,” she started, her eyes drifting upwards, looking at the ceiling as if she was looking for a way to explain it in the fluorescent fireflies drawn there. “Difficult, of course, but I think I was quite mature for my age... Too mature, maybe, and thrilled to find people like me. And I loved my parents, still do, but I was only eleven and they already haven’t had the slightest idea how to talk with me. Maybe it was only for the best I left them, it was so much easier for them to like me when we didn’t see each other that often.”<br/> Pansy nodded. She didn’t want to pry; it wasn’t that important, maybe even better to omit this.<br/> “I missed my grandma a lot.”</p><p>
  <strong>IV A fool</strong>
</p><p>Pansy reached to grab her toe, one bare foot on the cold floor. She heard the door creak and straightened to look in the mirror, resting her hands on the railing and putting the leg down. She didn’t turn around when she saw her mum come in and point her wand at the piano, silencing the music. She held back the urge to sigh.<br/> “I’ve only just started.”<br/> “We have guests.” Her mum folded her hands. “They would appreciate it if you joined us, Pansy. Time to leave your cave for some time and visit your parents, I would love to see you more often, considering we live under the same roof.”<br/> Pansy paved the last sentence over. “Do I know them at least?” She saw her mum furrow her brows, still standing in the door. “I’ll come.”<br/> Her mother’s heels clattered on the marble floor; Pansy waited until she couldn’t hear the sound any longer before dropping her suddenly really heavy head in her hands.</p><p>
  <strong>V The mightiest hero</strong>
</p><p>“Eat this.”<br/> “And what’s that?”<br/> Ron shifted the package in neon pink, suspiciously glowing paper closer to her. She pulled at the white ribbon to reveal a few cookies in the shape of fairies. “Luna sent it to me,” he laughed after seeing her uncertain look. “Don’t worry, I already ate some, they’re good. She says they bring you luck, but I’m not so sure if she is serious or if it’s a metaphor.”<br/> “Questionable,” she said, taking the cookie in her hand; it smelled like gingerbread. “But I wouldn’t mind some luck.”<br/> “What are you doing?” She closed the thick folder laying on the desk in front of her.<br/> “Nothing important,” she said. Ron didn’t look convinced. He raised one eyebrow and looked at her with worry and she knew well, she shouldn’t have been sitting there at eleven at night if it was nothing important. She doubted it would help if she told him it really is, she just didn’t want to come home yet. “Studying, really.”<br/> “Aren’t you done with studying already?” Ron opened the file and flicked through this. “You’ve been working on those werewolf rights for six years already, I think it doesn’t matter if you come home early and finish it a day later.”<br/> Hermione gave him a tired smile. “And for six years they haven’t wanted to hear a word from me about it.” She propped her head with a shoulder. “You would think actual facts would be quite convincing.”<br/> Ron ruffled her hair, hand sinking in her soft, short curls, and sighed. “Come on, just go home. I can give you some soup.”<br/> Her stomach rumbled; the muffin she had eaten for lunch seemed like a distant memory now, as she realized she had forgotten to eat once again, stars appearing before her eyes as she got up from her chair abruptly. She shot Ron a grateful look when he held her elbow firmly and apparated both of them to his flat.<br/> It smelled like curry and oil and obscure restaurant. She fell asleep on his old couch before Ron even started heating the food and ate the soup for breakfast.</p>
