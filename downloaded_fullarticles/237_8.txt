    <p>Chapter 1 – Porcelain</p><p> </p><p>My name is Isabella Swann. I am 18 years old. And I am more lost then any human has a right to be.</p><p>Wait ,hold on! I’m not doing this right. There probably isn’t a correct way, but it feels wrong. So I will try something clichéd. God knows, my life back then feels like a fairy tale now.</p><p>Once open a time ,in a different world , there was a rainy town ,called Forks. Much rainier then the one in this world anyway, I visited it , along with Italy. Here there is no such thing as the Cullens, or even sparkly Vampires. But I’m getting ahead of myself. In that town of Forks a bratty girl child named Bella Swann lived. The girl had moved in one and a half years ago , and was going to get married soon. She was going to marry the Vampire man of her dreams, Edward Cullen, and live happily forever after with his family.</p><p>She had no idea what was coming her way. But, hindsight is fifty fifty, I suppose</p>
