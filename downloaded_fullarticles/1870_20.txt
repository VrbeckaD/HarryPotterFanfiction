    <p> </p><p>Potter was nothing like any one was expecting him to be. He was a good head shorter than the other first years for starters, and his shoulder length hair reminded Severus more of Lily than James, no matter how the colour matched the boy’s father’s. He was pale, almost sickly looking, enough to rival even himself, another stark difference from his parents. Whilst James Potter had always been rather tanned from the sun, and Lily Evans had been pale but healthy, their son seemed to be on death’s door. A further difference was the child’s lack of eyewear, letting his emerald eyes be clearly seen. There was a stiffness to them, a cold edge. Pain. It was startling to see.</p><p>The biggest difference came when the boy sorted into Slytherin, and many students caused an uproar that had to be silenced by Dumbledore setting off a small explosion. It stunned the students into silence, and sent Potter running for the Slytherin table like the hounds of hell were after him. An understandable thing since it had gone off over his head. His wide terrified eyes were not. Severus could see the child better now that he was closer, and he wasn’t sure what to think about him.</p><p>It took a few moments for everyone to calm themselves enough for the sorting to continue, and Harry Potter curled in on himself, like he wished he could simply vanish into the aether. For someone raised with the best of everything, pampered like a prince, this behaviour was rather odd.  Draco Malfoy attempted to slide down the bench towards Potter, but Parkinson’s hand on his arm pulled him to a pouting halt. </p><p>The feast began and normal chatter resumed, but Severus kept his eye on the Potter boy. When the child looked up at him, he seemed scared, and quickly looked away, going back to picking at his food. He didn’t eat much, and it mostly seemed to be vegetables, though Severus watched him tear apart a bread roll. Perhaps he was vegetarian? </p><p>The feast came to an end and the houses led the first years back to their common rooms. Severus watched the boy twiddle his fingers on the edge of a couch, nervous for whatever reason. Malfoy was next to him, looking smug, probably for the best right now. If the Malfoy’s took an interest in Potter, he’d be better protected in his dorms. </p><p>He gave his usual welcoming speech and headed back to his own private rooms for the night, he could deal with whatever fallout there was in the morning.</p><p>By the time he got to the Great Hall for breakfast, things had already taken a turn for the worse.</p><p>He reached the doors to find Potter sprawled on the floor, the Weasley boy and a few others from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff around him. Weasley’s fists were bloodied, and Potter seemed to have a broken nose and split lip. McGonagall was already berating her lions, passing out detentions and point loss like Honeyduke’s chocolates. </p><p>As he approached Minerva gave him a terse smile, and explained how Weasley had attacked Potter without cause. The glare he sent the red-haired boy made him blanche and look away. Potter sat up and made to stand, but Severus crouched next to him, pulling out his wand to heal him. As he put his hand out to halt Potter’s movements, the boy flinched and froze, as though he expected Severus to pick up where Weasley had stopped. He ignored it as he quickly cast the spells to set and heal Potter’s nose and lip. He even cleaned his face and clothes, much to the surprise of the small boy. He had seemed resigned to the pain and blood.</p><p>So as to not appear to be taking too much interest in the ‘Boy-Who-Lived’, Severus swept away after that, and got on with his breakfast. He didn’t so much as glance at the Slytherin table until it was time to hand out the class schedules. </p><p>He dreaded the first class. Slytherin and Gryffindor first years. Now with added Potter spawn…</p><p>He arrived to find Potter already waiting by the door, Potions textbook right in front of his face, squinting hard. Perhaps the boy did need glasses? It mattered not, the boy was not his responsibility. Perhaps he could write a letter to his guardians suggesting he be taken for an eye exam though. Considering the advances in Potions in the last decade, there might even be one that would fix his sight completely. </p><p>He let the child in, not looking at him, and swept to the front of the room. Quickly setting up the board with the potion they would be taught, and pulling out the homework sheets to set them neatly on his desk, took bare moments. His routine was perfected. The other students began to arrive and took their seats, his snakes with more silence and grace for certainty. Malfoy joined Potter at the front of the class, and the pair whispered to each other for a second before turning their attention to their professor.</p><p>Longbottom causing an explosion was surely a sign of things to come in this class, and Severus started to dread the rest of the year. No, the next seven years. </p><p>The following morning brought a distraught Malfoy to his side during breakfast, claiming that Potter had not returned to his dorm that night. Severus dismissed him, stating that Potter was bound to show up for classes and that he’d probably been homesick, or off causing trouble in the castle at night, just like his father. Malfoy didn’t seem convinced, but let it go and returned to his meal.</p><p>When it came to dinner time and Potter still hadn’t shown up, Severus knew he had to find the boy himself. Minerva had been shooting glares at him and was certain to go into one of her rants if she got him alone. He finished up as quickly as he was able without looking the fool, and headed out of the hall.</p><p>A quick Point-Me spell had him headed for the dungeons, towards the Slytherin common room. He must have retreated there after skipping class all day. Of this Severus was certain… until his wand let him past the entrance. He walked deeper into the dungeons, and down a tiny spiral stair, into a short hallway with only one door.</p><p>It was barred from the outside with a heavy metal bar.</p><p>Severus moved quickly, removing the bar and unlocking the door. Pushing it open, he saw nothing but darkness. From the light of his wand, what he saw horrified him.</p><p>Strung up by his wrists, facing the wall, at least a good foot off the floor, was Harry Potter’s limp body. He was covered in blood, the floor, the walls. Saturated. Someone had whipped the boy’s back to shreds, his robes, jumper and shirt with it. On the floor, in the drippings of red, lay a long barbed whip. </p><p>With a soft cry Severus darted forwards, he released Potter’s arms and cradled his tiny form gently. He was so cold and limp… Fearing the worst, Severus cast a diagnostic charm to tell him if the child was dead.</p><p>Faintly, but still present, his life-force flickered against the charm.</p><p>Severus hurried towards the infirmary, sealing the room to anyone but himself, Potter in his arms. When Poppy emerged from her office at the sound of his voice, she was shocked to see her patient in such a state, and immediately got to work. Severus gave what aid he could, but with the boy as weak as he was, neither were sure if he would live. </p><p>They worked for hours, spells and potions, again and again. Constantly monitoring the mostly dead child. When his heart beat by itself, and his lungs no longer needed aid, they could finally rest. If he made it through the night, he would survive. They both took turns watching over him until morning.</p><p>Come sunrise, Severus stirred from his position beside the bed, cursing at himself for falling asleep at such an important time. What he saw however, was nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>Emerald eyes squinted at him, full of pain still, but living.</p><p>This was the moment Severus Snape vowed to protect Harry Potter, from any and all who would harm him. </p><p>This was the moment the Light began to fall.</p>
