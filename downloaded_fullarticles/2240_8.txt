    <p>"Mum, get off!" Harry groaned as Lily continued pressing kisses over his face.</p>
<p>She lifted her head, smiling fondly at her son. "I'm sorry, Harry. We're just going to miss you, you know that."</p>
<p>"Remember to write to us," James added.</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>"Every day," Sirius piped up.</p>
<p>"I doubt Harry will have time to write every day," Lily pointed out.</p>
<p>"I see Ron," Harry said, craning his head to get a better look at the taller boy.</p>
<p>"Well, we'll see you during the holidays, Prongslet," James said.</p>
<p>"I'll miss you." Harry hugged his parents and godfather happily before running off to join Ron.</p>
<p>"I wonder which house he'll be in," Lily mused.</p>
<p>"Gryffindor, obviously," Sirius said automatically.</p>
<p>"He hardly gets into the same kind of trouble you two have, even with your encouragement," Lily said, giving them both a hard stare.</p>
<p>James and Sirius grinned at her sheepishly. "Whoops."</p>
<p>"Honestly, you two are grown men. Act like it."</p>
<p>"Where's the fun in that?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Are you ready?" Ron said as he and Harry sat down in a compartment.</p>
<p>"You bet," Harry said. "I can't wait to see Uncle Moony again."</p>
<p>"Me, neither. Hey, want to play chess?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>Harry had never won a single game against Ron when it came to chess, but he still enjoyed every second of it. Today was no different.</p>
<p>"Checkmate," Ron said after ten minutes.</p>
<p>"Darn," Harry said, pouting, before brightening up. "Again!"</p>
<p>The compartment door opened as they were playing their third game. "So it's true?" the blonde boy said upon seeing Harry. "Harry Potter is starting this year."</p>
<p>Harry beamed. "Yep! And you are?"</p>
<p>"Malfoy. Draco Malfoy."</p>
<p>Ron coughed slightly, and Draco whipped his head around. "Think my name's funny, do you?" he said more harshly. "No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford." He turned back to Harry. "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."</p>
<p>He held out his hand.</p>
<p>Harry looked between Ron and Draco, clearly torn. "Can't we all be friends?" he asked. His mother had taught him not to judge someone based on their blood status, family, or house.</p>
<p>Both other boys looked taken aback.</p>
<p>"I mean, who says I can only have one friend?" Harry went on. "So, Draco, I will accept your friendship if you promise not to be mean." He looked at Ron. "That means you have to be nice, too."</p>
<p>"Fine," Ron said. Draco nodded in reluctant agreement.</p>
<p>"Great." Harry yanked Draco down on the seat next to him. "You can sit with us."</p>
<p>The trolley witch came around, and Harry bought a little of everything. "Here," he said, holding out a chocolate frog to Ron.</p>
<p>Ron looked surprise. "Really?" he said hopefully.</p>
<p>"Friends share."</p>
<p>Grinning, Ron set down the sandwich his mother had packed him and took it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A tearful Neville Longbottom opened the door. "Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?"</p>
<p>Ron and Draco shook their heads.</p>
<p>"I'll help you look," Harry offered.</p>
<p>Neville brightened. "Okay."</p>
<p>They returned moments later, toad in Neville's hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They arrived at Hogwarts and were taken to the Great Hall for the Sorting ceremony.</p>
<p>Neville was Sorted into Gryffindor, while Draco went to Slytherin. Harry came shortly after and practically skipped up to the stool.</p>
<p>"Well, well. Look who we have here," the hat said.</p>
<p>"Hello," Harry chirped.</p>
<p>The hat chuckled. "Aren't you just chipper this morning?"</p>
<p>Harry most definitely was; everyone could practically taste his excitement.</p>
<p>"Hmm... A thirst for knowledge, ambition to do well, making friends already. I believe you would do best in- HUFFLEPUFF."</p>
<p>Gryffindor looked a bit disappointed that the savior of the wizarding world wasn't in their house, but they cheered nevertheless. Hufflepuff was giving Harry a standing ovation.</p>
<p>Harry sat down next to Susan Bones, who beamed at him. "Guess we're housemates," she said.</p>
<p>"Yep!" Harry grinned. He looked up at the staff table. Dumbledore's eyes were twinkling, Sprout was trying to recover from her shock, and Remus was smiling at Harry, who returned it happily.</p>
<p>Ron was among the last few first years to be Sorted; he joined Neville in Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Dumbledore gave a few announcements before food appeared on the tables.</p>
<p>"I don't think anyone expected to see you in Hufflepuff," Ernie Macmillan said.</p>
<p>"Me, neither," Harry said. "But, honestly, I don't really care what house I'm in. I just want to do well."</p>
<p>"That's a good attitude to have," Justin Finch-Fletchley said. "What do you think your parents will say?"</p>
<p>"Knowing my dad and Sirius, they'll probably have heart attacks," Harry said with a laugh. This was going to be a great seven years, he could feel it.</p>
