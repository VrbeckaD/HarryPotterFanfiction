    <p>Scorpius Malfoy found out that his best friend, Albus Severus Potter, was gay on accident at the end of their seventh year. </p><p>Exams were over, and the Slytherin students had thrown a party in the common room to celebrate. There were students from Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw that had come by and there was music and plenty of firewhiskey to go around. </p><p>Scorpius had only had a few sips of firewhiskey. Unlike Albus, who had become moderately buzzed within the first hour, he didn’t particularly enjoy the taste or effects of alcohol. Scorpius was having a pleasant conversation about exams with the Head Girl, Hannah, who seemed to be the only other sober person at the party, while Albus was carelessly dancing along to the music.</p><p>Sometimes Scorpius envied Albus’ casualness, and his ability to adapt to new situations with ease. Scorpius was almost always an anxious mess, and would never be able to dance so carelessly in front of so many people. To Scorpius’ surprise, it wasn’t long before Albus was pressed up against another boy, Scorpius knew to be in Ravenclaw. He was in their year and he was tall with light brown hair. They were dancing all pressed up against one another one minute and the next they were snogging, right in the middle of the common room, in front of dozens of students. Scorpius seemed to be the only one who cared. Other students gave a glance or two in their direction and then went back to their conversations and drinks, while Scorpius froze with his mouth open, completely forgetting about what he had been about to say to Hannah. </p><p>Something felt wrong. His stomach churned and he knew he had to leave the common room. He turned away and pushed his way through the crowd of other students and raced down the stairs towards the dormitories and the bathroom. Though he had only had half a glass of firewhiskey, it came up with the rest of the contents of his stomach. He didn’t know how long he kneeled there on the bathroom floor, retching until there was nothing left. </p><p>As he sat there, kneeling on the bathroom floor, he wondered why Albus had never told him about such an important part of his life. Sure, Albus had never exactly been enthusiastic about any girls at school, but boys? Scorpius wasn’t jealous. He was just surprised, no-shocked was more like it. And he felt betrayed. How could Albus not have told him? All those years and Albus hadn’t even mentioned it? </p><p>After nearly falling asleep on the floor, he brushed his teeth and decided he felt well enough to make his way to his bed. As he was undressing, Albus came into the dormitory. It looked like he had sobered up a little bit and upon seeing Scorpius he grinned and flopped down on his bed. </p><p>“Where’d you run off to?” Asked Albus absentmindedly, turning to look at his best friend. </p><p>“Got a bit sick,” muttered Scorpius, quickly throwing on his pajamas and climbing onto his own bed. </p><p>“From that half a glass of firewhiskey?” Albus gaped at him. </p><p>“Er- yeah,” he admitted. “How was the rest of the party?” He almost did not want to know the answer to this question, if he was being honest with himself. What if Albus and the Ravenclaw boy had gone further than kissing? </p><p>“Pretty good,” Albus grinned. “It kinda started clearing out a few minutes ago. I’m exhausted.” </p><p>If Albus didn’t want to tell him that he had been making out with another boy right in front of their entire year, then that was that. Apparantly he didn’t trust Scorpius, his best friend of nearly seven years now, with the fact that he was gay. Did he think Scorpius would never find out? Or be uncomfortable?</p><p>“I saw you,” Scorpius blurted out before he could stop himself. “I saw you kissing that bloke from Ravenclaw in front of everyone. I know you think I didn’t see you but I did.” Scorpius turned onto his side so he was facing away from Albus and was about to close the curtains to his bed when Albus spoke up.</p><p>“Score-” Albus began. Scorpius sat up and looked at Albus. </p><p>“You really didn’t trust me enough to tell me you fancy guys?” Scorpius spat, his face heating up. He hated confrontation, and he always did everything in his power to avoid fighting, especially with Albus. But he plowed on this time. “I’m your best friend.”</p><p>“I know Score…” said Albus, turning onto his back and looking up at the ceiling. “I think it was just...easier, you know? Making out with some random boy in front of people that I barely know. Whose opinions I don’t care about. I’m hardly going to see any of those people in a few days. But you...Score what you think matters to me,” Albus turned onto his side, facing Scorpius and giving him a hard look. “It sounds silly, but we’ve been friends for so long that I think I was afraid...that this would change everything between us. That you would see me differently or something.” </p><p>“Albus, you’re still my best friend,” Scorpius said quietly, feeling like a bit of an arse after yelling at him like that. “This isn’t going to change anything,” Scorpius promised him. </p><p>On the contrary, as soon as the boys moved in together, it changed everything.</p>
