    <b>Dragon Wings and Flying Things:</b>
  </em>
</p><p>Floundering/clueless Godfather!Harry is adorable, Teddy is wonderful and BAMF!Draco just the best. Loved the inclusion of Charlie Weasley as a good, understanding friend. And who could resist putting dragons into a banner? Not me!</p><p>Speaking of the dragons ... the one in banner #1 is actually a Hungarian Horntail, and the one in banner #2 a Ukrainian Ironbelly (according to the Harrypotter Wikia). I just loved the colours, the shapes and general looks. I hope you'll forgive me? At least the one on the collage is the right species ...</p><p>Also, I regret that I couldn't find pictures I liked for either Charlie Weasley or (more importantly) Teddy Lupin, who's integral to the story. My graphic skills weren't up to changing a random person's hair colour, so I decided to go with what I actually <em>could</em> do.</p><p>Banner #1</p><p> </p>

</center><b>In the Middle of a Mystery</b><p>What I liked about this story was the post-apocalyptic feel, even though that's usually not my cup of tea at all. There were shades of the Camping Trip o'Hell® from DH, but with your own, unique spin; the desperation and bleakness of the characters and situation come through very well. And the slow burn of the burgeoning relationship between Harry and Draco is wonderfully drawn in a way that makes me want to read more in that particular universe. *hint, hint?*</p><p>Banner 4</p>
