    <p>After years spent researching the oldest eastern magic, living in the almost-forgotten places of China and more recently India; Atticus Potter felt his homesickness become unbearable. He longed to be in the easy comfort of his younger brother James’ company, not having seen him since he went into first year. He missed his parents’ support and strong love and decided he’d finish his research early and head home, and see his loved ones once again. The matter of not receiving a letter in a few years concerned him greatly.</p>
<p>Atticus knew a certain discretion would be required in his unexpected return home, he didn’t wish for his family to find out from some random neighbour that so-and-so had spotted him. He had the tell-tale Potter looks after all; untamable black hair, short on the sides yet curly long on top, tanned skin-though slightly darker than James’ after years in the strong eastern sun and of course, the sharp aristocratic face.</p>
<p>He had to take four portkeys in total to return to Britain which left him so queasy he had to find a inn that would take him for the night. He found one not to far from where the portkey had taken him to, a town that was near enough to the Potter estate. He tried to control his nausea as he made his way to the innkeeper in hopes that he could collapse into a bed soon.</p>
<p>“Are ye alrigh’? Yer lookin’ mighty green in the face,” Atticus looked to the woman who asked, who was standing beside the innkeeper’s desk who had one arm hesitantly stretched out towards him, a worried expression on her face. Atticus smiled as best he could in an attempt to calm her.</p>
<p>“Thank you, but I only need a bed for the night and perhaps a breakfast in the morning and I’ll be okay,” she happily gave him a room and he went to bed, exhaustion creeping into his bones.</p>
<p>The next morning after feeling much better, Atticus found a dark empty alley to apparate to the gates of the Potter mansion. After the swirling sensation of apparation finally stopped and let him see the mansion before him, Atticus gasped. Gone were the perfect white walls of the mansion and the pristine garden that was lovingly attended to. In its place were grimy, grey walls and a wild garden overrun by weeds. Atticus stepped forward in shock, passing through the gates and wards easily. He realised with a shock that the wards had accepted him as the true owner, not as the heir.</p>
<p>Atticus couldn’t contain himself as he ran up the path to the house, which seemed to stretch on for miles. He pushed the door open forcefully, coughing heavily as the movement disturbed layers upon layers of dust that had settled. He looked around in horror as the house, his home hadn’t seen a living person in years. A sudden thought came to him then, <em> the house elves. </em></p>
<p>“Ruby!” He called, praying she’d answer. A sudden pop made him jump, Ruby appearing before him. He felt a strong pang of guilt as he took in her once young features that were now gaunt, her pillowcase fraying and brown.</p>
<p>“Master Atticus! You’re alive!” She wailed, large tears threatening to spill from her eyes. She took a cautious step forward, looking at Atticus as if she didn’t believe he was real. Atticus felt his throat tighten as he knelt in front of Ruby, guilt clawing his insides.</p>
<p>“Oh Ruby, if only I’d known,” He pulled her into a hug, Ruby stiffening at the unexpected touch. Atticus thought back to when he was a child, when Ruby would sneak sweets to him and a much younger James. How she would always help him hide that he broke something or playing with him when he was bored. He let her go and saw that she was crying hard.</p>
<p>“Master Atticus is always too kind to silly Ruby, too kind,” she rubbed violently at her eyes in an attempt to stop her crying.</p>
<p>“Ruby I’m so sorry I didn’t return sooner, but could you tell me what happened to Mother and Father, and where is James?” At his words Ruby started crying harder, loud sobs wracking her frail body.</p>
<p>“Oh Master horrible, horrible things! Master Fleamont, Master Fleamont he helped Mistress Euphemia best he could but he couldn’t-couldn’t help when it took her and then him-,” she couldn’t continue as large hiccups stopped her. Atticus sat back in shock, the barely legible words of the elf sinking in. He was in disbelief that his parents could be gone. He knew his parents were getting old but they were always so resilient. He thought about his father, his guiding hand in moulding the man he was today, his mother, who showed her endless love through hugs and treats and support. He felt numb as he realised they were truly gone.</p>
<p>“Ruby-,” his voice cracked, sounding disjointed, “what about James?” Ruby stopped rubbing her eyes and looked at him, her eyes bright red and gleaming and she cried.</p>
<p>“He came for poor Master James, for poor Master James, for lovely Misses Lilly and left poor baby Harry alone,” in her grief she disapparated away, leaving Atticus to sit in the large entrance hall alone. He was numb, the silence of the hall deafening and he felt for the first time that he was well and truly alone.</p>
<p>After what felt like hours, yet also seconds, Atticus dragged himself up. He stood staring blankly ahead for another few hours, though most likely minutes, until he gathered the energy to take a step forward. He walked sluggishly to his old room, and flicked his wrist absently to light the half burnt candles still surprisingly there. He stared at the room, his old posters of irrelevant bands and the quills and books still laid out on his desk. He took out his wand, almost dropping it through his loose fingers. After casting a scouring charm over the room he flung himself face down on the bed and didn’t move until sleep eventually took him.</p>
<p>Atticus left his bed for the first time in three days, somehow managing to make it out of the door. As he looked down the filthy hall he felt an urge overwhelm him to make the house spotless, to return it to its previous glory. A thought struck him before he could begin however, he needed to claim the title of Lord Potter no matter how much he didn’t want to. His Father always did tell him that there should never be vacancies if one could help it, after all. He smiled bitterly at the thought and returned to his room in search of decent robes and to at least appear somewhat put together.</p>
<p>He found his old favourite robes, a dark shade of green with silver accents. It fit surprisingly well after never having been worn for 13 years. He managed to find a fitting white shirt and dark grey trousers to wear underneath and a pair of dragon hide ankle boots to wear as well. He showered first and dressed quickly, his sluggishness seemingly gone after finally feeling clean. He stared at himself in the mirror, slightly haunted by how similar he and James looked. However Atticus never shared his more muscular frame, instead having a thin and tall athletic body. He turned away quickly and instead searched the magically expanded pockets of the trousers he had been wearing before.</p>
<p>He pulled out what he had been searching for, a thin silver band which had faint engravings on the inside. He slipped the band onto his right ring finger easily, quickly turning and leaving his room after throwing on a plain black cloak.</p>
<p>“Ruby?” He called out reluctantly. She popped into existence in front of him and he was happy to see that his presence had made her look slightly healthier.</p>
<p>“What can Ruby be doing for Master?” She said, pain still etched in her voice.</p>
<p>“You mentioned before something about a baby Harry? Could you tell me more?” Ruby looked at him sadly before shaking her head, her large bat-like ears waving.</p>
<p>“Baby Harry is being Master James’ and Misses Lily’s baby but Ruby is very sorry Master, Ruby is not knowing more,” Atticus nodded and thanked her, making his way out of the house to where he could apparate, just beyond the gates. He pulled up the hood of his cloak and apparated to a dark alley just off Diagon Alley. He stepped out, making sure his hood covered him as much as possible as he wanted to avoid anyone who would go near him. He made his way to the imposing building of gringotts, sending quick nods to the goblin guards. After making his way inside, he quickly found a goblin that was free.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon, I would like to meet with someone to discuss the matter of inheritance and possibility of an heir,” He spoke lowly, only loud enough for the goblin to hear. The goblin squinted at him before nodding.</p>
<p>“Very well, Mr. Potter. Please follow me.” The goblin hopped down and led him towards the private rooms and indicated for him to sit down opposite the large desk in the room.</p>
<p>“Someone will be with you in a moment.” He stayed before walking out. Atticus stepped up to the chair before sitting and crossing his legs, the image of the perfect Potter Lord. His grief was placed behind careful doors, never to be known. Eventually a new goblin came, introducing herself as Ginrak.</p>
<p>“I have been informed that you wish to claim the title of Lord Potter, is that correct?” Atticus nodded and leaned forward slightly.</p>
<p>“I have indeed come to claim the title, and all possible titles and all that pertains to them. I have also come to discuss the possibility of a relative being my heir.” Ginrak nodded and produced a thick sheet of parchment at the click of her fingers.</p>
<p>“As first order of business, Mr Potter, we shall do an inheritance test in order to find out any and all titles, vaults, magical items and magic you have inherited. Please place three drops of blood on this parchment if you are agreeable.” She slid the parchment closer to him and he looked at it with a calculating gaze. He took out his wand and cast a light wordless severing charm to cut his thumb. He let the three drops fall before healing his finger. He watched in fascination as his blood was adsorbed before the parchment filled with a neat cursive a moment later. He read it and was pleasantly surprised.</p>

  <em> Atticus Fleamont Potter </em>
</p>
<p align="center"> <em>Born: 21st of May, 1954.</em></p>
<p align="center"> <em>Residing: Potter estate, York, England.</em></p>
<p align="center"> <em>Titles: Potter heir, Gryffindor heir, Peverell heir.</em></p>
<p align="center"> <em>Titles to claim: Lord Potter, Lord Gryffindor, Lord Peverell.</em></p>
<p align="center"> <em>Vaults to claim:</em></p>
<p align="center">
  <em> Potter main vault- 38,486,937 Galleons, 93,894 Sickles, 8,759 Knuts, 2,975 various magical items; </em>
</p>
<p align="center"> <em>Potter trust vault (Can only be withdrawn from by Harry Potter or his magical guardian)- 7,872 Galleons, 837 Sickles, 924 Knuts;</em></p>
<p align="center"> <em>Gryffindor vault- 946,205 Galleons, 3,736 Sickles, 1,936 Knuts, 947 various magical items;</em></p>
<p align="center"> <em>Peverell vault- 19,937 Galleons, 836 Sickles, 95 Knuts, 70 various magical items.</em></p>
<p align="center"> <em>Inherited magic(s): Potter family magic, Gryffindor family magic, Peverell family magic, Wandless casting ability, Wordless casting ability, Magic sensitivity.</em></p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>He hummed pleasantly as he read, only one thing confusing him: Harry Potter. He had one guess as to who he was and he dearly hoped he was right.</p>
<p>“May I claim all three titles today?” He asked Ginrak after carefully considering the information.</p>
<p>“Of course, Mr Potter. You will receive your lordship rings, which will be all you need to claim your rightful titles.” She clicked her fingers and three boxes appeared on the desk. The Potter one was a dark maroon with the crest inlaid in gold, the Gryffindor one a deep red with the crest in a more yellow gold and the Peverell one was almost a black green with the crest in silver. Atticus reached out hesitantly towards the Potter box and opened it, a ring with a gold band and similar colours to the box in the gem, the crest clear inside. He slid it carefully onto his left ring finger and felt his magic surge and connect with it, accepting him as Lord Potter. He did the same with the other two rings and looked down at the single ring now on the hand, the gem showing a mixture of all three crests and colours.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Lord Potter, Gryffindor, Peverell. Now onto the other matter you wished to discuss, would I be correct in assuming that Harry Potter is to be your heir?” Ginrak asked after banishing the boxes.</p>
<p>“First I would like to know who he is, seeing as the inheritance test mentioned a magical guardian, is he underage?” Atticus fiddled with his new ring as he spoke, it’s weight unusual.</p>
<p>“You don’t know about Harry Potter?” Ginrak asked with shock. Atticus nodded slowly, confused but Ginrak told him the entire story of ‘The-Boy-Who-Lived’.</p>
<p>“I missed the entire war?” Atticus said in shock to himself. The goblin’s words left his mind reeling at how much he missed, at how he could’ve helped instead of being holed up safe instead of the Merlin forsaken wilderness. He vowed at that moment that he would do anything he could to help Harry.</p>
<p>“Who is Harry’s magical guardian?” He asked, intrigued as to who took him in.</p>
<p>“It is currently Albus Dumbledore, although as Harry’s only living magical relative, you can claim to be his magical guardian right now.”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore? As in Professor Dumbledore? Is he living with him?” Atticus was truly confused, there was no reason why Dumbledore would possibly become his magical guardian.</p>
<p>“No, Harry Potter lives with his muggle relatives, Mr and Mrs Dursley.”</p>
<p>“Could I claim to be his guardian now? Would it also be possible for me to get Harry to live with me? Perhaps convince relatives to make me his muggle guardian?”</p>
<p>“You most certainly can, Lord Potter. I am afraid that unless you get their permission however, you cannot gain custody of Harry.” Atticus sighed but went through the paperwork with Ginrak to become Harry’s magical guardian.</p>
<p>“Could you give me the address of these Dursleys? A visit is in order.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Atticus returned home and helped Ruby clean the mansion with fervour, even going outside to neaten the garden and to make the mansion presentable. It took them almost two weeks to finish, after which Atticus moved onto creating a room for Harry, if he were ever to need it. Despite knowing he should, Atticus couldn’t bring himself to move into the master bedroom. The idea of it made his gut twist unpleasantly as his guilt over their death made itself known. Atticus also decided to get a new wardrobe, with decent muggle clothes included. He felt his 17 year old wardrobe was very lacking in clothes appropriate for a Lord.</p>
<p>Atticus chose a plain but high quality black muggle suit to wear once he visited the Dursleys. He decided to forgo the suit jacket, instead wearing the fitted black waistcoat, fitted midnight blue shirt, the tight black suit trousers and polished black wingtip shoes. He rolled his sleeves up before leaving, not wishing to be too warm. The summer sun was bright but not overwhelming as he left the house and he made his way outside of the gates in order to apparate to a lane way not to far from Privet Drive. He walked purposefully to number 4 before walking up their driveway and knocking on their door.</p>
<p>He waited patiently at the door, his hands clasped behind his back until a woman in her mid twenties answered the door. Her hair was blonde and her face thin and vaguely horse-like.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon. Mrs Dursley, I presume?” He smiled genially, casting a glance over her head and seeing a large, red-faced man standing in a doorway to the hall.</p>
<p>“Yes, but who’re you?” She asked, clear suspicion in her voice.</p>
<p>“If you would invite me in, I wish to speak to you in detail about my nephew; Harry Potter,” at his name, Mrs Dursley blanched before glancing back at her husband, who had also paled. Mrs Dursley opened the door silently, before stepping back to let Atticus in. He nodded to her as he stepped in and following Mr Dursley into the room he had returned to. Atticus had his suspicions, however, at their unusual reaction at the mention of Harry’s name. Mr and Mrs Dursley took the largest couch in what Atticus assumed to be the living room. He took a single chair which faced towards the Dursley’s slightly, leaning back and folded his hands top of his crossed legs.</p>
<p>“As you are now aware, Harry is my nephew. I am Atticus Potter and have regretfully been abroad my entire adult life. I was unfortunately ignorant of all that had transpired in England and to Harry and my own family. Where is Harry currently?” Atticus had vaguely notes that Mr Dursley had steadily been growing redder as he went on.</p>
<p>“Now look here, you freak! You don’t get to come in here, spouting on about ‘regret’ after we’ve had to deal with that urchin boy for four years!” Atticus stiffened at the words and the indignant tone.</p>
<p>“I see,” he said quietly, his mask straining to conceal his anger.</p>
<p>“Yes you very well will see! Your lot can just sod off for all I care, as long as you get rid of that thing you call Harry-!” Atticus slowly stood up, looming over the Dursleys. It quietened Mr Dursley as he looked up in fear.</p>
<p>“Show me to Harry.”</p>
<p>“You-!” Mr Dursley choked out, spluttering.</p>
<p>“I said show me to Harry, don’t make me ask again.” His cold tone snapped something in Mrs Dursley as she piped up.</p>
<p>“He’s under the stairs,” she said quietly and Mr Dursley spluttered some more. Atticus turned quickly and all but stormed to the cupboard. He took a moment to calm himself and control his mask before he banished the large lock on the door wandlessly. He opened the door slowly, scared of what he would find within. He crouched down slightly to look in, sick with the sight he saw before him. On top of a mouldy, filthy mattress sat a cowering 4 year old. His thin bony arms hugged his similarly thin legs, face pressed to his knees as he rocked and cried silently. Atticus felt his heart breaking as he looked at the child, his nephew. His throat stung and clenched as he moved to kneel at the door of the cupboard.</p>
<p>“Hey,” he said, his voice low and soft. Harry’s face jerked up as his scared emerald eyes met with warm brown ones.</p>
<p>“Hi Harry. I’m your uncle, Atticus Potter. I’m your Father’s brother.” Atticus watched as those unnaturally green eyes went from terror to hope.</p>
<p>“Are you going to take me away?” The words were spoken with such hope, such <em> need </em> that Atticus knew he had no option. He smiled genuinely at Harry, a smile of love and sadness.</p>
