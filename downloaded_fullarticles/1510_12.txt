    <p>08/26/1994</p><p> </p><p>While the cameras of TV channels from around the world were riveted on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, the world held its breath, waiting for the announcement that change, no doubt, millions of people's lives. It was then that a long, immaculate volute of white smoke escaped from the roof of the Sistine Chapel, announcing that a decision had finally been made. The believers gathered in St. Peter's Square then held their breath, their eyes not leaving the doors of the balcony of the Basilica, eagerly awaiting the name of the new Pontiff. It was then that guards and fanfares began to parade along St. Peter's Square as a public opening. It lasted several minutes.</p><p>All of a sudden, the great doors opened, and several churchmen entered, led by Duraisamy Simon Lourdusamy, the Cardinal Protodeacon, who then stepped forward to reveal to the whole world the long-awaited identity of the future Pontiff. . A microphone was lowered in front of him, and he took a big breath of air, before opening his mouth.</p><p><em><u>"</u></em><em></em><u> Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum: </u><br/> habemus papam! <br/> Eminentissimum ac reverendissimum dominum, <br/> dominum   Harrius James Orionem , <br/> Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae cardinalem Potter <br/> which sibi nomen imposes   Hadrianus Septimus . " (1)</p><p>The believers gathered in St. Peter's Square began to cry with joy, while the guards and fanfares continued to parade at the front of the Basilica. However, many were shocked, not expecting such an announcement. Many expected to hear a name such as that of the German Cardinal Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, who was the favorite, and yet that was not the case. However, the population was not so surprised. After all, Harry James Orion Potter, now Adrian VII, was a person loved by all, and especially recognized as a godsend sent by the Almighty. But few thought he could be elected as a pope as he was only fourteen year old, and yet that was the case.</p><p>The story of the new pope was known to all. Abandoned at only six by his uncle and aunt during a trip to Italy, he was saved by the church to be raised according to the Christian faith by following the basic principles of the Catholic Church and a third name was added to his, Orion. Soon he became an important figure in the church, recognized by all with many miracles happening around him. Harry's first miracle was when he succeeded in praying for a seriously ill woman with terminal lung cancer to heal her completely, magically wiping out the disease that was gnawing her from the inside.</p><p>His second miracle was when he managed to save a dying newborn brought to the church by his desperate mother in hope of a miracle. When Harry took the child in his arms, his body lit up before the amazed eyes of the believers and the Cardinal of the church, and the newborn began to cry with vigor as his complexion was again pink and not pale. For many, Harry James Orion Potter was actually one of God's chosen ones, sent to Earth to save them and preach the word of the Divine.</p><p>Finally, the third miracle that convinced the whole world that Harry was a divine elect was when he managed to disappear into a column of light, to reappear in front of a bank robber in Rome, with the illusion of two huge immaculate wings. He then managed, with a simple wave of the hand, to push several meters back the bank robber. Thus was born the birth of Harry James Orion Potter, the godsend, whom some even considered the new prophet.</p><p>Yet the truth was different, and few people knew it. Hadrian James Orion Potter, born Harry James Potter, was born on 31/07/1980 in Godric's Hollow, Wales in the United Kingdom. Son of James Charlus Potter and Lily Jane Potter born Evans, two wizards emeritus, he was the victim of a tragedy on Halloween eve, the 31/09/1981, resulting in the death of both his parents as well as the destruction of a monster, Voldemort. All because of the manipulations of a capricious old man addicted to lemon drops, a rat and a bat.</p><p>He was abandoned by his godfather who had vowed to protect him, but who preferred the revenge of his deceased friends instead of protecting his godson against all odds, resulting in his unjust imprisonment, once again planned by a wicked old man, a jerk who spent his days sucking decayed sweets and violating the minds of innocent people without their knowledge. Finally, he was abandoned to the Dursley family, his family on the side of his maternal aunt, and was then treated as a slave during the four years following. At three years, He hardly learned to walk that he was forced to cook, clean the house, wash the windows, weed the garden ...</p><p>At the age of four, when he began to do more and more accidental magic, he was beaten like a domestic animal and treated like a house elf. From the height of his four years, he did not expect anything from life, abandoning himself to his sad fate. Yet destiny smiles on him in a singular way.</p><p>Indeed, Harry's uncle, Vernon Dursley, decided that he no longer wanted to keep the ungrateful and monstrous child at home. So when he and his family were invited to spend their holidays in Rome, all expenses paid by the Society he was working for, Grunnings, he decided to put a plan in place to get rid of his nephews. The plan was very simple: Forgetting that they had a nephew in Italy. And the plan went perfectly, so Harry was abandoned in Rome, surrounded by strangers speaking a foreign language.</p><p>But this misfortune was actually a stroke of luck for the boy, who was then collected and adopted by a British bishop named Marcus Conington who was now living in Rome, being one of the many bishops who worked at Vatican seat. And that's how Harry's life changed forever. He learned about the Catholic rules, laws and beliefs practiced by the Roman Catholic Church, learning about the differences from the Church of England and the Orthodox Church. He began to help as much as possible in the church, either by cooking soup for the poor, or helping his father during processions. He quickly gained popularity, especially when his "miracles" occurred.</p><p>In fact, these miracles were only the result of Harry's accidental magic. The magic was 99% free and 1% controlled by wizards, eager to help but refusing to be enslaved, it met the needs of wizards who asked for help. So at each prayer and Harry's request, the magic answered, and eventually mutated Harry's magic. The changes made by the magic itself to Harry were impressive, and she granted him the mage sight, giving him the inherent ability to see the magic as a whole. For Harry, the world had become so much more beautiful, and he was persuaded to see the divine essence of God throughout the world. Of course, as the Vatican was perfectly aware of the wizards' existence (although they did everything to eliminate them), they realized that Harry was actually a wizard. They then decided to tell him everything, and Harry then decreed that his magic was a divine gift, and that he had nothing to do with the other wizards of the Magical World, denouncing them as pagans and heretics, to the great pleasure of the church.</p><p>At eleven, Harry received several invitations to several magical schools, such as Hogwarts, Durmstrang, Beauxbatons, and even Mahoutokoro. He refused the invitations, however, and the Vatican decided to hire magical guardians to care for Harry. He had then as preceptor one of the few wizards to believe in God, Nicolas Flamel and his wife, Perenelle. They taught Harry what they could, including Alchemy, and noticed that Harry did not need a magic wand, probably due to his magical mutation. They also noticed that the latter was particularly skilled in the areas of Magic Healing, Charms and Potions. Another peculiarity of his magic was his perfect control of fire, and White Magic in general, including a very rare and almost extinct branch, whose writings were saved in the depths of the Vatican, Sacred Magic.</p><p>Sacred Magic was a very particular area. Indeed, this magic was as beneficial as destructive. Some called it simply War Magic. Sacred Magic allowed the use of fire spells, but also a use of light to heal or destroy enemies. It even allowed to save people from the brink of death. Evidently, this magic had for adverse field, Unholy Magic, specialized in shadows and necromancy, the most vile and blackest magic that exists.</p><p>Following this, and to Harry's acknowledged miracles, he was then unofficially declared as Saint. But deep down, Harry was not really a Saint, because he had a fantastic, hidden hatred of wizards, especially Dumbledore, the head of all his woes, and he swore to himself that one day he would take revenge of the old man.</p><p>And finally, shortly after his fourteen years, 25/08/1994 in the evening, Pope John Paul II died of a heart attack, leaving vacant the position of leader of the Roman Catholic Church. The conclave then ended by meeting shortly after the death of the pope to elect a new leader. The meeting lasted until the evening of 26/08/1994, and one of the Cardinals, Marcus Conington, who was appointed Cardinal by John Paul II in 1991, then proposed Hadrian James Orion Potter as Pope, and to his greatest surprise, his proposal was accepted. Thus, Harry was summoned to the conclave in the Sistine Chapel, and two questions were asked to him.</p><p><em>"Acceptasne electionem of canonice factam in Summum Pontificem?" </em>(2)</p><p>Harry simply answered <em>"</em><em>Facio</em> <em>ita</em><em>."</em> (3)</p><p><em>"Quo nomine vocari screw?</em> <em>"</em> (4)</p><p><em>"Hadrianus</em> <em>Septimus."</em></p><p>The cardinals accepted his answer and applauded, before leading him into the "room of tears" in which he chose his white cassock, before returning to the chapel to receive his white cap delivered by the secretary of the Sacred College. And then, the Cardinal protodeacon, Duraisamy Simon Lourdusamy, proclaimed the gospel of Peter's confession of faith and, on the song of Te Deum , the cardinals come forward to pay homage and obedience by kneeling . Contrary to his two predecessors, John Paul I and John Paul II, Harry decided to accept the papal coronation ceremony, receiving then the Triple Crown. He also decided to take over the coat of arms of Adrian VI, by changing the green wolf traps on a gold background in gold lilies on a blue background.</p><p>Finally, after many ceremonies, including the delivery of the fisherman's ring and the Pallium, Harry was led to the Loggia of Blessings with Duraisamy Simon Lourdusamy after this one announced the Habemus Papam.</p><p>Harry then entered the Loggia, and applause echoed, believers and other spectators shouting with joy on seeing the new Pontiff, the youngest pontiff in the world, and surely the one with the longest reign.</p><p>Harry greeted the believers with a big smile, and when the crowd fell silent, he began his speech in Italian.</p><p>"Brothers and sisters, good evening.</p><p>You all know that the duty of the Conclave was to give a bishop to Rome. It seems that my brother Cardinals found him here, near Saint Peter ... and here we are. I thank you for the welcome that has come from the diocesan community of Rome.</p><p>First of all, I would say a prayer: Pray for our Bishop Emeritus John Paul II... Let us all pray together for him, that the Lord accept him in his real and Mary in her embrace.</p><p>Our Father ...</p><p>Hail Mary ...</p><p>Glory to the Father ...</p><p>And now let us begin this journey, the Bishop and people, this journey of the Church of Rome, which presides in charity over all the Churches, a journey of brotherhood in love, of mutual trust. Let us always pray for one another. Let us pray for the whole world that there might be a great sense of brotherhood. My hope is that this journey of the Church that we begin today, together with help of my Cardinal Vicar, be fruitful for the evangelization of this beautiful city.</p><p>And now I would like to give the blessing, but first I want to ask you a favor. Before the bishop blesses the people, I ask that you would pray to the Lord to bless me — the prayer of the people for their Bishop. Let us say this prayer — your prayer for me — in silence. ...</p><p>I will now give my blessing to you and to the whole world, to all men and women of good will.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, I am leaving you. Thank you for your welcome. Pray for me and I will be with you again soon.</p><p>We will see one another soon.</p><p>Tomorrow I want to go to pray the Madonna, that she may protect Rome.</p><p>Good night and sleep well!"</p><p>The applause echoed again, and Harry, after greeting the faithful again, returned to the Basilica to go to his flats. He decided to rest, pleased to know that from now on he could accomplish his many plans.</p><p> </p><p>\Break/</p><p>Meanwhile, in a Scottish castle named Hogwarts, an old man rubbed his hands, delighted. He had managed to get the Triwizard Tournament back to Hogwarts. He then looked at the piece of paper in front of him on which was written almost illegibly: "Harry Potter".</p><p>After the Dursley fiasco, Albus Dumbledore had managed to retrieve a piece of paper on which Harry had written his name a long time ago, and he waited until finally the Tournament was allowed, to use it.</p><p>"Whether you like it or not, my boy, you'll come back here and obey me."</p><p>Albus cackled and chocked on a lemon drop.</p><p> </p><p>Translations:</p><p> (1): <em>I announce to you a great joy:</em></p><p>
  <em>We have a Pope!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The most eminent and most reverend Lord,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The Lord Hadrian James Orion Potter</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church Potter</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Who takes to himself the name of Adrian VII.</em>
</p><p>(2): <em>Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?</em></p><p>(3): <em>Yes, I do.</em></p><p>(4): <em>By what name do you wish to be called?</em></p><p> </p><p> </p>
