</p><p>“You will marry King Thomas,” Lucius said, glowering at his son from his spot at the top of the stairs.</p><p>Draco glared. “I’d sooner die!” he yelled, throwing himself onto his bed.</p><p>“Oh stop with these theatrics,” Lucius replied, waving his son off. “King Thomas has been <em>very </em>generous given the decline of our own kingdom these days. You could do considerably worse!” Draco glared, opening his mouth to argue. “There will be no more argument! You will prepare to leave within the hour and you will be on your <em>best </em>behavior for the King.”</p><p>Draco turned to face his father, his face impassive and cold. Lucius had been furious to find his son in the arms of a stable boy, several days earlier, and from that moment on, the King of Malfoy had determined his son would be married off as soon as possible. He had been a disappointment to his family for the last time. Lucius had been lucky to find any monarch willing to take his son on. It was not as if Draco was particularly quiet about his exploits. Tales of the raucous Prince of Malfoy were common in the surrounding Kingdoms. It was fortunate then, that King Thomas did not listen to such gossip, nor did he particularly have time to concern himself with Draco. So long as he could stay at least mostly virginal long enough to meet the King, their contract would be satisfied.</p><p>Draco sighed, defeated. “Yes, father.”</p><p>The journey to the land of King Thomas proved long and treacherous. <em>Perhaps if I’m lucky the carriage will drive off a cliff before I’m expected to marry him, </em>Draco thought miserably to himself. Draco stared out of the rain-strewn carriage window, at the rocky bluffs, and the fog that barely hid their danger.</p><p>Not for the first time, Draco felt like a bird trapped in a gilded cage and longed to fly free, to soar to the heavens and escape to anywhere else. Somewhere where a handsome knight might rescue him from his terrible fate. Draco closed his eyes, letting his mind wander as he pictured his imaginary knight. With thick black hair, and kind eyes, and perhaps a scar over one from his many battles, someone rugged with a touch of a beard, and strong arms that could pin Draco down when he was naughty. With the swordsmanship skills to vanquish any monster, dragon, or King. With a heart of gold, and the strength of a lion, with great courage and someone willing to challenge the young prince.</p><p>Draco nearly laughed at his own daydreaming. Even if such a knight existed, they would never risk betraying their King for <em>him</em>. Sighing, he stared out the window once more. He wondered if he would survive the fall of attempting to sneak out of his carriage, whether or not it would be worth it to plummet to his death rather than have to marry a man he would never love.</p><p>He was surrounded on either side by his father’s best knights, who would all be beheaded should anything happen to Draco. Pursing his lips, Draco flopped back into his seat against the tufted velvet cushions of his carriage with a huff, trying to convince himself that perhaps it wouldn’t be <em>so </em>awful.</p><p>He was to be a Queen after all, or perhaps a co-King, he supposed most likely. He had heard little of King Thomas of Riddelia, though none of it had been especially good. He was a stern king, with an unkind heart, and a penchant for cruelty to those who displeased him; though he was considered relatively handsome., with dark hair, and even darker eyes. Draco supposed they would make an attractive couple and acceptable heirs. So long as the heirs had Draco’s features, he would be acceptable anywhere. Assuming the old King could even get it up. Draco snickered to himself at the thought..</p><p align="center">

</p><p>“My Queen will be here soon, and I expect you to bring him to me immediately upon arrival.”</p><p>Sir Harry tried to discreetly roll his eyes. He hated the way King Thomas talked about others, as if he somehow <em>owned</em> them, as if the new Queen would be part of his property like the castle and the township and the rolling hills that splayed across the countryside.</p><p>He stood and grabbed his sword, motioning for his fellow training knights, Ronald and Seamus to go meet the incoming carriage at the front of the drawbridge before the King lost his temper again. Ronald was still nursing a slash across his face from his latest undeserved punishment, and while garnering wounds while in battle wasn’t uncommon, one shouldn’t collect such gruesome things under the safety of their own roof.</p><p>Harry had his own set of scars of course, the largest being right above his eye. He acquired the gnarly gash after a duel with a treacherous thief who slayed both of his parents right in front of him. Even though he had been just shy of eighteen, he had been knighted on the spot for his bravery and courage. The thief was now just ashes in the wind, but Harry still thought about him, about his parents and their sacrifice whenever he glimpsed the jagged scar in a mirror.</p><p>The carriage arrived with a steady crunch of horse hooves and spindled wheels over rock-strewn gravel. He tucked his sword into his belt and lifted his visor to greet his new Queen. Lifting the handle, Harry opened the door and held out his hand.</p><p>Welcoming the most gorgeous man he had ever laid eyes on.</p><p>Gold-strewn hair and soft, pale skin, he placed a delicate hand into Harry’s as he descended the plush carriage. He peered at Harry through long, blond eyelashes, and Harry couldn’t help but gasp at his beauty.</p><p>Draco blushed as he stared, and licked his lips. “King Thomas?” Draco’s voice sounded timid, hopeful. He beamed at Harry as if he was surprised, and not at all disappointed.</p><p>“My Queen,” Harry answered, and his own voice, normally commanding and strong betrayed him. The answer came out soft, as soft as the prince’s hand in his own, and he stuttered nervously. “I-My apologies, my fair prince, I am your knight, Sir Harry.” He noticed that the gleam in Draco’s eyes quickly vanished as his face fell. “But I am to take you to your King,” he added hopefully, aching already to see that gorgeous smile again.</p><p>The grin did not return to Prince Draco’s face, and instead, a look of disappointment and devastation covered his porcelain skin. Harry frowned and found himself wanting to kneel, wanting to ask his future Queen what was wrong, how he could make him happy again. Instead, he turned and begrudgingly lead the party to the castle, to the throne and the King that wouldn’t give a damn whether his partner was happy or not.</p><p>“King Thomas, I announce your future Queen, Prince Draco of Malfoy.” He loved the way that name felt on his tongue, Draco, <em>Draco</em>, as though he had been yearning to say that word for a fortnight, nay, a lifetime. He had to quickly remind himself that it wasn’t his name to utter, it was his Kings. The same King that couldn’t be bothered to stop inking his scroll with his pheasant-feathered quill long enough to welcome his bride.</p><p>“Yes, yes,” King Thomas waved a busy hand in their direction. “Welcome to the Kingdom of Riddelia. Sir Harry, please show our guest to his room.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes now, certain that his ruler wouldn’t notice if he couldn’t even notice the beautiful man in front of him. He offered Prince Draco what he hoped to be a comforting, trustworthy smile as he held out his hand. “If it pleases my Queen, I will escort you to your chambers.”</p><p>Draco blushed, and offered Harry a small smile, “Thank you Sir Harry, you are too kind.”</p><p>Harry led the way down the stone hallway, feeling the cold air lurch out of each step. He wasn’t sure why the King wanted his prized Queen so far from the warmth of the main chambers, from where he generally retired night after night, but Harry didn’t have the authority to question it.</p><p>“I can light a fire, but I cannot promise it won’t ebb overnight without prodding.” Harry blushed as Draco’s eyes dropped to the front of his tassets. “Prodding the logs, that is,” he stammered.</p><p>Draco smirked, stripping off his outer robes, “I prefer a chill anyway,” he said seductively.  Harry swallowed hard. “It’s so much more fun to warm up you know?” he asked, stripping off his tunic.</p><p>“Erm, yes, I suppose feeling the heat from the flames on your,” he gulped heavily, “bare skin can be rather refreshing.” Harry couldn’t stop staring at Prince Draco’s broad chest and pert, pink nipples.</p><p>“What about you? What do you do to warm up around here?” Draco asked, a dangerous glimmer in his eye.</p><p>Harry felt his cheeks flush as crimson as the fire he was set to build. He hurriedly rushed to the task, lifting logs from the corner of the room and maneuvering them onto the grate. He lifted a stone and dragged it against the stone fireplace until it cracked, and he used the sparks to light the timber. He stepped back as Draco stepped closer.</p><p>The fire grew from a tiny flicker to a steady flame, but all Harry could focus on was the length of Draco’s throat and the sinew of his torso. He wanted to drag his teeth, his tongue, his hands, anything he could across that exquisite expanse of flesh.</p><p>He clenched his fists and tried to remind himself that this gorgeous man was his Queen, yes, but not someone he himself could embrace in the cold of the night. Prince Draco was intended for his King, and while that awful bastard was nowhere near deserving, it was just the way of the Kingdom.</p><p>Besides, giving in to his temptation would not only sabotage his position in the King’s Court, but it would tarnish his reputation and put the Prince in danger of King Thomas’s wrath.  </p><p>Harry inspected the burning flames again, ensuring that they would stay ignited for at least the better part of the evening before he gave the Prince a nod and exited his chambers for the night. The memory of long eyelashes and pale skin and that charming smile stayed with him as he climbed into his own threadbare sheets.</p><p>He couldn’t help but wrap his calloused fingers around his cock. He had been half-hard in his chainmail since he opened the carriage doors and caught his first glimpse of Prince Draco. The room was chilly, but his hand was still warm from the flickering flames of the fire he lit, and he allowed his mind to drift back to that room.</p><p>Licking his lips, Harry thought about picking Draco up under arms and flinging him to the bed, the way his skin would look against the silk white of the sheets. He’d crawl over Prince Draco’s frame, delighting in the blush of his cheeks and the blush in his chest as his nipples hardened in Harry’s broad hands.</p><p>Harry would kiss him, softly at first, then growing with heat, allowing his tongue to explore as Draco moaned into his mouth. Draco would try and wrap his arms around Harry’s neck, or his back, but Harry would pin him down instead.</p><p>“Let me worship you,” he would groan into the hollow of Draco’s throat as he lifted both of his delicate wrists above his head. “So beautiful, darling,” he would whisper as he pulled off the remainder of Draco’s clothes, tossing them to the corner of the room.</p><p>Draco would nod, and blush and keen, pressing his now naked cock against Harry’s hard length, and they would both moan at the heat, the fire no longer necessary in the previously chilly room. Draco would rut against him, but Harry would hold his wrists tight with one hand, and press his needy hip down with the other.</p><p>“Shh,” he’d whisper in comfort as Draco panted before he licked and sucked at his perfect nipples. Draco would be writhing then, already hot and needy, and Harry would drag his tongue down the center of his chest, down to the faint nestle of hair above his hard cock.</p><p>Harry moaned aloud in his room when he thought of what Prince Draco might smell like there, musky and aroused, and Harry had to slow his hand so he didn’t come too quickly before his own fantasy played out in his head.</p><p>He thrust two fingers into his mouth while he imagined taking Prince Draco between his lips. How his cock would feel resting on Harry’s tongue, the heat, the sturdy weight. Harry shoved his fingers down his throat as far as they would go as he thought of sucking Draco down to the hilt, listening to him moan and shudder in ecstasy.</p><p>Draco wouldn’t come, not yet, not until he felt Harry’s hard length, Harry filling him up. In his mind, he pulled Draco’s ankles over his shoulders and plunged his own cock into Prince Draco’s greedy hole. His fantasy offered no preparation, and Draco was tight, his walls contracting around Harry’s shaft with heady need, and Harry would thrust, hard and fast, feeding off the desperate whines from his Prince, from his Queen, from the person he could devote his life to.</p><p>His hand sped up in tempo as Harry’s back arched into it, and within moments Harry was coming, hot stripes of his orgasm painting his fingers and his chest. His breath was ragged as he stroked until the last bit of his climax subsided, and wiped his wet fingers into the cloth of his sheets.</p><p>He panted into the stillness of his room and lamented that his fantasy would never become a reality, as long as his King was around.</p><p align="center">

</p><p>Draco pouted as the rugged knight took his leave. He was kind, far kinder that Draco had anticipated, and though his welcome had not been especially warm, the King’s lack of interest was the best he could have hoped for. So long as Draco could be left to his own devices, he could easily find himself happy here. Draco lounged on his bed, considering the knight that had escorted him, how he had stared so unabashedly, so hungrily at Draco’s half-naked form sent a thrill up his spine. If the King had no interest in pleasing the blond, he could easily find his pleasures elsewhere, Draco thought. Briefly, he wondered if the knight would take him hard and rough as he desired, or if he would think he needed to be gentle with the young Prince. Draco was not the delicate flower the King would no doubt want him to be. Draco was a rose, and roses had thorns.</p>
