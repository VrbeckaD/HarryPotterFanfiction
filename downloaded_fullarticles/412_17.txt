  <strong>July 1991</strong>
</p>
<p>Robert Carroll and Simone Paisley of Number 26, East Brickwood Street were normal, without being ordinary. They never would be suspected of being involved with the strange or mysterious but if it was uncovered that they were, no one would be too surprised.</p>
<p>Mr. Carroll owned a pharmacy called Greenleaf, but as it was the only pharmacy in town, to the world it was just the pharmacy. He was a short man with dark curly hair and glasses, with lenses as thick as a slice of bread. Mr. Carroll was kind and bookish, a sort of hobbit of a man, but with a sarcastic sense of humor.</p>
<p>Ms. Paisley, his wife, was an editor at the local paper. She was tall and slim, with long fingers and distinctive silver hair. She had started to go gray in her twenties, and once she got married, decided not to dye her hair anymore. Ms. Paisley wore her silver hair causally, like a pair of satin shoes with the heels worn down, the sign of a woman so elegant she could afford to be careless about it. She didn’t change her last name when she got married either. When an article of hers was published, the line <em>By Simone F. Paisley</em> was underneath, and she had sort of gotten attached to that byline.</p>
<p>They had three daughters together. The girls were named, in order of age, Flora, Lorelai, and Maisy. They were evenly spaced, two years apart each. Flora, thirteen, Lorelai, eleven, and Maisy, nine. </p>
<p>The Paisley-Carroll household was somewhere between a cottage and a house. It was a bit cramped for five people, (although the girls all had their own bedrooms) and delightfully cluttered, overflowing with piles of books, family photographs, half-finished arts and crafts.</p>
<p>While the house could be a bit small, it had backyard aplenty, with two large oak trees and lilac bushes that were perfect for hide-and-seek. Mr. Carroll cherished his garden, striving to achieve the perfect amount of wild.</p>
<p>Ms. Paisley’s alarm went off at 8:30 every day. Even though it was summer and a Sunday, and her girls were no doubt sleeping in.</p>
<p>“Urg,” groaned Lorelai, pulling her pillow over her ears, trying unsuccessfully to mute the annoying beeping. It was far, far too early to be waking up. Lorelai could faintly hear her sisters clattering around with bowls and forks, getting ready for breakfast. She was able to mostly sleep through the chatter and the radio turned to the BBC (Her mother insisted that as a journalist, it was her duty to listen to the news every morning). But she was not able to sleep through the large tabby cat meowing at the top of her lungs and licking her eyelids.</p>
<p>Lorelai sat up. “Ugh. Get off, Beatrix.” The cat willingly jumped off the bed and began scratching at the door, adding new claw marks to an already scratched up door.</p>
<p>“Why do you make me feed you? Why can’t you bother Mum, or Flora?”</p>
<p>Lorelai dragged herself out of bed and padded downstairs, cat on her heels. She quickly filled the cat’s bowl, and left Beatrix to munch, sliding into her seat at the breakfast table. Maisy seemed to be making up a story between her spoon and the salt shaker. Flora was reading, hair dangerously close to falling in her bowl of cereal. Ms. Paisley was also reading; the newspaper.</p>
<p>“Strawberries or Blueberries?” asked Mr. Carroll.</p>
<p>“Blueberries.” He placed a bowl of cheerios with blueberries and a cup of steaming ginger-lemon tea in front of Lorelai.</p>
<p>“It’s a little warm for tea, Dad,” Lorelai said, placing a spoonful of cereal in her mouth. “It’s good for your immune system.”</p>
<p>Lorelai shrugged, and wrinkled her nose at the tea. The steam suddenly dissipated and the cup became cold to the touch. She reached over and took a sip, hoping that no one had noticed.</p>
<p>Ms. Paisley folded her newspaper over and addressed the group. “What are your plans for today?”</p>
<p>“I told you, Holly’s mum is taking me and her to the zoo!” Maisy wiggled in her chair.</p>
<p>“Didn’t a snake escape from the zoo last month?” Ms. Paisley looked at her husband, slightly concerned.</p>
<p>“Yes, but that zoo is almost seven miles away. I’m sure that Holly’s mum is taking them to the one near us,” Mr. Carroll reassured his wife.</p>
<p>Ms. Paisley, satisfied, turned to her other daughter. “Flora?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to the library with Nicole,” said Flora, not looking up from her book. “Mrs. Tipper, the librarian said she’d give me a few pounds if I helped shelf books.”</p>
<p>“And Lorelai?”</p>
<p>“Not sure. I have to do some summer reading, and Sam might come over later.” Sam was Lorelai’s BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD AND POSSIBLY THE UNIVERSE. They had gone to primary school together and immediately latched on to each other for dear life. They both had other friends, what with the societal tendency for girls to be friends with girls and boys to be friends with boys. But Sam and Lorelai persisted, against the odds.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Lorelai put her bowl in the sink and headed upstairs to get dressed. While walking upstairs, she tripped over a plastic pony. Grumbling, she righted herself.</p>
<p>“Maisy! You can’t leave your rubbish all over the stairs.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, not hurting you.”</p>
<p>“It literally is. I just tripped.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you need to pay better attention to where you’re going.” Maisy glared at her from the top of the staircase. Lorelai glared back, annoyed, when Maisy’s shoelaces quietly untied themselves. Maisy looked down just in time to see her shoelaces moving of their own accord, then she looked back at her sister.</p>
<p>“Lorelai! That’s not fair.”</p>
<p>“You could just re-tie them.” Lorelai brushed past her sister and slammed the door to her room as she walked inside.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Maisy, being closest called, “I’ll get it!” and ran to open the door. There an unfamiliar woman stood.</p>
<p>“Hello,” she said. “Could you get one of your parents for me?”</p>
<p>Maisy nodded and turned to go, before remembering her manners. “Who should I say is here?”</p>
<p>“My name is Clara Woo. I’ve come about a schooling opportunity.” Maisy nodded again and ran further into the house, leaving the door wide open. After a second, Clara heard a woman call, “Come in! I’m in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>Clara, frankly unaccustomed to just being invited in, without being screened for trustworthiness, took a cautious step inside. In return, she was presented with four closed doors.  Clara frowned, feeling a bit like she was following the white rabbit down the rabbit hole. She opened one of the doors</p>
<p>There was a girl sitting on a piano bench, reading The Catcher in the Rye. Flora looked up from her book and seeing Clara's confusion said, “The kitchen is just at the end of the hall.” Clara thanked her and continued down a hall.</p>
<p>The kitchen was a sunny room at the very back of the house. Ms. Paisley was writing in a datebook quietly, blue ink staining her fingers.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Clara knocked against the door frame, noting that her white rabbit was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Ms. Paisley looked up. “Hello! Ms. Woo, I think I heard? Please, have a seat. Would you like a cup of tea?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that would be lovely.” </p>
<p>Ms. Paisley rummaged around in a cupboard above the kitchen countertop. “We have Peppermint, Chamomile, Carmel Bedtime, Strawberry, Licorice, Ginger-Lemon, Black Cherry, Cinnamon Apple, and English Breakfast. The English Breakfast is decaf though. If you ask me, if tea is decaf, it’s not really tea but Robert read a study about adverse effects so we’re not keeping caffeine in the house for now.”</p>
<p>“Peppermint, please.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good.” Ms. Paisley grabbed two mugs and peppermint tea bags. She clicked the button on the kettle. “So, what are you trying to sell me?”</p>
<p>Clara smiled. This was a woman who was brisk, practical and collected. This would either make her job very easy or very hard.</p>
<p>“Well, we’re not quite there yet,” Clara said. “At its core, I’m telling you about a school that Lorelai has been accepted to. I think it’s important for your husband and daughter to be here for this conversation.”</p>
<p>Ms. Paisley nodded, “I’m sorry, but before I parade my children before you, I’m going to need some more information about your offer. As far as I know, school acceptances usually come in the mail. And furthermore, Lorelai has already been accepted to the same secondary school as her sister, which we’re planning to send her too.”</p>
<p>Clara frowned. So this was going to be difficult. “Please. This is very, very important. And, honestly, I’d rather not have to explain the whole thing more than once.”</p>
<p>“If you refused to give me any more information, then I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to leave.” Who did this woman think she was, anyway? Waltzing into strangers lives and demanding things from them.</p>
<p>Lorelai leaned against the doorway. She had heard her name and automatically tuned in. It wasn’t every day that a stranger came about her. And sure, eavesdropping wasn’t technically allowed, but she was just standing here, within hearing range. That wasn’t against any rules.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Lorelai heard her father’s voice and the slam of the screen door. “Oh hello. Honey, who’s this?”</p>
<p>“Ms. Woo. Who was on her way out.” Ms. Paisley’s face had adopted a <em>Do not fuck with me on this</em> expression. The type that made Lorelai nervous when it was trained on her and proud when it trained on anyone else.</p>
<p>“Clara Woo. Who was actually not going anywhere.” She stood up. “</p>
<p>Ms. Woo. I have asked you to leave once, nicely, already. Please do before I am forced to take more drastic measures.” Ms. Paisley stood as well. Mr. Carroll, still a bit unsure of what was happening, made eye contact with his wife. Even if he didn’t fully understand the situation, he understood his wife’s tone.</p>
<p>Clara walked over to the tea kettle. She understood the reaction, of course. Her own parents had reacted similarly. It just made her job that much harder.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” said Mr. Carroll.</p>
<p>“You can’t think you’re still entitled to a cuppa?” said Ms. Paisley.</p>
<p>Clara drew her wand and said, “Calfio.” She tapped her wand (Elm and Unicorn Hair, 11 and 2/3 inches, reasonably springy) against the kettle and instantly it began to whistle. Clara looked at the couple.</p>
<p>“Magic is real.”</p>
<p>Ms. Paisley sat down.</p>
