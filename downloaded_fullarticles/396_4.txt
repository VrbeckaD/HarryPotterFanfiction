  <em>‘Good morning wizards and witches of the UK. This is your morning news report for the 19<sup>th</sup> of October 1933. The rumours that have been circulating this week about a breakout in Germany’s wizarding prison has been confirmed this morning by German Chancellor for Magic, Rudolph Spielman. He said that on Tuesday, several acolytes of Grindelwald’s regime attacked the prison, with the support of a Dementor colony. He would give no further details.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>‘Germany was holding several prominent members of Grindelwald’s so-called ‘Inner Circle’, who have now surely escaped back to their master. Amongst those prominent figures was bounty hunter Gunnar Grimmson, who is infamous for his cruelty. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>‘Britain’s own Head Auror Alison McIntosh has called for calm, claiming Grindelwald has made no attempts to spread his regime to Britain, and that it is unlikely he will. Despite these calming words, questions must be asked of our Ministry and if they’re doing enough to stop the growing regime on the continent. The Minister seems to be out of his –‘ </em>
</p><p>The radio shut off in the middle of the broadcast. Newt looked up from where he was cutting meat for feeding to see Tina standing on the bottom step next to where the radio was, having turned it off. In her arms was their son, Carnelian Scamander, his strawberry blonde hair a mess, sticking out at all angles. His little hands were fiddling with a loose strand of Tina’s hair.</p><p>‘I told you not to listen to that, Newt. It’s all too depressing,’ Tina said, placing Carnelian on the ground.</p><p>Newt watched for a moment as Carnelian waddled towards Dougal the Demiguise, who was sleeping on the floor. The Demiguise fortunately stirred before Carnelian could launch himself onto him. Dougal caught Carnelian as he launched and wrapped his arms around the young child and began scratching his head, much to Carnelian’s delight. Confident that his son wasn’t going to accidentally annoy a beast, Newt turned back to Tina.</p><p>‘Depressing or not, I think we need to know. Grimmson’s escaped. That’s important news,’ Newt said.</p><p>‘If we need to know anything, Theseus or Dumbledore will tell us. Do you really need to hear it on the news as well?’</p><p>Newt refocused on chopping meat instead of answering Tina’s question. It had started three years ago, shortly after Carnelian was born. He had started to listen to the news every morning and night. There was something inside him that didn’t trust others to protect his family. He couldn’t be sure that Theseus or Dumbledore would tell him in time. If he heard it himself, Newt could prepare for what was coming, ensure that he was keeping Tina and Carnelian safe.</p><p>Newt’s refusal to answer did not go over Tina’s head. He felt her arms wrap around his chest, underneath his own arms, as she leant into his back, laying her head on his left shoulder. Warmth radiated off her, warming him despite the chill in the basement.</p><p>‘Don’t force me out, Newt. We’re a team, remember?’ Tina said.</p><p>Newt placed the chopping knife down and used his free right hand to squeeze Tina’s left hand. He tilted his head, so it was resting on top of Tina’s, seeking the comfort that came with her touch.</p><p>‘I just want to protect you and Carnelian,’ he said, ‘and hearing the news informs me of what’s coming.’</p><p>‘You’re too sweet,’ Tina said, pressing a kiss to his cheek, ‘but can you worry a little less? Barely anyone knows where our house is, thanks to the Fidelius Charm, and Dumbledore is never going to give the secret up. We’re safe.’</p><p>Tina always knew how to calm him, and this was no exception. He knew that she would be calm in the face of danger; it was basically a requirement for being an Auror. But it surprised him every day how she could encourage him to feel the same. It wasn’t just her words, but her tone and her presence that made Newt feel better about the state of the world.</p><p>He gave her hand another squeeze, hopefully passing on that she had reassured him, at least for now. As always, she understood the unspoken cues, sliding her hands back to her sides and moving off him. Newt immediately missed the feeling of her body against his, and the warmth that came with. Trying to focus back on what he was doing before Tina had come downstairs, he started slicing the last bits of meat.</p><p>A loud grunt and an exclaim from Tina made him spin around, knife in hand. Carnelian had wriggled his way out of Dougal’s grasp and was speeding under a desk towards the Nundu, as fast as his little legs could take him. The Nundu, even after three years, had not adjusted to Carnelian’s existence. This was unfortunate, as Carnelian had decided to designate it his favourite beast and wanted to play with it all the time.</p><p>Neither Newt nor Tina were in a position to stop Carnelian in time. Newt frantically looked around for where he had put his wand, but he couldn’t find it in his vicinity. Tina appeared to have left her wand upstairs. She gave Newt a terrified look, and he forgot about the wand, instead trying to navigate his way around the tables to intercept Carnelian, but his progress wasn’t fast enough.</p><p>The Nundu had just noticed Carnelian, and had arched its back, teeth bared in an aggressive manner. Carnelian wasn’t fazed, continuing forward, only steps away from the Nundu. Newt gave up trying to reach his son, instead picking up some tools on the table to throw at the Nundu as distraction. He had just taken aim when a blur of golden fur rushed past him.</p><p>The blur reached Carnelian before he could get into the Nundu’s range. It kept moving, carrying Carnelian with it, stopping a few metres away from Tina. It was Mildred, the Wampus cat, holding the back of Carnelian’s shirt in her mouth, warily eyeing the Nundu, which had settled down slightly.</p><p>‘Oh, thank god you were paying attention,’ Tina said to Mildred, sweeping Carnelian into her arms.</p><p>Mildred purred in response, licking Carnelian’s cheek a few times, as if to make sure she had indeed succeeded in rescuing the small boy. Dougal took the opportunity to scratch Mildred behind the ears as a way of saying thank you.</p><p>Newt walked over and placed a hand on Tina’s shoulder, hoping the gesture was comforting. He then gave his sternest look at Carnelian.</p><p>‘Carnelian, what did we tell you about the Nundu?’</p><p>‘Leave it ‘lone,’ Carnelian muttered.</p><p>‘So why did you try to run towards it?’ Tina asked.</p><p>‘Iz cute. Wanna cuddle it,’ Carnelian replied.</p><p>Tina looked up at Newt, eyes wide in exasperation. They’d had this conversation more times than he could count since Carnelian had decided the Nundu was his favourite. Newt had hoped some of the many skills he had accrued looking after beasts would carry over to raising a child, but he was regularly disappointed in that regard.</p><p>Tina hefted Carnelian back onto her hip, both arms held tight around his small form. It was time to take him back upstairs before he upset the Nundu again. Dougal followed her. She moved to walk up the stairs but stopped on the bottom step.</p><p>‘Remember that Jacob’s coming around in an hour or so. I don’t want you to be fiddling down here when he arrives,’ she said sternly.</p><p>‘I wouldn’t dare, ma’am,’ Newt said teasingly.</p><p>Tina gave him a threatening stare and walked up the stairs, Dougal climbing on the railing beside her. Newt watched her go, a smile finding its way onto his face. The last three years of working against Grindelwald and trying to raise Carnelian had been nothing short of stressful, but he would never say that it wasn’t worth every second.</p><p>He finished slicing the meat, slipping a small piece to Mildred as a thank you. He collected the rest of the slices into a steel bucket, ready to make the feeding rounds, so that he could be ready for when Jacob arrived.</p><p align="center">

</p><p>‘Who’s my favourite godson?’ Jacob said excitedly.</p><p>Carnelian rushed into Jacob’s outstretched arms and allowed Jacob to pick him up.</p><p>‘I is! I is!’ Carnelian shouted as Jacob spun him around.</p><p>Newt watched on with amusement. He sometimes thought that Carnelian liked Jacob more than him; his son certainly acted like he did.</p><p>‘You got present for me?’ Carnelian asked when Jacob put him down again.</p><p>‘Carnelian, you shouldn’t expect a present every time Jacob comes to visit,’ Tina scolded.</p><p>Tina’s words didn’t faze Carnelian in the slightest. He continued to look up at Jacob expectantly, as if he could make a gift appear from thin air. Which he had done once before, except the gift had immediately caught fire, and had taken Newt and Tina an entire afternoon to repair the damage.</p><p>Of course, Jacob was the most over-indulgent godfather on the planet, so he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small wrapped gift. Carnelian snatched it from his hands and started tearing the paper off. Inside was a small toy horse that moved up and down. Carnelian squealed in excitement, running into the living room to play with it.</p><p>‘My scolding doesn’t work as well when you immediately undermine it,’ Tina huffed.</p><p>‘What can I say? I love the little guy!’ Jacob said, an unapologetic smile on his face.</p><p>‘Do you want some tea? I was just making some for Tina,’ Newt asked, before Tina could respond.</p><p>‘If it’s no problem,’ Jacob said.</p><p>Newt went to the kitchen to prepare the tea, while Tina led Jacob into the living room to look after Carnelian. After a few moments, while he was letting the tea brew, Jacob came into the kitchen.</p><p>‘Your kid has so much energy,’ Jacob said, chuckling slightly.</p><p>‘I’m not entirely sure where it comes from. Tina and I are both reasonably calm,’ Newt said.</p><p>‘I think it’s just kids.’</p><p>Newt laughed in agreement. He stirred the tea he had made slightly and handed one of the cups to Jacob. The two of them stood in comfortable silence for a moment until Newt noticed Jacob shifting awkwardly.</p><p>‘Did you come in here to speak with me without Tina?’ Newt asked.</p><p>The look Jacob gave him was one of such surprise that it confirmed Newt’s theory. He tried not to be too offended at Jacob’s surprise that he had caught on to what Jacob was thinking. Newt may not be the most socially confident of people, but even he could pick up on obvious cues. He gave Jacob a stern look that had been used plenty of times of Carnelian.</p><p>‘Uh, yeah, I did,’ Jacob said.</p><p>Newt raised his eyebrows while taking a sip of his tea, urging Jacob to continue. Jacob fortunately picked up on it and placed his mug on the counter.</p><p>‘Theseus wanted me to ask – and I’m curious myself, to be completely honest – when you were going to propose to Tina.’</p><p>Any tea that had made it from the mug to Newt’s mouth was spat out across the floor in surprise. The question had caught Newt completely off-guard. He had thought the whole marriage debate he’d been having with his brother and Jacob had gone onto the backburner. If he was honest, he had been so focused on raising Carnelian and spending time with Tina that he’d forgotten about marriage completely.</p><p>That thought made Newt chuckle inwardly. Only a few years ago he had been desperately worried about what high society thought of his strange living arrangement. A few near-death encounters with Grindelwald and Dementors put it all into perspective however, and now Newt was not so bothered about it all.</p><p>‘I don’t know, Jacob. I haven’t given it much thought.’</p><p>Jacob surprisingly did not seem shocked at his answer. He nodded slowly, accepting Newt’s words with ease.</p><p>‘I told Theseus as much. You and Tina have a good thing going.’</p><p>‘Can you two get back in here? I don’t appreciate being left with a three-year-old for conversation!’ Tina shouted from the living room, interrupting their conversation. Both Newt and Jacob called back confirmations, and Newt rewarmed the tea he had made for her with a flick of his wand. As they walked back into the living room, Jacob held Newt back for a moment.</p><p>‘Just… think about the marriage stuff, alright?’</p><p>Newt gave a half-smile in acknowledgement before joining in with Tina and Carnelian.</p><p align="center">

</p><p>The day had passed quickly. Jacob had been able to spend some time with his Godson, and Newt and Tina were able to relax a bit from parenting, instead enjoying the company of a friend. It was now late in the evening, with Carnelian put to bed. Tina had placed a Warning Charm in his room in case anything went wrong, and Dougal was also in the room, keeping watch. For now, Newt, Jacob and Tina could relax with some vintage firewhiskey, engaged in discussion.</p><p>‘How bad is it? Newt and I have been reasonably far removed from the resistance to Grindelwald,’ Tina asked. Jacob’s expression darkened, and the jolly air of the evening dampened slightly.</p><p>‘It’s bad. Really bad. Another wizarding bank in France crashed, just last week. Now there’s this breakout from the German prison; it’s all been pretty stressful for Dumbledore and Theseus.’</p><p>‘How badly are people being affected by these bank crashes? We seem to be no worse,’ Newt asked.</p><p>‘A lot of people are losing a lot of money, in both wizarding and non-wizarding areas. Gringotts got lucky, as the goblins were at least slightly prepared for something going wrong. Places like Germany have it awful. The majority of people have lost all the money they had stored.</p><p>‘It’s forcing them out onto the street, where Grindelwald sweeps them up. His movement is getting more and more successful. My lot are getting the blame for this, just as he wanted,’ Jacob said, bitterness sneaking into his tone.</p><p>‘We always knew Grindelwald would manipulate this situation into anti-Muggle propaganda,’ Tina said, not unkindly.</p><p>‘Yeah, I know. It just feels gross that someone could use a crisis like this as a political move,’ Jacob said.</p><p>Newt raised his glass slightly in agreement. It kept him awake at night, the idea that Grindelwald could see a humanitarian crisis like the bank crisis and see it only as a positive. Sometimes it made him wonder why Queenie was still with him. Did she now support him completely? Why else would she have made no contact in the seven years since the events in Paris?</p><p>He never voiced these concerns about Queenie to Tina or Jacob. They both had deeper emotional connections to her and needed no reminding of why she wasn’t here with them, trying to make sense of a three-year-old’s thoughts. Queenie’s choices had been made many years ago, and they were set in stone now. There was nothing more to add about them.</p><p>‘Right, it’s getting late. I should be getting back before Theseus sends an Auror team to rescue me from Nurmengard,’ Jacob said, glancing at the clock on the wall.</p><p>‘It was a pleasure to see you again,’ Newt said, pulling Jacob into a strong hug.</p><p>‘Just put a ring on her, okay?’ Jacob whispered into Newt’s ear before pulling away.</p><p>Newt watched as Jacob gave his goodbyes to Tina and accepted an order he wouldn’t follow about giving gifts to Carnelian, but his thoughts were on the future, and marriage. Should he propose to Tina? She was the love of his life, without a single doubt. It just seemed a little strange to do it after seven years of a relationship and a son.</p><p>However, as Jacob gave him an extremely unsubtle glare, shifting his gaze between Tina and Newt as he left the home, Newt realised there was no question. He should propose to Tina. For once, letting the world know a detail about his private life didn’t seem so bad. Their relationship should be made as legitimate as possible, through every legal avenue. Tina was his partner, and he didn’t want to hide it anymore. Grindelwald may be growing stronger, and the world more dangerous and uncertain, but Newt <em>could </em>be certain of one thing: his relationship with Tina.</p><p>Now all he needed was a ring and some time. </p>
