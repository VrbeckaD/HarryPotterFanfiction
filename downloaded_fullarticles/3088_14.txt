    <p>“So I’ve been thinking” Harry said from where his head was laid on Draco’s bare chest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“About” Draco said as he trailed his hands up and down, Harry’s porcelain skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Maybe we should make our relationship official.” Harry suggested and Draco stiffened. They had been sleeping with each other for about eight months now. But neither had thought to address the unspoken issue, although Harry was developing feelings for the blond.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry” Draco sighed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No look, I mean, we can speak to your parents first you know and then your friends. I know how important Blaise and Pansy are to you. And I mean we don’t have to worry about Ron and Hermione bec-“ Harry’s rambling was cut off as Draco stood abruptly and began to dress.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Look Harry, I don’t know what you think this is but I don’t feel that way about you” Draco lied. He had fallen just as deep for Harry as Harry did for him. But he was too afraid of what others would say if they knew he and Harry were in a relationship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What are you saying” Harry said as he sat himself up on his elbows and his eyes began to glance over.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m saying that this was just sex for me, nothing more, nothing less.” Draco said as he finished putting on his robe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I see” Harry said, voice full of emotions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sorry but I’m a Malfoy and we Malfoys have reputations to uphold and I just cant-”Draco said but was cut off by a laugh</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I get it, you can’t be seen with me” Harry said with a nod as he thought about what Draco had just said and how dumb the boy should feel. Harry was the heir to two ancient houses, albeit only he, Sirius and his account managers were aware, but still. He was just as good as Draco if not better. Ever since he had found out about his true lineage and wealth, he decided that he wouldn’t tell anyone until he was ready. He had already found out that his “friends” weren’t relly his friends and that the man who he had thought of as a grandfather, was just using him for ulterior motives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sorry” Draco said before rushing out of the Room of Requirement. As soon as the blond left, Harry began to laugh. He laughed hard and long until he began to cry, soon those became tears of sorrow as he mourned the loss of the first boy he had ever loved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But soon, he stopped and composed himself. Right then and there, he decided that this summer, he would grow into the heir that he was supposed to be and carry himself in a manner befitting of his station. He would show them; he would show all of them.</p>
