    <p>
  <span>Hermione Granger loved being a witch. She loved the magical world she found herself in, like Alice Through the Looking Glass. She wanted to know </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span> about it, which was exactly why she found herself in Headmaster Dumbledore’s richly appointed office in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She had, perhaps foolishly, signed up for every elective class the school offered, from Ancient Runes to Muggle Studies. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Miss Granger, you are sure you wish to take</span>
  <em>
    <span> allI</span>
  </em>
  <span> of the classes?” Headmaster Dumbledore repeated. “You are muggleborn, surely Muggle Studies is unnecessary…?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, but the chance to see the muggle world from the wizarding perspective is so </span>
  <em>
    <span>unique</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” Hermione enthused without guile. “It might even give me some ideas on how to help eliminate blood prejudice in the future, Headmaster!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus Dumbledore chuckled, his eyes sparkling behind his half-moon glasses. “Then, Miss Granger, this is for you.” He held out a necklace to her, it was gold, and made of several rotating disks, with some kind of glass in the center. Curious, she reached out to touch it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And everything exploded.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span></span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione woke up with a headache and coughing as if she was about to vomit. Shaking her head to clear her bleary vision, she found herself in some sort of cell. There was no preternatural cold, or feeling of dread,  so she knew it couldn’t Azkaban, the prison she had been reading about since the escape of Sirius Black, but she still didn’t know where she was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello?” She tried, her voice slightly hoarse. “Is anyone there? I don’t know where I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The devil’s backbone of the wizarding world, girlie.” A gritty voice said from the other side of the right wall. “Welcome to the black cells.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But...but I haven’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>done</span>
  </em>
  <span> anything.” Hermione said, her voice approaching panic. “I was just in Professor Dumbledore’s office, and then…” She staggered to her feet. “How...what...why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A likely story.” A different wizard said, holding up the golden necklace that Dumbledore had tried to give her, staring at her from the other side of the bars. “And just what were you doing with this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor Dumbledore gave it to me.” Hermione defended, instantly. “He called me to his office to talk about my class schedule, and he said it was for me, and when I took it, I ended up here. I don’t even know what it is!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The wizard rattled the bars, leaning over towards her in his dark red robes. “Ridiculous! You’re telling me you ended up </span>
  <em>
    <span>here</span>
  </em>
  <span> setting off every alarm in the place and you don’t even know what it </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” He reached into his robes and drew out a crystal vial. “Well, we’ll find out the </span>
  <em>
    <span>truth</span>
  </em>
  <span> soon enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m telling the truth!” Hermione wailed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before the wizard could respond, a witch appeared on the stairs behind him, running down the stairs, with a wizard behind her. “Harwin!” She shouted, blonde hair flying behind her. “What, </span>
  <em>
    <span>by Circe</span>
  </em>
  <span>, do you think you are </span>
  <em>
    <span>doing!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hallow.” The wizard growled. “Interrogation on illegal temporal abuse.” He turned on her. “What are </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> doing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stopping you from showing just how </span>
  <em>
    <span>big</span>
  </em>
  <span> of an idiot you are.” The witch snarled. “Look at what you’re holding in your hand. It’s not a true time turner. It couldn’t go back more than five hours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So?” The wizard challenged. “It’s still illegal.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not if she got permission in her time!” The witch shot back. She waved her wand and the bars disappeared. “Hermione, love, why did you have the time-turner?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione didn’t know how the witch knew her name, but she was glad </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone </span>
  </em>
  <span>was defending her from the overly large and aggressive wizard. “Professor Dumbledore gave it to me.” She explained. “I’m about to start third year, and I wanted to take </span>
  <em>
    <span>all</span>
  </em>
  <span> the classes, because they all sounded so </span>
  <em>
    <span>fascinating</span>
  </em>
  <span>, I didn’t want to miss anything. He didn’t even explain what it was, he held it out to me and when I touched it…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The thin wizard, who had come down the stairs with the witch, snorted. “She’s just like you, Demona.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The witch scoffed, and held out her hand to Hermione. “Come here, sweetheart. You didn’t do anything wrong.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione let out a breath of relief, and stepped toward the witch, giving the now red-faced wizard a wide berth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now see here, Hallow!” The man began to bellow. “You don’t know she’s telling the truth! Her story makes no sense!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The witch, Hallow, apparently, rolled her eyes. “It does if you can add two and two, Harwin. Tell me, what happens to a temporally displaced person, when they encounter a concentration of time energy, like that within a time turner?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What child wants to take every class?” Harwin demanded. “It’s more likely just a ruse to get her hands on a turner!”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you </span>
  <em>
    <span>met</span>
  </em>
  <span> any of your co-workers, Harwin?” The thin wizard drawled. “Every unspeakable in my cell took ten N.E.W.Ts, and most of us took them </span>
  <em>
    <span>all</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione was conceived over Christmas 1958.” Hallow explained. “But she was born on September 19, 1979. Her magic knew she was temporally displaced, so when she touched the time-turner, it snapped her like a muggle gum-band into where she would be in her natural timeline, were she not displaced.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how do you know </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Harwin snarled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because twelve hours of labour is hard to forget, you entitled mouth-breathing salamander!” Hallow exploded at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My parents are muggles.” Hermione whispered, freezing. “I’m muggleborn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hallow turned back to the girl, slowly. “No, sweetheart.” She breathed, softly. “Helen and Richard...they’ve been your parents, and they are muggles, but Richard is the grandson of a squib. I…” She swallowed. “I didn’t realise I was pregnant, and I was on assignment when I discovered it, but by the time I did, it was too dangerous for me to travel back here, so the Ministry had me stay there. After you were born...you were too young for time-travel, Hermione, and the Ministry wouldn’t give me leave to stay, they said my displacement for long enough to let you come with me would have too much effect on the timeline. They ordered me to give you up.” She closed her eyes and swallowed hard. “I couldn’t just...throw you into the muggle world, so I found Great-Uncle Iago’s family, and watched them, to make sure they would care for you, that they would love you...and I altered their memories to make you their daughter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione wanted to be angry, remembering every slur or dirty look she had gotten for being muggleborn, every condescending word for not understanding some unwritten rule in wizarding culture. She </span>
  <em>
    <span>wanted</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be angry, but the witch looked as though she was still tortured by the decision. She hadn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>wanted</span>
  </em>
  <span> to give up Hermione, and unlike Professor Dumbledore, who had abandoned Harry to uncaring relatives, the witch had given her a good home and loving parents. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s your name?” Hermione asked, finally. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Desdemona.” The witch said softly. “Desdemona Hallow, but before I was married it was Desdemona Dagworth-Granger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione swallowed hard. “And my father?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nikomedes Hallow.” Desdemona answered with a smile. “He’s an Unspeakable as well, though he’s in the field at the moment. He’ll dote on you. He was infuriated when he found out about you and what the Ministry decided. He’s gotten you cards and presents for every birthday and Christmas since.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She has no clearance to leave the cells!” Harwin shouted. “Accident or not, she still has knowledge of the future! The possible damage to the timeline is incalculable, especially if she gets it in her head to change the future!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are ways around that, Samson.” The thin wizard replied. “If we were to place her back in the time she started in, she could easily find herself here again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Obliviation of a minor could cause serious memory problems for the rest of her life and adversely affect her magic.” Harwin pointed out. “Better to put her back into her own timeline and swear her to secrecy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There is another way.” The thin wizard pointed out. “She’d have memories, but they would be as dreams. There could then be webs cast, that others would remember as it should have been, using the existing memories as a skeleton to build upon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s her choice.” Desdemona said, quite suddenly. “The Ministry made the choice for her before, she can choose this time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Demona, she’s a minor, in all technicalities, you get the choice.” The thin wizard pointed out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, Quil.” Desdemona replied, with a smile at Hermione. “But no matter how badly I want her to stay, she has her own mind. She can choose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione stared at the witch, before glancing at the wizards. “I...could I go back and contact you in the future?” She asked, biting her lip. “I could owl you, couldn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Desdemona shook her head. “The Ministry wouldn’t allow it. If you go back, you won’t remember this, and Niko and I are forbidden from contacting you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They shouldn’t be able to do that!” Hermione snarled. “I’ve been called mudblood for two years, teased for not knowing things...I was petrified by a basilisk last year for being a muggleborn. They shouldn’t have made you do it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Desdemona could only give her a sad smile. “I’m sorry, sweetheart.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione took a deep breath and set her shoulders. “I’ve made my decision.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span></span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cressida Hallow woke with a yawn and a blink. Her squashed-faced orange half-kneazle kitten was dancing on her kidneys and she laughed as she pulled him up to her chest and snuggled him mercilessly. “Good morning, Crookshanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mrawr.” Crookshanks replied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A knock on the door followed. “Honey, are you awake?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Mum!” Cressida answered, stretching as she got out of bed, with an extra scritch behind the ears for Crookshanks. She pulled out her favourite light blue robes and practically skipped over to her mother’s room. The door was open so she slid inside excitedly, handing her mother the brush. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Desdemona chuckled as she sat Cressida down at her dressing table, and began to brush her hair, working charms through it to control the frizz. “Did you sleep well, darling?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I had the most amazing dream!” Cressida replied. “Ron, Harry and I were on a mission to save the Philosopher’s stone, and there were </span>
  <em>
    <span>giant chess pieces</span>
  </em>
  <span>. We had to play across the board.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope they weren’t relying on your chess ability.” Desdemona chuckles, as she worked beads into her daughter’s hair. “Your father despairs your lack of chess ability.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Ron did it.” Cressida reassured her. “I can’t really remember much else. We thought someone was after the stone, but it turned out it was someone else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it’s rarely the first person you expect.” Desdemona echoed. “Are you excited to go to Hogsmeade today with Auntie Dervish?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione nodded, accidentally pulling on her hair and wincing. “Yep. It’s the first time people my age will be in Hogsmeade. Auntie Dervish says I can go and make friends after I help open the shop.” Auntie Dervish wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>actually</span>
  </em>
  <span> her aunt, but she was a member of the coven Cressida had been raised in and was still being educated by, so everyone was treated as family. It made things get a little strange sounding sometimes, but it was tradition. Cressida didn’t mind. She liked having multiple uncles and aunts and more grandparents than biologically possible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Before you head off with Auntie Dervish, stop and see Grandmother Prince, she has a favour to ask of you.” Finished with Cressida’s hair, Desdemona stepped back, checking the curls that floated about her head. “You look nice, Cress.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Mum.” Cressida replied with a smile, touching one of the silver beads strung through her hair. It was brighter than normal silver and gleamed as her fingers ran over the runes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cressida reached into her pocket and handed over a small purse. “While you’re in Hogsmeade, stop in Honeydukes for me and grab some fizzing whizbees for your father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is Dad still due back tonight?” Cressida asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Barring any complications, so don’t fill up on sweets.” Desdemona warned. “And have a good day.”</span>
