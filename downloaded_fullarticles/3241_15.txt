</p><p>Harry wasn’t ready to come out to the Wizarding World, let alone tell his friends and family he’d been secretly dating a former Death Eater for eight months. Draco hadn’t mind at first, it had all started as a casual fling, a way to let out all their frustrations. But when his feelings turned into something deeper, he felt like an embarrassing secret that Harry preferred to keep locked in a box, hidden in a dirty basement. Draco didn’t want to hide anymore; for Harry, he was willing to face the outrage their relationship might cause.</p><p>He didn’t mean for things to get so out of control when he confronted Harry about it, but he should’ve known better: there was no easy way for Draco Malfoy to talk with Harry Potter. The discussion quickly escalated, and they were suddenly shouting on each other’s faces.</p><p>“You may be the Saviour of the Wizarding World, but you’re a fucking <em>coward</em>, Harry Potter!” he said with a sneer.</p><p>Harry blinked, and took a step back, bewildered. Their ragged breathing was the only thing that could be heard in the cold of Draco’s bedroom.</p><p>“Hark who’s talking, <em>Slytherin</em>,” Harry whispered.</p><p>Draco’s eyes widened, his jaw clenched. He felt more hurt than he wanted to admit, as memories of wrong choices and sixth year flashed through his eyes.</p><p>Harry gave him one last look, a look full of...anger. And he disapparated, leaving Draco standing there, with the cold of the night piercing through his lungs, feeling like the world was slowly falling apart around him.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <strong>June 28th, 2002.</strong>
</p><p>It was a nice Friday morning; the weather was perfect.</p><p>Pansy would arrive any minute now for their weekly breakfast date. Draco had already set the table and placed plates of scrambled eggs and crispy bacon, perfectly toasted slices of bread, a bowl of varied berries, a pumpkin juice pitcher, and a kettle full of delicious hot tea. He discovered he had a sort of talent for cooking; it was rather soothing. He sat, waiting for Pansy as he picked the <em>Morning Prophet,</em> and lifted his steamy cup to give it a nice sip.</p><p>His hand stopped in midair.</p><p>A moving picture of Harry Potter and the girl Weasley covered most of the front page.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>“It’s Official! Harry Potter And Ginny Weasley Will Tie The Knot In Mid-September.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>(Pages 2 to 5).”</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They looked happy, smiling for the camera and looking at each other like the world could burst into flames around them, and they wouldn’t even notice.</p><p>It was as if a pair of cold hands had gotten into Draco’s chest and were squeezing, twisting, and <em>clawing</em> at his heart. He knew it would eventually happen, but he still wasn’t ready to accept the reality of it. The knuckles of his left hand were stark white as he clutched the newspaper, a contrasting burning-hot sensation was making its way from his sternum up to his throat. He had to close his eyes, and will the sudden dizziness away, but the ache in his chest remained.</p><p>“Are you alright, darling?” Pansy was standing at his right with a curious look on her face. He didn’t even notice her entering the room.</p><p>“Yes. Yes, I’m fine,” Draco said quickly, blinking the blurriness away while putting the paper face down on the table, and rearranged his features. He took a sip of his tea and smiled. “How have you been, Pans? Any new gossip?”</p><p>“Oh, darling. <em>Where</em> to start,” she said excitedly as she took her seat, and reached for the berries. There was no better way to distract her than asking for the latest scandal. “I went shopping the other day and you won’t <em>believe</em> who I bumped into–”</p><p>Draco’s mind drifted. He could still hear Pansy’s voice, but it sounded like she was ten feet away. His brain filled with memories of heated kisses, promises of ‘forever,’ bright green eyes, and silky black hair.</p><p>“–left Knockturn Alley with significantly fuller lips, rumor has it something went wrong because her mouth burst with the most <em>hideous</em> blisters you can imagine. Not even the best Healers at St. Mungo’s have been able to get rid–”</p><p>“Potter’s wedding is in September,” he blurted out before he could stop himself.</p><p>Pansy dropped her fork, it clattered noisily against her plate. She looked at him, gaping and wide-eyed. Her gaze fell over the paper beside Draco’s plate, and she wordlessly summoned it, gasping at the sight of the front page.</p><p>“Oh, Draco.” She left the Prophet aside, and  grabbed his hand, giving it a squeeze. Her brows creased with worry and sympathy. “You knew this day would come, darling, you’ve known for months. I–you might think it’s easy for me to say, but you have got to move on. He clearly has.”</p><p>“I don’t know if I can. I try, but...Pansy, I–I <em>can’t</em> forget.” His eyes burned. He let out a shaky breath, trying to steel himself. He would not break, not again.</p><p>“It’s not about forgetting, Draco dear, it’s about acceptance.” She caressed his knuckles with her thumb. “It’s impossible to forget all your history together, and I’m positive he, too, will always remember. You have to cherish the good moments, and learn from the bad ones. I know things had a rather nasty ending, but you need to find a way to get a proper closure.”</p><p>When Harry…no, <em>Potter—</em>he could never be ‘Harry’ for him again. When Potter left, they never spoke afterwards. Draco’s mind was full of questions: were Potter’s sweet whispers just to humor him? Was it all a lie? What happened when he got home that night? Did he smash the objects he found nearest, like Draco had? Or did he just sit in his living room, watching his preposterous<em> 'telly’</em> contraption?</p><p>There were so many words left unspoken, many feelings kept hidden and so, so many apologies; Draco didn’t sleep thinking about it. He spent countless nights writing letters for Potter that were never sent, letters that ended up burning to ashes in the fireplace.</p><p>Draco had cloistered himself in his flat for three months. He had managed to go outside only when Pansy burst into his bedroom at dawn—he later learned his mother had owled her, asking for help. Not only did she <em>literally</em> hexed his bollocks off, but also threatened to make him wear them as a nice <em>mustache</em> if he didn’t get out of bed.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>Months later, after <em>Th</em><em>e</em> <em>Prophet</em> announced the Potter-Weasley engagement, Draco wondered if Potter was really happy, if he didn’t ache for Draco as Draco ached for him, if he’d found in Ginevra what Draco had failed to give him.</p><p>“Please, darling, don’t let this rot you down.” Pansy had been watching Draco as he lost himself in his thoughts. “I still think you'll look wonderful with your balls hanging down your nose, so don't try me.” She gave him a quivering smile as tears ran down her cheeks.</p><p>Draco bit his lip. He was unable to stop his own tears, hot against his cold skin.</p><p>He had felt a sharp stab of pain when he saw the front page that was now laying beside Pansy’s glass of pumpkin juice. He asked himself if it was genuine, the way Potter looked at his girlfriend like there was nothing more beautiful in this world; he needed to know, to see for himself.</p><p>Pansy was right. He needed closure, and Draco thought he knew how to get it.</p>
