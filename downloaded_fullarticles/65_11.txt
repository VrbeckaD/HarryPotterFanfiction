    <p>“So, you’re Head Boy now, are you?”</p>
<p>Percy looked up from his timetable, which he was meticulously filling in with his study schedule for the year. Wood was there, leaning with crossed arms against a bookshelf. Percy pushed his horn-rimmed glasses up his nose. He could already feel himself getting agitated, but he was determined not to show it. He didn’t know what it was about the other boy that made him so touchy. His brash attitude or absurd accent probably had something to do with it. Or the way he seemed to relish in making Percy’s life difficult. Instead of letting on to his annoyance, he schooled his face into his perfectly practiced look of superiority and apathy. </p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, yes, Wood, I was awarded the position.” </p>
<p>“Come on, Weasley. You could take that wand out of your arse for once and look happy about it. Or leave the library to celebrate. You’re aware classes haven’t started yet, right?” </p>
<p>Percy forced his eyebrow not to twitch. He lifted it in derision instead. </p>
<p>“The title of Head Boy is an honor and should be worn with the utmost dignity at all times. Not that I’d expect you to understand.” </p>
<p>Oliver snorted, and Percy allowed himself to narrow his eyes. </p>
<p>“Oh for Merlin’s sake, Weasley. Head Boy’s impressive enough, but it’s not everything. It’s not as impressive as say, being Quidditch Captain four years in a row.” The prat had the nerve to smirk now, a cocky, lopsided smile that made it hard to forget the last time he gave Percy a look like that. Or the few times before that. He pushed those thoughts back, determinedly not staring at Wood’s mouth. Or the strong line of his jaw. And he definitely did not watch his throat bob when he swallowed. The arse was insulting him, for Merlin’s sake. He couldn’t be distracted because of something that happened months ago. Pushing back images of slick skin and half-removed clothing, he threw down his quill and turned to face Oliver. </p>
<p>“Yes, you’re right,” he bit out in his most scathing tone. “It’s much more impressive to be the best at mindlessly throwing about balls and riding around on broomsticks.” </p>
<p>The other boy’s smirk fell away. </p>
<p>“It takes a lot more tact and thought to play a good game than it does to memorize and spew back information. Or than it does to be an insufferable, brown nosing toss pot.” </p>
<p>Percy pushed himself away from his table and out of his chair. The other boy’s eyes slid up and down his body when he did, despite the annoyance still coloring them. He ignored that for the moment and focused on his anger. </p>
<p>“Then I’m surprised you can handle the responsibility,” he snapped back, hating how shrill his voice was. Maybe Fred and George were right. His tone was vaguely reminiscent of their mother’s. He was pulled away from his thoughts by Oliver stepping toward him. He tried not to notice the muscles rippling under his form fitting sweater. </p>
<p>“Well I’m surprised you can pull your lips away from McGonagall’s arse long enough to do your job properly.”</p>
<p>Percy’s mouth dropped open. That certainly distracted him from Oliver’s arms. </p>
<p>“I—wha—I do not,” he cut off when Wood stepped closer to him again, chuckling as he approached. That dangerous smile was back on his face. He wasn’t sure he liked the glint in the other boy’s eyes. Or maybe he liked it too much. He had an unfortunate tendency to get his thoughts all muddled at times like this. Percy took a step back, but Oliver wasn’t deterred. He matched Percy step for step, continuing even when Percy was stopped by an unfortunately placed bookshelf. He moved in so close that Percy had to tilt his head down to meet his eyes. He could feel Oliver’s breath on his lips and the heat of his chest millimeters away from his own. He was having increasing trouble trying to form words.</p>
<p>“Have I ever told you it’s kind of cute when you get all flustered?” He whispered, his accent even thicker at low volume. Percy couldn’t think. He had no more smart comebacks, just quickly crumbling willpower. He’d told himself over summer he wouldn’t let this happen, repeated it to himself over and over again until he final he started to believe it, and here he was breaking that promise to himself within a few hours of being back at Hogwarts. Hah. Some Head Boy he’d make with resolve like that. Instead of lingering on that thought he let himself do what he’d wanted but wouldn’t admit since Oliver had interrupted him. </p>
<p>“Oh, shut it,” he said before leaning up and capturing Oliver’s lips in a fiery kiss. The other boy hesitated just long enough for Percy to wonder if he’d made a mistake before enthusiastically throwing himself into the kiss. Calloused hands moved to his neck and cheek to bring them closer together. Oliver’s body moved into his, pressing in so he could feel every lined could feel the heat radiating off of him. He was always so warm, Percy was starting to wonder if there was actual fire under his skin. Percy found his arms wrapping around Oliver in return, hands clutching those broad shoulders. He was so engrossed in their kissing that he’d all but forgotten where they were. Then Oliver’s hand slid from his neck, down his side, between his body and the bookshelf he was so crudely pressed against to squeeze one arse cheek. He jolted back to reality like he’d been hit with a stunning spell.</p>
<p>“Wait,” he gasped, ripping his lips from Oliver’s. “Not here. Madame Pince—“</p>
<p>“Is on the other side of the library,” Oliver returned in his rough brogue. He used his grip on Percy’s arse to grind their hips together. Percy sucked in a breath when their hard cocks rubbed against each other. He had to focus. He had a point. He moved his hands to Oliver’s chest and gave a half-hearted nudge. </p>
<p>“But she or anyone else could walk by at any time.”</p>
<p>“No one’s in the library on the first day of term but you, Weasley. And Madame Pince just thinks you’re being your usual boring self back here.” </p>
<p>Percy didn’t dignify the insult with a response. Instead he twisted is head away from Oliver’s searching mouth.</p>
<p>“The school rules clearly state that public—“</p>
<p>“Bloody hell, you’d think a good snog would get you to loosen up for once.” </p>
<p>A flare of anger surged through him, destroying any warm feelings that had been building up inside him. Oliver always had to ruin things by talking too much. He pushed him away with more force, summoning his best Molly Weasley glare.</p>
<p>“You’re such a prat,” he snapped. </p>
<p>Oliver snorted. </p>
<p>“I see you had a dry summer, then. You’re much more relaxed when you’ve been shagging regularly.”</p>
<p>“I don’t- I’d never- it’s none of your business who I have or haven’t been with over the holiday,” he sputtered. The comment did not at all sting more because he’d had a couple dates and an almost-summer romance in between touring Egypt with his family, he told himself. Not at all. Oliver raised a cocky eyebrow at his blubbering, moving in and crowding him against the bookshelf again. </p>
<p>“Didn’t say I cared,” he said, framing Percy’s head with his arms. “I just know you’re more uptight when it’s been a while.” </p>
<p>“You don’t know anything about me,” Percy hissed. </p>
<p>“Don’t I?” Oliver countered, leaning close to whisper gruffly in his ear. “I know that this,” he paused to nip at Percy’s earlobe, drawing a whimper out of him, “always gets you to make that noise.” Percy gulped, unable to make his mouth form any sort of comeback. Oliver continued at his silence, “And I know that all your rubbish about Madame Pince and staying out of your business is just to distract me from this.” He brought one hand own to the front of Percy’s pants, squeezing just enough to send shivers through his whole body.  He had to stop this, before he was too far gone. This was a bad idea. He just had to get his bloody mouth to work right. He swallowed hard again, mustering up all his strength before opening his mouth.</p>
<p>“I hate you.”</p>
<p>Well. That wasn’t exactly what he’d been going for. His traitorous body didn’t seem to care, his hands moving back to Oliver’s shoulders, grabbing fistfuls of his sweater and drawing him closer. This was decidedly not stopping. He should really care more than he did. </p>
<p>Oliver huffed out a hot laugh against his neck. </p>
<p>“I don’t much like you, either, Weasley. But you have to admit it makes things much more interesting.” </p>
<p>Percy opened his mouth to retort, but all that came out was a low moan when Oliver pulled his collar aside and clamped down hard on the nape of his neck. He snapped his mouth shut, feeling his face flush in arousal and embarrassment. He brought his hand to Oliver’s hair to give it a sharp tug in retaliation. </p>
<p>Oliver growled and unlatched himself from Percy’s neck, capturing his lips in a bruising kiss instead. He responded with equal fervor. Their hands moved so fast he could barely keep up, rucking up shirts and tugging on trouser buttons and zippers. It was always like this between them. Always racing to see who could get the other off faster, always trying to make the other moan louder, always competing to make the other weak with pleasure. Percy hated how addicting it was. Their hands slipped into each other’s trousers almost simultaneously. Oliver grunted when Percy wasted no time in jerking him off roughly, responding with equal fervor, hungrily swallowing up the whimpers Percy couldn’t contain. The rough drag of Oliver’s hand on him had him shivering, rushing toward the edge too fast and he knew he had to do something. He’d never hear the end of it if he came first again. He slid his free hand around to Oliver’s back, dragging his fingernails across the exposed skin he found there. The hand on Oliver’s cock doubled its efforts, thumb flicking over the head on each stroke. Oliver groaned, his rhythm faltering, nails digging into Percy’s hip. Percy pulled his mouth away from Oliver’s, nibbling across his jaw to hide his triumphant grin. </p>
<p>Riding high on the effect he was having on Oliver and the pleasure sparking from his abdomen, he slid his hand lower, running one finger teasingly over the crack of Oliver’s arse and tugging at his earlobe with his teeth. Oliver’s head fell backwards, a shudder wracking his body. Choked off sounds escaped his throat and his hand stilled on Percy’s cock, contracting in pleasure and unintentionally teasing him to the point of insanity. He thrust his hips into the loose circle of Oliver’s fingers as his own slid lower. Percy twisted the hand stroking at his cock and pressed lightly at his hole. Oliver lurched forward, rutting desperately into his hand, mouth latching onto his skin once again. He moaned long and low into Percy’s skin, shaking hard as he spilled over his hand. </p>
<p>Percy let the triumphant grin slide onto his face as the other boy panted and leaned weakly against him. He stroked Oliver through it before slowly withdrawing his hands from Oliver’s trousers, pausing to wipe his messy hand off on Oliver’s jumper. </p>
<p>“Smug prat,” Oliver laughed weakly. </p>
<p>“I didn’t say anything,” he sniffed.</p>
<p>The hand that had fallen slack against Percy’s cock tightened. Oliver braced his free hand on the bookshelf, pushing himself up to look at him with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“I could feel that smirk from across the castle,” he bit back. He resumed a leisurely pace on Percy’s cock, just enough to get his breath hitching and his eyes falling shut. When his hips were rocking into the movement the hand on him sped up slightly, his head falling back onto the bookshelf behind him. Oliver took advantage of his bared neck, leaning in to lick and nip a trail of fire from the base of his throat up to his ear. “You won’t have anything to smirk about when I’m done with you,” he promised in a low growl. </p>
<p>Suddenly he was pulling back, sliding down Percy’s body and onto his knees. He tugged at Percy’s trousers and pants, pulling them down just enough for his cock to spring out. With no further warning he was swallowing Percy’s cock down as far as he could take it. Percy snapped a hand to his mouth to cover the strangled noise that ripped itself from his chest, his other hand twisting into silky brown hair. Oliver sucked him off hard and fast, bobbing his head in time with the uncontrollable rocking of Percy’s hips. He swallowed around Percy, moaning when his cock jerked violently and sending vibrations up his entire body. Two of Oliver’s fingers pressed into the sensitive spot behind his balls and it was all over. His hips stuttered, moaning into his hand and spilling into Oliver’s mouth. Oliver swallowed it all greedily, drawing his orgasm out until Percy was slumped weakly against the bookshelf. When he finally stopped shaking and released his death grip on Oliver’s hair, Oliver released him with a wet pop. </p>
<p>He wiped at his mouth with the back of his hand, smirking up at him with a raised eyebrow. </p>
<p>“That didn’t take long.”</p>
<p>The heat flared in Percy’s cheeks again.</p>
<p>“As if you’re one to talk” he hissed back. He forced himself upright, pushing past the boy still kneeling in front of him to snatch his wand from the table he’d been making his study schedule at to perform a quick cleaning spell. He’d just finished tucking himself back into his trousers when he felt a warm body press up behind him.</p>
<p>“I’m not ashamed to admit that a little hate shag turns me on,” Oliver practically purred. One arm wrapped around his waist, pressing him back against the line of Oliver’s body. “Maybe one day you won’t be, either.” With that, the warmth behind him was gone. He turned to see Oliver loping back toward the entrance.</p>
<p>“See you in the common room, Weasley,” he threw out over his shoulder. </p>
<p>Then Percy was alone, one thought making itself known in the silence left behind. </p>
<p>He really hated Oliver Wood.</p>
