          <div class="userstuff"><p>“The years have been good to you.” To Arthur, Molly looked just as beautiful as she had the day they met.</p>
<p>“And to you too,” she said, a smile spreading from her eyes to across her whole face.</p>
<p>He took her in. “What would you like to do today?”</p>
<p>She considered this. “The garden needs degnoming. And I have to prepare supper for the kids tonight.”</p>
<p>Their whole brood was coming for dinner, but the preparation excuse was a ruse. This was a special event. It was being catered.</p>
<p>“How about,” he suggested, “I take you somewhere special?”</p>
<p>She looked at him quizzically. She’d known he had something planned, of course, but had no idea what.</p>
<p>“Like where?” She narrowed her eyes suddenly. “Remember, Arthur, we have to be back by six.”</p>
<p>He shrugged. That was what Portkeys were for. “How do you feel about Majorca?”</p>
<p>She was silent for a minute, then melted into him. “Arthur! I’ve always wanted to see Majorca!”</p>
<p>He pulled her close. “We have an hour to get ready.” Pushing her away briefly, he looked into her eyes. “Happy anniversary, Molly.”</p>
<p>She beamed at him and leant in to kiss him. “Happy anniversary.”</p></div>
