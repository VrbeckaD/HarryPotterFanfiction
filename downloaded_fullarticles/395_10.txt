    <p>Autumn leaves fell above the blond who sauntered out of the building he just had class in. He's always enjoyed fall, the crunch of the leaves underneath his feet and the cold air sweeping in. </p><p>Draco Malfoy was holding his history book close to his chest as he walked down the pavement to a small cafe Pansy suggested they try. Draco wasn't going to turn her down, but she hadn't found time to meet him there. So, he decided to go on his own. </p><p>Draco wore a dark muted green sweater, some black jeans, and small black boots that went to his ankles. His blond hair was getting long, showing that he needed a haircut soon. Draco didn't mind his long hair, but he did not prefer it. The black boots he wore crunched small fallen leaves as he walked farther down the pathway. His silver eyes glistened upon the setting sun, a faint pink blush on his cheeks due to the cold air. </p><p>The grass around campus had turned a yellowish grey, making a loud noise once you set foot onto it. All the trees held an orange, red, yellow, or brown onto them. Green was rare to see on trees in mid November, but some held their place since summer.</p><p>The air smelt of apple cider and cinnamon as Draco reached the cafe. As he opened the door to the cafe he heard a small bell chime from the ceiling. Instead, it was just the small bronze bell at the top of the door alerting the baristas of a customer. </p><p>"Hello! Welcome to Owl's Coffee," A voice said as soon as Draco stepped his foot into the small cafe. He walked up to the counter to see an extremely familiar face.</p><p>The boy in front of him had round glasses, curly and untamable black hair, beautiful hazelnut brown eyes, a button nose, and a lighting bolt scar on his chocolate-colored forehead. Harry Potter was standing right in front of him. A soon as the two boys had made eye contact, a firm blush settled on the black haired boy. </p><p>" I didn't know you went to Hogwarts University, Malfoy." Harry said, looking down at his fingers which now were twisting together. His glasses slid down his nose, a small crack on the glasses showing in the light. </p><p>"I have been for two years, Potter." Draco averted his eyes away from the taller boy in front of him and look at the menu.</p><p>His eyes fixed onto the autumn themed section of the menu, finding a cinnamon pumpkin latte that sounded quite good. Every letter on the board looked as if it was typed, but it was known that someone wrote everything on the boards down with chalk. Draco felt the tingling feeling leaving his cheeks the longer he stood inside the warm building. </p><p dir="ltr"><br/>Harry nodded slowly as he looked up at Draco, his fingers reaching for the small pad he held on his apron. "So, what do you want to order?" He asked as he clicked the pen open with his thumb. Harry's fingers had bandaids covering the tips, and small ink doodles on his arms. His nails are chipped, red paint near his cuticles. </p><p dir="ltr">"I'll, um have a cinnamon pumpkin latte, large." Harry wrote Draco's order down quickly then tore out the small piece of paper.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry pulled out a small cup, scribbling something onto it. He walked up to one of the machines and bent down, opening the small refrigerator underneath the counter. Harry placed a jug of milk on the counter, pouring it into a small cup. He wondered over to an espresso machine, turning it on and letting the drink fall into the milk. After the liquid stop pouring out of the machine, Harry walked over to a set of small spices and poured a small amount of cinnamon into the cup. </p><p dir="ltr">Harry placed the cup before before Draco on the counter. He smiled softly at Draco as he wiped his hands on his apron.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll see you around, Malfoy." He waved as he walked back to put everything back up. The blush on Harry's cheeks slowly dissipating. </p><p dir="ltr">Draco walked out of the small café with the coffee cup on his lips. The frosted air wrapping around him, but the nice cup of coffee keeping him warm. Draco looked down at the cup in his hand to see a little phone number scribbled onto the side. He pulled out his phone from his pocket, then typed the number into his phone. </p><p dir="ltr"><em>'Hi, its </em><em>Malfoy' </em>He texted, hoping it was Harry that got the text. He closed his phone and continued to walk away from Owl's Coffee. The café Draco didn't think he'd be returning to. He walked to his apartment building on campus, and seized the flight stairs that led him up to the 6th floor. Draco unlocked the apartment 653, walking in and placing his stuff down on the kitchen counter. He finished off his coffee as he opened his phone and saw a text that read;</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>'its Harry, I hope you enjoyed the coffee!’ </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Draco's face turned pink, his eyes widening slightly. Harry Potter has his number, and has texted him. Draco's heart skipped many beats, his mind fluttering with thoughts.</p><p dir="ltr">Draco turned his phone off and brushed his hand through his light blond hair. He walked into his bathroom on turned on the sink, and splashed a handful of water onto his face.</p><p dir="ltr">The bathroom was all white, but he had a baby blue shower curtain. Honey soap and coconut shampoo littered the inside of the bath. </p><p dir="ltr">"Damnit Potter, I thought I was over you." Draco said to the mirror.</p><p dir="ltr">His eyes shutting as he sighed. He shook his head and walked to his bedroom, taking off the green sweater he was wearing. Draco pulled off his shoes and jeans, throwing on a pair of small shorts and a white shirt as he sat down into bed.</p><p dir="ltr">He'd tell Pansy and Blaise about what happened after he finished his homework. Draco didn't think that he was going to have a café encounter with Harry Potter. The hot-shot boy from high school who was his rival, and crush.</p>
