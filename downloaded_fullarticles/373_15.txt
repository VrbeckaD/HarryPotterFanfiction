    <p>Dan was standing in King’s Cross station. He saw countless people pass by, on their rush to whatever important thing they had to do today.<br/>
Dan had no clue what he was doing. He was from a normal family, who were completely non-magical. But here he was, with super special cool powers and no one to tell him how to use them.<br/>
His eyes wandered, looking for someone, anyone who might have a clue as to how he was supposed to get onto this supposed “Platform 9 and 3/4.”<br/>
A boy with jet black hair, glasses and a trolley filled with trunks and boxes appeared from the mass of people. He was with a ginger-haired lady, most likely his mother, and a tall ginger-haired boy that looked to be slightly older than the boy.<br/>
The closer the small group got to Dan the more hopeful he was that maybe they could help him.<br/>
Eventually the group was over to him.<br/>
“Hi!” Said the black-haired boy. “I’m Phil.”<br/>
He smiled at Dan and held out his hand. Dan took it, reluctant to interact with a complete stranger, but glad to have at least met someone nice.<br/>
“I’m- uh- I’m Dan.” Dan replied, with something of a grimace.<br/>
“You’re new aren’t you? Phil said kindly. “I can teach you how to get on the platform. Oh, this is my mum and my brother Martyn.”<br/>
Phil gestured to the ginger-haired lady and the tall boy next to him. They both greeted Dan and smiled.<br/>
“Um, yeah, my family is um- not really here to show me, I guess.” Dan stammered. “I have no clue what I’m doing.”<br/>
Phil smiled, his ocean eyes bright and warm, “You just have to run in between the column between platforms 9 and 10. It’s simple really, we can do it together.”<br/>
Dan nodded, his hands firmly grabbing his trolley so they wouldn’t shake with nerves. Phil’s brother and mum went in before them, saying they’d meet them on the other side.<br/>
Phil grinned and counted to three. They rushed into the column side by side. Dan closed his eyes and braced for the impact, but none came.<br/>
He opened them to a platform filled with people. Some carrying owls and cats and frogs, some with giant trunks.<br/>
The two boys walked over to Phil’s mum. Dan stood there as Phil and his brother said their<br/>
goodbyes. They both hugged the ginger-haired woman and turned toward the train.<br/>
“Follow me, we can sit in a compartment together. “Phil said, gesturing towards the train rumbling on the tracks behind them.<br/>
Dan followed Phil and left his luggage with a tall, burly man who was loading it onto the train. They entered the train, which Phil called the Hogwarts Express and found a compartment. Dan walked in, relieved to be sitting.<br/>
The two boys sat across from each other, Phil asking Dan questions. Dan answered cautiously, careful not to reveal anything important if this Phil guy turned out to be a bully.<br/>
Suddenly, two boys appeared in the entrance of the compartment Dan and Phil had situated themselves in. One tall, with vibrant green eyes covered by glasses and thick brown hair. The other was shorter, with brown hair, like his counterpart and amber eyes.<br/>
“Hi,” said the green-eyed boy, “I’m Pj, but my friends call me Peej.”<br/>
“I’m Chris.” The brown-haired boy said, introducing himself. “I’m the good looking one.”<br/>
The boy named Pj gave Chris a shoved. But they were smiling.<br/>
“He means he thinks he’s the good looking one.” Pj commented, rolling his eyes at Chris.”<br/>
Dan smiled, “I’m Dan.”<br/>
“Oh! And I’m Phil, you’re welcome to sit with us.” Phil said.<br/>
Pj and Chris thanked Dan and Phil and sat next to them in the train compartment.<br/>
The four boys chatted for a few minutes before the train’s whistle blew and they started moving along the tracks and past the hidden station. Families waved goodbye as their children set off into the world of magic. And Dan wished his family had been there too.<br/>
A voice jolted him from his thoughts.<br/>
“So, what’s your story Dan?” Asked Chris.<br/>
“My story?” Dan replied, unsure of what to say.<br/>
“Like are you Pure-blood, Half, anything of the sort?” Chris said to Dan.<br/>
Dan felt all eyes turned on him. Green, brown and blue, all curious to know more about Dan. Dan hesitated, unsure yet of what he made of the three boys witting with him.<br/>
“Um- I’m- uh- I come from a family of normal people I guess and I’m 11 and I know nothing about magic.” Dan stuttered, terrified of what these boys would think of someone who had non-magical parents.<br/>
“Oh cool!” Phil said with a smile. “Well my whole family is magic, so that makes me a Pure-blood I suppose.”<br/>
“I’m a Half-blood.” Pj said. “And so’s Chris. My mum’s a muggle and my dad’s a wizard.”<br/>
“Come on Peej, I wanted to talk about myself.” Chris whined indignantly. “Well anyway, my dad’s a muggle-born and my mum’s a witch, so really I’m 3/4 blood.”<br/>
“Too technical Chris.” Pj snorted.<br/>
The two boys shoved each other jokingly. Dan smiled, these boys seemed nice enough. They weren’t cruel or judgmental like the many boys he had gone to school with in the past, they were, dare he think it, kind.<br/>
“So houses, you have to spill the beans.” Phil said suddenly, knocking Dan out of his thoughts. “Which one do you think you’ll be in?”<br/>
“Oh Gryfinndor for sure.” Chris said. “My mum and dad were both in it and it only makes sense for me to be in it too.”<br/>
Dan didn’t know what houses meant, or what Gryfinndor was. His confusion must’ve shown on his face because Phil started explaining the meaning of the houses.<br/>
“So Gryfinndor are the brave, reckless ones, Slytherin are the cunning, broody ones, Hufflepuff are the super sweet, kind ones, my brother Martyn is actually in Hufflepuff! Oh, and Ravenclaw, they’re the smart, curious ones.” Phil explained to Dan.<br/>
Chris and Pj nodded.<br/>
“So obviously as a naturally brave person and heroic, I’d be in Gryffindor.” Chris said with a grin.<br/>
“Oh shut up.” Pj said. “He’s an idiot is all. Anyway, I think I’ll be in Ravenclaw or Gryffindor, but honestly I don’t care, I really just want to learn magic.”<br/>
“I think I’ll be in Hufflepuff.” Phil said, his eyes bright behind his glasses. “I’d like to think I’m kind, and I could see my brother all the time.”<br/>
Dan looked at the boys around him. He didn’t know what house suited him. What if he didn’t fit in any and they just sent him home? Would he be a failure before he even started at this new school? And what if-<br/>
Phil cut Dan’s thoughts off, “I assume you have no clue what house you’ll be in, so it’ll just be an exciting surprise.”<br/>
Phil smiled kindly as an old lady, who looked about 300, walked to their compartment with a trolley filled with sweets of all kinds.<br/>
“Anything from the trolly, dears?” The lady asked in a sweet voice.<br/>
Chris and Pj got some strange chocolates and Phil shook his head. Dan sat there, wanting candy, but not having any means to buy it. He shook his head and the old lady set off. Calling more people to get sweets.<br/>
“Do you want to try a chocolate frog?” Pj asked, holding out a tiny blue box.<br/>
“Are you sure?” Dan replied, not wanting to impose.<br/>
“Of course!” Pj said to Dan. “We’re friends, friends share things.”<br/>
Dan smiled and took it. Pj also offered one to Phil and he took it.<br/>
There they were, four boys sitting in a train, munching on magical chocolate. Maybe this year wouldn’t be terrible after all. He had just made friends, friends who seemed to actually like him. Dan’s heart beaded faster and faster, excited yet unsure of all that was about to come. He looked over at his companions. Whatever he was going to face, he was going to face it with friends. And for the first time in the longest time, Dan felt at peace.</p><p>The train slowed to a stop. The various kids in each train compartment poured out. Phil was by Dan’s side, Chris and Pj followed close behind them. The tall, burly man Dan had left his luggage with was now directing all of the first years to boats floating on starry water. Dan gasped as he saw the massive castle of Hogwarts, where he would be attending school.<br/>
“That’s Hogwarts?” Dan said, wonder encapsulating his voice.<br/>
“The one and only,” Chris replied, “I heard that they have a giant monster at the bottom of this lake. I wonder if it’ll kill us all.”<br/>
Dan shivered at the thought. Maybe they crossed the lake to eliminate the kids with too little magic. He started panicking, thinking back to the times when people had taunted him. He felt his vision become blurry as his eyes filled with salty tears.<br/>
Dan felt a hand on his shoulder.<br/>
“Dan,” Phil said, his hand remaining steadfast on Dan’s shoulder, “Dan take a deep breath, Chris was only joking. It’s gonna be okay.”<br/>
Dan turned his watery brown eyes to Phil and took a deep breath, “Okay.”<br/>
The group of four walked towards a boat. The burly man from before guided them on and introduced himself as Hagrid, the gamekeeper.<br/>
“My dad was close with Hagrid when he came to Hogwarts, he’s actually studying magical creatures because of him.” Pj whispered to the group. “I wonder if he’ll recognize me from my name.”<br/>
“A Ligouri!” The tall man suddenly said. “I was waiting for the next generation to come. How’s dad?”<br/>
Dan looked at Pj, who looked rather startled. But the brown haired boy composed himself and began talking to Hagrid about his family. Dan tuned out and turned to Phil as the boats slowly moved off into the lake surrounding the grey, stone monolith of Hogwarts.<br/>
“What happens when we get there?” Dan asked.<br/>
“We get sorted and then we eat dinner.” Phil replied.<br/>
“And then they make us go to bed, which sucks.” Chris added, a look of contempt crossing his face.<br/>
Pj had stopped talking with Hagrid, who was on a boat next to their’s and joined in on the conversation They talked for about five minutes before they finally floated into Hogwarts castle. Or rather under, in a dock that began to fill with boats full of students. They stepped out of the boats and stood in front of a pair of large, wooden doors. A lady with eagle-like eyes opened the doors and continued to stand in the doorway.<br/>
“I am Minerva McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.” She began, her eyes harshly gazing upon the students before her. “In a moment you will be escorted to the Great Hall where you will be sorted into your houses, please follow me and do not wander.”<br/>
The group moved forward, following the harsh headmistress to what she called the Great Hall. Two more large, wooden doors greeted them. The doors slowly swung open, revealing students upon students sitting at tables with gold utensils. The ceiling looked like it was made out of the sky, with stars floating above the chandeliers. Dan could barely take it all in before they were moving again. They reached the end of the Great Hall and stood before a ragged looking wizard hat. It was patchy and rotting, with a slight stench rolling off of it. Suddenly, it came to life, startling Dan. He looked at Phil, Chris and Pj. They were all staring at the strange hat. It began singing a song.<br/>
"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,<br/>
But don't judge on what you see,<br/>
I'll eat myself if you can find<br/>
A smarter hat than me.<br/>
You can keep your bowlers black,<br/>
Your top hats sleek and tall,<br/>
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat<br/>
And I can cap them all.<br/>
There's nothing hidden in your head<br/>
The Sorting Hat can't see,<br/>
So try me on and I will tell you<br/>
Where you ought to be.<br/>
You might belong in Gryffindor,<br/>
Where dwell the brave at heart,<br/>
Their daring, nerve and chivalry,<br/>
Set Gryffindors apart;<br/>
You might belong in Hufflepuff<br/>
Where they are just and loyal,<br/>
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,<br/>
And unafraid of toil;<br/>
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,<br/>
If you've a ready mind,<br/>
Where those of wit and learning,<br/>
Will always find their kind;<br/>
Or perhaps in Slytherin,<br/>
You'll make your real friends,<br/>
Those cunning folk use any means,<br/>
To achieve their ends.<br/>
So put me on! Don't be afraid!<br/>
And don't get in a flap!<br/>
You're in safe hands (though I have none)<br/>
For I'm a Thinking Cap!”</p><p>The strange hat finished its song and the students sitting in the hall cheered. Then, names began to be called.<br/>
“Abarca, Collin” Headmistress McGonagall called.<br/>
The boy stepped forward and placed the hat on his head, it shouted Hufflepuff and one of the four tables cheered. It continued like this, with names being called and cheers going around for each person who was put in their house.<br/>
“Kendall, Chris.” Was called out.<br/>
Chris stepped forward and put the hat on, after a moment it shouted Gryfinndor and off he went to sit with his new classmates.<br/>
Then Phil was called, the hat sat on his head for a minute or two, but called out Gryfinndor, like Chris. Next up was Pj, he was also placed in Gryfinndor.<br/>
Finally it was Dan’s turn. He slowly walked up to the hat, aware of the many eyes staring him, wondering if he would be in their house. He put the hat on.<br/>
Suddenly it spoke, “Ah, a muggle-born I see, lots of talent, and you want to prove yourself, you want to be with your friends in Gryfinndor do you? Well, I guess it’ll be GRYFINNDOR!”<br/>
Dan’s heart pounded as cheers went up from the table his new friends were seated at. The brown haired boy sat next to Phil, a grin on his face. Names continued to be called, with Zord, Gale being the last, and in Ravenclaw. The headmistress stood before a podium and clapped her hands to get their attention.<br/>
“Hello, new and old students and welcome to Hogwarts. As you can see, there lies a school year full of mischief and magic ahead of you. But be wary, for darkness always creeps just beyond the eye. Be careful students.” The headmistress said, then with a sweep of her wand, food appeared on each and every plate and table in the hall. “Enjoy the meal young wizards.”<br/>
Dan grabbed a little bit of everything. His mouth watered as he looked at the seemingly endless options of food for him to eat. Back home had always been hard, his family struggled with money and Dan hardly ate large meals. This lead to his shock at all the food being offered at his new school. Dan thought back to his family, they would be so starstruck to see all this food, and for no cost. He sighed. Adrian, his brother,, would have loved this, but as it stood, the 5 year old sibling of Daniel Howell was back in London, not here with Dan.<br/>
“Dan. Dan. Dan!” A voice snapped Dan out of his thoughts, it was Phil’s. “Are you okay? You seem a bit upset, dinner is almost over.”<br/>
A reassuring hand grasped Dan’s shoulder. His face became warm, his stomach did a little somersault. It was because of the food, obviously, he hadn’t eaten that much food in so long.<br/>
“Look, our Prefects are already starting to lead some students out, we can go to our dormitories now if you’d like.” Phil said, with a kind smile and warm eyes.<br/>
Dan nodded, unable to speak all of the sudden. They walked out of the Great Hall and followed the prefects, a boy named John and a girl named Dodie.<br/>
They walked up winding stairs and twisting corridors, until they reached an odd room. The stairs turned and switched, leading to paintings of all sorts. Dan then realized that the painting were talking. His brain tried to reason how this was possible, but he couldn’t figure it out. They walked up staircase after staircase until they reached a painting of a rather rotund lady with a wine glass in her hand. She was singing, until John, the prefect, interrupted her and said “Honey Mildew.” She looked at him with a withering glare for interrupting her and the painting swung open. A grand room filled with chairs and a fireplace stood before the students of Gryffindor house. Dan walked in with awe. Trying to grasp every possible detail. But he was grabbed by the hand by Phil and they walked to their room. Dan fell even more into shock. There were four, 4 poster beds, a window looked over the lake below Hogwarts. The beds each had a trunk below them, belonging to Dan, Phil, Pj, and Chris. Dan laid on the bed with his trunk below it and took it in. He couldn’t believe it.<br/>
“Pretty cool right?” Phil said, breaking the awe-filled silence.<br/>
Dan nodded, “It’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a room, and more.”<br/>
Phil grinned and laid on his bed, like Dan.<br/>
“Do you wanna sleep now? I’m exhausted.” Phil breathed with a sigh of exhaustion.<br/>
“Honestly, yeah. I feel exactly the same.” Dan said, closing his eyes.<br/>
They fell asleep, not noticing Pj and Chris enter. Not noticing the creaking sounds in the walls, not noticing the eerie voice that spoke of slaughter.</p>
