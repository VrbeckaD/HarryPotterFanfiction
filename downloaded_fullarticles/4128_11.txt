    <p>Greg kept his head up and his shoulders back as he walked into the barn after his SIU investigation. He didn’t hold out any hope that Dean had hung around, but, well, at least Auror Onasi and Detective Lane would bring his <em>nipotes</em> straight to the station. He knew the kids would hide their disappointment at his news and do their best to cheer him up.</p>
<p>The thought was enough to warm his face and voice as he bantered a little with his team. Then Ed turned his head, his wry delight drawing Greg’s attention at once. Greg was turning to look even as his team leader murmured a soft, “Hey,” and tilted his head at an out of the way corner. The father’s heart leapt in joy to see his son, uncertain, but still present, waiting for him.</p>
<p>Dean Parker, at sixteen, was already growing up to be much like his father; he shared his father’s brown eyes and slightly stocky build. Unlike Greg, he had a full head of hair, though it was the same dark brown Greg’s would be if he hadn’t lost it. His mother’s influence showed in his narrower facial structure and, though he <em>was</em> a bit stocky, he was also leaner than his father. Brown eyes regarded Greg from under thick eyebrows and bangs that almost fell over his eyes; his full head of hair in a crew cut that was much thicker and fuller than Sam’s military style crew cut.</p>
<p>He looked back at his team, their encouragement showing on their faces and pulsing quietly in the background. As if he needed more encouragement, Ed reached out one arm, saying, “Come on.”</p>
<p>Greg waved him off with a “Yeah, yeah,” turning to face his son, trying to keep from looking too sheepish. After all, <em>he’d</em> been the one to run off earlier…even if it <em>had</em> been a really good reason. He moved over to Dean, babbling a bit, “Uh, hey, sorry, man, I-I… Sorry I had to take off like that before.”</p>
<p>Dean looked just as uncertain as Greg felt; he drew in a breath before asking, “That girl-- she okay?”</p>
<p>Though caught off guard by Dean’s question, Greg rallied; after a glance at Winnie, who nodded, he replied, “Yeah. Yeah, yeah, she’s gonna be okay.”</p>
<p>Dean smiled at his father’s response. “That’s good.”</p>
<p>Greg smiled back, but floundered as he looked for something else to say; Ed saved him. The team leader moved in with a quiet, but cheerful, “Hey, buddy. Remember me? Ed?”</p>
<p>Greg looked up at his taller friend, but still caught Dean’s half-recognizing, half-unsure expression. Ed shook Dean’s hand, ignoring the soft, “Huh?”</p>
<p>The Sergeant smirked and pointed upwards. “He used to have hair.”</p>
<p>Ed played up with a muttered, “Come on,” as Greg mimed where the hair had been and finished with a brief rub on his friend’s bald dome.</p>
<p>Dean was still uncertain, but he remembered a bit. “Uh, yeah, we used to go over to your place.”</p>
<p>Ed grinned and nodded back. “That’s right.”</p>
<p>Dean quirked a grin back. “Clark?”</p>
<p>The team leader’s smile grew broader. “That’s right,” he replied with a look between father and son. “You guys were the same age. Good.”</p>
<p>More confident, Dean remarked, “You had that, uh, golf course behind your place, right?” Greg scented a youthful misdemeanor coming at Dean’s smirk and Ed’s snicker. “Yeah, we used to steal golf balls when people got them on the green.”</p>
<p>Greg bit back his own chuckle as Ed quipped, “So how’s the life of crime going?” Behind Dean, he spotted Onasi and Roy coming in with two kids trailing behind; Onasi looked amused, Roy bemused as the teens behind them chattered on about something…Greg was betting school and the latest spells. Thankfully, the teens didn’t come charging over.</p>
<p>Dean grinned at the quip. “I’ve pulled back a bit,” he bantered back.</p>
<p>Ed, who’d spotted the new arrivals as well, remarked, “That’s good to hear.” He extended his hand, shaking Dean’s as he said, “Good to see you, Dean.”</p>
<p>“You, too,” Dean replied.</p>
<p>“All right,” Ed whispered, clapping his boss on the shoulder and winking at him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’ll see you later,” Greg remarked, shifting to watch Ed depart for a moment. The team leader signaled Roy and Onasi to follow him as he headed off. The kids stayed behind, studying Dean as Greg subtly gestured them forward.</p>
<p>Dean saw his father’s gesture and turned, coming face to face with his cousins as they approached. Greg saw Dean’s face twist in shock and disappointment. Rather than let him assume, Greg spoke as soon as the kids were close enough. “Dean, I’d like you to meet your cousins: Lance and Alanna Calvin.”</p>
<p>Dean’s jaw dropped open as he stared at the pair; Alanna dropped back behind her brother, going shy while Lance offered the slightly older boy a saucy grin. “Hi there,” the teen greeted eagerly, “You’re Uncle Greg’s son, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Greg could see enough of Dean’s face to see him mouth, “ ‘Uncle Greg?’ ” before the teen shook his head and recovered enough to reply, “Yeah. Yeah.” Dean regarded the pair another few seconds before asking, tentatively, “Have I met you before? I don’t remember meeting you…”</p>
<p>Brown and auburn heads shook in the negative at once. Lance, still taking the lead from his shy sister, replied, “No. We moved here from England about three years ago.” A smirk was cast in Greg’s direction. “Boy, was Uncle Greg surprised when we first met him.”</p>
<p>Greg rolled his eyes at that; he’d have to get the cheeky brat for that one. He almost hated to shut down the cheekiness, but Dean would find out anyway. “Lance and Alanna moved here after their parents died,” he quietly informed his son. “I – and you – are some of their last remaining relatives.”</p>
<p>Dean looked back at him, sympathy plain to see. But he was also confused. “I had an uncle in Britain?”</p>
<p>“Um, not really,” Alanna finally spoke up. “Actually, both you and Uncle Greg are our distant cousins…but Uncle Greg’s easier than Cousin Greg.”</p>
<p>Understanding dawned; Dean nodded as she spoke. “Okay, I get it. Well, um, sorry about your parents.” Both teens inclined their heads in thanks as Dean’s nervous expression turned towards his father.</p>
<p>“You, uh, want to come back to our place for dinner?” Greg asked hopefully. “Not sure what all we’ve got at the moment, but we can whip something up.”</p>
<p>Dean looked from his father’s hopeful expression to the twin pleading expressions of his cousins and back. After a long moment, he finally said, “Sure, that sounds good.”</p>
<p>Greg let his smile stretch across his face. “Okay, let me just get my coat.” As he headed for the locker room, he heard Lance start asking Dean about what he liked to do for fun. Alanna was still quiet, but the shy girl was a very good listener…she’d probably catch Dean off guard a time or two before she warmed up to him. He had his son back…now if only he could keep him…</p>
