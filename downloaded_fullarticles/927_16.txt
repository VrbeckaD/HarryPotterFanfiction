          <div class="userstuff"><p>The Dragon in Gringotts Speaks</p><p> </p><p>I was down in the basement<br/>
the dungeons<br/>
guarding the wizards’ most valuables<br/>
while they keep me in chains<br/>
and darkness<br/>
when these kids came along<br/>
I could tell they were kids<br/>
they smelled newer<br/>
age and bitterness leave a trace<br/>
They were the only ones in years<br/>
who seemed concerned<br/>
about my condition<br/>
that’s how I knew<br/>
it was my time<br/>
to break through the ceiling<br/>
fly free</p></div>
