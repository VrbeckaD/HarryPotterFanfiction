    <p>
  <span>Hermione Jean Granger is a fighter for the light and against evil. Hermione is a good person.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s okay. You did those things for the better,” she thought to herself in the quiet of her dormitory. She tossed and turned in bed restlessly, the temperature of the room off and her duvet feeling too heavy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In the background, her dorm mates were sound asleep. But the bushy-haired witch’s brain whirred with thought, the facts clear to her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>No, she has no remorse. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Not quite. What she’d done was necessary. Necessary to keep her friends safe and themselves afloat in this war. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She turned to the right, her ribcage pressed into the mattress. With her one knee bent and the other leg outstretched, this pose was no more comfortable than any other position; it did nothing to stifle her overactive thoughts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had done things others would not consider to be pacifist. But yes, they had kept Ron and Harry unharmed, and by extension, the people of Hogwarts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape, she’d lit on fire, no denying that, but Quirrell’s– Voldemort’s– concentration had been thrown off. Would Snape have succeeded in countering the dark wizard? She couldn’t be sure.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> She had eradicated the threat that was Rita Skeeter. And as for Marietta, she had it coming. She was fully in the right to look out for her friends’ wellbeing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She stood vigilant behind Harry to take on whatever he could not.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Now you’re thinking logically, </span>
  </em>
  <span>she mused.</span>
  <em>
    <span> Rita Skeeter was a pest to the general population, anyway. Marietta made her bed and laid in it.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>But Snape? And what about Quirrell?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>No. She’s right, she knows she’s right. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Content, she allowed sleep to take her,  and with her thoughts settled, the duvet upon her folded her in comfortably.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> A weight has been lifted off her neck. The freedom is euphoria.</span>
</p>

</p>
<p>
  <span>“Honey,” her mother says to her one afternoon while baking cookies. “You’ve grown.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione smiled at the normalcy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She tied her hair and slipped on some gloves. Her mother’s miniature garden needed tending. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Can’t stay a baby forever, mum.” She replied. After all, a magical war required hardness you attained with age. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her mother hummed lightly, but the sound came out strained and her eyes had the slightest unnerved squint to them. She slid the baking pan into their oven.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I mean that you’ve changed,” her mother said. The older woman’s smile was opaque, and set beneath was furtive worry. “You aren’t as,” Mrs. Granger faltered, tasting the word before saying it, “sentimental.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is that a good thing?” Hermione asked. She had never liked to disappoint her mother, and she did think she still harboured some sentiment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you think?” Her mother said, her mouth now a thin line, her body casually leaned against the counter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione paused, passing her a sidelong glance, but kept her hands busy. The floral apron was tied neatly behind her back when she answered. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I think so.”</span>
</p>

  <em>
    <span>--- August 1997 ---</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron had been having his turn with Slytherin’s locket all morning. When Ron had first worn it, he had been volatile, but was reined in after a chat with Hermione. He had been controlled, as much as he could be, anyway, and had begun to sit in the corner of the tent and glare openly at his friends.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Not that Hermione did not understand, of course. Because some garish necklace whispering poison in your ear was by no means a pleasant pastime. It was too bad that Ron did not handle it as well as Harry and she did.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When Ron had stormed up to them in the middle of the day to complain about their progress, the already tense situation took a turn for the worse.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"We found</span>
  <em>
    <span> </span>
  </em>
  <span>a horcrux</span>
  <em>
    <span> </span>
  </em>
  <span>already!" Harry yelled. The remnants of the anger the horcrux had roused in him were slow to leave even when he’d already passed it to Ron.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Yeah, and we're about as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of 'em, aren't we?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As they went at it, Hermione noted Ron’s appearance. He looked awful.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dirt and leaves clung to his attire, and a small twig was sticking out of his mussed hair. Dark bags weighed down the lower lids of his bloodshot eyes and his face was white, wan. She wondered if they all looked this way.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione scrambled up from the table to stand before Ron, concerned with how hot Ron’s temper was running. The past few months, she had felt desperate, perpetually on the brink of tears. It did not help that Ron nowadays evoked a small rage in her that was egged on by the locket. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Ron,"  Hermione pleaded, voice a little more sharp than she liked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had a good idea how she looked; unkempt and frumpy. Her riotous hair was impossible after months of low maintenance and they all smelled like something better left unidentified.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They had forgone much of their hygiene, and even the tent, shabby from months of use as a permanent home, stood testament to their predicament. But now, with their whole situation’s indignity exacerbated by the shouting match, the tent felt much tighter and suffocating.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Ron, take off the horcrux–- take it off–" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was ignored</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Do you know why I listen to that radio every night? To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name," he was frantic and short of breath, "or Fred's or George's, or mum's-</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"And I'm not listening </span>
  <em>
    <span>either, </span>
  </em>
  <span>is that what you're getting at?" Harry said, reaching for the edge of Ron’s shirt. "</span>
  <em>
    <span>You think I don't know how this feels?" </span>
  </em>
  <span>Ron pulled away, face red as his hair. He tore the locket off, but he wasn’t defused.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"No, you don't</span>
  <em>
    <span> </span>
  </em>
  <span>know how it feels! Your parents are dead</span>
  <em>
    <span>! You have no family!</span>
  </em>
  <span>" </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>In that event, something had snapped. Harry’s bright eyes widened for a second, but then his brows furrowed in frustration.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He seemed to appear in front of Ron before Hermione could blink, and threw a punch at the other boy. It landed on the side of Ron’s face and he sputtered before the red-head shoved Harry hard and attempted to punch Harry himself. They stumbled about in an attempt to oust each other. The fight was blurry and Hermione willed her tears to subside. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She crouched down to the ground, head never moving to look as they fought, and she lost awareness, as though she were dipped into a pool of ice-cold water and her nerve endings were frozen solid.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When she surfaced, Ron had stormed out of the tent and she saw his outline disappearing into the distance, his form blurred by the fog. Soon, she joined him, their cries echoing off the trees.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>They called his name until they were hoarse. In unspoken agreement, both of them moved towards the campsite at once when their voices could no longer bear the strain. They descended from the woods, returning to the tent once more, and defeatedly said his name again as though Ron would come back. </span>
</p>

  <span>--- November nine, 1997. ---</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Voldemort overwhelms Britain;</span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lord Voldemort, esteemed dark wizard, has gained full control of Britain and the Ministry of Magic-</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“</span>
  </em>
  <span>Fuck.” Harry swore. “This is bad.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She thought about before, when she would scold the boys for cussing. Innocence, now so far away, she had taken for granted.</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>--- December 1997 ---</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Mione, you’re brilliant, honestly.” Ron slurred as he stumbled down the stairs drunk. It was the first half of fifth year and Hermione had already worked herself into a headache she pointedly ignored on an essay, last person in the common rooms after curfew.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Ron,” Hermione admonished gently, “you’re drunk. How did you manage to get yourself down the stairs?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’m sorry,” Ron said, “okay? But hear me out.” He waved his hands in the air, and then looked at her, waiting for affirmation.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione decided to humor him, and nodded, putting her quill aside.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Right, give it a go.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The redhead took a lock of her hair between his fingers and plopped down beside her on the red sofa. He faced her profile, putting his forearm behind the back of his seat.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hermione, I’m a right arse all the time, and without you, ‘Arry and I would have been dead. You’re smart and amazing. Can you promise me something?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione wavered and her cheeks had coloured. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Promise?” She repeated after the redhead, leaving him to continue the thought. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Promise me that you’ll never give up. You’re amazing. Maybe some of the world doesn’t agree, but it’d be a lot less bright without you.” Ron said, smiling at her drunkenly. She could almost feel the warmth of the alcohol in the air.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>She didn’t mind the firewhiskey in that moment.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It’s the memory she first recalls when she reads the newspaper.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Weasley Blood Traitors Executed for Demonstration.</span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Weasleys of the formerly untainted sacred twenty-eight executed yesterday morning on account of treason by defying our Lord Voldemort in their beliefs. Molly Weasley (née Prewett), Arthur Weasley,  their children William Arthur, Charles, Percy Ignatius, Fred, George, Ronald Bilius, and Ginevra Molly, were prosecuted and executed privately by death eate-</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” Harry said, “no, it can’t… They couldn’t… The wouldn’t have.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But Hermione wasn’t listening. What, she wondered, would Voldemort gain from lying? He was a raving lunatic but, quoting Dumbledore, the most brilliant student to have ever passed Hogwarts. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione didn’t think insanity completely smothered intelligence, but she couldn’t be certain. Lie and people would see you as an unreliable overlord. And what good could come from a family which has openly opposed you for two consecutive wars?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> A lone tear streamed over her cheek and down her eye after being held back for so long, and it was followed by a river. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She wanted…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She wanted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She wanted to exact revenge. Personally. Her mouth twisted and she swiped a tear before it exited her eye. Harry… he would play no part in this plan of hers; she did not want to burden him any more than he already felt.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With this raw anger in her, her vigor was renewed.</span>
