    <p>Lily Evans had never felt so ill-prepared in her life. She cursed the day she allowed James to talk her into this plan. Into Dumbledore's plan.</p><p>Queen and Country was all well and good. Letting your infant child get dragged into it was sacrilege. If her own parents had believed otherwise, then she wouldn't even be here.</p><p>Not that she would be for much longer. Voldemort had already killed James. Her life expectancy numbered in the seconds.</p><p>She'd long since prepared to transfer her own blood protections to her sleeping son. Her death, her sacrifice would seal the bindings.</p><p>For seven years, no magic would touch him. For seven years more, no magic being could touch him meaning harm. Even seven years after, he would remain hidden from any searching him out.</p><p>She stood over the crib. Hadrian was wide awake and wide-eyed. Their matching green eyes met and Lily was grateful he was too young to understand. Mournful that he was too young to remember.</p><p>The monster behind her demanded she "stand aside". Lily turned to meet glowing red eyes and the tip of a bone white wand. Stand aside? What true mother had ever done so?</p><p>The green light of the Killing Curse was far too beautiful a shade to belong to a spell of such malicious intent. Yet, for an "Unforgiveable", it was a surprisingly humane death. Lily would have thought it to be far more destructive to its victims' souls, but nay.</p><p>James had likely already moved onto the afterlife. Waiting for her, most like. Perhaps she would go and see him later. The protections on her little boy had indeed worked --- not that she had doubted them. Quite a bit of her own magical essence had stayed behind to make sure of it.</p><p>The "rebounded curse" was quite potent --- enough to blow up that idiot terrorist.</p><p>She would've smirked, had she her body. Vengeance for her guardians and for her lover from beyond the grave. Sub-existence as a mere shade was a problematic but fitting punishment for those who flee Death's grasp.</p><p>"Lils!" she heard James' voice call from Limbo. Strange that they should so easily find each other. Perhaps it was recompense. After all, their souls would never move on until their murderer's had. And she had just witnessed its inability to do so --- and warded against the means which had lodged itself in her son's forehead.</p><p>"Coming, James!" She spared a glance back down at little Hadrian. What she could do for him had already been done. Except...</p><p>She summoned all her love and tied it to her son. Hopefully, whatever followed, he would always be able to feel what she would never be there to express.</p>
