          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Happy Christmas, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>Harry reaches across the table for the peppermint oil, only to be slapped on the hand by his potions partner.</p>
<p>“Not yet, Potter! You’ll ruin the brew! And quit saying that.”</p>
<p>Malfoy focuses on chopping the rose thorn into fine segments while Harry leans nonchalantly on his hand.</p>
<p>“Why? Aren’t you excited for the holidays?”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, returning to an empty home sounds rather appealing, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Harry purses his lips, contemplating. He suddenly realizes that Malfoy’s staring at him. A jolt of electricity runs a prickly shock down his spine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well? The peppermint oil?”</p>
<p>“Oh. Yeah.” Harry taps the vial precisely three times, and the potion morphs into the color of sage. He’s distracted by the sharp pierce of Malfoy’s stare.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there’s no criticism, only the accidental brush of Malfoy’s hand against his as he begins to stir counter-clockwise. His skin tingles in its wake.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Potter, you didn’t screw it up this time.”</p>
<p>Harry’s still lost in thought, finally snapping back to reality with the buzzing excitement of a new idea.</p>
<p>“Malfoy. Come to the Burrow with me.” He’s beaming, proud of himself like never before.</p>
<p>“Wh-what?”</p>
<p>“The Weasley’s. It’s never empty. Quite the opposite actually.”</p>
<p>Malfoy studies the potion, which has begun to emit spirals of steam.</p>
<p>“Why should I?”</p>
<p>“Because spending Christmas with your arch nemesis has got to be better than spending it alone.”</p>
<p>He smirks. “Please, Potter. I thought we were beyond all of that nonsense now.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I guess our rivalry died with Voldemort?”</p>
<p>Malfoy still winces a bit at the name. His eyes are focused on the cauldron.</p>
<p>“It’ll be fun, Draco. Please.”</p>
<p>His gaze snaps up, and Harry’s smiling softly. The name seemed to roll from his tongue in an effortless and fateful manner.</p>
<p>“You- why did you call me that?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it your name?”</p>
<p>There’s a pause, and suddenly Draco’s laughing.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess it is. Twat.”</p>
<p>Harry giggles; he can’t help himself.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s smile fades. “Do you smell anything?”</p>
<p>“No, why?”</p>
<p>“Fuck. We screwed up the potion, dimwit.”</p>
<p>Harry leans forward, invading Malfoy’s space. It’s a gesture that doesn’t go unnoticed, and Malfoy’s hands shake a bit.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I smell nothing.”</p>
<p>Malfoy sighs.</p>
<p>“Alright, we’re wrapping up! Let me check your work before I dismiss you all for winter break.” Slughorn starts making his rounds, and Malfoy’s shoulders slump disappointedly.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” he pipes, “I never fail at potions.”</p>
<p>“It’s probably my fault.” Harry shrugs. “Too much peppermint, maybe?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so.” Malfoy’s thoughtful as Slughorn approaches their table.</p>
<p>“Very well done, boys! A perfect concoction if I may say so myself! A flawless balance of smoked wood scent and plum pudding!”</p>
<p>Harry scrunches his nose at the thought of plum pudding. Draco watches confusedly as Slughorn teeters away to Seamus and Dean’s boiling brew.</p>
<p>“I- I don’t understand,” he states.</p>
<p>“I know. Plum pudding is disgusting.”</p>
<p>“No, you prat. It worked for Slughorn but we- we didn’t smell anything.”</p>
<p>“Maybe we’re immune to amortentia.”</p>
<p>“Maybe we-“ Malfoy freezes, a sudden dawning transforming his cheeks to a rosy pink.</p>
<p>Harry tilts his head, brow creased with confusion as he overhears the factual proclamations of Hermione: “I used to smell freshly cut grass, Ronald, but now I seem to only sense a very potent version of you.”</p>
<p>Harry draws in a breath and is suddenly very aware of Malfoy’s presence beside him. It’s intoxicating- potent- and he-</p>
<p>Oh. Oh. Fuck.</p>
<p>He snaps to find Malfoy already staring. His face is red; he looks like he might be sick.</p>
<p>“Malfoy, I think we used the right amount of peppermint oil.”</p>
<p>He nods subtly.</p>
<p>Harry gulps, then decides that life is far too short to miss chances. Especially during the season of Christmas.</p>
<p>“Please. Come to the Burrow with me. I want you there.”</p>
<p>He nods again with a ruminating pause. “Okay.”</p>
<p>Harry smiles, and it lights up his entire face. One word that, coming from the boy beside him, means everything.</p>
<p>“I knew you’d come to your senses eventually.”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“Draco?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Happy Christmas.”</p>
<p>He laughs at the sentiment, rolling his eyes facetiously.</p>
<p>“Happy Christmas, Scarhead.”</p>
<p>Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever stop smiling again. It would be a very Happy Christmas, indeed.</p></div>
