    <p>Harry had done it. He was able to kill The Dark Lord Voldemort, but not without a huge cost. Hogwarts was destroyed, and the casualties were too high to count. He knows many people who died. Hermione. The Weasleys. Neville. Even the Malfoys. Everyone he knew. Everyone he cared for. Tired green eyes scan the rubble of the once-proud standing Hogwarts.</p><p>Rocks crunch beneath his shoes as he slowly walks deeper into what was once Hogwarts property. Long hours pass by as he loses himself to his thoughts.</p><p>After a while, he decides to visit the now-empty town of Hogsmeade. His eyes catch on the shrieking shack, which is barely standing on its own. He quietly walks up to it, peering into the darkened house. He casts Lumos, lighting up the ruined building as he looks around. He flinches when he sees the bloodied body of Severus Snape. The war only ended 2 days ago, so the cleanup effort has only just started. Most bodies were still in the same place they were killed.</p><p>He quietly walks up to the corpse, kneeling in front of it. His hand slides into his pocket, grasping tightly at the small bottle of memories Snape gave him before he died… He truly had cared about him… He looks up to the pale face of Snape. He looks so much older, his eyes sunken and his pale skin made to look paler because of the cold hand of death. He reaches up and lightly touches his chest, tears welling in his eyes.</p><p>After a few quiet moments of contemplating, he slips his hand into Snape’s robes, pulling out his wand. He holds it gently, wrapping his fingers around the base, where Severus would have gripped it. A warm sensation runs up his arm, dark green and scarlet strands of magic curling around his arm. He watches it with wide eyes as it sinks into his skin, leaving him feeling warm. He tightens his grip on the wand as tears threaten to run down his cheeks. That was Snape’s magic… It trusted him with the wand. He feels cold shame run over him as he remembers how he treated Snape… The more he thinks, the more he realizes how obvious it was that he did care for him. He curses silently, grabbing Snape’s cold hand with his free one. He's so cold…</p><p>He steels his resolve and stands up, gathering Snape’s body into his arms. He uses a feather-light charm on the body to make it easier, even though it seems like Snape had lost a lot of weight beforehand. He’d grown a few more inches in the last few years, so he didn't have to drag Snape's feet on the ground. He quietly walks out of the crumbling building, apparating to a quiet area in the forest. It's next to a small lake, with wildflowers growing all around.</p><p>He kneels and sets down Snape's body onto a patch of grass surrounded by wild lilies. He pulls out a small handkerchief, dipping it into the lake, before dabbing at and wiping away the blood from his face and neck. He knows he could use magic to do this, but he feels like that's too impersonal. He deserves this, and much more. But this is the only thing he can give him.</p><p>He stares at his body for a moment longer, before he looks away. He should bury him… He takes out his wand, waving it slightly. A large section of dirt moves, creating a shallow hole. He sets down his wand and carefully picks up the body, setting it into the shallow grave gently. He considers burying Snape with his wand, but decides against it, instead deciding to keep it close to him, as a reminder of sorts. He stands up, staring for a long moment.</p><p>He's always liked Professor Snape… Even when he was cold to him. There was just an air about him that he liked. When he found out he was protecting him for most of his life, he… Well, truthfully developed a crush. Now he's never going to be able to tell him, not that he would have any way…</p><p>After a few minutes of sliding the dirt back over Snape's body, he jolts as he remembers something very important. The time-turner! Of course, how could he forget? He gently covers up the rest of the hole with dirt. He gathers a few flowers, then puts together a makeshift tombstone, setting the stone and flowers at the top of his grave. He needs to find the time turner…</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>He's spent countless hours, days, even months trying to figure out the Time-Turner. It's been long… so long… nearly 17 years now. The wizarding world has nearly fallen apart. Everyone else has given up. Lost hope. He scratches at the stubble on his chin as he inspects the small box in front of him for what seems like the millionth time.</p><p>He was able to find the time turner quickly, not even a year after he starting to look for it and It only took that long because it was charmed with notice-me-not. The only problem was that it's sealed in a small box heavily protected with charms. No one has been able to open it, no matter what spells they used. He has no idea what type spells were used to keep it closed, but he sure as hell is going to find out how to break it. He rarely talks with anyone. The surviving Weasleys try in touch, but with nearly half of their children dead, they don't have much spirit anymore.</p><p>He's poured countless hours into trying to open it, none of which seem to work. A warm tingling in his hidden breast pocket of his robe pulls him out of his thoughts. Ah, Snape’s wand. He's always kept it with him, as a reminder of why he's trying to do this, and it's not the first time it's started to buzz with energy. He reaches into his robes and pulls out the wand, rolling over in his hand as he quietly contemplates new ways to open the damn box.</p><p>Suddenly, a soft spark of magic winds between his wand and Snape’s. He's never thought of using them as one to break open the box! He's not sure how well Snape’s wand will work with his magic, but he's willing to try. He picks up his own wand carefully with his right hand, Snape's in his left. He presses the tips of the wands to the box and concentrates his magic to flow through the wands. A bright spark of energy crackles through the air, and he's left gasping. So much of his magic was pulled from him.</p><p>He goes limp in his seat as he gasps softly, before looking at the box. It's blackened and smoking, and he can see that it cracked open ever-so-slightly. He surges forward, prying open the burnt box, letting out a sob of relief as he sees the golden, glittering time turner. He cradles it in his hands, standing up and rushing to his room with it.</p><p>He has no idea if he's going to keep his things or not, going this far back, so he doesn't risk it. He checks throughout his empty, unused room for a moment longer before he walks back out, grabbing both wands. It's probably a bad idea to bring Snape’s, but he can't bear to part with it.</p><p>After a quick shower and an apple to eat, he decides to wait a day before he leaves. With the magic drain from just opening the box, he should gather his energy. He sets the wands and time turner down into his school chest that he's kept, locking it before he gets ready for bed. He hasn't slept properly for a long time, so he's going to need the rest.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The next morning he awakes from a dark nightmare. He sits up quickly, gasping for breath, his nightclothes sticking to his body from sweat. He shakes himself, quickly taking in a few breaths to calm himself down. After a few minutes, he's able to pull himself out of bed.</p><p>It doesn't take him long to get ready, and soon he's standing in the middle of his living room with the time turner in his hands, and the wands tucked into his shirt. He takes in a deep breath, before focusing his energy into his hands, and onto the time turner. He feels… Strange. He can't feel his body anymore, nor can he see anything but blinding white light. He tries to tough out the travel, but his consciousness soon gives out, causing the world to go black around him.</p>
