I’m still trying  to find a decent apartment . I’m currently staying at a friends house till I find something I like”. They order food, Stiles orders a well done steak with potatoes and vegetables, Derek has the same but a medium steak..</p><p>“What about you Derek tell me something about you”</p><p>“Second of three kids, only boy in the family, I run my own business”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you do for fun when you’re not working?”</p><p>“I don’t get a lot of free time”</p><p>“I can’t believe that you must have something you enjoy doing”</p><p>Derek loved running in his wolf form but he couldn’t tell her he was a werewolf. I like to exercise and I enjoy spending time with my family. What about you any siblings?”</p><p>Stiles shakes her head “Just me and my mum I’m afraid my dad passed away last year”. Derek could spell the sadness coming from her “I’m sorry to hear that”.</p><p>“Thank you it gets easier every day it’s harder for my mum she used to say dad was her soul mate”.</p><p>The food comes and they tuck in, it was delicious Derek finished and orders second Stiles ask if she could do the same and she orders fish and chips. Derek wondered how someone so little put away so much food. “I exercise and have a fast metabolism”, says Stiles.</p><p>“I didn’t realise I said that out loud sorry about that”</p><p>“I get that a lot I’m five foot ten and a hundred and thirty five pounds after all” as they leave the restaurant Stiles takes Dereks hand although surprised at the action he does keep a hold her hand.</p><p>“My apartment is near here if you want to come back for a nightcap”</p><p>Stiles doesn’t know why she said what she said next “I would love to”.</p><p>Derek drives to his apartment as they got out the lift Stiles mouth drop open “You live in the penthouse wow just how rich are you.”. </p><p>Derek smiles he owned the building but he assumed she knew that, many of the previous women he’s had one night stands with leave the elevator and acted the same way then hint at wanting shopping sprees and gifts after. So what if Stiles was Dress demurely and seemed some what different to the rest, a gold digger was a gold digger.</p><p>He ushers them inside the apartment and goes to pour them a drink “I’ll have a soft drink if you don’t mind”, says Stiles</p><p>“I’m got apple, orange and mango”</p><p>“Mango please”, says Stiles, Derek pours her a glass of mango juice they sit and Derek puts on music before long he  turns and kisses her she blushes and Derek would have thought it sweet<br/>
If not for her being a gold digger he deepens the kiss and before long they were at his bedroom door. </p><p>She seemed a little unsure but he’s seen this act many times before “We can stop we don’t have to go any further”. </p><p>“No Derek I want to”, she assures him. He undresses her and lays her on the bed and begin kissing her neck as he kisses down her body she moans. The next morning Stiles wakes up and get dress quickly before leaving the penthouse she went back to hers and Lydia’s house, showered and got dress for work she stops suddenly “Oh my god I gave my Virginity to a stranger”.</p><p>Derek wakes up and pulls back the sheets he was surprise to see blood “She was a virgin”. He says out loud, he walks into his living room expecting to see her when he didn’t he searched for a note but found none.  She gave him something so precious and just disappears he was so busy seeing a  gold digger that he missed the genuine person she was, he curses. </p><p>“I have to find her but all I know his she’s been in New York for only two weeks she’s hardly had time to put down roots”.  He goes into work thinking about a slim, tall brown hair women with brown doe like eyes. </p><p>Stiles get into work and sits at her desk her boss came out his office and he seemed tense “Everything alright Jerry?”</p><p>“Yes it’s just work to catchup on, I need you to type this letter and bring it down to reception there’s a carrier waiting for it”.</p><p>“Will do boss”, Stiles takes the dictaphone from him and begin typing up the letter when she’s finished she asked her boss if he wanted her to bring him a coffee back he replied “Yes”. She takes the letter downstairs and sees the guy on his bike waiting for her.</p><p>She goes to Starbucks and gets a latte macchiato for her boss and get a hot chocolate and blueberry muffin for herself she walks into the lobby of the building where she works and caught a glimpse of someone that looked like Derek but she knew it was her imagination.</p><p>On Thursday she walks into the office where she would be working for the next seven days and sit down next to Susan the P.A. for the person she will be working for, to learn how her new boss like things doing. She was so engrossed with some figures on the computer she didn’t look up when someone came into the office. </p><p>“Susan can you call John and let him know I need to move our meeting tomorrow to ten instead of two”.</p><p>“Yes sir” replies Susan  “I would like to introduce you to my replacement for the next week , this is Oliwia Stilinski but everyone calls her Stiles“.</p><p>Stiles look up to see Derek looking, no staring at her open mouthed he seemed to realise what he was doing and close his mouth.</p><p>“Please to meet you Mr Hale”</p><p>“Susan can you go downstairs and get the conference room ready for me please I want to have a meeting with Stiles so she knows what I expect of her I need about two hours with her no interruptions is that understood”.</p><p>“Yes sir”, replies Susan leaving them </p><p>“This is awkward not only have I slept with you but now I’m working for you for a week”<br/>
“You left without saying anything no contact details nothing”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s one night stands for you”</p><p>He runs a finger up her arm “I think you got scared and ran”</p><p>Stiles laughs “I had an itch to scratch and you scratched it don’t think you were anything special”</p><p>Derek flinches at her statement “You gave me your virginity, you don’t give something that special away likely”</p><p>“I wasn’t a virgin, I could have started my period”</p><p>“But you haven’t and I saw the evidence of what I took on the bedsheets”, he doesn’t add as a werewolves he doesn’t smell blood on her now.</p><p>Stiles starts to blush “I love that I make you do that”, he leans in and kisses her she moans and kisses him back passionately. He steps away from her and looks at her bruise lips and flushed face pleased that he caused that. “No other man will get to see you like this only me”. He goes to the elevator and push a button “now we won’t be disturb”. Stiles look around the office to see it was basically a penthouse with his office and the one she was in, there was a kitchen and doors leading she doesn’t know where to.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>.</p>
