    <p>"Enough is enough," Harry thought aloud to himself one day at the Dursley's home. "If Ron and Hermione can't treat me with respect well why should I put my time and effort to get them back? I don't control them." Harry kept thinking this over, and he went on a walk to sort his thoughts out. He found himself at the playground where Dudley and his gang usually beat up kids in Primary School. It wasn't long before the gang split and Dudley turned on him, too.</p><p>"What the heck do you want, Dudley."</p><p>"What, haven't got the gut to take me on without your wooden stick, have you?"</p><p>"Actually, I have it on me; and who are you to judge that?" Harry pulled out the holly wand out of his pocket and twirled it around. Harry started to walk back to Number 4, Privet Drive.</p><p>"Not that brave at night, are you?"</p><p>"It <strike><u></u></strike><em>is </em>night, Dudley."</p><p>"I mean when you're sleeping." </p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p>"You were talking in your sleep."</p><p>Harry paused. "What do you mean."</p><p>"Don't kill Cedric, Don't kill Cedric! Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?"</p><p>"Keep your mind straight, asshole. And, I have NO idea what you're talking about." Harry knew what Dudley said was true, so he was praying that Dudley just would lay off; but obviously that would never happen.</p><p>Of course until Dudley gave a cold gasp, as if someone dumped ice-cold water on him to wake him up. Harry stood still, he got the wave of cold, too. </p><p>"Oh, f*ck! Dudley, kill me another day, but you need to listen to me!" Dudley just stared at Harry to go on. "We need to get somewhere safe, and you need to trust me." Dudley nodded. "Go back home." Dudley ran like a serial killer was after him and into an alleyway. Harry realized he was just running right into it.</p><p>"DUDLEY! YOU'RE GOING RIGHT TO IT!" Harry ran after him to find him cornered by a Dementor getting life torn out of him.</p><p>"<em>Expecto Patronum!</em>" A Stag appeared and charged at the Dementor, driving it away, then going around a corner behind Harry, and chasing away a hidden Dementor. </p><p>"Dudley? Dudley!" Harry ran over to Dudley and rummaged around in his pocket and came out holding a piece of a chocolate bar and put it into Dudley's hand; who automatically shoved it into his mouth. Dudley's face relaxed and looked at Harry.</p><p>"What the hell was that!"</p><p>"Uhh..."</p><p>"Thanks for saving my life."</p><p>Harry just looked as if someone threw a brick to his head.  "You're welcome..." Harry and Dudley got up and left for the house.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The Dursleys were out at some sort of prize thing, or that's what Harry got out of the 'conversation' they had. Harry was locked in his room, and had nothing to do. Oh, let's not forget; he was expelled from Hogwarts. Having nothing to do, Harry went to sleep.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Harry woke to a thing falling from the kitchen. He grabbed his wand and put on his glasses.</p><p>The lock was turning... and it opened.</p><p>"...Professor Moody?" Harry spluttered.</p><p>"I didn't do much teaching, so what's the point of 'Professor'."</p><p>"What are you doing here?"</p><p>"Rescuing you, of course."</p>
