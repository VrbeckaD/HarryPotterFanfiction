    <p>The hall was deadly quiet after Dumbledore readout Harry’s name. It was as if the air forgot it was supposed to move. Harry was frozen and completely rigid in his seat. Despite her shock, Hermione gently touched his arm.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” she whispered, if she spoke at a normal volume it would undoubtedly sound as if she were screaming, “Go.”</p><p> </p><p>Her prompting stirred something in Harry, and he slowly stood and began to walk towards the headmaster. Shouts of confusion and outrage broke the silence as he made his way up the marble steps at the front of the hall. After a few more seconds, he slipped out of a side door to join the other victors, and Hermione let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could make sense of what had just happened, screams broke out in the hall again. A sense of dread filled Hermione’s gut, and she spun to face the Goblet of Fire once more.</p><p> </p><p><em>What now?</em> Hermione thought, <em>What else could go wrong?</em></p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>For the fifth time that night, a piece of parchment spewed from the Goblet. Dumbledore, acting instinctively, swiftly caught the slip as it drifted towards the floor. The unnatural stillness that followed the announcement of Harry’s name returned to the hall one-hundred-fold.</p><p> </p><p>The Hogwarts headmaster unfolded the parchment and remained entirely impassive as he spoke the final name in a clear voice, “Draco Malfoy.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“But there’s no way you’ll have to participate, right? I mean, it’s completely ridiculous, you didn’t even put your name in!” Hermione was deep into a rant in the Gryffindor common room.</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione,” Harry began for what seemed like the millionth time that night, “Ludo Bagman and Barty Crouch all said that I have to participate. It’s a binding magical contract. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t put my name in.” He was seated in a large red chair, looking extremely worn, while Hermione paced in front of the common room fire.</p><p> </p><p>After Harry slipped away from the Gryffindor celebrations earlier that evening, the party died out quickly. Once everyone had gone to bed, Crookshanks snuck into the boys’ dormitory and bothered Harry until he followed the cat to the common room to speak with a very distressed Hermione. Harry himself seemed miserable, but Hermione couldn’t tell how much of that was from the tournament and how much from his fight with Ron. Ron was, of course, acting completely ridiculous, but Hermione was much too preoccupied worrying about Harry to have time to set him straight yet.</p><p> </p><p>“But that’s just not fair! They’re so much older and more experienced! Those tasks are going to be so dangerous! And do they really expect two fourth-years to keep up with seventh-years?”</p><p> </p><p>This comment finally prompted a reaction from Harry, who had sunken into the plush leather chair and not stirred since Hermione dragged him out of bed. At her remark, he leaned forward and clutched the arms of the chair so tightly that his knuckles turned white, “Yeah, that’s the other thing,” he spoke in a hoarse voice, “Malfoy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Malfoy?” Hermione asked, entirely confused. She was much more concerned with sizing up the seventh years than concerning herself with Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry spat, “Thanks to that prat finding some way to put his name in the Goblet, everyone is going to think I did it on purpose too. I wonder how he did it?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione paused her pacing and stared deeply into the fire, “That’s assuming he did put his name in the Goblet.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked at her incredulously, “Hermione, be serious, of course he did. I bet he’s bragging about it in the Slytherin common room right now. Bet his father sent him an owl detailing the dark magic he could use to trick the Goblet.” Harry was silent for a moment, then added, “You don’t think someone actually put both my and Malfoy’s name in, do you?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione surveyed her friend’s face and opened her mouth to respond, but then tightly shut it once more. The truth was, she <em>did</em> believe someone put Harry and Malfoy’s name into the Goblet without their knowledge or consent. Although entering an extremely dangerous tournament for glory is exactly the thing Malfoy would do, Hermione didn’t believe he did it. She didn’t have much evidence for her theory except for the fact she saw Malfoy’s reaction to his name being called after Harry left the great hall.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione found Malfoy instantly in the crowd of shocked Slytherins thanks to his distinctive platinum blonde hair. He looked as stunned as Harry was only a few moments before. His gray eyes were wide, his lips parted slightly as if he had just taken a sudden breath, and his hands were slightly shaking as he held them folded on the table in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>Despite Hermione’s many run-ins with Malfoy, this was only the second time she had seen him with that expression on his pale face. The first time occurred a year ago, seconds before she slapped him for his disgusting comments about Hagrid and Buckbeak. There was only one way to describe it— Malfoy was scared. That was not the look of a person who had succeeded in bamboozling a powerful magical artifact, that was a look of a teenager about to be thrown into a deadly competition he didn’t sign up for.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy recovered quicker than Harry did, however. Within a second, he wiped all emotion off of his face, pushed himself to his feet, and strode towards the headmaster while ignoring the torrent of protests following him. Hermione might have imagined it, but she thought she could still his hands shaking as he exited the hall to join the four other champions. Despite what Harry thought, Hermione was convinced that Malfoy—for once in his life—was as innocent as Harry in this case.  </p><p> </p><p>Instead of telling her friend this, who already had a short temper thanks to his spat with Ron, she changed the subject and resumed her pacing, “Regardless, we should focus on the opponents that matter, Harry. That’s Cedrick, Fleur, and Krum. We should start making a strategy for how to handle the first task.”</p><p> </p><p>“But Hermione,” Harry groaned, “We don’t even know what the first task is.”</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly,” she replied, “So we should prepare for everything, just to be safe.”</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps it was this comment, or perhaps it was because it was nearing three in the morning, but Harry was exhausted and done with Hermione Jean Granger for the evening.</p><p> </p><p>He took a deep breath and said, “Okay, let’s prepare for everything… in the morning. Goodnight.” With that, he stood and made his way back to the boys’ dormitories.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione soon made her way up to her own room but didn’t find sleep easily. She tossed and turned throughout the night, and her dreams were filled with horrible monsters and faceless men chasing Harry as she watched trapped in a cage nearby. By the time it was breakfast, she had deep purple bags under her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“You look awful, Hermione.” Ginny stated from across the table, “Honestly if I didn’t know any better, I would have thought your name came out of the goblet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ha, ha, very funny,” Hermione replied while gulping down a scalding cup of coffee. Ginny must’ve read her grumpy attitude because she backed off quickly and let her work her way through buttered toast and sunny-side-up eggs.</p><p> </p><p>The hall was filled with a constant buzz of excitement regarding the events of the previous night. When Cedrick arrived for breakfast, the hall erupted into shouts, whispers, and boos. The Hufflepuffs cheered, the Slytherins hissed, the Gryffindors ignored him, and a smattering of Ravenclaws applauded. It was the first time Hermione considered the implications of having three wizards from Hogwarts participate.</p><p> </p><p><em>There’s never going to be unity</em>, she thought dully. With members from Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin, each house would be rooting for their own champion. Only Ravenclaw wouldn’t have a horse in this race<em>. </em>That didn’t bode well for the Hogwarts social scene; everyone would be set against each other for the entire term.  </p><p> </p><p>A great amount of booing indicated the arrival of another champion, and Hermione turned to see Draco Malfoy strutting through the entrance hall. He was surrounded by a Slytherin royal-guard consisting of Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, and Daphne Greengrass. The panic Hermione thought she saw on Malfoy’s face the previous night was entirely replaced with a smug condescending smirk. Today he truly looked the part of a cheating, manipulative, cunning snake.</p><p> </p><p>After the initial onslaught of jeering, most of the hall turned away from the Slytherin and resumed eating. Hermione, however, kept her gaze on the Malfoy heir as he glided through the hall. She was convinced he was just as innocent as Harry, but his current attitude didn’t support her idea.</p><p> </p><p>However, the longer she looked at the blonde-boy, the more evidence she found to encourage her thoughts. As usual, his eyes were narrowed as he regarded everything with disdain, but he clearly had bags under them from a lack of sleep. His hair, often slicked back perfectly, was slightly tousled, as if he had run his hands through it in agitation. Lastly, he took his morning tea with three sugar packets and a spoon of honey. That was excessive even with his sweet-tooth, as he normally only took it with honey. No, Hermione was convinced Malfoy was much more perturbed than he let on.</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione,” Ginny decided her friend had enough silence for one morning, “What are you looking at so intensely?”</p><p> </p><p>She quickly glanced away, terrified of what Ginny would think of her staring, but was saved by the great hall doors bursting open and slamming loudly against the rough stone walls. The banging echoes completely silenced the chamber, and everyone turned to watch a furious Lucius Malfoy storm between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.</p><p> </p><p>“Dumbledore!” He yelled while only half-way to the headmaster’s seat. There was absolute venom in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>Only a few steps behind him, Narcissa Malfoy entered the hall, but didn’t follow her husband to the professor’s table. Instead, she veered to the right, bee-lining for her son. Hermione couldn’t hear the words spoken between the pair, but Narcissa immediately began stroking her son’s blonde hair despite his clear protests.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius finally made it to the front of the hall where Dumbledore calmly stood to greet him. Even though Lord Malfoy spoke in his usual quiet manner, the silence of the hall ensured everyone caught his every word.</p><p> </p><p>“I need to speak with you, as well as Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch immediately.”</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore, as always, looked entirely unperturbed by the rude interruption, “Very well. I will call for them. In the meantime, please follow me to a more private venue.”</p><p> </p><p>At his words, Lucius shot a meaningful look across the room to his wife, who immediately leaned down and whispered something in her son’s ear. They both stood and strode out of the hall with Lucius and the headmaster.</p><p> </p><p>“Looks like Malfoy’s father didn’t have to wait long to hear about this,” Harry spoke from directly behind Hermione, promoting her to jump.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry!” Hermione gasped.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” he replied, “And to think I was all worried about entering the great gall and drawing lots of attention to myself this morning. I saw the Malfoys on my way down and knew that if I followed after them, I’d be okay.” He sat down next to Hermione and picked up a few pieces of bacon.</p><p> </p><p>“Only the Malfoys can cause such a scene that even Harry Potter gets ignored,” Neville spoke up for the first time that morning, finally drawing his eyes away from <em>Herbology of the Middle East</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Best thing a Malfoy’s ever done,” Harry said between bites.</p><p> </p><p>After a few more moments of eating, Hermione glanced around the table furtively.  Neville had returned to his book, and Ginny was talking with Dean Thomas.  Ron, she realized, wasn’t in the great hall yet, which probably meant this was the best time to discuss the tournament.</p><p> </p><p>“So…how are you feeling?” Hermione began awkwardly. Judging by the bags under his eyes, Harry got even less sleep than Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, considering I woke up and found out I’m still stuck in a deadly tournament I want nothing to do with, I feel great.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione bit back a retort and reminded herself that Harry was under an extreme amount of stress right now. She decided to change the subject, “What do you think they’re talking about?” Hermione asked, her eyes flicking back to the doors the Malfoys exited from a few minutes prior.</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t it obvious? Mummy is upset that Draco put his name in the Goblet, so they’re here to withdraw him from the tournament,” Harry stated.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione subtly rolled her eyes at his sarcasm, “Just last night you were saying that his father helped him enter his name, Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>“He still could’ve,” Harry quickly defended himself, “Maybe he didn’t tell his wife before, but now she’s furious that his name was actually chosen. So now he’s switching sides to help pull Draco out of the tournament.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione mulled his words over for a moment, but then let out a quick gasp, “But, Harry, if they allow Draco to withdraw, they must allow you to as well!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry paused for a moment, but then resumed eating, “I dunno. Lucius is definitely only campaigning for Draco. He’d probably throw a party if I got myself killed during the tasks.”  </p><p> </p><p>“But they’ll have to make an exception for you as well! It would only be fair.”</p><p> </p><p>“There you go again, assuming everything is always fair.” Harry said bleakly.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione stood, “You know what Harry, I’m going to go to the library. I bet I can find some research on binding magical contracts. Maybe I’ll be able to find some way out of this mess!” With a fierce determination, she stood and strode out of the hall without so much as a goodbye to her friends.</p><p> </p><p>But as she left the hall, Ludo Bagman’s boyish shouts reached her ears, “This truly is extraordinary, Lucius. I understand your concerns about your son’s safety, of course, but what is done is done. Just think how splendid it will be to have five wizards competing this year!” His voice reached a shrill screech when he said the word “five.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione bit her lip and changed course to get closer to the voices. If Malfoy convinced Crouch, Bagman, and the headmaster to exempt his son,  she didn’t need to go to the library to research for Harry. She would simply have to appeal to Dumbledore.</p><p> </p><p>“My son will not participate in a competition he did not submit his name for, no matter how entertaining you find these turns of events to be, Bagman.” Lucius’ cool voice responded.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s assuming your son didn't put his name in, Mr. Malfoy,” the headmaster’s almost amused voice broke in.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione bit her lip, her parents taught her better than to eavesdrop, but she wanted to hear the rest of the conversation.</p><p> </p><p><em>This is all for Harry</em>, she thought to herself as justification,<em> I'm just here for Harry</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco,” Narcissa spoke gently, Hermione had to push her ear completely up against the wooden door to hear, “Please tell these gentlemen what you told us in your letter.”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy’s voice was even quieter than his mothers, and Hermione strained to catch his every word, “I didn’t put my name into the goblet. I don’t know who did. I have no idea how it happened.” There was a pause, and his voice quavered as he finally added, “I…I don’t want to participate.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione could picture Malfoy’s face as he spoke those words. Harry made a similar remark after she dragged him out of bed last night. She cringed at the memory of Harry’s normally bright green eyes looking dull, sunken, and defeated. Her heart clenched painfully; she felt no deep feelings towards Malfoy, but she couldn’t help but pity his situation. Both he and Harry were forced into an incredibly dangerous situation without any wrong-doing of their own. She felt sympathy for Malfoy regardless of his awful attitude.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Lucius began again, “I once again demand that my son be freed of his obligation to participate. I will find a way to convince all of you, I’m sure.” His voice was sharp by the end of his demand.</p><p> </p><p>“It cannot be done,” Mr. Crouch’s voice responded sternly, “Even if I could break the contract, I would not do so after being threatened by an ex-Death Eater, Malfoy.”</p><p> </p><p>A cold silence filled the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me, Mr. Crouch, but I think you’ll remember that myself and my husband were cleared of all charges as we were under the imperious curse during the Dark Lord’s reign. This is all a matter of public record, so I’m sure you’d be able to find the legal documents if you so desire.” Narcissa spoke in a strained tone.</p><p> </p><p>“Alas, my friends,” Hermione stifled a laugh as she was sure no one in that room considered themselves to be friends with Dumbledore, “it seems we’ve reached an impasse. Although I believe Mr. Malfoy did not put his name in that Goblet, it seems he must participate anyways. Now, let us retire this conversation and return to the great hall. Mr. Crouch, have you tried to French toast? It truly is spectacular.”</p><p> </p><p>Footsteps approaching the door sent Hermione ducking for cover behind a suit of armor in a nearby alcove.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore, Crouch, Bagman, and the Malfoys exited the classroom quickly. The first four members of the group marched towards the great hall, but Lucius and Narcissa lingered by the classroom.</p><p> </p><p>The younger Malfoy paused and looked back to his parents in confusion. Narcissa waved him forward, “Go ahead, Draco. Your father and I will catch up.” The boy nodded and spun back around to follow the older men back to the hall.</p><p> </p><p>To Hermione’s horror, Narcissa grabbed Lucius’ arm and dragged him into her alcove, directly on the other side of the suit of amour she was crouched behind.</p><p> </p><p>“This is bad, Lucius,” the tall woman spoke rapidly, “You know as well as I do what is going to happen soon. Your mark grows darker every day, and it’s clear that the right time is approaching.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” the man replied, “But Narcissa, we’ve already discussed this. We’ve decided what needs to be done. I’ll return, and you’ll stay with Draco. I’ll explain everything,” Lucius’ voice was tired and distinctly unhappy.</p><p> </p><p>“I know we’ve discussed it. But…now this happened. Draco’s name came out of that Goblet and considering the…timing, it makes me nervous.” Her voice began to quiver, “Who would put Draco’s name into that Goblet? I mean, what if he had something to do with this? Maybe you shouldn’t return. Maybe we should flee instead.” Narcissa’s voice cracked, and she grabbed the front of her husband’s robes.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius let out a very deep sigh and pulled his wife closer to him as he wrapped his arms around her, “We can’t flee, trust me, it’ll only make things worse for us in the long-run. I’m sorry I couldn’t convince them to free Draco, but it’ll be alright. He’s a smart boy, he’ll make it through. Besides, Dumbledore may not be our biggest fan, but he won’t let anything happen to Draco. He’ll be okay. We have bigger concerns than the Triwizard cup at the moment.”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa kept her head tucked into her husband’s front, and muffled sobs soon shook her body.</p><p> </p><p>“Cissa,” Lucius whispered against her hair, “It’ll be okay. I’ll take care of you. I’ll take care of Draco. We’ll be alright.” Lucius began to draw slow circles on the top of Narcissa’s back with his thumb.</p><p> </p><p>“Shh, it’s okay,” he cooed once more and began placing soft kisses on her head.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione looked away. Perhaps it was because her only interaction with Lucius involved him spewing hate and starting a fight with Mr. Weasley, or perhaps it was because all of her interactions with his son were hostile in nature, but Hermione found the scene in front of her absolutely shocking.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t imagine Malfoy men whispering words of comfort, offering reassurances, or kissing in public, and now that it was happening right in front of her, she didn’t exactly know what to do with herself. All of her interactions with Malfoy men were of bullying, insults, and hatred. She forgot that even Malfoys were humans fully capable of love and compassion.</p><p> </p><p>The couple remained in the alcove for a few more minutes as Narcissa slowly stopped crying under Lucius’ constant consoling. Once finished, they pulled apart from each other and Lucius wiped away his wife’s tears. </p><p> </p><p>“Come now, we must be strong for Draco.” Lucius said as he straightened his robes.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, of course,” Narcissa replied while magicking her red eyes away and fixing her make-up.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius then took her arm and led her, thankfully, away from Hermione’s hiding spot. She waited until she couldn’t hear their footsteps in the corridor and then cautiously emerged from behind the suit of armor. The hall was deserted, so she began to stride confidently back to breakfast. She wanted to shar what she heard with Harry. Clearly something was upsetting the Malfoy patriarch beyond his son being chosen as an unexpected fifth champion, and Hermione wanted to know what it was.</p><p> </p><p>However, judging by the sounds of chairs scraping against stone, breakfast was ending, and everyone would be heading off to morning classes soon. She wondered if she’d have time to discuss it with him in potions and was so lost in thought she rounded a corner and ran directly into a hard body.</p><p> </p><p>She took a few steps back and began to apologize, but her words caught in her throat as she made eye contact with the exhausted, yet clearly revolted, Draco Malfoy. </p><p> </p><p>His grey eyes briefly looked over her shoulder to the corridor and judging from the harsh glare he gave her, he suspected she had listened to the private conversation.</p><p> </p><p>"Can't use your eyes, can you, Granger?" He taunted angrily.</p><p> </p><p>She was too shocked to respond.</p><p> </p><p>"Or perhaps you can't use your mouth?" He added, smirking down at her.</p><p> </p><p>Since when did he get so tall? She thought vaguely.</p><p> </p><p>Her silence seemed to amuse him further, "Too shocked to speak, Granger? I understand I naturally take many people's breath away, but just a slight bump in a hallway really speaks volumes about your experience with men. Feeling a little frustrated? Maybe pent-up? Well, please grasp that I would never...consort with someone like you, even out of pity," he spat at her.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy was never nice to her, but today he was particularly vile.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>It's the tournament, he's upset and taking his anger out on me.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione once again thought of Harry and how terrible the situation was for him. Harry, at least, was no stranger to tragic events circulating around him; but Malfoy was a different story.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy spent his entire life without hardship or struggle, and his father was able to fix every issue he's had until now. This was the first time he would ever have a problem his family power and wealth couldn't fix, and despite his best efforts, Hermione could tell the strain it put on him.</p><p> </p><p>She finally found her voice, "I'm sorry this happened to you."</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy's eyes widened and flashed with fury. He instantly sneered at her and stormed away from the conversation. Ten paces away from her, he turned and glared at her once more, "I don't need pity from a filthy mudblood."</p><p> </p><p>Hermione cringed at his words, but Malfoy looked unapologetic as he walked away.</p><p> </p>
