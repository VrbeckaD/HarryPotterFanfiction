    <p> </p><p> </p><p>Life isn’t fair. Harry James Potter knew this very well. It was one of the only useful lessons his dear relatives bothered to teach him. The fact that it was a lesson that demanded little effort from them and caused him very much misery probably paid a big part in why they saw it fit to repeat it as often as possible.</p><p> </p><p>Why did he have to sleep in cupboard when there was room he could use in the house? Why did he have to do so many chores while Dudley played? Why was nothing he ever did enough for them? Why? Why? Why?</p><p> </p><p>Truth be told, Harry had spent a lot of time fantasizing about leaving the Dursley, he even started to work as soon as he could to save up money for a new life away from them. There was really no point in arguing over fairness when his aunt gleefully demanded he paid for living in the house the moment he received a paycheck. Nor when they kicked him out of their home as soon as he become eighteen.</p><p> </p><p>It sucked, but that was life.</p><p> </p><p>Now Harry worked as a pizza delivery guy for minimum wages , doing his best to pay for the shithole he lived in, and save up for college. Or something. To be honest Harry simply couldn’t stand the thought of proving his relatives right; he had to succeed in life because nothing would make them angrier. If you had nothing else, spite was a great motivation.</p><p> </p><p>So, Harry plastered on a smile as three drunk teenagers tried to argue that he was late (he was not) and that meant that the pizza was free, which frankly, happened way more often then it should considering their delivery had no such police.</p><p> </p><p>“Look,” one of the slurred out, “Late means free, okay? That was they said last time!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah!” The other two yelled in unison as though they believed it would strengthen the argument or something.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was getting pretty tired of this shit, not that any of that irritation made it to his voice, “As I said, our delivery service do not have that poli-“</p><p> </p><p>Of course, they did not have the decency to let him finish before whining again.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not true!”</p><p> </p><p>“Bullshit!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed, knowing he couldn’t spend the rest of the night arguing with them, “Look, if you are not paying, then you are not getting the pizza.”</p><p> </p><p>Simple concept really, and yet it was meet with booing. Ugh. Harry had done enough, right? He had already wasted 15 minutes on them and there was more work to be done. Having made up his mind, Harry he turned on his heel and walked away, ignoring the venomous protests behind his back.</p><p> </p><p>it was harder to ignore the bottle thrown at his head. Pressing a hand against his now aching head, Harry spun around furious. The giggling group of teenagers slammed the door shut.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes, Harry really hated his life.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Assholes, " Ron spat out.</p><p> </p><p>The corners of Harry’s lip’s twisted upwards, “You reached this conclusion from only hearing `there was these customers’?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I mean customers and assholeness go hand in hand,“ Ron said as if it was the most obvious thing, then there was a loud noise followed by cursing. Harry could guess with 99 certainty that Ron was still struggling with putting together that bookshelf.</p><p> </p><p>“Man, do Ikea purposely make these instructions impossible to follow?” Ron said aggregated before sheepishly adding, “Sorry. I just want to finish them before Hermione comes back. Oh, you are still coming over in the weekend, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry was outright grinning this time, talking to Ron always made him feel better, though he would have preferred it to be in person instead of phone. He was grateful he could take contact whenever work felt difficult.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, nothing could keep me away,”  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry last mission for the day was to an area he had never been before.  It was outside of their town on a dirt road with tall trees. The houses looked like plywood shacks and there were broken down cars and trash everywhere. The place reeked of a b-rated horror film and the fact that his destination was leading closer and closer to no man’s land wasn’t building his confidence.  </p><p> </p><p>Mistake number 1 was continuing anyway.</p><p> </p><p>He had seriously considered turning around as he plunged further and further into a pitch-black forest, until he finally drove into an open field.  The change of scenery was appreciated, although he was surprised to see a cornfield stretching out before him. From the vantage point upon the hill leading out of the forest, Harry could see strange patterns on the cornfield.</p><p> </p><p>It looked like crop circles, and while that weirded Harry out, he had seen stranger stuff delivering pizza so he didn’t think much of it.</p><p> </p><p>Mistake number 2.</p><p> </p><p>When he finally reached the house, and walked up to the door, no doorbell was present, so he settled on knocking hard and yelling, “Pizza!”</p><p> </p><p>What he expected to happen was that some haggard looking man wearing boxers and a dirty white tank would come out. Probably grumble something mildly threating before paying for the pizza so that Harry could get the fuck out of there.</p><p> </p><p>What Harry got instead was a tall, very handsome man in what seemed to be a Darth Vader getup. Honestly, that man’s attractiveness couldn’t be overstated; all dark wavy hair and gleaming eyes that would make anyone weak at the knees. Good thing Harry had already plastered on the typical service smile, for he sure didn’t know what to do with his face. God, he was looking like fool, right? Quick say something!</p><p> </p><p>“Um, er, “Harry spoke eloquently, “Pizza, yeah, pizza,” to make his point he shoved the box on mister Handsome’s face.</p><p> </p><p>The man raising an eyebrow, hesitantly grabbing the pizza before looking slightly mystified at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“Jgls?” The man’s voice had a dark, rich “metallic” sound to it, which almost made up for the fact that Harry had no idea what he was saying. Perhaps the man was a foreigner? Harry opened his mouth to say he didn’t understand when he heard a high-pitched voice speak up behind him.</p><p> </p><p>Startled he turned around turned to investigate, but for the second time that day, he was hit hard in the head, and this time the world turned black.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Harry began to rouse from his forced slumber, the first thing he became aware of was hard floor beneath him and the uncomfortable positioning of his limps. He bit back a groan when he realized his hands were tied behind his back, the rope digging into his skin and causing him lot of pain.</p><p> </p><p>The arguing voices, in a language he was no closer to understanding, only made his cracking headache worse. Miserable, he found himself curling up in the fetal position, the language barrier increasing his fears.</p><p> </p><p>Had he stumbled into a robbery? Would he be killed? Had they kept him alive just to torture him?</p><p> </p><p>The more he thought about it, the more stressed he became, the more afraid he became. And yet, it was that fear that gave him the strength to ignore the pain and open his eyes to take in the situation. For a short, painful moment, the world was only blinding distorted light.  The moment passed and Harry could make out the dirty living room before him.</p><p> </p><p>The couch was flipped over, broken glass laid on the floor and dust clung to everything. Four terrifying presence occupied the space before Harry. The most eye-catching was the man he met at the door, who sat upon the flipped sofa with a thoughtful expression, seemingly ignoring the three arguing people before him.</p><p> </p><p>Three people completely covered up in an odd looking dark metal and with-skull masks (at least, Harry prayed they were just masks). Two of them were impossibly tall and bulky, looking like bodybuilders on so much steroids that it could supply a country. The third was smaller in statue, though probably still taller than Harry, and seemed to be the one with most authority among the trio, if the way the two others were bowing their heads indicated anything. Then again, they still arguing, so Harry might be overreading it.</p><p> </p><p>Moving his eyes away, Harry caught sight of something that made his stomach twist violently and vomit taste made it way up to his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>In the corner opposite to him, laid three horribly mutilated bodies. A disgusting green substance was soaking the corpuses, mixing together with the blood, giving certain parts a brown appearance.</p><p> </p><p>Harry couldn’t stop the sob that tore itself out of his throat. It was such a horrifying image that terrified him to his core. God, was he next?</p><p> </p><p>His captures eyes snapped to him, the dark harried man the only expression he could see, and it revealed nothing. Cold eyes regarded him with bored indifference and held his attention until the shortest of them reached him and pulled him up.</p><p> </p><p>Grey eyes glistering with glee was the only thing showcased by the skullmask, and it did much to convey the cruelty of the person before him.  Harry’s sobs changed to whimpers as the person grip tighten to painful levels, busing working itself up to bone breaking.  The giggle that followed was feminine, light and overly sweet. That- she pulled him closer, drinking in the sight of his pain.</p><p> </p><p>“b€//a,” the man spoke, a hint of warning lingering in those unfamiliar words.</p><p> </p><p>The woman dropped Harry immediately, causing him to fall on his knees, all strength leaving him. Harry felt terrified to the point of numbness, barely reacting when the man continued to speak, presumably ordering them to bring out some chair and drag Harry to one of them.</p><p> </p><p>After watching Harry be thrown at chair, the man elegantly sat down on the one positioned across him. He carried an air of nobility, somehow not damped by the conceited expression he wore. Never had Harry felt more like an insect, than beneath that man’s gaze. A flash of anger ignited, though it was quickly stifled by how the man narrowed his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"I want you to do something for me, human", the man’s voice soared and sank in leisurely, elegant measure. A pleasant sound, even in these horrible circumstances, perhaps even more appreciated because of them.</p><p> </p><p>Wait –</p><p> </p><p>Harry blinked, a moment passing before he realized that he understood the words being said. The man’s speech - marked with the hint of accent, completely unlike anything Harry had heard before- was punctuated with mocking chuckle. The trio quickly joined, jeering at Harry’s confused expression.</p><p> </p><p>The man continued, “You stand before the great Lord Voldemort. I have chosen to grace this planet with my presence, quite the honor, believe me. My conquest of this planet is inevitable, so, it would be prudent of you to accept me as your ruler.”</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort paused, as though to give Harry a chance to respond, yet almost immediately resumed his speech.</p><p> </p><p>“While it true that you humans are primitive and frankly, very inferior to me, I’m certain that I can guide you to at least serve me well.”</p><p> </p><p>“Um,” Harry responded, baffled be the use of ‘you human’ and talk about planet. Has this man lost his marbles? Was Harry held captive by madmen?</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort shot him a cold glare at the interruption, and Harry got the hint and shut his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Leaning back on his chair, Voldemort conjured a rather cruel smile, sending shivers down Harry’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>“I have gifted you enough of my time, “ Voldemort tilted his head to the side, “I want you to take me to your leader."</p><p> Silence descended on the room. When it continued, and reached uncomfortable, Voldemort glared at Harry. Anger flashed in his eyes – red bleeding into those dark orbs, which frankly only served to stun Harry even more.</p><p> </p><p>What – where they serious? Surely this had to be some kind of sick joke.</p><p> </p><p>“±ÅFV,” one of the huge guys said, nothing friendly in his tone.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort snapped back, “ÕRS@.”</p><p> </p><p>And that, the oddness, the feeling of not understanding what was being said, pushed Harry to take a decision.</p><p> </p><p>Nervously, he managed to splutter out, “Leader as in leader of this town?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, of this planet.” Voldemort said impatiently.</p><p> </p><p>…okay, okay. Harry could do this, scared of saying something untruth and be confronted with it later, Harry went with, “Our…planet does not have one leader, but the leader of this country is said to be the most powerful person in this planet?”</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort narrowed his eyes, which were completely red now.</p><p> </p><p><em>I’m dead</em>, Harry concluded, feeling strangely drained of fear. He was just tired, very tired.</p><p> </p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, Voldemort said, “Very well,”</p><p> </p><p>Harry almost collapsed in relief.</p><p> </p><p>“Lead us to him then.”</p><p> </p><p>“B-but, but!” Harry felt panic raise again, “He is in another state, it is very far away!”</p><p>“We shall ride the vehicle you arrived with, ours is currently unavailable.” Voldemort concluded, signaling something to his companies with an odd hand movement.</p><p> </p><p>Harry, on the other side, was gasping in horror at the thought of transporting these maniacs across the country on his pizza delivery truck, but one look at the corpses stopped him from voicing his protests.</p><p> </p><p>The whole situation managed to reach an even higher level of absurdity when one of the bulky ones walked to the corpuses and, Harry kid you not, <em>swallowed </em>them.  Harry was not ashamed to admit that the sight of the skull mask expanding and opening a mouth, was too much for him.</p><p> </p><p>So, he fainted.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
