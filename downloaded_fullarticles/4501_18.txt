    <p>Remus Lupin was nervously pacing his tiny dormitory waiting to meet his roommate. He had filled out the application and was hoping for someone who was quiet and kept similar hours as he did. He had briefly spoken to his roommate, but so far all he knew was his name was Peter and he enjoyed cheese and World of Warcraft. Just as Remus was really working himself into a frenzy, he heard a timid knock at the door and a small, round boy with blond hair came in.<br/>

“Hi, are you Remus? The name’s Peter, we spoke briefly? And I thought I was here early! Ha, I um, I’ll just grab my things?”<br/>

Remus was relieved to note that Peter seemed even more nervous than he felt. It immediately put him at ease and he helped Peter bring in the rest of his belongings and get settled. Just as Peter was finishing hanging his Alliance poster above his bed, there was another knock on the door. Remus opened it and was very relieved to see his good friend Lily on the other side.<br/>

Lily and Remus had grown up down the street from each other and had known each other since they were in diapers. Lily leaned her hip against the door and gave Remus an appraising look.<br/>
“I hope you weren’t planning on going out like that? Will you put on some normal clothes for once? Honestly, what 18-year-old boy wears cardigans? It’s September! It’s warm! Get changed, we’re leaving in ten.”<br/>

Lily looked at Peter and smiled. “Hi, I’m Remus’ friend, Lily. We’re going to the Rush party down the street. Want to come with? I’m forcing Remus, but since I don’t know you well, I won’t force you to come. Yet.”<br/>

Peter blushed but seemed pleased to get an invitation. Soon the trio was off to the party, which was thrown by Greek Life on campus. Neither Lily nor Remus actually had any intention of joining Greek Life, but the word on the street was that they threw the best parties and had cheap beer.<br/>

There was a $5 cover for all incoming freshmen, which Remus and Peter agreed was reasonable, but Lily grumbled about until they were inside and handed their first lukewarm beer from the keg.<br/>
“Cheer up, Lil. At least the beer is free once we’re in! If it bothers you that much, we can leave. I wouldn’t mind. Really! We can go right now.”<br/>

Lily smacked Remus on the arm. “Remus Lupin, we are not leaving! We are going to have Fun and you are going to Meet People and Put Yourself Out There.”<br/>

Remus hated when Lily spoke in all caps like that. He was completely incapable of arguing with her. Remus decided his best course of action was to stand in the corner and try to blend in with the scenery. Lily, always vivacious and full of energy, was already bouncing around the room introducing herself and making friends. Peter shrugged, downed his beer, and went off to talk to a pretty brunette on the other side of the room. Remus didn’t mind being alone per say. He usually enjoyed it to other’s company. But the music was too loud, and he felt out of place in the tight v-neck tee Lily had insisted he wear. He wanted nothing more than to leave and go home to his dorm where he could finish reading his book, and possibly check Facebook and Tumblr for the next 6 hours.<br/>

Just as he was checking his watch to see if he had filled his hour obligation limit (it had been about 7 minutes), he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned and found a young woman standing in front of him with spiky pink hair and combat boots. She was very short but had the look of someone with a very large personality. Remus immediately began to sweat.<br/>
“Hi! I’m Tonks! Great party. Why are you standing here in the corner? Do you want to come dance with me? Or we could leave and go somewhere else. I know a great bar, I have a fake and I’m sure you could get in without trying very hard; you have that look about you. God this beer is awful! Can you believe we had to pay a cover? Ooh, I love this song! It’s so cool, so do you want to dance? I have some friends over…”<br/>

The more the girl, Tonks, talked, the more nervous Remus felt. He was starting to get tunnel vision. He really wanted to leave this party and this very nice, but aggressively enthusiastic girl. Just then, he felt a hand on his shoulder and was looking into a pair of grey (grey!) eyes.<br/>

“There you are! Sorry to interrupt, but I’ve been looking for you all night! Come on, we’re all over here. Excuse us.” The man gently took Remus by the arm and led him past a confused and mildly annoyed Tonks. Remus would have felt guilty if he hadn’t been feeling so overwhelmed.<br/>

“Here, have some water. Sorry about that, it’s just that you had that deer in the headlights look about you, figured you may need a little help. Really drink it, its just water it’ll help. I’m gonna give you a minute but I’ll just stand here until you feel ready.”<br/>

Remus had never encountered someone who knew exactly how he felt and what he needed before. This mystery person was a godsend in Remus’ eyes. He finished the water, took a few deep breaths and began to feel a bit better. The tunnel vision receded at the very least.<br/>

“Sorry about that, big crowds, loud music, very enthusiastic people. It drains me. Thanks for the water. I’ll be ok, really, if you want to head back to your friends.”<br/>

The man, Remus was beginning to notice, was extremely good looking. He was wearing very tight jeans and a beat up leather jacket. He looked cool, which would have intimidated Remus more had he been paying closer attention to what he was wearing. Remus hadn’t quite figured out his sexuality, but he knew that he wasn’t straight. Especially because looking at this man with the grey eyes and dark hair was making him feel flustered in a new and different way than listening to the other girl had. The man looked at Remus and smirked.<br/>

“Yea, no. I came to your rescue because you looked like you were about to pass out, but I also noticed you from across the room and thought you looked interesting. I was going to say hi anyway. So hi, my name’s Sirius. I’m here with my friend James, but he’s off somewhere trying to convince some poor, impressionable girl that he’s charming. What’s your name?”<br/>

Remus now was beginning to sweat, but in a different way. The pretty boy wanted to talk to him? Had seen him and thought he looked interesting? Remus was no pro, but he felt as if he were on the brink of an existential crisis.<br/>
“I’m Remus. Lupin. I’m here with my friend Lily and my roommate, Peter. Last I saw, they were trying to take over the world or something. I was just minding my own business with my warm beer, trying to figure out if it was too early to leave. Sorry. Parties just aren’t really my…forte.”<br/>

“Hey, I get it. At least you’re here with people, right? I love a good party but this one is a bit lame. I mean, house music? Really? And Dub step? What year is this?”<br/>

Remus found Sirius to be very funny, smart, charming and easy to talk to. They exchanged the usual information, such as hometowns and majors (English Lit and Engineering, respectively). Before he knew it, a very rough looking Lily came up behind him and put her head on his shoulder.<br/>

“Rem. Remmy. My feet. They hurt. Let’s go. This was a stupid party, I’m not even drunk, there’s a stupid boy over there that will not shut up about football and I think I lost my bag. Oh. No. It’s on my arm. Ugh my feet. Come on, I want nachos.”<br/>
Remus had to laugh at his friend. Regardless of what she claimed, she was very drunk and would doubtless want Remus to carry her halfway back to the dorms.<br/>

“Well, I guess that’s my cue to go then. I can’t believe I made it to be one of the last to leave the party. That’s definitely a first for me! Which dorm are you in? Not that, I mean…just. Curious is all, if you wanted to…”<br/>

Sirius laughed and shook his head. “Remus, please don’t worry. I had a great time. I’m over in Magnolia and could walk with you if you’d like. My friend James should be around soon. We can all go together to get those nachos if you’d like. Student Center is open ‘til 3.”<br/>

Remus tried to contain his goofy grin. Not only had he spent a few hours talking and dancing with this boy, but he also wanted to get nachos! Even with a drunk and goofy Lily!<br/>

“Ok, that sounds fine. Lil? That ok? And have you seen Peter?”<br/>

“Yes, yes whatever. Just get me nachos! And he left with that girl he was talking to, Emily? Emma? -Something like that. She had pretty hair and a nice laugh. You have a nice laugh too, Remmy! Have I told you that I love you lately? And you haven’t introduced me to your friend!”<br/>

Remus ducked his head and tried to will his blush away. “Well, good for Peter, I’ll just go back to the room with caution then. This is Sirius, Sirius this is Lily. We’re waiting for his friend and then we’ll get you nachos. And before you ask, I’m not carrying you. You should have worn different shoes. I love you too, and I will remind you of this moment in the morning when I wake you early to get coffee with me.”<br/>

Lily just smiled dopily and started wandering toward the front door, until she spotted a young man with crazy curly hair walking toward them. He had the biggest smile on anyone’s face that Remus had ever seen. It almost looked as if it hurt. Lily was looking at him with interest, but was clearly trying not to show it.<br/>

“Lila! So good to see you again! Sirius where the hell have you been all night, I’ve been looking for you! I did a keg stand and you missed it!”<br/>

“It’s Lily, what kind of name is Lila? Ugh, ouch, Remus come on, my feet. Nachos. Let’s go!”<br/>

“James, no one cares that you did a keg stand but I’m sure you’re very proud of yourself. We are going to escort these fine people to the Student Center so the lady can get some nachos.” Sirius grabbed his friend by the shoulders and they headed out the door.<br/>

Once they arrived at the Student Center, Lily happily ordered her nachos and ditched her shoes. She started recounting the people she had met along the night and how Peter and the girl he had met were not at all subtle. Before long, James and Lily actually seemed to be hitting it off. Remus and Sirius were hitting it off as well. Remus was cautiously optimistic that at the very least they had made some new friends in their first week of school.</p>
