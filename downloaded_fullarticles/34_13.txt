    <p>Disclaimer: I don't own anything that you recognise. </p><p>Helena peeked over the railing of the ship, her brother right behind her. They had been literally sucked into a painting, while exploring Slytherin castle. Wizarding paintings moving was nothing new, but this was something else entirely. They had landed into a ocean and had seen a ship. Seeing no other option, they had swam towards it, Helena using her magic to float upwards towards the railing. She was glad their familiars were in Harry's waterproof bag</p><p>She saw several men standing on deck with their backs towards them. She wondered what they were looking at, when she got her answer. "Men, behold our castaways: Edmund The Just and Lucy The Valiant. High King and Queen of Narnia." A familiar voice said. All the men on deck immediately kneeled down. Now knowing that the men at least weren't enemies, Helena and Harry carefully climbed on board."What are Harry and I? The next door neighbours?" Helena asked with a smirk.</p><p>The men immediately turned, several drawing their swords. Helena lifted her hands in a show of good faith. The silence was broken by a loud squeal, as Lucy Pevensie ran to hug her best friend, now a few years older than her.  Her brother Edmund immediately followed and greeted Harry with a brotherly hug. "Look who's all grown up." Edmund said with a laugh.</p><p>Harry huffed and whacked his arm. "We only turned seventeen last week. We're not in our fifties." He said, before his attention was pulled by another person: his old friend Caspian, King of Narnia. He made a very exaggerated bow. "Your Majesty." He said with a laugh, flicking his wrist to dry himself off. Helena jokingly followed his example with a bow of her own, once Lucy had let her go.</p><p>The king just laughed at their actions and bowed in return. Straightening back up again, he couldn't help but look at the older Helena, knowing that she now had his name on her wrist as well. Helena's small smile reassured him that she indeed had it on her arm. It had comforted her immensely in the past few years. He smiled back and bowed his head towards her. They really would have to talk later. Harry simply smiled at the silent conversation between the two soulmates. Knowing that his sister had finally found her soulmate after literal centuries, made him very happy.</p><p>That didn't mean that he and the others would not give Caspian hell, however, but he was glad that his sister's soulmate was someone, who he knew would take care of her. She deserved some happiness after living in literal Hell. "Don't I get a hug too?" Another familiar voice asked behind them and the twins immediately grinned as they turned around to face the speaker.</p><p>There, with her long, blonde hair in a braid, was Jade. "Of course you get a hug, sweetheart." Helena said, immediately walking forwards and embracing her as tightly as she could. "Hello, mum. It has been a while." Jade said as she happily hugged her mother back. "You can say that again." Harry replied as he hugged her as well after Helena had finally let her go. </p><p>Lucy and Edmund hugged her too, even if Jade was still slightly hesitant to hug the latter after everything she did in her previous life. Edmund just chuckled. "Come here." He said, before giving her the tightest hug he could give her. In the meantime, the twins greeted Jaesian, Jade's soulmate and the reincarnation of their old friend mr. Tumnus. "I hope you have looked after her." Helena said and he quickly nodded. After meeting with another old friend: the talking mouse Reepicheep, they went below deck to dry and change clothing.</p><p>They also found their old weapons, Lucy the dagger and cordial that she got from father Christmas and a sword for Harry and twin daggers for Helena that the twins had made themselves, when they were king and queen, the presents that they had gotten from Father Christmas were with them (in Edmund's case, it was his torch that he had left behind the last time that they were in Narnia).</p><p>Once they were done, the met in another room, but not before Harry opened his bag and let Cayden and Aurora out. "Well, at least some things never change." Edmund commented with a smile as Cayden slithered out first, only to stare at the fully golden Pegasus flying out as well. "Oh, she's beautiful!" Lucy gasped as she walked forwards to see Aurora better. The Pegasus neighed in gratitude</p><p>"Since you left, the giants of the north have surrendered unconditionally and then we defeated the Calormen armies at the great desert. There's peace across all of Narnia. And that in just three years." Caspian said, pointing at the map that they were looking at in what had to be his study. He saw Helena direct a proud smile at him and desperately hoped that no one saw his cheeks darken. Harry's smirk told otherwise. "And have you found yourself a queen in those three years?" Lucy asked, eliciting a sudden and loud coughing fit from Harry.</p><p>Caspian sent a small glare at his hopefully future brother-in-law, before turning back towards Lucy. "No. I am still waiting for the right person." He said, unconsciously rubbing his wrist, where Helena's name was written into his skin and soul. Lucy smiled at him, but dropped the subject for now. Caspian's eyes connected with Helena's and she quickly smiled at him. He smiled back at her</p><p>"So, if there is no trouble, then why are we here?" Edmund asked, unaware of the silent conversation between the two. Caspian replied that he did not know either. Harry looked over the map. "Where are we sailing to?" He asked. Caspian told them about the seven Lords who had fled to the Lone Islands, after his uncle Miraz had tried to kill them. He had made it his mission to find out what happened to them. </p><p>"What's east of the Lone Islands?" Lucy asked. "Uncharted waters. Things that you could barely imagine. Tales of sea serpents and worse." The captain, Drinian said. Edmund scoffed at that. "Sea serpents?" He asked with a nervous laugh. Helena smirked at him. "What's the matter, Edmund? You act like there is no sea serpent in earth's oceans." She said with a laugh.Edmund immediately sent her a panicked look at hearing her words. "Wait, there is?!" He asked with a very high voice. Helena simply nodded in answer.</p><p>"Oh yes. There are stories of a snake so large that it could wrap itself around the entire earth." She told the others, knowing full well that the serpent that she was talking about was actually real and still alive. "Of course, these stories were written in a time that everyone believed that the earth was flat." She added, seeing Edmund breathe a sigh of relief. She simply chucked at that </p><p>"Helena, could I speak with you for a moment in private, please?" Caspian asked, unable to keep silent for much longer. Helena nodded with a smile, knowing what he wanted to talk about. Harry, Jade, Jaesian, Lucy Edmund and Drinian all left the room, Harry closing the door with a final, warning glare towards the king. Turning around, Caspian saw Helena rolling up her sleeve and removing the spell that hid her soulmark, his name clearly displayed on her wrist. </p><p>He walked closer and carefully gripped her arm, gently ghosting his thump over the mark, feeling his own mark warm up at the contact. Helena reached out and rolled up his sleeve, seeing her own name on his wrist. "Hello." She greeted and he smiled at her, greeting her back. She reached up and caressed his cheek. "You have no idea how much the knowledge that you are my soulmate has helped me in the past few years." She said. He chuckled as he leaned into her touch, relieved that she was back with him.</p><p>"Glad that I could help you without physically being there." He replied sincerely. Helena smiled, before walking forwards and hugging him, resting her head on his chest. He was slightly surprised for a minute, before smiling and hugging her back, gently stroking her hair. "I know that this may sound crazy, but I missed you." He heard her mutter.</p><p>He chuckled at her words. "I missed you too. Don't worry." He told her and she smiled. They stood like that for several seconds, before there was a knock on the door. "Mum? Dad? You're needed on deck." Jade's voice sounded and Caspian sighed. "We'll be there in a minute." He said back and they heard Jade walking away. "She actually calls you that?" Helena asked with a laugh. </p><p>"Ever since you left. You should've seen the reactions of the Narnians when they finally figured out why." Caspian muttered and she giggled. "Well, she has been alone for a long time, both in this life and her previous one. Can't blame her for wanting a family." She said and he agreed, before they slowly let go and returned to the others on deck. Their knuckles touched, before they were forced to finally separate</p>
