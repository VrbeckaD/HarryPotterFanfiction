<p>Making the Call</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry huffed. “Why’d you assume I did something to him? And when would I’ve had time? I’ve been with you all week!” </p>
<p>“Point.” Draco bent over to look at Kreacher. “It’s just…this looks familiar.” </p>
<p>“Yeah? What is it, then?” </p>
<p>Draco shook his head. “I’m no expert. He needs to see an elf Healer for a proper diagnosis. There’s one close to Diagon.” He frowned. “At least I think it’s in that part of the city.” </p>
<p>Harry nodded. “Okay. But if we don’t exactly know its location, how do we get him treated?”</p>
<p>Draco sighed. “I’ll have to call Mother.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re ready to do that?” Harry asked, clasping Draco’s arm. “Your last conversation with her wasn’t exactly—”</p>
<p>“I remember,” Draco snapped. “I <i>was</i> there, after all.” </p>
<p>Harry raised an eyebrow. </p>
<p>Draco sighed. “Sorry.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled. “It’s okay. You think she’ll help?” </p>
<p>“Definitely. She’s got a soft spot for elves, so even if she’s still angry with me, she’ll tell me which part of the city the elf Healer’s located.” </p>
<p>“Okay.” Harry hugged Draco. “You can use the Floo downstairs if you want privacy…”</p>
<p>“That’s not necessary.” Draco smiled tightly. “It may be better to have a witness.” </p>
