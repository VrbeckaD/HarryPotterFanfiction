    <p>The war changed a lot of things in the wizarding world. The most noticeable change was in the Malfoy family. The patriarch, Lucius, fought against the light and then sent to Azkaban for a life sentence. Narcissa, pardoned of all charges moved, away to a small estate in the south of France. The most notable difference the wizarding world as a whole could see was in the young Draco Malfoy.<br/>
The events of the battle of Hogwarts washed over the general population through skewed reports from the Daily Prophet and hushed whispers heard between the bowed heads of witches and wizards as they rushed from place to place. The most truthful report the Prophet ever made about the war was three simple lists; the lists reflected the dead, the Death Eaters, and the heros. Prominently displayed beneath the Golden Trio and other notable names of the battle waved the flag of Malfoy. The whisperers flocked to darkened corners or bars to discuss this fact.<br/>
But how, they whispered, could the most notable of muggle-born haters and supporters of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named be named a hero? I heard that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had taken over Manor Malfoy. The hiss of mistold truths and untold stories slithered through the cracks of every mind until the only question peaking the minds all was this: ‘How did Draco Malfoy become a hero?’ </p><p>Draco stretched out on the small couch in the sitting room, pages slowly turning as he devoured his novel.<br/>
“Draco, remember I won’t be home till late tonight,” Harry called from the hall as he shrugged on a light jacket.<br/>
“I remember Potter, you are taking your girlfriend to dinner after her game. You have told me about six times already today. Don’t worry I won’t wait up for you. I am actually going out tonight.” Draco winced as he heard Harry stumble and felt the amazed gaze wash over the back of his head.  “Shut your mouth Potter, I do have friends you know.”<br/>
Harry coughed “I hadn’t said anything Malfoy.”<br/>
“You didn’t need to, I have lived with you long enough to know that stupid face you make when surprised.”<br/>
Harry barked out a laugh, “Have a good night then, I’ll see you in the morning.”<br/>
The hinges squeaked and Draco called after Harry, “Don’t let her out drink you tonight!”<br/>
Looking up at the ticking clock hanging from the wall Draco finished his page before pushing upwards to get ready to go out with Blaize. </p><p>Draco walked home, limbs warm from the drinks he had shared with Blaize. His friend was back in town from a world tour with his new business. The Zambini’s had managed to avoid the imperialist mentality of Voldemort’s campaign. Blaize’s mother had fled from England to Portugal when Voldemort had resurfaced, leaving her son to his own devices at Hogwarts. With no one breathing down his neck with mudblood propaganda Blaize had actively joined the Order in year four and had worked to keep those, who had no choice but to follow the tug of the chains of family, safe from themselves. He had masterminded, with the sly help of the Weasley twins, sweets that would help alleviate the crushing pains facing the Slytherin house. The man was brilliant knowing just who to tap to get what he wanted. It showed in the way his business had flourished in a few short months. Draco had treated him to drinks for his success as well as to say thank you for keeping him alive<br/>
Blaize had saved his life more than once over the years and the man deserved a medal for his efforts. Draco was pulled from his mental ramblings when he started up the steps to the door and found Potter asleep, head resting on his hand. Draco frowned, then swiped at his arm. Harry jerked awake with a bleary ‘Hey!’ before realizing it was Draco who stood before him.<br/>
“She out drank you didn’t she?”<br/>
Harry slumped comically, “My girlfriend could out drink a fish.”<br/>
Draco laughed out loud as he pulled Harry to his feet. “Come on chosen one, let’s get you to bed.”<br/>
Draco skillfully unlocked the door with one hand while holding Potter up with the other. Swinging the door open Draco’s guard rose; the kitchen light was on. A shape passed in front of the doorway into the kitchen and Harry sprang forward with a drunken speed. He collided with the body in the kitchen. By the time Draco skidded in behind him Harry lay on the floor, out cold. A woman crouched over him.<br/>
Draco assessed the situation in the split second it took him to reach for his wand. The sudden grip on his ankles stopped his hand. A quick glance down showed that the women leaning over Harry was indeed a witch, if the wand pointing at his now encased ankles was any indication. With her other hand she lightly slapped Harry’s face, a hum sounding from her throat as he didn’t stir. The witch looked up from Harry and Draco was instantly transported to a night, a little over a year ago. A flash of memory over took him, a small, broken body he held tightly, the gasping of breath as she struggled to breathe, and then the heart wrenching moment when he found her gone from her hospital room.<br/>
Hermione Granger had returned. </p><p>Draco started at her, she had disappeared from St. Mungo’s over a year ago. Snippets of those awful days stamped through his mind. A small broken cry that was cut off with the sound of flesh meeting flesh in violence. Draco and Harry bursting through the sitting room doors to find Ron lounging on the couch covered in Hermione’s blood. Without sparing a glance to one another Harry stunned Ron and Draco scooped up Hermione from where she lay, the pained whimpers reaching his ears as he flooed them both to St. Mungos. The moment he had stepped from the fireplace she had been taken from his arms, healers calling frantically as they assessed the damages. Draco slipped into Hermione’s room, ignoring the heated whisper of a mediwitch as he did so.<br/>
She lay, her quiet breaths startling Draco nearly to tears. For days he stayed by her bedside, always making room for those who loved her, but unable to leave her alone for fear of her slipping away. Three days after she arrived Harry finally convinced him to go and take a shower, he would sit with her. When Draco arrived both Hermione and Harry were gone.<br/>
Harry had been called to the Ministry, but Hermione had disappeared. To this day Draco couldn’t remember what happened after he discovered she was missing, though he is still banned from the 3rd floor.<br/>
Draco wrested his mind from the past, focusing instead on the now standing witch. A mask of calm slipping over his features he studied her. She had cut off her riotous hair, snipped close to her head her hair coiled in tight ringlets. Her skin had darkened and she wore a sleeveless top. Bold for England in October. She placed Harry’s wand on the table, and the flash of rings dotting her right hand caught his attention.<br/>
She looked up a Draco, no emotions flickering behind her eyes. “I assume my room hasn’t moved?”<br/>
A tendril of rage slipped into his voice as he responded, “How could we move anything from a dead woman’s room?”<br/>
Hermione’s shoulders rocked back slightly in response to the barb.<br/>
“I look pretty good for a dead woman.” Hermione lifted her bag from the counter and slung it over her shoulder.<br/>
It puffed a small cloud of dirt as it her back. Draco stood tall as she passed by, forcing her to move around him, despite his charmed ankles. Draco knew it was a childish power play but a small part of him needed it.<br/>
Draco listened until he could no longer hear her feet on the stairs before turning to Harry.<br/>
He freed his ankles and knelt lightly tapping Harry across the face, “Come on Potter.”<br/>
When he didn’t respond Draco sighed and levitated the unconscious man into his bed. Removing Harry’s shoes, he then covered him with a light blanket before retreating to his own room.<br/>
Draco deliberately changed into his night clothes, slipped between his sheets and commanded himself to sleep.<br/>
Of course it didn’t work. He focused hard on the blackness behind his eyelids as his mind catapulted him into the wreckage of emotions Hermione’s appearance had awakened.<br/>
His bad memories drifted through his mind like bees. Most days they were placid and easily dealt with, but then something would shake the hive and anger the masses. Draco struggled to push them away, to slip into a deep sleep that would hold the memories at bay. It was all for naught, and he knew it.<br/>
‘The only way to get out is through Draco.’ Dr. Bradley’s calm voice reminded.<br/>
Heeding the voice Draco dove into the thickest of the memories, reliving the past.</p>
