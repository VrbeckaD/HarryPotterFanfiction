    <p>It had been five years and twenty-three days since the Battle of Hogwarts. But it wasn’t like Harry was counting the days, not really, he just was only reminded of it every couple of months by people he worked with or just random witches and wizards he encountered in his everyday life.  He knew they meant well, but after the first hundred or so times of it happening it became more difficult for Harry to seem upbeat rather than annoyed. He wasn’t too keen on being reminded of it all every time he walked out of his front door. War is a hard pill to swallow for anyone, but in his opinion, it was a harder thing to live with once the fighting was over.  </p><p>Throwing himself into his work seemed like a much better option to Harry than dwelling on his own shit, even if it was a tad bit reckless. Being an Auror was a dangerous job, especially after Voldemort’s second climb to power bringing about a new wave of trouble like moths to a lamp. </p><p>Ron and he had only been partners for less than a year before Ron asked to be reassigned. He had told Harry that was nothing against him, but that the non-stop action just wasn’t suited for him anymore. Harry objected at first, but soon gave it up. There had been a distinct change in Ron after the switch that Harry simply couldn’t ignore. His best friend seemed happier at his new desk job within the department rather than out in the field. Harry respected Ron’s decision, but it meant that he almost never saw his friend in person. The majority of his missions consisted of him having to head out into the field more often than coming into the Ministry, and that saddened Harry a bit. </p><p>Hermione had recommended months earlier that they should meet up at least once a week, if not more, at the Leaky Cauldron or someplace similar in order to stay in touch with each other. Over time it became their new tradition. Harry was being sent on more and more missions that were longer and a great distance away from home, so he had sent his fair share of owls to either of the two in order to reschedule on more than one occasion. He knew it was selfish of him, but he loved his job as much as he loved his friends, and he didn’t want to have to sacrifice time with one to accommodate the other. Harry truly felt like he had a purpose when he was in the throws of battle, facing off against some Dark wizard or witch who thought themselves above the law and that they could get away with whatever evil doings they plotted. </p><p>For all that adrenaline and action, Harry was bound to get hurt once or twice. A broken ankle and a busted knee once on a mission in Romania (he had a bit of a tumble off of a rocky cliff with a Dark wizard he’d chased from London), his nose being broken so many times from fist fights that the bridge now had a permanent bump no matter how many times Hermione episkeyed it, and not to mention all the new scars that now called his body home. Most could be covered with clothing, but a few peaked out past his sleeves or collar. After a time, Harry just eventually gave up the hassle of hiding them. He had gained a new one on his most recent mission that started just above his right eyebrow and made its way down just past his cheekbone. It was created from a rogue hexing spell that bounced back towards him, which he only narrowly missed. Harry honestly felt more remorse for his glasses he lost during that encounter; they took most of the damage from the hex and were pretty much obliterated in the process. </p><p>Pushing his new glasses back up on his nose, Harry walked quickly towards the entrance of the Leaky Cauldron, tightly wrapping his arms around his middle in a failed attempting to keep warm against the biting wind. The frames on these glasses were thicker than the ones he had been used to, the lenses resembling more of a square rather than circles. He quite liked them, made him feel more like an adult, but he was still a tad bit insecure walking around. Shoving the thought aside, Harry opened the door and entered. He was greeted with the familiar smell of butterbeer and firewhiskey, warmth from the fireplaces within seeping through his sweater and coat as his eyes roamed around in search of his friends. </p><p>A loud “Oi!” coming from his left caught his attention. Turning to the sound, Harry felt his face break out into a wide grin. Hermione and Ron eagerly waved at him as he made his way over to them. They were nestled in a booth placed in a more private corner of the pub, three pints of butterbeer in already front of them. </p><p>“Oh, Harry! What have I <i>told<i> you about being careful!” Hermione exclaimed, eyes wide as she took in his face. He barely had a chance to wave over to where Ron was sitting before Hermione’s hands fluttered around him, turning him this way and that to inspect for injuries. Harry couldn’t help but laugh, she rather reminded him of Mrs. Weasley when she got like this. </i></i></p><p>

</p><p>Seeming satisfied with her search, Hermione pulled him down into the booth to sit next to her. Normally Harry wasn’t comfortable with people invading his personal space and grabbing him, but he knew how Hermione got when she was worried. Mild discomfort wasn’t a large price to pay in order to put someone who was practically like family at ease, so Harry simply just gave up trying to fight it.</p><p>“I think it’s rather brilliant,” Ron said as they walked up, “That and your new specs makes you seem more dark and mysterious. I’m sure the ladies will go absolutely ballistic.” </p><p>“Or guys,” Harry teased, a chuckle escaping him as Hermione whacked her fiance's shoulder with rather frightening speed.</p><p> “Right, right. Sorry mate, sometimes I just forget.” Ron apologized, giving Harry a quick pleading glance while rubbing his now injured arm. </p><p>“Buy me another round after this and all is forgiven.” Harry laughed, not at all offended by his best mate’s misstep. </p><p>It had only been a year since he had officially come out to the two of them, and he knew the idea of him and Ron officially being brothers was a hard thing for Ron to let go of. He and Ginny had been broken up for a few years then, but Harry knew that his best friend still hoped they would somehow rekindle whatever it was they had. Hermione, on the other hand, told him that she always had an inkling but she waited until Harry told her on his own time. All the anxiety Harry possessed leading up until that moment about what they would say seemed to evaporate. He knew his friends would always stick by him through thick and then, but it was never easy for Harry to open up about something that set him apart as “different” given his upbringing. It took him awhile to come to terms with who he was, but once he did finally come to the conclusion that he was attracted to both men and women, it gave him a sense of balance he hadn’t possessed in his life for a long time. And contrary to some of his small earlier fears, things hadn’t changed between him and his best friends besides the occasional slip up here or there (normally from Ron, which was quickly followed with immediate apologies and Hermione somehow laying siege to some extremity, much to the redhead’s displeasure.)</p><p>They ended up sitting for hours, just chatting and catching up on the goings on in each of their lives. He loved what he did, there was no doubt, but sometimes he forgot how comfortable it was to just be surrounded by his best friends.</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione sat up, directing her gaze to Harry. “I nearly forgot to tell you. You’ll never guess who walked into my office at the Ministry this week.” </p><p>Harry lowered his glass as he looked at her for a few seconds, thinking. He knew Hermione had some sort of leadership the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry, but beyond that Harry was utterly clueless. Seeing his lack of a conclusion, Hermione promptly waited until Harry took another sip from his pint before blurting out, “Draco Malfoy.” </p><p>He choked on his drink, nearly spitting it all out on the table. Harry wasn’t sure on who he was expecting her to say, but it wasn’t… him. </p><p>“You alright there mate?” asked Ron, raising an eyebrow at Harry’s reaction. Wiping his mouth on his sleeve, Harry could only nod. After finally collecting himself, Harry then asked why the man was there at the Ministry in the first place. </p><p>“It was a surprise to be sure,” she started, her brow furrowing. “Did you know he’s a registered Potions Master? And quite a good one at that, if I read his paperwork correctly.” </p><p>“Of bloody course he is,” Ron said bitingly, taking a large sip out of his already halfway drained glass.</p><p>“Talent is talent no matter who it comes from,” Hermione shrugged. “Apparently, some of the higher ups in the Ministry had requested his presence for something. He wouldn’t let anything slip when I tried getting it out of him as I was getting all the documents in order, but he was polite enough when we talked. Even made conversation,” she added, inciting surprise from all who were present. The Draco Malfoy <i>they<i> knew would never overlook an opportunity to gloat about something, especially where any of them were somehow concerned.  </i></i></p><p>

</p><p>“What would the Ministry need his input on?” Harry questioned, his mind trying to come up with some sort of explanation that made sense.</p><p>“A case maybe?” Ron offered. </p><p>Harry could only shrug, none of the cases he’d come across recently had to do with potions. The only thing he had on his plate now was a fairly cut and dry case, a group of dark wizards sparratically attacking Muggles and wizards alike all over Britain. They called themselves the Legion and were under the command of a wizard named Bane Selwyn. Harry had been on the case for about a year now, and he knew Selwyn was the one pulling the strings behind the whole thing, but the bastard was a right genius in covering his tracks. The group had been quiet for a time, so all Harry could do at the moment was hope Selwyn slipped up and get caught before he got the chance to hurt anyone else.</p><p>“Well whatever it is,” Hermione said sternly,“I’m sure it’ll have nothing to do with us.” Ron nodded in agreement, but Harry only looked down into his glass.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After saying goodbye to his friends, Harry began his walk, or rather stumble, home. He lived in a flat a couple blocks away from the pub, so it was convenient when the weather wasn’t all that great or for when he had one too many drinks. Which, in this case, happened to be both. He was exhausted and wanted nothing more than to sleep in his own bed, the previous weeks traipsing through foreign cities nonstop on his last mission finally catching up with him. In his opinion, the flat he now rented suited quite well. It had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and an adequate sized kitchen and living area that made him feel that he could spread out, but gave him a comfortable cozy feeling as well. Harry had sold Grimmauld Place about two months after the war to some lovely young wizarding couple, who had two small children and another on the way. Hermione practically pitched a fit when she had found out, hollering about the history of the place being lost and its importance, but Harry could barely stand to walk into the gloomy house after everything. It brought back too many painful memories, and he knew the family who bought it would get much more use out of it than him.</p><p>As he got home and made ready for bed, Harry couldn’t help but dwell on the information he had been given earlier. Harry won’t lie; he had definitely thought about Draco Malfoy off and on in the last five years. But never did he expect to come into any contact with the wizard again, even if it was only second-hand. Just hearing the git’s name caused his stomach to flip uncontrollably, a feeling that only increased with the added alcohol that was now in his system.</p><p>The last he saw of the Malfoy heir was at his and his family’s trial after the war. He had spoken on the Malfoy’s behalf, telling in detail about Draco’s effort to save Harry at the Manor and Narcissa’s blatantly lying to Voldemort’s face for Harry. Whether their actions were motivated for selfish reasons or for the good of the wizarding world, Harry hadn’t cared either way. What mattered to him was that they did them, despite circumstances making it loads easier to do the opposite and save themselves the trouble of it all. He had voiced this opinion at the trial, apparently shocking those around him. Malfoy’s expression as he finished his speech was something Harry thought he would remember for the rest of his life. He had never seen the git who, at the time, looked like nothing more than a boy who was failing miserably at hiding that he was absolutely terrified beyond belief standing next to his mother, who looked about as put together as her son did.</p><p>It happened very quickly in real time, but in his own memory it all seemed to have gone in slow motion, lasting for what felt like hours. As Harry turned to leave the stand, he couldn’t help but shoot a glance toward the nemesis of his childhood as the verdict of rang out in the courtroom. A booming “Not guilty!” filled the air, causing a wave of thunderous noise and chatter to erupt. Malfoy’s mother had her eyes shut, gripping her son’s arm so hard her knuckles had gone white, a stellar feat for someone with already alabaster skin. Yet Malfoy seemed to take no notice of this. It looked as if his whole body had gone unnaturally rigid, his fists curled so intently they seemed to shake as his trained gaze nearly made Harry trip on his own feet in surprise. He knew Malfoy had been looking at him; he could practically feel the blonde glaring holes into his back as he gave his testimony, the hairs on his neck being raised the entire time. But what he wasn’t prepared for was the all the raw emotion that seemed to overwhelm and radiate off of Malfoy. Utter confusion, perhaps anger or shock, Harry was never really sure. Yet what stuck with him the most was the sight of something else, something entirely foreign and unnamable, twisting up Malfoy’s normally sharp features into an unrecognizable expression that’s since been burned into Harry’s memory. The dark grey eyes looking back him then, that before only looked at him in malice or distaste, seemed to belong to an entirely different person than the boy who had attended Hogwarts with him. They pierced straight through him and into his core, as if Malfoy was seeing something inside of him that Harry could not... Harry barely managed to find any words to describe it later on. Hermione and Ron had asked why he seemed much more unhinged, so he simply settled on calling what he had seen as ‘haunting'. Because he knew deep down that look in those eyes would end up haunting him within his mind, whether he wanted them to or not.</p>
