    <p>One would think, after seventeen years of living in the same house and fourteen of flooing in the same fireplace, that one would remember the shape of the fireplace and that there is indeed a step up out of said fireplace. However I truly have not yet reached that point of intellect. Made obvious by the fact that once I flooed into my own fireplace, I go to step out and am caught by the ridge. Causing me to fall straight onto the hardwood floor of my living room, along with my suitcase, falling right beside me, causing a huge thunk.</p><p>“Miss Calliope!” Squeaked a voice that came with little patters getting closer. In a moment I am being risen off the ground and back onto my feet. “Are you okay?” Says the little elf that goes up to my knees. Margie. Our house elf. Who is now levitating my suitcase.</p><p>I nod back to her question, dusting off my t-shirt. </p><p>“Oh well you know, Miss Astrid is at the ministry still and Doctor Johnathon is still at St. Mungos.” Miss Astrid being my mother and Doctor Johnathon being my father. “Oh but they sent you an owl!” Margie squeaks trying to absolve something. “I’ll take your bags and unpack.” She turns to scamper up the stairs. “Miss Calliope, I’m overjoyed that you’re back.”</p><p>“It’s Callie.” I grumble to myself, watching as the elf levitates my bag up the stairs . As Margie arrives at the top of the stairs though, I just yell a Thanks up to her.</p><p> I walk out of the living room and into a side room that’s our owlery. On the first perch there’s a tawny owl and a small beak and a rust colored one on the other side of the room. I first go to the one on the right and reach out to pet him. “Godric, I missed you so much.” My owl nuzzles into my hand, probably searching for treats which I did not have for him. I then turn around to my parent’s owl. “Hello Rowena.” I hold out my hand and the haughty owl drops a letter into my hands. Don’t ask me how an owl can look haughty- this one just definitely is.</p><p>I break open the seal of the Ministry of Magic and open the parchment to<br/> read what my beloved mother had written me. </p><p>
  <em>Calliope, <br/>I, as well as your father, will arrive home before 7:00 tonight for dinner with your grandmother. I trust you enjoyed your time in Jamaica. Please be presentable and ready.<br/>Astrid Burke Selwyn<br/>Deputy Minister of Magic</em>
</p><p>Oh goodie. Family dinners with the Ravenclaw parents and the Slytherin grandmother. All purebloods who believe in the time before the war. Or grandmother at least. Everyone just goes along with what she says normally. Family time has truly been my favorite since the sorting hat screamed out Gryfindor seven years ago. Honestly before then too. The unspoken message of my grandmother coming for dinner is honestly just for me to keep my mouth shut. Which I have gotten better at over the years. </p><p>Rolling my eyes at her letter, I turn around back through the living room to the stairs. I run up them, taking them two at a time to get to my room. As I turn the knob and enter my room, I am surprisingly hit in the face with a flying shirt. “Margie!” I screech a little. “I promise I can unpack all of my stuff by myself.” </p><p>“No, Miss Calliope” she shakes her head emphatically. “If I don’t unpack for you, you never will.” She protests.</p><p>She’s right. I don’t. I’m never here anyways so I don’t unpack. So I just sigh and sit down on my bed so I can talk to Margie while she unpacks my stuff. I feel bad every time Margie does something for me, especially after hearing Hermione talk all these years, but at least elves get paid now. </p><p>“Miss Calliope, you are missed dearly when you are gone off with that clan.” Margie tells me as she is directing all of my clothes from the last week and a half where they are needed. I was of course with the Weasley/Potter clan on their summer vacation. Roxanne Weasley has been my best friend since the train ride first year and have been included in some family activities since the next Summer. My friendship with this “clan” along with my house has been a sense of grief among my family - especially my grandmother. The Burke side simply just does not appreciate the maroon and gold of Gryffindor.</p><p>“I honestly doubt anyone notices the difference Margie.” My mother and father are at work 80%% of the time so even when I am here in the time that I’m not with Rox or at Hogwarts, I spend most of my time alone. </p><p>“Well I notice.” Margie humphs a little. “Would you like me to set out a dress for you to wear tonight?” </p><p>I shake my head then stand up to go to look in my closet. “I’ll get it. Thank you Margie.” Then suddenly, the elf is wrapped around my legs.</p><p>“I’m glad you’re back, miss.”</p><p>I smile down at her. “Thank you Margie.” I reach down and pat her back that is still attached to my legs. “I really do miss you when I’m gone.” Margie has been at the house my entire life. Her mother was the elf before, before the new laws had passed for elves rights. But they stayed when my grandparents offered the right amount of compensation. After a moment, Margie pats my leg and apparates out of the room with a pop.</p><p>I glance at the clock that’s mounted on the wall which reads 4:00, so there’s still three hours until my family is supposed to arrive home. But I have nothing to do so I just decide to get ready now. I walk over to my closet and fish out a burgundy shift dress that’s hung<br/> up (no thanks to me). The choice in color has the distinct possibility of irking my family but I suppose they’ll just have to live. I put it on and go into my bathroom to finish up getting ready with a little straightening potion through my wavy brown hair. I didn’t do anything to rest of my face, even though it was peeling a bit from the sunburn I acquired from the Jamaican sun. </p><p>By the time I finish it’s only 4:15, so I slip on some flats and decide to wander back downstairs. In our living room (not the one containing the fireplace for the floo; big house what can I say) I see a stack of Daily Prophets and decide to catch up on what had happened during our vacation.</p><p>The first headline is about a group of wizards apparating in front of some<br/> muggles in Wales. Honestly it was probably some dumb teenagers so it’s obviously a little of a slow news day. I read a little of the story- and I was right but it didn’t say names. I guess I’ll find out who it was when we get back to school. After, I flip through the pages until I see a particular title that catches my eye.</p><p><em><em>“</em>POTTER- WEASLEY CLAN HOLIDAY WITH HIGHER UPS”</em> is the<br/> title of one of the columns. I sigh, preparing myself to read the gossip rag, presumedly detailing the past week and a half away.</p><p>
  <em> On this annual Potter-Weasley (Wotter as we at the prophet affectionately refer to them as) clan holiday, the family went to the sunny beaches of Jamaica. This year (like many others) the family is joined by Calliope Selwyn, daughter of renowned deputy Minister of Magic Astrid Selwyn (who we at the prophet hear is getting ready for a campaign to be Minister of Magic). Calliope is known as Callie to those who she is close with. The boy-who-lived and company were able to visit the vast sandy beaches of the is,and in their week and a half there. Daily Prophet correspondent Phoebe Dench was able to catch up with Callie Selwyn during those times on the beach. When asked about the potential benefit to her mother’s career of her proximity with the most prominent wizarding family, her response was “Sodder off. My friends are not political devices.” and those friends dear reader if you’re wondering are first, Roxanne Weasley, daughter of George Weasley, the war hero and owner of Weasleys Wizard Wheezes (we know it’s hard to keep track of all of them) and Angelina Weasley, former chaser to the Harpy’s. The two are rumored to be the best of friends and are entering their seventh year, along with James Potter and Freddie and Dominique Weasley. The five are all close and in Gryffindor together. Callie, as we mentioned before has been included in many of the Wotter’s affairs since her first year. Callie has come from a long line of Selwyn Ravenclaws and Burke Slytherins with her own mother being one of the very first Ravenclaw Burke’s. I imagine the shock was even more felt when Callie was declared Gryffindor, which begs the question of any familial tension through the house factor. Anyways the family enjoyed swimming in the beaches, the magical menageries that feature a pan assortment of creatures and were even forced (we assume by the resident smart one Hermione Granger- Weasley) to go to a museum of magical artifacts. To see pictures look at pg 7. </em>
</p><p>I do not go look at the creepy pictures that have been no doubt sneakily taken. Every time my name is mentioned in these I’m mortified, but this is the most in depth thing that’s ever been done on me. It’s awful. I hate this and I hate the microscope. It’s only gotten worse since mother was made deputy minister. I also just hate the way they’ve talked about and stalked me and my friends. </p><p>Me, Rox, and Don has been sitting on the beach, laying out, when out of the blue this random bird flew up right beside Rox and turned into a reporter and accosted us basically. Shouting and asking questions and taking pictures. All in the names of news though amiright.</p><p>I hear the floo start up again and hear clomping across the floor. I spring  up to go greet it- him- I mean my father. Healer Stephen M. Selwn is right at the doorway as I turn. My father is an imposing man standing at 6’5 with a copper tint that’s slowly gaining silver strands, I have my tanned skin and freckles from him but instead of his red tint I have my mother’s dark hair. He smiles seeing me, “Callie” he and my brother Leo are the only ones who call me that in this family. “How was your vacation?” </p><p>Oh dear old Stefan, putting in that effort. “I had a lot of fun” I offer up.  “You would’ve loved the botanical gardens”</p><p>“I read all about it in the prophet” he gestures to the other room I had just  been in where we keep our prophets. “It looked nice”</p><p>“Yeah” I force out an awkward chuckle and gesture to the same place he  just did. “I just read all about that.”</p><p>He shakes his head good-naturedly, with a smile of disbelief crossing his face, while taking off his coat. He hands the long brown <br/>thing to Margie, who had snuck up behind him. He mumbles a thanks to her and turns back around to me. “Those reporters have become a straight nightmare. One pretended to have dragonpox just this week to question me about your mother.”</p><p>I’m about to respond with tales from Jamaica but I hear the floo power up once again. I turn again to see my mother, deputy minister of magic, Astrid Selwyn. She is in deep blue robes which just adds to her strikingness. She has dark- almost black hair- pulled up in a perfect bun and a pale perfectly blank face, covering up a spray of freckles on her cheeks that you would never believe were there “Oh, Calliope '' She looks me up and down. “You are back from your holiday. It looked eventful in the prophet.” Her tone underlaid with a little edge.</p><p>“Yes” I attempt to smile through her snipe. “It was very fun, despite the interruptance by the reporters.”</p><p>“You know I hate our family’s name being drug through those gossip rags.” She scolds coldly, shrugging off her coat. “I would really prefer you not to speak to the reporters Calliope. It really portrays us in a poor light”</p><p>“Oh yes the poor light of the Potters and the Weasley’s, the saviors of the wizarding world, I’m so sorry.” I quip back. “Sorry about talking to the reporter.” I walk over and sink into the chair that faces them. “You know next time a giant bird turned reporter accosts me on the beach, I’ll just ignore it.” My tone dripped in sarcasm.</p><p>“Callie!” My father chides me. “Do not get snippy with your mother.”</p><p>“Sorry” I mutter underneath my breath.  Lying obviously. Neither of my parents say anything but instead drop into the chairs around me.</p><p>“Calliope, don’t you have another dress you could wear?” My mother starts. Definitely because the color. She doesn’t allow me to get another word in before she keeps talking unsurprisingly.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Her eyes dart over to the clock. “Uhh”She scoffs. "I would ask you to go change into something more appropriate but you don't have time." she says exasperated. “Your grandmother is due to arrive any minute. Where is your brother?” She means Leo, my older brother who graduated from Hogwarts three years ago and now in magical law school in the states. He has been home for the past two weeks though.</p><p>“I’m here mother” he strides in through the door. The tall dark-haired brother of mine leans down to greet my mother with a kiss on the cheek. Leo, the favorite, the golden child, the perfect raven claw son, Head boy, top of the class, even has made my grandmother proud (despite not being a slytherin) “Father” he shakes his hand heartily and leans down to kiss my cheek before sitting down with us. “Callie, how was your holiday?”</p><p>I sigh having to answer the same question for the third time about my time in Jamaica. Which everyone had already obviously read about already. “Super fun” I attempt to keep the sarcasm out of my tone.</p><p>“Oh how nice” he brushes me off before laying his full attention on our mother. “I read about Minister Shacklebolt’s proposal today.” I roll my eyes at his little suck up.</p><p>“Oh yes.” She lights up at the mention. Of her job. “I am quite pleased with how it turned out.” Before I completely tune out the floo starts up. “Oh that must be mother.” We all stand to greet her.</p><p>My grandmother looks less imposing and threatening then she actually is. Slytherin, pure-blood and proud- she somehow was barely proud of my mother. The disappointment and annoyance at my somehow innate Gryffindor characteristics and subsequent sorting forced me into a place on the receiving ends of constant snips about anything and everything. “Astrid.” She greets. “Leo, Calliope, Stefan” she nods to each of us, stopping at me giving me a once-over… definitely the dress.</p><p>“Well shall we go eat?” My father suggests. He feels my grandmother’s disappointment almost as much as the rest of us do and likes her as much as someone in his position would. Yet he tolerates her better than the rest of us normally do. We dutifully follow behind him to our dining room where Margie has set out our food.</p><p>“Dinner is served.” The elf squeaks from the bottom by the table. My father sits at the head of the table, my mother on his right and besides her my grandmother. Henry sits on the other side of my Father and I plant down beside him across from my grandmother.</p><p>“Thank you, Margie. You are free to go.” My mother dismisses the elf who apparates with a pop. Most likely going to her cottage with her family until she has to clean up dinner.</p><p>“Our elf doesn’t need to be told when to leave. And she still lives in the home, of course by her own choice, but they just don’t make elves the ways they used to.” My grandmother comments as the first course- a soup- pops into our bowls.</p><p>My brother shoots me a look from across the table almost daring me to say something like I have before but I refuse to be baited. At least in the first course. Elves rights have gotten significantly better in the last forty years, they are all paid set wages, all are supposed to have homes and attend schools. But still there’s ways to always improve. But in this regard I’ll just buy my tongue, and shovel my soup down.</p><p>“You know Astrid, if you’re looking for another elf I have the perfect place to find one.” My grandmother starts. Oh no. That sounds severely illegal.</p><p>My mom brushes off her suggestion. “Oh mother I would but with me and Stefan working so hard and Leo in the states and Calliope at school there’s barely enough work for Margie.”</p><p>“Hmm” My grandmother responds and the conversation is quickly turned to the ministry and the states and eventually to Leo’s job.</p><p>“Oh yes. I’ve learned exorbitant amounts, even by Americans yes. Once I’m able to transfer my new knowledge to a career here- which I hope to be able to do within the year- I believe I can work my way up.” Oh wow Leo you golden child. How great you are. Let me worship you. </p><p>“You know who else I heard was trying to climb ranks in the ministry?” My grandmother starts. “Calliope’s little friend's family, that Hermione Granger- Weasley” at that I look up from the food on my plate- now a shepherds pie.</p><p>“Oh that’s interesting. Callie, do you know anything about that?” Leo continues his little suck up act. He knows I know. And I do. Rox’s aunt will be going up against my mother for Minister of Magic. Hermione was speaking to us about all the changes she’d like to make and it truly sounds good. But I’m not telling my family any of that. I bring my napkin up to my mouth to blatantly lie. “Oh well nobody mentioned anything to me.”</p><p>Mother is a little steamy at this news. “Well everyone knows I’m in line to be minister next.” She tosses her head and takes another bite of the shepherd's pie. “Minister of law enforcement can not cut it.” I just stare at my food awkwardly. </p><p>“Especially a mudblood.” My grandmother adds and you could see every spine bristle. Old wizards, pure blood enthusiasts and the like don’t know how to not be a bigoted but it is a shock to hear the words.</p><p>“I would just rather it go to me.” My mother says rather haughtily, despite her own discomfort at the use of the slur.</p><p>“Trust me” my grandmother says. “It’s going to happen. We will make it happen.” Can I get a woo for fun family conspiracies. During this time I am just staring at my plate until a pudding pops up for dessert.</p><p>“Oh yum.” I mutter keeping my gaze at my plate, trying to keep myself out of the conversation. I’m sincerely trying not to repeat any angry conversations that have happened with my mother and grandmother.</p><p>“Calliope” my grandmother calls and I look up. “I noticed a profile of you in the prophet with the Potters and Weasleys” This again Merlin’s wand.</p><p>“Yes” I answer through a bite of pudding trying to scarf it down. “The reporter was an animag-“</p><p>“Reporters are quite awful aren’t they dear?” Grandmother smiles condescendingly and reaches over to pat my hand, still holding the fork. “It takes much grace to combat them which will come over time.” </p><p>“I’m sure” I mutter out through my teeth at her backhanded reprimand.</p><p>“When do you two go back?” Grandmother changes the subject.</p><p>Leo starts. “I go back to the states next week.” He’s about to go into a spiel about his school but I save everyone at the table by cutting him off.</p><p>“I leave in two days. I’m going with Rox’s family to Diagon Alley the night before so I can get all my supplies and such.” I blurt out a little awkwardly.</p><p>“Can’t the house elf just do that for her?” My grandmother asks completely ignoring me and turning to my mother.</p><p>“Oh we like to keep Margie here in case we need anything.” My mother offers. That’s really the reason Astrid. Okay. My mother is obsessed with pleasing her mother and making her proud. I guess my mother isn't proud of the fact that I just want out of this house as much as possible. Somehow the desire to make my mother proud skipped me. </p><p>“Hmm” My Grandmother lets out a little disapproving breath of air. “A family friend, Professor Rozier will be teaching transfiguration this year. You’ll want to reach out to him.” Grandmother moves on to instruct.</p><p>I just nod in response as the plates vanish signaling the end of the dinner.</p><p> We stand up in response to exit the room. As we walk out Grandmother gets Mother's attention. “Astrid can we speak about what we discussed earlier?”</p><p>“Of course. In my study.” They both turn to us. “Goodnight children.” We both kiss our grandmother goodbye and Leo and I head up the staircase while Father stays downstairs to his own study.</p><p>I elbow Leo. “Hey don’t you want to get in on what scheme they’re cooking up in there.”</p><p>“Callie I certainly do not need their schemes.” He scoffs indignantly.  “I’m on track to-“</p><p>I cut him off. “Yeah, yeah I’ve heard.” I raise my hands for air quotes “working right under the partners at one of the top firms” I make my voice go deeper mockingly.</p><p>“Well what do you have planned after this year?” he questions. “You might be the one  wanting to get in <br/>on that scheme.” His fires back with what is supposed to be a joke. Not really funny though. </p><p>I just put my hands on my hips and turn at him. “Arsehole.” I turn back around walking. “Anyways it’s not like they would even have me.”</p><p>“Very true. You do know how they feel about Gryffindors.” he laughs.</p><p>I roll my eyes and stick up a certain finger at him, causing him to laugh even more. </p><p>"Callie don't be angry at me. You know I'm right." He crosses his arms fake pouting. I punch his arm and he flinches back. "Ouch! What was that for?"</p><p>"So we could be even." I explain. "I want Mrs. Chen's tomorrow before I go back." I move on to making plans about my favorite restaurant. "And I need you to go with me but I can't go if we're not even."</p><p>"Ahh yes the rules of karma." He deadpans. "But I suppose I can go with you to the restaurant. But only if her little dragon doesn't light us on fire again."</p><p>"I really can't promise that."</p>
