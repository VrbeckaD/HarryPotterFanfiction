          <div class="userstuff"><p>“So how was your day?” Harry asked, a perfectly innocuous question, but behind it is something more.</p><p>“Oh you know, it was…” Draco’s words are caught as Harry pressed his lips to his throat. “Fine,” he exhaled.</p><p>“What did you do?” Harry asked, sucking on the pulse point below his ear.</p><p>Draco shuddered. “H-had lunch with Pans.” Harry sucked hard enough to leave a bruise and Draco moaned.</p><p>“Then what?” Harry asked, kissing all the way to the other side of Draco’s throat.</p><p>“We, uh, went… mmm… sh-shopping,” Draco said.</p><p>“What did you buy?” Harry asked, laving his tongue over Draco’s throat, as he teased his fingers up Draco’s sides. Draco moaned, throwing his head back.</p><p>“I… can’t…. Remember,” Draco said breathlessly.</p><p>“Yes you can,” Harry assured him, never letting up on his kisses on Draco’s throat or the fingers ghosting across his flesh.</p><p>“S-shoes,” Draco said. “A new pair of,” he moaned. “Fuck, Harry. Why are you so interested in how my day was?”</p><p>Harry smiled against his flesh, “Because I love you. Now go on,” he said, caressing his fingers up Draco’s chest. “What else did you do?”</p><p>Draco shivered at the touch, “Had tea.”</p><p>Harry hummed in response, unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, slowly. “And?”</p><p>“B-biscuits,” Draco replied, as Harry pressed a kiss to every millimeter of exposed flesh.</p><p>“And?” Harry asked.</p><p>“I don’t… I don’t know Harry, p-please,” Draco begged.</p><p>Harry chuckled, “Please what, kitten?” he asked, sucking one of Draco’s nipples between his lips. Draco whimpered.</p><p>“P-please take me,” he begged.</p><p>Harry smirked, “Oh I’ve already got you, babe,” he purred in his ear. “Don’t you wanna hear about my day?” Harry asked, between kisses on Draco’s chest.</p><p>“Mmm, can you tell me about it with your cock inside me?”</p><p>Harry chuckled, “I suppose I could, but what fun would that be?” he teased.</p><p>Draco whined, as Harry stood up fully and kissed the tip of his nose, pulling Draco into his lap on the couch as he proceeded to tell him about his day, all the while teasing his fingers up Draco’s thighs, just shy of where Draco wanted him to touch most.</p></div>
