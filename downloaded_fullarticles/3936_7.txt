The feeling of cold water sliding down his back let Harry know that his potion was fading. His skin was bubbling and his body growing taller, bigger. The clothes on his back were almost screaming at the strain as they were pushed to their very last stitch.</p><p>“Stand down! It’s Captain Rogers!” Another voice, this time female, ordered briskly.</p><p>“Sir, footage shows Captain Rogers is aboard the quin-jet flying back from Germany!” Another voice cried out in warning.</p><p>‘Bloody hell, how many people were surrounding him?’ Harry thought to himself in a panic. The bubbling along his skin had thankfully stopped although his clothes were about one wrong move from abandoning him altogether.</p><p>Harry reached up a hand much larger than he was used to, to swipe the glasses from his face so his vision could return to normal. Slowly, very slowly Harry pulled himself up until he was standing unsteadily looking around what looked to be some highly-advanced computer deck, filled to the brim with personnel, most of whom were pointing weapons of some sort at him. Harry’s eyes were drawn away from the immediate threat to look out the huge windows in front of him, to see a sight not often beheld without the feeling of a broom between his legs. It was a marvelous sight and Harry was almost tempted to lose himself completely in it and just stop caring altogether. He’d been fighting for so long; couldn’t he just have this moment?</p><p>But no, his potion had worn off. These people wouldn’t know who he was. They were likely to open fire with their deadly looking weapons if he didn’t start explaining and fast. For now they seemed to be examining him and his movements closely as if unsure how to proceed. Harry in turn began examining them carefully. He counted exits and the exact number of people in the room. He also acknowledged that although he held no weapon the dark-skinned man with the eye patch was undoubtedly in charge. Which is why Harry directed his attention toward him.</p><p>“Er, Hello?” Harry eventually greeted with an awkward wave of his left hand. With his right, he brushed the slightly longer, still messy, blonde hair from his eyes. “This is a bit of a strange question but um, where the bloody hell am I?” Harry asked trying to come across as nonthreatening as possible.</p><p>“You don’t know?” The eye patched man asked in what must have been disbelief although it came out sounding angry.</p><p>“No?” Harry replied sheepishly. “Look I know this is probably hard to believe but I wasn’t trying to get…. here. I mean, one minute I was walking through a forest and the next thing I know I’m here.” Harry began to explain, his voice becoming harder as he went. How many times exactly was he going to have to walk to his own death before this whole thing was done?</p><p>Suddenly Harry began to feel all kinds of pissed off with just about everything. He was ready. He was about to sacrifice himself to free a world that had done nothing but try and kill him. All he’d wanted was to see his parents one last time, maybe apologise to Sirius and Remus for leading them to their deaths. Was that so much to ask for? Instead he was stranded god knew where, far away from Hogwarts leaving his only friends to probably be brutally murdered. He needed to get back. And he needed to get back now!</p><p>“How about you take a seat son and we can talk about this?” The eye patch man offered slowly. Maybe he could sense Harry’s building anger.</p><p>Harry wasn’t about to sit around chatting while all his friends were left to die so instead he closed his eyes, concentrating on where he needed to be before spinning on the spot.</p><p>Except there was no loud crack and no squeezing sensation. In fact, when Harry opened his eyes he was still in the strange place except now he was facing a conference table. Harry stumbled over to the conference table, falling into one of the chairs. He paid no attention to the final ripping noise his shirt gave before the shoulders burst, falling in strips to hang at his waist, leaving his scarred torso on full view.</p><p>He was thin, skinnier than he’d been in a long time as food wasn’t as easy to come across when running from all of England. There was no doubt a mixture of both bruises, burns, blood and dirt striping his torso from both his escape at Gringotts and the battle he’d just come directly from fighting.  Add to that the scars he’d acquired from years of fending off Voldemort’s attacks and well, he certainly looked the war torn solider he was inside.</p><p>“Let’s start with a name, shall we?” The eye patched man suggested briskly, coming to stand on the opposite side of the table of where Harry had thrown himself.</p><p>“Yeah sure, go ahead.” Harry responded distantly. The eye patched man frowned as his one visible eyes narrowed.</p><p>“I’m Director Nick Fury. And you are?” Eye patch demanded. And yeah okay, Harry could totally see why a name like Fury would suit the sour man in front of him.</p><p>Harry paused momentarily considering which name he should give, for all he knew these people might be enemies. With his name plastered across wanted posters in both muggle and wizarding Britain maybe it would be easier to use his birth name? Or maybe a variation of the two.</p><p>“Harry James Rogers.” Harry quickly blurted when the expectant silence began to stretch just a bit too long.</p><p>“James Rogers?” Fury repeated after a moment. Harry shrugged, giving the man a quick nod. “What age are you kid?” Fury asked softly.</p><p>Harry gave an exhausted sigh, melting further into his seat. “I’m seventeen. My turn. Where the hell am I?” Harry demanded grouchily.</p><p>“You’re on a SHIELD Helicarrier, we’re currently over the Atlantic Ocean heading toward New York.”</p><p>“New York?! As in America?!” Harry exclaimed jumping to his feet. Fury watched him with a single eyebrow raised as Harry spun around as if expecting to see a lit-up sign advertising ‘ENGLAND THIS WAY’. Harry’s hands flew into his hair as he spun on the spot a mantra of no’s falling disbelievingly from his lips. He couldn’t apparate that far, didn’t know how to create a portkey and approaching the American Ministry of Magic was tempting fate. Who knew how far Voldemort’s reach had gone? Certainly, most of Europe was subdued under his rule, who was to say America wasn’t to?</p><p>What would Voldemort do when his countdown was done and Harry failed to appear? He’d kill them, he’d kill all of them. Oh god, he had to get back!</p><p>Spinning to once more face the eye patch man Harry leant forward, palms on the table, eyes staring straight at the man.</p><p>“I need to get back to England, specifically as far into the Scottish Highlands as we can get. The lives of everyone, <em>everyone</em> in this world I care about depends on it.” Harry explained as sincerely as he could, the war-torn soldier in him wouldn’t allow for his hard stance to soften any more than it already was. It felt to him that the tight ache of stress would forever have his shoulders stiff and his face haunted.</p><p>Fury nodded to one of his people, a female with hair pulled in a tight pony tail and a no nonsense presence. The woman turned and started barking orders to a group of adults sitting at one section of the many computer units.</p><p>“Bring up whatever we’ve got around the Scottish Highlands.” She ordered briskly.</p><p>“No, you don’t understand. Your technology won’t penetrate…” Harry trailed off as the castle he called home came into view. The turrets stood proudly, the quidditch pitch whole and untouched, the grounds filled with small dots, obviously, students as they basked in the glow of a <em>hot Summers Day</em>.</p><p>As in daytime.</p><p>Not the grey lifeless world Hogwarts had been when Harry had entered the forest, knowing dawn was still hours away,</p><p>“Bring up video from right now!” Harry ordered rushing toward the computer screen to stare at the zoomed in, crystal like quality of the lake, and the three Hufflepuff’s sitting beside it laughing.</p><p>“This feed is live, sir.” The man sitting in front of the computer stuttered nervously as Harry loomed over him.</p><p> “That- That’s not possible. It was still night, only a couple hours from dawn, but- but it was night.” Harry whispered staring in disbelief at the unfamiliar students.</p><p> “Sir, the others have arrived.” A voice said distantly although Harry wasn’t much listening as the statement hadn’t been directed toward him. Fury nodded absently, still watching Harry as he leant over the computer.</p><p>“Son,” Fury called waiting until Harry turned to look at him until continuing. “What year is it?” Fury asked calmly.</p><p>Harry’s brows scrunched up in absolute confusion at the question. “I- I lost a few hours, okay? I’m not crazy!” Harry growled defensively.</p><p>Fury raised one unimpressed brow, his mouth tightening to a frown. Four men and one woman entered the room, although Harry only distantly knew this. His wartime reflexes had him counting the people entering and exiting the room even now during his distress. “Answer the question, Rogers. What is todays date?” Fury demanded sounding a lot less patient.</p><p>“May 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1998.” Harry bit out harshly, glaring at the eye patched man. If anything, the man’s frown became more pronounced as he turned his back to Harry to look at the new arrivals. Harry followed his gaze.</p><p>In the lead was a red headed woman who despite being genuinely beautiful looked as though she were hiding a deadly side he didn’t want to see. Next to catch his attention was the giant blond man standing next to the redhead, he wore the strangest armour Harry had ever seen. Despite his red cape, what struck Harry as the strangest was the hammer hanging from the man’s hip. An honest to god stone hammer.</p><p>Harry turned ever confused eyes onto the next two in line, both the shortest of the group. Both polar opposites. The man with the goatee seemed to scream look at me in everything from his look to his stance. The other man however seemed to almost be curled into himself, shoulders hunched inward to make himself seem smaller and non-threatening. For a moment, Harry’s breath was stolen as he was reminded of a younger Sirius and Remus from Snape’s memory. A version of them before the war took its toll.</p><p>Harry tore his eyes reluctantly from the two, not noticing how the hands at his sides curled into fists to stop the shaking. The last man Harry looked to had him pausing as the two gaped at one another. It wasn’t that they were completely identical, but they were close. So close that upon first glance they could have been damned twins. That is, if it weren’t for what Harry suspected was at least a five-year age difference.</p><p>Harry’s hair was both messier and a darker blond than the man before him. Harry’s cheek bones slightly more angular. And yeah, Harry was definitely skinnier than this hulking man, his ribs showing despite the still rather impressive muscles on him. This Harry put down to the simple fact he had spent the last year being undesirable number One.</p><p>Slowly Harry turned to face Director Fury once again. Harry was no Ravenclaw but he was slowly starting to piece together a rather terrifying picture. All the advanced tech, the school not ravaged by war, the man that looked near identical to him and- and Director Fury’s strange question.</p><p>“What-” Harry broke off licking his lips. “What year is it?” Harry asked softly, head titled sideways as he squinted slightly at the feel of such an odd question.</p><p>“2<sup>nd</sup> of May 2012.” Fury announced brutally honest like ripping off a band aid. Harry stumbled forward a step before his knees strengthened again.</p><p>So, he was in the future by about fourteen years.</p><p>No big deal. He’d dealt with worse. At least he’d gotten out of that damned forest, right? Hadn’t had to fight that maniac knowing at best he was only throwing his life away to buy time for his two friends to locate the final Horcrux.</p><p>Harry’s hand went to his chin and he rubbed it hard as he worked his jaw. Forced his shoulders back until he was standing tall with not more than a huff.</p><p>“Right, sure. So, I’m in the future. Okay.” Harry announced hand drifting to run through his messy hair in what was definitely a nervous gesture as his eyes turned to his look alike. “So, what? You’re like my- my son or something?” Harry asked hesitantly, although that definitely didn’t make sense. Harry was damn sure he didn’t have a kid back where he was from and this guy looked a hell of a lot older than fourteen.</p><p>“Uh what?” The blond guy responded sounding far less put together than Harry himself was. “I’m not- you’re not my father.” The blond blustered quickly.</p><p>Harry nodded his head in relief, hand sweeping through his hair once again. “Good. I- I didn’t think you could have been, I mean you’re too old. Even if this is the future.” Harry smiled ruefully looking to Fury who seemed to be staring at him with a calculating look Harry had seen on one too many faces in his life.</p><p>“Take a seat Rogers, I have some questions for you.” Fury instructed. He turned to face the others without seeing if Harry was going to comply. He gestured for them to take a seat at the conference table which they did almost immediately. Harry walked stiffly toward it, taking a seat as far from the others as he could. He let his head fall backwards, hand moving to cover exhausted, and aching eyes.</p><p>“Let’s get this over with.” Harry groaned after a moment, straightening himself in his seat.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><strong>A/N:</strong> <strong> Hi folks!
