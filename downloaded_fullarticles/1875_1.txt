  <span>The trail leading to Care of Magical Creatures was quite. It was about dinner time, and while most students were heading to the Great Hall for dinner. I was out looking for Barnaby. Nobody had seen him for most of the day, and I was starting to get worried. Start with the basics, where would the most likely place Barnaby would be? The obvious answer was the forest. If someone wanted to stay hidden they wouldn’t go to the first place people would think to look for them. But I was fairly confident that even if he wasn’t there, it’d give some sort of clue to  where he was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>The cobblestone path was rough in the dim light. Even after heading down for class year after year, the path felt unfamiliar. There was a cool breeze blowing from the lake, all of the trees swayed back and forth. Even if it wasn’t the Dark Forest, it was still daunting to be going into the woods at night. My cloak ruffled around my ankles as another breeze came through. The stone wall built to create a pen to keep the animals in, came into view. Behind me the castle loomed on top of the hill. Although I had come to view Hogwarts as my home, the site of the castle made me feel isolated and alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>A quick inhale, could barely be heard over the sound of the wind and the rustling of the forest. I was almost certain it was the sound of my own breathing, that was until it came again. I walked through the small gate of the pen, following the direction the sound came from. I waited for another breath, hoping to find the source of the sound. But what I heard wasn’t what I ever expected to hear. Nor was it something I ever want to hear again. It was the pained sound of someone crying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>I tried to follow the sound. I wanted to find whomever it was crying more than ever. Silently I walked through the forest, using only the moonlight that was flickering through the tree limbs as my guide. That’s when I found him, Barnaby. He was on the ground leaning against a tree, sobbing. My heart ached at the sight. I didn’t know what could make the strongest guy at Hogwarts dissolved into tears. And although he clearly wanted to be alone, I took the opportunity to approach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“B?” I asked, my voice quivering more than I thought it would. “Barnaby?” I took a step towards him, trying to get closer. He looked up, his piercing green eyes squinting thought the darkness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Please just go away,” he said. His voice was raspy, as if he’d been crying for hours. Part of me wanted to obey his request, to just let him be. But a more dominant part couldn’t allow that to happen. As softly as I could, I approached through the darkness. Up close it was clear Barnaby had been outside most of the day. His black pants were covered in mud, his sweater was ripped in various spots, his Slytherin tie was gone entirely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>I knelt down beside him, the concern was impossible to hide my voice. “Barnaby what happened to you,” I asked. “Are you hurt.” He shook his head, one of his tears splattering against my hand in the process. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“What happened?” I knew it wasn’t my place to ask, but someone had to. “You weren’t in Potions, History of Magic, or Defense Against the Dark Arts. No one has seen you since breakfast. I was worried.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked up at me, his eyes like emeralds sparkled from the moisture. He blinked away tears, and tried to sound more positive. “I’m fine,” he cleared his  throat. “Really I am.” I pulled him toward me, wrapping my arms around him. I couldn’t fix whatever was bothering him and it was clear he didn’t want to speak about it, but I sure as hell wasn’t going to let him feel alone in the world. After everything with my brother, and all of the taunting I had received, because of  who he was. I knew better than a lot of people what it felt like to feel alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Barnaby was tense under my grasp, as if he didn’t know what to do. I rubbed circles on his back, trying to be as comforting as possible. “You don’t always have to be the strong one B. It’s okay to be vulnerable sometimes.” Barnaby wrapped his arms around me, holding on to me as if he was clinging to a lifesaver in the middle of the ocean. For all I knew he had been drowning in his own thoughts all day, and I wanted to be his source of solace. He cried into my shoulder, and I just held him. He didn’t say anything, and I didn’t push. I was just there for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” he whispered into my chest after his sobs finally had died away. I continued to rub his back, reassuring him that he was alright. “That’s the problem,” he said looking up to my face. “When you’re the strongest, no one ever offers you any help. Or asks if you’re okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay,” I said softly, as if trying not to spook a wild animal. He shook his head no again, but this time he held up a crumpled piece of parchment to me that I hadn’t noticed him holding earlier. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I took the paper and withdrew my wand from my cloak pocket. Barnaby shifted away, leaning back against the tree as I cast the lumos charm. A blinding light erupted from the tip of my wand, I blinked trying to adjust to the change. I unfolded the parchment, that had clearly be opened and closed, folded and unfolded over and over again earlier that day. It was a very legal looking letter addressed to Barnaby from the Ministry of Magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dear Mr. Barnaby Lee,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We at the Ministry would like to extend our deepest apologies in informing you of the passing of your father today in his prison cell in Azkaban. His body can be collected-</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>I couldn’t read anymore, I folded the letter back up. Barnaby’s face was pained, I extinguished my wand to give him some privacy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I received that at breakfast,” he said his voice stronger than I would have thought it could be given the circumstances.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so sorry about your father Barnaby.” I said, taking a seat beside him, leaning against the tree. “You shouldn’t have had to find out this way,” my voice was angrier than I could help. “Someone should have had the decency to tell you in person.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I felt him shrug next to me, “I’m use to the short end of the stick.” His voice wasn’t angry or upset, but rather hollow, as if he had already accepted getting fucked over in life. “He wasn’t all bad you know,” Barnaby said with more of an upbeat reflective tone. “When I was younger he and my mum bought me a pet Kneazle for my birthday.” It almost sounded as if he was smiling, I was tempted to glance over in the dim light to see if it were true. But I didn’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Voldemort,” Barnaby said his name, something most wizards wouldn’t do. “He came over to our house,” the upbeat tone entirely gone from his voice. “He was meeting with my parents. My Kneazle was laying on the chair. It all happened so fast, I was powerless to do anything. He drowned my Kneazle before my eyes. That was the first time I had ever seen my father look anything close to appalled at the actions of the dark lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I wanted to say something comforting. But I didn’t know what to say. Nothing I could say would make it better. Instead of fumbling with words I took his hand in mine and gave it an encouraging squeeze, one Barnaby returned. The amount of times I wanted to touch Barnaby, to hold his hand, to hug him, to kiss him was tremendous. It had never been easier to do than in that moment. Maybe it was because there was no intent or alterior motive behind the action. It was just to comfort him. My happiest memory at Hogwarts had been going to the Celestial Dance with Barnaby, and even though nothing might ever happen romantically between us. I knew I wanted to help him through this trying time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father had always taught me to be strong, that to be weak was to be inferior,” Barnaby said. “That night was the only night my father didn’t condemn me for crying. In fact he hugged me later that night in my room.” Barnaby leaned his head against my shoulder, and I leaned my head on top of his. “I know he did some bad things, I know he was a Death Eater. But he was still my father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to justify your sadness. It’s okay to be sad, and to cry,” I said trying to sound strong for him. He so often was the strong one, and now it was time to be there for him. To make him feel less alone. “Regardless of what he did. He will always be your father. And he will always love you.” I kissed the top of Barnaby’s head, wrapping my arm around him, his face was in the crook of my neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I felt so alone today,” he murmured. “Like there was no one I could talk to. I’m supposed to be the strong one,” he said with a sad intensity. “No one is supposed to see me fall, or weak.” I rubbed his back, Barnaby was practically sitting in my lap at this point.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You,” I cupped his face with my hand and wiped away a tear with my thumb. “Never have to pretend to be strong around me. I won’t judge you for needing let someone else take the weight of the world from your shoulders. Trust me, I know it can be a lot to bear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you,” he said softly. My heart leaped in my chest, even if it was just a platonic love it made me happier than words can describe just to hear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you too, Barnaby,” I said wrapping my arms around him. Covering us both with my cloke, as another cool breeze passed through the trees. I don’t know how long we sat like that before we both passed out in the forest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>We were found a few hours later by Professor Kettleburn, who was out looking for the escaped Chimera. Although embarrassed to found in such a intimate position, neither of us were rushing to pull apart from each other when Kettleburn found us. He ushered us on our way. As we left, on the way back up to the castle Barnaby’s hand never left mine. I stroked his hand with my thumb as we entered the castle. We walked in a comfortable silence, the only sound being that of our steps. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The dungeon was cool, as we quickly crossed into the Slytherin Common room. By this point the fire was dead and the common room deserted, everyone had already gone off to bed. Barnaby lead us to the dormitory, both of us quietly stripped out of our dirty clothes and into pajamas. I couldn’t help but steal a glance at Barnaby’s chest in the dim light. He was muscular and sculpted like the statue of a god. I sat on the edge of my bed watching him, as he slipped the letter from today into his trunk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He walked over towards me and took my hand in his, before leaning in close to whisper in my ear. “I want you to sleep with me tonight,” he whispered softly, his lips practically on my ear. “I want you to hold me as I drift to sleep.” I knew it was a terrible idea. There were three other guys that we shared the dormitory with, what would they say tomorrow morning? But part of me didn’t care what they would say, especially if Barnaby wouldn’t care. The rest of me wanted to lay with him. To comfort him all night long. To just hold him in my arms, and let him know he’s not alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I allowed Barnaby to pull my towards his four post bed. He slipped under the cover’s pulling closed the curtains on one side. I slid in behind him and closed the other curtain. Barnaby was warm, his muscular back pressed into my front as I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him close. The comfort of his bed was like a cloud compared to the forest floor. I wasn’t going to complain about being uncomfortable before and risk ending the night. But now in Barnaby’s bed, his chest rising and falling, his body a perfect fit with mine like a puzzle piece. I was home with Barnaby. Holding him felt right. And because of that I had the urge to protect him, he didn’t have to be the strong one, not around me anyways. He was allowed to let himself be open and vulnerable. I breathed in his scent, recording it to memory. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I whispered in his ear, “I love you,” mostly for myself. I didn’t expect him to roll over and kiss me. His lips were warm and soft, like how I imagined and hoped they would be like. The kiss wasn’t long or passionate, but it was real.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you too,” he whispered back to me. Before curling into my chest and falling asleep. I watched him sleep, I watched his chest rise and fall with his breathes, I watched the way his lips moved as if trying to speak. I watched him in his most vulnerable and open version of himself, because he let me in. He let me see this version of himself. It just made me love him more. </span>
