<h2>Chapter 1</h2><p dir="ltr">Harry had only been at the Dursley’s for a few days before he found himself wanting to leave again. His Aunt and Uncle weren’t as bad as they had been in previous years, but Harry was still reeling from Sirius’ death and the middle of muggle Surrey was the last place he wanted to be. It didn’t help that despite Dudley no longer bothering him, he still didn’t stop his friends from bothering Harry either.</p><p>At least he was able to get letters from Ron and Hermione again. Not that they actually said much of anything interesting. Nothing that cut through the fog that had filled his head since Sirius’ death- nothing that had made him feel. To say his godfather’s death was hitting him hard would be an understatement. He alternated between not being able to sleep and sleeping away entire days. Even when he was out of bed, he felt lethargic, like there was a force physically pulling him down. </p><p>To combat this, he went to the park. It wasn’t a very big park, nor a particularly interesting one. But it was better than staring at the walls of his bedroom for hours at a time, so every morning he would get up and make the short trek to the park, where he would sit on one of the too small swings and contemplate his existence. The downside of this was of course that Dudley’s friends always knew where to find him when they felt like bothering him.</p>
<h2> </h2><p>“Hey four eyes!” Harry sighed and looked up at the boys approaching him. He noticed that Dudley hung back from the rest, though he made no move to stop them either. Just another day in paradise. </p><p>“I have a name you know.”</p><p>“Is it stupid?” </p><p> Harry wrinkled his nose at the boy. He still couldn’t remember any of their names, even after ten years of knowing the arses. “Truly you are a paragon of wit.”</p><p>“You think you’re better than us?”</p><p>“I think I'm tired of your pathetic attempts at bullying me, and would very much like to be left alone.” </p><p>            The tallest boy of the lot spat on him and the others laughed, before Dudley pulled them away with a glance at Harry that he would almost have interpreted as apologetic if it weren’t his cousin. After they had finally started in the opposite direction, Harry let his disgust show and wiped the spit off of his face with his sweatshirt sleeve. </p>
<h2> </h2><p>“Well that was rude. Are all muggles like that?” He jumped a bit and turned to see none other than Theodore Nott. Harry blinked a couple times as he registered the fact that one of his classmates, one of his pureblood classmates, was sitting next to him, on a tiny swing in a neighborhood park in the middle of muggle Surrey.</p><p>“Surprising me was rude. Are all wizards like that?” </p><p>             Theo grinned. “Touche,” he paused. “Seriously, what’s his deal? Because this may be one of my first times in the muggle world, but just about everyone else I’ve met has been pretty alright.”</p><p>“Dudley’s a dick. Well, his friends are anyway. He’s been weird recently.” Harry watched his cousin walk away with no small amount of confusion. </p><p>“Right. Well Potter, since I have no idea where I am, and I have to be home in time for dinner, you’re going to help me find my way home.” </p><p>            Harry turned his attention back to Theo. He didn’t know much about him, other than that he was in Slytherin, and wasn’t one of Malfoy’s worshippers. He wondered if that was for good reasons or bad ones. He wondered if he would ever get to just be a normal fifteen year old kid and not have to question the intentions of every cute classmate that demanded his help. </p><p>“And why should I do that?”</p><p>“Because you’re a hero, and I’m in distress?”</p><p>            Harry’s lips quirked into a smile against his will. “Why were you out here in the first place instead of… wherever it is you rich purebloods go during the holidays.”</p><p>“My father doesn’t believe in the Holidays, so rather than spending yet another year moping around the manor, I thought I’d get to know my neighborhood. It’s not like I could go anywhere else, not with the trace still on me.” Theo shrugged. “So when did you start talking like that, with them?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“<em> A paragon of wit </em>, I’ve gone to school with you every day for five years and never heard you use that sort of vocabulary. You waxed almost poetic there Potter.” </p><p>            Harry snorted and stood up. “I hang out with Hermione Granger all the time. It had to have rubbed off on me eventually. Besides, I reckon you lose the dramatic effect if you use it all the time.”</p><p>“Fair.” They walked in silence for a moment. Harry really hoped they were going the right direction, because he didn’t actually have a clue where Theo lived.</p><p>“I didn’t know there was a magical community in Surrey?” he asked Theo tentatively. Anything to fill the silence.</p><p>“There’s not really. As far as I know, my family are the only ones in the area. Well, except you I guess. And I’m not even sure we count as a magical community. It’s just dad and I. But that’s not unusual really. If you look for it, there’s always at least one old family in any given area. It was a precaution of sorts, back in the middle ages. The old families were responsible for caring for the magical people in their district, and the manors would act as a sort of stronghold whenever they were in danger.” </p><p>            Harry stared at him. “Is that what the whole Sacred Twenty Eight thing is all about?”</p><p>            Theo nodded “That’s what it was supposed to be about anyway. But the problem is that a lot of them, like my family for instance, lost a large portion of their population as people started moving closer to London to be near Diagon Alley. They kept the sense of superiority, without all of the responsibility.” </p><p>            Harry stopped walking and stared at him. “I doubt all this is common knowledge, so how do you know all this?”</p><p>“Well, the whole Sacred Twenty Eight thing is sort of a misnomer. It was actually written by my grandfather in the 30’s. Originally, there were actually somewhere between thirty and thirty nine lords- depending on what time period you look at- one for each of the traditional counties. When my grandfather wrote the so-called Pureblood Directory, he had to trace the genealogies of all of the original lords to do so. You’re one of them actually.”</p><p>“Huh. I wonder what county we were in charge of?”</p><p>“Well, if my research is to be believed, it would have been Gloucestershire. Which is interesting, because Glouchester was the muggle seat of power in the early 11th century.”</p><p>“I’d have thought that yours would have been Nottinghamshire.” Harry responded with a small grin. </p><p>“Ha bloody ha. You’re so funny Potter.”</p><p>“Hang on Nott. Let's stop here for a moment.”  Harry stopped in front of a little corner store, suddenly craving anything with sugar. </p><p>“Why?” Theo asked curiously. </p><p>“Why not?” was Harry’s response. “Come on, I’ll pay.”</p><p>           He pushed the door open and held it for Theo. It wasn’t a very big store, but it had twinkies and energy drinks, which was all Harry needed in life really. Theo eyed everything with a critical eye before settling on a bottle of water. Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed a package of ding dongs and a fanta. Everyone liked orange soda right? He paid for everything and dug through the bag to find the fanta, handing it to Theo as they exited the store. </p><p>“What’s this?” Theo asked, taking it.</p><p>“Orange soda. You don’t have to drink it if you don’t like it, but I thought you might want to try it if you’re serious about learning more about muggle stuff.” </p><p>“Oh.” He stared at it for another minute before finally cracking it open and trying it. “What the fuck? Why is it fizzy?” Theo stared at the bottle like it offended him. Harry laughed. </p><p>“That’s what soda is. Do you not like it?”</p><p>“I didn’t say that.” Theo took another drink of the soda and started leading them down the street, confirming what Harry had already known; Theo knew exactly how to get home, and had just wanted company. An hour ago, that would have infuriated him. Now, he just thought it was amusing. </p><p>They talked about a little bit of everything as they walked, Harry occasionally stopping to pass out one of his snacks, or let Theo try his energy drink. He hadn’t liked the energy drink. </p><p>They talked about what was different about their childhoods. Harry in his cupboard, Theo in his lonely mansion. Harry was surprised to discover that it didn’t hurt to talk about his cupboard anymore. If anything, he gave him fond memories. It was the first place that was his after all. </p><p>They talked about the differences between magical and muggle sports, and Harry was surprised to discover that Theo didn’t like quidditch at all, but had enjoyed watching some kids playing football in the park. Harry personally thought he was mad. How did football even come close to comparing to the sheer exuberance that came from looking over the world from a broom? </p><p>“Brooms are uncomfortable Potter, I don’t know how you haven’t figured that out yet. I don’t particularly care to fly around on a death trap at all. Let alone one that doesn’t even have the decency to be comfortable.” That had turned into a debate over what household items would make a more comfortable riding experience but still allow you to play the game properly.</p><p>They talked about everything but the war.</p><p>Harry had never been this comfortable talking to someone new before. Theo just sort of understood when he said that he didn’t like to feel like he was trapped, which was why he loves Quidditch so much. But at the same time, even the vastness of the Great Hall would sometimes bother him, and he’d have to take his dinner back to his room to eat in the safety of his curtained bed. Harry understood when Theo told him that the first spell he had ever mastered was silencio, because he would sometimes have to put up silencing charms because any sound at all was too much after living practically alone for most of his life. </p><p>Not even Ron and Hermione had clicked with him the way he seemed to click with Theo. And with everything he explained, and everything he didn’t have to, Harry was forced to come to the uncomfortable realization that Theo might now know more about him than anyone else. </p><p>Nothing important of course, he doubted Theo could do anything with the knowledge that Harry’s favorite class was Defense against the Dark Arts. Just like he could do nothing with the knowledge that Theo adored McGonagall, and frequently asked her for extra spells to practice.</p><p>A glance over at Theo had confirmed that he seemed to feel the same.</p>
<h2> </h2><p>They reached the bottom of Theo’s unreasonably long drive and Harry discovered that he didn’t want whatever this moment with Theo was to end; but at the same time, it was terrifying. It was terrifying to know that Theo now looked at him and saw <em> him </em>, not the savior of the wizarding world. There was something terrible and exhilarating about being able to say the same when he looked at Theo. </p><p>“We should hang out again. This was... fun.” The word didn’t seem to fit, but Harry understood what he meant. He hated that he understood what he meant.</p><p>“Tell me Theodore. Why should I trust you?” Harry somehow managed to keep the words from coming out as a beg. He needed to know that he could trust him. He needed to know he wasn’t the only one who had felt that click; like he’d just found everything he’d never even thought to try and find.</p><p>“Because you’re as bored and lonely as I am. Because I have never given you any reason not to. Because the Dark Lord is back and you’re going to need every ally you can get. Because my dad has gone insane and you’re the only person who might believe that I’m not evil.” </p><p>            Harry eyed him suspiciously. He wanted to believe that Theo was everything he said, that he was honest and smart and brave and just enough of an asshole that Harry could tell exactly when he was being genuine. Like now.</p><p>“Nott…”</p><p>“I don’t know how I could possibly prove it to you Potter, I don’t know anything worth telling you about my dad or his plans, and I can’t do anything even remotely magical for another three months. So tell me what to do and I’ll do it, but Merlin Potter, stop treating me like the enemy.” </p><p>           Harry hadn’t thought of him as an enemy since before they had stopped at the corner store. He continued to watch him critically. Theo was right of course, he had done nothing to imply that he might be a threat, other than to be related to a death eater. But Harry had trusted so many people that let him down. Hell, even his best friends, as much as he loved them, had both left them for their own petty squabbles before.</p><p>“I want to trust you Nott. I do. But- but the world is going to shit, and the last thing I need is someone else who only wants to be friends because I’m famous and they think that being my friend somehow grants them immunity from evil. And it seems like everyone nowadays wants to kill me.” </p><p>            Theo snorted.  “Being your friend is more likely to get people in trouble than grant them immunity. Anyone who has spent any amount of time watching you knows that much Potter.” </p><p>“Are you saying you watch me Nott?” </p><p>            Theo’s cheeks colored slightly as he muttered out a negative. It was cute. Harry wasn’t sure what was coming over him. Sure, he had known for a while that he was at least somewhat interested in guys, but he had always thought it was in a more general sense, like he found them attractive, but never thought he would actually fancy one. Theodore Nott seemed to be the exception to a lot of rules. </p><p>“Alright. I’ll give you a shot. But I’ll warn you now, I tend to make a habit of getting my friends into dangerous situations.” Theo grinned brightly and Harry was momentarily weakened. Merlin help him, he had only really known Theo for a few hours. </p><p>“I look forward to it Potter.” Somehow the name didn’t fit right anymore.</p><p>“If we’re going to be friends, you can call me Harry.” Theo’s lips quirked into a smile</p><p>“Alright, call me Theo.”</p>
