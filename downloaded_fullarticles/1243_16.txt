    <p>Harry James Potter-Fell, born Harry James Potter, didn't mean to make friends with the snake in his Aunt's garden. He really didn't, but the Snake was nice. Nicer than anyone else the nine-year-old had met that he could remember, anyway. Plus the Snake like him too.</p>

Anthony J. Crowley, also known as Crowley, really hadn't meant to befriend the young wizard he met in Surrey. He really hadn't but the poor boy was severely malnourished, had visible signs( Well visible to occult and celestial beings) of abuse, and an overwhelming ominous power dripping from a lighting bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. Still, he really hadn't known what befriending this boy would lead him to do.</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
Hermoine Jane Granger-Lokid√≥ttir, once known as Hermoine Jane Granger didn't mean to be adopted by Loki. It kinda just happened, just like most things in her life. For inestest the time her step-father had shot across the room after a particularly bad beating. Or the time she made her self disappear when he had flown into a drunken rage.</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
Gabriel really didn't plan on meddling on wizarding affairs. After that last time had gone for no better expression, pear-shaped( that was just about 19-20 years ago with a quartet of his followers) and yet he still had. It really wasn't his fault. The poor girl was being abused by her step-father and her mother. The poor girl started following him after her birth-father had died and well he really couldn't help it.</p>
