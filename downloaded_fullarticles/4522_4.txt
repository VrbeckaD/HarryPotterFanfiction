It will have Harry's and Draco's POV and I will mention the person's name as well. Harry and Draco might seem OO character. It is an alternate universe. No Voldemort. No war.

  <strong>Harry</strong>
</p><p>Sunlight that streams in my room through the window awakens me from my sleep and I yawn before rubbing my eyes and closing them again in a last attempt to sleep for some more time. A couple of minutes later, I realize that there is no point of trying to sleep again and blink my eyes open, staring at the ceiling above me.</p><p>"Master Harry." I almost jump in surprise when Dobby speaks out of nowhere and look at him before speaking quietly, "Please knock before entering my room."</p><p>"Yes. Master Harry. Mistress Lily is being requesting your presence at the breakfast table." Dobby squeaks, his ear bobbing up and down and his eyes wide.</p><p>"Tell her that I am not hungry." I mutter and sit up, my back against the head board.</p><p>"But, master Harry-"</p><p>I cut him off with a firm, "Please leave Dobby. I am not hungry." He nods and disappears from my sight. I sigh and stare outside the window. The day is nice and sunny. After a long time, it's not raining and so I get out of my bed and walk towards my balcony after putting my glasses on. I am still in just my pajamas and the cool breeze feels good on my bare chest.</p><p>It brings memories of something else that had felt heavenly in the forefront of my mind and I breathe deeply before expelling the thoughts. It was just a mistake and I really, really need a girlfriend. Perhaps I should accept Ginny's proposal. She is a nice girl and has had a crush on me ever since... ever since she laid her eyes on me really.</p><p>A week is still left until the school opens and it is getting harder for me to ignore it. He was just so- I close my eyes as the overwhelming feeling of his lips on mine makes a comeback and I can't help but remember how it had felt to have his body pressed against mine.</p><p>I am not gay. Just because I have never had a girlfriend, it doesn't mean that I am gay. It just means that I am not ready for anyone yet. It was a mistake and perhaps too much alcohol had made me believe that he was a girl. There is no other explanation for this.</p><p>"Harry." Mum calls and I turn around. She is inside my room in her dress robes. It's not a surprise. This is her routine. She is a busy woman and I am sure she has to leave in a few minutes. Father had left for a business trip a week back so I am mostly alone. I gaze at people walking and laughing on the street to pass time when I am not studying or reading.</p><p>"Yes." I reply and move inside.</p><p>"You didn't have dinner yesterday and you didn't even have your breakfast today. What's the matter?" She asks me and I am surprised that she remembers.</p><p>"I am not hungry." I shrug and settle down on the edge of my bed, staring at the floor, my hands joined between my parted knees. It's too early to have this discussion. I don't want to talk to her about it.</p><p>"Harry, if there's something you need to tell me, please don't hesitate." She whispers and I nod.</p><p>She continues, "Actually, there is something I need to tell you."</p><p>I look questioningly at her and she replies, "Malfoys are leaving for a trip to the Bahamas for the remainder of Draco's summer vacation so he will be staying here until Hogwarts starts. He will arrive in half an hour."</p><p>I stare at her, stunned. The shock wears off and is replaced by panic.</p><p>"What... why is he staying here?" I ask, my voice a little rushed due to the alarm I am feeling.</p><p>"His mother requested me. I couldn't deny and he will live at Hogwarts after your school starts until his parents return." Mother mutters, shrugging carelessly and I stare at her.</p><p>"I don't want him to stay here. He is a git. You can't expect me to tolerate him during my holidays." I protest, my hands clenched on my pajamas and she replies after settling down on a chair, "You don't have any friends Harry. You don't talk to anyone. You don't go anywhere and when you do talk, it's to argue with Draco. You don't even have a girlfriend. You should mingle with people."</p><p>"Hmmmm." I mutter noncommittaly and get up to return to my balcony.</p><p>"Harry." Mum calls me and I ignore her, instead placing my hands on the railing and looking outside.</p><p>She leaves a second later and I mutter, "Fuck." I don't want him anywhere near me. At Hogwarts, it would be easy to just disappear but here at my own house, it's going to be impossible to ignore him.</p><p>I will have to call Ginny for a while so that he understands that I am not interested in him like that. Having taken the decision, I walk inside and firecall Ginny and ask her to come in about forty minutes. She agrees and I walk inside my bathroom to take a shower.</p><p>XXXX</p><p>
  <strong>Draco</strong>
</p><p>"I don't understand why you chose to stay with them?" Mother asks me. We are standing at the door of their manor and I shrug carelessly, choosing not to answer her. I can't answer truthfully anyways. She doesn't know about my reality and I don't want her to know until I get a job for myself.</p><p>"Draco. I am talking to you. Your father was asking as well. We thought that you despise their son."</p><p>"Can I ring the bell mother or do you want to spend a while asking me things I won't answer." I reply bluntly and she sighs.</p><p>"Draco... don't be like that darling. We are worried for you."</p><p>"Don't be. Enjoy your trip. I will enjoy my vacations. I don't need you to hover around me all the time." I mutter and she sighs again. Instead of saying anything else, she just rings the bell and the door is opened by an elf.</p><p>"Mistress Lily is being in the sitting room. Please come in." He mutters and I walk in, dragging my trunk behind me. Mother settles down opposite Mrs. Potter and they start talking to each other. I tune them out. My eyes are searching for him. Ever since I have tasted his lips, I have lost interest in others. He is still living in the land of denial and perhaps wants to spend his life in it. But I want him. It's as easy as that. His lips were delicious. He smelled good and he felt nice.</p><p>That day, Blaise had spiked Harry's drinks and he had kissed me. He had been the one to initiate it and he had also been the one to end it. He had freaked out and I have not been able to get him out of my mind ever since.</p><p>"Draco dear." Mrs. Potter whispers and I ask her, "Where is Harry?"</p><p>"Oh!" She asks, her eyebrows raised in surprise, "He must be in his room. Dobby will show yours to you. Feel at home."</p><p>"Thank you." I reply graciously and smile at her before getting up and following Dobby. He is no-where to be seen and I wonder where he is. I wish I could kiss him again.</p><p>"This is being your room, Master Draco." Dobby squeaks and I look at the elf, "Which one is Harry's?"</p><p>"The room next to yours." The elf mutters and looks at the room next to mine. I nod and the elf leaves me alone. I walk inside the room and sit down on the bed, wondering why I had to choose him. I have fucked many boys in the past but no-one has really caught my fancy. Harry has been more of a nemesis to me ever since I have known him. We have always either quarreled orÂ ignored each other.</p><p>I had not expected him to be gay. It had been more of a shock for me.</p><p>I had been washing my hands in the restroom and he had just finished washing his hands when he looked at me with drunk eyes. Before I knew it, he had pulled me by my collar and was kissing me passionately, his hands wrapped tightly around my forearms. I had pushed him against the wall and had given as good as I got. But then, just after a few minutes, he had realized what he was doing and had shoved me away before stumbling out of the restroom. I had stayed there, on the floor and had touched my lips trying to figure out if it had even happened.</p><p>I sigh and try to will my erection away. I wonder how I am going to stay away from him while I try to make him realize that being gay is not equivalent to being abnormal.</p><p>XXXX</p><p>Please review.</p>
