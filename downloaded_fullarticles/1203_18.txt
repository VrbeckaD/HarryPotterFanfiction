    <p>On any given day over the summer holidays before her fourteen-year-old daughter’s fourth year at magical boarding school, Helen Granger could expect to find Hermione in her room studying the course material, composing missives to her little friends, or partaking in rituals Helen had never seen the girl give a lick of attention to in the past: namely, painting her nails or lounging about in face masks whilst braiding or twisting her hair with varying degrees of success.</p><p>Helen could admit to herself that she’d been a bit remiss in teaching her daughter variety in terms of hairstyles— other than the obligatory overnight twist out, nothing fancy— because she was simply too busy.  She ran a dentistry practice, and though Richard did a lot, the lion’s share of the administrative work usually fell upon Helen.  It was no mystery why Hermione felt the need to take it upon herself to explore her hair in a way that Helen had never made time to explore with her.</p><p>There was also a marked change in how they interacted.</p><p>Hermione had always been an independent girl, but whereas before she might have predominantly displayed and expressed the mannerisms of a child, that summer she began to walk, talk and act like a young woman.  There was a secret hiding behind her eyes that straightened her back and thrust her chin forward, that pulled at the corners of her lips and bunched her cheeks.  It was startling; Helen wasn’t quite sure if she liked the fact that her baby was growing up so fast.</p><p>When Hermione came to her with a request that smacked less of permission and more of courtesy, Helen was thrown for a loop.</p><p>“Mum, Ron’s dad got us all tickets for the Quidditch Cup,” said her daughter over dinner one evening toward the end of summer.  Her skin glowed with dewy health, and her curls were shiny, defined, and up in space buns.</p><p>Richard had retired early on account of a bad headache.  Helen considered joining him.</p><p>Hermione continued determinedly, fork in the air, “I was thinking that I could take the Knight Bus to Ottery St. Catchpole and stay the weekend, because we have to get up really early to make the Portkey the night before the Cup and I don’t want to impose right when everyone’s running around for last minute preparations— ”</p><p>“Wait, wait,” Helen interrupted, eyes wide and mouth twisted. “Who said you could go to this— what did you call it?”</p><p>“Quidditch Cup,” Hermione supplied helpfully.</p><p>“Yes, that! I don’t recall signing off on this,” Helen pointed out. “I don’t mind you hanging out with your friends, but I expect some sort of notice, young lady.”</p><p>Her daughter’s shoulders lost a bit of their uprightness, and she had the decency to look abashed. “Right, yes, of course.  Sorry, mum.”</p><p>Helen regarded her levelly for a moment. “When did you plan on leaving?”</p><p>“This weekend,” said Hermione. “Friday evening.”</p><p>After thinking it over, Helen decided it was of no use trying to convince her daughter to stay for the rest of holiday now that she’d already made up her mind.  There was nothing to offer up as an excuse for her not to go— not that Helen had ever been the type to resort to tricks to get her daughter to do what she wanted, but it always seemed Hermione never wanted to stay with her parents all of break, always in a rush to leave as soon as her friends were available to have her.  </p><p>Helen wondered if, in the future, they would lose her to the Wizarding World entirely because they were simply unable to keep her interest in competition with turning rats into teacups and whatever else.  The thought saddened and frustrated her deeply, but Helen knew that Hermione wasn’t the type to purposefully cast people away when they were no longer interesting; she wasn’t like that, didn’t take people for granted that way.  Helen just had to have faith that even if she pursued a career and family in the magical world, Hermione would always come back to them in the important moments.  </p><p>After all, she was their daughter.  That would never change.</p><p> </p><p>When Hermione came to the Burrow the evening before the World Cup, Ginny Weasley was expecting the same bookish, buck-toothed know-it-all of which she’d grown fond.  She figured they all were; after all, only about three months had lapsed between them last seeing each other, and what could change so drastically in three months?</p><p>Turns out: a lot.</p><p>With the exception of one glaring outlier, Ginny wasn’t easily flustered by anyone or anything.  On the contrary, she was rather bold; the gutsiest of her friends and one of the most outspoken girls in her year, possibly due to having as many annoying elder brothers who’d shushed her for as long as they had.  But nothing could have prepared her— or evidently anyone else who caught a glimpse of their muggleborn guest—  for Hermione’s arrival.</p><p>Ginny sat on the staircase with her chin on her hand and watched her father traverse the sitting room, a familiar, well-maintained leather trunk levitating along behind him.  At an angle from the doorway, Ginny saw first a red trainer caked with mud step through, and then one long, toned brown leg, and then the rest of her.  She was in denim shorts— shorts— that admittedly weren’t anywhere near scandalous, but would nonetheless raise Molly Weasley’s hackles just a tad, and a light green t-shirt that clung to the new swells of curves denoting her developing hips, thighs and— Ginny glanced at her own self-consciously— breasts.  Her curly hair looked lovely up in a knot atop her head, and her face glowed like the sun had earlier that summer afternoon.  Dangling from her elbow was a woven, linen-lined basket with a plump, bottle-shaped orange tail sticking out.</p><p>Ginny realized her hand was cramping from how hard her jaw wanted to drop and forced herself to relax.  This was her friend, or her brother’s friend and her acquaintance, at the very least.  She could put aside her shock and greet her with genuine warmth like she’d planned to.</p><p>Her mother beat her to the punch, bustling out of the kitchen and wiping her hands on her apron.  If she had any sort of opinion about Hermione’s attire, she hid it well.  “Hermione, dear, it’s lovely to see you!”</p><p>The fourteen-year-old was squeezed into a bear hug tight enough to rid her of her tonsils.  Hermione put Crookshanks down in time and took it in stride, returning the greeting with aplomb.  </p><p>“Have you had dinner? I’m only just finishing up, it’ll be ready in ten.”</p><p>“Can I help with anything?” Hermione asked, just a hair left of timidly.  Mum waved her off, though she seemed pleased by the gesture.</p><p>“Ginny! Go tell your brothers dinner’s almost ready.”</p><p>Ginny sighed.</p><p>Hermione’s eyes lit on her, still poised awkwardly with one foot on the last stair step.  Ginny waved.</p><p>“Hello, Ginny,” the Goddess Hermione beamed.</p><p>Ginny closed the distance between them, and they briefly embraced; when they pulled apart, the younger girl basked in the light of the elder’s grin, mesmerized. </p><p>“How have you been?”</p><p>“Oh, you know,” Ginny replied faintly, feeling very small and boyish. “I— same old, same old.  You?”</p><p>Hermione smiled. “Same old, same old.”</p><p>Ginny shook her head in disbelief, but managed a sensible enough response. “I think Ron’s upstairs.  If not, check the orchard.”</p><p>“Noted.”</p><p>“Oh,” Ginny touched her arm before she could walk away, “Watch out for Fred and George.  And Percy.  They’ve all been their own brand of crazy lately.”</p><p>The Wizard Wheezes were a hell of a laugh when Ginny wasn’t the butt of the joke.  Granted, Ron bore the brunt of the madness, but they’d all suffered their fair share of misfortunes when Fred and George needed test subjects.  Ginny felt for their plight— especially after their mother thoroughly put a wrench their business ventures— but not enough to be a canary for an hour.  Luckily, the twins seemed to take her threats a bit more seriously than Ron’s and it had been smooth sailing since.</p><p>On the flip side of things, Ginny wondered if Hermione would actually take some academic interest in Percy’s report on cauldron bottom thickness.  She seemed the most likely to not fall asleep standing up at the mere mention of it.</p><p>Hermione seemed a tad unnerved by the warning, but shook it off after a second and nodded gratefully before making her way toward the stairs, Crookshanks hot on her heels.  Ginny forced her eyes away from her round bum, bewildered at herself for staring.</p><p>And then Ginny came to her senses and scrambled to follow the older girl, eager to see Ron’s face when he slapped eyes on the New Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>The Burrow was almost exactly like Harry remembered it: warm and crooked and alive with magic that had seeped into the walls and floorboards.  It also smelled amazing.  The only things Harry didn’t recognize were the two men sitting at the kitchen table, but by their hair alone, he knew they must be the two eldest Weasley brothers, Bill and Charlie.</p><p>"How're you doing, Harry?" said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers. </p><p>This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.</p><p>Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry's hand. Bill came as something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was - there was no other word for it - cool. He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. Bill's clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert, except that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide.</p><p>They both seemed to find the twins’ prank as funny as the rest of them did, which made Harry like them better than Percy, already.</p><p>A part of Harry— a very small part, mind— felt a tiny dash of sympathy for his cousin at having a tongue that grew to be over four feet long and just about as heavy as a tongue that size would be; but a much larger part of him thought the incident barely managed to scrape the surface in terms of repentance for the childhood he’d had to endure at the business end of Dudley’s ham-fisted terror.  The sight of the overweight boy coughing, spluttering and hacking as he tried and failed to stuff the lolling pink muscle back into his mouth was probably enough of a laugh to produce a Patronus three times over.</p><p>Thus, he felt Mr. Weasley’s anger at Fred and George for instigating the whole incident— though understandable— was somewhat misplaced.  Unfortunately, things seemed to escalate when Mrs. Weasley came to investigate the ruckus, as they usually did following her interference in any given scuffle.  Two girls appeared in the doorway to the kitchen in the middle of the fast-paced conflict that Harry had missed so keenly at his relatives’ house, and they were familiar, too.</p><p>One was small and red-haired; Ginny, Ron’s younger sister.  The other was… well…</p><p>Harry knew that it was his other best friend, Hermione, but she looked different.  Her hair wasn’t bushy like he’d previously known it to be, but styled in big, luscious, defined curls that he could probably count if he felt inclined to do so.  The shirt she was wearing clung to… everything… and her denim skirt fell to just below mid-thigh.  Her front teeth were still large, but they were between lips that glistened with gloss.  Harry glanced at Ginny, whose lips shone the same way.  They were girls.  Girls like the kind on the telly that wore makeup and strutted around shopping centers and chatted on their mobiles whilst chewing gum.</p><p>When they smiled at him, he took a whole four seconds to smile back, shocked out of sense.  When he finally did, Ginny went red and turned away to cover her mouth with her hand; he felt a hot spike of embarrassment, knowing she was likely laughing at him.</p><p>At least she didn’t seem so afraid of him anymore.  Ginny’s crush was the only uncomfortable thing about his last visit to the Burrow.</p><p>“Why don't you show Harry where he's sleeping, Ron?" said Hermione from the doorway.</p><p>"He knows where he's sleeping," said Ron, "in my room, he slept there last— ” </p><p>"We can all go," said Hermione pointedly.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh," said Ron, cottoning on. "Right."</p><p>"Yeah, we'll come too," said George.</p><p> </p><p>"You stay where you are!" snarled Mrs. Weasley.</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.  </p><p>Harry couldn’t help but glance at Hermione every so often, confused but fascinated.  He also had no say in whether his eyes followed the swish of Ginny’s fiery, pin-straight hair as it swung to the rhythm of her steps.  </p><p>He suddenly felt horribly unattractive in his overly-large t-shirt and baggy jeans, and self-consciously stuffed his hands as deep in his pockets as they would go so that his shirt was trapped to his body and wouldn’t be billowing everywhere.  He probably looked ridiculous.</p><p>“I hope your aunt and uncle weren’t too terrible to you this summer, Harry,” said Hermione. “I trust you got our food parcels?”</p><p>Harry latched onto the welcome reprieve from the racket inside his own head. “Those food parcels saved me from Dudley’s joke of a diet plan.  And, well… they haven’t really changed, but I suppose Sirius scared them into being civil.”</p><p>“I don’t doubt it,” Ron muttered, shuddering.</p><p>“He said he was sorry,” Harry said quickly.</p><p>Ron threw up his hands. “I know, I know… and I forgive him, given the circumstances.  But that doesn’t change the fact that the man is terrifying, mate.  Twelve years in prison doesn’t exactly make you a teddy bear.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t argue with that.</p><p>They filed into Ron’s small attic room.  It looked the same as it always had, with the rather noisy addition of a tiny owl, who Ron introduced grudgingly as Pigwidgeon, dubbed thus by Ginny.  Hermione and Ginny sat on the bed, and Harry followed Ron’s lead in finding a place on the floor.  Ron looked at the girls for a moment, nonplussed.</p><p>“Get lost, Ginny,” he demanded.</p><p>Ginny crossed her arms, unimpressed.  Hermione, too, seemed offended on the other girl’s behalf.</p><p>“She can stay, Ron.”</p><p>Such finality.  Such command.</p><p>Harry sat back, ready for yet another much-missed showdown between his two best friends.  Unexpectedly, however, Ron merely stared at her.</p><p>Ginny began to laugh.  Hermione’s stony-faced visage cracked and she started to chuckle as well.  Harry covered his mouth with a fist and coughed several times in a row.</p><p>Ron seemed to snap out of his stupor on the sixth cough and burned bright red.  He scrambled to his feet and muttered something about the bathroom before hightailing it out of the attic.  Harry felt bad and tagged along, hot on his heels.</p><p>They reached the second landing before Ron slowed and sat down against the wall.</p><p>“Why are you following me?” his friend asked tiredly, arms resting on his folded knees. “This ruins my bathroom alibi.”</p><p>Harry shrugged and sat down across from him.  He didn’t have to wait long before Ron launched into a heated diatribe.</p><p>“You haven’t been here long, mate,” said Ron, “but it’s been like this ever since she arrived.  I don’t know what’s going on, but I have a theory.”</p><p>“Do tell.”</p><p>“Hermione’s been replaced by a succubus.”</p><p>Harry choked on his own spit. “Ron, what— ”</p><p>“I know it sounds crazy,” Ron hurried to say, indeed wild-eyed. “But look at the facts, Harry!”</p><p>“What facts?” Harry forced himself to ask.</p><p>“I did my research,” Ron replied seriously. “They go by all kinds of names and come in all sorts of forms.  From the Meridiana in first century Italy to the ancient Arabian myths of the qarinah, she fits a lot of the descriptions, Harry!”</p><p>He held out a fist and began sticking out fingers one by one. “The hair hides the horns, she’s got flawless skin, the curves… and Harry, she hasn’t stopped wearing socks since she got here.  Clearly, it’s to hide a common deformity in succubi: claws for feet.  You might be wondering why they still take the shape of human feet— but I’ve got an answer for that, too.  Glamours.”</p><p>Harry had no idea what to say.</p><p>“I think she got possessed when she was at her parents’ house and she came here to get the jump on us at the most convenient time,” Ron ploughed on. “The Cup, when all of us Weasley men would be gathered in one place.  It all makes sense, Harry! It couldn’t be anything else!”</p><p>Harry had never seen his best mate take such an academic interest in anything, least of all academics, and thought fast to dissuade him before things derailed further.</p><p>“Ron, I admire your thorough investigation into this, but I think you might be wrong on this one.  And anyway, if Hermione is a succubus, then Ginny has to be, as well.”</p><p>Ron recoiled. “What? Gross, no.”</p><p>“Well, I noticed something, too,” said Harry. “They’re… y’know, girls.  They’re wearing makeup and… they smell good.”</p><p>“No, I think my idea makes more sense,” Ron replied slowly. “They’ve been girls all along.  Ginny hasn’t changed.  Hermione has.  Something fishy is going on.”</p><p>“Okay, look at it this way,” said Harry. “Hermione has never been unattractive, mate, but we were kids when we met.  I’m no expert at this by any means, but I think there’s some point when girls turn into women just like boys turn into men.  She might have just stepped over to the other side.”</p><p>Ron crossed his arms. “In three months, everything about her changed?”</p><p>“Not everything.”</p><p>“I haven’t seen her with a book yet.  That’s like ninety percent of her personality gone, mate.”</p><p>“I still read,” a voice remarked crossly from above them.</p><p>Their heads snapped up.</p><p>Hermione and Ginny were leaning over the balcony, amusement written plainly on their faces.  Harry took note of Crookshanks cradled in Ginny’s arms like a rather ugly baby.</p><p>“Just because I hit a growth spurt doesn’t mean I’ve been possessed by a succubus, Ronald,” said Hermione.</p><p>Ron shot to his feet. “You don’t fool me, she-demon!”</p><p>And with that, he darted down the stairs and out of sight.  They all stared after him for a moment.</p><p>“I can’t be the only one that finds this hilarious?” Ginny suddenly asked. “Do Fred and George know? Someone should tell them.”</p><p>“I think he’s finally lost it,” Hermione mused. “Who knew all it took to break Ron were three months’ worth of yoga and a consistent hair and skin care routine?”</p><p>“And a couple of coats of lip gloss,” Ginny added, grinning wickedly.</p><p>“Right, of course,” said Hermione. “That can’t be overstated.”</p><p>“No comment,” muttered Harry.  </p><p>The loud crashing of what turned out to be Bill and Charlie table-battling startled them all, and dinner arrived soon after.</p>
