    <p>April 3rd, 1997.</p><p><br/>
The room is always gloomy, even in summer. This evening, the faint-hearted efforts of a single candle on the desk cannot do much against the lengthening shadows. Bright, delicate instruments cover every available surface; they tick, whirr, clunk and occasionally explode, all tainted by the sickly green light of the fireplace. Rolls of parchment are scattered across the wide, ancient desk, the debris of a cluttered mind relying too heavily on notes and reminders to keep itself in order. The old man’s voice is tired, a once-hearty clarion turned hoarse.</p><p><br/>
‘Your objections are noted, Severus. Unless anything else comes up, we ought to be careful when we speak. We have little time left, and much to accomplish.</p><p><br/>
A faint echo, but an unmistakeably nasal and churlish tone. ‘...Yes, Headmaster. As you say.’</p><p><br/>
With a quiet whoosh of emerald flame, Albus Dumbledore withdraws his head from the fire. Straightening up and dusting off his robes with his good hand, he lets out a small sigh. So many things to take care of before the end. Though it has, of course, required an alteration to his plans, a tiny part of him will be glad when this year – and all his years – come to an end. It will be...pleasant, to rest at last.</p><p><br/>
A gentle knock at the door, and he banishes this thought to the back of his mind. The castle is quiet, this evening. During exams most of the students are safely sequestered in their commons rooms or the library, trying desperately to fill the corners of their brain with extra knowledge, like packing scraps of cloth into a bag already bursting at the seams.</p><p><br/>
‘Come’</p><p><br/>
The door swings silently open. Albus settles himself behind the desk, his shield of solidity and oaken resolve for longer than he cares to admit. Wars have been fought on this desk, battles lost and won, pawns sacrificed. The youngish-looking man who enters the room has not been one of them for many years. It surprised Albus that he agreed, even in principal, to this meeting.</p><p><br/>
‘Professor’.</p><p><br/>
Albus makes the motions of hospitality. ‘Please, come in. Sit. Would you care for something to eat, or drink? I suppose you must have had a long journey,’ although, he readily admits, he has no idea where the man has been since they parted ways in the Black Forest. The visitor comes closer, and the dim sputtering of the candle illuminates... ruddy, tousled hair and a short beard, framing hooded grey eyes. A travel-stained robe of faded olive, held together with a rawhide strip. A satchel of the same rough leather at his waist. He sits.</p><p><br/>
‘It’s very kind of …you to offer, Professor. Actually, I brought something to drink.’ He rummages in the satchel and withdraws a long flask of blue glass and pot metal. ‘They brew it from cactus …flowers. Something in the water, too. Quite potent, but all new …sensations are to be welcomed, don’t you agree?’</p><p><br/>
The young man’s voice has lost none of its peculiar cadence – the way he speaks is off-key to the point of being hypnotic, as if English were not only his second language but that speaking were an altogether inferior method of communication. Which, Albus supposed, was true. After a fashion. He conjures up a pair of small, decorative glasses, and the man uncorks his flash and decants a short measure into each. Passing one across the desk to Albus, the visitor raises his glass, raises an eyebrow, and sinks the liquor in one go. Albus catches a whiff of the foul-smelling stuff before he drinks. The smell, however, is nothing to the taste.</p><p><br/>
After the brief and customary burn of strong alcohol, there comes a metallic tang that seems to coat his sinuses. This is followed by the actual taste of the liquid – which is as foul as the smell – and then, unexpectedly and not unpleasantly, a sensation of swimming, as if in an ocean of distilled dreams, a banana-scented wave bowling him over, the secrets of the universe explained by a buffalo-headed god, the taste of purple ink and the feel of tangerine jelly, a bed of rubber nails and the smoulder of a peat fire and</p><p><br/>
Albus sits up in his chair. The young man is watching him, grey eyes unwavering. The impressions are gone as quickly as they came. He struggles, for a second or two, to find words.</p><p><br/>
‘I...Most extraordinary...what on earth?’ he manages.</p><p><br/>
‘As I said, something in the water. I have yet to work …out what, but I’m having enormous fun trying’. The young man flashes a grin, and Albus chuckles. Sixty years of conflicted history lie between them, but the gulf has lessened considerably in just a few minutes.  </p><p><br/>
‘A new sensation indeed. You have my thanks. Wonders, as they say, never cease’</p><p><br/>
‘If they did, we’d all be the poorer …for it. You called me here for a reason, Professor. Forgive …my abruptness, but I have, as you so kindly pointed out, come a very long way.’</p><p><br/>
‘Ah, yes. Yes indeed. Have you given any thought to my proposal?’</p><p><br/>
‘I have some questions.’</p><p><br/>
‘Naturally.’ There is an impatience to the young man. He has already made his decision. Good.</p><p><br/>
‘Firstly, I’ll need a small room set …aside and released from the usual wards and charms. Actually, …a stretch of wall would be enough. Rather than discommode myself by moving into the castle, I can simply …establish a direct link to my home. Second, I’ll need a classroom with extremely …potent damping spells. The closer the former is to the latter, the better …for me. Thirdly,’ and here the young man drew a ragged scrap of parchment from his satchel and placed it on the desk, ‘These items, a decent supply of all of them. There’s nothing …too extravagant there – if there is, I’ll bring it myself. And I get to choose my students.’</p><p><br/>
Albus leans back in his chair. He had expected it to be harder than this. ‘A classroom and study with suitable, er… wall space, should be no problem. Filius will be able to deal with your requirements as regards the protective wards. Whatever supplies you need will be in place by the start of term. And the students... As you know, when I invited you here, it was with regard to one student in particular. The circumstances have now changed somewhat – he will not be your concern; in fact, it is increasingly likely that he will no longer be at the school next year. There are others, however, who might benefit from your particular expertise. Minerva will ensure that the right people come together, as she always does. However... I don’t know how much you know regarding the situation with Tom Riddle?’</p><p><br/>
The young man regards Albus, his grey eyes fixed on the twinkling blue of the headmaster’s. ‘You wish me to keep my skills out of reach to any who might be affiliated …with Riddle? From what I understand, that more or less excludes the …whole of Slytherin house, not to mention casting doubt on most of the pureblood families.’</p><p><br/>
‘Not necessarily.’ Albus says, ticking items off an invisible list. ‘There are few students outside of Slytherin with any connection to Tom or his activities, this time round. There are even a handful of Slytherins that you could consider – those without allegiance. From what I understand of the practice, hardly any of the Ravenclaws will fit the bill – Miss Lovegood, perhaps, will demonstrate the necessary qualities. The Hufflepuffs are fiercely loyal to this school and to each other, and the Gryffindors are...well, Gryffindors. There should be no difficulty keeping word of this little experiment from the ears of Tom and his compatriots. In any case, it is my estimation that he considers this branch of magic – like alchemy or true scholarship – beneath his contempt, a means to an end if he considers it at all. Therein, of course, lies our advantage.’</p><p><br/>
The young man says nothing. After a moment’s pause, he stands and offers his hand to the Headmaster, who shakes it. The deal is done, and the debt of sixty years will be repaid. As the young man is almost at the door, one more thing occurs to Albus.</p><p><br/>
‘What name will you take?’</p><p><br/>
‘A good question. Crowley, I think. An old favourite.’</p><p><br/>
‘Crowley?’ Albus is surprised. ‘The man was a charlatan.’</p><p><br/>
The young man looks over his shoulder, and his eyes register amusement. ‘I’ll be here under false pretenses. It seems only fitting. See you next year... Headmaster.’</p><p><br/>
‘Alas. I fear not.’ The young man looks quizzical. Albus feels no obligation to divulge the details. Already there is a tiny seed of doubt, blooming deep in his stomach – a feeling he has not truly experienced since the Black Forest, when he was much younger and more headstrong. He has planned and plotted for years, decades even... but what if it the whole structure should rely too heavily on one joist? Love is a powerful weapon indeed, but friends with fire are not to be sniffed at.</p><p><br/>
‘Minerva will make sure that you are able to carry out this task. The rest I leave in your capable hands.’</p><p><br/>
‘And if I need help?’</p><p><br/>
Albus allows himself a small smile. ‘It is a notorious aphorism, and a phrase I am overly fond of, but what I have always said remains true: Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.’</p>
