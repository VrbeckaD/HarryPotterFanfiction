His mother, he realized, had spelled her gorgeous long coat to give her all the warmth she needed. But it was a consuming magic that required maintenance and she needed to save her strength. The way his father was breathing, he needed more air. Overgrown snakes and dark, stolen mansions had a way of running a man through his physical vitality. All of them, his parents and the other Death Eaters, sat somber, while waiting to be called. The former owners of the manor lay quiet and unmoving, piled in a corner, a reminder to everyone how empty their plight had become. Draco, thankfully, was never cold anymore. That's something to be said for fear. It dominated all other sensations.</p><p>It took over an hour before Lucius and his son were asked to join the Dark Lord in his confiscated office. Fenrir, leading an entourage of bodyguards currently in service to the Lord, insisted that Narcissa stay seated. She let him know, eyes stabbing, that he wasn't the only one with a dangerous bite. Lucius took her hand for a moment, kissed it, and watched her rage subside.</p><p>"We'll be fine, my love."</p><p>The time was upon them when no one really believed that anymore. As it was, Draco had seen his father lose so much weight, it alarmed him. Alcohol, and Narcissa's forgiveness, were all that seemed to be holding him together now. Yet still, upon being summoned, the whole family made an effort to appear as a seamless unit. Malfoy Senior shaved and expensively polished, Narcissa poised at the top of her nobility, and Draco, the culmination of their well-bred pride, shone white-haired and golden in a dark suit befitting his pristine good looks.</p><p>Escorted through the double doors, which were stalks of preserved timber bolted together with black iron, the Malfoy men waited patiently for all the bodyguards to follow in and the doors to close behind them. Once spaced inside, they spread out, allowing the floor to open between the guests and the Dark Lord who motioned for them to approach.</p><p><br/>"Come, come. Let me get a good look at you two. Never a common sight to see a father and son so arrayed in splendor."</p><p>Draco followed his father's example and stepped forward. He counted the twelve people standing watch in the room. Behind them, a curtain of blue glass and grillwork allowed sheets of blue light to filter diffusely into the room, which was expansive. It was the study of a civilized family, full of books and lounging couches, and Voldemort looked out of place in it. Mainly, Draco was checking to see where Fenrir was standing. He scared Draco more than anything. Voldemort could only kill you. Fenrir could make you wish you were dead.</p><p>Before being invited to sit, Voldemort had the chairs removed and replaced with a cushioned chase. Both father and son took this for a show of favoritism, not worth questioning.</p><p>When they were all seated, Voldemort said to Lucius, "I have saved the best for last, Lucius. Now that my administrative matters are sorted, we have time for fun."</p><p>"Fun? What do you have in mind?" A nervous tick inserted itself in Lucius's smile.</p><p>Draco knew that nervous tick was never good. And neither was Voldemort's use of the word 'fun'.</p><p>"The arrogance of your genetics is truly pleasing to behold."</p><p>"Thank you, my Lord."</p><p>Draco's eyes darted from Voldemort to his father.</p><p>"Would you be so kind, Lucius, as to kiss the boy in my presence?"</p><p>The question was so blunt, no one could blame Lucius for needing it repeated.</p><p>"I'm sorry? A kiss?"</p><p>"We all know that you dote on your child. Do you mind indulging a whim of mine?"</p><p>Lucius understood that he did not have a choice. But he could not silence his affront as quickly as he would've liked. "My Lord?"</p><p>Draco appeared to stop breathing. In his eyes, Lucius saw their wilted panic before Draco lowered them.</p><p>"Yes, you know my tastes well, Lucius. The boy is quite virginal. How you've kept him untouched, I don't know. But now is an opportune time to appreciate how you both use your pureblood genetics so differently. A father's coarse and darker, worldly experience, packaged as gloriously as it is, initiating a tender one, made in his own image, is a tantalizing work of art that must be displayed before me."</p><p>Lucius was no longer smiling. "But Lord. Isn't that a bit… beneath you? It is not worthy of your genius."</p><p>"My genius is knowing, Lucius, that you covet your boy's innocence and will do as I say to keep myself, or better, Fenrir, from harming him."</p><p>"I am loyal to you, without fault. You need not test me so."</p><p>"Then show me that this test will not break you."</p><p>Vicious. Lucius knew those reptilian eyes were not going to show any mercy.</p><p>"The longer you hesitate, the more you fill me with doubt."</p><p>"He's my son."</p><p>"He's a Death Eater now. You know our ways. Everyone contributes. You know what you did to ensure my favor all those years ago. I have not called upon you for some time. Demonstrate your loyalty to me now. "</p><p>Lucius knew that another word of protest could cost him dearly. He steeled himself against his own fury. Voldemort would kill Draco. That would be the kindest thing he would do, after punishing Lucius for his hesitation.</p><p>Lucius motioned, "Come, Draco. It's okay."</p><p>Clearly, Draco's furrowed brow said it wasn't. He looked ill. Lucius knew this show of discomfort was exactly what Voldemort wanted to see. He took his son's arm and gently stirred him to the center of the seat. Voldemort smiled as Draco was pulled stiffly towards his father.</p><p>Lucius decided to take as much control over the situation as possible. He set the tone for Draco, touching his hair.</p><p>"He's right, Draco. We all contribute. We make a game of pleasure. It isn't real. So we are going to get this over with, like any assignment. You are old enough to realize some things …"</p><p>"I'll do it." The words fell out of Draco's mouth. They were, however, not in agreement with the look on his face. He looked at Voldemort while speaking to his father. "I'm not made of glass. He'll kill one of us if I don't."</p><p>The monster behind the desk smiled appreciatively. "Gracious boy."</p><p>Lucius stuttered. "It's, it's a game, Draco. Power is a precarious thing. Only the greatest wizards can harness their energy."</p><p>"Yes, my boy. We are represented by a serpent force because it is a life-giving energy. A sexual energy, and we have mastered it. The same force that can create children, can be contained and used for greater creations. I sit before you now, because my servants owe their stock to me and keep me replenished. In return, I give them sanctuary in my pureblood kingdom. Without the serpent journey, this world could not exist. The serpent is more than a metaphor. It is the force that begets. Every man, woman and child, owes their existence to the very pressure that builds, coils, and unwinds between your legs. It creates worlds. If innocent babes are born from it, who is anyone to deem themselves above it? And if I ask it of you, you will give yours to me, just as your father has agreed to do."</p><p>Draco tried to keep very still. Even if he could get past the twelve extra people in the room, he wasn't getting out those massive doors by himself. And even if he could run, he couldn't leave his father.</p><p>"And as I participate in your experience, I can make use of it. You are a fountain of uncomprehending energy, Draco. As you bleed distress for me, I collect it and my designs take form more quickly. With the life-force of my servants, I create a better world for us all. All of my Death Eaters comply in this manner. They consider it an honor, Draco."</p><p>Draco did not appear to be comforted. Quite the opposite, panic stretched his eyes wide as he looked from his father the thing calling itself a person. His narrow frame had already begun sliding away. Lucius took his arm again.</p><p>"It's only a kiss, Draco."</p><p>"And a bit more, for a start. We will start you out gently, won't we, Lucious? His heart rate accelerates. There is too much potential in his fear to be wasted. Let's proceed slowly, shall we?"</p><p>Mouth tight, Lucius moved to reign in his son's spastic retreat. Draco did not fight outright, but his muscles locked against his father's gentle touch.</p><p>"Do you not wish to serve me, Draco? Perhaps it will help to know that even your mother, Dear Narcissa, has complied in this manner."</p><p>Instead of having a calming effect, this brought Draco to a wheezing hyperventilation. He wanted to be strong for his father. He wanted to be brave. At war with a body that strained to escape, he tore the words from his throat, "I will serve you. I will do it."</p><p>His words were not meant to please Voldemort. They were meant to keep his parents safe. When Draco thought of other torments on the other side of the doors behind them, particularly the likes of Fenrir, he was willing to cooperate. The Dark Lord's mention of his mother was nothing but a transparent threat.</p><p>He saw his father's insane composure and took strength from it. What was one more fucking perversion? This was war and he had to get his family out of it. He forced himself to lean into his father. He meant to be the one to start the kiss so that Lucius could escape all blame. But when the moment came, he just couldn't. He couldn't go any further. It was Lucius who had to pull him forward, stroke his hair, and coax his mouth open. Feeling his father's tongue slip into him, caused an involuntary arch of his back. Fight or flight. Draco's muscles responded the way a person responds to drowning. He would've thrashed out of his father's arms, had Lucius not gripped him.</p><p>There's a reason why this crossed line is forbidden among all people and all nations the world over. The Dark Lord knew what that reason was. Lucius knew it. And now Draco knew it. This much intrusive power could not be loosened on the common people of the world. Talk of harnessing it meant nothing until Lucius's breath and soul entered Draco. Even in Lucius's restraint, Draco felt the strength of his whole body, in the working's of Lucius's mouth.</p><p>His father's efforts insisted that Draco meet him halfway. They pulled Draco from the dark corner where he wanted to hide.</p><p>'Don't die on me,' measured tenderness seemed to say as Lucius tried to give Voldemort the show he wanted while protecting his son's sanity at the same time.</p><p>"Hold him, Lucius. With desire," Voldemort requested from his voyeuristic perch behind his desk.</p><p>Unable to ignore the tremors in Draco's torso, Lucius lifted him closer against him. His hand traveled, large and searching, up Draco's ribs, and over his linen shirt.</p><p>Draco could not process his father's actions and all the sensations that came with it. Nor did he want to. His only goal became to hold on while Lucius gave Voldemort what he wanted. This was the man who meant everything to him. Now was not the time to show squeamishness, weakness. Take it, he told himself. But being drawn against his father's body, reminiscent of all the times he'd spied Lucius pulling his mother into him, caused him to resist just a little. He choked on embarrassment he couldn't hide.</p><p>"Very good, Draco," Voldemort inserted his pleasure.</p><p>Apparently, Draco's torment, was what he wanted. The perverse act that it took to achieve it, was inconsequential.</p><p>"Make him enjoy it, Lucius. Persuade him. Young man, your father is an expert at carnal play. Ask any Death Eater here. His talents will not go wasted today."</p><p>If Draco knew what this meant, he hid that knowledge from himself. He felt heated wetness in his father's coarse tongue against his neck. It worked its way beneath his jaw.</p><p><br/>"Yes, Lucius. The color rises in your son like crimson mercury. His fair skin betrays everything he's feeling. Even tears he does not show. A masterpiece of genetics."</p><p>Draco heard the smile in Voldemort's voice.</p><p>"Yes, boy. My power is so great, I have a direct connection to your body, through your father's touch. Even your disgust with me, is pure energy that infuses my desire. Lucius, since this is his first time, his first real kiss, I will let him off lightly. His virtue is too exquisite to rush to an end. Let us prolong it. Make him come, and I'll let you both go. I think we'll get more out of him if we give him some time."</p><p>Draco shoved at Lucius, aiming his hatred at Voldemort. "You bastard! This is how you torture the people who are loyal to you?"</p><p>No sooner than the words were out, Lucius clamped his wide hand over Draco's mouth.</p><p>"Now, Draco, our Lord has his reason."</p><p>It took some doing to restrain his son. As Voldemort looked on, amused, Lucius managed to wrap his weight around Draco's body, pushing him into stillness.</p><p>"Look, this is what we do. Trust me. I'm sorry I never prepared you for this, but I was hoping I would never have to. I need you to be brave, Draco. Do you hear me? I need you to be brave."</p><p>Even as Lucius spoke, Draco felt his heated caresses return. He slithered squeamishly around his father's invasive fingers. They flattened over his shirt again, lingering at one of the nubs under his thumb. Draco's mind protected itself, locking his muscles against a different heat expanding from his gut.</p><p>This was really happening. Over a dozen people stood in this room, and this was really happening. Lucius tore at him and felt him with the determination to finish it. He whispered to Draco, "I will end this, but you must do your part. Do it fast, Draco."</p><p>A barrier in Draco's mind would not let him feel anything more than humiliation, for his father as well as himself.</p><p>"I think he needs help, Lucius. Your boy is too brave for his own good."</p><p>Another threat. This time, Draco opened his eyes and stared hard in confrontation at Voldemort. He couldn't speak from being too keenly aware of how Lucius pushed over him and held him in place. Just to hear his father's jagged breathing, breathing too intimate, too obscene, twisted in his gut. It told him too much. Told him that Lucius's own body was getting ready to do something a son should not see it do.</p><p>Lucius pushed Draco's legs open and settled his weight between them. Draco screamed in dignified silence. No one should feel what his father pressed against him. Even through their clothes, the detail was too much. It was bad enough that their bodies were touching like this, but how could his father be so impossibly firm? Indecent didn't begin to represent what Draco felt. And when Lucius's hand bullied its way between them, Draco couldn't stop himself from pushing it away.</p><p>The strength of his father's hand told him that Lucius was willing to break Draco's wrist in order to survive what they had to do.</p><p>Voldemort spoke softly. "Let him have it, Draco."</p><p>The command, filled with slippery threat, absolved Draco from all responsibility. Tears of tension that Draco hid, now fell.</p><p>This was just stress, he told himself. He wasn't a child and he'd do anything to save his family. Anything. Yet, Lucius's fingers making contact with the most tender skin on his body, proved him wrong. The only way he endured it, having that skin pulled and bothered, was by having Lucius hold him down. He wanted to be strong, unaffected. But his spine sent all those familiar signals shooting out through his nervous system. Like it didn't know this was his father. If he knew it, why didn't his body know it?</p><p>"It's okay, Draco," Lucius tried to soothe. "Let it happen. This is all he wants."</p><p>Only it wasn't, Draco knew. This wasn't just empty sex. That bastard made sure of it. No father and son could do this without killing their fucking souls and that's what Voldemort fucking wanted. He wanted their souls, laid as bare and vulnerable as he could get them.</p><p>"Look at me, Draco."</p><p>Calm control in Lucius's tone, coaxed Draco away from his building hysteria. Lucius spoke with mastery that extended to the slow manipulations of his hand.</p><p>"You are going to survive this. You will be fine. I'm your father and I will protect you. Even from this. Let him have the body. He can't take your mind. He can't take your heart and soul. He can't hurt who you really are. Let him have this meager scrap for his pleasure. He wants to see your soul so badly that he will let me tell you anything to get you to show it. No one can hide who they are when they're coming. They're soul is visible in the convulsions. They are helpless. That's what he wants to see.</p><p>"I cannot mince words. He wants to see you ejaculate and he will be satisfied for a while. If it were easy for you he would have no use for you. There is energy in your resistance, in your dignity. But now it's time to finish it. Let it go, Draco. For me."</p><p>Strangely comforted by Lucius's integrity, and the rich deep tones in his paternal voice, Draco accepted his father's hand. He accepted the discomfort and the shame, until finally, he accepted something Voldemort could mistake for pleasure. Normal routes to the only, solitary climaxes he had ever known, had to be rerouted as his father's rubbing and pulling short-circuited those areas, never to be used again. Eyes squeezed against the invasive stare of Voldemort, Draco went where his father's intention took him. Reluctant and difficult, his body kicked responsively as his guts churned out the contractions that Voldemort wanted to see. His orgasm was violent, emerging from a storm of conflicts within him. To come through at all, meant he had to give into his father's efforts. He had to let it in, in order to let himself out.</p><p>He spilled into the room for so long, under the duress of such wet heat, that he wondered if Voldemort had used a spell to prolong it. His abdomen ground into itself so hard, forcing his muscles into his stomach, that it left him depleted with a touch of nausea.</p><p>In his father's arms, he hid his face. Lucius let him.</p><p>Voldemort breathed approving sounds, short of applause.</p><p>In the silence that followed, Draco was forced to hear himself saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry …" over and over again. He was forced to hear his own sobs, as if his actions were unforgivable.</p><p>Voldemort, in silent council with himself, relished everything he saw. The Malfoy boy moved him terribly, and that was a gift to a Dark Lord who otherwise felt nothing from humans.</p><p>"I am so pleased with your performance, Draco. You suffer so beautifully. My essence is expanded many times over. This is how your loyalty strengthens me."</p><p>He spoke to Lucius, who stroked Draco's temple. "He is a prize, Lucius. He will make a fine candidate for our little experiment. I am elevating his position in my office. He has proven himself worthy of greater responsibility. My greatest spell, the Unbearable, will be put into service. Your son will be the recipient. When we know it works on him, then it will work on Harry Potter. Draco, you will lead me to a feast. If I am sated by your trauma, imagine what Potter's utter ruin will do for my power.</p><p>Quiet now, Draco looked to Lucius. "What's he mean?"</p><p>"My Lord, the spell is largely unpredictable."</p><p>"The spell is intended for one who is too ashamed to bear it. It is formulated for the likes of Draco and Harry. Masculine innocence contorted to its greatest loss."</p><p>"Draco has suffered enough."</p><p>"For today, perhaps. But not nearly enough. We need him to initiate the weapon that will be extended to Harry Potter."</p><p>"You want to change his body just so that he can be violated even more."</p><p>"It's only temporary. If he can withstand the spell, then so can Harry. If Harry can endure, then I can consume the essence of his suffering like the elixir that it is. I can drain him and kill him."</p><p>"But Draco, you will put Draco at risk in the process. Now, my Lord, I know we are loyal to you. But I beg you, do not subject him to a curse that substitutes his manhood for that of a female, simply to achieve raping Potter's soul. As distasteful as the subject is, Potter doesn't have to be female to achieve that."</p><p>"Drinking Potter's soul, not just raping him. You make it sound so common. The female energy behaves inversely to that of a male. He will absorb what is put into him and return it exponentially. And I have no plans to do anything so damnable to your boy, Lucius."</p><p>"You don't?"</p><p>"No. I'm going to watch as you do it. From what you've just shown me, you are the only one I want to see take your son's virginity. There will be time to bend him over properly, but we will only get one chance to see you break the hymen that I have in store for him. Yes, he will probably go insane, and you may kill yourself, but think of the expansion that awaits me. On the other hand, you and your stock have shown unrivaled strength this day. You may also survive my plans and find your lives restored to its former privacy and dignity. And safety, should you cooperate."</p><p>"My Lord, I beg you…"</p><p>Draco heard his father's pleas. Heard the futile words that passed between them. But he kept his eyes on the floor, even while his hands mechanically rearranged his clothes and prepared to be escorted from Voldemort's office.</p><p>In a kind of shock, he let himself be gently pushed. A hand in the small of his back urged him to follow his father out. He vaguely realized it was Voldemort. In that touch, in the fear in his father's voice, he knew what was coming. The thought of surviving it never occurred to him.</p><p>To be continued….</p><hr/><p>Please review! :-)</p><p>

</p><p> </p><hr/><p>This video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V2ZAUCDQX4&amp;list=PLfP3By3wYC51azxPUJj71cS4eaHJOIsvS&amp;index=94" rel="nofollow">DisneyOverdose,</a> is perfect for this story. </p><hr/><p> </p><p>NOTES:  Yes, my notes are excessive, but you have the freedom to skip them.</p><p><br/>It took my whole life to find a word that matched my magic. Dacryphilia. When done inside the imagination, while wishing no realistic harm to anyone, this is a good thing. There is no pain, only it looks like pain to the observer who is disconnected from it on the outside. These strong emotions made me want to live and see what they were all about. And no, I'm not into BDSM in the typical sense. Too predictable, too inadequate. Give me a drama filled with greater and greater potential. The definition below came from a website. Psychology generally views it in a negative slant, but then, that's just the opinion of stringent private tastes and judgments, and can be forgiven.</p><p>DACRYPHILIA<br/>Meaning<br/>Generally this is associated with Males.<br/>It is the actual pleasure derived from a deep emotional release, such as sobbing or crying.<br/>In most contexts, it refers to the pleasure a Top receives when the Bottom is reduced to tears, from their administration of some form of pain</p><p>Quote:<br/> Where one gets sexual pleasure from tears, sobbing, of another, or themselves. Notably though from others, in a BDSM context. <br/>— GayDemon</p><p>EXTRA NOTES:</p><p><b>Pocketwatchangora's</b> Split woke me up to what I really wanted to write about Draco and Harry. (see end notes) As I told Pocketwatch, Your Draco and Harry surpasses what I wanted from JK Rowling's Draco and Harry. In the final book, the angst between them was an amazing, incredible tease that Draco's kick to Harry's face made us take seriously. No more kid stuff. Then Harry did his worst to Draco on the bathroom floor and it wasn't until your story, Split, that I felt their epic war was finally, sufficiently addressed. You let Draco's character have substance that Rowling didn't really utilize. Tom Felton was the best child actor out of all of them and they almost wasted his talent, till the very end, and we see him shine in his suffering. I can't go to the books for more of this, but I can come to you. This is the sweet spot of fiction and I hope you keep writing. In fact, I hope you dare to take this into the realm of commercial fiction, with your own original work. You've got the stones for it.</p><p>Another story, Silk, is an incredibly well written story. Pushdragon's version of Lucius, Draco, and Harry made me demand nothing less than the HP fic that wanted out of my system. ("Draco Under Glass", "Nocturne for Quill and Ink", and "Silk").</p><p><b>Tom Felton quote (a.k.a. Draco Malfoy) : "I want to push myself until you see tears." </b><br/>Disclaimer #1: JK Rowling is the genius. I'm just playing. The original stories belongs to JK, Fandom gets to take credit for the rest.</p><p>Reader question: Why gender issues? That seems so silly.<br/>Answer: It's a desire to explore males having to cope with female issues. Some of us live experiences that compel us not to take gender for granted, but to look at it. It only seems silly to people who have never had any issues with their gender. And if the human brain can accept magical spells and house elves named Dobby, it's not such a stretch. My most honest identity has always been a combination of all genders anyway. It's only natural that it would show up in my fiction.</p>
