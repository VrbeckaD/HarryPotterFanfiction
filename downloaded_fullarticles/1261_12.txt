    <p>It starts with a wedding.</p>
<p>“Are we ready? Is everyone ready?” Sirius Black is sounding a little tight. He runs a hand through his hair, the hand that is not adjusting his tie. “Moony? Are you ready?”</p>
<p>“I’m ready,” comes the response, and Remus Lupin is sounding a little bored. “I’ve been ready.”</p>
<p>Euphemia Potter’s sitting room is decorated in shades of pink, and Remus is sitting in one of the overstuffed armchairs with his ankle crossed over his knee. He is wearing his Sunday best. The portraits, which crowd the walls, are murmuring amongst themselves in excitement. Over the fireplace there is a painting of a messy-haired teenage boy who, like Remus, looks on with a lack of interest. Inside the painting, the boy yawns and adjusts his glasses. Remus gives him a look as if to say <i>you and me both</i>.</p>
<p>It’s been a long morning.</p>
<p>“He’s late,” Sirius is saying, pained. He shakes back his sleeve to check his watch. And, as if he heard the complaint, Peter Pettigrew bursts through the front door, breathless. Sirius rounds on him. “It’s about fucking time…”</p>
<p>“I’m early,” snaps Peter, cheeks flushed. “I’d have been here sooner if you didn’t have me apparating all over…”</p>
<p>“Do you have it?” Sirius asks impatiently, and Peter pulls an aged bottle of firewhisky from the pocket of his traveling cloak, handing it to Sirius with a scowl.</p>
<p>“Honestly Sirius, you need it more than he does,” Remus says. Sirius glares as he unscrews the top of the bottle and takes a healthy swig. </p>
<p>“Rosmerta wasn’t keen on giving me that one,” Peter is saying to no one in particular, “it’s the oldest she’s got.”</p>
<p>“Only the best today,” Sirius says as if someone dared to challenge the point. “Everything has to be perfect…”</p>
<p>Peter gives him a look that clearly states that Sirius has no idea the hell he’s been through to procure that specific bottle, but before he can open his mouth to point this out, Euphemia Potter is coming down the stairs in the foyer looking---</p>
<p>“Radiant,” says Sirius with a wide smile, extending his hand. The elderly woman takes it gratefully. </p>
<p>“Drinking already, Sirius?” she asks him with a note of amusement.</p>
<p>“Just a sip.”</p>
<p>She lifts a hand and pats his cheek. “And how big was the sip?”</p>
<p>“It was a gulp,” Remus chimes in, and she laughs. To everyone’s surprise, she takes the bottle from Sirius’s grip and helps herself to some as well. When she releases the bottle from her lips she stares around at their gawking faces and shrugs.</p>
<p>“Well it’s a wedding, isn’t it?” </p>
<p>“Right you are, Mum!”</p>
<p>James Potter, tall and lanky and struggling with his tie, stomps down the stairs. He’s grinning as he comes to a stop in front of his mother, who immediately reaches up to smooth his hair.</p>
<p>“Can you get it to lay flat? Just for today?”</p>
<p>He simultaneously pulls away from her touch and reaches for the bottle in her hand, which she holds at arm’s length. “Come off it!”</p>
<p>“No drinking until after,” she scolds him and he rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m the <i>groom</i>,” he says impatiently, still reaching. “I have <i>nerves</i>....”</p>
<p>Sirius checks his watch again, watching little stars rotate clockwise around the frame. “Right. We’ve got time.”</p>
<p>“Of course we have time, you rounded everyone up three hours early,” says James, which is a point everyone else in the room hadn’t made out of fear. Then he stands up straight with his arms wide, beaming. “How do I look?”</p>
<p>“Like a married man,” grins Sirius. </p>
<p>“I’ll go find your father,” says Euphemia. She tries once more to flatten James’s hair, then sighs hopelessly and excuses herself.</p>
<p>“Right, now that she’s gone…” He moves to take the bottle from Sirius, who holds it aloft. “Padfoot!”</p>
<p>“A toast,” says Sirius, holding up a finger to sedate James, who rolls his eyes. “Gents?”</p>
<p>Remus sighs, pushing himself up from the chair to join the other three in the foyer. They stand in a circle: James, the tallest, with his mussed hair and glasses, Sirius, carelessly handsome, holding the firewhisky, Remus, traces of exhaustion etched into his thin face, but grinning, and Peter, short and watery-eyed, looking up at his friends with anticipation. Remus, with a flick of his wand, summons four glasses that each of them catch one-handed, and Sirius makes work of filling them halfway with the amber liquor.</p>
<p>“To Prongs, on his wedding day,” Sirius declares, holding up his glass, “I still think he’s a nutter but we’re probably all going to die soon anyway---”</p>
<p>“Charming,” drawls Remus as Peter snorts.</p>
<p>“--- Cheers!”</p>
<p>“And,” James says quickly, grabbing Sirius’s arm before he can throw back the liquor, “to us.”</p>
<p>It’s a touching moment, four school friends in a foyer, all suits and ties and travelling cloaks, all shifty grins and raw nerves,  toasting. </p>
<p>“To the Marauders,” says Peter. James claps a hand to his shoulder.</p>
<p>“The Marauders,” chimes Lupin.</p>
<p>Sirius, grandly: “The Marauders.”</p>
<p>“The Marauders!” exclaims James, and there’s a great cheer followed by a burst of laughter as they toss back their drinks. “Right, then. Off we go?”</p>
<p>And with a crack, they disappear.</p>

  <p>.......................................</p>
</center>Had you told Lily Evans she’d be marrying James Potter three years ago she would have laughed in your face, but today….<p>“Don’t step on it!” she panics, snatching the edge of her dress (white, like her mother had requested) away from harm, harm meaning the bottom of Alice Longbottom’s shoe. And Alice, raising her hands in defense, stops where she stands. </p>
<p>“Do you need a drink?” comes the question from the corner, where Marlene McKinnon is sitting in her gold bridesmaid’s dress, drinking. Alice shoots her a look. “What? It’s a wedding.”</p>
<p>“It’s <i>early</i>----”</p>
<p>“Bet James is drinking,” Marlene says matter-of-factly. “Bet they’ve been drinking for hours.”</p>
<p>“Do you think he’s drunk?” Lily asks Alice, panic rising again. “Merlin, if he’s drunk…”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think he’s drunk,” Alice says soothingly, glaring at Marlene, who swirls her glass of champagne. </p>
<p>“Sirius is drunk.”</p>
<p>Lily narrows her eyes. “How do you know?”</p>
<p>Marlene shrugs. “I just know.”</p>
<p>“And if Sirius is drunk.” Alice retains her calm, “then Remus will handle it.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. His boyfriend.”</p>
<p>“Marlene, please,” Alice hisses. “Not today.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please, contain yourself,” says Lily. “Or I’ll jinx you out of all the photos.”</p>
<p>It’s Marlene’s turn to narrow her eyes. “You wouldn’t dare.”</p>
<p>Lily, wand aloft: “Try me.”</p>
<p>Swigging back the remains of her champagne, Marlene forces a smile. “Weddings make me bitter.”</p>
<p>“Everything makes you bitter.”</p>
<p>“Can’t argue that,” Marlene sighs, magically refilling her glass.</p>
<p>“Take it easy until after the ceremony, Mar,” pleads Lily. “For me.”</p>
<p>“You’re not nervous?” Marlene asks her curiously. Alice watches her carefully, threateningly, from her position on the floor straightening Lily’s gown. </p>
<p>“No,” Lily says, and it’s simple. “I’m ready.”</p>
<p>“You’re eighteen. We’ve barely seen the world….”</p>
<p>“And if You-Know-Who stays at it we won’t see it at all,” Lily chirps. “Let’s live while we can, shall we?”</p>
<p>There’s a moment of silence, and then Marlene raises her glass. “To Lily and James. Bunch of gits.”</p>
<p>Lily smiles. “That’s the spirit.”</p>
