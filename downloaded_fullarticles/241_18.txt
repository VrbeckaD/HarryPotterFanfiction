    <p>“So you’re friends with <em> Malfoy </em> ?” Ron Weasley burst out one late Saturday evening in late September. Again. Ron had said it at least three times in the last few minutes by Harry’s count. He sighed. Harry had come to Ron and Hermione’s for dinner like he usually did on the weekends when he wasn’t on a case. He’d been a bit nervous about tonight because he’d decided to tell them he had become friends with Draco all those months ago at the Ministry Gala for War Orphans. He knew from bitter experience that it was better to hear it from him rather than the gossip mongers at the <em> Prophet. </em></p><p>Now, sitting on the couch in Ron and Hermione’s sitting room, Harry and Ron were having firewhiskies while they talked and Hermione finished cleaning up the kitchen from dinner.</p><p>“<em> Yes </em> ,” Harry said in exasperation. He was getting tired of repeating himself because Ron just couldn’t get over the fact that Harry could be friends with Draco. “Look, Ron, he's changed since school and the war. We all have if I’m honest. And you know as well as I do that he never really had a choice when it came to being a Death Eater or anything. He was just trying to protect his family. Voldemort was <em> living in their house </em> for fuck’s sake.” </p><p>Ron tossed back his firewhisky in one go, a shudder running through his body as the drink burned down his throat before he spoke again. “I know that, Harry. But it’s still <em> Malfoy </em> ! The same git that tormented and insulted us in school. He called Hermione a <em> mudblood </em> ! How am I supposed to just forget all that? Hell I’m not even sure I can <em> forgive </em>him for any of it.”</p><p>Harry sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Look you guys don’t have to be around him yet if you don’t want to be, but please, don’t make me choose between my friendship with you and my friendship with him. I can’t do that. I just …” The lump that came into his throat stopped the words, choking him.</p><p>He closed his eyes. He couldn’t lose Ron and Hermione over this. He couldn’t. Not after everything with Ginny. Harry didn’t think he’d be able to handle it if it came to that. Letting out a breath he opened his eyes to see Ron looking at him, his blue eyes concerned and his expression chagrined. </p><p>“Sorry Harry. You must know I’d never do that. I promised after .. I’d never do that … not again.” He trailed off as he stood, going to the liquor cabinet, pouring himself another firewhisky. </p><p>Harry felt the tension melt away from him. He did know. Sometimes though, like now, the anxiety would crawl up and nearly consume him. Swallowing he nodded at Ron as he sat down next to him again. “I know. I just ..” he trailed off not knowing how to finish the sentence. </p><p>Ron seemed to understand though because he simply said, “Yeah, I get it, mate.”</p><p>They fell quiet, each sipping their drinks with the fire crackling in the hearth, listening to the sounds of Hermione cleaning up in the kitchen. She, surprisingly, had taken the news of his new found friendship with Draco better than he’d expected. But then, she did work with him a little bit since they both worked in the Wizengamot Office. Hermione as a solicitor, Draco as a junior solicitor. He’d started out after his trial and house arrest were over, as a clerk in the office, mostly filing papers. He’d then worked his way into being a court clerk not even a year later. Now he’d gone from court clerk to junior solicitor. Draco had apparently studied a lot of both Wizarding law and Muggle law while on his house arrest.</p><p>Noise in the doorway to the sitting room drew their attention to Hermione as she came into the room, a tray laden with a steaming pot of tea, three mugs, and what smelled like treacle tart floating behind her. </p><p>“Are you still on about Harry being friends with Draco? Honestly, Ron I don’t know why you’re making a big deal out of this. He has changed, I’ve seen it for myself remember? You would think we hadn’t fought a war five years ago,” Hermione said in exasperation. </p><p>Ron looked like he wanted to say something but a quelling look from Hermione had him closing his mouth. </p><p>Hermione settled the tray on the coffee table before taking a seat in one of the squashy armchairs that sat across from the couch. “He really is different, Ron. And he did apologize to me. I’ve told you that. He was very sincere. We’ve had several lovely chats when we’ve run across each other in the office. He is very knowledgeable about law. All that time spent studying during his house arrest really did pay off. And anyone he’s worked with so far has had no complaints. It took a while of course, but no one bats an eye anymore. They respect him now.”</p><p>As she spoke, Hermione fixed their mugs of tea and put slices of treacle tart on plates before sending them over to the boys with a flick of her wand. </p><p>Taking the floating mug and setting it on the table next to him, Harry muttered a quiet, “Thanks, Hermione.” She gave him a small smile, knowing he was thanking her for not just the tea and tart. He really did love her, he was so very lucky she was one of his best friends. </p><p>“Of course, Harry,” she told him with a look that said plainly, <em> What else would I do? </em>He returned her smile with a slightly sheepish one. </p><p>The three friends talked and laughed and joked as they drank their tea and ate their desert and Harry was filled with a warmth of wellbeing, happy to have his best friends after the last year and a half. And he was more than grateful that it seemed they had accepted his friendship with Draco. So if he wasn’t telling them that he might also be starting to have feelings other than friendship for the l blonde, then he could swallow the niggling guilt about it for now. He’d tell them only if something ever came of it. Which he hoped it would. </p><p>And he hoped they would be just as accepting of it as they were of his friendship. He rather thought that Hermione would be, if the knowing looks she kept giving him were any indication. She truly was too perceptive for her own good. Of course he probably wasn’t being as conspicuous as he thought he was. He had rather passionately defended Draco more than once that evening whenever Ron brought up Draco’s past. Sighing, he drank the rest of his tea before setting down the empty mug and standing. </p><p>“I should probably get going,” he said as he stretched the kinks out of his back from sitting for so long. “Robards is a bastard and scheduled an early morning progress meeting for tomorrow. About that big potion smuggling ring I told you about.”</p><p>“On a Sunday?” Ron asked incredulously, as he stood too, Hermione standing from her chair across from them.</p><p>Harry nodded, “Like I said, Robards is a bastard.” </p><p>Harry exchanged a back slapping hug with Ron along with a “Good night, mate.” Turning to Hermione he let her wrap him in a warm hug, her curls tickling his nose a little.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Ron will come round. He just needs a bit of time to adjust to the idea. You know he won’t abandon you. Not again,” she whispered quietly. Harry felt a lump of emotion in his throat as he squeezed her a bit tighter. “I know,” he whispered. And again he thought of how immensely grateful he was to have her as a friend.</p><p>“Good night, Harry,” she told him as he let her go. </p><p>“Good night, Hermione,” he said and then spun on his heel into space.</p>
