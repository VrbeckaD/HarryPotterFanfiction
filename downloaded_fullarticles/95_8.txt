    <p>In hindsight, James will admit that there were probably a number of other ways- better ways- to have gone about asking the girl for help, but he’s been watching, waiting, for quite sometime now, nervous energy buzzing underneath his skin like a thousand ants until she walks in.</p><p>“You’re the village witch, right?” he ended up blurting out over the counter, and they both freeze.</p><p>She turns around, ever so slowly, eyes dark green and dangerous and he swallows heavily. This is it, he thinks, she’s going to turn me into a toad.</p><p>The woman- girl, he now realises with a start- slinks over, slow and graceful, and though she stands nearly a foot shorter than him, he can’t help but take a step back, clipping his elbow on the espresso machine.</p><p>She looks nothing like the what he expected the village witch to look like, no warts or hooked nose, instead her skin fair and creamy, with dark red hair that looks like it was kissed by hellfire itself, glittering copper in the dim lights of the coffeeshop, dotted with sprigs of holly and mistletoe even though it’s just barely fall.</p><p>She’s beautiful in a deadly sort of way.</p><p>“Who told you that?” she asks, a voice like the wind that rattles wind chimes and blows of roofs at the same time.</p><p>Despite the fear he feels tracing down the line of his spine, James steels himself and says, “I hear things. A witch on the hill, hidden by brambles and briar bushes and perhaps something a bit more sinister.”</p><p>She hums noncommittally and looks around the shop. It’s empty, as per usual for a Tuesday afternoon, and she flicks her wrist, sending the jet of hot water into a waiting mug. “I wouldn’t call Aurora particularly sinister,” she says, while her stares at the cup of tea making itself, completely godsmacked. “Tetchy, perhaps, and cold towards strangers, but not sinister.”</p><p>The cup floats over to her and she fixes it right, adding milk and honey from a vial she seemed to have procured out of thin air. “How’d you know it was me?” she says, seemingly unbothered that James is two steps away from collapsing due to shock.</p><p>He doesn’t want to tell her that he’s seen her before in town, just glimpses here and there while she visits the market, never making conversation. He knows everyone in this town, except for her, who doesn’t seem to live here, not even when he followed her.</p><p>“Wild guess,” he shrugs, hoping that she believes it.</p><p>“Uh huh,” she says, lips twitching. Very carefully, she places her teacup down on the counter and leans forward, steepling her fingers together. The way she looks at him makes him feel like she can see right through him and James struggles not to fidget. He can feel that current flowing through him again, but it’s different this time, something lighter and strange.</p><p>She lifts a single eyebrow after she’s done giving him a once over, and asks, “So, what do you want?”</p><p>“Beg your pardon?”</p><p>“I’m the village witch,” she says with a roll of her eyes, “People don’t come askin’ for me unless they want something, so out with it.”</p><p>“Right, er,” he rubs the back of his neck, “Do you do protection spells against Black magic?”</p><p>“What kind of black magic?”</p><p>“Black magic.”</p><p>“Oh,” she pauses, scrutinising him once more, “Got yourself in a spot of trouble hmm?”</p><p>“It’s not for me,” he’s quick to say, “It’s for my mate. I’m worried about him. He, ah- there was a fallout between them, a long time coming really, but I’m worried they might retaliate.”</p><p>She hums again, sipping her tea. “Why isn’t this friend asking me himself then?”</p><p>“Because he’s too bloody proud.”</p><p>“And you’re too bloody noble, is that it?” she says, head tilted to the side and she looks him as though he’s a hard fill on the Sunday crossword.</p><p>“If it’s noble to look out for my best mate’s well being then so be it,” he snaps, taking a step closer.</p><p>Her laugh it silverry, and he swears he feels a light breeze caress his skin. “Noble and mouthy,” she teases, propping up her chin. “I should turn you into a frog for the impertinence.”</p><p>This time it’s him that scrutinises her, giving her a quick up-down before finally asking, “Can you really do that.”</p><p>She falters. “Well, no actually. I’ve never really tried. I did however turn someone into a tortoise.”</p><p>“Lovely.”</p><p>She bares her teeth in a shark like grin. “Of course I am.” She slides off the stool and begins making her way to the exit just as a couple walks in. “Come find me Saturday, Potter. And bring something that belongs to your friend.”</p><p>“How’d you know my name?” he asks, looking warily at her. The last thing he needs is the local witch being a mind reader too.</p><p>Instead she just smirks and nods at his chest. “Name tag.”</p><p>His hand comes up on it’s own accord to brush against the cool metal and he flushes dully. “Right,” he says. “And what about you? What’s your name? Fair’s fair after all.”</p><p>She looks mighty amused by now. “Lily.”</p><p>“Like the death flower,” he muses out loud, and she cackles.</p><p>“Exactly, like that,” she winks, and then she’s gone, just vanishing into nothingness, leaving a half empty cup of tea that’s already cold and the lingering scent of something sweet and floral in the air.</p><p>-</p><p>James sneaks out early Saturday morning and begins his trek to find the witch. It isn’t as hard as he thought it would be, taking him only twenty minutes before he’s stood in front of a quaint little cottage.</p><p>It looks like what he thought a witch’s house would look like, if he’s being honest. Small and made out of stone, bundles of flowers and herbs clipped up to dry, and he swears the trees all stare at him while he walks up the beaten path to the door. There’s even a mailbox, red paint faded and flaking, with the name ‘Evans’ crudely carved into it in what looks like a child’s handwriting.</p><p>He has to knock three times before she appears, jerking it open forcefully and squinting sleepily up at him.</p><p>“What the fuck,” she says, flat, though the end is caught on a yawn.</p><p>It’s obvious that she just woke up, wearing an oversized sweater with the sleeves covering her hands, and her hair is a veritable bird’s nest, still peppered with flowers. Baby’s breath this time if he’s not mistaken.</p><p>She looks adorable if he’s being honest, and then he wants to slap himself, because did he really just think of her as adorable?</p><p>“You told me to come by on Saturday!” he defends himself, and she slumps against the the doorframe, pinching the bridge of her nose.</p><p>“Yeah, but not at the crack of dawn,” she mutters, “Jesus.”</p><p>“Can you say that?”</p><p>Lily glares balefully at him. “I’m a witch, not a demon. I’m not going to burst into flames for saying it.”</p><p>“Right. Sorry. Stupid question,” he says, feeling himself flush.</p><p>She sighs before pushing herself up and walking back into the house, leaving James standing there awkwardly. It’s only when she gets to the end of the corridor does she turn around and say, “Well what are you waiting for? An invitation?”</p><p>James jumps at that, and scurries inside after her, slamming the door shut. He can’t be sure, but he thinks he hears a tinny voice laugh  at him.</p><p>The inside of her house is a mess. There are vials and bottles and jars everywhere; on the bookshelf, the cupboards, he even spots a few in the fridge when she opens it to pull out the eggs.</p><p>“Breakfast?” she asks, cracking them directly in the pan. He’s certain a few shards of shell get in there as well.</p><p>“No thank you,” he declines, setting his bag on the wooden table and sitting.</p><p>“Suit yourself,” she shrugs. She ends up making him a cup of peppermint tea though, and when she sits down next to him he sees that her eggs are runny and her toast burnt, and he has to bite back a smile. Seems like not even magic can help her cooking skills. Or lack thereof.</p><p>He jiggles his leg while she eats, and tries not to be too obvious as he checks out the place. She must notice though, for she asks, “So your friend is Sirius Black?”</p><p>“Someone did their homework.”</p><p>“Nah. I just talk a lot to the town gossip. I read her palm, she pays me in free drinks and the newest tales of who’s shacking up with who.” She wipes her mouth with a napkin. “So, what’d you bring for me to work with?”</p><p>He fumbles with his bag in his haste before pulling out one of the many worn leather bands Sirius wears on his wrists and passes it over to her. Lily takes it with dainty fingers and examines it, pushing her chair back as she putters around her kitchen. James intends on staying to watch her, but when the scent of incense becomes too cloying, he excuses himself to the sitting room.</p><p>There’s a fat ginger cat curled up on one of the cushions, and it eyes him warily when he sits on the other end. He can just barely make out the name etched on the collar, but soon learns that this is the mysterious Aurora she mentioned. He reaches out to pet her, and she hisses, swatting at him before bounding away.</p><p>The sitting room is like the kitchen, messy and confusing with her things strewn everywhere, but it’s more knickknacks and magazines than spellbooks and potions.</p><p>He’s flipping through one of her issues of Vogue- there’s a number of random things circled and highlighted that he rather not think about- when Lily reappears, soot smudged on her cheek and still drowning in that ridiculous sweater.</p><p>“Here,” she says, handing over the band, as well as a small cylindrical pendant. “Bury that in your backyard tonight while saying his full name over and over.”</p><p>“We don’t have a backyard.”</p><p>“Then bury it in a flowerpot,” she retorts, “Find some dirt in your house and pop that sucker in.”</p><p>He can’t help but snort. “Customer service isn’t your strong suit I’m guessing.”</p><p>“Shut up and get out of my house,” she quips, though he spots a smile threatening to show.</p><p>He puts both of the things back in his bag and is just about to do so when he stops, pulling out his wallet. “What about payment?” he asks, already got a wad of tenners in his hand.</p><p>She waves him off. “I haven’t come up with one as yet, but when I do,” she pulls a scrap of paper out of thin air and hands it over to him, “I’ll text you.”</p><p>“You have a phone?”</p><p>Lily rolls her eyes. “Goodbye Potter,” she says and he can’t help but grin as he walks out, waving over his shoulder.</p><p>“Ta Evans,” he says, and there’s the sound of something crashing to the ground followed by a particularly loud swear.”</p><p>He sees Lily a few days later at his shop, wearing a floral sundress with her hair done up in a long, thick braid. Her trademark flowers are woven into it, lovely blue on red.</p><p>“On the house,” he says, sliding over a cinnamon chai to her.</p><p>She accepts it without a word, taking a huge gulp before finally saying, “This isn’t my payment.”</p><p>“I know. You didn’t text me.” He doesn’t mean for his voice to come that whiny, but it does, and she picks up on it if her smirk is anything to go by.</p><p>“Wanted my attention that badly, Potter?”</p><p>He bites his tongue. While Sirius doesn’t know about the spell hidden in their kitchen garden, he does know that James has been infatuated with her since.</p><p>“Course not,” he scoffs, feeling his ears warm. “I just don’t like to owe people, is all.”</p><p>She still doesn’t seem to buy it, and leans forward to pat his cheek. She smells clean, like soap, and there’s still that floral undertone clinging to her skin. “Whatever you want to tell yourself.”</p><p>He huffs and goes back to behind the counter to serve the customer that just walked in, flipping her off subtly behind his back as he goes. She laughs, and it flows over him like a stream, cool and lovely.</p><p>Somehow, Lily Evans weaves her way into his life.</p><p>She comes to the shop almost every other day, even if it’s for just a couple minutes, and James finds himself in her house more often than not. It starts because he’s adamant that she cannot be trusted to feed herself, and then continues because, well, she might not admit it but she likes the company. He figures things might get lonely with no one else besides a cat.</p><p>(Of course, Sirius barks out a laugh when he tries to tell him this.</p><p>“Right. Yeah. Definitely. You are totally not spending time with her because you’ve got a crush. Nope, not at all.”</p><p>James hits him in the face with a pillow, but he still can’t help but blush when he sees Lily the next day, smiling and joking with him.)</p><p>So he might have a bit of a crush on her.</p><p>No biggie.</p><p>He can live with that.</p><p>At least, that’s what he thinks until she bursts into the shop one day.</p><p>“I’ve figured out your payment,” she blurts, pulling on a stray string on her sleeve. It’s the first time he’s seen her nervous, pale and withdrawn and unable to meet his gaze. Under normal circumstances he would tease her because of this, but now he just feels his heart sink.</p><p>“Oh,” he says, frowning. He tries not to let his disappointment show. Once she’s decided what it is she wants from him there’ll be no reason for him to keep hanging out with her. He might think that they’re friends, but that doesn’t mean she does. Who knows, she might like being alone all the time. Maybe Sirius was right. He should have gotten over her before things got too deep.</p><p>So consumed he is by his own thought that he doesn’t even notice when Lily takes a deep breath, squaring her shoulders until she says, all at once, “I want us to go out for dinner. As a, um, date.”</p><p>James blinks.</p><p>Well he certainly wasn’t expecting that.</p><p>He attempts a smirk, but he’s certain he’s far too giddy to get it right. “You asking me out Evans?”</p><p>“Maybe. I mean, obviously you don’t have to if you don’t want to. We can always figure out something else-”</p><p>He rounds the counter to take her hand, stopping her from rambling even further, and that’s when she finally looks up at him, eyes wide and ready to swallow him whole.</p><p>“I want to,” he assures her, squeezing her hand. “I want you.”</p><p>Her responding grin could blind him, and she’s actually floating before his eyes, hovering just a few inches off the ground, and then she throws her arms around him, pulling him close.</p><p>Her mouth is warm, tentative even, quite unlike the Lily Evans he’s come to known these past few weeks, all fire and brimstone, but when he cups her jaw, stroking her cheek with his thumb, she appears, relaxing beneath him. She tastes like sunshine and wonder when he licks into her mouth, and he can feel the shared current running through them both, humming under his skin, making his ears ring and he just holds her tighter.</p><p>She’s still grinning when they break apart, and she brushes his hair back. “I want you too,” she mumbles shyly, and he smiles, nosing her cheek softly.</p><p>“Of course you do. I’m a catch.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s that laugh again, that wonderful silver laugh that he loves so much and his heart flips in his chest when she tugs him back again in another kiss, because Lily Evans may be a witch, but she’s also his, and nothing can top that.</p>
