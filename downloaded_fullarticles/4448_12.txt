    <p>In a meeting room, people are discussing angrily while Hideyoshi and Kaneki watch on both wearing lovely yukatas.</p><p> </p><p>“Why couldn’t he marry a nice pureblood witch?”</p><p> </p><p>“This is an outrage!”</p><p> </p><p>“I rather that he marry a muggle-born or a muggle rather than that monster!”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s no surprise that he’s marrying her, he was raised by her species”</p><p> </p><p>“But he still should have chosen a lady of his kind!”</p><p> </p><p>“I agree! How disgusting!”</p><p> </p><p>“He put an end to the dark lord...and he chooses a dark creature as a bride!”</p><p> </p><p>“Whomever he chose to marry is his business”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s our business when our hero could be in danger!”</p><p> </p><p>“But she hurt no one! And the people of her species who raised Harry didn’t harm him!”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, he’s lucky! He survived a death curse after all! He should have married a witch instead!”</p><p> </p><p>Kaneki shouts out "Everyone quite down Mr. Nagachika has something to say!"</p><p> </p><p>" 'Neki I know that this is a formal place but please call me Hide no matter where we are..." said Hide as he puts his hands over his head.</p><p> </p><p>Kaneki blushes as he rolled his mismatched eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"Anyway, I need to remind you council that I'm the Minister of Japan's Magic, my people have a deep alliance with the ghouls if you allow marriage between the magic folk and the muggles, why not werewolves? or Vampires? or Giants? or heh Ghouls?... Look I understand that you're afraid of ghouls because they eat human flesh...but they don't really have a choice, sure they are some dangerous ghouls out there but ghouls have as many dangerous criminals like them, muggles and we, wizards &amp; witches..." said Hide.</p><p> </p><p>"Well yes but the ghouls will---"</p><p> </p><p>Hideyoshi interrupts the member. "I'm not finished Sir, and please remember that the ghouls help you guys with your war with the Voldy-Morty guy...or whatever that geezer's name was!!! If you guys of the British Ministry won't be cool &amp; allow this marriage or even hurt Hinami...<strong><em>I'll break our alliance and I'll take Lord Potter with me...</em></strong>" said Hide with <em><strong>an angry face that even scares Kaneki.</strong></em> </p><p> </p><p>Everyone stared in shock.</p><p> </p><p>Hide then goes back to his cheerful face.</p><p> </p><p>"So guys, be cool... and please trust Mr.Kingsley," said Hideyoshi pointing at him.</p><p>~~~</p><p> </p><p>An 18-year-old Harry and a 23-year-old Hinami stared at each other happily as they hold their hands together.</p><p> </p><p>Harry allows her to gently wrap around him with the upper parts of her kagune.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry that a lot of people treat you in such a way,” said Harry looking at her sadly.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s ok, it doesn’t matter what others think of me, besides I know others still support me, our friends, their families and our family still have our backs...and the Ministry is helping us,” said Hinami kisses his lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes...the <em>last thing the Ministry needs is another war so soon </em>and they respect the ghouls for helping me and helping those who fought against Voldemort...” said Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, that,” said Hinami looking down sadly remembering the people who died fighting the dark wizards &amp; witches, the fallen magic folk, ghouls, and creatures of human intelligence...</p><p><br/>“Besides <strong><em>Hide is Japan's Minister of Magic</em></strong>, and <b><em>if they hurt you, they hurt the alliance British Ministry have with Japan’s magic folk</em> </b>...So even if those pureblood families don’t respect you, you will be safe, <b> <em>Kaneki &amp; you protected me many times...now it’s my turn to protect you...</em> </b>” said Harry hugging Hinami and kissing her.</p>
