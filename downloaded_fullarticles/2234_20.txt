    <p>
  <span>Anthony Goldstein was Jewish. That meant a lot of things, really, and most of them important, but in the context of his soulmate, it meant that one of the subjects touched upon in Hebrew school was that he could end up switching bodies with his soulmate from the exact moment he turned thirteen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t just in the abstract, either. It had happened to his Uncle Isaac, and to his Aunt Miri. Both of their soulmates had been Jewish even then, but both of their soulmates were also substantially older than them. Uncle Isaac had had the added minor emotional trauma of finding out that he was bisexual by finding himself in the body of a seventeen-year-old Muggleborn boy in America. Even though Aunt Miri’s soulmate had been eighteen at the time, at least she’d known she was attracted to boys – and she’d been in Britain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His father warned him that it might not happen for years; not just because Uncle Dan and Uncle Iain had been older when it had happened for them, but because it hadn’t happened for him until he’d been seventeen for some months – and Anthony’s mother was only a few months younger than his father. Being Jewish, after all, didn’t mean your soulmate was Jewish, or – if they were – that they’d been Jewish at thirteen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Anthony only felt mildly disappointed when nothing happened when he turned thirteen, even though he’d told Terry and Michael that it could. Just so they’d be prepared. It didn’t happen the next year, or the year after that, so Anthony came to terms with the fact that </span>
  <em>
    <span>whoever</span>
  </em>
  <span> his soulmate was, muggle or witch or wizard, they were either younger than him, or not Jewish (or not Jewish </span>
  <em>
    <span>yet).</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t know why he expected anything to happen when he turned seventeen, and with the war brewing, Anthony could only hope that finding his soulmate held off a few more years. At least until the end of the war. There was even an actual battle with actual Death Eaters at Hogwarts and Dumbledore was murdered on campus. If that wasn’t a sign for things to calm the fuck down, he thought as he visited his fellow D.A. members in the hospital wing, it was surely something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville said something to the same effect. “You know, I turn seventeen in July. I couldn’t imagine – I hope my soulmate is younger than me. But at the same time – maybe the sooner, the better? Before things get any worse, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s assuming your soulmate lives in Britain,” Anthony said. “My uncle’s soulmate is American.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville buried his face in his hands. “This is too much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anthony wanted to say that he was sure it’d all work out, but, well, he wasn’t sure of that at all.  All he was sure of was that Zacharias Smith wasn’t his soulmate, because Zach’s birthday had come and gone, and he felt no small relief that that.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It turned out that Anthony didn’t have long to wait. Things were stressful at home, and his parents were discussing making aliyah or maybe emigrating to live with his uncles in America, and he went to bed feeling depressed. He fell asleep, as he always did in the summer, in his bedroom in his parents’ house in Golders Green.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He fully anticipated waking up in the same room, so when he found himself in a smaller bed the next morning, he opened his eyes to see a wholly unfamiliar room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His first thought was, </span>
  <em>
    <span>so much for waiting until after the war.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The second was that there was entirely too much red and gold for his soulmate not to be a Gryffindor. The third was that there were several rare and unusual plants. The fourth, of course, was, </span>
  <em>
    <span>wait, isn’t today Neville’s birthday?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d always assumed Neville to be straight. But he knew all of the Gryffindors in his year (it wasn’t hard; there were only eight of them). Most of them had turned seventeen already. Except, that was, for Neville Longbottom and Harry Potter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So he looked around the room and found a mirror.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking back at him was Neville Longbottom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, at least his soulmate wasn’t American.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Neville Longbottom knew, in his heart of hearts, that his soulmate had to be Luna Lovegood. And Luna was half a year younger than him. So he </span>
  <em>
    <span>really</span>
  </em>
  <span> didn’t expect anything unusual on his seventeenth birthday. He knew his gran was hoping that he’d find himself partnered with some clever, brave, talented Gryffindor girl (someone like Hermione, really, only not </span>
  <em>
    <span>actually</span>
  </em>
  <span> Hermione, because Neville would never survive </span>
  <em>
    <span>that).</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He certainly didn’t expect to wake up in another bedroom. Well, he supposed, at least he’d been born in the middle of the night, and he and his soulmate had both been asleep. Injuries regarding soulmate switches weren’t exactly uncommon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t think he could be blamed that his first reaction was to check that he was still in his own body by feeling his chest (flat), groin (definitely a man), and then, when he was thoroughly confused, looking at his hands to try to get any answer of that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They weren’t his hands, that was for sure. His own fingers were longer, his own hands calloused from work in the greenhouses. These hands were smooth, and the fingers shorter and slimmer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which meant, somehow, that his soulmate was another wizard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which didn’t make any sense at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville was </span>
  <em>
    <span>straight.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He lifted up his shirt and looked down. Definitely a wizard’s chest. But not his. He looked down the pyjama pants, just to check, and – yes, that was </span>
  <em>
    <span>definitely</span>
  </em>
  <span> a penis. Definitely not his, but a penis nevertheless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, this was bad. He didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>like boys,</span>
  </em>
  <span> not like that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe if he tried to go back to sleep, it would all go away. Yes. That was it. This was just some bizarre dream, fuelled by anxiety and a sense of dread, and of </span>
  <em>
    <span>course</span>
  </em>
  <span> Luna was properly his soulmate, because he was straight. He’d go back to sleep, and then he’d wake up in his own bed in his own body like none of this had ever happened, because none of this </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> happening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Neville woke up again, he was still in the same room, and presumably still in the same body (but he didn’t check this time). He didn’t let himself think about what that meant. He was straight. He was in love with Luna. He wanted to kiss and touch and hold </span>
  <em>
    <span>Luna.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Not – whoever this was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He needed to get to an owl, so he could send an owl to himself. He didn’t want to risk Floo when he didn’t know where he was. He remembered, unbidden, what Anthony had said about his uncle, whose soulmate had been in </span>
  <em>
    <span>America.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Britain was in the middle of a war, and Dumbledore had just died just a month before. What would he do then? What would his </span>
  <em>
    <span>gran</span>
  </em>
  <span> do when she found out his soulmate was another man?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tried to bury himself in the blankets to refuse to acknowledge the reality of the situation, but he was disturbed by a knock at the door. He didn’t respond, but he poked his head over the covers to keep an eye out. A beautiful, older blonde witch opened the door after knocking a few more times. “Love, are you feeling all right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was Scottish. Neville had never been so happy to hear a Scottish accent before. Most Scottish people, after all, lived in the U.K., and so he’d be able to Floo home. “Fine,” he managed, realising too late that his voice, while not </span>
  <em>
    <span>his,</span>
  </em>
  <span> still had his </span>
  <em>
    <span>accent.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Hopefully she didn’t notice. “Didn’t sleep well last night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He realised with a start that he recognised the witch. She was a Healer at Saint Mungo’s. She didn’t work in the ward where his parents lived, but he knew he’d seen her in Spell Damage, wearing lime green Healers’ robes. What was her name? If he could just remember her name…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know all the talk of emigrating last night was unsettling, but – with what happened to Dumbledore, who knows if Hogwarts will be safe for your seventh year? You’ll need to be able to focus on your exams, and you know your uncle Isaac can get you into the yeshiva for the year. He says they’re rather used to last-minute transfers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville was caught between trying to figure out who his soulmate was (there were only so many boys in his year, after all, and fewer still with Scottish Healer mothers), and trying desperately to pretend that none of this was happening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The witch, as it turned out, resolved that dilemma for him. “Anthony,” she said, and the name shot through him like a particularly nasty hex. He only knew one Anthony, let alone an Anthony at Hogwarts in his year – whose parents were Healers, even. “Bubbeleh, I know it’s hard, but you didn’t live through the last war. It’s just a miracle that your bubbe and zeyde were able to get out when they did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anthony Goldstein was his soulmate. This was almost cruel. Of all the blond-haired, blue-eyes Ravenclaws – why not Luna Lovegood? Why Anthony Goldstein?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to go make lunch,” Mrs. Goldstein said. “D’you fancy anything in particular?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I – I think I need to see a friend from school this afternoon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After lunch,” Mrs. Goldstein said. “And be home by sundown. Apparate directly to their house, and be sure to ask them a security question – something only the two of you would know.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville didn’t have his apparation license, but he hadn’t splinched himself yet. He nodded. “All right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mrs. Goldstein left the room, and Neville tried to force himself to stay calm. He went over to the wardrobe and put on clothes without looking what he was doing. He didn’t care if they matched or even really fit. He needed to get this over with as soon as possible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was about to leave the bedroom to try to find the kitchen (or dining room?) when he heard the distinct scratching of an owl at the window. He looked to find his gran’s owl, so he let her in. She bore a letter addressed to Anthony – but it was his </span>
  <em>
    <span>gran’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> owl, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>Anthony’s </span>
  </em>
  <span>handwriting. So he opened the letter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was nothing to give away what had happened.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Dear Anthony,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I’ve been thinking this morning about our discussion in the hospital wing last month. I feel as if I’ve a new perspective to offer, but it feels impersonal over owl. If you’d like to stop by, we could discuss it in person. I’d offer to visit you in London, but I don’t have my apparation license, as I’m sure you know.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Please reply,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Neville</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>It was </span>
  <em>
    <span>weird</span>
  </em>
  <span> to see his own signature in someone else’s handwriting. He wrote back that he remembered the discussion and would stop by after lunch.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Anthony had been careful to avoid spending too much time with Neville’s grandmother, which meant spending his time in a greenhouse on the property, holed up with the first book he’d seen. He’d known Neville came from an old pureblood family, not dissimilar to the one his own mother had grown up in, but the Longbottoms’ house and grounds were </span>
  <em>
    <span>huge.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He was only mildly surprised to find a House Elf in the greenhouse, tending to some of the plants. He couldn’t picture Neville’s grandmother caring for the plants when he was at school, so he supposed it made sense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anthony had only seen a House Elf once, at his great-grandfather’s house, when he was six years old. His mother had criticised her grandfather’s complacency with slavery, and Anthony had never seen the House Elf again. He wasn’t stupid. He knew Hector Fawley had kept the Elft, and had simply told her to hide when the Goldsteins visited. He knew, too, that there were House Elves at Hogwarts, but that didn’t really prepare him for the reality of seeing one in the Longbottoms’ home, of all places.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He managed to convince the Elf to leave him in peace until lunch, which was served to him in the greenhouse. It was, thankfully, codfish, so he was able to eat it without feeling guilty. When the Elf served him lunch, he asked her to bring him some parchment, ink, and a quill.  He wrote a note to Neville – addressed to himself. He instructed the Elf to send it off. He felt bad using a House Elf – contrary to everything he’d grown up to believe, but it was either ask the Elf, or out Neville to his apparently extraordinarily strict grandmother, who expected him to live up to his auror parents’ legacy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hopefully Neville would come as soon as he received the letter. Anthony didn’t know how long he could avoid Augusta Longbottom in her own home by hiding out in the greenhouse with what had turned out to be one of Gilderoy Lockhart’s garbage books.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville showed up about an hour later. Anthony hadn’t fully anticipated how bizarre it would be to look back at himself from outside of his own body. Was this how other people saw him? His hair was a mess, his clothes mismatched, and Neville, in Anthony’s body, looked panicked. It was a miracle he hadn’t splinched himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anthony,” Anthony said, because the House Elf (whose name he still didn’t know) was nearby. “How good to see you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can we just…?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“First,” Anthony said, “What </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span> you say in the hospital wing that day?” Because there </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> a war going on, and while he didn’t think anyone would actually try to impersonate him or use the Imperius (especially with Neville in his body), it didn’t hurt to be safe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er,” Neville said, “I was nervous about finding my soulmate in the middle of a war a month after Dumbledore died.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you said that your uncle Isaac’s soulmate was still living in America when they switched.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville frowned. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“My</span>
  </em>
  <span> uncle Isaac?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anthony Goldstein’s uncle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville seemed to relax, but only slightly. “You haven’t told anyone?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anthony shook his head. “No. And – here, let’s, er, shake hands, shall we?” He extended his hand for good measure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville hesitantly reached out and shook it. When their hands touched, in the blink of an eye, they were set right – Anthony was back inside his own body, and he was looking at Neville properly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er,” Anthony said. “Do you want to – talk about it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Neville said. “Anthony, I’m – I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>straight.</span>
  </em>
  <span> And I’m in love with Luna. I don’t – I don’t know </span>
  <em>
    <span>what</span>
  </em>
  <span> this is, but we </span>
  <em>
    <span>can’t.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Anthony really hadn’t expected much better. He’d hoped, of course, but he’d known he was bi for years, and even he didn’t think he had feelings for Neville, specifically. He couldn’t imagine how awful it would be if he weren’t comfortable in his sexuality.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All right,” he said. “And – you know my parents are trying to – emigrate, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your mum said,” Neville said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t really – want to go,” Anthony said. “But – you’ll know if you don’t see me in September.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Neville said. “I – I hope you stay safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You, too,” Anthony said. “We won’t let this spoil our friendship, right?” Not that they’d been particularly </span>
  <em>
    <span>close</span>
  </em>
  <span> friends, but… still.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” Neville said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anthony didn’t quite believe him, but he knew better than to argue. He said his goodbyes and apparated home.</span>
