          <div class="userstuff"><p>Severus couldn’t believe how he had gotten in this situation. He tried to move his hands, but the cheeky little minx had chained them too tightly. “Granger,” he growled, calling out to her.<br/>

She appeared, moments later with a smirk on her face. She was wearing a dark green corset and was holding something in her hands.<br/>
<br/>
A whip. He felt his heart race in anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
“Severus,” she said, her eyes flashing dangerously.<br/>
<br/>
“I had no idea you were into this, Hermione,” he commented, grinning wildly at her.<br/>
<br/>
She smirked. “I keep this side of me under lock and key.”</p></div>
