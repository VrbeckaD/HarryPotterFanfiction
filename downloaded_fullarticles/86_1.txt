    <p>London weather welcomed the upcoming holiday season with slush and drizzle, so Harry was not at all prepared to find himself in the middle of a blizzard when he apparated to Scotland. The snow caked on his glasses before he could so much as think about casting an Impervius on them, and it took everything to stay on his feet and not get blown into the nearest snowbank by the howling gusts of wind.</p><p>“Point me!” he said, immediately regretting opening his mouth. The wand in his rapidly numbing fingers refused to settle in any one direction.</p><p>Well, it’s not like knowing where North was would help him much.</p><p>A shadow loomed ahead, and Harry struggled in that direction, hoping it was the castle and not a mirage to lure him into the Forbidden Forest. After what felt like an eternity, he stumbled into a stone wall and stopped, unsure which way to go. Vaguely discerning a movement to his right, he turned to follow it, his flimsy coat helpless against the winter pandemonium.</p><p>The movement turned out to be the statues of two winged boars that flanked the magnificent wrought-iron gates, flapping their wings against the gale. Hermione had once told him they were a reference to an ancient wizard Chrysaor, the brother of Pegasus, and impressed teenage Ron with rather gory details of their life story. Harry vividly remembered that decapitations were involved.</p><p>He had never seen the boars move before. When he reached them, they folded their wings, settling back into their familiar repose. He would have called himself crazy to think they had tried to guide him through the storm, had he not felt the warm sentience of Hogwarts before.</p><p>“Thank you,” Harry shouted, relieved when gates swung open of their own accord. Talking to a gate might be strange, but not a soul was there to hear him anyway.</p><p>Raising his case to his head like a shield, he slogged through the onslaught, guided more by muscle memory than actually seeing the castle. His face felt like a case of a botched Petrificus Totalus overlaid by a Prickling Hex. The stairs were icy under the white cover, and Harry slipped twice before he reached the familiar massive door. To his relief, it opened readily for him and closed as soon as he stepped into the Entrance Hall, urging him lightly from behind. Hogwarts felt particularly alive today.</p><p>The door cut off the sound and fury of the wind. Warm silence scalded Harry’s ears, and the numbness thawed off from his face. Inside, sconces flickered merrily, and a half-decorated Christmas tree stood proud, visible through the open doors of the Great Hall.</p><p>“Who the hell is travelling in such foul weather?” he heard a snooty male voice drawl. “I wouldn’t be surprised if this blizzard destroyed Hogsmeade. At this rate, all the villagers will be battering down our gates demanding entry.”</p><p>“Come now, lad,” said another, more high-pitched and cheery voice, immediately recognisable as Professor Flitwick. “Hogwarts will always provide a safe haven for those in need.”</p><p>Peeking inside, Harry saw Flitwick levitating a golden bauble, while a blond man in a mustard-coloured robe was leaning at the staff table, his back to Harry. The fireplaces along the walls already sported tinsel and intricate wreaths, bringing back the memories of his first Christmas at Hogwarts, of joy and wonder of magic that had become almost mundane by now. Harry traversed the long room to the staff table, looking around with a smile on his face.</p><p>Flitwick noticed Harry first and almost dropped the delicate ornament. “Harry Potter! Come in, come in.”</p><p>The other man turned, revealing the smarmy features of Zacharias Smith, his old Hufflepuff yearmate. At twenty eight, his hairline had climbed so far up his scalp that covering it was no longer possible, but Smith still tried his best with meticulous styling and a copious amount of hair gel. An odd expression flickered across his face before it settled into a wide smile. “Harry! What a pleasant surprise.”</p><p>“Hello, Professor, Zacharias.”</p><p>“Do call me Filius, my boy,” Flitwick smiled warmly, putting the ball on the tree and getting another one from a big trunk. “What brings you to Hogwarts at a time like this?”</p><p>“St. Mungo’s is sending me to monitor Madam Pomfrey’s patient while she goes home.” He didn’t know the exact reason—nor would he discuss it with others even if he did—but Madam Pomfrey would never leave a patient halfway through recovery for anything short of an emergency.</p><p>To his confusion, Smith scowled but quickly recovered.</p><p>“Yes, bad business,” said Flitwick.</p><p>Harry wondered if he meant the Mediwitch’s family situation or the student lying in a magically-induced coma in the Hospital Wing, but before he could enquire, Smith hurried to change the topic.</p><p>“I wouldn’t expect them to send you, Harry. But medicine in general is an unexpected career choice for the slayer of You-Know-Who.”</p><p>“So you’ve said.” As a teenager, Zacharias Smith had had a rare talent to get on his nerves every time he opened his mouth. It only got worse as an adult. Every time they crossed paths—which, thankfully, did not happen often over the last decade—he would make jibes at Harry for being a Healer, as if it was somehow a failure on his part.</p><p>“I recall you being so intent on becoming an Auror during our DA sessions.”</p><p>“Plans change as we grow up.”</p><p>“That they do, that they do. We must get together and reminisce about the good old days.”</p><p>“Sure, Zacharias.” Right after hell froze over.</p><p>“I hope that you’ll find time to visit your old Charms Professor as well while you are staying, Harry,” Flitwick said, sending a sparkling star to the top of the tree. “We are happy to have you here again. Christmas is a special season at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Harry offered him a genuine smile. “Yes, Profe—Filius. It really is.”</p>
<hr/><p>The Hospital Wing was empty except for one bed in the corner closest to the Matron’s Office. A girl around fifteen years old was hovering inches above the covers, unconscious, her golden hair pooling onto the pillow. A half dozen well-wishers’ cards were stacked on the bed stand, under a small Christmas tree with Hufflepuff-themed decorations. An older boy in Slytherin robes was sitting by her side, reading to her in a quiet voice. He stumbled over his words when he saw Harry, who smiled encouragingly and gestured him to continue, heading past him to a small white door.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey—Harry still called her that half of the time despite the invitation to call her Poppy—was bustling around her office, rearranging the potions and medical equipment in the cabinets. A long parchment followed her every move like a lost puppy. Celestina Warbeck was crooning on the wireless, and Poppy hummed along to <em>My Baby Gave Me a Hippogriff for Christmas</em>.</p><p>“Hello, dear,” she turned to him with a smile. Tsking, she flicked her wand and dried his coat that was still drenched with melted snow. “You should have flooed straight to Minerva’s office.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect to apparate right into a snowstorm. Scotland is taking the whole white Christmas theme too far this year.”</p><p>“The last time we had a magical blizzard was back in February of nineteen eighty, before you were born. The castle was snow-bound for four days straight, with no communication to the outside world.”</p><p>“Hopefully, it won’t come to that.”</p><p>“Old Horace was stuck in Hagrid’s cabin all that time, and then spent another day and a half here, ‘curing his frostbite’, as he explained his leave to the Headmaster,” Poppy said with an amused snort.</p><p>“I take it, it wasn’t that?”</p><p>“He staved off frostbite alright. By overindulging in Hagrid’s homebrew.”</p><p>“Hagrid brought some for my birthday last year. Worst hangover I ever had.”</p><p>“All Professors who teach here long enough would eventually come to me with this predicament at least once. Well, except for Severus.”</p><p>“Because he’s the one who brews the hangover cure?”</p><p>“Exactly.” She smiled wryly. “But everyone here has been my patient one time or another.”</p><p>Harry grew serious. “Tell me about the one you have here now.”</p><p>She pursed her lips. “Judith Shaw, Hufflepuff, fifth year. Got hit with Tarantallegra, mostly dampened by her Protego, and then Bone-Liquefying Hex.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened.  That combination could easily kill a person unless treated promptly.</p><p>“A schoolyard fight?” he asked dubiously. Hufflepuff girls were not the likeliest candidates for hurling curses in the hallways. Not that the badgers weren’t capable of aggression, they absolutely were. Harry learned that lesson in his own second year, and then got a refresher in the fourth. But they operated in furtive trippings and open ostracising, not dark spells.</p><p>“Defence,” Poppy said, pursing her lips as if soured by the word. She appeared unwilling to say more.</p><p>“Somebody used <em>this</em> spell in self-defence against this girl? A likely tale.”</p><p>“No, no. The Defence class.”</p><p>“Smith allows this kind of magic?” Harry’s eyebrows rose. Even a Death Eater disguised as paranoid Auror would not tolerate such spells in his classroom, and that one was casting Imperius on students.</p><p>“They were practising shield charms. The student who sent the hex got a detention.” She handed him the parchment from her desk.</p><p>“And she was then stunned?” Harry asked, scanning it. “Was that Smith’s doing? Why didn’t he petrify her to stop the damage from progressing and get her to the Hospital Wing safely?”</p><p>“Professor Smith explained that he’s not a medical professional and couldn’t be expected to know the procedure to be followed in this type of cases.” Poppy’s lips were one thin line by now.</p><p>“And Smith still teaches Defence after that?!”</p><p>“As you are well aware, Harry, he is far from the worst Professor we’ve had on this subject.”</p><p>“I bet this fact is no great comfort to Miss Shaw here.”</p><p>“No, I am sure it’s not.” She sighed and got back to the business at hand. “Fortunately, her vital organs were unaffected. I vanished the deformed bones before solidifying the rest and started regrowth.”</p><p>“I’ll continue with Skele-Gro.” Harry nodded.</p><p>“Let me show you my Monitoring Mirror.”</p><p>She briefed him through the use of the magical mirror on her desk, not that Harry needed that, and showed where she kept all the potions. Lately, whenever Hogwarts needed help from St. Mungo’s, Madam Pomfrey requested him personally, and Harry suspected she planned for him to take over when she retired. She dropped enough hints of that during the recent Dragon Pox outbreak. At least six cases out of the eight, she could very well have dealt with herself, Harry was sure. For all she was just a Mediwitch, decades of experience at a school full of children—playing dangerous airborne sport, messing up in their classes and getting into trouble every year—had made Madam Pomfrey more qualified in all branches of healing than most of St. Mungo’s decorated professionals.</p><p>He followed her out of the office as she led him to Miss Shaw, explaining which bones she had already started to regrow. Her stocky heels clattered on the stone floor, echoing familiarly through the vast Hospital Wing, so different from the never-ending bustle of Harry’s floor at St. Mungo’s with its cramped wards and closet-like offices. As much as he liked his job at the Paediatrics Ward, coming to Hogwarts always felt like returning home. Should she ever ask, he was not going to refuse.</p><p>“And don’t let Mr. Shaw spend the whole day here,” she said at last, turning to the Slytherin boy sitting at the bed. “It’s Christmas season, David. Go have fun. Your sister is in good hands.”</p><p>“I’m fine here, Madam Pomfrey.” The boy looked at her defiantly. “Nobody stayed for holidays except for some Gryffindor peanuts anyway.”</p><p>“Well, be that as it may.” Madam Pomfrey sighed and looked out of the window where the storm seemed to have grown even stronger, howling against the lancet panes.  “I suppose I should hurry before the Floo Network shuts down. I cannot imagine going outside to apparate.”</p><p>“Better not. My magic was all wonky out there.”</p><p>“Hopefully I’m not stuck here. My future great-grandson won’t be putting his arrival on hold.”</p><p>From their conversations, Harry knew that Madam Pomfrey’s husband had died young and she never remarried, but not much beyond that. Startled, he realised he didn’t even know her age. She always seemed ageless.</p><p>David Shaw appeared to have similar thoughts.</p><p>“It’s so weird to think that Madam Pomfrey has kids and grandkids and stuff,” he said after she left with a warm goodbye. “She’s always just... there.”</p><p>“Realising that our teachers are only human is a part of growing up, or so I’ve been told.”</p>
<hr/><p>Harry was confronted with his own wisdom later that evening. Having made sure the next dose of Skele-Gro spelled into Judith Shaw was working correctly, he went down to the Great Hall, mostly to drag her brother from her bedside. He was at the bottom of the stairs when Severus Snape appeared, looking much the same as how Harry remembered him. He was wearing his usual black robes, buttoned up to the high collar, and his hair hung limply, framing his angular face. Years of peace had done nothing to soften those harsh features.</p><p>At least he looked much better than the last time they had met, Harry thought. Lying in the hospital a month after the defeat of Voldemort, Snape had looked like death warmed over with his sunken eyes and his skin that had always looked sallow but never that shade of sickly grey before. Harry had brought him a vial of his memories and a packet of grapes. Snape had rasped for him to get out and thrown a glass in his direction when Harry had not complied at once. Vague hopes of becoming sort-of-maybe-friends shattered with it that day, and Harry spent a long time nursing more resentfulness over that rebuff than their previous adversarial relationship could possibly warrant.</p><p>Years later, he was over his childish offence but still found himself as intrigued by the many facets of Severus Snape as he was back then.</p><p>“Good evening, Professor Snape,” David said at Harry’s side.</p><p>Adopting a polite expression, Harry greeted him as well. Maybe they could finally turn over a new leaf.</p><p>Looking over, Snape was startled to see him, Harry realised, although the minute tension would have flown right over his head in his student days.</p><p>“Mr. Shaw.” Snape inclined his head before narrowing his eyes at Harry. “And Potter. Honouring your alma mater with your illustrious presence?”</p><p>“Something like that,” said Harry. “I’m covering for Madam Pomfrey.” As they walked side by side through the doors of the Great Hall, Harry noticed with some surprise that they were almost the same height now, with David’s lanky frame towering a good head over them both. He always remembered Snape so tall.</p><p>With a last curious glance at them, David went to the Ravenclaw table, the only one set for all the remaining students. The only other occupants were two tiny Gryffindor girls, who smiled shyly at Harry. He had treated both of them in his time in the Paediatrics Ward.</p><p>“Poppy mentioned calling for St. Mungo’s. I’m surprised you took the duty,” Snape said, looking up at the whirlwind of snow raging over their heads. “Aren’t you afraid to get stuck here and miss the adoration of your drooling fans this festive season?”</p><p>“Not at all,” Harry said dryly, ignoring the jab.</p><p>“Over here, Mr. Potter!” McGonagall gestured to an empty place between her and Smith. Harry looked at Snape, but he was already heading to the other side of the table, to sit next to the tiny grey-haired witch, whom Harry dimly recognised as the Ancient Runes Professor.</p><p>Quite a few teachers had stayed this year. Other than Snape, Flitwick, Smith and Bathsheda Babbling, whose name Harry finally recalled, Trelawney was there, beaded bracelets on her wrist ringing as she pushed Brussels sprouts across her plate, as well as Alicia Spinnet, sitting at McGonagall’s right. The former Gryffindor Chaser was almost unrecognisable in her professional robes and straightened hair. She greeted Harry with a warm smile, which he readily returned.</p><p>The table was laden with the delicious food Harry had missed from his Hogwarts days. More options were available to the staff than he remembered the students to have: McGonagall was adding croutons into a bowl of chicken and leek soup, there was some wine Smith was generously filling his goblet with, while Flitwick on Smith’s other side had a platter of cured coypu. Jara from Dai Llewellyn Ward for Serious Bites, the only other Healer who graduated in his year, had introduced this goblin delicacy to him a year into their training. By the end of a twenty-hour shift, Harry could—and once did—eat a roasted flobberworm on a stick, but no food could come close to traditional Hogwarts fare for him, especially during the winter holidays.</p><p>“I’m glad you made it after all,” McGonagall said as Harry sat down and started piling roast potatoes on his plate. “The Floo network went down as soon as Poppy left.”</p><p>“A bit of snow and wind wouldn’t stop me from coming.”</p><p>“A Gryffindor answer,” Smith said from his left.</p><p>“Gryffindors are brave, but that doesn’t mean we take unnecessary risks,” McGonagall said, evidently interpreting his words with more generosity than Harry. “We seriously considered holding the students behind.”</p><p>“I guess they weren’t happy with that,” said Harry.</p><p>“There were a lot of grumbling and complaints, as you can imagine. Thankfully, we managed to get them on the train safely. Another couple of hours, and they might have had to stay here for Christmas.”</p><p>“You think it might last that long, Headmistress?” Alicia asked from her seat. “I’ve never seen such storms before.”</p><p>Smith made a rude noise at Harry’s left and took a large swig of his wine.</p><p>“I sincerely hope not, but with a magical blizzard, you never know,” said McGonagall.</p><p>“I need to leave early tomorrow at the latest,” Professor Babbling said, visibly worried. “This is most untimely.”</p><p>“Such unnatural weather is an omen, a grave omen,” Trelawney proclaimed at her side, raising her gaze to the ceiling. In her red and green shawls, eyes magnified by thick lenses, she looked like a giant Christmas dragonfly.</p><p>“Let me guess, Sybill, it’s an omen of a gruesome death.” McGonagall did not bother hiding the derision from her voice.</p><p>“Always such a narrow-minded sceptic, Minerva,” Trelawney huffed before putting her goblet to her lips with her little finger sticking out. Smith seemed to be not the only one indulging today.</p><p>McGonagall pointedly turned her attention to her soup.</p><p>Above their heads, the ceiling darkened as the storm raged on. His side of the table was decidedly dull. With Minerva occupied in her own thoughts, Harry was left to deal with Smith’s bombastic discourse.</p><p>Zacharias launched into an overly loud and lengthy recounting of the advice he had given Hagrid. Apparently, he used to visit his grandmother’s farm as a child, and this experience made him an expert on the care of all magical creatures. On his other side, Flitwick nodded in appropriate places, his eyes slowly turning glassy.</p><p>Harry found his own eyes wandering to a certain dour-faced professor, who was having a hushed but lively conversation on the other side of the table. Hands flying animatedly, Snape was talking to the Ancient Runes Professor. Babbling was nodding along and scribbling something on a napkin, her meal forgotten.</p><p>“Do you still enjoy your work as Healer, Harry?” Smith asked, as he did every time they met.</p><p>“I do.” As much as Harry loved his work, he often hated it equally, hated the gnawing feeling of helplessness and futility of his efforts. He was not going to say any of that to Smith, who was looking at him with a patronising half-smirk. This was something he only shared with Ron and Hermione, and Jara the quarter-goblin Healer, and only when he was well into a bottle of Firewhiskey.</p><p>Alcohol. Harry eyed the wine longingly, wishing he was not on duty. This might just be the only way to survive this dinner without murdering Zacharias Smith.</p>
<hr/><p>Although Madam Pomfrey insisted Harry make himself at home in her quarters, he still felt like an intruder. Partially for this reason, and because Hogwarts brought back too many memories—some cherished, some best left buried—he ventured for a midnight stroll through the familiar halls. He walked past the Defence classroom, remembering all the professors that taught there: the good, the bad, the ugly, the outright insane. He tiptoed past the History of Magic classroom with its door ajar, where Binns was dozing away inches above his seat, before remembering that the curfew did not apply to him. Stepping onto the Grand Staircase, he reflexively skipped the vanishing step, as if those dozen years away from Hogwarts did not exist.</p><p>There was a flurry of activity in the portraits, witches and wizards hurrying through frames to the first floor. A familiar knight was spurring his laggard pony through the landscape of some picturesque clearing.</p><p>“Sir Cadogan?”</p><p>“I salute you, young hero!”</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Bridge night at Tapestry Corridor! I shall thwart those worthless braggarts this time!”</p><p>“Good luck.” Harry smiled as Sir Cadogan rode on.</p><p>Another figure stepped onto the staircase from the third floor, swaying dangerously as he moved. Harry waited at the bottom and caught an unsteady David Shaw by the elbow. David’s school robe, thrown over a hoodie with the picture of a wolf howling at the moon, was partly tucked into his jeans. Harry was honestly at loss what the boy had attempted to do with it.</p><p>“David? Wandering around the castle after curfew?” Harry tsked. He did his fair share of night-time wanderings as a student, but never so overtly. Weren’t Slytherins supposed to be sneaky? Then again, an unmistakable shape of a bottle bulging the pocket of the robe might have been an answer.</p><p>“‘I’ve been studying in the library,” the boy giggled.</p><p>“Library? And Madam Pince let you in at this hour?”</p><p>“She’s not here until after Christmas. She actually locked it, old ha—Anyway, Professor Babbling is using it and she keeps it open for me.”</p><p>“So you decided to spice up your reading by bringing contraband booze?”</p><p>“Actually, no.”  David lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “It was already there. The Ravenclaws keep a secret stash in the Rerefe—Renefe—one of the sections.”</p><p>“Right. I think we’d better get you to your dorm.”</p><p>“Uh-uh! Weren’t you a Gryffindor? You aren’t allowed to know where it is!”</p><p>“Too late for that, mate.”</p><p>David scrunched his face in sudden dismay. “You aren’t going to tell on me, Healer Potter? Please don’t tell Snape!”</p><p>“I won’t, but only if you promise me to go straight to bed.”</p><p>“I will,” David said solemnly.</p><p>“And give me that bottle in your pocket.”</p><p>With a dejected look, David complied. The Ravenclaws’ drink of choice turned out to be Muggle rum.</p><p>They reached the dungeons without incident. David comically tiptoed past the door to Snape’s office, tripped and was only prevented from face planting by Harry’s quick hand. Despite what Harry said, he did not remember which wall exactly the Slytherin common room was behind since his first and last visit here had been in his second year.  Paranoid snakes could have at least put some tinsel on it.</p><p>Luckily, David knew where to go, and Harry left him at the threshold, where he stage-whispered the current password, leaving Harry with no choice but to learn it (‘Golpalott’).</p><p>The dungeons were always chilly in winter, and more so at night. Harry breathed on his freezing fingers before putting his hands up to the nearest sconce.</p><p>“Still intent on defacing school property, Potter?” The velvety baritone behind Harry made him jump up and twist around. The portrait of dozing Paracelsus was slid to the side, and Severus Snape stood in the opening that led to what had to be his living quarters, cutting a striking figure between shadows and light. Despite the late hour, he was still buttoned up to his chin.</p><p>“Keeping myself from turning into an icicle is hardly defacing. I don’t know how you Slytherins manage in this freezer.”</p><p>“Slytherins are not cavemen. We don’t need an open fire to warm ourselves.”</p><p>“I don’t know. You have to admit, the dungeons look a bit cave-y.”</p><p>The ire that flashed in Snape’s eyes could petrify a lesser person on the spot, basilisk-like. “If there is cavemen house, it’s undeniably Gryffindor, brandishing their clubs without rhyme or reason—”</p><p>“Hey, I meant no offence.” Harry raised his hands in mock surrender.</p><p>“I’m sure,” he scoffed. “What are you even doing wandering around the dungeons at this hour? Reliving your glory days of troublemaking?”</p><p>“Something like that.” Harry was determined not to rise to the bait.</p><p>“I don’t know what Poppy was thinking asking you here.”</p><p>For the first time, he felt a spark of annoyance. “Believe it or not, I’m good at my job.”</p><p>“That remains to be seen. Why aren’t you at Miss Shaw’s side right now?” Snape demanded.</p><p>“I only need to actively monitor her right after another dose of Skele-Gro, and then I just check up on her every two hours or so.” Harry fished out the monitoring mirror from his pocket to show Snape briefly. “And the Hogwarts version seems to be working faster than the one we use at St. Mungo’s, so this also speeds up the process.”</p><p>Snape’s lips twisted in a smug smirk. “It’s because you have amateur brewers working there.”</p><p>Lee was far from an amateur but no potions genius, so Harry had to admit that Snape’s crowing was justified, if uncharitable.</p><p>“And you have amateur teachers working here.” Before Snape took that as a personal insult as well, Harry quickly added, “What was Smith thinking?”</p><p>“A Cornish Pixie with a wand has more sense than Zacharias Smith.”</p><p>“Are decent Defence teachers still so hard to come by?”</p><p>“Minerva announced that the curse was lifted, and Smith’s predecessor survived six years on the job. But the forty years of bad luck are still fresh in everyone’s memory, so there wasn’t exactly a queue of applicants.”</p><p>“When you say ‘survived’—”</p><p>“During the summer holiday several years ago, Marcellus disappeared on his centennial trip to the Bermuda Triangle with the Atlantis search party, and nobody heard from them ever since.”</p><p>“Hope that means they found it.” Harry grinned. Somehow, this isn’t even among the top ten strangest things to happen to the Defence professors in his memory.</p><p>An especially cold gust travelling through the dungeons made the sconces flicker and Harry shiver. Snape looked back into his quarters where the flames were dancing merrily in the fireplace as if actually considering inviting Harry in.</p><p>Harry waited with bated breath, but the moment passed, and Snape seemed to come to his senses.</p><p>“Go back to the Hospital Wing before you fall victim to your inability to cast the simplest Warming Charm and I'm blamed for your death, Potter,” he said with a scowl.</p><p>“See you tomorrow then, Professor.”</p><p>The portrait slid back behind Snape, and Harry turned away, surprised at his disappointment. Did he really expect Snape to invite him in for a nightcap? More importantly, did he want him to?</p>
<hr/><p>The next morning met Harry in high spirits. Humming a carol Sirius had taught him that one Christmas they had together, he took a quick shower in the ensuite bathroom of Madam Pomfrey’s guest bedroom. He was up well before dawn, and it was still dark when David Shaw entered the Hospital Wing moments after Harry finished the check-up on his sister.</p><p>“Here so early? How’s your head?” Harry asked with a wry smile.</p><p>The boy winced, cheeks filling with colour.</p><p>“Do you need a Hangover Potion? I think Madam Pomfrey has one somewhere.”</p><p>“No, I’ve already had one.” The boy frowned and reddened even deeper. “I thought it was you who sent it to me.”</p><p>“No, not me.” It seemed Snape heard more than he let on the night before. “Have you had breakfast already?”</p><p>“Not yet. I came straight from the dorm.”</p><p>“Well, that just won’t do. Let’s go, Mr. Shaw,” he said. “You can visit your sister after you’ve got your most important meal of the day.”</p><p>“It’s so weird when the castle is this empty,” David said as their steps echoed loudly, unobscured by the usual noise of students rushing to their morning classes.</p><p>“First time staying for Christmas?”</p><p>“Yeah. I’ve stayed for Easter holidays a couple of times before, but usually half of the school does too.”</p><p>“When I was a student, we tended to have more people at Christmas, but not by much. I’ve never had a common room for myself, though.” Harry thought about all the times his friends stayed with him instead of going home and felt a rush of love for them, with a self-conscious aftertaste of feeling like an imposition, even after all these years.</p><p>Their steps echoed loudly, unobscured by the usual noise of students rushing to their morning classes. The first sign of life was a hooded figure struggling with the front door, to no avail. As if irritated with a pest, the door suddenly flung itself open, and the person stumbled back under the assault of wind and snow, only their broom preventing them from planting their arse on the floor. The door shut with what appeared to be a smug bang.</p><p>The grey hood lowered, revealing a harassed Oliver Wood, swearing under his breath.</p><p>“Oliver?” Harry called out, going down, a curious David following close on his heels.</p><p>Oliver looked up from the broom he had been inspecting, running concerned fingers over the twigs on the tip. “Harry! Haven’t seen you in ages, old man!”</p><p>“Congratulations on making the English team!” Oliver was a Keeper for Puddlemere United, and had recently been chosen to represent England in this year’s World Cup. Harry, Angelina and George had cheered their old teammate’s placement in their favourite pub along with Ron, who had not shown much loyalty to the fellow Gryffindor Keeper. Instead, he bemoaned the Cannons’ Whistley—a surprisingly promising boy one year out of Hogwarts—losing in the last selection round. Coming from a particularly exhausting shift, Harry had needed only half a firewhiskey to fall asleep right where he had been sitting. From George's account, Harry had snored the night away in the corner. George himself had celebrated with his wife and the regulars and winded up his brother until the early morning hours, only Flooing Harry home after he had lost his fourth game of darts.</p><p>“Thank you.” Oliver beamed.</p><p>“Didn’t know you were here at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m, erm, just visiting a friend.” Oliver’s cheeks reddened. He turned back to glare at the door it as if it had just scored a goal against him. “I have a training session in an hour, and really must be in Dorset now.”</p><p>“I don’t think you’ll be able to leave until the storm is over.”</p><p>“It’s simply not on, mate.” He braved the handle again, but the door stayed stubbornly shut, causing another string of muttered swearing.</p><p>“What’s the commotion, boys?” a voice asked behind Harry’s back. Professor Babbling walked up to them, surprisingly spry for a woman likely in her hundreds. She resembled an onion with her wool robes thrown over a mustard cardigan, which she had topped off with a sweater and an exceptionally long scarf around her neck.</p><p>Alicia Spinnet had come down with her but headed straight to the Great Hall, giving a nod to Harry and David. From the loaded look she shared with Oliver, Harry guessed she was the ‘friend’ he had meant.</p><p>“I really need to leave, Professor.”</p><p>“I would like to get home too, sweetheart, but it seems we don’t have that option.”</p><p>“You don’t understand—“</p><p>“If the castle won’t let you leave, it’s for a good reason, believe me.
