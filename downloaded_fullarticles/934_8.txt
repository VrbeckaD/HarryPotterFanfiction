  <em>
    <strong>June 1999 - Hogwarts</strong>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t believe we’re leaving Hogwarts tomorrow!” Hermione Granger exclaimed, as she dropped herself on the couch beside her best friend of eight years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry Potter simply looked at her and smiled. He wasn’t entirely sure at first about coming back to Hogwarts after the Second Wizarding War. He was afraid that seeing the school would only remind him of the war and the deaths of so many people. But being surrounded by his friends and of course, spending everyday with Hermione, eventually took away the sadness and pain he felt while being at Hogwarts. For the first time, he was able to spend a year as a normal student—well, as normal as the Boy-Who-Conquered as a student could be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it, Harry?” Hermione’s curious voice broke through his reverie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh?” he answered eloquently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you were staring at me. Is there something on my face?” she said, teasingly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh! Sorry. I was just thinking back when you asked me if I wanted to come back to Hogwarts to finish our studies and I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to,” he said with a smile on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m quite glad I came back. I’ve finally had one school year where I was just a normal student,” he replied, the smile still on his face, “And I’m even more glad that you’re here with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t miss the blush that came on Hermione’s cheeks and he couldn’t help but think how adorable she was whenever she blushed or when she felt shy. He wasn’t sure when his feelings for her turned from friendly to something more but what surprised him was that he wasn’t surprised at all for having such feelings for her. If there was one person who was constant and loyal to him, it was Hermione. He realized that he may not have been as constant or as loyal, but he promised to strive to be a better friend to her, and maybe someday she would see him as more than a friend, as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just wished Ron was here with us, too,” Hermione said, a bit of sadness in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know how Ron is,” Harry laughed, “He was never the studious type, anyway. Besides, you and I both can tell how happy he is now that he’s part of his favorite Quidditch team.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I know. I just miss him, is all,” she said as she gave him a smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry had often wondered if Hermione truly didn’t feel anything more for their red-haired best friend. When he asked her weeks after the end of the war, she simply said that they realized that they were too different and that they were better off as friends. He didn’t doubt that for a minute because they did become better friends. The arguments were lesser, there were more teasing camaraderie and he could see they were happier. But whenever he had bouts of insecurity, he couldn’t help but wonder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, glad to know I’m chopped liver,” he said teasingly while he rolled his eyes, as Hermione hit him on the arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey! You’re strong for such a small girl!” he exclaimed, as he rubbed his arm. “I miss him too. But like I said, I’m glad you’re here with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He put his arm around her shoulders, keeping in mind to keep it as platonic as he could. Hermione simply looked up at him and gave him that soft smile that told him she was genuinely happy, the smile that made him want to do anything she asked of him. Giving in to his impulse, he leaned in and kissed her on her forehead. He noticed she briefly closed her eyes on the contact and as he moved away, it took a few moments before she opened them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad to be here with you, too,” she said in a soft voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry desperately tried to tamp down the hope that threatened to surface with that statement. He didn’t want to give meaning to anything she said unless she outright told him she felt the same for him as he felt for her. He was terrified to put his heart on the line but he knew she was worth it. And no matter, whether she loved him or not, he would always be her best friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stared at each other for he wasn’t sure how long until he looked away and cleared his throat. Hermione broke out of the trance and blushed again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So – uh – have you finished your speech for tomorrow?” Harry asked, as he looked at her again. He tried to keep his voice normal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He noticed she was staring blindly at the fireplace, it seemed like she hadn’t heard him until she realized he was talking to her. “Hmm? Oh! Yes, I’ve been reading it over and over, memorizing it. I’m scared I might forget something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He laughed at her, “You, forget something? Would that even be possible?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nudged him with her shoulder, “Of course, it is! You do realize there will be hundreds of people watching tomorrow!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“C’mon Mione! You’ll do great with that speech! You’re not the Brightest Witch of her Age for nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione gave him another smile in thanks for his encouraging words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, as long as you don’t laugh at me, I’m sure I’ll be fine,” she teased.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I’d be the one laughing the loudest,” he teased back and they both laughed. Neither noticed that Harry’s arm was still around Hermione’s shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s go down to the Great Hall. I’m starving,” Hermione said after they finally stopped laughing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, then,” he said as he stood up. He faced Hermione and before he could even think on it, he raised his hand and offered it for her to take. It wasn’t something new to either of them, the gesture. She simply smiled and put her hand in his, just like the countless times she did before. She stood up with grace and they walked out of the Gryffindor Common Room, hand in hand.</span>

  <strong>
    <em>Graduation Day</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Congratulations, Harry and Hermione!” Ron exclaimed as he hugged them both at the same time. Harry laughed as Hermione complained good-naturedly that Ron was crushing her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m not surprised that our Hermione here is the top of the class. What I’m more surprised about is Harry being in the top 10 with the highest grades!” Ron teased.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey!” Harry exclaimed, “It’s because you’re not here to cause trouble, that’s why I was able to study better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, right! I bet you missed me a lot whenever Hermione would drag you to the library,” Ron retorted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked at Hermione as she moved to talk to her parents. Sure, he missed Ron a lot but he had fun with just Hermione, too. It felt like the school year flew by too fast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You fancy her, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s head snapped towards Ron so quick that he almost felt a whiplash. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron rolled his eyes before repeating, “I said, ‘You. Fancy. Her.’”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you talking about?” Harry said, trying to come off as nonchalant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, and I’m the Tooth Fairy,” Ron rolled his eyes again, “I saw the way your eyes followed her, mate. I’m not angry. I’m not even surprised. She’s quite easy to fall for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed, “Then why didn’t you get together after the war?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just too different,” Ron shrugged, “We realized all that bickering the first few years were nothing but just that. We annoy each other too much, and we wanted to change the other while neither of us wanted to change. Sure, we were friends but we weren’t good friends. So, when we had that talk after the war, we decided to try and be better friends first. That’s when we realized we were better off as best friends than lovers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was pleasantly surprised to hear Ron talk that way. The Ron a year ago would have been irritable and irrational about this, but this new Ron had matured quite a bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, nothing like a sister to you, huh?” Ron teased, raising his eyebrows maliciously at Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. He glanced at Hermione again before speaking, “I dunno, mate. A year ago, when I told you she’s like a sister to me, it was the truth then. But after spending a year with her and learning about her more than I have before, everything just changed.” He turned to Ron, “I guess you can say I do fancy her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you planning to tell her?” Ron inquired.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe. But probably not anytime soon. I do want to tell her though, I—” he was cut-off by a pair of arms around his neck and a stream of red hair covered his eyesight. He removed the offending hair from his face and gave Ron an incredulous look. Ron simply shrugged and rolled his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ginny, what—” he began.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Congratulations, Harry! Oh, I’m so happy for you!” Ginny said excitedly. She loosened her arms around Harry’s neck but did not remove them. Harry placed his hands on her hips and gently kept her at a distance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uhh, thanks Gin. I didn’t know you were here.” He looked around and spotted Hermione staring at him and Ginny, a smile on her face. Harry groaned internally. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Great, she probably thinks Ginny and I are getting back together. Sure, how about NEVER?!</span>
  </em>
  <span> He sent a silent prayer to any higher power or deity that Hermione didn’t misinterpret this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How could I miss this? I asked Headmistress McGonagall if I could stay for your graduation since the younger years already left the other day,” Ginny said, her smile never breaking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was growing uncomfortable as every second passed so he gently reached behind his neck and unlocked Ginny’s arms. Her expression faltered at his action. By the time Harry had placed her arms at her sides, she was already frowning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Harry saw the way she was looking at him, he turned to Ron for help. His best friend simply nodded then placed his arm around his sister’s shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you seen Mum and Dad? C’mon, let’s go look for them. I haven’t seen them yet since I got here,” he said as he turned his sister around and led her away from Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you certainly looked quite uncomfortable there,” a teasing voice came from behind him. Of course, he knew that voice. He would know it anywhere. He turned around and came face to face with Hermione, her expression looked like she barely kept herself from laughing. Harry couldn’t help but smile, he loved those moments when she teased him or joked with him. It was a sight far from the usual serious and studious Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well,” he looked at the direction Ron and Ginny went but didn’t see them anymore. “I think I’ve already made it clear to her, FINALLY, that we are not getting back together again. EVER.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione gave in and laughed out loud. Harry joined her and they laughed together. Their laughter might have been too loud as some people looked at their direction with a bewildered expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, dear,” Hermione said as she tried to contain her laughter. “I think we attracted some attention.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rolled his eyes, “When do we NOT ever attract attention to ourselves?” he said in a sarcastic voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s true. You could be reading a book and you would still attract attention,” Hermione chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Exactly! Ugh, for the millionth time, I wish I was just a nobody,” he retorted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s expression sobered, her eyes soft, “If you were a nobody, we wouldn’t be standing here today, Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He felt his cheeks reddened at the obvious reverence Hermione had for him. He promised himself he would show her the same. He was about to say something he wasn’t sure he was ready to say when a dignified cough sounded from behind Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Headmistress McGonagall!” Harry and Hermione exclaimed in surprise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The usually-strict matron had a small smile on her face as she looked at Harry first, then at Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Congratulations to the both of you. I cannot express enough how proud I am of what you have achieved until now. It has been an honor to teach two of the most promising students Hogwarts have ever seen,” she said. It was the first time either teens had seen their normally-composed professor quite emotional.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you so much, Headmistress,” Hermione replied, her voice breaking. Harry simply nodded as he himself felt quite a bit emotional at that moment. Headmistress McGonagall had been one of their most favorite professors, and had been one of the few who had given them solid support from the start.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The esteemed educator then turned to Hermione, “Do you have everything you need before you leave for Paris?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt like his entire world came to a stop and he thought he had heard wrong.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione? Leaving for Paris? </span>
  </em>
  <span>He thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned towards her, sure that his expression was one of confusion. Hermione gave him a quick glance as if saying</span>
  <em>
    <span> We’ll talk later </span>
  </em>
  <span>then answered the headmistress’s question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh yes. All the documents I needed were already submitted to </span>
  <em>
    <span>École Internationale de Droit Universel </span>
  </em>
  <span>two days ago. I simply need to be there personally on the 20</span>
  <span>th</span>
  <span> for the freshmen orientation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is good to hear, Ms. Granger. Should you need any more assistance, do let me know,” Headmistress McGonagall said, pride was evident in her voice. Clearly satisfied, she then turned to Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How about you, Mr. Potter? Have you decided what you will do after Hogwarts?” she inquired.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a few seconds for Harry to realize he was asked a question. He shook his head and turned towards the headmistress. “I, uh, I applied for a spot in St. Mungo’s Healing Academy. I’m still waiting for their response whether they accepted my application.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was shocked beyond words when the strict professor sniffled and hastily wiped a stray tear. “Oh Mr. Potter, I’m sure you’ll succeed in whichever career you choose. I am extremely proud that you chose to go into healing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not bummed that I’m not going into Auror Training?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Posh. You’ve fought more dark wizards than any of those who had been in the force for years. You’ve done enough fighting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry raked his hand through his hair, a blush on his face. “Well, I still wanted to do something to help others, something worthwhile.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione touched Harry’s arm and smile at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Healing is a good choice,” Headmistress McGonagall said. “Well, if you’ll excuse me. I have other students to congratulate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Headmistress,” both responded and watched their </span>
  <em>
    <span>former</span>
  </em>
  <span> professor walk away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry…” Hermione’s voice was soft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry took her hand and led her towards the double doors, leaving the Great Hall and into an empty chamber. He let go of Hermione’s hand and continued walking towards one of the windows that showed the Hogwarts grounds. The sunny day was a contrast to how Harry felt at the moment. He wished the skies would open up and rain to pour down to match the turmoil he was feeling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry…” Hermione tried again when the silence had stretched.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why didn’t you tell me you were leaving?” Harry asked without looking at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s only Paris, Harry. It’s just a Portkey away. A plane or even a train ride. You can come see me or I’ll come home to visit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned around to look at her, her eyes visibly widening at the emotions Harry was sure were written all over his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have never been that far apart and for long ever since we met, Hermione.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know but it’s not going to be forever.” She approached him and cupped his cheek. “I’ll only be there for four years. Besides, you’ll be too busy with healer training so you probably won’t notice I’m gone. The next four years will fly by then I’ll be back home again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry leaned on her touch and exhaled. “You promise?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I promise.”</span>
</p>
