    <p>
  <span>The year was 1948.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Patience Mount pinned the prefect badge onto her school Uniform with a huge grin. Having received a letter from the school a few months prior had Patsy and her father gleaming with happiness. Her father was proud of her and she knew it, not that he would ever say so. Ever since the camp, nothing was ever to be the same. The day the war finished Patsy’s father had sent her straight to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the sake of Patsy's privacy, the headmaster Dumbledore had given a convincing speech on why she was enrolling one year following  all the others. It consisted of why she would be placed into a house and put straight away into her second year. She shuddered as she remembered that horrible day, that first year was one of Patsy’s loneliest and hardest.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It was the second day of school,and not only was Patsy a year behind, she was also a day late which meant all eyes would be on her. She stood next to the Headmaster as he raised his voice to speak before everyone in the mess hall. Patsy had only arrived about an hour prior to dinner time, where she then was being introduced to the student body. She had hardly any time at all  to see her father after being released from the camp. The war had only just ended that very day, her feelings were all over the place, but she knew now was not the time to show them.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It was a brief hug and explanation, then before she knew it she was being thrown onto a bus to Hogwarts. She was twelve years old as her father sent her away, she wasn’t even scared, she had been so empty and alone for so long it no longer bothered her. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Patsy knew she was a Witch, her whole family was, the Mount’s were known as one of the Pureblood families. None of her family members had gone to Hogwarts, her father had gone to Durmstrang whilst her mother had gone to </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>Beauxbatons. The clear cut voice of Albus Dumbledore had broken through her hazy and distraught brain, she snapped her head up from her feet and looked at everyone. All eyes were now on her and the Headmaster. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“We have a new student joining us, due to severe circumstances Miss Patience Mount has been transferred to Hogwarts to begin where she left off. In her second year. Now I know this never happens but this is a rather special case, we must welcome Patience to Hogwarts with open arms. Now seeing as she has arrived a day late, we must sort her into the appropriate house.” Dumbledore said with his loud booming voice, his lie never giving him away as he spoke.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Patsy half believed what he said herself, oh how she wished she could believe it, but there was no going back. She couldn’t focus on the past, it had happened and now she had to move on. She had to keep living. For her sister, and her mother, she had promised them, that she would never give up, and she kept that promise.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Before Patsy knew what was going on she was being ushered to the sorting hat, she hadn’t even paid any attention to the welcome claps as she sat down on a wooden stool. She gulped as she saw every eye was on her, although she held herself together well. Holding herself and her shoulders highly at the mere age of twelve. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She watched as the hat was presented on her head, she was in pure shock at all the eyes watching her she hardly even noticed the hat yelling out ‘Slytherin’. It did not take the hat long to decide which house would suit her best, after the hat made it’s decision there was an eruption of cheers coming from the table she assumed were the slytherins. The houses clapped and smiled for her as she made her way over to the Slytherin table, her knees quivering as she took a seat and was greeted by many of the people in her new house.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The now fifteen year old cringed as she remembered that day, she had come so far since then, in just less than an hour she would be boarding the train and starting her duties as the slytherins new female prefect. Of course she wasn’t the only one but she was the only 5th year Slytherin girl prefect. She was honored to have been given the title, it gave her a different sense of purpose, and between helping out in the infirmary she would be rather busy which she could never complain about. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Patience!” Her father called from downstairs, the two lived in a flat in the east end of England, in the small decrepit ruins of Poplar, “If you don’t hurry now we will miss the train to the Kings Cross Station!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Patsy grabbed her suitcases and ran down the stairs, her other two suitcases were already downstairs, the cage with her owl in it was empty. She had of course named her owl Duke Owlington, amongst her father’s protest, receiving the owl in her third year she had loved the name, she told her father it gave her a joy she loved having in her life. He did not protest after hearing that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Duke knew his way, he loved to fly and she would soon see him at Hogwarts. Besides, muggles would look at her oddly if she was seen with an owl on the train. So she let him fly, he hated being cooped up and him sitting on two trains would do no good for him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father helped Patsy gather her things up, each carrying a suitcase in each hand they quickly made their way to the train station. The two never talked much, never have they spoke of her mother or sister, when they would talk it was only of how she was doing in school. Patsy liked it that way, she didn’t want to talk about it, she wanted to pretend it had never happened, and she didn’t care if that was unhealthy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Together they boarded the train and sat side by side, the ride had been quiet but rather peaceful. Patsy had spent the majority of her time staring out the window, she always loved watching the world pass by and seeing the countryside was always nice. There wasn’t much of it on this train though, it was only an hour and most of it was through the city but she still enjoyed looking at the different sights.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time they had gotten to Kings Cross Station, The Hogwarts Express was leaving in half an hour, so she said a quick goodbye to her father. He had told Patsy in advance she wouldn’t be able to come home for the holidays as her father was going on an expedition this year, he liked doing research for the ministry of magic in muggle artifacts. He was beyond fascinated, and so he pursued his passion, he promised he would write to Patsy whenever he could. Although she did not care if he wrote to her or not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She boarded the train and waved at her father with a slight smile, feeling sad for a brief moment. However that moment was quickly interrupted as the head boy of Slytherin welcomed her and began listing off things she needed to accomplish on the way to Hogwarts. She nodded politely and began doing as he had told her to do, keeping busy was Patsy’s thing.</span>
