  <span>The Quibbler is the most trusted magazine in Wizarding Britain— and with good reason. There’s no one else willing to write what they believe.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The magazine comes every Sunday morning to Grimmauld place, as per Harry’s request. Due to increased circulation, Xeno’s moved from a monthly publication to a weekly one, and possibly to a daily. The fanbase is there, and thanks to a larger, more varied staff, less than half of the magazine is bullshit, now, beating the Prophet’s total bullshit with nearly two-thirds worth of accurate, honest news stories.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It’s on sunny Sunday morning in early March when Harry catches the story on shrinking Magical communities. Luna Lovegood, freelance reporter, writes:</span>
</p>
<p>

<p>
  <em>
    <span>Diagon Alley once was only one strip of a complex and vibrant network of Magical streets throughout the London metropolitan area. Knockturn Alley, a small side street located between Gradwick’s Gardening Tools and the Priscilla’s Portkey Makers, is one of only two remaining offshoots of what was a diverse magical borough, hidden between the bustling streets of Muggle London. One of two, the reader might think to themselves. Knockturn Alley and Diagon Alley are the only two Wizarding streets in London!</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>This is not true.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Through hard work and hours spent combing through ancient maps in the bowels of the Ministry, this reporter has discovered a troubling fact: the Magical world as we know it has shrunk. Well, surely someone would have noticed if we’ve truly shrunk, the reader then says. No! says this reporter. Here’s why:</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>In an effort to remain inconspicuous in the heart of Muggle London, the streets of Magical London are spelled in such a way that they feed off of the excess Magical energy that all Magicals possess, reinforcing the warding of the surrounding areas. Less regularly populated areas receive less access to this excess, causing the wards to weaken and eventually fade, leaving what was once a Magical street in the hands and curious memories of Muggle Londoners everywhere. A curious side effect of the annexing of these less populated streets from Magical London is an apparent loss of memory about anything concerning these former Magical streets, hypothesized to be a previously unresearched backlash to the Obliviate that is woven into most large-scale Muggle repellant charms. We are seeing its effects right now, in the case of Annom Alley.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Does the name not ring a bell? Likely not. The street has been abandoned by Magicals for nearly thirty years.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Annom Alley is located between Quality Quidditch Supplies and the Arnack Apothecary, not forty feet from the Leaky Cauldron. It has long since gone unnoticed, most of its shops closed down in the mid-seventies in wake of the first Wizarding War. After the Fall of Lord Voldemort, the street remained empty, and, in time, began to fade.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>However, there is still hope. The Annom Alley is still accessible from Diagon Alley, though it has fallen into disrepair. With the help of the rest of the Magical community, I would like to save this street from fading completely from our world. The reopening of shops, pubs, and community centers would revitalize this important piece of history, returning it to its rightful place as a fully-functioning part of Wizarding London. Please, do not allow another Wizarding street to fade into obscurity.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry finds himself curious. The concept of an unused Wizarding street is strange to him, especially considering the many uses just a bit of extra space in the community could have. He wants to know more about Annom Alley.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He thinks it’s about time he has Luna over for tea.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>

<p>

  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I read your article," he tells her once she’s settled in and said hello to Kreacher. "About Annom Alley. It was really good."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Thank you, Harry," she says, smiling in her dreamy way. "It’s a shame most probably won’t take up the cause. Wizards, I find, aren’t too interested in enterprise."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I’m interested," he says. "An extra street sounds like a fantastic idea. A project like that could remind people that things are getting better."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"A rejuvenation of the Magical spirit, yes, I thought so, too," Luna agrees. "Unfortunately, all most people just want peace, nowadays. Annom Alley is worse off than Knockturn, now."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Have you been?"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Of course— I took Dennis along with me, for the adventure."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry’s heart constricts.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"How’s he been? I know it’s probably been hard…"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Luna hums.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Better, I think," she says. "Not quite up to his old cheeriness, but that’s probably not the goal we should be aiming for, anyway. He’s taken up painting with me. He’s not much good, but I think he appreciates something to do."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>For some unknown reason, Luna had taken little Dennis Creevey under her wing after the death of his older brother. He’s been living with the Lovegoods ever since.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Well, that’s good," he says. "You and your father are good people, taking care of Dennis after everything."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She shrugs.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"He needed the help," she says, like it was that simple. "His parents— they don’t understand. They can’t. All they know is their son is dead, and Dennis… Dennis can’t explain like he think he ought. It’s hard on him."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Has he… has he seen his parents since?"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Luna shakes her head.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"We boxed up all of Colin’s Magical photos and brought them to my Dad’s," she says. "He hasn’t been home since. I’ve tried to keep his parents informed as best I can about his situation. His mum seems to appreciate it."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Good." Harry nods, uncertain of what to say. "That’s good, Luna."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She smiles.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"He seemed to like Annom Alley," she says. "Seems to think it might become an entertainment district, or something. He talked about this Muggle thing… Sin-eemas?"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Er… the cinema, maybe?"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"That’s it. He said they played films, whatever those are. They seemed fascinating."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"You’ve never seen a movie?"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"No. Is it nice?"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I wouldn’t know," Harry admits. "I’ve never been either. Dudley seemed to like going, though— he always managed to get my aunt and uncle to take him when they had a free day."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Maybe we should go," Luna muses. "I’ve always been curious about Muggle entertainment. They have to get creative, without magic."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Want to? Right now?"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Could we?"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Yeah— I mean, we’d have to find a theater first, and check the times. I don’t know what’s playing nowadays, but— yeah, we could go."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Luna smiles, setting down her teacup.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <span>"An adventure with Mr. Potter," she says. "I’m sure it’ll be exciting."</span>
