Gavebone; NC-18+; Modern-AU; Summary: Mr. Graves never expected Credence Barebone as his newest Foster case, and he certainly didn’t anticipate the challenges that follow Credence’s rare magic. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On most occasions, Percival Graves would have denied Tina Goldstein from entering his office, but this instance felt necessary. It was the seriousness in her tone when she called him the day before, the urgency she had with needing to talk to him; to see him in person. Normally she would call within a week’s notice to have a meeting, Tina was always aware of how much work consumed Percival. Even back in their university days, she knew very well his dedication to business. So it made Percival extremely curious as to what the matter at hand was, that resulted in Tina’s abnormal behavior.<br/>
<br/>
“Graves,” Tina acknowledges him with a particular stare that roiled more of Percival’s curiosity. She had a certain stride to her walk, complete intent on making her presence felt in the large oval office space. As she made her way towards him.</p><p>It quirked a curious brow from Percival’s normal glower. “Tina,” he replies back from behind the large metal desk. He rests his chin on one palm as his right hand signs official documents of a corporate account, he had new assets to seize and deals to be completed before noon. But Percival would always make time to hear Tina out, she was one of the few people he ever kept contact with after graduating.</p><p>Tina makes her intent clear as she sets her suitcase on his desk and brings out a thick file. “I wouldn’t have called you yesterday if it didn’t have your name on it.”</p><p>This statement alone makes Percival lean forward, he quickly looks at the file then fixes his sights back to Tina, “What exactly has my name on it, Tina?”</p><p>“It’s an orphan case,” she breathes out, “They gave me the case file and the only person experienced enough to house this boy is you, Graves.”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t tell me…”</p><p>“They made up their minds on this one, Graves, his case is still being investigated as we speak. He needs a mentor, a person that he can depend on and trust; a teacher, someone like you.”</p><p>“Did you convince the entire department that?”</p><p>Tina flushes for a moment, “Graves, don’t flatter yourself that much. Even I was against them placing the boy in your care initially… considering how busy you are.”</p><p>“Ah,” Percival contemplated on her words. It was true that he was busy, but it’s also been a near decade since Percival accepted a foster case into his home. “He must be a rare case then…”<br/>
<br/>
Tina’s eyes perk up as she cannot withhold the glint in her eyes, the hope he will fully accept the foster case. Unlike Percival, whom had master the art of not giving away his emotions, the ruthlessness of Wall Street and corporate affairs had taught him very well. Emotions were viewed as weakness in the work setting, but seeing Tina look more and more distraught as she explained the foster case, Credence Barebones’ life, it was becoming difficult.</p><p>“Credence Barebone…” The name sounded oddly familiar in his head. “Wasn’t the Barebones investigated for housing too many kids…?”</p><p>Tina nods, “He’s the eldest in the family, the only blood relative to Mary Lou Barebone. We broke the family up before, about three years ago when the abuse scandal came out in the department. But she lured the boy back in from his previous foster family.”  <br/>
<br/>
Mary Lou, <strong>ah</strong>, he remembered her name now. The woman that had a church condemning magical children in The Bronx, condemning the foster system that ensured so many abandoned children from non-magical homes were taken care of. Percival resented people like Mary Lou, after all, he invested into the Foster System to help get it started to begin with. He poured many tireless hours at meetings, talking up plans and investors to give these children a better chance in life.</p><p>Even bringing up Mary Lou’s name brought back memories from fifteen years ago, Percival witnessing The Magical Congress inability to sustain the amount of magical children born in poor areas of New York; children that couldn’t afford to be sent to a wizarding school, or for that matter, couldn’t afford to have their magical gifts. Children born gifted with abundance of untapped magic, but rejected in dogmatic fearing families convinced their children were cursed; these children were orphaned or sold off into black markets. Congress had to do something to stop the influx of abused, orphaned children slipping through the cracks of a failing system and to diffuse the rising tension between non-magic’s and themselves. That’s where Percival’s many connections and ties to both non-magic and magic corporations and business’ became a vital asset to the creation of the Foster System.  <br/>
<br/>
At the measly age of twenty-five, Percival proved to be a powerful business leader and powerhouse among the non-magic and magical business worlds. Seraphina had entrusted so much into Percival, which he felt he had aged far too quickly from becoming her peer. She led the political ends of the magical word, being the president of MACUSA she was able to bridge many loopholes and governance that Percival had no time for, and he led the business side; all of this for the sake of keeping magic children off the streets in New York.</p><p>As if Tina knew Mary Lou’s name brought back unabashed memories she clears her throat, “She beat him senseless, if you would’ve seen him…” She stops herself as her hands shake a little, “He just got clearance from the hospital two days ago, he’s still there resting. He got accepted into the Academy of Arts, he’s a bright boy, Graves.”<br/>
<br/>
Tina became a personal long-time friend of Percival’s, the only person that never desired a single superficial thing from him, only his honestly and friendship. She always had a silver tongue and a sharp wit but the biggest heart, it came as no surprise when she asserted herself into the second lead in the human resources department for the Foster System. Percival couldn’t picture her anywhere else other than helping bring justice to magical children and protecting them. The children were assigned to magical families or those with a suitable background in the magic realm to care for the kids. Tina would investigate and gain clearance before seeking the arrangements for the children.<br/>
<br/>
“How old is he?” Percival asks, finally opening the file to see the first photo of Credence, it wasn’t in color, but the obvious black eye on the right side of boy’s face disrupted his usual cool demeanor. The mushroom cut hair, the sallow in his cheeks; the blatant starvation that was present in his features.</p><p>“Eighteen—that photo was taken on his birthday, when we received the call,” Tina sighs with a weight in her chest that could be felt by Percival. Unlike their counterpart in the U.K., the age of their Foster System ended at the age of twenty-one, instead of eighteen.<br/>
<br/>
The more Percival stared at the photo of Credence, the more he felt the need to know who he was; the boy’s story and what lead him back to Mary Lou’s menacing grips. He takes another photo from the file, this one with Credence’s eyes staring directly at the camera, the hospital background and time stamp showing this was only a week ago. The swelling of his black eye gone down but there was something in Credence’s eyes that reminded Percival of himself in his youth—the unruly hunger for a better life.</p><p>“All right,” Percival sets the photo down, “When can I meet him?”<br/>
