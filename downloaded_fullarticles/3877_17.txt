    <p>Harry was getting tired of wandering King's Cross station alone, looking for a platform that couldn't exist. He was just wondering if he should pull out his wand and tap on the barrier between platforms 9 and 10 when a new voice cut through the crowd, catching his attention.</p><p>“–Packed with muggles of course –”</p><p>Harry spun around, and caught sight of a small group of people, all clearly talking together. A plump woman had been the one talking, but there were four boys pushing trolleys with their own trunks, and a girl holding the woman’s hand. The tallest boy’s trunk had a cage with an owl on it – mottled and medium-bright, not the beautiful white that Hedwig was, but still definitely an owl.</p><p>While he was mentally categorizing the group, his vision swam and suddenly he was seeing <em>differently</em>. Harry blinked a few times, rubbed his eyes under his glasses, and the new sensation didn’t change. This must be color, Harry realized, which meant his soulmate was in the group. The Dursleys had denied the existence of soulmates as adamantly as they had denied the existence of magic, so perhaps he shouldn’t be surprised that the “elitist lie about ‘colors’ – is bright and dark not good enough for them, they have to make up imaginary sensations to boast about?” was true as well.</p><p>He was so disoriented by the sudden appearance of color that he almost forgot to follow them. Soulmate or no, he still needed to know how to get to platform 9¾ and they were likely to know since they were complaining about muggles.</p><p>Their hair was all the same color as each other and rather a different color than most people around him in the station. Fortunately, whatever the color was, it was particularly eye-catching so even when a rush of people cut him off from the strangers, he found them again quickly when the cross traffic passed.</p><p>Taking advantage of the lull, Harry swallowed his nerves and pushed his trolley up to the group, who was now gathered around one of the pillars denoting the border between platforms 9 and 10 and glancing periodically across at something. He wondered which of them might be his soulmate. A couple of girls in primary school had found each other as soulmates early on, and while the Dursleys had made a huge fuss about “homos pushing their ideas on children” and of course about soulmates and colors as a concept at all, the teacher had later that week compassionately reminded the children that soulmates were sacred bonds, and that they should be cherished regardless of gender or social expectations. Harry wasn’t sure he understood the appeal of soulmates or romance yet, but he was kind of hoping his soulmate would be one of the boys just to spite the Dursleys and their lies.</p><p>“Now, who remembers what platform we’re looking for?” the woman prompted.</p><p>“Nine and three-quarters,” the girl piped up. “Mum, can’t <em>I</em> go…”</p><p>“You’re not old enough, Ginny,” the woman interrupted. “Alright then Percy, you first.”</p><p>The boy with the owl nodded and stepped away from the group, marching toward… something. Harry tried to watch, but another rush of people and backpacks obscured his vision before Percy’s destination was obvious. By the time they cleared, Percy was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>After two more boys, seemingly twins, not just by appearance but also by how they’d teased their mother about mixing them up, had also vanished, Harry was still no closer to understanding how they were getting to the platform.</p><p>Harry stepped forward timidly to draw their attention. “Excuse me,” he asked softly</p><p>Ginny’s gasp interrupted Harry, who was about to repeat his interjection louder.</p><p>The woman glanced down at Ginny, who had hidden herself behind her mother’s legs, peering out occasionally at Harry and then ducking back again when he glanced her way. The woman then followed Ginny’s gaze to Harry. “Hello dear, can I help you?” the woman asked kindly.</p><p>“Er, yeah, I was wondering. Do you know how to get...” Harry trailed off, as something in a different bright color flashed in his peripheral vision – clearly he was still slightly distracted by the presence of color.</p><p>“Onto the platform?” the woman asked helpfully, before sending another concerned glance at her daughter. Harry nodded. “First time at Hogwarts, dear? It’s Ron’s first time too,” she said, indicating the remaining boy. Ron was gangly and had a smattering of freckles across his face, and offered Harry a friendly smile of his own. ”Well, it’s perfectly easy. You’ve just got to walk straight at that barrier ahead,” she indicated the next pillar up, the nearest in the direction that the older boys had disappeared. “You can close your eyes if it helps, and it’s best to do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous. Why don’t you go next?”</p><p>Harry nodded, feeling too choked with nerves to answer aloud, and turned his own trolley toward the barrier. He took a deep breath and started walking directly at it. He found himself moving more and more briskly. When he was about four paces away from the barrier, he closed his eyes, bracing for the impact instinct said was inevitable, and kept moving. Six steps later, he cracked his eyes open and realized he was on a platform he hadn’t found by merely walking around, with no barrier to be seen. He opened his eyes fully and slowed to a stop. He glanced over his shoulder to see a brick wall behind him instead, the same texture and color as the pillar he had run towards. Another trolley burst through behind him, with Ron pushing it.</p><p>Harry grinned. Magic sure could do some amazing things. He turned to face the train again. Most of it was the same black he’d always seen, but there were glossy parts in another bright color that Harry couldn’t yet put a name to. Part of the Dursleys’ resistance to the idea of soulmates was by shredding the color-identification books he and Dudley had come home with their first year of public school. Harry hoped wizards had some equivalent that he could borrow from someone. Colors were so vibrant and interesting that he wanted to be able to identify them for himself.</p><p>The train’s whistle blew a warning, and Harry glanced up to see that the clock on the wall said it was only five minutes until eleven, so he needed to get onto the train. The twins from before helped Harry get his trunk on the train and into an empty compartment. When they spotted his scar, they tried to ask about it, but Harry only got as far as confirming that yes, he was Harry Potter, before their mother called them outside again.</p><p>As Harry was getting settled in his seat, he realized he hadn’t asked their names or if either of them could see color. Well, with bright hair like theirs, he was sure to find them again, and he would have more chances.</p><p>Asking about someone’s color status wasn’t exactly taboo, but it <em>was</em> deeply personal, so he hadn’t exactly been prepared to ask them in public on first meeting, especially since his soulmate wouldn’t be more than one person, and he wasn’t quite sure who it was out of the five kids he’d initially seen.</p><p>Out the open window, he heard Fred and George telling their family that they’d met him, interrupted briefly by their mother asking “Ginny, dear, what <em>is</em> the matter?” but getting no verbal reply, before she asked the twins how they knew it was him, and scolded them not to be overbearing.</p><p>The train whistled its one-minute warning, and the conversation outside faded as the boys hurried onto the train. Moments later, the compartment door slid open and Ron poked his head into Harry’s compartment. “Mind if I sit here? Everything else is full,” he explained, with a sheepish smile.</p><p>“Go ahead,” Harry agreed, with a nod and a small smile of his own, before he returned to staring out the window, watching the rush of colors in the witches and wizards’ outfits on the platform, and watching them all recede as the train started to move. He caught Ginny’s eyes briefly, as she chased the train and she looked away abruptly, cheeks flaming into brightness, before she stumbled and fell behind the train. That color was red, right? Or pink? He knew blushing was supposed to be one of those colors from stories his teachers had read to the class over the years. Because blood was red, right? Except when it was blue, that was a science fact. But he was sure blushing wasn’t blue. He really needed to get a color-identification book to study.</p><p>Fred and George stopped in just long enough to introduce themselves properly, and to point out Ron as their brother, before leaving again.</p><p>Ron, like the twins, was impressed to be meeting Harry Potter, and asked to see Harry’s scar, but eventually they settled down into normal, getting-to-know-you conversation. At least, Harry assumed it was normal. Dudley had been chasing off any of Harry’s potential friends for years, so he wasn’t exactly familiar with the process. After the cart came through, they shared snacks, and Harry gratefully let Ron explain all the unfamiliar candies and treats.</p><p>A few other people stopped in, looking for a toad. First was a boy named Neville, who owned the toad, and a few minutes later, a girl named Hermione, who claimed she’d already read several of the textbooks, and watched with interest, then disdain as Ron tried a rhyming spell Fred had given him, which apparently should have made his pet rat have chinchilla-soft fur instead of its normal shaggy coat. She loftily proclaimed that maybe he should try a <em>good</em> spell, or a simpler one, and demonstrated by genuinely fixing Harry’s taped-up glasses.</p><p>Ron scowled at the compartment door after she left for much longer than Harry thought was warranted, eventually complaining “she’s a bit bossy, don’t you think?”</p><p>Harry mentally compared Hermione to Aunt Petunia, whom he’d always thought of as bossy, and shrugged instead of answering. They really didn’t compare. Aunt Petunia was much more insufferable. Ron kept scowling at the door.</p><p>A while later, a vaguely familiar sneering face slid open the compartment door. “They’re saying Harry Potter’s in this compartment. It’s you, isn’t it?” he asked, looking directly at Harry. Harry took a moment longer than necessary before he realized that this was the same boy he’d met in Madam Malkin’s who had proclaimed Slytherin the best house, and Hufflepuff the worst. Seeing in color was a little weird, because he noticed the color of the boy’s pale hair before the angular shadow his nose cast on his cheek this time. Harry nodded warily, eyeing the large, hulking boys who had flanked the familiar one. The sneering boy introduced Crabbe and Goyle before introducing himself as Draco Malfoy.</p><p>Ron coughed, possibly hiding a laugh, and drew Malfoy’s attention. “Think my name’s funny do you? No need to ask yours. My father told me all Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.” He turned back to Harry as Ron’s ears and face and neck lit up in the color that was probably red. Except if his hair was red, maybe his face wasn’t red. Hmm.</p><p>“You’ll quickly find that <em>some</em> wizarding families are better than others, Potter,” Malfoy continued. “You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”</p><p>“I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks,” Harry answered coldly. Even though he’d only known Ron for a few hours, he could tell Ron was itching to say something scathing in response, and Harry was hoping whatever it was wouldn’t escalate the situation.</p><p>It did nearly end in a fight, but Ron’s pet rat scared Goyle off, and the visiting trio fled.</p><p>Hermione came in again as Malfoy and his cronies fled, scolded them for fighting, and reminded them to get changed into their robes.</p><p>When she had left again, Ron turned to Harry. “Do you think Malfoy can actually see color? Who would match with a prick like him?” he asked, baffled.</p><p>Harry snorted in agreement. “Beats me,” he responded. “Hey, this might be a weird question, but do wizards give all their kids a color-identification book like the muggles do?”</p><p>Ron gave Harry a considering look. “Not a book, really. It’s a lens that you can hold over something and it’ll tell you what color the thing is. Not much use before you’ve met your soulmate, but it’s interesting for sure.” He rummaged in his trunk and came up with his robes and something that seemed like a large magnifying glass with a brass handle, except the lens was flatter.</p><p>“Can I see that?” Harry asked, and Ron shrugged and handed it over. Harry looked around at the whole compartment, reading the words that appeared over each object. The upholstery on the seats was maroon. The pattern on the floor was green with yellow. His trunk was shades of brown. As expected, his robes were black. His socks and trainers were different shades of gray, though perhaps he should have expected that, as they didn’t look much different to him than they had when he’d put them on that morning. Scabbers was brown with gray patches and yellow eyes. Ron’s hair was orange. The grass outside was mostly identified as yellow even though Harry thought grass was supposed to be green. One of his textbooks had a cover that was the same bright color as he’d noticed on the train, which turned out to be red.</p><p>Harry handed the lens back, and quickly turned to the corner of the compartment to change into his own robes. When he turned around again, Ron was also peering around at everything through the lens.</p><p>“Sorry if this is too personal, but can you see colors?” Harry asked, not sure if he was hoping Ron was his soulmate or not.</p><p>Ron blinked at him, ears flushing again – and Harry was starting to understand why that color had the same name as the brighter “red” of his textbook cover – and then scowled. “Yeah,” Ron sighed, sounding irritated. “Someone I met on the train. You?”</p><p>Harry blinked at that incongruous response. Weren’t most people excited to meet their soulmates? And he and Ron had seen each other in the station, even though they’d first met on the train. Could they be soulmates? Why would Ron be disappointed about that? He almost forgot to answer, until Ron opened his mouth to say something else. “Erm. Yeah, I guess?” Harry answered. “But I’m not quite sure who it was.”</p><p>"Crowdbound?" Ron asked with a sympathetic smile. “Don’t worry about it,” he said seriously. “I know everyone says soulmates are supposed to be your romantic life partner, but sometimes they’re just destined to be your best friend.” He said this with absolute certainty, but his ears kept getting redder and redder in a way that told Harry he ought not ask why Ron was so sure. “I mean, it’s probably scary to think you may never recognize them for who they are, but…</p><p>“I mean, it was you or one of your siblings,” Harry admitted impulsively, not quite sure if he was interrupting or if Ron had meant to trail off there. “I just kind of saw you all at once, and I’m not really sure who it was.”</p><p>“Hell, I wish you were my soulmate,” Ron grumbled. “You’d be better I think. Huh, who was there this morning?” he mused aloud. “Well, Percy met his match his first year. I don’t know if they’re dating yet, but Mum likes Penny okay. You’re probably lucky it’s not him, he’s rather stuck up. And Fred and George, er, both know theirs. And you’re not <em>my</em> soulmate unfortunately. So if it’s one of us it’s probably Ginny. My little sister. She’s alright, I guess, though she rarely shuts up about anything. She <em>was</em> weirdly quiet today, I suppose that was once we met you?”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “Dunno. We didn’t really interact.”</p><p>Ron chuckled. “Well, either we’ll make plans for you to meet everyone over Christmas, or you’ll meet her next year when she comes to Hogwarts. Then you can see for yourself what she’s like on a normal day,” he said as the train started to come to a halt.</p><p>Harry only hesitated a second, but then the brakes were screeching too loudly for him to reply. On the other hand, he wasn’t quite sure what he would have said. It was weird to think that someone he’d never met was his soulmate. Was she supposed to be special to him? He felt nothing yet: a slight optimism about the idea of having a soulmate and proving the Dursleys wrong, but nothing for or against Ginny Weasley. He wondered how he ought to feel about her.</p><p>Harry easily found Hagrid, who was shouting for the first years, and clambered with his fellows into the small boats that took them across the lake. When they got there, they found themselves waiting in a small chamber with large, double doors behind them, and a small but ornate door ahead. Indistinct chatter could be heard beyond that door.</p><p>Soon enough, a woman appeared, introducing herself as Professor McGonagall, and gave them instructions. She would call them, one at a time, through the door to be sorted into their houses. She would place the Sorting Hat upon their heads and it would tell them where to go. Remaining students would be able to hear the results well enough through the door, but they were not to come through any more than one-at-a-time. It wasn’t an unusual policy, but there was some unhappy muttering about not being able to see friends get sorted. Ron switched from fretting about the troll Fred had warned him about, to worrying what his parents would think if he wasn’t in Gryffindor. Harry didn’t respond. He had never known how not to disappoint his guardians, and he didn’t really have parents to disappoint.</p><p>Sure enough, they could hear the Sorting Hat’s song clearly in the entry chamber. Harry wondered what it looked like, and whether it was really a hat, or some other magical object that was just placed upon heads and called a hat. He waited, getting increasingly nervous, as more of his fellow first-years were called through the door and his own turn approached. He wondered if there was a house for students who just felt a bit queasy.</p><p>When “Granger, Hermione” was called through the door, Ron tangibly relaxed, though he scowled heavily when she got sorted into Gryffindor, his preferred house. Harry felt like he might be missing something. Hermione had been a little brusque, but not that bad, he thought. Maybe she just reminded Ron of someone worse? Like the way Crabbe and Goyle had both kind of reminded him of Dudley except they were lacking the cunning gleam that was usually in Dudley’s eyes. They were similar enough to him that he wanted to avoid them.</p><p>When Harry’s name was called, he grinned nervously at Ron’s whispered, “good luck!” and stepped through the door. He tried not to look at the crowd of students who had briefly stopped their chattering when his name was called, and were just starting to resume in whispers. “Is it really him?” “Harry Potter!” “The Boy Who Lived”. As soon as his eyes found Professor McGonagall again, he kept his gaze fixed on her as he walked up, taking careful strides so his knees didn’t wobble. It was indeed a hat in her hands, but it looked to be in awful shape – battered and torn worse than any of his hand-me-downs from Dudley.</p><p>Finally, he got to the stool she had set up, and sat himself carefully upon it, which granted him one brief glance ahead at the crowd before the Sorting Hat slipped down over his eyes and blocked them out again.</p><p>One argument with the Sorting Hat later, and Harry found himself a Gryffindor as well, though haunted by the Hat’s words that “you would be great in Slytherin.” He made his way carefully to the Gryffindor table, which was cheering loudly, and found a vacant seat by the older Weasley boys, who all welcomed him heartily.</p><p>By the time the evening was done, Harry had borrowed Ron’s Spectralens again and identified the house colors, visible in the banners above each house table, as red, green, yellow, and blue, each with a different pattern repeated in light and dark shades. Gryffindor was red with interlocking diamonds outlined in a paler shade. Slytherin was green triangles alternating in light and dark. Hufflepuff was bright yellow – not at all the same as the grass – with five-pointed stars outlined in a darker yellow that the Spectralens occasionally called gold. Ravenclaw was blue with interlocking circles outlined in a lighter shade, forming a pattern that seemed to shift in Harry's peripheral vision. More importantly, over the course of the evening Dumbledore had made enough announcements, large and small, that there wasn’t too much attention on Harry anymore, and in addition Harry had met a ghost and a poltergeist and talking portraits on his way through the undeniably magical castle. He had friends and magic and colors. The Dursleys would hate every bit of that, and knowing that only made Harry love it more.</p><p>The next morning, while Harry was reading his letter from Hagrid, Ron was reading his own letter, which had been delivered by an ancient-looking brown tawny owl who nearly collapsed into Ron’s bacon after dropping the letter in his lap.</p><p>“Hagrid’s invited me over for tea,” Harry informed Ron, turning to deliver the news. “Would you like to come with me?”</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” Ron agreed. “I’ll come. Hey, Mum’s asking if you, the boy we helped to find Platform 9¾, really are Harry Potter. She wants to know because ‘it matters to Ginny’. How much you wanna bet they’ve figured it out too?” <em>That you’re Ginny’s soulmate</em> went unsaid. Ron and Harry were both hesitant to talk about it too publicly. Harry in case they’d guessed wrong, and Ron presumably because his sister was involved but Harry hadn’t had a chance to ask why.</p><p>Harry paused from scribbling a reply to Hagrid, and glanced sideways at Ron. “Huh. Probably. Think I should write her a letter?” He would do so if only so he didn’t have to filter his responses through Ron. Although Ron was great, Harry was still wary of talking about soulmates aloud, especially when too many people were around.</p><p>“Who? Mum or Ginny?” Ron asked curiously.</p><p>“Er, your mum I guess?” Harry decided. “I could say I’m not sure which of you I saw and even though you think it was Ginny, I didn’t want to get her hopes up if I was wrong? And then if I’m not wrong, maybe start writing Ginny and get to know her.”</p><p>Ron nodded. “Yeah, mum would probably like that.” He grinned, “And then I wouldn’t have to write letters on your behalf.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Harry teased, also grinning. “You’re trying to get out of extra work and we haven’t even gotten our schedules yet.” He re-read his note to Hagrid (<em>I’d be happy to come, and I’m bringing my friend Ron ~ Harry</em>) and sent Hedwig off again.</p><p>Ron snorted, but before he could reply, Professor McGonagall arrived to pass out their schedules and give the first years instructions on how to find their first class of the day. They got rather busy after that, with subjects that were entirely new to Harry and plenty of homework to go with it all, but nothing could quench the warm feeling growing in Harry’s chest that he was finally somewhere he belonged.</p>
