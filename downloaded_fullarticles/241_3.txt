    <p>Hobgoblin traveled the realms and worlds beyond in search of the King's Ruby. A beautiful gem that was able to shift colors and capture the most radiant light. He and his black panther could do many wondrous things, even grant wishes.</p><p>But alas, the wishes could never be for himself. It made him a very wise and compassionate being.</p><p>For 300 years he had searched for the King's Rubies and he swore he was close. Feeling a magical pull towards the human world.</p><p>"Here it is, I just know it!" He was giddy as his Panther touched the ground, gracefully padding its way to the source of Magic. However, Hobgoblin's face fell at the noise it made.</p><p>A high pitched cry emitted from the room. He peered into the window, seeing a baby crying in its crib. Barely able to stand as it cried for attention.</p><p>"This can't be correct? It's certainly not the Ruby." He muttered, easily teleporting himself into the room. His panther waited outside, cleaning itself.</p><p>Hobgoblin walked up to the child to examine them. The baby looked up crying. He was disappointed to not see nor hear anyone coming. He sighed as his gloved hands picked up the screaming babe, bouncing it softly in his arms. With just a wave of his hand, the baby stopped crying. No longer hungry, cold in need of changing for the time being.</p><p>"There, that's better now isn't it?" He smiled as the child stared at him. He curiously saw the lightning bolt scar on his forehead and felt the magic all around him.</p><p>"Powerful little one, even at such a young age." He chimed as he lifted the baby up, looking it up and down. "Let's see what life awaits for you." His eyes blurred as vision overtook him.</p><p>He saw the baby become a young boy, a young boy named Harry. Not even a teenager yet dealing with his fair share of suffering. Raised by horrible and rotten people. He saw the boy attending a wizard school and the adventures and hardships that followed. He also saw the so-called 'destiny' the boy was to lead. To face off against a much darker, older and more powerful wizard.</p><p>Hobgoblin's vision's faded and he frowned deeply. The lines on his face creasing as he looked down at the teary-eyed baby.</p><p>"Oh my...Poor thing. That doesn't seem like a very good life. "</p><p>He sighed to himself as he weighed his options. It was clear this so-called family would not miss the gifted boy. He seemed he would be rejected in the human world as well as Hogwarts.</p><p>"Well, Harry...I think it's obvious where you must go." He chimed, giving the baby a gloved finger to grasp onto.</p><p>"Someplace where magic is everywhere. Where you shall be loved and accepted by all around you. Where all this chosen business won't be put upon the shoulders of a mere child." He continued as the baby babbled at him.</p><p>Hobgoblin's mind was made up. He was certain that Moomin Valley was exactly where this boy should be. And he knew the right family to raise him as well.</p><p>"What is it Moominpapa?" Moominmama softly asked as her husband walked down the stairs in the middle of the night, a light candle in hand.</p><p>"I hear knocking on the door Moominmama."</p><p>"Oh dear, at this hour?" She asked as she followed him. Both creatures made their way down the staircase and to the door. They opened it to find a rather pale, tall and scary looking fellow.</p><p>In his arms, a precious baby with a unique lightning bolt on his forehead cooed at them.</p><p>"Oh!" Moominmama gasped as she saw the baby, her eyes lighting up in wonder.</p><p>"Hello there Sir, how may we help you at this hour?" Moominpapa asked as he eyed the baby in his arms. The stranger handed the child to Moominmama as he bowed with a flurry of his cape.</p><p>"Greetings, I am Hobgoblin. I hate to trouble thee at this late hour, but I'm afraid this youngling needs help."</p><p>"Help? Whatever do you mean?" Moominpapa asked as Moominmama carefully cradled the baby. His chubby fingers reaching for her round nose.</p><p>"He comes from a dreadful home and if he lives there, he'd be terribly neglected. I was hoping you Moomin's could care for him." The tall man informed. Moominmama nuzzled against the baby with a smile.</p><p>"Oh, that's terrible, but…" Moominpapa trailed off at a loss for words when Moominmama spoke up. "We'll take good care of him. He'll have a brother around his age named Moomin." She cuddled the baby to her as he snuggled against her soft white body.</p><p>"Wonderful! Thou shall live a full and happy life with you. His name is Harry. Have a splendid night!" Hobgoblin announced as he bowed and headed back to his panther.</p><p>"B-but!-" Moominpapa stuttered as his wife kissed his cheek.</p><p>"Harry! What a peculiar name." She mused as the baby smiled up at her and the other Moomin. Moominpappa faltered, looking to his wife and then to the parting Hobgoblin and then to his wife once more.</p><p>"Well...I suppose it would be nice for Moomin to have a brother to play with. We'll have to bundle him for the upcoming winter though...He has no fur! I don't want him to be too cold during sleep season." He worried as he inspected the child, petting the boy's scarce hair on his head.</p><p>"That shouldn't be a problem. We have spare quilts in the closet." She rocked him as he started dozing off.</p><p>"What will he eat? What species is he? He doesn't look like anyone from Moomin Valley…"</p><p>Moominmama walked to the kitchen. "Don't fret Moominpappa, all will be well." She said as the baby fell asleep in her arms, cuddling up to her snow-white fur.</p>
