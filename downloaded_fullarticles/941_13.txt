    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>	Draco Malfoy opened his eyes slowly and tentatively as he did every morning, scared of the things he would see and the noises he would hear. But only silence greeted him, as it did every day this past summer. He still wasn’t used to it. Some days he woke up and reveled in the quiet, and some days it was more terrifying than the screams and laughter he had grown used to hearing over the past year.  </p><p>	Normally he could afford to lounge in bed for a little while—well, all day really. There was nothing for him to do this summer and barely anyone to converse with once the lawyers stopped coming around. The first month of the summer was filled with back-and-forth. First, it was thought that the Malfoys were certainly going to Azkaban within a week after the Battle, and they were only placed on house arrest until the paperwork could be settled. At that time, Draco felt a small sense of satisfaction, and in a way, protection. The world was being righted again—justice could still be served. He was so unburdened by this realization that he didn’t even care if order being restored meant his end. </p><p>	The day of his rumored imprisonment, he wrote letters to his friends, and admittedly one to Potter asking him to free Narcissa, and put them on his neatly made bed so that whoever would deal with his possessions would find them easily. He worried they would never be delivered, but told himself that it was a temporary worry—every concern was. He didn’t plan to stay in Azkaban long—not in the way his father did, where he planned to either escape through dark magic or bribery—because he was going to sleep his life away in the cell. He was going to stop eating and drinking, and wait for the end.</p><p>	Draco had come to terms with that and was almost looking forward to it. The Malfoys sat in the parlor, waiting to be taken away by the Ministry. Instead, the lawyers said that a certain someone convinced Kingsley Shacklebolt to hold a trial before their imprisonment. Until that time they were to be on house arrest. Because they did not commit as high crimes as other Death Eaters (their biggest offense was housing the Dark Lord), their trial was scheduled in a month’s time at the beginning of July. This was already bad news to Draco, who had finally come to terms with his death after facing it for nearly two years, but finding out Potter was cooperating the Minister on his behalf nearly sent him over the edge. </p><p>	It was legitimately difficult to remember that month, Draco was so ill. He couldn’t keep food down and he spent full days in bed, barely mustering the energy to walk to his bathroom. His father at first tried to comfort him and apologized endlessly for failing his son so greatly; then he got angry. He once tried to physically pull Draco out of bed, but the war had weakened him significantly, and even malnourished Draco could overpower him. That rare violent confrontation between Draco and his father did transform Lucius Malfoy back into a more recognizable version of himself—he even started doing business dealings again, and soon forgot about Draco. Good, Draco had thought. At least I can be of some use to this family.</p><p>	His mother on the other hand—</p><p>	“Dragon?” Draco snapped out of his memories and sat up in bed at the sound of his mother’s voice—tentative and worried as it always had been this summer. “Would you like some breakfast?”</p><p>	“No, thank you Mother. I’ll be ready in a few minutes.” He was embarrassed to admit that he still had problems eating at times. He hoped that part of it was just being in the Manor, trying to find somewhere to eat where he hadn’t been, but he also felt like he should be over that by now. The past was the past, and he was a Malfoy. Although, he wasn’t sure what being a Malfoy meant anymore. He often found himself wishing that his father had either defied the Dark Lord or was a successful Death Eater. Draco didn’t know how to interpret the fact that his father lay cowardly in between good and evil. </p><p>	Regardless of his location, Draco doubted that he would have been able to eat today. It was September 1st, and his trunk stared at him menacingly from the end of his bed. He put on a suit, washed his face in the adjoining bathroom with cold water himself, and then dragged his trunk down two flights of stairs to the main floor. </p><p>	The Manor house elf, Tilly, was busy making a breakfast Draco knew he would not eat. When Draco’s family returned home after the Battle of Hogwarts, Tilly was the only Manor house elf that had not ran away. The Dark Lord had enslaved the creatures, not Lucius, and so when their master died they were not magically bound to the Manor. He wasn’t sure why Tilly stayed behind when the others left, and he didn’t have nearly as much interaction with her as he did with Dobby. He wasn’t even sure his old house elf and playmate had survived after Aunt Bellatrix...and afterward...</p><p>	Don’t think about that, he told himself sternly as his trunk thumped down the stairs one by one. </p><p>	“Can’t you do that any more gracefully?” His father drawled from the dining room table, face covered by The Daily Prophet.</p><p>	“Well I can’t do magic now, can I?” Draco mumbled as he was finally able to drop the trunk. As part of his probation, he was required to wear a magic bracelet that blocked him from using magic until he graduated from Hogwarts. He was very irritated that he was not able to practice with his new wand for the entire summer. Not only would he return to school as a criminal, but also terrible at magic from disuse. </p><p>	“What did you say?” It seemed that now Lucius wanted to be a parent. However, where four years ago he would have made Draco apologize for his insolence, at least now he was sheepish enough to let it slide. “Come sit with your Mother and I so we can have breakfast as a family before you have to leave.”</p><p>	Even Draco’s parents were traumatized enough that they no longer ate in the dining room. They purchased a small table for the three of them and put it right next to the kitchen. Draco sat down, being careful to not make a sound. He sat up straight, as a Malfoy should. </p><p>	“Please eat something, dear. It’s a long journey.” Draco had to make an effort after looking into Narcissa’s eyes across from him. He grabbed a plain piece of toast from the table and took a bite.</p><p>	“Your mother and I wanted to make clear our expectations for you this year. You are to follow all rules related to your probation. You are to get high marks in all of your courses and be polite to your professors. You are to be especially kind to all pureblood students. Their families have been very gracious in letting us back into the inner circle. You will not tarnish the Malfoy name.” </p><p>	As much as you already have. “Yes, Father.”</p><p>	The rest of the meal passed in silence. Draco focused on closing his mind and feeling nothing, channeling his intense focus from his Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape and his aunt. When a knock sounded at the door, no Malfoy moved to answer it, but Draco put down his half-eaten toast and looked toward the doorway. A wave of nausea and anxiety rushed over him. </p><p>	“The car is here for you, Master Draco” Tilly said. Draco’s parents weren’t allowed to accompany him to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters this year. He was somewhat relieved. His parents hadn’t been out in public at all since the War ended, and neither had he. Over his months spent lounging around in apathy, he had imagined dozens of scenarios, dozens of possible reactions to his presence. In all of them, the response was infinitely better without his parents there. </p><p>	He stood up and shook Lucius’s outstretched hand. “Goodbye Father.” Lucius nodded. Draco breathed, wanting to keep the empty, nonplussed feeling he had mustered instead of the rush of emotion rising up inside of him. He would not miss his father. He would not. There was no reason to feel anything except neutrality or relief.  </p><p>	Draco turned to his mother. Narcissa embraced him, and he sighed, releasing something deep inside of him. Tears threatened to escape, but Draco had become good at refusing to let them fall. As Narcissa pulled away, Draco cupped her face in his hands. “I’ll be okay, Mother. I promise you.” His voice threatened to crack, and he felt a deep ache in his chest.</p><p>	Rare tears shone in Narcissa’s eyes, but like her son, she did not let them fall. “I love you so much, my son. My Dragon.”</p><p>	“I love you too. Take care of yourself, alright?” He made eye contact with his father as he said this, and his father nodded. Draco hoped he could trust his father to take care of Narcissa, trust him to do this one thing right. </p><p>	Draco grabbed his trunk, this time finding the strength inside of him to lift it off the ground completely. Then he stepped outside into the new world, feeling sure that it would be an even better one were he not in it.</p>
