    <p>Harry wore a japanese School Sailor shirt that fell down to his thighs, with a red cloth tie around his neck, he wore black shorts underneath. He was short for his age and had been growing his hair out so it was now below his shoulders. He looked more like a girl with his slim body than a girl. His big killing curse green eyes were no longer hidden behind his aweful glasses as his uncle Sakyo had gotten him contact lenses. The magical kind that you never had to take out. He also didn't have that awful scar anymore. His uncle Sakyo had had the Goblins do a ritual to remove it. </p>
<p>Harry had been with his uncle Sakyo for just about a week now and the love he was getting was making him feel so great that he sometimes slipped into acting younger than he was. Harry didn't know where this came from but it didn't seem to bother his uncle any so Harry figured that it was okay. </p>
<p>Today Harry was going to check on the business he'd just bought. He skipped down the street in awe of all the people and theaters until he finally found the one he was looking for. He watched as his uncle told everyone that he was tearing down the theater. </p>
<p>"UNCLE SAKYO!" Harry bawled running to the guy and throwing himself on him. </p>
<p>Sakyo froze and looked down at his nephew. </p>
<p>"SAKODA!" Sakyo scolded. "I thought I told you to have Harry see a show today!" </p>
<p>"Uncle Sakyo!" Harry said, looking up with tears in his eyes. "Why are you tearing down my theater?" </p>
<p>"You're theater?" Everyone asked, looking down at him. </p>
<p>Harry got in his backpack and pulled out the paperwork Griphook had sent him saying that he owned the theater. </p>
<p>"I saw a note on your desk that said 'Buy Theater' so I did." Harry explained. </p>
<p>"We need to work on your reading Japanese." Sakyo sighed. "I had no such note. You're confusing Kanji. " </p>
<p>"oh," Harry said, "But the fact remains I bought this theater." </p>
<p>Sakyo sighed. Great now he couldn't tear it down not that he wanted to in the first place. </p>
<p>"So you own our theater?" The red haired teen asked. </p>
<p>"That's right!" Harry said, giving a sharp nod as he clung to his uncle's side. "I'm Furuichi Harry!" Sakyo hid his shock at the boy taking his surname all of a sudden. "From today on I will run this place. Who is the script writer?" </p>
<p>"Er......guess that's me." the brown haired teen said, pointing to himself. "I'm Minagi Tsuzuru age 18." </p>
<p>"You will write Romeo and Juliet!" Harry demanded. "I will be Juliet and ........" he threw himself on the black haired teen hugging him and staring up in to disinterested purple eyes. "You will be my Romeo." </p>
<p>"Cool your hormones." Sakyo said, grabbing Harry around the waist and holding him under his arm like it was nothing and he could do it all day. </p>
<p>"Er........I can do that." Tsuzuru nodded. </p>
<p>"Oh, I'm Skuma Sakuya age: 17." the red head said. </p>
<p>"Usui Masumi age 16." </p>
<p>"Only three years older." Harry said, happily. "Our love will work!" </p>
<p>Sakyo rolled his eyes he had expected Harry to be the type to fall in love at first sight. </p>
<p>"What kind of music are you listening to?" Harry asked. "Can I listen? Masumi is such a wonderful name. Masumi........" </p>
<p>Sakyo could almost see hearts and flowers floating around his nephew.</p><hr/>
<p>Harry yawned hours later after eating two plates of curry. </p>
<p>"NO!" he bellowed when everyone was talking about roommates. "Masumi will room with me!" He slammed into Masumi hugging him. "Masumi will be mine! We're going to married! So we must get used to living together!" </p>
<p>"I want to sleep with the director." Masumi replied. </p>
<p>Harry's eyes flashed he grabbed the nearest object and hit Masumi over the head with it then began trying to drag Masumi towards the dorms. He didn't get far. </p>
<p>"SAKODA!" Harry finally bawled tears filling his eyes. </p>
<p>"You're the boss, boss." Sakoda said, throwing Masumi over his shoulder and taking Harry's hand. </p>
<p>Harry beamed happily as he skipped along to his new room. He loved it on sight. It was rather spacy and the beds were built bunk bed style into the back wall. Oh, yes he loved this. He frowned when it seemed that they would have to use a communial bathroom. That wasn't going to happen. No way he was going to have someone come here and magically add bathrooms to each room. Maybe expand and get more rooms? The closets needed to be bigger too then they could put the dressers inside them and have more room for their personal things. He instructed Sakoda to lay Masumi on the top bunk then kicked him out. He was really tired all of a sudden. He crawled into bed and into Masumi's arms and was lost to the world.</p><hr/>
<p>Masumi frowned when he woke up to something beside him. He opened his eyes to find a head of black hair. The little brat really had slept with him. He frowned at the typing sound he was hearing. He got up which woke his brat. </p>
<p>Harry sat up rubbing his eyes and blinking. </p>
<p>"Masumi-chan, what is that noise?" He whined. </p>
<p>"PC." Masumi said, as they both got out of bed. </p>
<p>"Tsuzuru?" Harry said, still rubbing his eyes. "What are you doing in our room?" </p>
<p>"I live here." Tsuzuru answered. "Don't worry I wont be a bother. Have a good day today, Harry-san." </p>
<p>"What are you doing so early?" Harry demanded. </p>
<p>"Writing a rough raft of the play. There are four actors if your joining us." Tsuzuru replied as Harry changed into his school uniform and not even being shy about it. </p>
<p>"Of course I am. " Harry said, rolling his eyes. "I stared in ten primary school plays. My teachers always said I was an acting Prodigy. Masumi walk me to breakfast." </p>
<p>Masumi yawned not fully awake but did as told.</p><hr/>
<p>After Harry went to the Japanese eqvilant of Hogwarts, which he deemed way better than Hogwarts, for the school day he was brought back to Mankai by Sakoda. When everyone was home from school they were talking about getting another member or two. </p>
<p>"I know!" Harry said, "We'll do a street act." He let his hair down from where it was pulled back at the nape of his neck. "Masumi and I will do the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet. Do you know it, Masumi?" </p>
<p>"Yeah......." Masumi said, "Studying it in class." </p>
<p>Harry quickly put on a skirt over his shorts to look more like a girl.</p>
<p>They were soon on the street. </p>
<p>"Romeo! Romeo!" Harry said, falling into Juliet easily. "Where for out thou Romeo....." </p>
<p>It didn't take long for people to stop and watch them. Harry got lost in his acting and took Masumi and the crowd along with him. They finally stopped and took a bow. </p>
<p>"Please come see Mankai Company's Romeo and Juliet tickets on sale soon." Harry said, doing his best to look adorable as he hung off of Masumi's arm. People cooed over them and gave them tips.  "Oh, thank you so much!" He beamed brightly as Masumi gave him a piggyback ride over to Izumi without being asked or forced. He guessed it was because they were still drawing a crowd. "Did you find someone for us, Izumi?" </p>
<p>"The good meetings!" the person said, happily. "I am Citron and I am very into learning more about theater."</p>
<p>"You're hired!" Harry and Izumi cheered. </p>
<p>It wasn't long before Citron had Sakuya spinning into someone while Harry laughed from Masumi's back. This turned out to be Chigasaki Itaru. He joined when he heard about the dorms as well. With that they headed back. Harry riding on Masumi the whole way. </p>
<p>"You're really light." Masumi stated as he passed Harry to Sakyo upon arrival back at the dorm.</p>
<p>Harry blushed then stared down at his feet a sad look in his eyes as he held Sakyo's hand. </p>
<p>"Don't mention that again." Sakyo snapped at Masumi.</p>
<p>"It's not a bad thing." Masumi shrugged. He rubbed his hand into Harry's head. "You eat the Directors curry everynight and you'll put some weight on. " </p>
<p>"CAN I COOK YOU DINNER?!" Harry blurted out loudly. </p>
<p>Everyone looked down at him. </p>
<p>"You can cook?" Sakuya asked. </p>
<p>"Only English stuff but I'll learn Japanese cooking for you, Masui!" Harry declared. "I'll go buy a cookbook right now!" </p>
<p>"Sakoda." Sakyo said, staring at his phone and typing on it. </p>
<p>"You're the boss, boss. " Sakoda answered and ran after Harry. </p>
<p>Masumi was a little confused okay more than a little.</p><hr/>
<p>Harry sat at the desk in the room next to Tsuzuru and worked on his homework that night. It was hard when he only had a week of Japanese lessons under his belt but he had a secret that was helping him. Ah, there it was. </p>
<p>
  <b>Calculation-6</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Japanese -5</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Bilingual-1</b>
</p>
<p>He smirked to himself with this he'd be able to do anything he set his mind to. Although he was pissed about his <b>Acting-1</b> . Dudley had never wanted to be in school plays and no one had wanted him in them but they were mandatory. It was one place that harry had been allowed to outshine his cousin and so he'd worked hard at it not that he had to. From the start he was praised as a prodigy Stonewall High had been looking forward to having him because of his acting skills but he'd gone to Hogwarts instead. </p>
<p>When Harry's work was done he sat and started translating his cookbook from Japanese to English and back again or at least trying to. This was how he'd gotten his Japanese skill so high so fast. It was also helping him learn to write Kanji better his handwriting was terrible but he would improve it as he went. When the clock showed ten o clock Harry packed up and stretched. </p>
<p>"Oh, no, I went over." Harry said, "I was supposed to have my bath by now and then get into bed at this time. Uncle will not be pleased with me." </p>
<p>"Take one in the morning." Masumi yawned. "Bed." He put Harry on the ladder and gently nudged him. Harry was already wearing a pink camie and matching boxers. His uncle and Sakoda seemed to think that he needed to dress like a girl. Harry knew he could pull it off but was still a little confused about it. "I'm right behind you." Masumi added when Harry looked back at him and opened his mouth. "Up." </p>
<p>Harry happily crawled to the wall and turned to see Masumi was indeed joining him. As soon as Masumi laid down Harry was snuggling in his arms. To Harry this was a perfect fit and wrapped in Masumi's arms he fell asleep quickly and didn't have any nightmares for the second night in the row. He was beyond thrilled and Sakyo would be too because it meant that Harry was finally getting some much needed rest.</p>
