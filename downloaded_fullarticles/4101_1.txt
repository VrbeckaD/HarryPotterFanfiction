    <p>Agape - Agape love is entirely about the lover, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the one loved.  Agape love, in its purest form, requires no payment or favor in response.<br/>

“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!”</p>
<p>“Stand aside, you silly girl … stand aside, now …”</p>
<p>“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead – Not Harry! Please … have mercy … have mercy …”</p>
<p>The last thing she saw in her life was a flare of green light, her dying screams ringing in her ears as the protection she set around Harry tore her soul and magic from her body as Voldemort killed her.</p>
<p>It burned. For an eternity. For a second. She had no body any longer but her soul burned just the same. She gasped for air she no longer needed as she tried to ignore the tremors that wracked her intangible form. Suddenly, breaking through the pain was the feeling of a fishhook behind her navel. </p>
<p>A portkey, her mind thought fuzzily just as it activated and the world spun. When it settled, she was surrounded by the dark with a white doorway gleaming just beyond her. Slowly, she approached, unsure what to expect. Lily hesitated one final moment before she strode through the doorway, hoping that it didn’t lead to the afterlife.</p>
<p>Lily emerged and saw a playroom. It was an utter mess. Toys and drawings were scattered across the room and moving portraits lined the wall. Running her eyes across the portraits, she saw herself and James, laughing and smiling in one of the two largest portraits. Sirius and Remus in another grinning as well as Sirius turned into Padfoot every so often in the other. </p>
<p>Smaller portraits dotted the walls with the few people who had visited in the small family while they were in hiding. A clear portrait of a nervous Peter shifting guiltily in another portrait that Lily snarled at. Traitor, her mind sneered. A foggy small portrait of both Professor McGonagall and a similar one for Professor Dumbledore. Another of Alice and Frank holding a laughing Neville.</p>
<p>Lily suddenly felt something tug on her soul, and without a thought, she turned to follow it, only to reappear in the dark room again, this time facing a large white screen, similar to what she had seen in a movie theater before. Just as she thought that, the screen flickered to life and she saw herself lying in a heap before Voldemort.<br/>
With her heart in her throat, she watched as Voldemort pointed his wand at her once more. Hearing Harry’s cries reminded her that he was the only other living soul in the room left. Voldemort wasn’t pointing his wand at her, he was pointing his wand at Harry!</p>
<p>Not her baby!</p>
<p>With that single, all-consuming thought, she could feel her very essence flare and energy poured through her as a shimmering, white shield snapped into existence, distorting Lily’s view of the monster that wanted to kill her son just as a streak of that hateful green light shot out of Voldemort’s wand.</p>
<p>Just as the Death Spell touched the shield, Lily fell to the ground screaming. Merlin, this is worse than the Cruciatus, Lily was barely able the think before all thought was ripped from her as she spasmed in agony. Sometime later in the midst of her torment, it almost felt like there was a tear in herself before the agony covered all other feelings once more.<br/>
Finally, finally, the pain ended and Lily remained on the ground, panting weakly as she trembled in misery. Blearily, she turned her head to look at the screen again and Voldemort was gone. There was a pile of robes and ash just beyond her body and Harry was still crying. Aching, all she could do was blink slowly even as her mind slowly woke and she saw Peter run in and cry out at the sight before him before he grabbed Voldemort’s wand and raced back out of the room. </p>
<p>She was too tired to do anything even as she wished she could hold Harry, soothe him and tell him that everything was going to be ok. Weakly, she watched as Severus entered Harry’s nursery next and cried out at the sight of her and took her lifeless body into his arms as he cried. Soon, he laid her back down before he cast a spell. Invisibility, she thought, dazed as he vanished right before Sirius burst into the room and he, too, cried out at the sight of her. </p>
<p>Then, he looked up and met her eyes. Small hands reached for him on the screen as Harry’s babble filled the air. With a sob, Sirius reached back for the little arms and Lily’s view rose. </p>
<p>Harry, she thought. She was looking through Harry’s eyes. </p>
<p>Vaguely, she wished that she could see more of the surroundings, feeling a tug in her chest and watched as the image seemed to expand before it was as if she really was watching a movie. Sirius was crying and holding Harry while Harry looked fine beyond a scratch on his forehead. </p>
<p>Sirius has him, Lily thought in relief. Harry’s safe now. </p>
<p>With that thought, she passed out.</p>
