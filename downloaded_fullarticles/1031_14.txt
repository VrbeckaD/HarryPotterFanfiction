    <p>Naomi's POV</p><p>"Can I go?" I asked, practically bouncing in my seat as we pulled up to the train station in Dad's 'stealth vehicle', a black muggle car. "Patience." Mother reprimanded me. I rolled her eyes and opened the door, practically yanking my luggage from the backseat. "I'll get a buggy." Dad offered, walking to the storage. </p><p>"You know..." Mother trailed off. "Mr. Pucey's son, Adrian, starts school this year as well." She hinted, giving me a sly smile. My face scrunched up and before I could stop myself, I let out a noise of disgust, making mother chuckle under her breath. "That's what I used to say too. And here I am, with you and your father." She continued, sighing contently. Well Dad probably didn't look and act like a mini Neanderthal, I thought crossly. I grinned widely as Dad came back, pushing the trolley. "Come on!" I said, skipping ahead into the train station.</p><p>"Naomi Hunt!" I skidded to a halt as Dad hissed my name. I couldn't help it, I was so excited! Dad quickly caught up with me first, then mother, her heels clicking across the floor. He knelt down in front of me, brushing imaginary dust off my shoulders. I sighed, looking down at my shoes, letting out a small sigh. "Naomi." She looked up at him.</p><p>"You know we have appearances to keep up." He reminded me. "But why?!" I asked, half pleading. I looked around Kings Cross station at the kids who were running around, screaming and playing, and their parents who smiled and laughed. My family wasn't like that. Not out here at least. And I didn't understand at all.</p><p>Dad's gaze saddened. "Better to not draw attentions to us, eh? We'll explain when you're older." There it was again. At this rate, I'll never be old enough to know! With that, Dad stood up straight and turned to my mother who just finished readjusting herself from running after us. </p><p>Before we set off again, mother grabbed my hand tightly like she was afraid I would disappear into thin air. Soon enough they reached the wall between platforms 9 and 10. "You first, darling." My mother spoke. I watched as Dad ran at the wall and then through it. "Cool." I whispered. </p><p>"Ready?" My mother asked, brushing a stray curl out of my face. I nodded excitedly, practically bouncing on my heels. I didn't let go of my mother's hand as we briskly walked into the wall, a wave of warmth washing over me. It was like a warm hug.</p><p>My mouth fell open as we walked out further, the black and red train coming into sight. It was huge! I barely recognized that my hand was dropped as we regrouped with my dad. "Brings back memories, luv." Dad smiled at us, taking mother's hand. </p><p>I ignored them and looked around at other kids, running in and out of the train. My heart was doused in ice. I took a step back, biting my lip hesitantly. What if I didn't fit in? What if I- "Naomi!" Dad repeated, bringing me back to reality. "Huh?" I asked, turning back. "He said he checked your bags in." Mother spoke. "Oh. Thanks."</p><p>My mother brushed my hair comfortingly. "You're gonna do fine." She assured me. I looked at their matching green scarves, both seemingly mocking me as they flapped vibrantly in the wind. "What if I don't end up in Slytherin?" I whispered, afraid of the answer. "What if I'm not like you guys?"</p><p>"Honey. You're gonna make us proud. You always have. A House doesn't make you less of a Hunt." Mother whispered comfortingly. "Slytherin or not." Dad added. I almost missed the dark look her parents shared. Hm. I took a deep breath and stood up straight. "There's our girl." Dad smiled, making me feel better. I grinned, brushing off my worries for another time. </p><p>I kissed my mother and father on their cheeks as the train blew its loading whistle. I hurried on the train to find a compartment that wasn't occupied and leaned out the window, waving to my parents who waved back. I blinked, taken back to see mother crying silently as she waved. Even Dad's smile looked forced. </p><p>With a slow start, the train started rolling and picking up speed. I waved until my parents disappeared from sight and the free wind started blowing my hair messily. There went mother's hard work. With some effort, I shut the open window and sat down. I could faintly hear laughter and talking from outside but for once, I was actually happy to be alone. It was awfully loud on the train and I don't think I liked it. </p><p>I dug through my satchel, pulling out a copy of Hamlet that Dad gave me. Apparently his job involved something to do with muggles and no matter how much I begged and pleaded, he would never let me go to muggle London. He said it was too dangerous. Too dangerous for me but safe for all those Muggles? Ok.</p><p>I was about to open the book when suddenly, there was a knock on the door.</p>
