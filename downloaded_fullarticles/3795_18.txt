    <p>"I have no wish to see the boy."</p>
<p>"You need to face this sir." Tina pleads.</p>
<p>"I don't need to do anything. And you will do well to remember that Goldstein." Graves' snaps.</p>
<p>"He's hurting and confused."</p>
<p>"And you think I can help with that! Seeing me will only confuse him more. That bastard wore my face and manipulated him. No, the sooner Scamander can rid the Barebone child of the obscurus the sooner he can return to No-Maj society."</p>
<p>"What, but Credence is a wizard!"</p>
<p>"He is a bastardized version of one. And once the obscurus is removed he will be no better than a squib. Don't look at me like that Tina he will never fit in with us. He has zero knowledge of our culture, of our history. The fact that he was raised to hate us means if he joins us he will end up hating himself. Its cruel. Help him then let him go to find his way in the No-Maj world, it’s for the best."</p>
<p>"You underestimate him. He is capable of learning. And you have no right to deny him his birth right."</p>
<p>"I didn't! That fanatical woman denied him. It’s too late to reverse the damage that has been done to him." Graves says through gritted teeth, trying to keep from shouting at the stubborn witch in front of him.</p>
<p>"You don't know that!" she screeched.</p>
<p>"Enough. I don't have the energy or the desire to fight with you on this. Do what you want with the boy but I will have no part in it."</p>
<p>"I never took you for a coward sir but hiding from Credence is truly pathetic" and with that Tina turns and quickly leaves the ward not wanting to hear her bosses reply.</p>
<p>Graves scowls after the young Auror. He is right, the boy's involvement in their society would do him more damage, he has come into this too late. Better for him to try his hand in the No-Maj world than fail in the wizarding world. If only Tina and that damn magizoologist could see that. They call his practical thinking cruel but they will end up crushing the boys hopes in the long run.</p>
<p>His time in the hospital so far has been tedious. Confined to his bed he has had to suffer through well-wishers, and the constant presence of medi-wizards. One does not have to be a legilimens to know many of the well wishes are less than heartfelt. And the constant hovering by the medi-wizards is beyond irritating. Graves knows he is not the warmest of people and it doesn't bother him that his ordeal has not caused a larger outpouring of grief. One does not become the Director of Magical Security and head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, as well as a top Auror, by being soft and cuddley. He is more than happy to remain isolated if it means that he is better equipped to save people. Auror like Tina Goldstein are necessary, their compassion balances nicely with Graves' practicality, but they will never be head of either department. Graves knows what’s best for the wizarding world and its security and he knows whats best for the obscurial and that is to remain separate from the society that would surely shun him.</p>
<p>Never one for excessive introspection Graves despises the free time he has while in the hospital. His mind drifts to the damage Grindlewald has wrought, specifically to the Barebones child. He immediately cuts off this line of thinking once he begins to feel an inkling of guilt. Graves has no reason to feel guilty. He was bleeding out in a hole in the ground while the boy was running around as Grindlewald's personal lackey, he thinks unkindly. The weakness displayed by the boy irritates Graves. That kind of naivety is unfathomable and is inexcusable in his mind. </p>
<p>Picquery stops by to discuss going forward. "You will be out of action for several more weeks, maybe even a few months." It is clear she is irritated by his current state. They always were alike in their brusqueness. "While you can't work in the field you will oversee operations and investigations from your desk. We can't wait around forever."</p>
<p>"I would hardly call 6 days in hospital, forever Madam President." he says archly.</p>
<p>"Grindlewald is out there, emboldened by his escape and our subsequent humiliation. You may still be recovering but you are needed. Do you think you are unable to read reports and direct investigations from an armchair?"</p>
<p>"No Madam President but time is needed for some healing. And I have been meeting with my Aurors already in this ward." He will not let her steamroll him and dismiss the work he has already done. "I will be conducting the manhunt from my house. Goldstein will be my go between and will report to my office."</p>
<p>"Goldstein is preoccupied with the obscurial."</p>
<p>"She is an Auror and my subordinate. If she wants to avoid demotion again she will resume her regular work. Let Scamander deal with the obscurial." Picquey stares him down, he may be bedridden but he will not bend to this woman "And why is he still alive? Last I heard you ordered his execution. Why the change of heart?"</p>
<p>"The boy does not pose an immediate threat and Scamander believes he can safely remove the obscurus."</p>
<p>"And it wouldn't look good for you if you were to order the execution of a nineteen-year-old."</p>
<p>"Elections are next year" she shrugs as if that explains it all, and perhaps it does. Seraphina is not just a formidable witch but a great politician. Some say too authoritarian in her leadership but that's what America needs right now in this climate, at least Graves thinks so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The rest of his evening is spent devising how he will organise and command his Aurors from his home. Provisions will have to be made and a room converted to act as HQ. He drifts off but he is restless, being weaned off the sleeping draught. He wakes in the early hours to see a figure in his doorway, staring at him. The figure makes no move to leave though Graves is now awake. "Who are you and what do you want?" He demands pointing his wand at the intruder. Still the shadowed figure makes no move to leave or attack.</p>
<p>Graves and the figure stay in a kind of standoff for a drawn-out moment until Scamander appears in the doorway. "Apologies Director. Credence come on you shouldn't be wandering this late."</p>
<p>Graves blanches. He lights up the room and gets a good look at the obscurial. He is tall, dark hair, extremely pale. There are heavy bags under his eyes. Wounds litter his face and neck. His forearms are heavily bandaged. Graves' Aurors had tried their utmost to kill him after all. He looks painfully thin, the hospital gown hanging off him, even the lanky Scamander dwarfs him with his bulk. The boy doesn't move and Graves does not lower his wand. After a few tugs on his arm the boy silently follows the red head out into the hall. Its only then that Graves realises his heart thudding painfully in his chest. He was right to tell Tina he should stay away from the obscurial. His presence would likely set it off again. Graves tries to get some rest but the hollow, lifeless look in the boy's eyes haunts his mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He limps out of his fire place four days later. They had wanted to keep him for further observation but the President had deemed it unnecessary. The living room he stepped into was in disarray but he was prepared for it. Grindlewald had periodically stayed in Graves' apartment as far as anyone could tell. Graves had allowed a team of his Aurors to scan the apartment and remove any threats left by the dark wizard but Graves had insisted on cleaning up himself. He did not want people sifting through his belongings, even if they were his colleagues. The cleaning exhausted him, the setting up of a HQ for the manhunt could wait until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Graves was glad to have chosen Tina as his liaison with the office. For some reason he was comfortable with her in his house and their meetings were always quick and to the point, no superfluous discussions. This probably had something to do with her still being angry about his dismissal of the obscurial. As long as she did her job well Graves didn't care how Tina felt about it. </p>
<p>"There have been numerous sightings of Grindlewald up and down the east coast and some in the interior states. Its taking a lot of time to sort through them all to see which ones could be genuine."</p>
<p>"Get admin staff from other offices to sort through tips, my Aurors shouldn't be wasting time sorting through letters. And set up a meeting with the Atlanta and Miami offices. I want all of us to be on the same page, not making idiotic mistakes because of crossed owls."</p>
<p>"Sir, Auror Melville has apologised for the incident in Jacksonville he-"</p>
<p>"I don't care how many times he apologises, him and that Florida Auror cost us a solid lead because of bad communication. Set up the meeting."</p>
<p>"Yes sir. Is that all?"</p>
<p>"Yes." He dismissed her with a wave of his hand. Graves' sensed Tina would not keep silent on the subject of the obscurial for much longer. He could feel a headache forming behind his eyes at the thought of the stubborn Auror. Pouring himself a fire whisky Graves settles in his study and looks over the map that is tracking the more likely sightings of Grindlewald. </p>
<p>After staring at the map until his eyes became unfocused Graves writes a note to Tina informing her he will be at MACUSA tomorrow for the meeting. He couldn't keep staring at the walls in his apartment it was driving him crazy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He has to walk with a cane for the foreseeable future as his damned leg slowly heals. The medi-wizards were hesitant to try too much on it, preferring it to heal in its own time. Graves could be patient but this was painful and inconvenient and his temper was shorter than usual. </p>
<p>He held the meeting with the heads of the east coast offices in his own office with only Tina from his team present. He was coming to reply heavily on the witch and he wasn't too pleased with that. The bureaucratic quagmire they were facing caused Graves to snap several times at the other Aurors heads. He knew Picquery would not make exemptions for them but he felt like going to her office and demanding it anyway. Cohesion was impossible between the different groups of east coast Aurors and Grindlewald was exploiting that fact with embarrassing ease. Tina was able to smooth things over and organise a meeting between the Aurors themselves rather than the heads to see if a solution could be reached. </p>
<p>Graves leaned back in his chair once the meeting finished, feeling like nothing had been accomplished. He sensed Tina still in the room "What?" he asks gruffly.</p>
<p>"Newt hasn't made much progress with extracting the obscurus but because Credence is in a better environment he is not having any outbursts." Graves doesn't hear a question so doesn't respond. "Credence's power is immense. To have survived so long with the obscurus and to have some control over it-"</p>
<p>"Is there a point Tina?" he snaps.</p>
<p>"He needs to overcome what was done to him. Obviously he can't get closure with Grindlewald but maybe meeting you can help him move past this."</p>
<p>"I had no hand in the boy's manipulation. You can take some polyjuice potion and in my form you can talk to him."</p>
<p>"Why are you so afraid to meet him?" she demands.</p>
<p>"Tread carefully Ms. Goldstein. I am your superior and you will watch how you talk to me. The boy so easily manipulated, will not get any closure from me because it is not me he wants it is Grindlewald."</p>
<p>"But-"</p>
<p>"But nothing. I have more important things to do than comfort a pathetic, wretched child. Like catch the man who imprisoned and tortured me for 4 months. You seem to forget that it was not only the obscurial that Grindlewald broke. Now get out, you have work to do." His patience was wearing thinner by the day with her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was two more weeks of chasing cold leads until a breakthrough. A follower of Grindlewald's had been apprehended. He wasn't a fanatic, willing to die for the cause. No he was much more sensible and in exchange for a lesser sentence they got some valuable intelligence. Graves knew he could not risk sending all of his Aurors out on this mission so he left a skeleton crew in New York. He was in communication with Tina who was leading the group to Louisiana. Everyone was on high alert. As his Aurors entered the house they believed Grindlewald was hiding in Graves was deafened by screaming and alarm bells. He jumped up, injured leg be damned, thinking someone had gotten through his wards, but his apartment was empty. He checked in with his Aurors but they were unharmed, searching what appeared to be an abandoned house. The noise had not lessened and Graves realised it was coming from inside his head. He concentrated reaching out for the source. It was Queenie Goldstein! Grindlewald was attacking and she was mentally calling out for help. Graves immediately called his Aurors back and alerted the ones who had remained in New York. He apparated into the Goldstein apartment. It was chaos. Over a dozen bodies crammed into the tiny apartment, hexes bouncing off walls, wards going off shrilly. Graves caught sight of several magical beasts in the fray as well. He caught a glimpse of white hair and chalky skin disapparating. One of his Aurors, Macmillan, tried to grab Grindlewald and side along but got splinched. </p>
<p>After Grindlewald escape Graves assessed the scene. Two Aurors had been stupified but had regained consciousness. Macmillan was taken to hospital immediately; his arm would have to be regrown. Other than that, no serious injuries. Queenie was shaking while Tina fixed her a calming draught. "What happened?" Tina threw him a look but he had no time for courtesy. Grindlewald had been here! "Why was he after you?" Queenie looked up at that "It wasn't me he was after."</p>
<p>"Oh god, Credence!" Tina's hands flew to her mouth in shock. At the same time Scamander climbed out of his damned suitcase. "We have a problem" he says calmly. </p>
<p>"What are either of you hurt" Tina's eyes searching for any sign of injury.</p>
<p>"No but-" as Newt spoke another person climbed out of the case. A small child with dark hair and darker eyes stands in the apartment, a dirty, oversized work-shirt pooling at his feet.</p>
<p>"Credence?" Tina whispers in horror.</p>
<p>"I don't know what Grindlewald was attempting, I don't know if this is what he intended." Newt says perplexed. They stand and stare at the little boy, who could be no older than 5. Newt kneels down to be eye level with the boy. "Credence do you know who I am?" The child nods. "Do you know who you are?" Another nod. "Do you remember the things that have happened recently?" Again confirmation. Newt stands up and address the adults in the room "Why would Grindlewald de-age Credence but leave him with his memories intact? It doesn't make sense."</p>
<p>"Maybe he hadn't intended to de-age him?" Tina suggested.</p>
<p>"No Grindlewald wouldn't make a mistake like that. He most likely thought a young obscurial would be easier to control and be less of a threat to him since now he is not allied with it anymore." Graves says, mind going a mile a minute trying to figure out Grindlewald's intentions. "Grindlewald will lie low for the next few days to avoid detection. Tina, tomorrow lead a thorough search of the house in Louisiana see if anything was left behind. Then join me in interviewing the supporter who gave us the information, he may have been in on the plan. I'm going to inform the President of the situation now. If anyone needs me I'll be at MACUSA. Scamander make sure nothing got out of your case, that is the last thing we need right now." he gives the orders and prepares to disapparate when Queenie speaks up "What about Credence?" The boy is still standing there, face expressionless.</p>
<p>"You mind him for the moment. Tomorrow I will send someone from MACUSA to take him into protective custody."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Excuse me Mr. Scamander?"</p>
<p>"He maybe a child but Credence is aware of what is going on. You can't just take him away from where he has been living these past few weeks."</p>
<p>"He is not safe here and we cannot risk Grindlewald capturing the obscurial. And no! Tina cannot stay and protect him she is needed elsewhere." He says before Tina can cut in. "Everybody knows what they need to do tonight so get to it!" </p>
<p>He disapparates from the Goldstein apartment and to his MACUSA office. He is greeted by the sight of a furious looking President Picquery. "Good evening Madam President."</p>
<p>"What the hell happened?"</p>
<p>"While my Aurors were scattered Grindlewald attacked here in New York. No deaths. But the obscurial has been de-aged." He reports succinctly.</p>
<p>Picquery turns a dark shade of purple, livid, "What?" she hisses.</p>
<p>"He is currently in the care of Queenie Goldstein and Newt Scamander, he will be transferred to MACUSA protective custody tomorrow ASAP."</p>
<p>"No"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon"</p>
<p>"No, you will take custody of the obscurial."</p>
<p>"With all due respect Madam Pres-"</p>
<p>"Director Graves. If Grindlewald gets his hands on the obscurial we won't be able to cover up the damage like last time. The Statute of Secrecy will be broken and I will not allow that to happen under my presidency. You will protect the obscurial. And prevent Grindlewald from getting it by any means necessary. Do you understand."</p>
<p>"You would have me kill a child?"</p>
<p>"If necessary. Grindlewald would kill it anyway after unleashing the obscurus. It is your job as Director to protect wizard-kind no matter how distasteful you think your orders are."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be protecting the boy, who is a wizard."</p>
<p>"He's a squib-"</p>
<p>"We don't know that for su-"</p>
<p>"You have your orders Graves. Collect the child from the Goldsteins."</p>
<p>They stood staring at each other for a long moment. Graves could feel his respect for Picquery slipping. Her preoccupation with politics at a time like this was disconcerting. When he was sure there was no more to be said he walked to the fireplace and made his way back to the Goldstein's apartment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tina, Queenie and Newt are still up when Graves arrives in the apartment. Tina and Newt are in the kitchen preparing a late supper while Queenie is sitting with the sullen looking child in her lap. "What are you doing here?" Tina asks. She adds a "sir" on quickly. </p>
<p>"The president has entrusted me with the protection of the obscurial." From the looks on their faces they are as happy about that as he is. "If you can feed him here and then I'll take him back to my apartment, I don't have much food."</p>
<p>"You can't be serious?" Tina is incredulous.</p>
<p>"Careful Tina!" he warns. "The President was adamant I take him-"</p>
<p>"Why!?" Tina again butting in.</p>
<p>"I don't know, she doesn't walk me through her thought process."</p>
<p>"Enough!" its Queenie this time. "Credence will eat and then go with Mister Graves, ok sweetie?" The child gives no indication he has heard her. "I can bring some food over tomorrow and keep him occupied while you work and Tina will be stopping in throughout the day to report in to you so she can keep an eye on Credence as well." Tina nods emphatically.</p>
<p>Graves turns to Newt "How dangerous is the obscurus, has that shrunk as well?" he asks eyeing the child warily.</p>
<p>"I have no idea, nothing like this has ever happened before! Credence as an adult had some control over it. As a child...it will be impossible to tell until..."</p>
<p>"Until it’s too late" Graves finishes. He sighs and sits heavily in a chair across from the boy. "We need to find Grindlewald quickly and somehow force him to reverse his spell." Every adult in the room knew how unlikely that scenario is but dared not upset the child for fear of the obscurus. </p>
<p>They ate in silence and all too soon it was time for Graves to take the boy. Credence went quietly, little shoulders hunched and head bowed. Too timid to throw a tantrum. When they arrived in Graves' apartment he stood still in the middle of the living room, waiting for instruction. Graves had no reference for this situation. He only saw his nieces and nephews once a year, if he made it family Christmas dinner at all. "Follow me" he said gruffly. He led the boy to the guest room, then he went to his wardrobe and shrunk several items of clothing. He left the pile of close on a chair next to the bed where the boy now sat. He summoned a glass of water, then silence fell. "I will be in my room or in the living room working. There are magical wards protecting the house, very few people can get in. This is the safest place for you to be right now." The child continued to stare silently at him, it was unnerving. "Queenie will be here tomorrow morning with food. The bathroom is through the door opposite this room. Well, goodnight then." Its awkward. Graves leaves the door ajar so the boy doesn't feel trapped. This night has turned into a nightmare. </p>
<p>Graves goes to his liquor cabinet and pulls out the fire whisky. He'll need to stock up soon if this living arrangement is to continue he thinks. He sits on the couch staring blankly at the wall sipping at his drink. He is stuck with a mute five-year-old, who may or may not remember a man wearing Graves' face emotionally manipulating him. Graves put his drink down and buries his head in his hands. His mind wanders back to his talks with Tina about the obscurial. No matter what Tina thinks Graves is not a coward. He honestly does believe that him being around the boy will do more damage than good, potentially triggering him. And for all his gruff exterior he wishes no harm on Credence and no matter what Picquery orders Graves will not kill him. He gets up slowly ready for bed, thinking about how tomorrow is a new day.</p>
