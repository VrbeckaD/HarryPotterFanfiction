    <p>   Harry’s tired eyes drooped, slumber almost taking over his built form. He rubbed his eyes with the back of his hands with a sigh. Forms and paperwork of all sorts were scattered out in front of him, most of which had to be sorted through before the next week. </p><p>
  <em>Ah, the joys of muggle jobs where magic wasn’t allowed.</em>
</p><p>Harry mused over the thoughts of sleep blissfully, but it wasn’t like it was going to help his situation much. He quickly stood up before he drifted off, walking out of the muggle office silently. </p><p>There were a few others in building with Harry, but they were scarcely seen.</p><p>Harry stumbled down the marble steps and out the glass doors, weaving in and out of a small group of teens that from the looks of the popcorn and sodas in their hands, just came from the movie theater. </p><p>Within the next five minutes he rounded the corner where a small coffee shop stood. </p><p>Warm string lights twinkled brightly against the stark, pitch black night, like another star. </p><p>Harry opened the door hesitantly, even though he knew for a fact they were open. A soft bell tinkled above his head, which Harry winced at the noise. </p><p>“Harry?” A ‘smooth as honey’ voice asked, coming from a girl with frizzy fluffed up hair in what he would call a ‘poof’. Her hot chocolate skin stood out beautifully in her gold-ish top and worn jeans, and All Stars adorned her feet. </p><p>“Hey Cassie.” Harry greeted warmly, taking a seat at the counter top as Cassie walked to the register to the left of it. </p><p>“Lemme guess,” Cassie rested her elbows on the empty space next to the register. “Carrow making you work late again?” </p><p>Austin Carrow was his boss, who did in fact, normally make Harry work late, but this time it was unintentional. </p><p>
  <em>Hopefully.</em>
</p><p> “Nah, not purposely at least. Just with Summer coming to an end, we have a lot of deadlines coming up.” Harry shrugged, ignoring the look Cassie shot him. </p><p>“Mhm. That man should give you a promotion, you’re not his lap dog.”</p><p>Secretly, he agreed, but he’d never voice it and give Cassie the satisfaction of how she <em>knew</em> it.</p><p>Harry just gave another shrug, almost laughing at her expression. “I’ll take my usual, Cass.”</p><p>“Whatever. You know I’m right.” </p><p>Cassie muttered, before getting to work on Harry’s drink. </p><p>The sounds of the coffee machine gave him a sense of calm, one of the reasons he came here so much. </p><p>Cassie soon enough handed him his drink, the hot steam fogging up his glasses. </p><p>“One extremely caffeinated latte with a drizzle of caramel and topped with whipped cream. Gosh, you’re almost as bad as Tim Drake from the comics. I don’t  know how drinking that much caffeine at night doesn’t kill you.”</p><p>”Magic.” Harry murmured between sips. </p><p>Cassie gave a snort to that, rolling her eyes. </p><p>“I wish. Do you want me to put that drink on your bill or pay upfront?”</p><p>Harry just stuffed a wad of cash into her hand as a response.</p><p>She took it with a huff, putting the money away. </p><p>“You know, you could use your words.”</p><p>He snorted. “Whatever, Cass.”</p><p>”So,” Cassie slid up onto the counter next to him and crossed her legs, applesauce style. “ I’ve got a new recruit coming in tomorrow.”</p><p>Harry almost spit out his drink at her words.</p><p>Cassie almost never hired. She liked to run her business herself, with the help of a few trusted employees. </p><p>He would know from experience, it took a lot to get on the trusted list.</p><p>”who’s lucky enough to join your staff?”</p><p>”Just some guy I met at the bookstore on Wright street. You know, the one with the special rooms in the back? Well, he’s there almost everyday, cozied up, flipping through a stack of books. I told him the nights here are pretty quiet here, so he could just do that here and get paid.”</p><p>Harry gave a small snicker at how much this guy reminded of Hermione, who, coincidentally, was good friends with Cassie.</p><p>”Sounds like a great addition, Cass.” Definitely your friend group.”</p><p>”I know, right? I’m pretty excited to have him come. Although, don’t annoy the crap out of him, ‘Kay? He doesn’t need Harry Potter the man who acts like a child on his case.”</p><p>Harry just smirked, taking one last sip of his latte. </p><p>“Well Cassie, I gotta go finish up. See you in a week or two?”</p><p>”yeah, see ya. Or maybe you’ll see blondie, you know, he seems like your type.” Cass saluted him goodbye, before hopping of the counter and disappearing in the back.</p><p>”Cass!” Harry grumbled, before walking out the door.</p><p>Harry took his coffee in the to go mug and held it tightly, it being the only thing keeping him still awake.</p><p>He made it back to his office with a deep sigh, plopping back down in his chair, starting to sort through the papers again. </p><p>Within the next hour his eyes got heavy again, but this time he succumbed to the feeling, fatigue taking over his body. His mind drifted, and his eyesight slowly faded to black. </p>
