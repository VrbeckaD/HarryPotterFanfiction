    <p>Located on the fringes of existence, folded somewhere between the fabric of space and tucked neatly into the abyss of time, a vast and empty landscape stretched as far as the eye could see. </p><p>The sky, painted in a color that could be described as pale gray, or perhaps a worn ivory. The flat ground, hard and cracked, is equally as bland in color. </p><p>It is a pale and colorless barren world that makes up Death's Realm. </p><p>The only features to break up the monotony are the countless circular pools of blue light embedded in the dry cracked ground. </p><p>If one were to peer closely into these pools of light, one would be able to witness the events of various times and dimensions playing out within. There are grand scenes that range from humans dressed in armour and carrying spears engaged in war to humans constructing great structures of civilization. Then there are less grand but still fascinating scenes of humans living ordinary everyday lives in a more peaceful and technologically advanced society. And further still there are fantastical scenes to be glimpsed in the dragons that soar in the skies and the silver haired humans who ride them in one pool of light to the tall and graceful elves that roam in the forests of another.  </p><p>But perhaps most curious of all were the scenes of boys and girls with unruly raven black hair or wild crimson locks but all carrying the lightning bolt scar that they share in common performing feats of magic. </p><p>Above the barren ground and its infinite pools of blue light floats a majestic castle with spiralling towers, arching ceilings and tall windows constructed completely from obsidian glass. The black glassy structure seems to suck in the dull light of the pale sky and the ethereal blue of the circular pools while refracting those very same rays of light at the same time. </p><p>It is on the very tallest of the four towers that grace the glass castle that the King of this still and barren world, this lifeless plane known as Death's Realm, awakens from his most recent slumber.</p><p>Sprawled on a throne-like chair carved from ebony as dark as the long silky mane that flow over the chair's right arm-rest like spilled ink, the figure shifts infinitesimally, the only sign of their awakening in the slight twitch of pale fingers against robes of black smoke, the quiver of inky lashes and the furrowing of equally dark brows. </p><p>"Slept well?"</p><p>Blinking open luminous burning eyes of unnatural viridity in a pale face equally devoid of humanity, the being - Man? God? - focused those two shocking spots of life and color, in an otherwise dead and monochrome world, on the opposite throne-like chair. </p><p>Or more specifically, on the skull of a ram with thick, curling horns and long, slender visage placed on it. </p><p>"Quite. How long has it been this time?"</p><p>A question of idle curiosity, hinted by the apathetic tones and impassive face. The being's attention already drifting to the chessboard with its pieces arranged in the midst of a game on top of the low round table separating the two chairs. It all appeared as if the being had only nodded off briefly while waiting for their opponent's move. </p><p>"Does it matter?"</p><p>"I suppose not." A bitter sigh. A crack in the mask of indifference.</p><p>And indeed, time held no sway over primordial and eternal beings such as them. </p><p>Such knowledge, however, brought no joy to the humanoid of the two.</p><p>"Tsk. You are wasting away in this self-imposed isolation of yours."</p><p>"Eternal ennui will do that. If I cannot find oblivion through active means perhaps I will try passivity instead." The being retorted with petulance.</p><p>The Other did not reply though it did emit a surprising amount of annoyance for an inanimate object that normally lacked petty human emotions.</p><p>In a retaliation too fast for the being to avoid, the ram skull had lifted itself into the air and headbutted its companion with those wickedly curved horns. </p><p>"Ow!" An indignant shout broke the tranquility that permeates Death's Realm. "What was that for?!"</p><p>"For being a whiny human." </p><p>The being frowned visibly in irritation, completely giving up their mask of apathy. Not many things could truly affect them but the Other was a special existence. A dark glare equal parts enticing and intimidating when being conveyed from those sharply sculpted features, unsettling in their inhuman perfection but undeniably awe-inspiring in the way icy blocks of glaciers, snow topped mountains, and golden sand dunes are. </p><p>The oppressively dangerous aura that only comes with indomitable power, however, was completely shattered when the being accused their companion, sounding more like a whining child than an ageless immortal capable of bending reality and controlling the balance of life and death. "This situation is entirely your fault. Why did you have to go and create those blasted things?" </p><p>"Selective amnesia is unbecoming of you. May I remind you, you were the one complaining of boredom." Settling back on its chair, the skull manages to give off the impression of shrugging its nonexistent shoulders.</p><p>"Besides, I rather doubt you would have a different fate even without the Hallows. It was the will of the universe."</p><p>Before the same conversation lead to the same rant from its companion, the Other changed the subject in well practiced ease that successfully headed off another angst-filled tantrum from its companion.</p><p>"It is nearing three centuries since you had last walked the mortal planes. Perhaps a visit to an alternate world that you have yet to explore? A change of pace will do wonders for your unfortunate regression into a toddler."</p><p>Another annoyed glare was directed to their snarky companion. "Why does Death have to be a snarky talking sheep skull?" A rhetorical moan of complaint. </p><p>"It's a ram skull, thank you. And do I have to remind you that we are one and the same? As we are, in essence, the same entity since you have taken up your new post, you are only insulting yourself. And they call you the Master." A quick and snide reply.</p><p>The previously unidentified being, now known as the King of Death's Realm and the Master of Death, sighed in annoyed frustration. </p><p>It has been close to five millennia since Harry Potter has died and the being known as the Master of Death took his place. </p><p>Perhaps the title "Master of Death" is inaccurate, as most mortal constructions are bound to be. Contrary to the Tale of the Three Brothers, Death was not a sentient being that one could gain control over. While he had control over matters that related to death, it was not as simple as gaining immortality or ferrying souls to the afterlife. </p><p>No, being Master of Death meant that the concepts of Death and Life, were personified in him, whereas before they had just been natural processes of the universe. After all, death and life are two sides of the same coin. If he was Death, then that also meant he was Life as well. It had been a shock when he first learned the true extent to his powers and duties.</p><p>His main duty was to make sure there was a balance between life and death energies. In other words, making sure souls depart for the afterlife when their time was up, not before or after. But that whole business is carried out entirely by his servants, blue wraiths that pass like ghosts through the various worlds that make up the universe Death has dominion, only making occasional pit stops in Death's Realm. It was rare but he only got involved if there was an imbalance caused from too many untimely deaths which result in a surplus of life energy that needs to be redistributed before it brings chaos down upon the mortal worlds. An even rarer occurrence is the deficit in life energy in which case it was his responsibility to ah, bring up the mortality rate as it were. </p><p>Before he took up the post, the processes of Death and Life had been left to run naturally without a keeper, which meant a build up or lack of life energy depending on the world, and both which lead to chaos ravaging the mortal worlds. Whole worlds had been destroyed by the chaotic energy. In fact, his own original world had also been affected, the chaotic energy causing magic to slowly dwindle and would have ceased to exist along with the rest of life had it not been his timely appointment. </p><p>So many worlds were showing signs of destruction and chaos it came to the point where the universe activated a self-defense mechanism, for lack of a better description. His collection of the Deathly Hallows had not been as much of an accident as he had thought and far from the manipulation of a mortal, no matter how far-seeing Dumbledore had been. In fact, they were trials willed by the universe and carried out by himself, chosen by the universe to be the worthy keeper to right the balance that had been left to tip precariously since the beginning of existence. Many had collected the Hallows and undergone the accompanying trials but none had been chosen in the end. Good examples were the many alternate versions of himself in the universe, some of whom he had even met, and all had collected the Hallows. However, he was the only one to have been chosen to take up the cursed title. Even after millennia he was still unclear why he was the unlucky mortal who had been chosen. Indeed, there had been nothing random about his fate as he later discovered when it had turned out that the creator of the Hallows had in fact been himself. Even now that discovery continues to confuse and vex him greatly. </p><p>Others in his position would have been ecstatic. After all, he had unimaginable power, a literal God with control over life and death. And as far as he knew, he was the higher power of the universe, able to change the fates of billions with a single thought. His only responsibilities were little and the balance was easy to fix and maintain. But as far as he was concerned, the drawbacks outweighed the benefits. Without any responsibilities or challenges there was only so much one could fill his unlimited time with whatever that strikes his fancy, be it magic, science, music, art, people, etc - made all the more easy with the astonishing memory that came along with his new immortality. </p><p>Nor can he completely prevent himself from falling into a state of ennui by hopping from one alternate world to another and creating alternate worlds of alternate worlds through meddling with the timeline and/or events before that lost its appeal. The mortal worlds could be amusing and he had come across many interesting individuals. Interesting enough to extend their life with the surplus life energies floating around and even bestowing some of his own powers. But his interest never remained long because he had found that immortality, whether true immortality like his own, or a bastardization through the gifting of his powers and bestowing of a longer life always changed them, resulting in the loss of the very things he had been drawn in by. Was he not a great example of how eternity could change a mortal? After all, he was no longer the naive boy who believed in good and evil. In fact, he had been the instigator of many of the natural and mortal disasters that resulted in the deaths of millions, countless of whom had been innocents, in order to right the balance between life and death. Killing millions to save whole worlds - utilitarianism at its finest.</p><p>And for all his power, he could not resign from his position and join the dead in the afterlife, the only thing he desired. As the Master who personified Life and Death, he (obviously) could not be killed. But through personal experience during his desperate phase, he could be injured, wounded, torn apart, atomized, liquefied, or otherwise obliterated, but he always recovered into the flawless, truly eternal being that he is in short order. Much like a phoenix, a creature who symbolizes life and death, as Death he could not be truly killed and as Life he was regenerated soon afterwards. It was pointless and redundant. A fact that he eventually learned, all the while being treated to a liberal amount of disparaging remarks from his only constant companion.</p><p>The ram skull, his Other Self, had been present since he first ended his mortal life as Harry Potter at the age of nineteen when he had been hit with his third Killing Curse while rounding up the remaining Voldemort followers and supporters, and subsequently made the transformation into the Master. </p><p>He had woken up in the King's chambers of the glass castle in Death's Realm, human biology completely overturned, wrapped in the Invisibility Cloak, wearing the unbroken Resurrection Stone set in elegant silver on his left index finger, and clutching the Elder Wand in his right hand. The ram skull had been perched on the pillow next to him and nearly caused him to let out an expletive when it first spoke. However, he did let loose a string of expletives after learning that they are both the same entity, the same being, two sides of a coin. </p><p>To say that it is a situation that he is unhappy about would be an understatement. However, while he had eventually given up ever returning to being just Harry, he is reluctant to refer to himself as the Master, a small and pointless act of denial he has yet to give up. Instead, he has taken to identifying himself as Hadrian J. Peverell, an alias that has gradually become true over time.</p><p>Even after millennia, it is still strange to acknowledge the fact that they are essentially what dissociative identity disorder would be like given form. A coping mechanism he had somehow created even before eternity truly began to drive him mad. Though whether it is only driving him insane faster is still in question.</p><p>Deciding to not argue with himself as the case may be, Hadrian tried to get himself excited at the prospect of a visit to an unfamiliar world. </p><p>"And do you have in mind a certain location?"</p><p>"Nope."</p><p>"Of course. Spin the Deathstick it is then." Not even bothering to acknowledge his Other's lack of responsibility.</p><p>In an inhuman show of grace and weightlessness, Hadrian glided to his full height of 5 feet 11 inches, 6 feet had he been wearing boots. The Invisibility Cloak draped loosely over his shoulders and contrasted against the long inky waves of slightly unruly hair that seem to blend into the smokey black robe he has taken to wear over the past millennia. The Resurrection Stone as always, rests on his left index finger while the Elder Wand is stuck haphazardly in his hair in a negligent attempt to pin the rebellious strands back from his face. </p><p>Pale, shoeless feet tapped silently on the smooth glass floor as he moved to the very ledge of the tower that lack any barrier preventing a dangerous plunge down.</p><p>Staring out at his domain and the pools of blue light that dot the landscape and grace the otherwise barren world with an eerie beauty, Hadrian reached pale slender hands out from the voluminous sleeves to lift the ram skull and fit it against a face that look far too young and beautiful and eyes far too nature green and bright to be the face of Death but appropriate for a being known also as Life.</p><p>With a single step, he plunged over the tower.</p><p>In the middle of freefall, three pairs of great black feathered wings with an impressive wingspan burst from the eternally youthful being's back to ride the wind currents and carry their owner down towards the pools of blue light, close enough that his bare feet could skim them if he wanted. </p><p>Long, dusty memories of flying on his Firebolt, on the backs of a hippogriff, a thestral, and a dragon, as well as the joy and exhilaration that accompanied them resurfaced in his mind palace, bringing a true smile on those pale, thin lips. Regrettably, it was hidden from view behind the ghostly mask.</p><p>It would seem that the only thing that could not lose its appeal was flying. That immortality came with his own set(s) of wings is probably the only aspect he enjoys about his immortal state.</p><p>After a while soaring across his domain, Hadrian paused in midair to pull the Elder Wand from his hair which instantly tumbled loose to frame the ram skull currently masquerading as a mask, creating an appearance that was reminiscent of the enigmatic and indomitable horned gods depicted in mortal tales.</p><p>Hadrian allowed the wand to spin in midair until it stopped, following the direction it pointed to on wings of tangible night.</p><p>Landing beside a pool of blue light that could not be differentiated from all the others, Hadrian crouched down to stir the substance that seems half water, half light with the point of the Elder Wand. Much like one would stir the contents of a pensieve. </p><p>The window and portal into one of the many worlds of the universe depicted an unfamiliar reality in which supernatural beings exist legally and even peacefully alongside their human counterparts in a modern society. </p><p>"Huh. Interesting." Hadrian mused thoughtfully. For what felt like in ages, he found his interest peaked.</p><p>Hadrian has not visited his original world in centuries but he knew that the wizarding world has yet to integrate with the Muggles and likely never will out of choice. This new world has no true witches and wizards, instead it has Wiccans and Voodoos who are able to use magic but on a weaker level to the wizarding world. It was mostly nature related and used for healing, for protection, fertility, or to banish negative influences though the effect was not as miraculous. The few harmful magic practiced by Wiccans and Voodoos were also not nearly as destructive as wizard spells could be, at least in terms of battle magic, enchanting and warding. Few beings can compare to wizards in terms of large scale magical destruction.  </p><p>The truly supernaturally powerful beings in this world would have to be the vampires with wereanimals slightly less so. Hadrian knew that the vampires and werewolves in his original world lacked any magic unless they had been wizards before the turn but that does not seem to be the case in this one. </p><p>Over the years, Hadrian has interacted with a great number of supernatural or magical creatures from countless alternate worlds but vampires and weres had never inspired any interest in him. Why would they when faced with more fantastical creatures such as elven warriors, the Fae, and shapeshifting dragons?</p><p>He suppose this is a chance to observe vampire magic.</p><p>With that thought, the enigmatic figure of one Hadrian J. Peverell, otherwise know as the Master of Death and the reluctant King of Death's Realm, stepped forward and sunk into the pool of blue light, disappearing from sight.<br/>

July 10, 2017<br/>
St. Louis, Missouri</p><p>Leisurely strolling down the streets of crowded people, Hadrian remained unnoticed as he observed the mortal happenings occurring around him. </p><p>It was a hot summer evening and the crowds would have been an annoyance were it not for his powers repelling them in a five meter radius around him, allowing him to pass by without being jostled or bombarded by body odor. Not that any of them noticed who walked in their midst. </p><p>If Hadrian had revealed himself, he was quite sure there would have been screams and traffic accidents. For he had not bothered to change a thing of his otherworldly appearance. The ram skull mask and black robes would have most likely been unsettling, not to mention the inhuman way he moved, his bare feet making no contact with the ground.</p><p>As he drifted through the crowds like a specter, Hadrian eventually walked into an area of neon lights and even more crowds.</p><p>Some of the venues along the street had posters of vampire movies, or catch-phrases from novels most likely about vampires. Tourists were wandering in groups and couples and whispering excitedly as they pointed out dark windows and bright signs.</p><p>Hadrian had seen much in his long life, but this managed to be one of those eye-brow raising moments. Particularly when he came across a building with a garish pink neon sign. </p><p>There was a long line of people waiting outside with a vampire acting as a bouncer in front of what, upon closer inspection, turned out to be a vampire strip club. A blink of incredulity at the ridiculousness of it all. And then he sensed it.</p><p>He thought he had been mistaken. But no, when he moved closer, the feeling only got stronger. A whisper of his magic, his powers, was inside that building. Intrigued, he moved past the line of people and vampire bouncer, stepping through the doors and towards the source of his curiosity. He had been quite sure he had never visited this particular world before not to mention leave something behind that practically reeked of his magic.</p><p>"How unexpected. Something interesting already?" Hadrian murmured to himself, his voice dissipating under the loud music and screams coming from the stage where a vampire was currently thrusting against a pole.</p><p>Going up the stairs which lead to a hall with only one door, Hadrian turned the door knob without hesitation.</p><p>The door closed softly behind him as Hadrian looked around a fairly boring room with a white couch, a white carpet, black walls and a black desk. Sitting behind the desk was another vampire; with a white shirt and black hair, he matched the room. </p><p>Interestingly, despite the repelling charm he is keeping up, the vampire had actually looked up in his direction as if he had noticed the door opening and closing, an invisible entity now standing in his office. </p><p>Hadrian idly noted this irregularity as his attention was taken by the pendant that was hanging from the vampire's neck. A highly polished sapphire the size of a robin's egg hung from a plain silver chain with a curious symbol engraved into the center of the jewel, the symbol of the Deathly Hallows and the Master of Death, to be more exact. A circle enclosing a triangle with a line bisecting the center. And Hadrian could tell instantly that it was his handiwork, created and charmed personally by him.</p><p>Looking up, he noticed that the vampire had moved, sweeping to his feet in a show of inhuman grace. His eyes were glowing a bright blue and still focused in his direction.</p><p>It would seem that the vampire had sensed his presence. Most likely a side effect of the pendant imbued with his magic.</p><p>"It is most impolite to enter without invitation, monsieur. Or is it mademoiselle?" A light French accent.</p><p>Hadrian examined the vampire in interest. The pendant was his creation but the owner he had no recollection of. Deciding to reveal himself, he lifted the hood of the Invisibility Cloak thereby breaking its effect, allowing it to masquerade as a silvery cloak and his appearance to fade into being, his aura filling the room. It was always amusing whenever he chose to reveal himself, whether the target was a human or a creature. Predictable in their fear, but amusing nonetheless.</p><p>What he received, however, was not the fear he had expected, but a strange mix of elation, adoration, and longing.</p><p>Thankfully, the skull mask hid the dumbfounded expression that crept up on his face for just a moment. It was soon replaced with one of intrigue.</p><p>In what looked like a blink of an eye, but to Hadrian a normal walking speed, the vampire had moved from behind his desk and across the room to stand in front of him. Hadrian idly noted the vampire to be two inches taller than him.</p><p>"Is that you, mon ange? Have you come back to me?" </p><p>Hadrian watched with continued interest as the pale shaking hand reached up towards his face, stopping just shy of touching the bone of his mask, as if afraid of it all being an illusion. He also wondered at the endearment which spoke of familiarity between them that he does not recall.</p><p>He finally spoke up. "You know me, vampire?"</p><p>Blinking at the contradictory expressions of anguish and elation, Hadrian remained still, content to wait for his answers. He was not in a hurry after all, and nor did he want the mystery to be over so quickly.</p><p>Composing himself together, the vampire's eyes remained unblinking as he stared. And if Hadrian had been anyone else, he would have certainly been unsettled for he could catch a flicker of obsession in those lovely blue eyes that glowed bright with vampire magic and matched the sapphire that hung from his neck.</p><p>"Have you forgotten? You were the one who gave this to me, mon ange, Hadrian. It has protected me these many years while I searched for you." Dropping his hand to stroke lovingly at the pendant, the vampire kept his eyes on the enigmatic figure in front of him.</p><p>Hearing his name absolved any possibility that this was just a simple case of mistaken identity. It would seem that sometime during his wanderings among timelines and worlds, he had made the acquaintance of this particular vampire. And had become invested enough to gift him an amulet of protection imbued heavily with his magic.</p><p>"Ah yes. You do have something of mine. I do not, however, recall meeting you, much less giving it to you." Drifting over to the leather couches, he touched the back of an armrest idly, ignoring how the vampire followed closely.</p><p>"Well, it has been centuries since. If you allow it, I would like to refresh your memory. Or simply get to know me again." In a smooth gesture, the vampire lifted his hand in his, bowing over it as he pressed soft lips to the back of his hand. "It is my pleasure to meet you again, mon ange. My name is Jean-Claude." The vampire's confidence had returned, accompanied by the seductive power that all vampires possess and that this one seemed to wield in abundance. Not that Hadrian was affected in anyway as he quirked his lips in amusement, ignoring the vampire's voice tickling his skin. </p><p>Jean-Claude was an intriguing distraction from his ennui. It did not hurt that he was also pleasant to look at. </p><p>"Hello, Jean-Claude. My name is Hadrian. Hadrian James Peverell." He added the rest of his names in an afterthought.</p><p>Removing his hand when the vampire, Jean-Claude, lingered too long, Hadrian moved away to sink down on one of the couches, elegantly sprawling on it with his elbow propped up on the armrest.</p><p>Jean-Claude settled closely next to him with no regard for personal space, his ridiculously tight leather clad thigh pressed up against his robed one.</p><p>"Will you take down your mask? I have not seen you for so long, mon ange." Jean-Claude entreated, fingers reaching out to curl a lock of his hair.</p><p>Hadrian eyed him in interest, allowing the liberty taken with his person. It had been awhile since he had gone without his mask among mortals. And yes, vampires were mortals to him. Anything that can die were mortals.</p><p>A moment later, the ram skull mask faded into nothing, leaving his face bare and his otherworldly beauty revealed.</p><p>A sharp inhale of breath was heard. "Mon ange…you look just as I remembered. So beautiful…"</p><p>Too blue eyes were partially hidden by lowered lashes but Hadrian could still feel the heavy gaze as it greedily took in his features.</p><p>Hadrian never understood why the few mortals that gazed upon his true appearance became so enamoured with his physical appearance.  He knew that he did not look human.</p><p>Sure, he has taken on the shape, but the one time he ever studied his reflection, he always felt that something was wrong with the visage. The angles and lines, are too crisp, too polished. Too symmetrical.</p><p>All the softness of humanity, the flaws, have been bled out of him, leaving him to become something more, and yet less, all at the same time. Even vampires did not look this unearthly and as if they did not belong. It was a reminder that he was no longer human. No longer mortal.</p><p> They were interrupted, however, to the obvious displeasure of Jean-Claude by a knocking on the door. </p><p>"What is it, Robert. It had better be important." </p><p>The coldness was completely different to the lovestruck feeling he had been giving off previously. This was the master vampire's true nature it seemed. Or at least in front of others.</p><p>There was a pause before the door opened and a blonde vampire entered. Before he could speak, however, he caught sight of Hadrian. Hadrian observed in apathy as Robert the vampire stood still with a dazed look on his face, eyes dilated.</p><p>Jean-Claude cleared his throat in irritation, getting smoothly to his feet and blocking Hadrian possessively from view.</p><p>"Robert." There was a hidden warning in that one word.</p><p>Blinking back to attention, Robert quickly responded. "It's the master of the city. She has orders for you."</p><p>Irritation was replaced with seriousness as Jean-Claude looked at the papers he was given. Robert had already left the room, respectfully closing the door behind him, not daring to steal one last glance at Hadrian.</p><p>"Problems, Jean-Claude?" Hadrian remained on the couch, watching as the vampire went to sit behind his desk.</p><p>"My apologies, mon ange. There have been murders of the vampires under the master of the city. I have been ordered to look into it." Casting an apologetic look at Hadrian, blue eyes soft with affection.</p><p>"Hmm. I did not know you had a master. Why? You are a master vampire yourself."</p><p>Jean-Claude smiled ruefully, "Many are more powerful than I. Nikolaus is one example. I have your protection from the pendant but while that allows me to not fear from harm or forced into something unwilling from stronger vampires, it does not give me the power to overcome them either."</p><p>Hadrian tapped his fingers idly on the armrest. Indeed, the pendant was charmed purely for defensive and protective purposes. </p><p>"Will you be staying, mon ange?" </p><p>Looking up into hopeful blue eyes that were a midnight blue, almost black without the vampire magic making them a glowing bright blue, Hadrian found himself nodding. It was not like he had anything better to do.<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
And Hadrian had stayed, the both of them needing no sleep. Or at least not during the night. He watched Jean-Claude do paperwork, which would have been boring if not for occasional snatches of conversation that was mostly centered on the past six centuries Jean-Claude had been alive. Hadrian offered no information of his own, though he knew the other was curious.</p><p>He also learned that their first encounter had been during Jean-Claude's childhood when he had yet to be inflicted with the vampire curse.</p><p>Dawn eventually came and Jean-Claude had to return to his daytime resting place under the Circus of the Damned, the residence of the master of St. Louis and daytime resting place for the St. Louis kiss of vampires. </p><p>Out of curiosity, Hadrian accompanied Jean-Claude while being visible only to the other to observe the rest of the vampires of the city and their boss. It was not particularly inspiring. Jean-Claude seemed to be the only vampire he had come across that was tolerable and even interesting company.</p><p>He stayed until Jean-Claude fell under vampire sleep, looking very much like a pretty corpse who had died with a smile on his face.</p>
