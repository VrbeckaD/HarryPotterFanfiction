    <p>“Now do you understand?  Do you see?” the woman screamed at her captive, knife clenched tightly in her fist.</p>
<p>He cringed back against the wall he was kneeling beside, panting.  Ruffled dark blonde hair, cut short, but still long enough that the bangs hung over his forehead, shook in time with his labored breathing and trembling.  Blue eyes gazed up at his captor, fear, sympathy, and sorrow mixing in their depths.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he whispered, not daring to say anything more.  Hoping, praying he wouldn’t escalate her even more.</p>
<p>She stared at him, dismay twisting her face at the lack of recognition on his.  “You don’t know?”</p>
<p>Confusion furrowed his forehead, brows drawing together, sweat gleaming on his face and in his hair.  The sweat dripped down his arm, trickling over a silver bracelet on his left wrist.  Green flickered, shifted to black.  Around his neck, a black leather choker embedded with a crystal went unnoticed in the darkness.  Magic curled around the crystal, which glowed a tainted red, black mixing and streaking the bloody hue.</p>
<p>Her brother called her name, but she stayed focused on <em>him</em>.  “You don’t know who I am?”</p>
<p>Blue unfocused and her captive gasped as if he wasn’t getting enough air; though his body shook with fear and dread, chest heaving for oxygen, his silence made the answer clear to her.</p>
<p>Her grip tightened on her knife.  “Then I’ll make sure that you never forget.”</p>
<p>Unnoticed by either sibling, the badge on their captive’s belt flared to life, the eagle above the crossed sword, rifle, and wand letting out a silent cry.</p>

<p>Brown eyes snapped open, their owner gasping as his stomach rebelled.  Mentally, he fought back, suppressing the nausea with stubborn, iron will.  Rolling on his side, the man groaned, clutching his head; pain slammed through him, from the jackhammers in his skull to the chills running up and down his spine, the nausea, and the tremors racking his muscles.</p>
<p>Trembling, he pushed himself up, heading for the bathroom; he flicked the light on, gasped, and slammed it off.  Darkness enfolded him, soothing light-sensitive eyes while he threw up in the toilet.  Minutes later, Greg Parker staggered back to his feet after flushing the mess and studied his reflection.  Haggard, pale, and in no shape to work.  Shaky fingers pulled the mirror outwards and he tugged the strongest pain meds in the apartment down.  The child-proof lid nearly defeated him, but he persisted, tossing back two pills and dry-swallowing.</p>
<p>Shivering violently, he stumbled back to his bedroom, locating his landline and squinting to keep the dim light out of his eyes.  He dialed the number from memory, hitting the call button an instant before he happened to glance over at his bedside clock.  2:17 AM gazed serenely back at him.</p>
<p>He winced even as his boss picked up with a brisk, worried, “Commander Holleran speaking.”</p>
<p>“Sir?” Greg rasped, “Sorry to call so early…”</p>
<p>The commander audibly relaxed.  “No rest for the sick, Greg?”</p>
<p>“Something like that.”  The words scraped against his raw throat.</p>
<p>“All right, Sergeant, stay home.  Call me this evening if you need tomorrow off.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>
<p>The phone clicked off and Parker crawled back under his covers, suppressing a groan as the world decided to spin around him; his chest and stomach clenched with cold, even under the layers of sheets and blankets.  A sense of <em>wrongness</em> assaulted him, but he was too miserable to pay much notice.  Somehow, despite the searing headache, he went back to sleep.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes again, morning peeked through the windows.  His stomach churned with nausea and hunger, so Greg forced himself out of bed and made his way to the kitchen in search of something plain enough to keep down.  Inside, he found his <em>nipotes</em>, both of them just as miserable as he was and gazing up at him with dull hope that they wouldn’t be sent anywhere except back to bed.</p>
<p>The Sergeant reversed course and retrieved the pain meds from the bathroom.  Back in the kitchen, he popped the bottle open and dispensed the relief within to his suffering charges.  “I’ll call the school,” Greg said.  “None of us is going anywhere today.”</p>
<p>All he got were nods, before his <em>nipotes</em> slunk back towards their bedrooms.  With a ginger shake of his head, Parker found his kitchen phone and called the school.  The woman on the other end promised to let the kids’ teachers know and the negotiator thanked her before hanging up and going back to bed himself.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Mid-afternoon, with the nausea finally ebbing and his hunger demanding attention, Greg made his way to the kitchen and rummaged through the ‘fridge for leftovers.  The roast beef Wordy had brought them over the weekend, joking that Shelley insisted on ‘paying’ the kids, caught his eye and he tugged the ceramic container out.  Three chunks of beef migrated to his plate and he grabbed a handy microwave-safe lid to cover the plate before warming his meal.</p>
<p>Parker headed for the living room with his bounty, only to pause in the doorway at the sight of a feathered tail peeking out from behind the coffee table.  Curious, he craned his neck and suppressed a snicker at the sight of his fledgling wedged between table and couch.  Illishar turned his head, whining at his uncle and plainly disinclined to move.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Greg returned to the kitchen and settled at the table to eat.  Partway through, his ‘team sense’ flared to life; he started, tensing – the <em>last</em> time his ‘team sense’ had done this, Eddie had gotten shot.  But no fresh pain radiated through him and the emotions – a dizzying mix of affection, glee, irritation, dismay, and more – held no hint of trouble.  In fact, it felt very much like he was being bombarded by his <em>entire</em> team, something that hadn’t happened in <em>years</em>.</p>
<p>The Sergeant grimaced, reaching inwards to flick the ‘team sense’ off…he was <em>sick</em>, he was <em>off</em>, Eddie could handle things today…but after a few moments, it surged within him; his stomach gave an uncomfortable lurch.  Stubbornly, Greg forced his ‘team sense’ off again, but as soon as his attention slipped, it turned on once more.  After a few more tries resulted in failure, he gave up; his team’s emotions were forcing the ‘team sense’ on and there was nothing he could do about it.</p>
<p>Too lost in misery to wonder why his constables, normally keen to keep their emotions to themselves as much as possible, were suddenly sending every last scrap his way while he was off <em>sick</em>, Greg Parker went back to bed again, wondering if his nephew would mind changing <em>him</em> to gryphon form if it meant his headache would go away.</p>
