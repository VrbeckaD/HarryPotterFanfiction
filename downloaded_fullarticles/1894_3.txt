    <p> It was the start of the fourth year for Mildred Hubble, Indigo Moon and their friends. Both Mildred and Indigo had hopes that this year was going to be normal: no evil witches, turning students into animals, magical ice or no more wishing stars.</p><p>''well met, Mildred,'' Indigo smiled. ''Well met, Indigo,'' Mildred smiled back,'' How was your summer?'' ''Amazing, Joy is looking after me!''Indigo said, smiling smugly. ''What?!'' Mildred sniggered, eyes wide,'' seriously? HB?!'' ''Beleive me!''Indigo said. Indigo looks at Mildred, who was looking behind her. Indigo looks at the same place where Mildred was staring at... It was Ethel Hallow, followed by Mrs Hallow.</p><p> ''why is Ethel here?''Indigo asked Mildred,'' Why isn't she expelled?!'' ''Apparently, they gave her another chance,'' Mildred said, walking towards where Ethel stood shamefully next to her angry mother.</p><p> They could hear the conversation between Ethel and her mother. ''Mother, I told you that there will be no more problems!''Ethel told her mother, though she was kind of happy that finally, her mother has paid more attention to her. ''Of course, there will be more problems!''Mrs Hallow complained,'' I can not trust you to make the hallow's name any better! You will probably make it worse than you have already made it!'' Ethel felt anger towards her mother, she said,'' Luckily they won't expel me!'' ''Do stop it Ethel or the next place you're going is home and a tutor!'' Mrs Hallow warned.</p><p> Mildred smiled, hearing the bell ring. ''Thank you, Mrs Hallow,'' Mildred said walking away, to where Indigo waited for her with Maud and Enid. ''What did Mrs Hallow want from you?''Maud asked. ''with Ethel?''Enid frowned. ''not much,'' Mildred said, walking inside the school with her three friends.</p><p> ''So, How was your summer with HB or... Joy?''Enid asked. ''Was she nice?''Maud asked. ''She was actually great to be with,'' Indigo smiled,'' Well, we had a lot of ice cream, we ate 3 boxes in a week.'' ''A week?!''Mildred laughed. ''HB... eating ice cream?!''Enid sniggered. ''why? What do you all see Joy as?''Indigo asked she did not understand why her friends saw Joy as some kind of witch that does nothing but work. Well, Indigo did see Joy like that but when they became friends it became different; Indigo saw Joy as a fun person.</p><p> ''I do feel bad for Sybil,'' Maud mentioned as they walked down the corridor, just after placing their suitcases in their rooms. ''Yeah,'' Enid said,'' I agree.'' ''Who is Sybil?''Indigo asked. ''one of Ethel's sisters,'' Mildred explained, bumping past some new first years. ''How many sisters does Ethel have?''Indigo asked. ''two,'' Enid said,'' her older sister, Esmerelda, goes to pentangle's now.'' ''But why do you feel bad for Sybil?''Indigo asked. ''She always thought Ethel was well behaved and wouldn't ruin the hallow's reputation,'' Maud explained.</p><p> ''When Ethel pretended to save the school and it was exposed that Ethel was just tricking everyone... Sybil was so ashamed, she didn't even speak to Ethel,'' Mildred said as they walked into the great hall.</p><p> They sat down on the first row of chairs, as they were one of the first in the great hall. ''I can't believe this is my first actual year at cackle's!''Indigo mentioned,'' I just hope that Ethel won't be an annoying brat.'' They chuckle at Indigo's choice of words. ''I wonder if anything has changed in HB?''Enid said. ''I think she will be different...if she kept her promise,'' Indigo said looking at Hecate, as she walked across the great hall; checking if everyone has arrived.</p><p>''what promise?''Maud asked Indigo. ''That she'd try to be kinder to us all,'' Indigo said. ''I don't think she'd promise anything like that,'' Enid pointed out. ''We are good friends, she said that she would try,'' Indigo said, noticing that Hecate was looking their direction.</p><p> ''Well, Mildred Hubble...Maud spellbody...Enid Nightshade and Indigo moon,'' Hecate says smugly,'' I see you are all back in a great mood... let's hope it stays that way.'' The four girls look at each other as Hecate walks away. ''Is it just me or does she freak me out when she is in a good mood?''Enid asks, everyone, but Indigo nods. ''Well, you two are friends so you don't find it freaky,'' Maud says to Indigo. ''They're just teasing,'' Mildred tells Indigo. ''It is ok,'' Indigo smiles.</p><p>Everyone fell silent as the assembly began.</p><p>'' Well met everybody, at this new term,'' Ada said,'' last year was very interesting but it is starting to become a tradition, isn't it?'' The students smiled. ''Today, you all have the day off to unpack and tomorrow is the start of the new term!''Ada smiled,'' now, go and settle in girls.''</p><p>Everyone starts leaving the great hall in the new year mood. Mildred and her friends went to unpack.</p>
