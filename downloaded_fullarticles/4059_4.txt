    <p>The man was back again.</p><p>Percy never could see him very clearly. He was always surrounded by some kind of shadow or smoke that blurred his features. Percy did manage to pick out the spiked blonde hair, but not much else. What was more unsettling was that no one else seemed to see the man. Only Percy.</p><p>He never stayed long, just a minute or two at most. Enough for Percy to see him, and then he’d vanish. Percy was worried because he could swear he somehow recognized the man, but every time he tried to remember it always came up blank.</p><p>His wife Josephine told him he was probably working too hard again. He couldn’t really be blamed. His job as the Director of Magical Security was very harsh. It called for a lot of his attention and energy, but it was worth it. He kept the streets safe from low life thugs and criminals, and it allowed him to sleep easier at night knowing his children would be safe.</p><p>Alice was only eight now, and Charlie was old enough to start Ilvermorney next term. He’d received his letter and was very excited to go. They had all gone out as a family to help him shop for supplies, laughing and talking about Charlie’s future. The little boy was still too young to really choose anything yet, but he already had high hopes to make it big in the world. Percy made sure to tell him that he could choose any path he liked.</p><p>But then the man was back again.</p><p>He seemed to be coming more often now, plaguing Percy’s dreams and standing right at the corner of Percy’s vision. His own personal phantom to haunt him and bring him down. But Percy would rise above. </p><p>In desperation, he consulted Picquery. The president was sympathetic in his plight, but had never heard of such a thing.</p><p>“Perhaps you’re working too hard,” she said. “I’m going to give you some time off. I want you to spend it resting and getting better.”</p><p>“Sera, I’m fine-”</p><p>“Percival, no. Something’s going on, and I don’t like it. I want you to take this time off and relax. Spend some time with your family. Your son will be leaving soon, won’t he?” Picquery smiled fondly. “Besides, we haven’t had much trouble lately. Disturbances are down and things have been very quiet.”</p><p>Percy couldn’t argue with her, so he thanked her and left. Perhaps they were all right. He just needed to relax and spend some time at home. Alice had been asking to go to the zoo, and he could no longer deny her. They would spend some time together before Charlie left for school, and then everything would be ok again.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Everything did seem ok at first. Percy took his time off of work and the family went out on outings to the stores or parks or beaches. Percy seemed to fall in love with his family all over again, and nothing could ever make him feel as happy as these days.</p><p>Plus, the man stopped showing up.</p><p>The night before Charlie was set to leave, Percy was tucking his children into bed, kissing their brows and reading them stories. Charlie had packed his trunk and Alice was clutching her teddy bear. He turned off the lights and went to join Josephine in bed.</p><p>“Are they finally in bed?” She asked, setting her book aside. “It’s going to be so hard to let Charlie go.”</p><p>“I know, dear,” Percy kissed her. “It will always be hard, but Charlie’s very excited.” </p><p>He leaned in to kiss her again, but paused when something felt odd. He leaned back to see his wife’s face… melting. Turning black and melting. In fact, her whole body was, but she was still sitting there peacefully and not saying a word.</p><p>“Josephine!” He had no idea what could be happening. He called his wand, but it did not come. He used his magic, but nothing happened. Josephine was melting into the bed, and then suddenly the floor cracked! The crack deepened and moved up the walls. Pieces of plaster and wood and brick began to fall around him.</p><p>The children!</p><p>Percy got up and rushed down the hall. Cracks were forming everywhere, and the house seemed to be collapsing. Percy pushed open the door to the children’s room, but the beds were empty.</p><p>“No!” He shouted, ripping the sheets off and moving the beds. “No! Alice! Charlie!” The floor behind him collapsed, and left behind a gaping hole of pitch black. This was all wrong. It had always been wrong, but why? The floor gave way beneath him and he plunged into the darkness.</p><p>“Mr. Graves! Mr. Graves, can you hear me! Please, wake up!”</p><p>Percy heard her. Who was she? He knew her somehow…</p><p>“Mr. Graves!”</p><p>And then Percy woke up.</p><p>It all came rushing back so quickly that he was dizzy at first. Slowly, his mind began to sort through it all as people began to poke and prod at him.</p><p>“Josephine?” He asked in a horse voice. “Alice? Charlie?”</p><p>Faces swam into view. Recognition came afterward. Aurors. His aurors. People were running and shouting orders, pulling him from a bed with glowing sheets and pillows. The magic from them reeked of darkness and corruption. It had all been fake. A dream. He had no family. No wife, no children, nothing was peaceful. He wouldn’t be sending letters to Charlie. He wouldn’t be taking Alice to the zoo again. He wouldn’t kiss Josephine's lips again.</p><p>It had all been a wonderful dream that had given way to his cold reality.</p><p>“No… no! No! WHY?! WHY DID YOU WAKE ME?! Put me back! PUT ME BACK NOW! Josephine! My darling!” Percy began to thrash and curse, trying to get back into the bed, trying to get back to the life he’d had in the dream world.</p><p>“Someone sun him now!”</p><p>And then he was hit and it all went black. He smiled, knowing he’d be back with his family. Back with them in his dreams.</p><p>But his family was not there…</p>
