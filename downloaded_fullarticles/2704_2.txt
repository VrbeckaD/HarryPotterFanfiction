    <p>Warmth.</p><p> </p><p>It was the first thing he could properly register. Overbearing warmth that nipped at his frozen skin, burning the mental ice that chained him.</p><p> </p><p>Rippling from his scar and spreading towards every corner of his body, he knew it was unavoidable to feel the tearing of his soul. But that didn't mean he was giving it up without a fight. </p><p> </p><p>Before he could even do more with his limbs than just flail, before he could even <em>see</em>, Harry reaches for the closest thing with no restraint.</p><p> </p><p>When his dull, no longer radiant emerald eyes finally blinked open, he faces the widened pupils of Albus Dumbledore. The expression was softened, pegged down several notches in hopes of not disturbing the boy.</p><p> </p><p>"You shouldn't have survived."</p><p> </p><p>Curiosity bubbled from the mere infant's vocal cords, unable to suppress the light giggles that proved the utter bliss of ignorance of a child who had no worries tying him down to the world.</p><p> </p><p>Green light filled his blurry vision.</p><p> </p><p>Laughter spilled from his pink, plump lips full of life that his parents never lived to see. Harry fumbles, urging his tiny feet forward but finding no anchor to attach himself to on the dirtied floor caked with mud and dried blood.</p><p> </p><p>It was a natural instinct to peer through his lashes, gazing up at the elder wizard who held- and gripped harshly- onto an old wand. Dumbledore's mask was crumbling. Fortunately for the Headmaster, only a one-year-old witnessed the slow erosion, perhaps he wouldn't even remember this at all. <em>An extra memory charm to aid the process, maybe?</em></p><p> </p><p>Whilst swarming in his own thoughts, knuckles were whitened against his conscious will. Avada Kedarva had not gotten rid of the boy, what will?</p><p> </p><p>A moment of silence passed by.</p><p> </p><p>Then he gazes at the corpse of Lily Potter.</p><p> </p><p><em>Yes</em>, Dumbledore promises himself, heaving the youngest, and only Potter alive into his arms- Harry struggles, but not with enough force to break- and initiates his new plan. <em>I'll have time to fix this.</em></p><p> </p><p>In his mind, nothing could take the side of the boy thrashing in his hold, for another approach had already occupied his thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>It was all for the greater good.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fat, pudgy amateur hands crushed his throat. He doesn't bother with recoiling, because he knows all too well that he'll be caught again. When had his uncle truly worked his arse off half harder than Harry did? </p><p> </p><p>A second into envying Vernon Dursley's uncalloused hands made him sick. So he looked away.</p><p> </p><p>He should've known better, he comments in his head, unaffected by the sharp slap that stung his skin and sent pricks of pain to his cheek. After all, Harry muses with a downcast gaze, he was to be seen.</p><p> </p><p>"No... running." Dry, unwatered cords set off various alarms in his brain, his words coming loose and no sense of connection when he uttered the same words as his supposed blood relative, only vile disgust. ".. Obey." </p><p> </p><p>The rags that barely counted as his clothing hung off his fatless, nearly all bones body in shame. Chanting the short and precise words over and over, bearing the pain.</p><p> </p><p>It was a routine he had long grown used to.</p><p> </p><p>The sound of a zipper being yanked down pulled his conscious awake. An unwilling flinch had Harry's back coming into contact with a wall, and he realized how truly miserable he was.</p><p> </p><p>"Stay where you are, <em>freak</em>."</p><p> </p><p>The last shine in his green eyes dulled.</p><p> </p><p>If the residing neighbors of Privet Drive heard broken screams that evening, they knew better than to question.</p><p> </p><p>Because ignorance was bliss.  </p><p> </p>
