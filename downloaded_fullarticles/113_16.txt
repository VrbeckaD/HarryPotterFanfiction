    <p>Ever since I was four years old and that bastard infected me with lycanthropy, my life wasn’t easy. Being scratched across my face, it was impossible to pretend I wasn’t a werewolf. I won’t lie. I felt sorry for myself. Mothers wouldn’t let their kids play with me; vendors wouldn’t sell me sweets. Everybody was worried I could infect them. So, I learnt to be by myself. To be happy alone.</p>
<p>I didn’t even expect to get my Hogwarts letter. I was pretty sure the headmaster wouldn’t let a wolf child to run around castle with “normal” kids. Imagine my surprise, when I got the letter and, later, got sorted into Gryffindor. I was trying to be the best. When I had to skip classes due to my condition, I put an extra effort on the following ones.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise, however, was when a few kids started hanging around with me. I was happy. Genuinely happy. For the first time in my short life, I actually had friends. I didn’t want more.</p>
<p>When we turned sixteen, in our sixth year, James started dating Lily. She was playing hard to get at first, but she came around. They were so sweet together.</p>
<p>“I wish someone would look at me the way Prongs looks at Lily,” I sighed ready to take on Sirius’s wisecracks. Their lack of surprised me.</p>
<p>“Maybe there is someone…” started Sirius, but never finished his sentence. Severus was coming our way and Padfoot, that jerk, never missed an opportunity to tease him. Only later have I realised, how much that teasing affected Snape.</p>
<p>I was actually really sure who the someone should be. Sirius. I used to steal glances at him over my book, giving him a half-smile when he noticed I was staring. However, I would have to be really stupid or oblivious not to notice the looks our female classmates were giving him. Also, the scars on my face were a constant reminder that no one in their right mind would want to spend their life with me.</p>
<p>Then, on one December evening, still during our sixth year, it was just Sirius and me in the library. I was studying, as per usual, and he was watching me.</p>
<p>“I know what I want as a Christmas present from you,” he started, unusually serious.</p>
<p>“Who says I was planning on giving you anything,” I answered without looking at him.</p>
<p>“Go out with me. This Saturday.”</p>
<p>“We are always hanging out together. I’ve thought you would want something special.”</p>
<p>“Pay attention, Moony. I’ll tell you once more and very slowly. I – want – you – to – go – out – with – me. As a date.” He was smiling his biggest, brightest smile and I am pretty sure my brain just stopped in that moment. For months, I was forbidding myself to even hope for something like that would ever happen. However, as I said my brain totally froze, so the only thing I was able to utter was: “Okay.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was pleased. He stood up and went to the dormitory with the same smile on his face.</p>
