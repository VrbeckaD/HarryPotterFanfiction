    <p>5:04 a.m. Wednesday (present day)<br/>Third day of school</p><p>She woke with a start. <br/>She opened her curtains and walked to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. <br/>This did not look like Hermione Granger was gonna have a good hair day today. Or a good day in general. <br/>Her bags under her eyes made her look miserable and skeleton-like. Her body was drenched in sweat that looked as though she had just run a 9 mile marathon. And she discovered a new pimple. Splat on her nose!She quickly washed her face and turned the shower faucet to hot and pulled the lever. <br/>She needed a shower. And fast. </p><p>-</p><p>She had a horrible dream of herself walking in the crowded plaza in Hogsmeade with Ron, holding hands. They were both smiling, happy and needless to say, a couple. <br/>But that's not the bad part. <br/>          "Wanna go to the Three Broomsticks?" Ron asked, stopping dead in his tracks to face Hermione, who also turned to face him. <br/>          "Sure," she answered smiling, ״where else would we go?" <br/>           "Just being sure," he smiled back and leaned in for a kiss. Hermione felt electricity as she felt Ron's lips on hers and for a moment she sensed as though nothing could go wrong. She placed her hands on his chest and his were roaming her back and hair. He then placed his hands on her shoulders and that was when Ron pulled away, slightly pushing her backwards as well. He was looking at her in a serious way. <br/>           "What's wrong?' Hermione asked with a grin, "I don't kiss that bad do I?"<br/>           "Change of plans, I can't make it," he said letting go of her and attempting to walk away. <br/>            "What? Why?," Hermione said running in front of him to block his path. <br/>            "Because you're a useless liar and a nasty cheater," he told her. <br/>She looked at him with hurt in her eyes. She was suddenly surrounded by the aroma of all the students in Gryffindor. They were in a tight circle around Ron and Hermione, pointing at her while whispering to each other. She didn't understand why Ron would call her such things or how everyone around her seemed to know something that she didn't. <br/>          "You're pathetic," she heard a second year say. <br/>           "So disgusting," yelled another. <br/>           "Go to hell and don't come back." Said a fourth year. <br/>           "She's worse that You-Know-Who," cried a deep voice. <br/>It was hard to keep track of who was saying what because everybody seemed to be towering against her. She looked back at Ron, who was now Harry and he looked at though he was ready to fight muggle-style because his arms were flexed in front of his face. <br/>            "You deserve this." <br/>And everything went black. </p><p>-</p><p>Hermione didn't feel the need to rush her shower time. It was only about 5:30 and breakfast wouldn't show up until 7 and classes only started in 3 hours (8:30, for those who didn't know). She also didn't want to go back to sleep. <br/>When she finally came out, it was 6:08 and the mirror was well covered in the vaporization of her worries. <br/>She felt new and refreshed, wrapping herself in a fluffy towel while stepping on the mat. <br/>'The dream meant nothing.' Hermione thought to herself, 'Ron and Harry  would never do that and will always remain to be friends with me... Or would they? <br/>'Stop thinking about it' she told herself to the misty mirror 'you know they would never, no matter what happened yesterday...'</p><p>Yesterday was the guiltiest she has ever felt in her life. She knew it wasn't supposed to feel this way but she couldn't stop herself of what happened. It wasn't entirely her fault either. But it was something that made both Ron and Harry not look at her for the rest of the day yesterday. <br/>She was hoping it would be different today. Considering today was only the third day of school in her fifth year in Hogwarts (aka the hardest year of Hogwarts) and she didn't want to lose her best friends. Especially for something this stupid of a situation.  </p><p>-</p><p>hey guys!</p><p>this chapter was pretty short but they get longer, don't worry.</p><p>i'm new to writing, but i guarantee that this story will blow your mind.</p><p>Keep reading. </p><p>-purp1enurp1e</p>
