    <p>It began, for the Ministry, with Sheila Tully. </p><p>It was a bright, dewy morning that dawned across Diagon Alley, spring finally beating back winter's chill. No shops were open yet, but shop owners and clerks alike still darted through jangling doors with steaming cups of coffee and tea, readying their stores for the day's commerce. It was Thaddeus Dendron, the opening attendant at Madam Malkin's who noticed the shambling figure coming up the street, his hand still on the door's handle as he held it partially open. </p><p>"Are you alright?" Thaddeus called out, squinting to make out the figure's shape. A witch, her robes bedraggled, each foot dragging forward with the gait of someone on the brink of total exhaustion. She didn't even look at him, much less give any other indication she had heard him. He recognized her, in fact, as a customer he had helped fit with new seasonal robes just two weeks ago; the robes that hung askew from her sagging shoulders now were the ones he had sold her himself, and their off-kilter sleeves nearly hid the wand she clutched in pale-knuckled fingers. </p><p>Nearly. </p><p>Thaddeus was quick to spot the wand, quick to put together all the pieces of the strange and threatening scene and shut himself into the shop, but the clerk at Flourish &amp; Blott's just next door hadn't had the time to be so quick. Thaddeus knew her to be a recent Hogwarts graduate, a rising star known to have excelled at all her studies who worked at Flourish &amp; Blott's while she wisely thought over her career choices—by all accounts, a powerful witch. </p><p>It was, unfortunately, exactly what Sheila Tully was looking for. The young clerk had barely emerged from the shop when Sheila's drawn face rose, twisted with frantic pain, and she thrust her wand out to shout, "<i>Venari Virtute!</i>" </p><p>The spell that shot across the cobblestoned street was a sickly yellow, crackling as it flew, and when it hit the clerk she collapsed as though she were a marionette with cut strings, a pile of limbs going in all the wrong directions. Working witches and wizards all along Diagon's thoroughfare rushed from their storefronts to the clerk's aid, and none of them could know what a mistake this was. In a post-Voldemort world, there was no more sitting back in the face of violence and evil, so really, there was no other choice left to any of them. </p><p>Sheila cast the curse three more times before Aurors Apparated onto the scene and Stunned her into submission. In total, four victims, all of them alive but unresponsive. The Healers at St. Mungo's were at a loss, and it seemed they would have to play a waiting game for their patients to wake up. </p><p>It took twenty four hours, and all four patients woke on their own, heaving themselves from their hospital beds and out of their rooms. They wrenched wands from their waiting loved ones, and all through the corridors of St. Mungo's, the words <i>Venari Virtute!</i> echoed over and over again as Sheila's victims struck down witch after wizard with the very same curse that had flattened them the previous day. </p><p>Sheila, for her part, died soon afterward in Auror holding, twitching and screaming till her last breath. When her corpse was examined, she was so dehydrated that her skin tented in stiff peaks when the examiner pulled at it. There was nothing in her stomach, or anywhere in her digestive tract at all, in fact, except a handful of ulcers. </p><p>It became known as the Rabid Dog Curse, despite the incantation translating to something else entirely: <i>Power hunt. Venari Virtute.</i> Minister Shacklebolt made it a Ministry-wide case, with the specific task of finding the origin of the curse—be it cursed object or dark mage—falling to the Aurors, headed by one Harry Potter. Find the origin, find a cure, the logic went. </p><p>And to help Head Auror Potter and his team, one Draco Malfoy, contracted until the case's end by the Ministry for his scholarly expertise in the Dark Arts. </p>

  <p>☾</p>
</center><p>It's been fifteen years since the end of the war, and fifteen years since the Wizengamot took Draco's wand in exchange for his freedom, but he still feels unsettled as he steps into the lift at the Ministry of Magic. In any other context, he'd feel ridiculous for taking the lift a single storey, especially heading <i>down</i>, but he doesn't want to ask where the stairs are. He doesn't even know if there <i>are</i> stairs, and he certainly doesn't want to speak to anyone. </p><p>Fifteen years, and still he receives sidelong looks, frowning glances, surreptitious lips muttering <i>Isn't that...?</i> as he passes. He breathes through his nose as he wedges himself into the corner of the lift car, focusing on small actions like pressing the button for Level Two, and on the weight of his bag full of research digging into his shoulder. </p><p>His therapist says he doesn't deserve it; she even says he didn't deserve the outright jeers and attempted assaults when he was just barely of age. He's supposed to at least try to take her words to heart. </p><p>"Level Two," the lift's smooth voice sings out, and Draco is already slipping through the doors as it lists the associated offices of Magical Law Enforcement. His quick pace is meant to look as though he's walking with purpose, rather than hurried along by his own anxiety; he thinks it might be working. If he's walking too fast to see if anyone's looking at him, that's just a bonus. </p><p>A young man with twisting hands and a buzzing energy greets him at the door that leads to the Auror offices. "You must be Mr. Malfoy?" he says, as if he's unsure.  </p><p>Draco quashes his natural urge to be snide, because who else could he be? The papers have certainly always zeroed in on his high Black forehead, highlighted as it's become over the years by his receding hairline. "Yes," he grits out at last, smoothing the word down just as it emerges. </p><p>"Right this way," the young man says, pushing floppy brown hair out of his eyes. Draco supposes, as he follows his quick-footed escort, that there'd be no requirement of professionalism in Potter's Auror office. Draco is led to a heavy-looking door, and he notices as the young man—alright, certainly a secretary—knocks three times upon its surface that Potter's name is nowhere to be found on it. A tarnished plaque simply reads HEAD AUROR and no more. </p><p>Draco imagines the office inside, within the few seconds of waiting for permission to enter. A mess, likely, and Potter will match it, if his secretary's untamed hair and hastily-tied robes are anything to go by. Potter's appearance has ceased to be public knowledge since his ascension, but Draco remembers Potter's perpetually untidy hair and clothes well enough from school. </p><p>"Enter," comes a voice from behind the heavy door. The secretary pushes at the door with a tense hand, and backs away. Draco rolls his eyes as he saunters inside. </p><p>He stops just as he closes the door behind him, eyes darting around the room before settling on Harry Potter. "Please," Potter says, gesturing with one hand before clasping it with the other again. "Sit." </p><p>The room is frighteningly bare. The only files seem to be the thick folder just at Potter's right elbow on the desk, and the walls and desktop are bereft of photos, knick knacks, or any other personal ephemera that would indicate a person inhabited this space. The space the massive desk puts between Potter and his guest is all the more yawning for it; Draco imagines the desk is big for a reason, given the workload a Head Auror must have, and yet Potter has put none of it to use. </p><p>More off-putting is Potter himself. His hair has been buzzed clean off, despite rumors that his hair was uncuttable, which puts the jagged scar on his forehead on stark display. In sharp contrast to his rumpled peon outside, his robes are stern and pressed, his shirt beneath buttoned to his throat, and he sits straight and symmetrical, hands folded together. The tip of his left pinky is missing, and thick ropes of scar tissue stretch across the top knuckles of his other hand, making sharp contrast with his dark brown skin. His face behind his square glasses is impassive. </p><p>Draco sits, refusing to be intimidated by this strange, Spartan display. "Potter," he says, forgetting to choose between smirking familiarity and cold professionalism and getting an awkwardly muddled tone between. </p><p>"Mr. Malfoy," Potter says, with a curt nod of acknowledgement. <i>Mr.</i> Malfoy? "Let's get right to business." He slides the folder forward with his right hand, tucking the fingers of his left into a loose fist on the desk and hiding his pinky. There's something about his voice that makes Draco feel like he's walked into a trap, like perhaps there's a flask of Polyjuice in the room he has yet to detect. "How much do you know about this case?" </p><p>Well, Draco can be professional, too. He's getting paid for this, after all. "At first," he says, tugging his thick sheaf of research from his bag as neatly as he can, "only what made the papers. A viral curse, turning each witch or wizard it affects into a rabid host looking to cast the curse next. But it's clear to me that this curse has a root." He lays his parchment next to the folder. "That much must be clear to Minister Shacklebolt as well, as he's asked me to find that root." </p><p>"He's asked the Aurors to find that root, and you are to help us to that end." Potter says it so matter-of-factly that Draco finds it hard to discern whether he's been corrected or if Potter simply hadn't listened to his last words, speaking over him instead. </p><p>Draco draws his bottom lip between his teeth, then hears his mother's voice telling him it's uncouth and releases it. "Right. Of course." </p><p>"I would like you to take this folder," Potter says, giving the folder another nudge toward Draco, "while I look over your research, if I may." <i>If I may.</i> Words he’d never thought Potter would say, especially not to him, nor sincerely. "Auror Larch will show you to your desk." </p><p>"You don't want to go over it together?" Draco says with a frown. "My research is—" </p><p>"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy." Potter cuts him off as simply as if Draco were a student and he a professor. </p><p>Auror Larch—the young man Draco had thought to be a secretary—arrives in the doorway as if Summoned, and Draco scoops up the Ministry folder with a barely-concealed huff. He knows better than to press the issue; it may be a full fifty years after the way before he feels comfortable throwing his negligible weight around. He still can't stand it. </p><p>His desk is out in the open with the rest of them, although at least it's close to the door. Wooden cubicle walls give lip service to privacy, but not much more. Draco also notes that the cubicle walls block some of the nearest light, casting the very desk where he'll be expected to read and write extensively into shadow. He'll have to bring in a lamp. </p><p>Draco spends the rest of the day poring over the file Potter's given him. Loaned him. Whatever. He doesn't have that lamp in yet, nor can he cast his own spells, but Auror Larch is only too happy to cast a <i>Lumos</i> and leave it suspended over Draco's desk. He doesn't know why Larch seems so excited to see him, but he does wish Larch had conjured him a little lampshade, too, because every time he so much as glances up, the low-hanging ball of light leaves its burning impression on his retinas. </p><p>The body count is so much higher than Draco had known. The only survivors so far are the victims most recently cursed, and by the look of things, their days are certainly numbered. </p><p>He taps a thoughtful finger toward the bottom of the list of victims. Auror Blair Pertinger, the only MLE employee to have been struck—and she's still alive. She's been placed in "protective custody" at St. Mungo's, which is a confounding combination of words if ever he's seen one. </p><p>"Auror Larch," Draco calls without looking up, and Larch is at his elbow within seconds, startling him. "Are you some kind of assistant?" he asks, instead of the request he was about to make. </p><p>"Oh, well," Larch says with a nervous giggle. "Newest to the department. You know how it is." </p><p>"I certainly don't know," Draco says, with a dry voice and arched brows. "Are you or aren't you?" </p><p>"We all have to earn our way up," Larch says, which is no more of an answer than his last. </p><p>"Is that what Potter says?" Draco sits back, studying Larch and his increasingly frantic hands. </p><p>"No! No. It's just—it's how things have always been. I'm happy to be helpful." Larch's hands twist so much the knuckles pop like frying oil. "Was there something you wanted, Mr. Malfoy?" </p><p>"Yes, actually." Draco reaches toward his face before reminding himself his glasses are at home, where they belong, though he supposes they'll have to live behind these thin partitions now, before he strains his eyes into oblivion. "I need the personnel file for Auror Pertinger." </p><p>"Pers—" Larch's brows knit into a frown. "Why? She's on leave." </p><p>Draco stops cold. "On leave?" he repeats, slowly. </p><p>"Oh yes. Her mother is desperately sick, I've heard." </p><p>"Have you." Draco turns his gaze back to the list, checking to be sure he didn't mean some other auror. "Be that as it may, I'd like to see her file." </p><p>"I can't, sir. It's not pertinent to the case." </p><p>"I say it's pertinent to the case," Draco says, sitting up straighter. "If you're happy to be helpful, fetch it for me." </p><p>"You're not MLE, sir. I can't." </p><p>"<i>You</i> are the one who asked <i>me</i> if you could help, and I gave you an answer as to how you could. Fetch me the personnel file of Auror Pertinger or so help me, I will go looking for it myself, and—" Draco can already hear the end of the sentence echoing through his head. Something haughty, and threatening; the words of a man speaking to a servant. He closes his throat off, then sighs, sinking back into his chair before he even realizes he'd begun to stand. "Please, Auror Larch. It's very important." </p><p>Larch rolls his lips between his teeth, glancing around. Draco's aborted tantrum seems to have earned them some sharp looks, and Larch doesn't look so helpful anymore. </p><p>"Please," Draco says again. He hates how desperate he sounds. "For the case." </p><p>"Just for the case," Larch agrees at last, after making a too-long study of Draco's face. "Alright." And he sweeps off. </p><p>How pathetic for a Malfoy to have to beg a boy barely out of school robes for anything, much less material for a paid job. That's what Lucius would say. Draco busies himself with further case notes, drowning out his father's voice with details of victims' distressed aversion to food and drink. Whoever manufactured this curse must have modeled it closely after rabies—not that that's any revelation, given the spell's public nickname. Draco thinks it should join the short list of Unforgivable Curses—even Avada Kedavra is fast, and the Cruciatus rarely takes lives. Venari Virtute has a fatality of 100% thus far, each victim dying in slow agony and borderline dementia. </p><p>Despite Draco's fears, Larch makes his return with the personnel file in hand. He thanks Larch softly, and watches the young man dip his head into Potter's office before walking out of sight, likely to his own desk. Draco assumes he's keeping Potter abreast of <i>Mr. Malfoy's</i> odd requests. </p><p>Strange, Draco muses as he opens Pertinger's folder atop the case files, that any Auror, even one so wet behind the ears, should be ignorant of a coworker's injury status. According to the case files, Pertinger was hit with the curse on duty, trying to take down the latest lunatic victim before they spread the curse any further. Even Potter must surely know that compartmentalization can be taken too far, hindering his little Ministry-approved army of brutes—and he'd never taken Potter for the secretive type, anyway. </p><p>Pertinger's personnel file paints a woman at the top of her game. Clever and shrewd, with a high solve rate; she's noted for casting particularly forceful hexes, with someone writing that her <i>Stupefy</i> feels less like a punch and more like cannonfire. She's broken perpetrators' ribs multiple times. He pages back to find that she was a bullheaded student at Hogwarts—a Gryffindor, naturally, with little patience or respect for authority, but with a strong aptitude for DADA spells in particular. A truly powerful witch. </p><p>Draco doesn't realize how long he's been reading until he stands, at last, and his hips creak in protest, his legs tingling. The Malfoy line is not known for strong joints. He strides to Potter's door, knocking thrice as Larch had. When no invitation to enter results, he knocks again. "Potter," Draco calls out, only a little bit demanding. </p><p>"Oh, Head Auror Potter's gone home," Larch says from the dark corner, fingers tangling with anxiety as he steps forward. Draco wonders if his hands ever get stuck together. "Most of the office have. It's just us." </p><p>"Gone home?" Draco repeats, upper lip curling as he looks first at Larch then at Potter's door. "Without so much as a by your leave?" </p><p>"Well," Larch says, "seeing as he's Head—" </p><p>"Yes, I know very well he's Head Thingy," Draco snaps, huffing. "It's an expression, Larch, <i>please</i> do tell me you've heard of expressions." </p><p>"I have," Larch sniffs, his already ruddy face coloring. His hands duck behind his back now. "Are you done for the night?" </p><p>Draco sighs, giving Potter's door one last disgusted look. "I suppose I am, yes. And they left you behind to make sure I don't waltz out of the Ministry with an armful of stolen files and goods?" </p><p>"To lock the door behind you, Mr. Malfoy." Larch skips expertly over Draco's long-winded words, for someone who had just tried to explain that Potter needed no one's leave. "Shall we?" </p><p>"The files—" </p><p>"Will remain here," Larch says, "as they're MLE property." </p><p>"Aurors don't take home their work, do they?" </p><p>"You're not an Auror, sir." </p><p>Draco mouths Larch's words with a cartoonish sneer and pop of his eyebrows as he collects his bag. Potter had never given him back his research, so he can't even cross reference from memory, and his bag looks deflated and sad without parchment stuffing it to its black leather gills. Larch walks so close at his heels he threatens to step on them as he escorts Draco to the door, and Draco is left to twiddle his thumbs while Larch fails twice to produce the correct key to lock up. When Larch follows him to the lifts he wants to say something cutting about being able to find his own way out, but it's not like Larch doesn't need to go home, too. </p><p>The Manor wards ripple gently as Draco Apparates into the front hall. He steps out of his shoes and arranges them by the door, hangs his empty bag on a wrought iron coat rack next to them. Fourteen years ago, he would still swish his wandless hand as he entered his home—muscle memory. Now in his early thirties, Draco is used to his Squib existence. </p><p>There are no more house elves in Malfoy Manor, either. Draco cooks his own meals, chopping vegetables and sautéing meat like a Muggle—by hand. He's purchased a few modified appliances to make the job easier—a food processor and a stand mixer, charmed to be able to work in magical homes—but they're poor replacements for cooking spells, which are still a distant second to elf-made food. Oh, and he's had to buy a refrigerator. </p><p>Draco settles into the sitting room with his dinner of pork cutlet and roasted asparagus on a tea tray balanced on his lap, holding a letter from his mother in one hand. He received the letter this morning, but in his rush to the Ministry he'd just set it aside for later. </p><p>It is, as he suspected, mostly drivel ending with yet another invitation to join her on the continent. Narcissa Malfoy swans from the house in Italy to the house in France and back as the weather and her mood dictate. She is not wandless, though her every spell is tracked by the Ministry through a charm created during the war trials. Draco wonders, sometimes, what made her seem so much more harmless than he—a child, at the time, pale with fright. Then he remembers what Potter said at her trial, about how he could not have survived without her courageous lie to the Dark Lord or something equally as puffed up. </p><p>But he won't be leaving the Manor. He finishes his dinner, does his own washing up, and pens a trite response to his mother that acknowledges her mundane European adventures and utterly ignores her plea for his company. He mentions, with just a few words, that he's been contracted by the Ministry; she'll like that. Then he ties the letter to the leg of Archimedes, his very moody horned owl, and spends the rest of his evening reading a Muggle novel before heading to bed at a reasonable hour, in one of the only bedrooms left unlocked. </p><p>Most of the Manor is sealed off now. Before Narcissa left for Europe the first time, she'd cast locking charms on so many of the rooms tainted by the occupation rather than look at them ever again. Without his wand, Draco is powerless to reopen them, but he doesn't have any desire to ever look at the drawing room where he was asked to identify Harry Potter for Voldemort's killing pleasure. </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>☾</p>
</center><p>The following morning as Larch welcomes him into the office with a too-cheery “Good morning!” Draco notes, with mild annoyance, that Auror Pertinger's file has been taken from his desk. The case files have been replaced with his research, as if he's not allowed to possess both at the same time. Without even taking his bag off, he strides to Potter's door, and knocks in rapid fire. </p><p>"Enter," Potter's voice comes, right as Draco pauses in his knocking to give his knuckles a short break. </p><p>"Firstly," Draco says as he swings the door open, "I want the case files back. I can hardly cross reference my research thus far without them." </p><p>Potter frowns, but doesn't move from his desk. "Alright." At least today there's some semblance of work on Harry's desk, spread out in the unorganized way he expected to see. </p><p>"Secondly," Draco says, hurrying to his next point—he had so many arguments ready for why he needed the case files back, and Potter's taken some of the wind out of his sails by simply acquiescing. "I want to see Auror Pertinger." </p><p>"No." Potter's refusal is instantaneous and cold, made all the worse when the word simply hangs between them. No explanation, no apology—just no. </p><p>"I know she's not on leave," Draco says, gripping the back of the single chair in front of Potter's desk to lean his weight on it. </p><p>"I know you know that. You read the full case files, which I put in your hands myself." </p><p>Draco doesn't like this Potter one bit. He's always had a tempestuous relationship with Potter, but at least the Potter he grew up with—fiery, impetuous, disrespectful, certainly a streak of martyrdom—was a known quantity. The Potter he's faced with now is an immovable object, and if manipulation works on him, it's outside of Draco's usual bag of tricks. </p><p>"Then you'll understand, <i>won't you</i>, that if I want to see Auror Pertinger, then there must be a case-related <i>reason</i> for it?" Draco says, fingers digging into the upholstered back of the chair. </p><p>"You will not see Auror Pertinger." </p><p>"Then you must not want to solve this case." </p><p>Potter looks up at that, and for a second, there's a flicker of his old self in his eyes. Draco waits for Potter to shout, to call Draco out for questioning his dedication to justice, maybe to even take him off the case. None of it pleasant, no, but he'd honestly feel more at ease. </p><p>"What do you want from her?" </p><p>"I need to observe her," Draco says, finally taking a seat now that he senses he might be getting somewhere. "I already understand I can't question her." </p><p>"You wouldn't question her regardless—you're not an Auror," Potter says. </p><p>"So I've heard!" Draco says, then blinks slowly as he dulls the sharpness in his voice. "Hobbling me for not being an official part of your department will not solve the case. I just want to see her." </p><p>When Potter sits back, it's a slight motion, given that his back is already ramrod straight, but Draco takes instant heed, and schools his face to reflect minimal, professional interest. "You cannot share anything you see today with anyone else."</p><p>"Of course," Draco says, buzzing with even this small victory. "Total secrecy." </p><p>Potter gets to his feet. "And we'll be going now." </p><p>"Absolutely." Draco stands as well. He won't be caught giving Potter any reason to deny him. </p><p>Following behind Potter, he's astonished to realize the man's grown several inches since they were both 17, which doesn't seem right. Potter towers over everyone in the office as he sweeps through with his hands clasped behind his back, and he only lets Auror Larch know he's leaving. He says nothing to Draco in the lift, but gives tiny polite nods to the Ministry employees entering the lift as he and Draco depart into the lobby. </p><p>Draco reminds himself to focus on the case, and not how unnerving he finds Potter. The case is what will earn him his Galleons, as well as a bit of polish back to the Malfoy name. </p><p>From the lobby, at least, the trip isn't so long. They Floo one after the other to St. Mungo's; by the time Draco has stepped through, the Boy Who Lived Again has already put his celebrity status to work and skipped the bureaucratic nature of St. Mungo's waiting room, led past the desk by an orderly. Draco scurries after them as the orderly takes her first of many turns. </p><p>He's never been in this part of St. Mungo's before. </p><p>"In here," the orderly says, standing five feet from the door at which she's gesturing. "Do you want me to wait for you?" </p><p>"No," Potter murmurs, frowning at the door. He puts his hand on the doorknob. </p><p>"Wait," Draco says, although he's not sure why, which means if Potter asks him why he should wait he's unlikely to have a satisfactory answer. </p><p>Instead, Potter's hand pulls away from the knob, rejoining its compatriot behind his back as he looks at Draco with mild curiosity. </p><p>"Let me observe her on my own." </p><p>"Why?" </p><p>It's as fair a question as any, and Draco has no solid answer. There's just something that's been trying to jump out at him from all the data he's seen so far, but he can't put words to it yet. "I have a feeling," he says, nearly wincing as he says it. A child's reason. </p><p>But Potter nods. "I'll give you a few minutes." </p><p>Draco can't bring himself to say thank you, but he can at least keep himself from saying anything awful, and instead moves to the door in silence. He pushes through, hoping Pertinger isn't asleep. </p><p>And as soon as he's inside, he wishes Pertinger <i>was</i> asleep. For himself, because Pertinger's manic eyes are on him with his first step inside, but for Pertinger as well, with her ragged breathing, limbs twitching and shuddering under tight restraints. A coma would probably be a treat for her. </p><p>At first, Draco says nothing, walking a wide circle around the edge of the hospital room. Despite the room's size and other empty beds, there are no other patients housed here. A translucent pouch of clear liquid hangs nearby, and Draco thinks he remembers that it's spelled to release hydration and nutrients within the paired patient's body at intervals. When Pertinger continues to simply watch him, he edges closer. </p><p>Despite the medical hydration charm, her lips are cracked and dry, and she shows him why when she swipes a sticky tongue across them. She's been muttering something this whole time, he realizes, and he leans closer. </p><p>It's the incantation. <i>Venari Virtute.</i> Over and over, under her wheezing breath. Her spasming hand holds an invisible wand, flicking violently every time she finishes the second word. </p><p>"Auror Blair Pertinger," Draco says, trying to sound conversational as he stands just out of arm's reach from her bed. Her arms are snug under the restraints, but there's no sense in trusting bits of leather. "Do you know who I am?" </p><p>She gives no indication that she's heard him, much less understood the question. It's not a self-important one; he knows his face is recognizable, for better or worse, and usually the latter these days. She seems to have lost interest in him entirely, in fact, and her eyes are casting around the room as she continues to mutter. </p><p>"You know, people usually can't stop looking at me," Draco snorts, speaking to her freely the way one might to a cat. "I like that you don't care, Pertinger. It's refreshing." </p><p>The knob turns. Pertinger's head snaps forward, her eyes locked on the door, and as Potter enters, she begins to scream. </p><p>"<i>VENARI VIRTUTE! VENARI VIRTUTE!"</i> Pertinger bellows, her feet scrabbling at the bottom of her bed as she arches her whole body away from the mattress. Her arms strain against the leather straps, and her wand hand has made a tense fist as it twists with each incantation. "<i>VENARI VIRTUTE!"</i> Her eyes are lidless, fixed only on Potter, and whatever Potter thought he might say has been buried under her screams. </p><p>"What have you done?" Potter demands in the space between incantations, glaring at Draco. </p><p>"She's reacting to you, you prat!" Draco retorts in the next space, backing toward the wall with a firm eye on Pertinger. </p><p>There's a loud crack as one of the straps breaks open, and Pertinger's wand hand rises like the grasping hand of an Inferi, before pointing its phantom wand at Potter. "<i>VENARI VIRTUTE!"</i> she howls, and her lips start to bleed from how wide she stretches her mouth around the sound. </p><p>"<i>Stupefy!"</i> Potter calls right back, tearing his wand from his sleeve to blast Pertinger with a Stunning Spell. It lands at her throat, and she falls back to the bed, gasping and shaking, but her eyes are still open. For once since Draco began this case, there's emotion painted across Potter's face, his expression sick with anger and despair. He Stuns her again, and she goes limp, her wand arm hanging over the edge of the thin mattress. </p><p>"This," Potter says, "was a bad idea." He whirls on his heel and exits the room in three long strides. </p><p>Draco doesn't follow him out. Instead he watches Pertinger, his brain a spinning mass of cogs clicking together. She'd had no interest in Draco, but had wanted to curse Potter so badly she'd summoned superhuman strength just to take her shot. He finally trots out of the room, in time to have the entering orderly shoot him a nasty look. </p><p>"I need—" he begins, but Potter holds up a silencing finger. </p><p>"No more field trips," Potter says. "The Ministry hired you on as a scholar—a source of information and research at the Auror department's convenience." </p><p>"Okay, well—" Whatever that's got to do with the price of peas in Persepolis, Draco doesn't know, but he needs to act on his new theory before the idea fades. </p><p>"You will not leave your desk during work hours, from now on, except for reasonable breaks, and you will not leave the Auror offices during those breaks." </p><p>Draco nearly reaches down to pick up his jaw that must surely be on the floor. "I'm sorry?" </p><p>"I don't know why I thought I should listen to you, or treat you like part of the team," Potter says with a glower. </p><p>"I was not hired on," Draco growls, "to be an encyclopedia! I was hired to do my own research and yes, turn that research over to you and your precious Aurors, but this visit was part of that research!" </p><p>"I say what you were hired to do!" Potter snaps. A cold thrill goes up Draco's spine at Potter's anger, and as much as he doesn't want to jeopardize this job, there's a rush in breaking through Potter's new icy exterior. He <i>knew</i> Potter couldn't have changed that much. </p><p>"What matters more, Potter?" Draco wants to know, taking one bold step toward Potter. Just one, because he's still cautious. "Making sure I feel excluded, putting me in my place? Or solving this case before even more people die?" </p><p>Potter's nostrils flare, wand clutched in a fist at his hip. "I will not be led by you." </p><p>"How prideful," Draco sneers. "Will it be your pride that brings Pertinger back from <i>that?</i>" He points at the door of Pertinger's room. </p><p>"Be quiet, Malfoy," Potter hisses. </p><p>"I know what pride gets you," Draco goes on, heedless of the warning tone in Potter's low voice. "And that's <i>nothing.</i>" </p><p>"I know where trusting a Malfoy gets you, too," Potter says, narrowing his eyes. And he doesn't even have to elaborate; both men know the answer. </p><p>He could never ask Potter to trust him, not in so many words. He knows he has carved himself into an untrustworthy person with his earliest choices, no matter how much he's chipped away as an adult. </p><p>"I promise you this much," Draco says at last, breaking the ugly silence between them. "I only want to help. Please let me do that." </p><p>"You want to do whatever you please, is what you want," Potter says without looking at him. </p><p>"In this moment, I am just a scholar with a theory. Please, Potter." <i>Please, Potter.</i> The words burn his lips and tongue as they roll across. </p><p>"This is how you tricked me in my office." </p><p>"I don't see how I tricked you. What do you think I did in that room?" Draco asks, sincerely curious. "Or don't you remember I have no wand?" </p><p>Potter's lips press together in a wide, flat slit. "I don't know." </p><p>"Be reasonable. I'm powerless." He holds up his empty hands. </p><p>"You sound just like your father," Potter says, softly. </p><p>Draco jerks back as if he's been slapped, so suddenly he nearly loses his balance. He wants to say he's going back to the Ministry. Or home. He needs to be away from Potter and his vile words, laced with hideous truth, because he'll never escape his father's influence, all the way down to blood and bone. He wants Potter to feel like—</p><p>"I need," Draco says again, from between grinding teeth, "to test my theory. Please. I just need a little more time with Pertinger, and then yes, you can chain me to my desk for eternity." </p><p>"No," Potter says, almost whispering. </p><p>"There was a reason she reacted so exceptionally to you but ignored me, I know it," Draco insists. "Give me this." </p><p>"No." </p><p>"I only want to bring a handful of different witches and wizards in front of Pertinger. You can vet them; you can <i>choose</i> them. I just want to see her reactions, and then back to the Ministry's darkest cubicle with me. I promise." He can't even look up anymore. </p><p>"What you want is to torture Pertinger, whether you mean it that way or not. No." </p><p>"Potter! You pigheaded arse!" Draco stops himself before he stamps his foot like the spoiled child he once was. "What do you want from me?" </p><p>"Nothing you could ever give me." All of Potter's familiar anger has washed away, replaced by the frightening, steely Potter who calls him Mr. Malfoy. </p><p>Again the urge to flee seizes Draco by the throat, but he roots his feet to the tiled floor. "Don't make this about us." </p><p>"You always did," Potter says, and his voice is full of soft danger. </p><p>"You can't," Draco says, eyes fluttering shut for a moment, "pretend you don't know me <i>and</i> hold our past against me." </p><p>"Don't you know? I'm the Boy Who Lived Again." Potter's expression is so lazy and disdainful, as his eyes take in all of Draco's unimpressive form, that Draco wants to slap it off his face. "I can do just about anything." </p><p>It is the ultimate shutdown. There is no combination of words Draco could ever come up with that would make for an adequate response. </p><p>"Give me just a little time with Pertinger," Draco says anyway. "It's the only thing I'll ask of you." </p><p>Potter's eyes flash. "The only thing?" </p><p>It's not a promise Draco can make. "Yes," he says. "The only thing." </p><p>Potter takes his time in putting his wand back into the holster up the sleeve of his Auror robes, pushing his glasses up his nose, then re-clasping his hands behind his back. </p><p>"Who do you need?" he asks, and relief floods Draco's body, despite being tinged with dread. </p><p>Potter allows a mere four people to enter Pertinger's room. Draco has to work fast, darting about St. Mungo's and interrogating people about their magical prowess without tripping over hospital staff. His final lineup consists of a Squib, a Healer known to make quick work of just about any magical injury, a Hogwarts fifth year who couldn't put down his homework, and the tired looking orderly who led them to Pertinger's room in the first place. Potter is entrusted with the wand of the student and the orderly, though he doesn't know <i>why</i> he's holding the wands of two of the strangers marching in and out of Pertinger's room. </p><p>Out of the four, Pertinger only tries to curse the Healer, though she doesn't try nearly as hard as she did to curse Potter. </p><p>"I hope it was worth it," Potter says, with one last glance at Pertinger as the orderly puts her under. </p><p>"It was," Draco assures him, and he cannot get back to his desk nor ink his quill fast enough before he's writing out his new theory on fresh parchment. </p><p>Unfortunately, his theory has nothing to do with the source of the curse—not yet, anyway. It's ultimately a small piece of the puzzle, more to do with the curse's function than anything else. His entire next week—dutifully glued to his desk, as per Potter's instructions—is spent scribbling stream-of-consciousness notes on what his new findings mean, and how <i>much</i> they mean given his woefully scrawny sample size. </p><p>If he's right, then the curse has a life of its own within the cursed victim. Not just a victim anymore—a <i>host</i>, living home to a curse that checks potential new victims for two things. First: A wand. Pertinger ignored both the wandless star Hogwarts student as well as Draco himself. </p><p>And second, especially judging by Pertinger's reaction to Potter: A giant well of raw magical power. Pertinger herself was a prime victim, or host, being powerful herself. Draco hasn't been made humble enough yet not to see himself as a reasonably powerful wizard, too, but without a wand, it seems he doesn't rate. </p><p>The question he still can't answer is <i>why</i>. </p><p>Ten days into the case, Draco can no longer think while trapped in the oppressively shadowy corner that is his cubicle. Potter wants more out of Draco's scant few minutes spent with Pertinger, and Draco has nothing new. Potter had said he could still roam so long as it was inside the Auror offices, hadn't he? </p><p>Walking brushes the rust from Draco's brain, lets his thoughts connect all the quicker, flowing into each other seamlessly. There are much fewer glances his way in the Auror offices, now that the Aurors have gotten used to their mean-faced new mascot, so Draco sets off around the track, which is to say the floor around the centralized pack of Auror desks. </p><p>There's something about this curse that he's missing, and he'll have to suss it out without ever seeing Pertinger or another victim ever again, at least on Ministry hours. The press keeps the details of the curse quiet, ostensibly to protect readers from mass hysteria and panic, and damn them all for it. He's gone over the case files what feels like hundreds of times by now, and the whole thing is so frustratingly full of holes. The case files are just data collected from other sources, and many of those sources seem to have failed their due diligence. Curse fatalities have, in many cases, simply been listed with "V.V." as cause of death, and details are muddy or missing. The harder he thinks, the faster he walks. </p><p>He stops by the door in the corner that leads to the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts office. It's a baffling setup, he thinks; did Weasley Sr. really have to walk the length of the Auror offices each morning to get to his own desk in a much tinier room, back when Draco was a child? </p><p>It doesn't just lead to the Misuse office, of course. He pokes his head through the door. There's a whole corridor back here, with another door down by the other end he's never explored before. Draco should, of course, mind his own business. He should probably go back to his desk, in fact, and comb the case files for missed details. </p><p>The sound of a sharp inhale nearly escapes him. </p><p>There is no more hemming and hawing over whether the corridor is allowed to him. Draco knows that sound, and the ones that come after it when he pricks his ears, having made them himself plenty of times before starting therapy. He takes off for the mysterious door, and wrenches the door open, ready to help—</p><p>—Potter. </p><p>Potter kneels on the rug of a sparsely-decorated room, facing away from the door with both hands on the back of his shorn head. He rocks gently in place, which does little to alleviate the way his staccato breaths sound like he's drawing them in through thick fabric. </p><p>His thirteen year old self would mock Potter. His seventeen year old self would simply leave, neither harming nor helping. But Draco at thirty-two crosses the distance between himself and Potter, and kneels in kind as he puts firm hands on Potter's back. "You need to breathe," he says, impersonating his therapist. </p><p>Potter's very skin seems to jump under Draco's touch, and he looks over his shoulder at Draco with eyes that are both panicked and glazed at the same time. His gaze puts a queasy lump in Draco's throat, but he forces it down. He tells himself he wouldn't be able to face his therapist if he'd found someone having a panic attack and not helped them through it, never mind who it is. </p><p>"Like this," Draco says, and he repositions himself to kneel in front of Potter rather than beside him. He draws in a big, exaggerated breath, letting his chest puff up tall. Potter is not imitating him, but Draco breathes out with the same overwrought slowness anyway. "Do it with me." </p><p>On the second try, Potter takes a shuddering breath. "Good," he says, despite the fact that Potter releases it immediately. "Again." </p><p>Draco begins to count Potter through his breaths, steady beats up to the number seven before counting back down to zero. "You're okay," he reassures Potter through numb, disembodied lips. "You're okay." </p><p>It's Draco's turn to jump when Potter lays his big, heavy head against his shoulder, his breaths finally coming evenly. His whole body radiates fatigue and pain. He doesn't remember doing this with his therapist; usually by now he'd be sitting back in a big, cushiony chair, finding all the nerves in his skin again. There are no cushiony chairs in this strange room though, and now Draco is afraid to move. </p><p>Five minutes later, Potter finally sits up. Shame makes his features look soft and childish. </p><p>"Thank you," he whispers, and is on his feet and exiting within seconds. Draco stays in the mystery room for a while longer, finding that now he, too, needs to reconnect with his corporeal form. </p><p>The next morning, the news comes that Pertinger has lost all her magic.</p>
