    <p>Imagine your worst headache ever. Multiply that times like 246,000. That’s about how you felt on your last first day of school.</p><p>You had been just a tiny 2nd year when the battle of Hogwarts happened. You were one of the survivors, the brave who live on to tell the stories. But 5 years later, the school was at full capacity with the famous legends of Harry Potter and his defeat of Voldemort. No one cared to filter any more with “you know who”. He was just another far off legend  and it was truly ridiculous how quickly people forgot.</p><p>But you couldn’t. The voice that spoke to every student still rung through your head and haunted your dreams at night. Not to mention the pale faces of every single dead student. Students you looked up to, that tutored you and were there when you were so confused and overwhelmed. Your slytherin family; the people who had taught you that being a slytherin had nothing to do with being evil or being someone like Draco Malfoy, fell silently next to Gryffindors, Ravenclaws, and Hufflepuffs. They stayed behind, despite having no love for glory and bravery. They stayed behind because the school they loved was in danger and that’s who they were in the end.</p><p>Now, Hogwarts was relatively safe. Professor McGonagall took over the headmistress position and the whole school was run like a clock: without a single hitch. Dumbledore was definitely eccentric in the way he ran things, putting students in danger rather regularly and setting groups against each other. It always created an atmosphere that made it difficult to learn. Under McGonagall’s thumb, the school flourished and Hogwarts became one of the most well known schools for a perfect education for magic.</p><p>Now you were well on your way to being an Auror in the new Ministry of Magic. Right along with the famous Harry Potter, saving the magic world from all the sorts of things that almost destroyed everything you loved 5 years before. And despite your quiet demeanor and soft spoken personality, you were one of the best witches in your class.</p><p>No thanks to the constantly changing Dark Arts Professors. The one thing that hadn’t been fixed was the curse. Every year there was a new professor, with new wisdom and new ways of teaching. It kept you on your toes at least. The benefit is every student got to learn a lot of different things about evil from the many brilliant (sometimes less than amazing) professors that spent the year at Hogwarts. The not-so-great side is the constant never knowing what to expect.</p><p>And this year was no exception. You walked into the Great Hall with anticipation, hoping for a Professor that would help you grow to new heights before you left Hogwarts for good. All the first years were looking around in awe, but the magic was lost on you now. Hogwarts was your home, but for a place to be home, you get used to it. Even so, it was always heart-warming to see the first years react in a way you wished you still could.</p><p>McGonagall kept up the tradition of putting everyone through the boring and excessively long talk before the feast begins and needless to say, you weren’t paying attention. You looked over at your friend, Lizzie, with a knowing smile. She winked back and rolled her eyes, displaying the same boredom you felt.</p><p>“And I would like everyone to give a warm welcome to our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Thomas Hiddleston”, McGonagall finished with a warm clap that soon the entire student body joined along in. A tall figure walked in through the side door, greeting the school warmly.</p><p>Your breath left your lungs in an instant as you took him in. He was the youngest professor that you knew of and there was something about him, something mysterious and wonderful all at once. He was dressed in bright blue robes that accented his beautifully golden features and his eyes felt like they pierced straight through your soul. All thoughts of food or boredom disappeared instantly as you saw him. He was almost angelic; the candlelight glinted off his features in the most impossible and glowing way. </p><p>The room had long since stopped their clapping as you couldn’t help but stare at him. The noise erupting around you as all students began to partake in the feast, but it was all background noise. He talked and joked along with the other teachers warmly, but he caught your gaze, just for a minute. He took in your open stare and smiled softly. It felt like the whole world had paused as he looked at you. Your heartbeat skyrocketed and your body flushed with a fierce heat. It was like someone had given you a Weasley Fever Fudge. </p><p>It may have just been for a few second but it felt like a lifetime. You felt someone shake you out of it, Lizzie probably, and you were the first one to break the stare. By the time you looked back, he was animatedly talking with Hagrid. Hagrid looked nearly as thrilled to talk to him as you might have felt sitting next to him. You wondered what kind of things he took interest in with the game keeper, what stories he'd be telling. Probably some adventure or another. Maybe he was asking questions about the school itself, or about the care for magical creatures class. Whatever the conversation was about, you knew in that single second, you'd give anything to be part of it, just to have all of his attention on you for a single moment. </p><p>Needless to say, this would be an interesting year for you.</p>
