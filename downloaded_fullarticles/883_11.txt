    <p>It was a family line that was cursed from the start. The witches born in that line were said to be powerful, so much that they were <em>sold off to the highest bidder</em> at a young age. Because of that, it was the tradition that the wizards who married into the family were required to take the bride’s surname to keep the family line prominent. It was a long tale of dark intentions and nefarious misdeeds, and every pureblood in Britain was well aware of what they started calling The Bloodstone Family Curse.</p><p> </p><p>She was engaged to the Malfoy heir when she was five, growing up knowing the boy and despising him all the same. The girl was an anomaly to the Bloodstone family, the first witch to ever be sorted in a place other than Slytherin. She was a kind, trusting and loyal girl who fit in well with Hufflepuff. However, while she understood her place in society, she also disliked it. She never thought herself as anything special as people treated her to be, and tried hard to do the right thing. It was at Hogwarts when she slowly came to the conclusion that she didn’t want her life to be pre-determined by anyone.</p><p> </p><p>It was a scandal when it finally happened. The pureblood event of the century was reduced to a shocking excerpt in the Daily Prophet, as Willow Bloodstone’s betrayal to Lucius Malfoy was on the front page for all witches and wizards to see. She had run off on the day of her wedding, a source from the Black family stated, fleeing in the arms of a muggle traveler and leaving behind her entire life, her family, and a disgruntled groom that never knew what was coming.</p><p> </p><p>The scandal blemished the Bloodstone name, and for those who were on Willow’s side, rejoiced in the fact that The Bloodstone Family Curse had not claimed another victim.</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Willow never liked Wiltshire. It was full of traditional purebloods and their closed-minded views. Ever since she was a child, she never fit into their society and its rules. The Bloodstones were a regal name full of pride and confidence, sitting among other families like the Blacks and the Malfoys and the Parkinsons, a noble family once part of the sacred twenty-nine…up until she left.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t imagine that she’d ever come back to Wiltshire, to Britain. She never thought that she’d ever step back inside Bloodstone Manor. She was so happy to be with him, with Daniel. She never once looked back on her life before she left with him on that train. For years she was happier than she’d ever thought she would be, becoming a wife and mother to Daniel Feinberg and soon her lovely twin daughters. She never thought she’d actually be missing her life back in Phoenix, Arizona, living as a muggle and thinking about her daughters’ futures in Ilvermorny.</p><p> </p><p>She never thought that Daniel would die of a heart attack on the same day her parents passed, or that dark magic was somehow involved in his death. She’d never imagine she’d be brought back to Bloodstone Manor against her will, with her five-year-old twins at her side, only days after the funeral.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t have foreseen that one of her daughters saw his death coming months ago, her first-ever vision. She had no clue that she would be too frightened to say anything about it. She couldn’t have known that she would stop talking when it happened when Daniel had finally collapsed right in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>All she knew was that Seers in England were registered with the Ministry, not like in America. She knew that Seers were why her bloodline was powerful and that she had been the anomaly, the only Bloodstone Witch that was born without the Sight, but cursed to remember. She definitely knew that she had to keep her daughter’s secret because now they weren’t in America. They were now in Wiltshire, where the closest manor next to hers belonged to Lucius Malfoy himself.</p><p> </p><p>She just hoped that nothing else would happen, but felt like her hopes were for naught.</p><p> </p><p>Daniel wasn’t at her side anymore to distract her worries.</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>It was an early Sunday morning in the year 1985 when Kitty Bloodstone was tired of keeping out of trouble. She and her sister Judith had been told to stay within the grounds, don’t wander off the property. She was forbidden to step foot across the gilded fence into the grounds next to theirs, a place she was specifically warned to stay away from.</p><p> </p><p>Judith was with her when Kitty decided to explore. She hadn’t spoken since Daniel died, but she didn’t need to when her own disappointed frown spoke everything on her mind. She glared steadily at her sister, folding her arms over her dress.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not going to get in trouble,” Kitty said dismissively, smiling despite her sister’s glare. She knew what exactly Judith was trying to convey, as she knew her all too well. Kitty pulled on a toothy grin, accented by a missing bicuspid. She looked completely different than her twin, wearing dirty muggle styled overalls and her hair pulled back in a messy braid. Judith, however, dressed properly for a young lady, with a dark dress and equally dark and clean shoes with her hair cut around her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>Judith quirked a brow and unfolded her arms, grabbing Kitty’s wrist with one hand and motioning towards the canvas of greenery beyond the fence. Kitty only giggled at her sister’s doubt and shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>“The wards are only for anti-app…appare…apper…anti-poofing!” She said quickly, “So no one funny poofs in and out.”</p><p> </p><p>Judith didn’t look convinced, almost wary about the future, things that could happen that haven’t presented themselves before her. She tried one last time to stop her sister, stepping between her and the fence and giving her the biggest frown she could give.</p><p> </p><p>Kitty rolled her eyes, “Nothing bad’s going to happen!” She said exhaustedly, finally moving around her sister and grappling the fence with her hands. She used to climb everything and anything back in Phoenix, aside from the cacti. A fence won’t keep her separated from adventure.</p><p> </p><p>Judith watched on as Kitty climbed the fence like she was made for it, making a deaf-defying leap onto the other side and giving Judith a thumbs-up before scurrying onward towards a group of trees. The bespectacled girl bit her lip worriedly and finally admitted defeat to her sister’s antics, turning away from the impending disaster and retreating to the gazebo in the middle of the garden.</p><p> </p><p>The lush green expanse of land was decorated with peacocks, but while she wanted to chase them, her mind was on the inner garden that was kept private by hedges. She kept close to the trees as she snuck further inward, finally coming up to one of the many hedges and diving in. The garden inside was prettier than everything outside, with blooming flowers everywhere and intricate stone pathways. She found herself on the edge of a great expanse inside a beautiful garden, the centerpiece of the lush and pretty flowers was an impressive fountain that housed fish. Kitty’s eyes widened at the sight and she ran towards the fountain, leaning over the edge and reaching for one of the many fishes under the water. As soon as her finger touched the water, the ones within reach swam away in a panic. Kitty pouted at that, staying in place to watch the fish for a while before tearing her eyes away. She looked upwards, past the fountain and towards the manor, all of her attention falling onto a far figure that wasn’t there before she appeared. Kitty gazed at the woman from afar, taking in her stunning beauty and ivory skin, long silken pale hair and equally breathtaking eyes. She was stuck in her own feet, unable to move as the woman stepped towards her with a stoic expression and curiously cold eyes. She looked unlike her mother, almost like an otherworldly being, while her mother defined nature and fertility, this woman was similar to a story from her muggle books, a beautiful fairy queen, but she obviously wasn’t one of those.</p><p> </p><p>Kitty still had trouble moving, unable to think of anything to say because she was caught. This was the woman’s property, and now Kitty was there, trying to play with her fish, gazing at her peacocks.</p><p> </p><p>The woman stopped moving a good distance away from Kitty, patiently waiting. She didn’t look angry or alarmed, but somewhat curious. But then, everyone was curious upon meeting a Bloodstone Witch, even though Kitty still didn’t know why. Kitty finally felt the ability to move, letting go of the ledge of the fountain and swallowing nervously.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you a fairy queen?” She had to be sure, just in case. Kitty’s question caught Narcissa off-guard, and her cold eyes became slightly warmer at the accusation. The woman didn’t know how to answer that, actually, suddenly amused by the honest inquiry from the small American girl.</p><p> </p><p>“Dobby.” The woman said softly, startling Kitty when the smaller house-elf appeared just next to her. “Bring us some cookies and milk.” She said kindly, gesturing to Kitty across from them. The house-elf’s eyes couldn’t get any bigger when he laid his eyes upon the girl, stumbling back as he inhaled sharply only to nod passionately.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Missus, anything!”</p><p> </p><p>And then he was gone, startling Kitty again. The girl blinked owlishly and looked around, wondering where the house-elf went to.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa chuckled at the girl’s reaction, “Would you care to join me, little girl?” She questioned, sweeping her arm in an elegant way to direct her to an antique dining table.</p><p> </p><p>Kitty nodded slowly, “Um, but, are you a fairy queen? I need to be sure if I should call you Your Highness or not. I don’t want to be rude.”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa couldn’t help but smile.</p><p> </p><p>Dobby came back quickly to serve Kitty and his mistress glasses of milk and a platter full of cookies, the house-elf’s appearance and disappearance still startling Kitty. She faltered in her story, the one where she discovered her magic a year ago and went on sending electric zaps to the children she knew and claiming it was static electricity, proceeding to explain what static electricity was and further on describing what dryers were.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa didn’t seem to mind Kitty’s rambling as she tried to describe muggle items to a pureblood witch, actually taking amusement at how a five-year-old girl was so smart for her age. “You’re quite intelligent, Miss Katherine.” She commented, hiding a smile behind her hand. “Did your father teach you or did your mother?”</p><p> </p><p>Kitty’s eyes brightened at the mention of her father, “Oh, dad took after my grandpa Jude, they were really smart. He taught me about a lot of muggle things like electronics and computers--really huge muggle machines! He also taught my sister to play the violin.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman looked intrigued at the last part, chuckling again, “The violin? That’s quite a talent. Do you know the creator of the violin was a wizard? It’s considered an honorable skill to have, to play a wizard’s instrument.”</p><p> </p><p>Kitty giggled at that, taking a sip of her milk and remembering to dab her mouth with the napkin like Narcissa taught her to. “Judith, my sister, she’s very good at the violin. Dad called her a prodigy. She’s named after our grandpa.”</p><p> </p><p>“A very lovely name indeed.” She agreed, “Who pray tell are you named after?”</p><p> </p><p>Kitty grinned at the question, “My grandma, grandpa always called her Kitty though. They met during the war. My middle name is Alice, though, named after Alice in Wonderland.” She added sheepishly, avoiding the inquisitive amusement that Narcissa was expressing towards her.</p><p> </p><p>The woman was enjoying this delightful conversation, more than she thought she would. Despite whose daughter she was, the girl was bright and charming, and instantly she wanted her son to be here with them. No, he was with his father at the moment, the one time in the whole month that Lucius took Draco out for fatherly bonding with his son. Lucius had told her and Draco about the blood-traitor harlot living next door and the children that Draco was barred from seeing, despite the few moments that Draco chanced a look beyond the garden to the land next to them and the two curious children outside, enjoying the summer.</p><p> </p><p>She then thought about the woman, Willow, how she wouldn’t enjoy knowing that her daughter was having cookies with Narcissa Malfoy, remembering how Kitty explained that her mother was trying to keep her distance. Willow Bloodstone understood her placement in the pureblood society, but the poor woman shouldn’t be vilified for following her heart. Narcissa loved Lucius, she utterly adored him and her son, and if it wasn’t for Willow’s scandalous move against her own family, then Narcissa wouldn’t have had her husband and family. Everyone shunned her for loving a muggle, everyone but her. Narcissa had no reason to treat her or her children coldly, and they were still Bloodstone Witches, they still had status among the pureblood elite.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa waited for Kitty to end her description of her family life in Arizona and how she missed cactus flowers and their juicy fruits, as it was almost time for Lucius to come back and she didn’t want to get caught. “Let’s continue this tomorrow, Miss Katherine.” She said kindly. “If you come after ten, then you may be able to meet with my son, Draco.”</p><p> </p><p>Kitty blinked, looking back until she remembered that her view was obstructed, “I need to get back before Judith tells mom. Are you sure I can come back? This has been really awesome!”</p><p> </p><p>She chuckled again, nodding. “You’re a breath of fresh air, Katherine Bloodstone, of course, you may come back. Go quickly so you won’t get caught.” She stood up when Kitty did, watching the girl dart away and stop to wave before wedging herself through the hedges. Narcissa smiled and summoned Dobby to take the dishes away and make him keep Kitty a secret from Lucius. The house-elf only nodded enthusiastically and poofed away.</p><p> </p><p>Tomorrow was going to be interesting, indeed.</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Kitty was in the garden at the perfect time, wearing a simple shirt and shorts and a ball cap over her hair that was emblazoned with a western motif that said Tombstone, AZ on the front. She kept herself hidden away, upon a tree at the farthest corner of the garden, watching down at a small blonde child practicing spells on a toy wand. Narcissa was sitting near the house, quietly sipping tea as Draco waved his wand at the fish inside the fountain, attempting to get them to fly.</p><p> </p><p>“Wing arum Levi oso!”</p><p> </p><p>Kitty leaned down on the branch she was sitting on, picking a leaf off of the smaller branches and setting it into her hand. She blew on it and watched it flutter from her hand and away from the tree. She squinted, pointing at it and concentrating hard, the leaf floating towards the fountain the more she kept blowing towards it.</p><p> </p><p>“Win garden Lev io sa.”</p><p> </p><p>The wording was all wrong and Draco knew it, not like the wording from the book. He wasn’t good at Latin yet and all he could do with his toy wand so far was make sparks. The sparks were pretty, but he wanted more out of his magic. Draco flicked his wand again, blinking suddenly when a leaf was floating forward and fluttering into the fountain. He watched it curiously, looking back and staring at the tree that wasn’t anywhere near the fountain. He frowned, keeping his eyes on the tree curiously.</p><p> </p><p>Kitty let out a whistle her aunt Elizabeth would do to attract birds, grinning widely when the boy took to the sound and walked forward, having forgotten why he was at the fountain to begin with. She continued with all the whistles she knew, trying not to giggle in between. When Draco got close enough the tree suddenly rustled, the boy making a sudden sound that caught Narcissa’s attention. The woman watched merrily as Kitty dropped onto the boy from above, tackling him into the ground with a wide grin, effectively knocking off her own hat as she sat on the other’s lap.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello!” She greeted happily.</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s eyes widened at the sight of the girl and he felt his heart stammer, confusing him greatly as he stared up at the girl over him. It was the girl from the next house, it was <em>her </em>. He stayed still when she climbed off of him and held out her hand, helping him up. He didn’t know what to do, looking back at his mother and noticing her giggling at the sight, but remembering how his father told him strictly not to talk to the Bloodstone girls.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you alright?” Kitty asked then, frowning slightly and reaching forward to touch his forehead. Draco froze in his spot, feeling his heart stammer again while he watched her perplexed stare before she felt her own forehead and tried to gauge the temperature between them. “Well, you’re not sick.” She concluded.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not supposed to talk to you.” Draco spoke up finally, “Papa says you’re filthy.”</p><p> </p><p>Kitty blinked at the words, looking down at her clothes and actually looking for dirt on her. “I took a bath.” She countered obliviously, her eyes coming to fall on her hat and she moved to grab it, grinning again and putting it on. “My name’s Kitty! Your mom told me I could come over and visit.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco looked towards his mother again, his eyes wide at the accusation but finding nothing that told him otherwise. She didn’t look angry or upset. She actually looked interested and amused. She waved Draco over to her and he nodded, hurrying over to his mother. Kitty wasn’t far behind, moving quicker and taking Draco’s hand between the distance from the tree to Narcissa. The hand in his was warm and sent him an electric shock, causing the boy to stumble right after she took it before he righted himself and acted as if it didn’t happen. This girl was doing crazy things to him and he didn’t even know her, but while he wanted to take his hand away he didn’t want to all the same. "Mum?” Draco questioned, looking down at their joined hands again and suddenly hearing the girl giggle at his side. He stopped suddenly, staring at her again. He was being assaulted with new and weird feelings that were frightening to think about. Was this girl here for him? Was she his personal toy?</p><p> </p><p>“Draco, darling, introduce yourself to Miss Katherine,” Narcissa said kindly, smiling at him.</p><p> </p><p>He nodded slowly, turning to Kitty and looking at her once again, wondering just why his father considered her filthy. “My name is Draco Lucius Malfoy.” He said it formally, like how he was told to say it. Kitty only grinned in reaction and did a small curtsy to him, something that wasn’t really what she wanted it to be, but worked anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“My name is Katherine Alice Bloodstone.” She said pleasantly. “I’d really like for us to be friends, it’s not as fun anymore being by myself, and my sister refuses to speak.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco couldn’t help but enjoy her funny accent, but one thing stuck to his mind. “Why won’t your sister speak?” He asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Kitty looked at Narcissa then, frowning worriedly and turning back towards Draco, “My dad died months ago, you see. She was there when it happened. Actually, she kinda saw it happening before it happened—“ Kitty let go of Draco’s hand suddenly, covering her mouth quickly and staring back at Narcissa with wide eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Judith dropped her book at the exact same moment Kitty spilled her secret, glaring heatedly in her direction and getting up quickly to run back inside.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>Willow didn’t know what to do, pacing the drawing-room as her daughter watched on worriedly. She was caught, she was found out, and the one who had all the power was the wife of Lucius Malfoy. She knew something that Willow was trying so hard to keep secret, and her future was in the hands of a woman that could use it to her own advantage.</p><p> </p><p>Willow breathed in sharply as the wards tingled, worrying her hands together as she fretted this outcome. She should have known that secrets couldn’t stay secret for long, and that her daughter would be pining for companionship. She stopped pacing when Judith’s hand tightened around her dress, the girl staring up at her with the same worrisome thoughts and would-be futures that presented themselves before her. Willow picked her daughter up and cradled her at her side, putting on a brave smile for Judith when the door knocker announced their arrival.</p><p> </p><p>Kitty was hiding behind Narcissa when Willow opened the door, looking guilty. “I oopsied.” She said quickly, avoiding her sister’s stern glare and taking solace in the fact that Draco was holding her hand.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t be mad at her daughter, keeping her eye on Narcissa as she smiled down at Kitty. “Go show your new friend your room.” She said kindly, only tearing her eyes away from Narcissa to watch Kitty drag Draco further inside and race to her room.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we have a word, Willow?” Narcissa asked quietly. Willow nodded and stepped back, keeping a good hold on Judith, who couldn’t take her wary eyes off of Narcissa. The woman waited for quite a while, going through her words carefully. “I understand your fears.” She said calmly, “If it were my Draco, then I would very well be just as afraid as you are.”</p><p> </p><p>Willow finally set Judith down, watching her daughter hide behind her. “I don’t wish to start a fight.” She said quietly, “Whatever you must want, I can’t…”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not here to intimidate you.” She said quickly, hoping to reassure the other woman. Narcissa stayed a fair distance from Willow, approaching her like one would a foal. “I’m here as a mother, first and foremost. Your daughter, she’s a very charming girl. Please, do not punish her for something she never meant to expose.”</p><p> </p><p>Willow watched Narcissa cautiously, her hands clasping together as she thought over those words. “Please, Lucius must never know…”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa smiled, “I will not tell him, Willow. As I said, if it were my son, then I would do anything that I could to keep it a secret. I will not do that to you.”</p><p> </p><p>Tears stung at the corners of Willow’s eyes, unable to understand that this woman wasn’t threatening her as she had feared. “Why are you so nice? You were there, Narcissa, you witnessed it yourself. I tarnished a pureblood legacy by doing what I did, I insulted your family, I insulted the Malfoys, I shamed Cypress and Drusilla.”</p><p> </p><p>She took a step forward, reaching cautiously for Willow’s hands. “If you hadn’t done what you did, Willow, then I wouldn’t have my beloved family. Draco wouldn’t have been born. You chose to follow your heart. I cannot fault you for that, I don’t care if the man was a muggle traveler or another pureblood. You’ve given me my husband, Willow, and no matter how angry and betrayed Lucius may feel by your mere image, he will soon realize that you leaving gave him what he currently has.” She squeezed her hands sympathetically, closing the gap between them. “Willow Bloodstone, please allow me to help you.”</p><p> </p><p>Willow’s eyes were wet with tears, unable to believe that such kindness was coming from Narcissa Black. The Bloodstones and the Blacks were close allies and friends, but for Willow, the Black sisters never cared for her. Bellatrix couldn’t stand her and thought that her power was being wasted on such a clumsy little Hufflepuff. While Andromeda was guarded around Willow, Narcissa was the silent anomaly. She had the best face when it came to matters that didn’t concern her, never showing anything but her cold demeanor, she was graceful and elegant and well trained in her own emotions. Though, Willow just assumed she was like Bellatrix, who didn’t care for Willow because she was anything but the perfect pureblood witch she was trained to be. Now she was being presented with an alternate view of Narcissa Malfoy nee Black, someone with a kind heart and motherly instincts. Willow nodded slowly and finally broke down, releasing Narcissa’s hands to fully hug her, something she missed doing with her own family, Daniel’s family, who always embraced her when she needed comfort.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa wasn’t used to such a gesture, given who her family was, but she endured it for the woman, pulling on a smile and leaning into the hug and rubbing her back in a comforting gesture.</p><p> </p><p>“Please help me.” Willow whispered quietly, “With Daniel gone, I don’t know what to do anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa brushed part of Willow’s thick curls out of her face, humming thoughtfully. “Do you remember Severus Snape, Willow?”</p><p> </p><p>The woman stilled, wiping her tears away after a moment of thought, and the more she thought the more her cheeks colored. “I—I do. I remember him very well…”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa chuckled at that, “Well, he’s a very good family friend of ours and a well-respected Potions Master. I do believe that he may know a way to help your daughter with her condition, and he’s a private man, so your secret will be safe with him.”</p><p> </p><p>Willow chanced a look down towards Judith, how the girl was still clutching her dress and watching the conversation wearily. She broke her steady gaze on Narcissa and looked at her mother. The two of them conversed silently before Judith finally let go and ran down the hallway to hide in the library.</p><p> </p><p>“Summon him as soon as possible,” Willow said finally, watching after her daughter with a concerned frown.</p><hr/><p>

  <em> 1971 </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It was a cold parting, one with high expectations placed upon the youngest Bloodstone heir, the only Bloodstone heir. Willow didn’t get a fond farewell from her mother, a warm hug or some kind words. Drusilla was a cold woman, and Cypress was a distant father. They wished her farewell formally, but in Willow’s mind, they could have shown more emotion sending her a formal letter than seeing her off in person at platform nine and three-quarters.</em>
  <em> It was up to the Blacks to look after Willow, to keep her out of trouble, as she was a troublesome girl who needed the right role models in her life like Bellatrix Black and Regulus Black. The entire family was almost like her own family, in a way, a strange, extended family, which troubled her sometimes. She often wondered why she was betrothed to the Malfoy heir when her mother adored the Blacks. Not that she wanted to marry any of them, especially Regulus. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She found a nearly empty compartment to sit in, just two other students inside the room. She stood awkwardly as she and the two other first-years stared at each other. The small redhead had bright eyes, green as emeralds, looking at her with optimistic hopes while the black-haired black-eyed boy at her side stared at her like she was a burden, for entering their little space and ruining whatever conversation they were having. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow just knew that they didn’t look at her like all the other purebloods, which meant that they weren’t purebloods at all and that she was safe in this car. She smiled brightly and stepped forward, only to trip on her own floor-length dress and fall forward, crying out as she did. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Good heavens! Are you alright?” The redhead went to her side immediately, helping Willow back to her feet. The pureblood only laughed nervously and brushed the many ringlets away from her face, smiling reassuringly. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I tend to do that, don’t mind me.” She said softly, “Is this compartment taken?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Yes.” The boy said immediately as the other girl said “No.” The two of them stopped and the boy stared incredulously at his friend until the girl rolled her eyes amusedly. “He means no. Don’t mind Sevvie, he’s nervous.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow giggled at the name, turning back to the boy in black, “Well, that makes two of us. Hello Sevvie, my name’s Willow.” She held her hand out towards his, which caught him off guard. He only stared at it questioningly without touching it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Don’t be rude.” The girl whispered, nudging him into shaking her hand. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Lily.” The boy, Sevvie, said aloud, looking right at her, “We should be well guarded if we’re going to be going to Hogwarts. Not everyone likes us lot.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “It shouldn’t mean we can’t make friends.” Lily countered. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “We don’t need friends, we have each other!” The boy argued. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow watched on, sitting herself down across from them. “Are you both muggleborn?” She questioned suddenly. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> That seemed to set Sevvie off, and he glared right at Willow. “What does that have to do with anything?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Sevvie!” Lily said exhaustedly, “I’m muggleborn, but he’s a half-blood.” She explained simply, looking weary. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow’s eyes widened, and she instantly jumped from her seat to the one next to Lily, clasping her hands over hers. “You’re a muggleborn? Can you tell me what it’s like? I’ve never met a muggleborn and my father and mother keep saying how your lot shouldn’t be able to practice magic, but I always had this thought that it sounded so cruel, and I just was always curious what muggleborns are like and now I’ve met one—“ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Sevvie stared at her incredulously, “Just who the bloody hell are you?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> That seemed to stop Willow entirely, pausing her voice just long enough. She retracted her hands from Lily’s and straightened out her dress, “Well, um, I guess…I’m a pureblood, you see. My family’s very strict and traditional. But in no way am I like them!” She said quickly, “I don’t practice dark magic or anything like that!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Calm down, calm down!” Lily insisted, smiling at Willow. “You’re a pureblood? I’ve never met one, and neither has Sevvie. Oh, how about we introduce ourselves again? My name is Lily Evans, and my friend is Severus Snape.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow settled down at that, “Do excuse me, my name is Willow Bloodstone…my family’s one of the sacred twenty-nine.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Severus had to do a double-take, staring at Willow like she was crazy. He’s heard about the sacred twenty-nine from his mother, but never had he met any of them. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow winced at the way Severus stared at her, shying her eyes away and falling quiet. “I’m sorry for disturbing you two, I just wanted to get away from the Blacks. They watch over me, a bit too much.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You weren’t disturbing us, please stay. You can ask me anything!” Lily reached out to take her hand again, looking back at Severus. “Right, Sevvie?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The boy narrowed his eyes at Willow but turned his head away, slumping in his seat and grumbling. “Yeah, sure. Have at it.” </em>

</p><p>The violin music was somber, tugging at Narcissa’s heartstrings as she listened to Judith’s haunting music. The girl was holed up in the library all day, obviously knowing what was going to happen today. The woman wanted to go into the room and try to coax her out but kept herself from doing so. Willow had explained to her about everything, who Daniel was and what he did, and how much he meant towards Judith. She loved him more than anything, and just to lose him so quickly…</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa stepped away from the library, making her way down the hall and hearing a faint giggle from the stairwell. She turned just in time to see Draco chasing Kitty down the second-floor hallway, and she smiled just a little. Draco hadn’t taken to anyone so well, and ever since they met, he and Kitty were always together. It was endearing, and she sometimes wondered how they would be like when they were older.</p><p> </p><p>She quirked a small grin, shaking her head. Now wasn’t the time to plan for the future, today was about Judith and helping her hide her problem. Narcissa put her other thoughts aside to watch Willow gaze at the fireplace inside the drawing-room, the auburn-haired woman looking anxious and worried.</p><p> </p><p>“He said around noon, did he?” She questioned, checking her watch.</p><p> </p><p>“Give him time, Willow. He’s a very busy man.” Narcissa said calmly, “He’ll be here soon, I’ve told him it was of the utmost importance.” She sat down next to Willow, laying a supporting touch to her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Just as she said it the fireplace roared, and the man was suddenly there, brushing off the remaining soot off of his cloak and stepping out of the fireplace. Narcissa stood up to welcome him, and slowly Willow joined her. The woman found herself staring at the man, how he looked so similar to the boy she last saw back at Hogwarts. Her hands folded together, her breath stilling as she stared directly at his eyes, and how they were carefully guarded.</p><p> </p><p>Severus stilled when those curious green eyes caught his own, and he had to keep himself from doing something he did by default. The woman was all-too-familiar to him, bringing back old memories of the clumsy Hufflepuff that tried on numerous occasions to befriend him. The girl who befriended his beloved Lily and tried to make peace within Hogwarts all in vain. Not a girl anymore, but a woman, a woman that looked utterly broken from a private loss of her own.</p><p> </p><p>“Severus.” Willow smiled, brushing her curls away from her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Willow.” Severus breathed, finally taking in what he was hearing. A somber sonata piece floating over all of them like a painful memory.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa clasped her hands together, “Good, you both remember each other.”</p><p> </p><p>Willow shied her eyes away from Severus then, “He’s not that easy to forget,” She said softly.</p><p> </p><p>Something about that unnerved Severus, and he stiffened at her words, “Quite.” He said curtly. “I was told that this was a pressing matter.” He said then.</p><p> </p><p>Willow took a step forward towards him, only to cry out and stumble into his arms, again tripping over her dress. “Oh!”</p><p> </p><p>“Learn to walk!” Severus chided, catching her and peering down at her hem, “Haven’t you learned to pick up your hem before moving?”</p><p> </p><p>The comment made Willow smile again, but this time it was strained, “You sound like my husband.” She straightened herself up and picked her hem up this time, “The pressing matter concerns my daughter, Severus.” She stepped away, towards the doors, “As you know, Bloodstone Witches are a powerful lot, but their power is what comes with a curse. They’re destined to always become Seers.” She frowned then, “Every Bloodstone Witch becomes gifted with the Sight at an early age.”</p><p> </p><p>Emotions flashed through Severus’ eyes, but his face hid it well, “So all this time, you’ve known everything?” He didn’t know what to feel at that moment.</p><p> </p><p>“I was an anomaly, Severus.” Willow said sadly, “My Sight is to remember the past, and sometimes that can be as much as a curse as seeing the future.” She kept quiet as she said it, looking anywhere but him. “I always see things I couldn’t stop, no matter how hard I wish I could have.”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa covered her mouth with her hand, moving to take Willow’s side. “Her daughter is an unregistered Seer, Severus. She’s afraid to be exposed and doesn’t trust anyone outside of her own family. We want you to hide her Sight.”</p><p> </p><p>Willow folded her hands together, “She’s seen far too much for her age, no one should have to see their father die twice.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus swallowed thickly, now understanding the dire importance of the situation. “No, they shouldn’t.” He said simply, stepping forward. “May I ask, how did he die?”</p><p> </p><p>Willow looked down, resuming to pick up her hem and leading him down the hallway. “I…rather not say…” Her voice wavered as she said it, the woman keeping face for now. “She stopped speaking after it had happened, and she’s afraid to leave the manor. She doesn’t wish to see anything else, and tries to avoid it.”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa followed her, and Severus calmly walked behind. Suddenly he understood the morose music that was playing over them, how devastating it was and what the girl must have felt. “My condolences, I will do what I can for your daughter. There are ways to remove visions, most are temporary, but potions taken on a daily schedule can give her a normal life.”</p><p> </p><p>Willow smiled at that, stopping before the library doors and slowly opening them. Her eyes widened slightly at what she saw, and Narcissa’s breath hitched.</p><p> </p><p>All the books were off their shelves, stacked up high and creating walls, forming a small labyrinth before them.</p><p> </p><p>Severus glanced at Willow, “How old is she again?”</p><p> </p><p>“Five.” Willow breathed.</p><p> </p><p>Severus nodded, stepping into the room towards the labyrinth. Willow stepped out to follow him but Narcissa held onto her arm, “He’s okay.” She reassured the other quietly.</p><p> </p><p>The book labyrinth wasn’t hard to maneuver through, but it was the mere fact that this girl was able to utilize all of the books in the library to make a small barrier between herself and the rest of the room was something that stuck with Severus. The untapped power of a Bloodstone Witch was just that, raw power. He still had moments when he couldn’t believe witches like these existed in the world. He tried to make sense of it one day, tried to learn more about the Bloodstone family, only to discover something deeply troubling and horrible, the family carrying their fair share of dark secrets. How these women were actually cursed with the power they now possess was the sad conclusion to the story. It took him two years to realize that the little girl who attempted so many times to befriend him wasn’t just a name with great power behind it, but a lonely girl who craved something more than what she was expected to do.</p><p> </p><p>Now that lonely girl was a beautiful woman, who had just lost the love of her life and wished to protect her progeny. A five-year-old girl who witnessed tragedy far too early in her life and was trying to hide from the world because of it.</p><p> </p><p>She was sat on a chair, her violin floating off to the side and playing the music she was used to. The girl was curled up listening to her own music when Severus stepped around the corner. Her eyes snapped open then, and the music came to an abrupt halt. The two of them stared at each other for a moment, Severus approaching her like a frightened animal.</p><p> </p><p>Judith calmly reached for her violin to hold it close to her small form, her stare unwavering as she searched his face for anything deceptive.</p><p> </p><p>“Your mother told me that you have a problem.” He began, keeping a good small distance to be safe. “I’m able to seal that problem away.”</p><p> </p><p>The small girl stilled, blinking once curiously and setting her violin aside. She looked like she wanted to say something, but had difficulty trying to muster up the courage to do so.</p><p> </p><p>Severus chanced another step forward, thinking quickly. His eyes fell onto the violin and he gestured towards it, “You’re quite talented for your age. Did your mother teach you?”</p><p> </p><p>Judith glanced at the violin and ran her fingers across the strings, shaking her head at the question.</p><p> </p><p>“Your father, then?”</p><p> </p><p>The girl nodded, picking the violin up and turning it around to expose the other side. There was an etching on the bottom of the instrument, carved out and lacquered. Severus took that as a gesture to come forward, closing the gap between them and inspecting the violin. The name etched in said Judah Feinberg.</p><p> </p><p>“Judah…” Severus repeated, “Is that your name?” He looked at her for an answer, the girl watching him quietly. She nodded slowly.</p><p> </p><p>“Judith. I was named after my grandfather.” She said it quietly, like a whisper. “He taught my father, and my father taught me.”</p><p> </p><p>He quirked his lips up amusedly, “I was told you don’t speak at all.” He said lightly, chuckling when she went red from the words and ducked her head. He took another chance and moved to pat her head.</p><p> </p><p>The brief touch made Judith’s eyes fly open wide, as if it triggered something. Severus recoiled his hand when it happened but Judith’s own hands flew out to grab his, staring at him in alarm as if she had just witnessed something only she could see. Severus watched her warily, glancing down to the small hands holding onto his like they were grasping desperately for an answer.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you…see something?” He questioned softly.</p><p> </p><p>Judith nodded, her eyes tearing up before she wiped them away on her arm. She let go of him after that, grabbing her violin and sliding off the chair. When she made sure she had her violin secured she reached for his hand again to lead him out of the book labyrinth.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t something Willow expected to see, her own daughter holding a stranger’s hand and leading him out of her own hiding place. She grasped Narcissa’s hand as Judith brought Severus over to her, a small smile gracing her features for the first time in months.</p><p> </p><p>“Invite him to supper,” Judith said to her mother, still in a quiet voice, but it was enough to make Willow break out in fresh tears, her hand covering her mouth as she outright cried.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa chuckled, “Severus, you’ve gotten the girl to talk.”</p><p> </p><p>Judith went red again, finally letting go of the man with embarrassment.</p><p> </p><p>“Uncle Severus!” Draco’s voice broke through the moment, the blonde boy running through the door with Kitty at his side. The girl stopped quickly, her eyes widening at the sight of Severus.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco I didn’t know you knew a vampire!” She said loudly in amazement.</p><p> </p><p>The comment made Draco fight down a laugh while Judith glared heatedly at her sister. Severus folded his arms, trying to look a little more imposing right at the moment.</p><p> </p><p>“You must be the twin.” He drawled.</p><hr/><p>

  <em> 1971 </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It was a shock to see the throngs of students sitting in the Great Hall, for all the first years, it was their moment. They were under the proverbial spotlight. The only ones who didn’t look all to bothered were the Blacks, who seemed pretty sure of their own future when it came down to the sorting ceremony. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow stood near the back of the first years, frightened out of her mind. She didn’t want to become a Slytherin, it only meant her future with Lucius was set for life. She could see him from the Slytherin table, his cold eyes on hers. Willow wanted nothing more than to wither away and die, perhaps become a ghost. She could join the likes of the Grey Lady or Nearly Headless Nick, anything sounded better than— </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> A hand on her shoulder made her jump, her voice tumbling out as she jolted her head towards the owner of the hand. There stood Sirius Black, the only member of the Black Family that treated her like she was an actual person. He was grinning at her nervousness. “You look quite the fright, Weeping Willow.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Weeping Willow, her nickname. Never cry too many times in front of Sirius Black, or suddenly you’re stuck with a horrible nickname for life. Willow brushed a tear away from her face and fumbled with her school robes. “I’m afraid. Why are you grinning so much? Aren’t you afraid? We’re about to be sorted.” She whispered. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Willow, you’re talking to me here, I’m not afraid of anything.” Sirius winked at her, “Plus I have a bloody fool-proof plan to get myself sorted in the right house.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow’s eyes widened, “You…you do? Please, tell me. I really don’t want to be a Slytherin.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> He squeezed her shoulder, the grin turning serious. “I’m sure of it, you and I, us lot has to stick together, Willow. All you gotta do is—“ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Black, Sirius.” McGonagall’s voice called out his name. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow stared at Sirius, moving to cling to his robes, “What do I have to do?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Sirius smiled brightly, leaning in to whisper into her hair, “Just tell the hat where you want to go.” He said before parting quickly to step forward, taking his seat with a determined smirk. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow clutched her cloak, recalling his words, again and again, when the hat finally belted out GRYFFINDOR, the room let out an audible gasp. Pureblood children were glaring at Sirius, but the boy in question didn’t look bothered at all, throwing a wink Willow’s way as he strutted over towards his table. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Bloodstone, Willow,” Minerva announced to the crowd, eliciting whispers from the tables. Willow took a steady breath and looked over at Lily, receiving a supportive smile as Severus just stared at her wearily. She stepped over to the chair and sat down, shutting her eyes. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Oh my, oh my, a new Bloodstone Witch before me. Why you’re quite different indeed, but I can tell you that Slytherin can very well make you thrive…” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I don’t want it.” She whispered, “My friend said I can tell you where I want to go, and I don’t want Slytherin at all.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Anything but Slytherin, eh? Well, that’s quite…intriguing. A Bloodstone Witch like you would do well anywhere, but you’re a talented and honest sort, I believe you may have a better future in HUFFLEPUFF!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow’s eyes snapped open to loud gasps, but her mind wasn’t on the stricken faces of the purebloods around her. Her eyes fell towards Sirius, a big smile blossoming on her face as she jolted up from her seat and moved to join her fellow housemates. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She barely got to the table before her foot caught over her hem and she face-planted into the floor. </em>

  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Twice a month Severus Snape visited Bloodstone Manor to deliver Judith’s potion regimen, but his visits never stopped just there, not after the second month. With her visions hindered, Judith began to change. She became curious, more vocal. After Severus would arrive she’d ask him to stay, proceeding to request that he teach her about the very potion she was taking. It escalated from there, mostly because of Judith’s attention towards Severus. Willow invited him to stay longer over the summer, offering to pay him for his services. He refused every time she offered, mostly because he didn’t find Judith as bothersome as his students. No, he found her quite challenging, an intelligent girl that craved to learn what she could from him. In time, Kitty came around to request the same thing, growing fond of Severus’ presence because of how her sister was so receptive to him in general.</p><p> </p><p>Within a matter of weeks, Severus was soon teaching the Bloodstone twins and Narcissa’s son, Draco, as the boy never left Kitty’s side, nor Kitty his. The two children were attached to the hip, often looking for adventure or trying to beat each other at Wizard’s chess. Kitty often challenged him with the regular muggle version, as he would beat her so often at the Wizarding version that she wished to level the playing field. It wasn’t entirely that different, but she ended up winning every muggle version.</p><p> </p><p>It was the beginning of autumn when Severus had to return to Hogwarts, putting a standstill on Judith, Kitty and Draco’s tutoring. Judith reacted the most to Severus’ absence, carrying around potions books to read so she could impress him whenever he decided to return.</p><p> </p><p>It was during winter when Lucius found out about his wife’s secret friendship, a week after the Twins’ birthday when Willow was outside Malfoy Manor helping Draco and Kitty build a snow fort. Narcissa was sitting in the library with Judith, reading the birthday present that Severus had gotten for the girl. <em> One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi</em>, a book that Judith loved at the moment.</p><p> </p><p>“What is that girl doing inside my home?” His voice sounded enraged, but strained as if he was holding himself back. Narcissa stilled at the sight of her husband at the door, staring scathingly at the small child in her lap.</p><p> </p><p>Judith became aware of Lucius instantly, freezing in place and looking up at Narcissa. The way she looked told Judith everything she needed to know.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay…” Narcissa whispered down at her, but Judith didn’t believe her voice, glaring at Lucius as he stepped further into the room.</p><p> </p><p>“I want that child OUT—“</p><p> </p><p>“Lucius!” Narcissa raised her voice quickly, but Judith was faster, and suddenly there was a wall of books between Lucius and the rest of the room.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius pushed on the wall. It didn’t move a bit, he took his wand out and tried to disperse the books but to no avail. His anger was growing as he tried, again and again, to spell the books away.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa stepped away from the settee, taking Judith’s hand. “She’ll tear them down when you stop making a scene!” She told him.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius placed his hand on the wall in exasperation, glaring at the magic that separated him from his wife. It was all that child’s doing, the small Bloodstone Witch with her incredible power. He breathed out slowly, trying to think. His wife had been harboring the very people that he forbid her from conversing with, which meant his son had probably befriended them as well. He willed himself to calm down, trying to think of some way to get around this.</p><p> </p><p>He tapped the book wall thoughtfully, pulling on a small grin. There was a coat of arms on the mantle, she could have very well used the weapons against him instead of making a bloody wall of books, but she didn’t. The girl was protecting Narcissa. Protecting her from <em>him</em>. He kept that in mind.</p><p> </p><p>The books began to fall away carefully as Judith calmed down, settling back to where they came from and exposing Lucius Malfoy. She kept a hold of Narcissa’s dress, hidden behind the woman as she gazed up at the blonde man.</p><p> </p><p>He regarded her silently, taking in her likeness. Such a small girl with that amount of power meant many things, and he couldn’t imagine how powerful she could be when she was older. She could easily prove rivals with the Dark Lord, perhaps she could overthrow him. That was a horrible thought to have, but it felt so tempting. Should he befriend this girl, perhaps aide in her growth, she could become the answer he was looking for.</p><p> </p><p>For that thought to happen, he would need to swallow his pride, which wasn’t something he usually did.</p><p> </p><p>“She doesn’t speak, does she?” Lucius finally spoke up, gesturing to Judith.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa relaxed some, smiling slightly at her husband, “She’s had a traumatic life, Lucius. She’s just started letting me in.”</p><p> </p><p>He nodded, glancing back to the doors, “Where is my son?”</p><p> </p><p>She pursed her lips, “He’s playing with Katherine in the garden, Willow’s watching over their activity.”</p><p> </p><p>He swallowed the words he was about to say, still keeping his eyes on the small girl. “I see.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah—Lucius.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius turned around, his eyes falling onto Willow, his once betrothed. His breath caught in his throat as he finally saw her, from her soft green eyes down to her thick auburn curls. She looked just like the girl he grew up with. The girl that disgraced him at the altar.</p><p> </p><p>He forced himself to look away. “Willow.”</p><p> </p><p>Judith finally separated from Narcissa, running towards her mother and giving Lucius a wide berth as she passed him. Willow picked her up and kissed the girl’s cheek. “I see you’ve met my child.”</p><p> </p><p>Even after all this time she was still a stunning presence before him. Lucius clenched his teeth together and stayed silent, only relaxing when Narcissa stopped at his side and slid her arms around his right. “How long has this been going on?” He questioned.</p><p> </p><p>“About six months, dear.” Narcissa sounded calm as she said it, “Draco just adores little Katherine, and Judith adores Severus.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius looked at her incredulously, “Severus knows as well?”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa leaned closer to him, whispering, “Yes and don’t say anything to him, I’m working on a match.” She winked playfully.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius finally looked back at Willow, forcing a neutral expression instead of a sneer.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Swallow your pride, Lucius. </em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>It spoke volumes about how much Lucius loved his wife if he allowed someone he hated more than anything enter his own private home and allow her children to play with his son. Narcissa took Lucius’ neutral stand on the matter of Willow Bloodstone to be acceptance of his wife’s friendship with the woman, but in reality, he wanted nothing more than to scream at the woman who left him at the altar all those years ago for a muggle vagabond.</p><p> </p><p>It spoke multitudes of his own restraint every time he arrived back into his home and realized that Willow was in the drawing-room, looking like an Earthly goddess, chatting it up with his own lovely wife, who looked just as stunning or even better. Instead of bidding the woman a good afternoon, he would retreat to his private study instead, holding himself inside the room until the woman and her offspring had returned to their own home.</p><p> </p><p>It spoke vast reaches when Severus would come over to give the young Bloodstone witch a puzzle book only to spend time with Willow and become absorbed into a conversation with the woman when Lucius had never seen him so vastly interested in any other female other than Lily Evans-Potter for all the years that he had known the man. Lucius was bewildered at the sight, and wondered just in what looking glass did he fall through in order for Willow Bloodstone to become good friends with Severus Snape and Narcissa Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>He tried not to let it bother him, the constant visits and her daughter’s growing attachment to Draco. The boy was smitten with Kitty, he knew instantly. It was as if time was repeating itself, and this time it was Draco that would be entranced by the wiles of a Bloodstone Witch. It would only end in heartbreak for his son, and he took it upon himself to take Draco aside to warn him about the girl.</p><p> </p><p>Word got back to Willow, it seemed.</p><p> </p><p>She found him in his study, her eyes alight with fire and looking furious. “My daughter came to me in tears, saying that Draco accused her of deceiving him!”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius cast a bored stare in her direction, narrowing his eyes above the newspaper he was reading, “I shouldn’t warn my son about the dangers of getting involved with one of yours? I think it’s my duty as a father to tell my son before he falls in the same trap I had fallen in.”</p><p> </p><p>Willow stepped further into the room and shut the door, pointing to lay a silencing charm. “If you wish to be petty and vindictive, take it out on me. Do not bring our children into your personal vendetta. You don’t like that I’m here, do you?”</p><p> </p><p>“What gave you that idea, Willow? I’m overjoyed at your presence.” He said flatly with an irritated edge to his voice, flipping the page slowly. “Forgive me if I’m not rolling out the red carpet for your arrival.” He spat.</p><p> </p><p>Willow tried her damndest not to get any angrier, waving her hand to her face and pacing the room. “I didn’t go to Narcissa first, just so you know. She came to me, she held the olive branch. I know the sight of me isn’t easy to take, given what happened between us…”</p><p> </p><p>He continued to avoid her face by reading the paper, “There had to be an us to begin with, Willow. There was no ‘us’, there was never an ‘us’. Do you understand what you put me through?”</p><p> </p><p>Emotion flooded her features and realization dawned in her eyes, and she clasped her hands together. Of course! She was so wrapped up in her own future that she forgot about how he would feel. She suddenly discovered her misdeed, having left Lucius Malfoy at the altar with no warning or care. “Lucius, I… I feel like I need to make amends.” She said softly, “Everything that I was going through at the time, and I suddenly ran off with Daniel…I never thought about your feelings at all, Lucius. I should have at least come back that night to tell you properly.”</p><p> </p><p>He finally folded the paper up to look at her, “After all these years, it takes you just this instant to realize your mistake?” His voice rose gradually. “You’ve disappeared, Willow. You up and apparated to some seedy muggle pub and for hours I was standing there at the altar wondering what has happened!” He swatted the paper against the seat as he stood, dropping it. “Cygnus Black was the one to tell me what had happened to you, how a muggle tricked him into a fistfight and humiliated him and how you ran off with the man while <em>laughing</em>! You didn’t just sully your own family name that night Willow, you sullied mine!” He was shouting now, “It’s with the grace of all that is holy that I’ve been given a second chance and I was blessed to be given Narcissa, especially after the HELL you’ve put me through!”</p><p> </p><p>She endured his yelling, tearing up as she listened to him. She forgot all about him that night, all about what he may have been going through. She just left without a care, in love with a man she just met. She never second-guessed herself. “I understand why you hate me, Lucius. I understand all of it. You didn’t deserve what I have done to you, you never asked for it and you never saw it coming.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop that.” Lucius glared at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop what, Lucius?” Her voice was trembling.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop with…<em> that </em> !” He gestured towards her being, “You’ve always done that! You’ve always taken the high ground, you’ve always admitted when you were wrong. Why can’t you just be like any other witch, Willow? Why do you have to be so bloody <em> understanding</em>? Sweet Circe, you’re the most infuriating woman I’ve ever met!”</p><p> </p><p>If anything, that made Willow cry harder, and she suddenly lunged herself into Lucius’ arms. The wizard stumbled back, his arms outstretched awkwardly as she cried against his shoulder. He didn’t know what to do at the moment, glaring at nothing in particular before slowly moving his hand to pat her back.</p><p> </p><p>“If I could do it over again, Lucius, I’d let you down easily. I wouldn’t leave you so angry for so many years!” She whimpered between breaths, “I deeply apologize—“</p><p> </p><p>“Alright!” He cried out, “Apology accepted for Merlin’s sake!” He finally pried her off of him, holding her back a bit and gazing down at her tear-streaked face. He kept staring until he found himself hating her all over again, but for another reason entirely.</p><p> </p><p>Willow Bloodstone was making it hard for him to hate her.</p><hr/><p>

  <em> The two boys were panting, adrenaline running through their veins as they broke through the passageway. James kept a firm Grip on Severus’ arm, dragging him through the halls in a panic, looking for her telltale curls. She’d be up tonight, as she was a prefect.

</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> He caught Willow Bloodstone on the first floor, and James’ face broke into relief. “Willow!” He called out, not caring if he had awoken the paintings around him. Snape was still following, but in too much pain to say anything, still in shock over what had just happened. </em>

  <em> He was nearly mauled to death by a werewolf. It was Lupin, and James Bloody Potter saved him from certain death.

  <em> Willow’s curls floated as she whirled around with wide green eyes, her vision picking up on Severus’ pale and stricken features before realizing who was with him. “Severus!” She gasped out, closing the distance between them. “What in Heaven’s name?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> James was still panicking, thinking fast. His mind was on Remus at the moment, now that he had gotten Snape to safety. Willow actually gave a damn about Snape, which he didn’t understand. “He needs to visit Madam Pomfrey, quickly. Please, I have to go—tell her he went to the Shrieking Shack, she’ll understand.” He let go of Snape after that, giving her a rushed smile before breaking out into a run the direction he came in. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow opened her mouth to call after James but shut it again, her eyes trailing back to Severus’ state, noticing the blood on his robes and gasping again, “You’re bleeding, Severus!” She took his other arm, as it was his shoulder that was bleeding. “Come on, let’s take you to the infirmary.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Severus tried to pull his arm back, the shock of everything finally leaving him. “I’m fine.” He said stubbornly. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The girl refused to release him, leading him toward the hospital wing, “You’re definitely not fine, Severus. Please, let me try to help you.” Her voice was soothing and kind, something that he still didn’t understand. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow was a girl that was out of his league, a powerful Bloodstone Witch that was betrothed to the Malfoy heir, and yet she treated Severus Snape with a compassion that he never wanted nor deserved. It was because she was friends with Lily, that was all. If Lily never befriended her all those years ago on that train she would never look at him twice. He couldn’t understand her at all, and he didn’t want to. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Severus tried again to yank his arm back. “Unhand me, Bloodstone!” He practically shouted it out, glaring at her heatedly. “I do not need or want your bloody help!” He hissed out. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow only stopped to look at him with those big eyes of her, the same shade as Lily’s, but they weren’t Lily’s green at all. No, she’d never be Lily. “Severus…” She tried again. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Severus turned around and headed back down the corridor, leaving Willow standing there as he headed off in the direction of the dungeons. He winced slightly when his arm moved a certain way, looking quickly at the injury seeping through his robes. He could mend that himself, he didn’t need to go to Pomfrey. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> He had just about enough humiliation for tonight. </em>

  <br/>
</p><p>Whenever Severus stopped by Bloodstone Manor he made sure to owl her the Friday before. It had become a habit for him to do so, as he didn’t want to catch her out of sorts. The monthly visits for Judith’s potions slowly turned into weekly visits even after the school year started. He didn’t understand the attraction, the fact that he wanted to correspond with a woman he once hated as a teenager. He found her to be a lovely breath of fresh air outside of those he usually spoke to, despite her perchance for tripping on her own dress every so often. He further became stupefied at how charming the woman was becoming, and how he didn’t really loathe her optimism under her own dreadful circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>Even after two years of visiting this woman, his fascination with Willow Bloodstone was still quite fresh and new, a far cry to what it once had been.</p><p> </p><p>When he flooed in on Saturday morning in the year 1987, he was met with his favorite student. Judith was waiting patiently at the fireplace, her green eyes brightening at the sight of his presence. He couldn’t understand that, as well. How a child enjoyed his company and often followed him around and looked for his advice. He was never good with children, yet he’s garnered two that treated him with the respect he never thought he’d have.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s in the garden.” Judith said to him in a quiet voice, reaching out to take his hand.</p><p> </p><p>The manor was strangely quiet today, and he noticed that Judith’s eyes were wet, as if she’d been crying earlier. He also couldn’t hear the telltale sounds of Kitty and Draco running around and causing havoc. Something was wrong, his intuition told him.</p><p> </p><p>Severus looked down at the girl, kneeling down to look her eye to eye. “Did something happen, Judith?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>She nodded quietly, “It’s our anniversary.” She explained, her voice but a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Severus tried to think about what that meant, trying to recall similar events, remembering this day last year, but he never visited her then, she had declined back then. He took in the silence of the manor and the dry tears on Judith’s cheeks and suddenly everything clicked, because two years ago around this day, the Bloodstones have entered Great Britain.</p><p> </p><p>After <em>his </em>death.</p><p> </p><p>Realization etched in his features and Severus pursed his lips, watching the girl steadily. He reached out to pull Judith against him and hugged her tight, remembering what Willow had told him those years ago. How Judith had seen it all.</p><p> </p><p>The girl didn’t react how he thought she would, fighting against his arms until he let go. She looked frustrated and angry, “If anyone needs comfort it’s my mum, don’t waste it on me.” She cried out.</p><p> </p><p>Severus was taken aback by her sudden reaction, standing back up slowly and trying to read the girl before him. “Care to explain yourself? I would only think that you required a shoulder to cry on.”</p><p> </p><p>She teared up after that, but shied her eyes away. “I’ve shed more than enough tears for my father, but I’ve learned that tears won’t bring him back. I’ve come to accept what had happened, but it’s my mother who needs that shoulder more than me.” She looked back at him desperately. “My mother remembers everything, Mr. Snape. She remembers everything as if it was still happening, and she likes to pretend that she’s not hurting but she’s in more pain than me. It’s not me that needs comfort, it’s her.”</p><p> </p><p>That was the most he’s ever heard Judith speak, and by the look on her face, she was in complete anguish over her mother’s hurt. He glanced around, concerned. “Where’s Katherine?” He questioned then.</p><p> </p><p>Judith looked away, glaring down the hall. “She locked herself in her room with the photo album. Even though she tries not to show it, my sister was affected by everything as well.”</p><p> </p><p>He let out a sigh, raking his fingers through his hair and nodding in understanding. “Take me to your mother.” He said then.</p><p> </p><p>Judith led him through the house to the back doors, stopping just before the door and pointing him towards the gazebo. Severus stepped out into the garden, hearing a faint song. It was a muggle folk song that wavered in volume, the source of the song coming from the gazebo near the hedges. Willow was curled up at a corner, her arms hugging her knees with her auburn curls draped over her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>Severus approached her like she was a scared deer, stopping at the edge of the gazebo and watching her stare off at nothing in particular. It was then that he realized he didn’t know the details about his death, how it happened or just why it scarred Judith so badly to make her go completely silent. He didn’t know anything beyond what Willow had told him.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> …Whisper words of wisdom, let it be… </em>” Willow’s voice broke at the end and her eyes welled up with more tears, her hand brushing them away while she turned her head, practically jolting in shock over Severus’ presence. “S-Severus—“ Her voice cracked, but she did her best to wipe the tears away and try to make it look like she wasn’t just crying her eyes out. “How long have you been here?”</p><p> </p><p>He slowly stepped into the gazebo, “Your daughter told me where to go.” He eased himself on the bench and patted the seat next to him. “Why didn’t you inform me that today wasn’t a good day?”</p><p> </p><p>Willow pulled on a pained smile, sniffling. “I…I just thought I would be able to endure it.” She didn’t get up, staying where she was. “I guess I’m not as strong as I thought I was.”</p><p> </p><p>He let out a sigh, shaking his head. “Willow… what about Cissy, have you informed her?”</p><p> </p><p>She looked away, “I told her I needed time alone, just as Kitty begged me to disinvite Draco.” She fell silent for a beat and hesitantly looked back at him, “I apologize for inconveniencing you today, Severus.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a grieving woman, Willow, you’re allowed to do what you have to. You’re not inconveniencing me either. I had nothing special planned.” He got back up and closed the distance between them, adjusting his robes before sitting down next to her. “It seems like you need me today, nonetheless.”</p><p> </p><p>Willow tried to smile, but it fell away before she could. “I would never wish what I have on anyone, Severus. Every single time I wish to forget, it plays out in my mind like I just lived it. His passing, my daughter’s cries, everything sounds so fresh…like I’m losing him all over again.”</p><p> </p><p>He leaned back against the structure, finding her eyes, “You’ve never told me, how he died.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman took a shaky breath, shutting her eyes and instantly regretting it. “It…was so sudden… I was in the kitchen, trying to make bread. Daniel was in Judith’s room reading to her, it was one of those history books that his father had given him. She loved to read, but loved it more when Daniel read with her. When it happened, I heard Judith screaming, a loud thud, like someone fell. I ran into the room to see what had happened and Judith was trying to perform CPR on Daniel, crying and begging him to wake up. I…” She brushed away fresh tears, her voice cracking again. “I had to grab her and force her out of the room because she fought against me, she kept screaming that she didn’t want to leave his side. Kitty, oh my dear, sweet Kitty, she was the only one who held it together, called the ambulance and tried to calm Judith down. I think that’s what hurt Judith the most, the way Kitty wasn’t crying like she was, like how I was…” Willow took a moment to breathe, finding trouble with the words.</p><p> </p><p>Severus reached out to take her hand, “Don’t push yourself.” He whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Willow shook her head, “A week later we buried him beside his father, and it was then I felt the magic pulling me. The wards were summoning me back to Bloodstone Manor… it only meant one thing, that my parents have died. Mother…she created strong blood runes on the manor to keep her family tethered, and I was forced to take my girls back here. Severus, my mother was a cruel and heartless woman. She wouldn’t have taken my marriage to Daniel without a response. I only discovered it while cleaning out their bedroom, they kept so many dark artifacts, and… their last act of love was to curse Daniel to die when my mother did, and my parents poisoned themselves.” She couldn’t take it anymore, moving closer to Severus to sob on his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t expect that, but at the same time he did, and he hesitantly held her as she wept, feeling the tears soak through his robes. He could feel the lump in his throat that threatened to choke him, recalling everything she just told him and shutting his eyes in sympathetic despair. This wasn’t just a death, it was a murder, her husband was taken from her and her children over a petty vengeance. He suddenly regretted ever asking her about the death, because all it did was repeat itself in Willow’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>If she remembered everything, then…</p><p> </p><p>Severus could feel his heart hammering in his chest over the implication. She remembered <em>everything</em>, every moment, every second. She remembered Hogwarts, she remembered Lily, she remembered Potter and Black and, that one thing he never wished to recall. She remembered him, how he treated her, how he outright denied her friendship on many occasions.</p><p> </p><p>She remembered their first meeting and how he wanted her gone.</p><p> </p><p>She remembered when Potter rescued him and tried to get her to take him to the infirmary.</p><p> </p><p>She even remembered their last moment together, by the lake, when he was…</p><p> </p><p>Why was this woman pouring her soul to someone who hated her for seven years? Why was he visiting her so much when they weren’t even friends to begin with? Why did he feel so attracted to this woman the way he once did Lily—</p><p> </p><p>He stopped thinking after that, continuing to hold her as her sobbing lessened and eventually stopped entirely. They sat there in silence, the kind of silence that was horrible for thinking and something he didn’t want to venture further. The question, however, was still <em>there</em>, still over his head like a beacon.</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you so kind to me?” He finally asked, hoping to break the silence that threatened his thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>Willow was leaning against his chest now, finding a strange sort of comfort in her current position. She could smell the scent of sulfur entwined in his robes and it somehow soothed her. She thought about his question for a while, humming softly.</p><p> </p><p>“Because Judith trusts you.” She answered in a whisper. “Severus, my daughter doesn’t trust just anyone. The only one she’s ever let so close to her is her father. However, every time she sees you…she becomes talkative, she becomes happy. She follows you around like she once did Daniel. She completely trusts you, and it means more than you think it does.” She finally looked up at him, into his black eyes. “Yes, you…hated me…once…but if you still hated me now, you wouldn’t have gone out of your way to help my daughter seal away her Sight. I also believe that people can change, Severus, and you’re nowhere near the troubled boy I remember.”</p><p> </p><p>They went quiet again, but this time it was different. Her words had some sort of warmth in them, something that embraced Severus like a blanket of kindness. It must have been her magic, if he had to guess. The same way that Kitty liked to shock people and Judith enjoyed hovering books, Willow was literal sunshine that enveloped everyone with warmth. He began to wonder just why he hated this girl to begin with, why he rejected her countless advances to get to know him. He must have been bewildered by her in general, how someone who didn’t know him at all wished to honestly become his friend. Back then he was too obsessed with Lily and the Dark Arts to even pay her any attention, or actually trust that this one Hufflepuff prefect was being sincere.</p><p> </p><p>Willow was a woman that was always sincere. She was kind and understanding and believed in the good in others. She encompassed the Light in so many ways while he was the primal antithesis. What was it that made someone as pure as Willow look for friendship in someone as dark as himself?</p><p> </p><p>He couldn’t find an answer, not just yet.</p><p> </p><p>Severus had all day to look for one, however, as Willow fell asleep against his chest.</p><p> </p><p>Something about that didn’t really bother him like it should.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>

  <br/>
</p><p>She met them at Zonko’s Joke Shop in the year of 1988, the two of them staring at the display in the back with concentration as they took in everything that was available. Kitty found herself staring at the two ginger-haired boys with her own fixed interest as they conversed with themselves about specific pranks to be played on little brothers and how much of what they needed for when. After about what seemed like an eternity, a grin formed on Kitty’s face, a teasing thought haunting her mind as she reached out towards the two of them, throwing an electric shock their way and quickly hiding behind one of the vertical display cases.</p><p> </p><p>The twins stopped what they were doing quickly, looking at each other with wide eyes after the shock passed through them. They looked around curiously, wondering where exactly the shock came from, only to shrug and resume what they were doing.</p><p> </p><p>Kitty clasped her hands over her mouth, peering out to look back at the two and reaching out to do it again, biting down a sudden giggle that tried to force through her lips and resuming her hiding place. She continued to fight down the giggles that erupted from her gut, managing to calm herself before ducking out to look at the twins again. She instantly frowned, seeing that they weren’t there at all. Cautiously, Kitty crept out of her hiding place and stepped towards the back wall, her eyes sweeping all over and finding no trace of them.</p><p> </p><p>“Caught you!” Fred said aloud, suddenly behind her, and taking her shoulders as she jumped from the sudden voice. “Forge, I found her!” He called out to his twin, grinning and removing his hands from her shoulders as he practically cornered her.</p><p> </p><p>Kitty felt a wave of nervousness she had to fight down as the second twin moved to complete the circle, and she managed to smile at the two of them. “You caught me.” She agreed sheepishly.</p><p> </p><p>“Now tell us, what were you using?” Fred continued, quirking a brow.</p><p> </p><p>“We want whatever you zapped us with.” George finished, folding his arms.</p><p> </p><p>Their curiosity made her confidence grow again and she had to fight down another giggle. “I didn’t use anything.” She held up a hand and wiggled her fingers, pointing at them and sending another zap. The twins jumped when it happened, their eyes widening.</p><p> </p><p>“Wicked!” They both chimed out, “Not even we can control our magic that well yet. What are you?” Fred asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Could you teach us how to do that?” George followed.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll pay you if we have to!” Fred insisted.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not something I can teach!” Kitty began, grinning wide by now. “I’ve always been able to do this, it’s part of me. I just wanted to get your attention.”</p><p> </p><p>George grinned as well, “It worked out perfectly!”</p><p> </p><p>Fred couldn’t help but grin also, “It was a shocking introduction, to say the least. Now, who are you? We would have remembered someone like you stalking Diagon Alley.”</p><p> </p><p>“She sounds American, Gred.” George said to his brother.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s an American doing all the way here?” Fred questioned.</p><p> </p><p>They cast her questionable stares, mirroring their postures as they waited for Kitty to answer them. She only giggled, again, unable to stop herself now. “I was born in America, yes, but I lived here since I was five. I live in Wiltshire.”</p><p> </p><p>The two of them fixed scrutinizing stares and quickly exchanged glances with each other before looking back at her curiously.</p><p> </p><p>“The only wizards who live in Wiltshire are stuck-up old pureblood families. You don’t even act the part, girlie.” Fred explained.</p><p> </p><p>“Just who are you?” George looked dumbstruck.</p><p> </p><p>Kitty wished she could stop giggling because it was making her nervous. She couldn’t help it, however, like it was an instant reaction to their presence. She managed to settle herself down before offering both her hands to them, “I’m Kitty Bloodstone, pleased to meet you.”</p><p> </p><p>The twins took her hands, smiling back at her. Fred tipped his head and George followed. “Well, Miss Bloodstone, a pleasure to meet you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m Fred Weasley.” George announced, grinning.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m George Weasley.” Fred said then, giving her a comical bow. It was only a split second later when Fred froze in mid-pose, and George wasn’t far off from doing the same, both of them looking back at her slowly as they mouthed her surname.</p><p> </p><p>“Bloody hell.” Fred tore his gaze away to look at his brother, “It’s her, innit?”</p><p> </p><p>George nodded, completely dumbstruck, “That explains the—“ He extended his finger and did a zapping motion.</p><p> </p><p>Kitty watched them as they mulled through the sudden realization of the Bloodstone surname, curiously smiling as they stared at each other as if they were speaking with their minds. The two of them finally broke out into twin grins, laughing at something they only knew. Kitty had an idea of what was going through their minds because she was used to the reaction. Living for two years in Wizarding Britain gave her a myriad of mixed reactions to her surname itself. Judith hated those reactions, but Kitty loved them.</p><p> </p><p>“What else can you do?” They both asked curiously.</p><p> </p><p>A smile formed on Kitty’s face after that, “I can tell you two apart if that counts.”</p><p> </p><p>The twins quirked their brows, glancing at each other doubtfully. “Prove it.”</p><p> </p><p>Kitty’s smile turned into a grin of her own, “Well, you told me you were Fred, and you were George.” She motioned to each of them specifically, “But that’s actually the opposite, isn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>George snickered and Fred took the challenge, folding his arms, “I don’t believe it, you just met us.”</p><p> </p><p>“You have no proof,” George said amusedly.</p><p> </p><p>“Actually, I do.” Kitty said confidently, “Because for ten minutes, I was watching you two look over all the pranks, and you,” She pointed at Fred, “was calling him <em> Georgie</em>, and you,” She pointed at George, “was calling him <em> Freddie</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Their jaws dropped after that, pointing at each other with dumbfounded expressions before breaking out into mirrored laughter. They clasped each other’s shoulders, laughing wholeheartedly for a moment before wiping tears from their eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re gonna love you, Kitty Bloodstone.” Fred finally said breathlessly.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>

  <br/>
</p><p>Draco Malfoy hated the Weasley twins.</p><p> </p><p>Ever since Kitty had come home from Diagon Alley, ever since Molly Weasley flooed into Bloodstone Manor to meet Willow, ever since the Weasley twins began visiting Kitty regularly, Draco has been fighting for Kitty’s attention and he absolutely <em> hated </em> it.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t belong to them. She belonged to <em>him</em>. She was <em>his </em>friend, not theirs. Kitty’s place was with him and no one else!</p><p> </p><p>No one could see his plight. No one understood why he was so annoyed. He went to his mother about it, to complain to her about his problem. She only told him one thing.</p><p> </p><p>“Kitty doesn’t belong to you, honey, despite her taste in friends, she’s allowed to choose who she wishes to spend time with.”</p><p> </p><p>Clearly, she didn’t understand the dire situation he was in. His mother meant well, but she couldn’t understand his situation. She had his father.</p><p> </p><p>Draco went to his father for help, and he actually got somewhere.</p><p> </p><p>“That family…” Lucius said irritably, “Son, your worries aren’t unfounded. If you wish to do away with the Weasley boys then you must do what you can to scare them off. I’m sure Katherine will understand why they’re unworthy of her friendship.”</p><p> </p><p>Scaring them off sounded like a fantastic plan, a great idea. However, that plan came with nagging feelings of doubt. If he scared them off, then he would hurt his dear friend in the process. His intention wasn’t to hurt her, but to warn the twins against stealing her away. His father’s proposal led him into a standstill, and Draco had to think long and hard about how to make her see her place.</p><p> </p><p>He thought about his parents, how his father would kiss his mother. A kiss meant something, did it? It meant that you belonged to them, it meant a lot of things, but the main thing was that it was a statement. You kissed someone that was yours, and if he kissed Kitty then she would finally understand that she was his.</p><p> </p><p>He needed to run his theory by someone who knew more, so he went to his godfather.</p><p> </p><p>“If I kiss Kitty will it make the Weasley twins go away?” He questioned seriously to the older man. Severus stopped chopping herbs for a moment to stare at the boy, quirking a brow in question.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you understand what a kiss means?” Severus asked simply, putting down the knife.</p><p> </p><p>Draco nodded enthusiastically, “A kiss means that you belong to someone, so if I kiss Kitty, then she’ll realize she belongs to me and tell them to go away.” He felt like his logic was sound as he explained it.</p><p> </p><p>Severus shook his head after hearing his godson’s reasonings. “Draco, ask me again when you’re older.” He said dismissively, verbally shutting down the conversation as he went back to chopping thyme.</p><p> </p><p>The next afternoon Draco was watching Kitty sit with the Weasley twins in the gazebo with a scowl on his face, hearing her giggle again at something one of them said. When she replied the two of them exchanged glances before kissing her on either side of her cheeks, stunning the girl into quiet shock.</p><p> </p><p>Yes, Draco <em>hated </em>the Weasley twins.</p><hr/><p>

  <em> 1975 </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> He was humiliated beyond anything he’s ever felt before, even Avery and Mulciber had a laugh at his expense. Severus did his damnedest not to cry, it would only further his embarrassment. He avoided students left and right, hearing their giggles and whispers as he ran up to the Gryffindor tower. Lily looked so disgusted with him, and he needed to take it back. If anything, losing Lily right now would be worse than what he just went through. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It was a pathetic sight, a lone Slytherin sitting in front of the Fat Lady pining for Lily Evans and having to endure being laughed at by whoever went in or left that blasted tower. He sat there for hours, but Lily refused to come out. It was nearly curfew now and Severus was forced to head back to the dungeons in his own despair, finally releasing the tears he was being threatened with for hours. No one was around to laugh at him now. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Severus managed to find a lonely alcove on the second floor so he could give in to the emotions, pain and excruciation cutting through him like blades and tearing him open to vulnerability. If anyone had caught him right now, he wouldn’t be able to bear the backlash, the shame. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> A hand on his shoulder frightened him more than it should have, and Severus’ breath caught in his throat. His head turned to see those damnable curls and the blasted prefect who belonged to them, the last person he wanted to see right now. She was probably here to finally add to the pain he was already feeling, humiliate him further and defend her muggleborn friend. He sneered at her defensively, getting ready for the backlash. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I’ve been looking everywhere for you.” Willow breathed, kneeling down next to him. “Severus—“ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Are you here to rub it in? I’m sure everyone in Hufflepuff is guffawing at what had happened!” He spat acidly. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow frowned, her eyes looking upon him with pity. “I saw everything, Severus.” She said in a whisper. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Shame flooded his own features, and he stared at her in shock. Of course, she would be there, she was always with Lily. She witnessed his fall, and now she was there to pass judgment. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow continued, tearing up as she spoke, “I tried to follow you when you left, but you ran off so fast! You didn’t deserve it, any of it. I had to take Remus aside and lecture him about being a proper Prefect. None of that should have happened, Severus!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> White-hot anger boiled through his veins the more she talked. He couldn’t glare at her any harder than he could. She was being sympathetic to him, she was understanding him. It was just like her, he thought bitterly, loathing how she stared at him with such pity in her eyes. It was disgusting and he didn’t want any of it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Please let me—“ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You’re pathetic.” Severus cut her off, finally standing up. “Go throw your pity on someone who deserves it, and stop pretending like you’re little miss goody-two-shoes when you’re not. I bloody hate you, everything about you!” He barked out, “Look to someone else for your bloody sympathy and LEAVE. ME. ALONE!” He finally shoved her back so he could get out from the alcove, refusing to look back as he ran off as fast as he could. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow watched him run, fresh tears flooding her eyes before she finally caved in and wept. </em>

</p><p>In December of 1990, Narcissa opened the door at the Bloodstone’s arrival. Kitty didn’t wait to greet her before darting in and yelling out for Draco as she shed her cloak and gloves, leaving her mother and Judith standing at the door, the smaller of the two holding a violin case tight in her arms with a stack of music sheets underneath.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa smiled at Judith, “You look well prepared for this evening.” She said amusedly.</p><p> </p><p>Judith tried a quick smile, uttering ‘thank you’ before stepping inside. Her hair was coated in sprinkles of snow, as was Willow’s thick curls. Willow stepped in and removed her gloves before taking off her cloak. “Happy Christmas.” She said with a smile lighting her features, “Is Lucius home as well?”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa summoned Dobby to take their cloaks and gloves, “He’s in the drawing-room, and I believe there are some gifts under the tree for your children.” She winked down at Judith, who only blushed in return. The girl nodded quietly and gathered her items, taking them into the drawing-room.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s been very busy these past few weeks.” Willow explained, “She was so determined on making a piece just for Severus.”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa chuckled, “Judith is a talented witch, I can’t wait to hear what she composed.” She led Willow into the drawing-room, where the other woman was scanning for the man in question.</p><p> </p><p>“Severus said he’ll be a little late,” Lucius spoke up before his wife, amused at Willow’s nervous smile. Narcissa and Lucius exchanged amused glances, the first of the two hiding a giggle behind her hand before sitting with Lucius.</p><p> </p><p>The fireplace roared suddenly and Willow jumped in her spot, turning towards it to see Severus step out of the floo. Willow felt nervous suddenly, looking away from him shyly and stepping away. She felt like she was back in Hogwarts, feeling old feelings that once weighed on her heart.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius stood up to greet his friend, taking his hand, “Happy Christmas, Severus. I see you managed to escape Hogwarts for tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>“Dumbledore was actually shocked that I had somewhere to be.” Severus mused, quirking a grin.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa rose to her feet to rush over to the man, intercepting him before he approached Willow, “I wish to have a word, Severus.” She said quickly, glancing towards Willow before leading Severus into an adjoining room. Severus watched Narcissa guardedly, as if she was up to something.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want?” He questioned, finally collecting his cloak. She was spelling the doors with silencing charms, and it made him suspicious.</p><p> </p><p>“I was only curious if you’ve given any thought to courting our dear friend Willow.” She said it as if it was a secret, quietly so no one else could hear.</p><p> </p><p>Severus sputtered immediately, staring at the woman incredulously, “Your husband took me aside months ago and he wasn’t as blatantly obvious about it as you’re being now. Have you two been discussing this behind my back?”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa quirked her head to the side, “Behind both your backs, Severus. I’m only asking you now because today is a special day, and it would be perfect—“</p><p> </p><p>Severus pinched the bridge of his nose, “Willow just lost her husband, Cissy. I am not that crass.”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa rolled her eyes, “Severus, that was five years ago. Haven’t you noticed the way she acts around you these past few months? It’s like you both are teenagers! Her daughters adore you, Severus, what other signs do you require?”</p><p> </p><p>The man took a steadying breath, glancing at the door quietly. “I’ve taken to them as well.” He eventually agreed, looking back at Narcissa, “How long have you been planning this union?” He questioned then.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa smiled innocently, “It’s best for us women to keep <em> some </em> secrets, Severus.” She stepped around him before placing her hands on his shoulder, nudging him to the door, “I suggest making a move now before anyone else decides to swoop in.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus rolled his eyes, stepping back out into the room. His eyes trailed over towards Willow, who was nursing a glass of wine and sitting alone on the settee.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa guided him towards Willow, “Severus please, sit. Judith has made something especially for you, a lovely Christmas gift.”</p><p> </p><p>As she was speaking Judith was at the family piano, finally looking up from her hidden spot and gathering her music sheets. She kept herself concentrated, making her way before everyone with her violin at her side. She set the sheets down before her, gazing at them and one by one pointing at them to make them float up to her eye level. Silently she waited for everyone to settle down before putting her violin onto her shoulder, closing her eyes briefly and breathing out a sigh before beginning to play.</p><p> </p><p>The music started out soft, a melodic tone that was shadowed in velvet darkness. The tone of the piece was deep and somber, dark and mysterious just like the person she made it for. In the middle, the music became intense and moody, louder and more dramatic until ending back into a softer lilt of sadness.</p><p> </p><p>When Judith was finished someone broke out into applause, the girl narrowing her eyes in her sister’s direction as Kitty broke the silence with her own cheers. Draco stood beside her, moving to silently clap along with her.</p><p> </p><p>Judith turned back towards the four adults, turning red as her mother joined in along with Narcissa, the applause coming at various degrees depending on who was doing it. Her gaze lingered on Severus, the only one who wasn’t applauding but giving her a silent nod of appreciation. Judith managed to smile at his reaction, finally releasing the spell to her sheets and letting them flutter to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Kitty giggled and cast her eyes on Draco, grinning and holding up a sprig of mistletoe. Draco looked back at her and had to do a double-take, staring at the small plant and looking back at Kitty with wide eyes. Kitty smiled again and moved to kiss his cheek quickly, stunning the boy before darting away and hiding behind the Christmas tree, peeking out as she had the mistletoe in her hands and using her finger to float it over Willow’s head.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa caught the sight of the mistletoe first, chuckling pleasantly and catching Lucius’ attention. The couple shared a secret grin that caught Willow’s eyes and had her looking around curiously before following their gaze upwards. Willow flushed darkly, a nervous giggle escaping her and catching Severus’ attention.</p><p> </p><p>“I believe it’s tradition,” Narcissa said playfully, causing Severus to look at his friend before turning his attention back to Willow, following her gaze upwards and zeroing in on the hovering sprig. He instantly looked for the culprit, hearing a smaller giggle from behind the Christmas tree and opening his mouth to say something.</p><p> </p><p>As he was doing that Willow was gathering up her nerve, tearing Severus’ focus away from finding Kitty as she moved her hand to brush against his own. Severus stared down at their hands and swallowed thickly, again hearing an amused chuckle and exhaling loudly, glaring at Lucius and Narcissa.</p><p> </p><p>“If I plan to bloody kiss her, then it’s going to be in private and away from prying eyes!” He cast his glare over towards Kitty after that.</p><p> </p><p>His reaction happened while Willow was in the midst of sipping her wine, his words having her inhaling sharply and accidentally coughing as the wine went down her windpipe instead. Severus quickly became attentive towards her and ushered the wine glass away, patting her back as she worked on breathing again without coughing.</p><p> </p><p>Heaven help him, he was in love with her.</p><hr/><p>

  <br/>
</p><p>It was amazing how much Willow had tripped over her own dress every time she went out to spend time with Severus, and it proved that she was as nervous as he was in their budding relationship. He never felt as if his heart could ever beat again after Lily.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing was without its pitfalls, however, as Severus was a damaged man who had his own regrets, and it managed to hinder their process. His overwhelming guilt for Lily’s death was what kept Severus from ever moving closer to Willow, and the two often gotten into verbal altercations because Willow desired to understand him and Severus thought he was a lost cause that couldn’t be saved.</p><p> </p><p>The closer they became the more he realized he had secrets that couldn’t be shared, such as his ties with the Death Eaters and Voldemort, his position with Dumbledore and the Order, his entire life he presented before Willow was a lie, posing as a Hogwarts professor that wasn’t anything but a Potions Master. However, the closer they became the more he didn’t want to leave her side.</p><p> </p><p>He couldn’t imagine pulling Willow Bloodstone into his life, to partake in his many dark secrets. He couldn’t put her through such pain and misery that may drive her to hate him.</p><p> </p><p>As much as he tried to keep his love affair with this woman a secret from everyone other than the Malfoys, it was always one person who knew everything, and during a routine meeting with Dumbledore, the old man didn’t waste any time to talk about it.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore was unwrapping one of his candies thoughtfully, humming to himself when he suddenly brought it up. “You have found love, haven’t you, Severus?”</p><p> </p><p>Blasted old codger, saying that right when Severus was sipping on his tea, effectively making the man choke on it as he did. He stared at Dumbledore wearily, “What gives you that idea?”</p><p> </p><p>The wizard met his eyes with his own twinkling ones, and a smile formed on his face. “You’ve been different for the past year. Little things, Severus, little things. For one, you have been <em> washing your hair </em>.” He chuckled knowingly.</p><p> </p><p>Severus rolled his eyes and looked away, “That means nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>“You have an added spring in your step, Severus.” Dumbledore countered, smiling, “And those eyes of yours don’t look as hollow and tired. Please, I would love to know who has captured your heart. Perhaps I can send her, <em> or him </em>, a gift basket.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sod off, old codger,” Snape said with an edge to his voice, folding his arms. “…I may be ending it soon, anyway.” He said softly.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore tilted his head to the side, “Severus, if this person is lifting you up from your woes why would you be driven to end it?”</p><p> </p><p>“You know very well why.” Severus snapped, “She doesn’t know what I’ve done. She hasn’t got a clue to the atrocities that I’ve committed!” He glared up towards the ceiling. “I…can't put her through that.”</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore closed his eyes, nodding solemnly, “Tell me, Severus, do you love her?”</p><p> </p><p>Severus went quiet for a moment, sighing. “I believe I do.”</p><p> </p><p>“Does she love you?” He questioned.</p><p> </p><p>A faint smile graced Severus’ features, “Sometimes I cannot believe it, but she does.”</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore sipped on his tea thoughtfully, smiling. “Then be honest with her.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus stared at the older man as if he grew a second head, “I can’t just—she’ll hate me! She’ll never wish to look at me again.”</p><p> </p><p>“A relationship thrives on trust and understanding, Severus Snape.” The old wizard said thoughtfully, “If she truly loves you, then none of it will matter. It’s best to dive in headfirst instead of regretting what could have been.”</p><p> </p><p>The conversation ended after that, but Dumbledore’s words resonated in his soul. Trust and understanding were something that Willow desired more than anything, and Severus wasn’t even giving her that. The old man was right as he always was, and Severus felt like he had to know now. Tell Willow everything, expose himself to her, let her see every dark secret he had in his closet. It was a painful process, to actually do something he feared to ever do. But once he began to open himself up it was hard to stop, as if he was releasing the floodgates that were his own torrid past. He expected her to interrupt him at any point in time, to smack him, to start screaming, to do anything other than what she was currently doing. Willow just sat there, her hands over his own with tears in her eyes. He didn’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. He finally stopped after spilling out his secrets, watching her cautiously. Her expression sparked up a memory in his past he did not dare to revisit, the face of a remorseful Hufflepuff prefect that just witnessed Severus Snape at his lowest point.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, she spoke, her voice trembling and nothing above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>“No one’s perfect, Severus. We’ve all done things we regret.” She said softly, reaching up to brush some hair from his face, “The people we try to be now is what matters because even the worst people can change for the better. I love you, Severus. I love everything about you, and I thank you for finally being honest with me. I believe if Lily is watching over us, she would forgive you as well.”</p><p> </p><p>His hands were trembling in her own, doing his best to hold himself together after her words. He stared at her, wondering why the Gods have given him one of their own.</p><p> </p><p>“Marry me.” He whispered.</p><hr/><p>

  <br/>
</p><p>The wedding was set to be during the summer of 1991 before the children would be sent off to Hogwarts. Narcissa was overjoyed to become the planner for such an event and Willow’s Maid of Honor. The wedding itself was planned to take place inside the Malfoy’s garden, as it was significantly bigger as Narcissa took it upon herself to include prominent families to the guest list.</p><p> </p><p>For the past six years, Willow had been in the company of other pureblood witches other than Narcissa Malfoy, meeting and eventually winning the hearts of Dahlia Parkinson, Celosia Zabini, and Euphemia Greengrass.</p><p> </p><p>The women kept Willow company inside the tent that was set up outside the garden, giggling about whatever gossip that was on their lips while Judith sat in the corner attempting to read one of her Hogwarts books. In her lap was her violin case, sat neatly over her white tulle dress.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa was spelling baby’s breath in Willow’s hair, giggling over something outlandish Celosia said just a moment before.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s a child in the room,” Judith spoke up irritably, because despite being mature for her age, she was still too young to hear such things.</p><p> </p><p>Celosia waved her off, “Nonsense, Judith, you’ll be an adult in no time, you’ll need to know how to capture the perfect boyfriend.”</p><p> </p><p>Judith bit back an insult, glaring at the woman offendedly and instead of commenting she checked her watch. “Ten minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop teasing her, Celosia.” Willow said behind a smile, “Oh, my legs are shaking!” She gasped, pressing her hand to her chest, “Girls, if I pass out please promise to roll me up there.”</p><p> </p><p>“You won’t pass out, calm down!” Dahlia chided.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll be doing enough passing out during the honeymoon, anyway.” Celosia winked again, sending Euphemia into a bout of giggles.</p><p> </p><p>Judith finally shut her book and grabbed her violin case, muttering something about adult themes before stepping out of the tent.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa couldn’t help but chuckle, “Now you’ve done it, Celosia!”</p><p> </p><p>“You girls are horrible,” Dahlia said exhaustively.</p><p> </p><p>Judith continued to mumble as she past Kitty and Blaise, the latter of the two talking about everything and (mostly) nothing while the girl had stopped listening five minutes ago, waiting impatiently for the boy to stop. When she saw Draco in the distance her eyes brightened, pleading silently for him to come save her.</p><p> </p><p>Draco caught her wandering gaze, laughing amusedly at her situation before heading over to help her out of it. “It’s almost time,” He said to her reassuringly, tapping her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh okay, Blaise that’s interesting oh I have to go help my mum thank you bye.” She kissed Draco’s cheek quickly before running off, effectively stopping the other boy in mid-sentence.</p><p> </p><p>“Oi, wait!” He called after her before glaring in Draco’s direction, “If you stayed away five minutes longer, I could have charmed her. I was so close!”</p><p> </p><p>Draco pat his friend’s shoulder, rolling his eyes sarcastically. “Don’t touch what isn’t yours, Blaise.”</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>The wedding was beautiful, beginning with an original sonata created by Judith that Willow marched down the aisle to. Kitty was the flower girl and both of them presented the rings. Willow insisted on her girls being a vital part of the wedding, wherein Severus had to ask them for their mother’s hand before Willow could say I do. Narcissa ended up in tears at the conclusion, because it had been six years of planning on her part to get the two of them together.</p><p> </p><p>The reception was just as beautiful, with one last original piece made and played by Judith that encompassed her mother and her now father, something light and airy against the backdrop of dark and intense, a performance that transitioned into a small string quartet that took over where she left off. Severus and Willow danced first until Lucius took Willow and Narcissa danced with Severus. It was a day that would forever be in Willow’s memory, as perfect as her first wedding with Daniel, and she felt like her long lost husband was looking down upon them and giving her his blessing, as she spotted his favorite birds circling the reception, white doves.</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>
  <em> 1977 </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> NEWTs were over, the students were basking in the relaxing atmosphere that the last day of Hogwarts brought them. Willow was the only one not laughing and carrying on with the rest of her housemates, because as they saw a new beginning, all she could see was a terrifying end. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Because after Hogwarts, during the summer of the same year, she would be wed to a man she did not know. She would become part of the Bloodstone Family Curse and have her whole future mapped out for her. She would become a symbol of her family’s power, possibly used for darker intentions, made to have a child that wasn’t born out of love. She didn’t want to be married to Lucius Malfoy, she didn’t want to carry on her family’s name in a loveless marriage. She didn’t want to be a bird, trapped in a cage. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She found herself standing near the lake, gazing down at the waters and frowning at her reflection. She crouched down to wave her hand over the surface of the water, marring her own image in the reflection. She breathed out a tired sigh, wishing to do nothing more than dive into the waters and allow the sea creatures down below to take her. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> There was nothing she could do to stop her impending fate. She had nowhere to go, she had no one to turn to. The friends she had were already planning their futures, and she couldn’t bring herself to burden any of them. Especially Lily, who just accepted James’ proposal… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She raised her head to look along the edge, spotting a familiar man in the distance. Her heart hammered in her chest at the sight of the black-haired boy in the equally black robes. Severus Snape, a boy she tried so hard to get close to, someone she longed to be near, only to be pushed painstakingly so far away. She didn’t know why she looked for this man time and time again, wondering if she was just a masochist for continuing on a fruitless endeavor. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Still, Willow slowly stood up, moving along the edge of the lake towards him. His back was to her, the man staring up high in the sky at nothing in particular. Willow managed to get close, slowing to a stop only a small distance away. “Severus…” She spoke up, wondering if he had heard of the engagement between her friends. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> He flinched at her voice, “Haven’t I told you to leave me alone?” He asked, his voice pained. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow took a cautious step forward, “I…I understand that Severus, but I’m worried. I can’t help but worry about you every time I see you.” She said softly, hesitating to reach out. “Please, all I’m asking is to listen to your problems.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The man scoffed, “If I had any problems, I wouldn’t bring them up with you.” He spat out, “Stop worrying about me, Bloodstone. There’s no part of me that would ever consider spilling my soul out to you.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow reached out, but Severus turned around suddenly and her hand recoiled. Tears threatened to fall from her eyes as she gazed into his own, how red they looked as if he had been crying. He glared scathingly at her and shied his eyes away, moving past her and stalking back towards the castle. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Willow’s legs trembled and she collapsed, her eyes welling up with fresh tears as she cried, the tears falling from her face and onto the warm green grass below. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I love you.” She whispered out painfully. </em>
