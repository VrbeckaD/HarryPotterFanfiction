          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in a remote part of Hawaii. Igor Karkaroff decided to lay low far away from Lord Voldemort's clutches and his boyfriend Corban Yaxley decided to join him.</p><p>Corban smiled. "Feel that sun on your face, it's just perfect."</p><p>Igor sighed. "I wish I could just relax like you, but I can't when I know he's still looking for me, Cor."</p><p>Corban said, "I know, this isn't a holiday. Who says that means we can't still enjoy ourselves?"</p><p>Igor muttered, "I can't when I'm absolutely terrified that he could be just around the next corner."</p><p>Corban replied, "We can't know for certain how close he is to finding you, but there's no point worrying about what we can't control."</p><p>Igor told him, "You're right, I'll try to relax for you."</p></div>
