  <u>POV Remus</u>
</p>

<p align="left">   A small boy with trembling hands and mousy brown curls stumbles onboard the Hogwarts Express clutching a battered case in one hand, the name R.J.Lupin is hastily scrawled on the side and an old muggle comic in the other, looking thoroughly creased and torn as though someone has rifled through it on multiple occasions. As the horn sounds and the train lurches forward, the young timid boy runs to the window with all the other students to wave his family goodbye. However, as the scarlet engine starts to pick up speed the other pupils begin to traipse off to find their friends, leaving Remus Lupin stranded in the middle of the corridor swaying with the motions of the train. Remus begins to peer into each compartment he walks by to see if there is any space for a small boy to slip in unnoticed. Unfortunately the further he walks down the train's never ending aisle the more anxious he becomes. Thoughts started crowding into the boys head filling him with a blind panic. He leapt in fear when a tap on his shoulder interrupted his flow of thinking. As he peered around he was met by the sight of a small rather podgy kid. The boy looked like his wheat coloured hair had been plastered to the top of his head. He looked as terrified as Remus was feeling a few moments ago. "Um hi... my name is Peter... erm Peter Pettigrew" the boy stuttered, his eyes darting around. "I'm Remus" he replied quietly, politely offering his hand out to Peter who shook it roughly. The two boys decided they might have more luck finding a compartment together. As they walked they made small talk and Remus found out that Peter was a first year like him hoping to make some friends. They started nearing the end of the train when they began to hear shouting coming from one of the compartments. Neither Remus nor Peter particularly wanted to see what they were shouting about but they were almost out of options of where to sit. Suddenly a flash of red hair whipped around the corner, followed by a very angry looking girl. She appeared not to have noticed the two boys and almost ran them over. She shot them a fierce look and barged past with a boy in tow. He had long greasy black hair and a hooked nose; he also looked like he very much would like to be somewhere else at that precise moment. As soon as the girl had dragged the poor boy into another compartment they heard a great deal of laughter coming from the one they just left. Peter flashed Remus a look and muttered "Do you want to introduce yourself first since we seem to be out of options of anywhere else to go..." Remus pulled his sleeves over his hands (a habit of his he did when he gets anxious) and walks into the small room surprised to see two ordinary looking boys. "Is it alright if Peter and I come and sit with you." he bravely asked. "There was nowhere else to go" he added as an afterthought. The two boys already sat on the seats looked like brothers. They both had dark hair and clearly shared the same sense of humour. "Sure" the one with glasses said grinning broadly at the thought of new friends. "We don't bite" the other boy said smiling mischievously. As Remus and Peter sat down the other boys introduced themselves. The boys were not in fact brothers and had only just met that same day on the train. Now that they were all sat and speaking pleasantly with each other Remus could see the differences between them. The boy James had glasses and hazel eyes. His hair was shorter than the other boy but it was very messy and it looked like he had had an argument with a hairdryer that morning. Whereas the other boy Sirius had longer hair that fell perfectly over his face framing it. He had sharper facial features that looked very attractive on his face. His eyes were a soft grey and were staring at Remus. Remus suddenly realised he had been staring and uttered an apology turning to the window. He watched the sky go from a beautiful soft blue to a velvety pink and then purple finally turning black. The scenery had changed too. They were now crossing mountains and valleys rather than the flat expanse they were travelling over earlier. Remus turned back to the inhabitants of the carriage to find them all trading chocolate frog cards and eating bertie botts every flavour beans. The boys all started changing into their robes as the steam train began to slow down as they approached Hogsmeade Station.</p>
