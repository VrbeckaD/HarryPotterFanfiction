          <div class="userstuff"><p><em> I never meant to make it such a mess </em><br/>
<em> I never thought that it would go this far </em><br/>
<em> So I just stand here sorry </em><br/>
<em> Searching for something to say </em><br/>
<em> Something to say </em><br/>
<em> Words fail, words fail </em><br/>
<em> There's nothing I can say </em></p><p>Dear <strike>Moony</strike> Remus,</p><p>I suppose I’ve lost the right to call you Moony. I don’t know how we got here. I mean, I do, I messed up. Royally. But how did it get this far? And what does one say in a situation like this? I don’t feel like there are enough words in enough languages to express how sorry I am. Je suis désolé. Lo siento. Es tut mir Leid. Paenitet. I’m sorry.</p><p><br/>
<em> I guess I thought I could be part of this </em><br/>
<em> I never had this kind of thing before </em><br/>
<em> I never had that perfect girl </em><br/>
<em> Who somehow could see the good part of me </em></p><p>I made the mistake of thinking I was different from them. I thought I could make myself different. Make myself fit in. I never had a family like this. And I thought maybe if I pretended I did, I’d be better, that you could see I was better.</p><p><br/>
<em> I never had the dad who stuck it out </em><br/>
<em> No corny jokes or baseball gloves </em><br/>
<em> No mom who just was there </em><br/>
<em> 'Cause mom was all that she had to be </em></p><p>My father didn’t exactly provide an example of how to be a decent man. My mother had other concerns than being an affection mum.</p><p><br/>
<em> That's not a worthy explanation </em><br/>
<em> I know there is none </em><br/>
<em> Nothing can make sense of all these things I've done </em></p><p>I’m not saying that excuses anything. Nothing can make what I did okay. I understand that better than I want to.</p><p><br/>
<em> Words fail, words fail </em><br/>
<em> There's nothing I can say </em><br/>
<em> Except sometimes, you see everything you wanted </em><br/>
<em> And sometimes, you see everything you wish you had </em><br/>
<em> And it's right there, right there, right there </em><br/>
<em> In front of you </em><br/>
<em> And you want to believe it's true </em><br/>
<em> So you... make it true </em><br/>
<em> And you think maybe everybody wants it </em><br/>
<em> And needs it... a little bit... too </em></p><p>There’s nothing to say about it that I haven’t thought before. You represented everything in life I wish I had. And I wanted all of it, even if I didn’t deserve it. I wish I deserved it. We all wish we deserved this.</p><p><br/>
<em> This was just a sad invention </em><br/>
<em> It wasn't real, I know </em><br/>
<em> But we were happy </em><br/>
<em> I guess I couldn't let that go </em><br/>
<em> I guess I couldn't give that up </em><br/>
<em> I guess I wanted to believe </em><br/>
<em> 'Cause if I just believe </em><br/>
<em> Then I don't have to see what's really there </em></p><p>I was wrong though. I didn’t deserve it. I didn’t have it. I just pretended I had what I wanted to hide my own shortcomings. But I thought it was working. We were all friends. And you and I? We had something more. But I guess it isn’t true anymore. And to ignore that is to lie to myself.</p><p><br/>
<em> No, I'd rather pretend I'm something better than </em><br/>
<em> These broken parts </em><br/>
<em> Pretend I'm something other than </em><br/>
<em> This mess that I am </em><br/>
<em> 'Cause then I don't have to look at it </em><br/>
<em> And no one gets to look at it </em><br/>
<em> No, no one can really see </em></p><p>But I thought if I ignored it, then maybe I could pretend those thoughts, those feelings weren’t there. I pretended to be a good person, but if I was truly the man I wanted you to think I was, I wouldn’t be writing this letter. But even as I write this letter, I know you’ll only see it too late because no one needs to see what a fuck up I really am.</p><p><br/>
<em> 'Cause I've learned to slam on the brake </em><br/>
<em> Before I even turn the key </em><br/>
<em> Before I make the mistake </em><br/>
<em> Before I lead with the worst of me </em><br/>
<em> I never let them see the worst of me </em></p><p>I put my mask up, smile before the tears fall, laugh before the anger strikes out, joke before I reveal what’s really in my mind. All the things I can’t share because then you would see how messed up, how damaged I am.</p><p><br/>
<em> 'Cause what if everyone saw? </em><br/>
<em> What if everyone knew? </em><br/>
<em> Would they like what they saw? </em><br/>
<em> Or would they hate it too? </em><br/>
<em> Will I just keep on running away from what's true? </em></p><p>Who wants to see that? That’s not someone worthy of love, not someone worthy of you, Remus. How could you love my broken pieces? How could I add that to your weighted shoulders?</p><p><br/>
<em> All I ever do is run </em><br/>
<em> So how do I step in </em><br/>
<em> Step into the sun? </em> <em><br/>
</em>Step into the sun</p><p> </p><p>So I hid it, until I lashed out and made a mess of all of this. I know I can fix things, but writing this letter has made me realize I need to fix who I am. I need to learn to be a better man if I’m to ever earn your love again. I hope I can earn your love again. I’m sorry.</p><p> </p><p>Hopefully Yours,</p><p>Sirius Orion Black</p></div>
