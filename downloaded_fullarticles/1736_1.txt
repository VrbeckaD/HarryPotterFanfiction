    <p>Hermione Granger pounded the steering wheel in frustration. “I hate driving on the other side of the road, not to mention the other side of the car!” she huffed. </p>
<p>Her companion didn’t say anything, but she was sure he was raising a disdainful brow, which annoyed her even more. </p>
<p>She peered up through the windshield, unimpressed by the alpine beauty of the Swedish countryside passing by. “And I’m almost certain those are snow clouds. Shit! I am also <em> not </em> comfortable driving in snow.” </p>
<p>“Well if you’d just let me arrange a portkey, like I suggested Granger,” his drawl contained more than a hint of ‘I told you so.’</p>
<p>“You know that wasn’t practical, Malfoy! We have all this equipment and the location is far from exact. We could have ended up on a deserted mountainside somewhere in below-freezing temperatures.” </p>
<p>“Doubtful.” He sounded bored.</p>
<p>Hermione could see out of her peripheral vision that he was studying the muggle map, turning it this way and that. “Are you sure you know how to read that?” she asked, squinting a quick glance at him. </p>
<p>“For the third or fourth time, yes,” he said, his exasperation finally breaking through his cool. “I think we may be on the wrong road, though. We should pull over.” </p>
<p>Hermione looked at the fat white flakes starting to collect on the windscreen and heaved a sigh as she braked and flipped on her indicator. This trip was taking a fast downhill slide. Not that it had far to go. It had been doomed before it started...</p>

<p>When the Graphorn request came in from the Scandinavian Ministry of Magic to the DMC, Hermione had been ecstatic. She’d been wanting to work with the creatures for ages and the chance to interact with them - especially in the wild - was extremely rare. Plus she was outraged by the smuggling ring that had been targeting the herds, slaughtering the animals for their priceless horns, and pleased to be able to help protect them. </p>
<p>Most European herds were already safeguarded by powerful spells and wards, some of which Hermione had helped design. But these herds, one in a remote part of Sweden and another in Norway, had managed to keep hidden until now, when an excess of their horn powder had arrived on the potions black market and diagnostic spells had revealed its origins. </p>
<p>Hermione hadn’t realized she’d be getting a partner for the assignment from the DMLE investigative task force, but the two departments had decided it would make sense to combine efforts. The DMLE agent would gather evidence on the poachers and provide protection, while Hermione assessed the animals and cast the protective spells. Hermione couldn’t argue with that, it would be nice not to have to watch her back while she was performing complex magic. She half hoped the agent assigned would be Harry, although she knew he was working an intense case and unlikely to be pulled away.</p>
<p>When she found out her assigned agent was Draco Malfoy, she’d had mixed feelings. On the one hand, Malfoy was one of the best and most meticulous aurors in the department. Hermione respected his work ethic and methods, as did Harry, who had partnered him on several cases. On the other he hadn’t done much field work - and he was, well, still Malfoy. Still prickly and sarcastic. Still arrogant and cold.</p>
<p><em>And still</em> <em>gorgeous</em>, whispered Hermione’s inner voice, although she ruthlessly suppressed it. Just because a man dressed impeccably and had perfect hair and bone structure didn’t mean she had to lose her head. All she had to do was remember what a little prick he’d been in school and those disturbing thoughts usually abated. Well, most of them. </p>
<p>Anyway, she’d decided to make the best of the Malfoy situation and even put a special note on the assignment request saying she thought he would be ideal for the job, which she knew he would see. </p>
<p>She was looking forward to the trip again until she’d wandered by the DMLE intake desk one day while on her way to meet Harry for lunch. The girls who filed requests had been gossiping and she heard Malfoy’s name, so she’d stopped to eavesdrop shamelessly. </p>
<p>“You know how his eyes go <em> really </em> silver when he’s upset?”</p>
<p>“Oooh, yes. <em> So </em> hot.”</p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, they were practically <em> sparking </em> when he walked out of Robards’s office. And his hair was a little mussed like he’d been raking his fingers through it…” </p>
<p><em> Well that actually sounds quite intriguing </em>, whispered Hermione’s treacherous inner voice. She told it to shut up. </p>
<p>“STOP. You. are. killing. me. Why did I have to be off sick that day?? Do you know why he was upset?” </p>
<p>“I don’t. I could only hear snippets through the door. Something to do with smuggling and Switzerland? Or was it Sweden? And I heard Malfoy sort of raise his voice and say, ‘I’m not doing it!’ at one point. And Robards said, ‘we’ll talk about this later’ as Malfoy left.” </p>
<p>Hermione’s brows drew together in a ferocious frown and she’d stalked past them toward Harry’s office, face red. So he didn’t want to go on her assignment, did he? When she had taken special pains let him know she approved? What a total <em> arse </em> . She vowed then and there that she wouldn’t give an inch to that blond prat. He could fucking <em> freeze </em> in the Scandanavian wastelands for all she cared.</p>
