    <p>August 10th, 1990</p><p> </p><p>“Draco!” Lucius Malfoy’s sharp voice stood out from the crowd, “stop dragging your feet and hurry up!”</p><p> </p><p>Grumbling curses under his breath, the hotheaded blonde reluctantly quickened his pace in order to keep up with his father. He was missing flying practice with Theo and Blaise for this,a perfectly beautiful August day was going to waste just so that Lucius Malfoy could try and have the upper hand on his son. Draco preferred to play quidditch and read in his room then follow in his father's footsteps. It was boring and didn't make any sense to him. He had a better relationship with his mum who had actually been present in his growing up years, his father decided that now would be the time to interfere in Draco's life and have all sorts of crazy expectations of him. Draco didn't like it,  he was smart enough to correlate anything his father wanted him to do was something he himself didn’t want. Especially now when he decided to be an actual father in his life.</p><p> </p><p>Draco had not been looking forward to this day, when his father would declare him a man and drag him to boring business meetings so that he could learn the ropes of being a Malfoy. His mother had tried to drag his youthful days out for as long as she could, much to Draco’s relief. But she couldn’t make up excuses anymore, Draco was their only child-- meaning that he couldn’t act out or be a normal child anymore. He hated his father for that, for suddenly deciding how Draco was going to live his life and punishing him when he acted out.</p><p> </p><p>The main hall of the Ministry was packed, as it usually was. There were so many different kinds of witches and wizards coming in and out of floo networks and apparating around them. Lucius stood out from the crowd though, with his white blonde hair pulled back with a tie and his sharp expression that everyone cowering away from him. He was a tall and domineering man, Draco had been scared of him on more than one occasion and not just because of his frightening physical presence.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius was able to grab an elevator, pulling Draco close to his side in the corner. It wasn’t a move to make room for the young woman struggling with her papers or the elderly woman with a cane, it was so Lucius could whisper his expectations in Draco’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>“Stand up straight, get rid of that scowl on your face, comb your hair back, and don’t get in any arguments. Do you understand me, son?” Lucius’ breath on Draco’s neck had goosebumps spreading down his arms and spine.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, father.” Draco gritted out, wanting more than anything to get out of his stupid set of robes that itched horrendously.</p><p> </p><p>They came to the floor designated for Wizengamot hearings, the doors opening to crowds of wizards conversing amongst each other. The room was smaller than what the courtroom was going to be, a chandelier hung above everyone's head and bathed the room in light spots that twinkled and shone vibrantly. Draco tried to school his expression to be neutral as glances were casted their way. A tall wizard with sharp, eagle-like eyes parted from his current conversation and came striding towards them, his robes billowing behind him like a cape. It was Theo’s father, Quinton Nott, a man who seemed to never allow a genuine expression to cross his face. His eyes were dark and emotionless, deep pools of nothing that always had Draco recoiling.</p><p> </p><p>“Lucius, you arrived just in time, I think the hearing is to begin here shortly.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a good thing Draco didn’t keep us behind schedule more so than he already did.” Lucius said conversationally as he clasped a strong hand on Draco’s shoulder, “It would have been a shame to miss this case.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yes,” another man, Walden Macnair, a shorter man who happened to carry a frightening presence in his small and slightly overweight frame, “we don’t get hearings like these as often anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco hadn’t been informed on what the hearing was going to be about, all he knew from his father was that they were hearing a case from someone convicted of a crime and coming up with the sentence. Lucius seemed confident that it would be an easy trial, one that he wanted Draco there for. He couldn’t help but be skeptical of his father, as of recently the man had been dragging him to different events and meetings where he wanted to teach his son a lesson or to understand his place in wizarding society. Nerves threatened to overturn his stomach, he didn’t know what to expect.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly a chime rang out, indicating for the wizards, and occasional witch, to make their way into the chamber. Lucius had a hand on Draco’s back, keeping him in front of his father so he couldn’t find a way to run off. Draco let his eyes wander, even though his legs desperately wanted to get him far away from here, taking note of how big the room was and the witness stand down below.</p><p> </p><p>The room silenced as everyone got into their seats, an eerie sound that had Draco’s ears ringing from the deafening silence. He glanced over and made eye contact with Vincent and Gregory, who were also accompanying their fathers like himself. The boys seemed much happier to be there than Draco did, which frustrated him even more. He hated being forced into a friendship with them, they were dull and boring and always copied what their parents did. They had no brains for themselves, they were basically puppets.</p><p> </p><p>“The trial shall now begin,” the Chief Warlock spoke up, “bring in the accused.”</p><p> </p><p>The doors below opened dramatically, two aurors entered with their wands aimed at a young man in a rope binding spell. Draco tried to lean forward to get a better look at the man, but Lucius shot him a cold stare, a warning to not step out of line.</p><p> </p><p>“Please state your name for the Wizengamot.” The Chief Warlock demanded, crossing his arms over his desk as he leaned forward.</p><p> </p><p>“Bludgeons, Terry Bludgeons.” The man stuttered, his voice raw and croaky.</p><p> </p><p>It sounded like he’d been crying, Draco realized with a start.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Bludgeons, please state your blood status.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why must I do that?” Mr. Bludgeons asked in a quivering voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Please don’t waste our time, state the answers to the Chief Warlock’s question, please.” A Wizengamot member to the Chief’s left spoke up.</p><p> </p><p>Terry Bludgeons seemed to quiver and shake in his boots before he finally relented.</p><p> </p><p>“H-Halfblood, I’m a halfblood. My mum is a halfblood witch and my father was a muggle before he was killed.”</p><p> </p><p>“Marion,” the Chief Warlock turned to his right, “please state the crimes charged against Mr. Bludgeons.”</p><p> </p><p>“Terry Bludgeons is charged with the suspicions of being a Werewolf.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco slammed his mouth shut before the gasp crawling up his throat could escape. An actual werewolf was standing before him! Draco had only heard stories, saying that Werewolves were vicious creatures and that when they are in their human form they still seem inhuman and immoral. Terry Bludgeons was just a young man, probably not even hardly an adult at that; how could he be considered a criminal? </p><p> </p><p>The list of crimes were read aloud, all of them sounding unfair and a little bit too inaccurate to Draco. It was a horrifying three hours to sit and watch each member of the Wizengamot tear into the young boy, his defense team not able to stand a chance. </p><p> </p><p>Terry had been bitten when he was twelve, forced to join a pack when a werewolf captured him from his parents. He had tried to escape and seek any sort of medical help he could, trying to find a way to keep living despite his affliction. It wasn’t until he got a job at Tiddle and Potts, a restaurant that many purebloods loved to dine in, that his employer found out about his condition and had him arrested.</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s hands were clenched, his palms screaming in pain from how his nails dug into his skin at the anger that rose in his chest. How could someone who was trying to live their life be considered a criminal and a bad person? It was immoral, completely outrageous and Draco wanted to stand up and scream at every adult how idiotic they were. Terry didn’t mean to be bitten, to be forced into such a stressful and hated lifestyle! Why was the court committing him for a crime they think he did on purpose?</p><p> </p><p>“Terry Bludgeons you are guilty of all crimes charged against you,” the Chief Warlock announced, “you will be sentenced to ten years in Azkaban.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?!” Draco yelled, his voice drowned out by the sudden chatter that filled the chamber.</p><p> </p><p>A stab of pain jolted Draco’s side, causing him to wince and cry out. He whirled his attention to his father, the man shooting him a deathly, icy look.</p><p> </p><p>“Come along son, we need to attend your lessons.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco shuttered, from the unjust trial he had just witnessed and the thought of having to endure another one of Lucius Malfoy’s infamous “lessons”.</p><p><br/>

</p><p>December 25th, 1990</p><p> </p><p>“Bill! Stop teasing Ginny, you’re making a ruckus!” Molly Weasley shouted over the loud arguing and shouting her family created.</p><p> </p><p>Ron sat in the corner of the dining room, already done setting the table and unsure what to do. Everyone was shouting, singing, and cheering for Christmas and their presents. It was annoying more than anything, shouting didn’t get anyone anywhere it just caused more chaos! He was trying to ignore George trying to agitate him into a fight, which worked since he was able to just close his eyes and tune everyone out. </p><p> </p><p>Being the sixth child had its perks but it had more cons than anything. He could be ignored and left to himself if he wanted space, but if he wanted help with something or someone to talk to he was always out of luck. His parents had already experienced the other older siblings and put in all of their energy into raising and focusing on them, they didn’t have time for Ron. </p><p> </p><p>Ron was also cursed with hand-me-downs and old items of his brothers, he never got anything for himself. He was just another redhead son in the family, expected to be a certain way and to shape up. Ron hated it, he hated how nobody listened to him and didn’t treat him like he mattered.</p><p> </p><p>Christmas dinners were always a noisy affair, full of lively conversation run by the eldest siblings. Bill was the oldest, always being the center of attention for Molly’s motherly tendencies. He always had great stories to tell but never wanted to be in the spotlight, he hated it when their mother would quiz him with questions on his living situations, if he had a girlfriend yet, and if he would consider cutting his hair!</p><p> </p><p>Charlie was just plain odd, he could be quiet and somber but then jumping in with the twins’ antics. He always had a story to share about the dragons he tended to, mostly having to do with near death experiences that didn’t faze him at all. He could start a debate at the table and have everyone at odds with each other, sitting in the corner smirking evilly at the chaos he created.</p><p> </p><p>Percy was always trying to talk to their father, Arthur. He would question him on his job and ask all sorts of questions pertaining to the ministry and how it worked. Percy wanted to work in the ministry one day, it was the only thing he had ever had a desire for. When Arthur’s attention was divided though, Percy would just sit back and focus on eating and not being wrapped up into a prank with the twins.</p><p> </p><p>There was hardly anything else to say about the twins, they were the physical embodiment of chaos. They always had a prank or two up their sleeves, ready to tease and joke with anyone to get them riled up. It was annoying, Ron couldn’t stand those two when they decided to target him-- which was all the bloody time.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny was the only girl, so of course she had attention from Molly and all of her older brothers. She had an innocent facade, but she was a feisty little gremlin inside a nine year old body. She had a way of inflicting pain and defending herself so well that no one would ever know it was her. Ron was always stuck with her, which sucked because she treated him like he was the youngest sibling and not herself.</p><p> </p><p>Ron couldn’t fit in, yet everyone tried to squeeze him into this Weasley-mold. He was nervous for his first year at Hogwarts, more so for the sorting since his entire family (besides Ginny) had been sorted into Gryffindor. He was afraid he wouldn’t live up to those standards, that he would be disowned and looked down upon. At the same time, Ron wanted to stand out. He wanted his parents to just acknowledge and love him like they did to all of his older brothers.</p><p> </p><p>“Ronniekins! Why the long face? Are you preparing yourself for our lovely present for you tomorrow?”</p><p> </p><p>Everybody laughed, even Molly couldn’t hide her laughter behind the firm scowl she usually reserved for the twins. </p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>March 15th, 1991</p><p> </p><p>Hermione Granger had always been bullied and made fun of, that she was used to. She didn’t necessarily enjoy it, but she didn’t let it get to her self esteem. She liked to read, to study and learn about anything she could, which got her teased for being a “know-it-all”. But that didn’t mean she would just stop reading in order to avoid the teasing, in fact it actually spurred her on. </p><p> </p><p>“Mum,” she called as she skipped down the stairs, “can you pack me some extra carrots and dip?”</p><p> </p><p>Joan Granger hid her smile behind her bush of curls and grabbed an extra baggy.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, is this for that boy you’ve been talking about?” She asked, winking at her daughter as she bounded up to the counter.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, he never eats that much! I hope he enjoys my carrots though.” Hermione frowned, nibbling on her lip worriedly.</p><p> </p><p>“How about I add in an extra rice cake,” Joan suggested, “add a sweet in there to get his attention.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s parents were dentists who discouraged sweets and candies, but treats like rice cakes and fruits were acceptable forms of treats in their eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay!” Hermione nodded her head, hope blossoming in her chest, “Maybe he’ll like some fruit too, perhaps?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” Joan agreed, turning to the fridge for the carton of blueberries, “this should be an acceptable snack for him then!”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks mum!” Hermione jumped down from her stool as she saw the school bus pull up in front of her house.</p><p> </p><p>“Have a good day at school!” Joan shouted as Hermione grabbed her lunch bag and dashed for the front door.</p><p> </p><p>The bus doors opened as Hermione skipped down the driveway and waved at the bus driver. His name was Greg, he was a kind old man who loved chatting to the kids and driving them around. He always favored talking to Hermione though because she could hold an actual conversation and was always very interested in Greg’s stories of travelling through Indonesia and other wonderful countries and places.</p><p> </p><p>“Hullo, Miss Granger! I fancy the bright yellow you’re wearing today, you look like a ray of sunshine!”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione grinned, saying thank you as she took her seat right next to the front so she could have a conversation about her homework from last night.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Greg,” Hermione piped up as the bus took off down the road, “what do you know about meteorology?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh not that much,” he replied with a hearty chuckle, “it’s been a while since I was your age.”</p><p> </p><p>“We had to read a passage on meteorology last night, it was very fascinating! Did you know that meteorology includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics with a major focus on weather forecasting? Climatology is the study of atmospheric changes (both long and short-term) that define average climates and their change over time, due to both natural and anthropogenic climate variability. Aeronomy is--”</p><p> </p><p>“Oi! Granger swallowed a dictionary for breakfast!” Someone shouted from the back of the bus.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione clenched her teeth, keeping her focus away from the laughing and teasing of her peers.</p><p> </p><p>“That is very interesting, Hermione,” Greg said in a soft voice, smiling kindly at her, “please continue.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione smiled through the tears threatening to leak out of her eyes, grateful for someone to be so kind to her back. She finished her description of her homework and how exciting it was to read about before the bus dropped them off at school. Greg thanked her with a pleasant smile on his wrinkled face.</p><p> </p><p>School was quite enjoyable for Hermione, she enjoyed talking with the teachers and making notes. She was best friends with the librarian who allowed her to eat her lunch in the back corner and peruse any selection of books she wanted to. It was nice, to spend the lunch hour in solitude away from the teasing and rude remarks, but Hermione was excited to see the new boy was interested in the library as well. </p><p> </p><p>He was a social person, already making friends with everyone in their class--yet he would scour the non-fiction section of the library with the same vigor that Hermione had. He seemed nice, even though he was friends with everyone who made fun of her, Hermione couldn’t help but notice how kind he was to all their teachers and the librarian. Her respect for him grew and she wanted to talk to him and understand who he was. </p><p> </p><p>That’s why she had snacks, the perfect ice breaker.</p><p> </p><p>“Hullo,” she greeted him after spending twenty minutes trying to think of a way to talk to him without sounding stiff and awkward, “do you like blueberries? Did you know that blueberries are ranked number one in antioxidant health benefits in a comparison with more than 40 fresh fruits and vegetables?”</p><p> </p><p>The boy just stared at her for a second, his hand frozen from where he had been fingering the spine of a World War I book, before cracking a grin and relaxing his shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>“You really <em> are </em> a walking encyclopedia.” </p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s heart dropped and she flushed angrily for a second before his eyes widened and he raised his hands up in surrender.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh no, I didn’t mean that as a joke, it’s just true. It’s cool.” </p><p> </p><p>“You think I’m <em> cool </em>?” Hermione whispered in disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course! I didn’t know that about blueberries, where’d you read about that?” He asked, leaning against the bookshelf.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione spent the entire lunch period showing him different books and sharing as much information as she could remember off the top of her head. She was grinning the entire time, enthusiastic to have someone to share these facts and findings with someone who genuinely enjoyed them.</p><p> </p><p>They shared her bag of blueberries, rice cakes, and carrots as they looked at different health books. It was the most fun Hermione had ever had with someone her own age, she was too focused to realize that Ben (his full name was Benjamin Smith, he told her) wrapped an arm around her shoulder and had scooted himself into her personal space.</p><p> </p><p>“.....Glucose is the main energy source for your body, but it can't enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin — a hormone secreted by your pancreas. When glucose levels rise, certain cells (beta cells) in your pancreas release insulin. This allows glucose to enter the cells and--”</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, mid sentence, Ben planted a kiss on her cheek. Hermione’s stomach plummeted and she scooted away, realizing how close he had gotten into her space.</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me?!” She exclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>“What? I like you, is that a crime?” He laughed at her like she was the one being weird.</p><p> </p><p>“Well I don’t like you like that!” Hermione was nearly shouting at this point, her heart was racing at how angry she suddenly was.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh you will after you start dating me though.” He winked at her.</p><p> </p><p>She scowled, so frustrated and angry at herself and at him. All she wanted was a friend, not someone to take advantage of her and who she was. She didn’t want some boy to creepily like her and kiss her, she wanted a companion to bond with and read books with! How dare he assume she would want to date him!</p><p> </p><p>“Please go away, you are rude and aren’t a good friend.” She commanded with as much authority she could channel.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly Ben was the one scowling. He stood up angrily and glared at her as he grabbed his bag.</p><p> </p><p>“Nobody wants to be your friend, freak.”</p><p> </p><p>Her heart seemed to break at the words, part of her wanting to accept them as truth. But no, Hermione thought angrily, she wasn’t going to allow that prick to define her. Tears dripped down her cheeks as she bounced up to her feet and stormed over to him before he could leave the library. </p><p> </p><p>As he opened the door, she slammed her hand against it and stomped on his foot with her heel. She sneered, watching him howl in pain, feeling so much more powerful and mightier than she had ever felt at being bullied and teased in the past.</p><p> </p><p>“I. Am not. A freak.” She spat out, slapping him across the cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“Miss Granger!” The librarian exclaimed. “Back away from Mr. Smith and go to the principal this instant!”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione smirked, happy to get her first detention for standing up for herself finally.</p><p><br/>

<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>July 23rd, 1991</p><p> </p><p>Harry was always prepared for the worst when it came to mornings. Petunia was always in a different mood, but always revolving around one range of emotions: anger. She could be mildly frustrated and just ignore Harry’s presence, she could be pissed off and criticise his every mood, but then she could be entirely not having it and smack him around the kitchen like he was some rag doll. No, she was never violent, she just had a way of making sure Harry stayed out of her way and didn’t ruin anything.</p><p> </p><p>He learned his lessons though, never failing to repeat them again so he wouldn’t be punished in some awful and torturous way. That’s why Harry and Petunia had the best relationship out of the three Dursleys. Dudley just treated Harry like actual garbage, shoving and punching him to his satisfaction. Harry knew what to expect from his cousin, he was quick and smart and could outrun the whale of a boy.</p><p> </p><p>It was Vernon that Harry did his best to shape up around, because if he miscalculated and slipped up he would get the beating or punishment of a lifetime. </p><p> </p><p>“Oi! Stop sleeping, boy, and get breakfast ready!” Petunia yelled from outside of Harry’s cupboard door, rapping her bony knuckles against the wood.</p><p> </p><p>Harry just wanted to disappear, to fade into the rough fabric of his shabby blanket and not have to deal with Dudley’s birthday. The bullying and punching was always so much worse on his cousins birthday than any other day. It was basically like another birthday present for Dudley to get to beat on Harry with no resistance from anyone.</p><p> </p><p>He finally got up with a groan, sliding his glasses on the brim of his nose and trying to tame his messy hair down. It was an attempt he tried to make everyday to no avail, nothing could tame his hair. He changed into a loose t shirt given to him from Dudley’s castaways and a pair of joggers. </p><p> </p><p>“Did you even attempt to tame your hair?!” Petunia exclaimed shrilly as Harry emerged from the cupboard he was crammed into ever since he was a baby.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Aunt Petunia.” He murmured, immediately making a beeline for the oven so he could lose himself in the soothing act of making bacon and eggs.</p><p> </p><p>Petunia tutted to herself, going back to buttering toast and pancakes. Out of all the chores Harry was forced to endure, Harry genuinely enjoyed cooking. He learned so much over the years, knowing how to make omelets, all sorts of sandwiches, bacon, sausage, soups, roast, and even some chicken recipes when Petunia was too busy to focus on dinner.</p><p> </p><p>Harry ignored Dudley stomping down into the kitchen and making a fuss of how many presents he was getting that year, squealing about not having more than last year. Anger coiled tight and hotly in Harry’s gut as he listened to the spoiled brat of a cousin of his complain about not getting enough presents.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> That fat pig doesn’t have anything to complain about, he’s not the one crammed into a cupboard and never getting a present once in his life. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The thought immediately made Harry feel guilty, mostly guilty for even feeling that much anger towards someone. But if it had to be anyone that Harry could be furiously enraged with, it was any member of the Dursley’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Vernon, Mrs. Figg can’t take the brat.” Petunia cried, phone in hand.</p><p> </p><p>Dudley began to cry at the mere mention of Harry not being able to be removed from his space for his special day.</p><p> </p><p>“Surely there’s someone who can take him off our hands?!” Vernon roared.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve already asked in a case like this! Nobody else can!”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want him ruining my birthday!” Dudley cried, slumping against the table and getting syrup in his hair.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the morning was full of arguments and yelling, trying to persuade Dudley that Harry wouldn’t ruin his day if he was forced to join, Harry just had to promise to not be a nuisance and to be completely silent the entire day. Harry begrudgingly accepted the terms, even though he pointed out that he could stay at the house and take care of himself. Vernon didn’t like the idea, figures.</p><p> </p><p>“Listen here, boy,” Vernon corned Harry against the side of the car, “no funny business or you will be locked in your cupboard for a week!”</p><p> </p><p>Despite the fear Harry felt, he knew what the punishment was and would do everything not to endure it.</p><p> </p><p>“I promise.” Harry muttered as he was finally released to get into the car.</p><p> </p><p>Harry kept his mouth shut as Dudley and his friend (Harry didn’t care to remember the prick’s name) joked around and tried to get on Harry’s nerves by punching and prodding him. He stared resolutely out the window and watched the trees and buildings fly by. He didn’t mention anything about the flying motorcycle he saw in his dream when a motorcyclist cut Vernon off, he knew what the comment would warrant out of his uncle; Vernon would yell about “oddities” and how “impossible” it was for a motorcycle to fly. Harry knew better and kept his mouth shut.</p><p> </p><p>He kept to himself the entire day, watching how the Dursley’s acted like any normal family. It was painful to watch, to see how lovingly Petunia cared for her son and how Vernon would talk to and answer all of Dudley’s inane questions. Harry forced himself not to get angry, whenever he had strong emotional responses things <em> happened </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Harry wasn’t stupid, the weird oddities that happened around him had to be caused by him. He was so scared when he ended up on top of the school roof when Dudley and his gang had been chasing him, he had been so upset when Petunia buzzed his hair off and it grew back overnight, and he had been angry when Dudley stole his homework and ended up with big oozing blisters appeared all over his skin.</p><p> </p><p>He couldn’t have <em> anything </em> out of sorts happening today of all days. Harry didn’t understand what <em> it </em> was, all he knew was to acknowledge it. <em> Maybe it’s some sort of phase? Like puberty or something? </em></p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t until they got to the reptile house that Harry slipped up. Dudley had run up to a big encasement of a snake lounging on a rock. He banged and pounded his fat fists against the glass, yelling at the poor creature to do something. </p><p> </p><p>Immediately Dudley’s attention was caught by another creature and the Dursley’s followed after him, leaving Harry to stare sadly at the python.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry you had to deal with him,” Harry murmured, pressing a hand up to the glass. “He’s a prick all the time, but an abnormally awful one today of all days.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed, realizing how insane he probably looked, talking to a snake.</p><p> </p><p>“I know how it feels, to be trapped in a cage and not able to get out.” Harry’s shoulders sagged at the thought. “I’m sorry you can’t be with your family. I can’t either, they’re all dead.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I am sorry, Speaker </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry jolted at the sudden hissing voice, eerily coming from the snake in front of him. He whipped his head behind him, seeing if anyone else reacted like he did to the voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you just speak to me?” Harry asked, peering curiously at the snake who had shifted and moved so it was face to face with him.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Of course, I haven’t spoken to a human in so long </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Harry stammered, glancing over his shoulder to gauge where Dudley’s attention was caught. “I wish I could help you. I didn’t know I could speak to snakes before this.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> You are okay, Speaker. Come and visit me more often, I get incredibly lonely </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded his head before joining the Dursley’s towards where the butterfly exhibit was. He didn’t get in trouble for cursing the glass away and trapping Dudley behind it, he was careful and smart as he quietly sat back and let the Dursley’s believe they were in control.</p><p><br/>
