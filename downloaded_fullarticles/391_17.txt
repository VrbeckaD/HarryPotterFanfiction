    <p>Harry POV</p><p>I stared at my bloodied hands; the resurrection stone gleaming in my left palm, the elder wand lying in my right and the invisibility cloak draped over my shoulder. I am the Master of Death. I'm also the only one left standing after the final battle; The Battle of Hogwarts. We had destroyed all of the Horcruxes, including the one in my head. All I needed to do was utter the killing curse. We couldn't have known what would happen. What he would do next; Voldemort already had a backup plan if he were to lose. My eyes slowly moved back towards the body that once held the last scrap of Voldemort's soul, runes were etched into his skin and the sight of it is horrific; the faint orange glow, the smell of singed flesh, the image was burned into my eyes. Runes that enacted an ancient spell; one that hasn't been seen in an age.</p><p>Basically, the runes channel and collect his magic -every last drop of it. The magic is then released by saying one of two different incantations; the first option is '<em>vitam restituit'</em>; basically bringing the soul back to every corpse and healing all wounds. The second option is '<em>gladius mortis'</em>; which brings the sword of death, killing every single soul within its range. Voldemort had enough magic and malicious intent to desolate all of Hogwarts, even those within a couple miles. Due to using every ounce of the caster's magic the result is their own death, Voldemort was dead even before my killing curse reached him.</p><p>It is hard to process, the war was over now, but at such a terrifying cost. Thousands of lives, all gone in the blink of an eye. All because one man wanted more power. I tilt my head up to look at the cloud covered sky, bloody and torn black robes clung to my equally bloody and dirty skin.</p><p>"Now what? Everyone and everything I knew, are gone.. I spent my whole life training for this, now what?" I stood there for what felt like hours, though it was only a few minutes, waiting for an answer, though from whom I don't know. I waited for a miracle, for someone, <em>anyone </em>to stand up and tell me this was a lie, just a horrible joke.</p><p>Nothing happens for another ten minutes. Eventually my legs give out from underneath me, falling seems to happen in slow motion; my bones creaking and blood dripping from the numerous cuts scattered across my skin. My hair is beyond matted with blood; some of which is mine, most of it belongs to other people. I am vaguely aware of the tears running down my face. Hermione and Ron were tortured by Bellatrix. I couldn't save them. The Weasleys all died trying to protect the younger kids trapped in the castle. Tonks, Remus, Severus and Hagrid. All gone. Even Malfoy. Draco. Everything I thought I knew about him was wrong. We were more alike than I thought. I let the rest of my body fall forward, collapsing on the dirty ground. The wand and stone roll out of my limp hands, stopping when they hit the still form of Professor McGonagall a few feet away. The cloak is trapped under my own still body, and I can't help but wonder again what I'm supposed to do.</p><p>My wounds will heal in a few short hours, a perk of being Master of Death I suppose. I'm not sure how I know that, I just <em>do. </em>The same way I know I can't die anymore. I don't have a handy explanation. I wonder what's the point in staying here? Everyone I love is dead, and all those I will love will age and die, I will be stuck here, watching them fade away, still in my 22 year old body.</p><p>'<em>I don't want to be here. There's no point anymore, my goal has been accomplished. We won. Yet, I lost. I lost everything I ever knew.'</em></p><p>I didn't notice myself slipping out of consciousness, slipping outside of all time and space, it seemed each day was as long as a life time, but I woke, and now I'm in a place surrounded by white light, similar to the Kings Cross Station I arrived in after Voldemort killed the horcrux that lived inside me. Maybe Death himself had come to say hello. Doubtful.</p><p>"<em>Hello, Harry Potter, Master of Death."</em></p><p>"Who are you? You're not Death." I kept my voice steady, spreading my magic out and glancing around to try and find them. I come up with nothing, which is odd.</p><p>"<em>My name is Eru Ilúvatar, the Lord of the Valar. I have come to give you a choice</em>."</p><p>"Valar? Choice?" I frowned, the soft male voice surrounding me. I hadn't heard of anything called the Valar before, not even in History of Magic. Maybe this is the joke I had been waiting for, the other shoe dropping.</p><p>"<em>Yes, Harry. This is no joke. I speak the truth. There is another world aside from your own. It is called Arda, or Middle Earth in the common tongue. It is so different from your own world, there are very few wizards in Middle Earth."</em></p><p>I watch as the space ahead of me began to grow fuzzy, shifting into a picture. It was like looking through a window, or maybe a pensieve? I assume the images are of this 'Middle Earth' he speaks of. The first images I see show a village of tiny people, they farm and garden and eat, and then I notice their feet, no shoes, but large and neatly combed hair covering them, all of them happily going about their business. The next is just an image of a dense forest, then a mountain covered in snow. A second series of images shows people with elf, or pixie-like ears, they are focused and graceful as they work with a bow and arrow. The images fade, and I wait for 'Lord of the Valar' to explain.</p><p>"<em>That is but a small example of what Middle Earth looks like and her people. However, I did not show you the evils that haunt them. You wished to know what you are to do now that Voldemort is gone? This is one option. You could choose to stay out of the war, if so then the elves will offer you protection, but my children need protection. Your third option is to stay where you are and build a new life for yourself."</em></p><p>I hold back a sigh. Really, there isn't anyone waiting for me back home. No one who would care if I left. I can go back and face a broken wizarding world and be forced to fix it. I could make a new life for myself in the process. Why should I though? I've done what was asked of me, Voldemort is gone for good. I don't need a pro's and con's list for going back to Hogwarts.</p><p>Middle Earth is in the middle of a brewing war it seemed, and I had just finished one. However, I would actually get to choose if I want to fight or not, it would be my own choice this time. Plus, with my unending life, I literally have all the time in the world. If I stay here I can travel Earth, learn languages, see all the culture on offer. I could do the same on Middle Earth. Neither place sounds all that appealing right now. Except that no one would know who I am in Middle Earth. Now that sounds more like it.</p><p>"And if I chose to go to Middle Earth?"</p><p>"<em>You will wake up in a forest near Rivendell. I will give you the knowledge of the most used language, Westron, but it is up to you to decide if you want to learn the rest of them. I will also give you the basic knowledge you will need to blend in; what beings live there, plant life, and how to greet certain people of different cultures and different beliefs. You will retain all your knowledge and abilities from your own world. When you wake up, head for Rivendell. It is there that you shall make your choice. Also, the elves of Middle-Earth are blessed with long life, some of them having been alive for thousands of years. You shall not be alone on Middle Earth, Harry."</em></p><p>"Very well then, Eru, I will go to Middle Earth "</p><p>"<em>Then I shall take you there. Remember, go to Rivendell. Everything else will be your decision."</em></p><p>Once he finished speaking, my vision began to blur until everything goes dark again.</p><p>Only a few moments pass and I wake, I'm surrounded by trees and a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. I find it a little odd to wake up standing, but I shrug it off only to realize I'm holding something. I open my hands only to find I still have the hallows; the cloak is draped over my shoulder, stone in one hand and wand in the other. I wasn't really expecting them to follow me, but in a way, it makes sense. I wouldn't be much of a 'Master of Death' without them, and I am unable to use magic without a wand. I locate a pocket without any holes and slip the resurrection stone inside, the wand going into my wand holster next to Draco's wand. I'm a little unsure where to put the cloak, but I locate another undamaged pocket and after folding it up, the cloak slips right in.</p><p>I take a small step forward, swaying slightly as a dizzy spell hits, before steadying myself again to continue. At this point, my body simply needs rest and nourishment and a little more time to finish healing a broken rib and a nasty gash on my right side. However, something tells me there's no time to rest or explore, so I walk in a random direction, following my instinct hoping it's sending me in the right direction.</p><p>It feels like hours before I stop walking, I collapse against a tree, finally letting my body rest. The species isn't one I'm familiar with, but it's huge and undoubtedly ancient; I feel something foreign mingle with my magical core, and the tree is the first thing I look at.</p><p>"What was that?" I don't expect an answer, but the strange buzzing that's brushing against my core feels like it gives a strong pulse almost like it's saying hello. It doesn't feel threatening at all, but like it is welcoming me, it's cheerfulness brings hope to my aching heart. Removing my palm from the trunk of the tree, I notice the buzzing gets quieter, almost unnoticeable which explains why I <em>didn't </em>notice it. Frowning, I place my hand back on the tree. Almost instantly the buzz is stronger again, and I do it twice more with the same results.</p><p>"How odd. That's never happened before. I'm assuming this means there's magic in you," I find myself talking to the tree. "Sort of like the wild magic of Earth, only it's more prominent in the nature here."</p><p>
  <em>*Yes, you would be correct. Though I do not know what 'wild magic' is. Here, there's magic all around us. Since you can feel it so strongly that would make you either an elf or an Istari? You do not look like an elf so you must be one of the Istari? Yet you are so young? Why am I speaking to a wizard when I know I cannot be understood? Maybe it is time I find a mate.*</em>
</p><p>I jumped slightly at the sound of hissed words, looking around for the source until finally I am looking up into the tree. On one of the lower branches a medium sized orange snake is wrapped around a branch, looking down at me. I suppose this is what that Lord of the Valar meant when he said I would keep my abilities. It wouldn't hurt to reply back to the snake. Maybe he can show me where Rivendell is.</p><p>
  <em>*Actually, I understand you just fine. Wild magic is the magic of nature, it is difficult to harness or control and most people don't even realize it exists since you cannot feel it under normal circumstances. Yes, I am a wizard, just not one from your world.*</em>
</p><p>
  <em>*You can speak! I have never heard of someone speaking to snakes before. How did you learn the snake language? I didn't know that was possible. It makes sense that you are not from here.*</em>
</p><p>I watch as the snake quickly uncurls from the branch and drops down, before looking back up at me. Kneeling to speak with him easier, I smile slightly.</p><p>
  <em>*If you know the way to Rivendell and can take me there then we can talk about this some more on the way?*</em>
</p><p>
  <em>*Yes, I can do that. Come, follow me. You are going in the wrong direction. Tell me more about this snake language.*</em>
</p><p>I stood back up, following the snake, and began telling him about Hogwarts, my friends and the world I came from; maybe talking about the good days with this snake will keep the nightmares at bay. After all, I came here for a new life. Not to be haunted by the past.</p>
