    <p>Chapter One</p><p>I glowered at the pile of letters in my hand. On the thick, parchment envelope there was an odd crest, a lion, a snake, an eagle, and a badger around an H. It had said 'Miss. A. Smith, The Smallest Bedroom, 15, Pentland St, Wandsworth, London.' This was my exact address, right down to the bedroom.</p><p>Inside the envelope, there was a letter.</p><p>'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Miss. Smith' It had said.<br/>'We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.</p><p>Yours sincerely,<br/>Minerva McGonagall Deputy Headmistress</p><p>I must have received hundreds of them in the past week. I assumed it was someone who was either an enemy or a prankster. I had emailed all of my friends, and they both swore on the River Styx that it wasn't them. This meant quite a lot, considering they were the biggest PJO fans in my entire school. The fact that it wasn't them had far from soothed me. I spoke to nobody else and very few people knew where my house was, only those who shared a street with me.</p><p>Back to the subject of letters, whoever was sending them really wanted them to seem legit. I mean, hundreds of owls had been spotted around the school and I had tried everything to get them to stop, even sending a letter back with a giant NO! No matter what, they would not stop sending them. I did, however, get really excited the first time.</p><p>It was just like it had been in the Harry Potter books, except this wasn't 1991, it was 2020. It was pretty cool, but then I started to get more and more of the letters. I got them every day. As much as I liked Harry Potter (which was a ridiculous amount, my room resembled the Slytherin common room right down to the carpet design), getting these letters was becoming rather tiresome. I mean, Hogwarts would be way better than some muggle high school that I was going to in September. I decided I would just wait it out and see what happened on the 31st of July. </p><p>Those few days were mainly spent reading and drawing. I was pretty good at both.</p><p>The time I didn't spend reading or drawing, I spent alone, in my room. With nothing to distract me from my thoughts, I was almost constantly thinking about the letters. I mean, I had done some pretty weird stuff in my life, most of which was explained away by circumstances and coincidences. The more I thought about it, the more plausible the idea of me being a witch became. That's insane I thought to myself sternly. I was a normal human being and nothing could change that. Nothing at all.</p><p>*   *   *</p><p>The 31st of July started just like any other day. I woke up at eight-ish and read until eleven-ish. Then I went downstairs and had some breakfast. At the table, my Mum was reading the paper and my Dad, a book. I looked at the headlines. 'Mass Panic at Volcano Eruption' 'New Cure For Common Cold?'. The usual stuff. I sighed and looked at my watch. Eleven thirty. I decided to call one of my friends.</p><p>"Hi, you've reached Trinity's phone. If you are hearing this, I am probably doing something awesome, like skydiving. Please call back later."</p><p>"Hi, it's Ash. Just calling to ask if you would like to come round. Please call me back. Thanks." I hung up and sighed. Trinity never checked her phone. I don't think it had been turned on in months. Looked like I would be spending the rest of the day alone. I wasn't that upset, it was how I spent most of my days in the holidays. I realize this may seem a bit sad, but I had a lot of reading to do and didn't always enjoy people's company.</p><p>I grabbed some food and went back up to my room. Once there, I picked up my well-read copy of Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire. I opened it up and turned to page 394. I then began to read. I had only been reading for about twenty minutes when the doorbell rang. I quickly memorized my page number (455) and went downstairs. Unfortunately, due to the way my house was designed, I had to listen from the second floor, because the stairs onto the first floor were visible from the front door.</p><p>A voice that I didn't recognize came from the doorway."Hello, you must be Mrs Smith. I'm here to talk about your daughter, Ashley. She has some rather unusual talents that have earned her a place at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry." <br/>At this, my mother burst out laughing. "Hogwarts! You have got to be kidding me. Did Ash put you up to this? Was it to get out of going to a girls school?" My parents did know a bit about Harry Potter, not much, but enough to get by. In short, they know about Hogwarts.</p><p>The other person spoke again, this time extremely stern, "I don't quite understand why you are laughing, but I would like to see Ashley please." It wasn't a request.<br/>"Fine. She's listening from the stairs." As usual, my mother was correct. I slowly walked down the stairs. Once the person in the door came into view I had to lean against the wall to stop myself from falling. There, in the doorway, was Professor McGonagall. The books got every detail right. Even the shape of her glasses was correct.<br/>"Professor McGonagall. You cannot be real." I pinched myself hard in the arm. She was still standing there, looking very impatient and her lips were pressed together into a thin line. The books had gotten that perfect as well.<br/>"I am quite sure that I am real. I am here to talk to you about going to Hogwarts. Ashley, you are a witch."<br/>This time I did collapse.</p>
