    <p>It was always a bland story to others when Remus and Y/N told people how they became friends, considering it was out of sudden impulse for Remus to request her to sit with him and Y/N not being as prepared for transfiguration as she thought, but if it weren’t for that, they wouldn’t be where they are now;</p>
<p>~</p>
<p> If only the Gryffindor's hadn’t had a winning quidditch match then she would have been able to go to bed at a regular time. But instead, James Potter, someone who she had yet to talk to, hosted another after-party in their common room to celebrate the team's winnings, leaving anyone who wanted a peaceful night disturbed.</p>
<p>She didn’t know why she stayed in the common room, Y/N's conversation skilled lacked and she didn’t know enough people to enjoy a night with friends. Maybe it was just to say she was there, or to find out things that had been going around the school without anyone having to come up and tell her.</p>
<p>  Yet, her decisions were forced to be paid for when she woke up late the next morning, limbs felt heavy as she threw her needed items into her bag, not bothering to review over everything and scurried to her class. The large bag's contents were checked over only when she had arrived at the classroom door, but the absence of a certain item seemed to cause her to fret. </p>
<p>A quill.</p>
<p> ‘Bloody hell’ she thought, looking around the mostly empty classroom to see if anyone could potentially lend her a spare.   Thankfully, her fellow Gryffindor, Remus Lupin seemed to be seated peacefully without the rest of his friends, his eyes focused on the current book he held in his hands. She sighed, shifting her bag to rest higher on her shoulder, holding her chin high as she took small steps to his desk, letting her lips ghost into a smile. </p>
<p>Though it’s not like she hadn’t talked to him before, in comparison to the other students that attended Hogwarts, he could be considered close. They did tend to talk when they found each other near, but it was only ever about the basic discussions, such as how school work has been piling up, or other simplistic things, therefore nothing to consider them friends. </p>
<p>Standing close to his desk, she couldn’t help but feel slightly shy asking for something. Though when she reminded herself it that or not take notes, surely anyone could see the better choice. Tapping her hand on the desk with a soft drum, he looked up at her, flashing a confused smile in her direction, “Oh hey,” He paused for a moment, taking the chance to remember her name, “Y/N right?” He smiled, slightly apologetic.</p>
<p>She nodded, “Hey Remus," She smiled stiffly, "I was just wondering if I could borrow a spare quill? I didn’t end up getting a chance to pack last night after our common room seemed to be incredibly energetic.” </p>
<p>He nodded, turning to rummage through his bag until pulling out a spare, “Here.” He winked, handing it to her flustered self, “Honestly surprised to hear you were actually at a Gryffindor celebration didn’t think it was your scene.”</p>
<p>Y/N looked at him, evidently shocked, “You’ve noticed?”</p>
<p>He shrugged, looking back down at his book before marking the page, shoving it into his bag, “Well yeah, hard to miss when you blush anytime a teacher calls on you.”<br/>
She watched the corners of Remus’ mouth turn upwards as her cheeks grew warm, “Ah well I guess that would make sense. Thank you, Remus, have a good day.” She smiled slightly, turning around to head to one of the empty desks. </p>
<p>The feeling of a hand wrapped around her arm stopped her from advancing more than a few steps, as she turned to see Remus smiling at her, “Sit with me?” He spoke, unsure of himself. Letting go of her arm he ran a hand through his hair, “I’m sure Peter won’t have a problem with changing seats.”</p>
<p>She hummed, looking towards his seat, “And the others?” She questioned, hesitant, “I won’t be invading will I?”</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Remus grabbed her hand and pulling her towards the seat beside his own, “Maybe, but they’ll get over it.” He watched as she sat, taking her bag and setting it beside her, “Think of it as payment for using my quill.”</p>
<p>She laughed, taking out her things, Remus taking his spot beside as he watched her. He didn’t know why he wanted her to sit with him. It wasn’t like he usually invited random people to sit with him, so the exception of Y/N baffled him, though, at the same time, he didn’t regret it, meaning he made the right decision, even if it was more spontaneous than anything. They spent the rest of what little time they had talking and getting to know each other, finding out things they had in common which created easy conversation. Somehow in that amount of time, both had created a special friendship. There was a sense of comfort that both seemed to notice, causing a sense of relaxation between the two.<br/>
James, Sirius, and Peter walked in just before the bell, all heading for their spots until they noticed the girl in Peter’s spot. They watched for a bit as Remus laughed along with something she said, a toothy grin pointed in her direction as she spoke. James was the first to walk up to them, with the other two followings in tow. He smiled at his friend before giving Y/N a confused glace, “Remus who’s this?” He spoke, not taking his eyes off of her.</p>
<p>The other boy rolled his eyes, looking towards Sirius and Peter who seemed to be acting just as weird, “This is Y/N L/N. A fellow Gryffindor that I’ve asked to sit with me.” He spoke as if nothing seemed odd, while Y/N just eyes read ‘help me.’</p>
<p>She smiled at James, shyly sticking out her hand for him to shake before doing the same for the others, “It’s nice to meet the rest of you.” She spoke, just as Professor McGonagall, walked in, telling everyone to sit down for the lesson.</p>
<p> Throughout the entire lecture, Y/N felt eyes burning into her head, seemingly making it hard to completely focus, and the piece of crumpled parchment that fell onto her desk only distracted her more. She looked towards Remus, who quickly glanced at her with a raised eyebrow before turning back to the Professor. Frowning, she slowly unfolded it to find the messy scroll of Sirius’ handwriting. </p>
<p>‘So how’d a beauty like you find Remus anyway?’ She read, and couldn’t help but snicker at before folding it up and shoving it in her pocket. She turned to Sirius, winking at him before turning back to the front, leaving him stunned, and intrigued by her. Needless to say, the only thing he found out from the lesson was that he wanted to get to know Y/N.<br/>
From where he sat, Sirius could only see her side profile, but it was enough for him to focus on her eyes, a brilliant colour he found himself bewitched by. He noticed that when Professor McGonagall said for them to begin practicing the Gemino spell, she turned to Remus, whispering to him about something before he laughed.</p>
<p> Sirius was completely baffled, quickly turning towards James who paid no mind to it, then to Peter who was to busy trying to figure out the spell than to be curious about her. Clearly frustrated, he set his head down on the desk, watching them as they did the spell together, noticing the smile that crossed her face as she cast it successfully.</p>
<p> By the time class let up, Sirius was fascinated that this girl had looked passed him. Sure she was focused on one of his best mate’s, but it didn’t help that she didn’t even reply to his note.</p>
<p>  He watched as Y/N talked to Remus, waving at him slightly before walking off to wherever. His eyes followed as Remus joined them with a light smile on his face, trying to answer any questions he could about her before Sirius spoke one of his own;</p>
<p> “Will we be seeing her again?” </p>
<p>He looked to where she left, “Maybe not right away.” He shrugged nonchalantly, a smile tugging at the corners of his lips before he gathered his things, paying no attention to his friends as they watching him place the items into his bag. Watching as he picked up the borrowed quill and smiled, “So you guys understand if I’m around less than?”<br/>
James smiled, throwing his arm around Remus, “Aye Remus, you sure seemed to get along with her then?” He teased, to which the only response he got was him ducking his head down, a light pink ghosting his cheeks, “I’d say we’d understand plenty.” He winked.</p>
<p>Sirius nodded along, still pondering about how she wouldn’t be making another appearance anytime soon. For some reason, like Remus, she seemed to have drawn his interest without really knowing her. After all, she practically ignored his first attempt of flirting, something many others would swoon over.<br/>
He wanted to know her, even if it meant he would have to wait.</p>
