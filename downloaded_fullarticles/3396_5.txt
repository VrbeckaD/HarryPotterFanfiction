    <p>IGNORE THE FACT THAT IT SAYS 1/1 THERE WILL BE MORE CHAPTERS IDK WHY IT DOES THAT!!!!! Hi everyone! I’m just going to put in this chapter to introduce myself and talk about this fic before I start posting the story itself. So the characters all belong the J.K Rowling’s Harry Potter universe. I wanted to do a “dirty Laundry” type fic but for wolf star instead!<br/>
I hope u all enjoy and I will put warning if they’re are any triggers in specific chapters. </p><p>Enjoy :)</p>
