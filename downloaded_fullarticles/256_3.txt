    <p>It was late. The only light was a near full moon in the sky highlighting your silhouette against a gravestone. Regardless of the darkness you could see clearly in front of you, which was, at least, odd. The mist on your breath indicated that the temperature was low, however you didn’t feel the cold. Another unexplained nod to your true nature perhaps?</p><p>Ye gods he was taking ages with this. It is like he is deliberately trying to inconvenience you.</p><p><em>I hate this</em>. You thought for the 100th time.</p><p><em>Yeah well, it’s all you’re good for so suck it up</em>. Another voice played in your head.</p><p>The problem with you was that you tried very hard to distance yourself from your past. Very hard. How much distance would it take? Especially as you really didn’t know that much of your past to begin with.</p><p>As you waited in the deserted graveyard a prickling sensation you did not like swept up your neck. It wasn’t the crows - you didn’t mind them per-say you even admired their bold plumage and haunting eyes. It wasn’t their fault they embodied dark feathered nightmares in every children’s tale ever read, but their constant scuttling through leaves, foraging for worms and mice was distracting and masking other more sinister movements. You felt like you were being watched.</p><p>“For fucks sake! Hurry up Macnair!” You growled loudly to yourself. “I haven’t got all day.”</p><p>A wheezy chuckle sounded behind a large mausoleum where Macnair revealed himself in the moonlight.</p><p>“You’ve been watching me Walden!” You heavily emphasised his first name, knowing he disliked being addressed as such. “What, didn’t believe I would be alone?”<br/> He scowled at you and merely shrugged. “Can’t be too careful Y/L/N, you might have turned.”</p><p>A tight menacing laugh spilled out of your mouth. “The Dark Lord holds me in high regard, Macnair. I would have thought that’d be good enough for you.”</p><p>Macnair scowled at the reminder that you outranked him at more than half his age. He was not used to being usurped and the fact Voldemort asked of you more important, more dangerous tasks while he was left squabbling over the scraps did not sit well with him at all. He used every chance to get ahead and finally had been thrown a bone. Tonight you were summoned to meet Macnair and collect a package. He was reviling in his 15 minutes of favouritism and he seemed determined to undermine you at every step of the way.</p><p>“The Dark Lord hasn’t heard everything about your school days Y/L/N. He would have found your alternative ‘influence’ a lot less palatable than I have.”</p><p>You grimaced knowing what he was referring to. It’s true you had been different in school. Not the cold, calculating witch he saw never faltering under Voldemort’s rule. You were small, skinny and weak looking, a little strange, and prone to outbursts. He particularly disapproved of your tendency to talk about the delusion of purist mania, and how wizard kind would benefit from muggles instead of incessantly inbreeding until magic dies out. No one told you this would earn you one of the foulest punishments you had ever endured by your own house mates. You clutched at your throat momentarily.</p><p>You learnt the right way to live in this world soon after.</p><p>Macnair continued on, getting more and more passionate as well as louder about how he was a better Death Eater than you. You ignored him, caught deep in your memories. He had touched a nerve. <em>Was I really that transparent? There is no way this moron could know?</em> The Dark Lord didn’t know. Heck, you didn’t even really know.</p><p>You started to mentally take stock of your life as Macnair prattled on.</p><p>You were a young woman. You looked normal, pretty even. You tried to behave normally however:<br/> -Things burn when you get angry<br/> -You can see in the dark and never feel the cold.<br/> -You can manipulate peoples emotions by making them feel horrible, terrified, and hopeless however you cannot make people feel happiness<br/> -Strange symbols, and pictures appear on your skin whenever you are scared<br/> -You were twelve years old when you first conjured all the animals in proximity and set them on a boy in your year for pulling your hair and that scared everyone around you to start throwing out words such as ‘dark magic,’ and ‘locked up.’ You had never done that since.<br/> -You had no idea how you had these ‘gifts’ as Voldemort called them<br/> -You didn’t know who you were except that…</p><p>You were an orphan. You were a Slytherin. You were a Death Eater.</p><p>Plagues of memories, shattered glimpses of your past flashed through your mind. How were you supposed to know who you were if you didn’t know where you came from?</p><p>No photos, no lasting family heirlooms, just jolted memories here and there of orphanages and foster homes to piece together your origins.</p><p>In a happier time, you used to believe that you would find yourself happy and content, filled with warmth from a loving family. However, as soon as you turned eleven, something dark began to grow. It was though these gifts were not yours but belonged to a living creature buried deep inside, a sleeping dragon lying dormant - perhaps forever - but the first day you held your first wand she awoke, sparked a fire in your stomach and slowly filling your heart with lead.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Meanwhile…</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Sirius kicked a stray pebble with his boot, it bounced along the footpath until it hit a loose cobblestone and ricocheted into a high stone fence. He was bored, Remus could tell. They had been on duty for the Order ten nights in a row, scouring the streets of London for suspicious activity, yet found nothing. Remus surmised that this was a good thing. Sirius, on the other hand, thought they weren’t looking hard enough.</p><p>“Alright Pads, let’s move…” Remus stopped mid sentence noticing Sirius had suddenly gone stock still, ear cocked to his left.</p><p>“Shhh Moony, I hear something!” Remus listened carefully. For a while he only heard and saw his and Sirius’ breaths in the crisp night air until an unmistakeable chatter was rising higher and higher as if two people were arguing.</p><p>Sirius looked at Remus, eyes gleaming with excitement. “You know the drill? Got to check it out!”</p><p>Remus nodded slowly and followed Sirius along the stone fence line, coming to an entrance bordered by two large and rather rusty wrought iron gates, grotesque gargoyles standing sentinel either-side.</p><p>As they crossed the gates they looked around at what was a very old cemetery. Sirius looked at Remus and jabbed his head to the right before scrambling between two gravestones and further into the dark. After five minutes of tip-toeing behind tombs, trees, and statues, Remus and Sirius located the sound of their quarry. They could clearly hear a conversation between two people standing on the other side of the large mausoleum blocking both parties from seeing each other.</p><p>Remus crouched low, pressing his back against the door of the mausoleum listening carefully. Did he recognise one of the voices? Sirius, not content with just listening was twisting his body around the tomb to get a better look. In his attempt he had not noticed that he had snagged a low hanging tree branch on his leather jacket, and continued moving forward. A sharp pop rang through the air as the branch broke startling the two arguing who had so far not noticed anyone approach. Sirius slammed his back, back against the mausoleum grimacing at Remus who slowly shook his head with distain. He mouthed “Sit still” at Sirius, who shrugged but did not make effort to move again, both men listening intently to the reactions of Sirius’ mistake.</p><p>———</p><p>“What was that?” You demanded? “You bought friends, Macnair?”<br/> “What? No I can handle this job on my own!”</p><p>You both frowned at each other before turning to look at a large stone tomb on your right. Something or someone was there. You had both heard it. Was it an animal? You cast a spell revealing if enemies where around you yet nothing happened. It must have been another crow, You shivered, feeling the hairs on the back of your neck stand up for the second time. There it was again, the unsettling sensation that you were being watched. The sooner you got out of this place and finished your business the better.</p><p>“Hurry up Macnair” you turned back to him. “You’ve gone on long enough, probably alerted half of London to our presence. Now, to what do I owe the pleasure? Why did the Dark Lord send you to meet me here tonight?”</p><p>Macnair grumbled, looking at you with a sneer before reaching into his robes…</p><p>———-</p><p>Remus furrowed his brows. That voice sounded familiar. Macnair was a Death Eater but who was the woman he was talking to and why did Remus…..oh god! It’s Y/N. Remus started to panic. He could see Sirius shaking with anticipation out of the corner of his eye. They were about to come face to face with Y/N - this would not go down well, they were no match for her - everyone would know.</p><p>He calculated his options not noticing Sirius had started to move again. Realising Sirius was about to interrupt what he thought was merely a tame Death Eater meeting he frantically tried to get Sirius’ attention by waving his hands erratically in front of him but Sirius was focused - he had found a gap between graves and was now locked on his prey like a bloodhound.</p><p>——-</p><p>“…I was asked to give you this.” Macnair pulled out a small package from inside his robes pausing before handing it to you. “The Dark Lord was most instant that only you should open this as only you with your, history, would know what it was.”</p><p>Could this be it? The clue that broke the mysteries of your past? Explain the darkness within? You eyed the package greedily, eyes flashing purple before you swallowed and took a deep breath. The desire to know what was inside you almost overran your rational thoughts.</p><p>Why would Voldemort be taking an interest in your past? What did he know? Was it to use you as a force, a weapon only to discard you later like he did most of his followers? You couldn’t let that happen. However strong the desire to know, the desire of self preservation was stronger.</p><p>As if sensing your deliberation, Macnair started pulling back at the same time the hairs on the back or your neck stood up, so fast they almost pinched you. You heard a whoosh and felt yourself lifting into the air and thrown back at force hitting your head on the hard ground, causing you to lose your grip on your wand.</p><p>Macnair turned on the spot, ducking from another curse with surprising ability for an old man. The words “Black!” And “Werewolf” reached your crumpled heap as you pulled your self off the ground. So you were being watched, by Order members.</p><p>“Nice to see you Macnair! My you are looking fat - been sitting on your arse too much lately? Not Voldemort’s best friend yet?” Sirius Black’s laugh was vivid in his jest - Geez you thought, rubbing your skull - he knew how to hit a nerve.</p><p>Macnair cried out in anger, ducked again as another curse flew towards him before lunging at Sirius, conjuring a large whip and slashing it across his back. Sirius was thrown onto his knees before Macnair had him up in the air, held at the neck by an invisible force.</p><p>Before you could get up Remus Lupin was hovering above you pointing his wand at your chest looking panicked. You locked eyes with him as you sat on the ground desperately fumbling behind you for your wand. Why wasn’t he doing anything? You frowned into his face almost daring him to hex you half listening to Macnair taunting Sirius who was now being choked by whatever was holding him up.</p><p>“Not so cocky now, are you Black?” Macnair sniggered up at him,</p><p>“Well…” spluttered Sirius “I have my moments.” One hand grasping at the clasp around his neck he used the other to point his wand at Macnair. It glowed brightly and then suddenly a large fireball emerged heading straight towards Macnair’s wand hand, lighting it up in flames.</p><p>At once, Macnair’s curse was broken and Sirius fell to the ground grasping for breath. While Macnair rolled around around in agony. Remus gave you once last look before sprinting over to his friend grabbing his arm hurriedly whispering, “we have to get out of here!”</p><p>“What?” Sirius threw him a shocked face, one hand still massaging his neck.</p><p>“I’ll explain later, now move!” Before they could a large body of water dropped from above, putting out the fire on Macnair’s arm and drenching Sirius and Remus, while you walked towards them holding the back of your head.</p><p>“MY WAND!” Macnair screamed with fury. It was burnt to a crisp. Whatever fire Sirius used was not normal. Sirius was quickly regaining his breath and looking at you with intent to fight.</p><p>If you had had time you might have been impressed, but with a quick glance at Remus, you turned your wand on Sirius and cast the cruciatus curse. He fell to the floor writhing in agony. The darkness inside was moving - swirling round and tempting eruption. You braced yourself, waiting. Remus’ hex whipped through your body temporarily winding you and breaking the curse on Sirius.</p><p>You grabbed Macnair’s arm, not hearing his screams of protest. The last sight you saw was Sirius coughing on his back, and Remus crouched down next to him but looking at you with an expression akin to sorrow and understanding as you twisted into the darkness and disappeared.</p>
