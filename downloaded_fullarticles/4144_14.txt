    <p>I have recently developed an addiction to reading Soul-Identifying Mark fanfictions, and I thought, why not write my own version, especially since my head’s brimming with many storylines and couplings.</p><p>So, a few notes before proceeding:</p><p>1)      I am going to start out by being totally honest (spoilers), but I am a MAJORLY HUGE <u>TEAMIRONMAN</u> fan! I am, and always will be, Tony Stark’s defender and protector and worshipper. So Tony Stark will be the main star for this new fanfic of mine. I’m not saying every chapter is going to be <em>exclusively </em>Tony paired with someone, there are gonna be various couplings, but heads up, Tony will be a major recurrence.</p><p>2)      Bear my ramblings, as it is an important index to future chapters: I hate how Captain America: Civil War ended, and I hate how everyone misjudges and backstabs Tony Stark. In fact, there are a lot of plots in MCU that I hate in relation to Tony. Steve Rogers’ holier than thou attitude, along with the fact that he can lie to everyone but no one can lie to him? Yeah, big <em>no-no</em>! How Sam Wilson <em>blindly</em> follows Cap, just because? Another <em>no</em>! Natasha Romanoff repeatedly backstabbing Tony. Oh, and let’s not forget how in Avengers: Age of Ultron nobody bothered to think the creation of Ultron through – they immediately accepted and forgave the Maximoff twins (most especially Wanda) and never once thought of Wanda manipulating Tony into creating Ultron. I mean, Tony is the King of Artificial Intelligences, how the hell did they not find Tony’s Ultron screw up suspicious? And BTW, I completely agree with the Sokovia Accords, and while Bucky Barnes is my second favorite character in MCU, let’s be real here, the whole point of The Civil War was Steve trying to protect Bucky over anything else, damn the consequences and the collateral damage! He basically said ‘fuck you’ to 117 countries… Not really feeling the righteousness here, Cap! So… the point of this ginormous ranter, is this: I will <em>try</em> not to biased. While I do believe the sun shines out Tony Stark’s ass, I will be fair. Some of the short-fics will have a few bashings, but some won’t. Basically, I will respect all the characters and portray them in a good light (depending on the plot for each short-fic, and the coupling).</p><p>3)      Each coupling will include a character from MCU. <em>However</em>, it isn't strictly MCU. I will be including various characters from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., the Fantastic Four, X-Men, etc. Also, I will randomly mix &amp; match characters from different Universes, such as Harry Potter, The Vampire Diaries, heck, maybe even Tolkien! You never know. But keep in mind that not all of the short-fics will correspond with canon, some might, but most of them <em>will</em> contradict the events.</p><p>4)      <u>Requests</u> <em>will</em> be taken into consideration! If there is a pairing you’d like to see, leave me a review and I’ll work on creating and posting the storyline. If there’s any reason I am unable to accept your pairing request, I’ll let you know along with my reason. <u>Requests</u> for a continuation of a certain story will be taken into consideration as well. If a certain short-fic ended and you’d like to see more, again, let me know and I will continue it in a later chapter. Keep in mind, that if a certain plot between two characters is not to your liking, I will be including many plots for the same pairings – this isn't exclusively a one chapter per couple fanfiction.</p><p>All that’s left to say is: Enjoy! XD</p>
