    <p>There were so many tasks to attend to after the battle that no one really had a good idea of where to start. Those who had fought were too weary to launch into a full scale repair of their world. The ones who hadn't fought, the rest of the wizarding world at large, were too shocked at the realization that it was over to even consider what would come next. </p><p>First, the dead had to be buried and memorialized. That was a far more extensive logistical challenge than might have been expected, but Hermione Granger and Professor McGonagall teamed up to complete the task with unanimous support from those left standing. In tandem with their effort to deliver the deceased to remaining family members, the two women also drew up plans for both the memorial service and a memorial monolith, inscribed with the names of those who fell.</p><p>Harry Potter, having now completed his destiny, watched all of the proceedings with a sort of detachment. He helped anyone that required the extra hands or wand, but the actions felt hollow and purposeless, even when he knew full well how purposeful they were. Over the week following Voldemort's death, Harry found himself repairing castle walls, helping Aurors deliver the dead to their family, and preparing documents about the battle and the casualties for Ministry records.</p><p>It was Molly Weasley who eventually put her foot down, yanking Harry away from a large group of people rebuilding one of the staircases.</p><p>"Mrs. Weasley," Harry started, intending to argue with her, but he stopped as soon as he caught sight of her expression.</p><p>"Harry dear, you cannot fix everything You-Know-Who destroyed by sheer force of will." Her face was stern, but with the undercurrent of love that Harry had always felt from her.</p><p>"I know that," Harry countered, though he didn't really have any arguments against her assumption of his intent. "If I don't do something though, I'm just going to end up wallowing, and I can't do that." What exactly he would be wallowing in, he couldn't say. Grief was there, but it was washing over him in sporadic waves. The larger sensation he was dodging was the sense of uselessness he now felt. Voldemort was dead. Harry had fulfilled the prophecy. What came next was anybody's guess, and Harry was not ready to give the topic proper thought.</p><p>Mrs. Weasley considered him for a moment, then nodded her understanding. "All right, well, I'm going to insist that you go take a break then. Just for a bit. If you feel that it's too much, you can come find yourself a job again, but I've watched you work yourself ragged for days now, and I'm not going to stand for it. Find someplace quiet and rest. Please, Harry."</p><p>Harry couldn't argue against genuine concern for his well fare, so he just nodded, watching as Mrs. Weasley moved off in the general direction of the kitchens. The kitchens, at least, had survived intact. In fact, nearly all of the house elves had returned to work the moment the battle was over. Hermione had been shocked to discover as much, but after a visit to the kitchens was forced to admit that the house elves genuinely wanted to be there. As one elf had put it, preparing the food was the least they could do to benefit those who had fought to save the world.</p><p>That was just one of any number of humbling things Harry had heard since the final confrontation. His friends and those he considered family knew him well enough to know not to heap praise upon his shoulders, but nobody else seemed to understand how that sort of thing made him feel. In that way, Mrs. Weasley's suggestion of a quiet place to rest was an enticing one. He could return to his bed in Gryffindor tower, but any number of people knew to find him there if they needed him, and being found wasn't as appealing at the moment as it would have been earlier. Now that he was considering a break, he found that he wanted a moment's peace more than anything.</p><p>"Potter?" Professor McGonagall's voice came from behind him, and Harry turned to see the older woman standing with a large bundle of scrolls. "Are you all right?" She asked, raising an eyebrow at him. Professor McGonagall, more so than perhaps anyone else, had made Harry feel incredible normal in the last few days, and he was overwhelmingly grateful to her for it. He wasn't the saviour, the hero, or the Chosen One to her. He was just Harry Potter, her slightly troublesome Gryffindor student. Or, perhaps, he was all of the above, and she just knew better than to remind him of it.</p><p>Smiling at her, Harry nodded. "Yeah, just thinking. Mrs. Weasley's making me rest a bit before she'll let me get back to work. She thinks I'm doing too much."</p><p>Professor McGonagall made a noise that might have been a snort of amusement. "Yes, well, you are. Where exactly are you planning to sequester yourself?" She knew as well as he did how unlikely he was to find peace in a castle full of people singing his praises.</p><p>Harry blinked at her and gave a helpless shrug. "I've no idea," he admitted.</p><p>Her lips twitching in amusement, Professor McGonagall gestured for him to follow her. "I think you'll find my new study comfortable enough," she said, her tone leaving no room for argument.</p><p>Harry almost stopped in his tracks, but decided to go along with her anyway. In a unanimous move that surprised no one, Professor McGonagall had been named headmistress of Hogwarts. Really, with the school year having been interrupted as it had been, who was in charge didn't really matter, but it made everyone feel better knowing that the school was officially in good hands. Professor McGonagall had split her time between dealing with all the logistics of the memorials and organizing school repairs. Her new office, once Dumbledore's, had only needed a few repairs, and once fixed had remaining largely unused since her appointment. She and Hermione had taken to working on the move, as either one of them was constantly being called away to help somewhere else.</p><p>"I did change the password," she admitted, looking a little hesitant and glancing in Harry's direction as though worried he might object.</p><p>"Of course," Harry allowed, not surprised in the slightest. He doubted very much that Professor McGonagall intended to use names of sweets for passwords, and he was proven correct as they arrived in front of the freshly repaired gargoyle that guarded the study.</p><p>"Harry James Potter," she said clearly to the gargoyle, before turning to Harry with a raised eyebrow as the entrance opened. She seemed to be daring him to make a comment.</p><p>Coming from anyone else, that sort of obvious commendation would have made Harry uncomfortable. Coming from Professor McGonagall, it was nothing more than an honour. "Thank you," he told her fervently, knowing she would recognize it as gratitude for both the use of the study and the recognition she had given him.</p><p>"Of course, Potter," Professor McGongagall replied, a small smile on her lips. She turned and walked away with her scrolls, leaving Harry in the entry to the study.</p><p>"Back again?" A few paintings asked him. All of the former headmasters and headmistresses who were awake were looking at him with keen interest.</p><p>Harry had expected that, but the paintings didn't feel as invasive as the actual people in the castle did. "Professor McGongagall suggested it. Apparently I've been working too hard." His eyes strayed to Dumbledore's painting, and he was both relieved and disappointed to find the former headmaster asleep. There was a blank space on the wall near Dumbledore's portrait that was already reserved for a portrait of Severus Snape, but the painting hadn't been completed yet. Professor McGongall expected to be able to add it to the office soon. Again, Harry was both relieved and disappointed to not be able to speak to Snape either. He both craved the opportunity to speak to his former professor and hoped to never have to speak to him.</p><p>Those were not the sort of thoughts that would allow him to rest, so Harry ignored the paintings and took a seat in one of the many empty chairs, studying the grandeur of the study around him. He'd always liked this room. It was intimidating because it had been Dumbledore's, but there was so much to look at and such endless fascination in the room that it had always inspired curiosity in him. Professor McGonagall hadn't really changed anything yet, other than preparing a space for Snape's portrait. Harry wondered if she would leave the study as it was in honour of Dumbledore, as Snape had done, or if she would make it her own. Harry suspected there would be some combination of the two paths. After all, Dumbledore wouldn't want his metaphorical ghost preventing anyone from moving on.</p><p>"So, when are you taking your holiday?" One of the paintings asked. It was a sort of round man with an especially large chin and expressive eyes. His nose was almost as wide as his mouth, and he had more laughter lines than nearly anyone Harry had ever seen before. The young wizard had no idea whose portrait it was, but it didn't really matter.</p><p>"There's too much to do," Harry explained to the painting. "I'm just here for a breather, then I'll be back to work."</p><p>The painting clicked his tongue at Harry in disapproval. "Now, now, you've just had one of the most stressful years imaginable. You of all people deserve a break."</p><p>Harry felt a little insulted on behalf of the rest of the wizarding world. "People have died," he said shortly. "The castle's a wreck, the Ministry is trying to recover, and who knows how many other tasks need doing? I spent last year on the run. Yes, it was hard, and yes, it was worth it, but I don't get to go have a holiday just because I finally managed to complete my quest."</p><p>The man with the laughter lines was giving Harry an appraising look. "I believe that it is the best reason to have a holiday," he said firmly. He continued before Harry could argue with him, "There will be many demands of you now, will there not? I expect everyone will want a piece of the Chosen One, and you're the type of person to give all of yourself until you've nothing left. You should take some time to yourself before you wither away at the hands of all you've saved."</p><p>Harry wanted to debate the painting, but felt like he didn't quite have a leg to stand on. It was true, of course. He would do anything he could to help rebuild the wizarding world that had been so destroyed during Voldemort's time in power. Without someone to pull him aside and make him take a break, like Mrs. Weasley, he would probably end up helping until he dropped dead of exhaustion. Harry mulled over the idea in his head, still finding an aversion within him to the idea of taking a proper holiday.</p><p>"It's worth noting," the painting concluded, seeming to think he'd won, "that a holiday doesn't have to be a good lie in at a beach resort. Perhaps you should just take some time to go do something you really want to do."</p><p>That was the question then, wasn't it? Harry felt a sort of wry amusement as he considered it. What did he really want to do?</p><hr/><p>Harry didn't end up returning to the hustle and bustle of the castle until early evening, feeling genuinely refreshed from a few hours of quiet. He'd only just come down the stairs when he walked headfirst into Ron and George Weasley, who were deep in conversation.</p><p>"Hello, Harry!" George said brightly. He was alternating between moments of his old humour and moments of deep sadness, but seemed determined to allow the former to outweigh the latter. "Where've you been?"</p><p>"Your mum insisted I take a break," Harry admitted, scratching absently at the hair at the back of his neck. "I think she was probably right."</p><p>"She usually is," Ron agreed, looking a little envious at the idea of relaxing for a while.</p><p>"Did you have a good time introspecting?" George asked, giving Harry a look of intense appraisal that was offset by his smile.</p><p>Harry let out a short chuckle. "The paintings in the study seem to agree with your mum and Professor McGonagall. Apparently I'm working too hard and could do with some rest."</p><p>Ron shrugged. "Well you did save the bloody world," he pointed out dryly. "Seems like you could justify a little time off."</p><p>"I had help," Harry reminded Ron pointedly. "Besides, as I keep telling everyone, there's too much to do."</p><p>George rolled his eyes. "There's always going to be loads to do, Harry. If you do all of it now, you'll just drop dead. Then where will we all be?" His eyes widened in dramatic horror.</p><p>Ron interjected before Harry could. "Look, mate, I get what you're saying. We've all been working to rebuild, but you've been doing more than most of us combined. Why don't you talk to Kingsley? He's started helping Professor McGonagall break down who should be in charge of what, so a lot of people are going to be leaving the castle for other jobs soon anyway. I'm sure he can give you some advice regarding both a break and a reasonable job for you once you've relaxed a bit."</p><p>"I think you're meant to be calling him the Minister now," George said mildly.</p><p>"Oh, yeah," Ron agreed, not looking remotely chastised.</p><p>"Good idea," Harry said absently. He thanked the two ginger brothers and watched them continue on, hearing snatches of a conversation that seemed to be about Diagon Alley as they walked away.</p><p>Looking for Kingsley Shacklebolt was actually a good idea, and Harry was grateful for the sense of direction. Since being appointed Minister for Magic, Kingsley had been working overtime to both get the Ministry back into shape and organize everyone willing to help into actually useful teams of people. The question was where to find him. Harry could send his Patronus looking for him, but that seemed a little showy for a simple conversation. Most of the work in the castle had come to a halt for the evening meal, so Harry took a cursory lap around the corridors to make sure Kingsley wasn't still out working on something before he headed into the Great Hall. He spotted Hermione right away, deep in conversation with Professor McGonagall, which was normal now. He had other friends scattered throughout the room, but many of his fellow students had already been sent home to be with their families. Luna Lovegood, though she'd wanted to stay and help with the castle, had returned to her father once the battle was over. No one begrudged her that. Neville Longbottom and his grandmother were both still in the castle, helping with repairs. Harry had been concerned at first that all of the destruction caused by dark magic would be irreparable, but he'd been assured that Hogwarts had long been protected against the sort of permanent destruction dark magic might have the power to wreak elsewhere. The walls may have been destroyed, but they could be repaired. Professor McGonagall was adamant that the castle would be properly restored to its original glory.</p><p>Harry noted a few absences at the tables as he gazed about the room, but he knew where most of the people in question had gone. Back to their homes, to other jobs, or just away from the castle and the memories of war. The Malfoys, surprisingly enough, had remaining in the castle for nearly a full day before fleeing to their home. Harry hadn't spoken to any of them before they left, but he'd exchanged glances with Draco once or twice, and nodded once to Narcissa. He had an odd sense of gratitude and animosity towards them both, and he was willing to let that particular conflict end if they were. Lucius, on the other hand, Harry felt certain he would always hate. As he hadn't conversed with any of the Malfoys, it hadn't mattered. He'd likely see Draco at some point in the future, but it wasn't something he felt the need to dwell on.</p><p>Deciding to make his way towards Neville, Harry was halfway to his friend when he spotted Kingsley, sitting by himself at the end of one of the tables. He was near a few other Aurors and having cursory conversation with them, but wasn't actually eating with them.</p><p>"Mind if I sit?" Harry asked, approaching quickly.</p><p>Kingsley looked up, an expression of mild surprise on his face chased away by genuine welcome. "Of course. Please, join me."</p><p>Harry took the seat opposite the new Minister for Magic, not even blinking as his plate suddenly filled with his favourite foods. He didn't fully understand house elf magic, but he most definitely appreciated it.</p><p>"How can I help you, Harry?" Kingsley asked, giving Harry a curious once over.</p><p>Harry gnawed on the inside of his cheek for a split second before subtly pulling his wand out and murmuring, "<em>Muffliato</em>," at the Aurors. None of them so much as blinked, and Harry relaxed a little. He glanced up to see Kingsley raising an eyebrow at him, and Harry felt himself shrug. "Don't want to be overheard, I suppose."</p><p>"That's fair," Kingsley allowed. "Is this an important matter?"</p><p>"Not really. Or, well, just to me." Harry paused, tucking his wand away and trying to determine how to begin. "You're trying to assign wizards and witches to specific jobs, right? Give everyone something to do?"</p><p>Kingsley nodded, swallowing down a bite of mashed potatoes. "From what I've seen, Harry, you have no trouble finding work to keep you busy."</p><p>Harry nodded, feeling more resolved now that he realized even the Minister had noticed his actions. "About that. It seems a few people worried about my well being seem to think I need to take it easy for a while."</p><p>"I agree," Kingsley said, taking another bite of a few things on his plate and meeting Harry's gaze with a level stare.</p><p>"Right," Harry acknowledged, unsurprised. "See, the thing is, I don't want to just run off for myself when there's so much to do. One of the paintings in the headmaster's study - er, headmistress, I mean - said that a holiday can just be me doing something I want to do, but what I want to do is be helpful."</p><p>Kingsley chuckled. "Harry, I know this isn't what you want to hear, but you could retire and never lift your wand again, and no one would care. You saved the world. Anything else is really just overkill."</p><p>Harry scowled. "That's the last thing I want to do."</p><p>"I know," Kingsley consoled him. "I know we don't know each other well, Harry, but I feel I've got the measure of you. If not from personal experience, certainly from hearing about your many virtues from those who cared about you."</p><p>Harry didn't need the past tense to know he meant Sirius, Dumbledore, Lupin, and perhaps others as well. He cleared his throat, determined not to let grief sidetrack him just yet. "So what do I do? You're the Minister now. The Ministry's always had something they wanted me for. I mean, not that I've ever gone along with it, but if there was any administration I'd be likely to work for it'd be yours."</p><p>Kingsley laughed and shot Harry an appreciative grin. "I appreciate the support, Harry. As it happens, I was under the impression you wanted to become an Auror."</p><p>Harry looked startled at the reminder, but nodded. "Yeah. I took all the required classes last year, but obviously I never took my NEWTs."</p><p>"I think Professor McGonagall has a plan to catch up all the students who missed this past year at Hogwarts," Kingsley informed him, "but that's not really my concern. I'm perfectly happy to give you the necessary examination to introduce you as a junior Auror."</p><p>"When can I start?" Harry asked, excitement flooding him for the first time in what felt like weeks.</p><p>Kingsley shook his head and waved his fork in Harry's direction. "Not yet, Harry, I thought you needed a holiday first? I'm just letting you know that I've got a sense of purpose waiting for you when you've finished your sabbatical."</p><p>Harry made a face and glanced down, realizing he hadn't touched his dinner yet. He began to spear a few articles of food with the fork, then looked up at Kingsley. "If I'm going to take a break," he said, stressing the 'if,' "I need to be accomplishing something, and I need to be away from hordes of people that are going to want to thank me."</p><p>Kingsley looked sympathetic. "Harry, I imagine you'll be dealing with crowds like that for the rest of your life."</p><p>"I know that," Harry assured him quickly. "I don't even want to begrudge people the ability. It's just, if I need a break from anything, it's the overwhelming gratitude."</p><p>"Perfectly understandable," Kingsley assured him. "Why don't you take a week or so and go flying around the country? You can even make reports on what you see if you feel like pretending it's an assignment. I'm sure we could use that information in some department or other. You can use that cloak of yours to avoid attention."</p><p>Harry felt the sinking sensation in his stomach as he thought about his lost Firebolt for the first time in months. "I don't have a broom anymore," he admitted wearily. "I lost it that night everyone came to get me in Surrey."</p><p>Kingsley looked genuinely regretful at this news. "I'm sorry, Harry, I didn't realize. Sirius gave you that broom, didn't he?"</p><p>Harry nodded, a lump in his throat. He had some memories of his godfather besides the broom of course, but the broom was one of his favourite possessions, and a glimpse into the sort of life he could have had if everything had been different.</p><p>"Maybe that's your mission there, then," Kingsley mused, looking thoughtful. "We were attacked almost immediately upon take off, so you couldn't have lost it too far from the house."</p><p>"No, probably not. It's definitely within Surrey somewhere, at any rate," Harry acknowledged. "Do you really think I can find it?"</p><p>"It might be as simple as a summoning charm," Kingsley suggested. "I hear you've succeeded with that before." He winked at the younger wizard and returned his attention to his plate.</p><p>Harry twirled his fork around, considering the proposal. "It feels selfish," he finally said. "Leaving when everything's in chaos to go looking for my lost broom."</p><p>"Fine." Kingsley straightened up, and gave Harry a very serious look that felt like it might be pinning him to the bench. "Harry Potter, as Minister for Magic, I hereby order you to take a minimum of two weeks to go locate and recover your broom. At the end of those two weeks, you may report to the Ministry for Auror training, which I will conduct personally."</p><p>Harry felt a flood of affection for the Minister, who had in a few words given Harry exactly the justification he needed to get away from the wizarding world for just a little bit, knowing that he would return with both a purpose and a treasured possession. "Personally?" He asked, a little surprised by that addition. "The Minister has time to personally train new Aurors?"</p><p>Kingsley waved off the concern. "I've got two weeks to make the time," he said, not sounding concerned about it. "Besides, rebuilding the Auror Office is going to be a top priority within the Ministry. Having you alongside will only help. If you'd like, I can make an announcement that I've sent you on a mission for the Ministry, since I have. That'll keep people from worrying about your absence."</p><p>"Thank you, Minister," Harry said fervently. Catching Kingsley's stern glance, Harry coughed once and corrected himself, "Kingsley, I mean."</p><p>"Thank <em>you</em>, Harry," Kingsley returned, giving the younger wizard a parting wink before returning to his food.</p><p>Harry quickly reversed his earlier spell and devoured his dinner, realizing abruptly that he'd been starving. Once finished, he waved a final farewell to Kingsley before getting up to go find the people who needed to know he was leaving. </p><p> </p>
