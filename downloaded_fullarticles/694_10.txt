    <p align="justify">Theseus froze when a swift arrow flew just under his nose and embedded itself in the bark. It had taken him by surprise, so he was lucky no real assassination attempt was actually taking place.</p><p align="justify">Turning in the direction the arrow had come from he crossed his arms over his chest, raising an eyebrow. “Newt! Are you trying to kill me now?”</p><p align="justify">“Sorry,” The bushes answered in a sarcastic tone “didn’t see you under all that beard.”</p><p align="justify">The greenery parted and out stepped a young, lean man holding a bow. His full mouth was slightly curled upwards in a candid smile. Not for the first time, Theseus’ breath caught momentarily at the sight of him, drinking in with hungry eyes the peppering of freckles over the rosy skin and flaming red hair.</p><p align="justify">“Wait a second!” He rushed to the boy, extending his hand to run his fingers over the exposed nape. The last time he’d saw Newt he still had wild curly locks collected in a ponytail that reached his shoulders. Now it was cut to a finger length, the back shorter than the fringe, which still seemed determined to imitate an angry bush. The silver diadem of Artemis gleaming unchanged under it. “Is that a declaration of intentions?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s a declaration of no longer being able to deal with a very bad tangle.” Newt swatted his hand away, huffing. “But if I’m lucky it will also deter pesky men invading this shrine for other reasons than bringing offerings to my lady Artemis.”</p><p align="justify">Theseus laughed, relieved. “Good, and here I thought I would need to change my approach. I don’t look good in braids.”</p><p align="justify">“You can’t be serious” Newt actually seemed taken aback by the implication and Theseus winked, leaning down to peck his cheek “I’m always serious when it comes to you.”</p><p align="justify">Newt didn’t stop him but didn’t lean in either, just narrowing his eyes, as if trying to figure out whether Theseus was pulling his leg or not.</p><p align="justify">As any Attican youth, him cutting his hair meant he was now considered a man, and therefore could choose for himself and seduce an eromenos, a younger pupil and a lover. Younger being the key there, unless he wanted to be made fun of and his masculinity questioned. Not that it really mattered in Newt's case since, as a priest of Artemis, he had sworn himself to chastity. It had come as a huge disappointment to Theseus, who had been persistently courting him ever since he had first noticed how beautiful Newt was. He hadn’t been the only one trying his luck back then but, thankfully, remained one of the few people that Newt had kept in contact with once he’d retired to the sacred forest.</p><p align="justify">They fell into step with each other, walking back to the shrine following a wide path through the trees, Newt’s bow thrown over the quill on his back. “So how did it go at Delphi?” He asked.</p><p align="justify">“You got my message?” Theseus was pleased “Wasn’t sure you would. And… well, I have some things to tell you. I didn’t come here just to stare into your pretty eyes, you see?” He grinned, bouncing on the balls of his feet, suddenly excited now that he remembered the reason he’d rode there.</p><p align="justify">“I can imagine” Newt chuckled, shooting a sideways glance at his visitor. As if judging Theseus’ messy hair and beard. He was used to seeing a much cleaner version of the prince of Attica, who had never lost the underlying hope to “sway him from his priestly duties” and therefore always made sure to look as dashing as he could when he came to visit. “The oracle say anything good, or... comprehensible?”</p><p align="justify">That question seemed to put a damp on Theseus’ spirits, shoulders dropping momentarily. However, before he said anything, they came in sight of the shrine and a loud barking overwhelmed any other sound around. A giant, black dog came out of nowhere, rushing their way, powerful legs almost flying in the air, teeth bared and ears up. He jumped straight at Theseus, almost toppling him over and, with one long swap of his tongue, covered the full side of his neck and head in drool.</p><p align="justify">“Ouuuff! Fido! Get down! Stop, stop you giant oaf!”</p><p align="justify">Never one to obey orders given by anyone but his owner Fido continued to waggle his tail at the speed of sound and licking Theseus’ face.</p><p align="justify">Finally Newt, who had doubled over laughing, gave out a sharp whistle and the dog leaped away, running in circles around them and then skipping to Theseus’ side. He didn’t try to attack his face again but panted happily when the man ruffled the fur between his ears.</p><p align="justify">“See? <em> He </em> loves me.”</p><p align="justify">“I love you too.” Newt shrugged, still snickering under his breath “You just don’t know how to take a hand and stop trying to grab the arm.”</p><p align="justify">“I want to grab more of you than just the arm.” Theseus couldn’t resist, but Newt scrunched up his nose.</p><p align="justify">“Are you really trying to flirt with me while looking, and smelling, like a bowl of dog food?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the end, he managed to clean himself up in the stream behind the temple and came back to Newt sitting on the steps with Fido’s head on his lap and a plate of figs by his side. Theseus took a seat too and helped himself to a few pieces of fruit.</p><p align="justify">“So, I take you came from Delphi with mixed feelings,” Newt asked.</p><p align="justify">Theseus nodded. “You know about the rumors coming from Crete and the Peloponnese? We’ve been providing sanctuary to people that decided to leave. They say dire times are coming. Something big, and bad.” Newt nodded, mouth drawing in a thin line. Yes, he’s been having troublesome dreams and feelings as of late too. “My father wanted me to go to Delphi and ask the Oracle about the future of Attica. I figured… I could get a prediction for myself as well, about you know,” he waved his hand “what I should do in life.”</p><p align="justify">“Still dealing with your crisis I see?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s not a crisis, but a valid concern. I’m a legal citizen and a bastard prince. My brothers are much older, well prepared, and very ready to take the throne the moment my dad sneezes the wrong way. I can’t spend my entire life hunting and showing up to feasts. And dad didn’t even let me join the army, even if he was the one that has been insisting my whole life I should have the best trainers. For what? Shooting geese? I’m named after the greatest hero in our history, and yet I feel as useful as a-”</p><p align="justify">“An infant princess, I know.” Newt rolled his eyes, very familiar by now with that tirade “The Oracle?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, right.” Theseus pepped up “Well, I wanted to get two prophecies but the old hag only gave me one. Hear it out tho,” He cleared his throat, before speaking in a voice an octave lower:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>By Ichor spilling in the East </em>
</p><p>
  <em>And blood of mortals in the west </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dawn of the new gods reborn </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The mark of wisdom finds its home</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Within the hold of his own kin </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The sword of Theseus blessed by sin </em>
</p><p>
  <em>And in the glory of Athens throne </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shall western world bathe evermore </em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Newt looked at him, puzzled. "Ichor is the blood of the gods... it's two mentions of blood in one couplet."</p><p>"Yeah, sounds bad. But then it talks about Athens' glory! That's so amazing, right?" Theseus grinned excitedly. </p><p>"I guess..." Newt didn't seem very convinced, his brow creasing in deep thought "It mentions your sword as well?"</p><p align="justify">“Not mine! I mean, the prophecy is a riddle, as expected, but I'm pretty sure it refers to the sword of my great-grandfather, the most impressive hero of all times! Theseus, son of Aegeus! His sword must be the key to save the city. And it has to be wielded by one of his blood. So, anyone from my dad’s line, really.”</p><p align="justify">Newt seemed even more puzzled than before “That's a bit too straightforward, don’t you think? If it's supposed to be a riddle... are you sure it means his actual sword?”</p><p align="justify">“Well, it can’t be his dead boner, so I'm guessing yes. And it even makes sense! The sword that Aegeus buried under a rock until Theseus was old enough to lift it and find it. The sword that he used to best his first enemies and make a name for himself before arriving to Athens already a hero, the sword that saved his life when wicked Medea tried to poison him! It must be a divine relic now! Charged with power!” The current Theseus' eyes were gleaming. Newt put up a hand.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, I grew up in Athens, I know all the stories of the life of Theseus. Where is that sword now?”</p><p align="justify">“See? Here’s the problem-” The prince settled back down “It’s lost.”</p><p align="justify">“Lost?!”</p><p align="justify">A nod “I sent a word beforehand, had all the library searched. The last record we have of it is when my great-uncle Arcamas took it with him to Troy. My grandfather mentions in his memories that the last time he saw it was when his brother and he set off to rescue their grandmother, who was a slave to Helen. However, on their way back they faced many enemies and, at some point, Arcamas lost the sword and replaced it with a Trojan spear. That was the last time it was ever seen.”</p><p align="justify">A tense silence descended upon them, interrupted only by Fido’s heavy breathing.</p><p align="justify">“So the sword is still in Troy?” Newt asked finally.</p><p align="justify">“It’s a possibility.” Theseus agreed, looking up at the purpling sky. He should be departing soon if he wanted to reach the city before night fell.</p><p align="justify">“Theseus…”</p><p align="justify">“Yes?”</p><p align="justify">“What stupid thing did you come up with?”</p><p align="justify">Theseus chuckled. “Glad you ask. I convinced my dad to let me go in search of it!”</p><p align="justify">Newt turned to him, frowning. “You and what army?”</p><p align="justify">“No army. Troy might be burned down and abandoned, but we can’t risk the Thracians to think they are under attack. No, I’m going by myself and a small company.”</p><p align="justify">“That’s a long journey.” Newt mumbled, looking down at his hands, that had stopped cradling through Fido’s fur. He was right of course, Troy was way further than Delphi and god knows how long will it take them to dig through the ruins of the city. Like looking for a needle in a haystack. “Have you come to say goodbye then?”</p><p align="justify">“No” Theseus wondered how to put it into words and decided to go straight to the point “I’ve come to ask you to accompany me.”</p><p align="justify">“What!?”</p><p align="justify">“Look” Theseus raised his hands, trying to explain “The outskirts are becoming more dangerous day by day, with all these southerners coming and turning to pillage. It’s not advisable for you to remain here, living on your own in the middle of a forest.”</p><p align="justify">“What am I? A defenseless maiden?”</p><p align="justify">“Of course not! You are a skilled archer and the best tracker I know. And you are favored by an Olympian Goddess. But what if you are attacked by a mob? Or an invading army comes? I think, and father agrees, that it would be best for you to return to the city.”</p><p align="justify">Newt huffed, crossing his arms over his chest “I don’t like it. It’s too narrow, full of people and smells like piss.”</p><p align="justify">“I know. So the alternative is for you to come with me. Your skills will be of great use in the expedition and I can’t promise the ship isn’t gonna be crowded or will smell like flowers, but at least you won’t be stuck in one place, worrying about me day and night, right?”</p><p align="justify">Newt looked like he was gonna argue again but that last part actually made him shut his mouth. However, he wasn’t sold yet, so Theseus pressed on.</p><p align="justify">“C’mon. Killed and raped, probably in that order, by an invading army? Cramped in your father’s old home next to a rowdy market? Or going on to live a great adventure with me across the sea? We will be like the pairs of heroes of old! You can be my Pirithous.”</p><p align="justify">Newt smiled involuntarily, raising his eyes to meet Theseus’</p><p align="justify">“You are aware of how he ended, right?”</p><p align="justify">Theseus shrugged “Unless you find your lust and try to ravish the queen of the Underworld, you are safe. And even if you change your mind on the celibacy thing I will be right there too, so you are still safe.”</p><p align="justify">Now Newt full on snorted “How reassuring.” He said sarcastically. Then looked aside, into the darkening woods. “What about the rest of the prophecy? The blood of gods spilled in the west?”</p><p align="justify">"Could be Troy, could be even further west, irrelevant to our quest. I'm not planning to fight any god in a long-abandoned city in ruins, or dwell on lines I can't understand. I would rather focus on the ones I do, and I would love for you to help me out."</p><p align="justify">Newt smiled when Theseus gave him the <em>pretty please</em> look "I'll think about it."</p><p align="justify">Theseus beamed. “You can bring Fido if you want. His fat ass could use an adventure as well.”</p><p align="justify">The dog raised his head and looked at him with giant, betrayed eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t listen to him” Newt cooed, flattening the animal’s ears to its skull, he’s just jealous of your powerful hindquarters.</p><p align="justify">“His hindquarters are bigger than a mare’s” Theseus kept teasing “Speaking of which- I should go now or I’ll be caught by Nyx.”</p><p align="justify">Newt agreed. He and Fido accompanied Theseus to the edge of the forest, where he had left his horse tied to a tree, but the younger man was distracted the whole way, lost in deliberations.</p><p align="justify">“We are leaving in five days,” Theseus said, smiling gently. “from the Athenian harbor.”</p><p align="justify">He bent down to kiss the corner of Newt’s lips; a dry, chaste contact of barely any pressure, but long and warm, feeling the flutter of Newt’s eyelashes on his own skin. When he straightened up Newt’s eyes were closed. He opened them slowly and gently leaned in, to rest his forehead on Theseus’ shoulder for a good minute.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll think about it.” He repeated, reluctantly stepping back.</p><p align="justify">Theseus beamed at him and mounted his horse. Coming from that man, it’s as close to an agreement as he was gonna get.</p>
