  <span>“Wow, I had no idea you could fit a plant </span>
  <em>
    <span>there</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville looked at Blaise askance. “Why did you say it like that? And so loudly?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise only tilted his head to the side. A moment later, the door opened and Theo poked his head in, looking alarmed and disgusted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck kind of kinky shit are you two up to in here?” he said, looking them both over. “And why am I not invited?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville looked between the two of them. “This is either a ridiculous joke, or you’re actually serious. I don’t even want to know. Come find me when you’re not being weird.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ignoring them both, he crossed the room, only to stop halfway out the door. “And don’t touch my plants!” he snapped over his shoulder, just in case.</span>
