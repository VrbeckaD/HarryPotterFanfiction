    <p>
  <span>Ginny walked into the common room of the Gryffindor tower. “Hey Harry!” She called brightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” he called back, halfheartedly. He took a breath, turning back to the conversation he was having with Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Harry,” she said, placing her hand on his shoulder. Harry shrugged her off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm fine, Hermione,” he said sharply. “It was a mutual breakup. We both agreed that we shouldn’t be together. It was actually my idea!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione fixed him with a look. “Are you sure it was your idea? Ginny’s been telling me for months how she was trying to break up with you, </span>
  <em>
    <span>months</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry. I think it was her idea and you're just trying to convince yourself that is was yours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stood up, “it was </span>
  <em>
    <span>my idea Hermione</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I was the one that decided we weren't working anymore!” He looked up and realized some of the first years were staring at him. He sat back down and lowered his voice. “Don’t worry about me. I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because people who are fine skip every meal that’s held in the Great Hall and only eat food brought to them by house elves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry gathered up his things, and stormed up to his room.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco swept down the long corridor, ignoring the whispers that followed him wherever he went.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or at least trying to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whispered words swirled around in his head, </span>
  <em>
    <span>scum, death eater, trash, dirt.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He deserved them all, he told himself. This was his punishment. He may have escaped serving in Azkaban with his father, but he was far from innocent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oi, Death Eater!” A voice called from down the hallway, “is it true that your father got chucked into Azkaban?” Draco kept walking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey! I’m talking to you, you filthy bastard!” Draco took a breath, never slowing. Just a few more minutes, and he’d be back in his dormitory. Back in his safe haven.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Everte Statum!” Draco felt himself fly forward, crashing into a wall. He laid in a crumpled heap on the ground, gasping for air. He felt someone kick him in the ribs. “Answer me you fucking death eater!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco let out a low whine. Someone grabbed his hair and pulled his head up, where he found himself face to face with a Gryffindor fifth year. “Now, lets try this again.” His breath smelled like eggs and Draco felt his stomach roll. “Is your poor excuse for a human being father stuck in Azkaban, or did they kill that undeserving son of a bitch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco closed his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Clarke, would you like to explain to me exactly what you’re doing?” Professor McGonagall appeared behind Draco’s tormentor. The boy let his hair go, and Draco unceremoniously dropped to the floor, breathing heavy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pushed himself up onto his hands and knees, then used the wall to get to his feet, trembling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Detention, Mr. Clarke, every night for a month, and one hundred points from Gryffindor. We do NOT allow ANY sort of behavior along those lines. Do you understand.” McGonagall stared down the boy with stone cold eyes. He nodded, and made to run off. “I want you in my office at 8 o’clock tonight, Mr. Clarke. Do be punctual.” He nodded, eyes wide, and ran.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco began walking away. “Mr. Malfoy,” Draco froze at Professor McGonagall's voice, “come with me to my office please.” Draco turned, and followed.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sat in the eight year boys dormitory, alone. He was the only one who had decided to come back. Seamus and Dean had gone to work in the ministry, Neville was working with Professor Sprout in the greenhouses, and after he’d broken up with Ginny, he and Ron had had a falling out. Hermione passed along that he was doing well and he was working with the twins in the joke shop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked around the empty room, remembering all the good things that had happened in this room. All the Christmases, all the late night talks and stupid games. So many good memories. Nobody around to share them with.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry let out a sigh, curling into himself under the covers. He closed his eyes, and gave in to sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco sat in Professor McGonagall’s office, staring silently at the walls. She bustled about in front of him, “would you like tea, Mr. Malfoy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No thank you professor,” he spoke quietly, as he always did these days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A biscuit, perhaps?” She placed a tin in front of him. He shook his head. “Have a biscuit, Mr. Malfoy.” He took one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” she sat down on the other side of her desk. “Is this the first time this has happened.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco shrugged. “Please use your words, Mr. Malfoy. We are adults, not preschoolers.” Her words were harsh, but Draco could hear that they were meant to be kind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s never been this bad before.” He murmured, “it’s usually just name calling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Minerva drew herself up, “but this is the first time it’s become physical?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes ma’am.” She nodded at Draco’s words. “Have another biscuit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco took another biscuit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for your time, Mr. Malfoy. You may leave now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you professor.” Draco stood up, and made his way out of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He walked quickly, looking around each corner to make sure he would be safe before continuing, never relaxing until he was in front of the Slytherin dorms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Salazar.” The door slid open, and Draco darted in, exhaling. He immediately made his way to his dormitory, where he collapsed onto his bed. He took a deep, shuddering breath, and began to silently cry.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“-RY POTTER!” Harry shot up like a rocket, nearly falling out of bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span> Hermione!” Harry spat, untangling his legs from his blanket, “why the hell would you do that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because you’re about to be late to Defence Against the Dark Arts! I brought you some toast, eat it. I’ll meet you downstairs in 15 minutes. Or else.” She flounced out of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled slightly, making his way out of bed. At least there was still one person that he could count on to be there, even when he didn’t want her to be there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He ate the toast.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco opened his eyes to an empty, dark room. Grabbing his wand, he cast a quick Tempus to see that he was late for his first class.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sighed, pulling his blanket over his head, then, reluctantly, slid out of bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He quietly walked into class, ignoring the looks some of his classmates were giving him. The professor was droning about something, Draco wasn’t paying attention anyways.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Malfoy.” Draco’s head shot up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, professor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you mind explaining why you were late to my class?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I overslept, ma’am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Professor Jones nodded, and turned back to the creature on her desk. Draco folded his arms on his desk, and dropped his head into them.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nudged Hermione, “is it just me, or does Draco look worse than usual.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione paused her rapid note taking, and glanced back at Draco. “He looks fine, Harry. Now pay attention.” She hissed, turning back to the front.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry did the same, placing his head in his hand, and letting Hestia’s words flow over him.</span>
