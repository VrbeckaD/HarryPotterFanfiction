  <strong>PART ONE </strong>
</p><p align="left">Credence was scared.</p><p>It was always like this, always in the night time. He was awake, not because he couldn’t sleep, but because he didn’t want to. He found it hard to close his eyes at night; at seventeen years old, this was a problem. It wasn’t fear of paranormal, or the unknown- on the contrary, it was in fear of Mary Lou, his adoptive mother, who abused him. Credence spent countless night hiding from her, locking the door after she had come for him, stripping himself of the tattered clothes to reveal the array of purple bruises littering his back.</p><p>He gripped the edge of the porcelain sink, in an attempt to stop the tremor in his right hand. It had only started recently, but it was a habit he couldn’t shake. It wasn’t constant, but a tick that had happened every time he was nervous, or scared. This was the basis of Credence’s neurotic spells. He knew when they would occur because of the tremors, and it was almost impossible to stop them; they would just have to be waited out. How Credence hated those days.</p><p>Mary Lou was convinced that he had a problem, much to his horror. ‘You’re possessed, boy.’ She would say, her small body quivering in fear and anger. And then, she would hold out her hand, almost apologetically, and Credence would undo his belt.</p><p>Credence hated those days.</p><p>His hands grasped at the tall cup filled with water and raised it to his lips, his teeth chattering against the glass. He glanced outside nervously, wondering if he could run away. It was dark outside, however. Credence was out after hours, and if he went back to the house now, he would be hurt. Badly.</p><p>There was a knock on the door.</p><p>Credence froze; he couldn’t run away now. But he was confused- did he want to run away? After all, he did bring himself after all. Because he was terrified of himself, and he didn’t know what to do.</p><p>‘Can I come in, Credence?’ Credence could feel his chest tightening. He wrapped his arms around himself as if he could curl up into nothingness. His breathing was becoming quicker at the sound of this unfamiliar voice, his palms sweating inside his closed fists.</p><p>‘Credence?’ He could feel his eyes watering, the hot tears sliding down his face. He was, above all, scared to open the door. He was supposed to be in the waiting room, but he had gone to the toilet to hide, just in case Mary Lou had somehow found out that he was there, so she couldn’t find him, and hurt him. But he wasn’t supposed to be in the toilet, and maybe they would be mad at him.</p><p>‘Please come out, Credence.’ A voice said quietly. Credence took time to dissect the voice; it was male, more mature than his own, and- kind. ‘No one will hurt you.’</p><p>Credence opened the door.</p><p>The man standing in front of him was ten, maybe fifteen years his senior, a tall, slim man with dark hair and even darker eyes. He had a gentle face, but his eyebrows were knitted together in concern. ‘Are you alright?’</p><p>‘<em>Please</em>- please, make it stop.’</p><p>‘That’s what I’m here for Credence. Credence? Can you look at me, please?’</p><p>A low sob erupted from the back of his throat, causing uncontrollable shakes to wrack his body. ‘Help... Help me. Please, I– <em>help</em>.’</p><p>‘Credence?’ The man said cautiously. ‘Credence, I’m here to help you. But you’re going to have to let me touch you.’</p><p>‘I want you t–to help me–’</p><p>‘Credence, I’m going to touch you, alright? I’m going to help you outside. And you’re going to let me.’ The man said firmly. ‘Okay?’</p><p>Credence struggled with speaking for a moment, he felt as though if he opened his mouth he would not be able to stop crying, and he couldn’t do that because then the man would leave him, and then he would be all alone again. So he held out his hand, like a child. ‘Okay.’</p><p>The man’s hand was soft, muscular and laden with very fine, dark hairs, and veins that stuck out in a spidery blue lattice across the back of his hand.</p><p>‘We can go to inside my office– if you would like,’ he said as he helped the boy up, before releasing his hand gently. ‘We can– talk.’</p><p>Credence’s hands found the back pockets of his overcoat and stuffed them inside, bowing his head deeply.</p><p>‘Yes? Would you like that, Credence?’ Credence bit his lip. ‘Y– Yes.’</p><p>The man nodded. ‘Come.’ Credence did so, following the man down the dimly lit hallway and then into a large room, which was empty, excluding a desk, and two chairs. They both sat down.</p><p>‘Your name is Credence, yes?’ He asked. ‘I do hope I’ve been saying it correctly.’</p><p>He nodded. Credence averted his gaze, but he could feel the man’s eyes on him. Reluctantly, he looked up. ‘Yes, sir.’</p><p>The man smiled warmly at him. It made Credence want to smile back, but he was too shy. ‘My name is Percival Graves, but everyone calls me Percy, or simply Graves.’</p><p>Credence found himself smiling at the floor.</p><p>‘So, Credence- you’ve found yourself being anxious, or suddenly angry, and unable to suppress it, as I hear? That’s why you’ve come to us, I assume.’</p><p>‘Yes. M-my, uh- Mary Lou, my mother- she, uh. She doesn’t know I’m here.’</p><p>Mr Graves rifled through some papers on his desk. 'Yes... Mary Lou. You've had some trouble with her in the past, haven't you? Don’t worry- you won’t be in any trouble, we’re just here to help you as best as we can. Your mom can’t be mad at you.’</p><p>Credence didn’t say anything. He couldn’t agree with him, he didn’t want to contradict him, either. So he stayed silent.</p><p>'You've spoken to Tina before, haven't you? My papers say that you've stayed with her whilst Mary Lou's been in our rehabilitation services.'</p><p>'Yes, sir.'</p><p>Mr Graves nodded, placing his papers back on his desk. He looked at Credence- the lost, forlorn boy who would not look him in the eye, and felt a rush of sympathy for him. ‘We will confirm your next meeting with us by post- it should be very soon. But is there anything in particular that you need right now?’ He added gently.</p><p>Credence considered this. He felt lonely, isolated, and tired. There was nothing better that he would’ve liked to do more than curl up in bed, but he couldn’t. The next best thing was some comfort, even if it was from a complete stranger.</p><p>‘A h-hug.’ Credence mumbled to the floor. He could feel his face reddening. With not a moment hesitation, he could feel Graves’ arms, his thick, ropy back muscles contracting against Credence’s touch.</p><p>'You’re safe, okay?’ Graves muttered in a gravelly voice. ‘Nothing will hurt you now.’ Credence shivered, and although he could not bring himself to believe this man wholeheartedly, there was something about him; something that made Credence want to trust him.</p>
