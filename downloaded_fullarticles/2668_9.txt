    <p>“Potter, listen to me. I’m pregnant.”</p><p>Harry froze. “You’re taking the piss.”</p><p>Malfoy clenched his teeth. “I’m not. It’s true.”</p><p>“What are you on about? That’s—” <em> Impossible</em>, he wanted to say, but suddenly he was bombarded with a memory of Hermione, just after he came out.</p><p>She’d cornered him, pamphlets clutched in her hands, and tried to talk to him about <em> protection </em> and <em> precautions </em>. “Harry, you need to know these things, it’s different with wizards—”</p><p>Harry, picturing magical STIs, waved her off. “I’m not stupid, ‘Mione. I know about all that.” Of course, he’d been thinking about how Ron had taken to exclaiming <em> Merlin’s cock bumps! </em> every time something surprised him, and how perhaps Merlin’s bumps were actually something more contagious than he’d first imagined.</p><p>Now, with Malfoy trapping him in the Ministry tea room, he realized what Hermione meant to say. He felt suddenly nauseous. He looked at Draco, noticed that he did actually look a little...softer than usual. His jawline had smoothed out some, and his hair was loose and looked thicker than it had been when Harry’d run his fingers through it—</p><p>“What are you staring at?” Malfoy’s biting tone pulled Harry out of his memory.</p><p>Harry sat in one of the awful plastic chairs and motioned for Malfoy to do the same. He cleared his throat, trying to pretend for a moment that he was a functional human. They could talk about this like adults.</p><p>Malfoy, eyeing Harry warily, sat.</p><p>Harry took a deep breath. “I— I didn’t know that could happen.”</p><p>Malfoy let out a bitter laugh. “Of course you didn’t. God, you might as well be a muggle.”</p><p>Harry frowned. “How have I never heard of this? Surely if men can—" He eyed Draco’s belly, trying not to look for roundness. “I’ve never seen anything about pregnant wizards.”</p><p>“Not the most observant even on your best days, are you, though?” Draco didn’t meet Harry’s eyes. He sighed. “But I suppose it is, ah, somewhat rare.”</p><p>“What, the pregnancies, or the—ability?” Harry may have missed muggle anatomy class, but he did understand the basics, and felt somewhat confident that men—<em>cisgender </em> men, his inner Hermione corrected him—cisgender men don’t have the bits needed to carry a baby.</p><p>“Both,” Draco answered. “It’s an old pureblood solution to homosexuality. Can’t let the line die off just because the heir prefers cock.”</p><p>Harry nodded.  “Okay, that makes sense, in a way.” <em> A stupid, pureblood way</em>, he didn’t add.</p><p>Malfoy seemed to hear the end anyway and scowled. “Potter, just because you’re—”</p><p>Harry held his hand up. “Spare me.” A thought occurred to him, and spouted out of his mouth before he could stop it. “How do I know it’s mine?”</p><p>Draco hexed Harry before he even realized Malfoy had his wand out, which Harry admitted he deserved. “What do you think I am, Potter? You think I just let anyone have a go, unprotected at that?”</p><p>Still reeling from the invisible hand’s harsh slap, Harry shook his head. “No, I don’t think that. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that.”</p><p>“Too right. God, you’re such a twat. Don’t know why I even— Anyway, it can only happen if the—" Draco pressed his lips together, splotches of red high on his cheeks.</p><p>Harry studied him for a moment. “If what?”</p><p>Malfoy darted his eyes to Harry, then to a wage law poster on the wall. “If the, er, moon is waxing. Look, I’ve got to go, I have an,” Malfoy formed his face into a cringe, “an <em> appointment </em>.”</p><p>Harry sucked in a breath. “What? You’ve already decided to do it?” He tried to remember Hermione’s articles about partner support, about post-procedure depression, but a panic had gripped him. “Do you want me to come? Won’t you need help getting home?”</p><p>Draco found Harry’s eyes again, looking confused. “I’ll be fine getting home, it’s just the scan and a bit of blood checking.”</p><p>Harry mirrored Draco’s confusion, feeling as though he was missing something. “Do they not do it the same day? Make you come back or something? Sorry, I’ve never been to a, you know. A clinic.”</p><p>“Potter, you’ve gone mad. I’m only, like, sixteen weeks gone. I’m no expert, but I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t survive if it came out today.” Malfoy’s lips twitched into a ghost of a smile. “And I’m relatively certain you’ve been to more clinics than the rest of the Auror department combined.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened as understanding dawned on him. God, he really <em> was </em> a twat. Malfoy wasn’t going to an abortion clinic, he was visiting the fucking obstetrician, like pregnant people <em> do </em>. He let out a laugh and pretend it didn't sound as hysteric as it did.</p><p>Malfoy looked at him as if he really had lost his marbles. “You can come, if you must. It isn’t all that pleasant, but sometimes they have apple juice, if you ask.”</p><p>Harry was already pulling his jacket from the coat hook. He smiled, just a little, at the reminder of Draco’s fondness for sweet things. “Let me just send a note to Robards.”</p><p>Malfoy gave a curt nod and unwarded the door as Harry sent a little paper airplane zooming off. Draco was fidgeting with the zipper on his coat absentmindedly. Harry could tell Draco was nervous. It hit him that Draco must have been carrying this around for weeks, and Harry wondered if anyone else knew yet. Somehow, he didn’t think so.</p><p>“Draco,” Harry said gently, placing his hand on Draco’s arm. Gray eyes met his, carefully guarded, but Harry saw through the walls. He always had. “Thank you for telling me.”</p><p>For a moment, Draco looked like he might say something. He stared at Harry, something flickering across his expression, something like fear or maybe desperation. But then his features smoothed and he nodded again, turning away to leave.</p><p>Harry took a moment to press his hands to his face. He allowed himself five seconds of internally screaming <em> what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck</em>, then took a deep breath and followed.</p>
