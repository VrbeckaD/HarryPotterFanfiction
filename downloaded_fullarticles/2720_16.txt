    <p>This script is one for only those who readeth and speaketh a noble blood that wilt not wash nor taint with decade, century and millennia. We art few now and maybe we shalt groweth, but tis with most wondrous doubt I cast such predictions. Methinks any sear of truest sight would knoweth the same truth. Our blood doest not taketh kind to many, some would bethink t curséd. Nay, we art blesséd. Blood runneth thick and ours coequal thicker.  </p><p>Blood that is pure and true, tis. t may not at each moment beest so, unfortunate times may befall us. But Blood wilt out. Only us of truest descent may seek these words. Spoken. Writ. t'will not beest learnt. I forbid t so. Hark hither, mine descent, hark close and readeth close. For I wilt not writeth once more. Blood is thick. Blood is pure. Blood is truth. Blood is war.</p><p>
