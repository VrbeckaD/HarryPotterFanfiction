    <p>Chapter one</p><p>Harry Potter had won, he was now the man-who-conquered, fans screaming his name, people swarming him, thanking him for being their hero, for saving them blah blah blah, truth was while everyone expected him to go on and become an arour just like his dad or whatever Harry was just tired, he didn’t want to fight anymore. 
He didn’t want to do anything anymore so he spent his days hiding in the Black library learning, going through his memories seeing every mistake he made and hitting himself on the head for being so stupid and naïve but then again that’s what Dumbledore expected him to do, not fight and win, just stand there and die, he had moved past his anger eventually, he had understood now he was just empty and tired, he felt like a 180 year old man in a 18 year old body, battered and bruised and tired.</p><p>Time passed and Harry learned things, runes and arithmancy and wards, he was supposed to be the Dark Lords equal so he supposed that he should have been able to do everything he could do after all Tom Riddle was one of the brightest minds Hogwarts had ever seen even Dumbledore believed it. He trained and dueled even though he didn’t know why he bothered doing so much anymore, it wasn’t like he could fight the war again and do better. He just wanted to know how far he could go if he actually tried and taken his education seriously.</p><p>Ron and Hermione had married and while he was happy for them, he had become in essence a hermit and they were no longer as close as they once were, he didn’t go for the wedding just sent a present and went back to the books in the library, he learned about the purebloods customs and their culture everything he should have learned if he were raised as an heir to an Ancient and Noble house. He wrote letters to Neville and Luna when he remembered but mostly he stayed far away from the public until five years after the Battle of Hogwarts on its exact date to be precise, something strange happened, there was a loud gong similar to the sound of Big Ben which had him tumbling out of bed and onto the floor and when Harry looked around he found himself in a field.</p><p>Harry was confused, as pretty as the flower meadow was he had no idea what he was doing here until three people appeared before him, a man in a black suit with dark eyes and hair, and two blonde women one wearing purple robes and another wearing a white dress.</p><p>“Hello Harry Potter, do forgive our abrupt way of bringing you here but we needed to speak to you and well you were never going to die anytime soon and we were running out of time.” Said the woman in the dress and Harry just stared at her.</p><p>He had gotten quiet used to insane things happening to him, his Potter Luck as Hermione once called it but this was a little ridiculous, he didn’t even know how this happened or what it was about since the war was long since over and done with, the world had recovered and endured so what now?</p><p>“Who are you and what am I doing here?”</p><p>The man sighed, “I am Death and these are my sisters, Fate and Magic and we need your help.”</p><p>Harry laughed a little hysterically for a moment before giving them a ‘more information needed’ type of look and the lady in the purple robes conjured a table and poured some tea.</p><p>“When you collected the Hallows you became the Master of Death however this title doesn’t mean what many mortals believe it means. You are not immortal, you cannot order Death around nor do you have any control over Death or any special powers but rather it gives your soul a unique opportunity one that if we hadn’t needed your help you would have never known about because no one in your world was ever able to create a way to travel to alternate dimensions.”</p><p>Harry face palmed, he read about alternate universes, it was something that people who created time turners theorized about, basically they believed in another earth where things are similar to the one they were living in with either minor or major changes. No one was sure whether this was actually possible or not and no one ever researched very deeply into it, time travel was dangerous enough no one wanted to add different worlds and timelines to the mix.</p><p>“I know about alternate dimensions, at least I’ve heard of it but what do you mean unique opportunity?” asked Harry and it was Fate that explained.</p><p>“When a person dies their soul gets reincarnated into this world however by becoming the Master of Death you are now able to travel to different universes once you die. Basically it opens up your options to the multiverse not just this earth.”</p><p>Harry nodded his head, “Why is that a unique opportunity?”</p><p>Death shook his head, “The same soul cannot co-exist in the same dimension, by uniting the Hallows you have changed your very soul, becoming more than you once was, allowing you to travel to a different dimension without damaging the balance of the worlds.”</p><p>Harry nodded, similar to how when going back in time you cannot meet yourself it made sense that there cannot be two of the same person in the same universe and he was pretty sure he didn’t want to know what would happen if a universe was unbalanced.</p><p>“Why do you need help?” asked Harry and this time the Lady that said her name was Magic blushed bright red and sighed at the same time.</p><p>“There is a universe where Tom Riddle finds the Odin’s eye an ancient artifact which in that world is similar to the Hallows only more powerful. It will give him the same ability to travel between worlds, and eventually creating a multi-dimensional war.”</p><p>Harry could understand how that would be bad but he didn’t get why he was needed, “Why can’t he be stopped by the me of that world or whatever?”</p><p>Fate shook her head, “The war is very different in that world Harry, your Tom was born in 1929 and went to Hogwarts in 1940 and eventually started his blood war, in the year 1976 the war had reached its very peak and stayed that way until his defeat in 1981 however in this world Tom Riddle was born in 1939, going to Hogwarts from 1950-1957, everything remained the same the orphanage his treatment except there was no World War and he didn’t create his horcruxes until after Hogwarts. </p><p>His followers are different as he went to school with different students and influenced different people, your parents for example didn’t attend Hogwarts when he was recruiting Slytherins as such Severus Snape and many others never joined them, he and James hated each other but he managed to hold onto your mothers friendship, he eventually married Charity Burbage and had a daughter. He is also a potions master and works for St. Mungo’s.</p><p>When Tom started the blood war in Britain it took longer to reach its peak, in 1979 things were very bad however not as many families died because the war didn’t rage for as long as it did in your universe, then the prophecy was spoken and he targeted Harry James Potter but your parents didn’t die, Lily Potter went into labor on Halloween and Peter was babysitting, without the warning from Severus your parents never went into hiding because they didn’t know Tom was after them. The prophecy was overheard by one of Tom’s death eaters and without the charm he killed Peter who never joined him, without your mothers protection Harry Potter died but as the boy was supposed to be his equal, the curse rebounded and destroyed his body but Harry Potter died as well, when your parents returned home the house had been burned to ash and no bodies were ever found, only the wand of the Dark Lord.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t help but think that universe probably didn’t suffer as much under Tom as he didn’t have as much time to wage his war.</p><p>“So if I’m dead and he is dead then why do need me?” asked Harry.</p><p>Death rolled his eyes, “While the first war wasn’t as bad, the second war will be so much worse because he will not be able to be matched and then he will find the Odin’s eye and start the multi-dimensional war which will upset the balance of every universe.”</p><p>Harry understood kind off, but he still didn’t understand what they expected him to do, “If I’m dead in that world how am I supposed to stop him?”</p><p>Fate smiled at him, “You once believed that your fate was cursed young child and so we offer you an opportunity. You can be deaged back to the age of 10 years old and take the place of your counterpart and live with your parents and family in return you stop Tom before he finds the artifact. No one knows what happened that night, baby Harry Potter could have simply apparated out of the house using accidental magic. We will create a cover story for you.”</p><p>“I’m not 11 years old.” Replied Harry and Death rolled his eyes.</p><p>“To travel there you will have to die, we can ease your memories, it will be similar to how one reads a book, you will have knowledge but you will be reborn. You will get the actual opportunity to live with your parents and your siblings.” Replied Magic.</p><p>Harry thought back to his life, it was empty and unfulfilling, he was just living for the sake of living, he had fulfilled his purpose and now all he was left with was regret. He would have to face that monster again but this world was already so much brighter than the one he came from. The magical world was recovering but so much had been lost, so many purebloods and family legacies were lost forever, so many friends and families never had the chance to live and now here was the chance to meet those people and have a family a real family something that he had always craved. </p><p>In the end Harry laughed because if there was one thing that everyone always knew about Harry Potter was that he had a stupid obsession with saving people it did help that his family was on the other side but the honest to God truth was that Harry couldn’t just let Tom win. As long as Tom Riddle was around to wage a war, Harry Potter would stand and fight it was after all his destiny no matter how much he had hated it.</p><p>His friends would be alright, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Luna and Ginny they had all moved on and created better lives for themselves. They had risen up and shouldered the burden of rebuilding the magical world while Harry had hidden himself away lost to regret and guilt. They were alright without him and maybe one day when they knew that he was gone, they would mourn but they would also move on. Harry Potter died that day during the Battle of Hogwarts he was only moving on now to his next Great Adventure as his mentor once told him. </p><p>When Harry Potter woke up he was in St. Mungo’s and he was confused. He had two sets of memories, one of his life when his parents died and he lived until the age of 23 and then he was sent here and another life one where he was found and sent to an orphanage. There was an old German wizard who saw him use magic at the age of 5 and took him with him. The man was a hunter, he was hired to exterminate dangerous animals in different parts of the world and it was not something that Harry should have been doing but he learned and he had faced almost every creature that his older-self had faced, he even had the scars from the dragon and basilisk as well as the lightning bolt scar that had marked him all his life.</p><p>There was also a whisper at the back of his mind and before he could try and figure out if there was anyone in the room he had fallen back into unconsciousness. He recognized the voice as Lady Magic and she was talking to him, giving him some information about what was happening.</p><p>“The scars you have run deep child, the one from the basilisk was your first real kill, it may have been a big snake but it was the first time that you faced a living creature with the intention of killing it to save the life of your friends sister, your first kill as a solider in war. You may have killed Quirrell but you didn’t face him with the intention of killing him, the snake on the other hand you were always willing to kill. The burns from the dragon was something that changed you, it was the time that you faced your enemies in the light of day in front of the whole world, when they saw your potential to lead, it didn’t seem like it at the time but it happened and those marked you, we couldn’t get the scars to go away in time, travelling universes is hard and we cannot interfere for too long or the window of opportunity passes so we got you a cover story and just included the scars into your background.</p><p>Andreas Stefan was a hunter who had a fearsome reputation across the world as a hunter and he was hunting a Chimaera that escaped. He chased the feral creature across some states however it killed him and injured you, the arours who were keeping an eye on him, hunting on their land found out that both the Chimaera and Andreas were dead. They came to retrieve the body and found you in his arms underneath him and sent you to the hospital. They are currently running a blood test and they have found that you have Potter blood. James and Lily Potter are on their way and soon they will do a paternity test as well. It will be best to confirm your identity as quickly as possible.</p><p>Goodbye child and good luck.”</p><p>James Potter had been having a good day. He was one of the best arours in Britain and his partner and brother in all but blood Sirius Black was as always at his side. He had married the love of his life and had a beautiful family even though there were times when they all noticed that there was someone missing from their home, his eldest child. He tried not to dwell on the thoughts of what was lost, he had Charles, Rose and Violet and they needed their father. Charles was 8 years old and his twin girls were six years old.</p><p>Sirius Black married Mary McGonagall, Minerva’s niece and a half-blood. They both had a son Orion Regulus Black who was 9 years old, James tried not to think that if Harry had lived then he and Orion would have been best friends and went to Hogwarts together.</p><p>It was James and his team who had been tracking Stefan, the feral creature was going to end up in a heavily populated area when the hunter diverted it and the arours were on standby should he need help however by the time he arrived the creature was dead and Stefan was curled around something with the claws of the creature embedded in his back. The man died protecting something that he believed to be more precious than his own life.</p><p>When James saw the tiny child covered in blood his heart dropped and he couldn’t help but understand by Stefan had chosen to die in place of who was probably his son. He took the child to the hospital but he couldn’t help but feel like he shouldn’t be leaving the child but his family was waiting for him. He went home to his wife and tried not to grimace when he saw Snape. They had their childhood rivalry and while they would never be the best of friends they were civil. He meant a lot to Lily especially after Petunia all but threw her out of her home, Severus was her only link to her childhood and James respected that now, it was harder when they were younger but he understood now. It helped that Snape was married and he knew how much Severus and Charity loved each other and their daughter, she was also about 8 or 9 years old, he wasn’t really sure.</p><p>Sirius and his family joined them and the Snape’s for supper when James was summoned by Amelia. She told him that he child registered as having Potter blood and she needed his permission to do a paternity test as the child was not related to Stefan. Lily and James were so confused that they did as Amelia asked and went to the hospital, leaving Sirius and Mary to babysit the children.</p><p>Lily was staring at the boy in the bed, he was wrapped in bandages but his skin was pale, he had an odd scar on his forehead but she couldn’t help but feel like she should know this child. His face was similar to how James looked when he was young but there were differences.</p><p>The healer spoke, “The boy has had many injuries from creatures but the scar on his head was dark magic. What kind I don’t know but it was very dark magic.”</p><p>Lily frowned, “What creatures?”</p><p>The healer sighed, “He was bitten by a basilisk and burned by a dragon. There is evidence of others but those healed with almost no visible sign of damage. He was healed by a phoenix after getting bitten.”</p><p>James and Lily were pale at the thought of a child facing those creatures.</p><p>“I need your permission to do a paternity test as the general blood tests names the House of Potter as the closest living relative.”</p><p>James nodded, he was curious, Potters were not a large bunch until he married Lily. His grand children would have many first cousins but James had none. His fathers brother died before he could sire children so he was curious as to who the child was that had strong ties to his house.</p><p>The healer cast the spell and the name of his parents appeared above his head in glowing gold letters, Paternal James Potter, Maternal Lily Evans Potter, Named Harry James Potter.</p><p>Lily fainted and James automatically caught her, face pale and confused, this was going to be a long night.</p>
