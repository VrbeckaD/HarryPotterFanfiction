    <p>“So you’re saying you want me to fuck your godson?”</p><p>Hermione froze, her hand just about to grab the doorknob of the Black Library.  She barely avoided gasping out loud at what she’d just heard Tonks ask.</p><p>“Do you have a problem with that?” she heard Sirius respond.  “I thought you were like me, cousin—always up for a good shag.”</p><p>“Oh, I am,” Tonks said casually.  “I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t thought about Harry a time or two.  He’s the Boy-Who-Lived, and he’s pretty damn handsome too.  And now that he just got done crushing Voldemort, witches are going to be lining up around the block for a piece of him.  I’m just surprised you’d try to set me up with him.”</p><p>“That’s exactly why,” Sirius said.  “Everybody’s going to try and make a run at him now.  I’m all for letting him fuck as many hot witches as he physically can, but not all of them will just be looking to have fun.  Some will try and use sex to bind themselves and their family to him forever.”</p><p>“I’d ask who you’re talking about, but I think I already have a pretty good idea.”</p><p>“The Weasleys,” he said anyway.  “Ginny has dreamed of being Mrs. Potter since she was a little girl, and Molly practically adopted the kid years ago, at least in her own head.  If that girl takes Harry’s virginity the two of them will try to convince him that marriage has to come next.”</p><p>“Couldn’t you just talk some sense into him?”</p><p>“Normally, maybe, but he’s been brooding a lot since the end of the war.  I think he’s struggling to try and figure out what he needs to do next or where he fits in now that he’s stopped Voldemort.”</p><p>“Why’s that?” she asked.  “He pretty well kicked his arse, right?  Shouldn’t he feel good about that?”  Hermione agreed.  She’d been trying to make Harry see sense about how proud he should be of the ease with which he’d destroyed Voldemort and the many lives he’d saved that would’ve been lost in a protracted struggle, but so far it had been in vain.</p><p>“Yes, he did.  He crushed that noseless wanker far easier than anyone expected, including me, and I’ve always had confidence in the kid.  But he’s always felt like he’s different, like he’s separated from everybody else and can’t just be normal.  Now that he’s the conquering hero that everybody worships, he feels even more isolated than ever.  So if Molly and Ginny try to capitalize on his loneliness by offering him a place to belong then I’m not sure if I’ll be able to stop him, even though there’s no way he’s ready for it.  He needs to live a little first.”</p><p>“Why me?” she asked.  “Figured you’d try to set him up with someone his own age.  Why not Hermione?  It’s obvious those two fancy each other.”  Outside the room, Hermione felt her face grow hot.  That was a topic she was too deep in denial to even think about.</p><p>“Of course they do,” Sirius said as if it were obvious.  “But they’re both too afraid to make the first move, and besides, I want the future Lord Black to know what he’s doing.  I’ve taught him what I can, but we both know that hands-on experience is the only way to really get good.”</p><p>“Can’t argue with that.  Alright, you’ve twisted my arm.  I’ll deflower the handsome eighteen year old that just saved the world.  But you owe me for this,” she deadpanned.</p><p>“I’ll owe you extra if you use your morphing to make things even better for him,” he said.  Tonks laughed, and the two of them made plans for Sirius to find somewhere else to be tomorrow night so she could make her move.</p><p>Outside, Hermione fumed.  She couldn’t allow this to happen!  She knew going in and confronting them directly wouldn’t work.  Even if they agreed not to go through with this, she knew not to take Padfoot at his word.  They’d probably agree, and then turn right around and arrange a new time and place that Hermione wouldn’t know anything about.  If she wanted to stop this and prevent Harry from making a huge mistake, she would just need to wait for Tonks to put her plan into action and then interrupt before things could go too far.</p><p>She needed to do it for Harry’s own good.  She knew he’d regret it if his first time was with someone he didn’t love.  That was the only reason she was interfering, she reminded herself, ignoring the way her heart had pounded when Tonks mentioned her and Harry fancying each other.</p><p>--</p><p>Hermione was in such a hurry that she nearly tripped and fell flat on her face while running up the stairs.  Her internship with Kingsley had run longer than expected, to the point that Tonks had probably been here for at least a half an hour by now, if not longer.  She just had to hope that she wasn’t too late to stop them, too late to stop Harry from doing something that she—no, that HE, she forcefully corrected herself—would regret.  This was for his own good.  It had nothing to do with her.  Really, it didn’t.  She was just looking out for her best friend.</p><p>“You realize I can change my body at will,” she heard Tonks say from upstairs.  “I can be literally anything you want me to be.  Is this really what you want?”</p><p>“Yes,” Harry said without pause.  “I’m sure.”  She was close enough now to tell that their voices were coming from Harry’s room at the Black estate, and the door was closed.  Tonks had obviously completed her seduction at the very least, but maybe she could still make it in time before they actually had sex.</p><p>“Most blokes go for some supermodel they’re never going to meet,” Tonks mused.  “Or they want me to grow balloon tits or an arse that would never fit in any of the clothes I own.  But hey, if this is what you want, your mate Tonks will do it for you, hero.”</p><p>Hermione sped up, willing her body to move as fast as it possibly could.  Even as fast as she was moving, she still heard her best friend gasp and then groan, likely gawking at whatever perverted form Tonks had just assumed.  With a determined spring in her step, she bounded the rest of the way down the hall and threw the door open.  She burst into the room, ready to chase that scarlet woman Tonks away from her man; her best friend, that is!  But what she saw when she opened that door stunned her into complete, open-mouthed silence.</p><p>There were two people in that room, two people on that bed.  One of them, of course, was Harry.  The other was Hermione Granger.  And both of them were completely naked.</p><p>“H-Hermione?!” Harry said.  His eyes went wide and he hastily grabbed a pillow to try and cover his privates.  Hermione, the other Hermione that is, the naked one, showed no such urgency.</p><p>“Oh, hullo, Hermione.”  The voice came from a body that was identical to hers in every way, but the voice unmistakably belonged to Tonks.  “What’re you doing here?”</p><p>“I-I just, uh, came to ask Harry about a book I wanted to borrow from the library,” she said, knowing even as she said it that it was an incredibly lame excuse.</p><p>“Ah,” Tonks said, smirking at her and making it clear how likely she found that excuse.  It was disconcerting being smirked at by someone who looked just like her.  “And you barged into Harry’s room without knocking because this book is urgent business, huh?”</p><p>“That’s right!” Hermione said, hoping she could act confident and indignant enough to make it through.  “But this isn’t about me!  What are you two doing?!  And why do you look like me?!”</p><p>“I think you know damn well what we’re about to do,” Tonks said.  “As for why I look like this?  It’s what Harry wanted.”  Hermione’s eyes shot to Harry, who was blushing and looking straight down.  “He could’ve had me turn into anyone he wanted, or change any feature of my body.  But all he wanted was for me to look just like you.”</p><p>“Really?” she breathed, feeling her heart race.  She could feel desires that she’d kept buried deep down for years begin to bubble back to the surface.  “Is that true, Harry?”</p><p>“Yes,” he admitted quietly, finally looking up at her.  “You’re the most beautiful girl in the world.”</p><p>“Oh, Harry,” she said softly, touched.  The two longtime friends shared a fond smile.</p><p>“Well isn’t that sweet?” Tonks said.  “If you’d had this little moment ten minutes ago, I might’ve bowed out and left this to you.  But then I saw this.”  She yanked the pillow out of Harry’s hand and tossed it aside, and Hermione got her first look at a penis in person.  This wasn’t just any penis though; it was Harry’s.  And she might be a virgin, but she knew enough to recognize that her best friend’s penis was far, far bigger than average.</p><p>“Oh my God,” she whispered, unable to take her eyes off of his penis.  She could only watch as Tonks reached out and wrapped her hand around his thick shaft.  She started to wank it, and Hermione licked her lips.  Since Tonks looked identical to her at the moment, it was so easy to imagine that she was the one doing this, that it was her hand sliding up and down her best friend’s lovely penis.</p><p>“Take it from me, Hermione: you’re never going to see a nicer cock than this one,” Tonks said.  “I know I haven’t, and I’ve seen my share.  So I’m sorry, but there’s no way I’m walking out of here without doing what I came here to do.”  Without further ado, she lowered her head and took Harry’s cock in her mouth.</p><p>Tonks had no problem admitting she had plenty of experience, and she was putting that experience to good use here.  Despite Harry’s considerable size, she bobbed her head on his penis without much trouble, though she didn’t go all the way down on him.</p><p>“Normally I’d just expand my throat so I could deepthroat you without any trouble, but you wanted me to be just like Hermione,” she said, pulling back for a moment and rubbing her face against his penis.  “So I won’t be at my best, but I think I’ll still be able to get you off just fine.  Not to brag, but I’m pretty damn good at this.”</p><p>She was, indeed, very good.  She worked him over with her mouth, smoothly bobbing up and down as much of his length as she could safely manage in her current form.  Whatever she couldn’t reach with her mouth received plenty of attention from her left hand, which jerked the bottom of his shaft while her right played with his bollocks.  Everything Tonks did was done with confidence and skill, and Hermione could see how much Harry was enjoying it.  She watched his face closely, enthralled by the satisfaction she could see in his beautiful green eyes.  She knew that she should leave, or try to stop them, or something.  Anything would have been more sensible than what she actually did, which was unbutton her shirt so she could rub her breasts with one hand, and reach underneath her skirt to rub between her thighs with the other.</p><p>“Tonks…I’m close!” Harry groaned.  That was no surprise; this was his first sexual experience beyond some light over-the-clothes groping with Ginny that the redhead had bragged to Hermione about.  And Tonks, even limited by the form she’d assumed, knew her way around a penis.  Hermione was expecting her to pull off or slow down, but she only bobbed her head faster and stroked the rest of his length with even more force.  </p><p>Harry’s hands instinctually grabbed onto Tonks’ head as he came, and her form made it easy for Hermione to imagine him pulling her own bushy mane while she sucked him off.  The thought caused her hands to speed up as she continued to play with herself through her underwear.</p><p>Hermione had never seen a man orgasm before, but she was pretty sure Harry’s had lasted longer than normal.  He just kept going and going.  Tonks did her best to swallow it all, but eventually she pulled off, coughing.</p><p>“Forgot what it’s like to try and do that without using my morphing,” she said, wiping her lips.  “But damn, that was a huge load!  Not sure any normal girl’s gonna be able to swallow all of that.”</p><p>“Sorry I came so soon,” he admitted.  “It felt really good.  And watching Hermione, the real one that is, playing with herself didn’t help.”</p><p>Hermione froze, hands still on her body.  She’d thought the two had been so wrapped up in what they were doing that they hadn’t noticed her, but it seemed Harry had.  How embarrassing!”</p><p>“I-I can explain,” she stuttered, pulling her hands down to her sides.  </p><p>“No need,” Tonks said, grinning at her.  “You’ve had the hots for him for years now, and now you know how fucking hung he is too.  Sure I woulda done the same if I were you.”</p><p>Hermione didn’t know what to say to that, but thankfully something else soon took the attention off of her.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Tonks said, sounding surprised for the first time.  “You’re hard again already?  After that much?”  Hermione looked over and confirmed that yes, Harry’s erection had indeed returned. </p><p>“That’s not normal, right?” she asked slowly.</p><p>“Oh, definitely not,” Tonks said, laughing.  “That hung, that much cum, and he’s already hard again?  We’ve got a special wizard here, Hermione.”  </p><p>“We?” Hermione said faintly.</p><p>“We,” Tonks repeated, putting her hands down on the mattress so she was now on all fours. “You know you fancy him, and you know he fancies you.  Why else would he ask me to look just like you?”</p><p>Hermione nodded, unable to deny the truth in that.  She looked at Harry, who was smiling nervously at her even as his penis was rock hard, and she smiled back.</p><p>“You’re right,” she said softly, heart soaring as she watched Harry’s face light up.  “I want him.”  How could she not?  He was her best friend, but he was so much more than that.  He was handsome, he was powerful, and based on what she’d seen so far he seemed more than capable of satisfying every sexual fantasy she’d ever had.</p><p>“There’s room on this bed for three, you know.” Tonks said.  “I’m a good girl.  I can share.”</p><p>Of all the times she’d imagined this moment, Hermione had never pictured Tonks also being there, and looking just like her to boot.  It was an unbelievable situation, but watching Tonks suck him off had made her too damn horny to let any morals or inhibitions stop her from doing what she wanted.  She began to strip off her clothes. </p><p>“Good choice,” Tonks said.  “Come join the party, and <i>OH MY GOD!</i>”</p><p>Hermione, taking off her skirt, paused at Tonks’ sudden shout.  She soon saw the cause.  Harry had quite suddenly entered Tonks from behind as she was talking to Hermione while down on all fours.</p><p>“OH FUCK!” Tonks screamed.  “SO DAMN BIG!” </p><p>Hermione watched the scene uncertainly even as she finished removing her skirt.  Was Tonks in pain?</p><p>“SO GOOD!  DON’T STOP!”  Well that answered that.</p><p>Hermione bit her lip and rubbed her thighs together as she watched Harry work.  This wasn’t the shy boy she’d met so many years ago.  He was rutting into Tonks with confidence, and if she hadn’t known better she would’ve sworn he had tons of experience at this.  He definitely wasn’t shagging Tonks like a timid virgin who didn’t know what he was doing.  He slammed his hips into her from behind, delivering firm thrust after firm thrust.  Tonks’ body, or rather Tonks in Hermione’s body, rocked forward with every impact, her medium-sized breasts jiggling hypnotically.  She wondered if Harry would fuck her hard enough to make her own breasts bounce like that.</p><p>“C’mere, Hermione,” Harry said, smiling at her even as he continued to fuck Tonks without pause.  She smiled and crawled onto the bed in only her panties.  He turned his head to greet her with a kiss, one she happily returned.  She leaned into it, getting swept up in kissing her crush for the first time.  Her hands held onto his hair and she closed her eyes, savoring this moment.</p><p>Tonks was also savoring her own moment.  Harry hadn’t neglected her; even while kissing Hermione passionately, he kept right on fucking Tonks, the sound of his hips smacking against her arse repeatedly echoing throughout the room.  Out of the corner of her eye, Hermione could see the other woman pushing her lower body back against him, putting even more force behind each meeting of hips and arse.  It was quite an erotic sight, especially since the wanton woman currently looked exactly like her.</p><p>“FUCK!  CUMMING!” Tonks shouted, loud enough to hurt Hermione’s ears.  Harry kept fucking her while she squealed, the doggy style pounding not relenting all throughout her orgasm.</p><p>“Stop…stop,” Tonks moaned weakly after she’d come down from her sexual high.  “That’s enough.”</p><p>“Did I wear you out already?” Harry teased, pulling his lips away from Hermione’s, much to her regret.  </p><p>“Hardly,” she said, though her heavy breathing made it clear he’d done a number on her.  “If it were just the two of us I’d happily keep you all to myself, but I think you’ve got another witch to make happy right now.”</p><p>“True enough,” he said, looking back at Hermione.  He was looking at her like he’d never looked at her before.  Those vivid green eyes were sizing her up, planning what he was going to do to her.  She’d never been looked at with such open lust and desire in her life, and that it was Harry, her Harry, made her wet beyond belief.  She hurried to get her panties off, flinging them across the room as Harry pulled out of Tonks.  She morphed back into one of her more standard forms, pink hair and all, and moved over onto her side to watch what was about to happen.</p><p>“Merlin, you’re so hot,” Harry said, kissing her neck and running his hands all over her body.  She moaned when he squeezed her breasts and bum, and panted in anticipation as he scooped her up and put her down flat on her back.  He climbed atop her, and she eagerly spread her legs as wide as she could.  </p><p>“Like we did when we started, normally you’d need to get a girl going with some foreplay before you shag her,” Tonks said, apparently taking her role as teacher more seriously than Hermione had expected.  “Especially with a cock that big.  But luckily for you, your little bookworm is ready to go.”</p><p>Hermione blushed and bit her lip, but it was true.  She didn’t think she’d ever been this aroused in her life.  She felt more than ready to give her virginity to her best friend and his massive manhood.</p><p>Harry slid into her, and her eyes widened at the feeling of being penetrated by an actual penis for the first time.</p><p>“Careful,” Tonks said seriously.  “Take it slow.  Don’t forget that she’s a virgin.  Give her time to get used to it.”</p><p>He hadn’t always been the best student, but Harry dutifully followed Tonks’ instructions here.  He moved gently within her, showing a tenderness that had been absent in his rough fucking of the more experienced Tonks.  Hermione wrapped her arms around his neck and just enjoyed being filled by her best friend.</p><p>She had broken her hymen herself years earlier, so that was one less complication to deal with.  While she did appreciate the slow pace at first since he was so bloody big, it wasn’t long before she found herself craving more.  This wasn’t hurting as much as she’d always heard first times did.  He was large, but once she had a few minutes to get used to it, it felt like he belonged inside her.  He was a perfect fit, like she’d been made for this, made to be shagged by her best friend and his huge penis.</p><p>“More,” she whined.  “Give it to me harder, Harry.  I’m ready.”  He looked down at her uncertainly, but it was Tonks who spoke next.</p><p>“You heard the witch,” she said.  “Show her what you can do.  Show her what it feels like to get fucked for real.”</p><p>As before, Harry did as his self-appointed teacher instructed.  The careful, languid pace was promptly discarded, and he began rocking into her.  Hermione gasped and grunted as he started to move his hips and set a much more demanding pace.  Before he’d been making love to her, and now he was fucking her.  Hermione had never understood the difference until that moment but it was crystal clear now.</p><p>“How’s that?” Harry asked, looking down at her to make sure she was okay even as his hips gained speed.  “Still feeling alright?”</p><p>“It’s perfect!” she said, nodding furiously.  “Keep going!”</p><p>Harry nodded, lowered his head beside hers and gave it to her even harder, moving his huge prick in and out of her even harder.  Now it was the real Hermione’s breasts that bounced from the fucking she was receiving, and the real Hermione who moaned and panted like a bitch in heat while her man showed her just how strong he’d truly become.</p><p>The entire wizarding world knew what the adult Harry was capable of, knew it and were awed by it.  But only she and Tonks knew that his strength didn’t apply only to the magic he wielded.  He was also everything a man should be in the bedroom, and he was proving it to them both right now.  First he’d taken an experienced older woman like Tonks and surpassed her wildest expectations, and now he was giving the virgin Hermione a first time she would never forget.  He was also ruining her for all other men, but that was just fine.  She never wanted to be with another man as long as she lived.  She was Harry’s, and she wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p>Hermione howled as her body was rocked by an orgasm that made anything she’d ever achieved with toys or her fingers look like an absolute joke.  So he’d ruined her for masturbation too, apparently.  She couldn’t complain though, not when he made her feel like this.</p><p>“I know that look,” Tonks said from the other side, and Hermione was surprised when she saw how close her face was.  “He just got you off, huh? ”  Hermione nodded, one hand across her forehead.  “How’d it feel?”</p><p>“Amazing,” she managed, while he continued to fuck her even after her orgasm.  “Is it always like that?”</p><p>“No,” Tonks said, shaking her head.  “Harry’s a rare breed.  We’re both very lucky.”  Tonks suddenly leaned down and kissed her.  Hermione had never been interested in girls, but she was so horny that she not only accepted the kiss, she welcomed it.  She let Tonks’ tongue slither into her mouth and met it with her own.</p><p>“Merlin, that’s hot,” Harry groaned.  Hermione could feel him somehow speed up even more, his hips a blur as he drove that big cock into her with everything he had.</p><p>“Ooh, you like that, Harry?” Tonks teased.  “You like watching your two witches snog?”  She kissed Hermione’s neck just below her ear, and the brunette shivered.</p><p>“It’s the hottest bloody thing I’ve ever seen!” he said.  That motivated Hermione to surge forward and claim the older witch’s lips, initiating a kiss with another woman for the first time.</p><p>“Show us!” Tonks barked.  “Pull out of her and cover us both with your cum!”  Hermione wanted to protest, but belatedly she realized that letting him finish inside of her would be a very bad idea.  She would really need to start taking the contraceptive potion, and soon.</p><p>Harry pulled free from Hermione’s tightness, and Tonks quickly maneuvered them so Harry was on his back and the two witches were on their knees between his spread legs.  Tonks pleasured him with precise strokes up and down his length, giving him the last little bit of stimulation he needed.</p><p>A groan was all the warning they got, but Tonks knew what it meant.  She kept hold of Harry’s prick and pressed her head right against Hermione’s, aiming her straight at their faces.</p><p>Hermione shut her eyes as the first wave of semen came forth, hitting across her forehead.  Tonks held him in place and made sure they both took plenty of his cum across their faces.  Hermione felt some land on her cheeks and chin, and he somehow even got a bit into her mouth in the brief window of time it was open.  She swallowed experimentally, and was very pleasantly surprised by the taste.</p><p>“He’s done now,” Tonks said.  “You can open your eyes.”</p><p>Hermione cautiously blinked her eyes open and saw Tonks looking at her.  The pink-haired witch’s face was coated in semen, and she could feel that her own face was much the same.  Remembering the taste, she leaned in and licked a healthy amount off of Tonks’ forehead.</p><p>“Bloody hell,” Harry groaned.  Hermione looked over to see him kneeling on the bed, watching her with interest.  When Tonks took her own lick up Hermione’s cheek, his eyes narrowed.  “If you two keep that up, you’re gonna get me hard all over again.”</p><p>Hermione was breathing hard, but that wasn’t going to deter her.  She’d been waiting far too long for this.  She wiped more of his cum off of her own face and made a show of licking her fingers clean.</p><p>“Is that a promise?” she asked.  His eyes narrowed, and Hermione knew their night wasn’t over just yet.  Hopefully Sirius wasn’t going to come back any time soon, unless he wanted a free show.  Honestly, she wouldn’t put it past that dirty old mutt.</p>
