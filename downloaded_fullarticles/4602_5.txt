    <p>Mandy shot up from her sleep in a cold sweat, her head meeting wood. The harsh impact forced her back down with a grimace, as she rolled on her side, cradling her aching skull. A light cover, which felt a lot like burlap slid off her body. Tears gathered in the ducts of her eyes and the strong smell of a dirty mattress, sweat, and feet around her were not helping, as well as the lumpy surface where she lay."Ow.." She croaked, sounding much frailer than she's ever heard herself before. She wondered where she was and would have loved to have figured that out, alas, she couldn't. Mandy's vision was shot to shit. She reasoned it was because she hit her head on the sink in her bathroom, resulting in a nasty concussion. But the last time she checked, her bathroom did not smell like a dirty high school locker room. Her bathroom smelled of various fruits and occasionally a deliciously smelling cucumber melon candle she lit a short while after her significant other dropped a load in her toilet. <em>I shoulder really buy some Poo-Pourri. </em>She mused, groaning when a loud and very sudden slam disrupted her from her thoughts. The noise it made went through her head like a nail, metaphorically, of course. It also caused actual dust and sawdust from the narrowed corners of the walls to fall all around her. Mandy gasped, having been startled and jumped, hitting her wrist against the wall. She winced, knowing it would surely bruise. A shrill woman's voice could be heard from outside of what she would soon find out was an enclosed space. "Be quiet, you freak!" It had Mandy seething as she silently thought. <em>W</em><em>ho the fuck does this bitch think she is?!<br/>
</em></p><p> </p><p>"How about you make me bitch!" The crone, Mandy guessed, based solely on the tone of this awful old voice, choked on her spit, making an undignified noise that sounded similar to a dying cat. Mandy hoped whoever it was keeled over because she heard deep coughing. Heavy footsteps rattled the ground, irritating her aching head further. Whoever it was, they were getting closer. Her face was hot, and she could hear the beat of her own heart in her ears, thumping, and unpleasantly so. After a few seconds, metal clanking against its neighboring plates drowned out the sound of her heartbeat from how close it was to the side of her head. It echoed throughout the small enclosure. <em>A lock? did this bitch lock me in here? </em>Mandy was already having enough trouble trying to comprehend what was happening around her, the locks only puzzled her further and before she could even guess what was going on, the harsh exposure to a light hit her square in the face like a sharp lingering pain in her neck. Only it was flashing across her eyes, ceasing any further thoughts on the matter. </p><p> </p><p>She couldn't really think or bring herself to do much of anything other than shutting her eyes tightly with a wince, as a tight grip found its way around her throat and yanked her out of what she'd later find out was a small cupboard under some stairs. What was perhaps the most disturbing part about it was that this monstrous crone slugged her up and out like she didn't weigh anything at all, was it even the crone? A mute burly accomplice?  Mandy couldn't tell, her vision still one big blur, though she could make out the shapes of various furnishings and then the unclear but solid outline of the giant who hauled her out of wherever she was. It was hard adjusting to the light while trying not to choke on the hand around your neck, all while pulling yourself up on the wrist which held you up so your neck wouldn't snap should you let go. This beast must have been gigantic! Mandy's toes hardly grazed what felt like wooden floorboards beneath her bare toes. The light, and now the tightening grip around her throat added further irritation to her sensitive eyes. Her eyes shouldn't be this sensitive either! The most sensitive they've ever been is when she woke up with the blinds open in front of her bed after a night of intense bar hopping the day after her thirteenth birthday and shown brightly in them. <em>I must have hit my head really hard! </em>and that thought was almost enough to take her mind off of how she could no longer breathe. Almost. The muscles in her throat, however, forced her to pay attention to what was happening while it fought and flexed for air. Mandy panicked the moment she could no longer feel wood beneath her, now hovering face to face with what had to be a woman if the slight scent of perfume was anything to go by, but hey, maybe it was it was a guy? She wouldn't know, she was too progressive to assume, bra. "How dare you talk to me that way! After I took you into my home out of the goodness of my heart! Just you wait until your uncle Vernon gets home!" The crone grit out through clenched teeth. <em>Ok, so it's not only a woman but a giant old crone who was probably a linebacker for her school back in the day. This amount of </em>strenght<em> is unnatural!</em></p><p> </p><p>Mandy didn't think her vision could muck up much further, but it did. She was starting to see black dots, her circulation was being cut off she realized. Mandy started to kick and gag, trying to find her footing. She was terrified, but her thoughts on how she had to escape this beast's grasp were stronger than her fear. Seriously, this was the worst day ever. First, she hits her head, wakes up in a dark smelly locked room? With a nasty concussion, and she can't bloody see! The cherry topper was some insane giant older lady currently strangling her. She needed to end this before such large hands befitting an ogre crushed her windpipe, she didn't spend fifteen years studying Chinese acupuncture and the human body for nothing! It was a risk, to hang loosely by her neck, but one she was willing to take at this point. Almost. She kicked and struggled enough that the very tips of her toes touched the ground, when she brought her fingers down hard, making a rough jab at this woman's forearms in just the right places. As expected, both fell limp causing the woman to cry out in shock, releasing her hold on Mandy. Mandy's world spun, the palms of her feet soon meeting the floor, then the rest of her as she fell on her ass, gasping for air. The blurry outline of the giant woman fell to her knees, going into a fit of hysterics. </p><p> </p><p>Mandy coughed, wheezed whilst blearily rising to her feet.. Her throat was incredibly sore and she sort of felt like one of those victimized characters in an outlast video game. Out of the corner of her eye, she spots something shimmering under the light of what was a ceiling fan? Two, small glass circles sat upright back in the dark hole she was dragged from. In each piece of glass, was it somewhat clear on the other side. With the woman distracted, Mandy rushed to pluck them from the ground and put them on. <em>My</em> <em>god, I can see! C</em>rawling out of what appeared to be a cupboard under the stairs, albeit shakily, she froze once ducking out from under the frame at the sight of her attacker. "No fucking way..." The woman crying hysterically, now positioned on her side laying on the ground looked an awful lot like Petunia, horse-faced mother fucking Dursley!</p><p> </p><p>Which meant that no one broke into Mandy's house and threw her in the closet to rob her blind or some equally as strange hostage situation. The woman before her wasn't a giant either, though maybe she was... Mandy wasn't sure, but what she was sure of was that she isn't dreaming. The pain inflicted on her person was and felt very real. Mandy felt sick and threw up all over the woman's neatly done hair, which made the crone cry out even louder and throw up on herself, and all over the carpet too. Mandy threw up again from the unnatural empty feeling in her stomach, the wave of adrenaline long gone. The world seemed to spin. "What kind of nightmare have I arrived in?"Mandy rasped, wiping what looked like blood off the back of her mouth with an oversized sleeve. Petunia wasn't making things any easier with her ugly, loud hyena cries. Mandy wasn't going to leave this dangerous woman with just a pair of limp arms, it was too risky. She brought down her fingers again in a series of harsh jabs against her attacker, ignoring the woman's pleading for Mandy to stop. The woman would not be able to move for a very long time after Mandy was done with her, falling back on her ass again as she panted from fatigue. This woman was now rendered motionless like a Marinette doll that's strings were snipped. "Shut up, I can't fucking think!" Mandy rasped out painfully. Petunia's mouth snapped shut, appearing frightened at her, as she lay in vomit. A bloody chunk falling from the crone's hair, and into the tear duct of Petunia's left, shut, eye.</p><p> </p><p>Mandy felt extremely weak as if she'd taken two caps full of Miralax for a week, not that she ever did that... Ok she did, the point is her body felt extremely malnourished.<em> Just how long was I out!?! How long was I under those fucking stairs!?!</em>She thought, Shakily making her way down the corridor, using the side of the wall for support. Even then, pushing down on the side of the wall with her hands was a struggle and she eventually had to rely on her shoulder. She passed a mirror on the opposing side of the wall. Her reflection downright terrified her. "No..No..nonononono." The world started to spin harder, as she slid down the wall with a thump, no longer able to walk on her own. "This can't be.." She whimpered, bringing her hand up to the new bruise on her neck the shape of a handprint, or rather, Harry Potter's neck. It felt like an eternity, but Mandy's jade green eyes never left the mirror, as she stared at who she's somehow become. A thought struck her, bringing her hand down from her throat to the crotch of her oversized jeans. Her eyebrows disappeared into her hairline, ripping her hand away as if she were burned and exhausting herself in the process. <em>And I have a penis!</em> She was alarmed, or rather he was alarmed. <em>It wasn't a giant in there after all. </em>"I shrunk!" Harry croaked. The sound of a door creaked open, peaking Mandy's interest to glance over at where it had come from. She didn't have time to ponder who it might have been, and didn't really have to. The enraged shout gave the identity of this stranger away immediately."HARRY!" Vernon.. "Eat a dick!" Mandy or rather Harry managed to shout back, sounding just about as angry as the fat man.</p>
