    <p>Tony spun the ring between his fingers. The deep, dark garnet stone, framed in bright gold, glinted in the light. They were his colors, but they looked foreign on the jewelry. He focused on its engraving - a triangle, circle in the middle of it with a line cutting vertically through it, the top point to the center of the base. It was beautiful, even with the jagged crack someone stabbed into the very center of it.</p>
<p>Steve had told him to take it straight to Strange; that just made Tony want to keep it and poke at it even more. When he told Steve as much, Tony watched him fight the urge to roll his eyes but he was unable to hold back the flicker of amusement at the corners of his mouth. </p>
<p>“Magical artifacts from other dimensions coming face to face with my exquisite science, what could go wrong?”</p>
<p>“Why must you ask that?” Steve had groaned. Tony just winked at him, pressed a brief kiss to his lips and sashayed his way to the elevator. </p>
<p>Now, Tony dragged his finger along the smooth sides of the gem stone then moved to trace over the laceration. The roughened stone scratched the pad of his thumb. It had a hum of residual energy, yet every scan he ran proved this observation incorrect. Another drag of his finger and this time it caught against his skin, poking quick and sharp, and a drop of blood beaded on his thumbpad. </p>
<p>Tony hissed, pulling his hand back. His blood moved, spreading onto the gem, pooling into the slice that cut across its black-red surface. The ring heated and hummed some more, the energy no scans could detect only increasing in force. It shook and shook until it shot out of Tony’s hand and onto the workstation. The ring spun, clanking against the metal, and Tony took a step back, then another. </p>
<p>Between one breath and the next a beam of light shot out from the gemstone. For a moment, it was straight ahead, but then it vibrated and swung directly towards Tony. He barely had time to shout before the beam slammed into his chest. Tony felt his feet swipe out from under him but instead of hitting the ground he flew backwards. He braced, waiting for the impact of the wall but instead he kept flying, nothing but black-red light consuming him entirely. </p>
<p align="center">~~~</p>
<p>Tony floated in absolute nothingness before slamming into a force field, then he bounced again and again, and again, before landing on rough ground, grass under his hands and a tree trunk colliding with the back of his head. “Fuck!” Tony groaned, multi-colored sparks lighting the back of his eyelids. He felt underwater, wrong-side-right, disorientated, even the air tasted different when he finally managed a breath. </p>
<p>Forcing his eyes open, he could tell right away he was in a forest. The trees were thick and varied, beech, oak, pine, and sycamore all around him. As he looked around, he realized he sat towards the edge of the forest, a large field peeking ahead of him between the trees. The wind picked up, a piercing shriek that Tony realized wasn’t the wind at all but a scream coming from above him. He shuffled to his feet, moving towards the sound instead of away like he could hear Steve in his mind ordering him to do so. But this wasn’t the battlefield--at least, he didn’t think it was...he crouched low as he got to the treeline, wishing desperately he had more in his possession than just a ring. Maybe if he focused on working on the nano-suit instead of tinkering with magic artifacts. </p>
<p>There was a beat of silence before another shout, this time by a group of people, but it seemed to originate from up in the sky, not on ground level. Before Tony could clear his mind of the confusion three people on honest to god broomsticks shot across the sky. He blinked once, twice, then reached behind his head to feel for any cracks in his skull. The broomsticks came back, this time with one rider holding a ball. He threw it out of Tony’s line of sight and there was another boom of shouting. Then a man, blond hair poking out from under his helmet, flew fast from behind them, blowing a whistle from atop a broomstick of his own.</p>
<p>A...sporting event? </p>
<p>Yeah. He definitely had a concussion. </p>
<p>Since it seemed in both his reality and his own hallucinations there were no threats, Tony started to walk along the treeline. He let the shouting fade behind him, heading towards the sound of splashing water. Maybe he could follow a river to something that made any sort of sense. </p>
<p>As he walked, he thought he heard all sorts of sounds: the faint trotting of horse hooves, the scattering of spider legs against leaves, trees moving without wind as if they were in the middle of a conversation. A chill ran down his spine, feeling eyes from every direction pinned on him, but every time he looked over his shoulder, he was alone. </p>
<p>The water was a lake, calm and still except for the group of cape-clad children playing along the shore of the far end. He’d focused on the capes, but his mind was still trying to process the sight of the castle behind the lake. It reached so high it blocked the sun and it seemed like it had more towers than he could count. Near the lake, he could see a hut surrounded by a pumpkin patch, and it was the sight of huge pumpkins in what was supposed to be midsummer that made Tony start to laugh uncontrollably. </p>
<p>With no other plan in mind, he broke from the trees and headed for the castle. No one stopped him, though the kids on the other side of the lake looked up at him, waved, then returned to their game. He waved back, his hand feeling as surreal and confused as the rest of him. The castle only grew as he approached, and he lifted his head as its foreboding stone cut off the sky. The doors were nearly three stories high, but Tony pushed them open easily, far easier than he expected. </p>
<p>The inner foyer was empty, but there were signs of life coming from hallways and what appeared to be a great hall towards his left. Tony turned right, and found a narrow hallway with a small staircase that he took up to the second floor, halfway up it the staircase started to vibrate and move. Tony froze, hand gripping the railing hard until the stairs connected to another hallway and stopped moving entirely. </p>
<p>Tony took a deep breath and wished desperately for his armor, but at least this area was even more isolated. He walked down the hallway until it broke off with one path continuing straight and the other going left, he turned the corner left and slammed right into another caped individual, this one an adult, who had been more focused on the book in his hands than his own path. </p>
<p>But when he looked up at Tony his book was promptly forgotten. The man dropped his jaw, looking just as surprised as Tony felt, to be face to face with the mirror image of himself.</p>
