    <p align="center">Bile rose in Severus' throat as he walked into the Malfoy drawing room. The Dark Lord had sport today and Severus would know that wild mess of curls anywhere. Hermione Granger lay sprawled on the floor by The Dark Lord's feet.</p>
<p align="center"><br/> Judging by the unnatural bend of her arms and legs and how she held perfectly still save the panicked movement of her eyes, he'd say she'd been subjected to a full body-bind. Her eyes finally landed on him and she closed her eyes in what looked to be relief. Foolish girl, she'd be cursing his name by the end of the night. If she makes it through the night.</p>
<p align="center"><br/> Forcing a sneer to his lips, he pried his eyes away from the girl to look at Lucius. “Who caught this treat for our lord?”, he asked with disdain. With a smirk that almost looks more like a grimace, Lucius replied, “The snatchers brought her with Potter and his ginger sidekick, though unfortunately she shoved a portkey in to the boys' hands just as we were separating them.”</p>
<p align="center"><br/> Many questions are on the tip of his tongue, but the meeting will be called to order in a moment and Severus has no wish to draw the lord's ire. As the skeletal man calls them to order from the front of the room, Severus eyes the girl again assessing her current health. She looks half starved, on the edge of panic, and in need of a wash, but not too bloodied up yet. The night is young however.</p>
<p align="center"><br/> “My children we have a new toy to play with today. Harry Potter's mudblood whore has decided to grace us with her presence!”, the megalomaniac cackles and his henchmen share nervously in his laughter for they know his mood could change at any moment. “Who among you would like to put this trash in it's place?” he asks with glee.</p>
<p align="center"><br/> Severus knows if he hesitates too long, she'll be given to someone who will draw her torture out much further, but if he seems too eager it will be suspect. He's built a reputation among the death eaters as a man more interested in knowledge and power than torture or women. Before he has decided his plan of action Bellatrix skips forward and takes his choice away. He'd be damned if he let that twisted bitch destroy such a brilliant mind.</p>
<p align="center"><br/> Before the bint can utter a word, Severus' smooth baritone rings out across the ballroom, “My Lord? If I may be so bold to ask this boon, I would like to have the girl for myself.” Voldemort cocks his head and considers him as Lestrange scoffs in the background. “You've never asked for a pet before Severus. What makes this one special?”</p>
<p align="center"><br/> Breathing evenly and forcing his carefully crafted hatred of Harry Potter to the forefront of his mind for Voldemort to peruse, he states “I never could get my hands on Potter, but I'm sure his knowing I have his girlfriend will disturb him to say the least.” He arches an eyebrow at Granger and purrs, “I may even award you the coveted praise you always desired from me.” Then, with faux thoughtfulness, “Though I sincerely doubt you have much to offer.”</p>
<p align="center"><br/> With a smirk Voldemort ushers him forward to more easily converse. “Come Severus. Is your interest solely in striking back at Potter or is it more in favor of replacing the first mudblood?” Forcing himself not to flinch, he lets his disgust show. Re-purposing his true emotions to create a worthy deception, Severus then slips into his mask of arrogance and says “I no longer have interest in any of their kind. Any I showed before, was that of a callow youth.”</p>
<p align="center"><br/> As he withdraws from Severus' mind, he holds his gaze. “Very well. You may have this gift my loyal servant.” Just as Severus is about to breath an internal sigh of relief at how easy that was he adds, “As soon as the others finish with her, of course.”</p>
