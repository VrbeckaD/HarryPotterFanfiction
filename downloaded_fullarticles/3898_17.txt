    <p>Chapter One: Detectives on the Case!</p><p>It was mid-September, 2004 CE. People were wearing ill-fitting clothes and tapping at their flip phones all through London, and so one Agnes Orwell looked very out of place.</p><p>She was a little rough around the edges. She had this rounded nose, and thick, wavy, short brown hair (half up, half down), a frayed coat, and sleepy, morning brown eyes. She was speeding off to work, clutching her willow-wood wand in her pocket, and there was a gleeful earnestness about her.</p><p>The sun was in the sky, perched so far above everything. Agnes, in addition to her peculiar attire, had her morning coffee in hand. She was skipping along the sidewalk, trying to find an appropriate alley from which to apparate.</p><p>She found one quite quickly. She laughed, disappeared, and then she was in. She warped through space, who-knows-how-many meters underground, to her place of employment that she loved so. In a second, glittering black stone, a constant influx of floo-goers, and countless voices erupted around her. The Ministry was full of new life, young blood, and the bores of bureaucracy were now something to marvel at: after years of rebuilding, things had finally started going the right way.</p><p>Not stopping for a second, Agnes released her wand, letting it fall further in the (magically) deep pocket of her coat. She gripped her coffee cup with new ferocity in her right hand and secured the strap of her leather satchel in her left, and she was still running towards the elevator.</p><p>There was a near-crash-landing, but she found herself accompanied by fellow government employees, on the way to Level Two. She tried to strike up a conversation, but her shaky breaths and dishevelment ensured that no one would return the offer.</p><p>Level Two consisted of two main areas, the Auror Offices (second door left) and the Law Enforcement Patrol (second door right). The Patrol's was a bit smaller, but a fairly large branch of the Magical Law Enforcement Department. Many wizards on the Patrol did great work and were up-and-coming in the world. Agnes, however, was not one of those people.</p><p>She came into the Patrol mostly by chance. After she graduated Hogwarts (2001, a year off schedule), her plans had kind of drifted. She'd dreamed, a while back, of being a sort of magical archaeologist, always having best marks in History of Magic. But it wasn't something many people do, and she wasn't aware of any group dedicated to that sort of work, and so she threw an application at various Ministry Departments to see what would stick. She was hoping for the Department of International Magical Cooperation, but even that wasn't really a dream of hers.</p><p>You see, the odds were kind of stacked against Agnes. She passed all her tests, sure, did well on the NEWTs that she needed to. But she wasn't extraordinary, and even after the war, a Muggleborn Hufflepuff wasn't high on anyone's to-hire list.</p><p>So, she was assigned to the Patrol, but not in the way you'd think. She hadn't seen a second of fieldwork, rather, Agnes's area of expertise was paperwork. Only sometimes was it exciting things, like documenting arrests or gathering files on potential suspects. Most of the time, it was mundane things like expenses, medical records, and god forbid, dealing with the press.</p><p>She and a smattering of other low-salary, paperwork-sifting drones sat in the far corner of the Patrol headquarters. She made her way over to her desk, nestled near the filing cabinet she frequented. A fresh, inch-thick folder that comprised her daily assignment was already waiting for her. She got straight to it, filling out forms and chatting with her disenfranchised colleagues.</p><p>One of them, however, was the opposite of a talker. He hadn't always been like that, according to Agnes' school memories, but these days he was very focused on his work. He still looked rather elegant, though; she supposed he was a sharp contrast to Agnes in that way.</p><p>And so, yeah, it was Draco Malfoy.</p><p>___</p><p>It was later that day, in the evening. The artificial windows indicate so, a blue-black, starry sky permeating through the room. There was a bit of ruckus, some sort of celebration in the Auror Offices. Agnes rolled her eyes a bit. She eyed Malfoy, who doesn't realize her gaze but looks similarly irritated.</p><p>Most of the Patrollers had left. The pencil-pushers really stuck it out, staying typically until the Head of the Patrol left, a tired but stern woman called Henriksen. She emerged from her office, sending a bit of chill down spines, looking around the room, as if there was a particular someone she had in mind.</p><p>"Orwell and Malfoy?"</p><p>She'd identified Draco, clearly, but it took a little hand-raise for her to remember Agnes. She waved the two of them into her office, without any indication as to why.</p><p>Agnes was able to fight her away into Henriksen's office first, with Draco following closely behind. Upon entering, they sat in two fancy leather quilted chairs, and the Head plopped behind her desk. The walls were lined with portraits of the Heads before her. She took notes as she spoke, probably multitasking.</p><p>"There's a situation at Hogwarts," Henriksen said, not so much as looking up. "You'll be our envoys."</p><p>Draco flinched. Agnes was petrified in shock. This couldn't possibly be right.</p><p>"I know what you're thinking, but it's nothing dangerous, that's why I'm sending the two of you," Henriksen clarified, sensing their surprise. That took down the excitement a bit, but the two desk jockeys were beyond confused. "... I'm sure it's nothing... just average mischief, but we've got to send someone down there, especially with Shacklebolt breathing down my neck. Seeing as the two of you are fairly dispensable, no offense to secretaries, and the most recent Hogwarts graduates, I thought you'd be perfect for the job."</p><p>Agnes was certainly excited, leg shaking and a hint of a smile on her face. But yet, she hesitated. "Ms. Henriksen, are you sure..."</p><p>"Yes, I'm sure. This is an order, not an offer. A Ministry Car will be at your respective residences first thing tomorrow morning to transport you," she said, and she seemed quite finished. Malfoy leaned forward.</p><p>"If you don't mind me asking, what's the situation?"</p><p>It was the first time she'd heard him speak since school.</p><p>Henriksen looked up for the first time. "Oh, I can't say I completely remember. I suppose you'll learn more upon arrival."</p><p>And with that, she set down her notes, stood from her chair, picked up her briefcase, and disapparated.</p><p>___</p><p>The rest of the night was quite peculiar for Agnes. Oh, but her happiness, it did show, although she was alone.</p><p>The morning came oddly, rising and embracing itself, smirking. People seemed so far away from her flat, and they peddled along at an unprecedented level of weirdness. As soon as she saw the forest green car roll up out front, though, she was invigorated again, crashing down the fire escape, barely keeping hold of her trunk. Once she was out front, she turned around for a moment, to remember, and then she head out for the curb.</p><p>She was alarmed, though, by a flash of white-blond hair in the backseat. She was under the impression that she and Draco would be riding separately. Nonetheless, she was greeted by the kind driver, who stashed her luggage and opened her door.</p><p>She was apprehensive of speaking with Malfoy, so she merely made awkward small talk with the driver, until even he grew tired. She focused on the landscape for a while. The city quickly melted into countryside and hills and wildflowers, even quicker considering the car's magical assistance.</p><p>She'd only ever really seen or heard Draco from afar; he was two years her senior, and really seemed quite cruel. It made her somber to think of it, to be so young and to be turned so sour. Agnes thought that if things had been different, Malfoy could have been different, but all the same, she felt small around him. To be surrounded by one who thought so low of her kind, though sometimes made her angry, mostly made her afraid. She didn't like to feel that way.</p><p>"It's nice to meet you," Agnes said.</p><p>Draco looked distressed at the comment. "... You as well."</p><p>There was tension, and Agnes quite hated tension. "Are you at all looking forward to returning?" she asked.</p><p>"That would be quite impossible," Draco replied, all sharpness and teeth, and it was becoming difficult to ignore his distastefulness.</p><p>Silence, time passed. Agnes began again, "I think this should be fun."</p><p>Draco was going to say something; Agnes could see it on his face, but he stopped himself. From there, brief back and forth continued throughout the ride, and it so happened that she had a few nice conversations with the man. It mostly centered on the early days, the time at Hogwarts before darkness took up residency in their lives.</p><p>"Oh, I was always shit at Transfiguration. Too much maths," Agnes said. "McGonagall probably thought me a dolt."</p><p>"Truthfully, I was brilliant at most subjects," Malfoy said, a bit of laughter in his voice. Before Agnes could curse this overconfidence, he continued, "I spent most of my time, unfortunately, torturing my classmates, as you probably know. I fear I could've done something useful."</p><p>Begrudgingly, Agnes offered the man some advice. "Well. We're off to Hogwarts, partners on a real mission. After this, I'm sure opportunities will be at every corner."</p><p>"Maybe for you..."</p><p>"Oh, god, is this the first of many pureblood grievances?" Agnes groaned, because Draco Malfoy certainly did not get to be ticked about his squandered reputation.</p><p>"I suppose not," he replied.</p><p>And Malfoy smiled.</p><p>___</p><p>The castle was smaller than she remembered. They pulled into Hogsmeade, and then the driver said politely that they ought to walk from there. There was no snow around yet, only leaves and grass and cold. The trek to the school was not a small one.</p><p>"I'm feeling nostalgic!" Agnes exclaimed, letting down her short waves in order to maximize surface area: any was appreciated in this Scottish Highland weather. The pair of them, Orwell and Malfoy, clobbered along, met by a familiar face at the entrance to the grounds.</p><p>Headmistress Minerva McGonagall had on her usual emerald robes and poise. She shook both of their hands, though she didn't look overjoyed.</p><p>"I will give you the details as we go."</p><p>Agnes and Draco hardly knew each other, but in this moment, standing side-by-side and following closely behind their ex-professor, it felt as if they had just been out past bed, or had just been busted for performing a pranking jinx.</p><p>"So, Headmistress..." Agnes ventured. "What exactly has been happening?"</p><p>"Well, if you'd asked me not a week ago, I would have said nothing at all," the Headmistress admitted. "We may have a... delinquent of sorts, a cruel one. Considering the school's past history with containing security violations... well, the two of you are here to keep up appearances, I suppose."</p><p>That's when Malfoy started laughing.</p><p>Everything about this situation was weird.</p><p>"Are you well, Mr. Malfoy?" McGonagall said, turning back around for a moment.</p><p>"If public relations is what the Ministry had in mind, I can't see why I'm here."</p><p>"Well, I doubt that's what anyone intended, but Henriksen is a very by-the-books woman, and she insisted there was no one more fit for the post," McGonagall said. "But all of that is beside the point. The attacks have escalated, and I'd rather not take any chances."</p><p>Agnes furrowed her brow. The conversation had shifted to something far more serious. "So... what have been the specific incidents, if you don't mind?"</p><p>McGonagall gave her a solemn look, with sad, worn eyes. "Well, we've had students report lost personal items. The items were returned but horribly defaced, sometimes with menacing notes. What really spurred bringing the two of you in was Klaus Holmwood... a young one. He was physically attacked. Some sort of premeditated hex was put on him. The poor boy's still in the hospital wing," she explained.</p><p>By this time they had woven through the stone paths and entered the castle. They made their way to the Great Hall, the thought of which made Agnes smile a bit. McGonagall pulled out her handkerchief and lightly sneezed, then fixed her posture, preparing her entrance. "The students are at dinner now. I'd like for the two of you to introduce yourselves, say a few words. Perhaps just Orwell should speak, frankly. Mr. Malfoy, try not to look too much like yourself. I do despise receiving owls from parents."</p><p>They walked in, and it was yellow. All yellow and orange and light. The candles glittered in her eyes and she felt a warmness around her heart, and Agnes swore she hadn't seen the Great Hall this full of joy since her first or second year.</p><p>The students charged at plates filled to the brim with food more delicious than imaginable. They didn't even look up to see who had entered, too busy in their ramblings regarding Potions essays and Quidditch games. Headmistress McGonagall ushered them onto the stage, and all of the sudden they were being introduced.</p><p>"Welcome, students," McGonagall paused, waiting for the masses to settle down. Then she began again, still so measured and with such control. "Due to the concerns expressed regarding the recent acts perpetrated against the school, we are pleased to welcome two members of the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol, who will remain to investigate and protect us until the situation is fully resolved. They would like to say a few words."</p><p>McGonagall made her way back to her grand Headmistress's chair, and Agnes shifted uncomfortably. She edged over towards the podium. Draco was standing nearby, hands behind his back, clearly gleeful at not having to make a statement.</p><p>"Hello everyone!" Agnes said, and even though she kind of hated this, it was sort of a thrill. "I'm Agnes Orwell, and this is my partner, Draco Malfoy."</p><p>Suddenly, every child ceased any conversation. She could feel Draco's bulging eyes from behind her. Agnes cursed herself-- oh, but weren't they to find out sooner or later?</p><p>She continued. "We'll be monitoring the school... but it's not to smother you, or to patrol you, or to get any of you in trouble. We're only here to resolve a temporary security concern. If any student has a grievance or useful information, they should let either of us know. Thank you."</p><p>Feeling rather important, Agnes caught up with a leaving Malfoy, and the pair tore through the center aisle, and just as they left chatter began again, in hushed tones.</p><p>"Drinks at the Three Broomsticks?" she asked.</p><p>"I don't drink," Draco replied.</p><p>"Of course you don't."</p><p>___</p><p>The pair promptly checked into the inn, where their trunks had already been magically transported, but they settled on lingering in the pub. Agnes passionately ordered a Firewhisky, and Draco settled for water. He pulled out a small novel once they got to a table.</p><p>"So, why don't you drink?"</p><p>By this time, Agnes was on her second, and eyeing Madam Rosmerta for a third.</p><p>"I never got around to it," Draco said.</p><p>"What does that mean?" Agnes pried, because that was certainly not an answer.</p><p>Draco looked up from his book, struggling for words in his frustration, and his face looked kind of funny. "You're very thick, aren't you?"</p><p>"That's quite rude! Really. I'm sensing some issues in our partnership. I don't know how you expect us to hunt down the prankster with this attitude--"</p><p>"Shut up!" Draco spat, and things were more serious than ever. He looked at her with an intensity so immense that the only possibility was that someone of relevance had just entered the pub.</p><p>Agnes, after a moment, took a quick glance behind her. A crowd of professors was walking in, but she couldn't really tell what was the big deal, and then she saw him, and then she exclaimed:</p><p>"Harry Potter!"</p>
