</center><p>"This is ludicrous, Granger!" Wheezing. "Completely insane."</p><p>"Professor, please, you need to calm down."</p><p>"Don't –" Cough. "Don't tell me what I –" Cough. " – need, girl."</p><p>Sad, hazel eyes dropped to slender hands, raw from being kneaded nervously.</p><p>"The… guardianship would place you in my care, sir. "</p><p>"I refuse to even consider –" More wheezing. "– this option."</p><p>Abruptly, the girl stood up, hugging herself as she faced the disgusting white wall of the hospital room.</p><p>Slowly, small shoulders heaved.</p><p>"You will not survive Azkaban, not even for one day."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>She spun around, her eyes blazing. "Don't you want to live?"</p><p>"No."</p><p> </p>

</center><p> </p><p>"This is your room," she told him, drawing back the curtains, "you will find everything there, Professor: a davenport, bookshelves, a desk. Kreacher even brought your personal things from Hogwarts yesterday."</p><p>Silently, he placed a supporting hand against the doorframe of her childhood home, his senses overwhelmed by the warm, bright atmosphere.</p><p>"Whose – whose room was this before?" he asked, struggling for breath.</p><p>Shadows crossed her face, darkening her usual spirited features</p><p>"My mother's. It was her study."</p><p>Eyes locked, meeting in silent understanding.</p><p>"Dinner will be ready at seven, Professor."</p><p>"Thank you, Miss Granger," he rasped and she smiled.</p><p> </p>

</center><p> </p><p>He woke to her desperate screams. Again.</p><p>Silently, he crossed the hallway and let himself into her bedroom.</p><p>She was still asleep, her lovely young features contorted with fear.</p><p>Foolish Gryffindor. He shook his head. Showing her friends a brave face, while every night the memories curled like cold claws around her heart.</p><p>Sitting down on the edge of her bed, as he had done so many times before, he gently smoothed the damp curls from her brow.</p><p>"Shh… all is well," he murmured, caressing her cheek, "You can sleep now, Hermione. You are safe with me."</p><p>And she slept.</p><p> </p>

</center><p> </p><p>She had been too quiet these days, her kisses too desperate tonight.</p><p>Gently, he pulled her close, his lips trailing along her bare shoulder.</p><p>"Something on your mind?"</p><p>"Hmmhm."</p><p>"I see."</p><p>Time passed until she turned to him, burying her face in the hollow of his neck.</p><p>"You will be a free man from tomorrow on, you know."</p><p>"And?" Alarmed, he moved to face her.</p><p>She averted her eyes. "I – Well, you won't need me anymore, Severus."</p><p>Grasping her chin, he brought her mouth close to his, brushing her lips softly.</p><p>"Foolish woman," he murmured, "I shall always need you."</p>
