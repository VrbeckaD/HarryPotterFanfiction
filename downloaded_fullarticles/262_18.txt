  <em><u></u>Dear Hokage of the Village Hidden in the Leaves,</em>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>My name is Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</em>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>I stumbled across Konoha School of Combat Magic whilst finding an Asian magical to request to take part in a tournament. This tournament is the Triwizard tournament, where three schools (including Hogwarts) take part in a friendly competition. I've already sent requests to five other schools, and like most things in life, <strong>the early bird gets the worm.</strong></em>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>If you are able to join us in the competition, please send a reply right away. Term starts on September 1st (British Time) but the tournament will not take place for a while yet. The youngest that a champion can be is 17, but after a bit of research, I've come to realise that your school is not organised by age, but more on ability. So, if you would, some of your strongest would do quite nicely.</em>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>If you wish for your students to understand our culture better, they are free to join in on lessons. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Sleeping arrangements will be taken care of, and any specific food requests will surely delight our house-elves. The language barrier is also a problem, but I'm sure that you can handle that.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>However, there is also the concern of a certain Dark Lord returning, so I have come to realise that this might put you and your students in danger.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Please reply no later than a week.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Yours Faithfully,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Albus Dumbledore.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>P.S- A performance in our great hall will be greatly appreciated.</em>

  <em>Dear Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I would be delighted to send my students to partake in this tournament of yours. I can only send one student, as many of the strongest are out doing 'field work'.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>His name is Uzumaki Naruto (or in your language, Naruto Uzumaki) and he is one of my strongest students. As our name suggests, we focus mainly on the combat side of magic, so academic classes may do Naruto some good.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>However, Naruto is emotionally unstable right now, due to an unfortunate occurrence some while ago. He will mostly likely try to kill/ hurt/ maim anyone insults them, and if this cannot be done, he will probably give them the evil eye for the rest of eternity.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>To conclude my little speech on the mentality of my student; he is a mad as a hatter, as sly as a fox and very angry. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Yours,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Tsunade Senju</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Fifth Hokage of Konoha.</em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> Tsunade looked and was immensely pleased with herself. As she folded the letter and attached it to the owl, she giggled quietly to her self. Not only had she tricked some old geezer into thinking that Konoha was a <em>school, </em>she had also dumped her Naruto problems onto someone else for a while. Naruto needed some new and exciting places to keep him 'on his toes' and Britain was just the place.</p>
<p>Was Naruto going to be okay? Yes, he was going to be fine. Britain? Not so much.</p>
<p>She reached under her desk and pulled out a bottle of Sake. After downing over half of the bottle, she opened the window and watched as the owl flew away. She downed the rest of the bottle and dropped onto her desk with a clank as it hit the other seven, empty bottles.</p>
<p>Tsunade was drunk.</p>
<p>Extremely drunk.</p>
<p>"SHIZUNE~!" Tsunade bellowed, loudly.</p>
<p>The door flew open, and a panicked Shizune stumbled in.</p>
<p>"Lady Tsuande," She asked worriedly, "What is the matter? ARE YOU DRUNK?"</p>
<p>"Bring me Naruto, Shizune. And I believe you can answer the other question for yourself." Tsunade ordered.</p>
<p>Shizune's eyes widened. Naruto had only just come back, and had already punched a few people. But, she complied. There was no way she was going against a drunk Tsunade.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Albus Percival Wulfic Brian Dumbledore prided himself in not being surprised or caught of guard by many things in his life.</p>
<p>Having a fourth school reply (and agree) to the tournament, and send over a mentally unstable child was not one of them.</p>
<p>He was already mentally preparing for the worst.</p>
<p>Albus was going to have to warn the other teachers, and figure out how the tournament was going to work. He couldn't just sent this school away. It'd ruin his reputation.</p>
<p>"Let's hope Voldemort doesn't try to kill Harry this year."</p>
