    <p>“Shit!” Harry yelled into the empty common room. He had been in the dormitory having a nap and was slightly confused as to why Gryffindor tower was empty. He was currently reading a notice on the notice board where a big note was stuck reminding the 4th year and above students about the compulsory Yule Ball dance class that was starting in 2 minutes. Harry ran to the portrait and started to sprint towards the Great Hall. Once he reached the top of the stairs to the entrance hall, he realized he wasn’t the only one running late, as Draco Malfoy was running up the stairs from the dungeon.</p><p>“Running a little late their Malfoy.” He asked as they as they both reached the great hall. </p><p>“I was having a nap Potter.” He replied. Harry started laughing, causing Draco to start scowling. </p><p>“Sorry, it’s just funny.” Harry stated. </p><p>“What’s so funny about a nap?” Malfoy asked, now looking quite confused. </p><p>“That’s the same reason I’m late.” </p><p>“Oh, well we better get in there before we get into trouble with McGonagall.”<br/>
When they entered the hall together, they saw McGonagall and Filch fiddling with an old Gramophone, while everyone else was talking. The two boys separated and walked over to their friends. “Where have you been?” Hermione asked when he reached her and Ron, in a disapproving voice. She hated it when he was late. </p><p>“Sorry, I fell asleep and also forgot we even had this class. Hermione shook her head but had to drop the subject as it was at that moment that Professor McGonagall stepped up and called out for silence. When that silence had fallen, she started to talk. </p><p>“As you all know the Yule Ball is only three weeks away. I am assuming that you are all in 4th year and above. If you are below the 4th year and have not been asked to the dance by an older student, leave now.” Unsurprisingly about half a dozen first year girls all quickly scarpered from the hall, giggling the entire way out. “Now, this dance is an important part of the Triwizard tournament, you will all be representing our school, and therefore I expect each and everyone of you to be on your best behavior. And yes, that includes you both Mr. and Mr. Weasley.” Everyone looked at Fred and George. </p><p>“We aren’t going to do anything Professor. Are we Fred?” </p><p>“Absolutely not George. We wouldn’t embarrass our school like that Professor.” </p><p>“I’ll be making sure of that. As you were all told to, I am also assuming that you have all bought your date for the dance with you to practice with. I’m assuming you have, however I will still ask anyway, does anyone not have a partner?” </p><p>Assuming he was the only idiot to forget about getting a date to the dance, Harry very slowly raised his hand in embarrassment, not noticing that the room had one more raised hand in it. </p><p>“Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter, anyone else. McGonagall asked. Harry whipped his head around to look at Malfoy, who was looking back at him. How did Draco not have a date? Harry thought. He was very attractive, which should have made it extremely easy for him to get someone to go to the dance with him.<br/>
“Anyone at all?” No one raised their hand, so McGonagall nodded her head. “Okay, well you two will have to pair up together than, and I don’t want any arguing either. Now everyone pair up and we can get started.”</p><p>Everyone moved around the room, seeking out their dates, and turning towards McGonagall where they all awaited her instructions. Harry and Draco stood next to each other awkwardly. “We are going to start with a few basic steps. I arranged pervious to this class for Professor Snape to help demonstrate with me.” Snape moved to stand next to McGonagall, emerging from a corner of the room where no one had noticed him. “To start, the man must place one hand on the lady’s waist, whilst the lady will place her hand on the man’s shoulder.” As she said all this, McGonagall and Snape demonstrated so that all of the students could see what they meant. As McGonagall explained Harry and Draco just stared at each other. Which way did they do it? Who was meant to be the man and who was meant to be the lady between the two of them? “Potter? Malfoy? Is there a problem?” Snape asked, a sneer on his face as all the attention in the room was now on the two of them. </p><p>“No sir,” Malfoy responded. “We’re just trying to decide which way around we do this.” </p><p>“It doesn’t matter which way, just decide so we can move on to the next part.” McGonagall told them. </p><p>As both professors moved around the room helping and adjusting students if they didn’t quite have it right, Harry and Draco tried to decide which way around they were going to position themselves. However, they stilled hadn’t sorted themselves out when Snape got around to them. </p><p>“You still haven’t sorted it out?” His question sounded more like a statement, sighing in exasperation, Snape grabbed Malfoy’s hand and placed it on Harry’s waist, then taking Harry’s hand and putting it on Draco’s shoulder. “There! Sorted. Now grasp your other hands together. Snape walked away without another word, leaving Harry and Draco without a chance to feel embarrassed, as the music started almost immediately, and McGonagall and Snape started to demonstrate the first step while the students all followed.</p><p><br/>
	  </p><p>By the time the 2-hour dance class ended, Harry’s face was quite red, and Draco’s pale skin was even brighter red. It had been a most embarrassing 2 hours, with most of the students looking and laughing at Harry and Draco dancing together extremely awkwardly at some point during the class. It was so bad that Harry himself didn’t want to return to the class the next week. But that wasn’t the worst of it. They had all been instructed before leaving that they were required to practice with their partner outside of the class as well, especially Harry as he was a tri-wizard competitor, and had to dance with the others in front of the entire school and the visitors from Durmstrang and Beaxbatons. Harry and Draco weren’t enemies, but they also weren’t friends, so they did tend to argue quite a bit when paired up in classes. Now they weren’t only paired up but had to dance together as a pair. Harry was pretty sure that they were about to start arguing a hell of a lot more as they tried to perfect ballroom style dancing over the next three weeks. Before Draco could run out of the Great Hall and back into the dungeons, Harry grabbed his arm to stop him leaving. Draco was quick to turn around and try and pull his arm out of Harry’s grip, but Harry wouldn’t let go. </p><p>“What are you doing Potter? Let me go!”</p><p>“Not until we talk.” Harry said. </p><p>“Talk about what?” Draco almost spat at him. </p><p>“When we are going to meet and practice this dance. You heard McGonagall, we have to practice so we can be good, and I apparently have to be perfect which means you do to.” </p><p>Draco sighs and yanks his arm hard, breaking Harry’s grip and allowing him to start walking away. “Just meet me on the 7th floor at 7 tomorrow night.” </p><p>“The 7th floor is pretty big Malfoy. Want to be a bit more specific?” </p><p>“Just wait near the tapestry of trolls learning ballet.” With that Draco ran from the great hall so fast you would think he was fleeing for his life. </p><p>Harry stood, watching him leave for a moment before Ron and Hermione joined him. Together they all left the great hall and walked down to Hagrid’s hut. It was Saturday evening and they always went down to Hagrid’s for an hour before dinner. They were half an hour early today due to the time of the dance class, but they decided to go down anyway. It would give Harry a chance to talk to them all about how he was going to deal with Draco for the next 3 weeks. Hagrid was surprised to see who was there when he opened his door. He wasn’t expecting them for another half an hour and therefore didn’t have the tea ready upon arrival as usual. </p><p>“Wat r you lot doin ‘ere early?” He asked as he let them in and started to prepare the tea. </p><p>“We had the Yule Ball dance class and decided to come straight down when we finished.” Hermione explained. </p><p>“R’ght, I forgot bout that.” He said.  </p><p>For the next hour and a half, the three of them discussed the tournament, their classes, the students from the other schools and most importantly Harry’s problem of now being paired with Draco Malfoy for the Yule Ball. As the three of them were walking up to the school, back towards the Great Hall for dinner, Harry was still complaining about Malfoy. </p><p>“I mean, I can’t dance with another guy in front of the whole school! Everyone will make fun of me, they’ll think I’m gay.” Harry groaned. </p><p>“Is it really so important what the rest of the school thinks?” Hermione asked. </p><p>“Of course it does! I’m not just some kid that will be forgotten about a few days later. No one will forget, I’ll have to deal with it for at least the rest of the year. Great ammunition to give the Slytherins. I’ll never hear the end of it.” </p><p>“That’s not what I meant Harry.” </p><p>“What did you mean then?” </p><p>“If its not true and just a rumor based on an unfortunate situation why do you care so much? You know the truth so who cares what other people say?” Hermione explained. </p><p>Harry stayed silent for a minute, thinking about what she said. He thought it made sense in a way, but he still had to deal with the teasing. “I guess that makes sense. I just don’t want to deal with the teasing.” </p><p>“Harry, you spent nearly a whole year with people thinking you were the heir of Slytherin petrifying students. You survived that and you can survive this.” Ron said, trying to reason with Harry. </p><p>“Thanks Ron?” </p><p>The rest of the night the Yule ball wasn’t mentioned. As it was a Saturday, Harry and Ron spent most of the night playing Chess and discussing what the next task in the tournament may be, as Harry still hadn’t quite figured out the egg’s clue yet. Hermione sat next to them reading a book and occasionally pointing out a possible chess move, or commenting on a tournament idea the boys had had. By the time it reached midnight, Harry, Ron and Hermione were the only three left in the Gryffindor common room, everyone else had gone to bed a couple hours ago. Packing up their things, the three of them decided to go to bed as well, saying goodnight before Hermione walked up to the girl’s dormitories and the boys walked up to theirs. As it was silent with the other three Gryffindor boys all asleep, Harry and Ron got into their pajama’s silently, said goodnight and got into bed. Ron fell asleep very quickly, Harry could tell by the snores, but he lay awake in bed worrying. If tomorrows practice with Malfoy went bad, then he would have to try and get someone else to be his partner. Eventually Harry fell into a uneasy sleep dreaming of the worry’s that had been in his head all night. </p><p><br/>
	  </p><p>It was roughly 6:45 and Harry was leaving Gryffindor Tower, making his way to the 7th floor. When he reached it, he was looking at every painting trying to find the one with the Trolls learning Ballet, but instead saw Malfoy first, waiting for him at the painting. “Just on time Potter.” He drawled, leaning against the wall with his hips jutting out. </p><p>Harry shook his head to clear the image before he responded. “At least I’m here Malfoy. Now where are we practicing? Not in this corridor I hope.” </p><p>“Of course not, do you think I want people to walk past and see us?” </p><p>“Absolutely not.” </p><p>“Exactly. Go stand over there for a moment.” Malfoy instructed. </p><p>“Why?” Harry asked. Malfoy didn’t reply, just stared at him until he moved. “Fine.”</p><p>Harry stood and watched as Malfoy closed his eyes and walked back and forth three times in front of a blank wall. He was confused, wondering what the hell Malfoy was doing walking in front of a blank wall. What was that meant to… He stopped thinking as suddenly the wall started to change and a large door appeared. </p><p>“What is this place?” He asked Malfoy. </p><p>“A secret room that becomes whatever you want it to be.” Malfoy explained, looking proud about the fact that he had to explain what it was. </p><p>“What do you mean becomes anything you want?” </p><p>“Just get inside before someone sees us.” </p><p>They walked into the room and Harry looked around in shock. It was a decent size room, not to large but not to small. In one corner there was an old fashion looking sound system, with a bookshelf full of records next to it. There must have been about a thousand records there. The walls looked as though they were covered with pictures of couples dancing. The center of the room was empty with a large square of wooden floor, it looked like a dance floor. Staring around in wonder, he had no idea that Malfoy had been talking to him until he felt an elbow in his ribs which broke the stare. “Ouch! What the hell was that for?” </p><p>“Would you listen to me when I’m talking? I was saying that this room changes depending on the need of the person trying to enter. You walk back and forth in front of the wall three times thinking about what you want, and it will fulfill that need. So, I asked for a room to practice classical dancing.” </p><p>“This is amazing Malfoy. How did you know about this room?” Harry asked. </p><p>“Umm thanks. My father told me about it. He found it when he was here.” </p><p>“Wow. Well I guess we better practice then.” </p><p>“Okay, well lets just go onto the wooden floor and get started.” Malfoy walked onto the floor and pulled out his wand. Harry paused his own steps for a moment before he realized that Malfoy was pointing his wand at the shelf of records.<br/>
“Accio” he said, and a record flew into Malfoy’s hands. He then walked over to the old record player and set it up. When the music started it was the same tune that was used during the dance class the day before. “I thought it would be easiest to use the same music for now until we are good at this.” He said, walking back towards Harry who was now standing in the center of the dance floor. When he reached Harry, he automatically placed his hand on Harry’s waist and held his other hand up ready for Harry to grab. Harry hesitated a moment, then placed one hand on Malfoys shoulder and then the other hand in his hand. They stood for a moment just looking at each other until Malfoy broke eye contact and looked down at his feet. “Ready?” He asked. Harry just nodded his response then started to move his feet in time to Malfoy. </p><p>Even after only one lesson they were both moving quite well together, very synchronized, almost perfect. Harry was surprised with how gracefully Malfoy was leading the dance, it was like he had been doing this his entire life, which when Harry thought about it, he probably had. The Malfoy were basically the Wizarding World equivalent of Royalty, and therefore it was likely that he had been taught to dance when he was a kid and therefore already knew exactly what he was doing. Harry was not quite as good yet, but with the way Malfoy was moving he looked good anyway. It wasn’t until Malfoy surprisingly dipped Harry down that Harry realized he wasn’t even moving himself exactly. It was like Malfoy was the one moving him. They were looking straight into each other’s eyes as Malfoy dipped him, staring deep into each other. It was a surprising moment, but Malfoy broke eye contact again and pulled Harry back upright again before he could think about what the intensity might mean. At that moment the record finished playing and the music stopped, causing Malfoy to let go of Harry abruptly and walk over to the record player to restart it. Together they practiced in silence for roughly an hour, Malfoy refusing to look into Harry’s eyes the entire time, as they quite quickly got better and better every minute that passed. Well Harry got better, Malfoy was already perfect at it. When the hour was up, they left the room of requirement and walked in silence together until they reached the end of a corridor where they had to part ways to go to the right dormitory. They stood there awkwardly looking at each other for a minute before they spoke, this time Harry broke the silence. </p><p>“When do you want to meet again?” He asked Malfoy. </p><p>“Umm, well what about Wednesday? I have a free period after lunch.” </p><p>“I have a free period then as well, so that works. Same place?” </p><p>“Yes, that’s perfect. Well good night then.” Malfoy said, and almost ran away he moved so fast. </p><p>Harry watched him for a moment as he fled towards the dungeons. “What the hell just happened?” He said out loud to himself before walking up a flight of stairs towards Gryffindor Tower. </p><p><br/>
	    </p><p>The next couple of days passed quickly. Harry barely ever even saw Malfoy around the castle, and when he did Malfoy’s face would suddenly tint red and Harry didn’t understand why. However, as they weren’t friends, he didn’t bother worrying about it or asking either. It was none of his business after all.<br/>
Wednesday came around and halfway through lunch Harry decided to go up to the Room of Requirement early to play some records and maybe find something different to practice to today. When he arrived, he remembered what Malfoy had said on Sunday and did the same thing. When he opened his eyes, he expected to see a blank wall, thinking that Sunday night was a strange dream, instead he saw a large door the same as last time and hesitantly walked forward to see. The doors opened and the same room as last time appeared. So, did something else unexpected. Malfoy was already in there, browsing through the records on the shelf. He paused for a moment and watched, Malfoy hadn’t noticed he had entered the room yet. Moving carefully, Harry walked as quietly as possible until he was standing just behind Malfoy clearing his throat and laughing when Malfoy jumped, turning around as fast as lightning. </p><p>“Shit!” Malfoy yelled. “Ohh, I didn’t no you were hear.” </p><p>“I was coming in early to choose some different music for today.” Harry explained. </p><p>“So was I. I was thinking about this one.” Malfoy said, holding up a record. Harry just nodded his approval, so Malfoy put the record on, and they walked to the dance floor and started to practice. </p><p>This routine was how they practiced for the next 2 weeks. Every Saturday afternoon they had their dance class, then the practiced in the room of requirement every Sunday night for an hour, and every Wednesday in their free period after lunch. On the last Wednesday before Christmas, they completed their final practice. With one final turn Malfoy dipped Harry one last time before the ball, and just like the first time they stared into each other’s eyes as they did, and this time Harry felt something before they broke eye contact. He had no idea what it was, but it was unfamiliar and scary. As soon as he was on his feet again, he rushed to the door saying he had to go, and ran out of the room leaving Malfoy standing where he was looking at a closed door feeling very confused. What had he done? They had been starting to get along and could actually almost call each other a friend. Now he wasn’t so sure. </p><p>When Harry reached Gryffindor tower to grab his things for his next period, he found Ron and Hermione sitting in the common room also grabbing their things for the next period. Hermione was looking at him with worry, and now he was concerned about what his faced looked like. </p><p>“Harry? Are you okay? Where have you been?” </p><p>“I’m fine, I had practice with Malfoy, remember?” </p><p>“Right, sorry I forgot. Did something happen between the two of you, you look scared.” </p><p>“What? Ohh uh, no I’m fine. Just worried about it being the last practice before the ball.” Harry tried to sound a bit calmer than he was, but he wasn’t so sure that he succeeded, considering that Hermione still had the same concerned expression on her face. </p><p>“Are you sure?” Ron asked. </p><p>“I’m positive. Come on, lets get to Charms.” </p><p>The three of them headed towards Charms and didn’t mention anything about the dance practice again. </p><p>That night both Harry and Malfoy found it hard to sleep. They were both thinking about what happened in the Room of Requirement earlier, wondering different things. Malfoy was wondering what had happened. He thought they had been getting on so well and were friends now, but he had no idea why Harry had run out like that, what had he done wrong? He must have done something to cause a strong reaction like that, he just didn’t know what. Whereas Harry was trying to work out what the feeling he had earlier had been. He was so confused. He had never felt it before, and it had happened as he was looking into Malfoy’s eyes. Had he been attracted to him? Was he maybe gay? If he was then the Yule ball was going to be even harder for him, dancing with Malfoy if he had feelings for him was going to been almost impossible. Unfortunately for them both, they still had to dance together, but maybe they could sort it out before the ball. If Harry could get up the guts to talk to him before then that was.</p>
