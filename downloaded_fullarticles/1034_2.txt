    <p>Falling from the Astronomy Tower had not been the plan to end it all. She'd taken a poison that would kill her painlessly after putting her to sleep after all. She'd just wanted to be up there so she could look at the stars one last time and try to feel that calm that they used to bring her as she left the mortal coil. So taking a leap from there would have been useless excess.</p><p>But then someone (probably that bitch Evans) decided to send another one of those horrible pictures to her with an anti-combustion charm on it. The image mocked her, showing the violation of her person. The one she never had a chance to fight against because someone had slipped her a potion either during dinner or during the post exams celebration party.</p><p>She hadn't even had wanted to take part in that party but someone had managed to make sure nobody could get into the dorms from the common room unless they'd had two drinks minimum to rejoice that exams were over. If she could go back in time, she would have told herself it would have been worth the time spent dismantling the wards on the doors.</p><p>Then she never would have had a drink that somehow kept getting refilled or somehow drunk so much she lost cognition and awoke by Filch in an abandoned classroom, her mind blank with no bottoms beneath her robes and her body sticky with semen and blood between her thighs.</p><p>Oh she knew exactly who was responsible for it. The same ones who had spent more than half the party talking with her, getting to know her and making apologies for their pranks on her because she seemed like she was actually pretty cool. Those bastards...</p><p>Somehow during the violation and loss of her maidenhead someone had taken pictures. Probably Black since she'd seen him mess around with a camera during the year.</p><p>Most of them were with her and Lupin but there was one with Potter and Black double teaming her and one with her and Peter Pettigrew.</p><p>She'd wanted to press charges. Tried to talk to someone. But every time she found herself unable to speak. She wouldn't find out until after she died that it was because she'd been placed under the Imperius by the Headmaster.</p><p>So she suffered.</p><p>She suffered as the Marauders harassed her. Mocked her and Black and Potter secretly sent lewd messages during class.</p><p>She never gave into their suggestions. She kept her head held high and gritted her teeth and spent time crying in the bathroom because she couldn't do anything to stop them.</p><p>And then Evans who was dating Potter got hold of the pics and the proceeded to scream at her while throwing them at her with the entire school watching in the middle of the Great Hall. She'd never been friends with Evans or her clique but up until then they'd been relatively friendly. That was over as Lily Evans and her little gaggle of female friends would make her life a living hell on top of the one the Hogwarts became after the incident.</p><p>Her family would never find out about the abuse because Dumbledore cast a school wide repression and security spell that prevented any information being revealed outside the school walls of the actions by his most precious Gryffindors.</p><p>Of which apparently he did not view her as one of despite her being in the house.</p><p>No one wanted anything to do with her. She'd never exactly been a popular person but after the Great Hall, she was completely alone. Alone to suffer abuse by random people and members of the House of Bravery and Chivalry.</p><p>She wanted to burn down the entire tower.</p><p>The teachers turned a blind eye to what was going on. They saw her suffering and did nothing.</p><p>She didn't know what to do until her period ran 3 months late and she went to Madame Pomphrey for a medical exam.</p><p>It was then she found out she was pregnant.</p><p>That was her breaking point.</p><p>There had been several people who would tell her to go kill herself – Evans was one of them and the most frequent offender. And if it hadn't been for the pregnancy, the dishonor that having a child while both teen-aged and unwed would bring to her family that she never would have done this. Even if she somehow managed to explain and produce the evidence how this came about, the stigma and disgrace would still be there. Though her parents loved her, she had little doubt they could have ever looked at her the same.</p><p>So she brewed a poison. Painless and reasonably fast acting. She decided to go to Astronomy Tower and look at the night sky as she drank from the vial.</p><p>She did not plan to fall off the tower's edge trying to get away from an violent picture.</p><p>But then again, there was a lot of things she hadn't planned on.</p><p>Like the next thing she would see after hitting the ground and watching the aftermath of events would be the face Lily Evans and James Potter looking down at her with the joy of new parents.</p><p>They mistook the howls of rage fueled crying as her needing a nappy change.</p><p> </p>
