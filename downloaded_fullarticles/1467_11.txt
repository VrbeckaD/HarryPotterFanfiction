    <p>This morning in Privet Manor begun just like every other.</p><p><br/> Quick, loud footsteps could be heard running up the stairs of an extravagant looking manor. A rather rude noise to be making so early in the morning. A loud thud was heard from the other side of a small door , the noise making the entire attic shake and a raven haired boy to jump up in his bed , violently woken up.<br/> <br/> " Get up boy! It’s already seven .We need to have the manor sparkling before our guest arrives ."<br/> <br/> The loud roar from the other end of the door became distant  little by little as the woman screaming was walking down the stairs as she spoke.<br/> <br/> " Yes ma’am " said the boy and rubbed his tired eyes , not really answering to anyone.<br/> <br/> Harry was so used to this routine by now that even his answers to his relatives demands have become automatic by now. He would answer even if no one was there to listen to him.<br/> <br/> No one was ever listening to him anyways.</p><p>Harry had been living  with the Dursleys since he could remember. They always treated  him like a servant even though they were his only living blood relatives . Harry was basically non existant to most people in his town as the Dursleys never spoke about him, and Harry wasn’t allowed to go out alone to have fun or socialize like any other normal human.</p><p>You see, Harry has been unfortunate enough that after his parents tragic deaths he had to end up in a household full of people who dispised him. Even though Harry had no idea why, his family seemed to think he was the worst thing that ever happened to them.</p><p>He guessed it was because of how different he was from them. How ‘ abnormal’ he looked and acted compared to them. Harry was the exact opposite of his cousin Dudley, which his aunt and uncle loved so much that it kind of made sense that they would hate Harry.</p><p>Dudley had light blond hair that barely reached his ears. Harry had thick black hair that were always too long and messy for his aunt’s likings. Dudley had light blue eyes while Harry had deep green ones. Dudley had light rosy skin while Harry had a darker, sun-kissed skin that was usually covered in bruises from chores or from when Dudley and his friends simply needed a punching bag. Harry was also more on the skinny side , thanks to the neglect of a proper diet by his family for years,while on the other hand Dudley looked like a proper copy of his rather large father with the difference that Dudley had more muscle than fat.</p><p>Last but not least, Harry had a noticable scar  alongside his forehead that had the shape of a lighting and it’s color was a tad lighter than his normal skin tone.That seemed to be one of the characteristics his family hated the most about him but Harry decided to not mind the scar and simply accept it as a part of him.<br/> <br/> He quikly got up to his feet and started to get ready , he put on his round  black glasses (which somehow ended up being always broken) and didn’t even bother to fix his unruly hair that were sticking out from everywhere .</p><p>He would spent all his day cleaning the manor and the garden so his appearance didn’t really matter. He would just have  to endure the dissaproving glares from his  relatives . Which  they would shoot at him either way even if his hair were slicked back like a ‘normal’ person’s would.</p><p>Harry started walking down the stairs, heading to the dining hall where the Dursley family should already be gathered , waiting for their  breakfast to be served. He thankfully had already prepared the things from the previous night , so he only needed to brew them tea and coffee. Harry liked being a bit ahead on his work cause he knew he would be given much more than he could handle a day. Lost in his thoughts  he found himself in front of the giant white door of the dining hall.</p><p>
  <em>Lets hope they are in a good mood today ..</em>
</p><p>Harry knocked on the door lightly.</p><p>" Get in." The stern voice of his uncle said and Harry walked in the room with a fake smile on his face to greet them.</p><p>As he suspected the entire Dursley family was already sitten at the large table of the dining hall. The hall was an average sized room with a table too big for the place and a big golden mirror matching the length of the table along with a painting of a mountain scenery,  it’s frame also gold. Extravagant and ugly. Just like every room in the house.</p><p> The table was dressed in white tablecloth with brown details and a white – brown set of plates and silverware to match. In the middle of it was a large vase which accomodated a boquet of white dianthus that Harry had made yesterday. Seeing that it was still on the table made Harry sigh in relief , afraid that it would be disliked and thrown away by his aunt as the previous ones.</p><p> "Good morning" Harry adressed to the family and bowed slightly. He hated doing that but had learned the hard way that being polite meant less chores.</p><p>"You better not sleep in again! It is not my job to come wake you up ." Screeched his aunt instead of a response to his greeding.</p><p>
  <em> It's not my job to make you breakfast every morning either but here we are. </em>
</p><p>"I'm sorry ma’am it won’t happen again." Harry said and bowed his head again.</p><p>"I shall go bring your breakfast."  </p><p>With that he turned around and got out of the room to head to the kitchen ignoring the angry mumbling of his aunt and the loud mocking sound from his cousin at his mother’s curses towards Harry.</p><p>Thankfully the kitchen was pretty close to the dining hall so his trip from one room to another didnt drag for long . At least they couldn’t complain that their tea was cold. Of course that didn’t stop them from complaining about a hundred other things but still.</p><p>The kitchen was  a relatively small wooden room , dared he say the smallest room in the house after the three bathrooms and the attic that Harry lived in. It wasn’t a problem for him though , having a slim build made it easy to move in small areas such as this room.</p><p>Harry actually liked the kitchen. It was always warm in the winter and no one else but him came down there, making it somehow his own territory. Harry had very little possesions that were truly his so even this small place made him feel grateful.</p><p>As he was making his way through the kitchen he heard a light hissing noise coming from the small window above the stove. The window looked at the back garden of the house which waa filled with flowers and bushes that Harry had to attend to daily.</p><p>He walked closer to the window with a bit of hesitance , if it was a cat he’d have to make sure it didn’t get in since aunt Petunia was allergic to anything with too much hair ( Harry included).</p><p>It wasn’t a cat. It wasn’t even close to a cat. No fur.</p><p>A little green snake was sprawled across the wooden window looking pleadingly at Harry to let it in. It let out another low hissing sound and made a move with it’s head pointing the inside of the kitchen before turning again to Harry.</p><p>Harry was standing dumpfounded , looking at the movements of the snake , a smile slowly forming on his face. He gave a quick glance at the stairs leading upstairs before opening slowly the window.</p><p><strong><em>"Come in now but please dont go running around the house."</em></strong>he hissed and motioned to the snake to come in before closing the window again.</p><p>The snake slithered inside and curled around itself protectively, taking in the warmth of the house and the new environmemt it found itself into.It lifted it’s little head up and looked at Harry.</p><p><strong><em>" Not many speak the language of the snakes. You are the first hunan I meet who can. "</em></strong>  the snake had now lifted it’s head higher examing the boy in front of it.</p><p><strong><em>"It’s a thing I always could do..."</em></strong>Harry replied , slightly shrugging <strong><em>"I don’t think anyone else around here does though."</em></strong></p><p>Of course Harry knew far too well that no one else but him could.When he mentioned his ability to talk and understand snakes at the age of 6 to his aunt , Petunia had looked at him like he had just grown horns at the sides of his head.</p><p>He soon realized it was an ability that wasn’t normal to have , and after getting beat up a couple of times learned not to use it around other people. Especially his family’s important ‘friends’.</p><p>The snake nodded slighty and kept staring at him.</p><p>The piercing stare of the snake was making him slightly uncomfortable. He was considering that maybe opening the window wasn’t the wisest choice , but Harry was never considered wise to begin with.</p><p>
  <strong> <em>"Thanks it was really cold out.You are kind for a human."</em> </strong>
</p><p>That was..surprisingly polite. Most snakes Harry spoke with either run away , fearing the human that could understand them or got bored of him pretty easily and run away again after he fed them. Maybe this one would be a keeper.</p><p>
  <strong> <em>"No problem ,are you hungry ? I coul-"</em> </strong>
</p><p>"BOY HURRY UP"</p><p>His uncle’s shout cut Harry’s sentense in half and made him slighty jump from surprise. He had almost forgoten all about breakfast and the hungry Dursleys. The little snake jolted too , taken back by the loud noice.</p><p>"Crap..I’m going to be yelled at again." Harry said , mostly to himself since the snake couldn’t understand him  and grabbed the tray with the breakfast , carefully eyeing everything to make sure it was okay.</p><p>Satisfied with what he saw he went to turn around but stopped at his tracks and looked back at the little snake.</p><p><strong><em>"Make yourself at home while I’m gone. I’ll come back to feed you." </em></strong>And with that he was out of the kitchen heading to the dining hall.</p><p>
  <em>Please don’t be too mad, please don’t be too mad.</em>
</p><p>With that as a last thought he knocked softly on the door and got in.</p><p>"You are late, maybe you really want me to give you extra work today." Aunt Petunia said the moment he walked in with the tray. She stared at him with an expression that always made Harry think someone just made her eat an extra sour lemon.</p><p>" I apologize." He said not really showing any signs of remorse. He really hadn’t been that late and his relatives could easily afford more capable maids than him anyways. So really they had no reason to complain about his tardiness.</p><p>"Just serve the food already you freak." His cousin shouted from the othe end of the table. He had already managed to break a small plate , it’s fragments all over the carpet of the dining hall, giving Harry already extra work to do.</p><p>Harry didn’t need to be told twice and served breakfast like every morning before tending to the broken plate on the floor.</p><p>When serving Harry always had a line.First uncle Vernon , next Dudley and last aunt Petunia who ate way less than the two men in her house.</p><p>Of course Harry didn’t have a place in the dining hall since he always ate in the kitchen whatever leftovers they had. He decided he would eat later while also feeding his new snake friend.</p><p>Aftet serving his aunt last , Harry went and stood close to the door ready to leave when they dismiss him. His aunt let out a scoff and turned her attention from her plate to her husband who had been too focused reading his newspaper to even glare at Harry. Which was good since Harry hated uncle’s Vernon angry face more than anything.</p><p>" Vernon when did you say  Umbridge was going to be here?"</p><p>Okay he takes it back. If he hated anything more than his uncle’s mad face it was that stupid upper class frog witch. Harry was pretty much convinced that this woman had been created just to make his already miserable life more miserable. Also he was 100% convinced she had cursed him multiple times.</p><p>Umbridge had been close friend’s with the Dursleys ever since she moved from the heart of the Kingdom of Howgarts to the outskirts of the Kingdom almost 5 years ago , when Harry was 12.  Before the move she was one of the honorable judges in  Lord’s Tomas Riddle Sr. own court. She said she moved  because she wanted to be closer to the Gryffindor district but Harry was pretty sure the Lord got really annoyed with her and ordered her to move.</p><p>Still even after her departure from the King’s court she had money, high positions and knew many upper class wealthy families which made her a perfect candidate of friendship to the Dursleys.</p><p>" Around noon." was the short reply by Vernon who took a sip out his coffee and went back to reading his newspaper.</p><p>Harry felt a groan tickling up his throat because he knew exactly what was going to happen next.</p><p>His aunt had turned her attention back to him , a stern tone in her voice as she spoke. "You heard him. I want every room in this manor to be sparkling by the time our lovely guest is here.I want you to scrub every inch of the foyer , the living room and the dining hall."</p><p>Harry silently noted that Dudleys room could never look sparkling no matter how hard he tried since the boy was going to make even more of a mess in it once it was clean.</p><p>" We need to impress Ms. Umbridge after the disasterous last time." She sneered and gave Harry a dirty look.</p><p>He hadn’t meant to set that snake at her last time, it just liked pink stuff and she happened to be covered with it. Harry did miss Gabriela , by far the best snake he had the pleasure to accomodate.</p><p>"Have I made myself clear boy?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Three sets of eyes were set on him , anger boiling just underneath. But Harry knew how to make a quick recovery.</p><p>" Yes ma’am."</p><p>This day was bound to be a long one.</p><p> </p><p align="justify">                                                                                                                     <strong> ****</strong></p><p>" This is ridiculous!" </p><p>A loud crashing noise followed the shout that had been heard from the King’s conference room in the west wing of the castle.</p><p>" A seven day masquarade ball to celebrate my birthday?What a joke. I despise balls. And furthermore I despise you , deciding my future for me."</p><p>Prince Tom was now standing , his chair thrown to the floor , facing at the other end of the table  his father who had spent most of this meeting sighing and massaging his temples in agony.</p><p>" There is absolutely no reason for me to get married father. I am perfectly capable of finding a mate of my choice when I actually wish to do so." the prince exclaimed and threw his father another harsh glare.</p><p>The King shook and lifted  his head and glanced back at his son, his stare too tired and distamt to hold any actual hostility. He was getting too old to stand his son’s tantrums.</p><p>" And when do you plan on doing that?" He already knew the answer.</p><p>"Not as soon as you want me too, apparently." The tall boy sneered and and run his hand through his thick chestnut colored locks before crossing his arms in front of his toned chest.</p><p>Tom had decided to walk around the room ignoring the scared glances he was getting from the Royal councelors. A bunch of old coots if you asked him , getting frightend of a mere violent action showed a weak heart and will. Neithet of which belonged to the ruling of a kingdom. He was going to change that once he was in charge but for now-</p><p>
  <em>I have to find a way to stop this marriege nonsense from happening.</em>
</p><p>" Tom , my boy." the clear voice of Albus Dumbledore stopped his train of thought. A frown was quickly curved in his beautiful face. He couldn’t stand the old man , since he had first applied for the Royal council Tom knew he was nothing more than a mad man with a bit too much power in his hands.</p><p>
  <em>An intelligent manipulator .</em>
</p><p>An idea that the rest of the Kingdom didn’t share with Tom. They all placed Dumbledore in a high pendastal after he defeated Lord Grindelwald in the 1st war of the Kingdom with the Dark forces.</p><p>Won with mere luck if you ask him. Grindelwald was an extemely powerfull tyrant. Had it not been for his feelings and past friendship that he shared with Dumbledore, he wouldn't have been defeated.</p><p>" I believe that the King expects from you to show cooporetion. I am sure , you most of all people understand you need someone by your side to truly rule a kingdom and the benefits that it provides. You are smart enough to understand that Tom"  a knowing smile forming on the old man’s face. " Also who doesn’t enjoy a party? You never know who or what you are going to meet."</p><p>Tom felt like throwing the chair that was laying on the floor , straight to Dumbledore’s face. His patronizing tone made the prince despise him even more. He was aware of the benefits of marriege, but he also knew the disadvantages of it. Love made people lose themsleves and Tom wanted none of that. Trusting people besides himself was already hard enough, not that it was his fault. Judging from how useless and incompetent the «elite» of the Kingdom was , Tom couldn’t even begin to imagine what the middle and lower class acted like.</p><p>"Exactly my lord! And marrying into a wealthy family of our kingdom can bring many economical and political benefits to you once you are crowned." the rather high pitched voice of another bearded man of the council added and Tom wished that he had the power to hex the man.</p><p>He already knew all the children of these wealthy families, and he could proudly say that none of them met his standards as a lifelong partner. He wasn’t going to waste his life with someone so below him. They served fine as right hands and loyal followers but nothing more.</p><p>" I am getting old Tom. And when the time comes I want to know you’ll have someone beside you to help you rule." the king pleaded.</p><p>"I can rule fine on my own. You should know how capable I am by now." he mumbled under his breath and turned to face his father once again. It was true the king was getting pretty old to do as much for his kingdom as he used to. He didn’t have the power he used to but Tom still couldn’t see the reason for the continously pushes for him to find a mate.</p><p>King Riddle avoided his son’s fierce glare that was coming from grey blue eyes similar to his own and stared down at his already wrinkled hands, playing with the golden locket on his chest. Tom’s mother’s locket.</p><p>Tom hated when he did that.</p><p> That was a heirloom from his mother’s side of the family. The house of Gaunt , decendants of the powerful and prideful house of Slytherin. The prince found himself extremelly proud to be the only living heir of the Slytherin house rather than being the King’s son.</p><p>And the King knew that all to well.</p><p>Which was why he was using this heirloom to control his son at this very moment. He was always aware of Tom’s favouritism towards his mother. He finally lifted his head and stared back at his son , a look of fake hurt and fake pain in his eyes.</p><p>"Son …you need to understand the rules of this country, to be a king you shall be wed. Your mother would have loved to see you happy with someone you truly cared about. That’s why I –"</p><p>" Don’t.Even.Continue."  </p><p>The King stopped and raised an eyebrow at Tom’s harsh tone.</p><p>Tom was boiling with anger.</p><p>He wasn’t going to fall for it. That poor excuse of a king and father  had already stooped so low as to use his late wife’s love as a motive. It was pathetic. Nothing more than pathetic. He was pathetic.</p><p>Yet, Tom could’t help but agree that his mother would have insisted more to this marriege than his father and the council did but for entirely different reasons. His mother would have wanted Tom to find '<em>The One' </em>just like she thought she did when she was wed to the King.</p><p>But Tom knew better.</p><p>" I accept." He stated and felt the atmosphere of the room getting lighter. "Under the condition that only and if only I truly fall in love in these seven days I shall marry. If not I will not talk about marriege again anytime soon."</p><p>A self-satisfied smile formed on King Riddle’s face.</p><p>"Then, I shall order for the invites of the ball to be sent out, all over the Kingdom to every young man and woman who wishes to woo our Ice Cold Prince and melt his cold heart."  he exclaimed and giggled , making the rest of the council force out a laugh too.</p><p>Tom had already started walking towards the door , feeling the stare of a familar pair of clear blue eyes behind half moon glasses on his back.He needed to find a way to sabotage his own ball.</p><p>And he knew exactly where to turn for help.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                             <strong>  ****</strong></p><p>Harry couldn’t say he was expecting the day to become any worse but the loud sound of the doorbell informed him otherwise. As irittated as he was he threw his mop to God knows where and run to open the door.</p><p>"Goodmorning Ha- oh gosh!"  the mailman let out an acclamation as soon as Harry opened the door to greet him. He didn’t blame him.</p><p>"Oh my God Harry, what on earth happened to you?" the mailman’s voice showed high levels of concearn and Harry would feel rather good about it had it not been for his foul mood that day.</p><p>Harry did look worse than he usually did.His usually unrully hair , were simply a mess , his glasses were even more broken than they were yesterday ( Thanks Dudley , really wanted to see what falling off the foyer’s stairs felt like) and his usually bright green eyes now held a distant look underneath his scowl.</p><p> He had worked his ass off yesterday and had been made to attend to all of Umbridges needs, which meant a whole day of suffering with no pay off. He had been waken up at five today too to simply make sure the frog didn’t need anything before her departure.</p><p>Also the little snake he had let in yesterday was nowhere to be seen which made Harry’s bad mood, worse.</p><p>" Good moring Neville..and Umbridge happened. Yesterday."</p><p>The other boy didn’t need any other explanation. He simply nodded and gave Harry a half smile that clearly said – Im sorry you had to deal with her- while opening his case to hand Harry four envelopes of the same color. He gave Harry a timid smile before waving goodbye and turning to leave.</p><p>Harry waved back and got in to inspect the letters he was just given without any prying eyes around.</p><p>Three of the envelopes were adressed to his uncle, aunt and cousin so he thought it’d be wiser to not open them. However the forth one was clearly adressed to him. A yellowish envelope, with green ink writing on the outsise and the symbol of a large snake wrapped around a castle sealed the envelope shut.</p><p>The writing outsise said :</p><p>To Mr.Harry James Potter.</p><p>
  <em>To me? I never get any letters…</em>
</p><p>He quickly teared up the envelope , revealing the letter on the inside. The letter was written in elegant curvy letters with rich green ink. Harry had to double check the letter .</p><p>
  <em>An invitation?</em>
</p><p> <em>To Mr. Harry James Potter ,</em></p><p>
  <em> in the attic of the Privet Manor  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>         Mr. Potter you are cordially invited to</em>
</p><p>
  <em>   Prince’s Tom Marvolo Riddle’s eighteenth birthday.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>                 <strong>      A Masquerade Ball</strong></em>
</p><p>
  <em>   From the 26th of December till 1st of January </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The ball shall be held from 8:00pm till 1:00am for 7 nights at the Grand Ballroom of Riddle castle.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>  Sincerely  hope to see you there .</em>
</p><p>
  <em>    Best regards, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>                                                  Head of the Royal  Council,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>                      Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry folded the letter and slowly  feeling lightheaded from the information.</p><p>He had just been invited to his first ball.</p><p>A ball held by the king himself no less. This was almost too good to be true.</p><p>" Why are you looking more stupid than usual? Did you finally lose it?"</p><p>Of course it was too good to be true. Dudley was coming down the stairs of the foyer , heading straight for Harry.</p><p>"What are you holding there freak?"</p><p>
  <em>Oh no.</em>
</p><p>" That’s none of your bussiness! It is mine." Harry went to quickly hide the letter inside his pocket , but Dudley had already grabbed his wrist , violently removing the invitation from his grip. His pig faced cousin , spent a few minutes reading and re-reading the letter , his eyes getting wider as he read more.</p><p>" AN INVITATION TO THE PRINCE’S BIRTHDAY??" Dudley finally exclaimed , his face a mask of confusion .</p><p>" Good job Diddy , you finally learned how to read letters, Im really proud of you."  Harry spat and made an attempt to take the envelope back but Dudley held it out of his reach.</p><p>"Why …why would anyone invite you..especially the Prince.."</p><p>" Guess I’m special like that." Harry made another effort to grab the letter only to be pushed aside by Dudley’s massive hand.</p><p>" Ma! Harry got a letter! Ma!" Harry trully felt like shoving the other three envelopes down Dudleys throat .</p><p>Aunt Petunia who was at the library ,started walking down the stairs at lighting speed. Hearing the distressed sounds of Dudley made her reach the two of them in no time. She shot Harry a harsh glare before turning motherly to her son.</p><p>"What’s wrong honeyface, what is that you’re holding ?" Her voice was way too sweet for a mother talking to a 18 year old kid , but what did Harry know , he never had a mother to show him affection.</p><p>" Harry got an invitation to a ball ,tell him he can’t go!"</p><p>Petunia’s motherly face dropped , replaced by a face of true shock.She motioned to Dudley to hand her the letter with trembling hands.</p><p>Harry really couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the gaudiness of his aunts actions. It was just a letter.</p><p>His aunt read the letter quickly, closed her eyes and took a big breath. After a moment she snapped them open and looked at Harry with eyes that didn’t betray any particular emotion.</p><p>"Call Vernon downstairs."</p><p>         </p><p>                                                                   <strong>                             ****</strong></p><p>" There is no way he is going!"</p><p>Harry didn’t expect to hear anything else. In fact if he did , he would have been scared for his uncle’s mental health.</p><p>The Dursley family along with Harry were now located to the living room of the manor. Aunt Petunia was sitting in a chair next to a small bookcase , clutching her head between her hands. Dudley was sitting on the floor sending dirty looks at Harry every now and then and his uncle was sat besides the fireplace.</p><p>" Why not? I won’t cause you any trouble." He was pretty desperate to get them to let him go. This was his only chance at freedoom even it were for 7 nights.</p><p>" Why not??" His uncle’s face was starting to match the red shade of the burning flames in the fireplace. "You can’t possibly believe we’ll take you out with us when you look like this boy."  Vernom said and to " this" pointed to all of Harry.</p><p>"I can go alone! After you, no one will know that I’m with you. Or have anything to do with you."</p><p>"Absolutely not. Lots of people who know you.." Vernon gave him a calculated look before continuing " live with us will be there , they are definetely going to recognise you. I can’t take the shame."</p><p>The shame he says..as if I want to be related to awful people like you.</p><p>" But it’s a masquerade ball! No one will be able to te-"</p><p>"He can go."  </p><p>Three pairs of widened eyes turned to look at Petunia, who had lifted her head from her hands , now looking blankly once at the fireplace and once ay Harry.</p><p>" But mom! Harry is going to ruin everything like the freak he is, you know that!" Dudley lifted himself from the floor walking towards his mother.</p><p>" No Dudley , this boy got an invitation he must go...we...we can’t disobey Lord Riddle."  Aunt Petunia’s face was now paler than usual. Dudley’s face betrayed that he was 10 seconds away from a tantrum.</p><p>Harry on the flip side felt like he was on top of a cloud and had the desire to go and hug his aunt. A smile spread across his face as he bowed to her and went to get out and head to the kitchen.</p><p>" Under the condition-"  he stopped in his tracks.</p><p>" That you find to wear somethimg to match the elegance of this  important event." she added, a stern look on her face.</p><p>And with that Harry was out of the door, too happy to worry about such minor details as what to wear to the ball.</p><p> For once he was going to live a fairytale.</p>
