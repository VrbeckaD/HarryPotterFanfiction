    <p>“So where is the platform?” Asked a tall man with brown hair standing with his wife and eleven year old son, staring at a brick wall in the middle of a very busy Kings Cross station.<br/>
“You’ll see,” answered his wife, a short beautiful woman adorned with flowing midnight blue robes and a mischievous smile. She looked quite out of place in the midst of the bustling station.<br/>
“I’ll go through the barrier with Ben first, and then I’ll come back for you.”<br/>
The young Ben glanced nervously at his mother who placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder.<br/>
“It’s best to run if your nervous.”<br/>
He didn’t move.<br/>
“I’ll be with you the entire time.”<br/>
Ben tightened his grip on the trolley and gave a small nod. Together, mother and son ran straight at the wall. The tall man moved to warn them that they were about to crash, but before he could utter a word they disappeared into the wall.<br/>
“Leia! Ben!” He shouted, running at the wall and kicking it. Except, his foot went into the wall and his body involuntarily followed.<br/>
The man emerged onto another platform that he took to be platform nine and three-quarters, thanks to a handy sign. Steam was pouring out of a scarlet steam engine and flooding the platform.<br/>
“Hogwarts Express: departing in ten minutes.” A pleasant voice rang through the crowd.<br/>
“The Hogwarts Express huh? Polluting the atmosphere since who knows when.” He said.<br/>
His wife suddenly came up behind him, closely followed by his son.<br/>
“Says the pilot.” His wife said. “Aren’t you the least bit impressed?”<br/>
“You wizards never cease to amaze me, but I’m amazed so often you can hardly tell wether I am or not.” Han said.<br/>
Leia seemed not to notice, as she was distracted by a hand grabbing hers.<br/>
“What is it Ben?” She asked gently.<br/>
The boys eyes were wide and his palm sweaty. Leia immediately understood and pulled him into a hug.<br/>
“Why are they staring at us?” He asked in a small voice.<br/>
“They’re staring at me.” Reassured his mother. “Because I’m the Minister for Magic.”<br/>
There was a brief pause, then Ben spoke again:<br/>
“I’m nervous.” He whispered.<br/>
“You’ll be fine. Remember, I’ll write as often as I can and you can write to me if you’re troubled, you know that.” She said, releasing him. “You should get on the train, it’ll leave soon.”<br/>
Han ruffled Ben’s hair. “See ya round kid.”<br/>
“Bye.” Ben called, turning away from his parents. He swallowed, but that didn’t stop a single tear falling down his cheek, and bowing his head he wiped it away. He struggled with his heavy luggage and hurried onto the train.</p><p>Ben wandered through the corridor in search of an empty compartment, finding one at the very end of the train. He then let his handsome black eagle owl out of his cage and set him on the seat beside him. There was only one other student in the compartment; a girl with blond hair pulled into two tight buns on top of her head. Ben thought she had a slight resemblance to his mother. She was reading something, a magazine. On closer inspection he recognised it as The Quibbler.<br/>
“You’re not one of those Lovegoods are you?” He asked.<br/>
“No.” She replied bluntly, not taking her eyes of the page she was reading. “I’m Kaydel.”<br/>
“Kaydel. Hello Kaydel, I’m Ben.” He said politely.<br/>
She looked up. “Ben, but Ben what? You didn’t tell me your last name.” She stated.<br/>
“Neither did you.” He countered.<br/>
“That’s fair.” She said, shrugging and going back to reading.<br/>
He continued to stare at her, or more, The Quibbler. Kaydel looked up again.<br/>
“I can feel you staring at me.” She said.<br/>
“I’m sorry, it’s just, isn’t The Quibbler a bit...” he trailed off.<br/>
“Odd?” She finished.<br/>
He didn’t say anything, not wanting to offend her.<br/>
“I just read it for a laugh, you know?” She finished.<br/>
Ben didn’t know, but he nodded anyway. She looked at his owl and bit her lip.<br/>
“You shouldn’t really have you’re owl out in the train.” She said, and then became absorbed in the next page of her magazine.<br/>
He tuned to his owl. “Sorry Fukurō, but you’ll have to spend the rest of the trip in your cage.”<br/>
The owl nipped his finger, shuffled into his cage, and turned his head away from Ben, who closed the door.<br/>
“Sorry.” He said again.<br/>
The owl remained with it’s back to him. He shrugged, pulled out one of his school books, and started to read.</p><p>Ben was tall and lanky; almost the same height as his mother. He had a long face, large ears, and a long nose. His hair, dark and wild. His eyes were an earthy brown, almost hazel, and his brows were furrowed in concentration as he read. Ben was a half-blood; his father, Han (a muggle), was a used-to-be smuggler turned wizarding hero turned pilot. His mother, Leia, was the Minister for Magic. She was born to the pure-blooded Skywalker line, a line which never failed to produce famous wizards. Leia had helped her twin brother Luke defeat Lord Vader, a wizard of the dark arts, saving the wizarding world from his tyranny. Luke went on to teach potions at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br/>
Ben had just started his second book when the lamps flickered into life. Kaydel, it seems, had noticed this too.<br/>
“We’re close.” She said, closing her book (she had finished the Quibbler a while back and moved onto something else titled ‘Pride and Prejudice’). “We should get changed.”<br/>
“You mean get changed as in get changed into our uniform?” He asked.<br/>
Kaydel nodded.<br/>
His eyes widened. “Here? Now?”<br/>
“We’ll take turns of course!” She laughed.<br/>
Ben breathed a sigh of relief.<br/>
“You go first, I don’t mind waiting.” Kaydel said, making her way out of the compartment. “You might wanna close the curtains.” She added.<br/>
“Right.” He said, even though Kaydel had already closed the door.<br/>
He got changed hastily and so did Kaydel. They still had a bit of time left before the train arrived but not enough to start reading again so they sat in silence until Kaydel spoke:<br/>
“You’re a first year, aren’t you?” She asked.<br/>
Ben nodded.<br/>
“Huh.”<br/>
The conversation died as soon as it had begun and they both went back to sitting silently. They could feel the slowing down and both swayed in their seats as it halted. Ben grabbed his luggage and joined the throng of students slowly but surely making their way onto hogsmeade station.</p><p>He was soon out on the platform.<br/>
“First years! First years over here! First years with me!” Called the gruff, and sometimes very hard to understand, voice of Chewbacca, a family friend; and the caretaker, keeper of keys and grounds, and care of magical creatures Professor at Hogwarts. He was encouraged by Han to call him uncle Chewie (he never did).<br/>
Ben made his way through the crowd towards his voice.<br/>
“Ben!” Exclaimed Chewbacca when Ben joined him at his side. “How are you?”<br/>
“I’m fine thanks.” Ben replied, staring at his feet.<br/>
“So, first year huh.” Chewbacca said, slapping Bens back.<br/>
Ben winced. “Yep.”<br/>
Chewbacca was extremely tall. He had a mane of shaggy brown hair and a very long beard and—actually he was just extremely hairy. A few moments later he began calling across the crowd again.<br/>
“First years!”<br/>
Once he was double, triple sure that all the first years were grouped around him Chewbacca spoke:<br/>
“All of you, follow me.”<br/>
They did; followed him down a lantern lit path and after a few minutes he paused suddenly, causing a few of the students to bump into one another.<br/>
“You’ll see the castle very soon.” He said quietly.<br/>
“What?” Called a student at the back of the group.<br/>
“You’ll see the castle very soon.” Chewbacca repeated in an loudly irritated tone.<br/>
That was the thing with Chewbacca; he was really quite touchy.<br/>
The first years followed him a bit further and ended up at the edge of a lake, Hogwarts castle standing majestically across from them. There waiting for them on the shore was a large number of wooden boats.<br/>
“Alright, four to a boat, chop chop.” Chewbacca said, again louder than necessary.<br/>
They all clambered uncertainly into the boats, just as Chewbacca had instructed them. Ben found himself sitting next to Chewie and two other students. One of them, a boy, had curly black hair and a handsome face, with dark brown eyes and thick brows. He was talking animatedly to the other student; a girl. She had a pretty round face and her blond hair was pulled back into a low bun-ish hairstyle. Ben stared into the depths of the lake for something to do and thought he saw something move.
“Chew—Professor?” He asked.<br/>
Chewbacca scoffed. “Professor? Just call me Chewie.”<br/>
“Sorry Chewie.”<br/>
“You had a question?”<br/>
“I think I saw something moving.” Ben said. “In the lake.”<br/>
“And what did it look like?” Chewbacca asked.<br/>
“It was... big.” Ben replied.<br/>
“Ah yes.” Said Chewbacca thoughtfully. “That’ll be the giant squid.”<br/>
“Did... did you just say giant squid?” The curly haired boy asked excitedly.<br/>
“Yes I did.” Answered Chewbacca, and then he went into a lengthy explanation of the creatures living in the Black Lake. Ben pitied the boy, who was almost certainly pretending to listen out of the goodness of his heart. Ben looked back into the lake, his reflection stared at him from it’s glassy surface.</p><p>He searched the water for any signs of life without any luck and soon Hogwarts castle was looming over them, they were heading towards the great cliff on which it stood. The boats (no rowing needed because, y’know, magic) carried them through a curtain of ivy and along a dark tunnel into into some kind of underground harbour. They were greeted with an unpleasant smell. They exited the boats, climbed up a passageway, and came out finally onto damp grass. Chewbacca then lead them up a flight of stone steps to a great oak door and, after making sure all the first years were still with him, knocked on it three times. The door opened almost instantly and the students followed Chewbacca into the large Entrance Hall. A small witch hurried towards them.<br/>
“Thank you, I’ll take them from here.” She said.<br/>
Her voice was sharp and strong, she was wearing baggy burgundy pants, a blue shirt and grey vest. Her hair, if she even had any, was covered with a grey fabric hat. She had a wizened face and eyes that were magnified by a pair of strange goggles. She addressed them:<br/>
“Follow me.”<br/>
She was quite fast for someone so small and they soon cane to a halt inside a small chamber. Ben could hear hundreds of voices through the wall.<br/>
“My name is Professor Kanata, the head of Ravenclaw house.” Said the small witch. “The start-of-term feast will begin soon, but before that starts, something important happens. You will be sorted. This is important because while you are at Hogwarts your house is almost a family. You sleep in your house dormitory, spend time in your common room, and take classes with your house and year. The four houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. You do good things, you earn house points. You do bad things, the opposite happens. Easy enough to follow. The house with the most points at the end of the year will win the house cup. The sorting will happen shortly in front of the school. I’ll come back soon.” And she left the room.</p>
