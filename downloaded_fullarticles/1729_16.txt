    <p>Summary- All her life Harry, short for Harriette, had always been one of the boys and nothing was really going to stop that. Not even a Zombie apocalypse.

    <u>Chapter one</u>
  </strong>
</p><p>Harry, call me by my full name and die, Potter was currently finding herself rather confused and bewildered in a, is this really happening sort of way. Not because of the Zombie apocalypse that was currently going on, no that had left her horrified when she had first found out just what was going on. And then reluctantly accepted in in, yeah this is just my kind of luck, kind of way.</p><p>Something which happened after she had seen one of her neighbors, that she really didn't like because she keep trying to get Harry to act more feminine and continued to call her by her full name despite Harry's protest against it, get torn apart by another Zombie. Something she would never wish on the elder lady no matter how much she got annoyed at her at times; as despite the fact she had continued to try to change Harry it had been in a malicious sort of way.</p><p> That day, had ended up, reminding Harry horrible of the war. And it was causing memories she had been trying to suppress, of the werewolves on Voldemort’s side ripping people part, to start once more; causing her to wake up from nightmares again.</p><p>Which since the whole world seem to turn into a living nightmare it really wasn't something that wasn't expected. In fact, on those night’s she had woken up barely stopping herself from screaming from the memories she had, Harry could say she should have almost expected something like this to happen; as it had gotten too peaceful for her lately.</p><p>Still what got the now almost twenty-year-old witch feeling that way she was. Was the fact, that despite the fact the dead were raising up all around them and trying to eat them, the group she had found herself with, and the group she was still debating if she was going to stay with, still had its share of unneeded drama over pretty much everything.</p><p>Even the most utterly useless things to have drama over, things that considering just what was going on now really shouldn’t even matter now. Hell, they really hadn’t mattered all that much before the world had gone to hell. So, Harry couldn’t see why this group made them matter so much now.</p><p>Perhaps Harry, was being overly harsh on the group in question. After all, before all of this happened, she was sure that nearly everyone in the group had led a relatively normal life. Never really having to fight for anything, let along to be able to survive.</p><p>Unlike her, she was sure they hadn't just recently finished a blood war, that they had been front and center in, nor did she think that then dealt with all the after math of said war. And unlike her, they still weren't used to fighting with everything they had, nor where they used to a kill or be killed world like she had been forced to be…well at least most of them weren't. Harry was sure the two hunters of the group, a Daryl and Merle were pretty used to it being a kill or be killed world, and knew how to survive, but she wasn't so sure about the others.</p><p>And honestly, to her at least, this really showed with how they reacted to, well nearly everything that was going on now. Not that Harry was going to say anything or make a point to tell them this. She knew that that would only cause more drama as they argued again on what she said, and not only that but she really didn't know this group much.</p><p>Having had literally only stumbled onto them a couple of days ago. Or to be more precise she had walked in the clearing they had made camp in, wondering why such a large group was doing out in the open like they were. Especially since it was open on all sides, and if they had gone a little further down, or closer to the lake they would have had at least a little more cover than they currently did.</p><p>But since she had wondered into this group what Harry had spent a good deal of time doing, when she wasn't hunting, watching for walkers, or making sure all her weapons and supplies were in good condition, was watching them. Seeing how they reacted to everything, learning what she could about them from said reaction. Observing all of them to see just what made them tick. Similar to how she did all her live at her so-called family home and only improved upon during the war. Something that had saved both her life and the lives of those she had cared about several times before.</p><p>What she was trying to do, was see if she should stick around here or not. She wanted to see if these were people she actually wanted to risk her life, or sanity for. At the same time, she knew it wasn't like she had anything to lose or gain from staying. Not in the long run, and not when you considered the fact she didn’t really know anyone in the group she was currently part of.</p><p>Seeing as everyone else she cared about had already been slowly killed off by the war that had just ended and those that lived, well they weren't talking to her and she couldn't find it in her to actually give a shit about them; not after everything they tried to pull. Even with everything that was currently go on she still could bring herself to even care about what they could be doing. Like she told them before she left, they could all eat shit and die for all she cared.</p><p>As of right now, the only reason she had been staying was because when she had first arrived the very first things she saw was the kids they had. And despite how hard she acted at time, Harry always had a soft spot for kids. But only the kids, and as of right now the rest of the adult, bare a small few, were starting to get on her nerves with just how much drama they continued to pull.</p><p>Like right now Lori, one of the women from the group. Who reminded Harry somewhat nastily of her not so dear Aunt, was going on about how the women around the camp would clean up and do the laundry for the men; the lady chores she called them.</p><p>This almost made Harry want to scream a bit at her, to get more with the times and to possibly get her grow up; to see woman could do just as much as a man. Could be just as bad for that matters as well; just as evil as any man could get.</p><p> But stopped herself from doing so because of two different things. One, it really wasn't any of her business and if the other women in the group disagreed with Lori then they would have to stand up for themselves and say so. As you wouldn’t get far in the world as it was now without being able to stand up for yourself in some way or another.</p><p>And two, Lori, like the rest of the camp, seemed to under the mistaken impression that Harry was completely and utterly male. So, Harry didn’t have to deal with anything that Lori was trying to put the others though; otherwise Harry would have told Lori just where she could shove those ideals of hers. Just like Harry had told her aunt where to shove hers; no matter the punishments she had received because of that.</p><p>When it came to how the camp saw her, Harry knew they thought this way, found it amusing as hell for that matter, and because of this did absolutely nothing to discourage them from thinking otherwise.</p><p>As it was not only way to avoid the utter bullshit that Lori put out but at the same time, it was almost a source of amusement for her during these dark times. Besides it wasn't like it was all that insulting to her to be mistaken as a male either, seeing as Harry had always been what most would call one of the boys.</p><p>Though she did think that Daryl and his brother were starting to catch onto the fact that Harry might not be as male as the rest of the group claimed she was. But since the two usually spent most of the time hunting and away from the others in the camp Harry didn't think it matter much.</p><p>Even if it was those two, she spent the most time with. Plus, rather she was male or female it didn't matter she knew how to fight, she knew hunt, she knew how to heal, and most importantly she knew how to survive; both with her magic and without. Compared that that Gender didn't matter in the least bit and for those who thought it did she would personally show them, in the most painful fashion she could thing of, just why it didn't.</p><p>Rolling her eyes at how Lori was acting, Harry turned to the person standing behind the women acting similar to a loyal dog to her. His name was Shane and he was another person in the group that Harry really didn't' like in the least bit.</p><p>Though this was mainly because the moment Harry had first stumbled on this group, the so-called policeman, and leader of the group, started to demand all the weapons, and other supplies she had on her if she wanted to join their group. Yeah, that hadn’t work in the least bit.</p><p>As Harry wasn’t and never really had been someone who could be intimidated into listening to anyone; if she her life would have been a lot different than it was. Hell, if it was she’d still be in the wizarding world most likely married off to someone she couldn’t stand and being used as a broodmare of sorts.</p><p>Instead Harry simple raised an eyebrow at the man, before she quickly knocked the gun out of his hands and flipping said man over her shoulder; before anyone else in the group realized just what she was doing. Then after putting her booted foot on the man's back told him in lament terms, she wasn't going to hand over HER weapons or HER supplies and if he tried to take them, she would kill him.</p><p>Though his attitude after, and the actions he did with the rest of the group certainly didn't endear Shane to her any more than he already was. If anything, they marked him permanently in her mind as Lori’s little attack dog; a near rabid one at that.</p><p>Harry never said she'd be part of their group, but for some reason after she took down Shane like she had, the youngest little girl of the group, who was called Sophia, seemed to utterly adore her and stuck like a shadow to her.</p><p>Something Harry knew that her father loathed and tried to correct several times before stopping when Harry nearly broke his hand when he tried in front of her. And if she, maybe gave several different threats and placed the man in question under a powerful nightmare curse, well no one else needed to know about that either.</p><p>But still, what Sophia was doing did have the effect of causing Harry to want to stay and help this group; for a little bit longer. At least until she finally decided if this group was the one, she wanted to join; in a more permanent manor.  </p><p>Harry did this, by both by helping the Dixons hunt from time to time. Helping with the protection by going taking the night watch no one wanted to keep an eye out for any Walkers. Not to mention letting it be known that she knew how to patch people up and was what the people in the army called a field medic.</p><p> Then added to that she had also taken to going on runs with Glenn; who was someone Harry was actually really starting to get along with. Meant that altogether she was doing a lot more than anyone else in the camp when it came to helping the group as a whole; certainly more that the so-called Leader of the group Shane.</p><p>Not that the majority of this group seemed to even notice what she was doing; let along thank her Something she noticed seemed to be a rather common thing as they never thanked either of the Dixon brothers; despite the fact those two never came back without some sort of food for the group the share between them.</p><p>Thinking on this, and as she continued in on her observations, Harry noticed that she was starting to get an unwanted headache. More so then ever as she continued to watch the drama in the camp. Feeling this Harry decided that her time would be better spent doing something else. Something that wouldn’t want to have her banging her head on the nearest hard surface while screaming why?!</p><p> Like checking her packs, her clothes and her weapons in case she needed to go on another run, or worse if there was a walker attack of some sort. Hell, even combing through the area checking if there were any walkers nearby would be better than what she was currently doing; watching paint dry would be as well.</p><p> That in mind Harry began to do just that starting with her weapons and moving on from there. After all, at the moment those weapons could be the things that choice between life and death for her.  And she wanted to make sure that at the worst sort of circumstances the weapons in question didn’t fail or break on her in some way.</p><p>That in mind Harry began the time-consuming work of checking over, sharping and discreetly spelling all her weapon supply. Making it all so that it was in the best condition that the weapons in being could be. Something that Harry knew would take her quite a while.</p><p> Mainly because she had raided both the Potter and Black weapons supply and had them all of them with her when she left the wizarding world in the first place. Which meant that she had quite a bit of weapons to go over.</p><p>Unfortunately, and fortunately, not every single weapon she had, was currently directly on her person in such a way that she could check them over like she had been.  Or it would have taken a lot longer then what it did to make sure her weapons where all in tiptop order, not to mention it would have raised a lot more question then she wanted to answer with the sheer number of weapons she would need to have done.</p><p>As it was, she already had more weapon on her now, and that was those that were visible to the others, than most people carried around even at the worst of time. What with the good twenty throwing daggers she had strapped in various place of her body; each with a charm that would discreetly summon it back to her once she got a certain distance away from them.</p><p>The Katana she had attached to her back, that should could easily grab an us by just reaching over her back. The four Sais she had, two on each side her waist, and in each one of her boots. All of which Harry had trained with and knew how to get and have ready to be used in a single movement.</p><p>Not to mention she also had six different guns she had one her, four strapped nearby her two Sais on her waist and the remaining two at chest level; where she could easily reach and grab. Then there was her favorite weapon, and the one she had with her since she was fourteen and Sirius had first taken her to the black vaults, the chained scythe on her hip.</p><p>And those where just the weapons she had on her body. Harry had a lot more of them hidden away from everyone else with all the other supplies she had. Making what she currently had on seem like nearly nothing in terms of protection. Even if those had been the weapons she knew how to use the most and were the weapons she used to wear all the time during the war. Having recently taken up wearing all of them again; whereas before she had been slowly weaning herself off of them.</p><p>Her friends, back when they had been alive, had always said she had an unhealthy obsession with sharp and point objects. Especially when the saw just how much she practiced or used said her chained Scythe. But she had always been just as quick to reply with a, what was so unhealthy about it when it's what kept her alive.</p><p>Something she had felt was true now more so then ever before. Even if it had taken her a bit how to perfect the use of her chained scythe against the walkers. But she had been able to quickly learn to pierce the skull with her blades and could now use both ends of her chained scythe help cover her from all angles. Similar to how she had done it during the war; just in a much more lethal fashion; as she hadn’t always had to aim to kill back then.</p><p>The sound of bush rustling nearby, knocked Harry's attention from what she had been doing, and away from her thoughts, as it alert her to the fact someone, or maybe something, was coming. Then before the others could react Harry had a pair of her throwing daggers up and ready to launch in an attack. However, before she could actually throw these daggers a very familiar, and rather hated by the rest of the camp, voice spoke up; freezing Harry's hands as it did so.</p><p>"Now none that, pretty boy, unless you don't want the food me and my brother found. It's fine with me, if that’s the case. There’d be more for me and my brother that way anyway."</p><p>Now that was extremely polite for Merle, didn't have a single real insult or slur in it; like Merle usually spoke. But with the looks the rest of the group sent the hunter it was like he had just cursed them all out or something similar to it. Causing Harry to roll her eyes and move to help both Merle and Daryl get everything ready; after all the animals weren't going to skin themselves now where they.</p><p> As she did this Harry couldn’t help but add another mental tally to just why several members of this group most likely wouldn't survive that long in the world as it was. Mainly because if they keep the attitude, they had now they were going to start to lose the things or the people that would help them survive in the long run.</p><p>Because as far as Harry could see, a lot of the people in this group now were just way to sensitive and took things to literally. Not to mention, the thing that had been bugging her all along, not one of them even attempted to see past either Merle or Daryl's offence mask and only took things at face value.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that not a single member of the group ever thanked either brother for going out hunting and making it so they didn't have to go hungry. Nor did the majority of them even offer to help when it came to actually preparing the food, so that it could be cooked.</p><p>Something while not that big of a deal, considering they didn’t know how to do it correct, still did bug Harry. You would think that given how things where they would want to know if they ever got separated from the group or something like that. Harry knew if she had been in their shoes, and didn’t know what she did, she would be trying to learn everything she could when it came to her own survival. Be it hunting, fighting, or preparing meat, or even setting traps to help catch said meat.</p><p>But it wasn’t like that in this group, it was if no matter what happened they were expecting either her or the Dixons to do it all the things that needed to be done to get the animal prepped for cooking. Just like they expected them to handle all the hunting as well.  Not to mention how the expect Glenn to always be willing to go on a supply run; even if he had only just gotten back from his previous one.</p><p>Knowing this Harry wasn’t impressed in the least bit, and felt that so far, the group in question it really seemed to be one she really didn’t want to stay in. Not, if she actually had plans, on you know, surviving through this whole thing. After all, if they couldn't accept the Dixon's, no matter how offence Merle could be, then why would they accept the fact she was a witch, an extremely powerful one at that?</p><p> </p>
