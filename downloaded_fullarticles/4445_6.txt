Anyway, it was just supposed to be fun. And Luna Lovegood was having some fun right now. </p><p>"Hey Ginny!" Luna called to the freckled girl who was walking by. "Do you want me to do a tarot card reading for you?"</p><p>Ginny grinned. "Sure!"</p><p>She then laid some of the cards down in front of her with one of her own smiles. "Alright." She started.
