    <p>A small, skinny figure looked out at the bustling crowd surrounding the imposing locomotive stationed at Nine and Three Quarters, and shivered. He’d just done the seemingly impossible by running headfirst into a wall, only to pass through it and make an appearance in an entirely different place. He silently reminded himself to thank Mrs. Weasley profusely for calming him down as her sons disappeared into thin air through what he thought was solid brick.</p><p>	Eleven-year-old Harry Potter adjusted his cracked glasses and squinted into the fray, searching hopefully for a flash or two of striking auburn hair. The twins, whom not even their mother could tell apart, had to be around here somewhere. As he sidled to his left by pushing his luggage a little farther onto the platform, he heard a few cracks, like loud pops, behind him, and turned to grin at the youngest boy Weasley. </p><p>He’d never had a friend before, due to being shut away in a cupboard most of his life, but the way Ron’s cheeky smile scrunched his freckles into the creases of his eyes was comforting and made him feel a little mischievous. Perhaps he might make a friend or two after all.</p><p>	Ron was quickly followed by his mother and her only daughter, Ginny, who was still whining about not being able to leave for Hogwarts with her siblings and clutching to her mother’s skirts. When she caught Harry watching her amusedly, she silenced and hid behind her flaming locks, but didn’t seem too offended. He was glad, he’d not meant to stare and wouldn’t like to ruin a potential bond by annoying Ron’s little sister. Harry smiled softly in apology and turned to Ron, who was busy attempting to dig his pygmy puff out of his pocket to offer it some treats. </p><p>The tiny, fluffy creature did not agree with this, most likely disturbed by the loud noises and constant jostling. Ron had shown Harry the miniature creature in his pocket before Harry had run through the station wall, and it was the cutest thing he’d ever seen. He turned to Hedwig, who seemed slightly ruffled from their magical escapades but otherwise alright, and whispered into her downy fluff that she was still his favorite creature. She looked at him sagely and turned to nibble his finger complacently. He supposed it was her way of saying she accepted his praise.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud, wailing hiss soared above the cacophony of families making goodbyes. Ron gave up on bribing his pygmy puff and bumped shoulders with Harry. “C’mon, mate! We’ve got to catch ourselves a compartment before they’re all taken. I’ll bet you there’s a few left in the back. Bye, mum! Bye Ginny!” Ron hugged his mother and sister, then tugged Harry’s arm. “Hurry! We’ll be too late!” </p><p>Harry collected his luggage, awkwardly thanked Mrs. Weasley, and sped up behind Ron. They loaded their luggage into a luckily empty apartment and settled in. It was all so new and different, he wanted to take every sound, every sight, every smell, and put them away forever, so he could experience the mix of excitement and humming nervousness over and over again. He also had no idea that he actually could.</p><p>	Another whistle sounded shrilly, and parents kissed their children one last time as the train huffed and puffed to life, chugging slowly out of the station. Harry squirmed in his seat to get a good look as the platform slid out of sight. Once he couldn’t see it anymore, he plopped back down and ruffled his hair, hoping to tame it even a little, and failing spectacularly. What he did accomplish, however, was making Ron’s blue eyes go round as moons and big as saucers.</p><p>	“What?” Harry asked, shifting uncomfortably. He wasn’t used to much scrutiny from anyone other than the Dursleys, or the occasional bully. Ron continued to stare, as if in awe.</p><p>	“You’re…. Harry, Harry Potter.” He rasped. Harry was confused beyond confusion.</p><p>	“Um, yeah. I am. That is my name.” He shrugged, and his robes shifted on his extremely scrawny shoulders. Ron blinked as if in headlights. Harry folded in on himself a little. Had he done something wrong?</p><p>	Luckily, the compartment door slid open just as Ron opened his mouth again, and there stood in the doorway a tall, lithe figure enrobed in forest green. The boy looked no older than the two sitting across from each other, but had a more mature air than most preteens. His ebony, wavy hair touched just below his chin, and his black eyes sparkled with something akin to curiosity, a need to understand the world and how it worked. He glanced at both of them, and when his eyes met Harry’s, he felt as if the sudden intruder might like to take him apart to see how he worked. But there was no maliciousness in the gaze, just intrigue.</p><p>	“The name’s Prince, Severus Prince. They’re not going to call me that when they sort me, though. All of the other carriages are taken. Would you mind if I joined you? Everyone else said they’d rather not.” The boy, Severus, pouted. He looked down at them expectantly. Harry was very welcome of the distraction, himself, and he found that he liked the mysterious sort of air around Severus. Perhaps another friend to be made, he thought to himself, and smiled widely up at his new carriage mate. </p><p>Patting the seat next to him, Harry nodded. “I don’t see why not, it doesn’t bother me.” Ron snapped out of his reverie at that point and shook himself. He looked up at Severus and shrugged.</p><p>“Have at it, I guess. Always good to meet more people. And I don’t mind either.” Ron smiled warmly up at Severus, who looked surprised and happy at his eager welcoming into the compartment.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said, a bit shy now. “No one wanted to sit with me because I’m a half-blood. And my pet. Do either of you dislike snakes?” He asked sheepishly. Both of them shook their heads.</p><p>“So long as it doesn’t try to eat my pygmy puff, I’m alright with snakes. Charlie’s always kept them, despite being a Gryffindor. It does explain why he works with dragons now, they’re kind of like really big snakes. He’s sent me tons of pictures, it’s really cool. And I’ve fed his snakes before. They’re pretty laid back, for all the hate they get. Never bitten me once,” Ron looked almost smug.</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry chimed in. “And they’re nice to talk to. I accidentally let a really big one out at the zoo, but it didn’t hurt me or anything. Thanked me, actually. Said it’d never seen Burma before.” He cleared his throat. “What kind is yours?”</p><p>There was immediate silence. Intense, uncomfortable silence. Now it was Ron and Severus looking at him like he’d grown ears of corn out of his face. It was a few painful minutes before anyone spoke, much less moved. Severus leaped forward and croaked,</p><p>“You can talk to snakes?! Like, talk to them? Conversations? In Parseltongue? What do they sound like?” Harry remained frozen. Ron did not. Instead, he turned white as a sheet and coughed as if choking. Before Harry could get so much as a word out of his constricting throat, the doors slid open again to reveal a short, bushy-haired girl in a pastel pink sweater vest and white jumper underneath. She raked her big, chocolatey brown eyes over them one by one. Her gaze finally settled with a critical intake on Harry’s forehead.</p><p>“Harry Potter,” the young witch surmised. “I wasn’t expecting to make your acquaintance so soon. I’m Hermione Granger.” She held out a small, firm hand. Despite the warm glow of her skin, she looked delicate as porcelain, and Harry stuttered before gingerly taking her hand in a gentle shake. “And who are you?” She asked of Severus, kneeling on the floor in front of Harry as if proposing, and Ron, slumped in his seat looking incredibly confused and overwhelmed.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>	“So, what you’re saying is that Harry Potter, The Chosen One, The Golden Boy, The Boy Who Lived, is a Parseltongue and you can’t wrap your head around it?” Hermione questioned Ron, and gave him a quizzical stare from where she sat primly on his left. “I’ve no trouble with it. The prophecy never said he couldn’t be in Slytherin,” her voice was calm and she nodded at Harry. “Slytherins aren’t inherently evil, you know. It’s a foolish misconception.” This time she shot Ron a judging glare.</p><p>Ron shrank into his coat a little. “I’ve nothing against it, really,” he pleaded. “It’s just that I never expected any of this. It was dreamlike, the idea of Harry Potter, the wizarding world’s savior. Now that I know he’s real…. It’s strange. But good luck in Slytherin, mate, I hope we can continue to be friends,” he said hopefully in Harry’s direction. “You too, Severus, I hope there’s no hard feelings,” Ron added.</p><p>	“It’s alright, I suppose.” Severus had taken a seat next to Harry after realizing how embarrassing it was to Harry with him kneeling almost between his legs. Severus crossed his own long legs at the knees and gave Ron a small smile. He really seems older than a first year, Harry couldn’t help but think. At the moment, he really couldn’t bother to wonder why Severus seemed so mature for his age, with the exception of the snake-lovers earlier outburst. He was entirely caught up in whatever the hell was going on.</p><p>	“Stop, everyone. How do you know my name? Who is ‘The Chosen One’? Or any of those other names? And do you not hear snakes? Is that weird? Am I weird?” He was so confused, and everything they had said was fuzzy. His carriage mates had the good grace to look surprised.</p><p>	“Harry, how could you not know?” Hermione sounded genuinely shocked. And disturbed. “It’s only what everyone’s talking about, everywhere, all the time. Where have you been, under a rock?” Harry stiffened.</p><p>	“A cupboard under my aunt and uncle’s stairs, actually. It’s where I sleep, and where they lock me away if they don’t feel like dealing with me. My cousin Dudley and his gang rough me up for hanging out at the local park. I haven’t exactly been able to stroll around downtown if you know what I mean.” Harry shrugged. </p><p>“And they were so against me being accepted into Hogwarts they rented a lighthouse in the middle of nowhere. Took all my letters. Hagrid had to break down the door and take me away from them. They’re not very accepting of magic. Hated my parents, and hated me, because when my mum and dad died in a car crash, they got saddled with me. So I stayed out of their way when I wasn’t doing their chores. That’s about it, really. Not an exciting life.” He sniffed dryly. </p><p>The news was old to him now, the mental scars numbed. It still hurt, and the abuse was still scary, but he’d understood from a young age that this was his deal in life, so he had to make the best of it. When he finally looked up from staring at his twiddling thumbs, he knew he’d said far too much.</p><p>“Harry…. do they even feed you?” Severus spoke in a whisper. His hand reached out and grasped Harry’s wrist firmly. His hand, despite having long, slim fingers, should not so easily close around the wrist of a fellow eleven-year-old, or so far. He was horrified. “They don’t,” he shakily concluded. </p><p>Not letting go of Harry’s wrist, Severus turned and slid open the compartment door, sticking his head out. He waved to someone Harry couldn’t see, but when an older woman pushing a trolley filled with colorful packaging trundled her way over, he realized his new friend had called for food. He looked down at the hand on his wrist and something tumbled around inside him, and he felt flushed.</p><p>“You don’t have to, you know, get me food. I’m fine. Me and Hagrid ate at the Leaky Cauldron before we went shopping for my supplies, so I’ve already eaten.” He squeaked out. Severus turned and looked at him with something dark in his eyes.</p><p>“And how long ago was that, Harry?” Hermione’s voice was strained as if she was forcing herself not to yell. But she remained calmer than Ron, who looked livid, with round red cheeks like cherries and furrowed brows. He opened his mouth to say something and Hermione stepped on his foot. He shut up.</p><p>“Two hours ago, maybe? Three?” He shrugged, embarrassed at the attention.</p><p>“Then you have room for some snacks, no?” The trolley woman looked impatient at being called over and not given an order. Harry met her eyes shyly.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.” He jiggled his hand in his pocket and took out some of the coins Hagrid had given him from his parent’s account. Some were smaller, and bronze, or silver, and some bigger and golden. Ron’s eyes popped out of his head. The trolley woman simply looked approvingly at Harry, for being called ma’am and being shown respect. She wished all the rowdy students she dealt with each year were as polite as this one.</p><p>“I’d suggest a chocolate frog,” Ron spoke up, and this time Hermione let him. “And Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans. There are cauldron cakes, too. Really filling. Not the Fizzing Whizzbees though. They never sit for long.” Severus caught on to what Ron was saying and helped Harry make his purchases. Because of the big order, and how polite and sorry Harry seemed, the trolley lady gave him an extra frog, free of charge.</p><p>“Tell me who you get in that one before you get off the train, honey.” She winked and went on her way. Harry’s expression was quizzical. </p><p>“Who I get? What’d she mean by that?” He asked. Severus chuckled and reached to unwrap the frog for him. He let Harry watch closely as he opened it.</p><p>“I’ve only had a few, as I’m not one for sweets, and they’ve always been seen as a special treat by my mother, but it’s fun to see what’s in them. The frogs are enchanted, so they move for a bit. I’ve had to chase my fair share of them around the room. And at the bottom, there’s a card, like a baseball card. It has a famous witch or wizard on it.</p><p>“See, you got Dumbledore. They’re the usual. I’ve seen some impressive collections, though. And I’ve got myself a Shacklebolt. Traded three McGonagalls for him. Oh look, he’s gone. He’ll be back, people in magic portraits do that all the time. You’ll get used to it.” Severus leaned closer to Harry as he talked. Although he’d let go of Harry when he’d helped him purchase his snacks with the correct amount of money, he could still feel how cold Harry’s skin had been. He wished he had a blanket to throw over the other boy's shoulders.</p><p>They’d just met not half an hour ago, but he already could see that The Boy Who Lived wasn’t anything like he’d thought. He wasn’t stuck up, rude, selfish, or narcissistic. In fact, it seemed to him those relatives of Harry had made it their lives work to make him think he was nothing, or even less than nothing. He wondered where the overwhelming need to protect this boy, not even younger than him, had come from. But he was so small, and frail, and frightfully skinny; he probably couldn’t walk around too much without tiring himself out. It wasn’t dinner time yet, and he already looked exhausted. </p><p>Severus wished suddenly, a hope not unfruitful, that this boy before him would too be placed into Slytherin, as he was sure of himself being placed there. Perhaps they’d even share a room, albeit with two other boys as well. Then he could look after him, and see change take place in that fragile body. He was surprised at this amount of care for someone still a stranger, although hopefully a new friend, but still unknown to him in terms of human connection. </p><p>But he was alright with this, he decided, watching Harry’s shimmering green eyes behind their fluttering lashes. He really was small. Severus could probably pick him up and lug him around with ease. He felt a shot of anger ring through him at the Muggles Harry lived with, hot and sharp. No matter if they were family, one simply didn’t treat someone that way-- let alone a child! He knew he was a child, the same age as Harry, but although he’d had his fair share of abuse and an unhappy home, he’d never been locked away and starved.</p><p>He vowed to do something, anything, even if all he could do was befriend this small, messy-haired boy beside him, and shove pumpkin stew down his throat at dinner. When Harry looked up at him gleefully, eyes shining and awkwardness forgotten, he knew he’d made the right choice.</p>
