    <p>The sun was shining as the train took off from the station at platform 9 and 3/4. As usual the train was buzzing with excited students, ready for the new year and it was no different for the Marauders, who found an empty compartment to sit in. Sirius and Remus on one side and James and Peter on the other side. Remus was already reading. He wasn't in a good mood since in a few days there would be a full moon and the other guys knew about that. James still tried to cheer him up with his silly plans for possible pranks. "Moony, what are you reading?" Peter then asked.</p><p>"Study material.." Remus said shortly. The year had just started and technically it hadn't started offficialy yet as they hadn't arrived just yet.</p><p>"Already? We haven't even arrived at Hogwarts..." James said a bit concerned about his friend but then again, this was pretty normal for Remus.</p><p>"I like to be prepared." Remus said even though he had been preparing all summer. Remus rarely relaxed, even at the time people were supposed to relax.</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes "Moony, you're always prepared. Take a break, at least for the ride." he said and leaned back in the seat. He was happy the four of them were together again and that he didn't need to see or hear anything from his family for a while.</p><p>"I know I'm always prepared but this year I'm not planning to fool around and give in to the many useless and silly pranks." Remus said. "But Moony...." James pouted. "No. Last year I almost failed potions because of it." Remus said.</p><p>"Almost failed? There wasn't a single mistake in any of your exams, Remus." James sighed now.</p><p>Sirius sighed and then chuckled "You're gonna crash at some point if you don't relax once in a while, mate." The lady walked passed their compartment with her trolley of sweets "Anything from the trolley, dears?" She asked.</p><p>"Everything on the trolley with chocolate." James said before winking to Sirius. He did it for Remus as he knew the boy loved chocolate and he certainly needed it now.</p><p>"I'd rather crash than fail." Remus said and he seemed to mean it.</p><p>Sirius gave a slight nod to James in return and smiled. He then turned back to Remus "If you crash then you will fail. Lighten up a bit, it's our last year and we need to enjoy it." he playfully ruffled Moony's hair.</p><p>Remus put his book down and looked at Sirius. "Fine, but fail one class and you're all studying with me. I mean it." Remus warned him.</p><p>Once James got all the chocolate he gave it to Sirius and Remus saw it. "Chocolate..." he whispered. He immediately put his book down and looked at all the chocolate that they had in their compartment now.</p><p>Sirius lifted his hands in mock defense and smiled "Sure Moony. I'll take on that deal." he took the chocolate and placed it on the seat beside him "Yeah, want some?"<br/>
Remus nodded. "Of course I want some and I meant not only you, but also Prongs and Wormtail." Remus said.</p><p>"What? I said nothing about you studying so soon." Peter said in defense.</p><p>"You need it too, your tests last year weren't that outstanding..." Remus said. Peter looked down at that. "Oh come on, Moony, he's doing his best." James said.</p><p>"I know, sorry.." Remus said quickly and he took a piece of chocolate. "I'm just not feeling well. Don't take it too personal, Peter." Remus said.</p><p>Sirius just chuckled and lazily tossed some chocolate at the other two boys across from them. He picked up a chocolate frog and ate it before looking at the card, only half caring. "So, care to share the first prank you have planned for this year, Prongs?"</p><p>James cleared his throat at that. "Well before I tell you guys that. I thought it would be better if we quit bullying Snape. My parents found out because I had written something about a prank on him and they were furious. So..." James said. </p><p>Remus just blinked and Peter looked shocked. "Then who do we prank?" Peter asked. Remus said nothing as he was kind of speechless.</p><p>Sirius moved his head so quickly in James directiom that he almost got whiplash. "Good question. He was our main target in these pranks." He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"I don't know, maybe Lily? Or one of the professors..?" James tried.</p><p>"Why would you want to prank your crush, James?" Remus asked.</p><p>"I don't even like Lily, what are you talking about?" James looked down, he was hiding something for sure. Something big.</p><p>"Don't like her?" Peter asked in disbelief.</p><p>Sirius looked at him puzzled "Mate, you've been fawning over her since first year and now you just stop? Are you feeling alright? Wormtail, check him for a fever." he sighed "She's just gonna hate you more if we start pranking her."</p><p>"I've been over her since 5th year." James pouted and Peter actually checked him for a fever. "And?" Remus asked.<br/>
"Nope, normal temperature. Maybe he's pranking us.." Peter said.</p><p>"I'm not pranking you guys! Bloody Merlin, is it so weird that I don't like Lily and don't want to bully Snape anymore?!" James actually got pissed off.</p><p>Sirius raised an eyebrow "EUh, yeah mate. You're acting completely different. Did something happen over the summer?" He sighed and leaned back in his seat, not sure what else to do. James was actually pissed about this and to them it made absolutely no sense.</p><p>James stood up and suddenly left though, without a word. "Prongs!" Remus called and he got up but James didn't turn back. Sirius stopped Remus from going "give him some time to cool down. We'll find him later, if not on the train then in dorm."</p><p>"Sirius, have you looked at him properly? He wasn't going crazy. He had something serious going on. Besides we're joking about it but you know how lovely James' parents are, they would never accept bullying even if James was doing it. If they actually found out, they'd be furious and they'd want him to stop immediately." Remus said.</p><p>"I know, I've been staying there for most of the summer, Remus. They never once mentioned anything like that when I was there, nor did any of them have any tension between them that could lead one to believe that they'd talked or argued about something like that." Sirius said back.</p><p>"So you're saying he's lying? Why would James of all people lie to us?" Remus asked. </p><p>"Uhm guys, I don't want to make it even more suspicious but last year he got more and more visibly uncomfortable whenever we pulled a prank of Snape." Peter said. "I'm just...saying, maybe he has been thinking of quitting last year already?" Peter suggested.</p><p>"I'm not saying he's lying, I'm saying he might be hiding something from us and  by the looks of it, something big." he looked over to Peter and then thought for a moment "You have a point, I remember that as well but shrugged it off at the time." He turned back to look at Remus. "What would make him act like that? It can't be cause he's afraid. He's never been afraid of that git."</p><p>"I have no idea." Remus said. "And don't go like, 'aren't you supposed to be smart, Moony?' I might be, yes but I'm not very good at finding out how people feel just by body language." Remus said.</p><p>"Why would he hide anything from us then?" Peter asked. "I mean... we share everything. Even stuff that we shouldn't know about eachother." Peter added.</p><p>Sirius nods "Yeah, maybe we could try to make him tell us." He snapped his fingers when he got an idea "Maybe we could get him drunk on our next visit to Hogsmead. Then get him talking and somehow get the information out of him." He offered. It might not be a full proof plan but it was a suggestion.</p><p>"That's a brilliant idea!" Peter said but Remus looked at them like a disapproving parent. "No, it's a horrible one. Get him drunk to tell something? Are you guys insane?" Remus asked.</p><p>Sirius shrugged "It's proven efficient by the many times it's worked on my parents." He chuckled softly "I thought we established that there is indeed at least a little insanity in all of us."</p><p>"He's your friend, Sirius. Not one of your parents. He doesn't deserve that." Remus said sternly. </p><p>"Then what do we do?" Peter asked. "We wait." Remus simply answered.<br/>
Sirius sighed "Well excuse me for not  knowing any other way." he ran a hand through his hair "Wait? For how long?"</p><p>"Untill he tells us." Remus said. </p><p>"But that's the same as doing nothing.. " Argued Peter. "We can't push him. He will tell it whenever he's ready I'm sure." Remys said.</p><p>Sirius sighed "And what if he's never ready, mate? Are we just going to accept that within the course if maybe a month, he did a complete one eighty?"</p><p>"This didn't happen in one month. Peter said already that James was getting uncomfortable with bullying Snape, last year. So..this is been going on for longer. We just didn't pay as much attention to it." Remus said. "And so be it. We'll see it at the end of the year then. James is definitely seeing someone and you and I know he's going to live with that person once school is over." Remus said.</p><p>"You want us to wait for like 10 months?" Peter asked.</p><p>"Yes, if that's needed." Remus said.</p><p>Sirius sighed and plopped down dramatically on the train seat "That's sooooooo long to wait. We could just get it over with quickly" it was clearly a trait he got from his animagus form showing. Impatience.</p><p>"You are such a hypocrite, Sirius. You are hiding things yourself so don't be so butt hurt over James hiding something and not coming to you right away. Maybe try to be a good friend and talk to him and if he doesn't say anything, drop it and try another time but don't push him and don't be so impatient." Remus said.</p><p>"Thought you already knew that, Moony." He shrugged "I didn't say I wasn't hiding anything and I don't blame him for having his secrets but he makes it obvious that he's hiding something. That's the difference. We did try to talk to him and he ran off. He's gonna do it again" Sirius replied back.</p><p>"You have to talk to him by yourself. He needs an one on one conversation, Sirius. And you are the best pick for this. You know him the best out of us three." Remus said. "You're like brothers." he added.</p><p>Sirius gave him a 'really?' look. "Fine, I'll talk to him, but not now. I need to think of how to get him alone first." He popped another sweet in his mouth "I'll try tonight after the feast."</p><p>Remus nodded and as they arrived at Hogwarts, the marauders saw James talking to Lily while they were on their way to the dinner hall. "Maybe he likes Lily after all?" Peter suggested to the other two. "Hmm, the way they look he looks at her doesn't look like her likes her..." Remus said. "Then what would they be talking about?" Peter asked. "Whatever it is, it's private." Remus said and then James came their way again and he pretended the whole thing in the train didn't happen.</p><p>"Guys, let's go stuff ourselves!" he said excitedly.</p><p>Sirius smiled when James came back over to them and went along with it. For now, what happened on  the train didn't happen. "Sounds good, mate." The great hall was decorated as always, the sound of students talking happily was almost the only thing you could hear.<br/>
The marauders soon joined the other Gryffindor students at the table and after a speech from Dumbledore and the sorting of the first years, the feast started. James quickly started eating already and so did Peter. Remus decided to just stick with some soup and bread. Remus found it strange that James acted like nothing happened but didn't bring it up because he thought James would do so if he felt comfortable with it.<br/>
Sirius tuned our Dumbledore's usual boring speech and didn't care much for the sorting either. He glanced to the Slytherin table, seeing Regulus sitting there with his friends as usual. He just received a glare in return from his brother. He then looked to James and smiled. He decided to eat some chicken and soup but nothing else really. This would be a tricky year all around.</p><p>While James was eating he secretly glanced to the Slytherin table and looked if he saw Severus anywhere and when he noticed him he winked at him and smiled. But didn't knew Remus actually saw that happen and out of shock he spit out his soup and started coughing.</p><p>Sirius glanced over to Remus and slapped his back to try and help "You okay there? What happened, mate?" He asked, concerned about his friend, so much so that he wasn't paying attention to the others.<br/>
"Nothing...just saw something weird." Remus said. He found it definetly strange what he saw but he wasn't the person to call out people like that so he kept to himself what he had seen. James turned back now too as he had heard Remus coughing and Peter looked up too. They both were worried but Remus brushed it off.</p><p>"Alright, try not to scare us like that though." Sirius said and sighed in relief that Remus was okay. He went back to rating his food, glancing around the great hall at the other tables as well.<br/>
After the feast, James and Peter already went straight to the dorm but Remus held Sirius back. "I don't wanna go to the dorm yet. Can we walk around a bit?" Remus asked. He wanted to talk with him a little.</p><p>Sirius glanced to Peter and James as they hurried to the common room. He was about to follow but looked at Remus when he stopped him "Uh, sure. It'll be less boring than hanging around the common room for most of the night."</p><p>Remus smiled a bit and then gently grabbed his hand and left the dining hall with him and walked around the hall with him. "The full moon will be there in three days so...I might get moody..." he warned softly. "I'm not saying it's your guys fault, in fact you guys have made it way easier for me but...it still hurts a lot.." he said.</p><p>Sirius smiled and followed after him, not minding holding his hand. "That's fine, we're used to it by now." He sighed, having seen the transformation countles times by now and it looked like a lot of pain. "It looks like it hurts a lot. We'll go to the shrieking shack as we usually do, so don't worry about it too much."</p><p>Remus nodded and then leaned against Sirius a bit. "James acting strange is giving me more stress though. We shoudn't push him but I've seen...something very strange and I feel like my eyes were fooling me but still..." Remus said but then shook his head. "I shouldn't worry so much right. I've got my own problems to worry about already."</p><p>Sirius sighed softly as the hallways got darker "It could've been both. I'll keep an eye out for anything strange." He glanced to Remus and then back to where they were walking "Worry about the moon first and  James later. We can figure this out another time."</p><p>"Yes, you're right. But if I see him do something strange again, I'll just walk off. Anything that's out of the ordinary stresses me out right now." Remus said and as they came outside for a bit, Remus stared up at the sky. </p><p>"Sirius...have you ever like....liked someone? You know, the way we thought James liked Lily but then for real?" Remus tried as he was bad at asking this kind of things.</p><p>Sirius nods "That's understandable. I'm sure those two won't even notice." Once outside he looked up at the sky and at the stars. He'd almost forgotten how breathtaking it was. He wasn't sure how to reply but then just said the truth anyway "Yeah, why?"</p><p>"Just asking out of curiousity. Can I ask who it is?" Remus asked and felt somehow nervous about it. "Is it someone I know?" Remus didn't ask if it was a girl, even though he knew almost for sure that Sirius was into girls, he didn't assume anything.</p><p>Sirius bit his lip "I'd prefer to keep that a secret for now, but yes, it's someone you know. I want to be sure they like me back before I get my hopes up." he chuckled and scratched the back of his neck. His hair had become quite long during the summer and he didn't want to cut it cause he kinda liked it.</p><p>Remus hadn't said anything about the hair because he kinda liked it too. "You shouldn't wait to long though, they might be stolen by someone else if you're not quick enough." Remus had no idea at all about who the other was talking. He was glad that Sirius didn't ask him the same question though. "But I'm glad you have found someone you like. You definetly deserve it."</p><p>Sirius chuckled at the last part "I highly doubt it, Moony. Most people see me  as a player. I'll be lucky, if anything, if they do like me back." he shrugged and then smiled, looking up at the stars again.</p><p>"I don't think you're a player. But if they accept you, I'll slap you if you mess with them." Remus said. "And well, I could say the same thing...who would like me? A sourpuss that studies way too much. I'm not romantic at all and I'm way too strict. Nobody likes that.." Remus sighed and he let Sirius' hand go for a bit.</p><p>Sirius chuckled again "I wouldn't expect anything less than a slap." he raised an eyebrow "We like you, mate. It's always more fun to pull pranks when you're around and you can so sweet sometimes. You<br/>
might just be surprised." He shrugged "Maybe someone likes you, maybe they're right under your nose." he hoped that wouldn't make it too obvious.</p><p>He wasn't sure if Remus liked guys or not and for all he knows it might make his friend hate him.</p><p>Remus blinked for a moment. "There's no way you...nevermind. We're friends..." he looked away. Did he just get that the wrong way? Remus felt embarrassed now. There was no way that Sirius liked him of all people.</p><p>Sirius looked away from Remus as a light blush dusted his cheeks. Of course Remus would figure it out. He's the smartest damn student in this place. Damn it all. He felt a rush of fear and embarrasment and looked down, biting his lip.</p><p>"How stupid of me. Of course you don't. We're friends and I'm a guy so..sorry for assuming you meant you like me." Remus said and honestly he wanted to hide in a corner right now but suddenly Peter came up to them. "Guys! James has left and he took the cloak and the map." Peter said as he ran to them.</p><p>"Don't throw it completely out the door." he mumbled, almost incoherently. Sirius turned around when he heard Peter coming towards them. The blush had long gone and now he was slightly worried "Why? Did he say what for?" He asked.<br/>
"No but he took flowers with him and asked me before he left if they smelled nice." Peter frowned as he told what happened to Remus and Sirius.</p><p>"Did you try to follow him?" Remus asked, frowning. "Yeah but in the hall he put the cloak on so I didn't see where he went." Peter sighed.</p><p>Sirius thought for a moment. He could always use his aninagus form to track James down. "Which hallway did you last see him in? Maybe I could track him" he offered, glancing between Peter and Remus.</p><p>"The one at the dining hall." Peter said. "Let's go see then if Sirius can track him from there." Remus said and as they went to the hall he looked at Sirius. "I wonder who he's giving flowers.. " Peter frowned.</p><p>"I wonder the same." Remus sighed.<br/>
Sirius nods and heads towards that hall. He looked around for a moment. It was quiet and no other students were in sight. He changed into his animagus form and sniffed around a bit. He found James's scent easily enough and then took off in the direction it lead. He was quieter than a mouse, albeit running down several hallways and then stopping, waiting for the other two to catch up. He'd forgotten he was faster than they were in dog form.</p><p>James's scent took him to the dungeons though where the Slyherin dorms were and once Remus and Peter catched up, they both looked confused. "The Slytherin dorms?" They asked.</p><p>Sirius just nodded, not being able to speak in this form. Regulus didn't notice the two Gryffindors and just walked to the entrance. Sirius silently fell into step with him. Once the door slid open, he slipped inside unnoticed. It was dark enough for him to hide in the shadows but if he was caught now he'd be in deep shit.</p><p>The common room was empty aside for James and Severus sitting on the couch together. "I'm glad you like the flowers, Sev." James said.</p><p>Remus and Peter waited outside as they couldn't get in there unnoticed and they only could wonder what Sirius would be seeing inside the Slytherin common room. Was James secretly seeing a Slytherin girl?</p><p>Sirius sat quietly in the shadows. His jaw dropped at the sight. It made his stomach churn. Just a while back James still hated Severus, going as far as basically bullying him and now this. When and how did this happen? He wondered to himself.</p><p>"I can't stay tonight but what if we go to Hogsmeade this weekend?" James asked and he kissed Severus' cheek. "Sure..James, if you and your friends finally stop pestering me." Severus said.</p><p>"I have suggested to them to stop but they desperately want a reason but..I can't tell them about us dating. They'd drop me instantly." James said.</p><p>It was as if glass broke inside Sirius' mind. He couldn't believe what he'd just heard. There was no mistaking it. A cold shiver ran up and down his spine. He's stumbled upon something he shouldn't have and this could end up way worse than any other situation before. He had to find a way to get out of the common room and quick. It felt like a lump was in his throat and he glanced around. No other students yet and he couldn't change back to say the password to get out either.</p><p>"Try to talk to them tonight and leave before anyone sees you okay?" Severus suggested. James nodded and quickly kissed Severus' lips before getting up and leaving, having no idea about his friends being so near but once he exited he saw Peter and Remus and he instantly got as white as new parchment.</p>
