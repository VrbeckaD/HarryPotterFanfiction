          <div class="userstuff"><p> </p><p>A Dark Lord prides themselves on their ability to seduce people to their cause. The usual tempt, bribe, punish and threaten cycle to get the unwilling to do their bidding. To do so, he must know what makes whom tick, who would be willing to pay what cost or which prize. And the inner desires of a child surprisingly don’t change even when they become an adult.</p><p> </p><p>Being the DADA professor, or really, possessing one, is the ideal position to abuse to get that knowledge. A simple surprise test, an essay, for all first years conducted annually as a character study is his chance to do so. The topic is simple, yet as revealing as a Boggart.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “What do you want from Magic? What can Magic do for you?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The first years groan and moan when he declares a surprise test. Only the muggleborn, Granger, from Gryffindor and the Ravenclaws perk up, their eyes shining with determination to prove themselves. It scares even Quirrell, who was once a Ravenclaw himself. Voldemort cursed the weakness of his vessel again, but Quirrell manages to get through the day and the Dark Lord holds back his temper.</p><p> </p><p>The essays are all as usual. Just what he would expect from children. It is a test of his mind, to analyse what each desire well and truly means when taken in a real-life context. A Boggart, when interpreted correctly, can be used to punish and threaten someone. A child’s essay on “What they want Magic for?” is far more revealing and can be used for tempting and bribing purposes.</p><p> </p><p>Some of them want to fly, some want to go to the moon, some want to become rich while some want to become the next Merlin. Some want to bring glory to their family while others want to destroy theirs, some want to stand-out in their family while some want to usurp the position of power in theirs.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing surprising or unique. Until he reads Harry Potter’s essay.</p><p> </p><p>It is a parchment full of chicken scrawl, with no sense of coherence, purpose, no assumptions, no examples and no facts to back those non-existent examples. It is full of what Harry doesn’t want, what he wants and what he wishes for. Yet, it is also an essay that hits too close to his heart, too close to home, and for the first time, Voldemort understands why the prophecy declared Harry Potter to have the power to vanquish him: they are too similar. The only difference is that Tom Marvolo Riddle had learnt the cruelty of the world by this point. He had given up. Harry Potter hasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>It is for this, and this reason alone, that Voldemort decides to protect the boy. And if saving Harry Potter also works towards Tom Riddle’s own first-year wish for finding a family, then it is simply a coincidence.</p><p> </p><p>Years later, after the war is over and his dreams are achieved, the letter that started it all is still in his pocket, safe and secure.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I don’t want to die. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> I haven’t made friends yet. I haven’t eaten pizza yet. I haven’t learnt how to swim yet. I haven’t spent hours lazying around yet. I haven’t even watched the telly yet.
