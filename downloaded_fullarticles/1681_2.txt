    <p>The dementor glided fast over the frozen forest as he had to return to his nest after a mission accomplished. The minister had asked that a kiss be given in a distant village, and he had decided to take charge of the task instead of delegating it to one of his subjects.</p><p> </p><p>The habits and customs of his species were a mystery to humans and he, like his ancestors, was happy with that situation.</p><p> </p><p>He took the longest route home, enjoying the silence of his trip, as much as a dementor could enjoy something. He loved to feel the trees shivering as he passed through them and to see as the little animals sought refuge in the caves.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>In an instant, something changed, and he could sense the strongest hopelessness and defeat coming from a clearing nearby. He could feel the strong emotions, and he glided in that direction. He arrived at the clearing and discovered a lump shivering on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>A pregnant woman was lying on the floor, crying in pain while protecting her big bulge with her hands. She looked around and whimpered when he approached and touched her head. She was dying, but she was worried about her infant, a little girl who could be so powerful and bright.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, help me,” She murmured, trying to grab his hands, and pulling him to her side as she grabbed his coat.</p><p> </p><p>The dementor did not know how to communicate with the woman. He approached his front to hers, wishing to be able to talk with her.</p><p> </p><p>“You are cold,” He heard and nodded, “ Will you help my baby?”</p><p> </p><p>“I will help you both, but she will be marked for my blood.”</p><p> </p><p>“Will she be alright?”</p><p> </p><p>“She will be powerful and protected by my kind.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want in return for your help?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing, just embrace the power which your baby has inside her; do not forbid her from her magic.”</p><p> </p><p>“Magic?”</p><p> </p><p>“She will be a powerful witch, but she will be vulnerable. She will need your love and comfort. I will defy my creator to help you, so this is what I ask from you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I will do it,” the woman said closing her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>The dementor felt her trust deciding that she would be worthy of his help. He channeled his power to the weak woman, funneling her body with energy and magic, boosting her child’s magic with his own. Some minutes later, he felt the slow breathing coming from the woman, and stop the flow. She was safe, and he would take her to the closest city, to be discovered and helped by humans.</p>
