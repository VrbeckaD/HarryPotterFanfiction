    <p>  Harry Potter. That little fucker.</p><p>  Tom Riddle, or better known as ‘Lord Voldemort’ around the office, despised Harry Potter. The smug little shit, bad-mouthing Tom whenever he got the chance. He doesn’t understand why everyone seems to love him.</p><p>  <em>Harry Potter is so great, Harry Potter is such a charming guy, If you need help settling in just talk to Harry Potter. </em></p><p>  Why does everyone like the green-eyed prick? No one with green eyes is trustworthy and that’s just a fact. Do you know what else has green eyes? Snakes. And that’s just what Harry Potter is. A slithery little snake planning something sinister.</p><p>  When Potter first started here, he was just some coffee boy who was supposed to keep his mouth shut and make sure everyone was pleased with their donuts. Then <em>somehow </em>he wormed his way into office assistant.</p><p>  Only because the old bitch known as Albus Dumbledore, also their boss, had some very obvious favoritism. Tom was fairly certain that Potter was performing fellatio on the old fart behind closed doors.</p><p>  Tom has done everything in his power to get him fired. Seven failed attempts over the past seven months. No matter what he does, he just can’t get rid of him!</p><p>  He’s misplaced files that were supposed to be in Potter’s possession, spread rumors around the office (“Did you hear that Potter is a hermaphrodite?”), telling Dumbledore that his performance hasn’t been up to par. All to no avail.</p><p>  “You ever think that maybe you don’t like him because he doesn’t talk to you like he talks to everybody?” Bellatrix cheekily tells him one afternoon.</p><p>  Tom was absolutely disgusted by the mere implications that the statement held. Him? Liking Potter? Preposterous.</p><p>  “Hey, Voldemort!” Speaking of the devil, “Want to go out for lunch?”</p><p>  And Tom only said yes because this could possibly give him some dirt on the green-eyed snake.  </p>
