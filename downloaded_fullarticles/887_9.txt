    <p>It had been years since Minerva had last been to Privet Drive, but in the intervening time she’d thought about Harry Potter often. The last she’d seen him, he’d been a sleeping little bundle on a doorstep, newly orphaned but too young to know it. Her last impression of the Dursleys: a pushover mother, a brat of a son, an overbearing father. Albus had told her explicitly not to get involved. He had been quite clear that it was best that Harry be raised by his aunt and uncle. But it wouldn’t hurt anything only to check, and it would put her mind at ease if she knew that James and Lily’s son was happy and well. It was just past sunrise on a Saturday morning when she leaped up onto the garden wall of Number Four, Privet Drive, and seated herself exactly where she had nearly four years ago so she could watch the front rooms of the Dursley house. </p><p>	Twenty minutes into her watch, Harry’s aunt, in her dressing gown and a pair of slippers, came down the stairs, turned, and stopped beside them before leaning down to knock briskly on the cupboard door. Minerva couldn’t hear the words she spoke through the window, but she saw the mean twist of Mrs. Dursley’s mouth and bristled, horrified by what she was sure would happen next. The door was opened from inside, and out came a tiny, twiggy boy with a mess of black hair and his father’s distinctive nose. He was wearing clothes that, even for pajamas, were far too large, and when he looked up into his aunt’s face, he was met with a scowl. Despicable—to treat a five-year-old that way—but Minerva forced herself to keep still and straight-backed on the wall. Obviously, her initial suspicion that this would not be a suitable home for Harry had been well-founded, but she waited. Dumbledore might not be convinced so easily. His conviction that Harry was best left here had been so strong. </p><p>	Harry walked into the kitchen, and under Minerva’s watchful eye and no other, he pulled out a step stool, filled a kettle and put it on the stove, and then proceeded to heat up a frying pan, bring out eggs and sausage, and start cooking. Without the stool he wouldn’t have been able to see the top of the stove, but even with it, the spatula looked awkward in his tiny hand, and it was all Minerva could do to resist the urge to transfigure back into her human form and go inside to take the boy away. But she only watched. Once breakfast was ready and Mrs. Dursley had called her husband and son down from upstairs, Harry served them all and poured their tea before going to fetch himself a plate. He paused when his uncle rapped hard on the window, and Minerva realized that he was rapping at her. </p><p>	“Shoo!” Mr. Dursley’s muffled voice came from inside the house, but Minerva didn’t twitch a whisker. He said something to Harry, and a minute later, the little boy walked out of the house in bare feet and headed straight towards her. </p><p>	“Hi there,” Harry said, having to tilt his head up to look at her on her perch, “Uncle Vernon says you’ve got to go. I’m sorry. He doesn’t like cats very much, and he hates strays.” What in the world had they done to teach Harry such sweet manners, when their own were so terrible? Unless Harry was naturally so kind-hearted that it hadn’t rubbed off on him yet, somehow. She tried to look less stern, softening her eyes and relaxing her tail, before, after a quick glance at the window, shaking her head.</p><p>	“You don’t want to go?” Harry asked, eyes going round, “It’s really not so nice, here. You wouldn’t like it. Dudley will chase you or pull your tail. He doesn’t like cats, either.” Minerva could do nothing but shake her head again. She couldn’t transfigure here, in broad daylight on a muggle street, and she wouldn’t take Harry until she informed Dumbledore of the situation, and they could make arrangements. “Please?” Harry said, and there was a faint trace of fear in his voice, “Please go, or he’ll be angry I didn’t make you leave, and I’m really hungry.” It shouldn’t have come as a shock that the sort of people who would make a child live in a cupboard would also deny him meals, but Minerva still felt a jolt of white-hot rage sear down to her bones, and stiff as a spring, she bounded down from the garden wall. Harry gave an audible sigh. “Thank you. Sorry, kitty.” Minerva never tolerated being pet in her animagus form, but she made an exception for Harry, as the little boy squatted down to scratch her ears. </p><p>	“You should have seen the way they were treating him,” Minerva said, shoulders set and jaw severe as she stared down Dumbledore across his desk, “Not like their child. Not like a child at all. A five-year-old, using a stove unsupervised. Cooking for the whole family. Made to eat last, and less. You should see him, Dumbledore. He’s skin and bones. Such a sweet boy, but he doesn’t get an ounce of affection from his aunt and uncle for it. And to live in a cupboard! They have plenty of room in that house. He could have a bedroom. They’re denying him a bed out of sheer spite.”</p><p>	“As I said before,” Dumbledore said, watching Minerva placidly over his half-moon spectacles, “I have determined that it is vital to Harry’s safety that he remain with his aunt. It will provide him protection against Voldemort if and when he returns.”</p><p>	“’If and when he returns’!” Minerva echoed, green eyes hard as glass, “They’re might not be a boy left to protect by the time that happens. He looks as though he’s starving. And I’m sure his aunt resents him his magic, and his uncle, judging by his personality, is probably repulsed by it.  He could become an obscurial, if he doesn’t waste away first. Or his bully of a cousin could shove him down the stairs. And the muggles have their own way of protecting children. What if, when he goes to school, a teacher reports his family to the authorities. Will you hush them up too, or let him be taken into foster care?”</p><p>	“Rest assured, Minerva, I have impressed upon them how important it is that Harry remain alive. I am confident he’ll get to Hogwarts in one piece.” </p><p>	“That’s not good enough.” Minerva could not remember the last time she’d been this furious. She could feel the blood pulsing behind her eyes, though with every last thread of her will, she kept her voice level. Her knuckles were white as she gripped her wand at her side. “Alive and in one piece isn’t good enough. What about his well-being? What about his happiness? Can’t we find another means by which we can protect the boy? The Fidelius Charm, perhaps?”</p><p>	“Has its flaws,” Dumbledore said, unruffled, steepling his fingers, “As Harry’s presence at Number Four can attest to, in the first place.” </p><p>	“Only if the Secret-Keeper tells their secret,” Minerva answered, voice pitching higher and louder despite herself, “And I would protect the location of the Potters' son with my life.”</p><p>	“But it would be of no help while he was at Hogwarts, and out and about in his daily life. Only when he was in the hiding place.” </p><p>	“When he is at Hogwarts? Dumbledore, you are at Hogwarts. A dozen of the most skilled witches and wizards who stood against Voldemort live here. And Hogwarts has protections of its own. And even you admit the protection that those people provide will not last forever. Please,” As much as she could, Minerva softened her voice, “Allow me to take Harry. He can stay here. I’ll look after him and ensure his fame doesn’t go to his head.”</p><p>	Dumbledore’s brow furrowed, and what looked like genuine sorrow showed in his eyes and the lines around his mouth. She was sure of what he would say when he opened his mouth, and knew what her own response would have to be, too. “I’m very sorry, Minerva. I can’t allow you to do that.” </p><p>	“Well,” Minerva said, turning on her heel with a snap, and feeling her righteous rage spill out of her mouth like steam from the spout of a tea kettle as she whisked herself onto the staircase, “Then you’ll have to find a way to stop me within the next hour, Dumbledore. You can pry that boy out of my cold, dead hands.”</p>
