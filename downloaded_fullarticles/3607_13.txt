    <p>“Al...” Edward moaned,</p><p>“How many days has it been?”</p><p>“A week today, brother,” Alphonse replied with a smile.</p><p>Sprawled lazily on the living room couch was how Ed had spent most of the last week. Al, unwilling to leave him to suffer alone, usually joined in the waiting. Sometimes, Al would stand up and check the mailbox with a smile. So far, it was to no avail.</p><p>“This sucks!” Ed continued, complaining further of their predicament.</p><p>“You mustn’t worry, brother, I’m sure it will be here soon!” Al, meanwhile, remained as hopeful ever. His vigilance was admirable, but hardly helped the matter.</p><p>“I’ll go check the mailbox!” Al announced cheerfully, rising to his feet. Ed murmured his appreciation and closed his eyes with a soft sigh.</p><p>“Hey, mom!” Al shouted to his mother who had been hanging laundry as he ran out the door. She let out a small laugh in response, watching him dash down the dirt road.</p><p>Nearing the mailbox, Al slowed to a halt, hands on his knees as he panted heavily. Drawing himself up, he popped open the little door. Tucked neatly inside sat a small parchment envelope, a letter.</p><p>He blinked with disbelief, could it possibly be? Al’s agape mouth slowly curled into a smile as he withdrew the letter. There, neatly written in emerald ink was their address and a single name: Edward Elric.</p><p>Even quicker than he had retrieved it, Al returned to the house and thrust the letter into Ed’s hands.</p><p>“It’s here!” He exclaimed,</p><p>“Mom was right! They did send you a letter!”</p><p>Ed recklessly torn open the envelope and extracted the letter from within.</p><p>Dear Mr. Elric,<br/>
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.<br/>
Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.<br/>

Deputy Headmistress</p><p>Ecstatic with the promised letter’s arrival, Ed wasted no time getting his school supplies. He begged his mother desperately until they had time to travel to East City.</p><p>“Have you though about which one you’re going to pick?”</p><p>“Huh, what are you talking about, Al?”</p><p>“A cat, a toad, an owl! Which one are you going to choose?”</p><p>“I haven’t really given much thought to that,” Ed admitted, glancing out the train window.</p><p>“Really?” Al asked, almost incredulously.</p><p>“Yeah. What I’ve really been thinking about is what house I’ll be sorted into!” He turned to his brother, smiling.</p><p>“I’m sure you’ll be the best wizard of whatever house you’re put in,” Trisha patted his head, smiling just as brightly.</p><p>“Well?” Al prompted.</p><p>It was a long train ride, but Ed thought it was well worth it.</p><p>After a busy day of shopping and exploring East City, the three Elric’s returned to their home in Resembool.</p><p>“Ed! Al!” A familar girl shouted, running up to them as the left the train platform.</p><p>“Hi, Winry!” The brothers replied.</p><p>“You were getting your school things, weren’t you?”</p><p>“Yep, but how did you know?”</p><p>Winry raised a piece of parchment, identical to Ed’s except for the different surname.</p><p>“Dear Ms. Rockbell,” Ed mumbled under his breath, reading aloud the first line of the letter.</p><p>“That’s great, Winry!” Al clapped his hands together,</p><p>“But it will be lonely without either of you two around...”</p><p>“Next year, you’ll join us, though,” Ed smiled.</p><p>“Come on!” Winry exclaimed, grabbing one of each of their hands. Together, they ran off to play, leaving Trisha to walk home alone. It didn’t sadden her and she went with a soft smile.</p><p>Hohenheim would be so proud.</p>
