    <p>
  <span>Davina stared at her ticket once more. It was really there. Black on white. Platform 9 ¾. There was only one problem. She had no idea where platform 9 ¾ could be. Yes, it was without a doubt here, somewhere between platform 9 and platform 10. And considering the fact that she was going to a magic school, there was probably some magical entrance. But how was she supposed to know where to find it? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Hello beautiful damsel in distress." A handsome looking boy with a green scarf around his neck wrapped an arm around her tender shoulders. "Don't worry any longer. Your savior and prince charming has arrived." He took the ticket from her hands. "Let me guess: You're the first witch in your family."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Davina tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "I don't need help. I've figured everything out myself so far. I'm sure I can figure this out too." She bent her head and stared at her luggage. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Okay, she had to admit that buying everything she needed had been an adventure in itself and had taken three entire days, but she had eventually gotten there. And she had not had any help. Well, not much at least, apart from one kind red haired lady who had shown her how to actually enter the hidden magical world behind an ordinary looking wall. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"That sounds like a brave thing to say." The stranger raised his eyebrows. "Especially if you're at least eleven years behind on everyone else here. Well, on most people. There are surely people like you." He shrugged his shoulders. "We can't all be as amazing as the Mikaelson family." He stepped back and stretched out his hand. "Kol, the coolest and most handsome Mikaelson you'll ever meet."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Davina couldn't keep herself from smiling at Kol and she shook his hand firmly. "Davina Claire." She pulled her hand back. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"It's a pleasure to meet you, Davina Claire." Kol stepped back. "I hope you'll find the platform before the train leaves." He stared at the clock above his head ticking away the seconds. "You have ten more minutes. Good luck." He saluted her and then he turned around. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Are you teasing innocent first years again, Kol?" A blond haired girl shook her head. "One day you're gonna scare one of them away."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Not this one." Kol looked over his shoulder and winked at the witch who didn't even know she was one until a few weeks ago when her invitation for Hogwarts had all of a sudden been in her mailbox. "She's certain she will find the platform without my help."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Kol!" The blond haired girl stood still and with fast steps she rushed back towards Davina. "I'm sorry for my brother." She took Davina's arm and barely gave the girl the chance to grab her luggage. "Trust me. You won't solve this riddle on your own. I admire your attempt to try." She stood still in front of a wall. "Kol? Why don't you show Davina how it works?" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Kol stuck the tip of his tongue between his lips and he cocked his head. "With pleasure, Freya. See you on the other side, darling." Kol winked at Davina and he started running towards the wall. Before the echo of his words had died out he disappeared. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"You just run towards it." Freya placed a hand on Davina's lower back. "Your turn. I will be close behind you." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Davina hesitated for a moment. Her heart was racing in her chest and the adrenaline was rushing through her veins. She had never understood what people meant with a rollercoaster of emotions and feelings, but all of a sudden it made sense. She was nervous, excited, scared, terrified and curious all at once. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Can you please hurry a little, we don't have all day." Freya tapped her foot impatiently on the stone floor. "That train leaves, with or without us, so you better make sure you're not even a second late." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Davina took a deep breath and then she started running. She closed her eyes when she approached the wall, but while she was preparing to crash into it and break all her bones a pair of strong and safe arms caught her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Easy, darling." Kol held onto her firmly. "You don't want to hurt yourself before getting on the train." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Davina widened her eyes while she saw the old steaming black train with the words Hogwarts Express written on it. Platform 9 ¾. She had found it. Well, she had gotten a little help finding it, but that was much better than missing the train. Especially if that train was really leaving punctually, something she wasn't really used to since she had spent her entire life surrounded by humans. She freed herself from Kol's embrace and she couldn't fight the urge to touch the train. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"A thank you would've been nice, but enjoy the trip." Kol walked past her and his shoulder brushed hers. He disappeared into one of the compartments before Davina could say something.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Don't worry. We've all be there." Freya appeared next to Davina again. "But my brother's right about one thing. You'll enjoy the ride." She walked past Davina too. "Make sure to find a seat next to the window." She looked over her shoulder once more before she stepped into the same compartment as Kol.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One last time Davina turned her head towards King's Cross and the human world she had not officially left yet. She had five more minutes to get on board and find that empty spot next to the window. Five more minutes before she would no longer be Davina Claire, ordinary girl from Leeds. Five more minutes before she would become the witch she had always been, even though she didn't know.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was by far the most exciting thing that had ever happened to her.</span>
