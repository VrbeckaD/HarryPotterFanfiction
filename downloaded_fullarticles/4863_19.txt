    <p>
  <span>          At first glance, the room seemed quiet. There was hardly any movement to rouse the surroundings and not enough excitement to change anything. Yet, if one sat in the room long enough, they might just hear the daily band kick up. The hum of electricity firing through the lights paired with the sweet whisper of the wind blowing outside harmonized to create an entrancing song that encompassed the small office. As the tapping of a foot and the scratch of a quill joined the ensemble, the song quickly developed an upbeat tempo and was on its way to become a new one hit wonder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>          Before long, a light tapping interrupted the beat. The once minor nuisance gradually developed from a slight annoyance to a consistent, aggressive berating against the glass. Now distracted with a lost thought, Newt huffed and swiveled his chair around to face the outside. On the ledge of the windowsill sat a mildly large barred owl with honey-colored plumage flecked with white feathers. In its beak rested a crimson letter with hastily scratched out writing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>          Newt swiftly heaved the window open and beckoned the creature inside. It briskly dove into the room-flipping papers with its movements-and perched itself on the back of the Newt's office chair. The bird waited expectantly as the man closed the window and reached into his pocket to slip out a few owl treats. The animal gratefully traded with the wizard and dropped the letter onto Newt's ink-stained hands. He quickly scanned the seal and discovered it was an urgent notice from the Ministry of Magic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>          Tearing the wax back, the man browsed the document's contents and was met with unsettling news. Accompanied by a moving mugshot, the header read in bold print, "<strong>STATE OF EMERGENCY: GELLERT GRINDELWALD'S ESCAPE</strong>". Newt's heart pounded as he delved into the article. Details on the convict's escape, warnings about protection, and contact information for the Ministry filled up the entire letter. After reading the last sentence, images of Tina, Queenie, and Jacob flickered across Newt's mind. The adventure they had, the deaths that ensured, and Jacob's obliviated memories (thankfully, but secretly returned) came flooding back to him. He sighed and thought about the trauma they endured to capture the infamous murderer. The depression the Goldstein's must be in came to Newt's attention. There was no doubt they had received similar news. It was as if all their work meant nothing at all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>          Stressed and depressed, Newt dropped back into his original position. He tossed the letter onto the desk and stared at it. A pop of emerald caught Newt's attention and it laid in contrast underneath the scarlet letter. He brushed the negative news away and stared at his book, "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them". A smile sketched its way across his face and his mood significantly lightened with his next idea.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>          Wouldn't it be the perfect time to drop by his friends in America? He had been meaning to give Tina her copy in person and the girls needed something to smile about in these dark times. Certainly, the women wouldn't mind a spontaneous visit from their distant friend. With the plan decided, Newt snatched his wand from the desk and began to incant spells. He quickly flipped the "muggle-proof" switch on the all too familiar suitcase and left the lid open. Papers and books, trousers and button-ups, socks and shoes, all began to levitate into the vacant case. Once everything was neatly packed away, Newt rapidly jotted down a note to send to the Ministry to notify them on his quick departure. He handed the letter to the owl, popped the window back open, and sent the messenger off. With his absence documented, the wizard left the apartment grinning, suitcase in tow, and simply hoped the wand permit officers wouldn't give him a hard time.</span>
