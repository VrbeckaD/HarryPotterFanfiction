"We can't keep meeting like this, Potter."</p><p>Harry said, "I know, but we can't exactly tell our wives about us."</p><p>Draco frowned. "That's the thing though, there's not an us. I want there to be more than anything, but there's not."</p><p>Harry told him, "There is an us, Malfoy. You're just too scared to admit it."</p><p>Draco smirked. "Me scared, Potter? Never."</p><p>Harry asked, "Then why haven't you said a word to Astoria?"</p><p>Draco muttered, "I've been meaning to."</p><p>Harry smiled. "If I tell Ginny, then you have to tell Astoria."</p><p>Draco chuckled. "You'll never tell Ginny though, but deal."</p><p>Harry reassured him, "If I have to face Ginny's wrath just to be with you, then I'll do it. I'd do anything for you, Malfoy."</p><p>Draco coughed. "Too cheesy, but I get what you're saying."</p></div>
