    <p>It was a dreary day out, the kind where the sky was as grey as the pavement, and the sun was nothing but a faint glow.  The air was still and bitter cold, and Draco shivered under his padded coat.  His lunch hour was almost up, and he was on his way back to the bookstore when there was a loud <i>pop!</i> and he walked straight into someone.<br/>
<br/>
“Watch it!” Draco snapped, stepping back, but he froze when he saw who was blocking his way.<br/>
<br/>
“Er, sorry,” Harry-bloody-Potter muttered distractedly, looking around in confusion.  His unruly black hair was worse than ever, like he’d been running his hands through it all morning, and his lightening-shaped scar was peeking out from behind his fringe.  He was wearing auror robes, with the Ministry of Magic’s seal on the front, looking distinctly non-muggle.  Judging by the increasing amount of stares and whispers around them, the muggles thought so too.  Draco couldn’t believe the nerve of this man.<br/>
<br/>
“Potter, you idiot,” Draco hissed, dragging him by the lapels into a side alley.  “You just apparated onto a muggle street!”<br/>
<br/>
“Malfoy?” Potter said in surprise, and Draco rolled his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, Potter, I’m the one you rudely apparated into, now what the hell are you doing?”<br/>
<br/>
Potter blinked a few times behind his round glasses, looking even more like an idiot than usual.  “Malfoy,” he repeated stupidly, “Why are you here?”<br/>
<br/>
“For Merlin’s sake, Potter,” Draco grumbled, shoving away from the offending man.  “Never mind.  I don’t want to know.”  With that, he turned and strode away, back towards the shop.<br/>
<br/>
“Malfoy, wait!” Potter called out, running to catch up.<br/>
<br/>
Draco pivoted on his heel to face the clueless auror again, and Potter had to pull up short so that he wouldn’t run into him.  “What?” the blonde demanded.<br/>
<br/>
The other man looked rather taken aback by Draco’s harsh tone.  “Er,” he said, ducking his head a bit, “Where am I, exactly?”<br/>
<br/>
Draco stared at him in disbelief.  “Potter, are you absolutely mad?  You apparated here.”<br/>
<br/>
The-Boy-Who-Lived-To-Annoy-Draco-Malfoy shrugged slightly as he ran a hand through his already impossibly messy hair.  Draco wanted to swat his hand away, on behalf of all hairstylists.  “Well,” Potter started awkwardly, “I didn’t exactly apparate.”  He then held up a small antique key, rusted and attached to a thin cord.  Draco awaited elaboration, but Potter didn’t seem obliged to go on.<br/>
<br/>
“Is that supposed to mean something to me?” he sighed, crossing his arms.  It really was quite cold and he longed for the cozy warmth of the bookstore.<br/>
<br/>
The hint of a blush crept onto Potter’s cheeks, but Draco didn’t know if that was from the cold or embarrassment.  “Er, right, I mean, this is a portkey,” he clarified hastily.  “Only, I didn’t know that until….”<br/>
<br/>
“Until you ended up here?” Draco finished, smirking a little.  “Aren’t you an auror, Potter?  Don’t you know how to detect these things?”<br/>
<br/>
“Alright, alright, laugh it up,” Potter sighed, and Draco was surprised at how lighthearted he sounded.  If they were back in school, this exchange would’ve been enough to start a fight.  With a start, Draco realized just how long it had been since they’d last seen each other.  It had been a little over three years since Draco’s trial, where Potter had spoken in his defense and was instrumental in getting Draco and his mother greatly reduced sentences.  He only had to serve one year’s house arrest — which turned into eight months for good behavior — and his mother had only served two years house arrest — surprisingly without good behavior.  Mother was always used to having her way, and it seemed house arrest didn’t suit her very well.  Draco was only glad she didn’t get a worse punishment for trying to leave the manor grounds as much as she did.<br/>
<br/>
When Draco was released, his mother insisted he get a position at the Ministry, but Draco knew that wasn’t going to happen.  For one, no sane person in the magical community would hire an ex-Death Eater.  But for another, Draco didn’t want to go back to how things were before, where the Malfoys were both feared and hated, and only a very few members of society thought them respectable.  He wanted to be invisible, as if he was wearing Potter’s famous cloak, and he wanted to do something quiet, peaceful.  It was pure luck he found The Dragon’s Lair on a rainy day about a month after his release.  He’d been wondering muggle streets, looking for something to catch his eye.  The name made him pause.  It was almost dusk, and he’d promised to have dinner with mother, but he couldn’t resist walking into the shop.  It was a dimly-lit bookstore, with dust on every surface, and a tiny old woman sitting behind her desk.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh hello dear,” she said in a squeaky voice that sounded as unused as the books around her.  “I’m closing up in a minute, but please look around if you like.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thank you,” Draco said politely.  He glanced around the tiny shop, and chose an aisle at random, walking down it in wonder.  There were so many books, old books, just sitting there around him — so many words, so much knowledge — and the realization of that filled him with awe.  He could learn so much, about muggle culture, muggle religion, muggle everything, and it could push out all the unwanted thoughts, the dark memories that he tried so hard to suppress.  Draco walked back to the woman’s desk, knowing he would have to leave soon anyway.  She was still there, inspecting a giant encyclopedia from the 1800s.  It was in French.<br/>
<br/>
“Pardon me, ma’am,” Draco said, and the old woman looked up at him with a wan smile.  “Do you mind me asking why this bookstore is called The Dragon’s Lair?”<br/>
<br/>
“Ah,” said the old woman, “an excellent query.  You’re familiar with the phrase ‘Here be dragons’?”  She looked at him expectantly.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m afraid not,” Draco said.  In all honesty, it was a common sign in the wizarding world for dragon-infested areas, but in a muggle context Draco was unsure.<br/>
<br/>
“Well,” the woman went on as if she had expected as much, “in olden times, when the first maps were being created, people hadn’t explored everywhere yet.  And so, in the places they hadn’t explored, they would draw sea serpents and lizard-monsters with the caption ‘Here be dragons’ to indicate the unknown.  You see?”<br/>
<br/>
“Alright,” Draco muttered, thinking they had probably labeled the maps correctly.<br/>
<br/>
“All of these books here,” she went on, “contain so much knowledge that most people are unaware of.  To so many people, these books are uncharted territory.  So until you open a book and read it, it could be anything.”<br/>
<br/>
“Here be dragons,” Draco replied, grinning.<br/>
<br/>
The woman smiled back.  “Precisely.”  She then stood, taking out a keychain, and Draco felt rather cold with the thought of having to leave the quaint bookstore.<br/>
<br/>
“Do you need any help?” Draco asked suddenly, and the old woman raised her eyebrows in surprise.  “I mean, do you need an assistant, to help around the shop?”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m afraid,” she said kindly, patting his hand, “I can’t afford to take anyone on, dear.”<br/>
<br/>
“You wouldn’t have to pay me,” he blurted, a little too desperately.<br/>
<br/>
She looked him over appraisingly, like she was trying to see if he was up to something.  It reminded him of Professor McGonagall.  Finally, the woman offered her hand with a warm smile.  Draco took it gratefully.  “You may call me Dr. Finch.”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re a doctor?” Malfoy asked, feeling thrown.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Finch winked charmingly.  “Not that kind of doctor.”  She released his hand.  “And you are?”<br/>
<br/>
“Draco Malfoy,” he told her, and her eyebrows raised but she didn’t comment.  “Not a doctor,” he added with a wink of his own.<br/>
<br/>
“Wait, if this is a muggle street,” Potter said loudly, rudely interrupting Draco’s thoughts, “what are you doing here?”<br/>
<br/>
Draco frowned at him, barely managing not to glare.  “I work here,” he said coolly.<br/>
<br/>
Potter raised his eyebrows stupidly.  “Really?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes,” the blonde growled, and Potter seemed to finally realize how offensive he was being, because he quickly amended, “Well, that’s…good.  Great, I mean.  Great for you.”<br/>
<br/>
Rolling his eyes again, Draco made to leave, but Potter reached out and grabbed his arm.  “Malfoy,” he said, sounding embarrassed — as he should be.<br/>
<br/>
“What?” Draco exclaimed, turning to face him again and brushing off his hand.<br/>
<br/>
Potter blushed for sure this time.  “I, er, don’t have my wand with me.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco gaped at him.<br/>
<br/>
“And this portkey is dead now,” Potter added sheepishly.<br/>
<br/>
It was all Draco could do not to roll his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
“And…I’m a bit lost.”<br/>
<br/>
“Potter,” Draco stressed, “you’re an <i>auror</i>.  You’re supposed to be prepared for things like this.”<br/>
<br/>
The “auror” shrugged helplessly.<br/>
<br/>
“Fine,” Draco said in annoyance, “I’ll get you a map.  Do you have any money on you?”<br/>
<br/>
Potter grimaced.<br/>
<br/>
“Great,” Draco went on.  “You owe me.”  The moment those words left Draco’s mouth he regretted them fiercely.  No one owed Draco anything, not after the war.  Especially not the savior of the wizarding world, who had saved him from fiendfyre, and a life in azkaban.  This man, whom Draco had tormented all growing up, owed him nothing.  If anything, Draco should be begging forgiveness at his feet.<br/>
<br/>
Draco bristled at the idea.  A Malfoy never begged, even the pathetic last heir.  Mother would be appalled.<br/>
<br/>
“Thanks,” Potter mumbled, following Draco down the street to The Dragon’s Lair.  When they reached the bookstore, Potter — predictably — snorted.  “You have a —?”<br/>
<br/>
“Lair, yes,” Draco snapped irritably.  “Very funny, Potter.”<br/>
<br/>
The auror paused.  “I only meant,” he backtracked, “is that a coincidence?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes,” Draco said.<br/>
<br/>
Inside, Dr. Finch sat behind her desk as usual, eyeglasses on as she surveyed an old Greek text.  Dr. Finch was a linguist, and she was fluent in eight different spoken languages, as well as several dead languages, including Greek.  She looked up as they came in.  “Draco,” she said warmly, “you’ve brought a friend.”<br/>
<br/>
“Not a friend,” Draco grumbled, but introduced them anyway.  “Potter, this is Dr. Finch, the owner of this wonderful bookstore and the smartest person I’ve ever met.  Dr. Finch, this is Harry Potter, a massive git who likes to wear baggy dresses.”<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Finch’s eyes sparkled at the praise as she held her hand out.  Potter took her hand and shook it, though he looked mildly mortified by the comment about his wizard robes.  “Pleasure to meet you,” Dr. Finch said politely.<br/>
<br/>
“Same,” said the rudest wizard who ever lived, dropping her hand.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Finch was unfazed.  “How can I help you, Mr. Potter?”<br/>
<br/>
To prevent further rudeness, Draco opted to speak for him.  “Do we have any maps, Doctor?  Potter has somehow lost his way.”<br/>
<br/>
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco could see Potter frowning at him.  “Oh yes,” said Dr. Finch, reaching below the counter.  “I just got some yesterday, after those tourists from Germany came in the other day asking for one.  Always good to have some on hand.”<br/>
<br/>
“How much?” Potter apparently felt the need to ask, despite having no money on him.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh,” Dr. Finch said, waving her other hand as she pushed a map toward them across her desk, “on the house, of course.  A friend of Draco’s is a friend of mine.”<br/>
<br/>
“He’s not a friend,” Draco insisted, fishing out a £5 note from his wallet and placing it on her desk.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s good of you to drop by,” she continued merrily to Potter, ignoring Draco’s glare.  “He has so few friends.”<br/>
<br/>
“Back in a moment,” Draco growled, grabbing the map and pushing Potter in front of him to the door.  Once they were outside again, in the freezing cold, Draco glanced up, expecting to see Potter’s stupid smirk, but instead the other man was frowning at him with — Merlin, was that <i>pity</i> in his eyes?  Draco felt anger boiling up inside him as he ripped the map open and jabbed his finger at a spot on Norwood Road.  “We’re here,” he forced out through gritted teeth, and jabbed his finger at a different spot.  “This is the closest entrance to the Ministry.  Now go.”<br/>
<br/>
Before Potter could say a word, Draco shoved the map into his hands and stomped back into The Dragon’s Lair.</p>
