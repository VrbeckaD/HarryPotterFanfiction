    <p>Part 1</p><p>Emma</p><p>
  <em>One</em>
</p><p>When her parents died on that cold Halloween night, Emma had no Muggle relatives to be sent to, no blood magic to protect her from all harm, and she was sent to an orphan home in a grey looking neighborhood just outside of London. She didn’t live in the cupboard under the stairs, but in a tiny room with six other a kids, until she found a family and lost it at lightning speed.</p><p>The story is still the same. She grew up alone, just a lost little girl who doesn’t matter. A girl who stopped believing long ago, until she got her letter and opened a door to a world where she could finally belong.</p><p>People call her the Savior and stare at the scar on her forehead like she is something special. They speak about “the dark one” in quiet, hash voices. They say his soul is tied to a dagger, that is now hidden in an ancient vault. They say she killed him, somehow, when she was just a baby, but you can’t kill darkness. It’s waiting, lurking, looking for a crack to slip through.</p><p>Emma thinks it must be some kind of mistake, she can’t be anyone's savior. Just Emma. But no one seems to listen. She is mostly just happy to have a bed to sleep in and new clothes to wear and the old castle is not exactly the dream family she hoped for, but it’s everything. It’s home.</p>
