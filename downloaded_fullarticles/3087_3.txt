    <p>Harry has, to put it shortly, been feeling a bit sick of everyone's shit. After the whole ministry debacle, he has now apologized to left and right. Now, that normally wouldn’t be a problem! It would even be wonderful! But... it just so happens that this is exactly like the second year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You know Harry, I never believed one bit of The Prophet!”</p>
<p>“I always knew you were telling the truth!”</p>
<p>“Everyone was against you, but I never was. I always believed you!”</p>
<p>“The Prophet is such an awful newspaper, don’t you agree, Harry?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah… okay… sure. I may have tolerated this before, but I am not some impressionable kid with his only desire to be, well, desired. I am NOW an impressionable teenager! Okay all jokes aside, it has been pretty awful.</p>
<p> My mind is crowded with Si-Siri… With Sirius, the crucio, the ministry, The Prophet, the Dursleys, and Voldemort. The public and my friends are all the cherry on top of this Hagrid cake. Yah, my friends… They have been avoiding me. I don’t know why and every time I try and ask Ron, Hermione, Luna, literally ANYONE, all they do is make some excuse and run. So yeah, fuck them too.</p>
<p>So here I am, alone, yet crowded, praised, yet hated, popular, y-</p>
<p>“Mr. Potter!”</p>
<p>… Yet apparently daydreaming in potions. Screw Voldemort, he has nothing on the pure loathing Snape has for me.</p>
<p>“Yes, professor?”</p>
<p>“Good” </p>
<p>Uh oh, I just agreed to my literal death. He probably asked me if I wanted to be dissected for a new potion ingredient. And the bastard is smirking at me! Obviously aware that I had no idea what just happened! I am So Fucked (with capitals!).</p>
<p>“Well then, get on with it you silly boy!”</p>
<p>He said while motioning to the vial of death on his desk. That is not an exaggeration. It literally looks black and has sludge oozing out! But yet again, isn’t that everything in potions?</p>
<p>So I walk to the damn thing, all the while hearing the Gryffindors whispering while casting sympathetic looks at me, the Slytherins snickering and looking like they have just won the house cup, and Snape smirking at me. So if that isn’t reassuring, I don’t know what is. At that moment, I wish I had written a will and completed my bucket list. </p>
<p>I take the damn thing and chug it like it was Firewhiskey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“-ter!”</p>
<p>“Potter!”</p>
<p>“POTTER!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Merlin fucking dammit! We can hear you!!”</p>
<p>I say. Wait… I hadn’t opened my mouth. But the voice sounded like me. And it answered when addressed as Potter? Whatever.</p>
<p>Turning my head I see an exact version of me. Same robes, same hair, same shoes, same everything.</p>
<p>“5 points from Gryffindor for the disrespect! Now class, as you can see, the potion did what it was supposed to do. Mr. Potter now has 6 different personified personalities. This potion lasts for 8 days including the day of the intake.</p>
<p>Great... meaning I can lob all my work and chores on another Potter and go on a vacation.</p>
<p>“Stand up Potter!”</p>
<p>“Which one?” <br/>“Which one!”<br/> “Which one.”<br/>“Um.. me or uhh?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...This’ll be irritating.</p>
<p>“All of you!”</p>
<p>One of us looked like they’re ready to fight, but seeing as everyone else, excluding one, calmly stood up, he stopped.</p>
<p>“Now which one of you is the main one!” </p>
<p>He could have just asked.</p>
<p>“Me.”</p>
<p>I stepped forward, some of them looked like they were ready to argue, but before they could I interrupted.</p>
<p>“All of you ended up in slightly different areas of the room, but for me, I am exactly where we all passed out.”</p>
<p>One still didn’t look convinced, but the rest looked like they accepted it.</p>
<p>	“Good, find out what the other Potters personalities are.”</p>
<p>Ah yes, he will have to deal with more Potters now.<br/>Well, the task is easy. I will ask a question and see what each of our responses are. I might be able to group all of them into simple personalities, like Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, etcetera. </p>
<p>	“Everyone stand in line. I will ask you a question and you must answer.”</p>
<p>I turn to the first one.</p>
<p>“Which house is the best?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ravenclaw.”</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>“Gryffindor!”</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>“Um, well… all of them are pretty good, but uh, Hufflepuff is nice. I’m- I’m not saying that any other house is not! Ju-</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>“Slytherin.”<br/>Next.</p>
<p>“None. They all are useless with useless people who are all one dimensional and are better off dead or tortured.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peachy. That’s all then. I changed the colour of my robe, and then came up to each one of them and changed theirs.</p>
<p>“Professor Snape.”</p>
<p>He was startled out of his daze. In fact, as was the rest of the class. All looked like they found out that Headmaster Dumbledore was Lord Voldemort. Maybe their brains imploded from the sight of The Golden Boy saying anything other than Gryffindor to that question.</p>
<p>“What!”</p>
<p>“The one in the blue robe will be known as Ravenclaw, in the red is Gryffindor, in the yellow is Hufflepuff, In the green is Slytherin, In the black is Marvolo, I am in the grey and will be known as Tom.</p>
<p>Ravenclaws, Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Slytherins personalities are self-explanatory, Marvolo is evil and uncaring, and lastly, I’m apathetic.”</p>
<p>Coming back from his daze, Professor Snape seemed to catch up with the situation that he now has to handle.</p>
<p>“Right… Potter! To you’re seat!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I stand back to watch the show as they all looked at each other in confusion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Didn’t Tom just say what to call us to avoid this type of confusion?”</p>
<p>“Maybe he’s slow…”</p>
<p>“Of course he is. He made us take this potion.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if you told me everyone in Hogwarts is slow.”</p>
<p>“No one would.”</p>
<p>“I mean…. I like it- um Hogwarts. I like Ho-”</p>
<p>“Shut up Puff, I am this close to A.K.ing you.”</p>
<p>“You’re fingers are together!”</p>
<p>“E-fucking-xactly.”</p>
<p>“Now guys, you know what happens when we kill each other.”</p>
<p>“No.” </p>
<p>“.....”</p>
<p>“I vote the Puff.”</p>
<p>“We need to make necessary sacrifices to understand.”</p>
<p>“Any killing is good in my book.”</p>
<p>“No! Killing is wrong!”</p>
<p>“Wait! You can’t ju-”</p>
<p>The most interesting part is the colour draining from all the student’s face. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“ENOUGH! Tom. take your seat, the others, stand by the wall.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes… This will be interesting.</p>
