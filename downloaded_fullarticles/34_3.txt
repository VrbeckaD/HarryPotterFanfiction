    <p>The last year was most certainly weird. Newt would at least admit to that. But the finer details? Those were buried far away from anyone else’s reach – the truth a dangerous thing to admit in such a time. Right now, that was not Newts' top priority.</p><p><br/>He was sat in a tiny room with four British Aurors asking him to track down the now resurfaced Obscurial boy that everyone thought was a hazard to society. He wanted to roll his eyes, but he knew they didn’t understand the Obscurus because there was no one to educate them – and they were afraid of the unknown. Also, he preferred to stay quiet. Trying to discuss things with the Ministry was always a hassle.</p><p><br/>“I’m afraid that you are not fully comprehending the situation you are in Mr Scamander. This is our last offer.” One of the Aurors said. He and his companions were at a loss at how to get the young magizoologist to co-operate.</p><p><br/>“I understand.” Newt glanced around the table, avoiding his brothers gaze more than he normally would. “But I cannot. He is a boy, not a monster.”</p><p><br/>They all started talking at once, spewing nonsense reasons one after the other. Newt stared at the table, a silent anger burning through him. Nothing changes with the government. Nothing had changed from all those years ago. Just because they didn’t ask him to care for the boy before they slaughtered him meant nothing.</p><p><br/>Realising the room had gone quiet, Newt raised his gaze ever-so slightly. They were all looking at him with disapproval, their high statue confidence and naturally stoic state increasing the expression. This time, all Newt could feel was annoyance at the belittling action, fuelling an already lit fire. But these feelings were quickly extinguished as a weight suddenly appeared in his coats pocket, excitement tingling his fingers as he stuck his hand in and received a familiar bite.</p><p><br/>Abruptly, Newt rose from his seat, fast steps to the door. “Quite sorry. Excuse me.” And with that he ignored whatever else the men had to say as he was quickly in the hallway.</p><p><br/>His brother did stop him momentarily. Went on about picking sides and how even his neutral no-violence little brother needed to pick one. Lest he be seen as an enemy. Newt didn’t respond. He could’ve lied, but there are some days where even he didn’t want to blatantly lie to his own brother.</p><p><br/>Theseus sighed, pulling his brother in for an awkward hug that was not returned. “They’re watching you.”</p><p><br/>Newt nodded before spinning on his heels and practically hightailing it out of the building. If the British Ministry had more fancy charms, he would have been able to apparate straight home. But alas, he had to make his way through the streets filled with rushing muggles and his terrible stalker. Snickering to himself quietly, he felt obligated to let the Ministry know of their employees' terrible skills. He would of course leave out a few of the tricks he had done, but that was just another thing for him to brush under the rug and away from their prying noses.</p><p><br/>Thankfully, there was no one else waiting behind a corner.</p><p><br/>It wouldn’t be him they would have to deal with though, it would be his overprotective little beast that had struggled its way out of his coat pocket as he neared closer to home.</p><p><br/>As if it had become a nightly routine, Newt entered his house to find the baby Nifflers running about. Without much thought, he quickly gathered them up before heading into his ever-growing basement.</p><p><br/>“Bunty! The baby Nifflers got out again!” Newt shouted as he sprinted down the many steps. He paused only for a moment when his helper came into view with a bandaged finger. Convincing all of his creatures in his arms to go back to their own habitats, he began going about the duties that needed to be completed. “I thought I told you to leave the Kelpie to me?”</p><p><br/>She muttered out a reply. The same one every time she got herself hurt when trying to apply more ointment to the Kelpie.</p><p><br/>“You can clock off now.”</p><p><br/>“But –”</p><p><br/>“It's quite alright.” Newt said, looking over his shoulder as he moved onto the next enclosure.</p><p><br/>Unwillingly, Bunty did as was told and headed off, leaving Newt to enjoy time with his mismatched family. Happy with everyone’s health, Newt turned his attention to the final thing on his list – the Kelpie.</p><p><br/>Shrugging off his coat and vest, Newt brought out his wand and prepared himself. Within seconds of delving into the water, he was being spun in circles from the Kelpies fast pace. With much trust in his beloved creature, he held out his hand before allowing himself to be pulled along. A smile was brought to his face as the Kelpie let off steam, jumping in and out of the water, using every inch of the large enclosure.</p><p><br/>With the beast at ease, he heaved himself on to solid ground, wishing over a bucket of food. Gently, he applied the ointment.</p><p><br/>As the Kelpie retreated back into the waters depths, Newt was alerted of new guest as he saw the baby Nifflers out yet again – this time trying to carry a silver pocket watch between the three of them.</p><p> </p><p>Politely plucking it from them, he made his way to his little shack of organised mess. He dried himself off as he greeted the two creatures that people were afraid of – and actually had a reason to be this time.<br/>The Swooping Evil and a Chupacabra hatchling. The latter instantly became energetic at the sight of Newt.</p><p> </p><p>Newt felt eyes follow his every movement, but he ignored it. He had a point to make with this person, and since it was so hard to make them listen sometimes, he opted for the silent treatment.<br/>That was until his guest began to make ruckus in his workspace on purpose.</p><p>"Please stop.” Newt could feel the satisfaction radiate from his guest as he said those words.</p><p> </p><p>“But if it is what gets your attention, why would I stop?”</p><p> </p><p>Sighing, Newt spun around to face the man, arms crossed over his chest. He gave the man a stern look as he spoke. “I have asked you to stop sending Antonio into my coat pocket. It is not good for him.” Although his gaze was more to the man’s left ear, he saw the small flash of regret before it was overtaken by the usual cockiness that usually resided there.</p><p> </p><p>“And what shall you do about it then, hmm? Give me the cold shoulder for the week? We both know how that’ll go, my dear Newton.” The man closed the small distance between them as he spoke, his thin lips turned upward at the corners.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m serious Gellert.”</p><p><br/>The dark wizard took a step back, grasping one of Newts’ hands in his own, pressing a ghost like kiss to it. He released it, standing upright once again. “Of course, Liebling.” He left the shack, wondering over to the stairs that led to the rest of the house. “I have some important news to discuss. About that Obscurus boy from New York.”</p><p><br/>Newt let out a strained laugh. “The Ministry wanted me to kill him. Me if all people!” He shook his head, daring a glance into the dark wizard’s eyes to find them shining with amusement. “What do you know?”</p><p><br/>Their time to discuss details in person crumbled away in those mere seconds it took for Newt to ask his question. Noise upstairs put Newt on edge, increasing when he decided the intruders to be human. Pulling out his wand, he warily climbed the stairs, peeking his head into the room to find two people quietly whispering about his now broken vase. Packing his wand away, he turned to find Gellert staring, waiting.</p><p><br/>“I’ll send someone within the next few days with information. For now, take care mein Liebling.”</p><p><br/>Always one for the dramatics, Newt quietly laughed at his own thought as Gellert apparated, leaving behind a tiny tornado of blue flames.</p><p><br/>Sighing, Newt rushed into his kitchen area, seeing that his new guests had somehow managed to put a hole in his floor with their briefcase.</p><p><br/>“Newt, honey!! It’s so good to see you!”</p><p><br/>Newt just smiled.</p><p>- - - - - -</p><p>“Oh honey, you must’ve been practicing a lot this year! I can’t even get a glimpse of your thoughts.” Queenie rambled on, trying to ignore the very obvious question that Newt had been so polite in not saying directly. “That’s a real big improvement.”</p><p><br/>Newt was sat at the other end of his small table as he watched Queenie take care of the mindless potato that he knew as Jacob. Frowning slightly, Newt could see the charm glinting the air around his friend.<br/>“Uh, Queenie?” Newt started, looking more so to the wall right behind them instead of them. “Did you... You know he won’t be happy when he wakes up.”</p><p><br/>“What do you mean wakes up? Don’t be silly! He's just happy to be here! Happy to be getting married." Standing, Newt drew his wand, aiming it at a bow joking Jacob. “Then you won’t mind.” He didn’t wait for a reply. Maybe if he had things would have gone slightly better for the two Americans. Instead, they had a fight in the streets, Queenie running off to find her sister. This left Jacob confused and hurt.</p><p><br/>“I didn’t mean it. I never mean it.” Jacob mumbled out sadly. “Wait, where am I?”</p><p><br/>“London.”</p><p><br/>Jacob slapped his leg much too hard. “I’ve always wanted to come here.”</p><p><br/>Shockingly, Jacob remembered everything and couldn’t wait to see Newts’ creatures.</p><p><br/>With a new passion running though his veins, Newt led his old friend through the cellar, making sure to keep the Chupacabra away.</p>
