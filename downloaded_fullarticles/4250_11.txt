  <strong>This is the Appendix page that will have the lists of the character's stats and the items. (I may have overdone Abaddon's abilities a bit, but he does need to be on par with the Overlord equivalent of at least a level 60 when combining his wizard spells and New World spells, which is much more powerful than just one magic or the other.</strong>

<p>-Draconic Scales <strong>[Natural Trait]<br/></strong>Due to naturally forming dragon scales upon his body, Abaddon's skin cannot be broken by any weapon <strong>[Tier V] </strong>and below when the part of his body that is hit is in it's demon forme.</p>
<p>-Magical Fusion <strong>[Natural Trait]</strong><br/>Can create new spells by combining attacks from both aspects of the hybrid. If done so, the power of the spell acts as if the user is at the average level of both sides of hybrid.</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Wizarding Spells:</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Expelliarmus - Disarm the opponent. (Min. Level 1)</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bombarda - Create an explosion (Min. Level 5)</strong>
</p>

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Diffindo - Fire an invisible blade that dissipates after hitting a solid object.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Avada Kedavra - The Killing Spell. When the target is hit, they die. It separates their soul from their body, forcing an early death. It is unlike the dementors, as they simply remove it from the body, which leaves the body alive in a soulless state. This rips it forcefully from the body, stopping all bodily functions. (No Min. Level, it only requires a large amount of magical power and the caster needs to actually intend to kill the victim)</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Imperio - Absolute Control Spell. Will take over the mind of the victim, putting the caster in control. It can be broken by the victim if their mind is strong enough, but very few are able to. Occlumency is the best bet to prevent it from affecting the victim. (No Min. Level, just the will to keep the victim in control and the magical strength to keep it running)</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Crucio - Torture Spell. It causes the victim to feel as much damage as they can possibly feel, and can be held for as long as the caster wishes. The amount of pain felt is equal to the amount of hate towards the victim. (No Min. Level, it requires the magical strength to use the spell, and pure hatred towards the victim and the determination to cause them pain)</strong>
