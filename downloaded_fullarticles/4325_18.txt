    <p align="justify">Most children believe in magic, dragons and knights, princesses and fairies, and Dean Thomas was no different; however, when a lady came up to his front door and told him he was a wizard and was going to be learning magic in a boarding school in the middle of nowhere, he was absolutely sure she was lying. There was no way he was a wizard, sure, sometimes things happened around him, things he couldn’t quite explain, but there was no way he was a wizard. The woman explained that sometimes wizards could be born out of non magical parents, muggles she called them, but Mrs. Thomas let her know that there was no way of knowing whether Dean’s father was a wizard or not because he had left them before Dean could even form a memory of him, she wasn’t sure but she believed that he could have also been a wizard.</p><p align="justify">Soon enough summer was over and Dean found himself in Diagon Alley with his parents, searching for all kinds of school supplies he would need, wand, robes, parchment, quills, Dean had never been particularly fond of school but he was sure he was going to love it at Hogwarts. Platform nine and three quarters was the most terrifying thing out of everything so far, he was told he just had to run towards the pillar and everything would be alright. Dean looked up to his parents and noticed a worried expression on their faces, they weren’t to sure about running head first into a brick wall either. Together, they held the trolley tightly and started to run, Dean braced himself for the inevitable crash, but it never came, when he opened his eyes he couldn’t believe what he saw, a bright red train with the words Hogwarts Express brightly written on it.</p><p align="justify">Up until now he hadn’t been able to believe any of it, he was going to wake up and he would be normal again, but no, it was real. He turned back to his mum and hugged her tightly. “Take care, my love” she whispered as she leaned down to kiss his forehead, tears threatening to spill. “I’m sure you’ll do amazing, son” his dad, well step-dad, said to him and pulled him into an embrace.</p><p align="justify">“I love you, and I promise I’ll write, I’ll miss you so much” Dean said one last time before he ran up to the train. It would be his first time away from home and while he would really miss his family, the promise of what was to come was enough for him to get on the train with a big smile on his face.</p><p align="justify">Dean walked along the train trying to find a cabin that wasn’t full, it was quite a bit of time before he found one. Inside were two twin girls who introduced themselves as Padma and Parvati, a blonde called Lavender, a boy, who he later learned was also muggle-born, named Justin and a very Irish boy who went by the name of Seamus.</p><p align="justify">“I’m Dean” he said, after everyone had finished introducing themselves, and took a seat next to the Irish boy. “I wonder what house we’ll be in” Parvati said, once everyone had settled in. “What do you mean?” Dean asked. Justin seemed equally confused, but the twins and Lavender gave him an odd look.</p><p align="justify">It was Seamus that finally answered, seemingly unbothered by his lack of understanding. “Ya see, Hogwarts is divided into four houses, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin. Ya get sorted according to what you are: brave, smart, loyal or ambitious.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh” was all Dean managed to choke out before the loud cries of anything from the trolley overtook and suddenly everyone was getting up and buying all sorts of sweets from the trolley. Dean didn’t think to bring money with him on the trolley, he barely even understood the currency conversion from pounds to galleons. Seamus, on the other hand, bought one of almost every sweet there was. Dean was a little bit bummed at not being able to eat any new wizard candy, but before he could dwell on it too much, Seamus extended his arm and with a smile on his face handed him a chocolate frog. "What's mine is yours" Seamus said. Dean had a feeling Seamus was going to be a really good friend.</p><p align="justify">The train ride to Hogwarts was particularly long, and before he had the chance to process everything he was already getting off the train. A very large man, almost a giant thought Dean, came up to and asked the first year students to follow him. The girls and Justin had hurried off after the giant Hagrid, so Dean and Seamus were left to trail behind them.</p><p align="justify">Once they got to the edge of the lake Hagrid instructed them to get on the boats, so they did. At the front of theirs was a ginger boy who introduced himself as Ron and next to him a blue eyed boy named Harry, behind them was a Neville, the boy who had come into their compartment looking for his lost frog.</p><p align="justify">Once they got to the castle, Dean felt a little overwhelmed and instinctively grabbed Seamus’s hand, they weren’t that close and Seamus could’ve just pulled his hand away, however he looked over and Dean and gave his hand a squeeze. They kept their hands linked until a teacher McGonagall received them and explained what Seamus had told him on the train. Harry, Ron and Neville were placed in Gryffindor with him and Seamus, as where Parvati and Lavender, but Padma was sorted into Ravenclaw and Justin into Hufflepuff.</p><p align="justify">Dinner was like nothing Dean had ever experienced, candles floating in the ceiling, goblets refilling themselves and food that never ran out. It was magical. Soon after, the prefect, another ginger boy who Dean was pretty certain was related to Ron in some form, led them all to the Gryffindor common room.</p><p align="justify">“Girls to the left, boys to the right” the prefect told them pointing to each stairwell, he kept talking about the rules but Dean felt the all energy he had slowly fade away. He was ready to go to bed and sleep for a week. “And don’t forget, you’re lessons start tomorrow” was the last thing the prefect said before all five Gryffindor boys were led into their room. Five beds placed equidistantly from one another with their trunks at the foot of it. Dean was glad to notice that his and Seamus’s beds were right next to each other. All five boys ran over to their beds, Harry, Ron and Seamus plopped on top of theirs while he and Neville opted to start unpacking before messing up their beds. Dean took out his West Ham poster and put it up on the wall right above his head.</p><p align="justify">“What’s that?” Seamus asked him from where he was laying on the bed “It’s my favourite football team” he explained. “What’s football?” Seamus asked him with a slight frown on his face, but before he could answer Ron was in his space “Why isn’t it moving?”</p><p align="justify">“Um because it’s not a magical poster?” Dean explained, though it sounded more like a question than an actual answer. Ron, however, just went up and started poking the poster move, move, move he said as if it would actually make the poster move. “Oi, Ron quit it” Harry admonished Ron. “I was raised a muggle as well” he told Dean, and he was so relieved. Seamus was great, but Ron and Neville were both pureblood and while they were really nice people, it was comforting to know that someone else like him was there.</p><p align="justify">Navigating around Hogwarts was much more complicated than Dean had expected, he didn’t like being late for class, but somehow a staircase was always changing and every corridor looked the same. Fortunately, Seamus was always by his side, one time on their way to class, the stairs decided to change path while they were still on it. The violent movement almost sent Seamus flying down the stairs, but Dean grabbed his hand and pulled him up before he could fall. “Thanks mate” Seamus said with a smile, and they didn’t let go of each other until they arrived to their Potions class. Somehow it became a thing, they wouldn’t always do it, but if the corridor was empty or if they were feeling scared or unsure, they just held hands.</p><p align="justify">It didn’t take long for Dean to realise that Seamus had a proclivity for blowing things up, at first it was the cauldron in Potions class, then the feather during professor Flitwick’s class, then it was the goblet during dinner, Dean had been to the Hospital Wing so many times he had lost count, every time though, he held Seamus’s hand while Madam Pomfrey regrew Seamus’s eyebrows and applied cream to his slightly singed faced.</p><p align="justify">“Back again, Mr Finnigan?” came Madam Pomfrey’s voice when she saw Dean leading Seamus into the infirmary and making sit down on a bed. Madam Pomfrey went to her medical cupboard and took out some anti burn cream and some regrowth potion. At this point, she should let Finnigan learn his lesson and regrow his burnt eyebrows on his own, but one look at the eleven year old kids holding hands and smiling at each other warmed her heart. With a wet cloth she cleaned the soot of Seamus’s face and made him drink the regrowth potion. “I imagine it would be easier for you to keep this instead of having to come here every time you blow something up, Mr Finningan” Madam Pomfrey said poignantly and handed over the small jar of cream over to Seamus.</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t until the Hallowe’en feast that they actually held hands in front of everyone else, it wasn’t on purpose, it was an instinctual reaction. Professor Quirrel had barged into the hall yelling about a troll, everyone started screaming and Seamus reached for Dean’s hand. Dumbledore had told them to calm down and follow their prefects back to their common rooms, and it wasn’t till they were safely back in their dormitory that they realised that they had held hands all they way there. Dean noticed that no one really cared, two boys holding hands wasn’t really common in the muggle world, but here he supposed people were a little more preoccupied with Harry and Ron saving Hermione from the troll.</p><p align="justify">As it turned out, Harry joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team so he and Seamus went with Neville, Ron and Hermione to cheer him on. Halfway through the match Harry’s broom went wild, causing him to very nearly fall. Dean wasn’t sure this was an appropriate game for children to be playing but Harry managed to regain control and Seamus was cheering him on very loudly in a very Seamus fashion. Dean could only smile as he looked as his friend and cheered along with him.</p><p align="justify">The rest of the year progressed without anymore incidents, well Seamus kept blowing things up and Dean kept going with him to the infirmary, but soon enough the year was coming to an end and Christmas was upon them. Dean was excited to see his parents and sisters, he missed them so much, but he got a weird feeling in the pit of his stomach at the idea of not seeing Seamus for an entire month. They hadn’t known each other that long, but still he felt as if they had been friends for all their lives.</p><p align="justify">Dean hugged Seamus one last time and headed over to his family who were waiting on the other side of the platform. Seamus was going to Ireland for Christmas but they promised to write to each other a lot.</p><p align="justify">“So, tell us, how was this magic school? Did you make a lot friends? Are you paying attention in class? Are you liking?” Mrs Thomas inquired, asking one question after the other. Mr Thomas on the other hand just held his son close.</p><p align="justify">“One question at a time mum” Dean said with a chuckle “Hogwarts is amazing, I absolutely love it! I have made a lot of friends, I’m in Gryffindor and so is Harry, Ron, Neville and Seamus” He said that last one with a small smile on his face. “And I’m doing great mum, Potions is not that fun, but I’m really good at Charms!”</p><p align="justify">“I’m proud of you Dean, but what exactly is a Gryffindor?” Mr Thomas asked. And Dean launched into a detailed explanation of the Hogwarts houses and the classes he was taking, he kept talking all the way home.</p><p align="justify">The Thomases were quite a large family with Dean being the oldest and having four younger sister, the house was never quiet. When Dean had been told about his magical heritage, it had been made very clear the dangers of exposing the wizarding world, so his parents had made the decision to not tell his sisters until they were old enough to be able to keep it a secret. So they, along with the rest of his extended family, thought that Dean had wanted to go to a boarding school in Scotland, so all magical conversation ended the second they went through the door.</p><p align="justify">Dean was treated by two of his sisters assaulting him in a bear hug, Samantha, at nine years of age was the eldest of the girls, followed by Amelia who was eight, Jess who was four and little Mary who was only a year old. Dean knew his biological father had left way before his first birthday, his mother never liked to lie about it, however John had made sure he knew he was just as much his son as Sam his daughter.</p><p align="justify">All in all Christmas was Dean’s favourite holiday, so he was very sad when the time came to head back to school. He had asked his mother a week before to take him shopping, he wanted to bring something back for Seamus, he couldn’t actually buy something before Christmas, because he was eleven and he couldn’t just leave Hogwarts whenever he he wished. It had taken a while, but finally after hours of wondering around London looking for something for Seamus, he came across a little wooden box, four-leafed clovers carved into the wood and coated with the most beautiful varnish finish. His mum was confused about his choice, but purchased it for him anyway. He ran up his room and took out his sketch book, he tore out a piece of paper and cut it into small pieces. On each one he drew a different picture, one where Seamus blew up a feather, another one with a melted cauldron, one where they were cheering for Harry at the first Quidditch match, one with all the Gryffindor boys sitting on a boat, drawing after drawing, mostly outlines of his favourite moments with Seamus, and finally he drew holding hands, but he couldn’t make himself put that in the box, so he folded it up and left it in his drawer.</p><p align="justify">With Seamus’s gift stored safely in his trunk, Dean joined his parents downstairs so they could head to King’s Cross together. It wasn’t that bad for Dean because he lived in London, however, he could imagine Seamus having to carry down his trunk all the way from Ireland to London. Crossing Platform 9 and 3/4 was not as terrifying this time, but he still felt the slight fear that it was all a dream and it would all come crashing down the moment he hit the wall. Seeing Seamus for the first time in a month brought the feeling of butterflies in his tummy, it was weird, Dean had had friends all his life, but none made him feel like this, it’s probably what having a best friend felt like.</p><p align="justify">Leaving his parents trailing behind him, Dean ran towards the tiny Irish boy. Seamus saw him and ran to meet him half way, they embraced for longer than was probably normal but they didn’t really care. Mrs Finnigan and Mrs Thomas slowly made their way towards their tangled sons lugging the trunks with them, Mr Thomas helping with Dean’s. “Mam, this is Dean, he’s my best friend” Seamus said, pulling back from the hug.</p><p align="justify">“Mum, dad, this is Seamus” Dean introduced him to his parents. “It’s lovely to meet you, Seamus, Dean’s done nothing but talk about you for the past month” Mrs Thomas said with a huge grin, while Mr Thomas just smiled. “I can tell you Seamus has been the same” Mrs Finnigan added with a thick Irish accent.</p><p align="justify">They both said goodbye to their parents, who they could tell were going to keep chatting after they left, and got onto the train back to Hogwarts. Apparently, Ron and Harry had stayed in Hogwarts so Hermione and Neville came to sit with them, and they were later joined by Justin and a Slytherin girl, Tracey Davis. “I love me family, I really do, but I could do without my cousin Fergus” Seamus said. “I’m really glad I went home, I’ve really missed my parents, and it’s only just us three” Hermione piped in. “You’re so lucky, my mum is a witch, but my dad is a muggle, so family reunions are so difficult” Tracey said, she and Justin had become really good friends, after they had gotten paired together in their charms class. At first he had thought the Slytherin students weren’t that nice, but now he was starting to believe it was just Harry’s weird rivalry with Malfoy and his crew.</p><p align="justify">The rest of the train ride to Hogwarts was spent in amicable chatter, but once they got to Hogwarts Dean raced Seamus up to their dorm. Fortunately, Harry and Ron where no where to be found and Neville got caught up talking to Justin and Tracey and probably wasn’t going to be around for a while. Dean took out the present he had gotten for Seamus and carefully unwrapped the cloth he had used to protect it.</p><p align="justify">“I know Christmas is over, but I saw this in the shop the other day and thought of you” Dean said, trying really hard to hide his blush. He handed over the box and Seamus looked at it in awe. “Dean you really didn’t have to do this, but it is beautiful. Thank you” Seamus didn’t open the box, instead he placed it gently on his bed and turned to open his trunk.</p><p align="justify">“Merry Christmas, Dean” Seamus said and handed over a sloppily wrapped present. Dean smiled and carefully unwrapped it to reveal a sketch pad. “It’s enchanted,” Seamus informed him “anything you draw will move, kind of like the posters”. Inside however, was a badly drawn stick figure rendition of Dean and Seamus, holding hands. The stick figures waved at him and Dean was unable to hide his smile.</p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Shay, this is perfect” Dean said and hugged his friend. “Merry Christmas.”</p><p align="justify">Surprisingly, they rest of the school year progressed pretty much like the first half of it, Seamus kept blowing up anything in front of him, especially in potions class, they went to all the Quidditch matches where Gryffindor was playing, they spent every moment possible together. Everything was going great, Harry, Ron and Hermione kept losing them points every so often and Seamus would get annoyed by it but Dean wasn’t particularly competitive, nor was he very invested in winning the house cup.</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t until the end of the year that things went all wrong, on the morning of one of the last days, Dean and Seamus woke up to find all three of their roommates missing, they looked at each other and ran down to the common room. On the floor, completely petrified, was Neville, they panicked and Dean bent down to tell Neville it was going to be all right, while Seamus went to go find McGonagall. “Neville, stay calm, everything is going to be alright” Dean said, panic evident in his voice. “Seamus went to get McGonagall and everything will be all right”</p><p align="justify">“What in heaven’s name is going on?” Professor McGonagall asked “Oh dear” she took her wand out and pointed it at Neville, Dean took a few steps back.</p><p align="justify">“Finite incantatem” a second later Neville was moving again and words just spilled from his mouth “They were sneaking off again, and I didn’t want to lose even more points, but Hermione cursed me and they left professor, I’m sorry”</p><p align="justify">“Longbottom, it’s quite alright, there is nothing to apologize for. But if you are feeling alright, I must go see professor Dumbledore at once” and with that she left the three of them.</p><p align="justify">“Neville are you alright?” Dean asked him “Yeah, I’m sorry I couldn’t stop them though” Neville replied crestfallen.</p><p align="justify">As it turned out, Professor Quirrel, their DADA teacher was actually Voldemort, who Dean learnt was a very dark wizard, and Harry, Ron and Hermione had actually managed to defeat them, and along with Neville’s courageous actions, they managed to win the house cup for the first time in years. Dean was pretty sure Dumbledore had given out way to many points, but hey they had won so he was going to celebrate. Going back home was going to be harder than Dean imaging, somehow he had managed to befriend the best person in the world and he wasn’t sure he wanted to let go yet.</p><p align="justify">The train ride back to London was different, everyone around them was excited for summer, and so was he, but he wasn’t looking forward to not being able to see his best friend for so long, they had also been warned against using magic outside of school. He had spent all his life without magic, but now spending even one day without it seemed impossible. Seamus was as usual talking loudly with everyone else, but hidden beneath their robes, he was securely holding Dean’s hand in his.</p><p align="justify">This would be an interesting summer.</p>
