    <p>Sirius wakes up with a twinge in his arm and a smile on his face. His soulmate tattoo has come in! He's only five and just learning how to read so he doesn’t know what it says but he recognizes a couple of the letters. There's a ‘u’, and another one! As well as a little ‘s’, smaller than the one in his own name, and an ‘i’. There’s only one though, where Sirius has two. He sits on his bed, tracing the name on his wrist.</p><p>He is startled out of his daydreaming when he hears his mum yelling up the stairs. Sirius jumps off the bed and gets dressed, choosing a short sleeve shirt to show off his new mark. He is so proud of the name on his wrist, he can’t wait to show his family.</p><p>Once dressed he runs down the stairs grinning, and makes his way into the dining room.</p><p>“Mum! Dad! Guess what?”</p><p>“What dear?” His mother asks, turning to him with a smile.</p><p>“I got my soul mark!” he says proudly, brandishing his wrist. His father looks up from the paper with a smile.</p><p>“Well, let’s see it then. Who’s the lucky girl who gets to marry our Sirius one day?”</p><p>His parents crowd around, gently grabbing his arm to read the name on his wrist. They study it silently for a while before Sirius breaks in.</p><p>“What’s it say? What’s her name?” He asks excitedly.</p><p>His parents stay silent, their lips curling in disgust.</p><p>“Is it a bad name?” Sirius asks quietly.</p><p>“Yes. It’s a half-blood boy,” the words are spit at him. Sirius doesn’t notice.</p><p>“I get a boy soulmate? He’s going to be my best friend!”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“But he’s my soulmate.” Sirius says his eyes welling up.</p><p>“Stop crying. Blacks do not cry.” His mom waves her wand, summoning a leather cuff, “You will keep this on at all times.” she pulls Sirius roughly towards her, fastening the cuff over his mark. Once it's in place she points her wand at it. “There. Now you can’t take it off.”</p><p>Sirius looks at his mom in horror, pulling at the cuff.</p><p>“Stop that.” When Sirius doesn’t his mom slaps him. It’s the first time.</p>
