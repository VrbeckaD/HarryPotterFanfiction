</p><p> </p><p>The new transfer student was a peculiar case, to say the least, and his arrival right at the end of the school year and his frigid demeanor gave birth to quite the number of rumors, one absurder than the other. Some would say he had been expelled from his previous school, that his offense was so grave that he had to leave his own country; others insisted that he had to be a celebrity in disguise.</p><p>Tom, on the other hand, knew that the boy's secret had to run far deeper than his schoolmates' vapid gossiping, for the very day he had been tasked to show him around and provide the guidance he required, there had already been discrepancies in his behavior. The boy, who, after a moment of hesitation, had introduced himself as Harry Evans, was oddly familiar with Hogwarts's workings and the castle itself despite his claims of never having been at Hogwarts before.</p><p>For instance, when Tom had been looking for him, so he could show him the way to the Dungeons, he had found Evans already waiting at the Common Room entrance, asking for the password with an annoyed scowl on his face. According to Avery and Malfoy, whom Tom had tasked to tail him whenever they could, Evans hadn't held in his tracks or taken a wrong turn a single time when he had headed to the Dungeons.</p><p>What confounded and irked Tom even more was Evans's apparent acquaintanceship with Dumbledore, how more often than not, he disappeared in Tom's most despised teacher's office after lunch or his afternoon classes, and he was so careful to not be tracked by anyone, which made his ventures to Dumbledore's office even more suspicious.</p><p>And then, there was his immediate and intense dislike of Tom. He hadn't even introduced himself when Evans had already glared at him with pure, unadulterated hatred and the subtlest hints of fear Evans appeared to be so desperate to conceal with even more hatred. Tom, however, was a predator, and once he could detect such subtle hints, he would latch onto them and, after uncovering their root and nourishing it, exploit them to his own benefit. He simply needed to find out just what it was about him that frightened Evans so.</p><p><em>'He can't have possibly heard about the Chamber or that rotten orphanage, so what else could it be...?' </em>Tom mused, already planning to keep an even closer eye on Evans. There was always the possibility of Evans's secret being something completely minor, yet Tom wasn't one to give a hostage to fortune – especially when Dumbledore himself appeared to already be deeply involved.</p><p>But first, he needed to overcome Evans's immense hatred with the right amount of wit and pleasantries, and so, he headed him off right after Potions.</p><p>“Good afternoon, Harry.”</p><p>“What do you want, Riddle?” Evans asked, eying him suspiciously.</p><p>“It has come to my attention that Potions is your weakest subject. Hence I'd like to offer my help. You see, there are, shall we say, <em>insiders' tips</em> for accomplishing better results. It'd be a pleasure to share them with you.”</p><p>For a moment, Evans seemed to consider his offer, but then, as though he had remembered something, his features hardened and he spat, “It'd be an even greater <em>pleasure</em> if you kept your nose out of my business.”</p><p>“Very well,” Tom said, and his jaw tensed. “But it'd do you well to remember that bad grades are frowned upon in House Slytherin.”</p><p>“And I should care because-?”</p><p>“You should <em>care</em> because the life of a misfit isn't pleasant here at Hogwarts.” There was a subtle threat in his tone, and he could see Evans flinch despite his visible efforts to maintain a neutral expression.</p><p>“Thanks for the warning, then,” Evans said, though his voice was dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>As he walked away, and Tom had confirmed no one looked in his direction, he shot a withering glare at Evans's back. How dare that brat challenge <em>his</em> authority!</p><p>Their following interactions weren't any less disastrous. Whereas Tom attempted to be helpful and pleasant – partly because his mask demanded it, partly in order to learn his secret – Evans continued to be as insolent as humanly possible, and soon, Tom began to suspect he had made it his objective to form cracks in his mask.</p><p>It had to be Dumbledore's doing, for whenever Evans entered and exited the old fool's office, he appeared to have grown more knowledgeable about what irritated and angered him. However, mysterious circumstances aside, a pawn was just a pawn. If Dumbledore wanted to fight their little war by proxy, so could Tom. All he had to do was get a touch more creative in his approaches, and everything would fall into place.</p><p>Therefore, when Evans left Dumbledore's office the next time, Tom was already waiting for him in the hallway.</p><p>“Are you familiar with the term 'Little Red Riding Hood Syndrome'?”</p><p>“No, what's that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“It stems from a Muggle fairy tale told to instil fear of ill-intentioned strangers in children. Its protagonist is a girl who despite her mother's warnings-”</p><p>“I know that fairy tale. Just get to the point,” Evans rudely interrupted him, and Tom had to keep his eye from twitching.</p><p>“The <em>point</em> is, Harry, that due to the wolf acting as the stereotypical villain in various pieces of folklore and fairy tales, the public's perception of the animal <em>itself</em> has been clouded to the point of the wolf being feared almost <em>irrationally</em>. Regardless of facts about his true nature. Or his general harmlessness. In fact, there are no documented wolf attacks on humans.”</p><p>For a moment, Evans seemed to contemplate his words.</p><p>“That's... what are you expecting me to say now?”</p><p>“Nothing in particular. I do wonder, though, how Muggles and wizards' perception of wolves would have changed, had the hunter been the villain. And the fairy tale ended with the girl and the wolf resting next to one another peacefully.”</p><p>“So what's your point?”</p><p>“You ought to question what you hear about wolves, about the negative stereotypes attached to them.”</p><p>“About you.”</p><p>“Correct. Then again, I'm no wolf, am I?“ he said, flashing Evans his most dazzling smile, and he was pleased to see a soft tinge of pink color Evans's cheeks.</p><p>“We'll see about that,” Evans said, putting up a rather transparent ruse of stubbornness.</p><p>In the end, it was only a matter of time until he, too, would succumb to the wolf's – no, the <em>serpent's</em> – charms.</p><p align="CENTER">***</p><p>Even Malfoy wasn't as aggravating as Tom Marvolo Riddle. Whereas Malfoy was arrogant and childish, Riddle's superiority appeared to be genuine. In every class, he was at the top, and more often than not, he could hold his ground in debates with their smartest of teachers. In fact, even Dumbledore had to concede he was downright brilliant, and Riddle appeared to have turned it into a personal challenge to do especially well in Dumbledore's classes, so Dumbledore had no choice but to praise him against his will.</p><p>Despite Harry knowing firsthand he was up to no good, there was yet to be a single instance in which his manners and behavior hadn't been impeccable. It was a fact that infuriated Harry to no ends. How dare his parents' murderer be perceived as a perfect model student! How dare he walk Hogwarts's halls and be admired by everyone but Dumbledore and him, when his hands were already stained with Myrtle Warren's blood! How could they all be blinded by his handsome face and his silver tongue?</p><p align="LEFT">The worst of it all was that Dumbledore had instructed him to at least try to be civil to Riddle on the surface.</p><p align="LEFT">“It won't do us any good, dear boy,” he had admonished Harry, “if we give free reign to our, ah, <em>wariness</em> of him. Even among Slytherins, Tom has proven himself to be especially cunning. A single misstep on our part, and it'll be a child's play for him to paint us as a pair of evildoers.”</p><p align="LEFT">And then, there were his interactions with Riddle themselves. No matter how many times Harry slipped and snapped at him, his immaculate mask remained firmly locked in place, and every time, Harry walked away from him feeling as though he was in the wrong – he, whose parents had been murdered by the monster before him, he, who had been targeted by Voldemort from the age of one – and it was in times like that that he cursed his original Gryffindor sorting for making him feel bad for antagonizing someone just because he technically hadn't committed most of the atrocities Harry was blaming him for.</p><p align="LEFT">However, whenever the nagging thoughts of whether he was being nasty to someone innocent grew too persistent, all it took was the memory of Cedric's lifeless eyes, of Sirius's final smile for guilt and doubts to make way for righteous anger – anger that despite its blinding nature allowed him to regain his clarity and focus.</p><p align="LEFT">Technically innocent in some ways or not, Harry knew perfectly well what Voldemort's younger self was capable of, and so did Dumbledore. And if they were the only ones capable of seeing through his mask, then it was their duty to expose him as the monster he was before he could inflict any further harm, before he could completely turn into the monster they all feared.</p><p align="LEFT">Harry Potter mustn't waver – not when he had been ripped away from his friends when they needed him the most.</p><p align="LEFT">They had been fighting for their very lives in the Department of Mysteries from the moment the Harry's visions had turned out to be a vicious trap, and Sirius, who had promised they would be a family, had rushed to his aid, had protected him like a father would.</p><p align="LEFT">And then, everything had gone too fast. The very moment the curse had left Bellatrix's vile lips, Harry had made a leap for Sirius and shoved him aside, taking the full brunt of the curse himself and falling backwards – right through the shimmering, whispering Veil.</p><p align="LEFT">For a moment, there had been nothing but darkness – pitch-black and cold like a soothing balm – and his thoughts had become comfortably muddy. There was nothing left for him to worry about, not when he had prevented the death of yet another loved one, and he finally felt that after so many years of fighting for his life, for the lives of those he cared for, it was okay for him to simply close his eyes and rest. Harry couldn't tell was whether he was floating or falling, yet he couldn't bring himself to care.</p><p align="LEFT">For a moment, he simply reveled in the contentedness he'd deprived himself of ever since he could remember, reveled in the lightness of his shoulders and chest. At least, that was until a single voice sliced through the silence.</p><p>
  <em>'You do not belong.'</em>
</p><p>Green, almond-shaped eyes so much like his own were glaring at him, devoid of any semblance of the kindness he’d known them for from photographs and descriptions. They were looking at him as though he was their enemy.</p><p><em>'You do not belong</em>,' Lily Potter’s voice declared again, this time more coldly, more firmly. <em>'Leave this instant!'</em></p><p>Suddenly, the entire place was rejecting him, tossing him about from all sides and it took him every ounce of willpower to maintain a firm hold on his corporeal form and his sense of self. It was then that his scar began to burn, white-hot pain spreading down his jugular, through his every vein, and Harry threw back his head and screamed.</p><p align="LEFT">And then, he saw Sirius's silhouette in the distance.</p><p align="LEFT">He hadn't been able to save him either.</p><p>His throat was raw and bloody by the time he finally blacked out; it was a final act of mercy for a boy who had had his modest final hope shattered right before his eyes.</p><p align="LEFT">The first thing he picked up on when he came to himself was the smell of freshly cut grass and the sun’s gentle caress upon his cheeks. He was slightly disoriented when he finally opened his eyes, but that had to be normal after he’d just woken from a nap close to the shore of the Black Lake with the castle right behind him.</p><p>What he hadn't known yet was that the Hogwarts he saw wasn't the one of his own time, that he was stranded in a different time, not knowing whether his friends had survived without him.</p><p>
