    <p>Remus stared at his shaking hands if he looked closely he could still see some dried blood underneath his fingernails. The image of Regulus’s dead mangled body was imprinted in his mind. Every time he closed his eyes it was like he was back at the scene. The faint scent of cigarettes and rain wafted into the area and he knew who it was without having to look up.</p>
<p>“ Sirius,” he croaked out, his voice raw from crying earlier.</p>
<p>Sirius stood silently in front of the bars, his shoulders were back and his head held high. His face was a mask, but his eyes shone with unshed tears and held so much pain as they looked at Remus. </p>
<p>“ Did you do it? “ Sirius asked, his voice so quiet that Remus almost didn’t hear him.</p>
<p>“ Did. You. Kill. My. Brother.” He asked with clenched teeth.</p>
<p>Remus sat on the cold concrete floor of Azkaban unresponsive.</p>
<p>“ REMUS! “Sirius' hands were wrapped around the bars, so tightly that his knuckles were white.</p>
<p>“ No,” Remus whispered, “ How could you think I could do this Sirius? I loved him like he was my own brother! </p>
<p>Remus looked up at Sirius as his breathing became more ragged.</p>
<p>“ It was a werewolf attack, Remus, there are no other werewolf packs around here or you would know about them, so who could have done it huh? Who could have killed my brother besides you? ”</p>
<p>Remus was quiet for a moment as he stood up. His clothes still have some blood on them and as they shifted on his body, the scent of them, made him feel sick.</p>
<p>“ There is one werewolf who could have done this and it sure as Merlin was not me-,”</p>
<p>“ Then who Rem! Who fucking killed him!” Sirus’s mask cracked he banged on the wolfsbane covered bars.</p>
<p>“ Fenrir Greyback,” he whispered with clenched fists.</p>
<p>“ Really Remus?! Fenrir was killed years ago by the ministry! How could he have done this if he’s dead?”</p>
<p>“ I DON’T KNOW! I don’t know! All I know is that he did it! If you want justice for Regulus’s murder then we find him! Sirius, you’ve got to believe me when I say that I didn’t kill him.”<br/>
Remus and Sirius stood face to face, only the bars separating them. Still, their bodies had naturally shifted closer to each other.</p>
<p>“ Please, believe me, Sirius.” His voice was small and almost childlike. He gripped the bars, his skin audibly burning, making him grip them even harder.</p>
<p>At this moment, Remus had the same fearful and lost expression as he did when James, Peter, and Sirius had found out about his hairy condition. </p>
<p>“ I don’t think I can Remus… I don’t think I can.” Sirius said as he began to back away from him.</p>
<p>Remus watched as the man he loved left him. For the first time in years, he was alone again. First James and Lily, then Peter, and now Sirius, the one person who promised to never leave him. Remus finally gave in to what he had been feeling this whole time. He howled for Regulus, for baby Harry, and lastly… for himself. His claws scratched across his body, the pain familiar to him. Maybe it was him. Maybe the beast in him won. Maybe the ministry was right all along. Monsters don’t deserve to live.</p>
