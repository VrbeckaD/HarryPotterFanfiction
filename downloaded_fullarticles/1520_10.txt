    <p>“Here’s your tea, Mrs. Travers.”</p><p>“Thank you, dear.  Put it on the side table here.  Now, go fetch the new <i>Witch Weekly</i> and read the recipes to me.  That <i>Prophet</i> article about the latest gruesome murder is so deeply unsettling; I need something to cheer me up.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>The little boy’s face was red with exertion, a thin sheen of sweat plastering his hair to his forehead, but he stubbornly put all his weight against the chair, ignoring the scraping sound of the wooden legs against the floor, until it hit the cupboards with a BANG!  He stumbled against the seat as his sweaty palms slipped but gave a delighted laugh and scrambled atop it.  Throwing up one leg, he hoisted himself onto the kitchen counter.  Mindful of his position, he got to his feet and grabbed one of the handles of the cupboard doors, prying it open and looking hopefully inside.  His narrow face split into a wide grin as he stared at the stacks of biscuits.  After snatching as many packets as he could hold, he settled happily near the sink, his legs dangling off the side of the counter.<center>
  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>The young man collapsed onto the floor as another convulsion hit.  When the pain finally receded, he examined himself.  There was a new scrape mark on his left forearm where he’d landed.  He dragged himself along the floor toward the foot of the corner table where he’d stashed his supply of gauze and antiseptic ointment.  Growling at the clumsiness of his gnarled fingers, he finally managed to apply the ointment without losing too much of it and secured the square of gauze with a wandless adhesive charm.  Exhausted from the effort, he forced himself into a sitting position and leaned against the wall, wheezing.  He ducked his head against his shoulder in a feeble attempt to wipe away some of the sweat burning his eyes.<p>After a moment’s recovery, he opened his eyes and stared down the long corridor first toward the kitchen and then the entrance to the sitting room.  His mind almost made up to take a much-needed nap, his stomach gave a sudden loud rumble.  He sighed and stared down at his hands.  They’d been trembling all afternoon and still were.  A quick mental inventory produced another sigh.  The food items available were too troublesome to prepare in his state.  He would have to go to bed hungry.</p><p>He slowly dragged himself to his feet and headed toward the sitting room.</p>

</center>Draco Malfoy threw aside the day’s <i>Prophet</i> and stared glumly at his breakfast.  The elves had made his favourite for the third day in a row, likely under strict instructions from his mother “to keep him in good spirits”.  He huffed.  What would lift his mood would actually be a return of—<p>“You’re not eating, Draki-kins.”  There was a note of disappointment in his mother’s voice.  He roused himself and began tucking into his eggs.  He stared fixedly at his plate until he heard a small sigh and the slight clink of her teacup against its saucer to indicate that she was also finally partaking of her meal instead of boring holes into his skull.  </p><p>After the awkward meal, he escaped into the library.  It was only the first week into his one-year sentence, but he was already bored.  Sighing, he browsed a new shelf and took out a book on rare flora of the Pantanal region of South America.  He sank into an armchair.</p>

</center>George opened the door and grinned when he espied their visitor.  “Hermione!  How lovely of you to come!  Welcome to our humble abode!”<p>Hermione rolled her eyes and gave him a quick hug before heading toward the kitchen to greet Mrs. Weasley.  She greeted Bill and Fleur as she passed them.  </p><p>“Oh, my dear, I’m so glad you could come!  Help yourself to some shortbread biscuits.  Or if you prefer, I made some strawberry tarts this morning.  But don’t fill up—I’m just about done here!”</p><p>Hermione had just picked up a biscuit when there was a clattering and Ron stumbled into the kitchen, looking distinctly as one who’d just rolled out of bed.  “Oh, it’s you, ’Mione!”  He hugged her.</p><p>“And a good morning to you, Ronald.  I trust you slept well.”  </p><p>“’Course!  Mum, can we eat yet?  I’m starving!”</p><p>“You can have some biscuits, but you’re not getting anything else until you’ve set the table.  Will Harry be joining us?”</p><p>“Nah.  He’s with a team out hunting that Cruciatus Killer.”</p><p>“What was Robards thinking to send the poor boy after such a dangerous criminal?”</p><p>“Well, Mum, seeing as Harry off’d ol’ Voldemort, guess Robards figured—”</p><p>“Ronald Bilius!  I nearly scalded myself!”</p><p>“Oh, c’mon, Mum!  He’s been dead for months now!  It’s safe to say his name!  Besides, you saw that shrivelled carcass; they even burned it as an extra precaution.”</p><p>“Ron’s right, Mrs. Weasley.  We can’t let him continue to terrorize us from beyond the grave.  Mrs. Longbottom said that she finally got over her fear by yelling his name every time she had trouble digging up stubborn weeds in her garden.”</p><p>“Hey, that’s a great idea, Mum!  You could yell his name whenever you burn yourself cooking!  Or hit your head against the low ceiling in your bedroom!”</p><p>“Have you finished setting the table, Ron?  Then get the jams and honey out.  And the butter.  Unless you want to eat your toast plain.”</p>

  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>The middle-aged man startled awake from another nightmare.  He fumbled for the glass of water atop the table by the bed and cursed when it landed on the floor with a crash.  He groped for the string to switch on the lamp and winced at the sudden brightness.  He stared down at the expected mess and blinked several times to focus.  The floor was still a blur but for a few small sparkles of light bouncing off the shards.  Right.  He’d forgot again about the blasted poor eyesight.  Cursing, he grabbed the spectacles beside the lamp.  Then, gingerly to avoid stepping on the broken glass, he went in search of a broom, cursing once again as he collided with the doorframe.
