    <p>“Hey honey,  I think I kinda asked to join a gang,” Harry said, taking a bite of a cookie from the pile on the kitchen counter as the sun slowly woke up behind him through the window.</p><p>“What do you mean kinda?” Draco asked, sitting at the little round table in their new kitchen, filled to the brim with empty space. They only moved into the house together a month ago and making the place look good was a smaller priority than making sure that they have all of the essentials, which they also had none of. </p><p>“Well do you know that mission that I had to go on yesterday…?”</p><p>“Yea, and? It was just a simple case to find someone’s missing cat, right?”</p><p>“It was, but I found the cat in an alley with this weird group surround it, and I was wondering what they were doing so naturally I did the only logical thing.”</p><p>“You didn’t?”</p><p>“I went undercover and asked to join.”</p><p>Draco simply put on his cup of tea and began heading back to bed, not wanting to deal with his husband’s lovely stupidity this early in the morning.</p><p>“I may or may of not signed you up too so you can help out.”</p><p>Draco turned back around to walk back to the kitchen, trying to think over what he just heard.</p><p>“So… I um thought that you could be helpful in case of someone getting hurt or something.”</p><p>“Potter, do you even know what this group is about?” Draco asked as Harry began to pour himself a cup of tea too.</p><p>“That’s why we’re going in.”</p><p>“Couldn’t you of just asked?”</p><p>“...Yea, but of if you were in my position would you of asked?” Harry set the kettle back on the stove for a bit of warmth, making the small amount left swirl around as he moved it.</p><p>“Fine.” Draco grabbed a bigger cup of tea and sat back down at the table. “When do we start?”</p><p>“Today.”</p><p>“Today! You could have at least given me a few days to mentally prepare for this.”</p><p>“I know,” Harry continued, sitting down at the small table next to Draco as the sun slightly blinded him for a second as he sat down. “But they asked if we could show up today and I was too scared to say anything else.”</p><p> “That doesn’t sound like you. You sure you’re feeling alright?”</p><p>“I’m feeling great, it’s just that they were all really tall and more importantly I didn’t know if they were going to hurt the cat or not.”</p><p>“So let me get this straight, you saw them around a cat, you were curious what they were doing, so you asked to join?”</p><p>“Yep, that’s it.”</p><p>“I think you need a bit of sleep.”</p><p>“No, I don’t. Plus the auror office has been quite calm lately and I’ve been needing something to do in the meantime. Might as well join a cat hurting gang.”</p><p>“How do you know they were going to hurt the cat?”</p><p>Draco sighed, skipping over the part where Harry just assumed that they would hurt such a cute thing. “Okay, but next time maybe find a cooler gang to be a part of.”</p><p>Harry laughed, getting up to refill his cup, “Cooler than a gang huddled around a cat?”</p><p>“Good point, it could be a hard find.”</p><p>_________________________________</p><p>It was a few hours later when they were fully dressed in what Draco described as “an abomination to the color black.” They were on a tight budget and time so instead of looking like cool guys that totally weren’t working for the government and the hospital they looked more like they fell into a random bag full of different shades of black clothing and somehow the clothes found their way onto them. </p><p>After Harry finished covering up his scar with a mixture of a hiding spell and a few layers of makeup, he ended up supporting a long, black coat with about a million pockets along with perhaps the loudest pair of grey shoes, torn black pants, and a dirty white shirt that he found deep underneath his pile of messy clothes. Still fumbling with his hair, Draco wore a short leather jacket, an actually clean white shirt, the same looking pants as Harry, and white shoes that had a splash of different colors on the back, probably from a painting accident.</p><p>Together, they looked a bit more like spies who didn’t know what to wear than criminals but it’s was too late anyway to find something even slightly better to wear as they collected all their supplies and headed out the door as they arrived at the meet place a few seconds after they felt the usual twistiness of an apparition.</p><p>As their eyes got use to the lack of light, they could slightly make out a dark alleyway, with a lighter door down the hall, slightly hidden with a few trash cans. </p><p>Gradually, they walked towards the door, the sounds of laughter and something sharp hitting the wall echoed softly throughout the small alley. Finally reaching the door, they only made it through one knock before the door was flung open, sending every colorful scent possible right at them. From what they could make out, it was a strange combination of tea, pumpkins, sugar cookies, some other type of sugar, leather, and steel. After having their noses knocked out from the sheer amount of smells, their vision went away moments later, all of the light of the place overwhelming all other senses. </p><p>From what their imagination made up, they were expecting it to be cool, dark, maybe a bit smelly but instead they saw what looked like the room of a cheerful child. There were sunflowers lining each wall, wooden table scattered across the room, each with about a million beer cups on them. The room itself was a light brown, illuminated with bright yellow lights, giving the room even more of a cheerful atmosphere. From what they could see from the door, there a huge chimney with a fire going, and a bunch of pictures of the people inside flying on brooms, group pictures, and a bunch of cute animals. </p><p>The man in front of them was a tall, clearly strong man, with long hair braided out of his face with his black spotted wand sticking through the top of the braid. He was wearing an actually good version of the outfit Draco and Harry were wearing along with a small pin on the corner of his jacket that just had a close up of a bunny’s face. As they looked around the room, it appeared at every member inside was sporting different bunnies all on a cute pin on their shirt, some eating carrots, napping, or just playing in the grass. </p><p>“Ah! You two must be the new members! Come on in, we got a bit of cold lemonade brewing in the back and all the animals are almost done with the naps!” the man started to lead them inside what was starting to look more like a kid’s tea party than a remote hideout.</p><p>They slowly stepped in, immediately feeling the warmth of the room wash over them as the wind from the outside could no longer reach them. They tried to watch exactly where they put their feet before that failed as the guy bent down and put his arm around them, dragging them into the middle of the room faster than they would of wanted to. </p><p>“So, in a few minutes, your initiation to the Dreaded Bunnies will be ready. We just need to wait for the bomb to be placed and for the target to head to work again. Most of the members should already be stationed at their spot.”</p><p>“Wait- what do you mean bomb?” Draco asked, speaking for the first time since they left their house. </p><p>“Just what it sounds like, a bomb. When we tap a wand on it, it should go boom and cause maybe half a block to get seriously damaged, just enough for a distraction,” the guy replied, happily reenacting the boom with his hands. </p><p>“Do you usually use bombs?”</p><p>“Yep, it’s our specialty, other than being the best with animals.”</p><p>And just like that, reports from all over the years came bursting into Harry’s brain like a bomb. Millions of unsolved bombings from all over that were rumored to be from the same person. Millions of deaths, millions of places blown apart, millions of animals missing from every site. It was said that even the best auror couldn’t find them, and now he was about to be apart of the group.</p>
