    <p>Sirius looked down at the small bundle in his arms.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t do this.” He whispered to himself. He swept a tuft of unruly black hair out of the sleeping toddler’s face and stared at the lightning bolt scar that now adorned the child’s forehead.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius stiffened when he felt a warm hand rest on his shoulder. He looked up to meet the kind brown and gold eyes of Remus Lupin, who was smiling softly at him.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes you can.” Remus replied gently.</p><p> </p><p>“What if I mess it up? You know better than anyone that I’m not exactly the responsible parent type. Maybe Dumbledore is right and he would be better off with the Muggles.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can change; for him. And if you need help, I will always be here. You know that, Padfoot.” Remus’s grip tightened fractionally. “The Muggles? Really Sirius? You know what Petunia is like.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius smiled, albeit somewhat nervously, back at Remus. “Thank you. And you’re right. You’re always right.” Sirius breathed deeply. “I never thought I’d be a parent, and I definitely never thought I’d be raising Prongslet. I never thought that…”</p><p> </p><p>Remus wrapped his arms around Sirius’s shoulders as his voice broke. “Nobody thought this would happen. We knew that someone in the Order was a traitor, but no one could have known that Peter would be the one to betray us all.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius chuckled bitterly. “Yeah, I would have thought he’d be too cowardly. But then, running to Voldemort’s side in the first place was pretty cowardly. Didn’t think we could win. If you can’t beat them, join them.”</p><p> </p><p>“We did beat him.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, Harry beat him... But at what cost? Lily and James…” Sirius trailed off.</p><p> </p><p>“If you, we, raise Harry on the side of the Light, their sacrifice won’t be in vain.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius scoffed. “’Their sacrifice won’t be in vain’? Come on Moony. You’re really going to preach that shit at me? No matter how much this was for the ‘greater good’, it doesn’t change the fact that a little boy has lost his parents. And now all he’s got is me, you and a muggle who doesn’t love him.”</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll get through this. We’ll catch Peter, the rest of the Death Eaters will be rounded up and Harry can live the life Lily and James wanted for him.” Remus said softly, sitting down beside Sirius. He looked down at the sleeping toddler and stroked his hair gently.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Sirius murmured after a moment. “I was angry; I didn’t mean to take it out on you.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus leaned over and kissed Sirius’s temple. “I know.”</p><p>---</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter, heir apparent to the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black and Potter, was nervous.</p><p> </p><p>He was dressed in his nicest muggle clothes (ones that Sirius had bought for him), standing outside the front door of a house he never thought he would be going into. At least, that’s what Sirius had always said.</p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Magic had expressed concern that Harry had never met his blood relatives. And since Harry would be going off to Hogwarts in a year, the Department of Magical Child Services thought it was about time. Sirius had grumbled all the way there. Remus had placed a placating hand on Sirius’s shoulder, a physical reminder to behave.  </p><p> </p><p>“We can still back out, you know.” Sirius said, reaching for the doorbell. “We don’t have to do this.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus sighed. “You know we have to. And they’re expecting us.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ruddy Ministry, wanting me to prove I can be Harry’s guardian just because he happens to have one biological father and two adoptive ones. Homophobic gits.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry chuckled softly and Remus ruffled his hair lightly. He knew what Petunia was like and didn’t blame Sirius one bit for being upset about this, but Remus wanted to keep Harry. And if that meant jumping through hoops, then he would gladly do it. Even if it meant having to endure one afternoon with Vernon and Petunia Dursley.</p><p> </p><p>At exactly 2 o’clock, Sirius rang the doorbell and placed a hand gently on Harry’s shoulder, whether to soothe the boy or himself was unclear.</p><p> </p><p>“Get away from the door, Dudley!” Came the muffled screech of Petunia as the door was slowly opened. It revealed a large, round man with no neck, beady eyes and a thick moustache. Harry thought he looked like a walrus. And not a particularly nice one. The man scowled at the three of them.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re late.” The man snapped.</p><p> </p><p>Remus smiled pleasantly. “I think you’ll find, Mr Dursley, that we’re right on time.”</p><p> </p><p>The man’s eyes narrowed. He moved backwards, opening the door enough to let the three of them in. Harry gulped. Remus nodded before ushering Harry inside, followed by Sirius who glared at Vernon as he walked by.  </p><p> </p><p>They walked into what appeared to be the living room. It had salmon coloured walls, floral patterned couches and photos all about the place of something that looked like a bright pink beach ball wearing different kinds of hats in each image.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius tried to keep a straight face as he looked around the room. Petunia still had shocking taste in, well, everything.</p><p> </p><p>Petunia stood behind the couch, somehow managing to look down on the three wizards, despite two of them being much taller than she was. “Black. Lupin.” She said shortly.</p><p> </p><p>Remus attempted another smile. “Hello Petunia. It has been quite a while, hasn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>Petunia’s nostrils flared. “Not nearly long enough. Sit. Have some tea. The quicker we get through this, the quicker you can leave.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius snorted at that. “You really haven’t changed, have you Petunia?” He sat, gesturing for Harry to sit beside him.</p><p> </p><p>“Neither have you.” Petunia retorted. “Almost worse than that Snape boy.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius laughed heartily. “Ah, good old Snivellus. He hasn’t tried contacting you, has he?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, and I’ll tell you want I told him, I want nothing to do with that world. Nor with anyone in it.” Petunia snapped, looking pointedly at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked down at his hands, feeling upset somehow. This woman was his blood relative, and yet she completely rejected him without even knowing him.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Dudley came into the room and dropped heavily onto the opposite couch from the three wizards. “You’re my cousin, then?” The young boy said. He looked identical to him father, except he had blonde hair and blue eyes like his mother. And of course, couldn’t yet grow a moustache.</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Mum says your parents were freaks.” Dudley stated matter-of-factly.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius raised an eyebrow. At least Petunia had enough decency to blush.</p><p> </p><p>“Depends of your definition of freak,” Harry said softly. “You’re just as freakish to me as I am to you.”</p><p> </p><p>“How dare you speak about us like that?” Vernon suddenly shouted, making everyone in the room jump. They all seemed to have forgotten that he was there.</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned. “Well, you seem to think me and my parents are freaks. How is that any different?”</p><p> </p><p>Remus and Sirius shared a smirk.</p><p> </p><p>“Now, now. There’s no need to shout. It is clear none of us get along. We don’t want to be here anymore than you want us to be here. So, let’s just get through introductions and a cup of tea and we’ll be on our way. End of story.” Remus said, picking up his cup and taking a small sip.</p><p> </p><p>“And you do realise, when the Service Worker comes here to follow up our visit and possibly decides that we’re not good enough parents for Harry, then you’re next in line to take him in, right? So I suppose it is in your best interests to give us a good report, since you clearly want nothing to do with him?” Sirius said. He put his arm around Harry and stroked him comfortingly. It must be hard to know that your only living biological family don’t want you.</p><p> </p><p>Petunia and Vernon exchanged looks. “Fine. That suits us.”</p><p> </p><p>Petunia looked at Harry in the eyes. “You look exactly like Potter. Though, you have Lily’s eyes. You need a haircut. But other than that, you look healthy and you seem somewhat intelligent.” She glanced at Sirius and Remus. “I have no reason to give a bad report. I’m not that spiteful, especially when it doesn’t work in my favour.” She looked back to Harry. “In case you don’t know, I am your aunt Petunia. This is your uncle Vernon and this is your cousin Dudley. Unless the Ministry decides to stick its nose in again, this will be the first and last time that you see us. Introductions done. I don’t want you mixing with Dudley and I’m sure your godfather doesn’t want you mixing with him.” She turned and walked to the front door and opened it. “Good day to you.”</p><p> </p><p>The three wizards took that as their cue to leave. Harry was the last one out the door. He turned at looked at Petunia. “Goodbye, Aunt Petunia.”</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Later that night, Harry sat in his bed, holding a photograph of his parents that Sirius had given him. He sighed and wiped a tear from his eye. He didn’t understand why he was so upset. It’s not like he had expected anything different. Sirius and Remus had prepared him for what the Durlsey’s were like, but still…</p><p> </p><p>Noticing that Harry’s light was still on, Sirius knocked on his godson’s door. When he got no response he opened the door. He saw Harry looking down at the old photo of James and Lily, apparently lost in thought. Sirius was a little worried. Harry only looked at that photo when something was bothering him.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s wrong, pup?” Sirius asked, sitting down on the edge of Harry’s bed. Sirius was surprised to see unshed tears in his godson’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what I was expecting. I knew they were unpleasant and didn’t like the magical world, but… How could she hate me that much? She knew me for all of ten minutes, she doesn’t know me at all. Did I…did I do something wrong?” Harry asked, his voice trembling slightly. “She’s the only family I have left, apart from you and Moony. Why didn’t she like me?”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius’s heart broke for Harry. He knew what it was like to be hated by your own flesh and blood, but Harry didn’t deserve it. Harry had already lost so much. He pulled his godson into a warm hug. “You did nothing wrong, pup. You could have presented her with the crown jewels and her favourite chocolate and she still would have acted like that. It’s not you. It’s her. She and your mum never got on. In fact, I think Petunia hated your mum. I don’t know why, but I’m pretty sure Lily didn’t deserve it. Your mum didn’t have a mean bone in her body. I think Petunia is just scared. Scared of things that are different, scared of things she can’t control or understand.”</p><p> </p><p>“So she hates me because she hated my mum?” Harry asked.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius nodded. He pulled away slightly, but held Harry’s hands in his own. “She thought because Lily was a witch, she was a freak. Petunia didn’t want anything to do with magic. And, I think she was jealous as well.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned. “Why would she be jealous if she hated magic so much?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because I think, deep down, Petunia wished she was a witch too. So she could be special like your mum was.” Sirius replied.</p><p> </p><p>“People are strange.” Harry said after a moment.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius chuckled softly, kissing Harry gently on the head. “That they are, pup. That they are. Now, it’s late, why don’t you get under the covers and go to sleep?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded and did as he was bid. Sirius smiled. “That’s a good Prongslet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Night Padfoot.”</p><p> </p><p>“Night Harry.”</p>
