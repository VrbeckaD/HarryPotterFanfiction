          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Surprise!"</p>
<p>Harry took his wand out and froze when he looked around and saw family and friends. "What?"Â </p>
<p>"Oh it's just Harry, where's Severus?"</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "Molly no surprise parties for Severus, it's dangerous, why do you think I never planned one?"</p>
<p>"Oh Harry the war was over years ago, Severus has mellowed."</p>
<p>"Yeah, he even smiles." Ron smirked.</p>
<p>"Fine but don't say I didn't warn you. Just remember to duck when the poppers go off after shouting 'surprise'."</p>
<p>Severus threw hexes everywhere when he heard shouts and loud bangs and saw everyone laying on floor.</p>
<p>"Told you!" Harry laughed.</p></div>
