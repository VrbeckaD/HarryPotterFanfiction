    <p>Harry and his parents were walking through the crowded streets of Diagon Ally. They were buying everything that Harry would need for his first year at Hogwarts, and to say that he was excited would be an understatement. He was skipping happily between his parents when he saw a quidditch shop.</p><p>            <em>Can I go in?! Please! </em>Harry begged his parents, giving them the best puppy dog eyes he could manage.</p><p>            Lilly smiled down at him. <em>Alright. But you stay in there until we come and get you.</em></p><p><em>            I will! </em>Harry grinned and ran into the shop. He took his time looking at all the new brooms that were coming out this month. In his excitement to get into the shop he bumped into another boy around the same age as him with really blonde hair. He muttered an apology and made his way into the shop.</p><p>            Draco couldn’t believe that this kid bumped into him without saying so much as an apology. With a huff, he followed the skinny boy into the quidditch shop and stood behind him with his arms crossed.</p><p>            “It’s very rude to bump into someone and not say you are sorry,” Draco said, trying his best to sound as old as he could.</p><p>            To his surprise the boy didn’t react and simply walked over to the next broom. Maybe he was just so wrapped up in the shiny new brooms, so Draco decided to try again.</p><p>            This time he tapped the boy on the shoulder. “You are being very rude to me. I did nothing to deserve it.”</p><p>            Harry turned around to see the boy he bumped into standing behind him and talking to the floor. He waved his hands in the boy’s face to try and get his attention. “Can you please look at me when you are talking.”</p><p>            Now this boy was waving his hands in Draco’s face. Who does he think he is?! Again, Draco huffed, but he looked at the boy anyway. “You are being very rude!”</p><p>            The boy made a confused look and then began moving his hands while he said, “I am sorry for bumping into you earlier.” The boy’s voice was so quiet Draco had to strain to hear it, but at least he had finally apologized.</p><p>            “Well…I guess it’s okay,” Draco pointed to the newest broom. “Do you like the brooms coming out this year?”</p><p>            The boy glanced behind him and nodded excitedly.</p><p>            “Would you like to look at them together?”</p><p>            Again, the boy nodded and together they stood in front of the glass case admiring the newest broom. Occasionally Draco would make comments about the broom or someone in the shop, but the boy never said anything. His eyes were fixed on the broom.</p><p>            After a little bit a man and a woman came to stand behind the boy, and tapped him gently on the shoulder.</p><p>            Harry turned around and beamed at his parents. <em>Aren’t the brooms so cool?!</em></p><p><em>            </em>What was he doing with his hands again, Draco thought and gave the boy a confused look.</p><p>            Lilly smiled down at her son. <em>They are very lovely. Who is your friend here?</em></p><p><em>            </em>Oh great, now the woman was doing it also.</p><p>            Harry bit his lip. <em>I didn’t get his name, but he wanted to look at the brooms with me.</em></p><p><em>            </em>Lilly turned to Draco and signed as she spoke. “This is my son, Harry. He is deaf. Thank you for looking at the brooms with him.”</p><p>            Harry smiled shyly and waved at the blonde boy.</p><p>            Of course he was deaf! Draco thought, mentally kicking himself for not seeing it sooner. “It’s nice to meet you, Harry. My name is Draco,” He stuck out his hand for Harry to shake.</p><p>            Harry watched his mother translate and smiled shyly and shook his hand gently.</p><p>            “Are you going to Hogwarts this year?” Draco said, and this time both he and Harry watched Lilly translate.</p><p>            “Yeah, it will be my first year,” Harry said quietly.</p><p>            “Me too!” Draco grinned, then he heard his father calling his name. “My father is calling me. I will see you on the train then?”</p><p>            Harry nodded happily and waved goodbye to his new friend.</p><p>            <em>He seems very sweet</em>, Lilly signed with a smile at her son.</p><p>            <em>Can I get an owl now?! </em></p><p align="center">HDHDHDHDH</p><p>Harry found a compartment all to himself on the train. He really didn’t want to interact with people, he has never really been a people person, and making friends was never his strong suit. To his surprise the blonde boy from Diagon ally, Draco, opened the door to the compartment slowly.</p><p>            He faced Harry, “Mind if I join you?”</p><p>            Harry smiled and motioned for Draco to sit.</p><p>            Draco smiled back and took a seat across from Harry. He took a deep breath. <em>I was looking forward to seeing you.</em></p><p><em>            </em>Draco watched Harry’s eyes go big. He had been practicing his sign language ever sense he found out that Harry was deaf. He liked the boy for whatever reason and wanted him to have someone that he could communicate with.</p><p>            <em>I was looking forward to seeing you too! You can sign? That’s amazing! </em>Harry signed quickly and bounced happily in his seat.</p><p>            Draco gave a confused look. “I’m sorry,” he said. <em>Still learning. Slow?</em></p><p><em>            </em>Harry blushed bashfully. “I forget sometimes. If you are not bothered by my voice, we could always talk.”</p><p>            “That’s fine. I would enjoy that,” Draco smiled back.</p><p>            Together they spent the rest of the train ride talking about random things, and when the trolley came by, they each bought a handful of candy, promising not to tell the others parents.</p><p>            Waiting for their turn for being sorted, everyone was anxious. Draco promised to tap Harry when his name was called, so he was less nervous about missing his turn. And on the train they had worked out that Draco would secretly hold up the first letter of the house he had been sorted into. Again, one less thing to worry about, Draco was turning out to be a good friend to have.</p><p>            When Draco finally tapped his side gently, Harry took a deep breath and made his way up to the stool. When he sat down and the hat was placed on his head, he kept his eyes fixed on Draco.</p><p>            Draco gave the nervous boy a wink. He looked absolutely petrified.</p><p>            To his delight, the Sorting Hat called out Slytherin and he held up the letter S in front of his chest. They were sure to be in the same house, all Malfoys are in Slytherin. Or at least that’s what his father told him.</p><p>            Harry grinned and mouthed a thank you to Draco, before making his way to the Slytherin table, and sitting down shyly.</p><p>            Someone moved into the spot next to him and tapped his leg. Looking up, he was met by a grinning Draco.</p><p>            He grinned back at him. This was going to be great! His best friend was in the same house as him!</p>
