    <p class="p1">“He’s going to win reelection next year.”</p>
<p class="p1">Astoria was watching the news again, lying on her side to face the small bedroom TV. Draco sighed as he walked into the room.</p>
<p class="p1">“You shouldn’t watch that stuff,” Draco said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Why not? We know who he is. What he really is,” Astoria insisted.</p>
<p class="p1">“Because there’s nothing we can do about it,” Draco said, sitting beside her then adding, “Not yet.”</p>
<p class="p1">“The things he says… they are terrifying. And the worst thing is that his actual goals are so much worse. He’s a monster,” Astoria said.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco looked sadly at his wife. There was still guilt in her eyes. It wasn’t her fault that Riddle was president but she had played a small role in his resurrection years before. But only a small one. They both had. He leaned over and kissed her forehead.</p>
<p class="p1">“You know more than you’re telling me. You have contacts. Something big is about to happen,” Astoria said, his kiss not being sufficient for soothing her.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco sighed and nodded.</p>
<p class="p1">“Dammit. What is it?” Astoria plead.</p>
<p class="p1">“What I’ve been told is that the president is about to launch a new secret project. Death Troopers. Some sort of elite supernatural force. They are going to take out targets the president deems threats. Keep other supernatural forces in line. It’s been brewing for a while,” Draco admitted.</p>
<p class="p1">“Shit. This means he’ll go after Godric’s Hollow. He’ll come after Harry,” Astoria said, touching Draco’s hand.</p>
<p class="p1">“I know. Harry’s the only one of the old gang still there. Everyone left or has disappeared. I don’t even understand why he went back,” Draco said.</p>
<p class="p1">Two years before Harry Potter had lead a battle against the Dark Lord’s right hand woman, Bellatrix Lestrange. A bunch of people disappeared after that battle. Draco hadn’t been there but he had heard it was devastating and rather than defeating her, Bellatrix was bound to the town, unable to escape. Draco wasn’t sure what would happen if she ever escaped but it probably wouldn’t be good.</p>
<p class="p1">“Do you want go help him?” Astoria asked, her brown eyes looking directly into his eyes.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco sighed. Despite everything he still loved Harry Potter. He loved Astoria too. The two things were not incompatible.</p>
<p class="p1">“I do. But I also don’t want to leave you. They’ll come for you too,” Draco said, brushing his hands through her dark brown hair.</p>
<p class="p1">Astoria smiled and said, “I’m stronger than you. I can handle myself. And I have a plan if everything goes badly. Besides, this is your family’s town. His people won’t touch the name Malfoy. Not if they know what’s good for them.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m afraid they don’t. Astoria, the things I’m hearing. This is the end game. I think something big is going to happen in Godric’s Hollow. I don’t even know if I can stop it if I do go there,” Draco said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Draco… I know how you feel about Harry. And beyond that, if we are ever going to stop the Dark Lord we have to save Harry. And then we have to find the others. Luna and Hannah disappeared ages ago. We’ll need all four of us. Meghan believed it and I believe it too,” Astoria said.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco looked at his wife. She was still the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He was afraid to leave. He wanted to trace every line of her body to remember how she feels… just in case. As if she could sense his thoughts, she leaned over into a kiss, slow, warm and soft. He heard the TV turn off as Astoria pulled away.</p>
<p class="p1">“I want you to go to him. Help him. Save him. Bring him back here. But tonight… give me tonight. You can leave in the morning,” Astoria said, her finger tracing his jawline.</p>
<p class="p1">“You can have tonight,” Draco said, moving his mouth to her throat, making her gasp.</p>
<p class="p1">A hand slid up her skirt, feeling her through her underwear as she squirmed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Lay back. Let me take control,” Astoria said and Draco obeyed.</p>
<p class="p1">She hopped off the bed, undressing before him. Draco removed his belt, then quickly undid his pants, pulling them down and kicking them off at her feet. He removed his underwear while she went over to grab the lube. She climbed onto the bed, covering his cock with the lube then getting on top of him. Draco felt stupid still being in his button-up shirt but quickly got lost in Astoria riding him, his hands drifting up to cup her small breasts.</p>
<p class="p1">Astoria pushed his hands out of the way, reaching between her legs to touch herself. Draco always let her finish a couple of times before he did. Not that he could stop her if he tried. After he finally finished they cuddled for a bit before having dinner. They watched a movie after that but halfway through they started fooling around, Draco bending her over the ottoman. Then again in the bathtub.</p>
<p class="p1">At bed Draco went down on her for a good long time, losing track of how many times she came. She returned the favor and then they finally fell asleep, Draco holding her tightly, fearing what the coming days would bring them both.</p>
<p class="p1">The morning was hard. Astoria tried to act calm but Draco knew she was afraid. So he was he. He was probably more afraid than her.</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">Pansy Parkinson was reborn screaming, a flurry blood and ashes restoring her. She opened her eyes. Every part of her hurt. She was naked and in a dark, candlelit room, several other people standing and watching.</p>
<p class="p1">“What the fuck?” Pansy asked then added, “Where’s Draco?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Draco’s none of your concern. The master is raising us to fight for him,” a woman said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Fuck the master,” Pansy grunted, trying to sit up, not liking the feel of cold and ash covered concrete on her butt.</p>
<p class="p1">The entire group laughed at her comment. Great, these idiots were gonna be lots of fun, she thought.</p>
<p class="p1">“Listen, I just need to find Draco. I need to talk to him. Tell him I’m sorry and that I couldn’t… control myself,” Pansy said, pulling herself to her feet.</p>
<p class="p1">The last thing she remembered, she was in Godric’s Hollow, in Draco’s basement. Draco had realized he could remove that stupid curse from himself and Hermione Granger. Unfortunately, the price was Pansy’s life, for the second time. She was barely twenty at the time and had already died twice. It was all kinda Draco’s fault but… she forgives him, especially with everything that happened. She should’ve just given over the box. Then the bastard wouldn’t have killed her and brought her back as a vampire.</p>
<p class="p1">Pansy didn’t mind being a vampire but having a vampire master hadn’t worked out so well for her. He could tell her what to do… Pansy hurt people. Not any people she had liked and they had all been really tasty but it wasn’t good for her social life. Yeah. She could forgive Draco. He might be the only friend she had left. She knew he would never love her again but that was OK.</p>
<p class="p1">“Parkinson, you will serve the Death Troopers. And you will do it gratefully,” a tall, older looking man said.</p>
<p class="p1">“I will not. Hey, does anyone have some clothes. I’m cold,” Pansy said, rubbing her arms.</p>
<p class="p1">“Vampires run cold. Don’t worry, once you have some blood you’ll feel better. And then we head to your home town to raise some hell,” the man said, popping his knuckles.</p>
<p class="p1">“Nah. I’m good. I’ll obtain all my blood consensually from now on,” Pansy grinned.</p>
<p class="p1">The man gestured at the woman before he opened a nearby closet, dumping a blond haired man onto the floor in front of Pansy. His hands and feet were bound by rope and his mouth was covered with duct tape, Pansy examined his face. She didn’t know him.</p>
<p class="p1">“Feed,” the woman commanded her.</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t wanna,” Pansy complained.</p>
<p class="p1">“You have to feed. You need your strength. You can feel the hunger in your core. If you deny it eventually it will become too much and you won’t even be able to control yourself. Feed. Drink him dry,” the woman barked.</p>
<p class="p1">“Is he… at least a bad person?” Pansy said, cringing, able to feel the hunger.</p>
<p class="p1">“He’s a criminal. No one will miss him,” the man said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, but what kinda criminal. See, there’s a big difference between some stoner gettin’ busted for possession and like a child killer,” Pansy plead.</p>
<p class="p1">The woman rolled her eyes, walked over and with a slash of a fingernail, slit the man’s throat, his blood gushing out.</p>
<p class="p1">“Shit,” Pansy said, licking her lips.</p>
<p class="p1">“Look. He’s already going to die. You may as well feed. Don’t worry. He’ll enjoy it,” the woman said.</p>
<p class="p1">The man was twitching and shaking it. Pansy didn’t hesitate, dropping down and digging her fangs into him. The blood was rich and her body warmed. She drained him fast, disappointed when there was nothing left. She stood up, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. She could feel her pulse. She felt alive.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, OK. I’m in. I want more of that. But clothes first,” Pansy grinned.</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">The Hollow seemed quiet. Too quiet, Harry thought as he sat on the front porch of his parent’s house. Riddle had been saying a lot of disturbing things. Stirring up fear, sowing divisions. He was planning something. He made vague references to potential terror attacks. Harry knew that if things went south, his number would come up. He wondered where Hannah and Luna were. At least he knew Astoria was safe with Draco. Harry laughed. He had that backward: Draco was the one safe with her.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry thought of Ginny. Of Ron and Hermione. Neville. His friends had disappeared thanks to the big mess with Bellatrix a couple of years ago. He didn’t know where the hell they were. He need to track do Meghan. She was the key. But she hadn’t been around in ages.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry wasn’t sure why he had come back to the Hollow. Perhaps it was loyalty. He knew he should go back to Seattle to live in the house that Remus and Sirius had left him. They had both disappeared too. Possibly into the dream world. He wanted to go after them but he couldn’t be sure that’s where they were.</p>
<p class="p1">The most disturbing thing about all the missing people was that no one, aside from the lucky few, seemed to remember them. It was as if they no longer existed.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry pulled out his phone, bringing up the contact info for Draco. He could call him or text him. They could touch base. He missed Draco. Funny to think they had once hated each other. But now, with everyone gone or missing, Draco might be the best friend he had.</p>
<p class="p1">A woman came walking by on the sidewalk with her dog. Penelope Clearwater. Percy’s old girlfriend.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hey, Harry,” she said, waving up at him.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hey, Penelope. How’s it going?” Harry said, surprised that she started to walk up to him.</p>
<p class="p1">“Fine. About to head to Olympia for a baby shower. Long drive,” she laughed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Olympia. Wow. Yeah, that’s good. Seems like a good time for it,” Harry said, still feeling nervous.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah. Nice day, isn’t it?” Penelope said, looking up at the blue skies.</p>
<p class="p1">Her dog barked at Harry and she patted the dog’s head.</p>
<p class="p1">“I guess it is,” Harry said, realizing he’d barely noticed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Ah. Well, guess I’ll go. It was nice seeing you. How long you in town?” she asked.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m not sure. Make sure to drive safe,” Harry said, waving as she and the dog walked away.</p>
<p class="p1">Privately he prayed that Penelope he made it out of town as soon as possible. He had a bad feeling about tonight.</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Astoria was crouching in her dining room, trying to peer out the window, hoping to see without being seen as she lifted up the curtain. She looked out. The men were still out there. They had been there since the sunset.</p>
<p class="p1">“Dammit,” she said, dropping back down to the floor.</p>
<p class="p1">She couldn’t let herself be captured. She was hoping to at least hear from Draco again but he must not have landed in Seattle yet. She sighed and stood up. She would not be intimidated. She walked barefoot through her house. She slid on her house shoes. She wouldn’t need much more where she was going. She’d spent the last year coming up with this plan. Meghan taught her some of this magic. The rest she had figured out herself.</p>
<p class="p1">Astoria took a deep breath and opened her front door. The figures standing on the perimeter of her front yard moved quickly. Astoria raised a golden hand, blasting them all back, each of them screaming. She would not be stopped. She started to run, one of the figures, obviously a vampire was at her heels so she stopped, summoning her golden energy into a lance, piercing his heart as he exploded into blood, ash and fire. The other one dove at her so she removed it’s head much to the same effect.</p>
<p class="p1">She continued to run. She could get to the old woods faster in her car but she wouldn’t be able to fight them off as well. And it was OK. With her power she had all the stamina she could muster. She just need to get to the old woods. Then she could use the binding magic to keep herself hidden and safe. The only thing that truly matter was that her and the others were safe. Someone had to survive to be able to fight him.</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Draco drove slowly through the Hollow. The sun had just set. Astoria wasn’t responding to his texts. That worried him. As he pulled up to his parent’s home, long since abandoned, he saw figures roaming around it. As he watched the insides of the house suddenly started to glow bright with orange. It was on fire.</p>
<p class="p1">“Shit,” he said, starting to drive faster but a figure leapt in front of his car, baring fangs.</p>
<p class="p1">“Fuck no!” Draco said, and pushed down on the gas, sending the vampire flying.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco desperately tried to turn but he spun out a little, screeching across the pavement. He realized he should’ve gotten a better rental as he drove fast in the opposite direction, heading towards Harry’s neighborhood. Gunshot blasted his back window, shattering it.</p>
<p class="p1">“Guns? Fucking vampires with <em>guns</em>?” Draco screamed.</p>
<p class="p1">Quickly he realized his rear driver's side tire had been shot out. He had barely arrived near Harry’s neighborhood before he lost control, crashing into a pole, the airbags saving his life.</p>
<p class="p1">“Ow. Fuck,” Draco groaned as he pulled his car door open, falling to the ground.</p>
<p class="p1">All the power was out as far as he could see. This was it. Everything was going straight to hell. Draco ran, deciding leap over a fence, thinking he could better lose his follow by going through yards and just hoping that no dogs were outside. He ran straight into some hedges and willed himself to climb over them, hopping over the fence behind them.</p>
<p class="p1">Gunshots echoed in the distance as Draco ran through another yard and desperately climbed over another fence. He was almost certain he had cut himself climbing those hedges before. He hit the ground hard, nearly knocking his breath out. Everything was a nightmarish blur and he only wanted to find shelter and hide long enough to formulate some semblance of a plan. He pulled himself up and dashed for the back porch of the house in front of him.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco was surprised to find the backdoor unlocked. He opened it, then closed and locked it quickly. He stood there with his hand against the door, breathing hard. He jerked as there were sounds of footsteps coming from above. He quickly looked around the dark of the room he was in, appearing to be a kitchen. He couldn’t see anywhere to hide as the footsteps came down the stairs.</p>
<p class="p1">He considered running back outside but Draco knew for certain what was outside. <em>Death Troopers</em>. Dammit, his sources had been right. Perhaps whoever was hiding out in this house would be friendly at least.</p>
<p class="p1">“Who’s there?” a familiar voice said, as the footsteps moved toward the kitchen.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco didn’t speak. He knew that voice. Or was he only hearing what he wanted to hear? The figure arrived in the kitchen and moonlight illuminated his face.</p>
<p class="p1">“Potter,” Draco said, not being able to stop himself from smiling.</p>
<p class="p1">“Draco?” Harry replied, squinting at him.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah,” Draco said, feeling relief as he fell to the floor in exhaustion, the scratches on his abdomen burning.</p>
<p class="p1">“Are you all right?” Harry asked, coming around and kneeling near Draco.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco didn’t reply at first. This was all so strange. What were the odds that he would bump into Harry like this? He wondered if on some level he had sensed Harry. He could sense Astoria like that too.</p>
<p class="p1">“What are you doing here?” Draco asked.</p>
<p class="p1">“My question first, Draco,” Harry insisted.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco scowled and grunted.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m fine,” he lied, fearing the cuts were worse than he thought.</p>
<p class="p1">“Those bastards tore through this neighborhood. I think they were looking for me. I’m trying to find survivors but… everyone is dead or missing,” Harry said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Whose house is this?” Draco asked.</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t know. There’s… someone on the front porch,” Harry said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Are they OK?” Draco asked, his heart pounding.</p>
<p class="p1">“No. They aren’t OK. They aren’t OK at all,” Harry admitted, the meaning behind his words obvious.</p>
<p class="p1">“My parent’s house was on fire. They were waiting for me,” Draco said.</p>
<p class="p1">“They came to my house, of course. I fought them off but I could see the house on fire when I left,” Harry said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Dammit,” Draco sighed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Where’s Astoria?” Harry asked.</p>
<p class="p1">“She’s at home. Our other home, I mean. Maryland. I’ve been trying to text her but… there’s been no response,” Draco replied.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry sighed.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Me too,” Draco said, then tried to pull himself up before groaning in pain and falling to the floor again.</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re hurt,” Harry said, motioning to check Draco but he flinched.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m fine,” Draco insisted.</p>
<p class="p1">“Stop lying,” Harry said.</p>
<p class="p1">“What are you gonna do? It’s dark and if we make too much noise <em>they</em> might come looking for us,” Draco said.</p>
<p class="p1">“They’ll probably come looking for us anyway. But at some point we’re going to need to escape. I found some supplies in a bathroom upstairs. Come on,” Harry said, grabbing Draco’s hand then lifting him gingerly.</p>
<p class="p1">Silently they moved through the house, Harry helping Draco to walk with an arm around his back. Draco had thought of Harry holding him so many times before but never under circumstances like this. It was stupid to think of it now, Draco knew, but something about his touch had always felt electric.</p>
<p class="p1">“Take off your shirt,” Harry said, leaving Draco on a bed while he rifled through a bathroom cabinet.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco sighed and pulled off his shirt. No, it wasn’t the first time he had been shirtless in front of Harry Potter but it still made him a little nervous. Draco unbuttoned his shirt then set it aside while he waited for Harry to return.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s cold in here,” Draco said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Lower your voice,” Harry said as he entered the room.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco looked down at his torso. Blood smeared the cuts, barely visible in the pale moonlight shining through the blinds. Harry had what appeared to be a bottle of alcohol and cotton balls in his hands.</p>
<p class="p1">“Now, hold still,” Harry said, just like Draco’s mother would’ve said.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry wet the cotton balls then began to dab at the cuts.</p>
<p class="p1">“Ah. Shit!” Draco screeched as the cuts burned.</p>
<p class="p1">“Your voice!” Harry hissed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sorry. Dammit,” Draco grunted as Harry continued to dab.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco covered his mouth while Harry finished up. Harry pressed a towel to Draco’s abdomen and said, “Hold this. It looks like the bleeding has mostly stopped but just in case.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m going to live?” Draco asked pathetically.</p>
<p class="p1">Suddenly, there were voices and the sound of someone banging at the door. Draco felt all the blood drain his face and his heart began to pound in terror.</p>
<p class="p1">“What do you we do? They’ll <em>kill</em> us!” Draco screeched, thinking that Harry’s fancy powers couldn’t stop bullets.</p>
<p class="p1">“Come,” Harry said, grabbing Draco by the hand and quickly dragging him into the nearby closet.</p>
<p class="p1">Once inside Harry moved aside an ironing board and Draco squeezed behind it with Harry pushing himself in front of Draco, putting the ironing board in front of them and sweeping clothes in front of the ironing board.</p>
<p class="p1">“How did they know?” Draco growled.</p>
<p class="p1">“Shut <em>up</em>,” Harry said and Draco went silent.</p>
<p class="p1">A door downstairs slammed open, making Draco jump. There were muttering voices and stomping up the stairs.</p>
<p class="p1">“He’s gotta be in one of these houses unless we’ve lost him,” a deep voice said.</p>
<p class="p1">“If we’ve lost him he’ll be dead anyway. You know what’s out there,” a higher voice said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Nothin’ in the bathroom,” a different, more familiar high voice said, disturbing Draco.</p>
<p class="p1">“Fine. Check the closet and let’s move on,” the deep voice said, then stomped down the stairs.</p>
<p class="p1">The closet flung open. Draco could see a bright light roaming around. Draco held his breath and tried to be as still as possible. She was going to see them. How could she not?</p>
<p class="p1">Just as Draco was certain she would dig in deeper the closet door shut with a slam and the person stomped down the stairs. Neither of them moved until the sounds had passed. Draco was thinking that if he were them that he would just wait downstairs just in case anyone decide to out themselves as having been hiding. Under different circumstances Draco might’ve enjoyed being wedged this close to Harry but currently he felt terrified and suffocated.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco wasn’t sure how long they waited in the closet before finally coming out but it had felt like an eternity. He collapsed onto the bed and said, “Her voice. I recognized that voice but…”</p>
<p class="p1">“Pansy Parkinson,” Harry said flatly, sitting on the bed.</p>
<p class="p1">“But that’s impossible,” Draco said.</p>
<p class="p1">“It was her. I saw her and… I think she saw us,” Harry said.</p>
<p class="p1">“No, no, no! You don’t understand. It <em>can’t</em> be her!” Draco growled, feeling panicked again.</p>
<p class="p1">“Draco, I saw two kids I went to school with, murder each other an hour ago in the middle of the road, so you’ll forgive me for finding it easy to accept that Pansy Parkinson who was never exactly the nicest person in the world is working for <em>them</em>,” Harry said with frustration.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco sighed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Pansy is dead, Harry! Trust me. I saw her die,” Draco said.</p>
<p class="p1">“You saw her die?” Harry said suspiciously.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco closed his eyes and tried to banish old memories of blood and fire. He didn’t like to think about the dark thing that Pansy had become and how he had been forced to end her existence to put an end to a terrible curse.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” Draco said, unwilling to divulge the details.</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, she got better. It wouldn’t be the first time I saw the dead come back anyway,” Harry said.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco wondered what Harry meant but was afraid to pry and be forced to give up his own secrets in return. He had promised Hermione he would’t tell Harry.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m exhausted and jet-lagged,” Draco confessed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Me too. One of us should get some rest. I guess you since you’re injured,” Harry said.</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re going to keep watch?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah.”</p>
<p class="p1">Harry stood up and stretched.</p>
<p class="p1">“You don’t seem any less tired than me,” Draco said, scooting himself over on the bed and laying his head on a pillow.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ve been up for nearly two days and I can handle myself,” Harry admitted.</p>
<p class="p1">“You can’t stop a bullet. You should get the rest,” Draco said.</p>
<p class="p1">“No. I’ll be fine. I can’t sleep and if they come back…” Harry trailed.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco knew Harry was special just like Astoria. He supposed he had always known that even back in high school. Maybe not magically special but special nonetheless. He had hated Harry out of jealousy and buried an attraction that had only come bubbling to the surface when they were reunited as adults.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco closed his eyes begrudgingly and tried to sleep. He tried not to think about Harry. He tried not to think about Pansy Parkinson. And he tried not to think about his wife, Astoria. Twenty-four hours ago he had been with her, safe in her arms. Now he didn’t know where she was. And somewhere out east <em>he</em> was not far away. Draco shuddered as his mind flashed to <em>him</em>. The God Supreme. The Dark One. The Master of Nightmares. The President.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco didn’t think he’d be getting any rest.</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">“We’ve done all we can. Our witches are working to free the Dark Lord’s servant from her binding. Once that happens… none of us are going to want to be here,” the older male vampire said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Dammit, I want to find all the tasty morsels and rip them apart,” a long-haired man said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Vic, no judging but I feel like maybe you enjoy this too much,” a man who seemed to be his friend said, slapping him on the back.</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t want to leave. I won’t leave,” Pansy said.</p>
<p class="p1">The woman, who had turned out to be their leader, stepped up to Pansy.</p>
<p class="p1">“Why?” the woman asked.</p>
<p class="p1">“I think Harry Potter is still here. I want to eat him. My Draco was in love with him,” Pansy said, hoping she was giving them a convincing menacing grin.</p>
<p class="p1">The woman looked at the rest of the group who all shook their heads.</p>
<p class="p1">“There’s no reason to think Potter was here. And the supposed sighting of Malfoy was probably a false sighting. There’s no way he’d come back here. He’d have to be a fool,” the woman laughed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Even so. I used to go to school with them. I think I can smell Harry. Like if he were near or somethin’,” Pansy explained.</p>
<p class="p1">“Whatever. You don’t wanna be here when Lestrange is set loose. I guess if you do kill Potter make sure to send a text to the Master to let him know,” the woman said, the troopers walking away.</p>
<p class="p1">Pansy started walking in the opposite direction with a sigh. She needed to find a nice empty house with a basement so she could stay out of the sun tomorrow. Tomorrow night she would search for them.</p>
