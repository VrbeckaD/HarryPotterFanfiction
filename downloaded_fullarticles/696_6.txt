Aunt Andromeda looked regal in his arms, her grace and elegance unrivalled despite the rather modest gown she’d chosen for the occasion.</p><p>The happiness they radiated reached all the way over to Draco, making him smile absentmindedly where he sat on his own, surrounded by a sea of abandoned dinner tables. He took another sip from his drink, relishing the burn of the Firewhisky as it slid down his throat.</p><p>“Cousin Draco!”</p><p>The excited cry almost made Draco jump in his seat and splash the rest of his drink all over the white linen tablecloth.
