She had spent the summer with him, trying to get him to talk, and he had spent the summer in company alone, trying to recover silently. He knew talking wouldn't help and never had, and she wanted him to learn to trust without sacrifice.</p><p>They hadn't been the same since.</p><p>Now she grabbed his wrist, begging him with her voice and skin pressed to skin to look at her, to tell her what was wrong, to tell her everything, and he made such dreaded eye contact with her, seeing tears forming in the corners of green eyes, reflected in moonlight. He had tried so long to hold off this time, this day. Their hearts had been broken since, and though she believed she could fix his, he knew she could not.</p><p>He sat up, held her small hands in his. That dreaded contact was now impossible to break, as he tried so desperately to explain how they couldn't be two together in one; those two had to separate, because he needed to heal himself, and she needed to find someone she knew would support her, who truly loved her.</p><p>She understood what he was saying.</p><p>She had hoped it was a lie.</p><p>He gave her one last kiss under the starry sky, and he held her close as they lay back down upon the rooftop, hoping she would fall asleep in peace and only remember when morning came how he told her he knew he couldn't be fixed, and she needed to love herself more than she loved him.</p><p>They hadn't been here before, not like this.</p><p>He felt Ginny's breathing calm and brushed the tear tracks off her cheeks, and Harry looked back to the sky to scan for the few stars he knew of; hello, Regulus, hello, Sirius, how the wars have taken a toll on us all.</p></div>
