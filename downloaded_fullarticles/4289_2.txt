    <p>The Doctor sidestepped a volley of sparks as he hammered on the TARDIS's control panel. In the panic he'd dredged up bundles of wires from the console, rushing to try different combinations or at the very least redirect some power. Dropping the rubber mallet, he fanned haze away from the monitor before moving back to the keyboard.</p>
<p>"No. None of that makes sense," he slapped the side of the screen. "What are you doing?" After being on his own for any amount of time, he resorted to talking—to the ship, to himself, to anyone who would listen…</p>
<p>He glared at the towering cylindrical structure jutting up from the console. Its interior whirled and glowed erratically as he cranked at a small metal arm on the panel. The TARDIS shuddered and there was an explosive crackle of electricity followed by another shower of sparks. Wires dropped from the ceiling and steam billowed up from the floors. The ship wouldn't stay airborne. It definitely wouldn't access the Time Vortex.</p>
<p>This was his third failed attempt, though the ships condition would see to it that it was his last for now. He couldn't get a feel for what was doing it, but something was drawing the TARDIS down, playing at the ship's guidance so that it didn't know up from down.</p>
<p>Or the Vortex from regular space, for that matter.</p>
<p>Grabbing hold of whatever he could, the Doctor fought his way to the door and threw it open. He was careful to keep a grip on the inside as he peered out at the London cityscape below the jerking and twirling ship. He slammed the door; the crash wouldn't damage the ship, though it didn't matter if he still couldn't take off.</p>
<p>The drone of the TARDIS engines suddenly became more apparent. He clutched the panel bowing down over the console to shield his face from another deluge of sparks and with a thunderous sound he was thrown to the floor.</p>
<p>The Doctor raked at the sonic screwdriver toward himself that had been thrwon from his pocket and climbed to his feet. It would take a while for the ship to be ready to do anything and here he was again. Thrice he found himself in the same general area, same dull little London street. He made his way outside and found that at least this time he'd landed right side up. As he shut the door of the TARDIS, its blue police box camouflage appeared unharmed, unchanged. As it always was.</p>
<p>"What is wrong with you?" he wrapped on the side of the TARDIS. It was going to have to be left to repair itself. He turned back to survey the street. "What is it about this place—what's here, is it something I'm meant to see…" the Doctor extended the sonic screwdriver into the air and it chirped slowly. He brought it down to glance at the side of it and aimed it out at the line of flats ahead of him.</p>
<p>Crossing the street with the screwdriver extended in front of him, he checked the sign at on the side of the post boxes. It was quaint, short black iron fences guarded the windows with steps between them leading up to doors. He paced a portion of the sidewalk and glanced back. The detail in it was so small he didn't even notice at first. As the revelation washed over him, he fiddled with the screwdrivers top.</p>
<p>"Number Thirteen Grimmauld Place," he said before turning and pointing at the next address. "Number Eleven Grimmauld Place. Where's Number Twelve?" The Doctor glanced up at the side of the building. It was a numbering anomaly, not exactly unheard of. So why was the TARDIS sitting in the unusually large space between the two? He had seen this before; his own ship had something similar. His eyes flicked to the side to get a look at the building through his peripherals.</p>
<p>"There you are—right where no one is supposed to be looking—Number Twelve Grimmauld Place!" the Doctor charged up the newly revealed steps to the blue door with the gargoyle knocker. He gave the area a once over with the sonic screwdriver. "It's not the usual perception filter—definitely not Time Lord—doesn't even appear to be alien. Someone went through a lot of trouble to hide you," he slapped the screwdriver shut.</p>
<p>Craning his neck up, he surveyed the windows. "Looks old, but not deserted," there was a light on in the third floor. After a quick check of the watch he wore, he straightened his bowtie and gave the hem of his tweed jacket a tug. "July 31st, 2000—well then, let's see whose home," he said as he poised his fist to knock on the door.</p>
<hr/>
<p>A dull oscillating whir like a low, distant siren interrupted the festivities. It was the kind of sound that wouldn't have begged the attention of anyone else. Harry had ignored it at first too. When it broke the air the third time he was forced to hold a hand up to halt the celebration. Moments later there was an explosive crash that shook dust loose from unseen parts of the old flat.</p>
<p>In a blur of red hair and freckles, Ron and Ginny were at the window knocking their chairs away in the process. Harry pressed into the space allotted for him, jostling Ron to the side slightly in an attempt to catch sight of what had caused the sound. On the opposite sidewalk what looked to be a blue phone booth smoked and hissed. Above it a blue light blinked slowly.</p>
<p>There was a man in the street looking at something in his hand. He checked the street and talked to himself in a tone almost loud enough to be heard from their perch on the windowsill. Hermione took her time getting reaching them and pushed her way up under Ron to see. She was the first to speak.</p>
<p>"That's never been there before…I thought they stopped making them ages ago."</p>
<p>"Them? What is it?" asked Ron.</p>
<p>"A police box—I know you don't read anything, but you could at least bother to flip through a book and look at its pictures…" she trailed off.</p>
<p>As Ron and Hermione began to bicker, Harry kept his eyes on the man in the street. There was no one else in the lane, even at six in the evening.</p>
<p>The Muggles of Grimmauld Place had a knack for not noticing things—even things that were right in front of them, though this man was probably right there with them in that respect. He seemed absentminded; the way he flailed about the street with his flashing green stick. For a Muggle even, he was oddly dressed with the bowtie and pressed tweed jacket.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes strayed back to Ron and Hermione, the two of them now away from the window and into an open altercation. This was nothing serious or unusual—they'd only been doing it since they were eleven.</p>
<p>"Harry—"</p>
<p>Ginny's voice caused him to snap back to the window.</p>
<p>"Does he see the door?" she paused. The man in the lane turned to look directly at the door, he glanced up the side of Number Twelve taking it in. "He sees the bloody door."</p>
<p>It was silent. Harry's gaze whipped from the window, to her brown eyes and then back to Hermione and Ron. In a flash he was thundering through the upstairs drawing room and out the door into the narrow hall. He took the steps two at a time, drawing his wand. Behind him the footfalls of his companions could be heard clambering to follow him. He reached the last landing and ran the length of the hall out into the entry room. Checking the peep hole, he could see that the man had stalked closer and was unarmed. His long pale face was almost at the door now.</p>
<p>Harry threw the door open to find the man on the step with his fist raised to knock. Before he could say anything Harry aimed his wand into his chest. "Who are you?"</p>
<p>With a casual chuckle the man pushed the wand aside. "I'm the Doctor. Who are you—what kind of person goes around threatening people with twigs?"</p>
<p>Taken aback, Harry faltered his aim slightly. He could feel Hermione, Ginny and Ron behind him in the door now. "It's a wand," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Doctor?" Ron glanced at Hermione. "That one of them Muggle-nutters that goes around cutting on people?"</p>
<p>The Doctor pushed Harry's wand aside and flashed him with the little blinking light on a stick as if checking for something. "What kind of Doctor are you—and how did you see this place?" Harry asked lowering his wand.</p>
<p>"I just looked," he pocketed the small tool and glanced up at the flat. "Takes more than a simple perception filter to pull one over on me—though I am impressed. Year Two Thousand…where did you get that technology?"</p>
<p>"What's this loon talking about?" Ginny asked. "How can he see this place?"</p>
<p>He glanced to Ron and Ginny. "Gingers. Had a couple of ginger friends a while back—always wanted to be ginger myself," The Doctor paused backing away from the door to survey the apartment again. "Maybe next time…"</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione advanced out of the door, Ron took the threat of being dissected seriously and hung back. "There's spell used to disguise this place so that Muggles like you shouldn't be able to see it," Harry said.</p>
<p>"A what?" the Doctor said staring at him. "I'm not a Muggle. Muggle's a kind of plant farmed on the planet Clom, wait—how do you know about them?"</p>
<p>"What—no—a Muggle is what we call non-magical people. Humans," Hermione explained.</p>
<p>"Who says I'm human," the Doctor smiled, his lanky arms down at his sides. The prospect of magic didn't seem to strike him as odd in the least.</p>
<p>"If you're not human what are you?" asked Ron from the door.</p>
<p>"Time Lord."</p>
<p>"Time what?" said Ginny. "You look human to me."</p>
<p>"You look Time Lord—we were here first," the Doctor said making his way toward Hermione. He aimed the same blinking tool at her and plucked at the back of her bushel of brown hair examining each tendril as if it were his first time seeing hair. She clamped her arms down to her sides glancing at him nervously.</p>
<p>"What is that thing?" asked Harry.</p>
<p>"My wand," the Doctor said with a smile. He stepped away from Hermione staring at the side of the 'wand' and nodded. "Seemingly nothing abnormal about you lot…"</p>
<p>Hermione grimaced. "It doesn't look like any wand I've ever seen."</p>
<p>"Not really a wand—it's a sonic screwdriver. Okay then. Other than your obvious cover story about Muggles and Magic, how do you explain this elusive place?"</p>
<p>"S'not a cover story—it's really magic," said Ginny stepping into the lane with Ron.</p>
<p>The Doctor slipped the sonic screwdriver back into his pocket and ruffled her hair. "Sure it is. If you want to believe in such silly things, that's your business. A lot of people don't believe I exist," he paused. "But something inside of your flat its wreaking havoc on my TARDIS," he pointed back to the blue police box over his shoulder. "And I can't get out of here till I figure out what it is.</p>
<p>Before they could protest he was running for the door and dipped his head inside glancing around. "What's a TARDIS? And—hey, get out of there!" yelled Harry pulling him back.</p>
<p>"Mmm," the Doctor turned to him with a smile. "Smells like you're having custard and fish—they wouldn't happen to be in the same dish, now would they?"</p>
<hr/>
<p>Despite their protests, the Doctor couldn't be kept out of the flat. He finagled his way into the dining room, aiming the sonic screwdriver at any and everything that sounded the least bit odd. He scanned his way down the walls over lines of odd knickknacks and small devices. Inside the house smelled lived in, though it was clean there was the unmistakable odor of years long past.</p>
<p>The furniture, the carpets and the wall papering—it all seemed to be of another time. While most places were about modernization this flat looked like the Doctor could have found a hundred like it in the 1840s. As he surveyed the ornate ceiling light he finally spoke again:</p>
<p>"I never did get your names."</p>
<p>"What?" Ron asked.</p>
<p>The Doctor slipped the sonic screwdriver into his coat. "You know, your name—what you're called."</p>
<p>"He's Ron—I'm Hermione. Over there is Ginny and Harry's the one that owns this place," she explained pointing to them in turn.</p>
<p>The Doctor looked to Harry. "Harry, eh? You're a bit young to own a place like this—your parents out of town or something?"</p>
<p>"Haven't got parents anymore…"</p>
<p>Something in the tone that Harry used registered with the Doctor and he nodded slowly. "I see," he paused. "I'd better get to work—if you want me out of your hair anytime soon. Were you lot busy with—"</p>
<p>"It was Harry's birthday," Ginny cut across him with a harsh tone.</p>
<p>"I see—Ginny, was it?" the Doctor asked before muttering. "Ginny, Ginny—its like Ginger. Okay, well I'm sorry to intrude but I've got an angry Time Machine outside if I can't get the engines back in flux they're going to phase out. Do you know what happens then?"</p>
<p>"They cart you back to the loony-bin with the rest of the half-cocked nutters?" asked Ron.</p>
<p>"No," the Doctor said walking closer to Ron. "If we're lucky, the resulting explosion will just level London…"</p>
<p>"I see," said Ron.</p>
<p>Hermione pointed to the front door. "Let me get this sorted. That police box outside—that's a Time Machine?"</p>
<p>The Doctor nodded. "It's a TARDIS, but yes that's the long and short of it. The police box is just a disguise." He started back into the entry room and took a right into the hallway, they all followed.</p>
<p>"Hell of a disguise—Hermione claims those things don't exist anymore," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I've grown fond of it," the Doctor responded as he reached the stairs.</p>
<p>They moved up the stairs in a line, following him as he made his way into the drawing room. This was where he saw the light from the street and also happened to be the source of the fish and custard smell—though much to the Doctor's disappointment they two items were on separate serving plates.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, what are you looking for, Doctor?" asked Harry.</p>
<p>"Anything large enough or powerful enough to throw the TARDIS out of whack—I got ripped right out of orbit," he pantomimed something plummeting from the sky. "I'll know when I find it."</p>
<p>"And what are you a Doctor of—what's your name?" asked Hermione.</p>
<p>"I'm not a doctor of anything, just the Doctor—that's all," he explained. "I heard one of you mention magic a few times, usually magic is a more simplistic way of explaining high technology. Computers, telephones, cars—they look like magic to your ancestors. But whatever you're calling magic is probably just…"</p>
<p>Before he could finish Ginny drew her wand and with an upward flick of the wrist shouted an incantation. "Levicorpus!" the Doctor was flipped upside down and hoisted into the air as if he had been hooked to a string. He dangled, his lanky arms nearly dragging the carpet.</p>
<p>"Put me down! Down!" he grabbed for the screwdriver and curled his body to try and aim for his feet and then swung around to aim it at Ginny. But he couldn't make heads or tails of how to stop her.</p>
<p>Ron and Harry chuckled at her antic, but Hermione seemed upset about it. "Ginny that's enough," she said. "You could hurt him," silently she stepped forward with a quick wand movement, let him down. It was as if a rope holding him had been cut.</p>
<p>The Doctor sat up from the floor staring at Ginny as she stood with hands over her face to conceal her fit of giggles. "Well, I'd like to thank you for that demonstration, Ginny—I see that what you're calling magic seems to be extremely hard to spot as technology. But I've traveled a lot, several thousand star systems and thousands of periods of time—I've never come across magic that I could confirm was what it claimed to be," he said.</p>
<p>"Well you can be assured this is magic," Harry stated firmly.</p>
<p>"Yes. Well that aside, there must be something in this apartment that's causing the problem with the TARDIS—considering I've been in London several times I would guess its something relatively new…" the Doctor said.</p>
<p>Ginny sighed. "How can you really go all of these places and do all these things when you barely look older than me?"</p>
<p>"I told you, I'm a Time Lord—I'm so old I can't even keep track of it all because of the zipping back and forth between times and getting caught in alternate tangents…at last count I was nine hundred and four," he said.</p>
<p>"Bollocks," Ron muttered.</p>
<p>"We could at least try and help him, just in case he's telling the truth. It's no stranger than half of the things I've dealt with over the past nine years," Hermione said.</p>
<p>The Doctor short her a beaming smile. "Thank you bushy-haired-pretty-girl," he said.</p>
<p>"Hermione," she reminded him. "You said that it was something new to this place more than likely? What about one of the gifts—could it be messing with your TARDIS—Magic has been known to mess with electronics."</p>
<p>"Oh you're brilliant, I could kiss you!" the Doctor exclaimed.</p>
<p>Ron threw a possessive arm around her. "Yeah. Well don't," he said.</p>
<p>After a nod to Ron, the Doctor turned back to Harry. "So the gifts, where are they?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Over here, not opened yet," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Well then," the Doctor pulled a chair from under the table and dropped down into it with his arms dangling awkwardly at his sides. "The sooner we get this party finished, the sooner we can find out which of those boxes is causing the problem."</p>
<p>Reaching inside of his tweed coat, the Doctor produced a party hat which he then unfolded and strapped to his head.</p>
<p>"You carry that around on you all of the time, just in case?" asked Harry.</p>
<p>"Yeah, jackets bigger on the inside," the Doctor said giving the breast pockets a quick pat. "Now, where were we?"</p>
