    <p>.</p><p> </p><p>It’s embarrassing how long it takes for him to realize what’s happening. Tom has spent his early years exiled from the orphanage’s fragile pack, kept company by snakes that change with the seasons. As fond as he is of them, Tom knows his serpentine companions are a poor substitute—snakes don’t have packs, after all. He’s had little practice with pack bonds.</p><p>So, for a long while, he doesn’t understand why he lets Lucretia drag him to meals. Or why he—despite being from a different house—has a standing invitation to stay in Ignatius’s dorm when Dolohov and Malfoy are particularly unbearable. Tom doesn’t understand why he seeks them out to rant about Dumbledore’s biases. Why he lets them help with his experiments.</p><p>But—it’s nice. The pack bond isn’t like he thought it would be. Tom doesn’t feel trapped or collared, doesn’t feel like he has to hide away the sharper parts of himself. He can exist as Tom Riddle in full, and that—</p><p>It settles his need to draw blood for every slight. Swallows up the desire to sink his claws into people and carve out a place for himself in them. Lets him keep his attention on things that actually interest him.</p><p>He’ll let the bond grow, for now.</p><p> </p><p>.</p>
