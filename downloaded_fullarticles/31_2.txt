    <p>"I loathe Scorpius Malfoy with every ounce of my being!" Rose shouted as she walked into her dormitory.</p><p>Her best friend Sarah rolled her eyes. "What did he do this time?"</p><p>"In Care of Magical Creatures, he made fun of me for being scared of the Jarvey!"</p><p>Sarah snorted, "You were afraid of a Jarvey?"</p><p>"They are so rude! Besides, the Ministry of Magic classified it as a level three!"</p><p>Sarah was used to Rose complaining about Malfoy.  The two teens had a bitter relationship since first year, when Rose quickly became every professor's favorite student. Rose was the smartest in her year; she was told she had her mom's intelligence, but also could be very fiery when she was angry like her dad. At first Scorpius started with the teasing and poking fun at her, but over the years it turned to insults. And Rose fought with him right back. Scorpius was her cousin's Albus's best friend. Albus was disappointed that they didn't get along, but he dealt with it.</p><p>Rose plopped down on her bed and unpacked her homework. Even though it was Friday night, Rose liked to get a head start on essays. However, she didn't get the chance to begin, because her cousin Lily burst into the room.</p><p>"Rose, did you forget? We are supposed to have family dinner tonight!"</p><p>Rose groaned, "Do I have to come? It's stupid we are having it on Friday anyways."</p><p>Lily came and grabbed her arm. "Yes you have to come, we all decided that today would work better. And Dominique is bringing her new boyfriend, so that should be interesting!"</p><p>Rose was really close with my younger cousin, almost as close as she was with Albus. Lily was sweet and bubbly, very rare to see her without a smile, and she often skipped down the corridors.</p><p>"She hadn't told me she had a new boyfriend?" Rose asked. Dom was in Gryffindor with her and shared the dormitory with her. She usually told Rose everything. Ever since Dom turned 14, she had become boy crazy. Now that they were in their fifth year, she had a new boy every couple weeks.</p><p>Rose looked at Sarah, who just shrugged her shoulders. Sarah had no idea she had a new boyfriend either.</p><p>"I think he's a sixth year," said Lily. "Want to come Sarah? We can meet this mystery guy."</p><p>"No thanks, I'm not hungry."</p><p>Rose raised her eyebrows at Sarah, but Sarah buried herself in the magazine she was reading.</p><p>Rose knew the real reason she didn't want to come was because she had a crush on Albus. Lately she couldn't be around him without getting flustered; about every day in class.</p><p>"Your loss, come on Lil. Let's go eat with the family."</p><p>When we got down there, most of the family was already sitting down and chatting. We tried to get together every Sunday for dinner; and idea from Nana Weasley. Rose's older cousins, James and Fred, were throwing grapes at Roxy. Lucy and Jack were practicing charms on each other while Perry and Louis watched in awe. Rose slid onto the bench next to Albus and Hugo.</p><p>"Hugo, how did you do on your potions exam?" Rose asked. Hugo's cheeks started to turn red.</p><p>"I tried, I really did! But I kept getting names mixed up! How am I supposed to remember like 20 names of dead people, it was hard!"</p><p>"It's alright Hu," said Fred, "I don't remember names well either. In fact...which cousin are you again?"</p><p>Hugo reached across the table and punched Fred in the arm. James was shoveling his food in his mouth when his eyes grew wide. Rose glanced around to see what caused his reaction when she saw it. Dominique was walking towards us with a boy on her arm.</p><p>"No way," said Al, "Is that-"</p><p>"Solderini." sneered James.</p><p>"Solderini? The Slytherin captain?" Rose asked, "As in the one who is keeping Al from trying out for the team?"</p><p>"That's the one," grimaced Al. "But isn't he a seventh year?" </p><p>Rose looked at Dom who was gleaming. She looked perfect as usually, with her strawberry blond hair, and shining blue eyes. She seemed very pleased with herself being on the arm of a seventh year. "Hi guys! This is my boyfriend, Blaine," she said brightly. </p><p>The only one who spoke up was Lily.</p><p>"Hello Blaine, I'm Dom's cousin Lily." Blaine gave her a look of disgust, followed by a simple nod. It was then that they all decided that they hated him.</p><p>Dom started introducing the family one at a time to her boyfriend, but it was obvious he could care less what our names were. Then she and Blaine sat a little way away from the family all so they could eat privately. James turned to the rest.</p><p>"Out of all the boys in school, she had to pick him?"</p><p>"Be quiet James!" scolded Lily, "You don't want Dom to hear. I don't like him either, but if Dom likes him, we will give him a chance. Or at least put up with him."</p><p>Dominique giggled very loudly, making James violently stab his steak with his fork. "You don't know him Lil, he's bad news."</p><p>Rose turned to look at Blaine and Dom. He had his arm around her and was whispering in her ear. Dom was hanging on to every word he said. It was obvious she was head over heels for this guy, which was odd. Usually with Dom, the veela part of her made the boys obsessed with her. </p><p>After dinner, the family started heading to our separate common rooms. Rose was heading up the stairs with Lily, James, Fred, and Hugo when she remembered she forgot to get the book she needed for class.</p><p>"You guys go ahead, I have to stop at the library real quick!" Rose said. </p><p>Fred shook his head, "Rosie, Rosie. When are you ever not at the library?" She rolled my eyes.</p><p>"I just need to grab a book for my transfiguration homework. It'll be like five minutes," and she sprinted off towards the library. After a while of searching, Rose found the book she needed... on the very top shelf. Rose was relatively short, so she was forced to get the stool so she could reach. Rose pulled it down and started flipping through the pages when she heard the cold, sniveling voice that ruined her night in an instance.</p><p>"Well, well. If it isn't Weasley."</p>
