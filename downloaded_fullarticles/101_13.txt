          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Harry.”</p>
<p>Oh, Merlin. He loved that voice. Harry loved everything about it. He would give anything to hear that voice for the rest of his life. “Yes, Tom?” His words were drawn out, teasingly. </p>
<p>“What are you doing on the floor, idiot? Get up; it’s dirty.” Tom stood over him, arms crossed, bent over slightly so his head could tilt down comfortably. His hair fell, framing his face with soft curls. Tom would never admit it, but he was definitely smiling, and it was definitely fantastic. </p>
<p>Harry’s hands were thrown across his stomach, a grin stretching ear to ear, and a plan forming quickly in his brain. He sighed dramatically and batted his lashes, “Alright fine. Help me up?” Harry lazily reached up, waiting for Tom’s firm grip. Tom gave a silent huff, but his eyes had a knowing gleam. He grabbed Harry’s hand and didn’t get much farther when Harry suddenly latched on and yanked him downward. Harry fought the good fight and was still overtaken.</p>
<p>Both his wrists were held down by Tom’s hands. It didn’t help that Harry was significantly shorter than Tom and as much as he protested and shat on the height difference, he would be lying if he said it didn’t make his heart race. Their quick, uneven breaths mingled together. Harry was struck, staring at Tom’s face, admiring it and only snapping out of the trance after Tom gave in to a shared overwhelming urge to kiss his lover. His mouth deliberately pressing down onto Harry’s, licking and teeth tugging on his bottom lip until Harry was squirming. Protesting Tom’s unfair hold with useless yanks and muffled moaning complaints.</p>
<p>The kiss was long, drawn-out. Messy. Just the kind Tom says he hates but is always the one to start. They had relaxed into the embrace, and after a while, Harry’s lips escaped. He lightly dragged them across Tom’s cheek, stretching up to trace Tom’s jaw. Then down and down and down, stopping on Tom’s neck. He kissed and sucked carefully. Patiently. And if there was one thing Harry could never be for long, it was patient. Tom was quick to catch on.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Harry was surprised to hear Tom speak up so suddenly. His voice was wavering, Harry’s attention obviously having an effect. But the question was ignored as Harry continued, one hand finally eluding Tom’s hold to slip down Tom’s side and toy with the edge of his shirt. </p>
<p>Tom’s body was warm as Harry’s hand splayed out on his abdomen. Tom’s shirt followed Harry’s hand upward as his lips were continuing their attention to Tom’s neck. Harry’s unhurried touch stopped when he had reached the centre of Tom’s chest.</p>
<p>Harry couldn’t help but pause entirely. Tom’s heart, a steady, constant beat. He could feel it against his palm. Tom sighed, “Harry, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Harry hadn’t realised he was holding his breath until it all came expelling out of him, “Do you have to go on this trip?” Harry fell limp to the floor. His head turned to stare at the legs of their old flat couch. He could feel his mouth moving, saying the words but couldn’t hear them.</p>
<p>Tom stared at the side of Harry’s face for a long moment then gripped and moved Harry’s jaw to maintain eye contact, “I told you already, it’s important. I have to.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you can’t send anyone else?” Harry could feel his face scrunch up, a grimace probably filling his features. He was never good at hiding his emotions. Not like Tom.</p>
<p>“No, Harry. We’ve been over this before. I have to be there. It can only be me.” Tom did an excellent job hiding his exasperation, but Harry could see it the moment Tom closed his mouth. The thin line there at the limits of its patience. </p>
<p>“Right,” Harry didn’t know what else to say. He didn’t like the idea of Tom leaving him. This business trip seemed unnecessary. They all did.</p>
<p>“Harry, this isn’t fair. You know I wouldn’t go if I had a choice.” Tom’s palm held Harry’s cheek, and it was such a shame that Harry could see in Tom’s eye that he meant it. He meant every word. It was so much harder to stay mad at him when he was so sincere like this. </p>
<p>“I don’t know, this isn’t right. Maybe I’m just crazy. Something feels off about this one.” Harry felt Tom adjust his weight and reach for Harry’s hand, holding it gently, thumb carefully tracing his knuckles. </p>
<p>“You worry too much.” Tom brought Harry’s hand up to his lips and gave Harry’s fingers a mollifying kiss. “I love you.”</p>
<p>Harry’s fears were pushed aside. Tom was here. In front of him. Loving him. “I love you too, Tom.”</p>
<p>They stood up, Harry genuinely accepting Tom’s help. He felt heavier. As if the weight of the conversation had suddenly gathered up and on to Harry’s shoulders. The trip wasn’t going to take itself, and their love session on the carpet wasn’t the smartest plan if they wanted Tom returning as fast as possible.</p>
<p>The exchange of goodbyes was solemn. Neither wanting to part ways, but Harry stayed strong. He saw Tom Apparate off and made a quiet dinner for one. Looking forward to attempting to sleep off the days until Tom returned home. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry didn’t realise how badly he would need this rest for weeks to come. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He woke up; Tom wasn’t in bed. It took him a moment to remember that Tom was still away. In his defence, Harry was never really a morning person. In his defence, Tom should have been home yesterday. </p>
<p>But today he had woken up, still alone, and the Muggle alarm clock on Tom’s bedside table was a stable bright-red reading 07:12. Harry never woke up before 09:00, so this was unusual. He didn’t realise his Floo was going off (probably what woke him to begin with) until what was most likely the eighth: “HARRY JAMES POTTER. ANSWER THIS DAMN FLOO THIS INSTANT OR I AM GETTING A WARRANT FROM THE AURORS TO TEAR THE WARDS DOWN.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s voice promised the wrath of gods and Harry wasn’t one to deny her. </p>
<p>His Floo flared to life when he finally opened it, Hermione stepped out with all the grace of a newborn foal. Head to toe covered in soot, panic in her eyes and a frown on her face he hadn’t seen since N.E.W.T. year.</p>
<p>Any humour he’d felt quickly withered away at the sight. </p>
<p>“Harry, I’ve been trying to reach you all morning— have you seen the news?” Hermione took one full glance of him and shook her head, “No. I suppose you haven’t.” She flicked her wand, summoning The Daily Prophet, shoving it into his hands. He didn’t have his glasses on but didn’t need them to feel the intensity of this bad news. </p>
<p>“It’s finally happened, Harry. That rising Dark Lord in Russia has made his move. He had help from the Turkish President of Magic and their Magical Council of Ministers; they took everything over from their borders, to Austria, and to Greece. They’ve been planting Wizards and Witches for well over a year and working in tandem with localised Creature groups who support their cause.”</p>
<p>“Wait-wait! Hermione slow down, slow down. What does this mean for us? What’s happened that has you panicking?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Harry… don’t tell me you don’t know where Albania is.”</p>
<p>Harry went to speak but found his voice missing. He could hear The Daily Prophet rustle and tear from his grip. But his eyes were stuck on Hermione’s instant wince of regret, the conviction in her eyes keeping him grounded for all of three seconds. He could practically hear her mantras of at least he heard it from me.</p>
<p>Abruptly his heart hurt. He felt like dry heaving. A pounding headache had started. His mouth was open in slight disbelief; Harry could feel his body going numb and the acidic burn of nausea creeping in him. His eyes were watering. The irritation of not blinking them and forcing himself to squint at Hermione for so long to keep her in focus had mixed at some point. </p>
<p>Harry didn’t even flinch when she wrapped her arms tight around him, it was almost like he knew it was coming, his arms immediately holding her close. An automatic response.</p>
<p>Hermione started again, slowly, carefully selecting her words, “They’ve erected wide-scale Anti-Apparition Wards. It’s an elaborate use of powerful runestones and a type of–well what I can only relate to Muggle Batteries. Something they’ve developed to hold incredibly copious amounts of Magic with little to no Core draining affects on any one individual. Wizarding Batteries. An ingenious piece of Magic and something to truly be admired if it wasn’t being used to imprison multiple countries currently.”</p>
<p>“You’re rambling…” Harry mumbled, not unkindly, shock settling in and paving the way for denial. “He can make it out of this. It’s Tom we’re talking about. There’s no way some stupid Dark Lord with a plan can stop him. You were both brightest of our age. He’s Undersecretary.”</p>
<p>He could feel Hermione shaking in his grasp, “H-harry… they’ve been killing off foreign dignitaries. They-um, they’re making a terrifying political statement. They’ve…” Her choked cries we’re breaking through, but he could fill in those blanks with his active imagination just fine.</p>
<p>He broke down.</p>
<p>Sobs wracked through his body, jostling Hermione in their sudden wake. He could do nothing but sink to his knees and hold tight around her smaller frame, terrified of the possibility that Tom—</p>
<p>Tom wasn’t alive?</p>
<p>His voice was raw when he finally released Hermione to let her Floo Call the Ministry. The wait was excruciatingly painful. Harry couldn’t take his eyes off the carpet he and Tom were on the day he left. He couldn’t stop all of the thoughts running rampant in his head. Telling him to grab his wand and Incendio the flat so he wouldn’t have to look at it, anything to stop the regret of not forcing Tom to stay. </p>
<p>It’s odd what thoughts would do to a person. Harry couldn’t think of anything but that carpet until mere seconds ago. And now he was trying to rack his brain for an answer to a simple question. </p>
<p>Did I tell him I love him one more time before he Apparated?</p>
<p>Hermione’s voice was calm and quiet, soothing to listen to. Even when she was “regretfully informed” that yes, Tom Riddle, youngest Undersecretary to date was, in fact, one of the few foreign dignitaries that had “unfortunately” been taken. She was calm and quiet while insisting she gets sent half-hour updates and any emergency information as soon as possible. Calm and quiet while reassuring Harry that there was no sign of a publicly executed Tom Riddle and of course there wouldn’t be. </p>
<p>“Harry, that son of a Witch best me by one N.E.W.T. and I would never let him live it down in the afterlife if a little bit of impressive Magic could hold him back. He’s too cocky to let that happen.”</p>
<p>Harry’s laugh was a shocked gasp of air from a sorrow-filled face, “Thanks, ‘Mione.”</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t sure if he said that or had thought it, but Hermione’s soft look of understanding made him believe he was close enough. He wasn’t sure of anything. But she sat on the couch by his side through all the unsure everything. He stared at her, and it felt like hours had gone by before he said,</p>
<p>“I knew something was wrong the day he left, you know?” She slowly started shaking her head, knowing her she was probably prepared to do whatever it takes to stop him from blaming himself.</p>
<p>Too late.</p>
<p>“This was never right.” Harry’s hand gripped his hair, clutching the side of his head, his eyes hurt from crying and shutting them closed so tightly. He could see spots. Everything wouldn’t stop pounding. “I knew something was wrong. He shouldn’t have gone on that trip. This was never right. I should have stopped him.”</p>
<p>He took a long breath and released it slowly.</p>
<p>“I’m going to Albania.”</p></div>
