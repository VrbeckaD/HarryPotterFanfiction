    <p>The thing is, Percy knows that he’s the odd man out.</p><p> </p><p>His older brothers? Both incredibly famous and talented. The twins? The jokers of the family - how could anyone forget them? The twin terrors would definitely make their presences known to anybody and everybody. Ron is the best friend with Harry fucking Potter of all people, and his wife is the most intelligent witch of her generation. Ginny is a famous Quidditch star, and she’s the first female Weasley in generations. </p><p> </p><p>But what about Percy? </p><p> </p><p>He’s the black sheep. He isn’t talented like Bill, Charlie, or Ginny and he isn’t best friends with the Wizarding World’s Saviour nor is he mischevious. He’s just… Percy. </p><p> </p><p>Well, Percy supposes, he does have one thing going for him. </p><p> </p><p>He’s in a polyamorous relationship. </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, he doesn’t believe it either. Still doesn’t believe it; sometimes, he thinks he’s in a fever dream. He dreads the day he’ll wake because this is the happiest he’s been in his entire life. </p><p> </p><p>He doesn’t speak with his family, not really. He and Charlie owl each other whenever they get around to it, but the talk is superficial. There’s nothing of substance in their letters. Their relationship is damaged, but it’s the only familial relationship he has left, so Percy is desperate to keep it. He can’t lose Charlie, he just can’t. </p><p> </p><p>Penny is in the States on business with Audrey; Oliver and Marcus are at Quidditch practise for their respective teams. Their house is chaotic - having five people who like five different Quidditch teams. Well, Percy is lukewarm about the Chudley Cannons, but it’s a neutral topic to write Charlie about. So he keeps up with them. </p><p> </p><p>Their house is in the middle of nowhere; just how they all like it. Percy still has his flat in London and Audrey hers in New York City, but the apartments aren’t lived in. The flats are primarily used for storage and for hiding gifts. </p><p> </p><p>His mum would be proud of him; he’s taken up knitting due to Audrey. He had asked her one day to teach him, and Percy has been hooked ever since. They like to knit a variety of things, though Percy won’t knit sweaters. It’s too painful and brings up a lot of unwanted memories and emotions. Instead, they’ll knit blankets, gloves, socks, beanies, and other similar items. Just not sweaters. Never sweaters. </p><p> </p><p>He sighs, leaning against the kitchen counter. It’s a large kitchen, bigger than the one at the Burrow anyhow. There’s two of everything - one for meat and one for dairy. Audrey is Jewish, and it is important for her to have separate areas to keep kosher. She’d like to raise her children as Jewish, she told them four of them one-day several months ago. No one objected; in fact, Marcus had jumped on the opportunity to confide in them that he wanted to convert. Audrey had been overjoyed. </p><p> </p><p>Percy thinks about it, converting to Judaism. He wasn’t raised religiously, not like Penny was. Oliver had been more culturally Catholic than anything else, and besides, that man is far too interested in Quidditch to be concerned about religion. </p><p> </p><p>He has a mental note to ask Audrey if he could meet with her Rabbi, but he’ll ask about that once she and Penny get back from the States. He doesn’t think it would be appropriate to owl her about this. </p><p> </p><p>He supposes he could ask Marcus once he got home, since Audrey’s Rabbi is now his Rabbi, but he’d rather bring it up to his wife. </p><p> </p><p>He hasn’t mentioned to Charlie that he’s married, but the topic of relationships has never come up in their letters, so he supposes it doesn’t matter. How would he even bring up the fact that he is married, not to mention the fact that he’s also dating other people. Yeah, it’s not a topic he wants to bring up. </p><p> </p><p>They all wear rings; Percy has a simple band embedded with the birthstones of each of his partners. It’s elegant; Percy is really fond of it. He wears it everywhere. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a tap on the window, bringing Percy out of his thoughts. He realizes that he was subconsciously playing with his wedding band. He blushes, though he has no reason too. It’s his ring; he’s allowed to play with it whenever and wherever he pleases. </p><p> </p><p>The owl is tapping the kitchen window again, and Percy swears that the bird looks impatient. It dawns on him that this owl is Charlie’s, and the realization makes his blood run cold. He loves his brother, he does, but he’s always a nervous wreck whenever his older brother sends him an owl. It could be the last letter he will ever receive from the last member of his family that still speaks with him. Percy doesn’t know how he would react to that, if Charlie decides he doesn’t want to speak with the black sheep of the Weasley family. </p><p> </p><p>He opens the window, allowing the owl to enter the kitchen. Percy turns around to the treat jar the five of them keep around for this exact situation. He gives the owl one, then he takes the letter. He opens it. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Percy,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> My dragons burnt me (again), and I had to be taken to the nearest hospital. After the healers healed me, I was allowed to go home to my babies. I love them, don’t get me wrong, but I’m dealing with a rather aggressive breed of dragons right now.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> But enough of that. By the time you’ve received this letter, I’ll be back at the Burrow. I’m home for two weeks while on mandated leave from work.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I want to meet with you, face-to-face. Not at the Burrow, but I was thinking at your flat. I won’t tell mum or the others that I’m meeting with you, don’t worry. Though you should probably send mum a letter soon. She worries about you.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Hopefully see you soon,  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Charlie </em>
</p><p> </p><p>He stares dumbfoundedly at the letter in his hands. Charlie wants to meet with him? Oh no, this won’t do. He’s in the middle of thinking of a reason as to why he can’t meet up when Oliver Floo’s into their living room. </p><p> </p><p>Their eyes meet, and Oliver smiles. He’s a sweaty mess; there’s dirt and blood smeared onto his face and clothes. </p><p> </p><p>Percy sets the letter down on the counter next to the treat jar, “Are you alright?” he asks as he walks towards his lover. Oliver laughs. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine. Practise was rougher than usual today.” </p><p> </p><p>Percy isn’t convinced, and he tells Oliver so as he grabs his hand and leads him to their bedroom. Technically, the bedroom belongs to the five of them, having a California king size bed in the middle, which covers the two windows. They each have their own room, but this bedroom’s ensuite is the nicest of the house, which is why Percy decided to drag Oliver there. </p><p> </p><p>“Strip,” he says as he turns the water on hot. When he looks back, Oliver is already shirtless and is working on his pants. Percy takes three strides towards him, gently grabbing Oliver’s face and then kissing him. It feels weird to Percy to initiate intimacy, but he knows that he’s allowed to do so. </p><p> </p><p>Oliver breaks the kiss, and he’s smiling like a fool when the redhead opens his eyes. “I like where this is going,” is what Oliver says, “Want to have some fun in this shower?” </p><p> </p><p>It’s Percy’s turn to smile now, “Yes.” </p><p> </p><p>~ </p><p> </p><p>After they get done with their shower, Percy casts a quick healing spell on Oliver’s busted lip and bloody nose. He should have done that first, he knows. Oliver tells him he worries too much, and Percy tells him that he doesn’t worry enough. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you want some tea?” Percy asks, already knowing the answer. Oliver never turns down tea. </p><p> </p><p>Oliver doesn’t respond at first, instead, he smiles and runs from the bathroom, yelling, “I’ll race you!” </p><p> </p><p>Percy jogs after him, not really putting his heart into it. He’s not the active type, though he’ll amuse his lovers when it comes to things like this. </p><p> </p><p>Percy enters the kitchen, only to see Marcus holding the letter and handing it to Oliver. The redhead kicks himself mentally, how could he forget about Charlie’s letter? He can’t get out of discussing it now. </p><p> </p><p>Marcus sees him first, “Your brother sent you a letter.” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Percy says, “I know. I let his owl in.” </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be smart. You gonna meet up with him?” </p><p> </p><p>Percy is prepared to say <em> no, I’m not </em>when Oliver exclaims, “Of course he is! Invite him here Perce, not at your flat. When are you gonna get rid of that flat anyway?” </p><p> </p><p>“Audrey still has hers,” he says defensively, hoping to change the topic. </p><p> </p><p>It doesn’t work. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, hers is in America - land of the free and home of the brave. And nice try trying to change this topic.” </p><p> </p><p>Percy sighs, running his hand through his hair, “I’d really rather not. I like our relationship as it is now.” </p><p> </p><p>Marcus scoffs, “Of course you’d say that. Invite him over.” </p><p> </p><p>“No.” </p><p> </p><p>Marcus looks offended, “You ashamed of us or something?” </p><p> </p><p>Oliver looks at Marcus, and then at Percy but doesn’t say anything. </p><p> </p><p>Percy takes a step in their direction, “No, never,” he takes a deep breath. He does not want to have this conversation, “Charlie is the only relative that still speaks with me. I don’t want to mess that up by meeting with him.” </p><p> </p><p>“Is that what you’re worried about?” Oliver says sympathetically. He hands the letter back to Marcus and walks to Percy. He takes Percy’s hands in his own, grasping them. “Perce, there’s nothing to worry about. Charlie loves you. You’re his brother.”</p><p> </p><p>“So’s Fred,” Marcus retorts, “Just ‘cause they’re brothers doesn’t mean that there’s love between them.” </p><p> </p><p>Oliver glares over his shoulder, hissing, “<em>Shut up Flint.” </em> Before turning his attention back to Percy. It’s always amused the redhead that Marcus and Oliver refer to each other with their surnames. Marcus used to refer to Percy as <em> Weasley, </em> up until Percy and Audrey eloped. Marcus still sometimes says <em> Weasley </em>when referring to Percy, but Audrey has taken up the habit of answering when Marcus does that. </p><p> </p><p>“Perce, Perce,” Oliver says softly, “Charlie <em> loves </em>you. Why else would he owl you after your family went no contact with you?” </p><p> </p><p>Percy looks away and says softly, “To lure me into a false sense of security.” </p><p> </p><p>Oliver takes Percy’s face into his hands, kissing him and then saying, “He’s not like the twins. He won’t do that to you.” </p><p> </p><p>He’s aware of Marcus moving behind Oliver, and then he’s aware of Marcus’s strong hands on his waist. Marcus bites Percy’s ear, causing him to gasp. Oliver takes that opening to gently bite his neck. </p><p> </p><p>Marcus’s voice is low, “let us make you forget about this, at least for a short while.” </p><p> </p><p>Oliver laughs, “Speak for yourself Flint. Unlike you, I’m not quick.” He kisses Percy deeply, “<em>Strip.”  </em></p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>Penny would have a fit if she knew that they had sex in the kitchen; luckily for the three men, she’s currently not in the country. Marcus looks pleased with himself; Percy thinks he deserves too. Oliver is laying naked on the tile floor, a silly grin on his face. “Perce?” </p><p> </p><p>Percy is putting his underwear back on. He doesn’t like being nude; it’s something he hasn’t confessed to his lovers, though he suspects that they know, considering how quickly he covers himself up after being in the shower or after having sex. </p><p> </p><p>“Want help writing that letter?” Oliver asks as he sits up.</p><p> </p><p><em> He has to be cold, </em>the redhead thinks. </p><p> </p><p>Percy thinks about Oliver’s question. Does he want help? On one hand, he is an adult and writing a letter to Charlie shouldn’t be that hard. He just has to say, <em> sure, come on over at x o’clock. </em>On the other hand, Percy has no idea how to write that letter. “Please,” he eventually says. </p><p> </p><p>Marcus, having dressed, walks wordlessly out of the kitchen. Oliver whistles as he walks by; Marcus glances back over his shoulder and smirks. </p><p> </p><p>Oliver stands, stretching. He looks fantastic, Merlin, all of Percy’s lovers look drop-dead gorgeous. Why Audrey agreed to marry him, and why the other three asked to date him, Percy would never know. </p><p> </p><p>Marcus slaps Percy’s ass, signalling his return to the kitchen. He and Oliver laugh; Percy yelps, blushing like mad. He doesn’t know why Marcus does that, and a part of him wishes he would stop, but there’s a larger part of Percy that wants Marcus to do it more often. </p><p> </p><p>The Slytherin sets down two pages of paper and a pen down on the kitchen island. “So Griffendork, do you know what you wanna say?” </p><p> </p><p><em> Yes, I don’t want him coming over. </em>But he doesn’t say that; instead, Percy steps beside Marcus and looks blankly at the pages of paper. “Why are there two?” </p><p> </p><p>“One for your brother,” he says, pointing to the first sheet. He then points to the second sheet, “one for our ladies. Gotta keep them in the loop.” </p><p> </p><p>Oliver, now standing, slaps Marcus’s back, causing the taller man to grunt. “How thoughtful Flint. Didn’t know you had that in you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off,” Marcus says without any heat. The two look at Percy, who still doesn’t know how to tell his lovers that he changed his mind and that he doesn’t want to meet his older brother. </p><p> </p><p>Oliver’s eyes are soft, as is his voice as he speaks, “Perce, babe, I can hear you thinking.” </p><p> </p><p>Percy blinks, “I - I -” he starts but can’t finish. Marcus lays his hand on his shoulder. With his other hand, he hands the redhead the pen. </p><p> </p><p>“Just write what I say.” It’s a brilliant idea; now, Percy won’t have to think about what he has to write. He’ll just write what Marcus will say, and that will be that. </p><p> </p><p>Percy copies word-for-word what Marcus says. The message isn’t long; it’s straight to the point. “I don’t want him using the Floo,” Percy tells him. Marcus raises his eyebrow but doesn’t ask him why. “He can use our front door.” </p><p> </p><p>“Using the <em> front door?” </em> Oliver says, mockingly. “Why Perce, we’re wizards! We don’t use the front door!” </p><p> </p><p>“If he doesn’t want his brother using our Floo, his brother isn’t using our Floo.” Percy is greatly appreciative of the fact that the Slytherin is here helping him write this Merlin-forsaken letter to his brother. If it was just Oliver, Percy would have folded and allowed Charlie to use the Floo.</p><p> </p><p>Oliver throws his hands in the air, but stays quiet. </p><p> </p><p>Marcus takes the pen from Percy’s hand, and takes the letter with him as he strides towards Esdras, Percy’s owl, who is in the living room with the other owls. Oliver hugs Percy from behind, resting his chin on his shoulder. “Shouldn’t we write the letter to the girls now?” </p><p> </p><p>Marcus rolls up the letter and attaches it to Esdras’s leg, then he answers, “I’ll write it. You two go to bed. I’ll be up there in a minute.” </p><p> </p><p>Percy doesn’t resist as Oliver takes him by his hand and leads him to the master bedroom. </p><p> </p><p>~ </p><p>Percy is a nervous wreck the next day, up until there’s a knock on their front door shortly after dinner. Oliver nudges him forward, “Go on,” he whispers, “we’re right here.” Percy takes one last glance at his lovers, then looks straight ahead and heads for the door. He takes a deep breath, then opens it. </p><p> </p><p>True to his word, Charlie is there alone. He still looks the same, the same way Percy remembers him. He gives Percy a smile, “Hey little brother. Can I come in?” </p><p> </p><p>Percy blushes, “Of course,” he says as he steps aside. </p><p> </p><p>Charlie walks him, stopping when he sees Oliver and Marcus. Oliver beams, running over to Charlie and stopping right in front of the former Quidditch player, “Charlie! It’s great to see you again. How’ve you been?” </p><p> </p><p>“Let Percy ask those questions Wood.” </p><p> </p><p>“No, no. It’s fine,” Charlie tells Marcus. Percy comes up from behind his brother and stops beside him. Charlie turns his head, and looks at his younger brother. “You never mentioned that you had roommates.” </p><p> </p><p>“It never came up,” is what Percy says. There’s a look that comes across his brother’s face, though the younger Weasley can’t figure out what the look means. </p><p> </p><p>He’s taller than Charlie, though not by much. Still, it’s enough that he has to literally look down at his older brother. Charlie changes the topic, “How are you Percy? I heard from dad that you quit the ministry.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m well, thank you for asking. The ministry just wasn’t what I thought it was.” </p><p> </p><p>“Percy,” Charlie looks him in the eye, “don’t be so formal with me.” </p><p> </p><p>Percy sighs, “I really am well Charlie.” He brings his hand to his face to push up his glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Charlie’s eyes lock onto Percy’s wedding ring. <em> Fuck. </em>He should have expected this. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re married?” Charlie sounds hurt, but his younger brother chooses not to address his tone of voice. It would bring up too many unwanted emotions. </p><p> </p><p>“I am. I’m also dating three other people.” There. Might as well get it out in the open. </p><p> </p><p>Charlie laughs loudly, “That’s the first time I’ve heard you joke Percy.” </p><p> </p><p>Oliver chips in, “It’s not a joke Charlie. He’s dating us,” he gestures to Marcus, “We’re also dating Penny. You might remember her as Penelope.” </p><p> </p><p>Charlie tilts his head in what Percy assumes is confusion. “Penelope Clearwater?” Percy nods his head. “Are you being serious? You’re having an affair?” </p><p> </p><p>Percy knows the meeting was a mistake, “Don’t say it like that, it’s not an <em> affair. </em>It’s a polyamorous relationship. I married Audrey so she could become a British citizen faster. She’s American.” </p><p> </p><p>Charlie blinks, “You’re serious, aren’t you? You’re actually dating three people <em> while </em>married?” </p><p> </p><p>Percy doesn’t get the chance to respond as Penny and Audrey come through the Floo. Charlie starts walking towards the women. “Penelope,” he says once he reaches them, “it’s been a while.” He turns to Audrey, “You must be my brother’s wife.” He sticks out his hand; the redhead shakes it. “I’m Charlie. You’re brother-in-law.” </p><p> </p><p>Audrey smiles, “I’m Audrey Weasley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Percy has told me that you work with dragons?”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s right,” Charlie exclaims, a little too loudly for his brother’s comfort. Percy bites his lip to hold in a groan; he should have told her to not bring up his work. “I’m on medical leave for about two weeks, so I decided to come home.” </p><p> </p><p>“Medical leave?” She raises an eyebrow, “that can’t be good.” Penny gestures for Marcus to come over, and he does. She hands him her bags. </p><p> </p><p>“Put those away for me?” she asks him sweetly. Marcus sighs dramatically, but does what he was asked. He stops and kisses Percy on his way to Penny’s room. Charlie watches as they kiss. </p><p> </p><p>“Can I talk to you alone Percy?” </p><p> </p><p><em> No, “ </em>Yes.” </p><p> </p><p>Charlie nods, “Is there a place where we can talk?” If Percy didn’t know better, he’d say that his brother looks nervous. But this is Charlie; he never gets nervous. </p><p> </p><p>“Follow me.” </p><p> </p><p>Percy can feel his loves’s eyes on them as they walk to his bedroom. They pass by Marcus on their way, who ruffles his hair as he walks by. </p><p> </p><p>They reach the last door of the hallway. Percy opens the door and walks in; Charlie follows suit. </p><p> </p><p>“Neat as ever little brother.” </p><p> </p><p>He’s right. Percy keeps his room in perfect order. He and Penny try to keep the house in order, but the other three like to leave their clothes, their dishes, and whatever else everywhere. </p><p> </p><p>It’s an ongoing argument between them. </p><p> </p><p>Charlie sits down on the bed, and pats the spot beside him. His younger brother sits. </p><p> </p><p>“How’d you end up in a polyamorous relationship?” is what Charlie asks. It’s not what Percy had been expecting to hear. </p><p> </p><p>“Merlin help me, I love them.” Percy looks up at the ceiling, “Oliver and I dated on and off throughout Hogwarts. I started dating Penny when I thought we were through. After the war, I encountered Oliver and Marcus by accident. We agreed to go out on a double date. Ended up having a four-way that night.”<br/>
<br/>
“Percy, I don’t <em> need </em> those types of details. I don’t <em> want </em> those types of details.” </p><p>Percy looks at Charlie, who isn’t looking at him. It’s amusing. “We started seeing each other for a couple of months after that. I was sent to the States on business, where I met Audrey. We started exchanging letters weekly after I came back home.” </p><p> </p><p>Charlie interrupts, “Were the five of you in a relationship at that point?” </p><p> </p><p>“No. Penny and I were fuck buddies -” Charlie groans, “with Marcus and Oliver. They invited us here to live with them. This property belonged to Oliver’s parents. They died during the war.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry to hear that.” </p><p> </p><p>“I am too. Just don’t bring it up. He doesn’t like talking about it.” </p><p> </p><p>Charlie nods, “noted. How’d you go from friends with benefits to lovers? What about Audrey?” </p><p> </p><p>Percy continues, “We had this nasty fight. Said some things we regretted, still regret. We made up a month later -” </p><p> </p><p>“A month? What was this fight about exactly?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’d rather not say. It was stupid and we shouldn’t have fought with each other.” He looks over at his brother, “It was ridiculous. When we made up, we decided that we couldn’t live without each other.  Audrey and I were still exchanging letters at this point, and we met up once a month in Daigon Alley - she moved here - and I introduced her to Penny. After that, the three of us met weekly until Penny invited her back here. We started having sex,” another groan from Charlie. Percy ignores him, “when Oliver and Marcus walked in on us. They just kind of… joined. Audrey just kept showing up here and never left. I married her shortly after.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be honest little brother. I’m upset that you got married and didn’t invite me. I understand not wanting the twins, but what about the rest of us?” </p><p> </p><p>This is exactly the conversation Percy doesn’t want to be having, but here he is, having it anyway, “No one was talking to me. I didn’t think anyone would come, even if I invited them. You’re the only one that still talks to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Percy’s startled by the tight hug Charlie engulfs him in, and is even more surprised by his words, “I’m sorry <em> Percy</em>,” the way he says his name makes Percy’s heart break, “I know about the fight you had with everybody. I’m sorry I didn’t reach out sooner, I just -” he sighs and hugs harder, “It’s just that I thought you would come around.” </p><p> </p><p>Percy leans back, breaking the hug, “You want me to <em> apologize? </em> That’s not happening Charlie. Is this why you’ve been writing to me? Just so I would apologize?” </p><p> </p><p>“Percy, no,” Charlie grabs his hand, the one with his wedding band, “that’s not why I’ve been writing you. I miss you. Mum and dad miss you -” </p><p> </p><p>The younger Weasley interrupts him, angry,  “They can reach out then. The twins attacked <em> me, </em> Ginny hexed <em> me, </em> Ron tried to punch <em> me, </em>and then Bill has the audacity to tell me to apologize? No, that’s not happening. Do you know what mum and dad did during the fight? Nothing. Not a bloody thing.” </p><p> </p><p>Charlie sighs, eyes not looking at his brother. He rests his forehead on Percy’s shoulder, “Percy. I don’t blame you for the fight, I really don’t.” </p><p> </p><p>“Then why do you want me to apologize?” </p><p> </p><p>“Because I miss you Percy. We all miss you, even the twins -” Percy snorts, “I’m serious little brother. The twins have been sulking in your old room.” </p><p> </p><p>“They’re probably destroying my things.” </p><p> </p><p>Charlie sighs again, “Are you happy?” </p><p> </p><p>The question catches him off guard, “what?” </p><p> </p><p>“Are you happy? With your relationship?” Charlie repeats patiently. Percy had always looked up to Charlie growing up; Bill got frustrated with him too easily, but Charlie never did. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ve never been happier,” Percy replies honestly. He has no reason to lie, not to Charlie. </p><p> </p><p>Charlie smiles, “I’m glad to hear that.” They sit in comfortable silence for a few minutes, just enjoying each other’s company. It’s nice, Percy thinks. This isn’t nearly as bad as he imagined, and if he’s being honest, he has missed his brother’s company. </p><p> </p><p>“Little brother?” Charlie says, breaking the silence. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm?” </p><p> </p><p>“I love you, you know that?” The thing about it all is, he sounds completely genuine. </p><p> </p><p>Percy blinks back tears, hoping not to attract Charlie’s attention. </p><p> </p><p>It doesn’t work. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, <em> Percy,” </em> Charlie gives him an one-armed hug, “I don’t tell you that nearly often enough. I’m sorry.” </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t apologize,” his voice is breaking. Merlin, this is embarrassing. He wants to go back to a comfortable silence, though Charlie isn’t going to let that happen, “You’ve got nothing to be sorry for.” </p><p> </p><p>“I really do though.” </p><p> </p><p>“Can we… ” he starts before hesitating, “can we not talk about this right now?” </p><p> </p><p>“Alright, but we will talk about this in the future.” Dammit. Talking about it now is bad enough. “I’ll talk to the others about tonight.” </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you <em> dare,” </em>Percy hisses, “If they can’t be bothered to reach out to me and apologize, then they don’t need to be informed of my… lifestyle.” </p><p> </p><p>Charlie looks at him, “Fair enough. Seriously though, you should write mum and at least tell her that you’re doing alright. She’s been worried sick.” </p><p>Percy exhales through his nose audibly, annoyed. Why should he reach out? “You can tell her that I’m fine.” </p><p> </p><p>“She’ll want to know how I know that.” Charlie retorts. Damn, he’s got Percy there. </p><p> </p><p>Percy thinks about it for a few seconds, “You can mention that you saw me, but don’t go into details.” </p><p> </p><p>“I won’t, don’t worry.” He waits for a moment, then continues, “I should go. Mum’ll have my head if I’m not at dinner. You know how she is.” </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I do.”</p><p> </p><p>They stand and leave the room wordlessly. They walk back into the living room, where Percy’s lovers are waiting. </p><p> </p><p>Audrey speaks up, “Have a good chat?” </p><p> </p><p>Percy answers, “Yes.” It’s short and to the point. He’ll tell them about their conversation after Charlie leaves. </p><p> </p><p>Charlie turns and looks at his brother, “I want to meet up again before I head back to Romania.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’d like that.” </p><p> </p><p>Charlie smiles. </p>
