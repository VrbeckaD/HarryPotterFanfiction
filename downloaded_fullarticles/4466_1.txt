    <p>He didn’t want to move. There was so much pain. Pain everywhere. His arms, his legs, even his toes felt sore. And thinking, thinking felt like someone was drilling a hole in his head. This really wasn’t fair. Ron never got hungover. Was this the universe’s way of creating balance? Punishing Harry for Ron’s dumb luck?</p><p>He tried to sit up, regretting it immediately. His stomach definitely didn’t agree with moving. At all.</p><p>“Ugh, I’m never drinking again,” Harry mumbled to himself, slowly sinking back down.</p><p>“You say that every time.”</p><p>Startled, Harry turned around much quicker than he should have. The room started spinning, making him extremely queasy. His eyes wouldn’t focus properly, but he could make out a naked torso beside him. Pale skin. Blond hair.</p><p>“Oh, it’s you. For a moment I thought I would be forced to have a really awkward conversation with one of our friends.”</p><p>“Which one of our friends?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Are you telling me you were so drunk, you would have slept with Blaise? Finnigan? Thomas? Theo?” He paused. “Longbottom? Weasley?”</p><p>Harry wanted to laugh, but he was afraid of what his stomach would do then. So instead, he settled into a more comfortable position, putting his hands underneath his pillow.</p><p>“God, can you imagine? Besides, you were supposed to keep an eye on me. You know what happens when I drink.”</p><p>“I do know. Why do you think I’m here?” Draco said, shaking his head in mock disapproval. It made Harry frown.</p><p>“You sleep here almost every night. I don’t even remember the last time you slept in your own bed.”</p><p>“Is that a complaint?” Draco said in a challenging tone. Harry wouldn’t have needed to see his face to know there was a smirk on his lips.</p><p>“Yes. You’re very clingy in your sleep,” Harry replied with an answering smirk.</p><p>“Excuse me, I was under the impression you liked that. Well, if you feel that violated, I’ll just sleep in my room tonight.”</p><p>
  <em>Please don’t. </em>
</p><p>It was on the tip of Harry’s tongue. He bit his lip to prevent him from embarrassing himself. It was bad enough he had feelings for his flatmate… Okay, at this point, Draco was definitely more than his flatmate. He had become his best friend. He couldn’t ruin that by blurting out something stupid. No.</p><p>“Seriously though,” Draco grumbled as he threw back the covers and leaned down to retrieve his clothes, “I can’t believe you were thinking about sleeping with one of our friends. Who, by the way, are all in committed relationships. It would have caused so much drama!”</p><p>“I wasn’t thinking about sleeping with anyone!”</p><p>Now that wasn’t exactly true. And it became harder and harder to hide it every day. Literally. Draco, running around the flat in just his pants or simply a towel, really wasn’t helping this whole situation either.</p><p>“I know you weren’t,” Draco said with a grin as he buttoned up his shirt. “I guess you’ll stay a virgin forever.”</p><p>“Hey!” Turning beet red, Harry grabbed one of the pillows and threw it with all his might. “Take that back!”</p><p>“They should call you ‘The Boy Who Stayed Abstinent For The Rest Of His Life’.”</p><p>If only Draco knew! But even if Harry decided to tell him, he wouldn’t even know where to begin. Just thinking about it made him so nervous, he felt like throwing up. Oh, wait, maybe that wasn’t nervousness… Yeah, it definitely wasn’t nervousness.</p><p>“Ugh,” Harry groaned, pressing his face into the mattress.</p><p>“Five more minutes, Sleeping Beauty. Then you’ll have to come and help me clean.”</p><p>“How come you don’t feel sick? You had more to drink than me!”</p><p>“Easy. I’m better at everything,” Draco chuckled with a shrug. Harry rolled his eyes and pulled the covers over his head. Going back to sleep wasn’t an option, though. He’d feel awful afterwards, he knew it. Reluctantly, he manoeuvred himself into a sitting position.</p><p>Getting dressed took about ten minutes longer than it usually did. Not only because his stomach protested to this kind of activity, but because he couldn’t find any clean socks.</p><p>Harry’s heart instantly began beating faster. <em>Socks</em>. Oh Merlin! He nearly felt assaulted by the memory his mind was suddenly springing on him. It had been such a disaster!</p><p>
  <em>“Draco,” Harry whispered. “Draco, wake up.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The blond let out a grunt and buried his face in the crook of Harry’s neck.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Let me sleep.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry chuckled, ruffling his hair. He didn’t want to wait. He knew it was childish. Christmas morning was tomorrow. But he wanted Draco to have his present now.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Christmas had always been a little sad for Harry. It hadn’t even been the fact that he’d had to watch Dudley open his ridiculous amount of presents each year. Well, that too, because it had been a reminder that there was no one in this world who cared for him. At Hogwarts, it had changed. He had come to spend Christmas with his new family. And being with the Weasleys was one of the best things Harry could have imagined. He hadn’t thought it could get any better than that. That was before Draco had joined them. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Accio present,” he muttered, careful not to move around too much. A moment later, the messily wrapped present flew into his waiting hand.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Draco,” he whispered again. “Merry Christmas.” He held the present to Draco’s ear. Maybe the crinkling would pique his interest. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What’s going on?” Slowly, Draco opened one eye and rested his chin on Harry’s chest.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“It’s your Christmas present.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You’re supposed to give me that tomorrow. Has nobody taught you how Christmas works?” Draco froze, realising what he had just said. “I didn’t mean it like that, I-”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“It’s okay.” Harry’s smile was genuine and he felt a warm trickle down his chest when Draco gave him one in return.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Alright, you impatient child. Give me my present.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry watched anxiously as Draco took his time with the wrapping paper. For Merlin’s sake, how long was this going to take? When Draco’s hands stopped moving and his expression became puzzled, Harry stopped breathing.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Socks. You’re giving me socks?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry pressed his lips together.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“They’re… fluffy socks.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Seriously? Socks? The most boring present ever?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was hard not to feel hurt.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“And this couldn’t have waited until tomorrow because…” Draco looked at him expectantly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I was too excited,” Harry said sheepishly, trying to hide how tense he was. Well, what had he thought Draco’s reaction would be? Of course he’d think it was weird. And boring. Draco had no idea what these socks meant to Harry. What he was trying to say with them. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Honestly, I was already confident my present would be better than yours, but you could have at least put a little more effort into it.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry bit his lip.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Do you remember, a few weeks ago, when we came home from dinner with Pansy?” he mumbled.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yeah, what about it?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You were complaining about the snow. Your hair was stuck to your forehead and your clothes were drenched.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You always remember so many weird details,” Draco noted.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well… Anyway, I was already in bed when you came back from the bathroom. You were wearing that dark blue shirt…”  …that makes you look absolutely perfect. Harry cleared his throat before he continued. “You got under the covers and started complaining again. And then you stuck your feet between my calves.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“So? Is that why you’re giving me socks? So I won’t-”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No, that’s not it. I-”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Because if you’re going to insist I’m wearing socks to bed-”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“It’s not what you think.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What could you possibly have to say about this that will make it-”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry didn’t hear the rest of Draco’s sentence. He was too absorbed in his thoughts, his heart sinking. He couldn’t tell him. He could barely listen to the words in his head. All of his courage abruptly left him. It wasn’t like Harry to be afraid of Draco’s reaction to something. But this would change everything. And what if Draco didn’t feel the same? It would destroy Harry. And he would lose his best friend.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shaking his head sadly, he decided to let Draco think he simply had terrible taste and didn’t know how to pick a good present. It was better this way. </em>
</p><p>Harry shivered as all the disappointment from that morning washed over him again. That had been a week ago and he still hadn’t said anything to Draco. Instead, he had tried to go back to how things were.</p><p>Making arrangements for their New Year’s Eve party had momentarily distracted him. Well, except for that one time when he was supposed to hang up the string of lights and had a full-on meltdown. It was so pathetic. What was wrong with him? He wasn’t some bloody coward! But he had no experience with these kinds of things and it was definitely out of his comfort zone.</p><p>Shaking his head, he made his way to the living room.</p><p>“Oh, dear God!”</p><p>The flat was an absolute mess. There was confetti and glitter everywhere. The sofa had so many shoe prints all over it, it was hard to tell what its original colour was. Every flat surface had turned into a collecting point for empty bottles. Or… not that empty, Harry realised as he accidentally knocked over several bottles on the ground. Ugh! Beer! The scent made Harry sick. Aaaand now the beer was all over his feet. Great. Well, at least he was barefoot.</p><p>“Well, it certainly looks like we had fun,” Draco remarked.</p><p>“Yeah. People have deemed our parties the best,” Harry said, scratching the back of his neck. He just wanted to crawl back into bed. Cleaning was the last thing he wanted to do right now.</p><p>“Come on, grab your wand. We’ll have the place back to normal in no time,” Draco said, nudging Harry with his elbow.</p><p>Even with magic it felt like Harry was lifting weights. Still, it was better than doing it the Muggle way.</p><p>As he levitated a bunch of bottles to the kitchen, his eyes fell on Draco who stood in front of the sofa. His face was set in deep concentration, while he silently mouthed the spell to get rid of all the shoe prints. Harry loved watching him like this. But the longer he stared, the more his body reacted to it. He could feel the hammering of his heart against his collarbone, not to mention the intense tingling on the back of his neck.</p><p>Harry almost let the bottles drop to the floor. He couldn’t take his eyes off Draco. He wanted to stay like this forever. Well, maybe not exactly like this. He could definitely use a shower and his feet were getting a bit cold. But he wanted them to stay like this; together. Because as long as Draco was with him, even cleaning their currently very disgusting flat was something that made him smile. Because he was happy. Draco always made him feel happy. Well, except when they were fighting. Which was pretty often. But they always made up. Sooner or later. Merlin, they were both so stubborn. But at the end of the day, Harry couldn’t imagine not speaking to Draco anymore, not seeing him every day. It would be torture. It would make everything meaningless.</p><p>
  <em>Oh, God! Here we go!</em>
</p><p>This wasn’t just some little crush. He was completely and utterly, irrevocably, head over heels in love with his best friend. And the feeling seemed to be intensifying. <em>Well, shit!</em></p><p>It hit him with such force, it nearly knocked him off his feet. He had known it from the day Draco had lain beside him, softly snoring into his ear while Harry had shivered from the coldness of his feet. If it had been any other person beside him, Harry would have probably tried to slip out of bed. But with Draco, everything felt right. Harry wanted to keep him warm, be there for him… be with him.</p><p>It was a good thing Draco wasn’t paying attention to Harry right now. His hands were shaking so bad, he almost dropped his wand. Apparently, having the same revelation twice didn’t keep him from being completely overwhelmed. It was weird. He was just watching Draco clean the sofa. And yet, it put everything into perspective. Because if this was what his life with Draco would be like, Harry wanted it.</p><p>“Draco.”</p><p>He turned around, blinking at Harry.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I- Um… You know, we have been living together for a while now and- I mean, of course you know that, you were there.” Why was this so hard? He wished his mind would stop screaming at him for just a second, so he could blurt out what he so desperately wanted to say. But this voice in his head wouldn’t shut up about how he was making a fool out of himself.</p><p>This could ruin everything. Their friendship would be over. Draco would probably move out, leave Harry all alone and never come back. And when they’d bump into each other on the street months later, Draco would probably be very curt and polite or ignore him completely. Or… what if Harry ran into him and Draco was with somebody else? He wouldn’t be able to handle it. How was he supposed to live without looking at that face? That smile? His infatuating laugh? His delicate hands? His icy cold feet?</p><p>“Is everything okay?”</p><p>Harry blinked.</p><p><em>Merlin, don’t be so dramatic</em>, he chastised himself. <em>Don’t always go to the worst case scenario!</em> Who knew, maybe Draco would like the idea of being with Harry. There were enough things indicating that, right? Just like last night, when he…</p><p>“Oh my God,” Harry gasped as he suddenly remembered standing on the balcony with Draco. “We kissed, didn’t we? We kissed!”</p><p>Draco gave him a weird look.</p><p>“I’m not sure if I would really call it a kiss, but yes, there were lips… touching.”</p><p>“Oh, God.” Harry’s hands flew to his forehead. How could he have forgotten?</p><p>“Keep your pants on. It was only a quick peck at midnight. I admit, I was hoping it would be a little bit more than that, but I didn’t want to push you. You were completely pissed.”</p><p>Harry’s mind reeled. <em>Hoped? More than that? </em>What the actual fuck?</p><p>“Well, we can always make up for it today if you’re in the mood for it,” Draco said evenly. At this point, Harry was pretty sure he was hallucinating. “I won’t be mad if you’re not,” Draco continued. “I understand. But…”</p><p>Harry forgot how to breathe when Draco suddenly stood in front of him, leaning in. He brushed his lips against Harry’s cheeks and Harry could feel he was smiling.</p><p>“Happy anniversary,” Draco breathed.</p><p>Anniversary? What? It wasn’t their anniversary. The day they had moved in together was October 2nd.</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Harry was so confused. “What anniversary?”</p><p>“Harry, you’re kidding, right?”</p><p>Oh, how he wished he was! But he had no idea what was going on.</p><p>“I should have known you wouldn’t remember those kind of things. Well, I guess it’s a bit childish to celebrate a six month anniversary. It’s not even the longest relationship we’ve both had. But I swear to Merlin, if we ever get married and you forget our anniversary, I will kill you.”</p><p>Harry could only stand there and stare while Draco wrapped his arms around him.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to freak you out,” Draco muttered after a moment. “Forget everything I said about marriage, okay? Harry? Are you even listening to me? Are you okay?”</p><p>Harry cleared his throat, which actually sounded more like a whimper.</p><p>“I’m okay,” he croaked. “Actually, I think I’m more than okay.” As crazy as this whole situation was, he couldn’t stop himself from smiling like an idiot. So… all this time, he and Draco had already been together? How could he have not noticed?  And wait… why was their six months anniversary today?</p><p>“So… you remember the day we, err… started… dating?”</p><p>Draco snorted.</p><p>“How could I forget? You were all over me.”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“Yeah. Don’t you remember? Weasley even commented on it. ‘Don’t you two ever let go of each other?’”</p><p>Harry snickered at Draco’s horrible impression of Ron.</p><p>“But I always hold your hand, that’s nothing new.”</p><p>“It was on that day,” Draco said. Harry frowned, trying to remember. Huh. Maybe Draco was right. He hadn’t even realised. Grabbing Draco’s hand had become such a habit, he didn’t really think about it anymore. Just like sleeping in the same bed. Snuggling in said bed. Cuddling on the couch. Doing… basically everything together.</p><p>Oh. People who were just friends probably didn’t do that… right? But wait. People who were in a relationship definitely did something he and Draco had never done.</p><p>“So, we kissed yesterday… For the first time?”</p><p>“Yes?” Draco looked like he wanted to roll his eyes and say ‘Obviously!’</p><p>“But… you thought… I mean, we are in a relationship… but we haven’t been… that physical.”</p><p>Draco just shrugged.</p><p>“I didn’t want to push it. You’re obviously uncomfortable with it.”</p><p>“What? Why would you think that?”</p><p>“I gave you plenty of opportunities, but you didn’t seem that interested. It’s okay, you know. We don’t need to… do… anything. Not if you’re uncomfortable with it.”</p><p>Harry inwardly groaned. How could Draco be so insightful and so blind at the same time? <em>You’re one to talk!</em> Yeah, okay, maybe they were both a bit slow.</p><p>“I’m not uncomfortable with it,” Harry burst out. “Draco, I had no idea we- Oh God, this is so embarrassing.” He let out a deep sigh, before taking Draco’s hands in his. “I had no idea you wanted to- you wanted me to…”</p><p>“So… you’re not opposed to being… physical?”</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>They both watched each other’s cheeks turn red until Harry averted his eyes to the floor.<br/>
<br/>
“Okay then,” he mumbled. “So I guess…”</p><p>“Wait, while we’re being honest,” Draco interrupted him. “Care to tell me what the fuck was going on with you when you gave me the worst Christmas present ever? Were you trying to break up with me with those socks?”</p><p>
  <em>Oh, wow, okay. So I do get to make a fool out of myself after all.</em>
</p><p>“Well,” Harry began, immediately feeling hot all over. “It’s actually… I wanted to… Ugh, look, I’m not good with those kind of things, okay? It’s just that… that night I told you about, when you had your cold feet against my-”</p><p>“Oh, Merlin, that story again,” Draco groaned.</p><p>“Damn it, Draco, will you let me finish? The socks were meant to be… like, a symbol. Because I realised…” Merlin, it sounded so stupid! Oh, what the hell! “I realised I always want to keep you warm. Because… I want you to be happy. Always. Because… well, you mean everything to me.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t tell if Draco was about to shout or laugh or cry. He was perfectly still as he gazed at Harry.</p><p>“So… you’re saying…”</p><p>Harry swallowed around the lump in his throat and squeezed Draco’s hands a little tighter.</p><p>“It was the moment I realised I love you.”</p><p>Harry’s only consolation for feeling like a complete idiot was that Draco looked like somebody had just smacked him across the face.</p><p>“You love me?” he asked, his eyes wide. “You love me. And that’s the moment you realised you love me? When I used your calves to warm my feet?”</p><p>“Um, yeah,” Harry said sheepishly. “It’s weird, I know.”</p><p>“Huh. I suddenly have a new appreciation for those socks,” Draco murmured, his face turning soft again. “How about we leave the mess as it is and worry about cleaning later?”</p><p>“Um…” Harry suddenly felt like throwing up again. He wanted to. He really, really wanted to, but this was all going very fast all of a sudden.<br/>
<br/>
“Relax,” Draco whispered, pulling Harry into his arms. “We can go slow, okay? We won’t do anything you don’t want to.”</p><p>“Okay,” Harry said with a shaky breath. He closed his eyes as he felt Draco’s lips on his, melting into his touch. Even if this was only their second kiss, it already felt familiar. Warm. But exciting nonetheless.</p><p>He felt Draco slowly pushing him towards his room and even though his heart was ready to jump out of his chest, he trusted Draco. They would take it slow.</p><p>“Fuck!”</p><p>Harry almost stumbled backwards at Draco’s outburst. Puzzled, he started wondering why Draco suddenly looked so exasperated.</p><p>“Oh God! I gave you a broom,” he groaned.</p><p>“What?” Harry didn’t follow.</p><p>“You gave me those socks that weren’t just socks… You… And I gave you a stupid new broom! How lame is that?”</p><p>Harry couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“Draco, I loved the broom, what are you talking about?”</p><p>Instead of laughing with him, Draco looked at him with a serious expression.</p><p>“I… I do, too. You know that, right?”</p><p>Harry blinked, almost shivering under Draco’s intense gaze.</p><p>“I do now,” he whispered. This day was just full of surprises. Not only had Harry learned he was in a relationship, had been for a while, but Draco also loved him. And he loved Draco. This was insane!</p><p>Shaking his head despite himself, he pressed a kiss to Draco’s jaw when he pulled him into his arms again.</p><p>“Happy anniversary,” Harry chuckled.</p><p>Seriously, this was <em>so </em>insane. But… he really couldn’t have been happier.</p>
