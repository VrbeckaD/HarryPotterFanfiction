          <div class="userstuff"><p>Shifting in his chair, Harry sighed. Rubbing his temples, he leaned back and yawned. Being kept late by paperwork was not fun. Harry didnt even flinch when the door opened and Tom walked in. Tom walked behind his desk and promptly sat on his lap.<br/>
"Hi there, beautiful." Harry grinned and winked.<br/>
Tom huffed.<br/>
"You dont need to remind me."<br/>
Tom kissed Harry's cheek and snuggled closer to the green eyed man.<br/>
Harry hummed a bit, running his fingers through Tom's soft, pretty black hair. Running his nose down Tom's jawline and swan-like neck.<br/>
Tom made a barely audible whine, closing his eyes.<br/>
Harry chuckled, looking at the beautiful man on his lap.<br/>
"You know, you're cute. For a dark lord."<br/>
Harry pressed a few kisses to his jaw, moving down he pressed a few more light kisses to Tom's porcelain collar bones. Tom whimpered, a light, airy noise. Beautiful. The noise went straight to Harry's unmentionable parts. Kissing Tom's neck a few more times, Harry began to suck lightly in the spots he knew were sensitive. Tom gasped and squirmed.<br/>
"We're not having sex in here." Tom muttered, a few soft mewls leaving his cherry lips.<br/>
Harry made a noise of acknowledgment, sucking harder in some spots, loving the noises the man on his lap made.<br/>
"Nghh, stop you dimwit, not here."<br/>
Harry sighed in annoyance.<br/>
He stood up and hoisted a complaining dark lord over his shoulder before apparating home.</p></div>
