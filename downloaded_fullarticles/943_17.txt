          <div class="userstuff"><p>Imagine that Luna’s father wasn’t the more weird in the family.</p>
<p>Imagine that Luna’s mom is the source of the more estrange of her beliefs.</p>
<p>Imagine that Luna’s mom maiden name was actually Addams.</p>
<p>Maybe more of Flora’s side, but still a Addams.</p>
<p>With the Addams being wizzards or maybe just mixed with magical creatures or both!</p>
<p>Imagine Luna Lovegood actually seeing things the others wizards can’t…</p>
<p>And performing rituals forgotter by most.</p>
<p>Imagine that Luna don’t retaliate the bulling because,  for one she is too kind and for two, the forces around her, the darkness, the odd tendrils that follow always will eventually snap and punish the ones that need to be punish, one way or another.</p>
<p>Imagine Luna Lovegood being viciously protective of those she consider hers and having no quals in using all her powers and family ties to protecting and avenging. Including Harry and Ginny.</p>
<p>Imagine Voldemort and his followers dealing with the Addams family, who may be dark, maybe even darker that he, but never evil or discriminating.</p></div>
