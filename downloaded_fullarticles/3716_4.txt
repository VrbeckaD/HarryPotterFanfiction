    <p>May 1, 1998</p>
<p>The day had started off normally at the London branch of Gringotts Bank. Well, as normally as it could while under the Voldemort-Controlled-Ministry regime. Senior Teller Daggerock looked around, sparing a disgusted sneer at the Wizards that were milling about. Before last year, it would have been unheard of for a Wizard to work in Gringotts - now the blasted wand wavers practically thought they ran the place.</p>
<p>The first indication that something was amiss was the inhuman scream of pain and rage that ripped through the halls of the bank, echoing from the deepest depths of the tunnels below. In the span of one breath to the next, the floor exploded upward around them as the half blind dragon that guarded the lower vaults burst through the main lobby, and riding atop the beast was the unmistakable figure and mahogany hair of Juniper Potter. Dragon and rider continued upward through the vaulted ceiling above, and Daggerok had had the presence of mind to duck below the desk in time to avoid the worst of the falling debris.</p>
<p>Others weren't so lucky. Pulling himself free from under his desk, he could see many seriously wounded goblins scattered about the destroyed lobby, some groaning and a few lying too still. Senior Teller Daggerok took out his ceremonial blade - the knife given to every male upon reaching their majority. Goblin blood had been spilled this day, and there would be a reckoning.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, he flung the blade into the floor and spat, "Juniper Potter."</p>
<p>One Week Later</p>
<p>The war was over. Voldemort, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, You-Know-Who, Tom Riddle. Whatever you called him, the most feared Dark Lord was dead by Juniper Potter's own hand. The cost had of course been high, and the last week had been dedicated to honoring those who had fallen in the final battle - The Battle of Hogwarts as it was being called.</p>
<p>Her two closest friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, had stuck around the last week to mourn the fallen - Fred Weasley, one of Ron's own brothers, and her first lover, was counted among the dead - but with the last of the funerals completed, they planned to head to Australia to find Hermione's parents. June had originally planned to travel with the pair, feeling the need to get away from Britain for a period of time, but fate had apparently made other plans for her.</p>
<p>The Goblins of Gringotts had sent a missive demanding her presence at the bank in regards to her breaking into a high security vault and escaping on a stolen dragon. Apparently they didn't take too kindly to such things. Her friends were willing to put off leaving until after her meeting, but she declined the offer. There was just no telling how long it would take, and finding a pair of memory charmed muggles in a foreign country after nearly a full year would take time in itself.  Juniper sighed and turned slightly, apparating to Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>Drawing the hood of her cloak over her head she started walking. Despite the early hour and lack of shoppers, the Alley was already showing signs of renewed life in the week since the battle. Shops were reopening and there was a tentative spirit of hope that had been missing in recent years. Keeping her head lowered to avoid the off chance of being recognized, she easily navigated the nearly deserted Alley. Ducking into the newly restored entrance to the bank, she paused. Off to the side, the sounds of an argument filtered through the closed doors of one of the conference rooms.</p>
<p>"Its out of the question!" newly appointed Minister for Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt bellowed, glaring hard at the Goblin standing across from him.</p>
<p>The Goblin, a sharp eyed senior teller named Daggerok, seemed unperturbed by the outburst. "The laws and stipulations agreed upon by your Ministry and Gringotts in the Treaty of 1665 are clear on this matter, Minister," he replied. "While Gringotts acknowledges that we violated the section regarding housing Class S dark artifacts, to whit I refer to the late Voldemort's soul jar, the fact remains that our bank was robbed, goods were stolen, a Dragon lost, and six Goblins were killed. All because Lady Potter chose to attack rather than ask.”</p>
<p>“And the Ministry is willing to make reparations for the damages,” Kingsley replied, “Charlie Weasley has already secured a new Ironbelly for you, and I'm sure Lady Potter would be willing to pay the cost of the repairs out of her own vaults...”</p>
<p>“Gold we have in abundance, though the Dragon will be taken as a gesture of good will,” Daggerok replied. “Indeed, given the fact that it was a Horcrux that was stored in our halls, we're even willing to waive the costs in gold. It is the lives of the six Goblins that must be addressed.”</p>
<p>“What will prevent a war then, Master Goblin?” a new voice sounded, causing Kingsley and Daggerok to look to the entrance of the conference room they were using.</p>
<p>Lady Potter stood there, a simple black mourners outfit and hooded cloak adorning her slim frame.</p>
<p>“Juniper,” Kingsley said, “I thought you'd be...”</p>
<p>“I finished visiting Fred's grave a few hours ago,” she replied, “Hermione and Ron are leaving tomorrow to retrieve her parents. The rest of the family are helping with the rebuild of Hogwarts. I needed to get away from the crowds.”</p>
<p>“You have my sympathies as to the loss of your beloved, Lady Potter,” Daggerok said, though his tone of barely muted hostility didn't quite match the words. “We of Gringotts do understand the pain of loss.”</p>
<p>“And I'm not one to shy away from my mistakes,” she replied. “How can we settle this debt, Master...I'm sorry, I didn't ask your name yet?”</p>
<p>“Senior Teller Daggerok, Lady Potter,” he replied. “Traditionally, the only payment is...a life, for a life.”</p>
<p>“Out of the question, I said!” Shacklebolt shouted.</p>
<p>“Shack, calm down!” Juniper replied, “I'm sure Master Daggerok understands that!”</p>
<p>“Indeed, I do, as do Lord Ragnok and High King Killgrav,” Daggerok replied. “Kill the 'Woman Who Won'? We'd have rightfully brought a war upon ourselves we could not win.”</p>
<p>“But what you're proposing instead...”</p>
<p>“Is satisfactory to the laws, the families of the Goblins killed, and to our High King,” Daggerok replied. “And the terms are negotiable as well.”</p>
<p>“What is the proposal then?” Juniper asked.</p>
<p>Daggerok pulled a scroll from a pouch at his side, passing it over to the girl. “Before you ask, breaking the seal will not activate the contract,” he said, looking at Shacklebolt. “Only once its signed with a Blood Quill, and an Unbreakable Vow given, will it become binding.”</p>
<p>Juniper frowned at the mention of a blood quill, but broke the seal, and opened the scroll.</p>
<p>Contract of Servitude</p>
<p>I, the undersigned, in full possession of mental faculties, and free of any compulsions, charms, potions, or geass, agree to this contract and its stipulations.<br/>1) I, the undersigned, will be an 'indentured servant' of Gringott's Bank, London.<br/>2) For a period of no less than one year, and no more than five.<br/>3) During that time, I shall remain in the care of the Goblins of Gringotts, and will live in the goblin city of Tirith Ungul, which rests below London.<br/>4) As an indentured servant, I will have no rights or privileges afforded any normal bank customer or person, and will swear to follow any and all commands I might be issued, save for anything that would be construed as illegal by Gringotts, the Ministry of Magic, and the International Confederacy of Wizards.<br/>5) I will submit to any and all tasks, labours, punishments, etcetera, that I am assigned/will earn during my term of service.<br/>6) I will be allowed no contact with the outside world for the entire term.<br/>7) I will agree to never speak to anyone of any secrets I learn during said term.<br/>8) I will agree to never seek retribution for anything that befalls me during this term, and will swear an oath to this effect.<br/>The length of service to be negotiated before the parties sign, and to take effect no more than one week past signing.</p>
<p>At the bottom, there was space for three signatures, two of which were already filled with the names of the Goblin's High King, Killgrave, and Lord Ragnok.</p>
<p>“So,” Juniper said, her voice trembling slightly after reading the draconian document, “Basically...I have to be a slave for a certain number of years to pay off this debt.”</p>
<p>“For all intents and purposes...yes,” Daggerok replied, “Most Goblins find it distasteful, though admittedly the Hook Clan wanted you to them for life. However, when we learned of Griphook's subterfuge against you regarding Gryffindor's Sword, we dismissed their claim. Otherwise it would be seven Goblin deaths, and the terms of the contract would be much harsher.”</p>
<p>“Harsher!” Shacklebolt bellowed, “What could possibly be har...”</p>
<p>“Shack!” Juniper shouted, stopping the man from continuing his tirade, “Never ask a question like that...things can always get worse.  You never want to tempt the universe like that.” She turned to Daggerok. "I agree in principle with the contract, but I do want to negotiate on it.  Furthermore, I would wish to finish negotiations at a second session next week, same time and place, so that I may consult with my closest advisors as well as study the contract myself.  Since that accursed tournament, I've become much more wary of magical contracts."</p>
<p>"And who might these advisors be?"</p>
<p>"Andromeda Tonks, who is licensed to practice law in both the non-magical and magical worlds, and Luna Lovegood, who brings a unique insight to every discussion."</p>
<p>"You do not wish your bushy-haired friend's advice?  We know she was with you that day."</p>
<p>"No, she will be out of the country and, really, she doesn't have the understanding to advise on this.  I'm taking this for her, too, and I don't want her going off on a rant; a fait accompli helps with that."</p>
<p>Daggerok nodded, "Wise and prudent; the goblin nation can agree to this."</p>
<p>Juniper bowed her head, "Praise, indeed.  Now, you said the deaths of six honorable goblins, were all killed as a result of the 'intrusion'?"</p>
<p>The senior teller raised an eyebrow, "A perceptive question and, no, only three with the others being killed when we told Madame Lestrange of the theft; she and her master viciously attacked them."</p>
<p>"So like Tom, killing the messenger.  So, while I would not tell Gringotts how to run their business, I presume you have confiscated all his vaults, both under his nom de guerre as well as his birth name of Tom Marvolo Riddle, as well as any vaults his mother's family, the Gaunts, had left as he was the last of that line."</p>
<p>"If we have not, we shall, Lady Potter.  Thank you for that full information.  Still, that leaves us with blood for blood and both Voldemort and Madame Lestrange are dead."</p>
<p>Juniper nodded, "I realize that, but something else occurs to me.  If someone dies with marked slaves or animals and dies in debt, cannot those slaves and animals be used to pay that debt?"</p>
<p>"They can, but what does that have to do..."</p>
<p>"Bear with me, senior teller.  Tom Riddle marked his followers with a mark which he used to call and control them.  How, then, were they not effectively his slaves?  It would follow that it would be legal under law to require payment of some sort from every marked follower, their estates, or, in some cases, their families." </p>
<p>She turned to the MInister, "I'm sure you wouldn't mind providing the goblin nation with a list of marked Death Eaters for such a purpose."  She smiled wickedly, "I would imagine that it could severely weaken opposition to reform within the Wizengamot if opponents were busy dealing with other concerns."</p>
<p>Shacklebolt's eyes widened, "Yes, it would, and it would be completely legal under the law."   He turned to Daggerok, "Senior teller, I will see that you get that list.  Whatever you do, I ask that you not extinguish any further lines but I have no problem with anything less than that happening to those who espoused such violence and wanton cruelty."</p>
<p>Senior teller Daggerok looked at both of them, "A line of reasoning we had not considered.  You may find our leagal department wanting to borrow you, Lady Potter, on occassion, after the start of your servitude.  With this line of reasoning, I believe King Kilgrave and Lord Ragnok will hold with you being held responsible for only three deaths."</p>
<p>“The contract says no less than one year, no more than five. I think we can both agree that five is not going to happen, and neither is one.  Given the reduction in the number of deaths charged to my hand, I think three years would be a reasonable number.”</p>
<p>“I'd heard you were intelligent, Lady Potter,” Daggerok nodded, “I agree. I'd already suggested to King Killgrave that three would be the best choice. Its a powerful number, divisible into six, and not so short a time as to pay insult to the families who lost members.” He frowned at her. “I must warn you though, Lady Potter. If you agree to this, it will be harsh. Like the contract says, you will have no rights...you won't even be considered a person.”</p>
<p>Juniper snorted. “I've been treated as such before,” she replied. “I'll deal with it, if it helps prevent another war. All I ask is a little time to set my affairs in order.”</p>
<p>Daggerok nodded, pulling out a quill and making a change to the contract. “Once you sign, you will have a month to 'settle affairs',” he said, “After that, you will be required to report to the entrance of Gringotts at midnight the day its to take effect. You'll surrender your wand and any magical items you might have on you at the time, and will then be taken in...for processing.”</p>
<p>Juniper nodded, "That seems fair to me.  Please make three verified copies of this and I shall return next week to finish negotiations and sign."</p>
<p>Daggerok nodded and made thre copies.  "You've lost a number of goblins money today, Lady Potter."</p>
<p>"Oh?  In what way?"</p>
<p>"The betting was that you would ask for a couple changes and then sign without considering everything fully.  I didn't feel that even a wand-waver, especially one who has been through all you have, would be that brash; I and a few others stand to profit handsomely."</p>
<p>"Good for you, senior teller," grinned Juniper.  "I may be a 'brash Gryffindor' but, as I said, that accursed tournament has led me to be very careful with magical contracts."</p>
<p>Daggerok looked her over and nodded.  "If there's nothing else, I will meet you next week."</p>
<p>"No, nothing else at this time.  If I have a question, may I contact you directly?"</p>
<p>"Please do, we both want to settle this."  With that, he turned and walked back into the bank but overheard one final conversation..</p>
<p>"Juniper, are you sure of this?  That's three years and it's going to be harsh."</p>
<p>"I know that, Kingsley, but the muggles have a saying, "Don't do the crime if you can't do the time."  I've 'done the crime'; now I feel honor bound to 'do the time'."</p>
<p>Daggerok smiled to himself, Whatever else, she does have honor.</p>
<p>The Minister nodded, "I can appreciate that, most would try and find a way out; look at the use of the Imperius excuse after the last war."</p>
<p>"I'm not 'most people', Shack, and I honor my debts, all of them."</p>
<p>"So, what will you do next?"</p>
<p>"Obviously, I'm going to starting working with Andi and Luna to make sure I'm as protected as I can be.  I know it will be harsh but I want to come out of it intact." With that, she stood and walked out.</p>
<p>oOoOoOo</p>
<p>One month. That was how long the Goblins of Gringotts had given Rose Potter, the Woman Who Won, after she signed that contract and before she would lose every right she had. With Ron and Hermione out of the country, her first stop was the residence of Andromeda Tonks. Andromeda's daughter, (don't call me) Nymphadora Tonks-Lupin had named Juniper as the godmother to her son, Edward, before she had died. Gathering her Gryffindor courage for what had to be done, she let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding, and knocked.</p>
<p>A moment later, the door opened to reveal Andromeda holding baby 'Teddy' in her arms. His hair a vibrant shade of green this morning. Teddy, like his mother, was a metamorphmagus - a magical shapeshifter. Upon seeing Juniper, Andromeda raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"What are you doing standing on the doorstep?" she asked. "Come inside. Come on, now."</p>
<p>She stepped inside after Andromeda and closed the door behind herself. Despite being a Pureblood, the Tonks residence was surprisingly modern. Maybe not too surprising, given her late husband was a Muggleborn wizard. She had been here once before, a year previously when she and Hagrid had crash landed a flying motorbike in the back yard.</p>
<p>She was snapped out of her thoughts as  Andromeda handed her a cup of tea. "You have something on your mind, girl," Andromeda said, motioning for Juniper to have a seat.</p>
<p>With a sigh, she sat down opposite Andromeda, setting her tea aside for the moment. "I...er...Well, the thing..."</p>
<p>Andromeda smiled reassuringly, "Just say it. Whatever it is can't be so bad. Not after... Everything else."</p>
<p>"You'd be surprised," Juniper muttered. Andromeda arched an eyebrow at her tone.</p>
<p>Taking a quick sip of the tea, Juniper began her tale. Starting with the secret mission that she had been entrusted with by Albus Dumbledore to find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. Andromeda had heard about the break in at the Ministry, though at the time had dismissed it as foolish rumors, not believing anyone would be so stupid. Then again, she reminded herself, the girl had been sorted into the House of the brash and reckless. From there the tale got worse. The foolish children had taken to wearing the locket around their necks, exposing themselves willingly to the corrupting nature of the item, while mostly wandering the countryside at random.</p>
<p>Andromeda winced as Rose told her next how they had been captured by snatchers and taken prisoner to Malfoy Manor, where they were treated to Bellatrix LeStrange's personal brand of hospitality. Her sister hadn't always been insane. When they were younger, Bella had a wicked sense of humor that would lead to some prank or another and often times land her in trouble. Not that it deterred her in the slightest. She came out of her musing as Juniper then told of the escape with Griphook, a Gringotts goblin, and the subsequent plan to break into the bank.</p>
<p>Juniper paused, taking another sip of her rapidly cooling tea before continuing. She explained how she, Hermione and Ron had broken into the bank under the effects of Polyjuice, Glamour and, in her case, an invisibility cloak. How she had put the teller under the Imperious Curse to lead them to Bellatrix's vault, and of the betrayal and subsequent escape.</p>
<p>"That happened the day before the last battle," Juniper pointed out.</p>
<p>"An interesting tale, certainly, dear girl," Andromeda said, "but I don't see how it's as bad as you seem to think."</p>
<p>"Apparently in our escape, three Goblins were killed, and three more when the theft was reported to the vault holder," Juniper replied, her voice catching slightly. "I-I'm being held responsible for the direct deaths, and as such must pay off the blood debt.  Tom's minions will be held responsible for the rest." Andromeda gasped. "For a period of time of three years, I am to be indentured to the Goblin Nation as nothing more than a slave. The only alternative would be another uprising, and the Wizarding world doesn't need another war when we are still recovering from Voldemort." Tears started falling from her eyes. "I...I'm scared."</p>
<p>The older woman moved to wrap her arms around June's shoulders, trying to give the younger woman comfort. The Goblins were not known for their compassion toward Witches and Wizards, but the laws and treaties in place prevented more than the usual sneering and short tempered attitudes. A slave contract would negate that safety net. And worse, it would be perfectly legal.</p>
<p>"How long before they call in the debt?" Andromeda asked, dreading the answer, but needing to know.</p>
<p>"I have a month," was the muffled reply. "One month after signing to set my affairs in order before my life is no longer my own.  That's why I came to you first, I wanted a trusted advisor to go over the contract with me," she held up the copies, "and help me protect myself as best I can.  We meet back for final negotiations in a week."</p>
<p>"Well, then, let's be about it.  Is there anyone else you want in on this?"</p>
<p>"If she's free, Luna Lovegood.  She always has a unique and useful perspective on things."</p>
<p>Adromeda got up and headed for the floo.  "You compose yourself, I'll get Luna."</p>
<p>One week and one month; there was so much to do in so little time.</p>
<p>Luna came in a short time later, "You're really going to do this?"</p>
<p>Juniper nodded. "I can't see any other way to prevent a war, and the world really needs to recover from the last one."  Taking the copies of the contract out, she handed one each to Andromeda and Luna, "Now, let's start going over this. Something doesn't feel right and I want to make sure I'm as protected as possible."</p>
<p>Andromeda scanned the contract quickly and then re-read it.  "I can see why it doesn't feel right, there is no real protection for you in it.  The first thing you need to insist on is a clause that no permanent harm be done to you, including, but not limited to physical, mental, emotional, psychological, financial, and damage to your reputation."</p>
<p>"I think I can easily sell that one, Andi.  What else?"</p>
<p>Luna looked over at her, "I think the "no contact" clause is to protect them from the public finding out about you and to increase your isolation, but it leaves you open to being caught by surprise when you leave Gringotts at the end of that time.  You need at least an hour at the end of every year to be brought up to date on significant changes; you wouldn't want to find a marriage waiting for you with no forewarning."</p>
<p>Juniper nodded, "I can see the sense in that, but I'll need to trade something for that."  She thought a bit, "Would their being able to display me on the steps of Gringotts as an anonymous slave for one day a year be adequate for allowing my "trusted advisors" to brief me?"</p>
<p>Andromeda quirked an eyebrow, "And who would these trusted advisors be?"</p>
<p>"The two of you and, if she'll accept, Hermione.  Only people who already know my situation."</p>
<p>"That works.  Now, what about House Potter finances?  You don't know what could happen to everything in the Potter vaults if you are a slave there with no right to anything."</p>
<p>"Transfer control to the designated Head of House Black "for the duration"?  That would be you, Andi."</p>
<p>"I'll accept."</p>
<p>"Now, what more do we need to cover?" Juniper asked, looking down at their notes.</p>
<p>Luna looked oddly at her for a moment.  "I think you need to go through some of the books in the Black library on goblins, particularly the old ones from before the prejudices set in; you might be surprised."</p>
<p>Juniper nodded and they moved on.</p>
<p>oOoOoOo</p>
<p>One Week Later</p>
<p>Juniper entered the meeting room with Kingsley at her side. Bowing to Senior Teller Daggerok, she spoke.  "Master Daggerok, before we get down to negotiating, I wish to say a few things in explanation, not to excuse what I've done, but to explain some of why.  May I proceed?"</p>
<p>"Proceed, Lady Potter; it's rare that a wand-waver is that candid with us."</p>
<p>"Besides consulting with my trusted advisors, I took the opportunity to research your people and culture more deeply as neither the course work nor the library at Hogwarts told me much and If I'm going to be yours for three years, I wanted to know what I was getting into.  After finding what I did, I wish to apologize for my slights of your people, if I had known of your strong dislike of anchors like Tom's, I would have contacted you covertly and arranged for the one in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault to be dealt with by you."  She snorted, "Hell, if I'd known of that dislike at the time, I'd have contracted with Gringotts to hunt all of them, after Dumbledore dumped that mess on me, and gone to ground in the non-magical world while experts dealt with Tom's horcruxes."</p>
<p>She looked at the Minister, "Kingsley, I ask that you strongly convey to the Headmistress that Hogwarts is doing a grave disservice to her students by not giving them adequate and accurate information about the other peoples and cultures, magical and non-magical, we share this island with.  I wouldn't be in this situation if Hogwarts had given me this information.  We need something better than Binns' prattle about rebellions and the scant information in the Hogwarts library just for proper dealing with those who control our money; never mind that we stand out more and more when we venture into the non-magical world."</p>
<p>Kingsley Shacklebolt nodded, "I see, I will convey that to her most strongly.  From my time with the Prime Minister, I know how much we don't know there and you've just made it clear that we are doing equally poorly in educating them about the other magical peoples."</p>
<p>Daggerok cocked and eyebrow ridge as he replied, "No excuses, merely an explanation and an apology?  You aren't trying to excuse yourself from this debt?"</p>
<p>"Senior Teller Daggerok, I made a mistake due to faulty knowledge and, because of that, honorable goblins died.  Honor would not allow me to attempt to evade paying that debt."</p>
<p>The goblin nodded, "It will not affect your treatment, but it will be remembered.  I should also tell you that our legal experts agree with your interpretation of who can be held responsible for Riddle's actions; there are going to be some very unhappy families when we take action.  Now, what proposals have you for consideration?"</p>
<p>Juniper passed him the list she had worked on with Andi and Luna.  "These are all structured to secure some protection for me, not from the day to day conditions I know I'll face, but from long term effects."</p>
<p>Daggork looked the list over, "I can understand and agree to the "no permanent harm" clause.  Why the insistence on passing control of House Potter's vault to another?"</p>
<p>"As a slave, I have no right to property and I do not wish all that my ancestors worked for to be stolen should someone be opportunistic."</p>
<p>The goblin nodded, "Agreeable, though I daresay a few goblins will not appreciate that clause; there are rumors that some would attempt such.  Now, this final clause?"</p>
<p>"Protection against getting blindsided when I leave Gringotts after the three years, Senior Teller.  I do not wish to exit and find myself in an unexpected and unknown marriage situation or contract, nor do I wish to be blindsided by any other changes.  I do offer Gringotts the opportunity, in exchange for the hour a year with trusted advisors, to display me, as an anonymous slave, as they would on Gringott's steps; I'm certain I will find it embarrassing and humiliating, especially if I can hear all the comments but not respond."</p>
<p>"Very well, you seek no special position or advantage but merely seek to protect yourself and your heritage?"</p>
<p>"No, Master Daggerok, I seek nothing and no special treatment for myself.  Honor would not allow me to do so while paying this debt."</p>
<p>"Indeed, but that would not stop many wand-wavers we deal with; they would be begging, whining, cajoling, ,blustering, and otherwise attempting to minimize what happens to them.  I believe we have a deal, Lady Potter."  He pulled out a quill and the original of the contract and made the necessary changes.  "If this is acceptable, please sign it."</p>
<p>Juniper looked over the final contract as Kingsley read over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Contract of Servitude</p>
<p>I, the undersigned, in full possession of my mental faculties, and free of any compulsions, charms, potions, or geass, agree to this contract and its stipulations.<br/>1) I, the undersigned, will be an 'indentured servant' of Gringott's Bank, London.<br/>2) For a period of three years.<br/>3) During that time, I shall remain in the care of the Goblins of Gringotts, and will live in the goblin city of Tirith Ungul, which rests below London.<br/>4) As an indentured servant, I will have no rights or privileges afforded any normal bank customer or person, and will swear to follow any and all commands I might be issued, save for anything that would be construed as illegal by Gringotts, the Ministry of Magic, and the International Confederacy of Wizards.<br/>5) I will submit to any and all tasks, labours, punishments, etcetera, that I am assigned/will earn during my term of service.<br/>6) I will suffer no permanent harm, including but not limited to phyiscal, mental, emotional, psychological, and financial damage and damage to my reputation.<br/>7) During this time, control of the Potter vaults will be passed to the acting head of House Black that I may not have my heritage stolen.<br/>8) I will be allowed no contact with the outside world for the entire term except for one hour at the end of each year for consultation with the following trusted advisors: Andromeda Tonks, Luna Lovegood, and, if she chooses to accept, Hermione Granger.  In consideration of this, Gringotts has the right to display me as an anonymous slave on their steps for one day each year, the choice of day and means of display being solely their choice.<br/>9) I will agree to never speak to anyone of any secrets I learn during said term.<br/>10) I will agree to never seek retribution for anything that befalls me during this term, and will swear an oath to this effect.</p>
<p>Juniper nodded. “Do you have a blood quill on hand?”</p>
<p>“June, are you sure about...” Shacklebolt started.</p>
<p>“Blame my saving people thing,” she replied, taking the familiar black quill from Daggerok, “Besides, it gets me away from the public for a few years...” she scribbled her name onto the parchment, wincing as the letters scratched themselves into the back of her hand, before handing it back to the goblin. Apparently satisfied, Daggerock nodded and made a copy which he handed to her.</p>
<p>"This copy is yours to keep."</p>
<p>Juniper took the contract and the goblin senior teller turned, walking back into the bank without another word.</p>
<p>"You're really going through with this," Shack said disbelievingly. It wasn't a question.</p>
<p>"Too late to back out now," Juniper replied, rubbing her scratched hand. "Besides, if it means there wont be another war so soon after the last one..."</p>
<p>"You really are something else," he said, looking at her as though seeing her for the first time. "You can't just disappear. Not for three years. Not while the world is still picking up the pieces after Riddle."</p>
<p>"I'm tired, Shack. And, while not ideal, this is probably the best chance I have at 'getting away from it all'. If it prevents another war on the heels of the last, there's really only one choice I could have made. You know that."</p>
<p>Kingsley nodded, "Do you know how you're going to break the news to your friends?"</p>
<p>Juniper was silent for a moment, thinking about her life to come. "I'll figure something out."</p>
<p>***** King Killgrav's Office*****</p>
<p>"Did she sign, Daggerok?"</p>
<p>"She did, my king, and with only changes to preserve and protect her line, House, and heritage."  He passed the final contract over.  "She also apologized for her actions, through ignorance, explained how that ignorance originated, and charged their Minister with seeing that deficiency at Hogwarts is eliminated.  She did not attempt at any time to evade responsibility or avoid her debt."</p>
<p>The goblin king reviewed the final contract, "I can approve this and no honorable goblin can object to the protections she requested.  I suspect, though, that some will lament the loss of the opportunity to plunder the Potter vaults.  If she continues to act in honor, she may be worth treating as a captured warrior and not a dishonorable wand-waver."</p>
<p>"My thoughts also, my king, despite her causing my son's death.  She has done nothing but act with honor since our first meeting; it is refreshing,  I find myself conflicted, I should hate her for my son's death, but she acted out of ignorance and has acted with honor since we first approached her."</p>
<p>oOoOoOo</p>
<p>Two Weeks Later</p>
<p>Juniper and Andromeda had not sat idle. As the primary beneficiary of Sirius Black, June had been named head of House Black in 1996, but was unable to take up the family ring until reaching the age of majority - a date that would pass weeks after her debt was to be called in. Sitting with Minister Shacklebolt, she had reinstated Andromeda to the family, named her as acting head in her place, both for House Black and House Potter, and named Teddy as her heir and beneficiary.</p>
<p>This had the added benefit of reaffirming the transfer of control of the contents of the Potter family vault into Black family hands, ensuring the gold and possessions within would remain untouched throughout her sentence. Goblins as a rule never stole from the Wizards, but with the slave contract, she would lose rights to any possessions and it would not technically be theft at that point, even with the contract as signed.</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione had returned on the twenty-seventh, bringing with them her parents and newborn baby sister from Australia. It had apparently only taken a few hours to find the pair of Muggle dentists, but the conversation that had resulted from un-modifying their memories had taken the better part of the last three weeks.  Juniper had sent the couple an owl asking for them to meet her at the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmead, managing to convey the urgency of their meeting while remaining vague about what it was about - only mentioning it concerned her summons by Gringotts.</p>
<p>The bell over the door chimed as her two closest friends stepped inside, both wearing identical looks of confusion. Any other time, June would have laughed at them. Instead, she waved them over to her table, casting a half dozen powerful privacy charms they had utilized during the camping-trip-from-hell the past year.  Hermione was, predictably, the first to 'break'.</p>
<p>"What's going on, June?" she asked, using the affecionate nickname she'd come up with their second year. "Your letter was so vague it was like you were trying to be intentionally irritating. How did your meeting with the Goblins go?"</p>
<p>She wanted, more than anything, to tell them the truth. To explain that she would be less than even the lowest House Elf in the eyes of the law for the next three years. Instead, she decided to stick to the cover story that Andromeda had helped her construct.</p>
<p>"I've been offered a special assignment working with Gringotts," she replied. "The details are classified, but it will last for three years."</p>
<p>Hermione raised an eyebrow, but Ron cut in before she could say anything. "Wicked. But, I thought you wanted to be an Auror, not some curse-breaker like Bill."</p>
<p>"I'm not going to be a curse-breaker," Juniper said, honestly. "That requires NEWT level Runes and Arithmancy, neither of which I have. As for being an Auror, that was something I wanted to do in Fourth Year. Besides, I think I've faced enough Dark Wizards for a lifetime. This is...something else." Ron seemed mollified, but Hermione frowned slightly.</p>
<p>"True enough, I suppose," Ron conceded.</p>
<p>"Hey, Ron, why don't you go get us some drinks?" Hermione asked.</p>
<p>"Good idea!" Ron was up and making his way to the bar in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>"That should keep him occupied. He never could resist chatting up Rosmerta," Hermione said, turning to fix Juniper with a look. "Now, what's really going on?"</p>
<p>Of course Hermione would see through the lie. Juniper's heart sank. Careful not to let it betray her thoughts, and thanking her limited abilities in occlumency, she shook her head. "The Goblins have me locked in an unbreakable contract for indentured servitude, magically binding and signed in blood.  It's the only payment they will accept for the honorable goblins killed during our intrusion into Gringotts."</p>
<p>"If there's a contract, there has to be an exit clause," She persisted.</p>
<p>"Like the Goblet of Fire had one?" Hermione paled slightly. "I break this contract and I will lose more than just my magic, okay? It's only three years." Juniper smiled in what she hoped was a reassuring manner, but was more likely a grimace, "They'll pass before you know it."</p>
<p>"But June...what about visitors? Would we be able to see you?"</p>
<p>"Not that often, but the contract allows one hour at the end of each year for me to meet with trusted advisors to make sure I'm not blindsided by events and changes in the wizarding world.  Andi and Luna are two of them, I'd like you to be the third.  I need the smartest people possible advising me."</p>
<p>"You need ask, June?  Of course I'll do that."  The bushy-hared witch grimmaced, "Besides, you are taking the responsibility for my actions there, too, and I'm not sure I could do what you're doing."</p>
<p>"I got the drinks!" Ron announced, passing back through the privacy wards, and staring at the serious expressions on both girls' faces. "What'd I miss?"</p>
<p>oOoOoOo</p>
<p>Very Late Evening, June 14, 1998 - Early Morning, June 15, 1998</p>
<p>It was almost time. Juniper had used the last of her saved up money to buy dinner and rent a small room in the Leaky Cauldron the previous night. Kreacher was now working over at Hogwarts, under orders to check up on Grimmauld Place every couple of weeks to keep it tidy. Andromeda and Teddy were off visiting her late husband's family in America, and Ron was at the Burrow while Hermione spent the summer enjoying being with her parents and getting to know her new sister, who was already showing signs of being a powerful magical, before returning to Hogwarts in the fall.</p>
<p>The last two weeks had been busy. With Hermione officially in with them, she and her Trusted Advisors had painstakingly made certain every “i” was dotted and every “t” was crossed to safeguard her interests in the wizarding and non-magical worlds. Once re-instated in House Black, Andromeda Tonks had been confirmed and received as her proxy for both House Black and House Potter in the Wizengamot (the absence of representatives of several pureblood families making this far easier) and the votes of those two Houses, plus allied ones, made for a potent voting block in support of reform.</p>
<p>She had re-affirmed the alliance of House Potter with House Longbottom; in the aftermath of “The Battle of Hogwarts”, she had taken the opportunity to sit down several times and talk things over with Neville and they had ended up as not just friends but as the siblings-in-all-but-blood they would have been if not for a manipulative old wizard.. Consequently, Neville was now the only one of her friends, outside her advisors, to know the full story and his supportive embrace, that of a caring and concerned sibling, had helped bolster Juniper’s spirits. Her other friends had received vague letters using the agreed cover story. The other thing that bolstered her spirits was that the three witches advising her had taken to hugging her a lot.</p>
<p>The only downside to this period was that, despite her forthcoming travails, she needed to comfort a distraught Hermione. “I don't understand it,” she complained, “his behavior was great on our trip and I hoped he'd finally matured and I had someone, but he's returned to his prattish attitudes since we returned from Australia.. He threw a major tantrum because I was staying with my parents and my new sister, enjoying them, instead of staying at the Burrow with him; he really got upset about all the time I’ve spent advising you instead of being with him.”</p>
<p>“Molly hasn’t been much better, demanding that I come stay there among 'good and proper wizards and witches' to prepare for living the rest of my life with them and that doesn’t even touch how unhappy she is that you’re going off to do something else instead of ‘coming back to the Burrow to 'properly' mourn Fred'; I swear, I think she wants you to take up with George. I told Ron I'd see him on the Express, if he returns to Hogwarts, and, if he doesn't, I'll catch him when I can. Is it asking too much to have someone who sees me as me and nothing else?”</p>
<p>“Ah, 'good', old bi-polar Ron. You deserve better, Hermione, and, no, that's not too much to ask.. I’m a witch, not a wizard, but you know how I see you; you stuck with me throughout the search and I’ll never forget that. You mean so much to me.” Juniper hugged her close and she returned the hug.</p>
<p>Their last day together, Luna added full on kissing to her hug; she was surprised, but responded quickly. “You were the first to break through my facade, my first friend, and I will be there, waiting for you, when your travails within Gringotts are over and I promise to be there for every advisors' meeting.”</p>
<p>What surprised, and pleased her, was that Hermione did the same.</p>
<p>“You are my first friend, June. I will be there when you leave Gringotts at the end of your time and at every advisors' meeting between now and then.”</p>
<p>Now that the time was finally here, she realized how truly terrified she was. Suddenly, she was back in the Forbidden Forest, each step taking her closer to her coming death. Only, this time, she didn't have the shades of her parents or Sirius to talk her through it and keep her calm. A sudden chime interrupted her thoughts, and she turned to glance at the room's clock. Five minutes before she would officially be a slave to the Goblins. She looked down into her left hand, where the scroll was held. Three years of suffering awaited.</p>
<p>She took a steadying breath and, with a quick turn, apparated to the entrance of the Bank. Three Goblin guards stood there, as well as Daggerok and an unknown wizard in plain grey robes, his hood pulled up so his face was hidden in shadow.</p>
<p>"Many thought you'd run," Daggerok said, "But, I suspected that you would honor your debt, despite any fear."</p>
<p>"I've never backed down from anything in my life, Master Daggerok, I won't start now." she replied, trying to sound more confident than she truly felt. "Besides, honor and duty demand this of me." Judging by the tooth-filled grins on the guards' faces, she wasn't sure they'd bought her false bravado. The hooded wizard said nothing, and though his face was shrouded, Juniper could feel his burning gaze.</p>
<p>Seeing her looking toward the wizard, Daggerok said, "This is Unspeakable Croaker. As Goblins are not allowed to use a wand, " the venom in his voice was clear, "he will serve as the bonder for your magical vow. Turn over your wand, and we can begin."</p>
<p>Juniper was careful to remain as nonthreatening as possible as she withdrew her wand and passed it, grip first, to the hooded wizard. </p>
<p>"Good, now kneel before me, and take the vow," the Goblin commanded. Juniper dropped to her knees on the steps in front of Daggerok as the goblin stood over her, clasping their hands together. The Unspeakable stepped forward, mutely pulling out his wand.</p>
<p>"Do you vow to take on the role of indentured slave to Gringotts for a period of time of three years?" The senior teller asked.</p>
<p>"I do." she replied. A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the Unspeakable's wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire.</p>
<p>"Do you swear to follow any and all commands issued during your term of service?"</p>
<p>"I do." A second thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the Unspeakable's wand, joining the first.</p>
<p>"Do you swear to submit to any and all tasks, labours, punishments, et cetera, that you are assigned during your term of service?"</p>
<p>"I do." A third joined the first two, the warmth was becoming unpleasant.</p>
<p>"Do you swear to never speak to anyone of any secrets you may learn during said term?"</p>
<p>"I-I do." The heat from the flames increased as a fourth tongue of flame wrapped around his wrist.</p>
<p>"Do you swear to never seek retribution for anything that befalls you during this term?"</p>
<p>"I do-oooh.... aaahh!" The final tongue of flame seemed to wrap tighter than the others, burning into her core. The flames vanished, leaving an intricate weave of burns around his wrist.</p>
<p>"By the surrendering of your wand, and acceptance of the vow, you have fully accepted the contract," the Goblin senior teller said, "For the next three years, you are the property of Gringotts Bank and the Goblin Nation." </p>
<p>His task complete, the Unspeakable turned slightly and apparated away. Two of the guards grabbed Juniper by her forearms, and hauling her to her feet, dragged her into the main hall.</p>
<p>Daggerok continued to speak. "As of this moment, you have no rights of any kind. No rights of property. No rights of privacy. No rights of identity. No rights of humanity. When spoken to, you will address any Goblin as Master or Mistress, no matter their rank. You will eat what you are given, wear what you are given, perform whatever duties are ordered of you, and endure whatever is required of you. Do you understand this, slave?"</p>
<p>Juniper shivered, as the doors to the Bank slammed shut behind her. Before her, a group of ten Goblins stood, glaring at her. Two were larger than the rest, leading her to assume they were Lord Ragnok of London, and High King Killgrave of the Goblin Nation. In any other situation, she would feel honored to be in the presence of the two most powerful Goblins in Britain. Now, she only felt cold despair.</p>
<p>"I understand, Master," she replied, averting her eyes from the two royal Goblins in the crowd.</p>
<p>"Then here is your first command," Daggerok said, "Remove all your clothing. Unless you earn a covering, you will be nude at all times."</p>
<p>She could feel her magic pulsing with the command, urging her to obey. </p>
<p>"Yes, master," she said, and with almost mechanical precision, she undid the clasps of her robes, allowing them to fall from her shoulders into a heap on the floor. </p>
<p>She had expected such a command, and had taken the initiative to be prepared. As such, aside from the inexpensive simple pumps she slipped off her feet, she was already naked. While not overly large, her breasts were far from flat, respectable perky 34-C cups stood high and proud on her 5'-6" high frame; her mahogany hair cut in a short bob, head bowed, she awaited further commands. Years of toil at the Dursley's and Quidditch at Hogwarts had left her body lithe and wiry, toned with well defined, but not overdone, muscles. As a matter of preference, her pubic hair was neatly trimmed, framing her pussy, and gave proof that her hair color was natural. The cool air made her nipples hard and she a motion to cover her modesty, but a glare from Daggerok was enough to dissuade her of that notion.</p>
<p>"Great Mab!," exclaimed one of the guards, "What happened to your back? And your leg?" The scar tissue on both being extensive and noticeable.</p>
<p>Juniper grimaced, "Souvenirs of the 'loving family' Dumbledore left me with. My relatives were quite abusive, as you can tell. She raised one leg, "This was the result of 'Aunt Marge' setting her dog on me. If I never see them again, it will be way too soon." </p>
<p>"You come to us almost unclothed already, human?" one of the royals asked. "Are you so eager to be the plaything of the People? To allow us 'filthy beasts' to torment your fragile body? Speak...I, Killgrave, would know."</p>
<p>"I never intended harm to your people, your Majesty," she replied, making no move to cover herself. "Nevertheless, I did cause harm. The lives lost cannot be replaced, or even properly repaid, by my surrender, but honor demands that I pay for my actions; as the Christian Bible says, ‘Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission for sin, no atonement'.”</p>
<p>“To atone for the honorable goblins whose deaths I have caused, I must needs commit, as Mr. Churchill put it, my ‘blood, toil, tears, and sweat’ within Gringotts. Of course I’m afraid, no intelligent person would fail to be. However, if I did not at least try, even knowing what horrors might await me? Then I truly would be less than the lowest creatures of the world."</p>
<p>One of the guards seemed to think she was insulting them, and with a swift pull from his side, unfurled a whip that came artfully crashing down on one globe of her firm ass and curled under to strike her pussy. She was silent for a moment, eyes wide in shock, before a pained screech was torn from her lips and she barely managed to remain standing, shivering in pain.</p>
<p>"STAY THAT HAND, Crowhook!" Killgrave said, "She was not insulting us, but those even we Goblin's despise - the honourless and oathbreakers." He leered at the nude, shivering form standing before him. "Tell us, slave, who were you referring to?"</p>
<p>"T-t-t-to those bottom-feeders who have no honor, your Majesty, like those marked minions of Tom Riddle's and those who cloak their dishonor in the trappings of honor..”</p>
<p>“Good answer, slave! The rest was almost what I would expect from a goblin.” Turning to Daggerok, he commanded, "Have her cleaned, searched, prepared, and collared," the Goblin High King grinned, "remembering that I have claimed 'first ride on this mare', then take her to her new home for the next three years, and let her contemplate her fate for the rest of the night. LEN MAK!" </p>
<p>With that last Goblanachs phrase, the group dispersed, leaving only three guards, a Senior Teller, and a nude, shivering young woman, alone in the great hall.</p>
<p>"Start moving, slave," one of the guards, Crowhook, snapped, his whip twitching in his grip. "And leave the robes," he said with a nasty grin as Rose started to bend down to pick up her discarded garment. "You won't be needing them, or your shoes for that matter."</p>
<p>"Your pardon, master," Juniper replied, only to receive another sharp crack of the whip on her naked ass.</p>
<p>"That's 'Yes, Master' to you, slave!" Crowhook snarled.</p>
<p>"Y-yes, M-master..." she whimpered, tears stinging her eyes as she resisted the urge to rub her sore cheek. "Master goblin, if it please you, might I be allowed to dump these in the nearest refuse bin? It feels wrong to just leave these for your cleaning people to dispose of."</p>
<p>"And why should this matter to you, slave? What care you for these menials?"</p>
<p>"It matters because I was taught early to clean up after myself and, too, that would be the final ceremonial ending of the previous phase of my life. As for the menials, I have learned that they too are important to a smoothly functioning society and I don't wish to make their work more difficult; besides, as a slave I may be assigned to work with them and I don't wish to be remembered as ‘that wand-waver who gave us more work’.”</p>
<p>"Very well, gather them and take them to the bin on our way. Now move, before I grow impatient, slave," Crowhook said.</p>
<p>"Yes, master," she said. "Sorry for disobeying you, master."</p>
<p>"You'll do well to learn your place," Daggerok said, speaking up. "Now, move.  Crowhook, follow behind and make sure she keeps up."</p>
<p>Crowhook's answering grin was more frightening to Rose than his earlier outrage. She mentally vowed not to lag behind as they marched further into the bank, stopping to drop her armload in the first rubbish bin they came to.</p>
<p>Back in the shadows, one member of the cleaning crew looked at another, "A wand-waver who spoke for us and considered us, how strange. We must report this to our clan leaders."</p>
<p>For such short beings, the Goblins could move quickly when they were of a mind to do so. Juniper found herself having to practically jog to keep up with Daggerok and the other guard, her breasts bouncing with every step. Their path seemed to take them passed every office and suite on the floor, with every Goblin standing outside their respective offices jeering insults, openly laughing at her humiliation, or making obscene gestures that she really didn't want to know the meaning of.</p>
<p>By the time the procession had made it to the lifts located in the back of the bank, Juniper had slipped and fallen three times earning a total of seven lashes across her back, ass and breasts from Crowhook. The lashings across her breasts had surprised her, for as vicious as the strike was, there was no mark or blood. Only pain.</p>
<p>At her obvious confusion, the other guard present explained, "These are magical weapons. Clearly we don't want to devalue our property by unnecessarily damaging it. So you get the pain of being whipped without the lasting marks, and Crowhook here gets to smack you around to his shriveled heart's content."</p>
<p>Crowhook simply smirked, his lips curling nastily to show a row of sharp fangs, before bringing the whip down across her back, shocking her into falling once more.</p>
<p>"Enough, Crowhook," barked Daggerock. "You've had your fun. Now stop, before you take things too far!"</p>
<p>"I think I haven't taken things far enough!" Crowhook spat, "This little gylem is getting away with murdering my..."</p>
<p>"Griphook was an Uesg'zqiejq, and died an Uesg'zqiejq," the other guard interjected. "He gave this gylem information on the bank's inner security, and led her to the high security vaults. That he died after her escape only means the Nation was saved the trouble of executing him ourselves."</p>
<p>Crowhook moved to strike the other guard for his insolent tone. Instead of flinching away, the guard snarled something in Gobbledygook and Crowhook stopped. After a moment, he lowered the whip and, with a muttered reply, spat in Acacia's face before stalking back toward the offices.  She stood in mute shock as his saliva slid down her cheek. The lift doors opened with a clang and Acacia was pushed inside, Daggerock and the other guard stepping in behind.</p>
<p>"Was it wise to anger him?" Daggerock asked. "Crowhook can make your life difficult if he has a mind to do so."</p>
<p>"That emolek would have damaged the slave had he continued," was the response. </p>
<p>"I'm just glad he's gone," Juniper said, speaking up now that the shock of having been spat on had passed. "He was quite rude."</p>
<p>Daggerok slapped her in the mouth, shocking her into silence again. "He is a Goblin of the Nation and, as such, also your master. You will keep a civil tongue while speaking of your masters, understood?"</p>
<p>"Y-yes, master...I...I'm s-sorry, I misspoke."</p>
<p>"You can make up for your indiscretion, slave," the guard said, "and express your appreciation in a more appropriate manner for your station."</p>
<p>"I..."</p>
<p>"Get on your knees and service me, now, Slave," the guard said.</p>
<p>Her very magic compelling her, Juniper found herself dropping quickly to her knees and crawling toward the Goblin, her breasts swaying with each movement. She had never done anything like this...not even with Fred. She had to resist the urge to cry at the memory of the would-be Marauder. With trembling hands, she reached grabbed his trousers and pulled them down to his knees revealing two things. First, he wore no pants beneath, and second, he was hard. Standing just over four feet tall, his penis was nearly eight inches long and two inches wide. </p>
<p>"Don't just stare," he snapped, "it's not going to suck itself, you know."</p>
<p>Reaching out with shaking hands, eyes wide, she gripped his cock and began stroking it up and down. She leaned forward and licked the head slowly, wrapping her lips around the tip and sliding her head down slowly to take him as deep as she felt she could. Apparently impatient, he grabbed her by the back of the head, forcing his cock down her throat. She began to gag, unable to breathe properly, as he began roughly fucking her face. He continued in this vein for half a minute longer before pushing her roughly off himself. Juniper landed back to the wall, coughing and spluttering from his treatment of her. The guard stepped forward, and for a moment, she thought he would strike her with his fist. Instead, he grabbed her by the chin and forced her vivid green eyes to meet his onyx black eyes.</p>
<p>"Next time, move faster," He said, "And learn to breathe through your nose."</p>
<p>"Y-yes..." she coughed, her throat slightly sore, "Y-yes, master..."</p>
<p>"Now, get back to work," He commanded.</p>
<p>Quickly crawling back to her knees, Juniper reached out and took hold of the Goblin's cock, shoving the whole length down her throat not wanting to incur his wrath. Despite having had no prior experience, she found herself working as if by instinct. One of her hands holding his cock by the base, while her other fondled his testicles, already heavy with cum. She felt his fingers thread through her raven hair, gripping a handful to guide her. </p>
<p>Deciding to let her instincts guide her, she pulled the cock from her mouth, pressing it to her cheek and looking into his eyes while still stroking him, asked; "Am I doing a good job, master?"</p>
<p>"Yes..." He grunted, "Don't stop!"</p>
<p>"Yes, master," she said, licking his ball sack and running her tongue along his length from base to head before taking him back into her mouth, humming against the fleshy intruder in her throat. Within minutes, the Goblin grunted, and pulled her hair tightly, keeping her mouth around his cock as he ejaculated rope after thick rope of cum.</p>
<p>"I'm cumming!" the guard grunted, "Swallow it all, slave." </p>
<p>Despite the potently sour taste, Juniper dutifully tried to swallow everything, but it proved to be too much and she gagged, coughing the last mouthful out and onto the floor. Magic compelling her to complete the command, she knelt forward and began licking the floor clean - cringing inwardly at the taste, but unable to stop until the polished marble gleamed with her saliva - her mouth, chin and hair covered in the Goblin's seed.</p>
<p>The lift came to a stop with a chime, and Daggerok motioned for Juniper to follow him. As she began to climb to her feet, she felt a sharp kick knock her forward. Catching herself with her hands, she looked back to see the guard putting away his cock.</p>
<p>"You present such a nice view on your hands and knees," he said, "I think you can crawl the rest of the way."</p>
<p>oOoOoOo</p>
<p>Decontamination Chamber</p>
<p>Powerful torrents of ice-cold water sprayed from holes in the walls, assaulting Juniper from all directions. When the High King had said for her to be cleaned, she had expected a bath, if not a shower. 'Really', she thought, 'I shouldn't be surprised.' If the past hour was any indication, the Goblins wanted her submissive and humiliated. They certainly didn't seem to be interested in her serving as a domestic servant as the Dursleys had. The water stopped and two Goblins stepped into the room carrying scrub brushes.</p>
<p>"Raise your arms above your head," the first Goblin stated. Shivering from the cold, and noticing them both fingering the whips by their sides, Juniper decided to comply quickly. </p>
<p>The pair of Goblins began not-so-gently scrubbing her down, the brushes seemed to be self-lathering. What were those brushed made from? It felt like they were taking off at least two layers of skin with each pass! She bit her lower lip trying to keep from making any noises of discomfort. After being scrubbed raw and rinsed off, the Goblins left her to dry off.</p>
<p>After her 'shower', she was led down a long corridor to the archivist's chamber. The archivist, an elderly Goblin named Razorgrin, looked up as she stepped in. He looked like a shriveled, toothless walnut. His eyes were white with cataracts and the only hair he had was a few strands of wispy, white hair sticking out of his ears and nose. </p>
<p>"Ah, it's the gylem. Though, from your contract, I don't think that term quite applies to you anymore, hmm?" She shifted slightly, uncomfortable under his stare. "Well, no matter. You are Gringotts property, now, and need to be marked as such. There are two ways to go about that, and we are going to use both. Come, help me to my feet. I'm not as young as I look."</p>
<p>Juniper crossed the room and helped the old Goblin to his feet.</p>
<p>"We Goblins used to house magical Britain's convicted criminals, you know?" He began hobbling further into the room, expecting Juniper to follow. "In order to make the convicts more docile, they were fitted with a set of runic manacles that bound their magical core, effectively rendering them squibs. Even if they somehow managed to get a wand, it wouldn't work for them," the venerable Goblin said with a grin filled with razor sharp teeth. "This practice was discontinued in the early eighteenth century when the Fortress of Azkaban was appropriated by the Ministry of Magic as a prison. The island fortress came with a veritable army of demons whose very presence sent anyone into a cold despair, sapping the will to resist or escape...and in some extreme cases, even the will to live. The Goblins and their manacles were no longer needed."</p>
<p>Juniper looked mildly interested in the impromptu lesson, but her face must have betrayed her confusion. Razorgrin continued, "The point I am trying to make is that despite the manacles not being needed by the Vemc'vetiq, we kept them...and improved on the design. This is the result of those improvements." </p>
<p>The Goblin opened the box to reveal a black, leather collar with several runes etched along the interior. Juniper had never regretted having not taken Ancient Runes as an elective when she'd had the chance. </p>
<p>"Kneel before me, girl, and bare your neck. This will be yours while you reside in our city. This will be the only thing you should ever have to wear. The runes, in addition to suppressing your magic, will also keep you protected from heat and cold. You will not have to worry about environmental conditions effecting you adversely."</p>
<p>Juniper knelt and lifted her chin. He put the collar on place, locking it with a stroke of his finger.</p>
<p>"Squniqa Gringotts er auy neqj O," he incanted. She gasped, feeling the runs on the collar heat up against her skin. A feeling of restriction spread across her body, as though she were wearing a skin tight bodysuit. Once the restriction settled, another sensation spread from her core throughout her entire body. She gasped out loud. Her skin felt like it was on fire! "Ah, yes. Sensory enhancement. That would be one of the other improvements I had mentioned. How do you feel?"</p>
<p>Juniper moaned, reaching to grope her breasts, her nipples painfully erect. </p>
<p>"Oh, no we can't have that. You will only get pleasure that your masters give you, and take none for yourself." The command rang heavy in her ears, her magic responding, instantly forcing her to comply, sending her back into the crawling position, causing her to whimper softly. "That's better. Now, for your second mark. This one a bit more permanent." Her eyes widened as he pulled out a large, heavy looking iron brand with the seal of Gringotts Bank. "Now, this might sting a little..."</p>
