    <p>Draco remains unmoving as his husband dresses at the foot of the bed. He purposefully remains naked, lying on the rumpled bed as the other had left him. Draco has learned that attracting attention to himself now will lead to another bout of his husband’s rutting, staying unmoving was his best option and so he remains. His eyes lift slightly to look at the side table where a dagger rests innocuously, just were Lestrange had placed it before exercising his conjugal rights. For a moment, Draco indulges in the fantasy of grabbing the dagger and sinking it into the unprotected nape of his husband’s neck. He thinks of the resistance his hand would feel on the moment of impact before the sharp edge sunk into the flesh. He thinks of the warm blood that would spray and run down the edge of the blade and onto his hand, warm blood that would cool and dry, like the rivulets of blood that run down his thighs and had now dried. He imagines Lestrange turning to him, eyes full of astonishment at the realization that his Omega had stubbed him. Draco can almost taste the satisfaction he would feel. Then, Lestrange grabs the dagger and sheaths it on his belt, and Draco feels like he will cry again as he sees the blade removed from his field of vision.</p><p>“Summon Severus and have him clean you up. I want you presentable for the exhibition tomorrow” Lestrange says, looking at the bloodied and bruised blonde. He almost reconsiders his decision to annul his contract, the boy might be barren but he is beautiful. Even bloodied, his face bruised, dark marks running over his flesh, he still manages to look elegantly debouched rather than simply used. Rodolphus still remembers his pleasure at securing Draco as his third mate. He had been dying to mount the beautiful Omega since the moment he matured. He had lied, cheated, and even killed to make sure that Lord Malfoy approved his proposal and no other Alphas stronger than him competed for the boy. And he’d won him. The night of their wedding had been one of the best ruttings of his life.</p><p>But now, a few days before the first anniversary of their marriage, he is cutting the boy loose. He wishes he didn’t have to, but he does. He already has one barren mate, his first, ironically the boy’s aunt. Bella had been a beauty on her own right, which was why after it was proven that she could not conceived, he had not rejected her when he had the chance. Instead, he had thought that he could take a second mate, every Alpha is allowed to have three mates if they so choose after all. He decided to keep the beautiful and temperamental Black Heiress. So he mated Albion Wreckheron two years after his mating with Bellatrix. But he was not a fortunate Alpha. Albion did conceive before their first anniversary but miscarried the child. Despite this, by the time Albion had miscarried, a year since their marriage had passed and Rodolphus could not annul the union. It took Albion three more miscarriages and an extremely dangerous pregnancy to produce a child. Izor, who upon maturation presented as an omega and thus could not be named as Heir, was the only living child Albion has produced.</p><p>Then, Lucius Malfoy’s precious son, whom all expected to present as Alpha since the Malfoys had not produced Omegas or even Betas in centuries, shocked everyone by presenting as an Omega. And Rodolphus had won him. This time everything would be perfect, he had thought. He had a very young, beautiful mate, from a very strong genetic pool to breed. This one would surely give him a worthy Heir. Alas, it had not been so; his luck turned again and Draco proved barren as well. This time however, Rodolphus cannot indulge in keeping a barren mate tied to him because he is beautiful. He cannot put aside Bellatrix since the law only allows a year of conjugal living before petitioning for an annulment. If the Alpha lives a full year with any mate they are obligated to remain mated until the death of one or the other. Rodolphus cannot wait for any of his mates to die of natural causes; he needs an Heir, if not an Alpha at least a Beta that could inherit, his very position as head of the Lestrange household depends on this. Draco cannot provide this, and so Rodolphus needs a new mate. To obtain the right to mate again, he has to dissolve his union with the boy, there is no way around it. The idea alone makes him want to disrobe and take him again, this might be his last chance to do so after all. Well, if one of the whore houses that will be competing for the boy wins him, Rodolphus will make sure to visit him there, he thinks.</p><p>Lestrange hesitates and Draco tenses. He knows the man is considering mounting him again and he waits with bated breath until the older man finally moves away from the bed with a muttered “things to arrange for tomorrow,” before walking out of the room. Draco’s eyes fall shut in relief. Rodolphus had spent the last week visiting Draco as much as he had when they first mated. Only this time, instead of anticipating the visits, as Draco had when he was newly mated to the man, he dreads them. It seems almost inconceivable to Draco that there was a time when the thought of Lestrange had sent shivers of pleasure down his spine and molten desire through his veins. A time when he resented the time his Alpha’s other mates got to bed him while Draco slept alone.</p><p>Draco slowly begins lifting himself off the bed, wincing at the agonizing pain running through him. The fact that he does not become aroused by Lestrange’s touch anymore results in the pain he feels at his backside. He just doesn’t get wet for him anymore, which just makes the couplings all the more painful. But that pain is just one among many. His husband’s preferred way to show his displeasure for Draco’s empty womb is through beatings. Draco slowly makes his way to the bathing room in his apartment turning on the water and turning to look at the mirror as the tub filled. He hates to look at himself after his husband <em>visits</em> him. Despite this, he has a morbid fascination that forces him to examine the pattern of bruises, adding every blue, black, and green mark to a mental list that feeds into an avalanche of anger. He almost does not recognize the creature that stares back. He has lost weight, he notes, and there are bruises but those will vanish as soon as Severus gives him the potions.</p><p>What he can’t stand is his hair. His beautiful hair that had once cascaded to the small of his back is gone. Rodolphus had taken pleasure in chopping all of it off two days ago in a fit of jealousy at the thought that whoever owned Draco after the<em> Tribuens Virum </em>would get the chance to run their fingers through the silken strands. Now, instead of the beautiful tresses, Draco sports an uneven boyish hair style with uneven strands flying in different directions and one side clearly shorter than the other. He cannot stand to look at his hair, at the insult it represents.</p><p>He had managed to spend six months of his marriage happy enough, manipulating his husband into ignoring the fact that month, after month, one heat after another, he had failed to conceive. But his luck had run out. The first beating came when he bled after his seventh month of marriage, indicating that he had yet again not conceived. Since that beating, no cajoling from Draco’s part, no show of submission no matter how humiliating, had calmed the ire of the man that for all intents and purposes owned him. And now, Draco has an even bigger problem. His marriage is being annulled, and instead of returning him to his family, Lestrange has decided to hold a <em>Tribuens Virum</em>, which would allow those with the capital and the brutal strength to compete for Draco, a parody of the competition suitors participated in to win the hand of a noble Omega. But in this case, the competitors need not be approved by the family of the Omega. Anyone with enough money and willing to fight can participate: noble, merchant, or lowlife. This is how most brothels gain noble blooded concubines which sold for the highest of price. The brothels pay fighters to fight and win the dishonored Omega that is given away, and once they win them, they sell the services of the Omega to all who have the money to pay for them, and many are willing to pay since this is the only way they can ever hope to touch a noble blooded Omega. Such a life is a death sentence for any noble Omega.</p><p>This is punishment! Draco thinks as he moves quickly, despite the pain, to dress after his bath. Omegas have their hair chopped off and are given away this way when they are unfaithful. It is unheard of to turn a noble Omega into a whore simply because he or she is barren. His father had offered Lestrange compensation in order to allow Draco to return to the Malfoy household. But he had refused. Draco knows why. He has known since before his mating; he sees it in the pleasure burning in Lestrange's eyes when he contemplates Draco's nakedness as he did moments ago. Lestrange might hate him for his uselessness, but he is obsessed with Draco. If he returned Draco to the Malfoys, Draco would be forever beyond his reach. But, should he instead give Draco away to a brothel, he can avail himself of Draco’s body as long as he has the coin to pay for it. Draco is not willing to allow Lestrange the pleasure. He might not be able to stop the <em>Tribuens Virum,</em> but he sure as hell will do everything in his power not to end up as a glorified piece of ass sold to the highest bidder. His obsession with Draco’s body has always blinded his mate to Draco’s other attributes, particularly his brain and penchant for manipulation, this is something Draco will make sure he regrets.  </p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Draco quickly moves through the gardens looking for Blaise, the silk tunic that covers his head flying after him as he rushes through the flowered trails. His quick movements are the result Severus visiting and Draco taking a number of potions the disgruntled Beta had given him to heal his wounds. Severus never asked how he had been injured. Draco is sure the man has no need to ask. No one would dare abuse a noble Omega. No one other than said Omega’s Alpha that is. Draco had found out the hard way exactly how extensive the rights of his Alpha over him were after his first beating. He has no legal way of stopping the abuse because in the eyes of the law he does not exist. The realization that he was property and even his death would warrant little more than a slap to the wrist for his husband had made Draco contemplate suicide on his most desperate moments. Before Lestrange begun beating him, Draco had never so much as been spoken to in a raised voice. Going from a pampered little Nobel prince to beaten into unconsciousness had been the most traumatizing experience of his life, until the violent rutting had started soon after.</p><p>Draco had been shocked when he presented as an Omega but had not really been anywhere as devastated as his father about the whole thing. At sixteen, he had considered his mother’s life, pampered by her Alpha, kept safe, and living in the lap of luxury and saw very little wrong with it. Even when Lestrange had won his hand a year later, Draco had not been much concerned.</p><p>The man was admittedly older than Draco would have preferred his mate to be. At seventeen, Draco had hoped for a young mate; Lestrange was not his preference. Lestrange was two years older than Draco’s father after all, but he was not bad-looking and he was very rich and influential with the Council, in fact, like his father, Lestrange was a Council Member. Another problem that Lestrange had presented and had annoyed Draco more was that he already had not one but two mates. Draco would have much preferred an Alpha that had no other mates. His father had not mated another after his mother, despite the fact that she only produced one child, and that, after years of marriage. Despite the setback, Draco had decided to make the best of the situation. He was beautiful, not an arrogant assumption, a simple fact. Draco was beautiful with a slim but defined body, long legs, and a face that had been called mesmerizing on more than one occasion. He knew he could outshine his Alpha’s other, much older, mates.</p><p>And so he had. The first three months of his marriage had been all he had expected from life as the mate of a rich and influential Alpha. People bowed low as he passed and servants run to do his bidding. He could buy anything he fancied, and his husband was so enamored with him that he completely ignored the two older mates to spend his nights pleasuring Draco. His life <em>would</em> have been perfect if only his body had not betrayed him as it had.</p><p>Because Draco is barren, a fate worse than death for an Omega. Because of this single fact, he now sees his entire life dismantled before him. His adoring husband turned into a vicious brute that abuses and uses him as if he were a common whore. His father, although trying to help him, cannot hide his immense disappointment. Draco could tell from the last time they’d spoken. Now, he isn’t even allowed to speak to his family or exit the grounds until the day of the<em> Tribuens Virum</em>, at which time he will belong to someone else; he just hopes that someone else does not turn out to be a whore house.</p><p>His thoughts make him move even faster, looking for the only person still allowed to visit him. Blaise and he have been best friends since they were children. As they grew, they spoke of mating with each other, there was little doubt that Draco was an Alpha and the Zarbinis were known for producing Omega and Beta males. It would have been perfect. Instead, Draco presented as Omega as well as Blaise. Soon enough, Blaise was matted to Theodore Nott, and he seems more than happy with his Alpha, and Draco…well, Draco has seen better days.</p><p>“Hey. How are you holding up?” Blaise says as soon as Draco turns into the gazebo where they usually meet.</p><p>“Is everything in order?” Draco asks, ignoring Blaise’s question. The brunet nods hesitantly.</p><p>“What?” Draco asks, knowing the look of hesitation on Blaise’s face.</p><p>“Well…”</p><p>“I swear to all the gods, Blaise! I don’t have time for this. Did you get someone to compete that will win?!”</p><p>“Yes, yes. I put the money you gave me, plus Theo gave me another sum to make the pot more tempting. I got two Alpha’s willing to fight to win you and release their claim.”</p><p>“But what?” Draco says because Blaise could never hide things from him.</p><p>“They aren’t noble.” Blaise said.</p><p>“Merchant class?” Draco asks.</p><p>“Yes, one of them. Weasley’s the name.”</p><p>“I know that name.” Draco says frowning.</p><p>“His brothers are pretty well known they own a number of shops…”</p><p>“The joke shop Weasleys?!” Draco says aghast. “What would a fucking joke shop owner know about combat in a claiming arena?!”</p><p>“The shop keepers are his brothers not him. He is a big man, Draco, strong, and in any event, he isn’t the first one that will be fighting for you. We’ve got another Alpha, Weasley is just a safe guard.” Blaise says quickly.</p><p>“Who?” Draco says.</p><p>“A friend of Weasley’s. A mercenary.”</p><p>“A mercenary? Not even a merchant class man. Oh Gods…” Draco says despairing. He had been an idiot to trust this to Blaise. But what other options did he have? He was locked in this fucking house and the servants ran to Lestrange immediately if Draco even tried to set foot outside the place.  </p><p>“The man is a trained fighter, Draco. Theo investigated him, he is a vicious fighter, he says.”</p><p>“Yea, but I would still prefer a noble.” Draco says.</p><p>“What noble will risk his life for the sake of a barren Omega?” Blaise says slightly exasperated.</p><p>Draco wants to yell at him that it isn’t his fault that he cannot get pregnant. But what Blaise said is the reality. Noble Alphas competed, sometimes to the death, for the hand of desirable Omegas. But they did not take the same risk to acquire a concubine no matter how beautiful; even less when said Omega has been proven barren. And no trustworthy noble Alpha would need the money that Draco offered enough to risk their lives. Even though Draco had sold all the jewelry he owned to accumulate the amount, it was still modest amount since he had sold it in desperation to whoever would pay him immediately.</p><p>“This is the best we can do then.” He says closing his eyes. He will have two competitors in the arena, among dozens of other competitors hired by brothels or other nobles that wanted to acquire a mistress. Although, he should not despair. His father will definitely have a number of fighters competing as well. Lucius might not be able to intervene directly, but he will never allow his name to be besmirched by having his only son turned into a whore without making every effort to stop it.</p><p>“What’s the name of the second fighter?” Draco asks Blaise.</p><p>“Harry.” Blaise says.</p><p>“Harry what?”</p><p>“Black. Harry Black.” Draco frowns at the name but there can be no relation to his mother’s family, he is sure.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>“Hey mate.” Ron Weasley says to the tall brunet that just walked into his home.</p><p>“Everything in order for tomorrow?” Harry asks his friend as they walk into the kitchen and take a sit on the small table in the corner.</p><p>“Harry are you sure this is a good idea?” Ron asks for what he feels must be the hundredth time.</p><p>“We already got the money.” Harry says, lifting his hand and summoning two mugs and Ron’s home brewed beer.</p><p>“We could give it back…” Ron says frowning and taking one of the mugs Harry serves them.</p><p>“No, we can’t. We can’t pull out now. They won’t have time to find somebody else to fight for him.”</p><p>“What do we care?! You’ll be killed. I’ll be killed. You know no one talks of anything else. Everyone with enough coin is going to fight or hire someone to fight for them. I think every single major whore house will have at least two fighters in the mix. I don’t say he ain’t a good looking Omega but he is barren, what good is he to you?” Ron says his mug lifted half-way to his lips smacks back down on the table.</p><p>“I need him to get into the inner circle,” Harry responds and Ron looks at him frowning.“What? What are you looking at me like that for? This was your idea.” Harry says exasperated.</p><p>“That’s when we thought you could mate him, which you can’t.”</p><p>“Cause he’s barren? I can take a second mate later.”</p><p>“It’s not that! Hermione finished her research and we are sure that you won’t be able to mate him. He has a bond with Lestrange and you can’t change that.”</p><p>“Lestrange is repudiating him.” Harry says frowning and taking a gulp from his mug.</p><p>“That means nothing to the bond of an Omega. Lestrange mounted him first, so unless you kill Lestrange—”</p><p>“That can be arrange” Harry interrupts.</p><p>“You’ll end up hanged. Lestrange isn’t going to fight in the arena. If you kill him out of an arena, you’ll be charged with murder.” Ron says as if explaining a complicated concept to a rabid dog.</p><p>“What other ways are there to bond the Omega to me then?”</p><p>“Other than killing its other Alpha? Since he has no children by him, you’d need to get him pregnant.”</p><p>“Pregnant? Nothing else?”</p><p>“Which you <em>can’t</em> ’cause he is <em>barren</em>” Ron says very slowly. He looks Harry in the eyes trying to make him see reason. It was a good plan. If Harry mated the son of Lucius Malfoy he’d have access to Riddle’s inner circle, no doubt about it. But, without a formal bonding, there is no possibility of that happening. So, there is no point fighting for the Omega.</p><p>“Harry” he says with a sigh. “You want to restore your family. You are the last Potter alive and you are going to fight for an Omega that can’t even have children? You can be killed tomorrow in that arena, think about this!”</p><p>“I won’t get killed Ron. I’m not a normal Alpha, I’m the last Potter and I’m a mercenary.”</p><p>“There'll be a lot of mercenaries there. I’m not saying that your family magic won’t give you an edge, ’cause I’d be stupid if I said that. But one wrong move and that family ends tomorrow with you bleeding in the sand.” Ron tells his friend.</p><p>Harry looks at his friend for a while, seriously considering his arguments.</p><p>“I’m fighting tomorrow, Ron. If the bond between the Malfoy kid and Lestrange can’t be broken another way, then I’ll find a reason to challenge Lestrange and kill him. Draco Malfoy is the son of Riddle’s right hand man. Riddle depends on the Malfoy money. If I can formally bond with the little Omega, I can sway his father my way. There are a lot of things to be said about Malfoy senior, most bad, but the man loves his family, and I can use that.” Harry argues back.</p><p>Ron looks at his friend for a long moment before gulping down the rest of his beer.</p><p>“Fine,” the redhead replies putting his mug back down. “Have you told Sirius what you’re doing?”</p><p>“Not yet.”</p><p>“You aren’t gonna tell him, are you?”</p><p>“No. Better it be a surprise.”</p><p>“He hates surprises.”</p><p>“I know.” Harry says finishing his own drink.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The arena is full to bursting, Draco thinks as he walks to the raised platform where he is to sit next to his soon to be ex-husband. Lestrange is already there. Bellatrix and Albion sitting on either side of him, while Draco’s sit has been placed further from theirs and on a section lower that theirs on the platform. Draco had hoped he could have watched from a less conspicuous location. But as it was, he had to be <em>on display</em> during the fights.</p><p>He sits with his head held high, watching all the peasants and commoners that have gathered to watch the Alphas compete. He has never been as humiliated before in his life. He could not believe that it had come to this, his shame paraded before the gawking masses. He sincerely hopes his father destroys Lestrange for this humiliation and a many other things. He tries to spot Blaise and Theo on the balconies where the nobles had gathered. He knew his parents would not be present for this. It is an affront to their family and they would never have graced this arena with their presence anyway.</p><p>“Welcome All to this <em>Tribuens Virum.</em> Candidates please step forward” a small man yells standing at the bottom of the platform where Draco sits, his voice is amplified by magic ensuring that all hear him as he speaks. The man quickly begins introducing the men competing for Draco, but Draco barely hears the names the man declares and pays more attention to their status and station. “Alpha mercenary…Beta merchant class…Alpha merchant class…Alpha merchant class…Alpha mercenary…Beta mercenary…Alpha…” they seem to go on forever. Draco is a little surprised by the number of Betas present. They could not possibly expect to survive this with so many Alphas fighting today. “Harry Black, Alpha mercenary…” the man yells, and Draco’s head snaps to the side to see the man he’s hired to save his life.</p><p>Harry Black is an Alpha. That’s how Draco can think to describe him. Tall dark and somewhat bulky although not too much. In fact, leaner than the other Alphas that have been presented before him, this worries Draco slightly; although, until he transforms into his wolf form there is no way of saying how physically powerful he is. His hair covers his forehead and almost his eyes. The man feels dark to Draco, it might be that he is wearing a black tunic but Draco thinks it has more to do with the inky black color of his hair. Whatever the case, his last name suits him. <em>Let’s hope he is good for something,</em> is all Draco’s mind whispers. The little man continues to name the men and Draco again pays attention when he reaches the name Ron Weasley. He quickly determines that Weasley is as Blaise described him, a very big man. He has very red hair and a bulky built, a good Alpha specimen Draco supposes. His face is the opposite of that of his friend, open to the world, while the other’s is shut.</p><p>The men move around in the arena, and despite the number of competitors the arena is so big that they are not crowded. They begin disrobing, and Draco tenses. Many of the men have scars, some small but others massive, these are seasoned fighters. He turns to look at the two men he has hired, who are undressing close to one another. Weasley has no scars that Draco can see from a distance and Draco turns to look at Black only to note a surprising lack of scars for a mercenary. Draco only hopes that what Theo said about the man being a vicious fighter is true despite his appearance. He is contemplating this when the men begin to transform. The sickening sounds of bones shifting and breaking makes the crowd go silent and then the growling of the now massive wolves is the only sound for a moment, then all hell breaks loose.</p><p>Draco takes a sharp breath as the wolves attack one another. The arena’s sand is quickly painted with red that turns a muddy brown as the sand drinks it up. Opponents rip each other to shreds. Most of the fighters have lost all sense of control over themselves. This is to be expected, since almost exclusively the members of the noble houses are the only that possess magic powerful enough to allow them to maintain their senses while in wolf form. And then, Draco sees a large black wolf move away from an opponent and wait? The wolf seems to almost calculate his actions when his opponent snaps at him and exposes his neck. The dark wolf moves out of the way and quickly locks his powerful jaws on the sensitive area and shakes the other roughly until a sickening crack sounds. He drops the body and quickly moves to another side of the arena, where a massive copper wolf is fighting three opponents. Draco is shocked to realize that the black wolf is avoiding other opponents as it makes its way purposefully to the other side of the arena. That wolf, Draco realizes with astonishment... the man inside the wolf is completely in control.</p><p>His suspicion is confirmed when the black wolf attacks one of the copper’s opponents quickly disposing of him while the copper wolf takes down the other two. When all opponents are dealt with the two wolves do not attack each other, instead they stay close, <em>protecting one another</em>. Draco is sure they must belong to the same pack. There is no other explanation for how they are behaving. The copper is there helping the black wolf as the other had helped him. They are taking down opponents together, and Draco suspects that those two were his hired men. He is sure the raven wolf is Black because he saw him transform before chaos exploded in the arena.</p><p>Slowly the arena begins to clear. Many of the fighters have run away far enough from the bloodbath before transforming back and getting out of the arena. Most Betas left the arena almost as soon as the carnage begun, and those that didn’t are the carcasses that have been trampled underfoot. Draco watches, his heart in his throat, as the copper and black wolf corner another massive wolf on one side of the arena. Jaws snap quickly and the sharp canines of the large wolf lock around the hind leg of the copper wolf. The copper tries to snap at the other wolf but can’t seem to reach and then the black wolf’s jaws lock around the nape of the other and pull viciously. The massive wolf makes an agonizing noise before falling to the ground, dead or alive, Draco can’t tell. He watches the two remaining wolves and then the copper lowers his head slightly to the black forfeiting the fight and his possible claim to the Omega before walking slowly away, limping slightly. Draco stares at the black wolf completely astonished. <em>It worked! The man I hired won…I’m free</em>, he thinks watching the dark wolf transform back into Harry Black.</p><p>Draco quickly stands as the man walks naked from the other side of the arena until he is standing before Draco. <em>This is it. </em>Draco thinks waiting for the words, the words that will set him free. Waiting for the man to give up his claim. Black stops before him, blood dripping from his face, panting slightly, and his eyes, green Draco sees for the first time, catch Draco’s. <em>Say it! </em>Draco wants to scream. Almost there, almost <em>free. </em></p><p>“I claim you.” The man says, and Draco’s world crashes around him once more.</p>
