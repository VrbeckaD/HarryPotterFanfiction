    <p>For the first two years after the war Harry's life was a whirlwind of activity. He remodeled Grimmauld place and gave it to Andromeda and Teddy, then bought a 3 bedroom flat nearby so he could be with them often. He worked his ass off through auror training and made top marks in every area except occlumency. </p><p> </p><p>Four years after the war he was still putting in the hours and effort at work and he was on the fast track to be the youngest head auror in history. He gave his free time to friends and adopted family, and he loved them. But…. by this point he had realized how people thought of him. He could even admit that part of him enjoyed it, the way everyone treated him. They respected him, adored him, asked for his advice, needed him to be there to carry the burdens of life. </p><p> </p><p>There were days when it felt like too much though, like the constant stream of <em>please can you,</em> and<em> I knew you could</em>, or <em>we need you on this, </em>felt like it was too much to bear. Harry felt exhausted from being in charge all the time, making sure he never messed up, being what everyone expected him to be. They needed him, and he wanted to be needed, just not sucked dry. </p><p> </p><p>When he felt overwhelmed he would go for a walk, wander around without his auror robes, and pretend no one knew him. Most of the time he walked in muggle London and took the Underground when his calves started to burn. </p><p> </p><p>Tonight though, Harry was dressed in denims that were broken in, cumfy, with the back pocket torn from overuse. He paired it with a grey t-shirt and a dark hoodie. He had the hood pulled up to cover his ever recognizable, messy dark hair. He'd also traded out his normal round glasses for a pair of thin framed rectangle specs. He just didn't want to be bothered for a few hours, just didn't want to be recognized and, subsequently, asked for anything. </p><p> </p><p>He was strolling through Diagon Alley, retracing the path he used to patrol during his second year at work. Mostly watching his feet and blissfully disassociating from conscious thought, he didn't realize that he was halfway through Knockturn alley until he was standing in front of Cobb and Webb's. Only it wasn't Cobb and Webb's, instead the sign read Flog and Fanny's. Harry stood there, in the middle of the walkway, staring dumbly at the sign, trying to figure out when it had changed. </p><p> </p><p>"Harry Potter."</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt his shoulders tense at the sound of that voice. He turned around, already glaring, to face Lucius Malfoy. Lucius was in black trousers, matching black robes billowing around him, and charcoal dragon hide boots. Between the clothes and his platinum hair, he looked the exact opposite of Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't suppose I have to ask what you're doing in Knockturn alley, Lucius," Harry said, bitterly. </p><p> </p><p>Lucius regarded him with a critical eye, "You don't appear to be working at the moment." He glanced up at the building behind Harry, then met his eye, "I might ask what you're doing here, in front of a fetish club." </p><p> </p><p>Harry looked back at the sign again, he felt his cheeks start to heat and hoped that his hoodie would hide the blush. He cleared his throat, "I was just out for a walk. I didn't even know about this place," he said, waving a hand at the building. </p><p> </p><p>Lucius lifted his chin so that he was looking down on Harry. He stepped closer, spoke in a low voice, and said, "It's for people who like to be tied up, spanked," he leaned closer, "dominated."</p><p> </p><p>Harry swallowed thickly, "Why- why would someone do that?" </p><p> </p><p>Lucius tilted his head, he was so close that his long, white blond, hair brushed against Harry's hood when he did it. "Sometimes," Lucius said in a whisper, "people want to let go of the burdens, of being in charge all the time, of the constant pressure. This allows people to let go." </p><p> </p><p>Lucius drew off him, taking a graceful step back. "I was shopping." </p><p> </p><p>Harry opened his eyes, wondering when he had closed them. "What?" he said, breathlessly.</p><p> </p><p>"You asked why I'm out tonight. I'm shopping for Draco's birthday present."</p><p> </p><p>Harry tried, he really did. A voice in his mind, that sounded oddly like Hermione, was telling him to walk away. He couldn't though. It was that name, and everything that it evoked in Harry. He just couldn't help it. </p><p> </p><p>"It's June 2nd. I'm surprised you waited this long, his birthday is on Wednesday," he said, feeling like an idiot. Why would he say that? Why did he even know Malfoy's birthday? </p><p> </p><p>A slow smirk played on Lucius' lips as his eyes traveled the length of Harry's body. "You know Potter, you're absolutely right. I waited too long, I wanted to procure something for him that was special though. Something he would be highly pleased with. Until tonight, I have been unable to find the right gift."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh really," Harry said, feeling more stable now. "Are you going to buy him some ropes then? A paddle for spanking?" </p><p> </p><p>Lucius was still smirking as though he knew something Harry didn't and he couldn't wait to break the news. "Not exactly, no. I've seen you at the Ministry galas, watching my son. You seem transfixed by him."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know what you're-" </p><p> </p><p>"Come now, there's no reason to deny it," Lucius said. </p><p> </p><p>Harry stared at him, unable to come up with a response. </p><p> </p><p>"There's no reason to deny yourself either," Lucius said, his eyes flashing. "If you decide you want a break from being in charge, meet me at the tea shop next to Flourish and Blotts on Wednesday morning. If you're there I'll let you help me with Draco's birthday present."</p><p> </p><p>Harry watched as Lucius strode confidently away, down through Knockturn. He went home, his mind full of only one thought. </p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy. </p>
