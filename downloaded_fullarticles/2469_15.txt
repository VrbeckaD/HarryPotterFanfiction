    <p>Harry woke to the sound of Dudley and Blandina stomping down the staircase. As if it wasn't bad enough that Dudely weighed enough to shake the dust loose above his head, his daemon, Blandina was currently the form of something very large and heavy. Probably a pig because it was the form that she had already started to take a liking to, and because the one time she had changed into an elephant on the staircase, she'd cracked a few of the stairs. </p><p>Aunt Petunia hadn't been able to directly blame Harry for the incident, but she'd made it clear that as far as she was concerned it was Harry's fault anyways. She'd made him do yard work for a month to help "pay off his debt" for the contract they had to hire to replace the staircase. As much as they would force Harry to do manual labor around the house, contracting was beyond his skillset. </p><p>Ceridwyn, Harry's daemon, was currently in the form of a tiny sparrow. She made a little noise of frustration and ruffled her feathers. She didn't always take the form of such small animals, but shoved in the tiny closet under the stairs, it was easier for both of them, the less room she took up.</p><p>"Do we really have to go out there?" She whispered in Harry's ear. She shifted forms, taking on the shape of a white ermine, and cuddling against Harry's neck. "Can't we just pretend to sleep all day?"</p><p>"Aunt Petunia will be furious if we ruin Dudley's 'special day," Harry replied to her tiredly.</p><p>"I know," Ceridwyn agreed with him, sounding as crestfallen as he felt, which was exactly that, being that she was his daemon.</p><p>At that moment, Aunt Petunia started banging on the door to the closet, shouting at Harry that he needed to get up and come help with breakfast. </p><p>Harry made his way into the kitchen, not at all ready to deal with the rest of the day, but wanting to get the whole affair done with as quickly as possible.</p><p>Uncle Vernon was already sitting in the kitchen, a cup of coffee and his morning paper in front of him. He glanced up at Harry, and his eyes narrowed suspiciously at Ceridwyn who still in the form of an ermine, riding on Harry's shoulder. Despite the fact that Uncle Vernon's own daemon was a toad, he still made it very clear what he thought about people who had Daemons he disapproved of. He was also utterly convinced that it was only a matter of time before Ceridwyn settled into something sufficiently damning for him to write his nephew off for good. </p><p>Harry was almost positive that no matter what Ceridwyn settled as, Uncle Vernon was going to disapprove. Snake were slimey, rodents were sneaky, dogs were brainless, felines rude. The list went on and on. Most of the time, he tried not to pay any attention to his Uncle's snide remarks. Obviously not everyone that who had a rodent was sneaky. His teacher last year had a lovely little grey and white rat for a demon, and she was one of the sweetest and smartest women that Harry had ever met.</p><p>"Hurry up, boy, watch this!" Aunt Petunia told him in her shrill voice, shoving him towards the stove and the cooking sausages. Her little poodle daemon eyed Ceridwyn. She'd been known to nip Harry's Daemon if she got too close. Luckily, unlike if Aunt Petunia owed a regular poodle, Harry didn't have to worry about Tiarnan biting his ankle's</p><p>Dudley and Blandina were already  seated at the kitchen table among an absolutely enormous pile of presents. He had more presents at the table than Harry had seen in his entire life.</p><p>Ceridwyn turned into a little green snake and wrapped herself around Harry's neck. He didn't like being jealous of all of the presents Dudley and Blandina got every year for their birthday, but sometimes it was hard not to be. Life wasn't fair for Harry. And as Uncle Vernon liked to remind him, it wasn't fair to them that Harry's parents had died and forced him and his Aunt to look after him.</p><p>Harry tried to focus on cooking breakfast as Dudley screamed and shouted about he had fewer presents this year than last year. Secretly, Harry thought that it really didn't matter how many presents he actually had piled up. It was unlikely he would or even count them all up at that point. Aunt Petunia could have told him he had 45 presents and he probably wouldn't have known the difference.</p><p>"What's he smirking about, Mummy?" Dudley's whinny voice came, piercing into Harry's amusing thought.</p><p>"Boy, are you almost done cooking that sausage yet?" Uncle Vernon fumed, face turning an alarming shade of purple and tried to swivel in his chair to look at Harry.  His little toad dameon, Éimhear, was staring at Harry disdainfully from the kitchen, as if she herself wasn't a literal toad. Usually, Harry didn't have a problem with toads, but he made an exception for Éimhear. Non-Daemon toads were much more pleasant.</p><p>"It's almost done, Uncle Vernon," Harry told him, quickly wiping the smile off his face. It wasn't worth being punished over from just thinking mean things about Dudley. </p><p>Harry dumped the cooked food onto a plate and deposited it onto the kitchen table before returning to the kitchen to make his own breakfast. He would have loved some of the sausage and the pancakes that Aunt Petunia had already put out, but he knew that was never going to happen. He contented himself with a bowl of plain corn flake cereal and milk, sitting at the far end of the table, trying to be as undisturbing to Dudley and the massacre he was currently inflicting upon his presents.</p><p>When the phone rang, Harry thought nothing of it, pushing his corn flakes around and wondering what he was going to be doing that afternoon at Mrs. Figgs house. </p><p>"Vernon," She hissed at her husband and cast a glance at Harry. "Mrs. Figg has had an emergency and can't take the boy."</p><p>It was the tone of her voice that caught Harry's attention, and he turned his head slightly to hear what the adults were saying to each other. He didn't need to have bothered. </p><p>"I am not taking him with us to the zoo!" Uncle Vernon bellowed, his frog Daemon swelling up to far bigger than her normal size, reflecting her person's irritation.  Tiarnan's ruff raised in response to Uncle Vernon's raised voice at his wife, though Aunt Petunia's own demenor did not change all that much.</p><p>"Well, I'm not having him stay here in the house by himself." Aunt Petunia tutted back at him, "He'd probably burn the entire thing down."</p><p>Dudley started wailing then, about how they were all ruining his birthday, and suddenly it became a cooperative effort on Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's half to get him smiling and not crying again.</p><p>Unfortunately, there wasn't much his family could do about the situation. To his delight, within the hour, Harry found himself, for the first time in his life, on his way to the zoo.</p><p>He didn't care how many times Dudley and his friend, Piers, poked and picked at him in the car ride there, he was more excited than he could remember being about anything. Ceridwyn could barely contain herself, now a small gray squirrel, practically vibrating on Harry's shoulder. </p><p>The zoo was everything that Harry imagined it was and better. Ceridwyn flitted from form to form, mimicking all of the animals that they saw, seeing if any of them were the right form for herself. At first Piers' and Dudley's daemons did the same, until Dudley made a comment about how childish it was for Harry to be so excited and their Daemons stopped flicking through forms. </p><p>At one point, Dudley began to shout that he wanted an ice cream, and Harry didn't even care how obnoxious his cousin was being or that he wasn't going to get an ice cream, either. Ceridwyn was currently a Rainbow Lorikeet, and kept stretching out her wings for Harry to look at the multitude of colors and admire. He thought that she might actually be having more fun than he was. It wasn't often that she was able to take on any shape that she liked, given how small their "bedroom" was and it made him happy to see her literally get to stretch her wings. </p><p>Harry patiently waited slightly to the side of the the rest of the group while the other boys got their treats, handing over some of the pocket money they'd each been given for the day.</p><p>"And what about you, young man?" The woman handing out the ice cream asked. Harry glanced at her Daemon, also a Rainbow Lorikeet, though settled, and blushed slightly realizing where Ceridwyn had gotten her inspiration. </p><p>"Uh," Harry faltered, not expecting to be put on the spot. "I'm don't-"</p><p>"Ah, spent all your money in one place huh?" The woman said with a laugh, and pulled a cone out of the cooler, "This one's on me. My favorite is the Super Choco Fudge Cone!"</p><p>"T-Thank you!" Harry stammered, taking the cone from the woman. The woman's lorikeet Daemon did a little dance on her shoulder, fluffing up her brightly coloured plumage. Ceridwyn did a little return dance, though much shier after the pair of them had been put on the spot like that.  </p><p>Uncle Vernon looked like he wanted to knock the ice cream cone right out of Harry's hand, but miraculously managed to refrain himself. Aunt Petunia and her Daemon were looking anywhere but Harry and his impressive ice cream, as if she couldn't see him and the cone they might not exist. </p><p>The ice cream was some of the best he had ever had in his life. Occasionally he'd had some at school on an especially hot day, when they were given ice pops for dessert. Never anything like the mountain of ice cream and chocolate he currently held though. Ceridwyn even took the opportunity to taste some of the ice cream, although she herself didn't need to eat or usually care to. She chirruped a little though at the sweet coolness of the ice cream, doing another little lorikeet dance for Harry, making him laugh and almost drop his cone. </p><p>He liked the zoo slightly less when they went through the aquarium section after and Ceridwyn insisted on turning into a octopus and he had to hold her while she flopped all over him. She didn't last long like that, thankfully, and soon Harry found himself holding an otter instead, which was much better as far as he was concerned.</p><p>They almost made it through the entire day without any problems. </p><p>Ceridwyn had always liked turning into snakes, and in the reptile house, there were plenty of different kinds for her to try out, her scales going through a myriad of sizes and colors as they looked in each and every tank.</p><p>Dudley and Blandina had other feelings about the reptiles. Snakes especially fell into the "No son of mine!" category that Uncle Vernon liked to bellow about, as if Dudley actually had any sway over how Blandina would eventually settle. Harry doubted it would be a snake though, seeing as how very clever and graceful they could be, and how very stupid and offish Dudley was all of the time.</p><p>"This is boring," Dudley whined, plinking on the glass of a very large tank that was supposedly home to one of the largest snake at the zoo. The snake was not doing much, basking on a large rock, and unmoving. </p><p>Ceridwyn was a pretty little corn snake wrapped around Harry's wrist, though she'd picked an unlikely color for her scales as they shimmered in pastel rainbows, clearly reminiscent of the lorikeet form she was recently fluttering around in. She was clearly still having a good time, even if Dudley was being awful.</p><p>Harry apologized to the snake that Dudley had been bothering after his cousin wandered away.</p><p>"Harry?" Ceridwyn said looking at her human in brief confusion. </p><p>Harry was distracted though, as the snake in the tank suddenly raised it's head up, looking right at Harry.</p><p>"Can you understand me?" Harry asked, feeling both slightly foolish and awestruck at the same time, as the snake dipped it's head slightly in what Harry could only assumed was the snake equivalent of a nod. </p><p>"Harry!" Ceridwyn hissed in his ear, sounding very upset.</p><p>"Mummy, look what the snake is doing!" Dudley shrieked from across the room. A second later, Harry found himself being shoved onto the floor, landing hard on his side. Dudley shrieked again, but not words this time. There was a loud splash and Harry looked at the snake tank and realized that Dudley was inside the tank now, and the snake was outside of the tank. The snake was causing all sorts of mayhem in the reptile house as other patrons suddenly realized that it was in fact a very real and very large snake, not in it's enclosure. Harry could have sworn that  it hissed a "thanks" as it slithered by him before moving on it's way.</p><p>Harry's eyes widened in shock as his watched cousin gasped and screamed trying to pull himself out of the snakes water and then suddenly realizing that he could not get out of the tank anymore. Aunt Petunia's scream of terror filled the air as she locked onto the obscenely loud sound of her son, splashing in the tank. He really did look like a pig at that moment Harry thought, and couldn't help a small surprised laugh that escaped from him. </p><p>"This is your doing," Uncle Vernon snarled in a low growl, grabbing Harry from behind, picking him up off the ground by the back his shirt. Harry let out an "Eep!" of surprise as he was lifted clean off the ground for a moment before his Uncle dropped him roughly on his feet. "I told you no funny business today, boy."</p><p>Harry gulped hard and did not move from out of Uncle Vernon's grip for the rest of the trip to the zoo. They had to wait for a bewildered group of zoo workers to recapture the snake, and let Dudley out of the tank. The zoo staff asked all sorts of questions, trying to figure out what exactly had happened. Dudley just kept moaning about the glass disappearing and reappearing. Eventually, they let the family go when they realized that it wasn't some sort of practical joke and Uncle Vernon started to threaten legal action.</p><p>"He ruined my special day!" Dudley wailed the entire car ride home. </p><p>Harry shrank in his seat, trying to make himself as small as possible, not wanting to know what kind of punishment was waiting for him when he got home. Ceridwyn was a mouse, curled up at Harry's shirt collar, small and staying in close contact with her human for comfort. He didn't know how Dudley had ended up in the snake tank, and he didn't know how he could have played a part in it, no matter how much he would have wanted something like that to happen to his awful cousin. Glass didn't just disappear and reappear like that. There was no such thing as magic. </p><p>Uncle Vernon dragged Harry into the house as soon as they arrived at home. He practically threw Harry into his closet, and Harry stumbled into the cramped space, catching his knees on his cot, and falling forward. Then the door slammed shut behind him and Uncle Vernon slammed the lock on the door hard enough that it sounded like it might actually break. </p><p>"You will stay in there and not make another sound until I say otherwise!" Uncle Vernon bellowed in the hallway before stomping off. Harry could hear Dudley and Blandina snicker through their snivelling as they passed by the door, before starting up their wailing again about how Harry had ruined his Birthday.</p><p>Harry curled up on his cot, tucking his legs up. Ceridwyn shifted into a cat, and curled up next to him, purring slightly, trying to comfort him, though she was just as miserable as he was. He laid there in the dark, gently stroking Ceridwyn's soft coat, trying not to listen to his Aunt and Uncle placate Dudley, and instead tried to think about the zoo, and how different his life would be if the ice cream woman with the Rainbow Lorikeet had been his Aunt instead. </p><p>It was a nice thought.</p>
