          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Potter! What in the name of Merlin are you doing in my room?!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘<em>your</em> room’? This is my room! I got it assigned when I checked in.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? It’s <em>my</em> room!”</p>
<p>“No it’s not. Look, I have the key and everything.”</p>
<p>“What?! This is unacceptable, I thought this was a <em>singles cruise</em>! Then shouldn’t the cabins be single ones?”</p>
<p>“Well, they never mentioned I’d be cooped up with anyone when they checked me in.”</p>
<p>“Yes, <em>of course</em> they wouldn’t, because it’s a <em>singles cruise</em>. There’s obviously been a mistake.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Don’t ‘yeah’ me and shrug like this isn’t a disaster! What do you propose we do now?” </p>
<p>“Well, take it up with reception, there’s nothing <em>I</em> can do about it.”</p>
<p>“Hmpf. I suppose I’ll have to do that. And I <em>suppose</em> you’re not going to do anything about it?”</p>
<p>“Well I’ve already got my cabin, so, no.”</p>
<p>“<em>Hmpf</em>! You’re as useless as ever, Potter. I’m going to go sort this out.”</p>
<p>“You do that, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“And I’m leaving my luggage here, since this is <em>my</em> cabin. And don’t you dare snoop in any of my bags!” </p>
<p>“Wouldn’t dream of it. I’d hate to find anything embarrassing like handcuffs or a whip.”</p>
<p>“ … “</p>
<p>“Oh my god, you have that with you, don’t you?!”</p>
<p>“That is none of your business, Potter. And so what if I have? I refuse to be kink shamed by Mr Vanilla.”</p>
<p>“Like you know anything about my sexual preferences, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“I… You… I… I’m going to reception!”</p>
<p>“Well don’t let the door hit you on the way out! (Or maybe you’d like that.)”</p>
<p>“I heard that!”</p><hr/>
<p>“Well, the absolute cow at reception was <em>no</em> help. No help at all.”</p>
<p>“Because she told you this is my room?”</p>
<p>“<em>No,</em> you absolute pillock, because she told me that every other cabin on this ship is already booked, so <em>apparently</em> we have to… share.”</p>
<p>“Share? As in, stay together for the entire trip?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Potter, I believe that is the definition of sharing a room.”</p>
<p>“And they couldn’t do anything about it?”</p>
<p>“Apparently not.”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>“You know… It could be that I was the one asking.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Oh, do keep up, Potter. I <em>mean</em>, that you could use your fame to an advantage here. Make them bump you up to first class or something.”</p>
<p>“This is first class.”</p>
<p>“What? This?! But it’s tiny!”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you know what class you booked?”</p>
<p>“I assumed they downgraded me since I arrived late to check in. I would <em>never</em> in my life think that this… cupboard would count as first class.”</p>
<p>“Believe me, Malfoy, this is nothing like living in a cupboard.”</p>
<p>“A suite, then.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Ask them to put you in a suite, then.”</p>
<p>“Get a grip, Malfoy, it’s a cruise ship, this <em>is</em> the suite!”</p>
<p>“Well, just go down there and do something! Surely they must be able to accomodate the Boy Who Lived?”</p>
<p>“I… I don’t like doing that.”</p>
<p>“Doing what?”</p>
<p>“Taking advantage of being famous, I don’t like that. I don’t want any special treatment, I’m… I’m just like everyone else.”</p>
<p>“ … “</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me like that?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, sorry, I… I was… baffled - yes, baffled - at the fake modesty, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Look, Potter, can’t you just go down there and work your charm and get us out of this mess?”</p>
<p>“ … Work my charm?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Go down there and give her that brilliant smile of yours, make her weak in the knees so she’ll do whatever you ask her.”</p>
<p>“ … That’s what you think I do?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it? It’s what you usually do to me when you want help with figuring out potions… hrm, never mind, just go and get this fixed.”</p>
<p>“I… <em>Fine</em>, I’ll go.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“But it’s only because I know you’ll never bugger off if I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, old habits die hard, I know. Now go.”</p><hr/>
<p>“Bad news, I’m afraid, Malfoy, they said it was — What are you doing?! Are you going through my stuff?!”</p>
<p>“Potter! Back already?”</p>
<p>“Apparently. And <em>apparently</em>, you’re going through my things!”</p>
<p>“I dropped something, and it rolled under one of your bags.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“What did you drop?”</p>
<p>“I… My… My passport. Yes! My passport.”</p>
<p>“Right. Your passport fell out of your hand and <em>rolled</em> under my bag.”</p>
<p>“It… It got hit with a scurrying away charm?”</p>
<p>“Did it now?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Very rare things happen to magic out here at sea.”</p>
<p>“So if I were to cast an <em>Accio</em>, you know, <em>because I’m a wizard</em>, it would come zooming towards me from the floor and not from your coat pocket?”</p>
<p>“ … You were saying they couldn’t do anything about this mix up?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Apparently, the ship is overbooked, and they don’t have any extra space or extra beds anywhere.”</p>
<p>“And you tried flirting with her?”</p>
<p>“I… what?”</p>
<p>“You did the whole looking at her from under your fringe, while giving her that dazzling smile, you know, the one that makes your eyes light up and… er…”</p>
<p>“ … ‘That dazzling smile that makes my eyes light up’?”</p>
<p>“ … I mean… “</p>
<p>“ … “</p>
<p>“So we… hrm… We have no other option than spending this entire trip in the same cabin?”</p>
<p>“I guess not.”</p>
<p>“And this is the bed that we’re supposed to share?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And no extra beds are available?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“And there’s no sofa in the cabin?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“Well maybe we could transfigure something into a bed or a mattress or even a sleeping bag?”</p>
<p>“I checked, but they said it’s impossible to use that kind of magic in this confined space when there are so many other magic folk aboard. And a stretching charm won’t work either.”</p>
<p>“Honestly. I paid a fair amount for this trip, and now I have to share a room with the man with the biggest head in Britain.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I’m not too chuffed either.”</p>
<p>“So, how do we do this?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Do I have to spell everything out for you? <em>This</em>! How do we share a bed? Do we take turns? Does one of us sleep in the chair?”</p>
<p>“You know… We may not even need to share a room.”</p>
<p>“Because you volunteer to sleep out on deck?”</p>
<p>“Very funny, Malfoy, but no. Think about it. We’re on a <em>singles cruise</em>. This is literally a place to hook up. If one of us, or both even, get lucky tonight, maybe neither of us will spend the night here.”</p>
<p>“You… You actually have a point there, Potter.”</p>
<p>“Shocking, I know.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm… I did book this cabin to be able to impress a potential conquest, but… I guess desperate times call for desperate measures.”</p>
<p>“That’s the spirit.”</p>
<p>“Right, it’s settled then. We both find ourselves a suitable partner for the night, or for the duration of the trip, even, and we make sure we sleep in their rooms. You’re not half as dim-witted as you look, Potter, I’ll give you that.”</p>
<p>“Was that a compliment? Malfoy, I’m so very touched.”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, it was bound to happen some time.”</p><hr/>
<p>“Right, I’m off then. Good luck tonight”</p>
<p>“Potter, wait!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I… Is that what you’re wearing?”</p>
<p>“Yes? What’s wrong with it?”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing, if your goal is to pass as a member of the cleaning crew.”</p>
<p>“Well, what do you propose I wear then? All the clothes I’ve brought are basically like this.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Potter, I have the perfect outfit for you.”</p>
<p>“You… You mean…”
</p>
<p>“I don’t usually share my clothes, but I’ll make an exception if it’ll increase my chances of getting this room to myself.”</p>
<p>“Why would you be here by yourself, I thought we agreed that both of us would try to pull tonight?”</p>
<p>“Ha, that’s cute. Who do you think stands a better chance, the Chosen One, or the former Death Eater? Now, take this.”</p>
<p>“I honestly don’t care that you used to — oh wow, what <em>is</em> this material?!”</p>
<p>“Have you never seen cashmere before, Potter?”</p>
<p>“It’s so soft! I bet this will feel great against my skin!”</p>
<p>“ … “</p>
<p>“Are you alright, Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh! Yes! Yes, I’m fine. Are you going to try that on?”</p>
<p>“Definitely! If you’re okay with it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, quite okay.”</p>
<p>“But don’t look at me while I’m changing!”</p>
<p>“I… excuse me?! I’m not some sort of peeping Tom!”</p>
<p>“I saw you checking me out before.”
</p>
<p>“I was only looking out for sea rats. Clearly.”</p>
<p>“Sure you were.”</p>
<p>“(If anything <em>you</em> used to be the one always checking <em>me</em> out. ‘Malfoy’s up to something’ this and ‘he’s hiding in the Room of Requirement’ that.)”</p>
<p>“What was that? I can’t hear you.”</p>
<p>“Nothing! Nothing of importance. Are you done?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, take a look. Does it work?”</p>
<p>“ … “</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re alright, Malfoy? You look a little pale.”</p>
<p>“Hrm, thanks for your concern, I’m quite alright.”</p>
<p>“So what do you think?”</p>
<p>“(I think I’ll have to burn those clothes after this trip.) Well, that looks more tolerable.”</p>
<p>“You think so? And you’re fine with me borrowing them?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, Potter, completely fine.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, I owe you one.”</p>
<p>“Right. If you get lucky tonight, you know who to thank. Just… try to treat it with care even… even if things get… heated tonight.”</p>
<p>“Right. I’ll, er… I’ll try to keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.“</p>
<p>“ … “</p>
<p>“ … “</p>
<p>“ … Do you think…? Could you maybe show me how to properly remove it?”</p>
<p>“I… What?” </p>
<p>“I mean… I wouldn’t want to ruin your sweater now that you’ve so graciously lent it to me.”</p>
<p>“No, of course… Of course not. How, um… very considerate of you.”</p>
<p>“Well, I do try.”</p>
<p>“So… you just need to… make sure you slide your hands in under the hem… like… like this.”</p>
<p>“Yes…?”</p>
<p>“And… I really think the gentlest way is… is to have your… potential partner to remove it.”</p>
<p>“Mhm… Could you… could you show me the best way to do that as well? Just so I don’t screw up, of course.” </p>
<p>“Of course! Happy to oblige. Especially to spare my clothing.”</p>
<p>“Wait, I…”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry, did I…?”</p>
<p>“No, I just need to remove my glasses first, or they’ll get caught in the neck.”</p>
<p>“Right… rig— oh.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“N-nothing, it’s just.. your eyes look ever greener without the glasses, or maybe it’s because you’re so close. I mean— ”</p>
<p>“Malf— Draco.”</p>
<p>“(<em>Draco</em>.) I mean, yes?”</p>
<p>“ I… I have a confession to make.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I… Ipaidthecrewtoputusinthesameroom.”</p>
<p>“<em>What</em>?”</p>
<p>“I… When I arrived I saw your name on the guest list and I… paid the crew to put us in the same room.”</p>
<p>“No, I heard you the first time. I was just astounded that they didn’t tell me anything when <em>I </em>paid them not to fix it.”</p>
<p>“You did what now?”</p>
<p>“Well I wasn’t going to let this opportunity slip away, was I? I’ve been into you for <em>months</em>.”</p>
<p>“You’ve —“</p>
<p>“I mean… (<em>Shit.</em>)”</p>
<p>“Draco. I… Well obviously I’m into you as well. I mean, I’m an Auror and I <em>bribed </em>someone so I could —”</p>
<p>”Harry.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Shut up and kiss me.”</p><hr/>
<p>“Morning, Dave.”</p>
<p>“Morning, Alan. <em>Merlin</em>, 48 hours feels like a lifetime, doesn’t it? Are you done soon?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I only have one cabin left, but there’s still a ‘Do not disturb’ sign hanging here.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Don’t they know check out closed an hour ago?”</p>
<p>“I think they’re… er, <em>occupied</em>.”</p>
<p>“What —”</p>
<p>“(<em>Merlin, Potter, don’t stop, </em>yes!<em> Oh, </em>fuck<em>, right there!</em>)”</p>
<p>“ … <em>oh</em>.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“One thinks they could’ve done with a few privacy spells.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, you know how it is. I’ve been here for so long I’ve seen most of it. I mean the lad’s been through enough, he could do with letting off some steam.”</p>
<p>“You’re too generous, Alan.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess I’m going soft… I’ll give them 15 more minutes before I’m summoning the security team. He may be the Saviour, but he’s <em>not</em> making me miss the Appleby Arrows vs the Kenmare Kestrels on the wireless.”</p></div>
