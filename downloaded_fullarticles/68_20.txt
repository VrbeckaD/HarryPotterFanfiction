    <p>Hermione Granger approached the visitor entrance to the Ministry of Magic on a muggy Monday morning in late May with an iced coffee in one hand, a handbag at her elbow, and box of her personal effects tucked up under her other arm. She shifted slightly to squeeze through the door, placed her coffee on a small ledge, picked up the receiver and punched in the number. There was a brief pause in which Hermione though she might have entered the wrong digits but then the telephone rang and she was connected to a receptionist. After stating her business, a temporary badge was dispensed before the telephone box gave a worrisome little lurch at the start of its grinding decent. Hermione affixed the badge to her cream linen dress and rescued her coffee from its perch.  Normally she would have loo-flooed into the Atrium with the rest of the Ministry workers and headed up to The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures on Level Four; but as a newly minted Analyst for the Investigative Department within the Auror Office of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, – oof she would need to abbreviate that – Hermione was required to present her wand to the main security office to update her security clearances. </p>
<p>She was entering her sixth year with the Ministry. After the conclusion of the War in 1998, Hermione had returned to Hogwarts for an additional year of tutelage and then entered a yearlong internship at the Ministry. In the summer of 2000 she began her work on House Elf reform before moving on to a few other areas within the Magical Creatures Department. It was by total accident that she stumbled upon a creature smuggling ring and after coordinating with the DoMLE for the last six months on a variety of cases she was offered an Analyst position with the ID. Hermione was excited for the change. Law reform had its benefits but she honestly missed the research and investigative work she did with the boys back in their school days. Would she go back and fight a war again, no. But a little excitement never hurt anyone, right? </p>
<p>The security desk and visitor’s waiting area came into view and Hermione shifted the box more comfortably on her hip. Without warning the lift came to a halt, tilted irregularly, and ejected her into the mostly empty room. Hermione gave an indignant squeal and the contents of her box rattled loudly, threatening to spill out into the floor. She managed to right herself before landing face first and after huffing a curl out of her face she approached the desk. </p>
<p>“Mind the lift” the little old witch called out rather belatedly, not lifting her eyes from the papers in front of her.</p>
<p>Hermione tamped down her annoyance by clearing her throat and plastering on a smile. She looked at the woman’s badge and greeted her pleasantly, “Good morning, Muriel. I need to update my security clearance please.” </p>
<p>Muriel took a moment to quill in an answer on the crossword in her Dailey Prophet before waving the feather end towards a hallway to Hermione’s left, “Down the hall third door on the right, ‘Security Clearance’.” </p>
<p>Hermione’s need to be polite compelled her to speak, “Thank you, Muriel; happy Monday”. </p>
<p>When Muriel failed to respond Hermione turned and made her way down the hall.  She located the aforementioned third door on the right labeled ‘Security Clearance’ and walked through the open door. It was an unremarkable one room office with single pimple faced wizard who couldn’t be more than 19 sitting at a rather large desk for the space. </p>
<p>At Hermione’s appearance, he quickly removed his feet from his desk and sat up straight, “NaAH-“. His voice involuntarily pitched. He cleared his throat and tried again, “Name and wand please.”</p>
<p>Hermione hid a smirk by turning and placing her drink on the table and box on the guest chair by the door. She removed her wand from the hidden compartment in her hand bag and handed it over to the wizard, “Hermione Granger, upgrading from Level Four to Level Two.” She mentally noted that is nametag read Brian. </p>
<p>The young wizard took her wand and placed it in the identification machine which read out its make up in a prim female voice, “10 3/4 inches, vine wood, dragon heart string.” He compared the read out to a sheet of parchment he had pulled out of a stack, removed her wand from the identification machine and placed it in a secondary machine. The wizard then plundered through a drawer that looked like an odd assortment of ministry identification pins. After a few moments he pulled one out and retrieved her wand from the secondary machine. He nervously cleared his throat before speaking “Alright Miss Granger, you are all set. Your wand signature has been updated with your new clearance from Four to Two. And here is your department identification pin. Any other clearance materials will be assigned to you in your new department. I’ll take our temporary entrance badge; congratulations on your promotion.” </p>
<p>Hermione removed the temporary badge and placed it on his desk before taking her wand as well as her new pin, “Thank you so much, Brian. Have a pleasant Monday.” She affixed her new pin near the collar of her dress and placed her wand back into her purse. Box and coffee back in hand, she made her way back out to the reception area and then through to the Atrium of the Ministry. Queuing up for a lift, she checked her watch. Only 7:45 am, plenty of time to make her way up to Level Two. She waited for two groups ahead of her to go and was at the front of the line for the next lift when she heard her name being shouted from the floos. </p>
<p>“HERMIONE!” </p>
<p>She paused and turned to see Harry and Ron across the Atrium. Harry was politely parting the sea of ministry workers, “Pardon,” “Thank you ever so much” “Good Morning” and it didn’t taken them long to catch up to her. </p>
<p>Harry took the box out of her hands and ushered Hermione into the lift while Ron flashed his Auror credentials to the rest of the crowd, “So sorry folks, official Auror business, you’ll have to wait for the next lift.” There were disgruntled murmurs as Ron stepped into the lift as well, shut the gate and pressed the button for Level Two.</p>
<p>It was just like old time, “Was that strictly necessary?” She asked them seriously.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged.</p>
<p>Crossing his arms and leaning against the wall of the lift Ron smiled cheekily, “Oh come on now, ‘Mione. What’s the point of being high profile with a clearance when you can’t use it every so often?”</p>
<p>“Every so often? Is that so? And how many times have you used the ‘Auror business’ excuse to cut the lift lines?” </p>
<p>“Not THAT often; Aurors Honor” Ron replied and solemnly lifted his hand and made a cross motion over his heart.</p>
<p>Hermione snorted into her iced coffee, his humor was always infectious, “Oh come off it Ron, there is no such thing as an ‘Aurors Honor’.” </p>
<p>“Harry got free coffee at the Leaky this morning. You gonna bust his chops too?”</p>
<p>Hermione’s eyebrows shot up and she turned her attention to Harry, “Oh did he now?”</p>
<p>Harry made a face at Ron, “It’s not like I ASKED for free coffee. The new girl minding the bar refused to take my money. You’re just mad Susan wasn’t there so you could get YOUR free coffee.”</p>
<p>Her attention was now back squarely on Ron, “Susan? Susan who?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Ron used the edge of his light weight utility jacket to rub an imaginary spot off of his wand. </p>
<p>“Susan Bones” Harry supplied.</p>
<p>Hermione gasped in surprise, “YOU’VE BEEN GETTING FREE COFFEE FROM SUSAN BONES?!?”</p>
<p>Ron replaced his wand in its holster and rubbed the back of his neck, “… maybe?”</p>
<p>“How long has this been going on?”</p>
<p>“A few weeks” interjected Harry helpfully. <br/>
“A FEW WEEKS?!” Hermione smacked Ron on the shoulder, “And you didn’t think to tell me? You’ve had a crush on her for ages!” </p>
<p>Ron looked at her sheepishly and shrugged, “Didn’t want to jinx it.”</p>
<p>The lift came to a halt and Ron hastily opened the gate and exited. </p>
<p>Hermione followed, “Well I hope, for your sake, that it works out. If you want me to put in a good word, I’m happy to.” She turned towards Harry who now flanked her other side, “So, when are we going to set Gin on the new girl?”</p>
<p>“Ginny gets home from the first summer training session this Friday. Do we really need to though, I like going to the Leaky Cauldron.”</p>
<p>Ron gave a giggle, “We’ve not permanently been banned from anywhere, I’m sure it will be fine.”</p>
<p>Harry heaved a sigh and Hermione and Ron laughed as they passed by the Wizengamont Administrative Services as well as the Improper Use of Magic Office and entered the Auror Office. Though Hermione had visited multiple times over the years, Ron took the opportunity to give her the lay of the land.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the most important division of the DoMLE, The Auror Office.” The office itself was split into two sections with a medium size reception area between the two. The area on the left looked like a muggle police station, “this is, of course, where the main wizarding public comes to pay fines, make statements, etcetera.” He pointed to a hallway off where there were cells, “Those are our holding cells for your basic law breakers staying here on temporary accommodations.” He then pushed through another, “Through here is the bullpen for the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol, your basic lackeys.” </p>
<p>There was a cackle of drunken laughter from a holding cell and a good natured exclamation of protest from the few MLEs on duty. Harry rolled his eyes, “Come on hot-shot, let’s get moving!”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright!” Ron turned them back towards the reception area and pushed through double doors on the right that read ‘Authorized Personnel Only’. He rapped on the door with his knuckles as they went through, “that’s us!”</p>
<p>Hermione and Harry shared an eye roll.</p>
<p>Beyond those double doors was your basic office, though fairly modern considering the antiquated nature of the wizarding world, with an open floor plan. Ron paused at the door way, “These front desks here are for departmental admins.” He walked them through to the middle of the room, “The desks behind them are for Junior Aurors and the like.” Ron then motioned to a bank of offices on the left, “Over there are your Witch Watchers. This far back wall is for Sr. Aurors and Hit Wizards; that’s us” and he motioned to Harry and himself. “Robards’ office is in that back corner over there between the Watchers and us.” He then led Hermione over to the bank of offices on the right wall, “And this is where our Investigators are. And your office,” He directed them over to an office near the corner between the Investigators and the Hit Wizards, “is right here.” There was a name plate on the door that simply said ‘Investigative Analyst’.</p>
<p>Hermione walked in and Harry followed behind with her box and placed it on her empty desk. Ron made himself comfortable in her guest chair. She was pulling things out of her box and placing them around the room when there was a swell of noise from the main entrance. Hermione checked her watch, 8:05 am. The general bustle of a Monday morning continued until Robards exited his office and gathered everyone into the Auror Bullpen. </p>
<p>“Morning everyone! We had an excellent weekend. The Watchers were able to detain a serial shoplifter out of Wimbourne, a team of Junior Aurors handled security detail for the Minster without issue, and I received word just this morning that our A Team was able to retrieve the dark artifact from France and will be returning in a few days after they finish their debriefing there.” There was a general whoop of excitement and Robards had to settle the crowd, “Yes, yes, you can all celebrate later. Lastly, I’d like to introduce our newest addition, Miss Hermione Granger. Granger here inadvertently came across a creature smuggling ring and due to her sharp eyes she was able to work with us for the past six month to get the perpetrators. We’ve brought her on to review cases and see if she can noodle out any other connections or oddities. She’ll be working on higher profile cases for now but as her workload evens out she’ll be taking on more cases.” </p>
<p>Robards closed the meeting and Hermione was greeted by numerous members of the department before she was led back to her office by the department head. He had a stack of folders with him and they were placed on her desk after they entered her office. He also placed a DoMLE badge on top of the stack “Here is your credential in the event that you need to do any field work. Well get you set up with some basic training as well. These should keep you busy in the mean time, Granger. When you are done with them let me know, there are plenty where those came from.” He tapped a finger on the files and exited her office, gathering the senior Aurors and Hit Wizards on his way back to his own office for a secondary meeting. </p>
<p>Hermione put the files aside and finished unpacking her box. Her potted iris went on the bookshelf, along with a few pictures of her family and friends. A custom name plate found its home on her desk along with her quill kit and wax seal. Once everything was in its place she turned her attention to the stack of cases, fished out a pair of reading glasses from her purse and began perusing. The boys poked their heads in around lunch time and persuaded her to eat with them in the ministry cafeteria. She made a note to put an alarm in her day to remind herself of lunch and quitting time. It wouldn’t do to get too absorbed in her work so early. </p>
<p>The trio sat down at a small table with their selected lunches. “So, ‘Mione, find anything interesting yet?” Ron asked around a mouthful of sandwich.</p>
<p>Hermione stabbed a piece of lettuce out of her salad and poked it in Ron’s direction, “Does Susan know you talk with your mouth full?” </p>
<p>Ron swallowed thickly, “I’m always on my best behavior around her, thank you very much.” </p>
<p>“Is that so?” Hermione countered and ate her bite of salad, swallowing before she continued, “And how long do you think you will be able to keep that up before she catches on?” </p>
<p>A snigger from Harry and a scowl from Ron was all the answer she got. </p>
<p>“You’ve not been out with us in ages, Hermione.” Harry came to Ron’s rescue, “We’re getting the whole team together later this week to celebrate the win in France. Come see for yourself then.” </p>
<p>“Pubs are not my thing.” Hermione said flatly.</p>
<p>“Maybe not for your last department, but you’re a DoMLE now, besides, everyone will expect you to be there.” Ron cajoled. </p>
<p>Hermione took another bite of her lunch and considered the options. Would going to a pub with a few old friends really be that bad? Maybe not, and it HAD been a while since she enjoyed some time away from the office and her own flat. </p>
<p>“Ok, fine, I’ll go but I’m not getting pissed. Just a drink or two and then home for me.”</p>
<p>Neither boy replied but she had to duck out of the way of their high five. </p>
<p>-Boys-</p>
<p>Lunch was quickly over and Hermione headed back up to Level Two while Harry and Ron went out on department business. She set an alarm to remind her of the end of the day and her afternoon was filled with reading reports. When she came across something that piqued her interest she would jot it down on a spare piece of parchment. By the time her alarm sounded indicating the end of the day, she had neat little rows of parchment notes plastered to her wall with a sticking charm. Nothing remarkable yet but little things: artifact types, regions, clusters of dates, etc. She marked her place in the folder and tidied the stack on her desk preparing to go. She took one last look at her stickied notes, grabbed her purse and left for the day.</p>
<p>Hermione was able to exit the Ministry as she normally would, through the floos, into the Whitehall loos, and then walking to her apartment in Aria House just a few streets over. Though the Grangers lacked the substantial historic wealth of the oldest wizarding families, Hermione was not destitute. Both her parents came from upper middle class families, well situated and educated. Their dental practice had flourished for years and despite the year long… vacation… they took to Australia, the Trust they set up for Hermione had been undisturbed. So at 21, just a few months into her position with the Department of Magical Creatures, she found herself with a considerable nest egg, a brand new flat near the Ministry, and two doting parents keen on rebuilding their relationship with their daughter.  </p>
<p>She loved her apartment; it was clean, bright, and provided all the cultural stimuli she could ask for. Not only was the apartment near The National Gallery, but the building also housed the Playhouse Theater and was just a short walk from both the White Hall and Victoria Embankment Gardens. Despite the hubbub of the city around her, the apartment was quiet, thank you magic, and tranquil. Hermione let herself into her flat, dropped her bag and keys by the door, slipped off her nude colored pumps, made her way into the bedroom to change, and proceeded to enjoy a relaxing evening at home.</p>
<p>~ * ~<br/>
Her second day was much like her first; filled with reading and note taking. The bustle of the department didn’t bother her; she was mostly able to tune the noise out. Her other coworkers were kind and she found herself fitting in well, despite it being a male heavy department. By the end of day two she had met nearly everyone and could easily place their desks or offices. The only people she hadn’t met were the “A Team”, as Robards had put it, and she assumed that they must have occupied the two offices cattycorner to her own as they had remained dark in her time in the office. She had meant to ask Harry and Ron who they were but had been unable to pin them down after their lunch on Monday.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Wednesday that she came across something of true interest in her work; there had been a few reports from various Aurors about jewelry with blue stones. Some had gone missing, others had been found, some had been reported as dark, even the types of jewelry were different; there was nothing similar about the cases other than the blue stones. Hermione found herself chatting with one of the Junior Aurors about his report when there was a well of excitement that bubbled up in the room. Hermione looked up to see a crowed of workers had formed near the doors.</p>
<p>“Hey there ‘A Team’” Hermione noted a tinge of teasing sarcasm in the greeting. </p>
<p>“Milked that Paris trip long enough?”</p>
<p>“Looking a little tan there, how many days did you spend on the beach?”</p>
<p>“Next time take me, eh?”</p>
<p>“A MONTH long assignment, I think that’s a record!”</p>
<p>“Welcome back to the real world”</p>
<p>“Got a pile of paperwork with your names on it”</p>
<p>There were laughs and slaps on the back and finally the crowed cleared to reveal none other than Neville Longbottom and – Draco Malfoy?</p>
<p>Neville and DRACO were the ‘A Team’? Hermione didn’t even know that Draco worked for the DoMLE. All three of them had returned with a handful of others to finish their schooling at Hogwarts, they had even interned at the Ministry at the same time, Hermione choosing to sample of a variety of programs, Neville had gone directly into the DoMLE, but she had lost track of Draco. Their paths crossed some when she was doing law reform and his house had held a seat so she assumed he worked with the Wizengamot. She hadn’t seen or heard of him in the last six months she had been liaising with the DoMLE.</p>
<p>It was like Draco could tell she was thinking about him because his focus shifted from the Watcher he was talking to and started scanning the room. Hermione quickly averted her gaze and tried to continue her conversation with the Junior Auror about the blue gems. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end and her heart gave an involuntary thud. </p>
<p>What on earth?</p>
<p>She cleared her throat and she took a surreptitious glace out of the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>Draco had ended his conversation and was now standing casually in the center of the room with a thoughtful look aimed right at her. </p>
<p>Hermione tried again to divert her attention back to the jewelry but tripped over her words in a fluster. Her gaze kept shifting back to Draco. </p>
<p>The Junior Auror looked up at her, “Are you ok Granger?”</p>
<p>“Uhm…” Was her inelegant reply.</p>
<p>Draco’s thoughtful look had morphed into a slow lazy smile and he meandered towards the Junior Auror and Hermione.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Malfoy.” The Junior Auror said when he realized Draco was joining them. </p>
<p> Draco glanced at the Junior Auror briefly, “Thanks Harris, it’s good to be back” and then turned his attention back to Hermione fully with a simple, “Hey, Granger.” </p>
