<p>“Potter,” Voldemort said smoothly. Then he seemed to think better of it. “… Harry,” he murmured, scarlet eyes flickering all over Harry’s face, as if trying to memorize it for a future piece of art. The brows furrowed slightly as his eyes lingered on the scar, and - Harry was still trying to get used to the sight of a Voldemort with a nose, and hair, and scale-less skin that looked like it really had blood flowing under it, because this was new. It was terribly new.</p>
<p>“Tom,” he bit back, trying to be insolent. Strangely, he was almost hoping for a <em>Crucio</em>, as if everything would start making sense again if he could only remind Voldemort why he so desperately wanted Harry dead.</p>
<p>But even though the muscles in Voldemort’s cheeks tightened, and his hand twitched for his wand, he didn’t finish the motion. Instead, his new lips curled into the graceless mockery of an indulgent smile. “Ah yes, I did forget how excellent a job you have done of stalking me. I must say, Harry, a man could get the wrong idea.”</p>
<p>What the fuck? Harry thought, and pressed himself back against the chair. He reached desperately for his magic, as if that might unstick him and his bindings from the chair somehow. (It should be able to, he thought stubbornly, it’s magic!)</p>
<p>“I would call it premeditation more than stalking,” he said.</p>
<p>“Would you?” Voldemort asked. He turned from Harry, returning to the desk on the other side of the room. “While perhaps it would be fascinating to pick your brain a bit more, Harry, I’m afraid our time together has… come to an end, shall we say.”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes darted around the room once more. Still only the bookshelves, the green-curtained windows, the desk, the chair he was tied and sticking-charmed to. There was nobody else in sight, but it also wasn’t as if he could dodge an <em>Avada</em> while affixed to a chair. Maybe once, he allowed himself to think. He could rock the chair enough to dive to the floor, perhaps, if he really threw himself into it. But then the chair would be really difficult to move, and he would still be stuck to it. And then -</p>
<p>Voldemort had been silent, staring out the window with his hands folded behind his back. Harry couldn’t see the yew wand, nor the stolen elder wand from Dumbledore - but he couldn’t know how close either of those two wands were to hand for Voldemort. He couldn’t be complacent.</p>
<p>“What’s the wait?” he tried instead, hoping he could just get Voldemort to slip again. “Afraid I’ll magically vanish or something? Afraid you’ll look stupid if you use an Unforgiveable on a tied-up 18 year old?”</p>
<p>“I almost think I may miss you,” Voldemort said instead, in a non sequitor sort of way. He didn’t turn at all. “You should be honored, Harry. Lord Voldemort does not so easily give out his regards.”</p>
<p>“If that’s honor, then I’d rather not be honored, thanks."</p>
<p>Voldemort made a <em>tsk</em> noise, and turned, but towards the desk. A drawer slid open, obscured from Harry’s view, and Voldemort’s thin fingers plucked something from within. Whatever it was, the Dark Lord proceeded to hold it in his palm, staring at it with an almost glazed look in his eyes. Then he sighed, cupped the item in both hands, and turned back to Harry. His red gaze was pensive. Despite the lack of rage within the man standing on the other end of the room, Harry felt a weight of panic almost as strong as what he had felt in the graveyard when he was 14.</p>
<p>“I have,” Voldemort proclaimed grandly, spreading his arms, “recently had the pleasure of tearing apart the mind of Severus Snape, Harry. Would you like to know what I have learned?”</p>
<p>Harry’s insides lurched at the thought of anyone - even a traitor like Snape - having their mind literally torn apart by the man in front of him. “I really don’t,” he manageed to get out, despite the sickness in his stomach.</p>
<p>“No?” Voldemort only smiled, as if he found Harry amusing. “Very well, then. My next point, Harry, would be: do you recall your very first potions class?”</p>
<p>“Uh?” Harry said, caught off guard by the inquiry. “Er - what? I guess? Why?”</p>
<p>“Three questions,” Voldemort continued, beginning to pace across the carpet. He was not aiming directly for Harry, but he was approaching closer than Harry would like, especially given the topic of this conversation. He felt the hair on the back of his neck prickling uncomfortably. “Three questions which you failed to answer - not that I can truly blame you, given the content.”</p>
<p>That confused Harry, in a temporary refuge from anxiety - had Voldemort just… absolved him?</p>
<p>“I don’t see how this is any of your business,” he said instead, and tugged uselessly on the ropes again.</p>
<p>“All that you are is my business, Harry Potter,” Voldemort said slowly. “The devil is in the details. Do you perhaps recall the answers to those questions? I suppose,” he corrected himself, pacing closer still, “that only the first question is useful here. There is your hint.”</p>
<p>“This is a weird interrogation,” Harry pointed out. He didn’t know what game Voldemort was trying to play, but he would rather just abstain.</p>
<p>“Trust me, Harry, you would know if this were an interrogation.” Voldemort was finally back in front of him, and the man leaned in until their foreheads were almost touching. Harry wished he could move away - he didn’t want to be anywhere near this man, nevermind the pain in his scar, which oddly hadn’t pained him much at all since he was captured. But that was only a minor detail - Harry would get back to it later. Instead he clenched his jaw and stared at Voldemort as defiantly as he could muster.</p>
<p>After a few long moments, Voldemort stepped back, and Harry breathed again.</p>
<p>“I suppose, if I cannot coax you to cooperate in any meaningful, consenting way, then we may as well get this over with,” Voldemort told him. Harry opened his mouth to try to distract the man again with something else, but the breath to do so withered in his throat as Voldemort’s hands fell open and revealed a one-dose vial of a deep black potion. So that explains the potions references, Harry thought wildly - but what potion was that, anyway?</p>
<p>That first day in potions class floated to the front of his mind, despite his determination not to play.</p>
<p>
  <em>Powdered root of asphodel… infusion of wormwood… sleeping potion so powerful that it is known as -</em>
</p>
<p>Harry choked. “That’s - !”</p>
<p>“Ah, you do know,” Voldemort said, smiling in a sickening parody of pleasantness as one hand twisted the cork out of the vial. It emerged with a squelching noise. “Say ah, Harry.”</p>
<p>“I’m not taking that!” Harry yelled. He tried to scoot the chair back along the floor, but found that he could not gain enough traction. He had not felt such panic since - he couldn’t even place a time when he had felt more desperate. What did it say about him, that he had been fine with the possibility of death, but now presented with a fate which was not death, he felt such bone-deep urgency? The prospect of dying in this chair was far less intimidating than the prospect of letting Voldemort get that potion into his body - of sleeping so deeply that he appeared to be dead, and perhaps would never be allowed to wake up.</p>
<p>“You will find,” Voldemort said lowly, “that you will take it, Harry, whether you wish to or not. But you may choose to get it over with somewhat comfortably, or you may choose to - struggle.”</p>
<p>Harry could not tell if Voldemort cared which option he chose, but Harry certainly cared. Never, he went to say - before he saw that Voldemort had withdrawn his yew wand from some hidden pocket in his robes while Harry was panicking over the initial realization. He knew then that the man could probably charm his mouth to stay open if he opened it at all, even if it were just to speak. Harry pressed his lips together and said nothing.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord sighed, and waved his wand idly at Harry’s torso. More ropes sprang into existance, tightening almost unbearably until Harry couldn’t move his chest or shoulders at all. He could only turn his head - and pressed against the back of the chair as it was, he couldn’t even tilt it back very much. Then Voldemort had him by the neck, and Harry was torn between wondering why the skin-to-skin contact did not burn, and trying to twitch away from the man’s grasp. He chose to try to get away - Voldemort’s fingers tightened painfully on his jaw, nails digging slightly into his skin.</p>
<p>“Harry,” Voldemort nearly crooned. He leaned in again, until their foreheads were truly touching - Harry screwed his eyes shut and tried desperately to focus only on what he needed to focus on to ensure he could both breathe, and keep all trace of that potion out of his system.</p>
<p><em>“Harry,”</em> Voldemort hissed. <em>“I know that you can understand me, Harry. Open your mouth.”</em></p>
<p>Harry twitched his head as best he could in the direction of a ‘no’, and Voldemort made quite the put-upon noise.</p>
<p>“If you’re certain,” the man said in English.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a terrific pressure on Harry’s jaws, just beneath his ears. While the pain wasn’t on the same level as a cruciatus, it was still a sort of pain that Harry had never felt before in his life. The unfamiliarity of it all forced his jaw to drop open as he instinctively tried to relieve some of the pressure. It worked - but then the smooth glass lip of a vial was shoved into his mouth. He tasted bitter, viscous herbs on his tongue, and went to try and spit it out. But the wood behind his skull vanished - Voldemort forced Harry’s head to tip back, and once again taken by surprise, Harry swallowed some of the potion - and then kept swallowing, quite against his will. His throat muscles were moving on their own. He desperately didn’t want them to be - he was telling them not to.</p>
<p>Harry dazedly felt the vial being tugged away from his lips, and a hand releasing his hair. His head hurt - there was a strange pressure on his throat. It vanished when Voldemort waved his wand, and Harry knew immediately what must have happened.</p>
<p>“You fuck,” he bit out, somewhat shocked by his own language. “You used - you forced - ”</p>
<p>“The magical means for forcing somebody to swallow are rather more pleasant than the muggle means,” Voldemort said. He tossed the vial to the side - Harry heard it clatter to the floor with a sound far more distant than it should have been. His vision was blurring, and he was finding it difficult to tense his muscles at all.</p>
<p>No, he thought. No, no, no -</p>
<p>“Why?” he managed to force from his lungs. Are you doing this, he wanted to continue, but the fine muscle control needed to make words just wasn’t coming to him. He wanted to sleep so badly. He was so tired, and he was starting to feel quite warm. It was a nice change from all the anxiety of the war, and being captured, and he…</p>
<p>No! Harry tried to wrench himself back to awareness, but only managed to sit up a little straighter for a moment. His vision had black around the edges, and with another breath, his head lolled.</p>
<p>Ironically, impossibly, Voldemort was slowly stroking Harry’s hair and hissing something into his ear in a parselmouth croon. Harry could not bother to focus on the words - something about lying untouched. He didn’t like any of it. There were weights upon his eyelids - he fought to keep them open, of course, but with every passing second their fluttering increased. Harry didn’t want to close his eyes. He didn’t want to go to sleep. If he went to sleep he’d never see anyone again - there would be no way Voldemort would let him awaken, if this was what he wanted, Harry’s living but insensate body instead of Harry’s dead corpse.</p>
<p>He was out of the chair, and being carried in somebody’s arms. Voldemort? Probably, Harry thought viciously, and he wished he could lash out with his now-free hands, that the muscles wanted to do anything but dangle limply. Maybe if he hit hard enough, at the right angle, he could even force that perfect new nose to break… Wouldn’t that be a good fuck-you right in Voldemort’s face, for real, ha ha.</p>
<p><em>“no,”</em> Harry managed to slur out in Parseltongue as his eyes finally fell closed, and he could not force them back open. To his horror, they were burning at the corners. <em>“no,”</em> he hissed again. <em>“st’p…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hush, Harry,”</em> came Voldemort’s soothing voice. <em>“I shall take… <u>such</u> good care of you.”</em></p>
<p>Harry felt a sting of distant horror in his stomach, before even that receded. The arms around him, the last part of the world that he could feel with any certainty, slipped away into the blackness.</p>
