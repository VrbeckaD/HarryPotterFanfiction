    <p>The first time I tried it it was with all muggle ingredients, and it was a low buzz at best.</p>
<p><br/>I had snuck out of my aunt and uncles with the full intention of never seeing them again, and my first night on the streets I had gone to a party and was introduced to the 'craze' of America at the moment- Sizzurp. Lean.</p>
<p>Coke, Candy, and Cough Syrup.</p>
<p><br/>It was an odd mixture, and while I expected it to taste much like a potion would, it was actually overly sweet. The muggles swore it worked, but it was barely a tingling under my skin compared to their blissed-out, vacant look. I figured that it was my magic stopping me from really feeling it, and I had something else to blame on it. I went back to the alcohol they were offering and thought nothing of it.</p>
<p><br/>But when I found an apartment to rent and settled in, I was curious. I brewed a coughing solution, which had much the same 'medicines' in it as the syrup muggles use though they are extracted from different plants and mixed in a different way. I popped a cinnamon hard candy in the bottom, poured a can of coke in and threw it back. I was a bit disappointed at first, feeling even less than before. I ended up throwing the large cup away and settling on the couch before it really hit me.</p>
<p><br/>I didn't come down for what felt like days. when I finally got around to looking it had been only hours, but while it was coursing through me I was so at peace- my mind wasn't running at the speed of light, I wasn't depressed or thinking of the people who had died earlier in the year or my aunt and uncle or hell, even my name. I could barely string a coherent thought together, let alone analyze every little thing.</p>
<p><br/>I quickly got to the point where I could function through the euphoric haze without it seeming like I was as high as I felt. the phrase 'fake it til you make it' had a whole new meaning when I got a job at a local grocery store for the rest of the summer. I knew I wasn't going to be picked up earlier than necessary this time, and why would I be? I caused all their problems, who would want me around?</p>
<p><br/>I got my supplies in Diagon, by myself. I took a cab one day on a whim and went through. I got all of my things and the few things that caught my eye. It was strange to see the streets, flocked with people when I was in the state I kept myself in. I wasn't scared of them anymore. If anything, they seemed to be scared of me if the looks I was getting was any indication. that, of course, should have been my first warning, but I didn't notice. I got everything, went back to muggle London and when it was time to board the train, I was early enough to get my own compartment away from others, armed with my anger at being forced back here and my thermos of my own version of liquid courage.</p>
