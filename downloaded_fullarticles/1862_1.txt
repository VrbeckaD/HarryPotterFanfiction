    <strong>Chapter 1 - The Enforcers:</strong>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="justify">At the moment as Dumbledore wanted to gift Gryffindor with the House-Cup after illegally granted them 160 points, a commotion ripped through the Great Hall.</p>
<p align="justify">The great doors swung open and two people entered, a man and a woman in their 40s. Both looked stoically and unforgiving in Dumbledore's direction.</p>
<p align="justify">„Stop it at once, old man.", growled Janus Fever. "You have really overstepped your boundaries once and for all.", agreed his partner Belladonna Atropin.</p>
<p align="justify">"What are you doing here?", croaked Dumbledore, fear coated his throat. He know exactly what those both are capable of and it wouldn't end pretty.</p>
<p align="justify">"You are a farce, old man. Not even senility excuses your action. But enough is enough."</p>
<p align="justify">"And we will not stand for it. You do not lord over everyone and we are here to enforce that justice will be followed. "</p>
<p align="justify">"I... I"</p>
<p align="justify">"You were really willing to illegally grant Gryffindor an unjustified victory. For what, that Harry Potter is one of them."</p>
<p align="justify">"That's not true?"</p>
<p align="justify">"Really, do not joke, old coot."</p>
<p align="justify">"The third floor corridor was forbidden for everyone, wasn't that your words at the welcoming feast. And now you want to award points for it, why?"</p>
<p align="justify">"Er, because of the successful fight against Professor Quirrell."</p>
<p align="justify">"Not good enough, if that's the reason, why do you not already awarded the points?"</p>
<p align="justify">"..."</p>
<p align="justify">"Nothing to say, old man. You're really are disgusting."</p><hr/>
<p align="justify">"Why are you here.", asked Minerva McGonnagall frowning.</p>
<p align="justify">"To bring him to justice. The council will deal with him for a variety of crimes."</p>
<p align="justify">"But Dumbledore."</p>
<p align="justify">"Are you so blind, or deaf, that you ignore everything that he does, Minerva.", commented Janus nonchalant. "I can always listed the endangerment of Hogsmeade and Hogwarts through the moon-night-romps of your precious Marauders. They showed lesser intelligence than a dead flobberworm and I warn you a last time, I do not suffer fools gladly."</p>
<p align="justify">"Latest points of crimes: Endangering students by bringing the Philiosopher stone to Hogwarts. Hiding a dark object – the Mirror of Erised – in the vicinity of students without any kind of safety measures. At least two first-years were drawn to it for days.", recited Belladonna by heart.</p>
<p align="justify">"Harry Potter will be taken into our custody and a thorough diagnostic charme will be performed on him. And Merlin grant you mercy, if we find only one thing amiss in his health, than you can be sure that you will know first hand what a living nightmare in hell contented of.", growls Janus Fever.</p>
<p align="justify">"You can't do that."</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh, we can. Not enough, did you know Minerva, that he could have end the war with Voldemort years ago? He knows about the safety measures of the dark lord. About his Horcruxes. But he was willing to do nothing and buys his time."</p><hr/>
<p align="justify">"And you look the other way, when abused students ask for help. We know exactly who spoke the<strong><em> Fidelius</em></strong> on the house in Godric's Hallow, old man. Give up, you got no chance with us. We're not one of your sheeple. Be glad, if you're not handed over to the goblins."</p>
<p align="justify">"What, why?"</p>
<p align="justify">"We have been granted the right to have a full audit on Hogwarts. If only one galleon is misplaced after you started as headmaster, you'll face Goblin laws."</p>
<p align="justify">"Ah, not to forget Sirius Black. After searching for it, and not finding a single note of his trial, a re-trial will be scheduled and Veritaserum will be administered to the accused next week, as well as a closer look at his memories in a pensieve. Should he be innocent than he will be admitted for a year to St. Mungos with intense mind-healing sessions. Afterwards it will be checked, if he is capable of taking in his godson. The wills of James and Lily Potter will be unsealed and will be looked closely into them."</p>
<p align="justify">"No."</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh yes, did you know Belladonna that Lily Potter explicitly announced that her son should never be send to her horse-faced sister."</p>
<p align="justify">"Interesting Janus, why did they amiss something from such huge relevance, or was it to cover embezzlement of the funds. The magical guardian do have the right to dip into the fund of his wards." Dumbledore gone whiter within seconds.</p>
<p align="justify">"Before I forget it, Severus, the goblins have said, you should come over for an inheritance test and the acceptance of your Lordship."</p>
<p align="justify">"Right, they said you're the rightful Lord Prince and some other Lordships have to be tested as well.", added Belladonna smirking.</p>
<p align="justify">"True, and we do need your special talents. Erebos was very angry after learning that his wife was killed during a murder attempt and the loss of his youngest son, Liir Ores, leave him more than a bit unhinged."</p>
<p align="justify">"Why do you need me?"</p>
<p align="justify">"You're one of a few men who can calm him down."</p>
<p align="justify">"All right, I'll help you."</p>
<p align="justify">"Good to know."</p><hr/>
<p align="justify">Before Dumbledore could react had Belladonna Atropin him petrified and used the magical supressor cuffs on him without a single glance to anyone else in the Great Hall. Her partner smirked and waited till she roughly dragged the old coot on his feet and away from the table. "Oye, Bella", Janus cried and throw a galleon into her direction. She catches it fast and never lose the hold on Dumbledore.</p>
<p align="justify">"We see you later, after I deliver this scum to his holding cell."</p>
<p align="justify">"Sure, Bella. I have only get some clarification to open questions, escort Potter to the safe house and maybe afterwards drag Severus around."</p>
<p align="justify">"Behave, Janus."</p>
<p align="justify">"Don't I always?", smirked he.</p>
<p align="justify">"You know the answer to that question, Janus."</p>
<p align="justify">"Yes, I do.."</p>
<p align="justify">He looked to Harry and told him: "Mr. Potter, after the leaving feast I will accompany you to your dorm, where you pack your things, and escort you to a safe house, where you will be staying, until the situation will be cleared up. But I can you ensure about one point, you will never be send back to those hideous muggles ever again."</p>
<p align="justify">Harry nodded stunned and stand up to go to the strange man. He doesn't know what do expect for his future, but at least he will never be forced back into his cupboard under the stairs. Hope began to flatter into his heart, maybe he can live with someone who will see just-Harry and not the Boy-who-lived.</p>
