    <p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I received your invitation” said a man blandly with no note of appreciation or happiness colouring his voice. And because hood was obscuring his features Tom couldn’t gleam much more from his expression. Only a shade of unnaturally bright eyes a tell-tale of night creatures, was standing out. “I hope it still stands?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, of course” confirmed Tom and opened the door to his flat wide just enough to let stranger in. “Would you like a cup of tea while we discuss some terms?” he offered graciously and led his guest to cluttered lounge. It was declined to his relief.</p><p align="justify">Tom was a tidy man and mindful how he was presenting himself  but his surroundings tended to fall into ruin sooner or later, left uncared for and untended. He never owned much more than was strictly necessary so when so much later in life he found himself in possession of an entire apartment, much of that was in effect left forgotten. Unnecessary.</p><p align="justify">His guest with no shame spelled one of the armchairs clean and dust free, levitating discarded clothing and papers to the side. Only then he graced Tom with words “I hope you don’t mind.”</p><p align="justify">“I am much more concerned how a vampire came into possession of a wand what is if I remember correctly strictly forbidden by British law” said Tom slowly, measuring every word. “I would also like to see your face. Give me some idea whom I am dealing with,” he demanded. His own hand hidden deep in his robe’s pocket was clenched on his wand. Long finger was caressing the yew wood in a gesture acquired many years ago. There was something calming in feeling the structure, small defects of his most treasured possession, his weapon under his fingers.</p><p align="justify">“I will. It’s unavoidable. But first… What does great Lord Voldemort requires in exchange for his services?” asked the stranger mockingly and Tom felt burning of his cheeks in response because the name he decided to use in his reply was meant to inspire respect, not mockery.</p><p align="justify">He squashed that feeling mercilessly. “Pray tell, what sort of sustenance do you require?”</p><p align="justify">“To be honest with you, I will take any. It’s a matter of what you prefer” The man smiled showing teeth – completely innocuous human teeth. “Nice, isn’t it, to choose how you will be abused?”</p><p align="justify">Voldemort allowed himself a small smile. “It’s good you think that. What I require of you will even out our suffering. I do research work and I need an alive subject infected with vampirism.”</p><p align="justify">“You want me to be your test subject?” asked the man. He almost managed to hid disgust from his voice. “Your lab rat?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, exactly. I am so glad you understand.” Tom nodded, satisfied smile playing on his lips.</p><p align="justify">“What sort of research…? What sort of test..?”</p><p align="justify">Tom couldn’t just tell him though. He needed to know first. “Lower your hood and I will tell you” he demanded and only when his guest complied revealing a mop of unruly dark hair, a pair of heavy glasses sitting on his nose and disgusting jagged scar marring his entire neck looking as if someone tried to behead him in the past, Tom cared to explain. “I have an interest in finding a method to control a vampire disease. I would find a way to ease your kin of all symptoms and all powers that come with being infected.”</p><p align="justify">“Most curious how you expect me to agree to help you create something that you could use against me” said man coldly.</p><p align="justify">“Most curious for sure” agreed Tom easily “like most experiments that I deem to do myself. And most useful don’t you think? How many of yours would like to go back to their old life, to pretend nothing ever happened to change their lives?” he persuaded.</p><p align="justify">His words prompted a look of dark humour instead. “Are you serious to call this a live?” asked a vampire with something dangerously close to laughter in his voice.</p><p align="justify">“There is nothing that quite fits,” allowed Tom “but it’s not what really matters, is it?” He raised an eyebrow questioningly. “It’s my blood that you tasted. I left you with a vial attached to my letter to give you an idea what kind of sustenance I can give you. Did you taste me?” he asked and it sounded almost perverted. To taste him, to eat him, to feast upon him.</p><p align="justify">“Yes” answered the vampire with hungry reddish glint in his eyes. “How… unwise of you to offer a stranger a vial of your blood. To offer it to me! While I drank it to the last drop, there are actions that I could take that would be most harmful to you.”</p><p align="justify">He paved over these concerns without a blink. “And did you like me? Is it why you decided to take my offer?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, yes, great lord. You are sure to think it’s a matter of preference? Maybe you delude yourself that something in your blood called to me more loudly than any other. But I have to tell you that blood of any wizard is good enough. And you were only wizard that offered. I certainly see why, now.”</p><p align="justify">“So unpleasant,” sighed Tom. “And I merely hoped that this sample could convince you how rewarding can be our partnership.”</p><p align="justify">“How often?” demanded to know a vampire.</p><p align="justify">Tom allowed himself a moment to decide, tapping his fingers against stained, dusty coffee table. “Maybe once a few weeks. There is much research, much brewing and preparing in-between.”</p><p align="justify">“And I will visit you every time a need strikes me.”</p><p align="justify">“I can allow you to take only so much so it’s not detrimental to my health, so I can work,” Tom objected.</p><p align="justify">An amused grimace twisted vampire lips into something entirely dissimilar to a smile. “Don’t be stupid,” he said “there is nothing healthy about feeding a vampire. You will become a tired shadow of yourself after just a few times and I can merely promise to stop, before I intentionally kill you.”</p><p align="justify">Something sank in his stomach, but his face remained stony. Death. His greatest terror, his last enemy to be obliterated.</p><p align="justify">“I agree” he breathed out, barely forcing words through his stiff, cold lips.</p><p align="justify">“Wonderful,” said the man and stood up to grasp Tom’s hand “a pleasure doing business with you. As a wizard I was called Harry Potter. You can still call me that.” He smiled pleasantly pulling Tom up so there were standing face to face. “So, Lord Voldemort, how can I feed from you today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p>
