    <p>Ever since he’d returned, he’d watched her. The way she tucked her hair behind her ear or chewed on her lip. It was the little things that had always fascinated him, and he found that now, after everything, it was the little things that drew him in. Made it impossible for him to look away. At times like these, his resentment far outweighed his fascination. As he ran his grey eyes over her form, his teeth clenched together so hard he was sure to crack one, she raised up on her toes and kissed the cheek of the absolute idiot grinning down at her, looking for all the world as though he’d won the bloody lottery.</p><p>Which he had, of course.</p><p>Hermione Granger was the golden girl of the Golden Trio. Any git with half a brain knew she was a prize worth pursuing, which was why he couldn’t really blame the lumbering fool with the shit eating grin on his face as he grabbed a handful of Gryffindor arse.</p><p>Draco let out a low growl as he forced himself to focus on the parchment in front of him and ignore the stomach churning display of public affection currently taking place in his peripheral vision. It was bad enough that she’d started seeing Cormac McLaggen, the absolute tosser, but snogging him in public, in full view of <em>his</em> desk seemed downright cruel.</p><p>When his quill snapped, sending a spray of ink all over his robes, he decided he’d had enough. Standing abruptly, his chair squeaking in protest at the sudden movement, he grabbed his cloak and stomped past the happy couple, unable to stop himself from sneering at the brunette as he passed. His grey eyes made brief contact with her brown ones and for a moment he thought he saw a flash of sadness, but she broke their gaze before he could determine whether it was real or imagined.</p><p>Not as though it mattered. It had been her choice to move on and now they both bloody well had to live with it.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Nine months earlier:</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You can’t just swoop in here, Granger, with your swotty ideas and indecent skirts and take over my</em>
  <em>—</em>
  <em>“ he swept his arm dramatically around the demolished cottage as he contemplated the chaos</em>
  <em>—</em>
  <em> “my potion explosion.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She glared at him and brushed her hands self-consciously over her “indecent” skirt before sweeping past him with a toss of her hair. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“My skirts have absolutely nothing to do with this investigation, Malfoy.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He snorted and rolled his eyes as she bent at the waist and reached across the mess of destruction that remained of the potioneer’s workbench to poke at a bit of the shattered cauldron with her wand. Her skirts were absolutely relevant to the investigation, especially when they framed her arse so splendidly, completely distracting him. If someone had told him he’d be ogling the uptight Gryffindor on a regular basis six years ago he’d have hexed them half-way to Sunday.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“This looks odd.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco walled off his less than professional thoughts about his obnoxious co-worker and wiped his face clean of any expression before sauntering across the room to peer over her shoulder. Ignoring the slight hitch in her breath as he reached around her to pluck the object she was holding from her hand, he focused his attention on the scrap that had caught her eye.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“This appears to be nothing more than a piece of parchment, Granger.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She turned to face him, and in an admittedly immature display, he refused to step back to give her room. When she reached for the scrap, he raised his arm above his head, putting the clue out of her reach while he smirked down at her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Brown eyes shot daggers at him as she ceased her efforts to grab at the scrap.</em>
</p><p><em>“If you would actually </em>read<em> what’s on the parchment, you prat, you might understand why I find it odd.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“Tsk, tsk. That’s no way to speak with your co-workers.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She crossed her arms over her chest and cocked a hip out before tossing her hair over her shoulder, in a way that was very much specific to Hermione Granger. His smirk grew.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Draco Malfoy, stop behaving as though you’re an idiot. I know you have a brain in there. Please elect to use it.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Good lord, Granger, are you ill? Did you just accuse me of having a brain?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She rolled her eyes and leapt up, ripping the parchment out of his hand while clumsily elbowing him in the ribs on her way down.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Bloody hell, witch, watch the elbows.” She ignored him, instead electing to push the parchment scrap into his vision.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Look at what this says, Malfoy.”</em>
</p><p><em>Draco sneered at her while he rubbed his ribs</em><em>—</em><em> the woman was </em>boney—<em> and read the scrawled writing on the scrap of paper. </em></p><p>
  <em>“ -lohov li-.” Quirking an eyebrow, he looked at her as if she’d lost her mind. “Brilliant. Absolutely amazing, Granger. You’ve cracked the case through the discovery of gibberish.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And annoyed sigh fluttered the bottom of the parchment.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Dolohov lives, Malfoy. Don’t be dense.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Possibly.” He conceded before pursing his lips in mock thought. “Or Dolohov lies. Or Dolohov likes little boys. Or Dolohov literally never knew when to shut up.” He pushed her hand away and stepped around her, returning his attention to the rubble. “All true statements, by the way.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“How vile.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco glanced over his shoulder and saw a look of horror on Granger’s delicate features. He forgot, sometimes, that although she’d fought the same war he had and seen her fair share of horrible things, her memories didn’t include detailed information on the preferences of England’s darkest wizards. Shuttering his expression, he turned back to pursue the remnants of the exploded cauldron.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Indeed.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Wand waving, he cast an illuminating spell over the remnants of whatever potion was being brewed when it exploded, killing the creator and sending bits and pieces of the cauldron through the walls of the neighboring shop. While the DMLE was standard to these types of incidents, the amount of destruction and the lingering hint of dark magic had resulted in Draco being called to the scene, followed quickly thereafter by the swottiest Auror known to Wizarding kind.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The purple swirl of magic that oozed out of the destruction had him frowning, knowing that the strong response from the spell didn’t bode well. There was indeed traces of dark magic amongst the destruction, and this, combined with the small scrap of parchment Granger had recently waved in his face, had him cataloguing concerns in the back of his mind while he followed the purple smoke to its concentration point.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What have you found?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco ignored the question, instead lowering himself to get closer to the ground so he could investigate the object the spell he’d cast was focusing on. With a quick flick of his wrist, he cast a finite incantatum and levitated the small glass sphere up to his eye level.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Is that a prophecy? I thought they’d all been destroyed?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He smirked. “Yes, by you and yours if I remember correctly.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She swatted the back of his head and he glared up at her. “I’m not the Weasel, willing to suffer your abuse in the hopes for a snog, Granger. Keep your bloody hands to yourself.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She reddened and looked away from him, pulling her bottom lip between her teeth in such a way that made him think that perhaps he’d hurt her feelings. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I don’t snog Ronald, I’ll have you know. Haven’t in some time. Not that it’s any of your business.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Hmmm.” Draco studied her blush for a moment and watched her fidget with her skirt before abruptly turning her gaze back to him. A platinum eyebrow went up in a silent question before she spoke again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Honestly, Malfoy. Focus. We need to get this to the Ministry and have it evaluated.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Right.” He shoved the glowing orb into her hands and stood, brushing off the knees of his trousers. “Although,” he paused and cocked his head at her, “perhaps I should take that back given your propensity for destruction.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She stuck her tongue out at him before disapparating, leaving him with a satisfied smirk on his face. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The lifts in the Ministry were, perhaps, the slowest thing in the world. Draco sucked on his cheeks while he waited, contemplating the numerous ways he could slowly dismember Cormac McLaggen while also avoiding being thrown in Azkaban. How the numpty had managed to worm his way into Granger’s good graces he would never know. But the idiot had been her beau since Draco’s return two months ago. He had assumed, initially, that it was a ploy, some game Granger was playing to hurt him or make him jealous. But the longer it went on the more he couldn’t help but wonder if she just genuinely liked the twit.</p><p>This theory also had the unfortunate side-effect of lowering his opinion of the witch, something that felt inherently <em>wrong</em> somehow. His original hope was that he could work with this revised assessment of her intelligence to assist in his efforts to move <em>on</em>, but sadly it only reinforced his somewhat insane desire to shake some sense into her.</p><p>“Draco?”</p><p>Good lord. Speaking of the she-devil.</p><p>Fortifying himself with a deep breath, he smoothed his features before turning his head to look down at the woman who was risking life and limb to approach him.</p><p>“What do you want, Granger?”</p><p>She didn’t answer immediately, instead looking at him as though he were some sort of puzzle. His signature sneer began to grow the longer she stared.</p><p>“Get on with it, I don’t have all day. Not all of us have time to <em>socialize</em> at work.”</p><p>She colored and he knew he’d driven his point home.</p><p>“I wanted to know if you’d had a chance to review my report on the –“</p><p>“The Neely investigation. Yes.” He raised a brow and looked down his nose at her. “I <em>do</em> know how to do my job.”</p><p>“Of course. I know that.” Her eyes searched his face, but he kept his expression neutral, resisting the urge to grab her, press her up against the wall, and snog her senseless. His emotionless response began to make her uncomfortable, if the blush on her cheeks was any indication. She smoothed her robes and took a quick step backward. “Right, well, I’m off then. Have a good night.”</p><p>Luckily, the lift chose that moment to stop and open for him, allowing him to make his departure without saying anything or having to stand awkwardly while she continued to back away and return to her bloody boyfriend. Draco wanted nothing more than to lash out at the wall of the contraption, but instead he utilized his occlumency skills to slowly build a perimeter around the screaming, crying part of himself that recognized that <em>his bloody witch</em> was getting away from him.</p><p>What he needed that stubborn voice in his head to understand was that she was already <em>gone.</em> And until he was able to explain to her the circumstances around their separation, it was likely she’d never return.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“Potter.”</p><p>The Chosen One looked up from his desk and blinked a few times before sighing in resignation.</p><p>“What can I do for you, Malfoy?”</p><p>Draco shut the door to Potter’s office and planted his hands on the desk before leaning over it.</p><p>“Explain to me why the investigation I completed nearly <em>two months</em> ago is still open?”</p><p>Green eyes stared into his before Potter turned away.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“What do you mean ‘no’?”</p><p>“I mean, no. The investigation remains open for reasons I can’t disclose to you.”</p><p>Draco sneered. “Can’t? Or won’t?”</p><p>Potter just shrugged and went back to his scratching.</p><p>Draco resisted the urge to punch the bespectacled Auror in the nose. When Potter had approached him all those months ago and disclosed the nature of the investigation they needed to complete, Draco had been suspicious. Leery of having his previous association with the Death Eaters leveraged for the purpose of what at the time appeared to be a wild goose chase had not sat well with him, but Potter and the Weasel had made a very strong argument for getting him to agree to the efforts.</p><p>What he hadn’t expected, and what he had, in fact, resented and regretted ever since, was having been sworn to secrecy until the investigation was officially closed. Without the stamp of approval, literally, from the head Auror and the Ministry, Draco was incapable of sharing the details of his efforts with anyone aside from the git sitting across from him.</p><p>Unfortunately, ‘anyone’ included a certain frizzy haired witch who he had just abandoned in front of the lifts. Had he not been bound by an Unbreakable Vow, Draco would have disclosed the entire thing to her months ago. But he had miscalculated, a shameful mistake for the Slytherin Prince (even he could admit that), and had been outsmarted by the Golden Boy and his ginger side kick. What he’d thought would be a commitment of a few days, a week at most, had dragged out over months. He’d been forced to cut off all contact with anyone not directly involved in the investigation and the Unbreakable Vow he’d made had prohibited him from speaking about why he had left, where he had been, or what he’d been doing until the damn case was closed.</p><p>And it <em>was</em> closed. It should have been. It needed to be. Draco had to be able to crawl out of the mess he’d found himself in upon his return. He couldn’t bear the idea of his life going on as it was now. Especially not after having had a taste of something so wonderfully different.</p><p>“Was there anything else, Malfoy?”</p><p>Pulling himself from his ruminations, Draco glared down at the dark head of hair.</p><p>“You can’t keep the case open forever. Eventually, you’ll have to officially close it. And then what will you do?”</p><p>Potter looked up, a frown on his face, green eyes glittering with anger.</p><p>“Are you threatening me?”</p><p>Draco simply lifted a brow before casually sweeping a stack of papers from his supervisor’s desk and turning on heel, leaving the door open as he exited.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“I cannot believe you.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco quirked a brow at his lunch companion, amused by her frustration.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What part of it is so surprising to you, Granger? The fact that I managed to get us out of the staff meeting, or the fact that you went along with it?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She blushed into her coffee, taking a large gulp and lowering the oversized mug, showing off a fine milk moustache.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I know you think I’m a habitual rule breaker, but it does actually make me terribly uncomfortable.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He snorted.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I have a hard time believing that. You’re telling me the witch that was responsible for the creation of Dumbledore’s Army gets anxiety over skipping out on a staff meeting?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“That was different!” she hissed, leaning over the table. “The entirety of the wizarding world was at stake and I made a choice.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He swallowed, remembering his own choices at that age and suddenly wished he hadn’t brought it up. The fire in her eyes was quickly replaced by guilt.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She reached across the table. “Oh, Draco. No –”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He jerked his hand away and cut her off.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“We both know I was a complete shit, Granger. Still am, obviously, since I’m forcing you to skip out on work to get a coffee.” Having lost the lighthearted mood he’d been in earlier when he’d convinced her to skip off with him, he stood, tossing several galleons on the table.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Let’s get you back to the office before I taint you any further.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The brunette witch studied him for a moment before standing, putting herself directly in front of him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You aren’t…tainting me. You aren’t the same boy you were at Hogwarts, you know.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>His grey eyes searched hers, looking for answers to a question he wasn’t even sure he’d asked. At some point in the last several weeks of working together on this blasted prophecy investigation, she’d softened towards him and he had absolutely no idea what he’d done to deserve it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m still me, Granger. Pureblood git, spoiled brat, absolute prick to your friends.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A small smile played around her mouth.</em>
</p><p><em>“Be that as it may, that’s not </em>all<em> you are Malfoy.” She leaned up on her toes and put her mouth next to his ear. “In fact–” he shuddered at the whisper of her breath on his neck– “I find I quite like this version of you.”</em></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Why the fuck are we here?”</p><p>“Nice language.”</p><p>Draco gave his friend a two-finger salute before downing the shot of…something blue he had never heard of. Why he had let Blaise drag him out to Muggle London of all places was beyond him, but he had, and now he was here, wanting to be literally anywhere else.</p><p>“Just answer the question,” he said. “Are you dating Muggles now?”</p><p>Blaise gave him a look. “Not all of us are quite so liberated, Malfoy. Some of us are still expected to marry a nice pureblood girl and have lots of sex and babies.”</p><p>“Disgusting.”</p><p>“Agreed, but there you have it.”</p><p>“I do hate repeating myself, Blaise, so be a dear and answer the bloody question.”</p><p>Zabini held his shot glass aloft in a mock salute before downing a shot of the same blue concoction Draco had just consumed. He slammed it down and swept his arm in a wide arc over the floor of the dance club.</p><p>“We are here, my dear platinum friend, to get you laid.”</p><p>Draco cringed and shook his head.</p><p>“Absolutely not, Zabini. I don’t need you plucking birds out of the crowd for me to shag.”</p><p>“You need <em>something</em>. You’ve been in a right state since you got back from whatever mysterious adventure you went on, and I, for one, am sick of it.”</p><p>Draco ran his finger over the rim of the shot glass and contemplated the aquamarine remains. He hadn’t ever attempted to speak with Blaise about his disappearance, and frankly it never occurred to him the other man would care. They were friends, of course, but it was hardly a shock when one of them disappeared for days or weeks at a time. A two-month absence was notable, but certainly nothing to be worried about. Draco was certain Zabini was more concerned about his current mental state than where he might have gone.</p><p>“I’m not interested in a casual shag, Blaise.”</p><p>The other man’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“What about a less than casual shag?”</p><p>Draco looked over the crowd before shrugging.</p><p>“Certainly not with anyone here.”</p><p>He felt Blaise’s eyes on him and reminded himself that Zabini was smarter than he appeared.</p><p>“What if we left? Where, exactly, would we have to go to get you happily fucked?”</p><p>Draco smirked, refusing to fall for the trap.</p><p>“Nice language.” He narrowed his gaze, a thought occurring to him. “Why the sudden interest in seeing me off with some female?”</p><p>Blaise shrugged.</p><p>“As I said, I’m tired of your mood. You were borderline ebullient before you left to Merlin knows where, and then after two months of not a single word, you come back and act as though the Dark Lord has returned.” His friend’s face showed an expression of genuine concern. “Honestly, Drake, I haven’t seen you like this since sixth year. Where did you go?”</p><p>Draco sighed and ran his hand through his hair, completely destroying the perfectly coifed locks.</p><p>“I can’t tell you.”</p><p>“We’ve been friends forever, you can and you should.”</p><p>“No, I mean– “ Draco paused and cleared his throat. “I literally <em>can’t</em>. I took an Unbreakable Vow.”</p><p>“Why would you do that, you absolute git?”</p><p>“I miscalculated.”</p><p>Blaise snorted. “Massive understatement, mate.”</p><p>“I wasn’t anticipating the circumstances to last so long, and by the time I returned it had all gone to shit anyway.” Draco flagged down the cocktail waitress and ordered more drinks while he pretended not to see Blaise’s concerned stare.</p><p>“What had all gone to shit?”</p><p>“Her.”</p><p>“Her who?”</p><p>“Sod off, Zabini. What difference does it make?”</p><p>“It obviously makes enough of a difference to have you moping about like some Hufflepuff halfwit.”</p><p>Draco ground his teeth together and resisted running his hand through his hair a second time. Pulling on his occlumency skills, he slowly relaxed his jaw and met his friend’s curious gaze.</p><p>“I am not moping. My absence simply gave the woman an opportunity to sift through her feelings and discover, unsurprisingly, that she was better off with someone less…me. I am simply annoyed at having been so clearly misinformed. You know how I hate being proven incorrect.” He quirked a blond brow at the man across from him in an effort to exude nonchalance as the cocktail waitress placed several more of the blue concoctions on their table. “No harm done, just a bruised ego.”</p><p>Blaise studied him for a moment before shrugging and reaching for the shot.</p><p>“Well, there certainly is enough of your ego to go around.”</p><p>Draco smirked and downed another drink while he quietly shoved his memories of a bushy haired Muggle-born into the corners of his mind.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“What is this?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione raised her head from the parchment she was reading as he entered her office, a small smile playing about her lips.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Good morning to you as well, Mr. Malfoy.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco felt the corners of his mouth quirk up at her greeting. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Granger.” He tossed the small volume he’d found on his desk that morning onto the stack of parchment piled precariously on the corner of the large table she was currently studying at. “I found this on my desk this morning, next to a rather delicious concoction labeled ‘caramel macchiato’. Would you know anything about that?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She blushed and reached for the slender, leather-bound book. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I went to a Starbucks on the way here this morning and thought you might enjoy something different.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“A what now?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He watched Hermione lean back in her chair and hold the volume to her chest. Tossing her hair, she tried to look defiant, but he could see the cracks in her armor. The woman was nervous. How intriguing.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“It’s a…Muggle coffee shop.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The source of her anxiety was suddenly apparent, and he gracefully lowered himself into the chair across from her on the other side of the round table, stretching his legs out so that his feet brushed the hem of her robes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Muggle coffee is delicious. I demand more of it.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Her small smile grew into a laugh, and he found himself trying to figure out ways to make her do it again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You’re hardly in a position to make demands, Malfoy.”</em>
</p><p><em>He leaned forward and snatched the book out of her hands, waving it in front of her face. “Oh </em>really<em>.”</em></p><p><em>Hermione leaned forward and snatched it back. “Yes, </em>really!” <em>She put the volume down between the two of them and tapped the title. “See this? I found it in the Ministry library. It’s the private journal of a Hogwarts potions master. I was hoping to find something that might provide us more information on the combination of ingredients we learned were in the cauldron that exploded, and I came across this.” Draco watched as her hands opened the volume, amused by her short, unpainted nails that were covered in ink. “Here. This is what I wanted you to look at.” She pointed at a fat paragraph of scrawling text and looked up at him with a triumphant smile. “See?”</em></p><p>
  <em>“Not in the least. Your hand is covering everything.” He pulled the book out from underneath her fingers and held it aloft, narrowing his gaze while he read and then re-read the hand-written recipe. “This can’t be right.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione’s brow wrinkled as she watched him. “What do you mean? It matches perfectly.”</em>
</p><p><em>Draco pinched the bridge of his nose before placing the book down between them again. Few people knew how skilled he was in potions</em>–<em> most of his classmates assuming his high marks in the subject were solely due to his relationship with Professor Snape. But he was a master potioneer in his own right, having studied in Poland after the war and getting certified prior to joining the Auror department. Hermione was one of the few who was aware of his proficiency.</em></p><p>
  <em>“The ingredients match, yes. But look here. The recipe requires the casting of a specific spell during the production of the potion.” He looked up at her as she leaned over with him, her hair brushing his cheek. He resisted the urge to inhale, instead slipping behind his occlumency while he refocused on the text. “This cast requires preparation as well.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione frowned and looked up, turning her head to him. Their proximity was almost palpable; he could feel her breath on his face. She blushed and leaned back. “Right, well, what kind of preparation? I’m not familiar with the spell.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco swallowed and closed the book before looking down at his feet. “It’s dark magic, Granger. I haven’t…obviously…ever - well, I’ve seen it cast. Before. During the war.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What does it do, Draco?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She never used his first name, but he was too focused on the purpose of the spell and what it implied to allow himself to linger on the meaning behind it. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He didn’t want to answer her question.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The pounding in his head woke him before his alarm, and with a grunt he rolled out of bed and pushed his toes into the plush carpet beneath his feet. The Manor was cold, in more ways than just temperature, and he waited for the pounding behind his eyes to diminish slightly before standing up. His feet made no sound as he crossed the room, pulling his dressing robe from its place on the wall before shrugging into it and running his hands through his hair. The washroom held several potions in the large medicine cabinet, and he downed one before returning to his bedroom, where he grabbed his wand and exited to the hallway.</p><p>He ignored the somewhat horrified commentary of his ancestors as he made his way to the dining room, where he helped himself to a cup of tea and a copy of the morning’s Prophet. The throbbing in his head intensified when he saw the headline.</p><p align="center">
  <em>Dark Wizards Return?</em>
</p><p>“Bloody fucking hell.” He scanned the article, parsing out facts from embellishments. As he finished reading through the last of the article, he realized there was only one possible conclusion he could draw from the level of detail included <em>and</em> excluded within the exposé.</p><p>Harry fucking Potter had fed the information to the paper and conveniently left out all the details of Draco’s involvement in the investigation. That would absolutely <em>not</em> do.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Sir, Mr. Potter isn’t available for visitors.”</p><p>Draco ignored the prim secretary outside the Head Auror’s office and threw the door open, only to find the large room empty. Gritting his teeth, he turned and stomped over to her desk.</p><p>“And where is the illustrious prick at the moment?”</p><p>The witch blushed at his language and attempted to glare back at him, but faltered after a few moments.</p><p>“He’s, erm, out.”</p><p>Draco straightened, his upper lip curling as he stared down at her.</p><p>“Are you an idiot or just incompetent? Isn’t knowing where Harry fucking Potter is in your job description?”</p><p>The girl’s chin wobbled and she looked down, straightening her parchment. Lovely, now he’d made her cry.</p><p>“He’s meeting with the Minister.” She clasped her hands in front of her and looked up. “Sir.”</p><p>Draco inhaled sharply before he spun on his heel and made his way back to the lifts. The Minister’s office was on a different floor and he could only hope that he would be able to get a grip on his frustration before making anyone else’s secretary weep.</p><p>No one who shared the lift with him made eye contact and Draco’s sneer deepened as he exited to the marble floor that housed the Minister of Magic and his underlings. His dragon-hide shoes clipped a rhythm on the tiles as he made his way to the small lobby before Kingsley’s lair. As he approached, however, he heard the distinct voice of scarhead himself.</p><p>“Yes sir, the investigation is finished.”</p><p>“Very good, Potter. Glad to have that case behind you, I imagine?”</p><p>“Indeed, sir. Grateful to be able to move on.”</p><p>Draco lay in wait until he saw the tell-tale scarecrow-like mop of black hair around the corner,  at which point he stepped out directly in front of the shorter man.</p><p>“Hello, Potter.”</p><p>Green eyes glared up at him, covering the surprise quicker than Draco would have liked.</p><p>“Malfoy. What are you doing lurking about?” The other man shouldered past him in an effort to escape the conversation, but Draco spun on his heels and stepped into line with him.</p><p>“I find lurking allows me to overhear fascinating tidbits about my coworkers. Such as the one you just shared with Kingsley, for example, regarding a certain case being wrapped up.”</p><p>The slight coloring of the Chosen One’s cheeks was enough to give him away. Draco clenched his jaw, resisting the urge to hex him.</p><p>“That wasn’t the Dolohov case, Malfoy. I told you, there are still – “</p><p>Draco had had enough. He stepped directly in front of the man.</p><p>“You’re lying,” he hissed. “I saw the article in the Prophet this morning. I know you told them the investigation was ‘wrapped up’. There is only one possible investigation that would match that headline, Potter. The real question is <em>why?”</em></p><p>Green eyes met grey and Potter’s expression hardened.</p><p>“You know why. She’s <em>happy,</em> Malfoy. Leave her alone.” Draco’s surprise at the answer allowed the other man to shove him out of the way. “And the next time you harass me, I’m writing you up.”</p><p>Draco watched the other man disappear around a corner as he recovered from the shock of having Potter be honest with him. He’d known Potter’s reasons for choosing him to work this case and forcing him into that ridiculous vow were related to Hermione, but having him confess his motivation as though it was the most obvious thing in the world was unexpected.</p><p>“Fucking Gryffindors.”</p><p>Draco straightened his robes and remained motionless in the hallway for a few minutes, his brain working furiously to plot his next course of action regarding Hermione. As he shuffled through his options, the woman in question rounded the corner, accompanied by her new love interest. The other man smiled tightly at Draco as he stepped aside to let them pass, but Hermione’s brown eyes narrowed in concern and he could have sworn she slowed her pace for a moment before being distracted by her companion. The sharp pain in his chest was becoming too familiar for comfort, but he found he was unable to respond with a sneer or dismissal. He <em>missed</em> her. And as he watched her glance briefly over her shoulder before disappearing from his sight, a small frown on her face, he wondered for the first time since he’d returned if perhaps, she missed him, too.</p>
