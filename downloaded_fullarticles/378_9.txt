  <em> The Hogwarts Express, 1st September 1976 </em>

</p><p>“For the love of Merlin, would you please move?”</p><p>“Marlene!” </p><p>“I really hate first years.”</p><p>“Well, you can’t shove them like that. I’m a Prefect.”</p><p>“You were a Prefect last year.”</p><p>“I’d like to keep that up, if you don’t mind.”</p><p>“Anything for you, Lil.”</p><p>“There’s Alice!”</p><p>“Seriously, <em> move!” </em></p><p>Lily Evans practically flung herself into the train compartment, desperate to take refuge from the heaving corridor. Marlene McKinnon shortly followed, swearing in irritation. </p><p>“Finally!” Alice Fortescue said, already in the compartment and looking harassed. </p><p>“Sorry, sorry,” Lily apologised. “I had the Prefects meeting and Marlene insisted on waiting for me.” </p><p>“I’m so attached to her,” Marlene said dryly. </p><p>“I had to fend off a group of fourth years to keep this.” Alice complained.</p><p>“Fourth years?” Asked Lily, disentangling her red hair from her messenger bag. </p><p>“They’ve grown a real attitude over the summer,” Alice replied indignantly. </p><p>Marlene snorted, “I’m sure they have, love.” She planted a smacking kiss on her cheek and Alice giggled, her creased brow clearing. Lily hugged her friend with a grin; Alice was the smallest out of them and mostly sweet tempered, so it was always brilliant to watch her get riled up. </p><p>Marlene, on the other hand, was almost always ready to fight, but her long golden curls and troublemaker grin usually stopped her opponents in their tracks first. </p><p>Lily felt what she could only describe as a relief to be back at Hogwarts for their sixth year. As they shot past cities and into the countryside, her lonely summer felt far behind. Good. </p><p>“Where’s Mary?” Marlene looked around the compartment as though she would find their friend hiding on the luggage shelf. </p><p>Alice raised her eyebrows pointedly, pretending to flick through <em> The Daily Prophet </em>, “She followed Benjy Fenwick down the platform and left me to grab all the bags.” </p><p>“She’s still stuck on Fenwick?” Lily shook her head in sympathy for her friend. Mary Macdonald was their fourth member and Benjy, a charming Ravenclaw also in sixth year, had bought Mary a drink in The Three Broomsticks last year, and she hadn’t quite let it go. </p><p>“Everyone’s stuck on Fenwick, Lily,” Alice reminded her, causing Marlene to roll her eyes. </p><p>“She’s like a puppy following him around,” She said, poking treats through the gaps of her owl’s cage. Her eyes lit up and she smirked at Lily. </p><p>The redhead shot her a warning look. “No.”</p><p>“Speaking of lovesick puppies…” Marlene said in delight. </p><p>“Come on, Mar, I’m having such a good morning.”</p><p>“Has anyone seen James yet?” She asked innocently, and Alice poorly hid a smile. </p><p>Lily folded her arms. “No, I have not,” She replied tartly. </p><p>“Merlin, that is strange. Last September, you had already hexed him by eleven forty-five that morning,” Marlene recalled fondly. </p><p>“There’s still time!” Alice chimed in and Marlene snorted. </p><p>Lily slumped in her seat with a groan. The train had barely left London and James Potter had already made headlines in her life. She’d done a fairly good job of forgetting about him that summer in the safety of her muggle life, although losing her singular friend from home had made that slightly more difficult. With her only other option being spending time with her sister Petunia and her ridiculous new boyfriend, was it really Lily’s fault if she occasionally thought she saw him in a crowd at the supermarket, or leaving the park? Nobody resented her wandering brain more than her. Boredom was a killer. </p><p>The end of her fifth year at Hogwarts had been a turning point in Lily’s life. A reality check, of sorts. Her final shred of childhood naivety had drowned in the Great Lake this past June as soon as the slur had left Severus Snape’s lips. She could hate him for that alone, stealing that trustworthy, open part of her. Lily thought she saw the world for what it was now, and the world proved to be exceedingly dark. </p><p>And Potter… his guilt those last couple of weeks of the term had clearly plagued him. All he wanted to do was apologise for something he had not even done. So much so, that eventually Lily’s friends had decided that making fun of Potter was a good way to distract her. But after the heat of anger had cooled, Lily knew Potter may have been childish, but Severus was something much worse. He was hateful. </p><p>Lily wasn’t about to give him a Potter a free pass, though. How unbearable would he be if he knew she didn’t think he was <em> completely </em> tiresome? She shuddered. Potter’s incessant ambushes of date proposals had earned Lily all kinds of attention last year. She was annoyed that <em> this </em> is how she had been placed on the map of Hogwarts: the unwavering object of James Potter’s affections. </p><p>Mary’s flustered entrance jarred Lily from her thoughts, and she smiled up at the dark haired witch. As always, she was dressed smartly, today in a matching set of a blue blazer and trousers, her hair immaculate. </p><p>“Nice of you to join us, Mary!” Marlene instantly stood, wrapping her up in a hug which no doubt messed up her hair on purpose. She cackled as Mary pushed her away, smoothing her hands over her head. </p><p>“Watch it, Marlene!” She scowled, but couldn’t keep the smile from her face as the blonde stuck her tongue out and sat down, opening a box of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans.  </p><p>Mary collapsed onto the seat beside Lily and pulled her in for a delicate hug. “How are you, Lil? Did you survive the week at the McKinnon madhouse?”</p><p>A Bertie Bott’s bean flew across the carriage. </p><p>Lily shrugged dramatically, “I’m here, aren’t I?” </p><p>Mary laughed but her eyes softened as she asked, “You are alright, though? Your letters were miserable.”</p><p>Lily winced in memory. She may  or may not have written a few letters laden with self-pity to her friends over the summer. Something about being friendless and her sister dating a walrus. </p><p>“I’m fine,” She reassured her friend. “A week with Marlene and her three very loud brothers was enough to make me realise I should have valued the silence.”</p><p>More colourful beans were projectiled across the compartment by Marlene, and the four of them fell into laughter as they recalled their own experiences at the McKinnon household. As Alice pulled a face at the memory of the eldest brother Nicholas charming the bathroom toilet to flush in reverse, Lily thought it was good to be home. </p><p>

  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>Many hours later, Lily and her friends disembarked from the train now dressed in their Gryffindor robes, Marlene still looping her tie around her neck as they walked with the crowds toward the carriages. The sky had opened and rain soaked Hogsmeade, but all four girls grinned at the looming castle above, candlelight glowing in the thousands of windows. Bundling into a carriage, Lily kept her eyes out the window as the others chatted, never taking her gaze off the steadily approaching turrets standing proudly against the night sky. A safe haven for them all. She glanced at Mary, now tying Marlene’s tie for her after not being able to look at the shabby attempt. Kind, sophisticated Mary, also muggle born. </p><p>Thunder lit the sky as the carriage dropped them off at the entrance, several screaming second years darting past them. Lily scoffed and pushed her damp hair back as she led the way into the castle. They sighed in relief at the warmth that immediately greeted them inside. </p><p>“Oh, look, there’s Emmeline!” Mary said, pointing out the Ravenclaw who waved at them from across the entrance hall. Alice immediately blushed as seventh year Gryffindors Frank Longbottom, Hestia Jones and Dorcas Meadowes greeted them with brief hugs before following the crowd into the Great Hall. </p><p>All four of them charmed their robes dry and stepped forward as a voice found them. </p><p>“Would you dry me off too, Evans?” </p><p>Lily rolled her eyes and turned expectantly to see Potter, only to find Sirius Black grinning at her in the entrance hall with mischief in his dark yet warm eyes. He <em> was </em>sopping wet, and she grimaced. Lily didn’t realise she had been awaiting Potter’s annoying entrance until it was his best friend before her. </p><p>“How are my favourite Gryffindor sixth year girls?” </p><p>Alice frowned as she did the math. </p><p>“Hello, Sirius,” Lily replied apprehensively, raising an eyebrow. “All alone?” </p><p>He winked at her, “I won’t tell James you asked after him, it might kill the poor sod.” </p><p>Marlene snickered and Lily’s face flushed, annoyed. “You know what I mean. It’s so unusual to see you without your usual chorus of disruption is all.” </p><p>“Alright, stop flirting with me, Evans,” He grinned at her scoff before taking Marlene and Alice’s arm in each of his with a flourish. “Shall I escort you to the Great Hall, my ladies?”</p><p>Marlene and Alice laughed as he whisked them away, leaving Mary to tug an already pissed off Lily along. </p><p>The Great Hall was teeming with students waving across tables and hugging friends they haven't seen all summer. Shouts of laughter rang out as sparks flew across Lily and Mary’s path. Lily narrowed her eyes good naturedly at the third year Hufflepuffs who tried to hide the incriminating wands in their sleeves. </p><p>“There they are,” Mary said to her, and Lily saw with some resignation that Marlene and Alice had chosen to sit with none other than their fellow sixth years, clearly guided by Sirius, who sat grinning, drumming his fingers on the table. The three other sixth year boys, or <em> The Marauders </em>, as they so affectionately called themselves, were already there. Remus Lupin, folding up his paper, Peter Pettigrew, who spoke excitedly to her fellow prefect, and James Potter, hair tousled and shirt sleeves rolled up as he spoke to Marlene. </p><p>Her chest gave a pinch she didn’t anticipate, and Lily coughed, as though someone would hear it. </p><p>Oh Merlin, he looked good. </p><p>Fine. </p><p>She meant that he looked fine. Regular. Average. He had a nose and eyes and mouth. Big deal. </p><p>Lily’s eyes skated over his arms, tanned and slightly more snug in his shirt sleeves from a no doubt brilliant summer playing quidditch every day. Also fine. From a purely loyal Gryffindor point of view, the house quidditch team couldn’t have their captain slacking off during the summer. Exercise was important. </p><p>Lily gave herself a mental slap.</p><p>Alice had once joked that Potter had a ‘Lily radar’ as he always seemed to know when she was coming, but he didn’t look up as she approached. </p><p>“We see who your favourites are, Sirius Black,” Mary said as a way of greeting and slid into the seat next to Peter very pointedly. </p><p>“I’m playing hard to get,” he replied airily and she flipped him off. </p><p>“Hello again, Lily,” Remus interrupted. She just grinned at him, having already seen him at the Prefects meeting this morning. Lily liked Remus a lot and she was glad her yelling at his closest friends every other day for the past few years had not impacted on his friendship with her. </p><p>Peter nervously half-waved at her, and she returned the gesture with a laugh as her eyes found Potter’s. His hand seemed to jump up to his hair before falling somewhat awkwardly in the air between them as she took her seat opposite him, of all places. </p><p>Perhaps they had room on the Ravenclaw table. </p><p>Suddenly, he held out the hand instead and she raised her eyebrows at it. </p><p>“All right, Evans?” He said casually, and the familiarity of his hazel eyes jarred her into taking his hand and shaking it once. His calloused hand was warm as he held her smaller one for a beat before withdrawing. </p><p>She realised it might have been the first time she’d ever touched him. Lily’s hand felt like she’d grabbed hold of a live wire.</p><p>Lily cleared her throat. “Potter,” She said dismissively, if only to get some routine back and retreat to solid ground. </p><p>“What the fuck?” muttered Marlene in awe. </p><p>It was only then that Lily realised that the other six had been watching in silence with expressions ranging from smothered laughter to utter confusion. Lily folded her hands in her lap and frowned at them all. </p><p>“What?” she asked at what she hoped would sound nonchalant but ended up as irritated. Her eyes darted once more to Potter whose eyes, for once, did not betray him. </p><p>Lily could have kissed Professor Dumbledore and the rest of the professors for choosing that moment to arrive and call for silence. </p><p><em> Nope </em>, she realised, silence was worse. </p><p>Was she breathing too loudly? Oh, Merlin, why did she have to be opposite Potter? Lily wished she could scowl at him but frankly, he hadn’t done anything wrong. He had done precisely nothing toward or concerning her.  She was on her guard even as he didn’t seem to pay Lily any heed and Professor McGonagall arrived with the Sorting Hat firmly in hand.  </p><p>Bristling, she concentrated on the first years as they skipped off to each house table. She attempted to make a note of each new Gryffindor’s name, as any good Prefect would, but the information dripped through her ears like water. Lily thought the absence of charmed bits of parchment carrying ridiculous pick up lines her way was putting her on edge. </p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>James Potter was stressed. </p><p>All summer long, he’d thought about that day at the lake after the O.W.L. exam. That day - that entire year, really - all James wanted was for Lily Evans to look at him rather than Severus Snape. </p><p>He could admit now that he hadn’t really thought about the repercussions it would have on her. He hadn’t considered that it would hurt her to lose a friend, even one as foul as Snape. Lily had an open mind and a loving heart, and she wanted to believe he could be better than everyone’s expectations. His blood began to boil, even now, at the memory of her face when he betrayed her in front of the castle that day. </p><p>James had thought he would have revelled in Snape’s downfall, but he only saw her face. He didn’t care about that waste of space anymore. He didn’t even want to go near Snape, let alone hex him. The end of fifth year had been a turning point for James. </p><p>Over the summer he had begun to mull over everything he had done for cheap laughs. What had once seemed harmless to him gradually flipped in his memory until he realised he might finally be looking at what Lily Evans had always seen. It wasn’t until a joke was at her expense did James realise that he perhaps <em> wasn’t </em>funny (Merlin, his own growth surprised him). He had just been so desperate to make her laugh. Needless to say, he had not succeeded. </p><p>It was Remus - tired of watching James sulk over the summer in the spare moments he had to miss a certain Gryffindor prefect who wouldn’t think of him at all - who recommended he take a step back this year. </p><p>“He means chill the fuck out, Prongs,” Sirius had added helpfully. </p><p>So James was chill. However, external only. He thought his brain might explode soon from being so quiet. He was doing it, though. He might have second, third and fourth-guessed himself today, but it was dinnertime, Lily was opposite him and he hadn’t even told her she looked gorgeous, which she did. Though she had dried off her robes, the drops of rain had curled the baby hairs surrounding her face and it was agonising for him to not comment on it. </p><p>It didn’t help that he would never know how long she would have held their handshake had he not pulled away. He wasn’t sure what possessed him to hold out his hand like he was giving a job interview to a stranger instead of greeting a girl he’d known for five years, but he was bloody glad he had. </p><p>Her hands were soft and cold from the rain. </p><p>He was glad that the Sorting Ceremony had occurred when it had because coherent thoughts had escaped him. James was not surprised to find out that skin contact from Lily Evans was far better than a roll of her eyes, and James very much <em> liked </em> when she rolled her eyes. She may as well have squeezed his poor old heart. James forced himself not to count every time she glanced up at him as the food appeared, but he did wonder if it was more than usual. He tuned into the conversation just as Alice spoke up. </p><p>“You lot didn’t grace us with your presence on the train today, ” She looked at James. “Most unusual.” </p><p>“They missed us!” Sirius exclaimed in a singsong voice. James didn’t have to fake his groan. He couldn’t believe his biggest concern wasn’t himself screwing up but Sirius. </p><p>“I wish you’d talk less, Padfoot,” Was all he said. </p><p>“So what’s the big prank this year?” Lily asked suddenly, and James jumped.  </p><p>“Who says there’s a prank, Evans?” He replied innocently. Her eyes were slightly narrowed, as though he was a potion brewing instruction she particularly disagreed with.  </p><p>“Says history,” She deadpanned. </p><p>“She’s right, you always pull something out of your arses at the welcome feast,” Marlene agreed, helping herself to potatoes. </p><p>“Charming, McKinnon,” Sirius tutted. </p><p>“You’ve never asked before,” James replied to Marlene, but his eyes flicked back to Lily, who’s attention was on her plate. </p><p>“She’s finally lost faith in me to keep you in line,” Remus said with mock solemn. </p><p>Lily pointed her fork at him. “Bingo. You’ve let me down, Remus. Now here I am eating dinner with these heathens.”</p><p>James could feel his lips tugging upward and he fought hard not to grin. He had missed her dry humour.</p><p>Sirius clutched his heart, “Did you think of me at all over the summer, Evans?” </p><p>Pretending to think, Lily frowned, “Do dreams count?” She asked him sincerely and James almost choked into his goblet, resisting the urge to smack Sirius, who grinned appreciatively and pointed a finger at her as the others laughed. “Absolutely.”</p><p>James didn’t miss the glance that Remus shot his way, a knowing smile on his lips. Sirius, apparently, would never change. Lily didn’t seem to mind though, as she blushed slightly, a relenting smile on her face, and James was grateful, his gaze once again drifting across her face only to meet the eyes of Alice who watched him with a pointed stare. He gave her a reluctant smile as she shook her head in silent laughter. </p><p>“I liked the fireworks,” James looked up in surprise as Lily spoke quietly, phrasing it almost like a question. The rest were listening in disgust to a dream Sirius claimed he had about Professor McGonagall. </p><p>James must have looked confused, because she clarified, “Last year’s welcome feast, you set off fireworks that were inside the roast chickens.” </p><p>“Uh,” James was slightly shell shocked she remembered that at all. More so, she remembered it with <em> fondness </em>? He attempted to be casual, “Yeah, yeah. That was my idea. I thought you…” He trailed off. </p><p>“I’m not the Grinch, Potter.” </p><p>“The what?” </p><p>“Never mind,” She shook her head as though she regretted speaking at all. </p><p><em> Good job </em> , <em> James </em>, he thought. This might have been the first time he felt awkward in his life. For some reason she was speaking to him, and it wasn’t a hex at the end of a wand. By the time he cleared his head enough to open his mouth, Lily had already moved on to listen to Alice, giggling and very clearly whispering about Frank. To his credit, Frank looked at his peas with sheer determination despite Hestia nudging him pointedly. </p><p>When dessert arrived (numerous mouth watering options ranging from chocolate to lemon to fruits), the conversation took a grim turn that James had been awaiting. A summer of realisation for James had tied in with a summer of growing uncertainty and darkness for the wizarding world. His parents, both aurors, were increasingly busy and though they were excellent at putting on a brave face for their son, James knew well enough. People were disappearing. Open hatred and bigotry was becoming more and more common correlating with an increasing community of purebloods who wore their blood status with something more than pride - superiority. </p><p>He couldn’t help it, his eyes flicked to Lily. She would be mad if she noticed. </p><p>“It’s an absolutely archaic mindset,” Alice said, stabbing a profiterole, and Mary watched the speared ball of pastry in alarm. “The <em> language </em>…” She trailed off with a shake of her head. Almost in unison, they all craned their heads to look at the Slytherin table. James knew they were all thinking of a sunny afternoon in June. </p><p>He eyed the usual unsavoury group of students: Snape, Rosier, Travers, Jugson, Selwyn, Lestrange, Rowle and the Carrows. Their heads were bent together as they ate dessert and whispered amongst themselves. James thought it was bizarre. He never pictured such miserable gits eating pudding. </p><p>Of course, they were something like the B team. James remembered the older group that had been in their last years when he started at Hogwarts. Many of them Sirius’ family members like dead-eyed Bellatrix and Narcissa. James’ eyes swivelled to where his best mate’s younger brother sat, beside the group yet not engaged. Regulus Black toyed with his food, occasionally glancing up warily. James did not blink when he met his eyes across the Great Hall. The Slytherin boy looked away first. </p><p>“Don’t bother, Prongs,” Sirius said, clearly having watched the exchange. He was attempting a light tone, but his voice bore a bitter undercurrent. </p><p>Like a bad habit, James’ gaze strayed to Lily. She was frowning at her plate. </p><p>Suddenly, James got up and threw his friends a look of urgency before climbing out of his seat and keeping his walk to a saunter as he exited the hall, heads turning as he went. </p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>Sirius complained that changing the prank back to fireworks was repetitive, but when the red and gold lights began erupting under Professor Slughorn’s chair, James couldn’t disagree more.</p><p>Remus asked if this was the best idea for new, laid back James. He argued that when Lily had looked over at him during the display with curious eyes he had only folded his arms and shrugged. </p><p>She watched him after he turned away, though. And she saw the grin that crept onto his face. He was still James, after all. Being completely aloof was not in his nature. </p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>Lily had been lying in a stupor for a long time, staring up at the ceiling of her four poster bed. When the aftermath of the feast was over, Lily didn’t see the Marauders sans Remus again due to her Prefect duties of shepherding the first years to their dormitories. She thought that was probably best. </p><p>She couldn’t explain what was going on with her tonight, only that some kind of switch had flipped. Lily had not scolded the boys for their prank, she thought she might have even encouraged it. </p><p>Life was short. Perhaps she wasn’t interested in wasting anymore of it. </p><p>Sitting opposite Potter hadn’t been painless by any means, but not for the usual reasons. No, she didn’t want to examine her treacherous eyes for looking at him far more often than she should, than was acceptable. It was not just because he was leaner, and his jawline had impossibly sharpened, but his face was more sincere than she remembered it. </p><p>Lily had told Potter many times that she didn’t think he was good looking. She supposed she was brave enough now to admit that she had lied, here in the lamplight of a new year where the only sound was Marlene and Mary’s bickering and Alice’s occasional giggle. Lily had thought that lying might dent his insurmountable ego but it only seemed to make him smirk like he <em> knew </em> she was lying. <em> Ugh </em>, Lily hated people being one up on her. </p><p>She hugged her pillow, breathing in deeply as though she could rid herself of the remnants of Potter’s aftershave. When had he started shaving? She squeezed her eyes shut. <em> Who cares?  </em></p><p>Lily was glad when Marlene called over to her. Minutes later all  four of them had piled into Mary’s bed to watch Marlene’s dramatic reading of a letter Frank Longbottom had sent to Alice over the summer, the latter squealing at the sweet parts, half-heartedly attempting to snatch it back. </p><p>“You’re awful, Mar,” Alice pouted when she was finished. </p><p>Mary sighed wistfully, “I think it was really nice, Al. He likes you and he went for it.” </p><p>“You’re such a romantic,” Marlene shook her head. </p><p>“What?” Mary sat up. “There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be loved.” She cast a pointed gaze at Marlene. “You wouldn’t know because every boy who’s ever met you is in love with you.” </p><p>Lily wondered if she imagined the touch of hesitation before Marlene stuck out her tongue. “And not a single love letter!”</p><p>Alice shrieked then, “Blimey, it’s not a <em> love </em> letter!” </p><p>“<em> Love, Frank </em> ,” Lily read his sign off clearly. “I’m surprised he didn’t just address it to <em> my darling Alice </em>.” </p><p>“No, that’s much more Potter’s style.” Alice quipped. </p><p>Lily gave Alice a shove which caused Marlene to roll off the bed with a thump. Marlene simply pulled a cackling Mary by the elbow until she was on the floor too. Amongst the fits of laughter, the clock on the bedside struck twelve. </p><p>Sixth year had truly begun. </p><p>The summer had been long, and many things had changed. </p><p>More than Lily realised. </p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>“You speak exceptionally loudly for eight a.m.”</p><p>“Lily, it’s almost ten o’clock.”</p><p>She groaned at that, checking her watch to see that Alice told the truth. They were sat in their first lesson of the term, and Lily was not coping well. On top of not being a morning person <em> at all </em>, she had barely slept last night because was still so unnerved (well, partially because Marlene had decided to charm her hair pink but then couldn’t charm it back, meaning it was Lily fixing her bubblegum waves at two o’clock in the morning). </p><p>“Lily <em> Evans </em>,” chimed a voice, and she swivelled in her seat to see Benjy Fenwick grinning in amusement, perfectly white teeth glinting. Mary squeaked behind her. </p><p>“Nice to see you, Benjy. What do you want?” She asked him through a yawn. Marlene laughed. </p><p>“Flagging so early on?” He enquired, his smile never faltering. “It might be quite easy to beat you in Charms this year.”</p><p>Lily blinked the sleep from her eyes and wagged her quill at him, “Not a chance.” </p><p>She and Benjy had been having a friendly feud in Charms ever since fourth year when they’d both received top marks on the end of year essay. It was how the others had come to know the smooth-talking Ravenclaw, too. Benjy was a good laugh, and it drove Potter hopping mad when she found Fenwick funny and not him. Lily didn’t <em> enjoy </em> that of course. Much. </p><p>Swivelling back round in her seat, she made another attempt at the refresher questions they’d been given. Mary leaned over the desk to whisper furiously in her ear. </p><p>“Why didn’t you mention me?” </p><p>Lily whispered back, “You’re sitting right there, Mary, what was I supposed to say?” </p><p>She heard Marlene sigh and the next moment, Mary had been yanked backwards into her seat, as Professor Flitwick made his way back up to the front of the classroom, chuckling, “very good, Mr Potter” as he went.</p><p> Lily scowled and began scribbling. Alice soon got out of her chair to ask Flitwick a question, and was replaced immediately by James Potter. </p><p>“Got a spare quill, Evans?” He said, and she looked at him out of the side of her eye. He was a morning person alright. She could already hear Marlene and Mary sniggering. </p><p>Now Lily was irritated <em> and </em> confused. </p><p>“What are you doing?” She hissed at him. It looked like the summer hadn’t completely wiped away his unwarranted paranoia surrounding Benjy Fenwick. </p><p>Potter thought about it. “I think I’m looking for a quill.” Lily neglected to tell him what she really meant, <em> why are you approaching me today after being so weird last night?</em></p><p>“Not for you,” She replied shortly. “Would you go away, please?” She had no chance of finishing the questions with him and his prattling beside her. </p><p>“Right you are, Evans,” he quipped and he was gone. </p><p>Lily started. She had expected a bit more resistance. Perhaps a cutting comment about Benjy. <em> Something </em>. Merlin, her brain was fried. She had wanted him to go and he had done exactly that. Perfect. Bliss. </p><p>Except. </p><p> Slowly, she peeked over her shoulder. Nothing was ever simple with James Potter. </p><p>At the back of the classroom, Sirius had stolen Peter’s parchment whilst Remus shook his head and tried not to laugh. Potter, back in his seat and quill in hand, met her eyes. </p><p>She snapped to the front. Alice slid back into her seat, pausing to stare at Lily. </p><p>“What did I miss?” </p><p>“Nothing!” Lily said airily, staring at her parchment with great interest. She ignored Marlene’s snort behind her. </p><p>

</p><p>James had been in good spirits all morning when he rounded the corner with Sirius, Remus and Peter. </p><p>It had almost been a reflex to go and bother Lily when she interacted with the Ravenclaw. In his low moments, James thought Fenwick was arguably more charming than him. Once he had sat down, however, he had no idea what he was supposed to do or say without sounding obnoxious. Asking her out had become James’ verbal diarrhoea. </p><p>Then she had turned around.  </p><p>Not once, not ever, had she turned to look at him after asking him to piss off. Today she had turned. </p><p>He had felt a click, then. Green eyes glancing back became a key sealing the lock within himself, like the sound of his fate choosing its path. </p><p>The bounce in his step faltered when he saw who was in his Potions N.E.W.T. class. </p><p>Severus Snape, sulking on a table with Travers and Rosier. As James and his friends entered the dark classroom in the dungeons, Snape looked up, long black hair framing his face, sneering once he saw who it was. James glowered, and felt a hand rest on his shoulder. </p><p>“Let’s sit over here, Prongs,” muttered Remus, guiding him to a table away from Snape. </p><p>James thumped his bag onto the table unceremoniously. Two Hufflepuff students took the table in front throwing him bright smiles as they did so, and he scanned the room. </p><p>“The only table left is right next to <em> him </em>.” </p><p>Sirius, Remus and Peter copied his gaze to see that James spoke true. They heard it then, Marlene’s laughter echoing down the hall outside the door. </p><p>“Perhaps she won’t care.”</p><p>“After what he called her? Come on, Padfoot.”</p><p>Remus suggested, “Let’s offer the girls our table.” </p><p>Scoffing, Sirius countered, “Too much of a scene for the first day back. Just look at Ruby Greengrass, she’s chomping at the bit to spread some shit to the first person she sees.” </p><p>“I’ll swap with Lily,” offered Peter suddenly. James raised his eyebrows. There was a pause.</p><p>“Can you brew anything without us, Pete?” Sirius asked.</p><p>Peter looked like he wanted to argue, but the truth settled on him. </p><p>“No, no, it was a good idea, Wormtail,” James clapped his friend on the back, sliding off his stool. “I’ll swap with her.” </p><p>At that moment, Lily, Mary, Alice and Marlene entered the dimly lit dungeon classroom, flushed laughing faces faltering as they saw who sat nearest to the door. James hastened his way over until he stood before them.</p><p>“Hi, James,” Alice greeted him overly brightly. </p><p>He nodded to all of them, his eyes flickering to Lily. </p><p>“So, Evans,” He began, urging confidence into his voice. James was all too aware of Snape a few metres away. Lily only responded by eyeing him warily. “I reckon Sirius likes you a little bit too much.” She frowned. “He’s dying to sit with you.”</p><p>James raised his eyebrows pointedly as she continued to look at him in bewilderment.</p><p>“What?” She finally snapped, an edge to her voice. </p><p>“Would you sit with Sirius?” He replied a little too quickly. A few people had looked over, surveying the exchange with beady eyes. James knew Lily would despise that. Word travelled fast after the scene at the lake last June, they’d no doubt love to hear an update. </p><p>Thankfully, Lily’s eyes finally cleared as she understood him. Still, she looked uncertain as she nodded. </p><p>“Um, yeah, I guess I’ll give Sirius a shot,” She attempted a laugh. Brushing past him towards the table where his friends sat smiling - or in Sirius’ case, winking - she muttered. “Thanks, Potter.”</p><p>Determined not to let his gaze linger, he turned back to the remaining three girls. James shot them a winning smile. Mary rolled her eyes. </p><p>“Just you and us now, James,” Marlene waggled her fingers. “Scared?”</p><p>“Now I am,” He confirmed, walking right round the table so that he was able to face Lily and the Marauders. </p><p>Sitting next to him and pulling out her parchment, Alice smiled gratefully. </p><p>“That was kind, thank you.”</p><p>“I hate that prick,” He said in return. “I feel like I can smell him.”</p><p>“That’s the stench of regret,” Marlene added helpfully. </p><p>“Throwing slurs around will do that to you,” joined in Mary, a spiteful edge to her tone. Marlene rested a hand on her friend’s wrist. “Do you want to swap, too, Mare?” James blinked. It was the most gentle he had ever heard McKinnon speak.</p><p>Mary shook her head minutely, and James kicked himself for not thinking about her, too. Though not the target of Snape’s verbal attack, Mary must have felt  just as vulnerable as Lily to hear the word. The ease and anger with which he said it. </p><p>Thinking quickly, he said, “Hey, Macdonald, I heard Fenwick is single again,” James winked. Her face transformed and she blushed. </p><p>“So?” She refused to look at him, but her smile was obvious. Marlene shot James an odd look for a heartbeat, then it was gone, replaced by a teasing expression. </p><p>Professor Slughorn finally made his appearance, making the usual rounds to his favourite students before beginning the lesson. After last night’s incident, James was not surprised to be passed by. </p><p>Naturally, James had to enlist Alice’s assistance during the lesson due to his troublesome habit of watching Lily work with Remus across the room, when she smacked Sirius’ hand away from her cauldron with a practiced annoyance and gently corrected the amount of stirs Peter gave his potion. </p><p>

</p><p>Seeing Severus was strange. </p><p>Not in the way that Lily was expecting. </p><p>No, Lily had presumed she would feel a stab of melancholy when she saw her old friend again, but all she felt was a bitterness that she could taste in the back of her throat. She could not mourn a friendship when she was so busy kicking herself for thinking that what they shared <em> was </em>a friendship. As if him ‘overlooking’ her blood status could be considered an act of kindness. An act of love.</p><p>He was the first to depart the classroom when Potions ended and Lily was glad of it. Her mood had been surprisingly improved by terrible jokes from Sirius.</p><p>Merlin, she was getting soft. </p><p>“Summer’s bloody over, isn’t it?” Marlene sighed as they all left the dungeon, casting a crestfallen eye over the sheets of homework given to them. </p><p>Sirius slung an arm over her shoulder. “Homework is the price you pay for being in my presence again.”</p><p>“Bugger off, then.” </p><p>Lily laughed with the others as they made their winding way back up to Gryffindor tower. Against her better judgment, she noticed that Potter had grown suspiciously quiet once more, and she surprised herself even more by falling into step with him. </p><p>“All right, Evans?” He acknowledged, hands in pockets. </p><p>She marvelled at his nonchalance. Six months ago he had defaced the Entrance Hall with magical sticky slime reading ‘FANCY A DATE, EVANS? BECAUSE I FANCY YOU’. </p><p>Lily bit her cheek at the memory. “All right, Potter.”</p><p>When she chanced a look at him, he was smiling slightly. </p><p>“It’s good to be back,” She added sincerely. </p><p>Potter shook his head then, bewildered. “Please stay away from the firewhiskey, Evans.”</p><p>“No promises,” She replied dryly and this time they both hid the small quirks of their mouths. </p><p>Lily realised James had a lovely smile, one that made his eyes dance. </p>
