    <p>It starts when Aunt Petunia gets it into her head that Dudley needs to be more cultured. And what could be more cultured than being able to play the piano?</p><p>Honestly, Harry already knows by this time not to question Aunt Petunia's logic because that way lies only madness... and he's only eight. Dudley, however, has not learned this lesson yet.</p><p>Dudley is used to getting his way and his first lesson bores him to the point of, quite possibly, scarring the piano teacher for life (or teaching her the importance of never returning Petunia Dursley's calls - to-may-to, to-mah-to). He expects this will be the last lesson. When his mother, however, doubles down on her determination that her sweet little Dudders will play beautiful classical music, Dudley throws the most epic of all fits ever.</p><p>The screaming goes on for nearly an hour and Dudley actually gets grounded - for half a day, but still - and in the end Aunt Petunia makes an appointment for Dudley to meet a new teacher the following weekend. Then she presents Dudley with the electronic keyboard that he will be practicing on for half an hour every day or else.</p><p>Huddled in his cupboard, watching through the slats, Harry is amused. But also a little curious. It's easy for him to sneak out in the middle of the night and nick a piano primer from the stack of books that Dudley had ripped up. The pages are, mostly, salvageable with clear packing tape and the keyboard itself is easily accessed in the living, the sound piped through headphones so that only Harry can hear himself play at midnight, tapping out, hesitantly at first, the notes of 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star'.</p><p>The music is addictive and sneaking out to play becomes a nightly thing.</p><p>One night, however, Harry gets caught by Dudley, who is sneaking downstairs to get a midnight snack. There's a bit of a standoff as the two stare at each other and each tries to figure out how to use this new information to their advantage.</p><p>Harry wants music lessons. Dudley wants not to take music lessons. Suffice it to say, they find themselves arranging an accord.</p><p>Harry starts 'tagging along' on the piano lessons. Which Petunia isn't thrilled about, but if it gets Harry out of her hair a few times a week then she's fine with that. The duo walk down the street to the teacher's house - a retired music teacher who gives lessons out of her home - and Petunia rarely ever goes with them.</p><p>Petunia thinks the lessons go something like this: Dudley learns to play with the grace of a prodigy and Harry does homework or twiddles his thumbs in envy in the back. What actually happens is more like this: Harry learns to play with the diligence of someone who understands repetition trains muscle memory and music is joy in audible form and Dudley usually does his homework, but also learns how to play very basic melodies and chord progressions. Harry learns from workbooks labeled Hanon and song sheets with sonatinas and Dudley eventually learns enough to play pop music from fake books.</p><p>So when Aunt Petunia asks Dudley to play for her, he plays for her slightly halting renditions of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' and 'All For Love'. Later that night, when everyone else has gone to bed, Harry practices 'The Entertainer', 'Fur Elize', and one of Chopin's Etude's. They're mostly flawless and he's so pleased. But his fingers itch not to just play the classics. He wants to create something new.</p><p>Harry starts hoarding paper, carefully stenciling out lines of the musical staff and drawing out the notes that match the songs in his head and fingertips. The first time he played an original piece for his teacher, she praised him for his ingenuity and then asked him about fingering choices and note selection. By the end of the lesson Harry had a new variation of his song written out after the original and homework to create a new song based on one he'd already learned by taking the basic melody and creating something new.</p><p>Harry came back to her a week later with two songs and the start of a third.</p><p>Unfortunately it was about this time that Harry's letters from Hogwarts start coming in and after a hasty trip to a cabin on the sea - Harry spending his birthday tapping out a melody on keys drawn in the dust, more seen and heard with his imagination than his actual senses - Harry winds up with a bedroom instead of a cupboard and is headed for boarding school instead of public school. Its a mixed bag in that Harry is looking forward to getting away from the Dursleys, but... it means leaving his music behind. Hagrid was cagey about the music educations options at Hogwarts - something about a frog choir? - and Harry is pretty sure that he's going to have to go out of his way to find either a piano or a suitable substitute that will actually work at Hogwarts.</p><p>He's fairly certain he won't get away with smuggling in the keyboard.</p><p>His teacher buys him a huge stack of piano books as a goodbye present. She makes him promise to come visit her first thing in the summer to play all his new music for her. She gives him homework too; specific pieces to learn and due dates and which ones she wants him to write variations for. She isn't worried that Harry will shirk his practice. She knows by now just how much he loves music.</p>
<hr/><p>At Hogwarts, the hat considers Slytherin. Not for fuzzy, nebulous reasons, but concrete, ambitious child wants to be a composer one day reasons and cunning child has worked to gain the tools necessary to take the first steps towards that goal reasons.</p><p>Harry isn't comfortable going into a house with a bully.  He still sat with Ron on the train ride to school, after all, and even before that met Malfoy at Madam Malkins, but... just because Malfoy is an awful git doesn't mean all the others will be that way too.  He knows how people make judgements about him based on his Aunts gossip that aren't true; Harry doesn't want to make snap decisions about an entire House of people based on one brat and gossip. So Harry lets the Hat do what it thinks is best and when the hat shouts SLYTHERIN there's a dead silence.</p><p>While its annoying, Harry would rather be applauded for his music and not for what a hat on his head happened to scream loudly anyway, so Harry joins the Slytherin table. He largely ignores Malfoy, but hits it off with Blaise well enough.</p><p>Snape has no idea of what to make of any of this and resolves to just... ignore Harry's existence as best he can. This resolution doesn't last long because his most unwanted student stays after the first Gryffindor/Slytherin class of the year, asking about pianos. Severus has no idea if there are any pianos in the castle, but maybe Professor Flitwick knows? He runs the frog choir.</p><p>Harry is polite in thanking Snape for his time and wanders off to Flitwick's office to try again. Snape subtly - or not-so-subtly - follows along to try and figure out what the little Potter is up to.</p><p>Meanwhile, Harry is... a little frustrated. Because Flitwick says he knows where a piano is, but the first thing Harry is brought to is not a piano. It's a harpsichord. Harpsichords are pretty, but they're not pianos. The sound is all wrong. Harry will make due if he has to, but...</p><p>Flitwick's second try is an organ. Harry wants to weep; this is worse than the harpsichord. It's an entirely different skill set.</p><p>But third try is indeed the charm. Harry finds himself in front of an old grand piano, made of water damaged mahogany wood with a cherry stain, chipped ivory keys, and so badly out of tune that Harry wants to shout at whoever let this beautiful instrument fall into such awful disrepair. Still, it's a piano and he nearly cries in relief as he runs his fingers gently over the keys and plays several songs that are barely recognizable in the piano's current state. Some of the keys are so broken that pressing them doesn't even produce a sound anymore.</p><p>But its a piano and it can be fixed.</p><p>Reparo is a first year spell and Harry finds it quickly enough, learning it early with Flitwick after classes that first week. With that spell, used over and over again, he repairs the piano's chipped keys and warped wood and strings and while the piano still isn't in tune, it no longer looks like a wreck and all the keys produce sounds. It's a start.</p><p>Tuning the piano, however, is not as simple and Harry ventures into the library for that. And gets lost. He asks Madame Pince for help because the Wizarding Library doesn't use the Dewey Decimal system. She sniffs at him because she's an awful librarian who probably should not be allowed to manage a library meant for children and Harry goes to Professor Snape for help again.</p><p>Snape shows Harry a book on wizarding cataloging systems and Harry uses that to locate books on music related magic. It's also when Snape acknowledges that apparently the only thing Harry really cares about is playing the piano.  While Harry is getting decent grades in all his classes, the only time Snape sees any passion in the boy is when it comes to music.  It's a passion Severus recognizes because its one he himself feels for potions making.  And, with Potter in his House, Severus has been forced to see, time and again, that there's no cruelty or malice in Harry the way there was with James.</p><p>Despite himself, Severus finally begins to let old grudges go and old hurts heal and takes the first steps towards becoming a better professor to his students.</p>
<hr/><p>Throughout all of this, Harry has basically been confuzzling his fellow snakes and certain nosy Gryffindors who don't get Harry's obsession with the piano. It sounds awful when he plays, but he keeps at it.  All the while the other students wonder if fixing it really worth the effort when they could be playing gobstones or pranking students from other houses or...</p><p>Harry finds the spell to tune the piano, however, and convinces Professor Flitwick to tune the piano for him, as its a charm. In return, Harry agrees to play the piano to accompany the Frog Choir.  The choir meets once every two weeks, more when a performance is coming up, and the piano room becomes the new meeting place.</p><p>The first time Harry plays the tuned piano and sweet, beautiful tones come flowing out, the students 180 their opinions. This is beautiful, beautiful music and Harry was right to pursue the piano's repair.</p><p>(There might have been tears, but no one speaks of those due to mutual blackmail. It's a Slytherin thing.)</p><p>Harry has a tendency to be late for curfew after this, playing the piano and generally getting lost in the music. The Prefects give up on taking points after the first few times this happens and just escort him back to his common room every time. And they make requests.</p><p>He learns to play Zombie by the Cranberries and various popular muggle rock songs. He learns some more jazz pieces and even writes a few because he likes the freedom it gives him to improvise and make every performance a little different.  He starts gaining a new appreciation for fake books, which let give him interesting melodies and the freedom to do as he likes with them.  Harry's musical style starts being influenced by more than just the classics and his creations begin taking on more and more of his personality.</p><p>Harry learns to love flying, though not as much as the piano.  He does not join the team, but writes piece after piece trying to catch the joy of flight within the joy of music.  He ends up composing a few Quidditch fight songs too.</p><p>Draco Malfoy is a frequent listener, once he moves past the slight on the train, and is often found in the piano room doing his homework. There's a tense truce in there between him and Neville Longbottom and Hermione Granger, who both also like studying to the sound of Harry practicing the piano.</p>
<hr/><p>Dumbledore doesn't know what to make of this. His golden boy is not a Gryffindor, his grumpy potions master is starting to mellow (very, very slightly), inter-house relations between the Slytherins and other houses are improving for the first time in decades... he gives back the Potter family invisibility cloak in hopes of pushing Harry into the School Mystery that Harry has largely ignored so far.  (The troll in the dungeon event occurred, but the Slytherins stayed in the Great Hall because they live in the dungeons.  Hermione was rescued by Neville and Ron, with Neville demonstrating exactly why he was in Gryffindor as he brow beat Ron into taking responsibility for the results of his bullying and saved the only student in their House who was consistently kind to Neville and helped tutor him, even if she was somewhat impatient about it at times.)</p><p>Harry uses the cloak a few times over the holiday break - mostly for practicing the piano longer in the evenings and once for a silly prank on Blaise, who was the only one he shared the secret of the cloak with - and then it goes into the bottom of his trunk where, hopefully, no snoopy neighbors will pay attention to what looks like a ragged old cloak and not the treasure it absolutely is.</p><p>For Christmas, Harry sends some of his new compositions to his piano teacher and tells her about the harpsichord, which he's decided he wants to learn how to play as well.  She sends him, in return, music that should sound nice on the harpsichord.  (Including, of course, the <em>Addams Family Theme</em>.)</p><p>Harry does not, however, take an interest in the School Mystery that Dumbledore set up for him.  Hagrid's dragon is taken care of quite neatly with Professor McGonagall's help and the mention of the three-headed dog goes ignored.  Harry never runs into the Mirror of Erised and, if he had, he'd have seen himself performing an original composition on stage.  If there are any murder attempts by Voldemort or Quirrell, Harry never notices a thing.  There's no research into Nicolus Flamel.  There's no suspicion that Snape is anything other than a grumpy professor who'd made questionable career choices when it came to personal happiness.</p><p>Towards the end of the year, Quirrell fails to retrieve the stone because Dumbledore's trick with the mirror delayed him until actual adults could show up. The professors did more than set up cheap tricks to pass by; they added actual alarms and they all went running as Quirrell tripped the ones he didn't know about. Harry is nowhere to be found near the third floor corridor; he's in his piano room the whole time, playing for the upper years who need to calm down due to OWLs and NEWTs.</p><p>The year ends with Harry having improved his piano playing greatly and having discovered a new love for the harpsichord as well.  (Though the piano comes first in his heart and gets most of his attention as a result.)  While he's not happy about returning to the Dursley's home, he's quite excited to be reunited with his teacher.</p>
