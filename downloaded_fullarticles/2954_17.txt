<p>In the fic <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/10404927/chapters/22976058" rel="nofollow">Harry Potter and the Shadowed Light</a> by <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/Itshannieee/pseuds/Itshannieee" rel="nofollow">Itshannieee</a> Harry looks more like Lily than James and was blood adopted by Sirius, so his appearance is somewhat different. I tried to draw him kind of as a mix between what I usually draw Harry like and how he’s described in the fic.<br/> Also I used <a href="https://myrkky.tumblr.com/post/173111044061/harry-potter-in-some-hogwarts-robes-i-designed" rel="nofollow">the design for Hogwarts robes I made earlier</a>. <br/> (I was imagining Harry as a second year when drawing this)</p>

<p>This was supposed to be young Tom Riddle (”call me Marvolo”) after Harry brings him back, but in the fic he looks to be in his early 20s but in this he looks more like 16-18, so maybe it’s him around the time he made his first horcrux. </p>
