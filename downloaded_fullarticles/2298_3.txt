    <p> </p><p>When she woke up on that particular Wednesday morning, Sabrina had no idea that this day was going to pretty much change her life. Everything had gone like it used to; waking up, getting dressed, meeting Rory in the common room and going to breakfast together, going to class, eating lunch and back in class again, then doing homework and going to bed. This was pretty much every single Hogwarts student’s average routine, with the occasional Quidditch practice thrown in the mix for some people. Since it was mid-November, everybody had already smoothly flown into it so to think that something would disturb this routine, was unheard of, at least for Sabrina.</p><p>“Did you hear that Claflin hit his head at practice last night and is now concussed?”</p><p>“Really?” Sabrina asked, putting her last piece of toast into her mouth. “Is he gonna be okay till Saturday?” she turned to Rory in concern and realised from his expression what the answer was going to be.</p><p>“No idea, Madam Pomfrey wouldn’t let us see him but we doubt it. We do have a stand-in, Archer, thank god, but you know she isn’t... she isn’t Claflin.”</p><p>“I doubt she’s going to be any good against that Vaughn oaf.” he added after a short pause.</p><p>“Hey,” said Sabrina, running her hand down his back soothingly as Rory let out a long designated sigh, “Nothing’s lost yet, there’s no telling what’ll happen.”</p><p>“I know but it’s Slytherin and you know we’ve never won against them.”</p><p>“You just might this time.” she replied, flashing her boyfriend an encouraging smile. He exhaled exhaustingly but Sabrina spotted that his lips had curled upwards slightly which was enough for her to know that he believed her for the time being.</p><p>Realistically, Sabrina was aware that the Slytherin team was infamous for taking a big toll on any house’s Quidditch team, not necessarily because they were better players but because of their enormous competitive streak that quite often manifests itself in extreme violence. Hufflepuffs however were mostly really just in it for the joy of the game yet that didn’t mean it didn’t sting whenever they lost. But Sabrina remained optimistic, not only for Rory’s and her house’s sake but because she genuinely belived the team’s hard work and weeks-long preparation would pay off one day.</p><p>The morning classes went as normally as Hogwarts can get. In History of Magic which they shared with the Slytherins, Mary Wellington, one of Sabrina’s closest friends, clapped Rory hard on the back as she passed by him and grinned: “So Smith, ready to get your lanky ass kicked on Saturday?”</p><p>This of course only made Rory more forlorn than he already was which caused Sabrina to shoot her friend an exasperated look: “Thanks, Mary” but Mary only grinned wider. It was common knowledge to everybody that Mary wasn’t actually particularly fond of Quidditch but that didn’t stop her from casually harrassing the opposing team before a match if she had the chance.</p><p>After lunch, they had double potions with the Gryffindors and since her and Rory were sat quite far apart from each other Sabrina had the chance to get her mind off the match and what it would do to him physically and emotionally for a little while. It also helped that she quite enjoyed the subject.</p><p>“Morning, Pritchard.” the voice belonging to the person who loudly plumped himself onto the closest seat greeted her.</p><p>“Morning, Sirius.” she responded, her eyes not leaving her essay as she was completely unfased by the fact that Sirius had said morning despite it being well into the afternoon. “Did you do this?” she asked him as she looked up, gesturing at her parchment.</p><p>“What was it on?” he asked and Sabrina guessed from that that he didn’t.</p><p>“The ingredients used in the Draught of Peace.”</p><p>“Ah, shit.” She only smiled lightly, shook her head and turned back to her essay to check for mistakes one last time.</p><p>The pair had been randomly made potions partners sometime in the middle of fourth year and after realising they worked surprisingly well together they decided to continue this arrangement (which may or may not have included Sirius begging her slightly, as he was aware she must’ve been at least partially responsible for his acceptable grade in the final exam). This is why Sabrina was quite familiar with his academic habits. She would often encourage him to start focusing on work a bit more, even offering him to join her study group a few times but he always declined with a scoff and a wave of his hand. She’d steadily given up though, especially after Remus, who was quite conveniently sat opposite them, told her that it was of no use.</p><p>As everyone handed in their work at the beginning of the lesson, Sabrina saw Sirius lean back on his chair and try to look as inconspicious as possible. Professor Slughorn who was still of good sight and quite frankly used to these kinds of antics, didn’t fail to miss him: “Mister Black, might I ask for your essay, please?”</p><p>Sirius didn’t skip a beat. “No, my dog ate it, Professor.”</p><p>A round of giggles erupted in the dungeon and Remus rolled his eyes at his friend. Slughorn stared motionless, yet with a hint of a smile playing on his lips, at Sirius before letting out an exasperated breath, placing the essays into a drawer and saying: “Make it be twice as long next week.”</p><p>“Seriously, mate?” whispered James to Sirius from his table after Slughorn began his lesson.</p><p>“How the fuck did <em>you</em> do it?” Sirius snapped back, his voice faded with slight annoyance as he was still leaning back on his chair showing no intention of pulling out his ink and notebook just yet.</p><p>“I asked Remus.”</p><p>“Mate!” Sirius groaned, turning to Remus across from him.</p><p>“I didn’t do it <em>for</em> him, I just helped a bit.”</p><p>“And why didn’t you help me?”</p><p>“Because you didn’t ask.”</p><p>That made Sirius groan again as he moved to sit at the table properly and started fetching his supplies out of his backpack. You could see that he was grinning though and Remus was only shaking his head, albeit adoringly.</p><p> </p><p>**</p><p> </p><p>At dinner, Sabrina sat opposite Jackie Liao, another close friend of hers, also a Hufflepuff. They had just been discussing the topic of baking pastries and somehow Christmas had come up.</p><p>“I think I might actually stay at Hogwarts over Christmas this year.”</p><p>“Really? How come?”</p><p>“It’s my mum and dad’s twentieth anniversary and he’s taking her to China but they’ve decided to go the Muggle way since that’s how they met and... yeah. That takes a long while. So we’ll have to stay here.” Jackie shrugged.</p><p>“You could come and stay with us.” Sabrina suggested taking a sip of her tea.</p><p>“Oh really? You want Katie in your house over the holidays?” Jackie raised her eyebrows and gestured across the room toward the Gryffindor table where her little sister sat.</p><p>“No... you’re right.” Sabrina replied and they both laughed. Little Katie Liao, a proud first-year, was probably the most energetic person Sabrina had ever met. She was nice and oftentimes quite endearing but the thought of having her around the house for over a week, where she would probably be rolling on a sugar-high due to all the christmas cookies, wasn’t something Sabrina would consider as a pleasant holiday experience.</p><p>Rory, who sat next to his them, was being uncharacteristically unattentive this evening. The girls didn’t seem to mind much though, subconsciously attributing it to his nervosity of the upcoming match against Slytherin.</p><p>As their conversation switched from christmas, to new year’s to pyrotechnics, he all of a sudden straightened his back and spoke up: “Sabrina, will you walk to practice with me?”</p><p>“Of course,” Sabrina smiled gently “I can even come watch if you want.”</p><p>Rory’s mouth opened as if to say something but he closed it just as quickly, his eyes moving downwards for a moment. He eventually said: “I’ll go get my things.” and made his way out of the Great Hall. He had never asked her to walk with him to practice before but like previously, she attributed his behaviour to his Quidditch-related anxiety. In fact, she quite rejoiced in the fact that he was turning to her for comfort.</p><p>As they met in front of the Great Hall again about fifteen minutes later, Sabrina should’ve known something was up. As she leaned forward to kiss him in greeting, he turned his head so that her lips only brushed his jawline and he let out a small cough. “Let’s go.”</p><p>They walked through the foggy November evening in silence, their path to the pitch illuminated by the castle behind them. Rory didn’t speak, the only interaction to his girlfriend being the occasional soothing brush of his thumb across her hand. Sabrina understood that he maybe just needed some companionable silence but as they were nearing the Quidditch pitch he was getting more fidgety and she had to ask.</p><p>“Rory, are you alr-“</p><p>“I need to talk to you about something.” he breathed, stopping in his tracks and let go of her hand.</p><p>“Sure.” Sabrina smiled at him encouragingly, holding out her hand for him to take it again but he didn’t.</p><p>“It’s uhm... I... It’s complicated.”</p><p>“Okay...” Sabrina dropped her outstretched hand but still kept her smile fixed on him, nudging him to go on. It did feel to odd to her that Rory seemed to have such a problem articulating his feelings right now, as that had never been something incredibly challenging for him.</p><p>“I... Shit.” he cursed, burying his face into one of his hands. This was also extremely odd since Rory hardly ever cursed, which at this moment meant to Sabrina that something must be really wrong. Her heart momentarily sunk at the feeling of there having been something up with her boyfriend and her failing to notice, so she moved forward trying to envelope him in a hug.</p><p>“No, don’t,” Rory cried as he moved her arms away before she could properly reach him, “you’re making this worse.”</p><p>“I’m sorr-“</p><p>“Listen,” he said, his eyes properly meeting hers for the first time that evening Sabrina realised, “we... I think we should break up.”</p><p>Never in a million years did Sabrina think that these were the words he’d say to her in that moment. This is why she did not know how to react and was therefore frozen on the spot.</p><p>Seeing Sabrina’s wordless reaction must’ve spurred something inside him because suddenly his voice became much clearer: “I am so sorry for having to do this to you but... I think it’s the right thing.”</p><p>Rory’s changed demeanor and his growing steadfast gaze on her unfroze her as she breathed: “Wha- Why?”. She was the one choking up on her words now.</p><p>“I...”, Rory said closing his eyes for a minute as if trying to prepare himself for something, “Sabrina, have you ever thought about the fact that we maybe started going out out of necessity?”</p><p>“Out of wha-“</p><p>“That we ended up together just because everyone said we would.”</p><p>He wasn’t letting her finish which sent a tang of annoyance down Sabrina’s gut but in her shocked state she remained quiet and listened.</p><p>“That on that day when we kissed two years ago, we didn’t kiss because we were in love with each other but because both of our families were just counting down the days until we would.”</p><p>Sabrina shook her head, as if to try and make sense of his words. She and Rory had been inseparable pretty much since they were babies, yes. Their mothers had been thick as thieves all through Hogwarts and beyond as they were both Healers in the same department at St. Mungo’s now. They had a double wedding and even managed to get houses about two streets away from each other. To say that Rory and Sabrina hadn’t been thick as thieves just like them would be an understatement. There was not a moment in Sabrina’s life where she’d remember Rory not being around. From them discovering their magic together, to their first times on a broom to reading each other’s Hogwarts acceptance letters, they had always been at each other’s side.</p><p>At family gatherings, which were quite frequent, it was always “Sabrina and Rory this, Sabrina and Rory that.” and it only took the pair going to Hogwarts to make their families start teasing them about being a couple. Like young teenagers typically would, they kept rebutting it with blushing faces and the occasionall stomping of stairs but never so much as to make things weird between them.</p><p>He did have a point. When they kissed under one of the mistletoes on Christmas Eve in their third year it had been the most natural thing in the world. Like everything had fallen into place, like some kind of prophecy.</p><p>Sabrina didn’t understand why that seemed to be an issue though because she had feelings for Rory. Loved him even and probably always had.</p><p>And yet there he was, the most important person in her life, standing in front of her and telling her words she never thought she’d hear. The person she thought would take care of her heart forever, was breaking it.</p><p>The longer Sabrina stood there, open-mouthed, mulling over his statement the more she felt her head spin and she released a breath she didn’t know she was holding. Somehow though her voice was cut short, just like her feet and her eyes were surprisingly glued on the spot.</p><p>Rory gulped, his gaze cast downwards for a second before looking at her again and somehow Sabrina knew that the worst was yet to come.</p><p>“I met someone. At the end of last year.”</p><p>Her expression must have shown a flash of hurt because she swore she saw Rory’s demeanor falter again as he broke out: “Nothing happened though Sabrina, I’m not that kind of person.”</p><p>“Who is she?” Sabrina asked suddenly, her voice finding it’s way back into her throat again although shakingly. She mentally kicked herself in the shin. Out of all the things, all the questions that were whirring through her mind this was the one she asked first?</p><p>Before he could reply though she cut him off: “No actually, don’t answer that.”</p><p>This was when her gaze broke away and focused on a spot somewhere on his yellow Quidditch robe. She had no clue whatsoever as to what to say or even think. All she could feel was her head starting to spin even more from all the questions she wanted to ask but didn’t manage to.</p><p>After a pause, Rory continued. “She’s made me think a lot about... love... and falling <em>in</em> love. On what the difference might be. On what it feels like. I’ve spent the whole of last summer thinking about us and whether what we had is actually true.”</p><p>As if she wasn’t experiencing a lot of emotions all at once, now her stomach also had to make a collateral drop. “Are you saying you... were never in love with me?”</p><p>“That’s what I’m trying to tell you, Sabrina!” Rory snapped, his voice rising into a tone which she had never heard from him before, “How am I supposed to know?! How am I supposed to know when the only love I’ve ever known was fabricated!”</p><p>“<em>Fabricated</em>?” Sabrina gasped.</p><p>This had stung. This had stung so much, her eyes filled up with tears and she had the faint feeling her knees might buckle any second now.</p><p>Apparently, this had stung him too because he tried to backtrack: “I didn’t mean it lik-“</p><p>“Fabricated.” Sabrina repeated, the word sounding more like a shaky breath than anything else. She felt a couple of hot tears make it’s way across her cheeks and she lowered her head again, not wanting to be seen.</p><p>They stood like this for a while, feeling like there was nothing yet everything in the air between them. As Sabrina raised her head she could see from her cloudy vision that Rory was still looking at her and his eyes seemed to be teary now too.</p><p>She had no idea why she said her next words because they were a lie but she spoke them anyway even with the hint of a sad smile on her face:</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Hardly seeing anything through the pool of tears in her eyes, Sabrina didn’t remember much of how she made it back to the castle as she ran back, hoping she wouldn’t hurt herself. Though, she didn’t think anything could ever hurt her more than this.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
