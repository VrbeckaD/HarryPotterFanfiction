<p>They weren’t supposed to be friends; they weren’t supposed to even be talking. But there they were, stalking through the hallway near each other, herded towards the auditorium. He muttered a dry joke and she smiled at it. She returned with her own joke and he retorted. He topped her joke with his own quip and she found herself laughing at this man she was supposed to hate. “Marry me and bear my children,” she murmured. Their eyes met. It was <i>supposed</i> to be another joke.</p>
<p>“You’ll need to work on your phrasing,” he muttered.  “But sure. I mean-”</p>
<p>“I don’t expect you to love me.” Her nakedness surprised her. “But-” </p>
<p>It wasn’t like everyone didn’t know he was gay. But something about his smile was so much <i>better</i> than anything else she’d encountered in this place.  “But we make it through this, marry me.”</p>

They were holding hands when his father stalked towards them, and they were holding hands when they held off the invasion.<br/>And they were holding hands when everyone they knew protested.</p>
<p>“I don’t expect you to love me,” she’d said. She hadn’t said she was already in love with him.</p></div>
