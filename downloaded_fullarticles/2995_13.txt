<p>Sounds of Silence</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>They sat in silence in the gazebo for several minutes until Harry’s eyes began to close. </p>
<p>“Right,” said Draco, jumping up and pulling Harry to his feet. “Let’s get you home before you start snoring.” </p>
<p>“I was awake,” protested Harry as Draco pulled him out into the gardens. “Mostly.”</p>
<p>Draco laughed. “Relax. I’m not upset you’re tired.” He tossed a wink over his shoulder at Harry. “After all, I’m the reason you want to take a nap since I haven’t allowed you much rest this past week.” </p>
<p>Harry grinned at him. “Does this mean you’ll let me sleep tonight?”</p>
<p>“Unlikely.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>They were laughing when they arrived at the Manor, but upon entering, they encountered oppressive silence. </p>
<p>Andromeda, at the opposite end of the room from Narcissa, was frowning. </p>
<p>When no one spoke, Harry cleared his throat. “We’re off. We’ve work to prepare for tomorrow.” </p>
<p>“Of course.” Narcissa stood. “Perhaps you’ll join us for dinner this weekend?” </p>
<p>Eyeing Draco’s closed expression, Harry coughed. “We’ll let you know.” </p>
<p>“Thank you.” Avoiding looking at Draco, Narcissa left the room. </p>
<p>Andromeda sighed. “For what it’s worth, Draco, I don’t blame you for hesitating to move back. Cissy can be…meddlesome.” </p>
<p>Draco smiled faintly. “Indeed.” </p>
