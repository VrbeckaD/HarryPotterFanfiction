    <p>The coat hanged on the nearby chair, the strong scent of coffee, paperwork on the desk of his office… Graves leaned on the desk, almost sitting on it, cup in one hand and the papers in other one. His gaze followed the lines written on it, with a concentration that amazed the man in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>Newt was looking at him with a satisfied smile on his face. Black eyes raised from the paper and glanced at him.</p><p> </p><p>“So, Mr. Scamander,” Graves started and Newt flushed. This voice had <em>that</em> kind of effect on him, and sent <em>that</em> kind of shivers down his spine. “is this one of the beasts you captured recently?” Graves’ eyes darted back to the paper he read earlier for a split second before looking at Newt again.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” He replied with an almost inaudible tone.</p><p> </p><p>“And you want to share your discovery with MACUSA’s mediwizards. Did I understand you properly?” Graves put the cup and the papers down on the table and crossed his arms on the broad chest. Newt gulped as he watched his muscles flex and the fabric of the shirt hug his upper body in all the right places.</p><p> </p><p>“Y-yes.” Newt stuttered and glanced to the side, hiding his eyes from the other man “I would be happy if my research will help to improve medicine and save lives.” His hands were sweaty, and he fidgeted hopelessly, still trying to avoid looking directly at Graves’ face.</p><p> </p><p>Graves sighed and shifted from his spot. When Newt finally gathered the courage to look at him again, Graves already was sitting at his desk and signing Newt’s papers.</p><p> </p><p>Newt caught himself staring at the other man again. Graves had a little frown on his handsome face, some strands of his black hair fell over his forehead and his hand was moving smoothly as he wrote. Newt inhaled sharply as his heartbeat picked up its pace. He felt his face grow hotter by every passing second and the way Graves smiled at him while handing the papers didn’t do anything useful to stop his fast heart-beating.</p><p> </p><p>“T-thank you, Mr. Graves.” Newt said and took the papers in his trembling hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Scamander.”</p><p> </p><p>Newt jumped on his spot at the mention of his name and looked into those black, beautiful eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it, Mr. Graves?”</p><p> </p><p>Did he observe how Newt stared at him? He didn’t, did he?</p><p> </p><p>Another sigh escaped those lips and Newt had the urge to gulp again “Why are you acting like that? Does my presence make you uncomfortable that much that you refuse to look at me when I talk to you?”</p><p> </p><p>Newt blinked. Graves thought he was uncomfortable around him? Perhaps, he was partially true, because Newt felt his body reacting in some wrong (good) way to the other man. And not only his body, but mind as well. He felt happy by just being around Graves.</p><p> </p><p> The corners of his lips involuntarily turned up as he tried to hold back a chuckle. “No, it’s not that.” Newt shook his head, feeling his heart slow down a bit. He felt warmth spread in his chest, and it was a wonderful feeling, something he would like to experience over and over again. “I’d say…” he trailed off, his smile turning somehow into a small smirk “it’s totally the opposite.”</p><p> </p><p>He watched as Graves’ face softened and body relaxed in his seat. “Good.” Graves murmured, his eyes looking directly into Newt’s as he repeated “Very good.”</p><p> </p><p>Newt flushed and tried to break the eye-contact, to look away from those enchanting eyes which he wanted to look at him and him only, but just couldn’t. There were too many feelings boiling inside of him at the moment, it was hard to breathe. Oh, he forgot how to breathe for a moment here.</p><p> </p><p>Graves didn’t look away as well, even as he stood up and approached the young wizard.</p><p> </p><p>Watching Graves move, walk, speak, smile was something Newt didn’t get tired of, something he couldn’t get enough even. He observed every movement of his limbs as that approached him and almost melted when that hand touched his cheek. His heart was beating loudly, it almost felt like it will jump out of his chest.</p><p> </p><p>Graves’ hand was calloused, but warm and the touch was so gentle, that Newt forgot how to breathe all over again.</p><p> </p><p>Black eyes were half-lidded as their owner’s face leaned closer to Newt’s. The redhead gasped for air and Graves took advantage of that to tongue-kiss him right away.</p><p> </p><p>Newt felt his legs give in as that skillful tongue explored his mouth in the most shameless way. Open-mouthed, dirty even, lips sucking at his own, teeth nibbling and biting greedily. Graves’ hand gripped the back of his neck, fingers tangling in his hair. Newt kissed back, shyly moving his lips against others as his arms clutched desperately at Graves’ shirt. He was out of breath, but didn’t want this to stop. Never.</p><p> </p><p>But eventually, they broke the kiss and both panted, hot breaths mixing as their faces were just inches away from each other.</p><p> </p><p>“You thought I won’t notice the way you look at me, Scamander?” Graves chuckled low at the way Newt’s blush expanded to his neck and ears. He ran a hand through redhead’s locks, and hummed appreciatively. “I wonder though…” Graves said, his voice just a bit above a whisper as he leaned close to Newt’s ear, his breath ghosting on redhead’s skin “did you notice how I look at you?”</p>
