          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harriet scowled down at the books in front of her. She had been studying for the best part of the day. It was nearing nine o’clock. Hermione was badgering her about exams coming. They were graduating college in a few months time and exams were getting closer. Harriet’s first one was two weeks away whereas Hermione’s first was two days ago. Ron had three weeks until his first.</p><p>She turned to Ron. “Can you turn that down? It’s really distracting.”</p><p>Ron was watching Frozen. He huffed and turned the volume down. Hermione was huffing at him since he was supposed to be studying. Honestly, if they weren’t dating people wouldn’t see why they hung out...</p><p>People didn’t see why they were dating. They were nothing alike.</p><p>Harriet sighed and pushed away from the table. “Fuck it! I’m done.”</p><p>Lily called from the other room. “Language Harry! I’m heading out to the shops. Want anything?”</p><p>“We’re out of apple juice.”</p><p>“Okay.” There was silence for a few minutes before a door slammed and a few moments later the sound of a car pulling away.</p><p>Harriet sighed and stood up, stretching.</p><p>Hermione frowned. “Harry. Come on. You need to study.”</p><p>“Fuck it all! Fuck it all! I can’t study this anymore! Just... fuck it all! My grades never bothered me anyway! Let my mum shout about it, I don’t give a shit anymore!”</p><p>Ron laughed and paused the DVD. “You know, you could remix that into ‘let it go’. You said ‘fuck it all’ just as Elsa said ‘let it go’.”</p><p>“Rewind.” Harriet smirked. Ron did so and Harriet closed her eyes, listening to the music. She wasn’t majoring in music for nothing.</p><p>“<em>The clock ticks by to fast this time, not a moment to be lost.</em><br/>
<em>A set of books around me and it looks like it’s the day.</em><br/>
<em>Finals are coming and we all must try our best,</em><br/>
<em>But I’ve given up, I’ll just wing that test.</em><br/>
<em>No fun today, no fun at all</em><br/>
<em>No more talking on the telephone!</em><br/>
<em>Read this, write that and learn it all,</em><br/>
<em>Can’t learn it all!</em></p><p><em>Fuck it all,</em><br/>
<em>Fuck it all!</em><br/>
<em>Can’t study this anymore!</em><br/>
<em>Fuck it all,</em><br/>
<em>Fuck it all!</em><br/>
<em>All my classes are a bore.</em><br/>
<em>I don’t care if I fail this test.</em><br/>
<em>Let my mum rage on.</em><br/>
<em>My grades never bothered me anyway.</em>”</p><p>Harriet smirked and closed her books.</p><p>“<em>It’s funny how some paper, makes everything seem dull,</em><br/>
<em>And the classes that once drove me, can’t excite me at all!</em><br/>
<em>I’ve had enough, I’m done with this.</em><br/>
<em>Won’t let my teachers take the piss.</em><br/>
<em>I’ll wing those tests, then finally,</em><br/>
<em>I’m Free!</em></p><p><em>Fuck it all,</em><br/>
<em>Fuck it all!</em><br/>
<em>I’ll just wing it all the way,</em><br/>
<em>Fuck it all,</em><br/>
<em>Fuck it all!</em><br/>
<em>It’s not tricky anyway,</em><br/>
<em>Make a stand, don’t care what they say!</em><br/>
<em>I don’t give a fuck!</em>”</p><p>Ron was holding back peals of laughter and Hermione was scowling. She was rather against swearing and anyone who said something was more important than studying.</p><p>“<em>Those textbooks filled with info swirling 'round my head.</em><br/>
<em>I’ve had enough, I want to go and curl up in my bed.</em><br/>
<em>But all these tests are getting nearer by the day. I just don’t give a fuck.</em><br/>
<em>I’ll ace them anyway!</em></p><p><em>Fuck it all,</em><br/>
<em>Fuck it all!</em><br/>
<em>Don’t give a shit anymore!</em><br/>
<em>Fuck it all,</em><br/>
<em>Fuck it all!</em><br/>
<em>Flip the table! Screw you all!</em><br/>
<em>I won’t take this bullshit anymore!</em><br/>
<em>I don’t give a fuck!</em><br/>
<em>My grades never bothered me anyway.</em>”</p><p>Harriet, Ron and Hermione looked at each other for a few moments before the three of them burst into laughter.</p><p>They didn’t get any studying done that day.</p></div>
