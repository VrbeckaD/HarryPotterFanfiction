  <span>Thor sits beside his wife of 300 years stunned by the Healer’s pronouncement. Loki merely blinks once before fainting in his arms. Cradling his beloved in his arms, they rush to the Healing Rooms. Thor is beyond thankful that his mother’s midwife Eir is still Asgard’s Head Healer despite his father wishes. If she was not he would be calling for her and reinstating her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Loki slowly regains consciousness and brings a hand to her lower body. Hesitantly, she releases a small amount of her seiðr and groans at the truth of Eir’s claim. She turns to glare at Thor having felt his presence re-enter the healing chambers alongside his mother. “How could I have conceived? I took contraceptive potions and performed the spells!” she demands of him before moving the blankets to cover her royal blue female Jotun form self-consciously. “Not to mention I was in my male Aesir form and most certainly not meant to be fertile!” she continues only to be interrupted by Eir’s deliberate cough. Eir looks as much the scolding mother as opposed to her normal doting self at her words. “You forget, Highness, that His Majesty is a fertility god.” Thor and Loki both blink in surprise before turning to look to Queen Freya for confirmation. Queen Freya looks between them in an assessing manor before rolling her eyes. “What Lady Eir has said is correct. Perhaps this will convince you to both into taking your studies and roles as Gods and royalty more seriously. Odin knows our worshipers are few and far between even on Midgard where you both claim to frequent so often.”</span>
</p>
<p><span>Loki sighs as she falls back into the bed that night.</span> <span>‘I have memorized half of the Asgards royal library in the time I have been here. I long ago memorized all of Jotunheim’s and Vanaheim’s vast libraries and am kept continuously updated on new arrivals. I have multiple families who live as my loyal worshipers across 29 of the realms. I am </span><b>the</b><span> master sorceress and sorcerer out of 21 realms and a highly feared warrior known across 40 of the 55 known realms. Currently, I am a high priestess, healer, and Queen in training. After all of that, I am now being accused of slacking in my duties because my husband, Prince of nine realms to my twelve, temporarily forgot one of his affinity’s? If he was not my soulmate- No even then I would no sooner leave his side. I will happily die by his side when the time comes. After ending whatever took him from me of course. If only our families were not so disgusted by our union that they expect so much from us in return.’ she moves so she can curl tighter in her husband's hold as she ponders the legitimacy of Frigga's accusation.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Unknown to Loki she is mistakenly projecting her thoughts to Thor. He has grown accustomed to his wife’s bouts of deep thought. It is during her deeper thoughts that he truly hears her uncensored speech. While the occurrences are rare he treasures them dearly no matter the subject. On this night he lays with her contemplating her unspoken words. He too feels as though they are being wrongfully punished for the blessing that is their soul marks. As such a blessing cannot be punished for it is a gift from Gods of higher status than even they, not even Odin dared to speak out against it when he found his soulmate on the battlefield.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Though both the Allfather and Allmother make many passing remarks disguised as jesting, Thor easily remembers how his parents met in much the same fashion during the war between Vanaheim and Asgard. His mother is the daughter of a peasant craftsman so poor at his craft he had not even a feast nor a dowry to offer. Should his parents ever try anything stronger than a jest he will easily remind them how Vanaheim and Midgard are now inaccessible to both them as well as their armies and how that came to be. All facts they work to hide as they are the currently reigning King and Queen of Asgard. Should the need arise he will take the throne by force. He is far stronger than he pretends and he knows the same is true of his wife. Meanwhile the Allfather and Allmother tire easily. Such was true even before they reached their great age. In their youth, they could fight for four days with rest while he can fight for weeks without and feel no fatigue. He does not wish a war nor another argument but should a war need be fought he will lead one risking even banishment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Loki is crouched over a basin, bemoaning her fate.  She stares into the basins filth once more before vomiting once again. Her unborn son has awoken her once again with his fierce movements. She’s preparing her sedir to cleanse her hands, hair, and face when she is forced to grip the sides of the basin as another contraction hits. As she regains her breath, she massages her child through her skin feeling his anguish echo through her. “What fate waits for you, my child? Why must you torment me so for unwittingly bringing it to you?” A second stab of pain makes her cry out as another image of her son’s future fills her vision. They have been near constant for the past three weeks. “Loki!” Thor’s shouts in alarm from within their connected bedchambers. Not a moment later said Prince lumbers into the bathing rooms. “What has happened?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I should perhaps see the Healer. Our child may wish to present himself this day.” She responds sarcastically gesturing to the floor where her water has broken. Thor curses and gently wraps his arm around her waist. Together, they slowly hobble their way to the Healing chambers. Once there one of the new healers tries to force an unamused and unmoving Thor into a chair as Lady Eir looks Princess Loki over. Lady Eir announces that the new Prince will indeed be born and soon as the healer bothering Thor throws his hands up in defeat and walks away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Loki cries out, her hair spilling down her back as she continues to push. “I swear on your father's throne Thor I-!” *AghHH*</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just a few more my Queen.” Ladi Eir praises.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Queen?!” Loki asks nearly sitting up in her panic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lady Eir merely jests my love. You are no more a Queen at this time then I am King.” Prince Thor assures tightening his grip on his wife's hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh thank the Norns.” Princess Loki sighs leaning back on her folded arms and giving another push.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can see our son’s head!” Thor shouts joyously.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just one more strong push should do the trick, your majesty.” Lady Eir instructs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Another?!” she demands out of breath before giving it all her might and slowly releasing Thor's now fractured hand before squeezing it once more. She spares Thor an alarmed look upon the silence but both their faces breakout into wide exuberant smiles upon the child's sharp cry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What of his name?” Lady Eir asks looking between the two.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hákon Faolan Silvertongue son of Thor and Loki.”  Loki responds as Thor replies “Hadrian Haraldr Thorson son of Thor and Loki.” They look to each other for a long moment in the suddenly silent room before nodding.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He will be Hadrian Hákon Silvertongue, son of Thor and Loki,” Thor responds with a booming authoritative voice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Three names?” Eir asks confused.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It is a Midgardian and Vanaheim tradition that has spread to other realms as of late. He will need a name that represents the changing times he was born into.” Loki responds resolutely in their decision.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Four hours later Thor is having his turn holding their son close to his heart and beaming down at the tiny godling. “He is beautiful, my love.” Loki smiles happily as she beholds father and son. Still, she can’t help but ask “You are certain of his third name?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes,” Thor assures her looking up from to their son. “It is a title you have worked hard to earn,” he states adjusting his grip on their child. “Who am I to deny you your right to pass such a birthright on to our child?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I mean it to share. If-” she grips the quill she’s writing with. “If you wish to- Perhaps we could share the title?” she carefully asks the filling out of the remaining documentation on their child taking most of her concentration.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How do you mean?” Thor asks coming to sit beside her at their desk and allowing little Adrian to rest between them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Perhaps when...we next journey to Midgard, if you would allow, we could use Silvertongue in our name,” she suggests carefully while looking down at the parchment she just completed and re-reading what is written despite knowing she has made no error.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thor smiles widely moving to turn his wife’s face to see into her eyes. “Truly?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Loki carefully observes Thor her neon green eyes narrowed as Thor moves a stray jet-black hair out of her face. “Truly. Together we are heir to more than just Asgard and her colonies. Already together we have complete control of two realms, soon enough we will be crowned more. Simply using Odionson as our surname...it feels wrong somehow. I am no son nor daughter of Odin.” She raises her hand knowing a retort is coming. “He has made as much clear to me Thor.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thor sighs “I am... aware of the faults of the Allfather...of my father. I only wished for you two to bond in some way. I know now that will not happen.” His lightning blue eyes search Loki’s for permission before he leans in for a kiss. Pulling back he looks down at their son a perfect mix of them both. His eyes and hair match that of his mother while his nose and ears match that of his father. When he was first born his skin was a Jotun royal blue however it quickly changed to an Asgardian royalty’s tan. The healers were startled to find his DNA a perfect mixture of the two races. Truly their son is the dawn of a new era. “You are correct as usual. Our son will be heir to Asgard, Vanaheim, Jotunheim, and Midgard not to mention their subsequent territory’s. As mother has said it is time we take our roles as Royal Gods far more seriously."</span>
