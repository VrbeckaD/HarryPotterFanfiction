  <span>“Can you guys </span>

    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>steal something for once?” The Flash asked the two villains.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where's the fun in that?” Captain Cold asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I d-” A shot rang out and Captain Cold fell to the ground. “Shit!” Both the Flash and Heatwave ran over to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry had been in the jewelry store when the two entered. They had put the customers off to the side so that none of them were hurt. Seeing the man get shot caused Harry to run over to them. The two villains watched in shock as he pulled the bullet out. He then put his hands above the wound. They glowed a soft blue color and the wound healed. Before they could ask any questions Harry pointed out to the window. Police were outside the door and one of them had pulled the trigger. Harry used the distraction to run off. Cold and Heatwave had done the same. Flash checked on the other hostages before he left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flash had talked with officers on his way. He got the information he was looking for and went to the safe house. He was lucky to see Cold and Heatwave were there. Cold had his parka and shirt off. Both him and Heatwave were inspecting the spot he was shot. Hearing him enter they looked up to see a concerned superhero.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay?” He asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. Kid did an amazing job healing me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Th-that's good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wonder who he is.” Heatwave said before walking off to the other side of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So do I.” Cold said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please don't turn him into a villain.” Flash pleaded with him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No promises kid.” The thief smirked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knew it.” Flash sighed. “I'm glad you’re fine.” He ran off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That's surprising. I would have thought the hero would have put up more of a fight.” Heatwave said as he fiddled with his gun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me too.”</span>

</p><p>
  <span>“Hayden? You here?” Barry called out after he shut the door behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Y-Yeah.” The black haired meta walked out of the bathroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You okay?” He asked as he walked over to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I'm sorry.” He teared up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For what?” Barry asked in confusion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For using my powers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry… Wells/Thawne is gone. You may use your powers without fear he will find you.” He reassured his boyfriend. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“T-True.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Barry smiled as he hugged Hayden. Hayden snuggled into his embrace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Better?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.”</span>
