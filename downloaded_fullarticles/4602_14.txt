          <div class="userstuff"><p>Technically speaking, Lee Jordan was a prince.</p><p>Okay, yeah, he was illegitimate.</p><p>And alright, so was his father.</p><p>But still, prince.</p>
<hr/><p>The origin story was roughly this:</p><p>Louise Jordan was visited by a god called Hermóðr for a couple of months.</p><p>The two of them do the horizontal tango far more than once.</p><p>Lee was the result.</p>
<hr/><p>It was only at Hogwarts that Lee became aware that his father having an actual presence in his life was considered odd for a demigod. That was the point where he realized that he was one of the lucky ones, as he also lacked the typical near-death experiences that the average demigod has. It's the time when he realized just how unfair the cards are that the fates deal most demigods.</p><p>But it’s alright because once he knew about the issue, he could run with it. Figure out a way to make things better, or at the very least, less bad.</p><p>He sent messages to his mom — because messages were kind of what he did — asking her if she was fine taking homeless demigods in or if not knew anyone who would. She didn’t have a problem with it, provided that the visitors have some level of politeness and tact.</p><p>And that was how some of Lee's cousins — and later on some distant relatives from other pantheons — became his siblings.</p>
<hr/><p>Oh, yeah, Lee was far from the only demigod at Hogwarts.</p><p>It didn’t take him long to notice it and he started sending messages about meeting at a certain time at a certain place, because he figured that connecting cannot possibly be a bad thing, right?</p><p>He was told that there already are meetings but that he’s more than welcome to join.</p>
<hr/><p>No one in that group realizes that they — the Norse — aren’t the only ones for a while.</p><p>It’s Lee who figures it out. When he is in his second year, but still better than the others.</p><p>(<em>Maybe people knew it once and the knowledge got lost</em>, the children of wisdom would point out, but he didn’t care about that.)</p><p>The Greeks and Romans — separate groups and the clarification was definitely necessary — were the easiest to find, so he sent them a message because sending messages is what he does best.</p><p>They accept and their group grows.</p><p>It didn’t stop there.</p>
<hr/><p>Lee’s talent for messages is inherited from his father.</p><p>Hermóðr, a son of Odin, is the god — or rather one of the gods — of messages, so it is kind of a given that he’s good at it.</p><p>And Lee inherited it. He was actually rather proud of it.</p><p>Because here’s the thing that a whole lot of people don’t realize: messages and getting them delivered from one person to another both secretly and correctly is pretty damn important.</p><p>It can mean the difference between winning or losing, between winning or dying in certain circumstances and just because they aren’t in one such situation now that doesn’t mean that they will never be.</p><p>Just sayin’.</p></div>
