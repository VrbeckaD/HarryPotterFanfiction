    <i>“The moon is a loyal companion. It never leaves. It’s always there, watching, steadfast, knowing us in our light and dark moments, changing forever just as we do. Every day it’s a different version of itself. Sometimes weak and wan, sometimes strong and full of light. The moon understands what it means to be human. Uncertain. Alone. <b>Cratered by imperfections</b>.”<br/>

</center><p>It was a lovely day in Hogwarts; the sun was shining, O.W.L.s were over, and all that was left for the students to worry about were the plans for the Summer holidays. The sound of laughter rang free on the grounds, and the excitement and relief of another school year coming to an end pervaded the air. Standing at the top of the Astronomy Tower, Remus Lupin felt alone in his despair and wished, not for the first time in his young life, that he could for once be as normal as everyone else.</p><p>Remus was cursed, his own core forever changed one night when he was barely five years old. His nature, his whole being, set him apart from everyone else, and more than 10 years of having his body torn apart by the wolf made sure that his appearance would also forever bare the distance between Remus and ‘normal’. He knew that, he’d heard his parents say that to him, kindly but firmly, for almost his whole life, and he’d long since resigned himself to a solitary life. Coming to Hogwarts had changed that, and Remus found himself with not just one but three wonderful friends who accepted him, cared for him, made him one of their own. </p><p>Remus had stupidly relaxed into it, he had believed, and now everything had come to an end. Ever since the day he’d entered a compartment on the Hogwarts Express where two boys were laughing about something or someone by the name of ‘Snivellus’, and sat down with them, Remus’s life had taken a turn he’d never would have known how to hope for. Being sorted into Gryffindor, in the same dormitory as the two boys he’d tentatively fraternized with on the train, and later befriending the third occupant of the room too, had been a strike of luck the likes of which Remus had not known could happen to a person, let alone someone like himself.</p><p>If anything though, all of this had strengthened his determination to keep his secret hidden because now Remus had even more to lose by his lycanthropy being discovered. Unfortunately, his feeble excuses and his avoidance could only help Remus so far when two out of three of his newly-found best friends had been the brightest in the entire school. It was obviously just a matter of time before they’d figure out what exactly happened when Remus disappeared once a month only to come back looking like he’d been mauled.</p><p>Although, when what Remus had been dreading actually happened, things for the very first time in Remus’s life had not changed for the worse, but for the better. For the very best, actually.</p><p>Through the sheen of unshed tears, Remus looked down to the grounds of his beloved school from the Tower, and let his mind wander back to that time when Sirius, James, and Peter sat him down on one of the beds in the dormitory and told him what they knew.</p><p>*<br/>
Second year had only just begun and Remus and the Marauders, as the band of merry troublemakers had decided to name themselves, had just come back from dinner. Remus, his mind full of notions for the half-finished Charms essay he had been planning to devote his evening to, at first hadn’t realised what James had said. </p><p>“Remus? Mate?” James called again, and this time Remus looked at him with a puzzled expression.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Would you sit down here for a second, please? We… Sirius and I… and Peter, too, of course.. We wanted to… look, just get here okay?” James pointed at his own bed, and the nervous expression he was wearing concerned Remus to the point of him not even thinking about asking why he couldn’t hear what his friends had to tell him standing where he was.</p><p>Remus sat down, James immediately sitting close to him while Peter stood by the bedpost, and Sirius… well, Sirius knelt in front of Remus surprising him.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s the matter?” Remus asked, looking at Sirius who just shrugged.</p><p>“It’s just,” James replied instead, “Just that we wanted to tell you that… we… ah, hell I’ll just come out and say it, okay? We know you’re a werewolf, Remus.”</p><p>Immensely grateful for his current sitting position, Remus felt his whole body freeze and his heart stop beating for an eternity that was, thankfully, just a fraction of a second. He thought about denying it, about crying and begging, about running away and refusing to face the consequences of this discovery. Before he could utter a single world, though, James’s voice penetrated the fog that had been clouding Remus’s mind, and he caught the last of his words.</p><p>“…not a problem! We swear! Remus, would you just breathe please you’re freaking me out!”</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, Remus realised just how much he’d needed it and that the fresh air in his lungs had cleared up his mind too.</p><p>“What? James, what did you… what are you saying?”</p><p>“Oh for the love of…” James started, but Sirius interrupted him.</p><p>“Remus? Would you please look at me?” Sirius asked, and Remus couldn’t deny him. He looked into the handsome face of his friend and found only kindness. “I’m not going to say it doesn’t matter, of course it does! I can’t even imagine how… no, okay that’s not… let’s not go there. I just want you… <i>We</i> just want you to understand that it doesn’t change anything. You’re still you! With your chocolate, and your books, and…” Sirius stopped and looked at James who immediately picked up the heartfelt speech for him, the two of them sharing a connection that couldn’t be explained yet had been plain as day since the first time Sirius and James met.</p><p>“…and your brilliant prank ideas, and all the notes you always write down during class because Sirius and I can’t be bothered! Remus, you’re still you! Great in DA, amazing at Charms…”</p><p>“… and completely pants at Potions,” was Peter’s contribution to the conversation, and Remus glanced up at him with a smile.</p><p>“So you see,” Sirius said then, and with a note of finality, “You don’t have to make up excuses anymore. You can just tell us what’s what, and we’ll do what we can to help. We <i>want</i> to do what we can to help, okay?”</p><p>James and Peter nodded at that, and Remus gave his friends a tremulous smile, unable to fully believe what he was hearing. His fear vanished when he found himself flat on his back on James’s bed, being smothered by all three of his friends, and in that moment Remus had finally believed.</p><p>*<br/>
Remus wasn’t laughing now, he hadn’t laughed since The Incident, as he had named in his mind what Sirius of all people had done. For years, only his friends had known about his secret, and they had even found a way, a true, impossible, illegal, amazing way to help him during the Full Moon. </p><p>The Marauders hadn’t actually been the only ones to know, but they’d been the ones that mattered the most. Someone else knew, and that someone was of course Lily Evans. Remus could still remember what had happened when she found out, what she said, how much her reaction struck him, but not for the reasons he’d always feared it would.</p><p>*<br/>
One afternoon in fourth year, the day after the full moon, Remus finally convinced Madam Pomfrey to release him from the infirmary and stumbled into the common room in Gryffindor Tower, alone since Madam Pomfrey hadn’t allowed his friends to come visit him and to stay with him. All of Remus’s classmates were supposed to be at lunch, no one should have been in the common room, but Lily was there. Remus couldn’t remember why she had been there that day, those details were vague and hadn’t been imprinted into his memory as vividly as what came after had.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Lily asked, concern plain in her voice.</p><p>Remus, throat still sore and not trusting his scratchy voice, just nodded. He tried to escape to the quiet of his dormitory before Lily had time to enquire more, but his legs failed him and he would have fallen had Lily not reacted promptly and supported him.</p><p>“Remus, what in the hell? What happened?” She asked, but Remus just shook his head and Lily obviously decided that his need to lie down was greater than her own need to get answers. She helped him up the stairs, into the dormitory, and onto his bed where Remus finally lay, tears in his eyes from exertion, bones aching, and terror in his heart.</p><p>“Do you have anything you can take? You know, for the pain and the soreness?” Lily asked softly, and Remus despite wanting nothing more than to be left alone and avoid any unwanted questions, couldn’t bring himself to be unkind in the face of Lily’s own kindness and concern.</p><p>“Just…” Remus cleared his throat wincing at the pain but wanting to try and talk as normally as possible. “I have a potion, but my next dose isn’t for a few hours yet. Thank you, Lily, I think I just need sleep now.” </p><p>Remus chanced a look at Lily’s face and it was then that he’d seen it, that he’d understood. The truth was plain on her face: she knew. Remus was well aware that Lily had suspected before, she had noticed the new scars and she’d been less and less willing to accept Remus’s mother’s sickness as an excuse for his disappearances. Seeing him now, when Remus was so fresh after his monthly ordeal, probably lit the proverbial light bulb in her brain, put all her suspicions into perspective and so, now, she knew.</p><p>“You know,” Remus whispered, surprising himself first and foremost.</p><p>“Remus.” Lily said, but refused to say more until he’d found the strength to look at her again. “I don’t know anything you don’t want me to know.” </p><p>A startled, painful sounding laugh escaped Remus’s mouth. “When does what I want or don’t want ever matter, Lily? When do I ever get a say?”</p><p>“Okay then,” Lily replied. “I don’t know anything you didn’t tell me yourself. And it doesn’t matter if you never tell me, it’s not important that I know. You’re my friend, Remus, and the only thing I need to know is that you’re okay.”</p><p>Remus would deny it if anyone ever asked, but he had cried at Lily’s words. He hadn’t really thought Lily would hate him for being a werewolf, but he’d thought she might fear him, shun him, not want to be his friend anymore. Hearing her quiet acceptance of his condition, and knowing that the way she’d always felt about him hadn’t changed, had been too much on Remus’s already frayed nerves. He cried, into his pillow for a moment, and then on Lily’s shoulder. She held him for a long while, until he calmed down and started to drift off.</p><p>Once he was again settled on his bed, Remus watched with heavy eyes as Lily made her way to the door.</p><p>“Thank you,” Remus told her, right before she opened the door. Lily turned, smiled at him, and winked.</p><p>Before stepping out of the dormitory, Lily threw another look at Remus and joked, “Keep Potter away from me for a week, Lupin, and we’ll be square!”</p><p>Remus’s laugh had followed him into his dreams. </p><p>*<br/>
And that had been how Lily Evans, kind hearted and warm, became the fourth Hogwarts alumni to learn Remus’s secret.</p><p>The fifth was a mistake, a betrayal, a mark forever imprinted in Remus’s heart. The fifth was never supposed to know, and his knowing was the very reason why Remus’s world was now crumbling before his eyes. And Sirius, his friend, his confidant, the one Remus thought would always have his back, and for whom he’d started developing feelings stronger than friendship, was responsible for that. Sirius had betrayed him.</p>
