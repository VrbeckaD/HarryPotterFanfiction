          <div class="userstuff"><p>Outside, the rain is pouring down hard as Pansy stands shivering on the front porch, arms crossed over her chest. She mentally scolds herself for not thinking to grab a jacket. <em>Was looking cute really worth the price?</em> she chides herself, but then her thoughts dissipate as the door in front of her swings open.</p><p>Ginny stands behind the door, and she does a double take. “You made it,”</p><p>“Clearly,”</p><p>“I can’t believe you actually came,”</p><p>Pansy scoffs, but there’s a soft blush spreading across her cheeks. “Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>“Well…” the redhead trails off. “You just seemed...so uncertain,”</p><p>“I <em>am</em> uncertain. Even more so now,”</p><p>Ginny frowns. “Don’t you trust me?” she asks, holding the door open wide enough for Pansy to slip through. Pansy hesitates, but then the former Gryffindor extends out a hand. “Will you trust me?”</p><p>Pansy stares down at the hand reaching out for her. She’s nervous, but not unwilling to take the risk.</p><p>Pansy looks up, her eyes pleading. “What if they don’t like me?”</p><p>“They’ll love you,” the voice is reassuring, but Pansy still hesitates.</p><p>“I don’t know if I—”</p><p>“You don’t have to trust me,” Ginny replies. “But at least trust yourself.”</p><p>Pansy seems to draw strength from this. She nods, grasping her hand.</p></div>
