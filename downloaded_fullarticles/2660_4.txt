    <p>
  <span>“So why did you want to talk to me?” asked James, closing the classroom door behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius tossed his hair and leant back against the desk. Then, he sprang straight up and tried putting his hands in his pockets. Then, he shook them and paced up and down the classroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re scaring me a bit,” James added. Normally, classroom meetings were reserved for only the most devilish of pranks, but now that James was head boy, there had been fewer of those.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius sat down on the desk again. “It’s really difficult to say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A pained expression had appeared on both their faces. There was nothing, really, nothing that James and Sirius couldn’t talk about. Until now, clearly. Sirius was pained because it was so embarrassing, and James because if Sirius thought it was embarrassing, then it must be bad. In fact, there were few things he couldn’t tell all the Marauders, he usually shouted out all of his problems in the dorm, including when he got a ‘broom rash’ after a particularly wet Quidditch practise session.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can tell me anything,” James said, but there was a hint of apprehension. When Sirius put his head in his hands, James thought it would be best to pat him on the shoulder. “Take your time,” he said as he touched him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t touch me!” Sirius shouted, “I’m a freak, you won’t want to. I don’t know what’s happening to me!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Startled at the outburst, but also knowing Sirius was sometimes a bit of a drama queen, he said,“Do you need to see Madam Pomfrey?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merlin, no! She’d know I was-” he paused, and James squinted at him. “Know I was an animagus. Maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have a rash?” James said, wincing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dude!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just a question!” He said, thinking back to the broom rash. “So, wait, have you started barking or something?” Maybe asking questions that Sirius could say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to was easier than him saying it outright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, not barking. Although, I can bark now, sort of, but no, it’s something else.” His eyes went wide, he looked maniacal, like he was trying to send the message straight into James’ brain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it your-” It was something embarrassing, and that usually meant bowel movements. James sighed and put his hand over his face, and said “Is it your poo?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off!” he shouted, chucking an ink bottle towards him. James caught it, quaffle-catcher-extraordinaire that he was, but they were both splattered in black ink. “Do you really think I invited you in here to tell you about my shit? My literal shit?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why are you shouting at me? You’re the one being all-” he gestured at the ink-stained beater, “all weird!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Emboldened by indignation, Sirius shouted, “It’s another part of- of me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius closed his eyes for a long blink and James squinted at him again, but maybe that was the ink in his eyes. He knew. He knew exactly what Sirius was trying to say. Well, not exactly, but there was really only one option left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please don’t tell me it’s your-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because if it’s that then-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not looking at it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t ask you to!” Another ink pot soared past James’ ear, this time smashing against the far wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wiping a new coating of ink from his face, James sat down on a chair to think. If there was something different with Sirius’.... </span>
  <em>
    <span>Down there</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and it wasn’t a rash, then he didn’t really know what it could be, but he knew that it would take more than a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ questions to figure it out. He looked up, and realised he was staring straight at the </span>
  <em>
    <span>problem</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and quickly stood up straight as a board, staring Sirius dead in the eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Pads, umm, so-” he’d practised having ‘the talk’ in the bathroom mirror, imagining not only that he and Lily were married but had a son. “So, when a boy becomes a man, there are some changes to the body that-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know that, shut it, you moron!” Sirius scrabbled behind him but he had run out of ink pots. “Good Godric! I know about puberty, ugh” he rubbed his hands over his face. “Please never make me say the word ‘puberty’ again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James sighed in relief, although he thought he had been doing a good job, all things considered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gathering himself, Sirius took a deep breath and said “It’s my-” but he seemed to get stuck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Penis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t say that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cock?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius squeezed his eyes shut.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Knob?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re a knob.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Knob it is, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, it’s my fucking knob. It’s doing something. Weird.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like a morning glory? Because that’s normal, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius’ eyes grew wide and murderous. “I know that, Prongs. No, it’s like. It’s got a lump. Sometimes. It’s freaking me out a bit, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James grit his teeth. He knew that if his own knob ever grew a lump he would also be seeking advice from one of his most trusted mates and he’d probably be terrified. “Umm, maybe you should go to see Madam Pomfrey,” he said, more quietly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius put his head in his hands again and sighed deeply. “Maybe I’ll wait a bit longer. I don’t know if it’s an issue. Like, sometimes it’s there, but sometimes it’s not. Like right now, I know it’s not.” He rubbed his hands against his trouser legs. James felt worried for him. “Sorry if that’s too much information.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Pads, you know we can talk about anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gulped and nodded, then said, “It started happening since we learnt to be animagi.” Then his head snapped to James’ and said, “Have you noticed anything?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To my penis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop saying that!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh,” he thought about the changes after his first transformation. His ears were more attune to quieter noises, and he had gotten the habit of standing disconcertingly still when asked a question in class, but he’d gotten used to that. Nothing in the way of dramatic physical changes. “Nothing, really. Other than in class, obviously.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They snorted, remembering that particular incident. Mcgonagall had asked James a question and, with a deer in the headlights expression, he had stared her down until Sirius kicked him and, in his fright, James had bounded out of the classroom, knocking desks and chairs over on the way. Sirius had tried to chase him, but Remus had the foresight to grab his shirt collar, sending him crashing to the floor, where he found Peter, who had hidden under the desk and was quivering. That had been a detention of unanswered questions from their transfiguration teacher. Their animagi had influenced their personalities, or perhaps just emphasized certain traits, but none of them had complained of any physical changes in their human form.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius sighed again, and stood up, pulling out his wand to repair the broken ink bottle. It flew back to the desk. “Thanks for listening, Prongs. I really wondered if you were having similar issues, but even though you’re not I guess at least it’s not trapped inside my own head now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry I don’t know anything.” He was going to add that Madam Pomfrey was still, really, the best option, but knew Sirius would come to terms with that eventually. He pulled out his own wand and set about removing the ink from their clothes and returning it to the bottles. “Ever since we turned animagi,” James mumbled. “We could have a look in the library at dog animagi, but there aren’t that many in England, let alone dogs.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius shrugged. “Nah, forget it. It’s probably all in my head.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We could ask Remus, I think he did a lot of reading after we told him our plan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We did a lot of reading, too,” said Sirius. “No, It’s fine, I’ll have a look if it happens again.”</span>
  <span></span>
