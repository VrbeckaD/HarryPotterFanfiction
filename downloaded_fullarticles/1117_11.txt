  <u> <strong>3rd Person POV</strong> </u>
</p>
<p>The ride back from Hogwarts always felt like it went quicker Teddy thought, as the scarlet train pulled into the platform at Kings Cross Station. He grabbed his bags and exited the compartment, followed by his friends.</p>
<p>“See you in a few weeks.” Jamie said to Teddy and Jake as he, Ollie, Charlotte and Jenna all left to find their own families.</p>
<p>Teddy and Jake walked over to the group of their cousins, aunts and uncles. Dom was talking animatedly to her mother, describing her first year at Hogwarts.</p>
<p> “Hey Jake, Teddy. Welcome back. Have a good year?” Charlie asked.</p>
<p> “Yeah. It was great dad. Where's tată?” Jake replied.</p>
<p> “Alex had to fly to Romania. Something happened on the reservation. He'll be home before the end of summer though.”</p>
<p> Charlie had come out after the war and introduced the family to his boyfriend, Alexandru. Everyone was fine with it. Molly was upset that he wouldn't be able to give her any grandchildren but that all changed when the couple announced that they were adopting Jake who was displaying signs of accidental magic at his foster home. Teddy and Jake became close and the two were both sorted into Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>“You taking me to the Burrow Charlie?” Teddy asked, after noticing that neither Harry nor Ginny was there to collect him.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Harry had some stuff to finish at work. And Ginny's already there with the kids.”</p>
<p> Bill walked over to the trio telling them that it was time that they all started to head off for the end of the year meal at the Burrow.</p>
<p>————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————</p>
<p>The house was packed with thirteen adults and fourteen children all sat around the dinner table, which had been extended in order to accommodate everyone. Individual conversations were being held until George asked, to no one in particular, about the kids love lives. “So any new relationships at Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>“Well Vicky has a boyfriend.” Teddy says, before taking another bite of his meal.</p>
<p>“What!” Bill growls quietly as Victoire wines Teddy's name.</p>
<p> “What you said you'd told him?” Teddy counters.</p>
<p> “No. I said I was going to tell him.” She replies.</p>
<p> “You can't talk anyway,” Dominique interjects loudly. “You had sex with the head girl.”</p>
<p> The table suddenly goes silent, bar the few youngest who don't understand the content of the conversation. Before anything else could be said Molly stood up  “Anyone not at Hogwarts yet into the living room" she ordered, her statement was met by a chorus of groans. “Arthur can you help?” She asked as she ushered the reluctant children out of the room, followed by her husband, Hermione, Ron, Percy, Audrey and Angelina.</p>
<p> The attention turned back to Teddy who turned to Jake. “What the hell did you tell her?”</p>
<p> “Nothing. I swear.” Jake replied. “The head girl is a Slytherin. She probably found out that way. And there is that rule about seventh year prefects teaching sex ed to the first years.”</p>
<p> “That's right. She told us never have sex. Then she spoke to her friend saying 'Unless it's with a fifth year Hufflepuff who's captain of his quidditch team'. I don't think she knew we could hear her. She seemed angry when I asked if she meant Teddy. I don't think she realised I knew him.”</p>
<p> “So it's true? I thought it was just a rumour.” Victoire questioned.</p>
<p> “That depends on what you heard.” Jake said smugly, a grin on his face as he teased his best friend. “He apparently either spent all night with her in the astronomy tower, spent a whole weekend with her in the head's dorm room or, and this is my personal favourite, he got with her on Flitwick's desk.”</p>
<p> “Okay. None of them are true.” Teddy stated defensively.</p>
<p> “So what happened?” Victoire asked, forgetting that the adults were in the room.</p>
<p> “Well one of them kind of. But we didn't spend the whole weekend in her room.”</p>
<p> “Way to go Teddy.” Jake praised with a smirk on his face.</p>
<p>George chuckled at his nephew's comment reminding the teenagers that the adults were with them. Teddy swore under his breath, earning himself a glare from his godfather. “I think we need to have a talk Edward. Don't you?” Teddy hated it when Harry called him by his birth name, it made him feel like he was six years old and had just been caught trying to steal one of his godparents' wands. He nodded in response. Harry and Ginny left the room, a solemn looking Teddy followed slowly behind them.</p>
<p> Charlie stood up. “Jake, with me.” It wasn't a question, so the fifteen year old stood up and followed his father out into the garden.</p>
<p> Bill turned to George. “Can you take Dom into the living room please? I need to speak to Victoire.” Dominique tried to protest but eventually followed her uncle out.</p>
<p> Victoire sat across from her father in silence, scared to speak. She knew was protective of her, he was her eldest, his first baby, his little girl.</p>
<p> “Vic...” he started but she wouldn't let him speak.</p>
<p> “You don't have to worry about it anymore. We broke up.”</p>
<p>Bill looked at his daughter with a confused expression.</p>
<p> “He broke up with me on the train home. I don't have a boyfriend anymore. You don't have to worry about me.” she shrugged ,trying to make light of the conversation.</p>
<p>“I will always worry about you.” her father replied , not really knowing how to reassure his daughter.</p>
<p> Victoire walked to her father and hugged him. “I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad. We didn't do anything. We only kissed once. And it lasted like two seconds at most.”</p>
<p>“I believe you kiddo. Now. How about we go see who wants some of Gramma Molly's special chocolate cake?” Bill asked, pulling away from the hug to look at his daughter. She nodded in response.</p>
<p>Charlie stared at his son in disbelief. “So you're telling me that you're in a relationship with the girl who's house I'm supposed to be letting you go to for two weeks next month?”</p>
<p> “Yes.” Jake replied bluntly.</p>
<p> “And you think I'm still going to let you go?”</p>
<p> “Yes?” Jake replied more cautiously this time. His father glared at him. “Come on. Teddy's gonna be there. And Jamie, Jenna and Ollie. Why can't I?”</p>
<p> “Because you're dating this girl and I don't know how serious it is.” Charlie's voice was beginning to rise and he was pacing slightly.</p>
<p> “What if you met her?” Jake asked, almost inaudibly. His father stopped and turned to look at him questioningly. “What if you met her before I went to stay?”</p>
<p> “I'd think about it.” Jake started to protest. “I said I'd think about it. But you have to be on your best behaviour until then. I mean it, helping out at home, staying out of trouble. The lot.”</p>
<p> “I will. I promise. Thanks dad.” Jake hugged his father, something he rarely did since becoming a teenager.</p>
<p> “I'll be telling your father about this.” Charlie said as he hugged his son.</p>
<p> “I don't doubt it.” Jake said, pulling away from the embrace and heading back towards the house. He paused and turned to his dad. “You coming? I smell Grandma's chocolate cake.” The two walked back into the kitchen, smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————</p>
<p>Teddy had been sat in silence listening to Harry rant at him for five minutes. Ginny had cast a muffilato charm on the room so that no one would be able to hear their conversation.</p>
<p> “Bloody hell we didn't even have sex!” Teddy finally shouted, tired of hearing how irresponsible he was.</p>
<p> “Don't swear at me.” Harry said. His voice still raised in anger. His tone changed to confusion when he asked, “wait, what?”</p>
<p> “I said 'we didn't even have sex.' Now can I go? I didn't do what everyone thinks I did.”</p>
<p> “No you can't go. You still said something about spending the entire day with her in her dorm room and I doubt you were playing chess.”</p>
<p> “I said we didn't have sex...” Teddy hesitated, embarrassed to be telling his godparents what happened, but the glare he received from Harry made him continue. “We kinda did everything but.”</p>
<p> Ginny moved from her place at the wall and sat next to Teddy. “Oh Teddy.”</p>
<p> “What?! We both wanted to. And I'm not stupid. I know when to stop and about contraception and everything. For Godric's sake I'm fifteen.”</p>
<p> “That's why we're concerned. We know you're not stupid. But you're fifteen. And a male. Most fifteen year old males don't have the best track record when it comes to self-restraint. But we trust you. And we know that when the time comes, you'll be ready.” Ginny hugged Teddy from the side as she spoke.</p>
<p> “And safe!” Harry added at the end. “I swear you knock up a girl before you're twenty and I'll set the uncles on you.”</p>
<p> The comment made Teddy physically freeze. The males of the Weasley family were very protective and would stick by each other. If Harry said Teddy had done something wrong, the others would agree.</p>
<p> “You will not harm my godson.” Ginny scolded her husband. “Now. I think it's time for some cake. Don't you?” The two males nodded, both knowing better than to disagree with Ginny, and followed her out the room back downstairs to the kitchen.</p>
