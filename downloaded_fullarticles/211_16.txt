          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hermione never thought she'd meet Pansy Parkinson ever again after her school years, but fate seemed to have other plans. Very, very wicked plans it seemed, since Hermione had caught Parkinson in the middle of breaking into her house. </p><p>"Parkinson?" The frizzy haired woman mumbled, not sure whether to reach for her wand, since Parkinson had a deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression, seemingly frozen. The wards around Hermione's home were wavering and shuddering, attempting to mend the rip torn through them, while a breeze blew through the shattered window.  </p><p>"I--" Parkinson was holding one of Hermione's grandmother's golden necklaces, having dug through the drawers and cupboards in the living room. </p><p>"What the hell are you doing in my house?!" Hermione finally snapped out of it, and drew her wand, a hex at the tip of her tongue. </p><p>Parkinson immediately dropped the necklace and lifted both her hands into the air in a placating gesture:</p><p>"I'm unarmed, Granger!" </p><p>Hermione glared at her for another moment, studying her clothing for any signs of a concealed weapon. Having found none, Hermione lowered her arm.</p><p>"Get out of my house Parkinson, before I change my mind and call the authorities." Hermione snapped, sighing heavily. Parkinson didn't exactly deserve such a mercy, but Hermione was there during her trial, she heard everything the Parkinsons went through during the war. They'd lost nearly everything, Hermione wasn't surprised Parkinson resorted to stealing to get by. She didn't have the heart to get her locked up.</p><p>Without another word, Parkinson slid out of the open front door, breezing past Hermione. As soon as she was out, Hermione shut and locked the door, then started to mend her wards with a tired scowl on her face.</p><p>This wasn't how she expected her evening to go.</p><p> ~</p><p>It wasn't long after that that Hermione completely forgot about Pansy, until she found her slinking through Knockturn alley, pickpocketing. Was her situation <em>so</em> desperate? Hermione didn't venture into Knockturn alley often, it was rather distasteful, but when she did, she certainly didn't expect to notice disgraced Pureblood women pickpocketing oblivious witches and wizards.</p><p>Wondering briefly whether or not it was any of her business to interfere, she realized Parkinson was about to get <em>caught.</em> She was reaching for a man's pocket, just as he was turning around to greet a friend who'd called to him from somewhere behind him. </p><p>Without missing a beat, Hermione sidled up to Parkinson and hooker her arm through the other woman's, jerking her away at the last second and loudly proclaiming:</p><p>"There you are! I've been looking for you <em>everywhere!" </em></p><p>The man remained none the wiser as did the rest of the folk, while Parkinson blanched in shock at Hermione. The bookworm pulled her into a side alley and let go of her with a sigh.</p><p>"What the <em>fuck</em> do you think you're doing Granger?" Parkinson hissed, glaring daggers at Hermione.</p><p>"You were about to get caught, you should be thanking me." Hermione snipped, crossing her arms across her chest. "Do you <em>know</em>  what would become of you if the DMLE got ahold of you?"</p><p>Parkinson scoffed and turned her head away, leaning on the grotty brick wall behind her. She was silent for a while, before sighing deeply:</p><p>"Anything's better than this." She mumbled to herself, and for a moment, Hermione sympathized with her struggle.</p><p>"Is it really that bad? That you have to resort to petty theft?" </p><p>Parkinson rolled her eyes:</p><p>"If it wasn't, do you honestly think I'd be doing it? Oh, whatever, you don't care either way." She pushed off the wall and made to disappear into the crowd. Something in Hermione bubbled to the surface then, akin to a want to help someone but a bit more alien still.</p><p>"Wait, Parkinson!" She took a step towards the other woman, hesitantly reaching out.</p><p>"What?" The black haired girl tossed over her shoulder.</p><p>"I can help you. I <em>want</em>  to." Hermione bit her lip. She wasn't sure where it came from, but no one deserved to live this fate. </p><p>Parkinson turned stiffly, regarding her with distrustful eyes.</p><p>"Why?" She asked, propping a hand on her hip, one eyebrow arched.</p><p>Hermione didn't know what to say, there wasn't really much to it.</p><p>"No one deserves to live this way." </p><p>A lurid, derisive smile graced Parkinson's face:</p><p>"Not even disgraced Voldemort's minions?" </p><p>Hermione grimaced, looked away. That wasn't how she viewed the matter at all. Finally, she turned back and stared dead into Parkinson's eyes:</p><p>
  <em>"No one."</em>
</p><p> ~</p><p>The two of them went to this dirty <em>hovel</em>  Parkinson was living in. Hermione was horrified while Parkinson packed up what little she had of her things. Opting it best to sit this one out quietly, Hermione waited by the door for Parkinson, even more sure of her decision now. These <em>living conditions,</em> if one could call them that, were <em>atrocious. </em>She simply could <em>not,  </em>in good conscience, leave someone in that dump when she knows she can help.</p><p>"This place is beneath you." Was all Hermione deemed fit to say when they were far away from it. Parkinson merely shrugged, not having said a single word throughout packing and leaving. Hermione didn't really have a plan for what to do next, but the logical first step would be move Parkinson in with her. It sounded crazy a thing, but there wasn't much else she could do for now.</p><p>She grabbed Parkinson's hand and spun on the spot, Apparating back to her house. They landed in front of her front door and Parkinson seemed to rouse from whatever daze had gripped her.</p><p>"Wait--Here?!" She sounded bewildered. </p><p>"Where else?" Hermione deadpanned, drawing her wand to familiarize her wards with Parkinson's magical signature.</p><p>"But I--" Parkinson began, the rest of her sentence dying on her lips.</p><p>"You broke in once, yes." Hermione finished for her, giving her a <em>'so?' </em>look, then opening the door. </p><p>Parkinson shut up and followed Hermione inside, looking a tad flustered.</p><p>"I have a spare bedroom you can take." The bushy haired woman showed Pansy around her house and left her to shower and change. </p><p>Meanwhile, Hermione made her way into her kitchen to brew herself some strong tea. This was such a bad idea. The thought swirled around her head for the hundredth time, but another part of her disagreed fervently. She almost missed the kettle whistling lost in thought as she was, snapping out of her reverie and pouring two cups. </p><p>It was about then that Pansy padded into the kitchen, black hair collected up into a loose ponytail, wearing an oversized lemon yellow sweater and matching socks with baggy black pants to complete the picture.</p><p>Hermione gave her a once over and before she could open her mouth, Pansy held a hand up:</p><p>"Not a word. I know I look like a bloody Hufflepuff." </p><p>Hermione blinked and chortled. Of all the ways to describe the outfit, <em>a bloody Hufflepuff</em>, hadn't crossed her mind, but it somehow fit with Parkinson's entire demeanor.</p><p>Pansy plopped herself down into a chair and picked up a cup of tea, throwing it back like a goddamn shot, polishing off the entire thing in a single gulp. It was <em>scalding hot!</em></p><p>Hermione gaped and nearly dropped her own cup:</p><p>"But-!" She spluttered.</p><p>"I haven't had a proper cup of tea in <em>months</em>. I needed that." Parkinson leaned back in the chair with a satisfied droop in her lips. </p><p>Hermione just sat down next to her, in silent shock. That was an impressive feat if Hermione's ever seen one, and she has watched her best friend kill an absolute bloody madman. </p><p>"So, last I saw you was your trial. What's been going on since?" The frizzy woman asked, slowly nursing her cup. A dark shadow flittered across Pansy's face when she started talking. It remained consistent through her story, veiling her green eyes heavily.</p><p>It was a rough story. The Ministry had taken <em>everything</em>, and her parents smuggled themselves away on some ship without ever telling her where they were running to. Pansy was left all alone in a world that cast her out.</p><p>Hermione's heart felt heavy as a stone when Pansy was done, she was lost for words. For lack of any other way to show her support, she placed a hand over Pansy's on the table. Pansy didn't flinch away like Hermione thought she might've.</p><p>"That all ends now." Hermione nodded, certain of her decision now more than ever. </p><p>Pansy didn't say anything, but a pinch in her brow eased.</p><p>~</p><p>The first week was the oddest, more so in how silent it was than anything else. Hermione barely ever noticed Pansy. She'd bump into her in the bathroom occasionally or find her munching on toast in the morning, but that was it. The black haired girl mostly kept to her room, and Hermione didn't really want to bother her. Any apprehension Hermione might have felt about having Pansy in her home, promptly vanished within that first week.</p><p>Hermione did worry though, about the constant night terrors Pansy seemed to suffer. Hermione tried to go into her room once and wake her, but the door was locked and simmering with adrenaline pumped magic. It would have taken nothing short of an explosion to open that door, so Hermione had to leave it.</p><p>One lucky morning, Hermione managed to catch Pansy buttering some toast. All Hermione had ever seen her eat was toast, which also worried her. </p><p>"Good morning." The former Gryffindor greeted and dug around her fridge determined to put a proper meal into Pansy. She felt responsible for her in a way now, couldn't to let her waste away. Pansy was beautiful, but far too skinny, which didn't flatter her appearance at all, nor did it help her health. So, Hermione put together a strong breakfast for her. </p><p>"Morning." Pansy mumbled, staring down into her plate. She wasn't much for conversation, but Hermione wasn't one to give up easily:</p><p>"Slept well?" It was a long standing issue she had wanted to press for a while. </p><p>"Yeah, fine." Pansy shrugged, and Hermione pressed her lips into a thin line. She could hear Pansy cry out each night, since their rooms were right next to each other. It made it difficult for Hermione to get a good night's rest, listening to such distress. Before she placed the plate she'd prepared in front of Pansy, Hermione pulled a small vial of Dreamless Sleep from her nightgown pocket and considered it for a second. </p><p>Pansy's screams ringing in her ears, her decision was made. Hermione grabbed the plate and set it on the table before the black haired woman.</p><p>"What is this?" Pansy asked, pointing down at it with furrowed eyebrows.</p><p>"You can't survive on toast alone. Eat up." Hermione murmured, before setting the vial next to the plate too. Pansy stared at it for a second, then up at Hermione. Her face betrayed a sort of confused wonder at the gesture, but all Hermione gave her was a meaningful look, and left her to her own devices.</p><p>~</p><p>After that morning, Hermione noticed Pansy's sleeping improve. The terrors were few and far between, which pleased Hermione. Her eating habits improved, Hermione quickly learning that Pansy had an incredibly appetite for sour flavors. She could suck on <em>Selena's Sour Sticks  </em>all day. She looked like a child with a lolly when she curled up on the couch and unwrapped one. It was adorable. Hermione began discreetly leaving them around the house from then on. </p><p>It had <em>also </em>come to Hermione's attention that Pansy would snag her shirt or sweater occasionally and wear them around the house. The first time it happened, Hermione thought nothing of it, but it kept happening more often, and while the bushy haired woman never really said anything, as she didn't really mind, it had caught her eye how lovely Pansy wore Hermione's clothes. An odd thing to notice, but Hermione always did fancy herself to be quite observant.</p><p>Pansy didn't leave the house much, she didn't want to be persecuted by people bitter from the war, who held a grudge. She confided in Hermione that she had started to feel safe with her, and that it was nice to have a roof over her head after <em>years</em>  of curling up in that hovel for shelter. The atmosphere between eased infinitely and they would often chat all through the evening with wine glasses in their hands. </p><p>Hermione learned many things during these warm evenings. Pansy was, indeed, a true sharp-tongued Slytherin, <em>however</em>, her views were a lot more mellow and varied. She was truly an interesting person to spend time with, and Hermione found herself more and more interested as the days dwindled by. She could relate to Hermione in a way little who else could. Not even Ron or Harry, as much as she loved her two idiot boys. They were a bit at odds with Hermione's choice of a housemate, but she'd asked them to trust their judgment, so they relented in the end. </p><p>Asking after Pansy's friends, and why she didn't go to one of them for help, Pansy explained the only one she really maintained a proper friendship was Malfoy, and he was off considerably worse than her. Hermione grimaced, though she understood. What with the Mark and all his family did...Beyond everything Malfoy had done to hurt her, Hermione felt bad for him as well, he was only a kid when he was pressured into horrific commitments. Harry had told her about that night Dumbledore died. He told her he could see it in Malfoy's eyes that he couldn't ever do it. Kill someone. </p><p>Friendship with Pansy came easier than Hermione expected it would, which why Hermione didn't find herself terribly surprised upon discovering Pansy was a very affectionate person. She <em>loved</em> to play with Hermione's hair, or to poke her and scritch at her, or press close. Hermione accepted these ministrations with a chortle and slowly began returning them after a point. </p><p>It all seemed to be working out lovely.</p><p>Perhaps a month after she'd first moved in, Pansy asked if Hermione would be alright with Malfoy coming to see her. Hermione said it was fine, of course, and that afternoon, Hermione found herself face to face with Draco Malfoy after years.</p><p>"Malfoy, hello." She greeted and let him inside. He seemed painfully uncomfortable, which Hermione let herself revel in for just a moment. </p><p>"Hello Granger." He curtly replied and awkwardly waited for Hermione to lead him into the living room.</p><p>When they entered, Pansy sprung to her feet, face splitting in a large grin that was mirrored on Malfoy's face as they hugged. It warmed Hermione's heart to see Pansy grinning so earnestly. </p><p>They sat around with some tea and Hermione mostly tuned herself out, letting the two talk between themselves. She was idly sipping her tea and staring at nothing in particular, when a particularly interesting snippet of conversation reached her ears.</p><p>"..you're over him right?" </p><p>"I wish..I don't know how-"</p><p>"Oh Draco, this has been going on since school, stop hurting yourself-"</p><p>"...No, I <em>know</em>  all that, but it's damn hard to forget his stupid face and green eyes and glasses and everything--"</p><p>
  <em>Oh. Oh that was interesting alright.</em>
</p><p>Hermione didn't flinch but she tuned in to the conversation more keenly, continuing to calmly sip her tea. If they were talking about who she thought they were talking about, this evening would end much more spectacularly than she'd thought.</p><p>"...Have you even spoken to him since the trials?"</p><p>"He came to return my wand and apologize.."</p><p>"..Apologize? For what?"</p><p>"Everything."</p><p>"Ahh, makes sense. Gods you two drove the entire school up the wall with your little shenanigans.."</p><p>"Yes, well, he's managed to continue driving me up the wall without even trying long <em>after</em> school."</p><p>Yep, they <em>were</em> definitely talking about who Hermione thought they were talking about. Swallowing a swooned smile, she cleared her throat and took another sip of her tea, then joined the conversation:</p><p>"Pardon me for interrupting, but were you, per chance, talking about Harry?" </p><p>They both sort of gaped at her for a few seconds. Malfoy seemed very pale, then very red, while Pansy seemed to be working something out in her head.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>They spoke in unison and then stared at each other. Pansy cocked an unamused eyebrow at Draco:</p><p>"That's Hermione Granger sitting next to you Draco." She deadpanned.</p><p>Hermione chuckled and patted Malfoy's back sympathetically:</p><p>"Listen to the girl, mate, you aren't getting out of this one."</p><p>Malfoy rolled his eyes and scoffed, but his face remained consistently red:</p><p>"Even if we <em>were</em> talking about Potter, what's it to you?" </p><p>Hermione chortled again and leaned back into the couch, starting to inspect her fingernails in a show of disinterest:</p><p>"To <em>me</em> it's nothing, to <em>Harry  </em>however, it might just be everything."</p><p>Just as she figured, Malfoy turned in his seat to face her, though a deep scowl etched into his face. She let him wait and squirm, gulping her tea slowly, in small sips, so it would last her longer. </p><p>"What is that supposed to mean?" Malfoy finally snapped, and Hermione bit back a wolfish grin:</p><p>"It <em>means</em> that you should totally, indisputably, irrefutably ask him out and do it soon Malfoy." She turned her head just in time to watch Malfoy malfunction. He sort of stared off into the distance and froze up. Hermione called out to him, but he didn't respond. When she helplessly turned to Pansy, who was bursting to laugh, the girl reached out and waved a hand in front of Malfoy's face, which finally seemed to snap him out of it. </p><p>He blinked dumbly and furrowed his brows, as if trying to recall what the hell happened. Hermione couldn't believe things had turned out so lucky for Harry, who'd told her back in school that there was something about Malfoy that drew Harry in, and they'd both only realized what it meant several years later. She was so incredibly happy for him.</p><p>"Please don't freeze up like that in the middle of a date, Harry will panic and worry." Hermione advised, already picturing a frazzled Harry hovering around Malfoy. </p><p>"Bold of you to assume I'll manage to untie my tongue long enough to even ask Granger." Malfoy scoffed.</p><p>Both Hermione and Pansy rolled their eyes in tandem. Hermione was not to be easily deterred though:</p><p>"If you had the balls to lie straight to Voldemort's face about Harry's identity, then you'll damn well have the balls to ask him out." </p><p>Both Pansy and Malfoy bristled at Hermione for a moment. </p><p>"What? I'm not wrong." She shrugged. Sometimes, blunt techniques were most effective.</p><p>The tension eased away between the three of them afterwards, and they even managed to spend a decently pleasant afternoon together, which was a scene Hermione couldn't of ever pictured just a few months ago. </p><p>After Malfoy had left, Pansy had tacked Hermione in a big, unexpected hug. Hermione gladly returned it, a rush of warm affection flooding her for the woman in her arms. She never really stopped to think about these feelings, part of her was well aware what it meant she supposed, but she didn't think she needed to. It came as naturally as could be, which Hermione was alright with.</p><p>"Thank you so much! It's been weighing on Draco for <em>years</em>." Pansy murmured into Hermione's neck while they were still embraced and Hermione chuckled into the head of soft black hair.</p><p>"I know. Harry hasn't been much better."</p><p>Pansy pulled back from the hug, smile still in place, eyes wide and clear. She took a deep breath, not once breaking eye contact with Hermione, and leaned in, connecting their lips in the softest, sweetest kiss.</p><p>It was but a moment, before she pulled away:</p><p>"Thank you." Pansy nodded, trying to move away, but Hermione, dazed and joyous as she was, couldn't let her. That one kiss solidified what she already knew to be true, and it symbolized a bloom of something Hermione wanted to care for. So, Hermione guided Pansy's lips back to her own again, the two melting into each other forevermore.</p><p>~</p><p>
  <em>Fin.</em>
