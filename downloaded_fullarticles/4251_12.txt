    <p>He’s a first-year when he meets Avery Bellbow.</p><p>“Congratulations!” the large teen says, clapping him on the back with a grin.</p><p><em>Is he really only a year ahead of me? He’s huge.</em> The boy looks like a Viking, muscled and stout, and his dirty blonde hair is oddly long.</p><p>“Thanks…?”</p><p>“Avery. Avery Bellbow,” the boy smiles, teeth perfect and white.</p><p><em>Well, he’s certainly the ‘body’, </em>Graves thinks, and he continues up the steps to his House.</p>
<hr/><p>“You’re a small-ish fellow,” Avery starts, pulling books out of his bag, and Graves raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“I’m eleven,” Graves says shortly.</p><p>Bellbow’s laugh seems to shake the very school itself.</p>
<hr/><p>He is making his way to Charms one day when he runs into a girl.</p><p>“Oh, god- I’m sorry,” she starts, bending to collect the books scattered on the floor.</p><p>“No- it’s my fault,” he starts, helping, “I wasn’t paying attention.”</p><p>He notices after a moment that she has something on her back. An odd case, or something. <em>What is that?</em></p><p>“Are you going to Charms?” he asks, passing a book to her. <em>Intermediate Protective Spells</em>.</p><p>“Yes. You’re- Wampus? Right?”</p><p>“Yes. You’re Pukwudgie.”</p><p>Her smile is sweet. She seems kind, he thinks, and friendly. <em>I wonder if they’re all like this.</em> He hasn’t had any classes with Pukwudgie yet.</p><p>“I’m Andie,” she offers, moving with the crowd of students pushing them towards the classroom.</p><p>“Percival Graves.”</p><p>“Oh, dear,” she laughs, and he’s surprised at what seems like her insensitivity. Her eyes are bright, though, and then she says, “my full name is Andromeda. It seems like we both got the short end of the stick.”</p><p>“Maybe so,” Graves smiles, feeling better, and he wonders at how comfortable he is around her.</p><p>
  <em>I thought our Houses were supposed to be perfect for us. Maybe it’s because she’s in a different house, though. Change is good.</em>
</p><p>Andie waves as she leaves him, moving to the other side of the room, and Graves finds himself thinking about the House system. <em>If we’re surrounded by others like ourselves, maybe the point is to realize not only our strengths but our weaknesses.</em></p>
<hr/><p>It is a Saturday and Graves is enjoying the weather.</p><p>It’s warm and breezy, so he’s trying to find a spot outside to study. The campus is dotted with students and he wonders if anyone is really getting any studying done.</p><p>“Percy,” Andie says, and he turns to see her walking his way. There is another boy following her.</p><p>“Hi. Who’s this?”</p><p>“Ianto,” Andie explains, adjusting the strap of her book bag. “he’s in my House.”</p><p>Ianto seems quiet. He has white-blond hair and startlingly grey eyes. He almost looks like a ghost.</p><p>“Nice to meet you,” Graves nods, and Ianto opens his mouth to speak but never gets the chance.</p><p>There are yells and jeers from a few yards away and Andie’s face changes to one of worry and disgust.</p><p>“Oh, no,” she says, casting him a significant look, and then she starts towards the commotion.</p><p>Graves sends a questioning look at Ianto but the boy shrugs. <em>Better to follow her.</em></p><p>There are a group of older students surrounding two other boys. One of them Graves recognizes- an older boy in Wampus, Jordan, two years ahead of him. He’s clearly strong, and Graves doesn’t think the other boy stands a chance. He doesn’t recognize the other boy but he assumes from the group that it’s someone from Horned Serpent. He is tall and thin, with blue-black hair.</p><p>“<em>Snake</em>!” Jordan yells, and some of his friends join him in yelling. “I know what you are! What you did! Fight like a real man!”</p><p>He pushes the boy’s shoulder, forceful, but the student’s feet stay planted. He barely sways.</p><p>“They’re going to fight,” Andie says, worried. “God, this is so stupid- Bertrand hasn’t done anything; they just like picking on him-,”</p><p><em>Bertrand, </em>Graves thinks. He recognizes the name. He’s heard more than a few nasty comments in passing, from upperclassmen. He’s never gotten himself involved, and he never takes anything for granted- even so, he’d still felt the accusations and gossip to be silly and likely fueled by jealousy or simple intolerance.</p><p>“I can get a professor,” Ianto volunteers, but Andie shakes her head and looks towards the school.</p><p>“It’s too late- anyways, one of the first-years in Horned Serpent already left.”</p><p>In the center of the circle, Bertrand speaks.</p><p>“I didn’t do it.”</p><p><em>He knows Jordan’s going to hit,</em> Graves realizes. <em>Why did he say that if he knew what would happen?</em></p><p>He watches Jordan yell something and move and then-</p><p>Jordan falls flat on his face.</p><p>There’s a moment of silence and then an eruption of laughter. Bertrand stands, hands at his side, watching dispassionately. Jordan growls and Graves looks closer, surprised.</p><p>
  <em>His shoes are tied together.</em>
</p><p>He’s wondering if Bertrand did it- but he knows nonverbal and wandless magic is beyond even a third-year. <em>So who did it</em>?</p><p>Some of Jordan’s friends move to help and they fall on their faces. Before anything else can happen, Graves sees a teacher- Professor Hale- emerging from the school. The group quickly scatters, and as it does, Graves almost runs into another boy.</p><p>His dark brown eyes sparkle with mischief as he says,</p><p>“Sorry. ‘Scuse me.”</p><p>There is only one thing Graves is certain of. <em>He did it.</em></p>
<hr/><p>Robert is fully aware that he’s not particularly special.</p><p>He’s decent enough in his classes. There are one or two where he excels- the product of too much time and not too many friends.</p><p>That’s another thing. He doesn’t really have many friends.</p><p>He’s not particularly hurt by it. His early childhood had been unremarkable, characterized mostly by isolation and the quiet of the forest. He hadn’t had any real interaction with others outside of family. In the end, it’s made him more independent- but that doesn’t mean he wouldn’t like friends.</p><p>“Len, I’m going to practice flying. Coming?”</p><p>“Sure. Give me a minute. Here’s your parchment, Rob.”</p><p>It’s another example of how he is both included and ignored. Len doesn’t even invite him- he only stops long enough to give back Robert’s things.</p><p>It shouldn’t bother him, but lately, it’s been getting more apparent.</p><p>He’s bored, and lonely.</p>
<hr/><p>Bertrand is going to his House when Jordan stops him. He’s with his usual friends- two other Wampus boys- and behind him, a group of younger students are walking.</p><p>“Hold on, snake. Where are you going?” Jordan asks, voice quiet and icy.</p><p>Bertrand glances at the younger students. <em>They’ll get in trouble if they stay, </em>he thinks, and he tries to communicate the thought.</p><p>One of the boys, blonde and distinctly Nordic, gives him a significant look and glances at his friend. A serious boy, with black hair and dark eyes.</p><p><em>Huh, </em>Bertrand thinks, a little amused as he watches the boys walk away. <em>They’re going to get a teacher. That’s a first, from Wampus kids…</em></p><p>“First-years can’t help you,” Jordan snorts, and Bertrand turns his attention back to the boy.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>“I know you’ve been trying to become an animagus. I know you’re the snake that bit Lucy. Too much of a <em>coward</em> to face me as a man, is that it?”</p><p><em>So that’s it, </em>Bertrand thinks, vaguely annoyed. <em>What an idiot.</em> <em>He thinks I’m a literal snake.</em></p><p>He is about to answer when a student comes around the corner.</p><p>A first-year, he can tell, and a Thunderbird. <em>What’s he doing here? His House is on the other side of the school.</em> The boy’s face is familiar, somehow. He has wavy brown hair and dark brown eyes.</p><p>“Move it, kid,” Jordan says, jerking his head towards the hallway.</p><p>The boy doesn’t move. He looks unimpressed.</p><p><em>Honestly, sometimes I don’t know if Wampus or Thunderbird is worse, </em>Bertrand thinks, exasperated.</p><p>“You’re a bully,” the kid says shortly, matter-of-fact, and Bertrand almost chokes.</p><p><em>Do you know who this is? </em>He tries to ask with his eyes, imploring. <em>He is a bully. And he’s not afraid to beat up a first-year.</em></p><p>The boy blinks up at Bertrand and his mouth twitches for a second, a smile there and gone again.</p><p>
  <em>What the-</em>
</p><p>“What’s your name, little bird?” Jordan asks, signaling, and his two friends move menacingly around the student.</p><p>“Robert. It means ‘shining fame’. A lofty goal, but I try my best.”</p><p><em>The little imp, </em>Bertrand realizes. <em>He’s playing for time.</em></p><p>It’s dangerous. But he’s not surprised a boy from the House of adventurers doesn’t care. Jordan and his cronies laugh and Bertrand tenses, thinking. He’s willing to join the fight, if they try to assault the younger boy. There’s nothing more disgusting to him than an unfair fight when it comes to students. All it does is prove something the stronger person already knows.</p><p>“Well, <em>Robert</em>, congratulations. Your shining fame has caught my attention. Before we continue, though,” he says thoughtfully, and Bertrand reaches for his wand but is already too late. “<em>Petrificus Totalus</em>.”</p><p>He’s never really had the curse performed on him. He immediately decides he doesn’t like it and resolves never to be subject to it again.</p><p>He can’t move. He can only watch.</p><p>But when Robert looks at him, before Jordan turns, his expression is one of expectant resignation. <em>As if he expected this.</em></p><p>And maybe he did. Robert seems to make his body limp, allowing the kick to send him to the ground, and he curls tight in a movement that suggests practice. Bertrand wonders, for a moment, if Robert is used to bullying.</p><p>A minute- what feels like an age- later, Professor Hale comes barreling around the corner.</p><p>“Stop. Now,” the man roars, and Jordan jumps back, face drained of color. “This is the third time this week, Jordan. You three-come with me. Bertrand, take the boy to the infirmary.”</p><p>Hale waves his hand and Bertrand exhales, moving experimentally. On the ground, Robert coughs, rubbing his mouth. There’s blood.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have done that,” Bertrand starts, because it’s true, but he wishes he’d started with something different. Thanks, maybe. Or reassurance.</p><p><em>I’m bad at this, </em>he thinks.</p><p>“Worth it,” Robert sighs, turning over, and Bertrand winces at the dirt and tears in the boy’s robe. “He had one last chance to prove himself to the faculty. Hale said so after the courtyard incident.”</p><p>“…you were there?”</p><p>Robert looks up, eyes sparkling, and Bertrand feels his heart drop into his stomach. It feels like falling.</p><p>“It was you,” Bertrand realizes. “You tied their shoelaces.”</p><p>“I’m pretty good at silly spells,” Robert smiles, looking up at the ceiling. “I have too much time on my hands.”</p><p><em>He’s been helping me, and I didn’t know, </em>Bertrand thinks. He feels a little ashamed. Still, he does the only thing he can think of, extending a hand.</p><p>“Come on. You need to get looked at.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Robert gripes, but he still accepts the hand.</p><p>
  <em>So small.</em>
</p><p>“You’re Robert, then.”</p><p>“Yes. You’re Bertrand.”</p><p>“…thank you.”</p><p>Robert smiles like the sun and Bertrand could swear the room gets warmer, some strange glow lighting it from within. From Robert.</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p>
<hr/><p>“So Professor Hale helped, right?”</p><p>Bertrand pauses, looking vaguely surprised, and Graves waits for an answer.</p><p>“Yes. I appreciate it,” the older boy says, glancing at Bellbow.</p><p>“Bullies,” Bellbow snorts. “They’ll date a Horned Snake at one point or another. They’re just being stupid.”</p><p>Bertrand raises an eyebrow, but Graves can see a half-smile forming.</p><p><em>Good, </em>he thinks.</p><p>“We’re not all bad,” Graves tries. “I hope you know that.”</p><p>“…no. We’re not all bad,” Bertrand agrees, the smile fully formed, and Graves fights the flush on his face.</p>
<hr/><p>“I don’t know about his,” a voice says from further down the line.</p><p>Graves recognizes the boy. It’s the one from the day in the courtyard; the one he thought helped Bertrand.</p><p>“Come on, Robert,” the professor says, and Graves watches. “You’re a Thunderbird. Meant to fly.”</p><p>“I’ve never-,” the boy tries, more agitated than scared, but then the broom jolts and he shoots into the air.</p><p>“…. oh, dear,” the professor says mildly. “Well. He’ll get the hang of it.”</p><p>
  <em>You’ve got to be kidding me.</em>
</p><p>Bellbow raises an eyebrow at Graves.</p><p>“Go on, then. I’ll catch you if you fall,” he grins, leaning against the stone wall of the school, and Graves rolls his eyes.</p><p>He kicks off easily, gliding upwards, and when he gets closer he almost thinks he shouldn’t have come. The boy seems to be sitting peacefully, eyes closed, suspended above the trees.</p><p>“Do you need help?” Graves tries, unsure.</p><p>“I am not opening my eyes,” the boy says slowly, “because I think it will most likely unnerve me. I would appreciate your assistance, um...?”</p><p>“Percival. But please don’t call me that.”</p><p>“Val,” the boy says immediately. <em>That’s new. </em>“I’m Robert. I love flying, yes, but I have not flown alone yet. I believe throwing me in the deep end was somewhat of a mistake.”</p><p>“You know yourself best,” Graves agrees, and he sees a smile flicker across Robert’s face.</p><p>“You probably could have been in Pukwudgie.”</p><p>“Probably not.”</p><p>“No, maybe not,” Robert laughs. “So, Val…what next?”</p><p>“Next, we get you lower.”</p><p>He talks Robert through the motions easily enough, and the boy seems to get the hang of descending.</p><p>“You could probably try to open your eyes,” he suggests, and Robert pauses.</p><p>“If you suggest it,” Robert says mildly, and he opens his eyes.</p><p>Graves can see the struggle between acceptance and instinct. <em>Hm. </em>He’s about to suggest they speed up a little when someone zips by, a blur of color and steely eyes. <em>Jordan, </em>he thinks, and then he’s watching in horror as Robert is knocked off his broom by the older boy’s shoulder.</p><p>He thinks he yells something but he forgets, flying fast, realizing he’s just a little too slow. Later, he wonders why Robert didn’t scream.</p><p>It doesn’t matter, though, because Graves pulls up hard a moment after he sees Bellbow, determined, catch Robert as he falls.</p><p><em>Thank god, </em>Graves thinks, relief flooding his system, and he casts Bellbow a grateful look.</p><p>“Hello, handsome,” Robert says cheekily, but his voice is a little shaky.</p><p>Bellbow blinks and looks at the smaller boy in his arms. He laughs, booming, and Graves smiles apologetically at Robert.</p><p>“I like this kid,” Bellbow chuckles, and to his credit he doesn’t let Robert down.</p><p><em>He knows he’s still a little scared, </em>Graves thinks, and he feels his respect for Bellbow grow just a little more.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he starts, trying to apologize for not paying attention, but Robert shakes his head.</p><p>“Jordan’s going to have it out for me. It’s fine.”</p><p>“You’re quite small,” Bellbow says, still holding Robert as Graves follows them with the broomsticks. “I could probably use you as a weight training partner.”</p><p>“Or as a weight,” Robert laughs, and Bellbow laughs along with him.</p>
