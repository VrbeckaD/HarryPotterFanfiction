    <p>Harry Potter. The saviour of the wizardry world. The chosen one. He thought he had seen everything. You start thinking that after walking on your best friends while they are NOT fully dressed. Together. But here he stood, jaw probably a couple of floors below, staring at his son. Naked. On top of another boy. Kissing. Who happens to be no other than his Godson. Teddy Lupin.</p>
<p>Harry turned, walked out and went straight to the kitchen. His son was gay. He was totally okay with that. His 19 years old, gay son was having sex with his 23 years old god brother. He needed something stronger than tea to get his head around that.</p>
<p>Harry put the kettle on the stove and started busying himself with making tea and biscuits. 30 minutes later, two trays of biscuits have been put in the cookie jar and tea was waiting with a heating charm on it.</p>
<p>"It's really ironic, you know. "</p>
<p>"What is?"</p>
<p>"You are the one who got fucked and I am the one with the too big T-shirt. "</p>
<p>"Well, I can't walk because of said shagging."</p>
<p>"You love me and you know it. "</p>
<p>"You are lucky I do. "</p>
<p>James pecked Teddy's lips and turned to enter the kitchen.</p>
<p>You know that cliche in movies when someone drops something from their hands and it breaks because of a surprise? James didn't have anything in his hands right now, but he was sure that would have happened if he did.</p>
<p>His dad was sat at kitchen table, biscuit in one hand and one of Teddy's comic books in the other. He closed the comic, put it on the table beside the now disregarded biscuit and gave James that look. The look where he crossed his arms, tightened his jaw and stared unblinkingly in the most unnerving way to possibly exist.</p>
<p>A string of really colourful swear words left Teddy's mouth beside him.</p>
<p>"Sit. "</p>
<p>They did.</p>
<p>"So. Who is going to start the explanation first?"</p>
<p>It was phrased like a question, but it clearly wasn't. Harry's eyes were on James. He thought the intensity of the gaze was going to burn him alive.</p>
<p>"It's a long story. "</p>
<p>"I have time. "</p>
<p> </p>
