    <p>Once upon a time there was a little boy who lived in a house with a family who didn’t want him. He wore his cousin’s old clothes, he had glasses that were held together with sticky tape and he slept in a cupboard under a stairs. And then one day he was rescued, found out that he had magic and was very special and was taken to a magical school run by a wise and kind old wizard.</p><p>But it turned out that being magical doesn’t just make everything better. The magical world was dangerous and the old wizard was neither as wise nor as kind as the boy thought. The boy suffered much at the hands of evil because of the old wizards mistakes. He lost friends, he lost family and he lost the home he’d gained. In the end, however, he survived and was happy after a fashion.</p><p>That story is not this story.</p><p>In this story, the summer before he turns eleven, the boy is taken to London by his uncle along with his cousin. His uncle has just got a raise and wants to spend it on expensive electronics. His cousin is coming along, because he’s been promised a new video game. The boy is going, because his aunt is having her book club over and would rather that her despised nephew was out of the house. And besides, someone has to carry the bags.</p><p>In this story, the boy was denied dinner the night before because his aunt was in a bad mood and took it out on the nearest convenient target. So after tramping around London after his uncle and cousin, the boy is very very tired.</p><p>He trips.</p><p>He trips and the heavy bag he was carrying, containing the very new, very expensive electronic equipment, goes flying. It lands with a loud crash, the contents very clearly smashed beyond repair.</p><p>In this story, the boy’s uncle loses his temper. He loses it so badly and shouts and roars so loudly and so angrily that the boy is terrified. Because he can see murder in the man’s eyes as his uncle walks towards him.</p><p>In this story, Harry Potter turns and runs for his life, because he is very much afraid that if his uncle catches him that he might just kill him.</p><p>He turns and runs and doesn’t look back. His uncle doesn’t catch him. Eventually, while Vernon Dursley calls his wife in a panic to explain that the dratted boy is gone and he, Vernon, has no idea how to find him,  Harry Potter ends up outside an old bookshop in Soho. He is cold and tired and hungry and it’s starting to get late.</p><p>While Petunia Dursley is cursing and shrieking at her husband to call the police and find the dratted boy immediately because she cannot afford for a certain wizard to find out that her nephew is missing, Harry Potter is trying the door of the bookshop.</p><p>In this story, while Petunia and Vernon Dursley are having extremely well deserved panics at the thought of anyone in authority finding out how they’ve been treating him, Harry Potter enters the old bookshop and meets a very big snake.</p><p>The very big snake is intrigued by the appearance of a young magical human who can speak the language of the serpent and says so. Harry Potter denies having any magic, because he is just Harry.</p><p>The very big snake, who is a very, very old demon, is very alarmed when halfway through their conversation Harry’s exhaustion catches up with him and the boy faints mid-sentence.</p><p>The last thing Harry sees that evening before his vision goes dark and he collapses, is the very big snake changing into a very lanky red-headed man.</p><p>In this story the Demon Crowley, Serpent of Eden, recognises a very badly treated child when he sees one. He is outraged, because despite his demonic nature he is genuinely fond of children. So he catches the fainting boy in his arms and carries him upstairs to the bedroom in the flat above the shop and tucks the child in.</p><p>In this story, Crowley spends the rest of the evening sitting in the chair next to the bed and trying to figure out what he’s going to the tell the owner of the bookshop when he gets back.</p><p>After all, there’s really no good way to explain to an angel that you’ve decide to kidnap a child for his own good.</p><p>Still, Crowley has six-thousand years worth of experience in talking Aziraphale, Guardian of the Eastern Gate of Eden, into going along with Crowley’s less than saintly ideas. He’s sure he can manage it again.</p>
