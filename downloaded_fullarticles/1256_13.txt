  <span>"Sirius," the baby said and Sirius looked at Remus as if he had just won the Quidditch World Cup.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus knew Sirius would get so full of himself, it was typical of his boyfriend to take something small and make a big deal out of it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I think this makes it official, I'm Harry's favorite uncle"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"He probably just meant to say cereal"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"You're just jealous because he likes me more than you."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You know this is not a competition right?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"You're only saying that because I won and you lost"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Don't be ridiculous," Remus said and rolled his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And on his next visit to the Potter house he spent half an hour trying to make Harry learn to say Remus without much success.</span>
