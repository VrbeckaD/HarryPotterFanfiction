  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>They say even if a child is separated from their mother at birth, they can still recognize her voice. Do you think it's true?</em>
</p><p>It was a bright, sunny day and the heavens were a light azure without a single cloud. Looking out over the beach where the sea and the sky met, it looked as if two oceans were blended together endlessly. Sirius thought it was almost impossible to tell where one ended and the other began.</p><p>Little Harry, the newest addition to the Potter's household, was peacefully asleep in his arms. To everyone present he looked like a perfect Angel, his messy black framed his soft but striking features. Padfoot had said this the first he had seen his Godson, but he was going to say it again. Harry was going to be a heartbreaker. And everybody knew it. Lily and James were deep in conversation with Remus, buzzing with excitement for the soon arrival of their second child. As Lily was six months pregnant with their second son.</p><p>Tiny emerald eyes flattered open, and searched eagerly for a familiar face.</p><p>"Hey, pup!"</p><p>Harry stared at him and started to giggle, he was extremely fond of his Godfathers, but Sirius secretly hoped he was the favourite. Sitting Harry up in his arms, the little boy blinked awake and yawned. Everyone turned their attention to the pair, and Lily cooed as Harry reached out for her.</p><p>"It's late, I think we should be getting back James," sighed Lily.</p><p>"Come on, lils just a little longer, please," James pleaded.</p><p>Lily frowned playfully, shaking her head. "James stop acting like a child, Harry needs to go home, it's getting late for him."</p><p>"Lils-"</p><p>"Don't lils me, James Potter,” she chided and looked at Harry in Sirius’ arms to Moony. “Lupin, thank you so much for inviting us, I'm so glad you finally found a nice place. But we really need to get going."</p><p>"It's okay, Lily I'm just happy to see you, James and Harry. It's been so long." Remus nodded.</p><p>James smiled at his wife and good friend. "Yeah, me too, Moony."</p><p>“You’re right, I should be going too.” Sirius sighed as he handed Harry back to Lily then hugged James and Lupin goodbye. With a quick mischievous smirk, Padfoot apparated to a safe house. Lily kissed Lupin on the cheek before she too apparated to Godric’s hollow with Harry safely in her arms.</p><p>"Goodbye, mate."</p><p>"Be careful, Prongs. With the prophecy and everything, keep them both save."</p><p>"I will." James said without a hint of conviction. “After all, Harry may be the only the one who can stop this war. . .” His strong voice drifting off sadly.</p><p>“I know, James, I know. But just take care.”</p><p>“Goodbye, Remus.” James whispered before he too apparated home.</p><p>Little did James know, the sight that met him would haunt his for the rest of his life.</p><p align="center">

  <em>20 MINUTES EARLIER</em>
</p><p>Dumbledore sat behind his desk in his office at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. He closed his mid-night blue eyes and sighed.</p><p>
  <em>‘The Potters are crucial in this War. I hope they survive this, I hope the Prophecy is true, I hope. . . I wish they remain safe through these dark times.’</em>
</p><p>Their first child, Harry, had been born at 11:59 on the last day of July. <em>As the seventh month ends</em>.</p><p><em>‘He is the chosen one.’</em> Dumbledore pondered,<em> ‘not the Longbottom’s child. There can be no doubt.’</em> He was sure of it.</p><p>The Headmaster stole a glimpse at his trusted companion and chuckled, “You’ve seen better days, Fawkes.”</p><p>The bird let out a muffled chirp in rely, many of its feathers had blackened and it looked old and tried in his growing years.</p><p>“You’ll burn soon, my friend, and then it starts all over again.” Dumbledore smiled at the phoenix. “And you’ll be just as brilliant, as graceful, as elegant.”</p><p>Fawkes gave an approving nod before returning his attention to the door. And right on queue it swung open.</p><p>“Good evening professor Snape and what brings you here on his lovely night? I thought you would be celebrating with the Lord Voldemort and his others follows?” He added coldly.</p><p>Snape was out of breath, cheeks flustered and sweat dripping down his face. He looked as if he had run around the black lake, <em>twice</em>.</p><p>“Y-y-you have to save her-r. . .” He answered, choking on his own words. “You said you’d keep her save, but he plans to go after them- <em>tonight</em>.”</p><p>Dumbledore stood up and hurried over to a broken piece of mirror. “How long have you known?”</p><p>“Minutes. . .” He breathed.</p><p>“Go back now.” Albus ordered.</p><p>“Why? Why should I-”</p><p>“-before someone notices you’re missing.”</p><p>Snape paled at the thought and snarled. “<em>Fine</em>. But, save her, save Lily. . . <em>please</em>.” He whispered, barely audible as he left the room for the Death Eater’s hide out.</p><p>“I’ll try, Severus, I’ll try. . .”</p><p>Dumbledore looked into the mirror and clearly called their names, “James, Lilly?”</p><p>No answer. He tried again in a firmer tone. “James, Lily, please answer, this is important.”</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p><em>‘Maybe there out.’</em> Dumbledore thought as he remembered Sirius mentioning something about Remus finding a house on the isolated beaches in Scotland and added how it was, ‘Perfect for him to deal with his little furry moments.’ As Sirius had been so sensitive to imply.</p><p><em>‘They’re probably still there. I think Remus lives near John O Groats, I can warn them before they leave.’ </em>Dumbledore foolishly assumed and with that he apparated from the school grounds, a privilege only held by the Headmaster.</p><p><em>‘No wonder Snape had to run up here.’</em> He sighed, remembering how desperate the man had been, “if only Lilly understood. . .”</p><p align="center">

</p><p>Flames licked every inch of their beloved home as James stood there in complete and utter shock. He only came to his senses when a murky black shadow flew through the roof and hovered above the house for a second or two.</p><p>James’ Auror and Maraunder instincts shot into action as he started firing an assortment of spells and curses at the strange creature, yet it dodged them with ease. Nothing worked. The sound of snapping, crackling wood drew James’ rage to Godric’s Hollow. His house<em>, his home</em>, was falling apart. James could feel the heat from where he was standing.</p><p>“Lily,” he breathed it absolute disbelief and fear. . . before he bolted to the house, ignoring the creature as it flew away. “LILLY! LILLY? HARRY?”</p><p>James broke down the front and stared in horror at the carnage around him.</p><p>“James. . . James?” A soft voice, whisper brock through the flame-caked hallway.</p><p>“LILY? LILY? WHERE ARE YOU?!”</p><p>“. . .Over here. . .”</p><p>James ran into the lounge to find his Wife on the rubble were the sofa had been. “<em>Oh</em> Lily, Sweetheart, I’m so sorry, I should have been here.”</p><p>James picked her up gentle, bridal style.</p><p>“Lily. . .” He began quietly, “. . .where’s- where’s Harry?”</p><p>She lifted her head and hazel met deep emerald green as Lily started to cry. James knew, somehow, he just knew what Lily was going to say. He sprinted out of the house carrying his wife and laid her down on a grass bank opposite.</p><p>“Lily. . . ?” He started as he helped her sit up “What-”</p><p>“That thing,” she wailed, “t-that thing killed H-Harry, it must of. . . one- one minute he was in my arms, and the next he was. . . he was. . . gone.” She croaked.</p><p>James pulled Lily to his chest and stoked her head gently. “It’s okay, it’s okay. . .”</p><p><em>“No, it’s not okay!”</em> She cried. “Harry is dead and it’s my fault!”</p><p>James grabbed her shoulders and pulled her away, he looked at his wife with tears brimming in his eyes. “This was never your fault, Lily, this was Voldemort.”</p><p>She winced at the name.</p><p>“James, he could have killed me, but he wouldn't.” She frowned in confusion.</p><p>“What do you mean, Lily?”</p><p>“Because James. . . Because I'm pregnant, he said he wouldn’t take the life of something unborn. . .” She began to sob harder and curled into James’ arms. “My poor, poor Harry.”</p><p align="center">

</p><p>Sirius Black had been on edge since Lily decided to change their secret keeper to Peter. It just seemed off. Of course, he trusted Wormtail with his life, but Peter had been really jumpy lately, not that he wasn't always jumpy. Just more than usual and something was not right. Wormtail’s eyes were alight with regret and shame these past few days and he was nervous to talk to his supposed best friends.</p><p>He had informed James, told his best mate of his worries, but had quickly been dismissed Sirius' words.</p><p>So Sirius had been resolved to keep an eye on his James, Lily and Harry without them knowing. He wanted to make sure that they had gotten home safely.</p><p>After walking once around the sleeping town, Sirius made his way down Church Lane and saw the smoke. He ran to the Potter's house to find it ablaze with liquid-orange flames. In haste, Sirius grabbed a young looking Auror and began to shake him shoulders.</p><p>"What happened?! Where are my friends?!"</p><p>"I-I-I, Sir, the couple w-were taken to St-St.Mungos." He stuttered fearfully.</p><p>"Thank you." Sirius growled and apparated to the hospital, leaving the young man extremely confused.</p><p align="center">
