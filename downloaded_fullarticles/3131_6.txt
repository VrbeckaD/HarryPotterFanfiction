  <em>1820</em>

  <em>A slight breeze made the leaves in the old oak trees shiver. Light green, golden and brown, most of them still clung to their twigs, but a few let go and tumbled, tumbled, tumbled to the ground, nestling upon those who had fallen before them. Slowly, the autumn colours formed a soft carpet on top of the green mossy grass of the graveyard.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A young man walked down the gravel path, his riding boots worn out by the years, his tailcoat not quite in tune with the latest fashion, but well-kept and clean. The evening light did nothing to conceal the colour of his short hair: a fiery, fierce red. Gentlemen these days had means to conceal if they were unfortunate enough to have been born a redhead, but George Weasley had never been a gentleman and even though he had gladly abandoned the wig when it became more and more accepted to wear your own hair, he had no taste for the elegance and foppishness that was sported by the likes of Beau Brummel these days. Stiff neckcloths and curly hairdos were for those further upwards on the staircase of society. He might not be a poor man in a country that had its fair share of poverty, but he wasn’t rich either. He worked for his living as his father had done before him. As the gardener of Taverton Hall, he lived in a neat little cottage at the outer rim of the estate, a quiet, small and comfortable home.</em>

  <em>His footsteps fell heavier as he neared the huge metal gate that sealed the entrance to the Taverton burial vault. Generations of the Granger family had been interred in this chamber and it had only been a few days since the doors had opened again to welcome a new addition. He had brought a bunch of flowers, not the fancy roses and gardenias that he planted in the estate’s spacious garden area, but wildflowers from the fields further towards the woods. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>1798</p><p>Mr Weasley was walking towards the stately home in a brisk pace. His attire was as dapper as he could manage with what he had in his wardrobe. His wife had died giving birth to the twins. Mr Weasley had managed to raise the boys on his own with a little help from the handmaidens and the lady Granger who had doted on the children and made sure that they never lacked anything. Even though the Weasleys were mere servants to the Grangers, the families had always shared a deep friendship.</p><p>George had only recently had to say good bye to his brother Fred. Mrs Granger had a brother in the city who worked as a lawyer and had agreed to take the boy into his home to teach him and raise him to become his apprentice. Fred was a quick thinker and a bookish boy, much like his mother had been, whilst George came after his father, content to work in the fresh air, to nurture the little plants in the green houses and watch them grow into beautiful flowers. George had often felt like he was dumb in comparison to his twin, but Fred had always laughed when he said this aloud and told him that there was as much honour in knowing three languages as there was in knowing all the plant names and how herbs could be used as natural remedies.</p><p>Father and son walked up the steps at the back of the house where household staff usually entered the building. Upon crossing through the kitchen, they were greeted by a happy-looking Mrs Lovegood. The cook, a proper woman in her fourties, smiled widely and took Mr Weasley’s hand.</p><p>“It’s a young girl” she announced. “And she’s healthy and beautiful.”</p><p>Five minutes later, Mr Granger bid them to come in and have a look at the newborn baby. Mrs Granger was sitting up in a chair, holding a bundle of rags in her arms. Only when she signalled him to come closer and have a look did George see that there was a tiny wrinkly face in the linen sheets.</p><p>“Oh, isn’t she pretty?” exclaimed Mr Weasley happily.</p><p>George didn’t say a word. The baby looked very small and very wrinkly and very red. He had seen new born puppies that had been cuter than this weird, gnome-like creature. Just when he had thought that, he noticed the baby’s hand, tiny, but very clearly a hand with five fingers and minuscule fingernails. It was quite fascinating. He reached out to touch it and the baby immediately tightened its grip around his outstretched finger with much more force than he’d thought it capable of.</p><p>“Oh, look at that” Mr Weasley said. “She already made a friend.”</p><p>“You’ll be her friend, I am sure” Lady Granger noted with a weary smile on her face, stroking George’s red hair. “You’ll protect her from all the evil in the world, won’t you.”</p><p>George, flattered by the faith that was set in him, nodded: “Yes, I’m gonna look after her, Lady Granger.”</p><p>He studied the little face again. So tiny, so helpless.</p><p>“What’s her name?” he enquired.</p><p>Her mother smiled again.</p><p>“Hermione” she murmured. “Hermione Jean Granger.”</p>
