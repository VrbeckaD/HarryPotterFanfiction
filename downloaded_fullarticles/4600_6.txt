  <p>A stranger with your door key</p>
  <p>Explaining that "I'm just visiting".</p>

  <strong>(Remus the bookshop owner) </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Another normal day at work with a brief stop at the hipster cafe (that serves the best house special in town) next door.</p><p>People come and go, some buying stuff and some just wandering around because they were waiting for the infamous ice cream shop to open at 3PM down the street. Students come in groups of threes and fours after school to check on their favorite author's new release, Lily (my boss and my employee at the same time - yes, we are business partners) waltzing around picking up books of the same genre (today was crappy YA) and flipping through the pages.</p><p>"Remus, Twilight books aren't that bad."</p><p>"Remus, stop poking at the fortune cat statue!"</p><p>"Remus, do you know that half of the number of the students that frequent the bookshop is attracted to you and the other half to me?"</p><p>"Remus, what do you think about that guy?"</p><p>Under normal circumstances, we're usually pretty cheery unless Lily won't shut up about how perfect a certain customer is because he has dark blond hair and eyes with blue tints of any shade. That would result in my sulky appearance and Lily's bombarding session of 'What's wrong, Remussssssssss'.</p><p>Anyway, it was tolerable.</p><p>Although my job only requires dusting the bookshelves, receiving cash at the cash register, sweeping the floor which sometimes happen to have Lily's auburn hair, reading reviews, and placing orders for new releases, I would need a daily dose of caffeine to keep me alive until I'm off-duty at 10PM. Then I'll either refill my health meter (nerd alert) by going to The Cauldron (it's a late night coffee bar two streets away from my house where I met <em><u>the guy</u></em> from a week ago) and <strike>get wasted on</strike> drink decaffeinated coffee or going back home to make myself a cup of chamomile tea and read until I sleep. My life revolves around books. Hah.</p><p>I went for the third option. Grabbing brownies at Cauldron's, went home to enjoy it with chamomile tea and resumed the book I last left off.</p><p>-----</p><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>

  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>I don't know how to start this. 'Wish You Were Here' was playing on Spotify, I was cracking my knuckles while humming along to the catchy tone.</p><p>That was the song he left on the stereo when I realised that he was gone (I don't even know how he had access to my phone and it was connected to the speakers in my room).</p><p>Oh.</p><p>That was what I said when I realised that he was gone.</p><p>The smell of leftover pizza from yesterday reached my nose.</p><p>That was what he left in the microwave when I realised that he was gone.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>I said. Again. So it was real.</p><p>I looked at the coat rack near the porch. His leather jacket was still hanging on the top hook (I don't own any and out of curiosity and a little bit of sentiment I tried his on and apparently it betrayed my entire outfit, too much of a greaser).</p><p>That was days ago. He probably lives on the same street, I never asked. Which means I did NOT return him the jacket (it smelt of spearmint and freshwater, clean scents).</p><p>Strange how I never met him before. We live in the same area for God's sake.</p><p>-----</p><p> </p><p>And I'm findin' out that all I know is right at home</p><p>
  <strong>(<em>The</em> Encounter)</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>9.58PM, when Lily was out to her parents' house for a family dinner (for the whole day) </em>
</p><p>The lights at the back of the shop were switched off. This has become a norm for us (Lily and I, yes) since the electricity bill spiked last month because LED lights aren't as efficient in saving carbon release and money as we had expected it to be. I grabbed my bag from the locker, keys in my hand, ready to get off work. [At first, I don't get why Lily insisted on installing lockers for the both of us as we were the only people running the premise. We could just shove it or hang our belongings somewhere within our sight range but on its grand opening, Lily brought two boxes of miscellaneous stuff which turned out to be oversized band tees, an extra pair of <em>fireberry pink(FIREBERRY PINK! Oh goodness)</em> Air Max 90s, bathroom essentials and a guys' hoodie (probably James'). No wonder she wants one.]</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>10.01PM, when I was about to turn the key to lock the door</em>
</p><p>"WAIT!" A hand grabbed my right arm.</p><p>I turned around and saw a young man with dark hair and misty grey orbs, donned in a black leather jacket and a figure-hugging white V-neck along with faded skinny jeans, face in a shade of peach from all the running.</p><p>"Can I help you with anything, sir?" I asked politely. Does he want a book or something?</p><p>"Are you closing now?" He asked. <em>Duh. </em></p><p>"Yeah, would you mind coming back tomorrow? We open at 9:30 in the morning." I answered.</p><p>"It's urgent. Do you happen to have the very first edition of 'The Memoirs of A Geisha' on sale? Or rent?" He asked sincerely.</p><p>Historical fiction. Hmm. I pulled out the key and pushed the door open, flicking the fairy-lights on for minimal eletricity usage and visibility.</p><p>"It's beautiful." Black-haired-dude-with-nice-grey-eyes remarked.</p><p>"Thank you." I headed off to the historical section. I don't really remember having specifically the first edition of the book (that has a Geisha's silhoette on the left side of the cover)in the shop, does he mind having the one with the movie cover?</p><p>"I would prefer the first edition, if possible." He smiled. Am I thinking out loud?</p><p>"I'll try." I stepped up the wooden ladder to reach for the higher shelves of the 'Historical Fiction' section (because old books of that genre are stored there).</p><p>"Thanks. Sorry for bothering you."</p><p>"Nah, it's fine." No it's not. I'm dead beat. Double the workload because Lily is on leave.</p><p>Shit. Why is it not here? I stood still with my right palm against the sides of the books, index finger tapping along to my thoughts as I tried to recall what I did to the last copy (the last copy with the movie cover was sold out two weeks ago to a schoolgirl).</p><p>"Is it not there?" He asked from below.</p><p>"I'm afraid so. Do you really need the copy by tonight?" Because I think I have one (or maybe two, or three. I hoard books) at home.</p><p>"Sort of," He shrugged. "I was dared to get my friend the first edition for his birthday and his birthday is tomorrow."</p><p>"I think I might have a copy at home. Would you mind a hand-me-down?" I descended from the ladder.</p><p>"You do?" The grey in his eyes seemed to warm up a bit on the statement as he smiled.</p><p>
  <em>Remus' subconsciousness: HE'S FUCKING CUTE YEAH INVITE HIM TO YOUR HOUSE HE'S FUCKING CUTE AND JUST GIVE HIM THE BOOK ALREADY YOU ONLY READ IT ONCE IT IS STILL QUITE NEW REMUS REMUS REMUS LISTEN TO ME PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEE- *tuned out* </em>
</p><p>"Guess so. Would your friend mind?" "I don't think so. He just asked me to <em>get</em> one, not particularly a <em>new</em> one."</p><p>"Okay then. Would you mind waiting a while for me to get it from my flat? There's a pretty decent coffee house nearby. Tons, actually."</p><p>
  <em>Remus' subconsciousness: REMUS JOHN LUPIN WHY ARE YOU SO BLOODY STUPID JUST TAKE HIM HOME WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE YOU THINKI- *tuned out*</em>
</p><p>"Is your flat nearby?" He asked.</p><p>"A 10-minute walk from the junction?" I replied. Pretty near in my opinion.</p><p>"The colourful terraces?" How did he know?</p><p>"Um, yeah? Shouldn't be long if I-"</p><p>"I'll send you there."</p><p>
  <em>Remus' subconsciousness : ASDFGHJKLASDFGHJLASDFGHJKLASDFGHJKL*blacks out*</em>
</p><p>"You must be really urgent." I chuckled.</p><p>"Sort of." He grinned. "Let's go." He went out of the shop and ran his hand through his wavy black curls. Oh god.</p><p>
  <em>Remus' subconsciousness: *stays dead*</em>
</p><p>Wait. Didn't he reach here <em>on foot</em>?</p><p>"My bike is parked there. Come on." He gestured.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>
  <em>2 minutes later</em>
</p><p>"<em>'There'</em> , is pretty far away." I joked.</p><p>"Well, I don't think motorbikes are allowed in the area, so..." He trailed off.</p><p>"They are." I replied. "Cars, however, are not."</p><p>"Oh really? Here you go." A black helmet with a matte finish. And band stickers.</p><p>"Thanks." I climbed up the back seat. "You need directions?"</p><p>"Nope," He fastened his identical helmet beneath his chin. "I live there."</p><p>
  <em> Remus' subconsciousness : *resurrected* WTF? ERMAGADERMAGADERMAGADERMAGADERMAG-*tuned out*</em>
</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Interesting.</p>
