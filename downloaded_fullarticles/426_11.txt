    <p>Severus was temporarily blinded as light flooded his eyes, causing him to blink a few times while his pupils adjusted. He looked around in confusion and wondered why he was under the impression he was dying on the floor of the shrieking shack a second ago. He looked down at the piece of parchment in his hands, hoping to find a clue. ‘O.W.L. Defence against the dark arts’, he read, as his breath hitched and his heart stopped. <br/>‘No... no please no...’ he thought to himself. He looked over at the tree and sure enough, there were the last two people he wanted to see.  His pulse quickened as his mouth went dry... he started packing his bag as fast as possible and tried not to draw attention to himself. He held onto his wand for safety. He couldn’t understand what was happening and at the moment he didn’t care, all he cared about was getting out of the danger zone and going somewhere safe, potentially the library. He crouched behind the bush and slowly started sneaking backwards, never taking his eyes off Potter. He was almost out of Potter’s sight when he caught a flash of red light near the lake. He turned his attention there and saw Lily, who hadn’t noticed him yet, and was laughing along with another girl Severus didn’t care enough to see if he recognized. He stood up dropping his school bag forgetting what he was doing and walking towards Lily as if in a trance. He was halfway there before he heard the voice he dreaded the most: “Hey! Snivellus!” James yelled “expeliar-“ before he could complete the spell James’ and Sirius’s wands were shot out of their hands and into the hands of a smug Severus. James pointed at Severus, his mouth closing and opening like a fish. Severus gave them the slightest smirk, said, “sod off Potter,” and threw both of their wands somewhere in the grass. He continued walking toward Lily who had now turned her attention to him and was smiling at him. As Severus got closer Lily ran over and gave him a hug and Severus relished the warmth until Lily pulled away. He looked at the other girls and his heart throbbed as he realized who everyone was and his brain started going through how each of them would die. His eyes finally landed on the girl Lily had been talking to and Severus felt a stabbing pain in his heart as he stared into the hazel eyes of Alice Longbottom, although she wasn’t a Longbottom yet. Severus actually never learned her last name. <br/>“Sevy, that was awesome! How did you do that? Didn’t know you could disarm two people at once!” <br/>Severus gave an awkward laugh and rubbed the back of his neck, the same neck that moments ago was bleeding. “A friend taught me.”<br/>Lily tilted her head in disapproval. “One of your Slytherin friends?”<br/>Severus didn’t answer and Lily shook her head and opened her mouth to say something, but suddenly her attention turned to something behind Severus and she pulled him aside as a jet of yellow light shot passed them. Severus turned around and saw that James had found his wand while Sirius was still looking for his. He pushed Lily towards Alice and before Lily could react he pointed his wand at James and cast a jelly legs jinx which he easily ducked. Severus was trying to not cast any spells above fifth-year level, but he had a hard time remembering what was and wasn’t. He cast a few spells that caught James off guard. Sirius found his wand and joined the duel. Severus was taking them both easily. As the duel got more heated, more attention was gathered. Everyone was curious about who would win, popular James and Sirius or the slimy, greasy, Snivellus. Suddenly both James and Sirius stopped and smirked; before Severus could figure out what was happening he heard a squeak: “petrificus totalus”<br/>Severus’s body went rigid as he fell face first, followed by a chorus of laughter. He immediately started concentrating his magic to break the curse but as panic filled his stomach he found it harder to concentrate.<br/>“You gave us a lot of trouble Snivelly! I think you deserve a proper punishment.” Then James turned to the crowd: “WHO WANTS TO SEE ME TAKE SNIVELLY’S PANTS OFF!?” The crowd cheered and Severus started to have a full-blown mental break down, which of course no one noticed because of the body bind, he closed his eyes and desperately tried to catch his breath. He heard a levicorpus and felt himself be yanked up by his ankles. He kept his eyes closed and waited for it to be over. Embarrassment filled him as the laughter picked. He should have known this was too good to be true. He waited for the dreaded “STOP!” He didn’t need to open his eyes to recall the scene: the crowd parted as Lily pushed through. Potter tussling his hair. <br/>“Evans! Come to see the show? Sorry, the spell almost hit you, it was meant for Snivelly here!”  <br/>‘That’s different,’ Severus thought to himself.<br/>“Stop this and let him go!”</p>
<p>“Only if you go out with me!”<br/>“WHAT?!”<br/>“Come on Evans, go out with me and I’ll never lay a finger on old Snivelly again.” <br/>“You are an arrogant bullying toe rag and I wouldn’t go out with you even if the other option was the giant squid.”<br/>“Though luck Prongs.” Sirius smirked.<br/>At that moment, the body bind finally broke and Severus took the opportunity to let out a long string of curse words that would’ve made a sailor blush, some were so bad even Lily “the queen of swearing” Evans couldn’t stomach them. <br/>“Wow, snivells! Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? I think you need a nice cleaning after that! Scourgify!” <br/>Severus started coughing as bubbles started pouring out of his mouth and the bitter taste of the soap made him gag and choke a few times<br/>“STOP!” Lily practically screamed now wand in hand<br/>“Ah... Evans don’t make me curse you.”<br/>“Then take the curse off of him! What has he even done to you?!”<br/>“Well, it’s more of the fact that he exists really...” Severus spit some bubbles into James's face who had gotten a little too close and let out another string of curse words, all seeming to end with James and Sirius’s gruesome deaths. “Silencio!” Sirius said now, thoroughly annoyed, but that didn’t stop Severus who continued to scream and trash in silence. James raised his wand to cast another scourgify but was stopped by a jet of light that flew past his ear. “Next time I won’t miss Potter! Final warning, let. Him. Go.”<br/>James gave Lily an annoyed look and literally let Severus go leaving him to plummet towards the ground head first and only lily’s aresto momentum saved Severus from a concussion. <br/>“You’re lucky Evans was here to save you snivel-“<br/>“I DONT NEE-“<br/>Lily turned to look at him with one eyebrow raised and waited to see how he would finish his sentence. <br/>“You don’t need what Snivellus?” James asked<br/>“I don’t need saving from mediocre wizards who use second-year jinxes, Potter, go fuck yourself.”<br/>James opened his mouth to say something or curse Severus again but Lily stopped him <br/>“I SAID STOP! BOTH OF YOU!”<br/>And with that she grabbed Severus by the scruff of the neck, picked up his wand and bag and dragged him off</p>
