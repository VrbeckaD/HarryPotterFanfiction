Malfoy Manor, the Family Wing</em><br/>
<br/>
“Do you really think I’d wrap something illegal as a present and give it to my son?”<br/>
<br/>
“You might,” Harry said. “I seem to remember Draco giving a cursed necklace as a gift; seems like the sort of thing he’d learn from his mummy.”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa’s pale cheeks flushed. “If you’re done scanning the gifts for Dark magic, I’d appreciate if you’d leave us in peace.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll be back,” he promised.<br/>
<br/>

<em>June 5, 1999: 2:00 p.m.<br/>
Malfoy Manor, the Gardens</em><br/>
<br/>
“Watch where you fly on that broom,” Harry said. “If you fly off the grounds….” He pointed his wand threateningly at Draco’s chest.<br/>
<br/>
“I know the boundaries of the estate,” Draco spat, fingers clenching the handle of his broomstick.<br/>
<br/>
Harry grinned, pleased with Draco’s reaction. He’d known interrupting the git’s birthday would be worth it.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t think harassing my son is part of the terms of our house arrest,” Narcissa said, walking up behind Draco.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m just reminding him of where he’s allowed to go. Wouldn’t want him to get into trouble,” he chuckled, and watched as mother and son tried to control their irritation.<br/>
<br/>
When Narcissa spoke, there was no trace of the anger she felt in her voice. “What would you like to look at today, Mr. Potter?”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, I think I’d like <em>Draco</em> to show me the gardens.”<br/>
<br/>

Malfoy Manor, the Master Suite</em><br/>
<br/>
“Master, wake up!”<br/>
<br/>
“What?” Lucius snapped, glaring at the house-elf who had just tugged him awake.<br/>
<br/>
“Master, there is a man here to see you!”<br/>
<br/>
Lucius growled in anger. Potter delighted in finding new ways to annoy them, and middle of the night visits such as tonight’s were a current favorite.<br/>
<br/>
Did the boy <em>actually</em> think that he’d interrupt Lucius in the middle of something illegal if he showed up at night?<br/>
<br/>
“Show him in, Binky. I’ll be down in a minute.” Lucius would be damned if Potter would catch him in his nightclothes.<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa stirred, roused by the noise of him dressing. “Lucius?”<br/>
<br/>
He leaned over his wife and dropped a kiss on her forehead. “Potter’s here – I’ll take care of him. Go back to sleep, dear.”<br/>
<br/>
Lucius fixed a fake smile on his face as he went downstairs; inside he was fuming. Narcissa slept so rarely these days, and naturally Potter had to interrupt the one night of rest she was likely to get all week.<br/>

Malfoy Manor, the Foyer</em><br/>
<br/>
“Don’t Aurors keep decent hours?”<br/>
<br/>
Harry laughed. “Not when there are Dark witches and wizards to catch.”<br/>
<br/>
“My husband and I have renounced our ways,” Narcissa interjected and scowled slightly when Harry rolled his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t think you have. I think you’re just putting on a good face for the Ministry.”<br/>
<br/>
“What you think doesn’t —” Lucius started to say, but his wife cut him off smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
“What would you like to search tonight, Mr. Potter?”<br/>
<br/>

<em>March 2, 2001: 11:00 p.m.<br/>
Malfoy Manor, Draco’s Bedroom</em><br/>
<br/>
“Father, no!”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa halted outside her son’s room and pressed her ear to the door.<br/>
<br/>
“Please, not Daddy!”<br/>
<br/>
She sighed; Draco was having yet another nightmare. She opened the door and saw that her son was tangled in the sheets, fighting against the grip of the green cotton. “Draco,” she said, sitting on the bed. “Darling, wake up.”<br/>
<br/>
He came awake with a gasp, his grey eyes clouded with fear and wet with tears. Narcissa pressed a soothing hand to his sweaty forehead. “Shhh,” she murmured, pulling him into her arms. “Did you have another nightmare?”<br/>
<br/>
Draco nodded into her shoulder. They’d repeated this almost nightly for the past two and a half years; he’d been plagued by bad dreams ever since his release from Azkaban.<br/>
<br/>
“Did you take your potion?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes,” he pointed at the empty vial on the nightstand even though she couldn’t see it. “It isn’t working anymore, Mother.”<br/>
<br/>
She sighed and said, “I’ll have to see if I can make you something stronger. Next time I … go to Diagon Alley, I’ll see if I can get ingredients for Dreamless Sleep.” Narcissa hugged him and asked, “What nightmare was it tonight, Draco?”<br/>
<br/>
Draco shivered a little. He hated talking about his dreams. He knew they couldn’t hurt him, and he was too old to be frightened – but his nightmares weren’t about the evil dragon under the bed, like when he’d been five. These nights the dead, broken bodies of his parents flashed before his eyes, repeating over and over until he screamed his throat raw, and woke up clammy and sweaty.<br/>
<br/>
“It was Father,” he said, burrowing more deeply into his mother’s arms, like he had when he was a child. “He was … Nagini … the D-dark L-lord had her….”<br/>
<br/>

<em>March 2, 2001: 11:30 p.m.<br/>
Malfoy Manor, the Master Suite</em><br/>
<br/>
Lucius stirred when she slipped into their bed, rolling over sleepily to ask, “Another nightmare?”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa snuggled into her husband’s open arms, enjoying the warmth of his body after the chilly air of the manor. She’d been pacing the halls, as was her wont since the war, unable to sleep because of her own bad dreams. “Yes,” she said. “It was about you, tonight.”<br/>
<br/>
The two lay quietly for a few minutes, both lost in their own thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
“Lucius?”<br/>
<br/>
“Hmm?”<br/>
<br/>
“I can’t live like this anymore,” Narcissa said, turning to face her husband. “We have no respect. No privacy. Potter barges into our home whenever he feels like it, at any time of the day or night. I can’t leave the grounds without an escort. I can’t even go to get Draco potions without asking permission….”<br/>
<br/>
Lucius stroked his wife’s hair, trying to calm her down. “We only have to put up with it for another few months, dear. Then we can go back to our normal lives —”<br/>
<br/>
“Do you really think things will go back to normal, just like that?” Narcissa asked bitterly. “Our reputation is in ruins, Lucius. I’m insulted and jeered at everywhere I go; <em>you</em> refuse to leave the manor anymore because you can’t take it.” <br/>
<br/>
“We just have to endure it a little longer,” Lucius said.<br/>
<br/>
“I never thought I’d hear <em>Lucius Malfoy</em> telling me we have to endure the indignities imposed upon us by blood-traitors and Mudbloods,” she spat, pulling away from his embrace.<br/>
<br/>
Lucius sighed. They had this talk often and it never ended well. “Do you think I like it? Do you think I like simpering to Potter? Smiling like a fool and leading him around our home so he can stick his nose wherever he wants?” He ran his fingers through his long hair tiredly. “I hate it, Narcissa, but I’m not fool enough to argue when we escaped with our lives. A few years of house arrest and intrusions by Potter are a small price to pay for all of us avoiding Azkaban permanently.”<br/>
<br/>
“I know,” she said quietly. “I just … I want things back the way they were, Lucius. I want our real lives back.”<br/>
<br/>
“So do I.” He reached for his wife again, and she acquiesced, resting her head on his shoulder. “Go to sleep, dear. I’m sure Potter will show up bright and early tomorrow morning.”<br/>
<br/>

<em>March 3, 2001: 9:00 a.m.<br/>
Malfoy Manor, the Foyer</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>Knock. Knock.</em><br/>
<br/>
“Good morning, Mr. Potter.”<br/>
<br/>
“Malfoy,” Harry acknowledged, stepping inside the doorway, with Hermione Granger following. “I’m here for a surprise search.”<br/>
<br/>
Lucius nodded. Potter showed up often for his ‘surprise searches,’ hoping to catch the Malfoys looking through some Dark spellbook or using some Dark artifact. In the past two and a half years, Potter hadn’t found anything – not one single item – but he hadn’t given up. Lucius knew the boy wouldn’t either; Potter was far too determined for his own good.<br/>
<br/>
“Do come in, Mr. Potter, Miss Granger,” Narcissa said glibly, gliding down the marble staircase to join Harry and Lucius in the foyer. “How can we help you today?”<br/>
<br/>
“I want to examine the cellars,” Harry said. “And Hermione would like to use the library while I look around, and then she can take Narcissa to Diagon Alley.”<br/>
<br/>
Lucius’s lips drew tight at the informal way Potter referred to his wife, but he nodded. “Of course. This way,” he said, unnecessarily – Potter knew their house almost as well as he did by now.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<em>March 3, 2001: 2:00 p.m.<br/>
Malfoy Manor, the Foyer</em><br/>
<br/>
“Where do you need to go today, Mrs. Malfoy?” Hermione asked politely.<br/>
<br/>
“Just the apothecary – I need asphodel and valerian.” Narcissa slipped a heavy cloak around her shoulders and fastened the silver clasp. She pointedly set her wand on an antique table in the entry hall; they weren’t allowed to take their wands when they left the grounds.<br/>
<br/>
Hermione led the way outside, and held out her arm for Narcissa. She Apparated them to Diagon Alley. “You’re making sleeping potions?”<br/>
<br/>
“I thought I would brew some Dreamless Sleep, but I don’t have asphodel or valerian growing in the gardens.” She sighed, reminded of yet another annoyance in their new life – she’d never imagined she’d be forced to grow her own potions ingredients.<br/>
<br/>
On their way out of the apothecary, Hermione asked, “Do you mind if we stop at Flourish and Blotts? I wouldn’t ask normally, but since we’re already here….”<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t mind,” Narcissa said.<br/>
<br/>
She felt the usual cold looks as they walked to the bookshop. People never tired of seeing Narcissa Malfoy doing her shopping in the company of a guard. But she refused to be affected by the stares and walked with her head high, even when she heard someone mutter, <em>“Snake-loving bitch.” </em><br/>

<em>March 3, 2001: 11:30 p.m.<br/>
Malfoy Manor, the Master Suite</em><br/>
<br/>
Lucius was waiting for her when she returned to their room that night. “How’s Draco?”<br/>
<br/>
”He’s fine tonight, fortunately.”<br/>
<br/>
“I started the base for Dreamless Sleep earlier, so if you finish it tomorrow, he’ll have it for the next night.”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa draped her silver silk robe over a chair. “I just hope it works. So many nightmares. It’s not healthy.”<br/>
<br/>
“He will be fine, dear. He’s a Malfoy.”<br/>
<br/>
She turned so quickly to face him the hem of her satin chemise flared out about her knees. “<em>You</em> still wake up screaming, some nights.”<br/>
<br/>
“I was there for much longer, Narcissa,” he reminded her. “And I had – have – you to comfort me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Maybe I’ll invite Pansy for our next visiting allowance,” she mused, tapping a slender finger against her lips as she thought. “She’d be happy to ‘comfort’ Draco. And I’d like to talk with her.”<br/>
<br/>
Lucius looked at his wife. “What would you have to talk about with <em>that</em> girl?”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa started pacing their bedroom, walking back and forth before the fire. “I’ve been thinking. When I was in Diagon Alley today —”<br/>
<br/>
His stomach rolled. He’d been waiting for this; they <em>always</em> fought when she went out. “Yes?” he asked cautiously.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh don’t act like that, Lucius,” she snapped. “At least <em>I</em> have the courage to go out and put up with it.”<br/>
<br/>
“As you often remind me,” he muttered, and she glared at him. “Narcissa, you’re sick of it. I’m sick of it. But do we really have to fight about it every night? We have it pretty good considering —”<br/>
<br/>
Lucius quailed as the intensity of her stare ratcheted; her blue eyes reminded him of sharply cut sapphires.<br/>
<br/>
“Since when has ‘pretty good’ been enough for <em>you</em>, Lucius?”<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it, Narcissa! What do you want me to <em>do</em>?”<br/>
<br/>
She stopped pacing and stood facing him, her hands on her hips. “Make things right again, Lucius! Like you did after the first war.”<br/>
<br/>
“I can’t!” He shook his head exasperatedly. “I can’t claim the Imperious like I did then – everyone knows we acted of our free will this time. But it’s not <em>that</em> bad … we’re alive, we’re not in Azkaban for life, and soon we’ll be done with the house arrest too. Just a few more months, Narcissa.”<br/>
<br/>
He was startled to see tears filling her eyes, and his heart softened. “Come here,” Lucius said, patting the spot beside him.<br/>
<br/>
“What is it?” He wrapped his arms around his wife and pulled her close.<br/>
<br/>
“I should … I … I can’t put up with the insults anymore. The … the … they should <em>respect</em> me, but they don’t.” Narcissa sobbed into his shoulder, and Lucius was momentarily shocked.<br/>
<br/>
His wife had been a pillar of strength through their entire ordeal – from when the Dark Lord had taken up residence in their manor until their arrest and subsequent release from Azkaban. She had kept him and Draco civil toward Potter, had dealt with every indignity that had come their way – and <em>now</em> she was breaking?<br/>
<br/>
“Shh,” he said awkwardly, gently patting her heaving back. “Shhh. We’ll get through this, Cissa.”<br/>
<br/>
<em>Ding. Ding. </em><br/>
<br/>
His wife stiffened in his arms – the light bell was an alert that Draco was having a bad dream. “Do you want me to go?” Lucius asked.<br/>
<br/>
“No,” Narcissa said, wiping tears off her face with the back of her hand. “He’s used to me.”<br/>
<br/>
Lucius sighed at the absurdity of it – they were talking about their twenty-year-old son as if he were a baby. “I’ll wait up,” he said, watching as Narcissa charmed her tear-blotchy skin back to its usual paleness and shrugged into her robe.<br/>

<br/>
“I went down to check the potion,” Lucius said by way of greeting when Narcissa came back from Draco’s room. “It will definitely be ready after you add the asphodel and valerian.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thank you, Lucius.”<br/>
<br/>
Her voice was oddly stiff, and Lucius looked closely at his wife. Was she still upset from their earlier argument? “Narcissa? I really do wish I could put things right,” he said softly.<br/>
<br/>
“Would you help me?” She pulled back the sheets and climbed into bed.<br/>
<br/>
“What?”<br/>
<br/>
“Would you help me? If I wanted to make things right?” Narcissa turned toward her husband. “Would you support me, Lucius?”<br/>

<br/>
Knock. </em><br/>
<br/>
“Please come in, Pansy.”<br/>
<br/>
“Hello, Mrs. Malfoy,” Pansy said, craning her neck around the other woman to look for Draco.<br/>
<br/>
“Draco will be down in a moment, dear. And please, call me Narcissa.”<br/>
<br/>
Pansy’s eyes widened in surprise; Mrs. Malfoy had never been anything more than coolly polite to her. “How have you been … Narcissa?” she asked awkwardly.<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa laughed lightly, trying to set Pansy at ease. Narcissa needed the girl to be comfortable around her. “Oh, as well as can be expected,” she said airily. “How are your parents doing, and yourself?”<br/>
<br/>
“Er, we’ve been alright.” Pansy heard footsteps pounding down the stairs, and looked up to see Draco coming down. “Draco!” she called, relieved to see her boyfriend.<br/>
<br/>
“Hi, Pansy,” he said.<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa waved her hand at them and said, “I’m sure you two have plenty two talk about; Draco can tell you about the trip we’re planning for him. I’ll have Binky bring up some tea.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thank you, Mother.” <br/>
<br/>
Draco and Pansy turned to go up to his room, but Narcissa said, “Pansy, I’d like to talk with you before you leave.”<br/>
<br/>
Pansy glanced at Draco, but he shrugged cluelessly. “Er, okay.” <br/>

<em>March 30, 2001: 6:00 p.m.<br/>
Malfoy Manor, the Library</em><br/>
<br/>
“Narcissa?” Pansy tapped hesitantly on the doorframe of the library, and the older woman looked up from her book.<br/>
<br/>
“Take a seat, Pansy.”<br/>
<br/>
Pansy sat obediently and looked at Narcissa. She was quite uncomfortable; Draco’s mother had never asked to speak to her alone, and she wondered what the woman wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa folded her hands over her book and said, “Did you have a good visit with Draco?” She pointedly ignored Pansy’s rumpled skirt, knowing exactly how the girl had ‘comforted’ her son.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, yeah … he told me you’re sending him to France in September?”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa nodded. “Yes, his father and I think he needs a holiday to shake off the last three years. It’s not healthy for him to be cooped up on the estate for so long.”<br/>
<br/>
“No, it’s not!” Pansy agreed immediately. “I still can’t believe the Ministry sentenced you to house arrest for three years. How do you put up with Potter sticking his slimy nose in whenever he feels like it?”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa’s eyes narrowed as she answered, “It’s not easy. But Lucius likes to remind me that we were lucky to escape life in Azkaban. You spent some time in there yourself, didn’t you?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes,” Pansy spat viciously. “All because I wanted to turn Potter in to the Dark Lord.”<br/>
<br/>
“Would you like to get him back for that, Pansy?” Narcissa asked softly.<br/>
<br/>
Pansy stared at her, mouth gaping open. “Get back at him?” she repeated dumbly.<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa nodded. “Yes. Potter doesn’t show me – us – the respect we deserve. Would you like to get revenge on him for what he did to you?”<br/>
<br/>
“Just tell me what to do,” Pansy said, her brown eyes glittering with excitement.<br/>

<br/>
“Good afternoon, Mr. Potter.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry mumbled a greeting and walked into the marbled entryway. Narcissa looked behind him for Hermione, but didn’t see the young witch. “Is Hermione coming today?”<br/>
<br/>
“No, she’s sitting her N.E.W.Ts this week and next,” Harry said.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh.” Narcissa’s shoulders slumped. “What would you like to search today?”<br/>
<br/>
“The library,” he said, kicking his shoe against the stone floor. “Er, did you need to go somewhere?”<br/>
<br/>
Her stomach churned when she said, “Diagon Alley.” She <em>hated</em> having to ask <em>Potter</em> to take her. But she would do anything for her son, and he needed more Dreamless Sleep.<br/>
<br/>
“Potions ingredients?” When she nodded, Harry said, “I … I could take you, when I’m done here.”<br/>
<br/>
“I would appreciate that, Mr. Potter.”<br/>

<em>June 6, 2001: 4:30 p.m.<br/>
London, Diagon Alley</em><br/>
<br/>
They were walking down the street, headed for the apothecary, when Narcissa overheard a voice say, “Just who does she think she is? Strolling down the street like she owns the place.”<br/>
<br/>
“Mmm,” someone else agreed.<br/>
<br/>
“The bitch belongs in Azkaban, along with that damn husband and pathetic son of hers.”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t know how they escaped that,” the other person said.<br/>
<br/>
“Harry said she helped him somehow, but that’s not good enough for me. They’re worthless, the whole lot … I’d chuck them in Azkaban faster than you could blink if it were up to me.”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa’s ears perked, and she finally recognized the first voice. It was Ginevra Weasley. Harry Potter’s fiancée.<br/>
<br/>
Harry continued down the street as if he hadn’t heard his girlfriend, and Narcissa’s eyes narrowed in anger. So Potter hadn’t told her that Narcissa had saved his life? That she’d changed the course of the battle?<br/>
<br/>
She gritted her teeth in annoyance; she’d <em>known</em> his nicer attitude was too good to be true.<br/>
<br/>
And just like that, another piece of her plan clicked into place.<br/>

<br/>
“Mummy, nooooo!” </em><br/>
<br/>
Narcissa’s heart was in her throat when she pushed open Draco’s door. The alarm had alerted her that he was having another nightmare, and she’d rushed to his room. The Dreamless Sleep potion had apparently quit blocking his night terrors.<br/>
<br/>
If the volume of his cries was any indicator, he was having a <em>very</em> bad dream.<br/>
<br/>
“Draco,” she leaned over him and put a hand on his damp, sweaty forehead. “Darling, wake up. Mummy’s here, dearest.”<br/>
<br/>
His grey eyes latched on hers as he woke up. “Mother?” His voice was ragged.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m here, dear. See? I’m alive.” She fixed his knotted and tangled sheets and sat beside her son. “What did you dream, darling?”<br/>
<br/>
He crawled into her open arms. “I … Voldemort … he … it was the Killing Curse, Mother. At you. Because I … I failed.”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa hugged him and made soothing noises in his ear. “He’s gone, Draco. He can’t hurt me, or you, anymore.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh Mum, I wish I was strong like you,” Draco whispered, and her heart broke.<br/>

“Lucius?”<br/>
<br/>
He looked at his wife over the top of <em>The Daily Prophet. </em>“Mmhm?”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m going through with this whether you help me or not, but I <em>would</em> appreciate your assistance.” Narcissa’s eyes were flinty and dark blue, her arms crossed determinedly across her chest.<br/>
<br/>
“What?” Lucius racked his brain, trying to remember what she was talking about. His wife had an annoying habit of continuing a conversation from where they’d last left off, which usually left him scrambling to recall what she was talking about. “<em>Oh. </em>Right.”<br/>
<br/>
He folded the newspaper and took a sip of tea, and then asked petulantly, “Will I have to touch her?”<br/>
<br/>
“Only if you want to.”<br/>

<br/>
“You,” said the Dark Lord, pointing his wand at her. She shrieked when a hex stung her cheek. “Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa crept toward the boy lying on the forest floor, and knelt next to him, her knees sinking into the leaves and dirt. She touched his face and felt warm flesh and his breath ghosting over her hand. She slipped a hand under his shirt, and felt his heart thumping solidly against her palm.<br/>
<br/>
He</em> wasn’t <em>dead.<br/>
<br/>
Her fingernails dug into his chest as she tried to think what to do. Should she say he was alive? What would the Dark Lord do? Would he take out his anger on Potter’s survival on her? Or would he finally finish the brat off once and for all? Most importantly, where was Draco?<br/>
<br/>
“My Lord … he is —”</em><br/>
<br/>
“Narcissa! Wake up!” Lucius shouted at his wife, trying to rouse her from an apparent nightmare. He leaned over her and then yelped when she hit him in the nose with a flailing arm.<br/>
<br/>
“Wake up!” He grabbed her and shook her roughly, careful to avoid her arms this time.<br/>
<br/>
When she woke, Lucius was surprised to see her eyes were glassy with tears. “Darling,” he said softly, pulling her onto his lap. “Darling, what’s wrong?”<br/>
<br/>
“I dreamt of what I did wrong.” <em>That</em> was <em>her</em> nightmare. The one wrong step she’d made in the forest, the moment that had turned her world upside down. She was constantly plagued with what-ifs. What-if she hadn’t said Potter was dead? What-if she hadn’t lied to the Dark Lord?<br/>
<br/>
Although she hadn’t known it, Draco had been safe in Hogwarts, and she needn’t have lied to protect her son….<br/>
<br/>
What-if the Dark Lord had won? Surely she and her family would have been forgiven for their past failures, and they would have been at his right hand.<br/>
<br/>
They would have been secure in their place in the new world order, instead of where they were now. Forced to bow and scrape to the Ministry and <em>Potter. </em>Forced to hide their true selves with simpering copies who were oh-so-happy to open their house anytime <em>Potter</em> wanted to sniff around for something illegal. Forced to put up with lesser people slandering them and showing no respect for <em>what she’d done. </em><br/>
<br/>
Her son still had nightmares from his month and a half in Azkaban, her husband had been reduced to a lesser version of himself, and she … <em>she</em> put up with everything to keep her family intact and together.<br/>
<br/>
No more.<br/>
<br/>
She would not be forced to beg for grace from them anymore.<br/>
<br/>
She would have her revenge.<br/>
<br/>
“Narcissa?” Lucius said quietly, breaking into her reverie. He’d seen the thoughts flash across her face, and knew what she was thinking. He planted a gentle kiss on her forehead and said, “I’m with you, darling.”<br/>
<br/>
He didn’t see the smile of triumph that curved her lips.<br/>

<em>August 20, 2001: 2:00 p.m.<br/>
Malfoy Manor, Narcissa’s Study</em><br/>
<br/>
“Do I really have to make an Unbreakable Vow?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes. Why? Are you worried about breaking it?”<br/>
<br/>
Pansy stared at her shoes and mumbled, “Well, no —”<br/>
<br/>
“Good. There’s nothing to worry about then,” Narcissa said crisply. “Just think of it as an added precaution, dear.”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa held out her hand and Pansy reluctantly took it. Lucius stepped closer to the two women and took out his wand; he would be their Bonder.<br/>
<br/>
“Do you, Pansy Parkinson, agree to keep our plan a secret?”<br/>
<br/>
“I do.”<br/>
<br/>
A blue flame slid from the tip of Lucius’s wand and wrapped around their linked hands.<br/>
<br/>
“Do you agree to carry out any and all orders I may give you?”<br/>
<br/>
“I do,” Pansy said again.<br/>
<br/>
A glowing red chain joined the blue flame, turning the light around their hands purple. Narcissa and Pansy watched as the flames twined about their fingers and then disappeared in a puff of violet smoke.<br/>
<br/>
“Excellent,” Narcissa said and let go of Pansy’s hand. “Now we can discuss the details.”<br/>
<br/>
Lucius and Narcissa sat down across from the young witch, who squirmed under their twin gazes. She still wasn’t used to Draco’s parents treating her as an equal, and while it was flattering – and promising, considering her wish to become part of their family – it was rather unsettling.<br/>
<br/>
“What do you think would hurt Potter the most?” Narcissa asked.<br/>
<br/>
Pansy chewed on her lower lip as she thought. “Uhm, he likes the Weasleys, doesn’t he? But I thought we were going to get back at Potter, not someone else.”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa laughed, a light ringing sound that filled the study. “Pansy dear, I thought you were a Slytherin? Surely you understand the value of being devious rather than obvious? Which would hurt Potter more, being hurt himself or losing someone he loves?”<br/>
<br/>
Pansy shifted in her chair. “I do know,” she said hotly. “His fiancée then? That’s all <em>The Daily Prophet </em>covers anymore, the upcoming wedding of the ‘heroic Auror and his Quidditch star girlfriend.’ It’s utter trash these days; I’d rather read <em>The Quibbler. </em>”<br/>
<br/>
“Very good,” Lucius said, nodding approvingly. <br/>
<br/>
“She hates you anyway, Ginny does. She’s always going on about how you’re a bitch and belong in Azkaban….” Pansy trailed off as she realized what she said, and the tips of her ears turned red in embarrassment.<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa waved a careless hand. “Don’t worry, dear. I’m well aware of what she thinks of me; she’s certainly made no secret of it. That’s why she’s the one.”<br/>
<br/>
“The next Holyhead Harpies game is on September 4,” Lucius said. “That’s when you’re going to act….”<br/>
<br/>

Malfoy Manor, the Master Suite</em><br/>
<br/>
“How is he tonight?”<br/>
<br/>
“I tried a new variation on the Dreamless Sleep potion; the apothecary recommended adding maypop when I bought herbs today. She thought it would help block his nightmares; I added it to a vial and it seems to be working.”<br/>
<br/>
Narcissa pulled back the sheets and slipped into bed beside her husband. Lucius saw that her eyes were sparkling, and that she was not as wan as she usually was after returning from Draco’s room. In fact, she looked positively radiant; her eyes were light blue with happiness and when she snuggled next to him, pressing against his groin, Lucius knew he’d made the right choice.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re feisty tonight,” he remarked and lightly nipped her ear.<br/>
<br/>
“Mmm,” Narcissa purred throatily and tilted her hips suggestively against his lower half.<br/>
<br/>
With a growl Lucius rolled on top of her, his hands pushing the thin straps of her satin chemise off her shoulders. He leaned down and nibbled on her neck, aiming for the exact spot that would make her whimper for him, and whimper she did, arching up into the warmth of his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
They made love that night with more ardour and passion than they’d felt in almost five years. Both were excited and turned on by knowing that Ginevra Weasley was sleeping below them, drugged and trapped in the Malfoy dungeons.<br/>
