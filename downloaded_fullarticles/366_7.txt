    <p>Hermione Granger grimaced as she was jostled again in the crowd holding her beige purse a bit more firmly. The bar, Odyssey, wasn’t really a club, but it looked like one tonight. The music thrummed louder tonight, dim chandelier lighting cast a warm glow on the open dance floor, unusually crowded this evening. It was a relatively new place, nestled in London near the ministry, magically obscured from muggle view. The building was a pleasant blend of modern and traditional, the cream stone walls reminiscent of Greek architecture. Large paintings of ocean scenes, moving portraits of gods and goddesses, scenes from mythic tales hung on the high walls. A well-stocked bar with a sleek counter lined one wall, tables lining the other three in the large space, the corners decorated with tall classical statues and small raised beds of shrubbery.</p>
<p>Smoke drifted down from an upper level balcony used for a gaming area where people were smoking, laughing and playing cards, billiards and darts. The ambiance was chaotic but elegant, and far outside what she would normally think of as a fun evening, but, her group of friends, and her boyfriend, had spoken and so she went without complaint.</p>
<p>Speaking of which… where were they anyway?</p>
<p>Hermione moved out of the way as a group pf people dancing a much too animated version of the macarena bumped into a sharply dressed waiter that was passing her, carrying a tray of iced margarita glasses filled with shrimp cocktail. The waiter steadied the tray expertly, but not before two of the glasses clanked aggressively together sending a small spritzing of cocktail sauce propelling out of the glass. Looking down with a sigh at the dark red flecks marring the pale pink chiffon of her knee length halter dress, she took out her wand and quickly scourgified them away.</p>
<p>She could understand the need for revelry. It had only been two years after the war ended, but progress had been made. Most Death Eaters rounded up, trials concluded, damaged buildings repaired, wands restored, people freed, healed, restored to their families where they could, charities set up to help those injured, obliviated or children abducted, and a total purge of the ministry, with Kingsley elected firmly and democratically into the minister’s seat.</p>
<p>Though there was still much to be done, there had been a collective sigh of relief among society, an uptick in celebratory fervor. It was like the Wizarding World’s very own roaring 20s and it was easy to get caught up in it at times. People were more relaxed, less serious, more apt to throw caution to the winds. The rash of weddings in the last year and a half had poured more galleons into catering, wedding boutiques, flower shops and jewelers had been more than the previous five years combined. </p>
<p>Not to mention an absolute boom of “war babies” as the papers were referring to them as.<br/>
Hermione couldn’t fault them. Death and angst had hung so heavy for so long, and this winter had been particularly long, cold and bleak. Lupercalia, once an obscure observance in their society, practiced these days only by a handful of strict traditionalist proponents of ancient festivities, it had this year seemed to have been launched into the mainstream, and mixed heavily with muggle Valentine’s Day celebrations. That irked her more studious side. Valentine’s Day was one day, and ancient Lupercalia only a few more than that. This sudden modern fascination had been turned into a second Christmas almost, with events and festivities throughout the fortnight. But she wouldn’t begrudge anyone their fun or spoil it with technicalities and historical factoids no one really cared about.</p>
<p>Hermione didn’t regret for a moment returning to school to finish her education, or joining the ministry to begin work on reforms immediately after, but she did wonder how it would feel to truly throw it all to the winds, and to lose complete control. At least for a little while…</p>
<p>Hermione slipped past the mob of dancers and pressed her back against the pillar, a little overwhelmed, but brightened with a sigh of relief when she spotted her friends doing jello shots at a high table in the corner. She made her way quickly to them and was only a few paces when Ginny looked up and greeted her animatedly, glass raised, light dancing off the green sequined cocktail dress she sported. </p>
<p>“Hermione, you made it!” </p>
<p>Hermione smiled as Ginny hopped out of her chair and the girls kissed each other’s cheeks.<br/>
“I did! Had a time of it though, this place is busy!”</p>
<p>Ginny passed her a jello shot, which she enjoyed immediately and slid up onto an empty chair as Harry, Neville, Luna, Seamus Finnigan and – oi vey – Lavender Brown all shifted in to free the one on the end. She settled in comfortably, took another jello shot from the cluttered tray and looked in surprise at the generous array of grilled oysters, calamari rings, and stuffed mushrooms. No simple bar food to be found here, she supposed. </p>
<p>“Yeah, had no idea it would be this packed when we picked it.” Harry said looking around though. “Nice place though.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a bit new,” Luna pointed out in her breathy, sing songy voice. “Its only natural people will want to come see it.”</p>
<p>“And its no wonder.” Lavender said conspiratorially, looking up from a ridiculously flamboyant fruit drink with umbrellas and spears of sugared fruit. She lowered her voice to a barely audible hiss. “They have <em>private</em> rooms here to rent -ahem – by the evening. Exotic refreshments and aphrodisiac potions at no extra charge.” </p>
<p>She gave Seamus an appallingly exaggerated wink and he cleared his throat, looking very much like he knew where that conversation was going to head to and was <em>not</em><br/>
pleased about it…</p>
<p>“Uh, they also do event catering!” Neville said quickly, raising a mint julep. “I saw a huge banquet room off the back, people can reserve them for parties and meetings.”</p>
<p>“So where is Ron?” Hermione asked, opening her purse and checking her clip on time piece to see it was about 7. “Didn’t he come with you?”</p>
<p>“Oh right.” Harry said, swallowing down a mouthful of calamari. “He’s going to be another half hour or so, he’s been held up with George at the joke shop. Run on love potions, they stayed open a little later.”</p>
<p>“Ugh.” Hermione shook her head. “Getting ready for the grand finale no doubt! This fervor is unbelievable.”</p>
<p>“Some people are glad for a chance to let their hair down and lave fun.” Lavender said snidely. “You might try it every now and then.”</p>
<p>Ginny rolled her eyes and Seamus kicked Lavender under the table. At least they weren’t calling one another Lav Lav and Shamey Wamey, or some other such nonsense. </p>
<p>“Right.” Hermione said dryly. “Well, I’m going to get a martini at the bar for the wait.”</p>
<p>“Oh I’ll flag someone down for you, Hermione.” Ginny offered.</p>
<p>“No.” Hermione shook her head and looked towards the crowded tables around the room and busy bar. “It’ll take them forever to get over here. I’ll just go.”</p>
<p>Finding the path of least resistance through the throngs of people talking, laughing, milling about or dancing, skirting around the tables carefully to her destination. She opened a tab, ordered her drink and after taking a few pleasant sips, carefully held it aloft as she weaved her way back through. She found her way back blocked by an insurmountable crowd, and decided to go around the opposite wall that was less densely populated…<br/>
She honestly should have seen it coming. The circumstances were perfectly suited to a cringe worthy scene of humiliation. Expensive venue, elegant guests, a crowd of people to see it, pretty dress… it was bound to happen. </p>
<p>Hermione had no sooner gotten halfway down the length of tables when a waitress with a full tray of various drinks took a step back at exactly the right time, and she and Hermione tripped each other rather spectacularly. Her saving grace was that none of the drinks landed on her or her dress. The drawback, they all flew off the tray and out of her hand directly onto a male guest sitting at a table behind where they stood…<br/>
The young brunette server apologized immediately and profusely. “I’m so sorry.” She said, whisking away the mess on the floor and broken glasses with her wand. “Wait here miss I’ll bring you another.” </p>
<p>Hermione was still standing, empty glass in hand, frozen in surprise when she heard the familiar, drawling voice behind her.</p>
<p>“Well…That is now the second drink I’ve had thrown at me tonight…”</p>
<p>Hermione turned slowly, wide eyed and looked down in mute, open mouthed horror, too surprised and embarrassed for any other action or emotion. The man shook his hand, alcohol and various unknown cocktails dripping off his skin and the sleeve of the fine, fitted, casual suit he wore, and even in the shock of long pale blonde hair, now wet, hanging over his broad shoulders, and dripping down the side of his face. </p>
<p>“Mr. Malfoy!” she stammered. “I… I am so sorry. Oh merlin.” She fumbled in her purse for her wand and cast a few charms over him. “So, so sorry.” </p>
<p>
  <em> Oh, please kill me.</em>
</p>
<p> “You slapped me yesterday,” he reminded her, taking the linen napkin from the table beside a half drank tumbler, and dried the table in front of him. “I see no reason you should apologize for merely spilling a drink on me.”</p>
<p>Hermione tried to hide a grimace. Yeah… she had. </p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy had been a thrown in her professional side for the past 6 months since she’d been propelled into his circle of influence at the ministry. Part of his highly debated commuted sentence included 5 years unpaid public service. The general consensus of the ministry was he was best suited to the finance department. Which of course meant that any proposal which required an appeal for funding involved him.</p>
<p>Hermione raised her chin. “Well that’s easy. I didn’t <em>mean </em> to spill the drink on you. I intended to slap you.”</p>
<p>“Odd mode of gratitude.” He grumbled, tossing the napkin back on the table in a crumpled heap. </p>
<p><em> Gratitude. </em> She scoffed inwardly. Hermione had not had many strong, visceral reactions or feelings regarding the news that he was going to be set free but in the grand scheme of things she wasn’t all that surprised. Most of the charges from the first war never stuck, and he had done a fine job of covering his tracks if he were guilty of what they suspected of him early on in the interim. She knew it was his family’s defection, and the harsh treatment they suffered at the hands of Voldemort that had caused the minister and various committees to look somewhat empathetically on him and his wife and son. Regardless of what she might think of his abhorrent and highly publicized views of muggles and muggleborns, what was done was done, and she was forced to work with him.</p>
<p>That didn’t mean he wasn’t a right pain in the arse to deal with. </p>
<p>“Well I didn’t need your help,” Hermione answered confidently, “and you insinuated I was too young, naïve and idealistic to move such heavy legislation without your help.”</p>
<p>He raised an eyebrow. “I’m assuming you’re referring to that pathetic excuse of a funding proposal you drafted to go along with your twice rejected bill for aid to displaced centaurs…”</p>
<p>She folded her arms over her chest tightly. “I believe the word you used was… adorable.”</p>
<p>“Well, I fixed your ‘proposal’ and the legislation was passed was it not?” he challenged. “But forgive me, I’ve been out of the game so long I seem to have forgotten my manners.” He gestured to the empty chair across from him. “Allow me to apologize for offending you, by purchasing your drink…”</p>
<p>“Oh, no that’s not –“ Hermione began as the server reappeared and handed her a fresh martini, apologizing again. </p>
<p>“Please move Ms. Granger’s refreshments this evening to my bill.” Lucius persisted.</p>
<p>“Yes sir.” The server muttered quickly and disappeared into the throng once again. </p>
<p>Hermione cleared her throat and sat down a bit heavily in the offered chair. “Thank you. Though a simple ‘I’m sorry’ would have been plenty.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps.” He said taking another bracing swallow of what smelled of whiskey. “But so <em>very </em> out of character.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s lips parted in surprise and she found herself gaping briefly at him. Merlin’s ass, did Lucius Malfoy just <em>wink </em> at her?</p>
<p>She took a hurried gulp of her martini and she bit back a smile, taking a deep breath. “So, what brings you here tonight, Mr. Malfoy? It doesn’t seem like it would be your kind of place.”</p>
<p>“It’s not.” He confirmed dryly. “I find the chaos of clubs distasteful, but… this was the chosen venue.”</p>
<p>“A date?” she asked, surprised. More surprised than the possibility, she was more than mildly stunned at the fact she was having this exchange with him at all. This was the first non-work conversation she had ever had with the man, let alone one of longer duration than a few sentences…</p>
<p>“Good gods, no.” he grimaced in answer. “The society pages haven’t been very kind to Narcissa and I, but I <em>am </em> still married. For now.” He tacked on, a bit bitterly. “If I were going to have an affair, I wouldn’t do it out in the open. No. I am here on a private business meeting.” He looked around in irritation and disgust. “<em>Why </em> she would choose this time of night and place for a such a meeting is completely beyond me.”</p>
<p>He said nothing else, but her curiosity was piqued. “Well, did you get the deal?” she asked in bemusement.</p>
<p>“No!” he said, with an air of confusion. “She said something about additions to our contractual relationship, I said I was unaware of what needed altering, and she threw her drink in my face and stormed out.” </p>
<p>Hermione couldn’t help a small laugh. “I think, Mr. Malfoy, you were set up.”</p>
<p>Lucius raised an eyebrow. “Oh? Do elaborate Ms. Granger.”</p>
<p>“She was clearly trying to seduce you.” She answered him. “She’s probably been dropping hints for weeks and thought it should be obvious and <em>clearly </em> didn’t take rejection well.”</p>
<p>Lucius rolled his eyes. “I must be slipping. Usually I am not so oblivious to these things. But since I am here, and an irrational fee was paid just to get through the door, I intend to at least not return home sober.”</p>
<p>He finished the scotch and looking towards the bar gestured to the server there. A rushed, slightly pockmarked young man with wiry blonde hair came over, looking nervous. “Yes, sir what can I get you?”</p>
<p>Lucius looked towards Hermione expectantly. “Another martini, please.” She said.</p>
<p>“Yes miss. And you sir?”</p>
<p>“Ogden’s, no frills or adornments and exactly three ice cubes.” Lucius answered succinctly. "In fact, just leave the bottle."</p>
<p>Hermione laughed and shook her head as the server departed. “You can’t even order a drink like a normal human, can you?”</p>
<p>He scoffed. “The last time I ordered a scotch it came with a ridiculous glittering, firecracker. What the hell is the purpose?”</p>
<p>Hermione tried to take the smile off her face but failed miserably. What was happening here?! “You see that more often in muggle establishments.” She told him.</p>
<p>Lucius leaned back with a sneer. “My god, can a man not even have a drink without it being defiled by muggle influence?”</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances she might have taken the opportunity to rake him over the proverbial coals. But the martini was loosening her tense muscles, as well as her tongue, and she found she was having fun needling him.</p>
<p>“Oh surely, with all you’ve been through, you’ve had <em>some </em> revelations.” Hermione suggested. “A thought that perhaps there is something of value one can take from muggles.”</p>
<p>He frowned, but not in the irritable impatience she’d seen thus far, but in a perplexed contemplation.<br/>
“What I’ve… been through?” he repeated.</p>
<p>“Well.” She said, looking down at her hands, a flush coming to her cheeks. “I mean… I know your family – and you – suffered very much at the hands of Voldemort the last two years of the war. Probably longer. I could barely stomach being in his presence from afar for a few moments. It was terrifying and disgusting… I can’t imagine having him in your home, being tortured day in and out, worrying for your child. I’m sure it led to… some very unpleasant reflection and self-evaluation.”</p>
<p>Among the hum of activity around them, there was dead silence between the two of them at their small little table… And after a few moments, Hermione looked up from her tightly clasped hands, summoning her courage and meeting the older man’s gaze. The light, bantering conversation had taken a sudden and unexpected turn into much more serious and uncertain waters. Lucius was looking at her most strangely, his striking eyes widened, his lips parted slightly, the picture of a man very much taken off guard. </p>
<p>“I… I’m sorry.” She laughed nervously. “I… I get in my own head sometimes and the thoughts just start… tumbling out, whether or not they should. I… I shouldn’t have said. I mean… There's no reason we can't be civil but that's not to say... I’m sure you don’t want to talk about it and…”</p>
<p>He seemed to shake himself mentally and he blinked, breaking their uncomfortably intense eye contact and Hermione realized with some wonder that her heart was pounding. Why was her heart pounding?</p>
<p>“No, there is no need to… to apologize.” He said. “I was startled. You are the last person I would expect to display such an attitude of compassion.”</p>
<p>She took a flustered drink of that last bit of her martini and raised an eyebrow at him. “Because muggleborns lack the necessary complexity of feeling and thought?”</p>
<p>“No.” he said gruffly, meeting her eyes again, “Because I am me.”</p>
<p>It was Hermione’s turn to stare at him in mild surprise. </p>
<p>The silent, somewhat stiff moment was broken when the server returned and laid a tray with two identical, ruby colored drinks between them on the table, leaving them to look at it uncertainly. </p>
<p>“This is not what we –“ Lucius began, but the server had already darted away. “Oh hell, why bother.” </p>
<p>There was an odd looking brass key on the tray with the goblets that he looked at briefly and tossed aside. Hermione lifted the goblet to her lips, sniffing it and sipping it tentatively. </p>
<p>“It’s not that bad actually.” She said. “They must be highlighting a new cocktail.”</p>
<p>“Well.” He sighed resignedly and raised his glass to her.</p>
<p>“What shall we toast to?” she asked him.</p>
<p>“To… civility.” He suggested.</p>
<p>“And new beginnings.” She added.</p>
<p>Lucius inclined his head to her, and they tapped their goblets together and took generous swallows. It tasted to Hermione like a sweet wine, with a gentle tingling on her tongue. Lucius grimaced at it. “Hmm. It will do.”<br/>
They sat together in silence for another moment or two before Lucius spoke again. </p>
<p>“So… “ he said. “As we have thoroughly humiliated ourselves, I, by confessing my ignorance on the significance of this date and being oblivious to the advances of a lady, you by tripping over a waitress and spilling a half dozen beverages on me in full few of half the establishment, I feel a certain camaraderie with you, and quite comfortable asking you, are you here alone? This does not seem to be your style of venue either.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t.” she confessed simply. “I’m here with my boyfriend, and our friends and they were looking for a new place to go out…  He’s running late from work though, so… I wait.” </p>
<p>“I see. And given the festivities planned this week, will you and your significant other, be sacrificing a goat tomorrow, Ms. Granger?” he asked, </p>
<p>She winced. “No. The planned celebrations aren’t exactly traditional or historically accurate. Its all become a bit crazy, so, I doubt there will be much goat sacrificing.”</p>
<p>If Lucius was going to reply, he was interrupted when the same server returned, flushed and harried. “Miss, sir.” He said quickly. “I am so sorry but I gave you the wrong drinks and---”</p>
<p>“We’ve already finished them” Hermione waved him off. </p>
<p>But the server’s eyes grew wide as bludgers. “You drank the <em>whole </em> thing at once?”</p>
<p>“And why the hell wouldn’t we?” Lucius snapped, clearly growing impatient with the intrusion.</p>
<p>The server closed his eyes and swallowed hard. “Oh, merlin’s balls I am <em>so </em> getting fired.”</p>
<p>“What was that about?” Hermione wondered aloud as the young man turned and shuffled away back to the bar. “Well anyway…" she continued, turning back to the man across from her. "You are obviously a far more traditionally minded wizard. Will you be sacrificing any goats?”</p>
<p>“Not at all.” He said, lazily tapping his index finger against the smooth table. “Besides, for my dark arts, I prefer far more interesting sacrifices.”</p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow quizzically. “Such as.”</p>
<p>Lucius leaned forward conspiratorially, his eyes dancing with amused jest. “Virgins.”</p>
<p>Hermione laughed and he smiled, and she found herself taken aback pleasantly. Normally cold and severe, she had never seen this man smile. Not a genuine one, and certainly not at someone like her… It was quite an odd sensation, to be speaking so comfortably with him of all people… The relaxed and unguarded deportment he seemed to be displaying had a softening effect of his rigid facial features. </p>
<p>Hermione leaned back, appraising him subtly. She felt guilty acknowledging it while waiting for her boyfriend on Valentine’s day of all days, but it was the truth. The man dripped sex appeal. From the perfectly tailored suit, the slightly opened undershirt at his throat, bared by a discarded tie, the disinterested way he leaned back in the chair, his intently piercing eyes, the cut of his jaw, the smirking lips, and the maddeningly perfect hair. She’d seldom seen a body that yelled “fuck me” as loudly as his did… What would it be like to be underneath Lucius Malfoy while he drove into her in throes of passion…?</p>
<p>Heat and liquid scalding desire flooded her body, dampening her panties and a burn of shame colored her cheeks.</p>
<p>Lucius raised an eyebrow and she wondered if her eyes betrayed her thoughts. But his certainly betrayed his own, and his eyes flicked downward briefly looking appreciatively at her lips, throat, and slightly exposed cleavage. Subconsciously she squeezed her thighs together and bit back a moan as it only accentuated a blossoming ache between her legs. <em>Oh dear. </em></p>
<p>She saw Lucius’ jaw clench tightly, his lips set in a firm and unforgiving line, his eyes burning with a mirrored desire. His chest was heaving shallowly and his hand that was on the table curled into a white knuckled fist.<br/>
“You are a very… beautiful woman, Ms. Granger.” He muttered gruffly.</p>
<p>She smiled softly at the simple compliment. She swallowed, wetting her suddenly dry mouth. “Thank you. And I…” Hermione pulled at the neckline of her dress, suddenly overcome with heat. “I…”</p>
<p>She looked up, eyebrows raised as she heard a muted gasp from the man across from her to see Lucius breathing more raggedly, a sudden look of confusion and pain on his face, sweat dampening his forehead.<br/>
“What… did they turn up the heat all the sudden?” Hermione asked.</p>
<p>Hermione’s heart began racing, and she grew more breathless. She was panting – actually panting! - in heaving breaths and knew it wasn’t external heat as the warmth and gentle ache grew and spread almost painfully into her belly and…</p>
<p><em>Oh god! </em> </p>
<p>The throbbing fire erupted between her thighs and she moaned audibly, her yes drifting closed briefly and she swayed into the table. Lucius’ eyes positively burned. She was wet, aroused, her body aflame with desire and need, and she fought the absurd and demented desperation to leap from her chair, seize Lucius Malfoy by the robes and grind against him like a cat in heat. By the heaving of his chest, and the flush in his face that matched hers, she surmised that he was in similar distress. </p>
<p>“Oh…” she moaned again, gripping the edge of the table. “Oh god!”</p>
<p>Lucius’ lips parted with a shuddering breath at her moan before suddenly scowling and his gaze found the bar tender and he gestured in a curt ‘come hither’ motion.</p>
<p>The poor young man came up to them on shaking knees, glancing furtively at Lucius. “Y-yes, s-sir? Can I h-h-h-“</p>
<p>Lucius cut him off, raising his hand. “What – precisely – pray tell, did you serve us?”</p>
<p>“It’s – its” the young man squeaked. “It’s – ahem” he cleared his throat. “It’s called Cupid’s Arrow? It’s a new concoction of ours and….”</p>
<p>“And what does it <em>do </em>?!” she demanded, though with the intensifying ache between her legs she knew full well what it must be and clamped down on her bottom lip with her teeth to keep the entirely sexual whimper of need from escaping her throat.</p>
<p>“An… aphrodisiac. A couple out for their anniversary ordered it and… well… I got them mixed up sir… and… its meant to be sipped, in the privacy of one of our rooms- for as long as you…um… wish to…umm… indulge? “</p>
<p>“Enough babbling!” Lucius spat. “Is there a counter potion?”</p>
<p>“No sir.” And just when she thought the poor simpering fool couldn’t lose any more color, whatever was left drained from his face and he looked pasty and ill. </p>
<p><em>Oh no. </em> Hermione groaned, tears of desperation streaming down her cheeks. She could barely think, barely see straight… She felt as if a hot knife were thrust between her legs and twisting. Meant to be sipped indeed, and the intense, agonizing need carving her from the inside out, slicing through her womb and up into her breasts showed her exactly why. </p>
<p>“Damn it man, when will it wear off?” Lucius demanded hoarsely.</p>
<p>“Well… you drank the whole thing at once. So… an hour… or I don’t actually know?”</p>
<p>“Oh, bloody hell.” Lucius stood quickly, the chair he was in falling backwards with a clatter. Hermione squealed in shock as he seized her wrist and pulled her to her feet, grasping the key from the table.</p>
<p>“Let go of me!” she said with indignation.</p>
<p>He paused but it was obvious such a feat was painful and distasteful. “Do you <em>really </em> intend to sit here like this, for another hour for your friend?”</p>
<p>Her stomach lurched and her womb clenched at the very thought. Oh god, just make it stop!<br/>
“Fine! Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Without further delay, Hermione found herself being dragged along behind Lucius Malfoy towards the set of rooms through the back door. She stumbled along behind his purposeful strides, each step an exercise in endurance as bliss and pain warred inside her. They found the number on the door that the key matched and he jabbed the key in the lock.</p>
