          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco lay on the bed, wrists bound to the bedposts, eyeing Harry as he walked back and forth by the foot of the bed. Draco eyed Harry as he surveyed Draco’s naked body.<br/>
<br/>
“I think,” Harry said, leaning over Draco and making Draco’s breath hitch. “I’ll start…” Harry paused and brushed his lips against Draco’s, making Draco moan.<em> “Here.”</em><br/>
<br/>
Draco gasped, his back arching off the bed as the ice cube touched his nipple.<br/>
<br/>
“Or maybe here,” Harry said, dragging the ice cube over and circling Draco’s other nipple before brushing it over the hardened peak.<br/>
<br/>
“Harry,” Draco begged. <em>“Please.”</em></p></div>
