    <p>A crisp fall breeze blew across Lily’s face as she turned the key in the lock of her front door and stepped in.  The faint yellow glow from a dinosaur night light illuminated the entryway, revealing it for the minefield of leftover toys that it was.  Lily snorted, set down her messenger bag and began picking up the tiny pieces that made a trail up the oak staircase, almost forgetting to skip the broken third step.  <em>I need to fix that,</em> she thought. But first, she desperately needed to get some sleep.</p><p>Once on the staircase landing, her hands full of small multicolored blocks and cars that she had collected on her way up, Lily tiptoed to the door on her left and peeked in expecting to see a mess of blond hair on the Batman pillow case. She was met with an empty bed instead.  Brow furrowed in confusion, she dropped the toys in a chest before she turned to the door on her right, which was still slightly ajar because her youngest son was afraid of the dark and saw two little bodies curled into each other; their limbs tangled, both clutching their stuffies, fast asleep.  She stood in the doorway for a minute, heart full of love, and committed this moment to memory. </p><p>Leaning out of their room with a small smile, Lily moved toward the French doors at the end of the hallway.  She slipped into the room and quietly gathered her pajamas before going to the en suite to change.  Thankfully, she had showered at the hospital before leaving so she could crawl right into bed.  When she entered their bedroom, she saw Narcissa’s hair fanned out behind her on her pillow, glowing like halo under the beams of moonlight that were streaming through the window pane. Lily gazed in wonder at how lucky she was to marry the woman who had captured her heart all those years ago in Godrick’s Hollow.</p><p>
  <em>Her family had been on vacation, touring old cemeteries for a genealogy project her parents were working on, and she and her sister Petunia had decided to sit across the street at a local creamery while their parents perused the headstones.  Lily had ordered a single scoop of vanilla with rainbow sprinkles and just sat down when the most beautiful girl she had ever seen walked in. Her own green eyes never left the girl as she ordered, her voice soft like velvet.  Even though the blond seemed about the same age, she carried herself with a grace that was well beyond her years.   </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lily couldn’t take her eyes off her and, as a result, she made quite the fool of herself when she fell out of her chair. The ruckus earned her a smirk and eye roll from the blond. Petunia laughed when Lily said she was going to speak to her and, ever the supportive sister, assured her she was about to get shot down. But Lily didn’t care. She was going to go over there and take her chances.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She approached the table shyly. “Hi, um, my name is Lily. I noticed you walked in alone and thought you might like some company. Is this seat taken?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lily was struck by the intensity of the deep blue eyes that looked up from the mint chocolate chip ice cream. There was no answer, just the blonde’s contemplative gaze on her obviously trying to come to a decision about whether or not she would respond. Instead of waiting for rejection, Lily presumptuously sat herself in the seat across from her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With a just of her chin, the blond gestured to the brunette girl sitting across the shop holding a book in her hands. “Won’t your friend get lonely?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Huh? Oh, no. She’s not my friend. That’s just my sister, Petunia.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Petunia and Lily?  Both flowers, interesting.  Are your parents hippies?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Um, I don’t think so but, how well does one really know their parents?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“True,” she conceded and glanced away trying to hide any look that might give away her discomfort.  “Well, my name is Narcissa.  Narcissa Black.”</em>
</p><p><em>“Narcissa?  That’s a derivative of Narcissus…also a flower.  Were </em>your<em> parents hippies?” Lily smiled slyly.</em></p><p>
  <em>The blond looked up, a gloomy combination of emotions swirling in her eyes. “I don’t know, actually.  I was abandoned at an orphanage when I was very young.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh.  Oh, I’m sorry.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Don’t be,” she waved her hand dismissively, not wanting pity from a person she didn’t even know. “I don’t even know why I told you, to be honest.”  But the corners of her lips lifted slightly, and her face softened just enough so that when she spoke, Lily could hear the fondness. “There’s just something about you.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And though they had just met, Lily felt the same way. There was just something about the girl in front of her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The bell atop the door of the shop rang out and Lily and Petunia’s parents walked in telling them it was time to go. For reasons she still couldn’t recall, Lily quickly ran back to her sisters table and, stealing the felt tipped pen Petunia used a bookmark, wrote her address and phone number on the back of Narcissa’s hand. “Write to me.  Or call me.  Whichever.  Or neither, if you don’t want to.” She rubbed the back of her neck, confidence in her impulsive decision waning. “But…yeah, I hope you decide to.”  With a small wave goodbye Lily left with her family, glancing back once before walking out the front doors of the creamery.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Two weeks later Petunia walked back from the post box and handed Lily a small cream-colored envelope, the delicate scrawl of her name across the front brought a smile to her face and at that moment she knew her life would never be the same.  </em>
</p><p>Smiling at the memory, Lily crawled into bed behind her wife and spooned her delicate frame, and, draping an arm around her waist, pulled her close. She inhaled the familiar scents of honeysuckle and lavender that surrounded her and relaxed into a deep sleep with only one thought on her mind; <em>she was home.</em></p><p> </p>
