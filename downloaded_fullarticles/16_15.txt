    <p align="justify"><strong>Mrs Inko Midoriya was proud to say that she and her son were perfectly normal, thank you very much.</strong> As a single mother to an ambitious young boy, she had adapted to a perfectly timed routine over the years that accommodated towards his education and happiness in the home, as well as her own working hours that helped the two of them survive in the comfortable flat she had managed to acquire over the years. At exactly six-thirty on a weekday, Inko would wake up and get ready, cook breakfast for herself and Izuku, before taking him to school at exactly seven-thirty, a time that was a little early but allowed for her to get to work at eight. She would finish work at four and collect Izuku afterwards, where she would then be able to drive him home and feed the pair of them a delicious dinner to finish the day with. In no part of Inko’s day to day patterns was the notion of ‘normalcy’ absent, nor did she desire for that to change.</p><p align="justify">Despite that, she could allow for exceptions. One of these was Izuku’s birthday, his eleventh, which the pair of them had been very excited about. It was his final year in elementary school, so he was nearly one of the “big boys” as she was always keen to tell him. That meant, this birthday had to be extra special, since it was his final birthday before he entered middle school. They had had a party yesterday, on Saturday, since a lot of people had more functions to attend on a Sunday, nor were they as motivated to lend the last day of the weekend before the weekday crashed in, full force, on the following Monday. Izuku’s birthday, of which mostly had a few scrap friends that didn’t even seem that invested in him, had left Inko to worry about the quality of her son’s birthday, and she yearned to make the actual day special for him, a memory that he could regard fondly in the future.</p><p align="justify">For that reason, she let him have a lie in. Creeping through the apartment, Inko intended to make herself a refreshing cup of tea. It was often the way she started the day, be it weekday or weekend, since the small traces of caffeine were enough to bring a small buzz thrumming through her bloodstream before work or other daily activities. She was shuffling along, minding her own business, when she noticed the simple, cream coloured letter sitting face-down on the welcome mat by the front door. For a moment, she hesitated. It was too early for the postman to have passed by on his daily rounds, although she found herself drawn towards it, like a moth to the flame. She stooped beside the letter, lifting it up and turning it over in her hands again and again.</p><p align="justify">Aside from the softness of the high-quality envelope, a thick creamy paper, the beautifully scrawled ink lettering on the front caught her attention. This wasn’t a handwriting that she recognised, which was unusual given that someone had gone to the effort to handwrite it, opposed to being typed out. What made her all the more curious was that it was addressed to her son, a <em>Mr I. Midoriya</em>. Of course, it couldn’t be addressed to her, since it was to a Mr Midoriya rather than a Mrs Midoriya, nor was it addressed to her late husband, for his name, Hisashi, started with a H and not an I. Of course, it could be a birthday letter to her beloved Izuku, but once more, the handwriting was unrecognisable. She couldn’t imagine who would send her eleven-year old son a letter since all the people he knew had attended his party. When she turned it over in her hands, she saw a stamped wax mark, deep red in colour and printed with a large, ornate letter ‘H’. For the briefest of seconds, Inko’s heart skipped a beat, the sudden anticipation that Hisashi had sent a letter to Izuku, congratulating him on his turning eleven. However, she knew that was completely stupid; Hisashi had been dead for nearly a decade. It would be impossible for him to be sending letters to their son.</p><p align="justify">She normally wouldn’t open any birthday letters addressed to Izuku, but today she found herself breaking the wax seal. It was folded into three segments, neatly and perfectly, with a swirled border curling at the corners. At the top was a strange emblem, four colours and four animals. Yellow and badger, green snake, blue eagle and red lion. She had never seen such a ridiculous coat of arms before. It was so strange she was tempted to believe it was it was fake. What stumped her even more was the very first sentence, written in bold as if acting like a title, despite the absolute stupidity of the words that bounced back at her.</p><p align="justify">“Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry”. It was the second most absurd thing she had ever read, second only to the sentence that swiftly followed it. “Headmaster: Nezo (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)”. Inko almost scoffed out loud. What the fuck was a “Mugwump”? What in God’s name was this letter? And more importantly, <em>why</em> was it addressed to her son?</p><p align="justify"><em>Dear Mr Midoriya</em>, the letter read.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Yours sincerely,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Shota Aizawa,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Deputy Headmaster</em>
</p><p align="justify">Sure enough, when she peered back into the thick envelope, there was a second page that, once opened, was a list of peculiar items and books apparently associated with this mysterious Hogwarts School. She didn’t like this a single bit. In fact, Inko was a little frightened. What kind of psycho would attempt to play such a cruel hoax on a child, pretending that there was a magical school? Who was trying to lure her son away with the fabled pretence of witches and wizards? She didn’t bother juggling the weird names of the authors or the strange objects required- seriously, what school would require a set of glass or crystal phials? Breathing deeply, hands sweating, Inko shredded the letter and stomped to the kitchen, discarding the tattered remains and turning the kettle on. She was standing in her fluffy dressing gown, furiously with her arms folded, when she heard the mailbox click. Inko turned around, seeing a letter lying on their happy welcome mat. She wrinkled her nose in confusion; the mailman had already been and he had delivered that stupid fake letter. Never before had the mailman returned for seconds.</p><p align="justify">Inko poured her tea first and stirred it. She liked to add sugar and milk; she drank black tea, not green; and she would leave the teabag in for a little bit to brew. Not too long, though, otherwise it would stew. She used that time to cross the hallway and pick up the letter, encased in smooth paper with a neat scrawl on the front. Inko’s blood ran cold. She clutched the letter in between shaking fingers and turned it over to see the same wax seal. This time, she didn’t open it. Instead, she crossed to the nearest window and peered out the curtains, looking intently to see who may have pushed the letter through. There was no sign of anyone walking away from their house. She was just about to let the curtain twitch back into place when she saw a beautiful barn owl perched on their mailbox. She was rooted to the spot, staring at the animal, when its head swivelled towards her, black eyes locking with her own green ones. With a gasp, Inko fell away from the window. It wasn’t that she was afraid of owls, but the sentience in this particular owl’s face was unnerving. She scrambled away from the window and returned to the kitchen, throwing herself into a chair and taking deep breaths, warm cup of tea beside her.</p><p align="justify">Once she had calmed down some more, Inko opened the letter and read it. The exact same words were written on an identical letter, so similar that she had to check in the bin to confirm if the torn up remains of its predecessor were still there. Sure enough, it was the copy of a letter. But how had the sender known she had discarded the original? She had been standing in the hallway and the curtains had been closed, so unless they had been peering through her mailbox, there was no chance they could’ve seen her. Nervously, Inko glanced down the hallway. There was no sign of anyone watching her through the mailbox. It remained closed and blank. The letter was definitely strange and it worried her a lot, but Inko wasn’t quite sure whether she was going to contact the police about this. She didn’t tear it up this time; instead, she put it in the recycling pile, telling herself that that would be the last of it. Inko set to work making pancakes, letting the sizzling distract her from every strange thing that had happened that morning. She would sip her tea and had turned on the TV to watch the news, finding herself slightly disappointed that there was nothing about magical letter hoaxes.</p><p align="justify">The warmest part of her day was listening to the thundering of footsteps as Izuku raced down the stairs towards the smell of pancakes. Inko could always trust her son to be enthusiastic about pancakes, especially seeing as it was his birthday. She smiled to herself and focused on the flipping and the cooking, transferring them to plates. There was a strange pause of silence where she had expected Izuku to come racing into the room. Glancing around the kitchen, she couldn’t see her young son, much to her surprise.</p><p align="justify">“Izuku?” she called out, a little concerned but reluctant to leave food on the stove.</p><p align="justify">“Coming!” he replied, much to her relief.</p><p align="justify">For a moment, she had been worried. The strange letters had done nothing to console her and the thought of <em>anything</em> happening to her son frightened her. Inko immediately settled down and turned her full attention to the food once she was sure Izuku was OK.</p><p align="justify">“Mum, Mum, I’m going to a wizard school!” she heard Izuku’s padding bare feet on the kitchen tiles, his voice loud and vibrant in the kitchen. “I’m a wizard, Mum!”</p><p align="justify">She didn’t really process what he was saying until she turned around and saw him waving that cursed letter around. Inko almost dropped the frying pan and spatula, and she almost lurched towards her son in a furied state when she noticed the second letter remained on the recycling pile. A <em>third</em> letter had been sent?</p><p align="justify">“Izuku, give that to me,” she put on a stern voice.</p><p align="justify">“But it’s addressed to me,” he pouted, and she really pitied her adorable son, with his mop of curling hair and large eyes. “I didn’t do anything wrong.”</p><p align="justify">“No, you didn’t, but it’s a letter from someone who isn’t very nice, therefore you don’t want it,” she told him patiently. “Please give me the letter.”</p><p align="justify">“But…” he looked between Inko and the letter with a trembling lip and watering eyes, but he still gave it to her.</p><p align="justify">“Unfortunately, this letter isn’t true,” Inko said softly, guiding her son to his chair and settling a plate of pancakes in front of him. “Hogwarts School doesn’t exist, I’m afraid. It’s a nasty prank from a nasty person.”</p><p align="justify">“Really?” he played with his food, for once uninterested by pancakes.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry, Izuku,” she frowned and her heart really went out to him. “We’ll do whatever you want today, though, since it’s your birthday.”</p><p align="justify">That seemed to cheer him up more, because he nodded with a freckled smile and proceeded to shovel syrupy pancakes into his mouth. It made her smile to see him happy, so she tore up this third letter without opening it and chucked it straight in the recycling pile, determined to never see it again.</p><p align="justify">“You’ll have an orange juice, right?” she offered, approaching the fridge and he nodded vigorously, too happy to surely be truly sad about the discarded Hogwarts letter.</p><p align="justify">She was setting it in front of him when she heard the telltale click of the mailbox. Inko glanced at the open door leading to the hallway, although she couldn’t see the front door from this angle. She felt a light sweat appear on her body, but she couldn’t force herself to move towards the front door. Izuku was looking between her and the doorway, large eyes confused and questioning. Inko was about to convince herself that she hadn’t actually heard it, when the sound happened again, and then again, and then again.</p><p align="justify">“What’s that noise?” Izuku was staring at her.</p><p align="justify">“Stay here,” she told him, mothering instincts going wild as she approached the hallway and saw the mailbox spitting letter after letter, all of them addressed to her son.</p><p align="justify">Balling her hands into fists, Inko strode down the hallway and threw open the door, watching an owl fly away from the pavement nearby. There were more of them now, all different breeds, dotted down the pathway. However, there was no one dashing down the drive, shielding their face from her view. Only owls. She closed the door, feeling suddenly very cold. When she turned around, Izuku was standing at the doorway, holding his plate of pancakes but not taking a single bite.</p><p align="justify">“Are you OK, Mum?” he stared.</p><p align="justify">“Everything’s fine,” she blew out a breath. “Don’t worry, Izuku. Just go and eat your breakfast.”</p><p align="justify">Her young son hesitated for just a moment, as if he wanted to be able to help her, but then he meandered back into the kitchen, plate in hand. Inko closed the door, just as she heard a strange fluttering from the living room. Mouth dry, she walked in and saw letters pouring in through the fireplace. Stifling a scream, she rushed into the kitchen to where Izuku was seated patiently at the dinner table, watching her with an anxious round face. She turned just as the letter box began sputtering letters out once more, before rushing over to her son and grasping him by the wrist.</p><p align="justify">“Mum?”</p><p align="justify">“We have to leave,” she was trying her best not to panic, but she couldn’t help it. Not when her son was potentially in danger.</p><p align="justify">“Where are we going?” Izuku asked, showing the smallest amounts of resistance. Whilst Inko was proud that he wasn’t blindly believing anyone, she wanted him to be cooperating with her today of all days. She understand that he was afraid, but they didn’t have time.</p><p align="justify">“Coat on,” she whipped it from the cupboard, seeing her son’s eyes bulging as he took in the masses of letters that had begun to shoot out of the fireplace and letterbox like a machine gun.</p><p align="justify">Inko forced the coat around her son’s shoulders and hurried him towards the door, squinting against any letters that slapped into her face. It was like forcing her way through a snowstorm, grasping for the door handle and flinging it open, only to find no one on the other side of the door. Inko was vaguely aware that Izuku was crying out to her, his voice questioning and his fear evident as the pair of them stumbled out of the doorway and onto their driveway. Inko staggered to a halt and almost retreated immediately back indoors when she saw the car was entirely covered in owls, heads swivelling, eyes staring. She turned, holding on tightly to her tearful son’s hand, only to see the entire house was covered in owls. Her heart was hammering in her chest, because a new one would arrive and drop another one of those cursed letters. She had to escape, so she found herself rushing towards the car and waving her arms, sending the owls scattering across the lawn, hooting in mild irritation. Inko wasn’t normally so bossy but she had to force Izuku into the car before climbing into the driver’s seat and starting the ignition.</p><p align="justify">“Why are there owls everywhere?” Izuku was wiping panicked tears from his face, searching wildly around the room.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know,” Inko replied through gritted teeth.</p><p align="justify">“Where are we going?” he pressed his hands and face to the window as she drove away, more owls flying out of reach of the car.</p><p align="justify">“Mitsuki’s,” Inko replied. “We’re going to Mitsuki’s and then we’re calling the police.”</p><p align="justify">His eyes were like saucers trained on her for the entire journey. Inko didn’t even sing along to the radio like she normally did. Her heart was beating too quickly and she feared for hers and her son’s lives. Only when she pulled up outside the Bakugo house did she feel like she had some chance of relaxing. Inko blew out a long, tired breath, before ushering her son from the car and holding his hand to the front door, of which she rang the bell once, then twice, before standing there, face flushed and foot tapping impatiently. Some part of her felt bad. After all, it was early, not even eight, so to wake Mitsuki and her family up now wasn’t entirely fair. At the same time, she needed a place of refuge, and Mitsuki was the only person Inko was sure could provide it.</p><p align="justify">Sure enough, the door opened, with Masaru Bakugo standing before them, adjusting his glasses sleepily and clothes hastily thrown on. Inko wasn’t sure how to present herself, but he seemed to read the atmosphere very quickly.</p><p align="justify">“Come in,” he stepped aside and let the pair of them in, before rushing off into the depths of his house.</p><p align="justify">Inko and Izuku stood in the centre of the room, unsure of what to do with themselves. She wanted to reassure him that everything was fine, but Inko couldn’t promise that. Instead, she kept to his side, waiting until the moment Mitsuki Bakugo bustled into the room in her dressing gown, hair rumbled from sleep.</p><p align="justify">“Inko?” she seemed ruffled and confused, although there was no animosity in her eyes. “Do you want tea?”</p><p align="justify">“I have to call the police,” Inko snapped into life, rifling in her coat pockets before muttering a curse under her breath. “I left my phone at the house. Mitsuki, can I-”</p><p align="justify">“What’s happening?” Mitsuki interrupted, although she wore a patient expression. “Take a seat, both of you.” Both Midoriya family members obeyed. “What’s happened, Inko?”</p><p align="justify">She took a moment to breathe, until she could compose a proper sentence. “I don’t really want Izuku to hear this, but… Mitsuki, I think someone’s trying to hurt my son.”</p><p align="justify">Izuku snapped his head towards her.</p><p align="justify">“What are you talking about?” Mitsuki sat down with her, tea forgotten.</p><p align="justify">“This letter arrived in the mail today- one that was absolute nonsense- and it was addressed to him,” Inko just wished Mitsuki would give her the phone, but explaining things would probably achieve that better. “The letters kept coming and coming, no matter how much I ignored them.”</p><p align="justify">“Letters to your son?” Mitsuki looked worried. “Were they threats?”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know <em>what</em> they were,” Inko hugged herself. “Some sort of fake school invite. I think someone wants him to… I don’t know. I think someone intends to hurt my boy.”</p><p align="justify">“A fake school invite?” Mitsuki looked like she was running things through her head.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, one about magic or something stupid like that,” Inko was beginning to lose her patience, her voice wearing with the rough edges of frustration. “Please, Mitsuki, let me use the phone. I think the police need to know.”</p><p align="justify">Mitsuki Bakugo rose from her spot on the sofa and crossed the living room, opening the bureau. Inko watched incredulously. Was she going to ignore her requests? Perhaps Mitsuki thought she was going crazy? Instead, the woman brought over an envelope and handed it to Inko. It was addressed to a Mr K. Bakugo.</p><p align="justify">“What is this?” Inko asked.</p><p align="justify">“Open it,” Mitsuki said.</p><p align="justify">Nervously, Inko opened it. The letter had already been opened previously, but inside was a near replica to the letter addressed to Izuku. She looked up at Mitsuki with only questions in her eyes.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll make that cup of tea,” Mitsuki told her. “And then I’ll give you a proper explanation.”</p>
