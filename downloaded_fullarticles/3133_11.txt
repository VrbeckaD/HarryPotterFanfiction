    <p>Bellatrix Black sighed as she looked out of the trains window, watching the land speed by. It was her fourth year back at Hogwarts and unlike everyone else aboard the train, she wasn't excited for the Start-of-Term Feast. Yes, she was happy to go back to the school, but she wasn't excited to be alone again for another year. To be ignored and hated by her whole house (she didn't believe in their beliefs) and to be watched by suspicious eyes of the other houses for being 'The Bride'.</p><p>The day Harry Potter became known as 'The Boy Who Lived' she had become known as 'The Bride'. Two children tied by fate to a man who seek to change the world as they know it.</p><p>Well Harry Potter became a hero she had become a pariah. Why? Because Lord Voldemort had wanted her to be his bride when she was of age, for the magic she was born with was unlike any other. Her parents, being proud pure bloods and believers to his cause, agreed to the arrangement, but they were killed by Voldemort the day before he had killed the Potters and was killed himself. She was then given to her elder sister, Andromeda Tonks, to be raised by for her other sister, Narcissa Malfoy, had already had a child and The Ministry of Magic didn't want to 'overwhelm' the new mother by making her raise another child. But people secretly knew the truth, that the Ministry didn't want to give Narcissa custody of Bellatrix in the case of Voldemort's return.</p><p>Because she was raised by Andromeda, Bellatrix did not grow up to hate muggle borns or half bloods and that is why she is hated by her house, for being a blood traitor in their eyes.</p><p>Thou she showed to be unlike the usual Slytherin, the other houses were weary of her for just being known as The Bride and of course a for this Bellatrix sat alone in the train starring out the window wishing to be in her dorm at the school with the Welcoming Feast over with already. Wishing for this day to be over and for classes to begin, to learn of new spells and different curses, jinxes, and hexes to use.</p><p>As the young raven haired witch thought of the new things she'll learn this year she was ripped out of her thoughts by her door to the compartment she was sitting in being opened by a bushy haired girl wearing plain robes suggesting she was a first year.</p><p>"Excuse me, but you haven't seen a toad but any chance? A boy named Neville lost it."</p><p>Bellatrix blinked at the young girl standing before her. She couldn't tell why but she was drawn to this girl.</p><p>"Well have you?" The impatient first year asked.</p><p>"Sorry but no if I had I'm sure Rigby would be making a fuss about it by now." As Bellatrix said this she pointed at the black cat that was sleeping across from her on the other bench. The younger girl looked over at the cat that slept as Bellatrix spoke.</p><p>Bellatrix watched as a small smile spread across the girls face as she strides into the compartment, taking a seat at the bench beside Rigby to pet her. Rigby merely purred at the attention she was being given all of a sudden.</p><p>"She's a beautiful cat, is she your familiar?" Curious hazel eyes looked to Bellatrix for the answer.</p><p>"Um yes, yes she is."</p><p>"I wanted to buy a pet in Diagon Alley but my parent wouldn't let me. Because it was our first time there and they just wanted to get my school supplies and leave. I suppose it'll take them awhile to get use to the idea that magic is real and such."</p><p>Bellatrix sat there staring at the girl before her, who came in looking for a toad and was now talking to her about her first trip to Diagon Alley with her parent shopping for school supplies. The girl, who had looked back down at Rigby as she spoke, looked up at Bellatrix when she didn't say anything and smiled, unnerved by the slightly awkward silence in the room. She stuck her hand out and said,</p><p>"I'm Hermione Granger by the way."</p><p>Bellatrix shyly shook hands with Hermione and introduced herself,</p><p>"Bellatrix Black."</p><p>When no reaction came from her name being spoken out loud Bellatrix realized that this girl was a muggleborn.</p><p>A annoyed meow followed Bellatrix's answer causing both girls to look at the black cat, who was now awake glaring at the raven haired girl who sat before her.</p><p>"And as I mention before this is Rigby."</p><p>Hermione grinned at the cat once more and went back to petting her. Before Bellatrix could speak Hermione was talking once again.</p><p>"You're a returning student aren't you? What year are you in? What House are you in?"</p><p>Bellatrix was taken back by the girl. She didn't know how to react, the only friends she had was her niece Nymphadora and a few of the teachers at Hogwarts. She didn't know how to talk to people her age.</p><p>"Right, well this is my fourth year and I'm in..."</p><p>Bellatrix paused,she knew the second she told Hermione the house she was in she would leave. For she knew her House's reputation wasn't one that made it easy for people to talk to her.</p><p>"Slytherin."</p><p>"Oh Slytherin you say, I'm sorry for disturbing you I'll leave you alone now." Hermione sputtered</p><p>Hermione stood up hurriedly to leave when Bellatrix spoke up to her.</p><p>"It's okay if you stay, you weren't distributing me. I may be in Slytherin but I'm not like them. Promise."</p><p>Bellatrix was a bit desperate to have the first year for company. This could be her chance at having a real friend this year. No one had yet to tell Hermione of her past, of who she was suppose to be, suppose to wed when she was of age.</p><p>Hermione looked back at the fourth year who smiled genuinely at her to show she wasn't as Slytherin's were describe to be. Hermione bit her lip, she knew how Slytherin's were all mostly proud pure bloods who didn't talk to people outside of their house and believe muggle borns are thefts of magic. But the Slytherin girl didn't seem like that, she appeared to truly want to talk to her. And being a know-it-all Hermione wanted to learn more about the school even thou she read Hogwarts A History, there was nothing like talking to an actual student of the school. With that last thought Hermione decided to stay and talk with the raven haired girl.</p><p>She sat down in the seat she previously left. Bellatrix's smiled grew when the young girl stayed.</p><p>"You're a muggle born right?"</p><p>Hermione nodded at the question wondering why Bellatrix started off their conversation this way.</p><p>"My um father figure of sorts is a muggle born too. I remember him telling me the first time he learned he was a wizard and of Hogwarts, that it was a bit overwhelming. So I'm sure you have tons of questions you don't have answers to right?"</p><p>Hermione grinned as it turned out Bellatrix was starting this conversation exactly the way she wanted it to go.</p><p>"Yes I do. I've read Hogwarts A History! But there are a few things that it left unanswered. Like magic I know that you move your wand in different ways for spells and say incantations from them, I just can't fathom it, you know? Since I have never seen it done or have yet to tried it." She sighed.</p><p>Bellatrix smiled, "Would you like to? We can do magic on the train to and from Hogwarts underage just not in the muggle world."</p><p>"Really?!" Excitement filled Hermione's voice at Bellatrix's declaration.</p><p>"Yes, come sit over here so I can show you some simple spells and charms."</p><p>Hermione hurried to sit next to her. Bellatrix pulled her wand from her sleeve and pointed to the rack over the bench across from them.</p><p>"See that book there? I'm going to use a summoning charm on it."</p><p>Hazel eyes watched Bellatrix intensely as she casted the spell.</p><p>"Accio book!"</p><p>The book flew off the rack and into Bellatrix's waiting hand.</p><p>"Accio is the incantation right?"</p><p>"Right. To use it you have to say Accio and then want you want to summon. Here you try."</p><p>Bellatrix tossed the book to the bench where it landed with a thud next to Rigby, who merely slept on without being disturbed by the sound.</p><p>"Just point your wand at the book and go for it. Oh! Be sure to be ready to catch the book too."</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath before trying it.</p><p>"Accio book!"</p><p>Once again the book flew towards the girls and land in Hermione's hand instead. Hermione laughed with excitement at trying out her first spell out. Bellatrix smiled knowing how the young brunette felt. For the next hour or so Bellatrix showed Hermione simple spells and charms that she'll learn as a first year as well as some other ones that she knew of from reading books at home and in the library at Hogwarts.</p><p>They were interrupted by a nervous looking boy opening the compartment door, who asked Hermione if she had found Trevor yet.</p><p>"Oh Neville! I'm sorry I got distracted. Have you check this part of the train for him yet?"</p><p>"N-no I was looking for you to see if you found him."</p><p>"Alright then. Bellatrix and I will look for him on this part of the train and down and you'll go from here and up. Sound good?"</p><p>"Yes Hermione. Thank you again."</p><p>Before Neville could leave Bellatrix stopped him.</p><p>"Here take Rigby. She'll help you look for Trevor too."</p><p>"She won't hurt him, will she?"</p><p>"No she won't."</p><p>"Thank you!" Neville smiled at Bellatrix and walk away look for his pet. Rigby followed beside him appear to look as well.</p><p>"You don't mind helping me right Bella?"</p><p>Bellatrix was shocked at the sudden nickname Hermione had gave her. A soft smile formed on her lips before she answered with a shake of her head. Hermione smiled back and grabbed Bellatrix's hand to hold as they walked in the opposite detection of Neville.</p><p>As the two girls looked and asked people if they'd seen a toad around, Bellatrix worried of the other kids reactions to her walking around with the first year and if they'll tell Hermione of her past. Before she could stop and tell Hermione herself they stumble a pond two boys with tons of candy and a fat rat in one of the compartments.</p><p>The boy with red hair and the rat looked as though he was about to do a spell. Hermione being nosy wanted to stay and watch him. Bellatrix raised an eyebrow as the redhead did the suppose it spell and immediately figured out the spell was fake. And the boy was none other than a Weasley who had be trick by his twin brothers Fred and George Weasley. Before she knew it Hermione had drug her in the room with the two boys to show off one of the spells Bellatrix taught her.</p><p>Hermione pointed her wand at the boy with broken glasses, she spoke with a clear slightly bossy voice.</p><p>"Oculus Reparo"</p><p>With a hiss the boys' glasses were good as new.</p><p>"That's better isn't it?"</p><p>As the black haired boy took off his glasses to look at them, Hermione spoke again.</p><p>"Holy cricket. You're Harry Potter."</p><p>Bellatrix's eyes snapped to the shaggy haired boy before her. And realized Hermione was right. This scrawny boy somehow killed the most powerful dark wizard, Voldemort. This was the boy who changed her life for the better.</p><p>"I'm Hermione Granger. And you are?"</p><p>Hermione spoke to the redhead boy with a bit of a dismissive tone of voice. Said boy said his name with a mouth full of candy,</p><p>"Ron Weasley."</p><p>"Pleasure." Hermione said with a bit of disgust at the boy's manners.</p><p>"And what's your name?" Harry asked Bellatrix with curious eyes.</p><p>Here's the moment Bellatrix didn't want to happen. The minute she said her name she knew the Weasley boy would speak of her past. With a deep breath in Bellatrix stated her name.</p><p>"Bellatrix Black."</p>
