    <p>“Snape!” Sirius gasped breathlessly as he burst into the carriage Severus was skulking in alone, enjoying the peace and quiet. He flinched back in surprise, his relief at the fact that Sirius was alone not significantly detracting from his automatic response of fear.</p>
<p>“I’ve had a brilliant idea!” Sirius continued, either entirely oblivious or choosing to ignore the reaction from his audience. Severus was curling himself up into the seat, his wand held low and ready, his book as a psychological defence between the two of them.</p>
<p>“I’m coming to stay with you for the summer!” Sirius said, brimming with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Severus was certain he had misheard. It was the only sane conclusion, though given that he had never considered Sirius to be particularly sane it was a precarious one. None of the Blacks he had encountered thus far were entirely balanced, at least in his opinion. </p>
<p>“No,” Severus said, faintly terrified at the prospect. Home was bad enough without unwanted Gryffindors, especially ones that hated him and would undoubtably kick him out of his own bed, leaving him to sleep on the even less appealing floor of his own bedroom. It was, in summary, the absolute worst idea Severus had ever heard, and he had heard some truly dreadful ones in his time. Up until now the worst one had probably been the one Regulus had told him, which had involved a swimming pool filled with spaghetti and a carefully deployed flamingo. Severus had no idea if he’d ever done anything about it, but he rather hoped not. </p>
<p>“It’s perfect, you see,” Sirius explained, ignoring all other interpretations of his plan. Severus was considerably less convinced that it was perfect. The only way to make it perfect would have involved redefining the meaning of the word perfect to mean something more like catastrophically bad.  </p>
<p>“Because I’ve given it some thought and your dad’s a muggle, right?” Sirius continued cheerfully, “Well, I know that in some ways Evans would be even better as both her parents are muggles, so the full double whammy, but I don’t think James would like it if I stayed with her so you’re the next best thing,”</p>
<p>“What?” was Severus’s only response, partially insulted at being reduced to second best, even for something he didn’t want. He was also somewhat concerned about the fact that he personally thought that whether or not Lily or her parents were amenable to Sirius staying with them for the summer was a far more important consideration than James Potter’s opinion, much like he personally felt that he should have more of a say in whether or not Sirius descended on his house for the next few weeks rather than Sirius making the decision seemingly without any input from anyone else.</p>
<p>Sirius sat down cheerfully on the carriage seat. Severus inched further into the corner, watching him warily. His retreat was hampered slightly by the carriage wall that was sadly entirely solid and prevented him from actually escaping. </p>
<p>“My parents hate muggles, you know,” Sirius continued, “So giving it some consideration they would hate you too, so to really annoy them I should spend time with you, and if your house has an actual muggle in it then it would be perfect!”</p>
<p>Severus was once again insulted. He didn’t really expect anything else from Sirius, it was true, but being used as a form of teenage rebellion was still insulting. He was tempted by the idea of Sirius and his father locked in a room for the rest of eternity, causing each other suffering as he lived his life free of the both of them, but he was practical enough to realise that it wouldn’t work. If he did take Sirius back to Cokeworth he had no doubt that Sirius would instantly manage to become best buddies with his father, and his summer would be a living hell, without even Lily to brighten his miserable existence.</p>
<p>“No,” Severus repeated again feebly, in the desperate hope that for once Sirius would actually pay attention to the opinion of someone that wasn’t James Potter.</p>
<p>“And,” Sirius said, as if realising that Severus wasn’t quite as enthusiastic about the entire plan as he was, “We can work together to get back our friends,”</p>
<p>Severus was almost tempted by this, as he would be willing to sell his soul to pretty much anyone if it would restore his friendship with Lily. He knew however that there was nothing he could do, she had ended it and holding out hope or harassing her would only make her hate him more. He was also fairly confident that any plan that came out of Sirius’s mouth would make matters approximately a million times worse. </p>
<p>“What about money?” Sirius asked suddenly, and Severus had to admit he was intrigued. Money was one of the things he was always short of. Though honestly, he was lacking in pretty much everything, the only thing he really had for himself was his intellect and talent, and even those were under appreciated because of the wrappings in which they came. If he had money or natural charisma like Potter or Malfoy he might stand a better chance of a bright future. Sirius seemed to realised that he was listening, even if he was still clearly unconvinced by any of what he was saying. The suggestion, however, of spending time with Sirius for financial gain was something that struck him as a little closer to prostitution than ideal. He had never before considered that as a profession before, and felt that it was one he was unlikely to enter into willingly, though it did make him wonder if there was a career trajectory where he would be able to be paid to insult people. It seemed like it would truly play into his talents.</p>
<p>“I’ve got money,” Sirius continued, unhelpfully. Severus slowly drew his book back up, and returned to reading. Sometimes the best thing was to ignore an irritation until it disappeared of its own accord. He remained tense though, and the constant fear of attack seriously inhibited his ability to concentrate on his book.</p>
<p>When the train pulled into King’s Cross Station, Sirius was still in the carriage with Severus. Severus kept glancing at him worriedly as they both shrunk their trunks. The fact that Sirius had changed into some semblance of muggle clothing was really concerning as that suggested that rather than going home with his wizarding family, Sirius was genuinely intending to follow Severus home. What Sirius didn’t know, however, was that Severus had no particular intention of going home to his family either. He doubted his parents would be coming to pick him up and without Lily’s parents to give him a lift to Cokeworth he was at a bit of a loss as to what to do. He couldn’t just sleep rough on the platform until term started again, though it was tempting. He didn’t have anywhere to go, really. He knew the trains would eventually take him to Cokeworth, but he had no muggle money on him and precious little wizarding currency. The silver lining was that Sirius would eventually realise and leave him alone to die in a ditch. As silver linings went, it was fairly morbid.</p>
<p>What Severus was not expecting, however, was to be dragged by Sirius through the crowds, constantly being pulled down behind anything that would hide them from the potential view of the Black family. Sirius had always been a touchy-feely kind of person, with little thought given to whether or not the people he was with objected to being grabbed. Severus had plenty of experience with Sirius’s lack of consideration for personal space, though for once this came without any particular animosity. It was almost pleasant, though he still did not enjoy it in the slightest, more that he appreciated not being actively the target of Sirius’s malice. He still resented being shoved down behind luggage rack as Sirius carefully surveyed the station platform.</p>
<p>“Where’re your parents?” Sirius hissed impatiently, keeping a watchful eye out for his own. His parents didn’t seem too concerned by the fact that he’d seemingly vanished into thin air, though Regulus was looking around frantically. Poor Regulus Severus thought, though with little sympathy. He was not by nature a sympathetic person. </p>
<p>“Cokeworth,” Severus answered shortly, not appreciating being held behind a pillar as Sirius breathed down his neck. As answers went, it was not particularly helpful, as it required Sirius to have a knowledge of British geography in addition to the background knowledge that Severus had grown up in Cokeworth. As Sirius was entirely ignorant on both counts, he missed the point. </p>
<p>“Oh,” Sirius said, slightly surprised, “Well, how’re we getting home then?”</p>
<p>Severus shrugged, and once released headed out the station. Sirius followed, still carefully watching for any wizarding folk who might recognise him, occasionally dragging Severus into alleyways or corners when he thought he saw someone familiar. Severus was grateful that it wasn’t raining. He also felt that he deserved some credit for not savaging Sirius for the constant grabbing and excessive physical contact.</p>
<p>Sirius’s jumpiness meant that their progress was extraordinarily slow, and that they both saw far more of the less aesthetically pleasing back alleys of central London than they had either perhaps ever wanted to. While it was summer, it was still England, which meant that the weather was gloomy at best. The sun was starting to set, casting flaming red all over the sky, a beautiful sight that was lost on the two teenage boys. Neither of them had yet reached a stage of their life where they could appreciate the transient beauty of nature.</p>
<p>“Snape…” Sirius said after an impressively lengthy silence, probably the longest amount of time he had ever been silent in his entire life thus far, “Where are we going? Which part of London do you live in? Are we walking there?”</p>
<p>He was clearly not aware that Severus was just wandering aimlessly around the streets, with no particular destination aside from his eventual grave in mind. Severus stared at him incredulously, saying, “I don’t live anywhere near London you dolt, and we aren’t going anywhere,”</p>
<p>Sirius, for the first time, seemed to deflate slightly. This was in no way the kind of answer he was hoping for and it seriously dented all of his plans.</p>
<p>“Oh,” he said, sitting down miserably on the wall separating the yard of a terraced house from the pavement, “Oh,”</p>
<p>Severus sat next to him, as there was little else for him to do. Luckily for both of them, the house they were loitering in front of was in fact unoccupied, as the previous owner had recently committed fraud in a way that allowed them to suddenly become rather rich, yet also meaning they needed to leave the country pronto, and therefore had vacated their grotty London house for a villa in Hawai’i. However, neither of the two knew that, and even if they had it would have had no actual impact on their lives. The only way in which it was vaguely relevant was in that there was no chance of anyone looking out their window and wondering what two slightly shady looking teenage boys were doing sitting on their wall.</p>
<p>“So we’ve both got nothing?” Sirius asked in a small voice, suddenly seeming to lack all of his usual bravado.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a family,” Severus protested, choosing to ignore the fact that he did also technically have parents himself.</p>
<p>“Only in name,” Sirius answered, “And only until they disown me,”</p>
<p>He looked up at Severus as an idea hit him, his face breaking into a brilliant smile like a sun bursting through grey clouds. Severus almost groaned, as those expressions rarely played out well for him.</p>
<p>“I’ve not been disowned yet!” he said with delight. Severus failed to see why this declaration was so exciting. He hadn’t been disowned either and he wasn’t yelling about it in delight. He also didn’t particularly care about Sirius’s family situation, mainly because he didn’t particularly care about Sirius. </p>
<p>Sirius grasped Severus’s hands in his, clearly overflowing with enthusiasm. Severus looked at their joined hands with an unimpressed expression. He was not convinced that this development was a good one. In fact, he felt that pretty much nothing about the day had been good. He was not friends with Lily, a matter of course that was unfortunately not likely to change. He had spent far more of the day in the company of Sirius than he would have liked, though given that he considered any amount of time in Sirius’s company to be something that should legally be against the Geneva Convention of human rights there was no actual time frame that he would have judged to be tolerable. Sirius continued to look passionately into his eyes, regardless of the fact that Severus wasn’t looking at him.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow we go to Gringotts and withdraw all the money from the Black vault!” he declared in a voice that was slightly louder than it really should be, given that he was suggesting something of dubious legality. Severus stared at him with an incredulous expression on his face.</p>
<p>“…No…” he said, after careful consideration that probably wasn’t actually required. It sounded like the perfect way to make enemies of the entire Black family and possibly be murdered, if they even managed to successfully withdraw all that money from under the noses of the Gringotts goblins.</p>
<p>“It’s brilliant,” Sirius continued, so used to ignoring everything Severus ever said that he barely noticed the other boy’s rejection of his genius. </p>
<p>Severus just looked at him.</p>
<p>“I still have access to the Black vaults but I don’t know for how much longer,” Sirius explained, “So we grab all the money, split it, convert it to muggle money and have a great time. It’ll be fantastic and my mother will be so annoyed,”</p>
<p>Severus was personally rather concerned about the entire plan. It seemed to mostly be focused on irritating Sirius’s mother, which was a relationship he didn’t really want to become entangled in. He had never met the woman, and he didn’t really feel that helping her disobedient son steal the family fortune would work as a good introduction, especially given the way in which rich purebloods tended to have power within the wizarding world. Somehow he imagined that stealing, even if pseudo legal by some dubious Gryffindor logic that was worryingly Slytherin, was not the way to go about integrating himself into the wizarding community and securing a promising future for himself. He resolved to find a ditch to die in post haste. It was probably the best possible option. At least if he was dead he would ’t have to listen to Sirius, though the competitive and stubborn part of him refused to die before Sirius. Maybe, he thought pensively, maybe he should find a ditch for them to die in together. That way, he would not have to put up with the ongoing misery of living while simultaneously sparing the world of having to put up with Sirius. The one issue was that it seemed faintly Romeo and Juliet, but it was a start. He could fine tune the details later. </p>
<p>Sirius seemed entirely oblivious to the fact that Severus was contemplating their deaths, caught up in the excitement of his plan.</p>
<p>“So, where should we sleep and plan?” he asked, still holding Severus’s hands. Severus had long since given up on getting them back. He was altogether far to apathetic to really protest much. Most of the fight had gone out of him when his friendship with Lily had burnt to a crisp. Life was less something that he was living, more a case of being temporarily still alive. It was almost as if his existence had ended, but no one had noticed yet so his body just continued working. He had wondered if it wouldn’t have been better if stupid Potter had been later than he had been, as if he’d been killed by Lupin as Sirius had surely intended he wouldn’t have had to experience the pain of losing Lily. Maybe everything that had followed on afterwards was a punishment for having avoided the death he had been destined for, or maybe he had actually died and this was Hell. Either interpretation made perfect sense to him.</p>
