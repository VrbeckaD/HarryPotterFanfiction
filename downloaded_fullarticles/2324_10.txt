          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Well, as you can see, Potter, I’m currently a bit preoccupied. I’m sure that whatever you need from me can be discussed at a later time. Though of course, you’re more than welcome to come in and help me speed things along, if you feel so inclined. I do request that you close the door, though.”</p><p>Potter only continues to stare, gaping at Draco with his mouth hanging open like some sort of inept goldfish. His eyes can’t seem to move from their current point of focus: Draco’s hand wrapped around his own cock, trousers and pants pushed down around his knees. Draco is tempted to tell him “my eyes are up here, Potter,” but he refrains. </p><p>A fierce blush starts to make its way up Potter’s neck, and oh, isn’t that just a beautiful sight. </p><p>Potter manages to tear his gaze away, but it can’t seem to decide where to land next. The floor, the ceiling, the plush leather armchair that Draco is currently sprawled on. Potter sucks in a shallow breath. </p><p>“Malfoy— what— why are you...”</p><p>“Why am I what, Potter? Spit it out.”</p><p>“Why are you acting so— so different?” he squeaks out. “So, er, not like you?”</p><p>“Oh, come now. I know I haven’t been the most open person in the time we’ve known each other, but really. Besides, I can’t possibly stop now. I’ve already started, why not finish? I don’t mind the company.”</p><p>Truth be told, Draco will admit that he hasn’t quite felt right since that morning. His tea hadn’t tasted quite the same as it usually did, just slightly more bitter and pungent than he would’ve liked. Ever since then, he’s been terribly restless, painfully hard and more aroused than he’s been since he was a teenager. </p><p>It may be a bit out of character, but Draco can’t very well pass up an opportunity like this one, now can he? Not with Potter standing in the doorway of his office, looking rumpled and delightfully flustered.</p><p>Draco continues looking at Potter until he’s forced to meet his eyes. “Close the door,” Draco says lowly.</p><p>Potter shudders, a tiny thing, just a slight shiver in his shoulders, but Draco sees it. Potter hesitates for a moment, looking unsure, before taking a tiny step forward, pushing the door	closed with a soft click.</p><p>He takes another step forward, the smallest of shuffles, and another, and another, until he’s standing in front of Draco. He slowly drops down, sinking his knees into the soft rug underneath them. He looks at Draco’s face, searching, before sliding his gaze down. At his collarbones, exposed between the two flaps of his unbuttoned shirt. And down, at his chest, heaving with quick, unsteady breaths. And down.</p><p>Draco didn’t think it was possible, but he’s even harder now, his cock leaking beads of his arousal under Potter’s hungry gaze. Potter swallows thickly, his hands coming up to rest on Draco’s bare thighs. The feeling of Potter’s skin on his makes him groan, and apparently that’s all it takes, because one of Potter’s hands is now wrapped around his own, and he’s moving, twisting their hands together to slide up and down Draco’s cock.</p><p>It’s fucking fantastic.</p></div>
