    <p>James was in a towering strop and as much as Albus enjoyed watching him suffer he couldn’t deny that he was somewhat surprised by the lengths his parents had gone to.  In addition to grounding him for the weekend they’d taken down the Cloaking spells that usually surrounded the back garden, making it impossible for James to practice his Quidditch.  He’d been going spare ever since, and Albus suspected that Teddy had been encouraged to visit to give the rest of them a break from his brother’s foul mood.  </p>
<p>Albus was sitting at the desk in his bedroom next to a window overlooking the garden.  Teddy, in his pragmatic way, was trying to teach James some new Quidditch moves without using brooms or magic, which made them Albus's primary entertainment for the afternoon.  Between glances out the window he was reading <i>The Three Musketeers</i> (<i>To Albus, You’re 12! Love, Aunt Hermione</i>) and thinking happily about fantastic men with mustaches who saved France when they weren’t busy having sword fights and drinking wine.  Athos, Porthos, Aramis and d’Artagnan were in an abandoned fortress eating breakfast and scheming when Albus heard a rush of feathers behind him and turned in his chair.  A slim dark hawk had just flown in through his other window and landed on the side table beneath, a scroll of parchment tied to its leg.  Pebble, who had been napping on Albus’s bedpost, flew over to greet the new arrival, tilting his head inquisitively and edging towards the hawk, which looked supremely uninterested.  Albus got up and went to them, smiling.</p>
<p>“Hello, is that for me?”</p>
<p>The hawk lifted its leg towards Albus with the composed dignity of a ballet dancer, and the angle of its head suggested that Albus would be expected to express gratitude for the privilege of its company.  Albus did this and was about to offer one of Pebble’s owl treats, but as soon as the letter had been untied the hawk spread its wings and flew out the window.  Albus watched it go and went back to his desk, breaking the black wax of the Malfoy seal, an elegant letter <i>M</i> flanked by folded dragon wings.  He unrolled the parchment and grinned to see Scorpius’s handwriting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <i>Dear Albus,<br/>
</i></p>
<p>
  <i>Did you have a good time in Margate?  I hope so.  Thank you again for my birthday present, I’m only a couple of chapters in but I like it a lot so far.  The hawk that delivered this letter was my birthday present as well.  Mum took me to Dublin to get him.  I’m glad that it’s already September next week; I can’t wait to go back to school.  There are some things I need to tell you that I don’t want to put in a letter, I’m hoping we can sit together on the train?</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Sincerely,<br/>
Scorpius</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>P.S.  I named the hawk Albus, but if that gets confusing I’ll change it.</i>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Albus laughed at the postscript but then read through the letter again, frowning.  It was by far the shortest letter he’d gotten from Scorpius that summer and he was equally intrigued and disconcerted by his friend’s caution.  Thinking carefully about his reply, he weighted the paper to his desk and rolled out a blank piece next to it.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <i>Dear Scorpius,</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Thank you for the letter.  Margate was a lot of fun, it only rained one day we were there.  Me and James got terrible sunburns and Mum made us wait an hour before she would heal them cuz we hadn’t put on sunscreen like she told us to.  But there were fireworks and ice cream and I found some really good shells.  I love the ocean but no one wants to swim for as long as I do, I can stay out for hours and barely notice.  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I wish you could have been there, I thought about you the whole time, what you would say and think about everything.  There was an old man with an accordion who sang on the street outside our hotel every night but only in French and I wished you could have been there to tell me what he was singing about.  I know you said your French isn’t that good but I bet it’s better than you think it is.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>As soon as we got back to London James was on the phone to his Muggle mates and ended up going to this party last Friday night.  He was supposed to be back by eleven but instead Dad caught him sneaking in at almost 4 Saturday morning, still pissed!  So he’s pretty much grounded until school starts and me and Lily are feeling like angels in comparison.  It’s pretty funny.  I think he might fancy a Muggle girl or something, Mum keeps sighing and saying “He’s fourteen” whenever she and Dad talk about it and think I’m not listening.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Your new hawk is awesome!  Is it the kind that you can train to hunt?  Why did you name it after me?  Also I’ve never been to Dublin, is it cool?  I’m glad you’re liking the book, I really like it too, I’m almost done.  Next summer if it works out you should come visit, or I could go to yours?  I’d love to see where you live, and I could show you all the cool places here in London!  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>And of course we can sit together on the train, I was planning on it anyway.  I hope everything’s ok, we can definitely talk then if you still want to.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>See you in September,<br/>
Albus</i>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Satisfied with this, Albus waited for the ink to dry then rolled up the parchment and melted green sealing wax onto it before impressing it with the sign of the Deathly Hallows.  Pebble, who had been watching him with interest, flew over to the desk and hopped around on one foot, chirping eagerly as he stuck his other leg into Albus’ face.  Outside James had tackled Teddy into a bed of violets and their heads were currently bent together in whispered conversation, casting paranoid glances at the house as they no doubt tried to think of a way to avoid Ginny’s wrath.  </p>
<p>“Alright, alright, hold still,” Albus muttered, tying the scroll to his owl’s small leg.  </p>
<p>Once Pebble had departed with a joyful hoot Albus absentmindedly slid his book underneath the pillow on his bed and wandered out into the hall.  Standing at the banister he could hear his sister downstairs watching YouTube in the living room while the sounds of his father starting dinner emanated from the kitchen.  Lily was laughing at what sounded like a video of someone falling off of a skateboard and Harry turned on the water; Albus pictured him filling a pot to put on the stove.  Movement in his periphery made Albus turn his head and he started to see his mother standing just to the side of the window seat, looking down into the back garden with a smirk.  She was barefoot, wearing cut-off shorts and one of his father’s grey t-shirts, her long red hair hanging over one shoulder in a messy braid.  Their holiday at the beach had brought out all of the freckles on her pale skin and he liked that she never tried to cover them with makeup.  </p>
<p>“Have you been watching this too?”  She asked, nodding to him.  He smiled and went over to her.</p>
<p>“Yah, are they still having kittens over the flowers?”</p>
<p>She folded her arms across her chest and leaned against the wall, looking down to where James and Teddy were now crouching in the grass, clumsily trying to scoop and fluff the battered violets back into shape with their hands.  Albus laughed and then checked himself, glancing at his mother.  Ginny rolled her eyes and shook her head, smiling.</p>
<p>“I’ll go out there later tonight and put down some more of Neville’s QwikGro; I just like watching them fuss,” she looked at him pointedly, “but I didn’t say any of that out loud.”</p>
<p>Albus grinned.</p>
<p>“I didn’t hear anything.”</p>
<p>She reached out and pulled him to her, wrapping her arms around his shoulders from behind and pressing her face to the top of his head as they watched James and Teddy.<br/>
</p>
<p>“I found one of your books inside of a <i>folded</i> pillow case in the linen closet this morning, any idea how it got there?”</p>
<p>Albus blinked, trying to remember.</p>
<p>“Oh!  Was it <i>Gilgamesh</i>?  I had it with me while I was folding laundry yesterday.”</p>
<p>Ginny laughed.</p>
<p>“That’s the one.  My baffling child; I can’t take you anywhere.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Mum.”</p>
<p>She kissed the top of his head and swayed him from side to side a little.</p>
<p>“Did you get a letter from Scorpius today?”</p>
<p>“Yah.”</p>
<p>“How’s he doing?”</p>
<p>Albus sighed, his good mood slipping a little.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure; he seems kind of gloomy.”</p>
<p>Ginny was quiet.</p>
<p>“Summers can be lonely sometimes,” she said, sounding thoughtful, “Especially when you live in the country.  Even at the Burrow with your uncles I would get so lonely in the summer.”</p>
<p>“And he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters.”</p>
<p>He felt her chin in his hair as she nodded.</p>
<p>“I’m glad he has you.”</p>
<p>Albus smiled and leaned into her so that she would hold him tighter, which she did.</p>
<p>“Me too.”</p>
