I think that it’s time that we’re using some better terminology, is all,” he shrugged. </p><p>“Like what?” Dean asked, turning on his side so that he could face Seamus better. “And why?”</p><p>“Because calling you my best friend sounds ridiculously stupid, and calling you my lover makes me feel like a character from an Oscar Wilde play.”</p><p>“Heh. ‘Lover,’” Dean snickered. “Do you ever actually say that?”</p><p>“I do when I’m failing to find another word,” Seamus shrugged. “Like, don’t you think it’s time that we just called a spade a spade, here?”</p><p>“So what? Boyfriend? Is that what you wanted? Because I don’t give a fuck what you call it, Shay. Boyfriend is fine with me.” </p><p>“Oh. Well... Yeah. That’s what I... Yeah.” Seamus grinned. “I just... I dunno. It seemed like a strange word to pull out without checking.”</p><p>Dean nodded. He could see that. </p><p>“Well, I am 100% okay with it. But, just to be sure, I think that you should come closer so that we can seal the arrangement with boyfriend-type kissing.”</p><p>“Only kissing?” Seamus raised an eyebrow, but moved closer to Dean. </p><p>“Well, you’re the one who didn’t like saying ‘lover’,” Dean snickered.</p></div>
