    <p>Harry snuck around the corner, hoping no one would see him sneaking down to the dungeons. Seeing a familiar girl, he hid behind a set of armor. "Parkinson!"</p><p>     The pug-faced girl halted, and looked around. "Potter? What do you want?" Sneering, she walked over to where he was hiding. </p><p>      "I need your help. This school has a serious problem, and only you will be able to help me." His eyes were almost pleading. </p><p>     "And why should I trust you? We hate each other, remember?" She gave him a calculating glance, looking him over. </p><p>     Harry grabbed his wand and handed it over to her. "There. Now I'm unarmed. Now can you please help me? It's about Malfoy." </p><p>     The effect of those words was instantaneous. Immediately Pansy stood up straighter, and dragged Harry into a broom closet. "Talk. Now. What is going on with Draco."</p><p>     "Haven't you noticed? The school hasn't had a single green apple for about a year, and the only one ever seen eating them is Malfoy! He has a serious problem." </p><p>     "Wait a minute. Potter. How on earth did you manage to notice that? I sit next to him every day, don't you think I would've noticed that?" Pansy was incredulous. </p><p>      "Well, you might, if you weren't so busy staring after Zabini."</p><p>      Pansy flushed, her face turning a shade of red to rival Ron's. "I don't stare at Blaise! And... Hey! You didn't answer my question! Why did you manage to notice that Draco has a serious apple obsession? Wait... have you been watching him?" Pansy's grin widened, happy to be able to throw off the Golden Boy. </p><p>     "I... I may have been... observing?" Harry quickly turned his head, avoiding eye contact. </p><p>     "You have been watching him! I knew it!" Pansy started giggling. </p><p>     "That isn't the point Parkinson! Are you gonna help me or not?" He glared at Pansy, silencing her. "Please..." </p><p>     "Fine, but I'm doing this for Draco, I hope you know that! Meet me on the Quidditch Pitch before dinner. Draco likes to fly before then. I'm also bringing Blaise, he can help." With that, Pansy strode out of the closet. </p><p>     After waiting a brief period of time, Harry snuck out and headed down to his first class of the day. Walking into the Potions classroom, he sat down next to Ron and Hermione. </p><p>     "Harry! Where have you been? You know Professor Snape doesn't like it when you're late. You barely made it on time!" Hermione automatically started. Thankfully, her montage was cut short by Snape walking through the doors, his cape billowing out behind him.</p><p>     "Today we will be making a Mimic Potion. If brewed correctly, the user will repeat everything said for three hours. If brewed incorrectly, the consequences may be.... severe. This is a simple potion, and I expect even the most dimwitted of you all shall be able to brew it properly." Snape's eyes lingered on Harry, Ron, and Neville. "We are going to make this potion in pairs. Potter, you're with Malfoy." Ignoring the strangled protests, he continued on. "Zabini, with Parkinson.Weasley, you're with Bulstrode. Longbottom, with Granger." He then continued to pair up the rest of the class. </p><p>     Harry picked up his bag, and headed towards the blond. Throwing his stuff down, he sat next to him. </p><p>     "You better not mess this simple potion up, Potter. I'm not taking a failing grade for you."  Malfoy opened the book to the required page. "Go get the ingredients, Potter. Surely even you can do that correctly." </p><p>      Mumbling to himself, Harry went to grab them. He made sure to double check them, so as not to anger the blond. He wanted to prove to everyone he knew what he was doing, and since Draco couldn't sabotage him without sabotaging himself, he knew he could today. Returning to the workbench, he placed the ingredients on the table. "Everything on there." </p><p>      "Thank you Potter." Malfoy was working intently, already adding and mixing. He hadn't even noticed he thanked Harry. He quickly became absorbed in his work.</p><p>      Harry had to admit he had never seen Malfoy up close, without either of them attacking each other. He took this time to study his rival. His eyes, which he had always seen as grey, were more of a silvery blue. He quickly turned away, before Malfoy could notice him staring, and began handing ingredients when asked. Before too long, the potion was perfect. Harry couldn't hide the massive grin that spread across his face. However, he didn't hide it in time. Malfoy had turned to say something, and noticed his smile.</p><p>    "What are you smiling for Potter?" Malfoy sneered slightly. </p><p>    Harry felt the grin slide off of his face. "No reason Malfoy. Let's go hand it in." They both filled up a vial and marked it, and left it on Snape's desk. As they were walking past Neville's cauldron on the way back, they heard an ominous hissing sound. Harry made eye contact and immediately understood the situation. He yelled at everyone to get down, but Malfoy was too busy gloating about the perfect potion to anyone that would listen. Taking a deep breath, Harry flung himself at Malfoy, knocking him down to the ground, getting the full blast of the potion when it exploded. </p><p>   "Potter. Get off me!" Malfoy struggled to push the limp body off of him. "Potter! Potter! Harry!! Get up!" Malfoy was getting frustrated with him, until he realized Harry wasn't responding. "Professor! Get over here! Something's wrong with him!" </p><p>   "Out of my way everyone. Neville. What was the last ingredient that you put in?" Snape was by Harry's side, checking his pulse. </p><p>    "Er... I-I believe it was the 4 newt tails?" Neville's timid voice rang out across the deathly silent room.</p><p>    "You idiotic boy! It was newt eyes! Malfoy, help me get him to the hospital wing. Everyone else, bottle up your potions and put them on my desk. Granger, please put the exploded potion in one as well, just in case we need to identify it." With that, Harry was supported by Malfoy and Snape and swept out of the room. Ron made eye contact with Hermione. "Was it just me or did Malfoy seem worried to you?" </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>    Harry was deposited on a bed in the infirmary, and Madam Pomfrey bustled out of her room, demanding to know what happened. Snape immediately filled her in. He then proceeded to ask to be excused, as he had to go clean up the classroom. Malfoy, however, stayed behind. </p><p>    "Will he be okay, Madam Pomfrey?" The boy averted his eyes, which was unnatural for him, as he normally was full of self-confidence.</p><p>    "I believe he will. I believe he just got knocked out. The potion exploded, right?"</p><p>    "Yes... if it wasn't for him, I would've gotten hit. He knocked me over when I wasn't paying attention. I was too busy bragging... This is my fault." </p><p>     "Are you all right Mister Malfoy? You aren't acting like yourself." Worry etched Madam Pomfrey's face. Before she could push a little further to see what was wrong, a strangled groan arose from the bed. "Oh thank heavens you're alright!" She rushed to his side and began taking his vitals. </p><p>   "Why are you here Malfoy?" Harry's voice was slowly gaining strength. </p><p>   "I-I wanted to thank you, for knocking me out of the way." Malfoy's face had a faint tinge of pink. "I also wanted to make sure you were okay. I actually enjoyed working with you in class today. You made a better partner than I expected. How come you never do that well in class with anyone else?" </p><p>   Harry nearly snorted with laughter. "I don't because you always sabotage me. Well, you, Crabbe, and Goyle. But seriously Malfoy, it wasn't as horrible as I expected either. Well, until I nearly died. That wasn't pleasant, but at least I fulfilled my quota of one-near death experience per year."</p><p>   Draco surprised him by laughing. "Glad you're okay Harry. I'm gonna head to Transfiguration. See you around." </p><p>   "See you, Malfoy." Only after Malfoy left, did Harry realize that he called him Harry. A small blush spread across his face. He turned to Madam Pomfrey, who was watching the exchange with amused eyes. "When will I be released?" </p><p>    "After classes. I don't really fancy you visiting me twice in one day, Mister Potter. While I do enjoy the company, you are in here way too much. I still don't know how you end up here so often, especially on the first day back at school. I still find it hard to believe you fell down stairs at your home while bringing your trunk down." She was reminiscing, and didn't notice Harry's face go dark. Harry knew she would become suspicious after a while. </p><p>    "I am just really clumsy, Madam Pomfrey. I fall way too often." He hoped she wouldn't notice the lie. </p><p>    "Hm, alright." Madam Pomfrey nodded her head once, but she was beginning to grow worried. If he was abused, it would explain a lot. Later she would meet with Professor McGonagall to see if she knew anything about his home life. "Alright, lay down. Get some rest while you can. If you need me, I will be in the next room over." She left the room and headed to her office. </p><p>     Harry sighed. I think she knows... she can't know. Nobody can know. He will kill me if they know. He settled into the bed, and allowed himself to think happy thoughts, such as eating a green apple for the first time in over a year, hugging Malfoy, treacle tart. It only took him one second to shoot up, realizing he had just thought about hugging Malfoy. Shaking his head, he sunk into the blankets. It was probably just the potion he was hit with. He would never think about that normally. He closed his eyes, hoping everything would be resolved tonight before dinner. With that comforting thought, he fell asleep.</p>
