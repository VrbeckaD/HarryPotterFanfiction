    <p>Gellert didn’t know why he was even there, but he heard something that reminded him of his native country and there he saw him.</p><p>He was dancing, singing pagan songs in German and his blackened heart was captured in instant. He was mesmerized. The boy… man was singing about Walpurgisnacht, as if celebrating it as old folks once did. There was something eerie about him, as if he wasn’t even human… He must have been a wizard; no muggle could have this kind of magical aura.</p><p>So Gellert stayed and watched him, completely smitten with his beauty, his freckles, gentle eyes and full lips. He wondered if the freckles continued, if his body was covered in them. Soon the song changed, but he wasn’t very happy about it – it was a duet with… some woman. He wanted to be there instead of her, singing with him, he was already his in his mind. He didn’t like he was singing with someone else like this. His hand was twitching to the elder wand to… he didn’t know what he wanted to do first, take him or kill that woman. But he realized where he was and that he couldn’t risk spoiling his plans right now. He would wait for him. And then, he would take him.</p><p>So he stayed in the corner, watching him with mismatched eyes full of desire. He took a break, others sang instead of him, yet his eyes never strayed from him. He didn’t think he noticed him but then his dark golden eyes met his and he smiled at him. He could have sworn his heart tried to leave his chest in that moment.</p><p>Then it was his time again. This time, he sang sad song, about dead love with such emotion he got jealous of the man in the song. His eyes gleamed possessively as he watched him. No, he wouldn’t let anyone else have him. He will lock him where only he can see him, where he can’t get hurt, where he would be only his. If needed, he would obliviate him until he couldn’t remember anything but him.</p><p>Then it all ended and he disappeared somewhere in the back of the inn. He silently exited the inn and went to the back of the building to wait for his mysterious muse. And yet he was surprised again, because he was already there with his smile, dark golden eyes looking at him and case in his hands. He only held his eyes for few seconds and then he immediately averted his eyes as if he was embarrassed.</p><p>“Hello,” his muse was first to talk with eyes still on the ground and gentle smile as if he knew who he was and why he was there.</p><p>“Hello liebling. You were spectacular back there,” Gellert smiled with dark desire in his eyes as his eyes slowly moved down his body. His own hand was slowly sneaking to elder wand, prepared to take his liebling with him.</p><p>“Thank you,” he answered with cheeks dusted with red. He looked so… cute in Gellert’s eyes.</p><p>“Ah, liebling. Your talents and you are wasted there. Come with me, mein liebling. I promise I will take good care of you. I will give you the world,” Grindelwald’s tone changed into seductive one as he made slows steps towards the beauty in front of him.</p><p>“I-I fear I can’t,” came from the mystery man he really didn’t want to hear. But he wasn’t letting him go.</p><p>“Ah, I didn’t want to hear that,” tutted Grindelwald and almost took his hand so he could apparate with him. He really didn’t want to hurt him in any way; he couldn’t bring himself to even think of using a spell to bind him. But then the mysterious man disappeared with golden sparks seconds before he could grab his arm and reappeared few meters away.</p><p>“I really can’t. I am sorry, but…” his muse was shaking his head and had strange expression on his face, it was mixture of sadness and some kind of understanding but resolution burned deep in his eyes and there was something that reminded him of mother reprimanding her child.</p><p>“Why, mein liebling?” he asked him as he started to move towards him again.</p><p>“You want to change the world through war, through violence and force. I have seen this; it won’t last and will bring more suffering than happiness. I just can’t…” he smiled at him with such a sad smile it was hurting him. He registered what he said. How he knew... this? He wasn't really that vocal in public, yet. He tried to get to him again, but he realized his beauty was going to disappear again, this time for good.</p><p>“I-I just hope you will stop when you still can… Maybe then we will see each other again…” he met his eyes again. Gellert knew this was goodbye.</p><p>“Wait—!” he tried to stop him, but it was too late. His outstretched hand felt only air and gentle golden sparks that he left there.</p><p>He was standing alone in the night only with memories of the mysterious ginger beauty.</p><p>“I promise I will find you again, mein liebling. And I will not let you go again,” Gellert promised the night and disappeared.</p>
