    <p>“I will pay you five hundred dollars to buy and drop off a hundred packages of unsalted butter at my place,” says Percival when Newt picks up the phone. </p><p>“Um,” says Newt, because he’d TAed an undergraduate night lab yesterday and then stayed up to get in another five pages on his thesis and was sleeping in to make up for it. He runs a hand through his hair, turns over, and fumbles around for his alarm clock. The hands claim it’s later than it could possibly be. “Wait - is it really past noon?”</p><p>“It really is,” says Percival, sounding a little bit like he was carrying an elephant on his back whilst walking up the fire escape of a skyscraper. Newt frowns and sits up in bed. “Please, Newt, I’m all out, and I have something in the oven.”</p><p>“I thought you were supposed to be resting,” he says. Percival had been banned from the office on account of having the flu. He has an edge to his voice that makes Newt suspicious.</p><p>“I <em>am</em> resting, I just need something to do,” says Percival. In the background, Newt can hear the sound of a stand mixer running at maximum speed. There’s a sharp <em>crack</em>, like an egg breaking, and Percival curses under his breath. “I don’t know why I keep trying that with one hand when the yolks break every single time. I’m working on macarons, but I’m out of cream and anyway there’s a recipe for shortbread I really want to try -”</p><p>“Percival, are you okay?” Newt asks bluntly, his eyes narrowed, already throwing the covers off.</p><p>“… They started a building project the next lot over,” Percival says quietly. “The noise … ”</p><p>“Do you want to come stay with me?” Newt asks immediately. “As long as you need.”</p><p>“I’m <em>sick</em>, I don’t want to get you sick too,” says Percival.</p><p>“It’s been a week. You’re probably not contagious anymore,” says Newt. He pulls on the first pair of trousers he lays hands on and casts about for a shirt. The one he ends up wearing is one he not-so-accidentally stole from Percival. A little too large, but it’s not like his boyfriend is going to care.</p><p>“Newt,” Percival says helplessly after a long silence. “I’m not good company right now.”</p><p>“The offer’s open,” says Newt. “You don’t have to decide now. If - If that means you want to come over today or tomorrow or next week - Whenever. And whatever you decide, I’ll be over in an hour and a half with your butter, okay?”</p><p>“Yeah,” says Percival. “Okay. Drive safe?”</p><p>“Always,” says Newt, plucking his keys off the hanger. “See you in a bit.”</p>
