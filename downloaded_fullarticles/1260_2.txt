</p><p align="left"> </p><p><br/> Ashes. Ashes underfoot. The taste of ashes heavy on his tongue. </p><p> </p><p>That was the first thing that Ambrose Hollington* observed as he patiently allowed his eyes to adjust to normal sight in the aftermath of his Apparition to the spot that he now stood upon.</p><p> </p><p>Familiar agony flashed through his soul as he gazed at the blackened grounds, the burnt stumps of the once stunning orchards and the slagged masonry of what was once the seat of the Ancient and Noble House of Potter, his childhood home.</p><p> </p><p>Struggling to prevent himself from being overcome by the ghost-like whispers of despair, fear, pain and grief that emanated from this once hallowed place, the tall youth clenched his trembling hands into fists and bowed his head, the inky locks of his hair obscure the haunting remains. His vision blurred dark grey eyes as moisture dripped down his cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>It had been fourteen years to the day when his quiet, but otherwise happy life had been destroyed in a maelstrom of destruction and death. He had just celebrated his seventh birthday with his mother Dorea Potter, formerly of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black and his fathers, Charlus Potter, the proxy of his brother and familial patriarch in the halls of the Wizengamot, and Menelaus Hollington-de Deslizarse*, Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Hollington. While his uncle Fleamont and Aunt Euphemia were otherwise engaged abroad, and James and his other cousin Sirius were at Hogwarts, making more mischief, he and his small family were comfortably situated in Wales at the family home, making plans to travel to Papa Menelaus' estate in the mountains of Portugal when an intense wave of heat, a roar of wind and the screams of the house-elves preceded the sudden explosion that rent apart the East Wing Parlor that they had been having morning tea in.</p><p> </p><p>His fathers had instantly thrown all of their magic into making a shield to protect them all from the impact, but they were not fast enough to save his mother, who had placed a shield of her own around him. He could never forget the way her grey eyes had echoed with her love and determination an instant before the cursed flames consumed her body.</p><p> </p><p>He had been sent plummeting down three stories as the Manor began to crumble under the unexpected assault. While he hadn't been critically injured due in no small part to the shield, he had been scared witless, overwhelmed by shock and lack of comprehension of what he had witnessed before his very eyes. Distantly, he could hear the sounds of curses and spells being cast, and the screams of anguish that would periodically echo into the cavern that had been carved from the lower floor of the Manor. He remembered crying in abject terror, wailing for his mum and for Father and Papa as more explosions erupted, flashes of green bursting in front of his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Two dark robed, and masked men had managed to blast their way through the rubble and had discovered his place of concealment. He thought that they would help him, but was completely unprepared for them to fling Avada Kedavra curses at him. He would have died, <em>should</em> have died that day, but just as the magic from his mother's shield fizzled out and death flew at him with gleaming emerald jaws, Flixsy and Memy, his parents' personal house-elves appeared out of no where, Memy guarding him, allowing the two curses to slam into his back while Flixsy moved the rubble out of the way and instantly Apparated away with him.</p><p> </p><p>The loyal elves must have been attempting to get him to the Hollington Manor which was completely Unplottable and its location only known to his parents (and perhaps Uncle Fleamont), but they were forced to Disapparate when they slammed into the Anti-Apparition field and plummeted to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>Flixsy did her best to protect his body in the fall, but she was young and not trained to serve as a protector. While thankfully, he did not break any bones upon his landing, as he tumbled to a stop, his face and neck were sliced by sharpened pieces of broken stone, not that he had felt the tear along his flesh as overwhelmed as he had been that day.</p><p> </p><p>All he could remember was Flixsy screaming and snapping her fingers, the sensation of an egg cracking over him and running down his body, her strident tones as she raged against the attackers, and the sound of a wet gurgle as a small body dropped several feet away from him, and overwhelming terror that the evil people who were attacking them would hurt him next. Everything from that point faded to black.</p><p> </p><p>The next thing he recalled was whimpering in pain as he stirred briefly to waking consciousness, trying in vain to push himself up from his prone position when he heard a sharp 'crack'. Freezing, he huddled behind the larger stones as <em>he</em> appeared, an old man with a long and magnificent beard, cresent shaped glasses, sharp blue eyes and robed in turquoise colored robes.</p><p> </p><p>He remembered the way the old man had looked for a brief moment sadder than anyone he had ever seen, before his eyes hardened and he spoke the words that forever damned him in the young Ambrose's eyes, unknowingly ensuring the resolve of an implacable enemy:</p><p> </p><p>"So...", the aged wizard had whispered into the night sky. "it is done. If only poor Fleamont had given heed to my counsel, rather than aligning himself with the suspect policies of Charlus and Dorea...such a tragedy would not have been a necessity. Such wanton loss of life when the lives of our people are already so few and so precious...".</p><p> </p><p>The wizard stretched out his wand then and had performed some kind of spell, though for the life of him Ambrose didn't know what it was, sliding the long and unusual looking wand back into the folds of his voluminous robes after a moment.</p><p> </p><p>"No survivors," he had muttered next—words that had frozen Ambrose's heart— "I wish this didn't have to be done...but no matter, no matter. Fleamont and Euphemia will be devastated, a terrible position to be in emotionally when attempting to treat a virulent strain of the dragonpox. This loss will propel their own declension, and lead to their deaths.  That will leave young James alone and confused, bereft of his loved ones and far more malleable than before. Unmoored, he will seek wisdom and proper guidance and in so doing, avoid his father and uncle's unfortunate mistakes. And in time...matters will fall in accordance to my design. I wish this didn't have to be so, but so it must be...for the Greater Good."</p><p> </p><p>He might have muttered more to himself, but Ambrose couldn't recall, as the shock, pain and anger from the unexpected events drove him back into the realm of shadows and silence. The next memory he was cognizant of was awakening in Spain, the face of his Papa's consigliere and family friend, Sir Thaddeus Cossel-Tellinore* staring down upon him, grief etched into his normally cheerful and ruddy face.</p><p> </p><p>With a strangled gasp, Ambrose shook off the haunting memories, and straightened himself to his full height. He wasn't a scared little boy anymore. He was stronger than this! He had prepared for the emotional shock...</p><p> </p><p>Forcing his hands to unclench themselves, he forced his feet to move through the ruins, occasionally levitating rocks and boulders out of his way as he stepped towards the approximate spot where he lost his mother to hatred and to the perfidious schemes of the uncouth fool who all but claimed control over these lands. His hands trembled as he drew closer and closer to the site of his greatest loss. The oppressive nature of the massacre pressed in on him at all angles, beating against his shielded mind. It took a great deal of effort to push through the psionic detritus and move ever closer, but at last, he found himself drawing level with the crumbled walls of the Manor.</p><p> </p><p>Taking a deep breath, the young sorcerer solemnly approached the spot where his life was spared at the cost of his mother's. Falling to his knees, ignoring the ash staining his leathers, Ambrose bowed his head and wept. He wept for the years of bereavement that had only been compounded four years later with the deaths of his cousin James and his young wife. He wept for what seemed like hours.</p><p> </p><p>All things must end however, and after an undetermined length of time, Ambrose's sobs faded into the grey morning dawn, as he leaned back on his haunches and studied the spot where he watched his mother's last moments.</p><p> </p><p>"I hated myself for living," he began haltingly. "Living in a world where I would no longer see you and Papa and Father together. For a long time, I wished to die so I could be re-united with you all. I was never able to commit to the deed however," he added with a burst of bitterness and self-loathing, "as much as I wanted to be re-united with you, I was too afraid to leave the shell of this world."</p><p> </p><p>Placing his hand on the spot where Dorea Potter nee Black had succumbed to the cursed fire, he concentrated his focus, willing tendrils of pure magic to burrow deep past the cracked stone into the earth beneath it, delving further and further until he touched something, something that filled his mind with such a sharp echo of his mother's gentle beauty that he gasped aloud. Tears sprang once more in his eyes, but this time Ambrose did not give in to his grief. Instead, he narrowed his dark eyes and drew on that reminder of happier days, coaxing the concealed gift to rise steadily through the earth, carefully nudging away the stone and burnt metal that obscured its presence, until at last, a single flower pushed through the earth and rose, stretching out towards the sky.</p><p> </p><p>A muffled laugh, burst from his throat as the violet and fuchscia bud slowly began to open, drinking in the invisible nourishment from the sky. He smiled, despite the tears as such violets were always the flowers that his mother Dorea liked best.</p><p> </p><p>"How fitting Madame," he murmured into the brightening sky, "that the flower you loved best should commerate your beauty and power for years to come." With whispered spells, he secured the space around the flower and shielded it against any shifting stone, or encroaching weeds, feeding his essence into the flower that it would continue to bloom and prosper, even without the necessary tending that such flowers required in order to flourish.</p><p> </p><p>Rising to his feet, young man bowed his head reverently towards the flower.</p><p> </p><p>"By land, by sky, and by sea," he whispered quietly, "by flesh, and blood and bone, I swear to you Dorea of the House of Black, Charlus of the House of Potter and Menelaus of the House of Hollington and el Casa de Deslizarse that I will see your murders avenged, your slayers destroyed, and your betrayer brought to ruin. By the blood of my blood who were betrayed by those who owed them reverence and all due honor, I will see your hopes and your Houses restored. In name of the Ancient Ones, so be it."</p><p> </p><p>A sudden sense of vertigo swept through him and he stumbled back as for the briefest of moments...a Presence seemed to loom over him as if to acknowledge his oath  before retreating, leaving behind only a tingling sensation all throughout his body that quickly faded into nothing.</p><p> </p><p>He stood there, staring at the vibrant flower, the only splash of light in the oppressive gloom of the surrounding ruins as he contemplated the vows he had made when a sharp 'crack' caused him to whirl around, his wand dropping immediately from his concealed holster into his hand as he observed the displacement of air that provided a visual announcement of an Apparition. His wand was already raised when he recognized the form and appearance of his visitor and sighed irritably, lowering his wand to his side. For his part, the unannounced visitor kept his hands visible as he walked towards the younger man.</p><p> </p><p>Lines of stress and grief now marred the visage of his visitor's face, but his hair was still a firm mixture of ebony and steel, brown eyes normally laughing, but now darkened with his own memories of grief and a shared loss. Clad in the exorbitant ceremonial robes of the chief delegates of the International Confederation of Wizards, Mugwump Cossel-Tellinore, cut a striking figure as he strode to Ambrose's side. Silently, the older man mutely bowed his head at the space in the ground where Ambrose had raised the testament to his mother's bravery and self-sacrificing soul. He remained that way for a number of minutes, before raising his head, fingers flashing in an arcane sigil of blessing, sealed as he lowered himself to the ground and touched his fingers upon the spot where his mother had lost her life.</p><p> </p><p>Pushing himself back to his feet, the older wizard turned to Ambrose, grief glittering in his eyes...along with a familiar rage, a rage that was echoed in equal measure by Ambrose. The pain in his eyes however, were mingled with a glimmer of triumph, causing a swell of excitement to spring in the younger wizard's heart.</p><p> </p><p>"It is done," said the ICW-delegate abruptly, in lieu of a greeting. "The Council has voted on the measures that our Educational Secretariat have been pushing for the last two years. The old bastard tried his best of course to twist the legislation to keep as many loopholes as possible to his benefit, but the Council did not yield, thankfully. As of three hours ago, the International Educational Evaluation and Reform Act is now the law of all member-nations."</p><p> </p><p>Ambrose stared at his guardian and mentor uncomprehendingly for a few seconds, before a vicious smile began to form on his face.</p><p> </p><p>"So it begins at last," he murmured.</p><p> </p><p>"It does indeed young one," replied Mugwump Tellinore, an equally vicious smile lighting up his face. "It took three years, and two appeals, but it is now law, no matter what our illustrious and ever-wise Supreme Mugwump would like to see happen. It is a great victory for those among our body who seek to ensure that graduates of ICW-representative schools do so in accordance to a standard that will enable all to pursue higher educational or vocational studies anywhere in the world that they wish without having to submit to extensive remedial examinations depending on which country they seek to advance their potential careers in. And a blow to those among us who seek to abandon the practices and teachings that are unique to each member-state and form an integral part of their history and national identity. With this Act in place, the upcoming generation of students will be able to trust that regardless of where they enroll, they will not be fed pernicious theories that will undermine our most sacred and fundamental laws and traditions. It will ensure that the Statute remains secure, and yet the younglings far more cognizant of the advances of the mundane population, its history and the challenges of co-existence with them."</p><p> </p><p>"Furthermore," he emphasized, resting a firm hand upon the taller youth's broad shoulders, "it is an opportunity. It will enable us to lay the foundations for our most important task, a task that will ensure that your fallen House is restored to its former glory, and those who utterly betrayed their oaths of fealty brought to justice. And why?"</p><p> </p><p>Ambrose considered the question briefly, his mind readily supplying the answer.</p><p> </p><p>"If the youth are educated to learn of the past, of what used to be the shape of our people...they will prove more amenable to support a restoration to that former state, especially as they learn the many ways that the leaders they have so lately placed their trust in have betrayed them all...".</p><p> </p><p>"Exactly," hissed Mugwump Tellinore. "The truth of Angevin's Fall will be revealed and the chance for Angevin's rise will manifest itself. Britain, Ireland and the Continent...they are weary of war and tumult. Many still suffer under the trauma of Grindelwald's crusade, suffering still more under the terror created by that wretched pretender to the legacy of the Noble heirs of the House of Slytherin. The arts magical have suffered as fear and paranoia have led to excessive and ill-defined restrictions and bans. That must be corrected. The rapidly fraying relations between the magi and the Children of Leaf and Star must be arrested, for we cannot prosper if our brethren of other Races have all turned against us. The ancient Rites must once again be observed in their purity, not meshed with the corrupted ravings of blood purism, which only plays into the false narratives forced down the throats of the general public by those who arrogantly and foolishly label themselves as the paragons of Light...as if that equates to the concept of morality, of 'Good'! This will open the doors for our purposes to advance; slowly of course, steadily, incrementally, but inexorably. If we move with caution and yet dispatch, much can be accomplished...as your good parents dreamed."</p><p> </p><p>He sighed as Ambrose stiffened, withdrawing his clasp on his shoulders as he stepped around to face the tall and youthful wizard. His eyes softened with pity and with his own grief as he raised his hand to the man's pale face.</p><p> </p><p>"You have excelled at every lesson, every trial, every test that I have put you through," murmured the Mugwump. "You have pushed your magic, your body and your mind further than I had ever dreamed possible. Know this, that no matter what the final results of our opening gambit might be, you have already honored the memory of your noble parents and your ancestors. You have accomplished much, and will accomplish more. It has been my solemn privilege and joy to step in the place of your parents to raise and educate you. I'm proud of you, Ambrose. Menelaus, Charlus and Dorea are proud of you. Never forget that, understand?"</p><p> </p><p>The face he caressed, trembled, but Ambrose nodded jerkily. Pleased, the elder wizard lowered his hands and using a fraction of his magic, conjured a roll of parchment, sealed with the sigil marking official documentation of the International Confederation. Taking a deep breath, Mugwump Tellinore extended the roll to Ambrose, who took it, an unspoken question alight in his stormy eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"You may read the scroll of course," Tellinore said brusquely, "but know that on behalf of the Educational Secretariat of the International Confederation of Wizards, I, Thaddeus Cossel-Tellinore, a member of the Council of Mugwumps do confer upon you, Ambrose Julianus Melenaus, Heir Apparent to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Hollington, Marqués del Valle de la Serpiente and El Jefe de la Casa de Deslizarse, Heir Presumptive of the Ancient and Noble House of Potter, Heir Claimant of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Peverell, Son of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, the mantle of Chief Representative Envoy of the Office of the Educational Secretariat of the International Confederation to the Ministry of Magic for Britain and Ireland and all Schools and Educational Facilities held within its dominion. You are herewith authorized to represent the International Confederation in all matters concerning the ratification of, enforcement of and implementation of the International Educational Evaluation and Reform Act. As part of your remit, you will oversee a delegation of envoys who will ensure that all educational facilities within the domain of Britain and Ireland are cognizant of and in compliance with the IEERA. Should any educational facility fail to act in accordance with the Act, or if the Ministry should fail to properly ensure its ratification and immediate implementation, you are herewith designated by the Mugwump Council the highest authority on these matters, with power to lay fines on any facility that fails to comply with this Act, and should persistent violations continue, power to levy a citation of contempt upon this member state with the attendant penalties therewith. Your authorization will not be superseded by the authority of the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation owing to the Council's ruling that the Supreme Mugwump is hereby recused from all matters related to the implementation of the Act, due to a two-fold conflict of interest in these matters. Will you accept this task and carry out the duties wherewith you have been entrusted faithfully and in full compliance with the appropriate Statutes ratified by the International Confederation?"</p><p> </p><p>Ambrose's hands shook as he grasped the scroll, but his eyes hardened with determination as the magic ratifying his appointment swirled overhead.</p><p> </p><p>"I will."</p><p> </p><p>Both gentlemen sucked in their breaths as a faint shimmer of golden light flared briefly into visible existence before sinking into the scroll that both grasped and flowing into both men for a long moment before fading away. Ambrose's chest rose and fell as he adjust to the weight of the magic that would be immediately identifiable if any one within the British Ministry or its Wizengamot attempted to dispute his right to administer the process of ratification and ensure its implementation.</p><p> </p><p>Mugwump Tellinore smiled at his younger companion.</p><p> </p><p>"And now, my young friend...the rest is up to you. You have been well taught, and I expect that you will prove more than ready to face the challenges that stand in the way of your ultimate mission."</p><p> </p><p>Grey eyes shot towards his brown eyes and held his stare for a long moment.</p><p> </p><p>"And now," continued the older man, gently. "It is time to let this land rest and renew."</p><p> </p><p>Nodding tersely, Ambrose turned once more and inclined his head in a graceful acknowledgement of the violet blossom in front of him, before straightening himself once more and stepping out of the rubble back towards the blackened fields. When he found a large enough clear space, he closed his eyes and began to settle his mind through the art of the sacred breath. Releasing the sorrow, the memories of loss and the rage that had consumed him for years, the young sorcerer drew in his breath for five counts, held it in for the same and released his breath in five counts. Again and again, he breathed in accordance to the lessons he had received from the <em>Rinpoche</em> who administered the mystic monastery that he had studied in over the past four years after graduating from the Magical Academy of Ibiza, all the while willing his reservoir of magic to act as a magnet to draw the energies he desired towards him. As the minutes passed, he gradually felt the pull on his magic and rather than allow his energies to disperse, willed them to draw on the maiasmic tendrils of death and foulness that had penetrated the once cheerful grounds for over a decade. Raising his hands, he willed the oppressive weight of the foul magic to manifest.</p><p> </p><p>Standing several feet away, in respectful silence, Mugwump Tellinore gasped as the very air around them began to darken, inky spools of magic rising from the ground, the ruined stones and slagged metal of the Manor, materializing from the air itself as Ambrose focused his will upon the land of his father's family. Silently, the older politician watched as the magic gathered slowly but surely into a howling, swirling maelstrom that shrieked and raged in front of the young wizard whose will was forcing the long latent traces of the magic wielded against the rightful owners to coalesce together in a more or less tangible shape.</p><p> </p><p>Ambrose's mouth moved silently, but Tellinore could not discern what words were being spoken as he enforced his will upon the magic that had long poisoned his land. He could however see the form that his magic took as it prepared to dispel the unwanted energies and his eyes widened as a glittering, spiral chain of golden fire began to form down his long arms, ancient symbols and runic formations resolving into view.</p><p> </p><p>For several minutes he watched the maelstrom grow deeper and more tangible until he could feel the force of its rotation as a fierce wind that attempted to blow him away, and the echo of haunted screams of pain that caused tears to prickle at the corners of his eyes as his imagination ran wild with what those desolate echoes could be.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, when it seemed that the storm would grow beyond both of their powers, Ambrose threw up both of his hands, the sound of his imperious, tenor voice a discordant pulse against the shrieking of the remnant energies of the foul magic. Before the older man's eyes, the sigils and runes de-materialized from Ambrose's arms and manifested as a wave of golden light that simultaneously swept throughout the breadth of the Manor grounds while also fountaining up in a spiral cage, capturing the shadowy energies and forcibly compressing it, battling each attempt of the black magic to run wild and forcing it to expend its remaining vitality as Ambrose gritted his teeth and forced his hands closer and closer together, until with a resounding clap of thunder, the remnants of the magic poisoning the Holly Vale winked out of existence, along with the cage that Ambrose had conjured.</p><p> </p><p><br/> As Ambrose lowered his hands, panting harshly from the exertion of manipulating such powerful energies without a wand or external foci aside from the conjured runes, Tellinore felt his body relax, a subtle weight of oppression and horror melting away from the sky around them and even the land. If possible, the still-depressing and bleak scenery <em>felt</em> less—heavy, aside from the emotional connection both magicians felt to those whose lives were ripped from them upon their own lands. His grief felt cleaner, less barbed and tainted.</p><p> </p><p>Ambrose for his part, took in a deep breath and released it, along with a tendril of his magic which touched the land of his ancestors and raced out to trace the length and breadth of the large property. A light touch, meant only to scan for any residual magic that didn't belong on the property. It took less than a minute to complete his scan and as his sense resounded with the echoes of <em>clean, clean, clean!</em>, the weight of anxiety that had pressed in on him since he stepped foot on the land he had been taken from fifteen years prior, vanished.</p><p> </p><p>A small smile formed across his face, one borne out of sheer relief.</p><p> </p><p>It was done.</p><p> </p><p>And now, the next task—of claiming what was rightfully his, of setting the wheels of justice in motion, not only for his immediate family's unjust murders and false justice, but for the centuries of disgrace and disrespect that had been paid to his ancestors descended from his Papa Menelaus' lineage, and the future prosperity of a nation on the brink of irreversible disaster—would begin.</p><p> </p><p>They would strike the first blow, and forge a storm such as never had been witnessed in magical Britain since the days of the Pendragons themselves.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
