    <p>Tom Riddle was always an intelligent boy. He knew what he was doing, and he planned several steps ahead. Nobody could ever see through him, except that fool of a teacher Dumbledore. When he finally came out of that stupid Diary fully...he was admittedly confused. He was in a room, a large spacious room, one that used to belong to Abraxsas if he was remembering correctly. When another man came in that...did look like Abraxsas, but not entirely, he stopped and stared.</p>
<p>"You are not Abraxsas Malfoy..." was the first words that Tom Riddle spoke.</p>
<p>"No, I am his son, Lucius Malfoy." Tom nodded thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Good enough." </p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>After gathering the information of the last fifty-five years that he was in the diary, he got himself a band of death eaters, descended from his original set, or at least, he did after he held Avery Jr. under the Cruciatus Curse for about five minutes for cutting him off and disrespecting him. But he needed younger followers, followers that would obey him without question, maybe not at first, but later on, he needed people who obey because they are loyal, not scared of him.</p>
<p>That is where Draco Malfoy came in. Tom had heard quite a bit about the sole Heir of the Malfoy name, and he had to admit, that he was somewhat impressed. Maybe Lucius's teaching methods were quite unorthodox, but in this instance, they served him well. The boy would be desperate for someone who would listen, someone he could call an actual friend. Unfortunately, the boy was currently at Hogwarts, for his fourth year, so he could do nothing about that, not until the summer came.</p>
<p>He also had to worry about Dumbledore, who was apparently, the Headmaster at Hogwarts now. He needed to get into Hogwarts. He had things to plan, and a school to in the end, take over. He loved Hogwarts, and would be it's ultimate ruler at some point. It was what he had planned in the beginning, before he realized who and what his father was, but hearing his ultimate downfall after having killed his father and his father's "Better Family", he decided smaller is better. Besides, it would start with Hogwarts, but he had to be patient, and go under the radar. He did need to get into Hogwarts under the cover of a Student first. And it would be incredibly difficult to sway Dumbledore. After all, he would likely know exactly what he looked like when he was sixteen, he would remember and recognize him. So he needed a different plan. An unassuming plan. And than it hit him. He would pose as the son of Tom Riddle AKA Lord Voldermort, instead of himself. If he was the Son of Tom Riddle, it would make sense for him to be in the same house as his ancestor, it would not be weird when he could speak with snakes, and it would not look odd that he was abnormally good with magic, as his supposed 'father' would have been to, and the looks, well, Genetics. Many people, like the Malfoys for instance, almost always looked like their father. He could claim that Avery Jr. was his 'paternal' father, and that he had no idea that Voldermort was his supposed 'father'. And it would make sense, considering that Tom would have to play a complete different ball game. He would have to act shy, scared, anxious, nervous, and yet, still pretend to be nice and compassionate or kind. It would be difficult, and of course, Avery Jr. would have to die, at least, temporally, which was why Poly-juice potion was currently being brewed. They would kill a muggle, right before hand, giving him the poly-juice potion, and once dead the affect would stay permanent. It was really quite clever. Of course, Tom would play the distressed, scared, tearful son, who suddenly finds out he was the son of a dark and evil sorcerer. </p>
<p>It was the perfect plan, and Tom Riddle was certain tha</p>
