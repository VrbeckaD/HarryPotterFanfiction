  <u>21st June 1996</u>
</p><p> </p><p>The news from the telly downstairs was blaring about ordinary things. No strange sightings, no odd occurrences, no unexplained deaths and disappearances. The Daily Prophet was the same… with the added bonus of daily jabs and jibes at Harry Potter, the lunatic attention seeker, same as last year.</p><p> </p><p>Still, those items were <em>news</em>. Harry’s own friends didn’t even have the courtesy of sending him as much news. Hermione had even refused to lend him her textbooks and notes for Ancient Runes and Arithmancy, claiming that she could teach him herself once they met.</p><p> </p><p>He hadn’t replied to that. After all, he needed the distraction <em>now</em>, not when they met, whenever it was. But now it left him with a conundrum: What should he do that would be both safe for him and also for others? Because, by anything and everything holy in the world, he wouldn’t be the cause of <em>yet another death</em>, except maybe for Voldemort.</p><p> </p><p>Or himself.</p><p> </p><p>It would be so easy. He could just slip into the Department of Mysteries under his Invisibility Cloak, go to the Chamber of Death, step over the Veil…</p><p> </p><p>He shook his head, and stared wanly at Hedwig, who was once more turning her back on him. “It’s not my fault, you know, girl,” he told her glumly, like dozens of times before. “You know Uncle Vernon would kill you if he knew you’re out.”</p><p> </p><p>She still didn’t react. She could very well be a statue.</p><p> </p><p>Or dead.</p><p> </p><p>`<em>NO!</em>` He shook his head more vigorously. `<em>She still digests her food. She isn’t dead.</em>` He’d never thought a pile of fresh droppings could reassure him about life… but it did.</p><p> </p><p>For now.</p><p> </p><p>He clenched his hands, and gritted his teeth for good measure.</p><p> </p><p>His bedroom – the smallest one in the house, and the shabbiest, especially this summer – didn’t help his mood, at all. It felt stifling, constricting, <em>confining</em>.</p><p> </p><p>He never forgot the bars Uncle Vernon had installed in the summer before his second year, that the man had installed again this year. He was still free to go in and out; but the sight of the seven sets of locks on his bedroom door, it never failed to remind him that this situation was a <em>privilege</em>. He could be locked in any time, once more, and let out just long enough to pen his empty reassurances to the Order.</p><p> </p><p>Was it so surprising, then, that he felt a jaunt into the Veil would be some holiday?</p><p> </p><p>His lips twisted up in the mockery of a smile that nobody could – <em>would</em> – see. He could imagine, very well, what Snape would say in the event of Harry Potter’s death; or, for that matter, what the man would say if he found out about the dirty, untidy state of the Boy-Who-Lived’s room.</p><p> </p><p>To think, death was so easy to achieve… Somehow, he missed the peace the numbness near death had caused him at the end of his first and second years. Being potentially soulless like at the end of his third year and before his fifth year was the opposite, though, and so was death by the hand of Voldemort like what nearly happened at the end of his fourth year.</p><p> </p><p>Huh. So many deaths. So many, so easy, so <em>frequent</em> happening at or around the so-called best school of magic in the world.</p><p> </p><p>He smiled again, mirthless and listless.</p><p> </p><p>Today was the sixth day that he was back with the Dursleys. How would he pass <em>two more months</em> with these thoughts circling round in his mind like birds of prey? He might just end things tomorrow to save himself more suffering.</p><p> </p><p>If only it wouldn’t make Voldemort positively <em>gleeful</em>…</p><p> </p><p>He <em>desperately</em> needed an anchor to life, or a distraction, or a goal beyond just <em>surviving</em>, if he didn’t want that high-pitched gleeful cackle to be the last thing that he knew before death.</p><p> </p><p>But whom could he contact, now, who would respond to him as <em>himself</em>, instead of the Boy-Who-Lived or some such? Events in his first, second and fourth years had shown him that most of the students and teachers at Hogwarts had only been there for his supposed image.</p><p> </p><p>He could try to contact Ron again, or even Ginny… But the last time he had contacted Ron, the other teen had confessed that he couldn’t talk much, because his mum had forbidden him to do so. Harry supposed talking with Ginny would end up with the same result, if even more awkward, since he barely knew her.</p><p> </p><p>Neville? Luna?</p><p> </p><p>Possible… But how to contact them?</p><p> </p><p>His eyes landed on Hedwig’s tail, still turned on him, and he exhaled an explosive sigh. “Wish I could let you go, Hedwig. Maybe you can just <em>go</em>, next time Uncle Vernon let you out of there? Got to admit, I’d rather you be here. I’d feel lonely, otherwise… and how glad I am that you can’t rat me and my fuzzy feelings to anyone!” He grinned, but the line of his lips soon fell flat again, as the addressed owl made no reaction. Huffing, he continued, “Need to send Nev and Luna a letter. I suppose I can wait till tomorrow, when Uncle Vernon let you go for that note to the Order… but really, Hed, it’s already too much <em>now</em>. I’d rather not wait till tomorrow, if I really want to outlive Vold–… Well, <em>riddle</em>. I think I’ll just call him that. It’s his real name, after all, maybe safer too.” He stroked her side through the cage bars.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t turn round, not even to nip harshly at his finger, for daring to touch her.</p><p> </p><p>It had been like that, since the day before yesterday, after she’d been caged again when she’s back from delivering the first note to the Order.</p><p> </p><p>He couldn’t fault her. Birds were never to be caged. He’d only ever meant Hedwig’s cage as some kind of transport for her when needed, and a patch of home and comfort for her during the summers. The door was never supposed to be locked. – But she didn’t understand that, maybe she <em>couldn’t</em>, and it weighed all the heavier in his heart.</p><p> </p><p>He waded against the dirty clothes and strewn magic books on the floor, pulled up his ricketty chair, and plopped himself into it, eliciting a loud protest from the worn wooden construct. He spent an inordinate amount of time just staring at the rolls of blank parchment piled haphazardly on the desk before him, his only effort to prepare for his summer assignments, that had never been followed up by the writing of the summer assignments themselves. Now the parchment would serve a different role; but now that he was about to begin, the thought of penning a letter to Neville and Luna felt as exhaustingly heavy as trying to work on the meaningless assignments for his sixth year.</p><p> </p><p>What use would schooling be, when the magical community was on the brink of <em>yet another</em> war, when it could so easily spill into the non-magical world?</p><p> </p><p>And now, what could Neville and Luna do for him, while they had their own lives to lead, while they were still counted as children, like his own self? Neville had taken Ancient Runes under his gran’s insistance, so he could borrow the textbooks and notes for that subject from the other teen… Except, wouldn’t it remind Neville that he’d failed <em>yet again</em> in his gran’s eyes? When even the Boy-Who-Lived wanted to study the subject without being forced to do so?</p><p> </p><p>And Luna… She must be away with her dad, studying something or another of those magical creatures that she was always talking about, exploring various parts of the world in their elusive-but-fun hunts…</p><p> </p><p>`<em>Worth considering,</em>` a part of his mind whispered to him, as he took his specs off and laid his forehead on the semi-cool, rugged surface of the ricketty desk. In his mind’s eye, images of various natural scenes from his primary-school books and the telly paraded like a litany of spellwork.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t want to end up like Sirius, imprisoned in his own – <em>hated</em> – home after escaping from Azkaban, after tasting freedom – if on the run – for just a couple of months or three.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t want <em>death</em> to be his only escape, his only way to achieve peace, like it had ended up being for sirius.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore wouldn’t approve… But Dumbledore had kept many, many things from him, with the prophecy being the latest and the most destructive.</p><p> </p><p>And Dumbledore had been the one who’d placed him in this hell, the one who had <em>kept him here</em> despite his pleas, despite all reasons, despite all facts.</p><p> </p><p><em>And</em> Dumbledore did <em>know</em> what had been going on in this household. The old man had confessed so himself, in short, vague terms coached in nonchalant words that hurt all the more.</p><p> </p><p>The least said about the Ministry of Magic, the better.</p><p> </p><p>That went for the Order of the Phoenix, as well.</p><p> </p><p>If he changed his look, changed his name, refrained from doing active magic, blended in with the Muggles…</p><p> </p><p>Ah, he needed <em>supplies</em>; supplies and money and a disguise and a way to escape and a list of where he would like to go first, and maybe a fall-back place for when he’s in a tight spot.</p><p> </p><p>Dobby’s presence here hadn’t been detected, those four years ago…</p><p> </p><p>“Dobby?”</p><p> </p><p>A soft popping sound was the only announcement of his success. Just <em>a split second</em> after he had called…</p><p> </p><p>He shifted round, to face the empty spot where he’d heard the popping sound. “Dobby? Did you… anticipate I was going to need you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, the Great Harry Potter, sir,” came the answer from thin air, in a timid whisper that was nonetheless still high-pitched.</p><p> </p><p>Blessed with a partner for conversation, Harry’s smile this time was less bitter, more genuine. “You can show yourself, you know,” he told the house-elf. “But please keep your voice down. I don’t want my relatives or anybody else to know you’re here.” Then, frowning slightly, he added, “Can’t you just call me <em>Harry</em>? I’m not great or anything, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>He launched himself at the small creature, who had just gone visible, before Dobby could more than utter a short cry, like that fateful day before his second year. “Ssh!” he hissed, with his hand glued to Dobby’s lips. “What did I tell you about keeping your voice down?” Then, when the spindly little creature tried to wrench away, he exasperatedly added, “And no punishment, okay? It creates so much noise, and it serves nobody. I… Well, I don’t like it, too.”</p><p> </p><p>He let go of Dobby, then, who looked down dejectedly with ears drooping.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Master Harry, sir,” the house-elf whispered in a tiny voice, as his tears plopped silently onto Harry’s dirty laundry.</p><p> </p><p>The teen could only sigh, to that. “Well, at least it’s shorter, this time,” he muttered, while making a place for him to sit on the floor facing the house-elf. “Now, Dobby, how are you? – No, <em>don’t</em>. What did I tell you about attracting attention?”</p><p> </p><p>The house-elf, who seemed about to bawl again, subsided with a loud sniffle. Wringing his bony hands together, he addressed the garment-strewn floor before him, “Dobby be fine enough, Master Harry. Much to do in the castle, though less than when students be there. Other house-elves still don’t like Dobby much, because Dobby be paid and has clothes.” He wrung his hands tighter, before confessing, “Dobby misses Master Harry, sir. He be so eager when Master Harry sir needed him. He waited for Master Harry’s call and be here soon as he could.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry scratched at his hair, feeling awkward and touched. “Erm, Dobby? You could always just visit, you know. I think I told you that, no? As long as you’re not seen by anyone but those that I consider safe, it’s all right.” He beamed at the house-elf, then reached out a hand to squeezed one tiny, bony shoulder. “Now, why don’t you sit down? We can talk.”</p><p> </p><p>Dobby sniffled again, visibly restraining himself from crying out with probable exultation from being invited to sit on the floor, then unceremoniously plopped himself down where he’d stood. His ears flopped a little when he did that… Harry couldn’t help giggle a little, and grinned when Dobby looked up at him.</p><p> </p><p>Both the grin and the feeling of levity vanished instantly, though, when Dobby told him in response to his earlier remark, “P’fessor Dumbledore said not to visit Master Harry, sir, when he be with his Muggles. But Master Harry called for Dobby, and P’fessor Dumbledore don’t never say about calling, so Dobby comes.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Dumbledore</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Dobby was his last ticket to sanity and life, and <em>Dumbledore</em> had nearly sent him beyond, with that inhibition.</p><p> </p><p>Bitterness filled him, along with a growing sense of constriction, of helplessness. He balled his fists on his lap, but it didn’t seem nearly <em>enough</em>.</p><p> </p><p>What was the use of shunting him aside like this? Didn’t he have a position in this war? People had always said so, and Riddle had affirmed it year by year with undeniable action. What was the reason for him to be cut out from everything <em>and everyone</em>? Dobby had done so before his second year, but it had only been in order to <em>save</em> him, as twisted as his attempts had turned out; and the house-elf had <em>stopped</em> when Harry had asked.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore hadn’t. Last year, it had all been the same.</p><p> </p><p>What did Dumbledore want from him? Why did Dumbledore <em>always</em> do this?</p><p> </p><p>Regardless, this just proved that Harry <em>couldn’t</em> trust the old man, couldn’t ask for <em>anything</em> from the old man, because Dumbledore did whatever he wanted to do, and listened to nobody.</p><p> </p><p>But Dumbledore’s eyes and eares were <em>everywhere</em>… The Daily Prophet had reported his return to his former positions two days ago…</p><p> </p><p>Well, Harry could <em>maybe</em> cut out one of the pairs of eyes-and-ears from his employ…</p><p> </p><p>“Dobby? Would you like to work for me?”</p><p> </p><p>Damn Hermione’s wishes for elfish wellfare. This was the only way Harry could get out of this place intact and unpursued. Besides, he could provide for Dobby and a few others with the money in his Gringotts account, so their wellfare would always be secured.</p><p> </p><p>He was about to offer a pay raise, in fact, when Dobby burst into heavy but noiseless tears and—</p><p> </p><p>“Whoa. Whoa. Buddy. I don’t like people prostrating themselves at me,” he murmured, as he caught Dobby before the elf could do just that to him. “Too much like Riddle, you know. – So, can I take it that you’d like to work for me? You can take a rest any time, you can have a Galleon a week, you can have good clothes all you want, you can take a holiday…”</p><p> </p><p>`<em>As long as you’re my friend,</em>` went unsaid. But even so, his shoulder was already bathed by Dobby’s tears and snot.</p><p> </p><p>And then, just so, warmth suffused him. It started from his chest and branched quickly to the farthest tips of his hairstrands, fingers and toes.</p><p> </p><p>Dobby whispered something in his ear. Harry couldn’t catch the words. And still, he felt an indelible affirmation deep in his being.</p><p> </p><p>Dobby had received his offer, and not in the mundane sense of employer and employee.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure, Dobby? You loved your freedom so much,” he whispered, as the house-elf began to fidget in his arms.</p><p> </p><p>The pair released each other, but Dobby didn’t move far. With all seriousness, the little creature then looked right into the teen’s eyes, for once acting truly like they were equals, but even more vulnerable for that. “Master Harry going to take back the offers?” he asked, his voice tiny and wavering.</p><p> </p><p>`<em>Offers,</em>` Harry mused, baffled and stunned and strangely elated. `<em>Rest, pay, clothes, holiday…</em>` “No, of course not. You could even ask Winky to join us, if she wants, if she hasn’t gotten a family to be with, and I’ll offer her the same. You deserve freedom, same like humans. We’re all <em>people</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Dobby popped out right away. But the radiant look he threw the teen before he vanished was answer enough.</p>
