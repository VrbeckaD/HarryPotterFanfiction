    <p>Hermione stepped out of the airport lobby. Her heels clicked on the linoleum floor as she basked in the California sun. She took a minute to revel in it, pushing her sunglasses up her face to rest against her hair. </p><p> </p><p><em>This was the beginning of her new life</em>. </p><p> </p><p>She had left her past in rural Iowa to chase her dream of being a dancer. There was nothing for her amidst the corn anyway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few weeks passed, and she got herself settled into a small, one bedroom apartment with the tiny amount of savings she had left. She needed to find a job - and fast. </p><p> </p><p>She followed lead after lead, and ad after ad, for <em>Dancers Wanted</em>, but everything had already been filled, or they wanted more professional experience than she had to offer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then one night, she walked down the Sunset Strip and stumbled across a lingerie-costumed girl standing on the balcony of a building. A door opened as Hermione and the girl shared a smile. Next a middle aged man appeared, his long, black hair tied into a bun on his head. He ushered the girl inside. The damage was done; Hermione wanted to see more. </p><p> </p><p>What she found was unlike anything she had ever seen. She saw a poster with a beautiful brunette in a white fur stole. The woman wore bright purple lips, which she was biting seductively. Beside her photo was a list of names:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>Pansy</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Daphne </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Ginny </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Millicent</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Cho</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Luna</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione hesitated for a moment, staring at the beautiful woman. </p><p> </p><p>“We might not have any windows, but we have the best view on the Sunset Strip…” a serpentine voice called to her. </p><p> </p><p>She turned to him curiously. </p><p> </p><p>“Twenty bucks.” </p><p> </p><p>She dug in her pocket for her wallet and handed him her last twenty dollar bill. He smiled, listless. </p><p> </p><p>“Enjoy.” </p><p> </p>
