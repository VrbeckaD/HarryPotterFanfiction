    <p>His current problem, like most of his recent problems, stems from his inability to stop snooping about the underworld. Hades had told him to stop. Midas had told him to stop. Hell, that time he ventured into the Egyptian side (things were sparkly and weird), Anubis told him to stop. You’d think he’d have learned, what with falling straight into Tartarus that one time (shivers run up his spine if he gets too close, sometimes he wakes up screaming), but no. When his father kicks him out of the throne room, he does not go straight to his room without passing go or collecting $200. He instead meanders down the hazy dirt path that had not been there a few hours ago, or even a few minutes ago, he thinks. </p>
<p>The path itself is hard to focus on, doubly so it’s surroundings, but he pushes on, making sure to put one foot directly in front of the other (left-right-left-right). He’s a little lost, but he figures he can turn tail and walk back the way he came if he wants. If nothing else, he can always shadow travel away. Truthfully, this part of the underworld was so shrouded in shapeless, formless mist that he wasn’t sure if he was even in the underworld anymore. He walks, shuffles really, down the dark path that lacks any twists or turns or borders or ends. It’s a little like floating, Nico thinks. The fog cuts around him in smooth, unpredictable patterns, though no wind blew past to shape them.  </p>
<p>What seems like an endless hike pays off when a torch cuts through the enveloping mist, and as he approaches it, another. The light cast flickers over the form of an uneven rock path, which solidifies under his feet as he notices stone walls around him. Had those always been there? Maybe. Nevertheless, he pushes deeper into the stone hallway. Now that there is around him, his curiosity is piqued once again. </p>
<p>The walls around him open into a large cavernous room, lined with bookshelves and tabletops adorned with all sorts of trinkets and oddities. He peers around the room, shuffling closer to the center as a form solidifies near the wall. Nico pays it no mind, sees no reason to, until it’s completely shaped. Then, with a sense that he’s being snapped back into awareness from a trance he hadn’t known he’d been in, he jumps back from what is an elegant woman sitting in an equally elegant velvet chair. </p>
<p>She sets off Nico’s internal alarms like nothing else. She’s lounging, ruby red lips pursed in an unamused shape, and bony fingers tap long nails against a wine glass. Nico moves to step backwards, but the entrance to the room seems to have disappeared. He can’t see it. He can’t get out. He can’t- He-</p>
<p>“None of that, child.” She swirls the dark red wine and takes a sip, “Come closer.” </p>
<p>With a start he stumbles closer and onto his knees in what is a hasty and probably ugly kneel. The dirt digs into his knees where his jeans have long rips, and it’s uncomfortable, but he doesn’t dare to rise. </p>
<p>“Lady.” He greets, and hopes it’s enough not to piss her off. He doesn’t recognize this goddess, but he may be able to play it like he does. </p>
<p>Much to his surprise, she scoffs an introduction, “Hecate.” </p>
<p>There’s a tense silence as Nico’s head runs through a variety of swears, each passing second rising more alarm in the young demigod. She wouldn’t smite him, would she? Being a son of Hades afforded him certain privileges, like the weight of his father's potential reaction to his potential smiting. Even if she doesn’t, there are other ways a god can make a demigods life hell, and he did not want to owe Hecate a favor, not with her reputation as being bitter and ruthless. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” He begins to apologize, but is cut off when Hecate sighs and shakes her head. A rodent of some sort scampers up to him, sticking its wet nose against Nico’s face as he recoils back. It sniffs him twice, farts twice, and scurries away into the hazy corners of the room where the mist swirled in thick, smoky columns. </p>
<p>“I am not surprised you do not know who I am. Nor am I angry.” She takes a long drink from her glass, and continues, “Disappointed, perhaps, that you intrude upon my space without the proper knowledge.” </p>
<p>Her nails, long and painted immaculately black, tap against the glass cup, each ting-ting echoing through the space between them. </p>
<p>“I did not mean to intrude, Lady Hecate. I can leave, if you’d like.” He propositions, though what he wanted to say was ‘if you’d let me’. Really, he loathed to be like this: on his knees, spitting respect through his teeth to gods he can’t quite call benevolent (apathetic and callous at best). It leaves him feeling ripped raw, and simmering in anger. </p>
<p>“You may stay or go as you wish.” She replies. “And do not feel the need to remain kneeling. I do not care for such frivolities.” </p>
<p>He scrambles to his feet, hastily brushing dirt off his knees as he goes. Confusion reigns through him. She was not only letting him go, but letting him choose. He stares up at her, questions on his lips, but Hecate seems to have conjured a book, and she pays him no mind. Se remains just as disinterested as he strides to the archway that had reappeared. He pauses, once, to look back, but Hecate did not seem to notice or care that he did. She merely flipped the page on her book and took another swing of wine. Pale neck bobbing as she swallows. She does not look up, even to thread her fingers through the fur of a dog laying at her feet. With that, he takes three steps outside the doorway and catapults himself through the shadows.</p>
