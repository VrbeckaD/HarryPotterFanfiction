    <p>
  <span>Sometimes Sirius Black throbs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>(Because he is 15 and young.) (Too young to be the throbbing like this)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He does not want to go back to Hogwarts and smile and laugh and flirt and fight and be everything everyone has always wanted to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wants to hurt and ache and throb and he wants to </span>
  <em>
    <span>sit in it,</span>
  </em>
  <span> because the terrible, sad, twisted part of him thinks it feels good. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t want to stay at home either. He does not want his mother’s screaming and his father's anger and he doesn’t want Regulus’s disappointed gaze. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wants to get out. </span>
  <em>
    <span>He needs to.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He needs to because in that fucking house he hurts more than usual and if he stays there his parents will kill him or the other way around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He is so, so miserable, and all that misery, stuck inside him, coiling, searing, </span>
  <em>
    <span>hurts</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>God, he’s miserable and so fucking angry. (He screams at his parents and breaks family heirlooms and sends angry letters to James just because he knows his mother will intercept it. He sneaks out and comes home loud and angry and drunk just to piss off his parents and spits in his mother's face when she slaps him.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tells her that he is not scared until his throat hurts and so does the rest of him. (He is. Has been since he was 11 years old, but he would die before he would tell her that.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A week before his 5th year at Hogwarts his mother roughs him around a little more than he would like, so he grabs his trunk, gets aboard the night bus, and spends the week before school in a dingy room in the Leaky Cauldron. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It is the best week of his life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He eats when he wants to and explores London and meets a muggle boy at a nightclub who tastes like weed and chapstick and </span>
  <em>
    <span>life. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>(The boy asks for his number and Sirius has to explain that he doesn’t have one because his parents are recluse freaks and he goes to a fancy boarding school that doesn’t let students use the phone. He does give him a P.O. box in Hogsmeade though, so he can write Sirius. The boy seems very unhappy with that, but he still promises that he will.) </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius sits in his room and listens to the train roar and feels the bed shake beneath him and finally everything doesn’t ache so much anymore. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stays up late and draws all in his school books that used to be Belatrix’s. He buys packs and packs of muggle cigarettes because the ministry tracks who buys the wizard ones as to keep underage smoking to a minimum and smokes until all he can think of is the good things. (Remus and James and Peter and Regulus and Lily and charms class and McGonagall.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smokes so he doesn’t throb and then some extra because he likes it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He meets James at the platform, who tells him he smells like cigarettes and dust.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius only smiles. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He likes being the dangerous one. The loose cannon, the loud one, the one that is bound to crash and burn at some point in time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He says hello to Lily (who still thinks he’s a prat) and Marlene (who Sirius knows has been wanting to shag him since last year) and sits next to Moony on the train. He eats too much sugar and eats even more at the feast, hexes Snape, watches Regulus from the corner of his eye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tilts back in his chair and plans a prank with James. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He throbs again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(His mother's voice wails in his head and so does James and Remus’s. His own does too, and he sounds so desperate Sirius wants to remove it with something sharp.) (He opts for cigarettes instead.) </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smokes and he smokes and he smokes and he still throbs and the worst part about it is that no one even notices. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t want people to, but still. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius is all off, and James knows it. Remus knows it. Peter, even Marlene McKinnon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius is brash laughter and sharp wit and eyes like steel. He is hexes and firewhiskey, ink smudged hands and bruises. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He is everything that James is. A touch more melodramatic. (A touch more dangerous.) </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius smokes and smokes and smokes until James can hear it in his voice and until he has to stop him from going for another two after the first has burnt down. Sirius let’s the cigarettes burn down to his fingers, and doesn’t even flinch when his skin begins to smoke, too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius has fought with his brother too often and goes to hogsmeade and returns with letters and brushes James off and is a little rougher around the edges. He doesn’t cry as much and doesn’t bother trying in McGonagall’s class.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James doesn’t know what is wrong with Sirius anymore. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>(It used to be that Moony didn’t like him back or that he was in Gryffindor or that Marlene McKinnon didn’t get the fucking idea that he wasn’t interested.) </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t know what is wrong with Sirius anymore, so he sits with him while he smokes and let’s him copy down James’s notes and stops complaining about Evans so much. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>(Somewhere, James is terrified that he is losing his best mate. Or that his best mate is months away from throwing himself off the astronomy tower or that his best mate has finally joined the dark side after all.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He still sits with Sirius so he doesn’t sit with himself so much and he still makes Sirius help plan what to do to Snape next. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck. I think I’ve gone properly numb.” Sirius days once, drunk off of firewhiskey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James doesn’t respond. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just sits with him while he smokes and steadies his hands when they start to shake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He might not know what is wrong with Sirius anymore, but that doesn’t really mean anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James will still sit with him, no matter what.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have to stop smoking, Padfoot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So fucking what, Moony. Not like you actually give a shit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius tries to find his star. His constellation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s up with you lately, mate?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I dunno, Sirius. You’re all off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah? Is that right? Might want to be more specific there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You smoke too much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mmhm. And?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius eyes are steel and mercury and silver and the moon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been writing this Muggle recently, Moony.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah? That’s why you’re off so much recently?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He really fucking good looking, mate. I met him at this club. My parents are going to kill me when they find out.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius takes a drag of his cigarette and then drops it out the window. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope they don’t for my sake and James’s. Reckon he’d go mad if he found you murdered by your parents.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus itches. The full moon is coming up. It happens sometimes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My parents are fucking assholes. I think I want to move in with James.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus smiles. A little artificially.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think he’d like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could move in with you, Moony. That’d be pretty good too. You could show me Muggle things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus smiles. He tries to imagine Sirius and some boy dancing together, fit together like a puzzle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I’d like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah? Me too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe so, then Padfoot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. Maybe so.”</span>
