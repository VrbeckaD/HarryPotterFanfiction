  <b>Shadows Within the Light</b>
</p><p>Harry had spent the two weeks after the Third Task mostly in a healing, dreamless sleep. He remembered snippets of Remus and Sirius changing his bandages, helping him drink potions, and helping him bathe, but, thankfully, he was too numb and exhausted - not to mention in pain- to really take notice of everything happening around him. His whole world had narrowed to his broken body's needs and demands.</p><p>But for the last two days, awareness had flirted with his consciousness. He was managing to stay awake and actually converse with Remus and Sirius. He even talked Omi into fetching him newspapers and had been shocked further awake at the news printed there. The wizarding world was rabid with panic; torn practically in half between believers of Voldemort's return and those that believed it was just a vicious rumor.</p><p>Harry didn't know which category he was in. He had no recollections of the night in the graveyard just a vague sense of icy terror. He tried asking Remus and Sirius, but they only offered him reassurances of his safety and insisted it was best he not think of anything right now but his recovery. It was maddening.</p><p>And then Severus had arrived on his third day of coherency. </p><p>

</p><p>Severus stepped into his house. Immediately the weight of the problems he carried slid from his shoulders. He took a deep breath, closing his eyes and allowing the muscles in his shoulders and neck to loosen. Taking off his outer robe, he called for Omi. The little elf took it solemnly, following as Severus made his way slowly upstairs. His leg still bothered him and gave him a small limp.</p><p>He went left, walked down the hall, and stopped at Harry's open door. Remus was sitting in a chair pulled up to the teen's bedside, reading a thick book on medi-wizardry. The mutt was in his human form and snoring softly in a cot pushed against the wall. The curtains on the windows were pulled half-closed, softening the harsh summer sun.</p><p>Still without speaking, he stepped into the room and stopped at the foot of the bed. Lupin looked up at him, but he didn't say anything. Severus appreciated that and just took in his charge. Harry's face was thin and relaxed with sleep. His hair was messy from being in bed so much and the teen's exposed chest was covered with bandages. Some areas were even stained red with fresh blood. No doubt his legs were in the same condition.</p><p>"He's doing better," Lupin offered. "He's not in as much pain. He’s awake almost all day now. In fact, he should wake up from his nap any moment."</p><p>"How much is permanent?" He asked it so softly he feared Lupin wouldn't hear him.</p><p>"Very little. Maybe none.” The werewolf smiled. "Really, there was hardly any internal damage and all the surface injuries are responding slowly to treatment."</p><p>Severus nodded. He couldn't say anything else as startling green eyes blinked open. They had changed. They were brighter, more vivid, and almost inhuman. Lupin rose without being asked and got the mutt up and out of the room with surprisingly little fuss. Severus waited until the door closed behind them before taking the seat the werewolf had abandoned. Harry watched him, his expression tense, but he managed a smile for his mentor.</p><p>"How are you?" Severus asked carefully.</p><p>Harry ducked his head, his long bangs hiding his unsettling eyes as his hands twisted in the blankets at his lap. "I'm doing better. I even walked around for a bit today."</p><p>"I'm pleased to hear it." He waited, wondering how Harry wanted this exchange to go.</p><p>"I've been stealing the <em>Daily Prophet</em>," the teen admitted in a soft, steady voice. "Remus and Sirius order it. They read it down stairs, thinking I don't know. Remus worries the news will upset me and make me ill, so I get Omi to bring it to me when they leave me alone in the bath."</p><p>"It's understandable that you want to know what's going on," Severus allowed, keeping his face and voice neutral.</p><p>"I'm glad you think that because I want to know the truth about what happened that night." Harry lifted his head, staring at Severus with a silent demand for answers.</p><p>"What's the last thing you remember?"</p><p>"Cedric activated the Cup. It took us to a dark graveyard. I hid because someone was coming." He looked away, toward the window. "I started to use my ring when…" He shrugged and looked back at his teacher. "I don't remember anything else, but…"</p><p>"But what, Harry?"</p><p>"When I try to remember that night or when I think about it too hard, I get cold and scared. I <em>know </em>I don't want to remember." Harry met his mentor's dark eyes. "But I <em>have </em>to know. I'm in danger, and I don't know what I'm up against."</p><p>Severus nodded and leaned back in the chair. He had expected this and had already made his decision. "I will tell you what I know."</p><p>Harry listened, staring at his teacher as if nothing else in the world mattered. </p><p>Severus started at the beginning. Harry’s hands clenched into tight fists as he described the duel with Dumbledore. He hissed furiously as Severus recounted how his leg was injured. Severus had been staring at the wall, lost in his recollections, but at the sound he tipped his head down and stared intensely at the teen.</p><p>"What?" Harry scowled, startled by the look and not understanding why he was getting it. "Why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p>"Draco Malfoy chose that moment to arrive on the scene," Severus said evenly. He watched Harry's eyes get wider, but there was very little reaction as he described the headmaster's death. Now it was his turn to scowl. "Well? Explain yourself."</p><p>"What is there to explain?" Harry shook his head. "You know why I did it. I couldn't remain defenseless against him."</p><p>"You should have come to me," he said, voice deep and his eyes dark.</p><p>"I did. You were doing your best, but it wasn't enough for my peace of mind. I'm not sorry I did it, Severus. He was going to kill you!" Harry closed his eyes tight and took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm. When he opened them again, there was finally the sadness to his eyes that Severus wanted to see. "I <em>am </em>sorry that Draco had to do it, though. I never expected him to be the one to trigger the poison."</p><p>Severus knew that was as much regret as he was going to get from the boy and let it go for now. To be honest, he understood Harry's position. The power Dumbledore had over him had been great, should the headmaster choose to use it. As he had chosen the night Harry was taken to the graveyard, refusing Harry the help he needed. Severus, himself, had been trying to kill the headmaster while they dueled. He couldn't exactly reprimand Harry for making the same choice.</p><p>"I want to know how you became such close friends with Draco." Severus eyed the teen. Harry offered an innocent smile and he snorted. “But, first, I will continue my story."</p><p>"Please do," Harry agreed.</p><p>Severus didn't look back at the wall. He needed to see Harry's expression as he detailed the condition Boy was in and the following actions of Demon. Harry stared at him, eyes wide. His mouth parted with surprise when he heard how Demon actually spoke. He was less surprised that he had killed the Dark Lord. When it was over, he closed his eyes and Severus could only see pain on his face.</p><p>"Thank you for telling me the truth," Harry whispered.</p><p>"I will not lie to you," Severus promised. "I may, at times, withhold information, but I will never lie."</p><p>Harry nodded. "I understand that. I don't like it - I want you to be able to tell me everything all the time - but I understand."</p><p>"I will keep you informed as often as I can.” Severus reached out and covered Harry's hand with his own. He was fiercely proud when Harry didn't flinch away. "I am telling you everything now."</p><p>"What happened after Demon went back In? And why did he do that? Why not stay Out on a rampage?" Harry questioned, tilting his head curiously.</p><p>"I wondered that myself." Severus hooked his hair behind his ear and leaned back, crossing his legs thoughtfully. "I spoke to Salazar and we theorize that because Demon was born from Voldemort he felt the Dark Lord's death. The shock of it rendered him unconscious, so to speak."</p><p>"And why was he talking? He wasn't that coherent the last time I checked," Harry fretted, biting his lower lip.</p><p>"Demon's mind grows and becomes more complex the more he is fed. For a long time, you fed him all your hate and rage from the treatment you received from the Dursleys and from the aggravation you felt your first years at Hogwarts, not to mention the rage Lockhart inspired by assaulting you. Salazar speculates the Dark Lord also fed Demon. The alter stood between you, so to speak, connecting you. As the Dark Lord got stronger and closer to a body, the more he unknowingly fed Demon, making the alter stronger and more aware."</p><p>"So now Demon is capable of thought."</p><p>Harry shivered as the implications of that trickled into his thoughts. He liked the idea of being able to protect himself, should it come to the worst case scenario. Demon had saved him a couple times, after all, but he hated feeling like he couldn't control himself. Unlike with Boy, Demon was a serious threat to everyone around him. Demon wouldn't hesitate to hurt any of the people Harry cared about.</p><p>"We will find a way to guard against him," Severus promised. He knew exactly what Harry feared. In all honesty, he feared it as well. "We do have the Animagus trigger on him, but we will find a way to better secure his door."</p><p>“Thanks." Harry forced his shoulders to relax. Tensing up like that pulled on his injures and it hurt like the blazes. "So… You were going to tell me what happened after Voldemort was dusted?"</p><p>“Hmmm," Severus sneered at the teen's wording and Harry laughed. "Fine," the man relented, pleased beyond measure that Harry could still laugh. </p><p>They talked for a long time. Only stopping when Remus and Sirius came up to eat dinner with them. Severus watched Harry eat and talk with the others and he felt himself uncoil a bit. He had feared Harry's mind would be more damaged from everything that happened - feared Boy or Demon would bleed through his dominate personality - and was greatly relieved to find it was not so. </p><p>Harry was still only Shadow. His mind was still and intact. This had effected him, yes. You could the physical evidence of this in his eyes, which were changed from channeling so much Dark magic, but otherwise he had come from the horrific experienced relatively whole. He felt fierce relief that he hadn't lost the child he had come to love.</p><p>
  <b>xXxXxXx</b>
</p><p>Harry didn't know what to expect from his mentor, but answers to all his questions hadn’t been it. He was grateful and humbled by the man's trust in him and in his strength, but he was also grimly anxious about all he had learned. He retreated into himself, freeing his mind from his still severely injured body to think about everything Severus had revealed to him.</p><p>Dumbledore was dead and could no longer threaten him. Relief was his immediate response as well as pleasant surprise that Draco had found the strength to activate the poison they had created together. He was so damn thankful that the blond had gotten there in time to save Severus. However, the headmaster's death left a huge hole behind. He knew there was going to be some heavy-duty pushing and shoving as those in power tried to elbow into positions of authority over the most influential school this side of Europe. And that left openings for corruption.</p><p>Voldemort was dead, yes, but the majority of his followers weren’t, and they were a problem. Word had to have spread in those circles of Voldemort's demise. Some would want to take his place, some would be after Harry for revenge or just because he was a potential threat to them. Especially since they tortured him. They would fear retribution.</p><p>And they should. Harry felt a burning hate for those bastards who had left him so bloody broken. He couldn't sit up on his own! And Severus's descriptions, brief though they were, of his body before Boy and Demon could heal most of the damage… He felt angry, sick, and frightened. Not a nice combination. Mostly, he just wanted to know none of them would <em>ever </em>be able to hurt him again.</p><p>Then there was the fact that the Wizarding world thought he was either dead or kidnapped. The minute he showed himself they would make demands. Interviews, stalkers, attackers, beggars, worshipers… No matter which category, the whole of the Wizarding world would be watching him, wanting something from him. It was intolerable. He was willing to defend himself from Voldemort and he was willing to do what he could to protect those around him, but he was <em>not </em>going to be their sacrifice, martyr, or soldier. He belong to no one but himself.</p><p>And then there were the more private problems of Demon and Boy, his last two alters. He was aware they were both changed by the events in the graveyard; he could see it when he Occluded and explored his own mind:</p><p>The ocean representing his mind had swallowed him as he had sunk deep. Slowly all light had disappeared, the fish and sea-vegetation disappeared and still no doors. It had felt like he was sinking into a bottomless hole in the middle of his ocean floor. Suddenly struck with a deep fear, he had flailed for the surface toward the light. His alters were too deep now, too wild. He had no access to them, no control… It was a <em>very </em>unpleasant realization.</p><p>Chewing over all these problems - trying to predict what they meant for the future and weigh all the potential ramifications to himself - Harry settled deep within his Occlumency shields to think. As he did so, he worked to camouflage the deep hole in his mind and set mental boobytraps for anyone who might break in his mind and go looking where they shouldn't. The barriers might even help keep Demon and Boy from rising up out of the darkness. </p><p>
  <b>xXxXxXx</b>
</p><p>Harry opened his eyes and blinked against the bright, late morning sun filling the room. For a wonder, he was alone; the chair residing beside his bed was empty. He sighed in pleasure and just enjoyed the solitude while it lasted. </p><p>His bed was just as it always was: the thick down comforter fluffy and warm, the dark blue color complementing the spotless thick black carpet. The light cream-colored walls contrasted with the dark floor, making the room seem bigger. The heavy drapes over the window were even lighter, making them glow with the sunlight they gently held back. The walls were bare but for a single mahogany frame holding a silver ring behind its sparkling glass; the mate of the one he still wore on his right middle finger. He also still wore his silver bracelet, which remained on his left wrist.</p><p>Returning his attention to his room, Harry noticed the closet door was cracked open. There was just enough light to see his clothes, school trunk, and the shelves at the back that held his books and photo albums. He smiled, the dull pain constantly thrumming through his body forgotten completely as a wave of happiness washed through him. It would never cease to amaze him that he had a place to call his own, a home at last. This would be his third summer in this house.</p><p>The bedroom door opened and Remus and Sirius came in. Harry turned to them and smiled. The two men froze and then Sirius was running over, exclaiming and scolding at the same time. Remus followed more slowly, but his smile spoke volumes. Harry laughed softly, careful not to jar his ribs as Sirius turned into a dog so he could run in a circle, yapping happily.</p><p>"You act like I've been out of it for years. It couldn't have been more than a few days.” He shook his head.</p><p>"Three actually," Remus answered. "But you know what he's like."</p><p>Harry grinned. "Yeah; a toddler.”</p><p>Sirius morphed back into his human form and pouted. "I am not!"</p><p>Remus burst into loud laughter and Harry snickered.</p><p>"I see you are awake," Severus spoke, coming into the room. He was still limping and Harry suspected that it was a permanent injury. The thought made him instantly angry.</p><p>"Will it never heal?" he asked softly, needing to know. Remus and Sirius stood still, waiting for Severus's answer, aware of their charge's seriousness.</p><p>Severus inclined his head. "It may.”</p><p>"But you doubt it," Harry said grimly, hands tight on his blankets.</p><p>"I do," he allowed and stepped closer to the bed. "However, I would not change my actions."</p><p>"I know." Harry was grateful for the man's support, but it still upset him.</p><p>"I wanted to ask you if you had made any decisions concerning your current position.” Severus smoothly changed the subject.</p><p>Harry lifted his head, his thick hair falling into his unsettling, pale green eyes. His glasses were an asset in this; muting most of the effect of the new altered color. He looked much older than his few years with the serious, knowing cast to his face. He had seen things no one should and still he had survived. It made Severus feel fiercely proud as well as fiercely determined to shield the child from further horror and damage.</p><p>"I have actually," Harry admitted. "If I return to the Wizarding world, I will be a target. From people who want me to protect them, from people who see me as a threat, from the remaining Death Eaters. I'll be torn apart. I won't put myself in that position. I'm thinking of leaving the country or just staying at the house for a while. It's not like I can't learn on my own and I'm ahead of my peers in Hogwarts, anyway."</p><p>"I suspected you would feel that way." Severus folded his hands before him, keeping them low. His expression was carefully blank. Harry knew his mentor well enough to listen carefully. Whatever his teacher was about to say was very important. "I will follow you, whatever you decide, but I wanted you to be aware there is a third option in addition to relocating and hiding."</p><p>Sirius's eyes widened. He knew where this was going. He went rigid next to his friend and had he not been so full of grief and shock he would have howled and screamed his denial. Remus's hand gripped his forearm tightly - whether to support him or to keep him silent, Sirius didn't know. Either way, he couldn't move. He could hardly breathe.</p><p>"What?" Harry pushed when Severus just looked at him intensely, his dark eyes watching him carefully.</p><p>"The Adoption Ritual," he finally spoke, softly and carefully. "I would be honored if you would consent to be my son in blood and name."</p><p>The world faded away. Eyes wide, absolutely shocked, Harry could only stare at the man before him. This man had fought for him, had helped him learn who he was and helped him heal the damage in his mind. This was the first person to celebrate his birthday with him, the person who had given him a home. He was secretive and almost too clever, but he never put himself before Harry's needs. At least, not since the whole Black disaster in Third-year.</p><p>Severus even took in Neville, a student he didn't like, all because Harry did. Severus had fought his own mentor for Harry's sake and taken serious injury from the fight he would not have won had it not been for Draco. This was the one who had not fled even Demon, but had remained in the graveyard to rescue Harry. He would have bled to death in minutes had Severus not been there to send him home to Remus and Sirius.</p><p>Harry did love the man, but a father? Could he give anyone that much of himself, that much trust? If he could, Severus was the only person alive who deserved it, but still… Part of him flinched away from the idea, saw it as a trap. He already had the home, had the man's protection and care. Why go further and become of his blood, take up his name, legally place himself under his power as his child?</p><p>"Think on it. I do not require an answer immediately," Severus spoke, breaking the tense silence. He inclined his head again and left the room as quietly as he entered.</p><p>"Harry…" Remus spoke softly, encouraging the teen to open up.</p><p>"I need to think…" Harry shook his head once. Then he thought of something and looked up at Sirius who looked about to scream or cry. "Are you alright?"</p><p>"I…" Sirius swallowed thickly. "I would adopt you as well. Remus would if it were allowed. We all love you, Harry."</p><p>"I know," he said softly, looking down at his hands. Both wrists were bandaged, but otherwise they were uninjured except for some bruising across the back of his hands. "You are both good friends. I care about you, but it is different with Severus. He is…"</p><p>"The one who saved you," Remus spoke gently. He reached over and stroked the teen's messy hair once. "We understand, Harry. We will support any decision you make."</p><p>Sirius nodded, but it looked mechanical. He stuttered something and stumbled from the room. Harry looked up at Remus calmly. He wasn't very worried. Sirius would either be okay with the offer or he wouldn't. Remus smiled and pat his shoulder before turning and following his friend.</p><p>Sighing, Harry leaned back. Alone again but this time he wasn't aware of the room he loved. All his attention was on the decision he was facing.</p><p>
  <b>xXxXxXx</b>
</p><p>The forest that surrounded Draco was ancient. Almost as ancient as his name. They had seen many centuries pass, and, even as a kid, he had felt their strength, had felt insignificant compared to them. Those trees did not care if he were good or bad, right or wrong. More importantly, they did not care he was Heir to the Malfoy name and legacy.</p><p>Draco had always come to this balcony whenever he felt the pressure of being Lucius's son. It had always given him a strange comfort to know that not everything in existence scrutinized him. The forest was a blissful escape when the world was too much, but staring at them now he felt cold and afraid. The trees didn't care about human life or human pain. If someone were tied down between their trunks and tortured under their canopy, they wouldn't help. They wouldn't even notice.</p><p>Shivering, he gasped and backed away. Draco had no idea why he kept coming here. Every time he hoped something would change, that the sense of peace would return, but instead he felt the cold chill of helplessness and nausea. Dark circles lay under his eyes. His pale skin was clammy and gray, no matter the warmth of the summer morning. The sense of illness hung around him, of weakness.</p><p>Coming home from Hogwarts he had known things would be bad. He had been still shaken over Dumbledore's death, could still see it happening in his nightmares, but he had Professor Snape's word that Shadow was safe. He clutched that knowledge to himself and never let it go. Not even when he got home to find his father, pale with blazing eyes, maddened.</p><p>Lucius shifted between fearful - hiding in the library and allowing no one near him - to paranoid. Twice Lucius attacked Draco and his mother, accusing them of being enemies in disguise. The beatings had been horrible but not long lasting. Lucius would stop before too long and just stare at them, eyes wide with some awful light. Then he'd leave them and search feverishly through his office. Papers and books and scrolls were littered throughout the Manor.</p><p>Narcissa and Draco tiptoed around the house. When called on, they obediently helped Lucius put up protective wards and tighten the Manor's defenses. Anything to keep away one of his rages. They just had to get through the summer. Once Draco was back at school, Narcissa would leave to visit family. They just had to survive two months. Of course, Draco had learned long ago that nothing that had to do with his father was easy. Four days ago everything had changed… </p><p>Draco opened his eyes wide, desperate to see what was physically in front of him, even if it was those awful trees, but it was too late. His thoughts had wandered too close to the bright flame of horror in his mind, and he was sucked back there, back in his father's Pensieve...</p><p>He stood there, as if he were a real spectator, in that graveyard. It was as if he were the one bowing down before the disfigured, grotesque being that was the reborn Dark Lord. Red evil eyes and flickering long tongue, the creature was disgusting. Draco heaved but had nothing in his stomach to vomit.</p><p>He stood, trapped in memory, held in place by his father's double, as Death Eater Lucius stepped up for his turn on the body of his only and best friend…</p><p>Merlin…</p><p>…No</p><p>The naked body lay twisted at the waist, arms spasming to the right, his legs broken almost in half in three different places; still… so still… so covered in blood and bone chips…</p><p>As he watched, the blood slowed, the legs were pulled together by an invisible force, straightened in an obscene parody of their natural state…</p><p>All the skin was missing from the body's ribs… They lay in rows, white and glistening with blood in the moon light. They expanded with every tortured breath, sunk in on every scream… The pulpy flesh of lungs pulsed within the fragile cage…</p><p>Even as he watched, the blood was slowed and stopped, skin creeping along like moss… a delicate attempt to cover the organs and maintain life…</p><p>Draco watched as his Death Eater father laughed… fucking laughed… and twisted his wand… the body's slender arm following the movement, popping loudly at the elbow and wrist… and the screams began again… continued on forever… as more cruel magics broke him further… twisted him beyond recognition… beyond humanity…</p><p>Horrifically, the face was untouched… The maddened eyes blazed with terror and pain, with incomprehension and desperation… This face, twisted with agony and drenched with sweat and tears and streaked with blood… this face was that of his best friend… He had sworn to do his best to protect Shadow, and Draco stood there and did nothing as the Death Eaters tortured him… While the Dark Lord watched on with lustful pleasure… While his father stood behind him and clutched at his shoulders, leaving bruises… While his father's mirror pealed more flesh from the broken body of a fourteen-year-old boy.</p><p>"Look! Look at him! He's possessed! He was dying! He should be dead! He's some kind of Dark Creature!" Lucius practically shrieked in his ear as Shadow rose from the ground, still missing chunks of his body, still twisted and broken, but shining with power and a horrible starving rage.</p><p>Draco was glad then, glad his father was behind him, so that he couldn't see Draco's smile. Eyes wide with shock and horror from witnessing his friend's torture, he wanted to laugh hysterically at the irony that they had merely awoken their own destruction. </p><p>"He's not a creature," he shouted over the thunder, screams, and cold delighted laughter. “He's Demon."</p><p>"Yes! Yes! He's a demon!" Lucius gibbered.</p><p>Then everything went black and they were released from the Pensieve… Draco stared blankly at his father, still vibrating from everything he had seen. He could hardly think straight, knew he was close to passing out.</p><p>"We have to protect ourselves from that thing! We have to find a way to destroy it! It'll be coming for us, Draco! We have to stop it," Lucius babbled, eyes bright with manic fever.</p><p>Draco had said nothing in return. He had simply turned and walked away. Away from his mad father, away from the Pensieve… He wished it were as easy to walk away from the memories now trapped in his head. Of his friend's suffering, of his father's crimes.</p><p>For four days, he had locked himself in his room, refusing to see his mother, refusing to eat or sleep. He was thinking; he was trying not to think. Draco didn't really know for sure which he was doing. He felt lost and he was grieving. He was only fifteen for Merlin's sake. His father was a psychotic murderer, worshiping a monster of a Dark Lord. His best friend was going to be hunted down as some evil creature…</p><p>And maybe that didn't even matter. Maybe his best friend no longer existed. How could Shadow survive what they did to him? And even though his father was completely bat-fuck crazy, Lucius still had control of Draco and his mother, still ruled over the Malfoy name and fortune. And… Draco was afraid. Afraid of what his father would do to him and his mother if they were to try and get away. He had watched Lucius torture Muggles last summer, but what he had seen his father take part in at the graveyard went <em>way </em>beyond that.</p><p>What was he supposed to do now? The Dark Lord might be alive… His best friend might be dead… and his father had lost it… What was he going to do? What <em>was </em>there to do? What was going to happen to him and his mother? What was Lucius going to demand of them or force them to partake in?</p><p>Arms wrapped around himself, he turned to go back into his room when something flashed in the sunlight above the trees. Dawn had come an hour ago. The sun had fully risen while he had been trapped once again in his memories of that damned Pensieve. Draco lifted an arm and shaded his eyes, squinting. An owl? Gasping, he ran… </p><p>There! … He could still see it! … A large white owl hovering outside the tightened wards of the Manor: Shadow's owl! He ran into the forest, through the wards, and called for Hedwig. </p><p>The gorgeous owl cut silently through the canopy and came gliding down toward him. Draco beamed, his heart rocketing in his chest with hope and excitement. The owl hooted sternly, nipping him on the ear as she settled on his shoulder. She almost couldn't fit, she was so large now.</p><p>"Sorry, girl. Were you waiting long?" he asked softly, panting and still grinning.</p><p>Hedwig hooted again and lifted her leg where a scroll had been shrunk and tied.</p><p>Draco took it gently and removed the charm, returning it to its rightful size. Needing to move, he walked slowly as he read the message:</p><p>
  <em>Dear Serpentine Prince,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>My apologies for not writing sooner. I've been recovering from a strenuous contest, but I assure you that all is well. I received your gift, the book on the Greek gods. It will greatly help me in my project. Thank you, Serpentine. Hopefully I can return the favor one day soon. In any case, I'd like to thank you in person. Let me know a convenient time. We can meet at Diagon Alley, maybe shop for school supplies together. I am worried you might not have what you need. Let me know as soon as you can.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yours truly,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shadow</em>
</p><p>Draco blinked tears out of his eyes, grinning like a loon. Shadow was indeed well. Cleverly he had coded the message in case he got Draco in trouble. Between the lines, Shadow expressed concern for him and what was happening with Lucius, as well as thanked him for rescuing Severus, but what really made Draco happy was his friend's request to see him soon. Draco would like nothing better, needed nothing better. He knew it was true by the letter in his hand, but he needed to see Harry with his own eyes before the memories in the Pensieve would stop haunting him.</p><p>"Wait here for a minute, Hedwig? I'll be back with your reply shortly."</p><p>
  <b>xXxXxXx</b>
</p><p>Harry ate lunch still in bed. Omi had brought a lap tray and Harry ate from the food given to him carefully. Not only did he have to be careful not to pull on any of his wounds, but his stomach was still uncertain about solid food after weeks of surviving off potions. Remus sat beside the bed, ready to offer assistance if needed. Harry was determined to eat on his own, however.</p><p>"Have you thought about Severus' offer?"</p><p>"I have," Harry answered, sipping from the soup and pretending not to have noticed Sirius going stiff on the opposite side of the bed as Remus. They sat in silence for several dragging minutes as Harry continued to bring a small sip of soup to his mouth one spoonful at a time.</p><p>"Have you decided?" Sirius finally demanded. His blue eyes were bright with anxiety and his hands were clenched at his side.</p><p>Harry sighed. "No. I haven’t, but I am leaning toward accepting. As attractive as hiding out here is, I don't really want to leave Neville and my friends. It would be a shame to give up the chance of experiencing Hogwarts without Dumbledore breathing down my back. Still… I'm not sure it will work out. I'll let you know when I decide for sure."</p><p>This last was said mostly to Remus. Harry thought it unnecessarily cruel to bring up the subject, especially when he didn't have the answer. Remus met his gaze levelly, obviously disagreeing. Sirius, oblivious to their exchange, stood and left the room without another word. Harry lifted an eyebrow, demanding an explanation.</p><p>"He needs to get used to the idea," Remus answered, gesturing toward Harry's food to get him to continue to eat. "He has a tendency to push away things that upset him until he can't any longer. Then he explodes. This way he is forced to face it fairly constantly and releases his displeasure in spurts. Should you choose to accept the adoption, he will have been forced to confront it enough by that point and hopefully won't throw a fit."</p><p>"Hmmm," Harry murmured thoughtfully, slurping his soup. "I see your point."</p><p>"May I offer you my opinion?" Remus asked carefully.</p><p>Harry sighed again but nodded.</p><p>"I think you should accept. Not only do I think Severus takes good care of you, he also works well with you. You two make a good team. And, I think most importantly, you are as good for him as he is good for you." Harry smiled a bit at that and Remus continued. "Also, like Sirius, you need to face the things you don't like, not run from them and get hysterical when you can't any longer."</p><p>Harry grinned. "I don't know. Hysteria has its good points."</p><p>"It may be amusing, but it’s not very productive.” Remus smiled back. "Now eat your lunch. Omi will be very displeased if you don't finish."</p><p>"And how will my doctor feel?" he asked teasingly, looking up through his thick bangs.</p><p>"I'm sure your doctor would not be concerned since he merely has to go to the resident Potion Master and requested more Nutrient Potion."</p><p>"Evil, you are," Harry exclaimed, pointing his spoon at the man. "Severus would be all over me if you told him I wasn't eating."</p><p>"Would he?" Remus asked innocently, his eyes brown eyes sparkling.</p><p>Laughing, Harry realized he was outmaneuvered and finished his lunch. He really didn't want to upset Omi and Severus needed rest. His mentor was still a bit worn from everything that had happened. As a reward for being a good patient, Harry was given his magical parchment that connected to Neville's. He had written his brother briefly last night after he had sent off Draco's letter. Neville was at the Herbology Institute at the moment, but he was desperately glad to hear from Harry.</p><p>
  <em>Hey, brother. You in?</em>
</p><p>There was a long pause, but then quick words appeared. <em>Harry! Hi! I'm at lunch. I can talk for about fifteen more minutes.</em></p><p>
  <em>How is everything? Started any of your own projects yet?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>No, but I'm learning a TON. I wish you were here. It's all so fascinating!</em>
</p><p><em>I'm sure it is. </em>Harry laughed. Neville always made him feel less freakish. His down-to-earth (no pun intended) personality was always refreshing. <em>You'll have to tell me about it in more detail when I see you. When will that be, by the way?</em></p><p>
  <em>The program closes on our birthday. I think I can talk Gran into letting me come to the house a week after that. So probably I'll be by August 7th or so and I'll stay until school. If Professor Snape allows it, I mean.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Of course! That will be nice.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yeah… How are you, Harry? You said you were fine, but…</em>
</p><p><em>I am fine, </em>he interrupted. <em>I'll tell you more in person. Not now.</em></p><p>
  <em>I understand. If you need me, I can come home sooner. I wanted to be with you from the beginning, but Remus…</em>
</p><p><em>He was right, </em>Harry cut in again. <em>I miss you, but I mostly sleep all day. I'm glad you are at the Institute! Wouldn't have gotten you into the program otherwise! Stay. Have fun. I'll be here when you get back.</em></p><p>
  <em>I just feel disloyal.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Don't! Really, Nev. I'm glad you're there. I need time to take in everything that happened. This is good and I'll see you in a few weeks.</em>
</p><p><em>Okay, okay, I get it. </em>Neville wrote, but then he hesitated a second before continuing.<em> Be well, Harry. Write me at night when I have more time to talk. I love you, brother.</em></p><p>
  <em>Same here. I'll write you before bed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Talk to you then.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bye.</em>
</p><p>Harry put aside the parchment and yawned. He hadn't been joking when he said he slept most of the day. At least he was down to only one nap instead of three. Remus projected he would be able to start taking long walks in a week or so. Harry couldn't wait. The bedside service had only been amusing the first six hours or so.</p><p>

</p><p>It wasn't even dark out when Hedwig came swooping into his room after Remus let her in. Remus raised an eyebrow when he saw the scroll, but he didn't push when Harry didn't answer his unasked questions. Instead, he offered to go start his bath, giving him a few minutes alone.</p><p>"Thanks, Remus.” Harry smiled at him. </p><p>The man smiled back and gently shut his door behind him. </p><p>Harry immediately turned his attention to the letter.</p><p>
  <em>Shadow,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I am so thankful to hear from you. I've been worried. There's much to tell you. Things aren't well here. I'll be at Diagon Alley tomorrow. If you can come, meet me at the book store at noon. If not, I'll write you again later in the week with another possible meeting time. Don't write me back.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yours,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Serpentine</em>
</p><p>"Damn."</p><p>Harry crumpled the letter in his fist and scowled at the wall. Draco was in trouble and Harry couldn't hardly sit up on his own let alone get to Diagon Alley, but he had to do something! Lucius had forced his friend to watch him torture innocent people when he was only thirteen and he put Draco under the Imperio Curse for almost three months when he was fourteen. Harry couldn't imagine what the man was like after the disaster in the graveyard.</p><p>"Your bath is ready," Remus said as he entered. He hesitated when he saw the intense look on the teen's face.</p><p>"I need to talk to Severus," Harry said grimly. "Alone, please."</p><p>Remus nodded and left the room. </p><p>Harry sat silently, cursing his body and doubly cursing the Death Eaters. It felt like an eternity before Severus finally came in. "Shut the door please," he said softly.</p><p>Severus lifted an eyebrow, but he did as he was asked. He walked silently across the room and sat in the chair that was now always by the bed. Harry waited for him to sit but just barely.</p><p>"I need your help once again. It's about Draco."</p><p>"What has happened?" </p><p>Severus's dark eyes were neutral and his emotions were like a still pool, giving out nothing. He was the only person Harry knew who could become so still and accepting. Everyone else had a constant flow, no matter how small, of emotions escaping them. Only Severus could stop that flow and direct it inward, canceling it out so that he could observe and listen without distraction. It was one of the things Harry admired most about the man, one of the things he was most grateful for, especially since he was such a powerful Empath.</p><p>"I can't really explain everything," Harry admitted. "Draco has confided in me and I can't betray that trust, but basically he's in trouble. He's going to be at the bookstore on Diagon tomorrow at noon. He wants me to meet him there so we can talk. I need you to go for me. I want him to come here if he can, if you will allow it?"</p><p>"Lucius was one of the ones who hurt you and will, without a doubt, be hunting for you now," Severus pointed out neutrally.</p><p>"Draco is not his father. I can't give you details, but we've been conversing for over a year. I trust him. You know I do. His name came out of that damn spell as an equal to Nev." Harry took a deep breath and met his mentor's eyes. "Well? Will you grant him sanctuary?"</p><p>Severus didn't say anything at first. They just watched each other. Then the older man sighed and crossed his legs, his hands linking over his knee. "I want you to realize that I spent almost a decade creating this house. I've sacrificed many things to ensure this place is safe from detection. No one can find me here or break in. Only I knew of its existence… Until you… I gladly share my home with you. I opened it to Longbottom, Lupin, and Black. That's three more people who can potentially betray this location, who make this place less safe."</p><p>"I do understand that," Harry said softly, lowering his head and fidgeting with his fingers. "I'm as protective of this house as you are, though I know you have no way of knowing that." He fell silent. Sighing, he lay his head back and stared at the ceiling. "You know, growing up, all I wanted was to get away from the Dursleys. I imagined having my own home, but I… I didn't really picture people in it. When I was younger - I guess until I was about six - I imagined my parents or some other family member rescuing me. That fantasy died when I got to school and saw how loving parents acted around their children. I realized that if anyone were coming, they would have by then. So the fantasy changed to a place of my own with no one else. That was my idea of paradise. It kept me going."</p><p>"I was not asking you to justify yourself," Severus said softly into the break in Harry's rambling. "I am not accusing you of being careless with our home."</p><p>Harry smiled at the shared possessive. "I know that." He lifted his face and met his mentor's gaze. "Severus… When you first brought me here… It was… Unfathomable. You had no reason to invest your time and energy in me. Yet you did. You took me in and you really cared what happened to me. Hell, you hid me from Dumbledore and still worked to heal me despite his orders not to. You made peace with enemies for me and you took in another teenager because it would help me cope. You've done a lot."</p><p>"I'm not asking you for commendation either," Severus hissed, his openness rippling and shattering with embarrassment and disquiet. His legs uncrossed and he sat stiffly in his seat, obviously deeply uncomfortable.</p><p>Harry smiled softly. Remus was right. As much therapy as he still needed, Severus obviously had issues of his own that needed to be worked out. His inability to hear compliments or gratitude wasn't healthy, and Harry suspected the root of that problem was very ugly and painful, something he hoped he could help Severus make some kind of peace with.</p><p>"I know you aren't. Just listen," he admonished, making Severus shift some more in his seat. "What I'm trying to say is that of all the things you've given me, this house is the most precious and important. What it symbolizes is what matters most to me. I want to keep it protected as much as you do. If you feel Draco could be a threat - even unintentionally - then I'll have to think of some other way to help him."</p><p>"<em>We </em>will think of some other way to help him," Severus corrected. "I did not say I would not be of assistance. I merely wished to express my concern. Draco is Lucius's heir. If we were to hide him here against Lucius's will, we could not stop him from finding his son or this house."</p><p>"I see." Harry bit his lip thoughtfully. "Blood magic. Made worse because Draco is tied to a large and prestigious family. It would anchor any finding spell and give it strength."</p><p>"And Lucius has no other children. Add to this the fact that Lucius has worked closely with Draco's magic while teaching him from a very young age. It will be almost as familiar as his own," Severus added.</p><p>“Right." Harry nodded. "So what can we do?"</p><p>"Do you know the specific trouble he is having?" Severus asked carefully, finally relaxing again in his chair. He was certain the unexpected emotional exhibit was finished.</p><p>"I'm not sure. He didn't say." Harry uncrumpled the note laying next to him and handed it over. Feeling a bit mischievous as well as nervous, Harry decided to tell the man what he had been trying to say with that unbelievably awkward rant about the house. The timing was perfect since Severus was distracted. "I would be honored to be your son. I agree to the adoption."</p><p>Severus jerked in his chair, almost ripping the letter in half. </p><p>Harry's eyes went wide, matching his mentor's across from him. He had never seen his teacher so shocked before. Never had Severus been caught so off guard that he was ever this expressive with body or expression, but he sat there now with his mouth hanging slightly open, his face paling further, his whole body went tense, and his hand re-crumpled Draco's letter in his fist.</p><p>"Pardon?" Severus finally managed.</p><p>"I… ah… I was trying to say so earlier… but… Anyway, I thought about it and I really like the idea," Harry finished strongly. His green eyes were bright under his thick wavy bangs and round black glasses. His expression was solemn, without uncertainty. This was too important to mess up.</p><p>"You do not have to say so,” Severus said, regaining his footing. "I will help you with Draco in any case."</p><p>"I know that.” Harry shook his head. "I decided this before Draco's answer came." He sighed and ran his hands through his hair, ignoring the pain the move caused. "Look. There are many reasons why I am agreeing. I don't want to leave Hogwarts yet. I want to go back to school with Nev and Draco. I want to keep an eye on what's happening here, but I don't want to be Harry Potter while doing it. I always hated the fame and expectations being Harry Potter brought me. I am glad to finally be shedding it, but more than that…" He looked over at Severus, meeting his guarded dark eyes. "Severus, I've learned to depend on you. I trust you. You're a part of my life now and I wouldn't have it any other way. No matter what I choose, you're going to be there. Might as well as make it official, right?"</p><p>"I… am surprised at your decision. I am aware how much you prize your independence," Severus said carefully. He leaned forward and stared intently at the teen, gauging his reactions and non-reactions. He had to be sure this is what Harry truly wanted.</p><p>"I'm still independent," Harry countered, but his eyes narrowed. "You aren't taking that away from me. You will have no more authority in our personal relationship than you do now, correct? You aren't expecting something else?"</p><p>"You are correct," Severus reassured. "I merely wish to provide you with a firmer foundation of support and protection."</p><p>Harry eyed the man. "Does this mean that you feel obligated to offer adoption? I thought it was because you wanted me as your son as much as you wanted to help me."</p><p>Severus flinched back as if he had been struck, his eyes widened again. "Harry… I did not mean to imply… Of course I do not act out of obligation…" he stumbled over his words, his face pale, distress and anxiety rising off him like smoke.</p><p>Harry smiled softly. He was on a roll tonight. Making Severus lose his almost unwavering emotional footing twice in so many minutes had to be a record.</p><p>Finally, the man cleared his throat and glared semi-menacingly at the smirking teen. "My care for your wellbeing is more personal than a mere wish to help you. When I said I'd be honored to have you as my son, I meant every word."</p><p>Harry really did smirk then. Only Severus would come as close as he ever would to saying 'I love you' while glaring at the other person as if they were guilty of something. In any case, he did understand. And he didn't need empathy to know Severus truly cared for him, so he softened his smirk into a smile. "I will be honored to have you as a father, Severus."</p><p>Red formed on Severus's cheeks. Humble gratitude as well as happiness twined with embarrassment and poured from the slender form of his mentor. Harry's smile turned into a grin when Severus's thin lips twitched up into a small smile of his own. "The ceremony takes place on the day of your birth. There is a potion you will have to drink. It will alter your DNA so that you will be equally made up of mine, Lily, and James's genetic material."</p><p>"So I'll look like a combination of all three of you?" Harry questioned, curious. "I thought I would just have to wear a glamour."</p><p>"It is possible that you will not change very much at all. It is also possible you will change greatly and in ways you might not suspect. Genetics is very complicated. You are made up of as many recessive traits as you are dominant traits. Adding my genetics to the mix may cancel out the dominant traits established from the mixing of Lily and James and allow the recessive ones to the surface," Severus explained contentedly, relaxing into his role as teacher.</p><p>"I'm not going to turn into a girl, am I?" Harry narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "I know I've had alters that were girls, but I would rather not change sex."</p><p>"You will not change gender.” Severus did smile then. "The potion and ritual is designed to take my genetic material and use the combination it would produce for a male child, then bind it with the genetic code you already possess."</p><p>"In a way…" Harry said slowly, his eyes sparkling playfully. "It's kinda like I'll become our child, were it possible for us to make children."</p><p>"That is the most disturbing thing I've ever heard you say," Severus sneered. "But you are correct. When two people mate, they combine their DNA into a single code or a single entity. I am combining my DNA with yours and making a new single entity that will result in your new physical body."</p><p>"You keep emphasizing the physical part. Am I to take it you are reassuring me that my personality, mind, and soul will not be altered or touched in any way?" Harry smiled.</p><p>"Clever child.” Severus nodded. "That is exactly what I'm trying to tell you. If I thought this would affect your mental barriers or bring out Demon or Boy, I would not have suggested it in the first place."</p><p>“Good." Harry nodded decisively. "Because neither are coming out ever again if I can help it. Merging is a lost cause. Boy and Demon are too insane and dangerous. I would not come out of a merging sane or functional."</p><p>"Unfortunately, I agree. Rehabilitation after such severe abuse and trauma is not feasible. Demon is another matter, however." Severus sighed and rubbed at his forehead. "He did not originate within you. He was born of a dark spell that merged with a small portion of your infant soul, thus you claimed him and power over him. There may be consequences to locking Demon away or merging him with your personality. We need to think carefully before we make decisions pertaining to Demon. He is an unknown variable."</p><p>"I guess.” Harry wanted to cross his arms, but knew he shouldn't. His chest still hurt. "For now, though…"</p><p>"Yes. For now we protect your mind from both your alters," Severus agreed.</p><p>They were interrupted from further discussion as Remus knocked on the door and stepped into the room. "The medicines in the bath will expire soon," he said softly.</p><p>"We are finished." Severus stood and carefully pulled down the covers and spelled Harry with a levitation charm. He would have carried him in his arms, but that would unnecessarily aggravate the teen's wounds.</p><p>Harry sighed, but he didn't fight the charm or complain about his lack of clothes. With all the bandages covering almost every inch of skin, he didn't feel very naked. Besides, clothes would just hurt and chafe. He was so used to the consistent low level of pain, he hardly noticed it anymore, but anything added was like hot sparks of shock along his nerves. It was best to just close his eyes and let them help him. Soon he would be able to walk and take care of himself again. Until then, he had to bear it.</p><p>
  <b>xXxXxXx</b>
</p><p>It had been fifteen days since Draco had met Professor Snape at Diagon Alley. Everything had gone according to plan. Draco slowly convinced Lucius that it would be best if the family split up, to give the creature a harder time of tracking them down. Narcissa went to France, Lucius was in London, and Draco told his father he was hiding somewhere safe with friends in Italy. And because the inside of Severus's safe house really was in Italy, any tracking spells would reassure Lucius that his heir was right where he was supposed to be.</p><p>However, instead of going to Italy, he had taken three portkey trips (just to make sure he wasn't being followed) all around England and was finally deposited in this tiny pub with a note informing him to walk up the dirt lane away from the village. Half exasperated at all the fuss and half glad he wasn't staying in this flea-pile of a Muggle town, Draco brushed off his white shirt and black slacks and followed the directions.</p><p>The Muggles in the little town shot him curious looks, but Draco ignored them with well-practiced ease. He was too happy to be out in the open with the sun warming his skin to be irritated. It was summer and, for once, the shadow of fear haunting his steps was gone. He was free of his house and father, his mother was safe, and Shadow was waiting for him.</p><p>Smiling, Draco quickened his pace, passing the last of the small dilapidated little houses. The dirt lane wound through tall green summer grass, through skinny trees that made up the woods in the area. He couldn't see anything ahead; his view blocked by the gentle hills, but that was okay. He was enjoying his walk. It was a nice change after all the whirling portkey trips.</p><p>His smile faltered, however, when a shadow flashed through the brush to his right. He came to a stop, grey eyes wide, trying to catch any hint of movement. His hand moved carefully to his pocket, gripping the wand hidden there. Suddenly, he was afraid this had all been a trap. A convoluted test created by his father. Or maybe Lucius had figured out his deception and had tampered with the last portkey?</p><p>Heart pounding in his ribs, he brushed his hair out of his face and scanned the darkness. The snap of a twig had him spinning around, wand out and ready. He about swallowed his tongue at what he found. There, slinking out onto the dirt lane, was a large cat. It was almost thigh high and had a big angular head with large golden eyes. Its coat was brown and gold, spotted with black. The large twitching ears on its head had tuffs of hair and, as its whiskers swept back, it revealed inch-long sharp white teeth.</p><p>Swallowing, Draco took a few steps backward. "I don't have anything for you," he warned lowly. "No food. Stay back if you know what's good for you."</p><p>The cat ignored his words and moved gracefully forward, its short tail lashing gently behind it with every step. Draco tensed and prepared to fire a spell; the beast was only fifteen feet away… ten… He opened his mouth to shout a blasting curse when suddenly the animal stopped and sat on its haunches. Draco gasped, surprised.</p><p>The cat tilted its head at the sound; its long tongue licking lazily at the top of its lips.</p><p>"Good kitty," Draco whispered, backing away more quickly now. "That's right. Stay right there and I won't have to kill you."</p><p>A coughing sound was his only answer and then a low rumbling purr rose in the air between them. Draco hesitated, growing suspicious as the cat padded forward, still purring. It didn't look aggressive. It looked completely relaxed. Still, he stood completely motionless and rigid as the large and deadly animal pressed its cheek to his thigh and rubbed it twice. Another cough sound and the cat passed and continued up the lane. Draco turned to see it looking over its shoulder.</p><p>"Oookaaayy," he drawled. "If you're Professor Snape's pet, I'm going to have a talk with him about House loyalty."</p><p>The cat rumbled and flicked its tail playfully before loping forward. Draco shook his head and followed, but he kept his wand out. The woods thinned and soon enough he caught a glimpse of the ramshackle two story house at its end. The cat stopped and waited patiently. Draco walked up beside it and the animal butt its head against his legs again.</p><p>"I know," he told it. "The house is probably much better looking inside."</p><p>The cat licked his hand and walked forward.</p><p>"If its not, I'm going to talk Shadow into coming to a hotel with me in Rome," he muttered.</p><p>In minutes, he crossed the wildly unkept lawn and stood at the front door. The cat lounged in the doorway, laying on its side. Draco knelt and bravely stroked its head and behind its ears. The fur was soft. Maybe cats weren't so bad, he mused as he felt the warmth rising from the lean body. Slitted golden eyes watched him and a pink tongue swiped lazily at his wrist. He smiled.</p><p>"Thanks for the escort. At least someone here has manners." Standing, he brushed off his clothes once more and turned the knob. His eyes widened at what he found.</p><p>A modest greeting chamber that opened into two large rooms to the right and left. A large staircase curved around the back wall and rose up to a hall with an open banister. The rooms were brightly lit and everything looked clean and well-cared for. The cat pushed him forward and he walked the rest of the way through. He was gaping into the blue sitting room, which had comfortable luxurious furniture and a huge fireplace when he heard the front door close behind him and a familiar chuckle. He spun, glaring hotly.</p><p>"What do you think of it so far? Better than the outside?" Harry grinned at his friend.</p><p>"Why am I surprised?" Draco crossed his arms and rolled his eyes. "<em>Of course </em>you're an Animagus!"</p><p>Harry ran his hands through his messy black hair, his eyes bright with mirth behind his glasses. "I thought you would like to be greeted. I would have gone as myself, but that is problematic lately. Besides, we've discovered that I don't tire out as quickly when I move about in my animal form."</p><p>Draco's sore mood disappeared and he grinned. Stepping forward to clasp the smaller teen's shoulders, he looked intensely into the now pale green eyes. "You look well."</p><p>"I'm fine, Serpentine.” Harry smiled, but that turned into a worried frown. "Are <em>you </em>alright?"</p><p>Draco shrugged and stepped back, giving them both space. "As well as I can be, but I don't want to talk about that yet. Show me about." He waved his hand imperiously and hooked his blond hair behind his ear.</p><p>"Yes, my prince.” Harry gave a mocking bow and laughed when Draco threw a punch at his shoulder. Harry easily stepped out of range and gestured grandly at the dinning room to the left, across from the sitting room. "This is where we eat most of our meals. Lately I've been forced to eat in bed, but I've been released to use the room again. We will come here for lunch. Our single house elf, Omi, is a charming and talented cook."</p><p>"Really?" Draco played along, smiling. He clasped his hands behind his back and surveyed the room with a regal air. "I suppose I will have to put this claim to the test. I'm certain Omi has not had to cook for someone with as refined tastes as I possess. Hopefully, he is prepared for the challenge."</p><p>Harry laughed and continued the tour. He kept the blond in sight at all times, carefully observing him. Draco was a bit taller - about five feet seven inches now - and thinner. His naturally pale skin looked grey-ish. Tension made the skin around his mouth and eyes tight, and there were faint shadows under his eyes, but the blond hair was just how he remembered it: chin length, thin and light as a feather. As ominous as these other clues were, Draco moved easily and his laugh was free and unburdened.</p><p>Draco was watching Harry just as closely. His friend was thinner and hadn't grown since they last met, still standing at five feet four inches. His olive skin tone was paler than normal, but it didn't look unhealthy. What really caught his attention were the pink healing scars that were scattered around his bare forearms. He knew his friend's T-shirt and jeans hid even more. One in particular looked painfully raw. It was the biggest and ran from Harry's right elbow to the inside of his wrist. Draco wanted to ask if they hurt, but he was uncertain how such questions would be received. He remembered what he had seen in the Pensieve and, considering what had been done to him, Harry looked very well indeed.</p><p>"Draco?" Harry looked back at him. "What's wrong?"</p><p>"Nothing," Draco said softly, fighting the memories. He stood stiffly in the middle of the hall, his fists clenched at his sides. His white blonde hair hung loose and hid his face as he looked to the side.</p><p>Harry frowned and walked back to his friend's side. This wasn't the time to push. They were standing in the middle of the hallway and Draco had asked not to discuss upsetting topics. Harry was determined to make Draco's arrival a pleasant memory. </p><p>"Gee," he said with mocking gentleness. "I didn't know I intimidated you so much. We don't have to if you don't want."</p><p>Draco's head whipped around, grey eyes narrowed into deadly slits. "What are you rambling about now, Potter?"</p><p>"I was telling you about the game room. If you don't want to play against me, you don't have to.” Harry smiled sweetly. "I can watch as you play, if you would prefer that."</p><p>"You're hardly intimidating, Shadow. I was merely giving you an out so you don't have to embarrass yourself." Draco tossed his head and entered the game room. "Since you're too dense to realize kindness when you see it, I'll just have to give you an example to stride toward."</p><p>"Oh, really…" Harry grinned. "I hope you aren't too crushed when you leave this room a bit less confident than when you entered."</p><p>Draco looked around at the seven games, feeling impressed. They were all top models and very expensive. Suddenly unsure about which games would be too strenuous to his still recovering friend, he pasted on a bored expression and flicked his fingers at the brunet. "Since I obviously have the advantage of good breeding, why don't you pick which game you feel most comfortable with."</p><p>"How about a little test of your marksmanship, Serpentine?" Harry drawled and made his way over to the correct game. "You might even beat Nev's score, since you won't get anywhere near mine."</p><p>"We'll see, Shadow… We'll see." Draco cracked his knuckles and lifted the simulator wand.</p><p>
  <b>xXxXxXx</b>
</p><p>Remus and Sirius returned to the house after running a few errands. Severus had left early that morning for a faculty meeting at Hogwarts and Harry had requested to meet Draco alone. Sirius had refused at first, ranting that having a Malfoy in the house would doom them all, but Harry insisted it was safe. Sirius didn't do paranoid half as well as Severus and the Head of Slytherin had put in a dozen safety measures to ensure Draco didn't willingly or unwillingly betray their location.</p><p>Still, the Marauders returned home an hour earlier than they said they would. Sirius's posture was stiff and his eyes were bright. Without waiting, he went in search of his godson and the treacherous little snake. Remus followed quickly after, preparing to intervene if Sirius began to make a fool of himself or upset Harry.</p><p>They didn't have to look long. As soon as they ascended the stairs, the sound of laughter could be heard. It was light and carefree. Hearing it, Remus felt tears burn the back of his eyes. It had been so very long since he heard Harry laugh like that and had feared he would never hear it again. It seemed Sirius was just as affected. The ex-convict hesitated in his headlong pace and some of the tension in his shoulders lifted.</p><p>Silently, they crept to the game room door and peaked in. Draco and Harry stood at the shooting game. Both boys wore bright smiles, making them look younger than their fifteen years. Both were sweaty and playful insults and shoves punctuated their animated play. It was heartening to watch, but Remus was worried when he noticed Harry's flushed cheeks and slightly trembling hands. The teen was far from completely healed and he needed to take it easy.</p><p>The teens turned to look at him as he cleared his throat and he offered a smile. "Hello, boys. It's about time for lunch. Why don't you wash up?"</p><p>"Remus, Sirius.” Harry smiled and gestured to Draco. "This is my friend, Draco Malfoy. Draco, you've met Remus Lupin. He's currently acting as my doctor. This is Sirius Black. My godfather. They stay here with Severus and me."</p><p>"A pleasure to meet you.” Draco bowed slightly. The smile was gone from his pale angular face but not his eyes.</p><p>"Who was winning?" Sirius asked with a grin. He still had reservations about the blond, but he wasn't going to ruin his godson's happiness with his suspicions. He'd just have to settle for keeping an eye on Malfoy.</p><p>"Shadow has better aim, but I hit more targets." Draco brushed his hair from his face with a haughty sniff.</p><p>Harry laughed and shoved at his friend. "Come on, I'm hungry. You can boast about your perfection later." With that, he turned into his lynx form and loped from the room.</p><p>"Show off," Draco sneered, but he followed obediently. He didn't want to get lost, after all. That would be highly embarrassing. Plus, the way Black kept staring at him was slightly unnerving, though he'd never admit it.</p><p>Once the teens were gone, Remus turned to look at his long-time friend. "Harry doesn't trust easily. Draco wouldn't be here if he were going to betray him."</p><p>"All the more reason to make sure Malfoy doesn't hurt him," Sirius insisted stubbornly. "Harry would never trust anyone ever again."</p><p>Remus sighed as Sirius gave him his pleading blue gaze. It was always so hard to say no to that sincere look. "You run the risk of Harry's anger, Siri. He won't appreciate you breathing down Draco's neck."</p><p>Sirius grinned his famous grin, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Then we'll just have to be subtle about it."</p><p>Remus shook his head. The man was incorrigible. Sirius was worse than the teenagers he had taught at Hogwarts… Well, excepting the Weasley twins. Those two were cut from the same cloth Sirius was and still it took two of them to match Padfoot.</p><p>

</p><p>After a lunch filled with casual conversation, Harry led Draco up to the guest room that was usually Neville's when he was there. The house only had four bedrooms. Sirius and Remus were sharing the fourth. Draco's two trunks – one filled with school supplies, the other with clothes – were sitting at the end of the large bed. The room was almost identical to Harry's own; except the carpet was a dark green and the walls were pristine white. The comforter on the bed was a dark velvety purple and filled with down.</p><p>Draco looked around and smirked, "Very nice."</p><p>"I'm glad you approve.” Harry laughed. "Why don't you get unpacked and settled in. I've been ordered to take an hour nap."</p><p>Draco regarded his friend thoughtfully. He did look tired. "I'm sure I can amuse myself that long."</p><p>Harry didn't doubt that, but he felt a little uneasy leaving Draco alone with Sirius and Remus just downstairs. He was well aware of Sirius's dislike and didn't want anything to happen. Still, he couldn't keep the two separated all month, so he left Draco and returned to his room. With a swish of his wand, he set an alarm and crawled into bed. He was asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.</p><p>

</p><p>"So how long did it take you to learn the Animagus Transfiguration?" Draco asked. He was sitting at the mahogany table in the library, leaning over a book on that very subject. A single thin finger ran along the page as he read.</p><p>Harry stood to the right of him, leaning against a bookshelf, as he studied the blond's profile. He remembered the many hours at night he had spent in here as Silas. It was probably his favorite room even now. The only difference was that he wouldn't have appreciated company then, but he was rather content with Draco sharing the space with him now.</p><p>"Shadow?" Draco frowned, looking over.</p><p>"About a year," Harry answered, shaking his head. He came over and took the seat next to Draco.</p><p>"Will you help me?" Draco was already looking back at the book, his finger moving again.</p><p>"Of course.” Harry shrugged and leaned back in the chair.</p><p>They sat silently for long minutes, Draco reading and Harry staring at the ceiling thoughtfully. He was thinking of the times he worked beside the blond on the basilisk just as quietly, just as comfortably. Of course, thoughts of the basilisk led to thoughts of the poison they had created and from there to thoughts of Dumbledore.</p><p>"I'm glad you could come so early," Harry spoke up, lowering his head to meet the gray eyes now focused on him. "Tomorrow night is my birthday. I'm going to go through the Adoption Ritual. You'll get to witness it."</p><p>"Who?" Draco quirked an eyebrow.</p><p>"Severus." Harry shifted his gaze to the book in front of his friend. "You saved his life, Draco. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have this chance."</p><p>Draco lifted his arm and bumped Harry's shoulder. "It had to be done. I'm just glad we were prepared."</p><p>Harry lifted his eyes. He didn't say anything, but he didn't have to. Draco could read his gratitude and sorrow clearly. The blond gave a small smile and nodded, assuring his friend he was okay with what had happened. Harry nodded back, silently promising that he would be there if Draco needed him. He could never pay Draco back for what he had done, for the damage it had to have caused, but he would try.</p><p>"So what animal do you think I am?" Draco asked, smoothly changing the subject.</p><p>"Probably a toad," Harry drawled seriously; only to fall laughing a second later as the Slytherin shoved him from his chair.</p><p>

</p><p>Eleven thirty the next night everyone gathered in the sitting room. In less than an hour, Harry was going to turn fifteen and the adoption ritual would be complete. Harry spent most of the day resting in preparation and was now filled with nervous excitement. The air was thick with tension and building power.</p><p>Sirius, Remus, and Draco stood at the far side of the room. They were silent and solemn. The adoption of a child into a family is a time of celebration, but there were risks involved for both participants; especially since Harry was so old. Usually only babies and young children were adopted in this manner.</p><p>The sitting room looked much bigger when all the furniture was removed from it. The fireplace was blazing and cast the only light in the room. The curtains were drawn tightly across the windows, but even if they weren't the quarter moon was covered by thick clouds. In the center of the room, a circle almost seven feet wide had been drawn with soil that had been sprinkled with rainwater. The door to the room was barred with powerful magic.</p><p>Severus stood naked in the center of the circle with an equally naked Harry. His body was covered in raw, pink scars, but they looked much better than a week ago or even a day ago. Both of them were unaware of the spectators in the room. Their full attention was on each other. Harry had natural Empathy, but the ritual would grant Severus the same ability. They stood facing each other, getting to know the complexities of each other's personalities and weighing the sincerity behind the wish for adoption. They were stripped down to their bare essentials.</p><p>After almost thirty minutes of silent study, both nodded. Neither stepped out of the circle to cancel the adoption. Severus walked to the center of the circle and picked up the large dagger there. Chanting in Latin and Greek, he began the familial binding. Harry took one slow step toward him at a time, demonstrating trust and free will. Had he been a baby, one of the witnesses would have levitated him. The baby's magic would cancel the simple charm had the child been at all distressed at the move toward the knife-wielder in the center.</p><p>Severus stood tall and straight. His lean body pale but strong. Freshly washed, ink black hair hung straight to his shoulders. Thin eyebrows arched over deep set, dark black eyes that watched his son's face for any sign of reluctance. He found none. Thin lips twitched up in a small smile before his hand brought the dagger to his chest, where he cut the length of his sternum as he continued to chant.</p><p>"Oμολογία. Vinculum nos una; μαζί αρχή. Planto nostrum orsa ut unus; πατέρας έσος μια. Trado ut abbas quod filius, planto nostrum αφαιμάσσω compositus; οικογένεια γιος ."</p><p>Harry's eyes, uncovered by his glasses, went wide, but he didn't move to interrupt. He knew what the ritual entailed; he wasn't surprised. Still, it was hard to watch Severus bleed before him and do nothing.</p><p>The blood welled on Severus's chest before slowly rising up as if unaffected by gravity. It splattered on Harry's neck, and the teen couldn't help flinching. The blood moved as if it were a thick stream, coating Harry's skin completely. He was covered from the waist up when Severus sunk to his knees. Harry began to tremble with the effort of remaining still. Had he been a baby, he would need very little blood to be covered. He prayed Severus's calculations were correct and the man wouldn't bleed to death before this was over.</p><p>Severus was swaying by the time the last inch of Harry's skin was coated, but he refused to fall. The wound on his chest sealed shut magically, and he sat there pale and covered in a cold sweat as he waited for Harry to become his in blood and name.</p><p>Harry felt the change come almost instantly. He shivered and squeezed his eyes shut as his skin shifted and his body changed - Severus's blood absorbed into him, became a part of him. It didn't hurt exactly, but it wasn't pleasant either. He focused desperately on outside stimuli, trying to distract himself from what was happening to his body. He could hear the fire crackling, could even hear the quick anxious breathing of Sirius. He could smell blood and sweat, but also a hint of the sage that was burning in the hearth.</p><p>He was so intent on ignoring his body that he gasped with surprise when he suddenly collapsed. Severus grabbed him, keeping him in the circle, but he quickly released him again. Eyes open, Harry arched, crying out softly. The room was spinning; was he melting? Slamming his eyes closed, he fought not to get sick. He was changing at a genetic level, his whole body was becoming something different. He opened his mouth, panic slamming into his system as the primal instinct to escape rocked a scream from deep in his chest.</p><p>Suddenly, he was disconnected from his body. He was completely unaware of it convulsing, of the sound of his bones grating and shifting shape underneath his skin. He couldn't feel anything; not even his slow rough breathing. It was as if he were floating or heavily drugged. Nothing mattered. He was safe and at peace. He was home. He was held by Severus's calm voice telling him to be calm, that it was almost over. He let himself drift for time on end.</p><p>And just as quickly he was back. His chest and hips ached horribly. He had the sudden feeling that his arms and legs were too long. He knew with certainty that if he tried to walk, he'd only fall over. Biting his lip, he opened his eyes. Severus was leaning over him, his dark eyes practically radiating worry, but then the man gasped with something like shock.</p><p>"What?" Harry croaked, his voice slightly deeper.</p><p>"Your eyes…" Severus whispered. His hand came up and gently turned his son's chin so he could see better. "They are like my mother's."</p><p>"What… does that… mean?" </p><p>Not getting an answer, he painfully sat up. Severus was quick to brace him. Harry took the robe Sirius handed him. Severus had already pulled on the one Remus provided. Harry was just tying the sash when he noticed everyone was staring at him. He looked up at Draco and shivered at the intense look in the blond's stormy eyes. </p><p>"Omi?"</p><p>There was a loud pop and the tearful and exuberant elf appeared next to him.</p><p>"Can you bring me a large mirror?" Harry asked quickly, hoping to head off the tumble of words he could tell Omi wanted to spill.</p><p>"Yes, Master sir.” Omi bowed deeply before disappearing.</p><p>He sat, just catching his breath for a minute, until the elf returned. His body was aching horribly, like a toothache but worse. Remus offered him a pain soothing potion, but Harry shook his head. He knew he'd fall asleep as soon as he took anything and he wanted to see himself first. That was when Omi returned with the mirror. Severus held it up with his normal blank expression. It was Harry's turn to stare stupidly.</p><p>He looked completely different, but at the same time… He could recognize himself. His nose was the same, long and straight – not too big, not too small. So was his mouth, lips even and full – not thin and long like Severus’s - but his chin was pointier and his eyebrows were now thinner and gently arched. His hair was still black, but now it fell in curls. He remembered seeing a picture of his mother's mother at the Dursley's. She’d had curly hair just like this, but it had been red like his mother's. He was glad his hair was still black. His new curls spilled over his forehead and over his ears, he looked younger now; maybe thirteen. Then again, considering his slightly deeper voice and the fact he was a little taller, maybe he could be a believable fifteen.</p><p>But it was his eyes that made him really stare. They were two different colors! One was still the lighter, more intense green. The other was blue; the pale kind of blue. He lifted his hand, watching his reflection do the same, and touched just under his blue eye.</p><p>"Your mother had eyes like this?" he demanded, looking over his reflection's shoulder to stare at his new father.</p><p>"She did.” Severus tipped his head forward once in a brief nod. "Blue and green, just like that, but not quite as… vibrant."</p><p>"And Lily said she had an uncle with eyes like that; one blue, one brown. She always loved the idea. Thought it was so beautiful. She had hoped her children would have the same eyes," Remus spoke up softly.</p><p>"Looks like no matter who my parents are I'm going to look like a freak. First a horrible scar on my forehead…” Which hadn't changed at all; neither did any of his other ones gained by the torture he had endured in the graveyard… "and now multi-colored eyes!"</p><p>He turned his attention to the rest of his body, not quite ready to accept his new freakish feature. A quick spell revealed he was taller by two inches. He was just Draco's height now. But his hips and pelvis were smaller and his shoulders were less broad. His skin was pale, like Severus’s and Lily’s. Gone was James's nice olive skin. In fact, the only thing left of James was his nose, mouth, and shape of the forehead. Well, his hair was still messy. Maybe that was the same, too.</p><p>With a sigh, he turned to face the others in the room. "Well, who am I, Severus?" </p><p>It was tradition and the close of the ritual for the new father to re-name the child. Harry was a new person now. In more ways than one. For the first time since he was five, Harry was relatively whole; his personality almost completely integrated. Demon contained his pent up rage, but the alter wasn't born from him. Boy was the only piece of himself lost, but… There was just no way to heal Boy at this time. He was facing the world as a new person inside and out. It was only natural to take up a new name as well. Harry Potter certainly didn't fit anymore. It was too limiting and carried too much baggage that he was ready to set down.</p><p>"You are my son," Severus answered evenly – as if he had been saying it all his life. "You are Shadow Harold Lilium Snape."</p><p>Shadow relaxed his shoulders. He hadn't known what Severus was going to name him and was very glad to be keeping a name he felt comfortable with. But still… "Don't you think its risky for my middle names to be so connected to Harry’s life?"</p><p>"Tell me, of all your classmates, how many of their middle names do you know?" Severus drawled with a satisfied quirk of his eyebrow.</p><p>"Neville Augustus Longbottom and Draco Lucian Narcissus Malfoy," Shadow conceded. "So not many."</p><p>"You are not a freak, Shadow," Draco suddenly spoke. His eyes hadn't left his friend once this whole time. "You never were. I think you are beautiful. You are an asset to the Wizarding world."</p><p>"I agree completely," Sirius chimed in tearfully and he moved forward to wrap Shadow into a hug. "You are unique. That is nothing to be ashamed of!"</p><p>Shadow sighed again, staring at his new face. It was already feeling like his own, but his eyes… He sighed again and lay back down carefully. Pain flared in all his joints and he gestured weakly at Remus. The werewolf knelt and began cascading the youth with a soothing chant that had him sinking into a deep sleep, free of pain.</p><p>"Were his injuries aggravated?" Severus asked, pulling his robe tighter. His dark eyes shown brightly, but the emotion in them was hard to weigh.</p><p>Remus wondered if it was pride. Worry? Trepidation? He shook his head once, amused at himself. Severus was never trepidatious. He faced his problems with a deadly determination to make them disappear. Shaking off his thoughts, he focused on his patient. "His scars are strained, but none have torn open. His bones are strong, but his joins and ligaments are all swollen and strained. I'll ease the pain and help encourage healing. Sleep is actually the best thing for him."</p><p>"I can help carry him to his bed," Sirius offered, knowing magic cast on Harry… No, Shadow… could possibly disrupt the magical healing still going on in his godson's body.</p><p>Severus sneered at the man, ready to reject him out of hand. He could carry his own son without help, but Draco caught his eye. There was no expression on his face and he didn't make any subtle gesture, but Severus could read his intent easily. It was a Slytherin way of communicating and he paused to reevaluate the ex-convict.</p><p>Black was thin. Better than when he had first escaped Azkaban, but… He was still not completely within a healthy weight range. His black hair was thinning, still wavy as it had been when he was a teen. It fell just past his narrow shoulders now, but it was his face that really made him reconsider. The man had the most… unusual expression.</p><p>His eyes were bright with tears, his face pale. He looked like he was grieving as he stared down at Shadow, but his body language spoke of no aggression. Severus could see clearly the man had given up parental claim over the teen. Severus knew how hard that must have been to the man who had made Shadow the symbol of his sanity in a place worse than hell.</p><p>"Very well.” Severus inclined his head. He didn't respect Black any more than he had before this night, but he could grant the man some reassurance. He wanted the man to stay accepting. No need to provoke him back into irrationality where Shadow was concerned.</p><p>Sirius looked up at his old enemy with surprise. He had known the answer would be a rejection before he had even asked, but he had spent a lifetime speaking before thinking. Therefore, it took him almost a whole minute and for Severus to lift an eyebrow with cold derision before he realized he had been given what he had asked for.</p><p>Remus put a supportive hand on his best-friend's shoulder. Sirius's throat tightened, but he bent down and carefully maneuvered the teen into his arms. A gentle spell from Remus insured the teen wouldn't wake. Carefully, silently, they all filed out of the dark sitting room and into the well lit hallway. They didn't speak as they ascended the stairs. As they approached Shadow's room, Draco did pause.</p><p>“It's late. I think I'll retire. Good night," he said.</p><p>Severus turned to look at him. "Thank you for witnessing this event."</p><p>The blond lowered his head in respect. "The match is a good one. I wish you both prosperity and wellbeing in the future."</p><p>"Good night, Draco," Severus answered softly, pleased and proud.</p><p>The teen turned without another word and entered his guest room. </p><p>Severus stood in the hallway for a moment more. He pulled the black silk robe closer around his body. He could feel the thin scar over his chest where he had made the cut. His limbs still trembled faintly, though the potion he had consumed after the ritual had helped greatly. It was done. Shadow was his in blood and name. He had a son.</p><p>He went to his child's door and peered inside. Remus's wand was involved in a graceful dance above Shadow's sleeping body. Sirius stood nearby, just watching. Satisfied Shadow was safe for now, Severus strode down the hall to his own chamber.</p><p>
