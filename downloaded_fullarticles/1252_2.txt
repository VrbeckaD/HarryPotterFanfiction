<p></p><div><h2>Chapter One: Ineffable Boys</h2></div><div><p>Aziraphale sat alone in a carriage compartment of the Hogwarts express.</p></div><div><p>“It’s part of the great and ineffable plan, Aziraphale.” Gabriel had said.</p></div><div><p>“But do I REALLY need to be a child? Can’t I be a teacher when he’s old enough to go to that school?” Aziraphale had asked.</p></div><div><p>“This Potter boy is more likely to open up to someone his age.” came the reply. “I’m sure being born into and raised by a human family will be tolerable; if Jesus did it, so can you.” Aziraphale had spent ten years as an ignorant human child, and was now remembering his Heavenly life, as his task to protect Harry Potter began. This Harry Potter was special. The only person who could stop Voldemort, the latest spawn of Hell. Someone had to be Harry’s Guardian Angel, and Aziraphale was chosen. He was, after all, the only angel with significant Earth experience. It was a bit strange since the Almighty disapproved of witchcraft, but Aziraphale had been assured that it was for the greater good. Better a wizard of light in power than a wizard of darkness, after all. The only things Aziraphale was looking forward to were the books and the divination. And the books of divination. He had always had a weakness for books of prophecy.</p></div><div><p>As Aziraphale stared listlessly out of the carriage window, his current reading material lying on his lap, the compartment door suddenly opened.</p></div><div><p>“Have you seen a toad? Neville’s lost one.”</p></div><div><p>It was a girl.</p></div><div><p>“Erm, no, my dear, I’m afraid I haven’t seen any toads, except those chocolate ones on that trolley, although those are frogs, which are, of course, quite different, so I don’t suppose he’d be looking for one of those, would he?” answered Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>The girl stared at him.</p></div><div><p>“No, no he wouldn’t.” she answered at last. She eyed the book on his lap. “You like to read? You’re the only person I’ve seen with a book out on this train.”</p></div><div><p>“Love it. My life’s ambition is simply to own a bookshop.” replied Aziraphale cheerfully.</p></div><div><p>“Me too. The reading, I mean, not the bookshop. Not that I’d MIND owning a bookshop, but you know, it’s not quite my life’s ambition.”</p></div><div><p>“Of course.”</p></div><div><p>“Well, I should keeping looking. Thanks!”</p></div><div><p>“No problem, my dear.”</p></div><div><p>The girl left the compartment. Aziraphale didn’t have to wait long to have company again, however, for the door opened again, and a tall, skinny youth stood in the doorway.</p></div><div><p>“Hello, angel.”</p></div><div><p>Aziraphale turned, and his face lit up.</p></div><div><p>“Crowley! What a pleasant surprise! Do sit down.”</p></div><div><p>Crowley entered, shut the door behind him, and sat down.</p></div><div><p>“We’re eleven.” he said plainly.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, it is strange. Our bodies were always those of adults. This is a very large change.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Can’t drink.” said Crowley, missing his alcohol privileges.</p></div><div><p>“I KNOW, it IS unfortunate.” said Aziraphale sympathetically.</p></div><div><p>“At least we’re in it together.”</p></div><div><p>“Quite.”</p></div><div><p>“Although I suppose we’ll be cancelling each other out again.”</p></div><div><p>“I’m supposed to protect this Potter boy.”</p></div><div><p>“I’m supposed to thwart him. Possibly kill him.”</p></div><div><p>“Oh dear.”</p></div><div><p>“That’s what I’m saying, and we’re supposed to do this for HOW long?”</p></div><div><p>“Seven years.” moaned Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“At least it’s the number of the Almighty, eh?” said Crowley with a grin.</p></div><div><p>“I wish it weren’t. Maybe if it were six it would all go up in flames.” said Aziraphale. He tried to keep a straight face, but he failed, and they both laughed.</p></div><div><p>“But really,” said Crowley after they recovered, “what are we going to do? Because we can’t do what we’ve always done, with the Arrangement, because this concerns the fate of ONE person, not random blessings and tempting that, all around, mean nothing much at all.”</p></div><div><p>“I don’t know my dear. Neither of us want this Voldemort in charge, but you can’t exactly be caught HELPING me defend Potter. And you must have SOMETHING to show, or else they’ll suspect.”</p></div><div><p>“And we can’t just say you continually thwart ME because then they’ll send backup from Downstairs and then we’ll REALLY have problems... What if neither of us do anything?”</p></div><div><p>“What, and lie about it? I couldn’t possibly.”</p></div><div><p>“You’ve lied about a lot more than you’d let on.”</p></div><div><p>“All right, but that aside, I can’t just sit and do nothing because if I don’t help the boy, this Voldemort will have a field day, and neither of us want that!”</p></div><div><p>“Well... well, what if I tell them I’m trying to, you know, convert him. Bring Potter to the Dark Side, I mean.”</p></div><div><p>“Was that... was that STAR WARS?? Really, Crowley.”</p></div><div><p>“Do you think they’d believe and accept that? I mean, Potter on their side would be a real feather in their wing, because two powerful Dark Wizards are a whole lot better than one powerful living Dark Wizard and a dead Light Wizard, eh?”</p></div><div><p>“Well, you really ought to ask them first, you know, because if they don’t like the idea they’re more likely to suspect that you’re playing games with them.”</p></div><div><p>“Ask Hell’s permission, that’s a new one. But you’re right.” said Crowley amused.</p></div><div><p>“I’d hoped you’d agree with me.” said Aziraphale contentedly.</p></div><div><p>“It’s settled then.”</p></div><div><p>“Quite, my dear.”</p></div><div><p>“We’re on our side.”</p></div><div><p>“Actually, it would appear that we’re both on Heaven’s side.”</p></div><div><p>“Actually, I never said I WASN’T going to try to convert this Potter boy. Can’t let his only influence being entirely heavenly, can I? How would he turn out?”</p></div><div><p>“Like me,” said Aziraphale, hurt.</p></div><div><p>“Now, now, I didn’t mean it like that. Think of it this way: he’ll turn out a bit like me. You like me, don’t you?”</p></div><div><p>“Well, when you put it that way... I suppose he SHOULD be allowed to choose whether he likes books or Bentleys, at the very least.” said Aziraphale with a smile.</p></div><div><p>“Exactly,” said Crowley, leaning back in his seat. “Our side?”</p></div><div><p>“Our side.”</p></div><div><p>There was a pause.</p></div><div><p>“So. Houses.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Houses?” said a puzzled Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“School houses. The groups that you get sorted into.”</p></div><div><p>“Oh! What about them?”</p></div><div><p>“Well, we’ll get sorted. I think you’ll get Ravenclaw. Books and intelligence and all.”</p></div><div><p>“I suppose you must get Slytherin, as you ARE a snake, after all.”</p></div><div><p>“Pity we won’t be together.”</p></div><div><p>“But less suspicious.”</p></div><div><p>“True.”</p></div><div><p>There was a pause.</p></div><div><p>“So. We have families.” said Aziraphale. “At least I assume you had the same thing happen to you as I did.”</p></div><div><p>“Yes, unfortunately.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Unfortunately?”</p></div><div><p>“My... father. He... well never mind, it’s not for you to worry about.”</p></div><div><p>“Tell me. Please.” begged Aziraphale. Crowley sighed.</p></div><div><p>“I think he hates me.”</p></div><div><p>“No, no, my dear! That can’t be true!”</p></div><div><p>“He just works and ignores my existence. Crouch the Grouch, he is.”</p></div><div><p>“Crouch? You’re Bartemius Crouch’s son??”</p></div><div><p>“I told you not to worry about it.”</p></div><div><p>“Well I... of course I’m going to worry about it! But he IS a bit...</p></div><div><p>“Yeah.”</p></div><div><p>“Well, how about your mother?”</p></div><div><p>“Very attached to her only son, but rather under Father’s finger.”</p></div><div><p>“Oh dear.”</p></div><div><p>“Not to mention I’m a junior.”</p></div><div><p>“Ohhhh dear.”</p></div><div><p>“I got lucky actually. It just so happens that Barty Senior’s middle name is Anthony, and Mum’s maiden name is Crowley. So I’m still Anthony Crowley, by choice, I just lost the J. What about you?”</p></div><div><p>“You won’t like it.”</p></div><div><p>“I told you, now you tell me. Be fair, angel.”</p></div><div><p>“Aziraphale Lovegood.”</p></div><div><p>“Lovegood? As in Xenophilius Lovegood?”</p></div><div><p>“Yep.”</p></div><div><p>“You’re THAT nutter’s son??”</p></div><div><p>“I TOLD you!”</p></div><div><p>“Oh, Aziraphale, a person like you in a family like that... and your mother, she’s dead, isn’t she?”</p></div><div><p>“Yes, she is. Poor Luna saw it happen.”</p></div><div><p>“Luna?”</p></div><div><p>“My younger sister, by a year.“</p></div><div><p>“Oh. How’d you end up with Aziraphale still?”</p></div><div><p>“They have a thing for the moon, my parents, and the only existing name close to Aziraphale means moonlight, and obviously LUNA is lunar, so with a little divine intervention...”</p></div><div><p>“Aziraphale.”</p></div><div><p>“Bingo.”</p></div><div><p>“Soooo your name means chivalry and good loving moonlight.”</p></div><div><p>“Well I AM a lover of good, obviously, I’m an angel! And I’d like to think I was chivalrous. The moonlight thing well... well, Anthony means flower, so we’ve both got problems.”</p></div><div><p>“It does not!”</p></div><div><p>“Anthos in Greek is flower, so close enough. Closer than Aziraphale and moonlight, definitely.”</p></div><div><p>“Ugh. But anyway, you’re stuck with a bunch of hippies. I’m surprised it didn’t rub off on you in the ten years of not knowing you were an angel. Being Bartemius Crouch Jr certainly rubbed off on me... And angels are more gullible.”</p></div><div><p>“One’s nature is one’s nature, no matter who you’re born to— particularly when you’ve had that nature for over 6,000 years. Luna loves books so we get on, in that sense. And I’m sure you’re not all that changed.”</p></div><div><p>“No, maybe not. Not now that I’ve remembered everything, anyway. Not now that I’ve remembered you.... My bitterness will fade like the darkness into dawn.”</p></div><div><p>“That was very sweet and poetic, Crowley. You know, I’ve always thought that deep down, you’re really very—“</p></div><div><p>“Oh, tell it to the world, why don’t you.”</p></div><div><p>“— nice.”</p></div><div><p>“I’m a demon, I’m not NICE.” muttered Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“I beg to differ.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“You do differ.”</p></div><div><p>“Oh, be quiet!”</p></div><div><p>And they went on fighting that sort of half-fighting that old married couples do until the train pulled into the station, never thinking that in a compartment just down the hall, Harry Potter had made his first friends and his first enemies— Crowley and Aziraphale were already back to being slack workers.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><h2>Chapter 2: It’s Complicated</h2></div><div><p>“He’s in Gryffindor! What the Heaven are we supposed to do with THAT?!” asked Crowley angrily.</p></div><div><p>“I was wondering the same, my dear.” sighed Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“We’ve got to nab him tomorrow in the free period.”</p></div><div><p>“Nab him?? Really, Crowley, must you say it that way?”</p></div><div><p>“Well, pull him aside, introduce ourselves. That lot.”</p></div><div><p>“Quite right.”</p></div><div><p>The celestial duo had been correct in their house assumptions, and were now facing the fact that their time with Harry would be limited. After Sorting, dinner, and a long speech of welcome and rules from Headmaster Dumbledore, Aziraphale and Crowley only managed to convene for a moment before being whisked apart and away to their dormitories.</p></div><div><p>The next day, at free period, Crowley sauntered, and Aziraphale walked, outside onto the green, where most of the students were.</p></div><div><p>“Glasses, scar, black hair... glasses, scar, black hair...” repeated Crowley under his breath.</p></div><div><p>“Glasses!” cried Aziraphale suddenly.</p></div><div><p>“That’s what I said.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“No, not his, YOURS! Take them off.”</p></div><div><p>“What?!”</p></div><div><p>“Go on! Take them off!”</p></div><div><p>“Why?” asked Crowley defensively.</p></div><div><p>“Because I’ve got a hunch.” replied Aziraphale. Crowley sighed, and removed his sunglasses.</p></div><div><p>“Aha!” cried Aziraphale. “I was right! No human woman would have a snake-eyed child, and therefore, you can’t have reptilian eyes in this body!” Two perfectly normal brown eyes stared out at him from underneath young Crowley’s mop of dark red hair.</p></div><div><p>“I can make them reptilian if I want to, and I like the glasses,” said Crowley, putting his sunglasses back on.</p></div><div><p>“I prefer it when you don’t hide a chunk of your face, but I won’t tell you not to.”</p></div><div><p>“There’s Potter - come on!” With that, Crowley grabbed Aziraphale by the arm and pulled him to where Potter and a red-haired boy sat on the lawn.</p></div><div><p>“Hey guys! Potter andddddd Weasley, isn’t it?” asked Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“That’s right, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley.” said Ron, the red-haired boy, grinning.</p></div><div><p>“And it’s Lovegood and Crouch, isn’t it?” asked Harry.</p></div><div><p>“We prefer Anthony Crowley and Aziraphale, but yes, you’re right.” replied Aziraphale, designating who was who with gesture of his hand.</p></div><div><p>“So if you prefer those names, what are your real names?” asked Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Bartemius Anthony Crouch jr. I go by my mother’s maiden name, Crowley. Aziraphale’s name is his given first name— he’s not much of a last name person.” explained Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Wait a minute, you’re a Slytherin, aren’t you?” asked Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah, why?” asked Crowley. Ron wrinkled up his nose.</p></div><div><p>“Slytherins...” he said as if the word needed to be sanitized before use. “You’re not friends with Malfoy, are you?”</p></div><div><p>“I’ve never so much as spoken to him. Aziraphale’s my only friend— but I’d like to change that,” said Crowley, putting out his hand.</p></div><div><p>“It’s an awful mistake to judge a book by its cover, I assure you.” added Aziraphale. Harry nodded at Ron, who then took Crowley’s hand.</p></div><div><p>“All right, we’ll give you a chance.” Ron said.</p></div><div><p>“Thanks! We red-heads ought to stick together, with all these jet blacks and white blondes about!” said Crowley with a wink, nodding to his and Ron’s companions. And then they all sat down together.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>“So, you’re going to be a Seeker,” said Crowley casually, catching Harry in the corridor after dinner. That day had been their first flying lesson, and some very interesting things had happened. Harry stood up for Neville Longbottom, and nearly got kicked out of school— but he ended up Gryffindor Seeker instead.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah— how did you know?” asked Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Word gets around quick. I also know you’re dueling Malfoy tonight.”</p></div><div><p>“HOW did you know THAT?”</p></div><div><p>“I’m a Slytherin, remember? I share a dormitory with your enemies, and Crabbe and Goyle aren’t very quiet.” said Crowley, grinning.</p></div><div><p>“Oh!” said Harry with a chuckle.</p></div><div><p>“I think I’ll tag along after Malfoy tonight— but I’m on your side, of course.”</p></div><div><p>“Should we tell Aziraphale? Since you’re mates...”</p></div><div><p>“Ohhhh, no, I wouldn’t. He’d try to stop you— he’s practically a guardian angel.”</p></div><div><p>“What, does act like one for you?”</p></div><div><p>“In a sense, yes. But we’ve been together a long time— he’s bound to worry about his friends whose minds he doesn’t know so well.”</p></div><div><p>“That’s nice of him.”</p></div><div><p>“Yessssss.”</p></div><div><p>“I’d better go— see you later, Anthony!”</p></div><div><p>“Later, Harry!”</p></div><div><p>As he walked away, Harry wondered why Crowley occasionally elongated his s’s, like the hiss of a snake.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>“Wait, you’re NOT going duel Potter?” asked Crowley incredulously.</p></div><div><p>“No, I’ve tipped off Filch, and that’ll get Potter and Weasley expelled.” answered Draco Malfoy. “You got a problem with that, Crouch?”</p></div><div><p>“It’s CROWLEY, and no, not particularly. It just seems... well, never mind.”</p></div><div><p>“It just seems what?”</p></div><div><p>“Nah, never mind.”</p></div><div><p>“What??”</p></div><div><p>“Well, it seems rather chicken, doesn’t it? You wouldn’t want Potter to think you’re really yellow-bellied, would you? I mean, that’s just more ammo for him to use later, after he humiliated you, calling you a coward this afternoon. If you don’t fight, you’re just proving his point.” said Crowley matter-of-fact-ly.</p></div><div><p>“Who’s side are you on anyway?” spat Malfoy. “I’ve seen you hanging around with that lot and that pansy of a Ravenclaw! I don’t trust you as far as I can spit.”</p></div><div><p>“I wouldn’t trust me as far as I can spit either, so here’s to you!” replied Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“That doesn’t answer my question. Are you on our side, like a proper Pureblood Slytherin ought to be, or have you been brain-washed by that lot?”</p></div><div><p>“Who’s side do YOU think I’m on?” asked Crowley. He pulled down his sunglasses, and flashed a pair of yellow reptilian eyes at Malfoy. Malfoy’s face drained the little color it had, and he stared, horrified.</p></div><div><p>“W-what was t-that?” he stuttered.</p></div><div><p>“What was what?” asked Crowley nonchalantly, his glasses returned to his face.</p></div><div><p>“Y-your EYES!” whimpered Malfoy. “Th-they’re like, like snakes’!”</p></div><div><p>“What?!” laughed Crowley. “You’re seeing things.” He pulled down his glasses again, and a normal pair of brown eyes winked at Malfoy. “Well, I’m off to bed, as you’ve changed your mind about the duel, yeah?”</p></div><div><p>Malfoy didn’t know what to answer, for now he was scared that if he didn’t duel, Crowley would do something horrible to him— but he was too sickened by what he’d just seen to stomach the idea of dueling.</p></div><div><p>“I-I don’t think I can. I’ve just begun to get a headache.” he said meekly.</p></div><div><p>“Then I guess I’ll have to stand in for you,” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“But what about Filch?” asked Malfoy squeakily.</p></div><div><p>“I’ll deal with him.” answered Crowley dubiously. Malfoy had no doubt that Crowley WOULD deal with Filch, and he really didn’t want to see how.</p></div><div><p>Crowley sauntered out of the common room and headed for the trophy room. Seconds after he got there, someone else did too— but it wasn’t Filch, or Harry, or Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Angel!” cried Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Crowley? What are you doing here?” asked Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“I could ask you the same question!” replied Crowley. “How did you know about the duel? I heard because I’m in Slytherin. But you’re not in Gryffindor so...?”</p></div><div><p>“Hermione Granger told me; we met on the train. She heard Malfoy challenging Harry, and heard you talking to Harry. She’s seen us all together, so she thought I might be able to talk some sense into the lot of you. It would appear the boys never take her advice.”</p></div><div><p>“Malfoy isn’t coming. He never intended to. He’s tipped off Filch instead. I said he’d be a coward if he didn’t duel, but I scared the living daylights out of him so that he REALLY chickened out, so I said I’d have to stand in for him. Of course, I’m actually warning everyone about Filch.”</p></div><div><p>“Scared him? Scared him how?”</p></div><div><p>Crowley flashed reptilian eyes at Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Really, Crowley, was that necessary to do to the boy?” scolded the angel.</p></div><div><p>“I’m allowed to have fun, aren’t I? If I’m going to be stuck doing this for another six years, I’m bloody well going to enjoy myself, and Malfoy deserves a bit of scaring!” replied Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Has it ever occurred to you that perhaps he’s simply misunderstood? He mightn’t have a happy home life, or some such issue. Barbarism begins at home, you know.”</p></div><div><p>“Was that... was that THE SMITHS?? I didn’t think you’d ever so much as heard a Morrissey song, Aziraphale! Good, isn’t it?”</p></div><div><p>“Well, I suppose that his music could be defined as— oh, never mind that! Now isn’t the time to talk about music!”</p></div><div><p>“It’s always the time to talk about music.”</p></div><div><p>“I’m serious! I was talking about something important!”</p></div><div><p>“You’re the one who quoted him.”</p></div><div><p>“Listen, do unto to others as you would have them to do unto you! Do not judge lest ye be judged! Many people are really just misunderstood. Perhaps that’s the case with young Malfoy.”</p></div><div><p>“Do you really believe all of that?”</p></div><div><p>“How else would an angel be friends with a demon, I ask you?”</p></div><div><p>“Fair poi— wait, you think I’m misunderstood?”</p></div><div><p>“Well, I wouldn’t be friends with you if I thought you’d truly deserved to Fall. You’re not like the other demons.”</p></div><div><p>“Of course I am!”</p></div><div><p>“Look me straight in the eye and tell me that again.”</p></div><div><p>There was a pause.</p></div><div><p>“I’m waiting.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“All right, you win.” hissed Crowley. “But you’re nothing like the other angels!”</p></div><div><p>Another pause.</p></div><div><p>“I never said I was.” answered Aziraphale at last. Crowley looked in surprise at Aziraphale, and their eyes met. Some sort of understanding passed between them, which was a rare happenstance for them— because of their respective homes, they were still always a little at odds.</p></div><div><p>They smiled.</p></div><div><p>Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville came into the room.</p></div><div><p>“Hang on, where’s Malfoy, and what’re you two doing here?” asked Ron in surprise.</p></div><div><p>“Here go the explanations AGAIN.” sighed Crowley, and he and Aziraphale both explained their presence.</p></div><div><p>“So Filch is coming.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“I TOLD you this was horrible idea!” hissed Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“Being that we know, it doesn’t matter now, as long as we hurry and get out of here.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“And Malfoy will get in trouble for playing a trick on Filch, as a bonus!” said Crowley wickedly.</p></div><div><p>“Oh dear,” said Aziraphale sadly. Naturally no one else showed any regret. “But I suppose evil DOES ALWAYS contain the seeds of its own destruction!”</p></div><div><p>“Shut it, angel!” snapped Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Angel?” asked all four Gryffindors at the same time.</p></div><div><p>“It’s a nickname.” said Crowley, pretending not to notice the awkwardness.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah, we got that.” said Ron.</p></div><div><p>“The question is ‘WHY?’” stated Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“Because like I told Harry earlier, Aziraphale is practically a guardian angel. Very protective. And all those comments about good and evil. He can be a bit holier than thou, too, at times. So I call him angel.” said Crowley. There’s nothing so easy to believe as a lie wrapped up in the truth.</p></div><div><p>“Well I AM holier than thou! A great DEAL holier than thou! The fact that I’m different from my fellow angels doesn’t void that fact!” hissed Aziraphale defensively in Crowley’s ear. Crowley just waved his hand dismissively. Then they heard a sound. A voice.</p></div><div><p>“Oh dear!” whined Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Filch!” hissed Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Let’s go!” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“About time! What are we doing, waiting for Armageddon?” asked Crowley, annoyed. He really didn’t feel like dealing with Filch.</p></div><div><p>They ran out of sight just as Filch came in, muttering to Mrs. Norris. Unfortunately, Neville tripped, tripped Ron, and they both fell into a suit of armor.</p></div><div><p>“CLANG! CRASH! BANG! THUMP!”</p></div><div><p>“Ohhhhh it’s Armageddon now!” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“RUN!” Harry yelled. With Harry in the lead, they all raced and hurtled through who knew where, ending up in the Charms corridor. And then they met the last person they wanted to: Peeves. After a moment’s argument, Ron took a swipe at Peeves, who as a result, bellowed out where they were. The students ran for their lives— smack into the end of the corridor... and a locked door. As Filch’s steps sounded in the hallway, Hermione whispered “Alohomora!” and the door opened. They rushed in and slammed the door behind them. The Gryffindors were listening to Peeves send Filch off in a rage— but the celestial duo were paying attention to something else.</p></div><div><p>“Ohhhhhh Antichrist!” whimpered Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Hoooooly Archangel Gabriel!” shrieked Crowley.</p></div><div><p>There, standing in front of them, was a monstrous three-headed dog. A vicious, six-fanged dog. It growl a deep, menacing growl, the kind of growl that starts in the back of one throat and ends up deep in someone elses. They had entered the forbidden corridor, where Dumbledore said all would endure a most painful death...</p></div><div><p>“It’s a great big Hell-y Hell Hound!” said Crowley, almost cheerfully. “He might be nastier than the one we’ve got Downstairs!”</p></div><div><p>“There’s another one downstairs??” whimpered Neville.</p></div><div><p>“Not that kind of downstairs,” said Aziraphale darkly. “Speaking of which, do you suppose this one could be from Downstairs, Crowley?”</p></div><div><p>“Well if it IS,” said Crowley, “if it IS, I SHOULD be able to control it, to some extent.” Crowley edged towards the hound and, being sure not to let the Gryffindors see, flashed his reptilian eyes at it. He extended his hand toward the beast.</p></div><div><p>“I command you to stand down.” he said firmly. The dog snarled and pounced at him. Aziraphale managed to miracle the door open just in time, and everyone tumbled out.</p></div><div><p>“NOT from Downstairs!!” announced Crowley.</p></div><div><p>They slammed the door shut behind them, and hightailed it to the split off between common rooms.</p></div><div><p>“Is everyone okay?” asked Aziraphale. Murmured affirmations came in reply. Still, he looked them up and down. “Crowley!”</p></div><div><p>“What?” asked Crowley defensively.</p></div><div><p>“Erm... your arm.” said Ron awkwardly. Crowley looked down at his arm— his sleeve was stained crimson. The dog had gotten to him after all.</p></div><div><p>“Ah,” he said “I knew something felt wrong.”</p></div><div><p>“We’d better wake up Madame Pomfrey.” said Hermione sternly.</p></div><div><p>“Nah, this isn’t anything to get us expelled over— it’s just a scratch.” said Crowley nonchalantly.</p></div><div><p>“Are you SURE?” asked Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Positive. Looks worse for the sleeve being mangled. It’s just a little scratch underneath, I can handle it myself.” Crowley assured.</p></div><div><p>“Well... if you’re REALLY sure...?” said Neville.</p></div><div><p>“Yes! Go! Be gone! To bed with you all!” said Crowley playfully.</p></div><div><p>“Okay... Goodnight, Anthony. Goodnight, Aziraphale.” said Harry. Everyone said goodnight, and the Gryffindors went down the hall and disappeared from sight.</p></div><div><p>“Crowley, is it REALLY just a scratch?” asked Aziraphale. His question was answered by Crowley collapsing onto the floor.</p></div><div><p>“Crowley!!” Aziraphale cried.</p></div><div><p>“Sorry, I’m so sorry.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“No, no, my dear, don’t apologize!” said Aziraphale hastily.</p></div><div><p>“Damn these human bodies!” growled Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Let’s see what I can do...”</p></div><div><p>Aziraphale placed his hands on Crowley’s arm. Crowley winced.</p></div><div><p>“Try not to move,” said the angel. He closed his eyes. His brow furrowed. Suddenly, there was a sort of dull glow from beneath his hands. He let go.</p></div><div><p>“There! That’s the best I can do, I’m afraid.”</p></div><div><p>Crowley looked down at his arm. The gore was gone, and the wound was now smaller, cleaner, and already starting to close.</p></div><div><p>“Wow that’s... thank you.” he said solemnly.</p></div><div><p>“Of course, my dear— do you think I’d let you bleed out and discorporate on me? No, sir!” replied Aziraphale. “Just a few finishing touches— it’s still gong to bleed and hurt a bit, I’m afraid... I can do this part with magic instead of miracles— don’t want to upset Gabriel!”</p></div><div><p>Aziraphale waved his wand, and bandages appeared and wrapped around Crowley’s wound, and the tear in his sleeve mended itself.</p></div><div><p>“Aw, you didn’t have to, angel.” said Crowley appreciatively.</p></div><div><p>“I WANTED to.” Aziraphale replied.</p></div><div><p>“Do you know what you are, Aziraphale?”</p></div><div><p>“What?”</p></div><div><p>“My own personal Jesus.”</p></div><div><p>“Depeche Mode??” asked Aziraphale, laughing.</p></div><div><p>“You know your music better than I thought.” remarked Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Well, the radios WILL insist on playing modern hits instead of instrumental classics.”</p></div><div><p>“Yes, I suppose so.”</p></div><div><p>There was a pause.</p></div><div><p>“Sometimes I wonder what he’d think. Jesus, I mean.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Think of what?” asked Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Of us being friends. He seemed to be very understanding, and he was the only one of our kind who ever had friends— the Apostles — but he always followed the Almighty, down to the letter.”</p></div><div><p>“I don’t know... I liked him too, but I’m not sure that means anything. He wasn’t very happy to see me.”</p></div><div><p>“Maybe I should take the whole situation up with him sometime.”</p></div><div><p>“Isn’t it just as hard to get in touch with Jesus as it is to get in touch with the Almighty?”</p></div><div><p>“Yes, but if I ever DO get the chance... maybe he could change some things.”</p></div><div><p>“He’s more likely to send you to Hell than to bring me back to Heaven, Aziraphale, no matter how understanding he is.”</p></div><div><p>“I say we should ask to be human, but when we died we’d go back to our Places permanently!”</p></div><div><p>“That’s a horrible thought. It’s better the way it is, as long as it doesn’t go pear-shaped.”</p></div><div><p>“I LIKE pears!”</p></div><div><p>“You know what I mean.”</p></div><div><p>“Yes, I do... I wish it wasn’t so complicated!”</p></div><div><p>“Me too, angel, but that’s ineffability for you.”</p></div><div><p>There was silence for a moment.</p></div><div><p>“Well, we should probably go to sleep— or at least appear to.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah.” agreed Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Can you make it back to the Slytherin common room all right?”</p></div><div><p>“Now that you’ve fixed me up!”</p></div><div><p>“All right. Goodnight, Crowley. Sleep well.”</p></div><div><p>“Goodnight, Aziraphale. You too.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><h2>Chapter Three: Broomsticks and Bad Guys</h2></div><div><p>“So, who won?” asked Malfoy the next morning.</p></div><div><p>“Potter.” said Crowley dully.</p></div><div><p>“I could’ve beaten him.”</p></div><div><p>“I don’t believe that. You would’ve fought if you thought you could win.”</p></div><div><p>“Sometimes I think you must forget who I am.”</p></div><div><p>“Which makes it clear that you forget who I am. Your father may be on the Hogwarts Board of Governors, but my father works for the Ministry. And we’re both as pureblooded as the other. You have nothing over me.”</p></div><div><p>“My father could work for the Ministry, but we’re rich, so he doesn’t have to. Money is power.”</p></div><div><p>“Some say my father will be the next Minister of Magic. No amount of money could buy your father that privilege, especially not in time to beat mine.”</p></div><div><p>Suddenly, someone tapped Crowley on the shoulder. It was Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Our presence has been requested elsewhere.” he said.</p></div><div><p>“Who speaks like that? Pansy.” spat Malfoy.</p></div><div><p>“Well-read people, my dear, that’s who.” replied Aziraphale coolly. Crowley got up and left with the angel.</p></div><div><p>“Taunting that boy again, Crowley?” Aziraphale asked.</p></div><div><p>“He started it.” said Crowley breezily.</p></div><div><p>“Crowley, DO try not to be so childish!”</p></div><div><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, I should act 6,000 years old when I’m in an 11 year old body because that’s not suspicious and my brain chemistry hasn’t changed at all—!”</p></div><div><p>“No, just... well, there is a LINE isn’t there? Some things we still ought to be above?”</p></div><div><p>“Is there? I come from the lowest place in existence!”</p></div><div><p>“Well you don’t COME from there, you were SENT there.”</p></div><div><p>“That was a long time ago.”</p></div><div><p>“It’s gone faster than we thought.”</p></div><div><p>“Mm... So what’s up?”</p></div><div><p>“Harry and Ron want to tell us or show us something.”</p></div><div><p>The celestial duo were let into Gryffindor Tower by Harry and Ron, who quickly revealed that Aziraphale had been right on both accounts.</p></div><div><p>“So the saying or the showing first?” asked Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Saying,” said Harry and Ron together.</p></div><div><p>“Hermione told us that the dog was guarding something— it was standing on a trapdoor!” said Ron excitedly.</p></div><div><p>“A trapdoor to Hell?” asked Aziraphale darkly.</p></div><div><p>“I’ll bet you it’s guarding what Hagrid took from the vault at Gringotts— the vault was broken into not long after we left.” said Harry</p></div><div><p>“It must be very important!” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Well OBVIOUSLY!” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Whatever Hagrid took, it was tiny.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“A giant Hellhound guarding a tiny package, how ironic.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Is there anything else we should know?” asked Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“No, that’s all we’ve got. Now for the TREAT—!” said Ron, gesturing toward the package Harry was holding.</p></div><div><p>“Come on, we have to open where no one else will see,” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>The group went upstairs, and opened the package on Harry’s bed.</p></div><div><p>“It’s auhhhhh fancy broomstick...?” said Aziraphale unsurely.</p></div><div><p>“It’s a Nimbus Two Thousand, the newest model!” beamed Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Oo, that’s nicccccceeee,” crooned Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“First years aren’t supposed to have brooms, but Harry’s playing Quidditch and doesn’t have a broom at home like most of us soooooo Professor McGonagall allowed him THIS!” boomed Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Does it come in black?” asked Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Don’t even think about it, Crowley, you’ll get in trouble!” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Oh, sorry, MUM!” retorted Crowley. “And how do you know I’m not thinking about next year anyway?”</p></div><div><p>“It was a presumption, I admit, but I KNOW you! And really, that insult was quite unnecessary.”</p></div><div><p>“Ah, stop taking everything so harsh, angel! I don’t take everything YOU say harshly.”</p></div><div><p>“I’m not harsh!” said Aziraphale defensively.</p></div><div><p>“Ohhhh really?” asked Crowley, raising an eyebrow.</p></div><div><p>“Well... I suppose I CAN be a bit...”</p></div><div><p>“Holy than thou?”</p></div><div><p>“Now don’t start that again!”</p></div><div><p>“Boy, you guys go at it like my mum and dad!” cried Ron, laughing.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>On Halloween day, they had been at Hogwarts for two months. Harry couldn’t believe how time had flown, but the celestial duo were used to that— to them it was only yesterday that Adam and Eve had been forced to leave the Garden of Eden.</p></div><div><p>“Do you think we’ll be seeing anyone from Downstairs tonight?” asked Aziraphale in a whisper to Crowley as they sat together in Charms class. Halloween always made Aziraphale a bit uncomfortable, for although he recognized that nowadays it was essentially harmless, it hadn’t always been so innocent, and he loved Crowley’s company, but he would do anything to avoid the other demons.</p></div><div><p>“Nah, I doubt it,” replied Crowley, unworried, “And if we do, it’ll be Hastur and Ligur asking me what I’m up to, and they’ll only lurk by the Forbidden Forest— they wouldn’t come up here, it’s not lurk-y enough.”</p></div><div><p>“Lurk-y enough?” said Aziraphale, he eyes twinkling with repressed laughter. Crowley grinned and winked.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>“Noooo Hastur and noooo Ligur!” said Crowley cheerfully as they entered the hall for the feast that night.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, it’s turned out, which is relieving, to be an uneventful Halloween!” said Aziraphale, equally as pleased.</p></div><div><p>“What the saint??” exclaimed Crowley, suddenly grabbing Aziraphale and pulling him out of the center of the hall. Aziraphale looked and saw that Professor Quirrell had nearly just mown them down. The turban clad professor sprang up the hall, collapsed at Dumbledore’s chair, and said,</p></div><div><p>“Troll— in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.”</p></div><div><p>Then he fainted. An uproar began, but Dumbledore brought silence.</p></div><div><p>“Prefects,” he rumbled, “bring your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!”</p></div><div><p>“Hermione isn’t as the table!!” hissed Aziraphale to Crowley, scanning the room.</p></div><div><p>“So what?” asked Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“First of all, Crowley, that means she doesn’t know about the troll, and second, HARRY WILL MOST LIKELY TRY TO SAVE HER!”</p></div><div><p>“What!? He doesn’t even like her!”</p></div><div><p>“Yes, in the same way I don’t like you. Mark my words, Harry and Ron will slip away, somehow.”</p></div><div><p>“Fine. I’ll handle this.” In the commotion, no one noticed one Slytherin student vanish. Aziraphale made sure he stayed at the back of his group, and had soon dumped the large snake he’d been hiding into an appropriate corridor.</p></div><div><p>“I’ll join you as soon as I can, Crowley.” he said, and hurried along. It didn’t take Crowley long to spot Harry and Ron behind a large stone griffin. He quickly morphed back into his human form and sauntered up to them.</p></div><div><p>“Psst!” he said— although it sounded more like a hiss. It was all the Gryffindors could do not to cry out, for it had scared them.</p></div><div><p>“Anthony!! How did you slip away??” asked Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Ohhhhh, I have my ways. Aziraphale’s trying to, too.” Crowley answered.</p></div><div><p>“How did you know we’d—“ began Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Aziraphale noticed Hermione was missing.” answered Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Bloody intelligent Ravenclaws.” said Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Come on!” said Harry, slipping out from behind the griffin.</p></div><div><p>“Why were you behind that griffin, and where are we going now?” asked Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Well, we thought we heard Percy, so we hid, but it’s actually Snape— he’s NOT with the rest of the teachers, he’s headed for the third floor, so we’re going to follow him!” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Hang on, can you smell something?” asked Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah, and it’s worse than Beelzebub!” answered Crowley, wrinkling up his nose.</p></div><div><p>And then they saw it: twelve feet tall, carrying a sodden club, and hideously ugly— the troll. The group stood motionless, hoping not to be noticed by the monstrous creature, as it slowly made up its tiny mind to enter a room that had its door wide open.</p></div><div><p>“The key’s in the lock, we could lock it in.” muttered Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Good idea,” said Ron nervously.</p></div><div><p>“No, bad idea. Horrible idea. The absolute worst idea I’ve ever heard.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Why?” asked Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Because, genius,” said Crowley, “THAT’S the girls bathroom.”</p></div><div><p>Suddenly they heard a high, petrified scream.</p></div><div><p>“Hermione!!” cried Harry and Ron together.</p></div><div><p>“Yep.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“We have to get her out of there!” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“How, exactly?” asked Crowley. He was totally up for fighting the troll, but he would use tactics these kids would ask questions about, so they couldn’t be there, and they CERTAINLY couldn’t fight that thing WITHOUT his tactics. Before the boys could answer Crowley, and the troll suddenly fell through the bathroom doorway, and landed with a giant THUD.</p></div><div><p>“What the Heaven did that??” cried Crowley. The group raced to the bathroom door, stepped over the troll, and entered. There they saw something very unexpected: Aziraphale, wand outstretched, and looking very determined, and Hermione standing just behind him, looking frozen.</p></div><div><p>“Angel! How on EARTH did you get here before us?” asked Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Never mind that, how on EARTH did he defeat the troll!?!?” cried Harry.</p></div><div><p>“It’s impossible!” cried Ron. “How DID you do it?!”</p></div><div><p>“Oh, I have my ways,” said Aziraphale modestly.</p></div><div><p>“No, really. Come on, Hermione, how did he do it?” asked Harry. Suddenly, Hermione unfroze— no one but Crowley noticed Aziraphale snap his fingers behind his back.</p></div><div><p>“I– I— What?” stuttered Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“How did Aziraphale defeat the troll!!” cried Ron frustratedly.</p></div><div><p>“I- I— don’t know! He came and found me and tried to warn me about the troll, and then a moment later there it was, and I screamed, and then he went towards it and then— then— well, I don’t really know!” stuttered Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“You don’t even remember what spell he used?” asked Harry. Hermione shook her head, and blushed.</p></div><div><p>“Well, I guess it was a miracle!” said Crowley with cheerful irony. Aziraphale scowled at him.</p></div><div><p>“Is it— dead?” asked Hermione. Aziraphale blushed.</p></div><div><p>“No... I haven’t quite got it in me to... kill, anything. But it will be unconscious for a good while, long enough for us to get out of here and for the teachers to find it.”</p></div><div><p>“But it could take them hours to find it! We have to tell them, even if it gets us in trouble.” said Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“It’ll be out for hours.” said Crowley plainly.</p></div><div><p>“I trust Anthony and Aziraphale.” said Ron, really not wanting to get into trouble.</p></div><div><p>“So do I.” said Harry— even if the troll woke up, clearly Aziraphale could knock it out without a hitch.</p></div><div><p>“Well... all right.” said Hermione. The group left the bathroom, and then split up and headed for their separate dormitories. Once Aziraphale and Crowley were out of earshot, Harry turned to Ron and Hermione,</p></div><div><p>“Don’t you think it’s pretty weird that Aziraphale defeated that troll? And don’t you think it’s pretty weird that he wouldn’t tell us what he did, and that Hermione can’t remember, and that Anthony seemed totally unsurprised? And don’t you think it’s pretty weird that both Aziraphale and Anthony somehow managed to find us AND weren’t seen?”</p></div><div><p>“Yeah it’s... pretty weird.” agreed Ron.</p></div><div><p>“And,” said Hermione “I certainly was SCARED but I felt... petrified, for a moment, and I can’t really remember anything about that span of time, almost like I was asleep, but not. Almost like...”</p></div><div><p>“He bewitched you, without ever casting a spell.” said Harry grimly.</p></div><div><p>“Do you think it’s Dark Magic? Like... You-Know-Who?” asked Ron fearfully.</p></div><div><p>“I don’t know... Aziraphale REALLY doesn’t seem the sort.” said Harry. “And Anthony may look the sort but he’s too... I don’t know, fun-loving. He’s not like the other Slytherins.”</p></div><div><p>“I agree, Harry— but we shouldn’t dismiss what we’ve seen.” said Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“What should we do, spy on them?” asked Ron.</p></div><div><p>“NO, Ronald! We should ASK them about it.” Hermione replied. “Speaking of asking, what were you doing near the girls bathroom anyway?”</p></div><div><p>“Well...” began Ron.</p></div><div><p>“What?”</p></div><div><p>“We were trying to warn you, same as Aziraphale.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“‘Specially since it’s our— MY, fault that you were there anyway.” said Ron bravely.</p></div><div><p>“Oh— well— thank you.” said Hermione, not quite sure what</p></div><div><p>to say.</p></div><div><p>“You’re welcome.” said Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Anytime.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Aziraphale and Crowley were sitting awkwardly in a small niche in the corner of the closest connecting corridor between the Slytherin and Ravenclaw common rooms. They did this every evening, for no Slytherin wanted a Ravenclaw in their common room, and no Ravenclaw wanted a Slytherin in their common room, and the celestial duo preferred not to make any trouble over their friendship. Sometimes they stayed in the Gryffindor common room under Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s protection, but not when they wanted to discuss things as their 6,000 year old selves instead of their 11 year old selves, because the Gryffindors always joined them in conversation.</p></div><div><p>“Do you think they suspect something?” asked Aziraphale, sitting primly on the corridor windowsill.</p></div><div><p>“Between the dog incident and the troll incident it’s definitely a possibility,” answered Crowley, shifting uncomfortably in his own corridor windowsill.</p></div><div><p>“Are you all right?” asked Aziraphale, eyeing Crowley’s shifting.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah I’m fine.”</p></div><div><p>“It’s just you look uncomfortable.”</p></div><div><p>“Well I am a bit.”</p></div><div><p>“Oh dear— I’m quite comfortable, perhaps that windowsill isn’t up to snuff. Would you like to switch?”</p></div><div><p>“They’re exactly the same, Aziraphale, it’s just that my arse is bonier than yours is!”</p></div><div><p>“Language, Crowley!”</p></div><div><p>“Fine, my ASS is bonier than yours is!”</p></div><div><p>“That’s WORSE!”</p></div><div><p>“But ass is in the Bible, it can’t REALLY be a swear word, can it? I mean, they talk about jackasses and all that—“</p></div><div><p>“CROWLEY!” shouted Aziraphale reproachfully.</p></div><div><p>“All right, all right! My... lower... quadrants, are... less cushioned than yours are.” said Crowley in the same manner in which a drunk person tries to remember their address when they call a cab. Aziraphale gave Crowley a look that wasn’t quite ANGRY— more simply suspicious, and possibly displeased, as he recognized that it might be taken that Crowley was calling him fat. On the other hand, or so Aziraphale thought, Crowley could use more meat on his bones anyway— he’d never liked how perfectly Crowley fit into those skinny jeans, for surely to do that in his adult form his was a bit TOO skinny to be healthy; and if Aziraphale was anything, he was a worrier.</p></div><div><p>Just then, Harry came running down the hall towards them, with Ron and Hermione just behind.</p></div><div><p>“You’ll NEVER guess what I just found out!!” he panted excitedly.</p></div><div><p>“What, my dear?” asked Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“SNAPE has been bitten by the DOG!!” Harry cried, still out of breath.</p></div><div><p>“How on EARTH did that happen?” asked Aziraphale, shocked. He didn’t particularly care for Snape, especially with Snape’s attitude toward Harry, but Snape WAS still a Hogwarts teacher and deserved a certain amount of respect and trust as such, as both Aziraphale and Hermione agreed.</p></div><div><p>“Well, we noticed he was limping earlier, and he took a book from Harry—“ started Ron.</p></div><div><p>“An’ then just now I went to the staff room to ask for it back and there were Snape and Filch, and Snape’s leg was all bloody and mangled and as Filch was handing bandages to Snape, Snape was saying ‘How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?’ Then he saw me and his face went all twisted with fury and he tried to hide his leg and he just SCREAMED get out.” finished Harry breathlessly.</p></div><div><p>“Needless to say, Harry didn’t get his book back.” added Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“So THIS means Snape tried to get past the dog on Halloween, that he’s trying to get whatever it’s guarding! I bet my broomstick he let the troll in, to make a diversion!” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Well, you mustn’t jump to conclusions, Harry.” warned Aziraphale. “For if DUMBLEDORE trusts him...”</p></div><div><p>“I agree, Aziraphale.” said Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“I’m with Harry, it’s not like all the teachers are saints or something, even if they are trusted!” said Ron. “What do you think, Anthony?”</p></div><div><p>Crowley looked very pensive.</p></div><div><p>“Well,” he said, “I think it’s POSSIBLE that Snape is up to no good, but it’s also possible he was asked by someone, Dumbledore for instance, to help with the dog, and simply failed. Miserably.”</p></div><div><p>“We need more EVIDENCE, to say either way.” said Aziraphale firmly. Harry and Ron were not sure about this, but they couldn’t see any argument. It was in this blank moment in their minds that they remembered the dog had mangled more than one person.</p></div><div><p>“Erm, change of subject but, uh, how’s your arm?” asked Harry of Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Oh! Ah, it’s fine.” Crowley answered dismissively.</p></div><div><p>“Can we see?” asked Ron, speaking like a young training solider to a veteran hero. Crowley smirked and rolled up his sleeve. Despite what Aziraphale had done, the wound still left a nasty scar.</p></div><div><p>“Hey, you said it was just a scratch. Scratches don’t leave scars like THAT!” called out Harry. Aziraphale AND Crowley blushed.</p></div><div><p>“Ah, well, I lied a bit. I’m pretty good at that. Didn’t want to worry you.” said Crowley. Simply being good was an understatement, of course, seeing as Crowley invented the lie.</p></div><div><p>“But you couldn’t have left it untreated, and you couldn’t have gone to Madam Pomfrey or you would’ve gotten expelled— or even if you hadn’t gotten expelled, the whole school still would’ve found out you’d been mangled by the dog.” said Hermione suspicious-and-ever-factual-ly.</p></div><div><p>“Come to think of it, why did you think you could control that monster anyway?” asked Ron. “And what was all that ‘downstairs’ business?”</p></div><div><p>“And not to mention defeating the troll...” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>Crowley looked at Aziraphale. Aziraphale nodded. Crowley turned to the Gryffindors.</p></div><div><p>“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” he said.</p></div><div><p>Crowley and Aziraphale snapped their fingers. The Gryffindors blinked.</p></div><div><p>“Ah, erm, what was I saying? Oh yeah, Snape. Don’t trust him.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah... Snape.” murmured Ron.</p></div><div><p>“I’m tired— we should all go to bed before we get in trouble.” said Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, go on.” encouraged Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Night, guys.” said Crowley with a wave.</p></div><div><p>The Gryffindors disappeared back to their common room.</p></div><div><p>“Ohhhhhh, I HATE doing that!” moaned Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“I don’t like it anymore than you do, angel, but we didn’t have much of a choice— if we didn’t block the memories we’d have to tell them the truth, which we can’t do, obviously; which means we have to block Neville Longbottom’s memories too, because if anyone mentions those thoughts, the memories are unblocked.” said Crowley solemnly.</p></div><div><p>“What will we do when it’s over, once Harry’s grown up and left this place, once our contracts are finished?” asked Aziraphale. “Will he never be allowed to know?”</p></div><div><p>“I have absolutely no clue, Aziraphale, none at all.” Crowley answered.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>“Are you ready to go?” asked Aziraphale the next morning.</p></div><div><p>“Go where?” asked Crowley. It was a quarter to eleven, and Crowley was happily stretched out in the grass, with no intentions of going anywhere.</p></div><div><p>“Why, to the Quidditch match! Harry’s playing!” answered Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Nahhhhh, it’s sports! Not really my scene.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Well it’s not really my ‘scene’, as you put it, either, but I reasoned that with all of the dangerous things about of late that we’d best go, to look after him.”</p></div><div><p>“What could possibly happen to him in a school game, Aziraphale? With all those people watching, all those... witnesses.”</p></div><div><p>“One could reason ‘what could possibly happen to him at school?’ If a school can be infiltrated, why NOT a game?”</p></div><div><p>“You’ve got a point, angel. But then again, I’m not really supposed PROTECTING him, am I? That’s your job— I’M the opposition.”</p></div><div><p>“I’m afraid I have no argument there, my dear, but I... I COULD use your company...?”</p></div><div><p>“All right, I’ll come.” That was something Crowley could never refuse.</p></div><div><p>Crowley and Aziraphale found Ron, Hermione, and Neville, and sat down in the stands beside them. The celestial duo took advantage of Neville being there, and snapped behind their backs, blocking his memories too. In contrast to everyone else, the duo were clearly unamused by anything happening in the game.</p></div><div><p>“I’ve just never been able to wrap my head around sports.” Aziraphale muttered to Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Yessss, this is just one dummy trying to knock off another dummy with a bit of a stick.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“They’re not supposed knock each other off of their brooms, Crowley.” said Aziraphale with a touch of worry in his voice.</p></div><div><p>“Well it certainly looks like they WANT to,” replied Crowley with a smirk.</p></div><div><p>Time passed, and Harry was perfectly fine.</p></div><div><p>“Aziraphaaaaalllllllle, can we go? Nothing’s happening, the boy is FINE!” whined Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“We can’t LEAVE, Crowley, it would be RUDE!” said Aziraphale reproachfully.</p></div><div><p>“Hang on, I take that back, what the HEAVEN is happening with Harry’s broom?!” cried Crowley.</p></div><div><p>Harry’s broom was jerking and twitching, moving away from the game.</p></div><div><p>“You don’t suppose he’s lost control?” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“He’s too good of a flier.” said Crowley. “Someone’s messing with it!”</p></div><div><p>Harry’s broom rolled over and over, then gave a wild jerk. Harry swung off it and was dangling, holding on with only one hand.</p></div><div><p>“I TOLD you he was in danger!” hissed Aziraphale. Others tried to fly to Harry and grab him, but when they did his broom would only carry him away from them.</p></div><div><p>“<em>Aziraphale</em>...” said Crowley pointedly.</p></div><div><p>“Yes. Right. Time for some divine intervention.” said Aziraphale. A moment later, Harry’s broom was carrying him safely to the ground. Crowley looked around.</p></div><div><p>“That Quirrell fellow... he looks... off.”</p></div><div><p>“Would you mind elaborating?”</p></div><div><p>“Well he looks confused. Everyone else looks relieved.”</p></div><div><p>“Confused... because his plan has been thwarted and he doesn’t know how.”</p></div><div><p>“Exactly.”</p></div><div><p>“I think we should... snap, him and let Harry finish the game. If nothing happens, we’ll know it’s Quirrell.”</p></div><div><p>“I agree.”</p></div><div><p>And suddenly Quirrell was frozen, and miraculously, the whole time, no one noticed. The only thing they noticed was that Harry Potter won the game.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><h2>Chapter* Four: Lovegood and Crouch, Domestic</h2></div><div><p>
      <b>*A Very Short Chapter Indeed</b>
    </p></div><div><p>“We can’t POSSIBLY leave Harry alone for Christmas!” said Aziraphale. “He nearly got killed in less time than it took to play a Quidditch match!”</p></div><div><p>“Look, I got orders from Hell to go home because otherwise it would be suspicious, so I’m following orders.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“I got the same message from Heaven, but it still seems unwise.”</p></div><div><p>“Listen, if Heaven is telling you to go home, then Gabriel probably has some miracle set up to protect Harry until you’re back, yeah? Old Gabe wouldn’t leave Heaven’s greatest human asset without protection, especially if the asset’s important enough to glue you to him for seven years.”</p></div><div><p>“Well... yes, I suppose. What will you do?”</p></div><div><p>“At home? Be miserable as usual. You?”</p></div><div><p>“Oh dear. Well, I won’t be miserable, unfortunately.”</p></div><div><p>“Unfortunately?”</p></div><div><p>“I don’t like to think of you miserable ALONE, Crowley.”</p></div><div><p>“Misery loves company, you mean.”</p></div><div><p>“NO, I GENUINELY wish I could be there with you.”</p></div><div><p>“Thanks, angel.”</p></div><div><p>“No thanks needed, my dear! At least Ron will be staying with Harry, as Ron’s family is away.”</p></div><div><p>“What, without him?? How kind.”</p></div><div><p>“I suppose that it’s a longer holiday than the amount of school days Ron would be allowed to take off.”</p></div><div><p>“Still not very nice.”</p></div><div><p>“Mm.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>“Zira! Zira!” cried Luna Lovegood, throwing herself into Aziraphale’s arms.</p></div><div><p>“Hello, hello, my dear!” cried Aziraphale, beaming and hugging his sister tightly. “And how have you been?”</p></div><div><p>“Wonderful! Daddy and have been looking out for Nargles and we found a— a— Snargaluff in the GARDEN!!” cried Luna breathlessly.</p></div><div><p>“Busy, busy!” said Aziraphale cheerfully.</p></div><div><p>“Aziraphale!” said Xenophilius Lovegood warmly, spreading his arms to his son like some sort of scraggly eagle. “How is school?”</p></div><div><p>“Oh, VERY good, Father!” answered Aziraphale, also hugging his father, “And, erm, Happy Christmas!”</p></div><div><p>“Happy Christmas!” said Xenophilius and Luna.</p></div><div><p>Despite its oddities, Aziraphale was happy to again see the rook-shaped house that the Lovegoods called home. He climbed its spiral staircase to the very top, where his room was— closest to Heaven. Unlike the rest of the house, Aziraphale’s room was very well kept, everything neat and in its place. With a flick of his wand, the dust covering everything disappeared. Aziraphale set his trunk of belongings on his bed and sat down. The room was reminiscent of the 1950’s, and smelled heavily of old books— that was because the room WAS mainly filled with old books. That was definitely Aziraphale’s favorite smell.</p></div><div><p>Luna entered the room.</p></div><div><p>“Dinner’s ready! And guess what we’re having!” she said cheerfully.</p></div><div><p>“What, my dear?” asked Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Your favorite!” cried Luna. Despite being celestial, Aziraphale suddenly felt hungry.</p></div><div><p>“Sushi!” he said voraciously.</p></div><div><p>“I made it myself,” said Luna.</p></div><div><p>“Did you really? This shall be a most special Christmas dinner!” said Aziraphale proudly. He was secretly questioning Luna’s ability to make something edible out of sushi components. However, he felt that anything akin to sushi would be better than the tea his father Xenophilius made out of Gurdyroots. At dinner, Xenophilius inquired more into Aziraphale’s school experiences.</p></div><div><p>“Aziraphale, what are your favorite classes?”</p></div><div><p>“Ah, well, I like all of them! All of the new knowledge...” replied Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Ah, you are a true Ravenclaw, my son, like your mother and I.” said Xenophilius proudly.</p></div><div><p>“I hope I’m in Ravenclaw! Although Gryffindor or Hufflepuff would be all right too.” said Luna.</p></div><div><p>“I’m sure you will be in Ravenclaw, Luna, but even if you aren’t, you must know that there’s nothing wrong with ANY of the houses, not even Slytherin.” said Aziraphale wisely.</p></div><div><p>“I know, it’s not that I think Slytherin ITSELF is bad, it’s just I shouldn’t like to be in that House when so many people in it aren’t nice.” explained Luna.</p></div><div><p>“To the contrary, my dear, some Slytherins are very nice.” said Aziraphale. He could hear Crowley hissing in his ear: “I’m a DEMON, I’m not NICE!”</p></div><div><p>“In fact,” continued Aziraphale, ignoring the imaginary devil on his shoulder who was still pouting, “my best friend is a Slytherin.”</p></div><div><p>“Really?” said Xenophilius.</p></div><div><p>“What’s their name?” asked Luna.</p></div><div><p>“Anthony Crowley.” answered Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Crowley... Crowley... isn’t that Mrs. Crouch’s, wife of Bartemius Crouch of the Ministry of Magic, maiden name?” asked Xenophilius.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, well, you see, Anthony’s given name is Bartemius Anthony Crouch jr.” explained Aziraphale, blushing.</p></div><div><p>“It’s nice to see that you’re not showing any animosity toward the Slytherins for their unfortunate association to You-Know-Who, but keep your wits about you, Aziraphale, my son, for even if young Crouch shows no Death Eater tendencies because of his family’s strong anti-Dark status, he may still be a bad influence given his father— he may try to brainwash you into believing everything the Ministry says!” said Xenophilius.</p></div><div><p>“I assure you, Anthony has no tendencies towards the Dark, nor the Ministry.” said Aziraphale, trying to ignore the irony of the first part of his sentence.</p></div><div><p>“Maybe Anthony Crowley could come to visit, Daddy,” suggested Luna to her father. Aziraphale blushed— he could already see Crowley grinning his goofy grin, and saying, “THIS is where you LIVE, angel?”</p></div><div><p>That night, as Luna climbed into bed, she said,</p></div><div><p>“Could you read me more of that muggle story we started before you left for school? I want to hear more of it, but Daddy only reads me <em>The Tales of Beedle and Bard</em>.” By “that muggle story”, Luna meant the Bible. Now when it came to bibles, Aziraphale had quite the collection. He collected every version of every Bible he could get his hands on, and he had been reading Luna his favorite of the most rare ones— he’d been editor of this version himself.</p></div><div><p>“Of course, my dear!” Aziraphale took the bible from one of his many shelves and, sitting down in a chair next to Luna’s bed, opened it. “Where were we?” he asked. “Ah yes, ‘<b>AND</b> the Lord spake unto the Angel that guarded the eastern gate saying Where is the flaming sword which was given unto thee?</p></div><div><p><b>26</b> And the Angel said, I had it here only a moment ago, I must have put it down somewhere, forget my own head next.</p></div><div><p><b>27</b> And the Lord did not ask him again.’”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>“Barty! Barty! Oh, my darling boy!” cried Mrs. Crouch, grabbing Crowley into a tight hug. She took off his sunglasses and covered his face and mop of dark red hair with kisses.</p></div><div><p>“Hi, hi, Mum, hi!” said Crowley, smiling and hugging her tightly back.</p></div><div><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, you prefer Anthony now, don’t you?” asked Mrs. Crouch, holding her son at arms length and looking him over.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah, I do, Mum, but that’s all right.” answered Crowley. “And, erm, Happy Christmas!”</p></div><div><p>“Happy Christmas, sweetheart.” Mrs. Crouch let go of Crowley. “Bartemius! Bartemius! Anthony’s home, for Christmas!” she called up their staircase to her husband. There was no answer. Mrs. Crouch turned back to Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Come, sweetie, he must not be able to hear us. Let’s go into the kitchen for a moment, and then we’ll go see him.”</p></div><div><p>“Okay, Mum.” said Crowley with a smile. He followed his mother into the kitchen. “Winky!” he cried happily.</p></div><div><p>The Crouch’s house-elf looked up from making dinner.</p></div><div><p>“Ohhhh! Young Master Barty is home! Home for Christmas! Oh, Winky is so happy, Winky is!” the elf cried.</p></div><div><p>“Ah, come here!” cried Crowley, throwing his arms open for the elf. The elf jumped down from the stool on which she was perched and threw herself into Crowley’s hug.</p></div><div><p>“Oh, Young Master Barty is so kind to poor old Winky, Young Master Barty is!” cried Winky.</p></div><div><p>“He prefers to be called Anthony, Winky.” said Mrs. Crouch gently.</p></div><div><p>“Oh, Winky is sorry, so sorry, calling Master Anthony the wrong name!” cried Winky, now upset.</p></div><div><p>“Ah, it doesn’t matter what you call me, I’m not angry.” assured Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Master Anthony is so understanding of poor old Winky, he is so nice.” said Winky with a smile.</p></div><div><p>“Understanding maybe, but I wouldn’t call myself nice.” replied Crowley with a smirk. He couldn’t help but think, what if Winky and his mother knew what he really was? Hopefully they’d never have to know... He could hear Aziraphale saying in his ear: “You know, I’ve always thought that deep down, you’re really very nice.”...</p></div><div><p>“Don’t talk nonsense! Let’s go see your father, Anthony.” said Mrs. Crouch. Crowley nodded and, ignoring the imaginary angel on his shoulder who had just put him into Checkmate, put Winky back on her stool. He grabbed a piece of food off of her cutting board and popped it into his mouth.</p></div><div><p>“Oh, Master Anthony is a naughty boy, stealing food Winky is trying to make his dinner with!” scolded Winky— but she was smiling.</p></div><div><p>“Come along, you silly boy!” said Crowley’s mother with a laugh.</p></div><div><p>“Ciao, Winky!” called Crowley, waving as he left the room. He followed his mother up the stairs and down the hallway. There, Mrs. Crouch knocked on the door of Mr. Crouch’s office.</p></div><div><p>“Bartemius? Barty, dear?”</p></div><div><p>“Come in,” said Crouch in a expressionless voice. Mrs. Crouch and Crowley entered.</p></div><div><p>“I’ve been calling you, Barty, didn’t you hear me?” asked Mrs. Crouch.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, dear, I heard, but I told you not to shout up to me, especially when I’m working.” answered Crouch, not looking up from the papers on his desk. “But sit down.”</p></div><div><p>Mrs. Crouch and Crowley sat down in the chairs opposite Crouch— it was more the set up of a job interview than a family enjoying each other’s company.</p></div><div><p>“Is dinner almost ready, dear?” asked Crouch, glancing up briefly at his wife.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, Winky is almost done.” answered Mrs. Crouch. More silence.</p></div><div><p>“Hello, father.” Crowley ventured at last.</p></div><div><p>“Bartemius,” returned Crouch, not looking up.</p></div><div><p>“He prefers to be called Anthony, dear.” said Mrs. Crouch.</p></div><div><p>“Well, I NAMED him Bartemius.” replied Crouch, throwing his wife a playful smirk.</p></div><div><p>“Aren’t you going to ask him about school?” inquired Mrs. Crouch, bit a forcefully.</p></div><div><p>“All right, tell me about school, Bartemius.” said Crouch, once again not looking up.</p></div><div><p>“Well it’s... school, really, I mean... it’s not like it’s HARD.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“I look forward to seeing your good marks at the end of the school year, then,” replied Crouch.</p></div><div><p>“Are you enjoying yourself, dear? Do you like your classes, your teachers?” asked Mrs. Crouch of her son, throwing her husband a scathing look that he didn’t see.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah they’re all just fine. Like I said, no sweat.” answered Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Have you any friends?” asked Mrs. Crouch.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah, one really good one, and three all right ones.” replied Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“What are their names? What are they like?” asked Mrs. Crouch.</p></div><div><p>“Well, my best friend is Aziraphale Lovegood. He’s a Ravenclaw. Our other friends are Gryffindors: Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley, and Harry Potter.” said Crowley. At last, his father looked at him.</p></div><div><p>“Harry Potter? THE Harry Potter?” he asked incredulously.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, THE Harry Potter! Who do you think I mean, Harry Potter the aardvark?” asked Crowley annoyedly.</p></div><div><p>“I just like to be sure, Bartemius. Friends with Harry Potter... well, that’s very good, very good. Yes, don’t waste you time on the Lovegood boy, they’re a rather nutty bunch, the Lovegoods. Potter, yes... The Ministry will like that.” said Crouch.</p></div><div><p>“I’d thank you not to tell me who to be friends with.” said Crowley horribly.</p></div><div><p>“And I’d thank you to remember your manners, young man!” barked Crouch. “Now get out of here, I’m busy!”</p></div><div><p>“As you wish.” said Crowley coolly. He strode to the door, but then turned on his heel.</p></div><div><p>“For your information, SIR, Aziraphale Lovegood isn’t the slightest bit nutty, despite whatever his family may be. In fact, I’d venture to say he’s saner and more brilliant than anyone I’ve ever known.” With that, Crowley left the room.</p></div><div><p>“Impudent boy,” muttered Crouch.</p></div><div><p>“Really, Bartemius, you needn’t treat him that way! He’s just a child, and you don’t even look him!” cried Mrs. Crouch.</p></div><div><p>“That’s because I am BUSY. Who do you think I do all this work for? I’m trying to make our lives better!” barked Crouch.</p></div><div><p>“By time you’ve gotten where you want to be, he’ll be grown up and out of your reach forever, Barty, don’t you realize that?” asked Mrs. Crouch desperately.</p></div><div><p>“Go and check on the elf and our dinner, won’t you, dear?” asked Crouch.</p></div><div><p>“As you wish.” said Mrs. Crouch, and left.</p></div><div><p>Crowley had taken refuge in his bedroom, where he lay, dramatically flung, across its expanse. His room was modern, sleek, relatively minimalist, and mostly composed of shades, not colors. The only truly colorful things were his bright green plants. The plants were the most luxurious, verdant, and beautiful in London... but they were also the most terrified. He had heard about talking to plants on the radio once and thought it was an excellent idea. Although talking is perhaps the wrong word for what Crowley did. What he did was put the fear of God into them. More precisely, the fear of Crowley. In addition to which, every couple of months Crowley would pick out a plant that was growing too slowly, or succumbing to leaf-wilt or browning, or just didn't look quite as good as the others, and he would carry it around to all the other plants. "Say goodbye to your friend," he'd say to them. "He just couldn't cut it..."</p></div><div><p>Then he would leave the room with the offending plant, and return an hour or so later with a large, empty flower pot, which he would leave somewhere conspicuously around the room. He now lay gazing at said plants, looking for just such a victim. The plants really ought to have learned by now that he often vanished one of them after a fight with Crouch sr, but as plants are incapable of thought, they did no such thing. Mrs. Crouch, however, DID notice, and often rescued Crowley’s abandoned plants by planting them in the back garden— they never did look as nice as when they were in her son’s room, unfortunately. Mrs. Crouch never scolded her son for his plant cruelty, because she thought it was infinitely better that he should take out his hatred on unthinking, unfeeling, UNKNOWING plants (or so she thought— she often swore she saw them shivering in Crowley’s presence) than on any PERSON, which for all of her husband’s valiance, she sadly found he did. And somewhere, deep down, she was worried that her son was capable of so much more than his father, in good or in evil. She hoped she’d never see the day that it was the latter.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><h2>Chapter* Five: Smoke and Mirrors</h2></div><div><p>
      <b>*A Rather Long and Final Chapter Indeed</b>
    </p></div><div><p>The Christmas holidays were over, and Harry and Ron had been waiting at the castle doors for the missing three members of their clan, who were now coming up the castle’s front steps.</p></div><div><p>“Hermione! Anthony! Aziraphale! How were your holidays? We’ve got ALL SORTS to tell you!” exclaimed Harry, greeting his friends.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah, you’ll NEVER GUESS what Harry found, OR what he got for Christmas!” exclaimed Ron with equal enthusiasm.</p></div><div><p>“My holidays were great, thanks!” said Hermione cheerfully.</p></div><div><p>“Mine were delightful, thank you, my dears!” said Aziraphale, equally as cheerfully. Crowley, however, remained silent, hoping Harry and Ron wouldn’t notice that he didn’t answer— but they did notice.</p></div><div><p>“Dismal, was it? Annoying relatives visiting or something?” asked Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Dismal, dark, and the usual, unwanted, resident relatives.” answered Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Ohhhh, you must mean the Crouch! Boring, is he?” said Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Let’s just say our relationship is less than satisfactory,” replied Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Hey, at least you’ve got a dad— I’d give anything to know mine, even if he wasn’t so great. At least yours is alive,” said Harry, hoping to make Crowley rethink the dislike of his father.</p></div><div><p>“My father alive, a good thing? I wouldn’t be so sure,” replied Crowley darkly.</p></div><div><p>“Crowley! Surely, you can’t mean you wish your own father dead?” said Aziraphale, horrified.</p></div><div><p>“Look, Angel, if you’re going to judge me —“ began Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Now, I am not JUDGING,” assured Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“— then we can switch places next Christmas, and you can see how YOU like him!” finished Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“What, using Polyjuice Potion?” asked Hermione suspiciously. Crowley shrugged.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah.”</p></div><div><p>Of course, this was not at all what Crowley intended to use. In fact, he didn’t intend to USE anything— he and Aziraphale were perfectly capable of switching bodies, if they were so inclined.</p></div><div><p>“But its against the rules for students to make Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts, unless directed to do so by a teacher!” said Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“Sometimes rules are just BEGGING to be broken.” replied Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“I suppose you’ve always been a rule-breaker?” said Hermione, raising one of her eyebrows disapprovingly.</p></div><div><p>“Yep, rule-breaker, that’s me! Sauntering vaguely downwards with the rest of the scum of the Earth.” replied Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“You needn’t be so dramatic.” said Aziraphale reproachfully.</p></div><div><p>“AN-Y-WAY,” said Ron, “HARRY has something to TELL you, REMEMBER?”</p></div><div><p>“Oh, yes, do tell us of your adventures, Harry!” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>And so Harry told them all about the Invisibility Cloak he’d gotten for Christmas that had once belonged to his dad, and of meeting Professor Dumbledore, and of the Mirror of Erised, that showed you the deepest desire of your heart.</p></div><div><p>“I won’t ever going looking for that mirror again,” said Harry, “because Dumbledore was right— it’ll drive you mad.”</p></div><div><p>“Yes, that’s very wise of you, Harry.” said Aziraphale. “And speaking of being careful, you must keep a close eye on Professor Quirrell!”</p></div><div><p>“Why?” asked Ron, raising an eyebrow.</p></div><div><p>“He’s the one who was hexing Harry’s broom.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“No, it was Snape!” said the three Gryffindors in unison.</p></div><div><p>“I swear to you, it was Quirrell!” said Aziraphale firmly.</p></div><div><p>“I saw him, the way he acted when you didn’t crash...” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Well, Ron and I SAW Snape hexing the broom!” cried Hermione frustratedly— she’d certain changed her tune when it came to their resident Potions Master.</p></div><div><p>“Are you sure that wasn’t the countercurse?” asked Crowley, his eyes sparkling with recently engaged genius.</p></div><div><p>“Yes,” said Aziraphale, Crowley’s thoughts dawning in his own mind, “Are you sure what you saw wasn’t Snape trying to SAVE Harry, not kill him?”</p></div><div><p>“Well... well, I suppose we can’t be SURE...” admitted Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“But that means YOU can’t be sure either!” said Ron to the celestial duo.</p></div><div><p>“I guess we’ll just have to keep a close eye on both Quirrell AND Snape, then.” concluded Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Did you boys find out who Nicolas Flamel was?” asked Hermione of Harry and Ron.</p></div><div><p>“What’s this?” asked the celestial duo in unison.</p></div><div><p>“Argh, Harry, we forgot tell them before the left!” cried Ron, facepalming.</p></div><div><p>“Before you left for Christmas, Hagrid let slip to us that whatever is under the trapdoor is between him, Dumbledore, and <em>Nicolas Flamel!</em>” explained Harry to the celestial duo.</p></div><div><p>“Oh, well, I can help you there.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“You mean YOU know you Nicolas Flamel is?” asked Hermione disbelievingly.</p></div><div><p>“Well, yes. I saw his name on one of those chocolate frog cards when I was on the train here for the first time.” answered Aziraphale meekly. Crowley smiled at the angel— the perfect memory of celestial beings was certainly useful! Harry, on the other hand, slapped his forehead in frustration.</p></div><div><p>“ARGH I KNEW I saw the name SOMEWHERE! It WAS on one of the cards! Do remember what it said, Aziraphale?”</p></div><div><p>“Erm, yes, it was on, ermmmmmmm Dumbledore’s card! Yes, that was it. It said that Nicolas Flamel had been Dumbledore’s alchemy partner.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“ALCHEMY!” cried Hermione, the light of an epiphany dawning in her eyes. “Come on, I think I know where to look!” With that, Hermione ran off to Gryffindor Tower, with the four boys at her heels. Once there, she pushed a book towards them, and the four boys read:</p></div><div><p>
      <em>The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Philosopher’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.</em>
    </p></div><div><p>
      <em>There have been many reports of the Philosopher’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera-lover. Mr Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).</em>
    </p></div><div><p>“See?” said Hermione, when the boys had finished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s Philosopher’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it. That’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”</p></div><div><p>“A stone that makes gold and stops you ever dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.”</p></div><div><p>Aziraphale and Crowley looked at each other guiltily, for they could live forever WITHOUT the aid of a Stone. Crowley voiced what both he and the angel were really thinking,</p></div><div><p>“‘To be, or not to be, that is the question:</p></div><div><p>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p></div><div><p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p></div><div><p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles</p></div><div><p>And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,</p></div><div><p>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</p></div><div><p>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</p></div><div><p>That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation</p></div><div><p>Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;</p></div><div><p>To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:</p></div><div><p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</p></div><div><p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p></div><div><p>Must give us pause—there's the respect</p></div><div><p>That makes calamity of so long life.</p></div><div><p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p></div><div><p>Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</p></div><div><p>The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,</p></div><div><p>The insolence of office, and the spurns</p></div><div><p>That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,</p></div><div><p>When he himself might his quietus make</p></div><div><p>With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,</p></div><div><p>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</p></div><div><p>But that the dread of something after death,</p></div><div><p>The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn</p></div><div><p>No traveller returns, puzzles the will,</p></div><div><p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</p></div><div><p>Than fly to others that we know not of?</p></div><div><p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</p></div><div><p>And thus the native hue of resolution</p></div><div><p>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,</p></div><div><p>And enterprises of great pitch and moment</p></div><div><p>With this regard their currents turn awry</p></div><div><p>And lose the name of action.’”</p></div><div><p>“What?” said Ron.</p></div><div><p>“That’s Shakespeare’s Hamlet.” explained Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“What’s Shakespeare Hamlet?” asked Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Shakespeare was a muggle poet, and Hamlet is one of his plays.” explained Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Sounds more like a bunch of gibberish than words to me,” said Ron. “What does it mean?”</p></div><div><p>“It’s a contemplation of suicide.” said Aziraphale delicately. “Prince Hamlet of Denmark tries to decide whether to be or not to be. Although Crowley is quoting it in contemplation of the motives for taking the Philosopher’s Stone.”</p></div><div><p>“Oh.” said Ron, still working it out. “Someone needs to tell that Hamlet fellow to buck up!”</p></div><div><p>That night, after the Gryffindors and celestial duo had parted ways, Aziraphale and Crowley sat in their usual corridor windowsills together.</p></div><div><p>“Sometimes I really wonder about that.” said Crowley suddenly.</p></div><div><p>“About what?” asked Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Death.” said Crowley bluntly.</p></div><div><p>“In what way? We know what comes after.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“We only know what happens after human death. What about animals? Does the consciousness of an animal go anywhere after it dies? Or does it just STOP, like sleep without dreaming. Or, what I really wonder about, is what happens to US when we die. And I mean DIE, not discorporate. Especially since you and I... Well, what if They caught us? What would happen to us...”</p></div><div><p>“I haven’t the faintest idea what happens after beings like us die, I’m afraid— only the Almighty has that knowledge. But I think... I KNOW it will have been better to have been friends with you for a mere 6,000 years and to die, to sleep forever without dreaming, than to live for eternity and not have been friends.”</p></div><div><p>“Thank you, angel, I feel the same way. After all, who would really want to live forever anyway? For eternity. I mean, eternity is a LONG time! Eventually everything has to end, that’s science! And then what? Just... empty darkness.”</p></div><div><p>“Well, the Almighty has always been rather ambiguous when it comes to science, so I doubt She’d play by its rules. She made everything, after all.”</p></div><div><p>“Ah, but did you ever wonder who made God?”</p></div><div><p>“I’m sorry, what?”</p></div><div><p>“Did- you- ever- wonder- who- made- God?”</p></div><div><p>“...The Almighty has always existed...”</p></div><div><p>“Always? Forever? For eternity? Like I said, that’s a LONG time... I mean, how FAR is forever? If the universe goes forever, how far is that? And when it ends, what is beyond that, and how far does THAT go? Or is eternity a loop that plays over and overandoverandoverandoverandoverandover and over again?! And if so, who made that loop? And what’s beyond the loop? More loops? And where are the loops? And if God is part of our loop, who, what, made the loops? What happens within and without of those loops of multiverse?”</p></div><div><p>“Crowley, STOP, you’re going to make my head EXPLODE!! For goodness, sake it’s— it’s INEFFABLE!!”</p></div><div><p>“Is it? Or is it all just smoke and mirrors?”</p></div><div><p>“I certainly HOPE it’s all the just smoke and mirrors, Crowley; I hope it’s incredibly, wonderfully, painfully, stupidly simple.”</p></div><div><p>“Yeah... so do I, angel, so do I.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Soon the next Quidditch match was upon them... with Snape as referee. Despite his fear that Snape (“<em>Quirrell—!</em>” insisted Crowley) may try something unsavory again, Harry played— and won. Needless to say, every Gryffindor rejoiced in the victory, and in being ahead of Slytherin in the lead for that year’s House Cup. Aziraphale and Crowley, despite their blatant disinterest, were happy too— Quirrell hadn’t tried anything, and Harry had done something he was proud of.</p></div><div><p>“I feel like a bit of a traitor, being happy that Gryffindor won instead of Slytherin.” said Crowley to Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Well, you’ve always been rather something of a traitor, haven’t you? When you were an angel, you became a demon. Once you were a demon, you befriended an angel.” said Aziraphale playfully— or at least as playfully as a literal person such as Aziraphale could be.</p></div><div><p>“I didn’t mean to Fall, I just hung out with the wrong people.” said Crowley quietly. Aziraphale stared at him, but Crowley didn’t notice. That was just as well, however, for Crowley wouldn’t have been able to decipher the look— as a matter of fact, Aziraphale couldn’t even form a reply: both the look on the angel’s face and the angel’s feeling were ineffable. Just then, Harry came up to them.</p></div><div><p>“You were wrong about Snape.” he said bluntly.</p></div><div><p>“What, have you got new evidence, Lewis?” asked Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Lewis?” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Ah, it’s a muggle detective thing.” explained Crowley, dismissing it with a wave of his hand.</p></div><div><p>“Oh. I never really paid much attention to that stuff. But yeah, new evidence— I heard Snape threatening Quirrell.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“What said he say, Harry?” asked Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Well, I couldn’t hear everything, but he asked Quirrell if Quirrell found out how to get past the dog, and said something about Quirrell’s little bit of hocus pocus, and about not wanting him as an enemy and thinking about where Quirrell’s loyalties lie.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“So you think Snape is bullying Quirrell into helping him get the Stone?” asked Crowley, unconvinced.</p></div><div><p>“What else?” asked Harry.</p></div><div><p>“It’s true it sounds bad for Professor Snape, but you neither heard nor saw everything that happened, so I wouldn’t jump to conclusions.” said Aziraphale wisely.</p></div><div><p>“But don’t you see, we HAVE to!” cried Harry, “If the Stone is only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape—“</p></div><div><p>“The Stone will be gone by next Tuesday.” said Ron, who had just appeared along with Hermione. Aziraphale and Crowley looked each other, silently admitting that Quirrell HAD never seemed the strongest willed of characters.</p></div><div><p>In the weeks that followed, however, nothing much about Quirrell, Snape, or the three-headed dog, which thanks to Hagrid’s inevitable slip-ups, they learned was named Fluffy. As inevitable slip-ups would have it, Hagrid would often provide them with much needed secret information, and there was such a happenstance sometime after the Easter holidays, on the first really fine day they’d had in months, with a feeling in the air of summer coming...</p></div><div><p>“Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?” asked Ron. The group was in the library, studying for exams. Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back, and looking very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.</p></div><div><p>“Jus’ lookin’,” he said in a shifty voice that got the group’s attention immediately. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He looked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still lookin’ fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”</p></div><div><p>Aziraphale blushed, which caught Hagrid’s eye.</p></div><div><p>“You know somethin’, Aziraphale, I can see that!” said the game-keeper.</p></div><div><p>“Well, I figured out who Flamel was quite a long time ago, I’m afraid.” admitted the angel.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah, and we know that that dog is guarding the Philosopher’s Stone.” said Crowley in a whisper— but it sounded more like a hiss.</p></div><div><p>“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said Harry, “about whats guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy—“</p></div><div><p>“SHHHH!” said Hagrid, worried someone would hear, “Listen — come an’ see me later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ s’pposed to know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh—“</p></div><div><p>“See you let, then,” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>Hagrid shuffled off.</p></div><div><p>“What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione thoughtfully.</p></div><div><p>“A book about dragons.” said Aziraphale flatly, without thinking. Then, realizing what he’d done, he blushed. “Sorry.”</p></div><div><p>“The intelligence just forces itself on you and out of you, eh?” asked Ron.</p></div><div><p>“I really AM sorry,” said Aziraphale, “I didn’t MEAN to —“</p></div><div><p>“He’s teasing you, angel.” said Crowley, often having to explain jokes and sarcasm to his friend.</p></div><div><p>“Oh. See? I’m not smart in all aspects.” said Aziraphale. “But I do happen to know this library rather TOO well, and know that was the section concerning dragons.”</p></div><div><p>“Getting ready for your future bookshop?” asked Hermione with a smile.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, I suppose.” replied Aziraphale, smiling back.</p></div><div><p>“Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“But it’s against our laws!” said Ron, who then explained the Ministry’s laws concerning dragons.</p></div><div><p>“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>“Do you think we should go to Hagrid’s with them?” asked Aziraphale of Crowley later that day.</p></div><div><p>“Nahhhhh, the kids won’t be in danger there, and Hagrid’s house is tiiiiiiny! Best not to squish them when they can just tell us what happened when they get back.” replied Crowley. “Besides, it gives you and I a break.”</p></div><div><p>“Break? We’re celestial beings, we weren’t made to get breaks!”</p></div><div><p>“Tell me you don’t like it when it’s just you and I, like the old days.”</p></div><div><p>“Well I DO, but...”</p></div><div><p>“Oh COME ON, angel! We don’t need to dog the kids every second we can. They’ll be FINE!”</p></div><div><p>“Yes, but what if they AREN’T, Crowley? Of course I like it when it’s just you and I— it‘s been like that ever since the beginning! — but if anything happens to those children when I’M supposed to be looking after them... I’ll never forgive myself.”</p></div><div><p>“Aziraphale, nothing is going to happen to them at Hagrid’s!”</p></div><div><p>“I know, I know, it’s just— well, between the dog, and the broom hexing, I’m worried every moment that— that— well, we both know the Dragon is around every corner!”</p></div><div><p>“I’m the only ‘dragon’ around here, angel.”</p></div><div><p>“Are you sure about that?”</p></div><div><p>“Positive.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>“A DRAGON? Hagrid’s got a DRAGON??” cried Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Shhhh!” said the Gryffindors.</p></div><div><p>“Well, it’s not the dragon you meant, angel, but it’s a dragon all the same!” exclaimed Crowley, doubling over with laughter.</p></div><div><p>“I don’t understand.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“None of us do.” added Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“Aziraphale said he’s worried the Dragon is waiting for you around every corner.” explained Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Who’s the dragon?” asked Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Satan.” said Aziraphale bluntly. “By which I MEAN, I’m worried that something BAD is waiting for you around every corner, not the actual Devil.”</p></div><div><p>“It’s just a dragon EGG for now, to clarify.” said Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“Still a dragon!” said the four boys.</p></div><div><p>“Did you learn anything GOOD?” asked Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Yes and no. We didn’t find out what else is guarding the Stone, but we found out who MADE the things that are guarding the Stones.” said Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“Who?” asked the celestial duo at once.</p></div><div><p>“Fluffy belongs to Hagrid, and the teachers did the enchantments; Flitwick, Sprout, McGonagall, Dumbledore, Snape, and Quirrell.” said Ron proudly, impressed with his own memory.</p></div><div><p>“Quirrell??” cried Aziraphale in horror. “AND Snape?? Oh dear, this really is a mess. No matter WHO the culprit is here, the Stone is NOT in a good position. SOMEONE is up to SOMETHING, and Dumbledore trusts all of them, and, for the most part, they each other! The Stone is easily taken.”</p></div><div><p>“Weeeeellllllll,” began Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“What?” said the others.</p></div><div><p>“We could always... steal it ourselves.” finished Crowley, his eyes alight with demonic pleasure.</p></div><div><p>“NO.” said Aziraphale firmly. “Absolutely not!”</p></div><div><p>“Angel, you do realize you’ve said that to EVERYTHING I’ve ever suggested we do, and later did it anyway?” said Crowley. Aziraphale scowled.</p></div><div><p>“No, this is different!”</p></div><div><p>“I agree with Zira, Tony, you’re totally mad!” said Ron.</p></div><div><p>“I agreed with Aziraphale.” said Hermione in a very McGonagall-like fashion.</p></div><div><p>“The Stone aside, right now we have other problems, such as Hagrid living in a WOODEN house with an ILLEGAL dragon!” said Harry.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>“Did you know about this?” asked Aziraphale frantically.</p></div><div><p>“Noooooooo.” replied Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, you did! I can SEE it your FACE, Crowley! You KNEW they were going to take that dragon to the top of that tower and you LET them! No one told ME! And now they’ve got DETENTION in the FORBIDDEN FOREST with FILCH, of ALL people!” The angel was fuming.</p></div><div><p>“Look, I KNOW you care about these kids but you’ve GOT to let them live a little!” retorted Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“I’m TRYING to make it so that they live a LOT! And letting them be ADVENTUROUS aside, WHAT do you think GABRIEL is going to say? Did you EVEN THINK about what it’s going to be like for me?”</p></div><div><p>“Say the wiles of the evil one got in the way! I mean, I did, didn’t I? And even if I hadn’t, everyone stretches the truth in memos to head office!”</p></div><div><p>“Oh, I suppose. But the THINGS I’ve heard are in that forest! And it’s not as if Filch exactly has any AFFECTION for children...”</p></div><div><p>“Let’s follow them then. We’ll get Harry’s invisibility cloak and go— it’s probably still at the top of the the tower.”</p></div><div><p>“And if someone sees us on the way to the tower? We won’t make it there before curfew.”</p></div><div><p>“We erase their memory, and suspend them until we’re out of sight.”</p></div><div><p>“Well... for the children, I’ll do it.”</p></div><div><p>“THERE’S my angel!”</p></div><div><p>“YOUR angel?” The angel raised an eyebrow.</p></div><div><p>“Well, ya know... my pal. The only angel I’ve got, and until recently the only friend. And it’s not as if anyone else would lay clam to you.” said Crowley awkwardly.</p></div><div><p>“I’m not a possession.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Oh for Satan’s sake you silly git, it was a— a—“ stuttered Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Term of endearment?” finished Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“I’m a demon, I don’t ENDEAR.” hissed Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Quite, in the same way you’re not nice. Now let’s go get that cloak before the children end up too far in the forest!” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>A rather interesting series of events had unfolded in the two weeks since the group first found out about Hagrid’s dragon egg. The dragon had hatched, and grew, and Draco Malfoy had found out about it. Subsequently, Ron had contacted his brother Charlie, a dragon trainer, hoping to find a way to get rid of Norbert the baby dragon. Charlie said some friends of his were coming to visit him and could take Norbert with them, but couldn’t be seen with an illegal dragon, which meant the kids would have to get Norbert to the top of the astronomy tower AT NIGHT. PAST CURFEW. The Gryffindors confided in Crowley, but knew better than to tell Aziraphale. Crowley, being a demon, after all, let them go, but they forgot the invisibility cloak at the top of the tower after handing over Norbert, and were caught by Filch. In what turned out to be something of a paradox, four Gryffindors ended up caught instead of three— Ron had been bitten by the dragon, and SHOULDN’T have been able to go, but thanks to Aziraphale sneaking a miracle, the wound got much better, and Ron went anyway. Malfoy was caught because he was trying to get the Gryffindors in trouble, and Neville was caught because he was trying to warn his friends about Malfoy. With the Gryffindors unable to hide their detentions for the simple fact that they left to have them, all of this resulted in a very grumpy principality Aziraphale indeed. So grumpy he was once again willing to break the rules. The celestial duo made their way to the tower without meeting anyone, and were convinced they’d gotten to the top of it scot-free when...</p></div><div><p>“Well, if it isn’t Aziraphale Lovegood and Anthony Crowley!”</p></div><div><p>It was Dumbledore, with his eyes twinkling, and Harry’s Cloak in his hand. Crowley raised his hand to erase Dumbledore’s memory, but something stopped him. The same thing had stopped Aziraphale too, for he hadn’t even raised a finger.</p></div><div><p>“H-hello, sir.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Hi.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“I presume you’re here because you made the same assumption I did, which was that our friend Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak was up at the top of this tower.” said Dumbledore.</p></div><div><p>“That’s correct, sir.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Yeah,” added Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“I don’t suppose you’re going to use it to follow the Gryffindors into the Forbidden Forest, are you?” said Dumbledore.</p></div><div><p>“Nahhhhhhh...” said Crowley. Unfortunately, Aziraphale spoke at the same moment saying,</p></div><div><p>“How did you know that sir?”</p></div><div><p>Crowley scowled at Aziraphale, who blushed. Dumbledore chuckled.</p></div><div><p>“Oh, I have my ways. Tell me, why exactly are you so keen to join yours friends in detention? I’ve never heard of a student purposely subjecting themselves to such an activity.”</p></div><div><p>Both Aziraphale and Crowley drew a blank, and remained silent. What excuse could they give? Dumbledore ignored the silence.</p></div><div><p>“It’s not usual that a student finds close companionship outside of their House, and it’s unheard of that a Slytherin should do so, and yet you two seemed inseparable from the moment you walked through the doors of Hogwarts— and I happen to know for a fact that the Lovegood and Crouch families have never socialized. But as I said, you two... well, you didn’t act like two students trying to get to know each other, you acted like you’ve always known each other. I wonder how that could be... A Ravenclaw, a Slytherin, and three Gryffindors— but you two, you show no interest in anyone beyond those three. You show particular interest in Harry. So much so that you’d sit through a Quidditch match for him, without showing any interest in the game otherwise. I have noticed your lack of interest in sports, you know.”</p></div><div><p>“I’m afraid I’ve rather missed your point, sir.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“I suppose I was hoping you could satisfy an old man’s curiosity.” replied Dumbledore.</p></div><div><p>“Aziraphale and I just hit it off in the train, that’s all, and Harry’s a fun person to be around.” answered Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“I’ve only ever known one other Slytherin student to be fond of a Gryffindor, and they knew each previous to school. I would think you’d be averse to Gryffindors, especially as close friends, even if only to avoid the criticism of your fellow Slytherins.” said Dumbledore.</p></div><div><p>“I’m a rebel, always have been, and have been subject to criticism my whole life.” answered Crowley. Dumbledore shrugged.</p></div><div><p>“All right, then.”</p></div><div><p>The three stared at each other, as if trying to remember something which they couldn’t quite put their finger on. For Aziraphale and Crowley, it was something in Dumbledore’s eyes, and that something was keeping them from erasing his memory. For Dumbledore, it was the children on a whole— especially the sense that they weren’t really children at all. They all knew these things to be impossible and yet could not dismiss them.</p></div><div><p>“Well, go on then— if you have reason to follow Harry, I shan’t stop you. I have the strangest feeling I couldn’t stop you if I tried. Besides, Hagrid is with them, and he’s rather easy to find.” said Dumbledore with a chuckle.</p></div><div><p>“Erm, all right, thank you, Professor.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Goodnight, Professor, thank you.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Goodnight,” said Dumbledore, handing them the Cloak, “and good luck!”</p></div><div><p>The celestial threw on the invisibility cloak and hurried down the tower and out of the castle. As they rushed across the green and down towards Hagrid’s hut, Aziraphale spoke at last.</p></div><div><p>“He knows something.”</p></div><div><p>“Obviously, angel.” replied Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“But how?! He hasn’t been present for any of our miracles. There’s SOMETHING about him, I have the funniest feeling...”</p></div><div><p>“That you’ve seen him before we became wizard children?”</p></div><div><p>“Yes! But only his eyes.”</p></div><div><p>“Me too, angel, and I think he recognized us too, somehow. Luckily, I don’t think he remembers either.”</p></div><div><p>The duo entered the forest, and hoped to hear the loud and bustling Hagrid, and locate him and the Gryffindors. They walked very fast, being celestial, and did what would take a human half an hour in five minutes. As such, they quickly found themselves in the middle of the forest. The wind whistled and the darkness sat forebodingly on their shoulders.</p></div><div><p>“It’s certainly not very pleasant here...” said Aziraphale nervously.</p></div><div><p>“I work in Hell, remember? This is a walk in the park by comparison, and besides, we’re invisible.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>Suddenly, they saw something bright white, gleaming on the ground, with silver liquid splashed all around and on it. They walked up to it.</p></div><div><p>“Why, Good Lord, it’s—“ began Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“A unicorn.” finished Crowley. “It’s dead.”</p></div><div><p>“I thought they all died in the Flood! A long time ago...”</p></div><div><p>“When the earth was green.”</p></div><div><p>“Really, Crowley, a music joke, now?”</p></div><div><p>“The Irish Rovers isn’t going to kill it if it’s already dead. Besides, you left it WIDDDDE open for me to make that joke. I also don’t feel the need to be respectful when I know, since no one is looking, you can just bring the damn thing back to life!”</p></div><div><p>“Oh, oh yes I can, can’t I? All right.”</p></div><div><p>Aziraphale was about to go and kneel down beside the unicorn when a hooded figure came crawling across the ground. The duo froze.</p></div><div><p>“Crowley, what is that?” asked Aziraphale shakily.</p></div><div><p>“Why the Heaven should I know?!” asked Crowley, just as horrified.</p></div><div><p>“Because whatever that is, it was clearly made by YOUR SIDE!” hissed Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“No, it’s... ugh!” cried Crowley. “That is just— HELL WOULD NOT EVEN DO THAT!” The cloaked figure had reached the unicorn, and was now drinking blood from its wound.</p></div><div><p>“Ohhhhh no, you don’t!” cried Aziraphale. He threw the Cloak off of Crowley and himself and marched towards the figure. The figure raised its head and looked right at Aziraphale— unicorn blood was running down it’s front.</p></div><div><p>“LET THERE BE LIGHT!” boomed Aziraphale. Suddenly, a bright light shone, the pure light of Heaven, and it beamed down heavily upon the figure. The figure howled in pain.</p></div><div><p>“That’s RIGHT! Get thee behind this ANGEL, you FOUL FIEND!” shouted Crowley enthusiastically at the figure, which shrunk away into the darkness.</p></div><div><p>Once they were sure the figure was gone, Crowley snapped his fingers, and the light disappeared. Aziraphale knelt beside the unicorn, and a moment later, it got up and galloped gracefully away.</p></div><div><p>“You know, Crowley, it really is so much fun when we work together.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“I didn’t do anything!” said Crowley, surprised.</p></div><div><p>“Well you, you know, showed your support, helped me scare that thing away. You’re not usually so... outspoken.” said Aziraphale, blushing. Crowley blushed too.</p></div><div><p>“Well I haven’t seen a living unicorn in thousands of years, and demon or no, I REALLY didn’t like the look of that THING feeding on it! Now let’s go find Harry before something like THAT finds him!”</p></div><div><p>The two put the Cloak back on and ran off, and little did they know that a moment later, Harry, Malfoy, and Hagrid’s dog, Fang, appeared in the same clearing.</p></div><div><p>“The trail of blood ends here,” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“That’s impossible!” snapped Malfoy.</p></div><div><p>“Really, Malfoy— look for yourself!” said Harry. Malfoy looked, and as much as he wanted to, he couldn’t deny that Harry was right.</p></div><div><p>“But... then where’s the unicorn? It can’t have just... vanished. I mean, there isn’t anything in this forest that can eat a unicorn WHOLE, is there?”</p></div><div><p>“No, there isn’t.” answered a new voice. It was a Centaur. “But there are other things in this forest that are far more dangerous than any creature that could.”</p></div><div><p>“Like what?” asked Harry.</p></div><div><p>And the Centaur told them what had been killing the unicorns: Voldemort.</p></div><div><p>The celestial duo eventually found Hagrid, who in turn found Harry, and they all exited the forest without anyone ever knowing that Crowley and Aziraphale had been there. Very very early the next morning, Aziraphale miracled the Gryffindor Tower door open, and snuck the invisibility cloak onto the foot of Harry’s bed as he slept. At breakfast, Harry didn’t even speak of the mysterious return of his cloak— he was too busy talking about his fear of the return of Voldemort. Hermione tried to comfort him by reminding him that the only person Voldemort ever feared was Dumbledore— Harry was safe while Dumbledore was around. But Harry wasn’t so sure...</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>The day of the final exam was over, and it was night. Aziraphale, Crowley, and the Gryffindors hadn’t seen each other all day, for they were all busy doing something at different times, and had never even bumped into each other in the hallway. Crowley was in the Slytherin common room, where he lay, dramatically flung, across one of its large green couches. The other Slytherins had gone to sleep, but he was waiting. He didn’t like what he was waiting for but he knew he couldn’t escape it, so it was better not to try to. He had his record player on, and Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody was going around and around...</p></div><div><p>
      <em>Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters... Too late... CROWLEY!</em>
    </p></div><div><p>Crowley gulped. There it was, what he’d been waiting for. Freddie Mercury was speaking to him.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, my lord?”</p></div><div><p>
      <em>THE DARK WIZARD VOLDEMORT RETURNS TONIGHT. YOU WILL OFFER YOURSELF TO HIM, FOR HE IS OUR VICTORY. DO NOT SPEAK TO HIM OF YOUR TRUE FORM, FOR TO HIM ALL THINGS CONNECTED TO PERSONS WITHOUT MAGIC ARE ABHORRENT, AND WIZARDS DO NOT BELIEVE IN CHRISTIANITY. DO NOT THINK THAT YOUR FORMER ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITH SAVE YOU FROM PUNISHMENT SHOULD YOU FAIL, FOR ALL WILL BE PUNISHED IF THE PLAN FAILS, INCLUDING YOU, CROWLEY. ESPECIALLY YOU...</em>
    </p></div><div><p>“Right, of course, no failing, my lord.” replied Crowley.</p></div><div><p>
      <em>...my time has come, sends shivers down my spine...</em>
    </p></div><div><p>And Satan was gone. Crowley sighed. He hated that, every time.</p></div><div><p>Suddenly, there was pounding on the stone door of the common door. Crowley got up and sauntered over. He opened it to see the three Gryffindors.</p></div><div><p>“Wha... why are YOU three here?” asked Crowley in surprise.</p></div><div><p>“Because we need someone who’s sauntering vaguely downwards with the rest of the scum of the Earth.” answered Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“In other words, we need someone who wants to steal the Stone.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“In other words, WE’RE STEALING IT.” said Ron.</p></div><div><p>“In other words, you think I’m a thief.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“No! Well, yes. But not really. We thought since YOU suggested stealing the Stone that you’d be better at it than us.” said Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“Or, at least, that you’d feel left out if we tried without you.” said Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Well if you’re recruiting me, then we’re recruiting Aziraphale— he’ll kill me otherwise.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>“Well if you’re recruiting me, then I’d better get a FULL explanation as to why on EARTH we’re doing this!” said Aziraphale, standing in the Ravenclaw common room doorway.</p></div><div><p>“Today we found out that the man who gave Hagrid the dragon egg got Hagrid drunk and got him to explain that playing music gets you past Fluffy, and that man was in a cloak, Hagrid never saw his face—“ said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“And McGonagall won’t listen to us—“ said Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“And DUMBLEDORE ISN’T HERE!” finished Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Voldemort can easily get to the Stone.” said Crowley solemnly.</p></div><div><p>“Oh, very well. To stop Voldemort.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“There’s one problem, though,” said Harry. “All five of use won’t fit under the invisibility cloak.”</p></div><div><p>“Aziraphale and I will risk being seen, you three take it.” said Crowley. Aziraphale nodded in agreement.</p></div><div><p>“All right, if you’re sure.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>As they made their way to the forbidden corridor, they met Peeves. Peeves couldn’t see the Gryffindors, but he COULD see the celestial duo.</p></div><div><p>“Ohhhh some wee student beasties, a-creeping past beddy-bye time. Should call Filch, I should...”</p></div><div><p>“You want to see a wee student beastie? You’ve got one!” said Crowley. And suddenly, he turned into a horrible, unspeakable creature, something almost snake-like, but with fangs, and gore andddddddd Peeves fell out of the air in shock, out cold.</p></div><div><p>“Well that was fun.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“I thought the maggots were a bit much.” said Aziraphale. “And you’ve made the children faint too— I heard them hitting the floor.”</p></div><div><p>“Well revive them then— it was so scary they won’t remember, and neither will Peeves.”</p></div><div><p>“Very well.”</p></div><div><p>Aziraphale woke up the children.</p></div><div><p>“What did we do, trip?” asked Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“Yes.” answered the angel.</p></div><div><p>“That was weird.” remarked Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Hey, whats with Peeves?” asked Harry, spotting the poltergeist on the floor.</p></div><div><p>“I guess he... fell asleep?” suggested Ron.</p></div><div><p>“I didn’t think ghosts slept.” said Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“Well, apparently they do. Allons-y, everyone, if we want to get that Stone!” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>A few seconds later, they were there, at Fluffy’s door— a door that stood ajar.</p></div><div><p>“Someone has already got past the dog,” said Crowley, indicating both the door and a harp lying at the dog’s feet. The dog growled menacingly.</p></div><div><p>“Hello, helly hellhound.”</p></div><div><p>“I’ve got a flute from Hagrid I can play.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Can you actually play it?” asked Aziraphale. “I’m not sure we can bewitch this monster with cacophony!”</p></div><div><p>“Well, sing, then.” said Harry with a shrug.</p></div><div><p>“Aziraphale? Hahaha, NO.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Why not? I’M the one who sung in a CHOIR after all.” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Because I don’t particularly want to hear Michael Row the Boat Ashore! And I sung in the choir too, if you care to REMEMBER.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“I WOULD NOT sing that!”</p></div><div><p>“Oh wouldn’t you?”</p></div><div><p>“Well it HAS got a nice melody, but—“</p></div><div><p>“SOMEONE do SOMETHING!” shouted Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“Just— BOTH of you sing something.” said Ron. Aziraphale and Crowley looked at each other, and burst into laughter.</p></div><div><p>“Oh my, what’s something we both would know?” asked Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Oh, I think I’ve got one.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“I don’t know Queen, if that’s what’s your thinking.”</p></div><div><p>“Well, there’s a DOG, also called a HOUND...”</p></div><div><p>“Oh you’re sly, aren’t you. All right!”</p></div><div><p>And suddenly there was a rousing chorus of Elvis’s Hound Dog, and the three-headed hound dog fell asleep. The Gryffindors took off the cloak and jumped through the trapdoor and into the darkness below, and the celestial duo followed, singing all the way. The singers lay laughing on the plants they landed in until they realized, quite suddenly, that the plant was curling around them all.</p></div><div><p>“What the DEVIL?” shrieked Aziraphale, beginning to get choked by the plant.</p></div><div><p>“Devil’s Snare! It’s Devil’s Snare!” cried Hermione. “Oh, but what kills it!”</p></div><div><p>“Fire, it’s killed by fire!” said Crowley— he’d been more keen in Herbology than anyone else. He turned his head away from the Gryffindors and licked his finger, and then dragged his finger across the plant’s vines. The plant recoiled as it’s whole mass caught fire, and everyone wriggled out of its grasp, and proceeded in the only way forward that there was. They soon found themselves in a large and very high ceiled chamber, the whole top of which was filled with what appeared to be jeweled birds, except...</p></div><div><p>“They’re keys!” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“What?” said Ron.</p></div><div><p>“Those birds, they’re not birds, they’re keys!” said Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Presumably for the door that gets us out of here,” said Hermione, pointing to the one and only door, just ahead of them.</p></div><div><p>“Well, I’ll just make sure it isn’t unlocked first.” said Crowley. He quickly sauntered to the door and tried the handle. The door opened.</p></div><div><p>“It’s unlocked!” he called. Of course, the door HAD been locked, but Crowley used a demonic miracle of his own, and opened it. He let the Gryffindors go through first, and held Aziraphale back.</p></div><div><p>“We need to talk, quickly, and without them.” Crowley said. Aziraphale nodded, and Crowley snapped his fingers, freezing the Gryffindors in their positions— staring at a larger than life size chess set.</p></div><div><p>“I didn’t tell them, but Voldemort is returning tonight. Returning to life.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“You mean... officially. This is information from Hell itself?” asked Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, I was... spoken to, shortly before the kids came to recruit me.”</p></div><div><p>“And?”</p></div><div><p>“Failure will result in punishment. I can’t fight with you, I have to fight against you.”</p></div><div><p>“I understand, but it will be the same for me. If Voldemort returns on my watch, Gabriel is going to be VERY upset.”</p></div><div><p>“If Voldemort doesn’t return, I’ll be tortured. I’m pretty sure Gabriel wouldn’t torture you.”</p></div><div><p>“Not over THIS, no, but you can forget the endless mercy thing, as surely you remember Gomorrah after the Almighty got angry. They don’t care for pain, really, but they don’t mind killing. Besides, I can’t just LET Voldemort come back, think of everyone he’ll kill...”</p></div><div><p>“So we have to be enemies tonight, but that’s something we can work out. I don’t know what to do about the kids, though. Each door we go through, Voldemort could be on the other side. We need to be US, not who they think we are, and they could get killed... and yet Voldemort may want Harry.”</p></div><div><p>“You’d GIVE Harry to him?!”</p></div><div><p>“Harry’s defeated him before, hasn’t he?”</p></div><div><p>“Yes, but... ohhhh dear...”</p></div><div><p>“Also, how do we protect US? Heaven and Hell think we’ve never met on Earth. If we reveal our knowledge of each other being celestial, there’s no telling what will happen. We can say the enemy thwarted us, but we can’t be honest in who.”</p></div><div><p>“Well, we never have been able to,”</p></div><div><p>“True... wait, I have an idea!”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Crowley and Aziraphale miracled their way past the giant chess set, over a beaten and unconscious troll, and into a room containing a table with a row of bottles of potions, leading the still entranced children along the way. As they crossed the potion room’s threshold, fire sprang up behind them in the doorway, and in the only doorway ahead. Crowley walked through the fire with ease, but quickly came back.</p></div><div><p>“This is when I leave you.” he said.</p></div><div><p>“Voldemort’s in the room beyond?” asked Aziraphale.</p></div><div><p>“No, Quirrell. But I can smell that something has changed... Voldemort will show, someway, somehow. Stick to the plan, wait until he gives me what I need.” said Crowley. Aziraphale nodded.</p></div><div><p>Crowley walked through the fire.</p></div><div><p>“Quirrell,” he said.</p></div><div><p>“Crouch,” returned Quirrell. “Not quite who I expected.”</p></div><div><p>“I suppose you expected Harry Potter.”</p></div><div><p>“Yes. I hoped he’d come, so I could kill him... with Dumbledore in London, it’s a much easier feat.”</p></div><div><p>“It WAS you that tried to kill during the Quidditch match.”</p></div><div><p>“Yes.”</p></div><div><p>“Potter and his friends believed it was Snape— but I saw you, I could read you...”</p></div><div><p>“Severus? Ha! Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell? Except you, it would seem. And I suppose you know that the only reason I haven’t killed you yet is because you’re a Slytherin. Slytherins are ever so fond of my master... perhaps you can be useful to me. Perhaps you can help me with this mirror.”</p></div><div><p>Quirrell was standing before a mirror, which Crowley realized was the same mirror Harry had spoken about: the Mirror of Erised.</p></div><div><p>“Yes... use the boy... use the boy. I suspect he is... different...” said a voice, quite unlike Quirrell’s, that seemed to be coming from Quirrell himself. Crowley broke in a grin.</p></div><div><p>“I KNEW you were here somewhere! Oh, yes, Lord Voldemort, I know you.”</p></div><div><p>“Master! He knows you!” cried Quirrell.</p></div><div><p>“I said... he... was... special... show... him... to me.” said Voldemort.</p></div><div><p>“Master, you are not strong enough!” cried Quirrell.</p></div><div><p>“I have strength enough... for this...” said Voldemort. Quirrell removed his turban, and turned his back to Crowley. Crowley gulped— there, on the back of Quirrell’s head, was another face. Voldemort’s face.</p></div><div><p>“My Lord Voldemort.” said Crowley, making a elegant half bow.</p></div><div><p>“I presume you are... Bartemius Crouch’s son...?” asked Voldemort.</p></div><div><p>“That is, unfortunately, correct.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“You say it is... unfortunate. You do not care for your father... and his ways?”</p></div><div><p>“I crave to kill my father as you killed yours, my lord. I wish only to follow in your footsteps, and to bring into completion your plan, to be a tool of your glorious destiny. I am at your disposal, make me your slave.”</p></div><div><p>“How would you prove yourself... to me...?”</p></div><div><p>“I will give you the Stone.”</p></div><div><p>“The Stone! Quirrell! Let the boy stand before the mirror!”</p></div><div><p>Quirrell stepped aside, and Crowley stood before the mirror. He stared very hard at it. His reflection suddenly winked at him, and held up the Stone. Then his reflection put the Stone in its pocket— and Crowley felt something heavy, the real Stone itself, plop into his real pocket. He took it out and showed it to Voldemort.</p></div><div><p>“Here it is,” said Crowley with a smirk.</p></div><div><p>“Ahhhhh, take it, Quirrell! This service is deserving... of a reward! What would you have...?”</p></div><div><p>“Only your mark, my lord.”</p></div><div><p>“The mark is... a great responsibility... and you are so young... perhaps too young. But I will not deny you... if you are sure...”</p></div><div><p>“I am sure, my lord.”</p></div><div><p>“Very well. Through Quirrell, I will give you my mark.”</p></div><div><p>Quirrell took the Stone. Then he took out his wand, and burned the Dark Mark into Crowley’s wrist. Crowley was now officially a Death Eater. Voldemort has given him want he needed.</p></div><div><p>Then suddenly, Aziraphale and the three Gryffindors entered the room, and spells began flying. Quirrell hid behind the mirror, and cast his spells from behind it.</p></div><div><p>“Kill them, kill them! But bring me Potter alive, he may be useful!” said Voldemort. Crowley cast many spells at his friends, but always missed on purpose.</p></div><div><p>“Avada Kedavra!” cried Quirrell.</p></div><div><p>“Let there be light!” whispered Aziraphale. The light of Heaven beamed down on Quirrell and he screamed in pain as it burnt him, but the killing curse hit Aziraphale in the chest. The angel collapsed, dead, and the light went out. Quirrell was not dead, but he was weak, too weak to do any magic. Staying out of Quirrell’s line of sight, Crowley made his way to Aziraphale, and took the angel in his arms.</p></div><div><p>“Oh, angel, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry— that BASTARD!” Crowley said, hugging Aziraphale to him. He looked up at Harry.</p></div><div><p>“Quirrell has the Stone.”</p></div><div><p>“I’ll get it.” said Harry.</p></div><div><p>Harry crossed over to Quirrell, and tried to get the Stone from his robe pockets.</p></div><div><p>“NO!” croaked Quirrell, grabbing Harry’s wrists. But as he did so, he screamed, and burned. He let go of Harry, but it was too late, and Quirrell’s eyes rolled back in his head. Harry was screaming too, his scar burning and his head splitting with pain. But then suddenly it stopped. He looked down at Quirrell.</p></div><div><p>“He’s dead,” said Harry, taking the Stone from Quirrell’s pocket. Something like a ghost left Quirrell’s body and went howling away— something that was Lord Voldemort. Crowley laid Aziraphale’s body down, and stood up.</p></div><div><p>“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” he said.</p></div><div><p>“What for?” asked a crying Hermione.</p></div><div><p>“This.” said Crowley, and he snapped his fingers. Suddenly, Harry collapsed unconscious beside Quirrell, and Hermione lay unconscious in the room of potions, and Ron lay unconscious in the messy shambles of a vicious larger than life size chess match. Ron would think he’d given himself as a chess piece in the match to let the others continue, Hermione would think she’d drank the wrong potion after solving the room’s riddle, and Harry would think he’d collapsed from trying to keep a grip on Quirrell. They’d remember very little of Crowley and Aziraphale, and certainly nothing significant.</p></div><div><p>Crowley suddenly decided that he wanted to sleep, and he didn’t care where. He laid down on the cold, hard, stone floor beside Aziraphale’s body, and fell asleep.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Crowley and Aziraphale were sitting beside Hogwarts’ lake. It had been three days.</p></div><div><p>“Well, we did it.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“Yes, we did, didn’t we?” said Aziraphale. “What did Hell say?”</p></div><div><p>“They were primed and ready to send me to Dagon, Master of Torments, when I told them Harry defeated Voldemort, Quirrell, and I, but then I showed them the Dark Mark to prove that I hadn’t failed entirely, and explained that Voldemort is still somewhat alive, so they let me off with a caution. What did Heaven say?”</p></div><div><p>“Gabriel wasn’t at ALL happy that Voldemort is still somewhat alive, but was pleased enough that Harry, under my protection, stalled his full return, and so they saw fit to resurrect me into my body— it wasn’t damaged physically so I didn’t need a new one.”</p></div><div><p>“Heads up, here comes trouble.” said Crowley.</p></div><div><p>Dumbledore had suddenly appeared beside them.</p></div><div><p>“Hello, gentlemen,” he said amiably.</p></div><div><p>“Hello, Professor!” greeted the boys.</p></div><div><p>“Mind if I join you?” asked Dumbledore.</p></div><div><p>“Please do, by all means!” said Aziraphale politely, gesturing to the ground beside them. Dumbledore sat down.</p></div><div><p>“I hope you’ll forgive me, but I’m about to be incredibly blunt, which I am usually not.” he said. “As you know from our meeting on the astronomy tower, I have thought you two to be anomalies, and have been trying to understand you. I had the sense that I knew you before Hogwarts, but dismissed that as impossible. I have done a great deal of thinking, however, and realized that it’s impossibly must not factor into it, for I have remembered where and when I knew you from. It was back in War World Two, when I was still young man, when the Wizarding World battled Gellert Grindelwald, and the muggles battled the Nazis. Preoccupied with Grindelwald as I was, I tried to make time to help the muggles in their fight against a similar tyranny, and so, one night, I found myself across the street from a church where information had told me an exchange between a British spy pretending to be a double agent and some high ranking Nazis was to take place. I watched as the Nazis went in. Then the spy. Then another spy, a true double agent. Then a very odd man indeed, who walked across the church grounds like one does when one is barefoot on the beach. I waited a while, and had just made up my mind to go in when I heard a bomb overhead. I Disapparted to where I knew was outside the blast radius, and then Apparated back right after it hit, hoping that, if anyone had been caught by the edges of the radius and were miraculously alive, I could help them. The church was just debris... but somehow the strange man and the British spy were alive. Alive, uninjured, and standing in the center of the radius, RIGHT where the bomb had hit. I thought they must be wizards too, presumably Aurors, and that they had done exactly what I had, so I went up to them.</p></div><div><p>‘What department do you work for?’ I asked. They both looked very shocked to see me.</p></div><div><p>‘Where do you think?’ asked the strange man.</p></div><div><p>‘Magical Law Enforcement.’ I answered.</p></div><div><p>‘WHAT enforcement?’ cried the spy, looking quite shocked.</p></div><div><p>I realized something was wrong to I shouted, ‘Expelliarmus!’ Nothing happened. No wands came flying out of their pockets. <em>They weren’t wizards.</em> I knew no muggles could’ve survived the bomb, because by time I Disapparated, there was no running time left. Not wizards, not muggles. <em>Not humans. </em>I ran. I’m not sure why I was so afraid but I was. Later on, I heard names. The spy was A. Z. Fell, and the strange man was the famous Anthony J. Crowley. In time, between the wars and the very long stretch of very busy years, I forgot about that night— until I saw you, two young wizarding children, coming to Hogwarts, with the same faces, and in some ways, same names, as those men. But that was only an inkling— I didn’t fully remember or understand until the night, three days ago, when I rushed back from London to rescue Harry. There were many small things that made me suspicious that some non-magical force was at work, but what really gave it away was finding a very dead Aziraphale, and then seeing him suddenly come back to life! I don’t know what you are, or what you’re doing, but I’d certainly like to know— I promise not to tell.”</p></div><div><p>Crowley and Aziraphale gaped at Dumbledore.</p></div><div><p>“If we told you... I’m not sure you’d believe us.” said Aziraphale at last.</p></div><div><p>“I’m not sure you really WOULD WANT to know.” said Crowley. “But then again...”</p></div><div><p>“Oh dear, I’ve never told anyone before...” said Aziraphale nervously.</p></div><div><p>“Nor I,” said Crowley, equally as nervous. “We could just...” He raised his hand.</p></div><div><p>“Erase my memory?” asked Dumbledore, a twinkle in his eye.</p></div><div><p>“HOW—???” blurted the duo.</p></div><div><p>“Just an educated guess,” replied Dumbledore. “You can, if you wish— but something tells me you won’t.”</p></div><div><p>“If we tell you, you must understand that we can’t do FAVORS, we can’t resurrect anyone who has died or anything like that. It’s against regulations!” said Aziraphale firmly.</p></div><div><p>“I know better than to try to use things I do not understand.” replied Dumbledore.</p></div><div><p>“Well... what do you say, angel?” asked Crowley.</p></div><div><p>“All right.” said Aziraphale. “Well, you see, in the beginning...”</p></div></div><p> </p><p>The End</p></div>
