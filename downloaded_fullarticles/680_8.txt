    <p>Harry smiled as he looked up at the scarlet steam engine, plumes of smoke spewing out and covering the platform. He looked behind him to Dobby, the small thin old man that had raised him like his own son. The kind butler and house keeper had originally worked for his mum before she had died, and her parents before they too had died. Not having any other family, Dobby had taken it upon himself to raise Harry, teaching him all he would need to know.</p><p> </p><p>But now, for the first time in his life, he would be leaving the comfortable safety of the manor, and the gentle and loving company of his oldest friend. Without thinking about it, Harry ran to the wrinkly faced man, wrapping his arms around him. He wouldn't see him again until the end of the school year, and he wanted the man to know how much he cared and would miss him.</p><p> </p><p>After saying their goodbyes, Harry took hold of his school trunk and travel bag, pulling them toward the train. Before he could board, a tall young man came up to him, introducing himself as the luggage man. Harry left his trunk with the man as he saw several other young men and women wearing the same red uniform as the man, taking luggage and things from other students, and putting them in what looked to be a large carriage at the back of the train.</p><p> </p><p>Keeping a tight grip on his drawstring bag, Harry stepped onto the train, manoeuvring around all the other teenagers that filled the train's corridors. As he reached the final carriage, he found a compartment that had no one inside. Pulling out a thick book, he slipped his bag under one of the two benches, before sitting down, and getting comfortable for the long journey.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Harry was brought from his reading by a light knock on the door of the compartment. Looking up as the door slid open, he smiled at the girl that entered. She had large bushy hair, two pronounced front teeth, and a pair of large bright hazel eyes. Harry saw that like him, she was already wearing her school uniform, a black blazer with red lining, which symbolised that she was to be in Gryffindor house like him, a white long sleeved shirt underneath, a black and red striped tie, and a long dark grey skirt that reached her knees.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello", she said, stepping into the compartment proper. "Is it alright if I sit with you? Most of the other compartments are either full, or have extremely noisy occupants".</p><p> </p><p>"Umm, yeah, of course", Harry replied, signalling to the seat opposite himself.</p><p> </p><p>The girl smiled brightly, placing a small backpack on the floor in the corner, and sitting down on the bench. Smoothing out the creases in her skirt, she leaned forward, offering her hand for Harry, which he took and shook.</p><p> </p><p>"My names Hermione", she said, leaning back into her seat. "Hermione Granger".</p><p> </p><p>"I'm Harry Evans, it's nice to meet you".</p><p> </p><p>Hermione's eyes went wide slightly in shock, as her mouth fell open. "Harry Evans? The son of James Potter?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry's face turned stony as his body went rigid. "Don't.Say.His.Name", he slowly grit out, his jaw tightening.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione seemed to cower back from him for a moment, her head falling so her hair covered her face. "I'm sorry. It's just. My dad knew him before-well before all that happened. When the trial was shown on TV, I remember dad being very angry. He kept on telling my mum that he deserved everything he got. I'm sorry for what happened".</p><p> </p><p>Harry stiffly nodded his head once, before forcing himself to relax, giving the girl a small smile.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Harry yawned and stretched his arms above his head as the train slowed to a stop. Looking out the window, he saw what must have been another couple hundred teenagers stood on the platform, bustling about and trying to see through the windows, likely looking for their friends. Hermione had told him that this was the only stop before arriving at Hogwarts. </p><p> </p><p>They had just arrived in the city of Nottingham, located in the very heart of England, and the Midlands. The would stop here for half an hour before setting off again, making the final push up to Scotland. Hermione said that it was so the students who lived in the Midlands, the North, and Wales, didn't have to travel all the way south to London, just to go all the way back north again. Apparently, the students from Ireland caught a plane from just outside of Dublin to a few dozen miles from Hogwarts, and then were driven on mass by coach the rest of the way.</p><p> </p><p>After 20 minutes of sitting around, Harry and Hermione's attention was drawn to the door, as it was pulled open.</p><p> </p><p>"Can we sit in here?" asked a girl with bright red hair set in intricate plats. Looking past her, Harry saw that there was another girl stood slightly behind her with blonde pigtails.</p><p> </p><p>Looking over to Hermione briefly, Harry looked back, smiling and welcoming them in, as the two girls smiled themselves and took their seats. Harry saw that they were wearing the same uniform as Hermione, but where Hermione had red highlighting her outfit, these two girls had yellow, showing they would be joining Hufflepuff.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>As the group of four disembarked the train into the pitch black night, they were drawn to a large man who was calling for all first years to go to him. As they approached, they saw that there was already half a dozen students milling about around the man. By their accents, they must have been the Irish first years.</p><p> </p><p>Harry blushed as he caught the eye of a girl with piercing stormy blue-grey eyes, and silvery blonde hair. Seeing him looking, she frowned at him, looking him up and down, before seeming to decide that he didn't look to bad, and lightly grinned at him, before turning back to another girl with long brown hair that she had been talking to. They both had the black and green uniform of Slytherin.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Harry yawned as he trooped into the Gryffindor common room with Hermione and the other first year Gryffs. The prefect, who was a snobbish red head called Percy, indicated to them which stairways to take to get to their dormitories, before walking of to join his friends, leaving the 11 year olds to do as they wished.</p><p> </p><p>"I think I'm going to head to bed", Hermione said, standing in front of Harry. "I'm absolutely shattered. Night Harry".</p><p> </p><p>"Night 'Mione".</p><p> </p><p>And with that, the two friends split, going up the different stairs to their beds, and to a good nights rest.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
