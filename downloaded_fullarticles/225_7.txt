    <p>Young men of a certain gentry are expected to act in a manner that will reflect well upon their family. The heir of an aristocrat does not live a life that is their own. The eldest daugters of nobility are married off for money and land, they are expected to bear children, preferably sons, as soon as possible. Eldest sons are to be perfect imitations of their fathers and they are to marry noble girls that they may not like, who often do not like them in return. He will marry for her dowery, and she will marry for his nobility. Then they have children and their children marry people they do not like, and they have children, and those children marry and so on and so forth. Each of them carry the burden of not only their own life but the legacy of their family as well. It is a blessing in disguise to be the heir to a fortune. When you are an heir you are treated to the best food, the best wine, the best clothes, yet expected to perform perfectly in every aspect of life. You must be well read, well spoken, cultured, poised, all while keeping your wits about you.</p>
<p>There are very few times in a young noble's life that they are able to cut loose from their parents watchful eye. More than anything the scrutiny of others is hardest to escape, because regardless of how sneaky you might think you've been, there will always be rumor that reaches back to your family. But while growing up, it is nearly as much a need to rebel as it is to breathe. Even if it is only in the smallest of ways. It's not all late nights and drunken stupors, at least, not for Draco. The ways in which he rebels are small and seemingly silly to his friends. Perhaps leaving the first few buttons of your shirt undone until someone tells you to do them up, sleeping in later than he should, or mucking about with the servants, and once in a blue moon traipsing off to a friend's house without telling anyone.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy is not the type to rebel, he listens to his minders, and when he is asked to do something, he does it without question. It isn't that he never gets the fleeting fancy to run off with his friends and get drunk on commoner's wine. Though from time to time he allows himself to do just that if the risk of it is slim. But he has more to lose than they do. If they make a mistake there is someone else to take their place. But Draco is the lone heir to his family's legacy, the only legitimate heir at the very least. He never allows himself to go out and flirt, or dance, or make a scene and it irritates his friends to no end.</p>
<p>They would often bring him tales of wild nights and misadventures in an attempt to make him join in on their shenanigans. Crabbe would speak of a girl he nearly bed, and Goyle would speak of the wine and dancing he'd missed, while Blaise would weave a tale of some fantastical near miss with death or the law. In all honesty it was tempting, sometimes he wished they wouldn't tell him these stories if only to spare him the slow and agonizing passage of his youth. It felt like he was living vicariously through them, yet missing every opportunity to have adventures for himself.</p>
<p>As a group they would always gather at Malfoy manor, as it was the largest of all of their homes and there were never any siblings around to pester them. There weren't nearly as many listening ears and mouths willing to snitch on them and their exploits. Though there were servants, but they could always be bribed. It's not as if Draco had anything more than a handful of passing flings and drunken nights to be exploited as it is. But it is best to have any rumors contained, especially when his friends are often such scoundrels. They are aristocracy too after all, and it would be tragic to tarnish their reputations.</p>
<p>Crabbe and Goyle are both dukes with important family ties and money to spare. They're somehow loosely related to the Malfoys though neither side could quite tell you how. They've got the same sharp nose on them and have got to be at least distant cousins. Blaise is a first born although not a sole heir, he has five siblings as well as six half siblings. His father has mistresses to spare and Blaise takes after him in this aspect. He could charm the clothes off of nearly anyone and he uses it to his advantage at every turn. It only makes it worse that he is ridiculously attractive. He has said time and time again that if he is ever cut off, which is very likely considering how shameless he is, that he will simply find someone willing to pay for his lavish lifestyle. It is hard to tell whether or not he is joking about this or not.</p>
<p>The lot of them lounge about a table which is scratched, dented, and beaten to hell. They hide it whenever the Malfoy parents are about so they won't toss it out. It was a memento from the time they'd gotten wasted, this time Draco included, and stole the ugly thing from a pub. It is still sticky and horrendous to look at regardless of how many times it's been washed and buffed by the servants. It is an old pub table and it would stick out like a sore thumb among all of the grandeur of the Malfoy mansion regardless of what they do to it. The juxtaposition of it makes them look like a band of misfits who only stumbled upon luxury perchance and they are rather fond of the idea.</p>
<p>The table is only brought out for the worst of offenses. If there is a chance they might be disowned arrested or killed the plan was always hatched around the table which had been lovingly dubbed the cunt's counter. Tonight's suggestion is especially heinous, not just because it was worse than anything they'd done before, but this time they have refused to let Draco bow out.</p>
<p>"I would sooner be tried as a witch than let you miss this party." Blaise said crossing his arms over his chest and looking sternly at Draco.</p>
<p>"You would undoubtedly die a horrible death, you aren't much of a saint." Draco retorted, hoping he might shift the topic away from him, or at least away fro the party.</p>
<p>"I may be sinful, but I've obviously been blessed by god." He said gesturing to himself then settling his elbows on the table and his chin in his hands to frame his face. He stared wide eyed in faux innocence at Draco and he nearly laughed, as Blaise is the least innocent of any one of them.</p>
<p>"Aren't you full of yourself today." Said Draco cracking a smile and rolling his eyes as he leaned back in his chair.</p>
<p>"He's been buzzed since noon." Goyle said with a small laugh as Blaise grabbed a coaster off the table and chucked it at him. It missed by half a foot without even a flinch from Goyle. Blaise sunk back into his chair sulking.</p>
<p>"Well that explains it." Draco said as if the matter had been resolved. "You'll sober up and let me off the hook, I have no reason to go and we would surely be caught." He nodded to Crabbe and Goyle expecting them to back him up like they normally did when Blaise thought up something insane. But when he looked over neither of them were quite looking him in the eye.</p>
<p>Crabbe sighed and when he finally looked at Draco his expression was steely. "We talked about it on the way over and he may be a drunkard, but he's right." This pushed Goyle to speak up too.</p>
<p>"You haven't been caught once! What's the worst they could do to you?" Draco took a breath in, intending to list a dozen things that could potentially go wrong. But before he was able to Goyle slammed his fist on the table and it shook so violently, as if it might topple to pieces. "Be bold! For once in your life!"</p>
<p>Surprised by the outburst Draco stuttered looking shocked "I- well- you know I can't-" Draco said haltingly, but Crabbe cut him off.</p>
<p>"We've already got a plan, so just listen."</p>
