    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>In another world, Harry Potter sat in her compartment with Neville Longbottom and his friend Hannah Abbott. Harry had known Neville all her 11 years of life, and through him Hannah. Hannah was clutching Trevor tightly while Neville cast longing gazes in the general direction of his parents. Harry stroked Hedwig.</p>
<p>A red-headed boy glanced into their compartment, saw two girls before the boy, and continued on his way. He briefly regretted that choice as, in the end, he was forced to sit alone with a young girl. Ron made introductions, and awkward conversation was held with Tom Riddle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Potter, Harriet!” McGonagall called, and Harry made her way to the stool. A short argument and a “are you sure you want to argue with an age old hat about where you belong?” settled her in “Slytherin!”</p>
<p>“Riddle, Tamsin!” was called two names later. She approached the hat with confidence, and it knew that “Slytherin!” was the only place for her. Tom sat to the right of Harry, sparing her a small smile before turning her attention back to the hat.</p>
<p>After “Zabini, Blaise!” made his way to their table, Harry allowed herself to grin and began making introductions and small talk. Draco Malfoy never paid her any mind; Draco was content with conversing with the other some ones. A half-blood Potter girl didn’t make the cut.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first day of classes was enlightening for Harry. The first day lectures were refreshing, calming her nerves, and letting her determination shine. She found herself sitting beside Lily Moon, who she approached with an introduction of her own middle name.</p>
<p>Small things remain constant no matter who one is. McGonagall would always lecture and ensure each and every student would take notes on a subject before attempting a practical. Flitwick would take a more relaxed approach, and would always make his class as fun as a school subject could be.</p>
<p>Severus Snape would always call upon Harry Potter in an attempt to humiliate the child of James Potter.</p>
<p>“Potter,” he said, interrupting the uncomfortable silence. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”<br/>
Harry stared, her ears burning. Her eyes were drawn to the frantic waving of Hermione Granger, her desperation to be called. </p>
<p>“I don’t know, sir,” she admitted, her fingers tightening. Neville gave her a sympathetic glance. Her father briefed the two of them about the history between her professor and her family, but she hadn’t expected obvious bias.</p>
<p>He sneered before asking another question. A few hands floated to the top at this one. Most people who grew up in wizarding families knew that a bezoar could be found in</p>
<p>“The stomach of a goat, sir,” she replied. Granger’s hand fell, her disappointed painted clearly on her face. Harry struggled to keep her face impassive.</p>
<p>Snape stared at her, fire in his eyes before looking away abruptly and demanding to know why they weren’t taking notes. Tracey Davis giggled at that, looking between Tom’s lazy grasp of her quill and Snape’s disgusted face. Harry and Neville shared another glance, this one being a grin.</p>
<p>Dean Thomas snickered at that, causing Gryffindor to lose their first point, and the class continued.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When lunch came, Lily decided to switch her morning and night supplies, leaving Harry alone in the Great Hall. She was too far into the Hall to turn back and walk with Neville, who seemed to be following a step behind Dean and Seamus. Hannah was already sitting, deep in a conversation with Susan Bones, her hands flying. A quick glance around the hall confirmed no one was eating outside their tables, so Harry continued her slow walk to the Slytherin table.</p>
<p>Most first years were quiet, with the notable exception being Malfoy. He took control of the conversation, talking loudly about their Potions class and the rowdy Gryffindors with Theodore Nott. Pansy Parkinson and Daphne Greengrass exchanged a look and laughed, leaving Harry sitting with Tracey and Millicent Bulstrode, each glancing at the other.</p>
<p>“Thank Merlin for Professor Snape,” Malfoy said, his gaze fixating on the three of them. Harry looked away.</p>
<p>Millicent scooped rice onto her plate. “I don’t know about the lot of you, but Professor Snape seemed kinda horrible,” she said in a rush. </p>
<p>Tracey’s face softened into a smile. “Definitely. Like he just attacked you, Harry!”<br/>
“Ugh, it was completely unjustified too,” Millicent added. </p>
<p>Harry smiled and shrugged. “Nothing I can do about it, but yeah, he’s pretty horrible.”</p>
<p>“Snape?” an upperclassman interrupted. The three of them nodded. “Yeah, his bias is ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“You gotta talk about your life with him,” another added.</p>
<p>“Or be rich and a pureblood,” someone else joined in. </p>
<p>“And the way he teaches,” he groaned. The group of them continued complaining, ranting about happenings throughout their years.</p>
<p>“I would’ve thought he’d like me because I’m a Slytherin,” Harry said, thumbing a grape. “But no, he just had to spring that on me.” </p>
<p>Tracey covered her face. “Can we talk about literally anything else? Please? I don’t wanna think about Snape while eating.”</p>
<p>Millicent laughed, looked up, and nudged Harry. Harry looked up and slid to make room. Tom sat in emptied space. She grabbed a few snacks and fingered them, looking steadfastly ahead. Harry shrugged and attempted to start another conversation. It didn’t work out, leaving the four of them to dine in an awkward silence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The afternoon classes moved quickly, which turned to a blurred week, with everyone  shuffling about the maze of stairs and attempting to make friends (not allies, friends). Well, almost everyone. Malfoy was quite happy with his group, with each of them having known each other for many years. Vincent Crabbe appeared to be attempting to branch out to Ernie Macmillan and his small lot of housemates with the aid of chocolate frog cards. Ernie wasn’t interested.</p>
<p>Ron Weasley appeared to be begging his siblings to help “tell them ‘bout what’s happened around here, yeah?” They ended up with a large audience of first year boys, each leaving the session with a new resolve to stir up a bit of mayhem. Just a tad. A small tad that couldn’t get them in trouble. They were only first years after all; it would be pathetic to get expelled at 11.</p>
<p>Granger could be seen behind a small stack of books at all times.Well, more like a small mound of bushy hair could be spotted around pages and pages of work. She seemed to be in a constant state of stress.</p>
<p>“She’s sorta a mess,” Neville remarked as the they watched her frantically scratch out a paragraph on her scroll. “Lavender said she hadn’t even tried talking to them.” </p>
<p>Hannah rolled her eyes. “Padma said Parvati tried reaching out to her, but she just shut them down because she had to revise her essay for Binns.”</p>
<p>“For Binns?” Harry laughed. “Who puts in effort for Binns?”</p>
<p>“Exactly!” Hannah exclaimed. “I can’t even tell if she enjoys the work or not.”</p>
<p>“She complains about it all the time,” Neville groaned. “I haven’t heard her talk about anything else yet.” </p>
<p>Harry dipped her quill in ink, adding a flower to her notes. “It’s more pathetic than getting expelled as a first year,” she muttered, laughing at Hannah’s “Harry!”</p>
<p>Then there was the issue of Tamsin Riddle. She didn’t have an air of superiority around her, but something about her made their fellow Slytherins stay away. It wasn’t that they’d ignore her. Daphne seemed desperate to befriend her, always offering to “fix up those robes, I know just the spell” and dragging her around the castle with a whined “please, Tom, please!”</p>
<p>The difference between Tom and her classmates was made clear the first day they got to cast magic in class. It was a quiet day in Transfiguration, with every student studying McGonagall’s wand movements intensely. They all wanted to be the first to succeed, whether it was to beat that Granger girl who got her needle to be silvery or to show up a sibling who they’re better than, damnit, or just to prove themselves.</p>
<p>Slytherins didn’t have the highest self-worth that year. (Yes, even Malfoy. What, did you think him flaunting his wealth wasn’t a thin veiled plead of “I am worth something more” and I need someone to confirm it?)</p>
<p>And then they got to practice. The desks were in a semicircle that day, with almost every student eyeing each other nervously when McGonagall said to begin. Malfoy was the first to try, and with that the floodgates opened.</p>
<p>Except Tom. She just breathed deeply, her concentration unwavering. She gave her wand an experimental flick, watching her needle start to become silver. Her lips pursed. And she tried again.</p>
<p>“Tom, can you help me,” Daphne whined. Pansy scowled, her grip tightening on her wand before she set to try again. A small fire started, causing the pair of them to yelp.</p>
<p>Tom smiled, looking back at her needle with satisfaction. She kicked her legs, rocking them back and forth while she examined the room. Tracey noticed this and nudged Millicent, who looked up at her. Tom smiled sweetly.</p>
<p>“Wait, you did it?” Lily exclaimed. Of course, her shout occurred while the noise level of the room died down. Tom’s expression flickered between annoyance and pride before giving her a small nod.</p>
<p>McGonagall swept across the room to her, picking up the needle and studying it closely. “Never in all my years,” she whispered. She placed it down, scribbled a quick note, and formed a fire in her fireplace. </p>
<p>The students watched her, talking amongst themselves, no one bothering to try anymore. Daphne was pulling Tom’s arm, showering her “dear” with praises. Harry and Blaise Zabini made eye contact, blushed, and turned to their own friends to marvel about how she did it. Malfoy just looked annoyed, muttering to Gregory Goyle about how “he could’ve done it too” and it “wasn’t all that special.”</p>
<p>“She must’ve practiced it before,” Goyle said, patting Malfoy’s shoulder reassuringly.</p>
<p>“The mudblood?” he hissed quietly. “No, she just got lucky!”</p>
<p>Harry and Blaise sighed in usion, made eye contact for a second time, and looked toward Tom. McGonagall had finished her message, said something to Tom, and then glared at the class. “One of you did it, I expect at least one more before the class ends,” she declared. The class blinked back at her. “Well?” her glare intensified, causing someone to shriek. Thus the students continued their lesson, slightly more aware of Tamsin Riddle.</p>
<p>Word got around quickly, leaving Granger to complain to Lisa Turpin about how it’s completely unfair.</p>
<p>“I can’t stand people who are just naturally good at things,” she grumbled, slamming her book shut. She pulled out a match. “I can only make it somewhat pointy, really, after a full hour of practice and Riddle just gets it right on her first try?”</p>
<p>Sophie Rodger gave a small “I know!” of encouragement. “It’s so discouraging when someone can just do something you’ve worked so hard at.”</p>
<p>Turpin nodded. “First try, utterly ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t Tom’s first try. It was her second, but the Hogwarts rumor mill didn’t care about accuracy. It cared for gossip and excitement, and a prodigy entering was very exciting for the lower years.</p>
<p>Harry groaned the fifth time someone recounted the story during dinner. “First time, second time, either way she’s a genius,” she complained. “If we’re gonna gossip right in front of her, can we at least have some accuracy?” </p>
<p>Blaise laughed, nudging Lily. “I just want to know what McGonagall wrote.”</p>
<p>“She told me to meet with Headmaster Dumbledore; I’m assuming the note was to alert him to the fact,” Tom said, her voice carrying throughout the table. Everyone paused to look at her. She primly cut a piece of meat, chewing it slowly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you’re getting punished for being good at magic,” Theodore said solemnly. “A visit to the Headmaster’s office so early in?”</p>
<p>“It’s tragic!” Daphne declared, resting her head on Pansy’s shoulder. “We should stage a revolt!”</p>
<p>Tracey looked between the two of them. “That’s a quick escalation,” she noted. “What did the headmaster do to you lot?”</p>
<p>“He’s known to be a bit anti-Slytherin,” an eavesdropping second year explained.</p>
<p>“My father always said that he was just horrid at being impartial,” Malfoy agreed.</p>
<p>“That’s nice and all, but I’m pretty sure they were exaggerating,” Millicent said.</p>
<p>Pansy scoffed. “Obviously not! Didn’t you hear that Dunbar girl during flying? How the headmaster hadn’t made a Slytherin a Head since the 40s?”<br/>
Harry frowned. “Why was that even a conversation topic?”</p>
<p>“And we can’t rebel– think of the points we’d lose!” Goyle said, looking around the table. Someone laughed at that, but Crabbe nodded in agreement. The rest of the group quieted down after that, watching Tom leave the table.</p>
<p>“Why’s she so graceful?” Pansy complained. Daphne rolled her eyes and the conversation started up once more.</p>
