  <em>Author’s Note:  I make no apologies for the many, many rabbit holes my muse is currently leading me down.  I know a little about SAO (mostly wiki-provided), a lot about HP, and quite a bit about how MMORPGs work so I’m hoping that carries me through.  I couldn’t find any great information about leveling or how the class system works or some of the game mechanics in SAO so I’m taking my best shot at this without that and building as I go.  That said, my usual SLASH warning applies with a set pairing of Kirito/Harry.</em>
</p><p><em>Also, SAO is set in the beginning in November of 2022, so HP events are moved forward in time to match Harry’s age of fifteen post Battle of the Department of Mysteries where we’ll pretend Sirius didn’t die and Voldemort </em>did<em>, making him sixteen at the beginning of the story.</em></p><p align="center">
  <strong>Prologue: Paved with Good Intentions</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>November 6, 2022; Town of Beginning, 1<sup>st</sup> Floor, Aincrad, Sword Art Online VRMMORPG; 2200 In-Game</em>
</p><p>“Fuck me sideways.”  Harry muttered, scowling with livid-fire green eyes up at the monologuing talking cloak creator of the new game he’d been talked into trying called Sword Art Online by his best-friend, Ron insisting that as he and his brothers, with help and inspiration from Hermione and a bit of financial help from his dogfathers, had gotten the NerveGear for him for his birthday, that he <em>had</em> to at least try it out before passing it off to George or another friend, complete with <em>somehow, he was thinking throwing his name around with his Gringotts investment contacts, </em>a pre-order of the game Sword Art Online which at that point wasn’t even in beta-testing yet.  “Ron, what did you get me <em>into…</em>”</p><p>…</p><p>
  <em>July 31, 2022; Grimmauld Place, London</em>
</p><p>Harry stared unblinking down at the gunmetal grey helmet with wires sprouting off of it as his friends and godfathers watched with bated breath, before giving in.</p><p>“Um…”  He looked up at Hermione, knowing that anything <em>that</em> tech-related was likely her doing, what with wizarding purebloods like Ron and George still struggling with the idea of a television with an Atari attached, let alone anything this advanced.  Honestly, if it wasn’t for her helping him figure out the right wards for his new “game-room” that he’d added in a fit of desperation-laced remodeling after the battle as part of his St. Mungo’s-mandated therapy, Sirius right beside him with sledge in hand, he would still probably be right there with them only with IPhones being the pinnacle of his tech-knowledge.  “What is it?”</p><p>“It’s a VR helmet, Harry.”  Hermione explained with an amused quirk of her lips.  “Called NerveGear, and a pre-order of that company’s first virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game they’re calling Sword Art Online.”  The more she spoke, the more Harry got the feeling that he’d gotten this gift so she could come over when Ron was training with Mad-Eye for future Aurorship and she was off from her own mad study schedule to play with it, all three of them given a gap-year to recover from the battle along with Neville, Luna, and Ginny as some were a bit more <em>damaged</em> than others.  “It starts beta-testing soon and is set to release officially the first week of November.”</p><p>“Do you have <em>any</em> idea how long it’s been since I played even a regular MMORPG, Hermione?”  Harry asked drily.  “And even that was older games like the original GuildWars, nothing like what you’re talking about with…<em>this</em>.”  He held up the helmet with it’s green eye-shield-screen-thing for emphasis.</p><p>“We all think it’s a good idea for you to at least try it out, mate.”  Ron jumped in when Hermione sat back with a huff.  “You can’t just hang out here with Sirius and Remus all day watching the telly and reading dusty old books from the Black Library.”</p><p>“Hey!”  Harry protested.  “I go out.”</p><p>Sort of.</p><p>“Running miles on a treadmill at the dingy gym two blocks over before stopping for curry doesn’t count, Harry.  And neither does meeting with your investment manager at Gringotts.”  Hermione shot that down without mercy.  “When was the last time you <em>spoke</em> to someone besides us.”  She held up a hand when he opened his mouth.  “No, the rest of the Weasleys and Hedwig do <em>not</em> count for the purposes of this question.”</p><p>Harry traded and amused-but-resigned glance with her boyfriend.</p><p>“Can you tell she’s going into law, mate?”</p><p>“Yep.”  Ron told him cheerfully, popping another cupcake courtesy of his mum into his mouth and chewing noisily.  “That’s why it’d be barmy to argue with her on this one.”</p><p>And that was that.</p><p>…</p><p>
  <em>November 6, 2022; 0500; Grimmauld Place, London</em>
</p><p>That being that didn’t make him any more <em>excited</em> to try the game – one that required actual participation from him rather than just a few clicks of a mouse, and he hadn’t even started playing yet since the game didn’t “open” until 1300 on the sixth in Tokyo, despite him doing a few “full-dive” immersions in the slim-pickings of NerveGear VR games – when the countdown had begun.</p><p>Nonetheless – to stave off badgering if naught else – Harry spent the prior day setting up his SAO profile with minimum effort: male, just-got-laid black hair, emerald green eyes, golden-tan skin, five-eight, same build.  Basically, him without the scars covering a good chunk of his body.  There were more than a few clothing options, but again, he went simple: white t-shirt, blue zip-up hoody, tan cargo trousers with lots of room for odds-and-ends, sturdy brown belt, boots, gloves, and pack, plus plain “standard” pants and socks, and he wished he was done.</p><p>Not even <em>close</em>.</p><p>Beyond that was choosing a name, which came off the record playing low in the background “Haze” which also doubled as a nickname for Harry…at least in England.</p><p>That way he might only be one of a dozen Hazes running around instead of a hundred Harrys if the others were having his same problems of effort versus originality – he rather doubted it.</p><p>Unsurprising for a game called “Sword Art Online” he was allowed to choose from a couple of basic swords to start out with – “Um, curved, I guess?” – and equip his first two skills, all of this completed after having to do a half-dozen “calibration” exercises to get him used to wearing the VR headset.</p><p>At least the skills were easy enough: choosing a curved sword gave him a sword attack called “Reaver” and starting out there were only a couple other basics to choose from without “unlocking” them according to the gamer’s guide that came with the purchase.</p><p>And Harry being Harry, with his ability to find trouble or have trouble find him, he was going to have that handy Searching skill on <em>all the time</em> so at least he’d get a bit of warning about the monsters headed his way.</p><p>Then the time came, Harry laid back on his bed, and gave the command.</p><p>“Link Start.”</p><p>…</p><p>
  <em>Town of Beginnings, Aincrad, SA0; 0005 Game-Time</em>
</p><p>Alright, Harry had to admit, the creators of this game had made it beyond beautiful with colors so vivid and different than he was used to that he was reminded – sharply – of the first time he set foot in Diagon Alley with Hagrid waving him on: distinctly <em>alive</em>.</p><p>Which he enjoyed the irony of given that everything at the moment was all in his head.</p><p>Or in a server…or something.</p><p>Regardless, he decided as he moved through the bustling town of NPCs and players who were either forming up groups based on outside real-life friendships or just in shared excitement, it was a whole new world of possibilities, one he found himself excited – if despite himself – to explore without the worry or danger of imminent death.</p><p>Having chosen a better-quality belt and boots over an extra item like a dagger or a shield, Harry made for the merchant NPCs he located on his map, quirking a bit of a grin when he found that he’d gained plus-twelve experience for using his “Searching” skill.</p><p>And if he stuck to his ground-in habits of being a spend-thrift by snagging some fruit from one of the trees to tuck away for later that he knew was “edible” for his avatar from the game guide that was no one’s business but his…and the other players who saw him do it and promptly mimicked him.</p><p>Smart kids.</p><p>Not that he <em>knew</em> they were kids…but he was having a bit of a problem separating his own beliefs about who played these kinds of games from the reality of not being able to <em>tell</em> thanks to the avatars being able to be fashioned near any age, look, or gender a player wanted.</p><p>Still, as minutes clicked by, the town began to fill with more and more players, and Harry had zero intention of being stuck with the pre-release estimate of ten-thousand gawking, talking, <em>people</em> – VR or not – when there was a whole world to explore.</p><p>And with that firmly in mind, Harry set out onto the plains surrounding the town, breaking easily into a soft lope with his curved sword – a scimitar, he thought – only bouncing a bit from where it was sheathed at his hip.  At least he was an adult and didn’t have to worry about his weaponry being too big to manage.  He’d spotted more than one avatar in town before he set off that would barely hit his sternum.  <em>Why</em> they’d made themselves that small he had no earthly idea.  Unless it came down to him basically being lazy and making himself, <em>himself</em>, only with the tyke-sized players sticking to their own dimensions.</p><p>If that was the case, at least it wouldn’t be hard to pick out the kids who due to age or preference had the Moral Conduct mod turned on.</p><p>Harry himself <em>liked</em> being able to swear, <em>thank-you-very-fucking-much</em>, even if he wasn’t all that interested in the Relationship, Sex, or Marriage aspects of the game.</p><p>Harry wasn’t more than a few yards from the town wall, just on the other side of the “Safe” area, when the pixelating air had a dark grin springing onto his face.</p><p>It was time to see just how <em>realistic</em> combat was…against something he had zero guilt about destroying at that.</p><p>…</p><p>A few hours and levels later, Harry had to admit – grinding and farming experience was so much more fun, if just as monotonous, in VR.</p><p>It took him about forty kills to make level two from the basic pissed-off-pig monsters that wandered the plains outside of the two, and by that time there were more and more players moving on from the hug-exclaim-befriend cycle going on as more and more players logged on.</p><p>Which meant it was time for him to take off…again, after a bit of a rest, a piece of fruit, and a regeneration/healing potion that took a few minutes to kick in.</p><p>Harry appreciated the basic Steel Scimitar that one of the hogs had dropped in lieu of random junk to sell to merchants or for use in crafting (something <em>he</em> wasn’t much interested in but he knew appealed to some people) or “cor” the currency used in Aincrad, especially as said steel scimitar had double the stats of the truly-crappy basic bronze scimitar he’d started with.</p><p>More grinding and farming later and Harry was almost out of his regen potions and coming up on a full inventory but he’d avoided the other players – he <em>really</em> liked that Searching skill – and was one quest away from hitting level six and getting his third skill slot opened…he was thinking <em>Hiding</em>.</p><p>If Hermione – or Merlin forbid, his mind healer – were here they’d be scolding him over managing to be antisocial in a social game…but meh.</p><p>It was only the first day of the launch, just coming up on half-way.</p><p>There was <em>plenty</em> of time to – blech – <em>be social</em> later since this game wasn’t <em>all</em> bad, with him having unlocked a dozen or so skills just from wandering and killing shit.</p><p>Not that he could <em>use</em> said skills without losing his progress on his Curved Sword and Searching skill but…still.</p><p>Effort counted, right?</p><p>Needless to say, Harry was in a surprisingly good – if tired – mood…which was when it all came crashing down courtesy of a forced-teleport back to the Room of Resurrection and a motherfucking megalomaniac.</p><p>Because he hadn’t dealt with enough of <em>those</em> yet in his life.</p><p>This wanker was apparently the creator of the game.</p><p>And the only way to escape it was by <em>winning </em>it.</p><p>Win, and you win your life.</p><p>Lose, and they’re all stuck in Aincrad or dead in real life.</p><p>“Fuck me sideways.”  He seethed, eyes glaring even as he did what his well-honed instincts were <em>screaming</em> at him to do and turned and started running for outside the town.  “What the fuck did I get into…?”</p><p>…</p><p>As the noise rose – and the hysteria with it – in his wake, Harry having gotten the gist of Captain-Talking-Head’s dastardly speech, Harry noted that he wasn’t the only one realizing the danger of both a hysterical crowd and well, <em>people in general</em>, as all around people were breaking off and getting away from the overcrowded room – and the town with it.</p><p>Most were behind him, Harry not one to stick around until the other shoe dropped no matter how exhausted he already was, but there were a few ahead as well, Harry coming up on them as one pair in the lead of him in the direction of where he’d pinged a town earlier but not visited towards the northwest came to a stop, Harry slowing down just enough to catch what one was saying to the other – god, they were younger than him and stuck in a death game – the black-haired boy speaking in accented English to the other.</p><p>Harry idly was thankful he’d ordered Dobby not to let anyone disturb him and had kept his headset plugged in, not able to wander far in the magic-rich environs of Grimmauld Place.</p><p>At least the House Elf <em>should</em> be able to keep Sirius from doing anything…<em>rash</em> until the cooler-head of Remus could prevail.</p><p>“I have friends here, Kirito.”  The older one was explaining.  “If this is- if this is <em>it</em> for now, I want to be with them.”</p><p>“Ok, Klein.”  The younger one with black hair nodded and stepped back, voice shaking despite his calm face.  “Keep in touch, I’ll be around if you need more help.”</p><p>“Thanks, Kirito.”</p><p>The two waved and then Harry pounced.</p><p>“Hey.”  He said, his English accent coming through loud and clear, pegging the other black-haired teen as from an Asian country from his accent, though he didn’t know them well enough to sort it out further than that.  “You heading out of town too?”</p><p>The boy nodded, eyes narrowed a bit on the older teen with eyes so green he’d think they were still his avatar’s render if not for knowing that his own features had changed back to his actual looks thanks to the game creator’s “gift”…though he, Kirito, didn’t have the scars to pop into being on his avatar that the older teen did.</p><p>Whoever he was in real life, he’d have to be tough, especially with the jagged – almost lightning-like – scar that started near his hairline over his left eye and ended on his left cheekbone, just missing one emerald green orb and its eyelids.</p><p>“Hai, yes.”  Kirito corrected himself, even as he fell into pace with the other teen’s stride, the pair speeding up to a jog as they headed for the northwest gate of the town.  “Panic is…dangerous.”</p><p>Well, it was <em>now</em>.</p><p>“There’s a village I found earlier about an hour’s jog from here, maybe twice that if we have to slow down or fight monsters.”  Harry continued, explaining his sudden bout of <em>friendliness</em> to himself as much as Kirito.  Personally…he thought it had as much to do with the innocent young face that looked like it’d never seen a day’s tragedy as it did anything else.</p><p>Damn saving-people-thing.</p><p><em>Always</em> rearing its ugly head at the worst damn times.</p><p>“Want to team up to make it there?”  He asked.  “I logged in straight-away and now I’m pretty spent.”</p><p>“Sounds…smart.”  Kirito had to admit, given that he’d done the same…though by the look of the non-basic scimitar on the other teen’s hip, this guy hadn’t spent the hours in-between helping out a rookie, whether he was one himself or not.  “I’m Kirito.”  So saying he flicked his hand and brought up the Party control screen.</p><p>“Haze.”  The older teen supplied, blinking a bit when his screen pinged with the message:</p><p align="center">
  <em>Player Kirito would like to form a Party.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Accept     Decline</em>
</p><p>A flick of his finger had him hitting the “O” to accept the party invitation, and with that the two of them jogged for the village Harry’d spotted, speaking now and then with Harry helping his new party-mate with a bit of English now and again as they made idle conversation to help pass the time, Harry learning that he’d made a better choice than he’d known, his instincts carrying over well so far from real life to his now VR-trapped-reality.</p><p>Kirito was a beta.</p><p>He <em>knew</em> Aincrad.</p><p>Harry’s chances of surviving his newest megalomaniac just became that much better.</p><p> </p>
