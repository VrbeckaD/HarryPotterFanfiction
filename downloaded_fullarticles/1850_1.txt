    <p>Green eyes widened with wonder and excitement as he watched all the commotion around him. Students and parents surrounded him with buzzing energy. Some students were being hugged by their parents, others were already on board, waving through a small portion of the windows. Some kids were already in school uniform - much like himself - while others still in their skivvies. There’s lingering steam causing the air to be hazy on the platform. Even though there is a lot of hustle and bustle around him, the steam does not fade away, nor does the familiar smell of coal and musty suitcases. </p><p>Eren Yeager’s hands were tightly gripped onto the handles of his trolley, ready for it to be passed over to be placed on his ride back to school. They were white at the knuckles and slightly shivering with giddiness. His heart was beating erratically and his mind brimming with thoughts about a whole year of adventures awaiting him. </p><p>“Eren-”</p><p>This was it, Eren thought, his stomach fluttering anxiously. Time to return to his second home, a place he loved so dearly. It’d be his fifth year and with it brought so much uncertainty. A good kind of uncertainty, of course. </p><p>“Eren!” A tug at his earlobe brought him back him back to reality very painfully. </p><p>Eren looked up, finding that they were in the front of the line to pass over his luggage for the year. Or, at least until Christmas. A kind man smiled at him, taking the trolley from his grip and confirming the final details with his mother. She turned once done, smiling sweetly at her son, her brown eyes shining with proudness and a tinge of sadness in them. </p><p>“Come along now, darling,” she ushered, guiding him closer to the entrance of his ride; a train. </p><p>No matter how many years it’s already been, Eren never got over the sight of seeing the giant scarlet steam engine train. It was glossy and well looked after; wheels black and clean, golden trim shining almost as if it was actual gold. They were standing closer to the end portion of it, with two carts left. A slight pang of sadness hit Eren, realising that he’d have to board the train all on his own, but it soon dissipated at the thought of being <em> home </em> in a few mere hours. </p><p>“Honey,” his mother chuckled beside him. “Are you alright?” She placed her hands on his shoulders squarely, turning Eren to face her fully. Her cheeks were a rosey pink, her brown hair long, passing over one side of her shoulders, and her eyes, slightly teary and red rimmed. “Don’t tell me you’re already feeling home sick.”</p><p>Eren’s cheeks tainted red, tearing his eyes from his mother to look at his polished school shoes. “Ma! Of course not!” He sputtered. He disliked when his mother teased him like this. Surely it was wishful thinking on her part. </p><p>Carla, his mother, laughed a bit louder. “I know, darling. It’s me who will be missing you instead, isn’t it?” After a small pause, she continued quietly. “It’s cute that you’re always this excited to return to Hogwarts, no matter how much older you get.” </p><p>Eren looked up to meet his mother’s eyes, a radiant smile filling his face as the butterflies continued to flutter. “Always! There’s no better place.”</p><p>Carla hummed in agreement, leaning forward to give her son a final hug. “Well, you take care of yourself, alright?” </p><p>“Of course, ma,” Eren sighed, giving her a tight hug back before she pulled away. </p><p>When drawn back, she pulled out her index finger, suddenly a stern look on her face. “And no picking fights. Your father and I are expecting less owl letters about you being in the infirmary or detention again, you hear me?” </p><p>Eren tried his best not to roll his eyes; that wouldn’t be a good way to say goodbye to his mother. “I’ll try,” he replied with a shrug instead. </p><p>“Well, try <em> harder </em> this year,” Carla chided, before the tight line of lips disappeared into yet another smile. “You have everything then?” </p><p>“Triple checked,” Eren confirmed, patting his pockets and side satchel. “I’ll be<em> fine </em>.”</p><p>“I know,” she smiled sweetly. Hesitantly she added, “I’m just going to miss you.” </p><p>Eren beamed at her again, leaning forward to give her one last hug. “I’ll see you again at Christmas.” </p><p>“Will do. Be sure to be on the lookout for letters. I’ll send you some gifts from home.” </p><p>“Definitely then,” he affirmed, backing away and slowly walking towards an entrance on the second to last cart. They were beginning to load the final students, he had better hurry to not miss his train. </p><p>“See you later, darling,” Carla called one last time as Eren stepped up onto the train. He waved quickly before walking deeper into the hallway. </p><p>The space was narrow and it was quite humid, clearly having too many sweaty, excitable teenagers in one space. With a deep sigh and swallowing the knot in his throat, Eren trekked his way up the cart, looking into each compartment for a spot where he could sit. </p><p>In all his years of going to school, this would be the first where he wouldn’t be able to sit with his friends. His childhood friend and neighbour, Armin Arlert, was a Ravenclaw and intensely clever. Or, as Eren used to think, quite the know-it-all. He was smart, good at his studies, and had an odd interest for runology - something Eren thought was a complete bore. Because of his good grades, this lead Armin to be chosen as one of fifth year prefects for Ravenclaw.</p><p>Following that track of line, his other childhood friend, through being family friends, Mikasa Ackerman, who was in Gryffindor along with Eren, had shown perfectionism in just about <em> everything </em>. It wasn’t a big shocker when she was picked as a prefect too. </p><p>They were both at the front of the train, in the first cart. There was a compartment just for prefects, meaning Eren wasn’t allowed to sit with them for the first time ever. It had taken him most of the latter portion of the summer to have gotten over that fact. And here he was planning on them eating themselves sick on sweets with his hard earned galleons working as receptionist for his father’s medical clinic over the summer.</p><p>Most of the compartments were full, filled with hyperactive students. He felt their excitement and desperately wanted to join them, but he couldn’t spot anyone in his year nor anyone he could actually recognise. If anything, they all looked like underclassmen; far too young for Eren to be hanging around. </p><p>Thus, he turned around and continued his trek downwards, eyeing up each compartment. He passed one that had a few older looking students, but it was completely full. Eight students in one was more than plenty. Eren was beginning to worry a little. Would he ever find a seat on this damn train? </p><p>Luck had to be on his side as he neared the final compartment. He leapt for joy when he saw it completely empty. Well, mostly empty. There were no students in there, only a few books piled neatly on the seating on the left. He had no idea where the owner of the books was, but he assumed they wouldn’t mind sharing.</p><p>Eren tried to open the door only to be disappointed that it was locked shut. He tried pulling vigorously, even growling as his fingers gripped the holder. Groaning in frustration, he whipped out his wand and held it up to the door handle. </p><p>“<em> Alohomora </em> ,” he called out. It did nothing. No sound, no spark, nothing. Pulling his face into disgust and running a hand over his hair, he tried to open the door forcefully again and it still wouldn’t budge. It took him a few more swishes and flicks, getting more and more frustrated after each enchantment. Only after the 26th charm did he <em> finally </em> hear the click of a lock. It shocked him so much, his green eyes nearly bulged out of his sockets comically. </p><p>“Yes!” He rejoiced, pulling the door open, clambering in, closing it and picking the seat that wasn’t occupied. </p><p>Eren looked around the compartment in amazement as he’d never been in one that was as empty. This one in particular looked really clean. In fact, even the velvety red seats felt brand new, plush, and extremely soft. The armrests looked new too, something that he’s never seen before in previous compartments as they were usually worn from years of usage. </p><p>It smelt of something similar to a dish his mother used to make. What was it called again? Lemongrass? He wasn’t so sure. Although, as Eren settled comfortably, he noticed quite a chill in the air. It was quite a contrast to what the hallway had felt like, so he dug into his satchel for his cloak for extra warmth. It was strange, he thought. It felt so lonely and cold not to be with his friends. He couldn’t help but wonder when the person who the books belonged to would join him. He wanted to at least talk to someone about the upcoming school year. </p><p>Just as Eren was pulling on his cloak, there was an announcement that all students should be seated immediately, the train was about to depart in two minutes. The excited jitters all came rushing back then. He couldn’t wait to be back in his school bed, eat delicious food, learn new charms and potions, and perhaps get a little better at his Defence against the Dark Arts classes - he nearly failed those last year - and to spend endless hours with Mikasa and Armin in the study halls. Hopefully this year they could go to Hogsmeade more often and drink more butterbeers to avoid responsibilities. Or, Eren could, Armin and Mikasa could take their books along if they really wanted to.  </p><p>Eren’s train of thought came to an abrupt halt when the compartment door suddenly got pushed open, revealing a fellow student in uniform with a terrifying scowl on his face. His eyes were grey, almost the colour of silver, his thin black eyebrows pinched lowly and his pink lips pursed, clearly very angry to have found Eren sitting there. </p><p>“Oi,” the student spat. “What the fuck?” </p><p>Eren stared shell shocked, heart suddenly hammering in his chest. Was he maybe not supposed to have gone into this compartment? Was it perhaps locked for a reason? Was it because of this scary looking student? Was this a private room? No, that couldn’t be it, there weren’t anything like that on the Hogwarts Express.</p><p>“Uh...” Eren stammered, unable to gather a proper response. He lifted his hand to rub at his cheek, unsure. </p><p>“How the hell did you get in here, brat?” The student demanded, his voice deep and clearly ticked off. Eren was beginning to wonder if he’d make it out of this train alive - this student looked purely evil. So, he decided to reply honestly, as to not upset him further, for whatever reason. </p><p>“Alphom-” Eren’s voice died down as the frown deepened. He swallowed anxiously. Yeap, he decided, definitely not getting out alive at this rate. </p><p>“Final warning, train will be departing in one minute.” The intercom sounded. </p><p>The angry student clicked his tongue, stepping in to close the door and slip into his seat. He sat closer to the door on the opposite side of Eren and looked extremely rigid. It was almost like he was uncomfortable for Eren to be there. </p><p>With a final toot, the train began to move. Eren peeled his eyes off from the angry student to look at the window to his right, taking in the sights as they left Kings Cross station and began to travel through London. The beginning of the ride always got him most excited. True, it was a long journey, especially without his friends, but he knew it off by heart by now. He knew what sights to look out for to more or less locate how much further they had to go. </p><p>“How the hell did you get past my locked charm?” The student asked, breaking Eren from his wondrous stare. “It was even a strong one.”</p><p>Eren couldn’t help but laugh, turning back to look at the student. “It took me a couple of tries. You were pretty set on not getting anyone in here.” </p><p>“For a reason, kid,” the student scoffed, crossing his arms with yet another frown. </p><p>“And that reason is…..?” Eren asked, a small smile on his lips as he kept watching. </p><p>“Quietness,” he replied. “This damn train is too fucking noisey, never-mind the incompetent charms being sputtered about.” </p><p>“But!” Eren protested, sitting up and leaning towards the other. “Everyone’s excited! How can you not be!?”</p><p>The student raised an eyebrow at Eren, looking at him in a mocking gesture. “When you’re in seventh form, the <em> fun </em> fucking wears off.” </p><p>Ah, Eren thought. He leaned back against the plush cushions, mulling it over. The student was older than him. He certainly didn’t look it. If anything, he seemed younger because of his shorter structure. Then again, with having such a sour face as he did, the student looked like he was almost too old for Hogwarts. </p><p>“That’s a shame on your part,” Eren snickered. “Well, I needed a seat, so you’re stuck with me for now.” </p><p>The student clicked his tongue again, sighing as he fidgeted in the seat. After a couple of moments of silence, he finally spoke up. “As long as you’re quiet, you can stay in <em> my </em> compartment. One fucking peep and I’m kicking your shitty ass out.” </p><p>Eren wrinkled his nose, a little annoyed himself by this rude person. Why was this student so forthcoming about this being <em> his </em>? It wasn’t like he had his name written all over. But, for needing a place to sit, Eren agreed. Sure, it’s going to be a long and boring ride, but he’d just have to make due. </p><p>As the train moved in a steady pace, the scenery now of rolling hills of greenery, Eren eventually grew bored and went on to curiously inspect the grumpy seventh year a little further. He found the student reading a softcover book. The book was a maroon colour and Eren was sure there was a picture of a broom on it. The student was still sitting up straight as anything with his head facing downwards to the book he was holding on his lap. </p><p>He was strikingly pale, almost as if he rarely saw the sun. Granted, the books and his seemingly foul-personality made Eren think that he most likely not got out of the house much. Probably didn’t even have any friends either. His hair was jet black, short and shaved at the back in something Eren only really saw ‘hip’ muggles wear these days. Was this student perhaps a half blood too? Or muggle born like Armin? Did he coexist with muggles like Eren and his friends? His hair parted more on the right side of his forehead, falling over and hiding his eyebrows and eyes as he continued to read. His nose looked sharp, but, dare Eren admit, a little cute. So were his thin pink lips, still pursed in a frown. Sure, he was small and most definitely shorter than Eren, but the same could not be said about the broad shoulders and nicely sculpted forearms. He looked strong and that made Eren swallow a little nervously. He raked his eyes over the pale skin, to the white school shirt only to land on a green and silver striped tie, indicating that he was in Slytherin. </p><p>
  <em> Slytherin.  </em>
</p><p>Figures.</p><p>He most definitely had Slytherin written all over him. Looks and personality. Eren didn’t usually hang around the average Slytherin. Often times, they were the ones that were being mean to Armin which essentially lead to Eren being stuck in detention because of all the fights he got into. Thus, he usually avoided them if he wasn’t around the very few he did know - such as Annie who often got into trouble too because of Armin. </p><p>But yet, Eren couldn’t keep his eyes off this student. There was something about him that Eren couldn’t decipher. He almost seemed familiar, like Eren has seen him before. Perhaps he had,  most likely within the school grounds. Although, it seemed more than that. Like he should know already why this guy was so angry by the disturbance. It was like Eren’s heart was urging him to invade his space even further, just to see what the Slytherin would do. </p><p>Eren kept pondering, eyebrows drawing in confusion and humming quietly to himself. It clearly was a bit too loud as suddenly the student’s head moved up a little, silver eyes flicking to meet Eren’s green ones. Eren gasped, heart suddenly hammering. Biting his bottom lip, he looked away quickly, to rest his elbow on the window sill and stare out. He felt his cheeks grow hot, a little ashamed at being caught staring. With bated breath, he kept his eyes straight, not daring to see if the student was watching him still. Only after a few minutes of no questions being asked, he let it out, feeling a little more relaxed. </p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>It was around two hours into the train ride when Eren’s most favourite part of the entire journey occurred. <em> Honeydukes Express </em>. Usually it’d be much sooner, but since he was in the second to last cart, he figured it probably took the trolley lady a while to get to them. </p><p>With a knock on the glass door, Eren beamed a bright smile, already digging into his satchel for the extra sickles his mother had given him on top of his own galleons. She knew he and his friends always loved getting sweets for the journey, so she always gave him a sufficient amount for the three of them as a treat. </p><p>“Anything from the trolley, boys?” The old trolley witch asked delightedly, bright smile matching Eren’s own. She looked between Eren and the other student, who was by now nearing the end of his book. </p><p>When the other student didn’t reply, Eren stood up, jumping towards the door with one huge leap. </p><p>“Yes!” Eren shouted, passing over the sickles. With a deep breath he began to list, “Ten of the chocolate frogs, two of Bertie’s beans, two jelly slugs, two liquorice wands, two pumpkin pasties, and,” Eren paused, milling over the idea. So far the student he was sharing the compartment hadn’t stood up. He didn’t have a very big backpack himself and it didn’t seem like the Slytherin had anything to drink. So, being the kind boy his mother raised him to be, he added, “a pumpkin juice and water, please.” </p><p>“Very well,” the trolley witch replied, gathering all the snacks. Eren gave her the extra sickles for the drinks after that too. It took him two trips to drop everything on his seat until she finally handed him over the drinks. </p><p>“Thanks!” Eren exclaimed, turning around when she shut the door. Before going back to his seat, he held out the water to the Slytherin. He had been aware that he was being watched the whole time, the student having a look of disgust on his face. </p><p>“For you,” Eren offered when the student did nothing but look at him with furrowed brows. </p><p>“I’m not thirsty,” the Slytherin replied. </p><p>Eren sighed and rolled his eyes. What a pain in the ass, maybe he shouldn’t have done a good deed. “Well, just take it, please?”</p><p>The slytherin student took it eventually, muttering, “Thanks,” under his breath. Eren smiled in reply, nodded and took his seat again.</p><p>Eren opened his ice cold drink quickly, taking an exaggerated gulp. He still felt a pair of eyes on him, but he tried to ignore it as he picked through the treats, eyes wide with wonder, trying to decide which one to have first. All summer long he was craving these sweets. Back at home, in the muggle world, they didn’t have these varieties and he was stuck with what they sold in shops there. Thus, the journey back to school was even made more special. He decided to open the jelly slugs first, wanting to enjoy the gummy-like texture first. Eren had to muffle down a moan as the nostalgic flavours and texture burst into his mouth. He sat back, leaning his head onto the seat as he watched the scenery fly by, savouring every second. </p><p>When done eating a handful, he felt blindly for a chocolate frog. Holding it up in the air, he quickly opened a packet, taking the frog in one hand, he took a bite and held up the collectable card in another. </p><p>He smiled fondly, finding yet another <em> Hermione Granger </em> for his collection of over 600. In the moving image, she was still young compared to now. She wore the Hogwarts uniform with pride, a complete contrast to now where she was constantly in business attire and flashed as the new Minister of Magic. Eren couldn’t help but remember lovingly all the years his mother told him stories of the second wizarding war. Of the brave wizards and witches that fought and died, of the deconstruction of Hogwarts and many more things. Eren grew up wanting to be like Harry Potter or Ron Weasley. Aurors; someone who fought evil and did the right thing. But his father had different plans for him and his school grades meant that it was an unlikely future for him. </p><p>“Bloody hell,” the Slytherin student scoffed, breaking him away from his thoughts. “So many fucking sweets.”</p><p>Eren looked up at that, eyebrows rising in interest. “What’s wrong with sweets?” He couldn’t help but notice the student was now sitting closer to him and the window. He must have moved at some point. </p><p>“They’re disgusting,” he groused. “You’ll rot your teeth if you eat all of this shit.” He nodded towards the pile next to Eren. </p><p>Eren laughed, looking at the pile again. “Can’t be that bad,” he reasoned. “I only have it while on Hogwarts Express.” </p><p>“You’ve still got too many to begin with,” the student countered, putting the book down to cross his arms. </p><p>“Would you like one then?” Eren offered, smiling a little. </p><p>“No,” the Slytherin spat. </p><p>Eren hummed, sitting up a little bit to shuffle through the treats. He picked another chocolate frog from the pile, opening it up. He chuckled when he noticed Ron Weasly as the collectible card, but didn’t look further as he held out the frog in hand to the student. </p><p>“At least try one of these, they’re really good.” </p><p>Eren waited and watched the other student, hoping he’d take it before the frog began to melt in his warm hand. When the Slytherin did nothing but narrowed his eyes, Eren leaned a little more forward. “Come on, it’s not going to kill you.” </p><p>With a click of the tongue, the student unfolded his arms. “Give me a <em> new </em> one.”</p><p>“What?” Eren questioned, tilting his head to the side. </p><p>“I don’t want a half melted one from your filthy hands,” the Slytherin explained. “Who knows what you’ve touched.” </p><p>Eren rolled his eyes, groaning. “My hands aren’t dirty.” </p><p>Nevertheless, he got a new package from the pile and held out that instead. The student took it begrudgingly, careful to pick it up from the top with his fingers, as to not make contact with Eren. </p><p>“Give me the card at least,” Eren demanded. “I collect those.” </p><p>The student hummed, opening it with nimble hands before flicking the card towards Eren’s lap. Eren watched in anticipation at the Slytherin across from him tentatively nibbled at the head, deciding that it was okay to take a bigger bite.</p><p>“Not bad,” he mused. “I guess.”</p><p>“See! I told you!” Eren beamed. “Nothing beats chocolate frogs! They’re my favourite.” </p><p>The raven eyed Eren up before answering. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Jelly slugs comes in second. Although, I think you’d like liquorice wands better.” Eren held out the packet for the Slytherin to take. Much like before, Eren’s stare was unnerving as he watched the raven open up the tip and take a curious bite.</p><p>“It’s…” The student began. “It’s not bad either.” </p><p>Eren laughed, bouncing in his seat. He was overjoyed that the Slytherin student was liking the treats. He knew everyone liked these. How could they not! </p><p>“Back in London you can buy red ones of those, they’re raspberry flavoured. And even darker flavoured ones, although I don’t like them very much. They make your tongue go numb.” </p><p>“You live with muggles?” Levi asked, not an inch of interest in his voice as silver met green.</p><p>“You don’t?” Eren furrowed his brows. He assumed in this day and age that just about everyone coexisted with them. </p><p>The Slytherin student shrugged his shoulders, breaking the eye contact to eye up the liquorice wand. </p><p>“Oh, strange,” Eren mumbled, feeling a little dejected. “You know, your hairstyle is really popular where I’m from.”</p><p>The Slytherin looked up again. “Is it?” </p><p>“Yeah...” </p><p>There was an awkward silence following his reply. Eren didn’t know what else to say. It usually wasn’t this hard to keep conversations going, but this student was giving him a hard time by not showing much interest or asking any further questions. Nevertheless, Eren being who he was, he couldn’t let the conversation die down like that. Biting his lip, he introduced himself. “I’m Eren Yeager, by the way.”</p><p>“Levi Ackerman.”</p><p>“Oh!” Eren blurted. “I’m friends with an Ackerman! Mikasa. Do you know her?” </p><p>Levi shrugged his shoulders and replied, “Sounds familiar.” </p><p>“She’s in Gryffindor with me,” Eren continued further. “We’re fifth years and she was lucky to be picked for prefect this year.” </p><p>“Good for her.”</p><p>Eren nodded vigorously, proud of Mikasa and Armin for having been chosen. “Yeah, she and my other friend both are. They left me in the dust.” </p><p>Levi snorted. “Surely you’re underestimating yourself.” </p><p>“Oh no, I wish.” Eren shook his head. “Like, it took me a few <em> months </em> to pick up flying in my first year. It just takes me a while longer than them.” </p><p>“That’s a shame.” </p><p>Eren kept talking. He couldn’t stop. It felt so nice to talk about magic and school again after and entire summer of muggle talk. He missed being able to talk freely about charms and subjects, and the wizarding world sweets. Levi never asked any questions, he just kept his silver eyes trained on Eren as the fifth year babbled on, talking about this and that. He seemed mildly interested, but didn’t have anything in particular to add. Eren was fine with that. </p><p>Eventually the one sided conversation grew tiring and before Eren knew it, all his snacks were already gone, minus one singular chocolate frog. He decided to keep that for later, near the end of the journey. Levi eventually excused himself, explaining to Eren that he had a lot of summer reading to catch up on. Apparently seventh year was no easy walk in the park. </p><p>Eren allowed him to as Levi had been nice enough to talk to him to begin with. He ended up getting his own book; a story about a witch who loved to animagus into a cat for mischief. He settled in, leaning against the corner between the window and velvety seat and began reading. </p><p>But as time ticked away slowly, Eren felt his eyes grow heavy. The motion of the train, his heart full of returning home, a place he loved, his belly full with sweets, and the after taste of delicious pumpkin juice all lulled him to a dream filled sleep. </p><p>His dreams were always the same. They were always adventurous and filled with magical creatures. They involved trolls, although these were much, much different. These looked more human-like. They were the colour of ivory-skin, naked, and most had hair. They weren’t nearly as stupid as Trolls, but definitely more dangerous. He always remembered the images; their scary smiles and their human-like eyes. But sometimes, he’d also remember the blood that covered them, or even more so, the blood oozing from the deep slice of their nape. Of the roars they’d scream, whether it be out in the fields of green, or inside cities covered with brick buildings and cobblestone streets. He could always taste and smell the blood, making his stomach churn. It was usually at this point he’d wake up and vow to stop reading books on magical creatures in his spare time. </p><p>Although, this dream turned differently to all the ones prior. In previous ones he could only ever hear the roars and screams of the trolls. But now, he could hear voices. Or, a voice. It sounded familiar and yet, not really. It was deep and comforting. And before he knew it, the scene of trolls being covered in blood and smoke vanished and he was placed in a room. He sat at a wooden table, holding a teacup - something that smelled similar to his mother’s tea that she always drank - between two hands. The room had ambience, only being lit by one lantern with the same voice talking lowly. It was quiet, he could barely understand it, and yet, he felt so incredibly comfortable. Rather than forcing his dream-like self to look up, he kept trying to hear what the person was saying. He stretched and stretched, but to no prevail. Instead, another similar voice that was less gruff began talking. It kept coming closer and closer until-</p><p>“Oi,oi, oi, Yeager.” </p><p>Eren started, eyes sliding open instantly as his hazy mind began to reel. “Hmm?” He hummed, searching the room in confusion; trying to figure out where he was again. It took him a few moments to get his bearings right, remembering that he was on the Hogwarts Express, heading back to Hogwarts for his fifth year. </p><p>“We’ve arrived,” Levi explained. </p><p>Eren groaned, rubbing his right eye, “Right, sorry.” </p><p>Eren stretched and yawned, hearing the muffled sounds of students talking in the hallway. Levi had already gathered his things back into his bag. He had also at some point pulled on his knitted school jersey and cloak, and was waiting patiently on the edge of his seat for more students to leave.</p><p>Eren followed suit, standing up to place his book back into his satchel and slipping in all his rubbish to throw away back at school. Once done, he turned back to Levi, finding the Slytherin standing by the door, having been the one to open it. Eren bit his lip, still feeling dazed from his dream and a little weird from having heard a similar voice as Levi’s in his dream. Either way, he smiled through it.</p><p>“It was nice to meet you, Levi.”</p><p>Levi looked back over his shoulder to reply, “You too, Yeager.”</p><p>Eren lifted his hand to rub at his no doubt mussed brown hair. “Guess I’ll see you around?” </p><p>“Probably,” Levi answered. “Bye.”</p><p>“Goodby-” Eren tried, but before he could finish, Levi already slipped into the hallway, diving into a sea of students dressed in uniform too. </p><p>Eren sighed, a little deflated from the lackluster goodbye. It suited the Slytherin though. He really wasn’t one for talking, Eren should have known better. With that, he double checked he had his belongings before squeezing himself into the hallway and out of the train. </p><p>By now it was dark outside, the platform only lit by lanterns. First year students milled about as older years walked along the train station to the designated area for their ride into Hogwarts. Eren did as the others until he reached the moving carriages </p><p>He saw a couple of students from his year then, all of them with bright smiles on their faces. One of them was even waving, her long brown hair flying about as she jumped in excitement, calling his name. He was about to go up to the group of three but was stopped when his childhood friend called out for him. </p><p>“Eren!” Armin called, speed walking towards him with Mikasa in tow. “So relieved we found you!”</p><p>“Armin! Mikasa!” Eren beamed, turning to hug his blonde friend immediately and then Mikasa. “How was your trip, Arm?” </p><p>“Wonderful! I can’t wait to tell you about it!” Armin exclaimed. “It was so hot too!” He added. Eren only then realised how red his friend was. Considering he only flew back into London the day before, his poor childhood friend was still suffering from a hideous sunburn. </p><p>Eren couldn’t help but laugh, so happy to finally see him again. Mikasa seemed to be in good spirits too, a small smile on her face as she watched over the two. Having been caught, she nodded at Eren, privately telling him that she had a good summer too. </p><p>They ended up sharing a ride to Hogwarts with some fourth years. Which didn’t matter as the entire ride Armin spent talking about his family trip to Greece. His muggle parents had a keen interest in history - something that Armin more or less picked up on as he grew. Not so much the muggle side of things though. Both Mikasa and Eren allowed him to continue, only every now and then asking more questions. </p><p>The sight of Hogwarts castle coming nearer made Eren’s stomach explode with butterflies of nerves and excitement. Being with Armin and Mikasa made things feel more real, unlike when he was with Levi on the train. Now he could really show his happiness. The school was mostly black in the dark sky. The tower windows were lit, as were all the lanterns. It was welcoming and almost like a breath of fresh air. They were home now. Their second home. And at a place where they could continue to learn and use magic without any consequences. </p><p>Once they were in the main gates and inside the building, they walked to the Great Hall where the welcoming ceremony and feast was held. As always, the room was buzzing, filled with fellow students. There was floating candles above along with a magical night sky; brilliant as always. The long wooden tables held empty plates and goblets, ready and waiting to be filled after the sorting ceremony. Professors were already seated, talking amongst themselves too. Armin excused himself once they entered, saying that he’d see them either later or the following day. It was hard to find more or less their spot on the seating benches. As the years ago by, the further along they moved from the front. Mikasa and Eren eventually found the section, choosing to sit across from their friends and fellow Gryffindors, Jean Kirstein and Reiner Braun. </p><p>Eren had about five seconds to appreciate the buzzing atmosphere, his feet jittering underneath him before the peace was ended by Jean, the loud mouth, opening said mouth. </p><p>“<em> Yeager </em>, what a surprise to see you’re back for another year,” Jean remarked, leaning his elbows on the wooden bench. Jean was a friend slash enemy to Eren. Often was also the cause of detentions too because of their bickering in classes. </p><p>“Kirstein,” Eren gritted his teeth. “Surprised to see you haven’t gotten rid of that lame ass haircut.”</p><p>Reiner laughed, wrapping his muscular arm around Jean’s shoulders before the boy could spit a comeback </p><p>“Good to see you, Eren! You too, Mikasa,” he greeted. “How was your summer break?” </p><p>They spoke amongst themselves, sharing memories of the heat wave and what each one loved doing. Jean apparently went back to France to visit extended relatives. Reiner had spend most of it with Annie, who was a Slytherin, and Bertolt, who was in Hufflepuff. They didn’t get up to much, just mostly wasted away at the beach somewhere. Mikasa’s was much the same, having gone away with her usually busy parents. Eren tried not to let Jean’s extreme interest in Mikasa’s trips bother him. The guy had been after Mikasa for <em> years </em> . The crazy part is, as they’ve grown older, Eren swears Mikasa was starting to grow insane. Just at the end of last year, she had <em> offered </em> - much to Eren’s disgust - to go to Hogsmeade alone with Jean. Luckily he didn’t have to think too much of it before Reiner pitched in and asked Eren about his. </p><p>Unfortunately Eren’s was the lamest, having to work at his father’s clinic. It wasn’t anything new. Most summers he had to unless Mikasa or Armin could whisk him away in prior planning. He didn’t mind it too much; earning galleons at such a young age was nice. But what he did mind was the constant reminder of his father wanting him to become a healer. He tried to vanish that thought away, not wanting to ruin a good night of food and meeting the first year students. </p><p>With that in mind, a group entered the great hall, all looking only a little terrified. The entire student body fell silent, staring at the little youngsters. They were all aged 11 and nervous for what the school would bring. As Eren watched the kids walk down the hall, to the professors at the front, he couldn’t help but think back to when it as him. He had been so happy to have been accepted. He had plans of being in Gryffindor with his two best friends and becoming a great wizard. Unfortunately, Armin ended up in Ravenclaw and even worse, Eren turned out to be a pretty average wizard. But, he had determination and that surely meant for something. </p><p>The ceremony went as it always did, each first year student got sorted into the house after the school song was sung. Once they were all picked, headmistress, Professor McGonagall stood up, welcoming the student body. By then Eren was getting restless and very hungry. But, he held on through, waiting anxiously for the speeches and announcements to be done. </p><p>“Please enjoy the banquet,” the headmistress finished. With that, delicious food appeared on the table, along with pumpkin juice in the goblets. </p><p>Eren cheered along with his friends, finding an entire roast beef in front of them and roasted potatoes. He dug in quickly, eager to fill his very empty stomach. They didn’t normally have such amazing food, so they all fought over the best of the best.</p><p>Every now and then, Eren couldn’t help but glance a sneak peak towards where the Slytherins sat. He was in search for Levi. He couldn’t quite figure out <em> why </em> he was so drawn but he didn’t think much of it as he continuously scanned the end of the table where the seventh years were seated. It was only for a split second that he spotted the pale face and raven hair before someone else blocked the way. Dejected and a little sad about not seeing him eat for longer, Eren gave up on that altogether and got back to his food. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Once dessert and final announcements were made, Mikasa and Eren made their way to the Gryffindor common room. It felt good walking the familiar corridors, climbing the tedious moving steps, and greeting the joyful paintings and their occupants. Every now and then Mikasa was stopped, spoken to and asked how her holiday was before they could continue to the entrance. </p><p>It felt like clockwork greeting the Fat Lady. Even after the password was given - Mikasa somehow knowing it. The Fat Lady was still cheeky enough to reprimand Eren and hope he’d get less detentions this year. He muttered under his breath how it was never <em> his </em> fault to begin with. Mikasa giggled behind him as they entered, agreeing that he needed to learn to walk away from arguments. </p><p>The cosy common room felt like home. Doused in red and gold, the room was warm as the fireplace was already crackling. Students milled about, catching up with their friends. Some sat on the red decorated couches, while others stood about. Eren always felt safe in here, like he could find no better place to be. Mikasa excused herself shortly after, saying she was tired and was going to head for the baths and bed. Eren did the same, finding his usual dormitory, now labeled, ‘Fifth Years.’ He went to his bed, his belongings already stacked next to the four poster bed. To the right sat his dresser with a lantern, water jug, and closed red curtains that normally overlooked the grounds. </p><p>Unfortunately his bed was right next to Jean’s. Luckily Jean wasn’t around yet as he stayed back in the Great Hall, probably hanging out with his two mischievous and energetic friends, Connie Springer and Sasha Braus, and an angel of a guy, Marco Bott. Eren got to work, taking off his cloak and dumping it on his bed. Unfortunately it must have been startling as a cat jumped up and hissed at him. As always, Jean’s annoying black and white cat, Jugs, was yet again sleeping on <em> his </em> bed. The mangy little thing loved to put itself wherever Eren’s scent was - or more often than not, decidedly slept with him rather than Jean himself. It was such a pesky little thing. It was a great relief that Eren had an owl, <em>Luffy</em>, who wasn’t nearly as needy.  </p><p>Ignoring the cat, he went on to unpack, placing his things in the trunk and drawers before heading for the boy’s bathrooms. Upon returning, everyone was inside the room, having a nine o’clock curfew leaving them not much time to socialise outside of their common rooms. Reiner was still unpacking from across the room and Jean was in bed and in his plaid pajamas, scratching Jugs as she sat on his lap. The other boys in his year were doing similar things, all pretty tired from the long day of travel.  </p><p>Eren wished everyone goodnight, suddenly feeling the excitement of the day hitting him. While it was nice to feel like that, it was also very tiring. With his belly full, the dorm a nice toasty temperature and the lanterns creating a sleepy ambience, he settled comfortably on his thick mattress, covering himself in the red quilt that smelt of calming scents. </p><p>The day’s events passed through him, particularly of the Slytherin, Levi. Eren still couldn’t quite figure out why his mind kept reeling back to the short and grumpy student. Was it because he still remained such a mystery to Eren? Was it because, dare he say it, Levi was sort of charming in an odd kind of way? What with the pointy nose, silver eyes, and very <em> nice </em> forearms? Or was it that deep, baritone voice; calming and familiar for some reason. He’d never met Levi before in his life. Most certainly never seen him around school grounds - probably due to Levi being so quiet and, well, unique. And yet, Eren couldn’t help but wonder why Levi had been talking to him in his dream. Nor why he felt such attraction to him either. </p><p>The thoughts all conjured into something sweet, gliding him into a dream-filled sleep of menacing trolls, soothing voices over a cup of tea, and soon enough, of flying through forests, Levi’s familiar undercut in front of him. </p>
