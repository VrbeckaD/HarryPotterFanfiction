    <p>The train bustled along the tracks, the sight of the rolling green hills of the English countryside flashing outside the compartment windows. Vera gazed lazily through the glass, her mind replaying the memory of her parents waving her off with her younger siblings. If there was one thing she disliked about going back to Hogwarts, it would be the fact she would have to leave behind her family. They had seemed more distant this time, refraining from the annual hand on her shoulder like they usually graced her with every time she had left for Hogwarts. A soft sniffle escaped her as she hugged her brown and yellow knitted blanket closer to her body. The sounds of the railway tracks and the other students running up and down the narrow passage were distracting her from her own thoughts, and eventually managed to tug her out of the spiral of sadness.</p><p>Taking out a piece of gum from her pocket, she popped it into her mouth and decided to close the compartment blinds so she could get changed. Stripping off the polka dot sundress, she slipped into the familiar black robes, the crest of her House shining a brilliant yellow. With a satisfied smile, she unlocked her compartment door and not even a minute later, a pair of familiar ginger heads poked their way into the confined space.</p><p>"Fancy seeing you here, Vera!" The one on the left spoke, a cheeky grin spread across his freckled face.</p><p>"Quite a lovely surprise too, I believe." The carbon copy spoke, a much more dangerous glint in his eye than his twin. They both took a seat opposite her, taking up the entire bench with their legs propped up on either side of her as well, effectively caging her in.</p><p>"Fred," She nodded to the left, "George." Warmth radiated from the sight of her best friends, a happiness bubbling up in her stomach at their arrival. She hadn't had many friends, any in fact outside of Hufflepuff until she had stumbled upon them trying to outwit Peeves in their third year. She hadn't thought much about it, but had grabbed them both by the wrists and tugged them into the castle kitchens as they'd run past.</p><p>"How was your summer?" A pleasant grin worked its way onto her face, curving her mouth into a sight the Weasley twins were accustomed to.</p><p>"Bloody boring, you see -"</p><p>The rest of the ride to Hogwarts went like that; Fred and George telling her all about their holiday and how they believed they were closer than ever to perfecting their newest sweet that would leave the consumer gagging on thick slime, getting them out of class. They exited the compartment together, the boys deciding it would be fun to link their arms on either side of her. It would have been a sweet gesture if it weren't for the fact they knew Vera held a form of distinct dislike towards physical touch. She entertained it to a certain extent, but once it had gone on for too long she felt like there was a force sucking on the back of her mind, draining her almost.</p><p>However, they made it to the carriages before Vera had efficiently thrown their arms away from her and dived onto a seat. The night sky was lit up with stars, she noticed as she tilted her head upwards. Her blonde bob grazing her shoulders slightly at the motion. Fred and George were about to join her, when the Thestral pulling the carriage suddenly jerked before taking off.</p><p>"Wait, what?"</p><p>Sitting up, she turned sharply to shoot a look of confusion to the twins who looked just as disturbed as her at the sudden change in speed. The creature took a right, trees and various other flora blocking her vision of the other students. Vera didn't panic, per say, she knew there wasn't any ill will intended. Maybe the Thestral had gotten a fright, or he had decided the Weasley boys were taking too long? She wouldn't have been too surprised. There wasn't much point in getting into a frenzy over something that couldn't be changed. With that thought, she relaxed further into the comfy leather seats and silently admired the brightness of the stars as the Thestral continued to pick up speed. It took quicker than normal to reach the familiar castle, except this time she wasn't in front of the grand doors that were usually swung open in a warm welcome to the students. No, this time she was looking at a single door, which was blackened at the edges, with a polished silver handle. Hesitating, she used the carriage door to balance herself as she hopped out.</p><p>The door creaked open slowly, making her freeze as she contemplated getting back into the carriage, before swinging fully open and revealing the charming face of Professor Flitwick. He looked left and right, before his gaze seemed to fully settle on her form. There was a slight shine in his eyes as he spotted her.</p><p>"Good evening, Professor." Came the easy greeting, accompanied with a shallow curtsy like her family had taught her. A warm chuckle escaped the small man, who motioned for her to enter.</p><p>"I'm most dreadfully sorry about this, but it would seem that Headmaster Dumbledore would like to see you before the feast," He chattered happily, "Now I must say you're the politest student, nobody seems to care for etiquette like you do anymore. What a shame!"</p><p>A frown marred her face, before it was wiped back into the placid grin she preferred using.</p><p>"Am I in trouble then, Professor?"</p><p>"What? No, of course not dear." He waved off her concern, taking a faster pace as he passed through corridor after corridor until they were staring at a statue of a gargoyle.</p><p>"Gin jollies." There was a muffled groan, and flight of stairs began to unwind themselves from the floor and up and around the circular pillar.</p><p>"This is where I leave you, I'm afraid. Don't be long now, I expect you back in your common room by ten." He warned.</p><p>Vera nodded, too entranced by the sight of the moving stairs to really hear what her Head of House was saying. She tapped a foot onto the bottom stair, and slowly brought the other onto the one above it. She didn't even have to move; the staircase was just bringing her up regardless of how long it had already been unwinding for. It stopped however, when her feet hit the top and adjacent to her was the doors to the office. She hadn't actually been up here before, she had only ever been in trouble once and that was when Fred and George had decided to involve her in one of their pranks on Filtch last year. She had refused to speak to them for a week afterwards, but eventually the silence had been too much for her and she had forgiven them.</p><p>Vera knocked.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>She twisted the golden knob, and walked through. The office was definitely different, and if she were being honest she liked it. The walls were lined with bookcases in places, and they were painted with strong and vibrant colours. She spotted a phoenix perched on the edge of a table, using it's beak to clean its feathers. Her eyes roamed over the odd bits and pieces that littered the room, until eventually a cough brought her out of her thoughts and to the bearded man sitting behind his desk. Vera gave a good evening, and bopped her head.</p><p>"Yes, it rather is isn't it?" A twinkling had settled in his eye now, mischievous and something she was eager to find the source of, "I do apologise for having you brought here before the Feast, but I assure you it wasn't without great reason."</p><p>"I understand, Headmaster. Is it alright to ask why you've asked to see me though?" Her hand rested on the back of the chair opposite Dumbledore's, and turned to sit in it as he waved in direction to it.</p><p>He seemed to pause after that, a thoughtful look plastering his face, and he suddenly looked older. The lines in his forehead were deeper, and the dark circles that tinged the skin beneath his eyes were more pronounced, "I'm afraid, my dear, that what I am about to ask is no simple deed."</p><p>The silence from Vera was confirmation for him to continue. He noted that she had always been the quieter of the Ravenclaws, and preferred her own company to even her own House. It had caused a great stir when the Weasley twins had suddenly taken her in, and brought her into their own havoc. Although it wasn't much of a secret to the teaching staff that she wandered the halls during the night, and more times than not visited the House Elves to see if they needed any help.</p><p>"You see, Miss Laine, it has been brought to my attention that the war we are currently fighting, is one we aren't likely to win."</p><p>That drew a reaction from her. An ashen look fell onto her, drawing the warmth from her skin and turning it a shade paler than it was supposed to be, "I'm sorry sir, I don't seem to understand. Are you telling me, that He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named is going to win?"</p><p>"Not at all, I'm merely saying that there's a very good chance that there's going to be a lot more deaths in the future. Mine included. So much will be lost in the upcoming battles, that nobody is truly going to win. We would have lost too much. Liquorice?" He outstretched a bowl that was previously lying on the table towards her. Nodding, Vera took a piece and stuck it between her front teeth.</p><p>"So, we would win? Just that it would basically feel like an empty win?"</p><p>"Precisely."<br/>"You wanted me here to tell me that?"</p><p>"No, what I'm proposing is something I wish I would have thought of earlier, but you see in my old age things like time travel aren't at the forefront of my brain." Dumbledore said, aware of the pique of interest from the girl in front of him at his words. She was curling a strand of her short hair around her index finger, and had cocked her head to the side in a subtle show of interest.</p><p>"Time travel, sir?"</p><p>"Yes, Miss Laine. You see, it occurred to me that if Voldemort were to be ripped out at the root, we wouldn't be having this problem. If someone were to stop him, and prevent him from becoming He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named, then our lives would very much be saved."</p><p>"Him, sir?"</p><p>"Tom Riddle. The boy I want you to save."</p><p>There was a stretched silence, Vera having gone still in the plush armchair. She was aware of the piercing icy blue eyes trained on her form, that was quite simply trying to curl into itself. It would be ignorant to say Dumbledore couldn't see the fear and anxiety that was washing around in her grey orbs; the pupils were dilating, and shrinking as different thoughts flittered into her mind. On one hand, the idea of travelling through time was exciting and her feeling towards it was the reason Professor McGonagall had refrained from giving her a Time Turner in her fourth year, something about a 'reckless attitude towards the consequences.' On the other, however, a sinking sensation in her gut was dragging her elation down. She would have to befriend one of the darkest wizards that had ever lived, and not to mention change him, or rather give him a bargain so irresistible he would have to give up on his world domination.</p><p>"But sir, I don't think I would be able to last a month, quite honestly." The blonde eventually stated, the familiar smile now jaded as a dark narration began in her head of all the possible ways she could die from this mission, as Dumbledore had called it.</p><p>"Nonsense, I wouldn't have asked you here if I thought you would so easily fail." Another twinkle flashed in his iris, as he picked a liquorice up and chewed on it, "I would daresay you are one of the few people who I believe could accomplish this."</p><p>"Really? Me?"</p><p>Dumbledore hummed in confirmation, standing up swiftly and moving to the cabinet nearest the phoenix. He unlocked it with a wave of his wand, before opening one of the drawers and reaching in. A satin jewellery box lay on his palm, as he approached her. It was placed on the desk in front of her, the lid easing up by itself to reveal the cylinder of bronze. Vera frowned, as her fingers closed around it. The design was different to the Time Turner she had glimpsed around Hermione's neck on multiple occasions. Hers had been surrounded by double circlets of gold, whilst this was an ordinary looking hourglass on a chain. Inside the bottom chamber were grains of sparkling cream dust, which seemed to add a certain level of class to the pendant.</p><p>"It's quite a beautiful thing, isn't it, Miss Laine?"</p><p>Removed from her observations, she nodded towards her Headmaster. There was a knowing smile slathered on his mouth at her curiosity, and it was then he was certain that she was already halfway convinced to go back in time. It was common knowledge that the reserved Ravenclaw had a weakness for certain objects, especially ones that were ancient.</p><p>"I've used it myself, you see." He spoke, moving to pet the phoenix now nuzzling at his knuckles which brushed down the creature's feathers, "The outcome of the battle ahead is one that I wish to avoid altogether."</p><p>Vera heard the tone of desperation in his voice, and as much as he was trying to hide it, he was pleading with her. She rocked on her hips, bringing her spine to the back of the chair she was resting in. It had suddenly struck her that her butt had gone numb from how long she had been sitting down, "If I were to do this, Professor Dumbledore, what exactly would I be getting myself into?"</p><p>"Well, as you might guess, you would end up in approximately 1943, to the year Mr Riddle first opened the Chamber of Secrets. I believe that was what ultimately changed him. You would be expected to act as any other sixth year student, however you would be trying to work your way into Riddle's close circle and befriend him."</p><p>Vera pursed her lips. It didn't sound too challenging, but it was most likely how Dumbledore had phrased it, like it was as simple as walking to the shops to buy a chocolate bar. There was just one more thing she needed to ask.</p><p>"I won't be able to come back, will I?"</p><p>She was met with a stunned silence, one smothered from guilt judging by the expression she caught filtering onto the face of the grey wizard. He sighed, eyes dropping from hers.</p><p>"No, Miss Laine. It is incredibly straining to warp even the most skilled wizard or witch into more than ten years into the past or future. You will be going back almost fifty. Forcing your body to go backwards will have you bedridden, but trying to come forward again will kill you."</p><p>Vera flicked at the Time Turner, her eyes glazing over. She wasn't surprised, if she were totally honest. She was expecting there would be some kind of catch to the entire thing, otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't be begging her to go. He understood what he was asking, and how much of a risk it was in the first place. It was for the greater good, as he always said. A bitter feeling rose in her throat, and sizzled at the back of her tongue. He knew about the multiple trips to the Hospital Wing, the reason why she was never allowed back home during the holidays besides summer, he knew she didn't have much of a reason to say no.</p><p>Rejecting, and staying in her own time would be akin to emotional suicide. She had friends, namely Fred and George, but she knew they didn't need her. They would most likely wonder where she had gone, and mope around for a week before springing back into action. The twins were her best friends, but she wasn't theirs. She had been perfectly content with that, but now she wasn't so sure.</p><p>She had a family; three older brothers, one younger sister, and all five of them adopted. Her adoptive parents were kind, but hadn't known exactly what they were getting into when they signed off on her birth certificate to stake their claim on her. They were muggles, and truthfully her magic was the sole reason there had been a wall building between them since her acceptance letter came.</p><p>"Alright, Professor Dumbledore. I'll go."</p><p>A grateful, yet guilty smile was all she got in return.</p>
