    <p>She watched carefully for a few days, noting how the small boy worked around the house. At night she could hear the beatings he had to endure. She knew it was time to step in and fix things. She waited until the fat male muggle left for the day. The horse-faced woman with her miniature version of her spouse left shortly afterward. She waited another ten minutes and entered the house. The house smelled of cleaning fluids and polish.</p><p>She looked around the boring house, with everything in its place. She knew where the young boy was. She had heard enough times about the muggles yelling for him to get to his cupboard. She knocked on the door to the cupboard. "Harry, how would you like to leave?" She could smell the blood.</p><p>"Who's there?" A timid voice asked. She wasn't sure if Harry knew Harry was his name. She had heard the neighbors' speaking about how they called him boy or freak, never a real name. </p><p>"I will explain that in a bit, but do you wish to escape?" </p><p>"Yes." Was quietly said. "Any place is better than here." </p><p>She mentally agreed with that statement and opened the door to the cupboard. "Hello, Harry. I am called Morgen." She ignored the blood, the bruises, and the smell. She focused on getting out of the cupboard without causing him pain. When she had him out of the cupboard, she said "Harry, I am going to immobilize you, so that I won't cause any damage when I move you. So don't be afraid."</p><p>"What does that mean?" Harry asked, his curiosity coming out.</p><p>"It means I am going to prevent you from moving or causing any movement to hurt you." Morgen gave him a reassuring smile as she waved her hand at him. While she was at it, she added a nice little obscure curse to the house, one to make any adult who hurt Harry have nightmares each night and to find food taste like sawdust, their clothes to never be seen as clean, their bodies never to without some kind of pain.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Five years later:</p><p>"Mom, it's here, look, it's here." Harry was waving his Hogwarts letter as he entered the breakfast nook off of the kitchen. The table could hold six people and it was usually where they had their meals unless they had guests. Harry's long black hair was pulled off of his face, in a leather tie, you could see his jade-colored eyes, and there wasn't a scar on his forehead any longer. He wore a white shirt and black trousers under an open green robe. He didn't need to wear glasses.</p><p>"Harry, come and sit down, we can read it afterward. Did you wake up Severus?" Morgen was already at the table with her cup of tea. Melon, the house-elf, was putting the food on the table. Morgen was not usually a morning person, she preferred to be up at night, but since she took Harry as her son, she became a morning person.</p><p>"He did." Severus was holding the newspaper in one hand while he used his other to guide Harry to his seat in the average size room, despite its name.</p><p>"Ares ate the last of the owl treats." Harry gave Melon a wave good morning.</p><p>Severus wore a white shirt with a green vest and black trouser with his black robes over them. "We can go shopping later today. I already planned on going to get some potion ingredients and I needed to pick up those books I ordered." He took his seat and Melon placed a cup of coffee down on the table for him. "Thank you, Melon."</p><p>"May I help you with the potions for the Infirmary?" Harry took his seat as he was taking a sip of his orange juice.</p><p>"You may. Do you want to see if Draco, Theo, and Blaise want to meet you in Diagon Alley? I am sure Draco will ask the others." Severus asked. Severus had arrived at his aunt's manor, where he lived during the holidays, to find her healing Harry Potter five years ago today. "Do you know what you want for your birthday?"</p><p>"Will that new potion or defense book be released by my birthday?" Harry asked after he finished chewing his eggs.</p><p>"No, but I have already pre-ordered them for each of you." Morgen grinned at her favorite boys. She always made sure they got the latest books in regards to their favorite subjects. She wasn't sure who was more into potions or defense, Severus or Harry. She knew Harry and Severus could spend hours on each subject.</p><p>"Thank you, but that is all I can think of, for my presents. How about we go out to dinner?" Harry never had a birthday party or presents until Morgen rescued him. Each year they had celebrated it, and Harry still never asked for anything big, he usually liked books or if he was learning something new, like when he was learning how to draw, he wanted some color pencils and paints. He didn't like being the center of attention. Draco enjoyed that role, but Harry was the one with the brains of the group. The boy was cunning too. Severus usually called him, his little snake.</p><p>Severus smiled, he was proud of Harry. He had spent last night reading the list of stuff his godson had wanted for his birthday a few weeks ago. Lucius had shown the list to him as a way of Severus aiding Lucius in picking out a good gift for his godson, Harry. He thought back to Harry's first month with them. </p><p>************Flashback begins********************************************</p><p>Severus knocked on Harry's bedroom door and entered the room. The boy was still sleeping as he expected he would be. Each morning, they had to assist Harry in getting out of bed and helping him get ready for the day. His back and legs were recovering slowly because of the damage inflicted by his relatives, but he was recovering. The bruises and broken bones had been healed. He made sure to make noise as he walked, as he didn't want to startle him. </p><p>When Severus had gotten home from gathering some potion ingredients, he had found Morgen chanting a healing spell over Harry. They had worked for hours healing the small, battered, bruised and broken form of Harry Potter. Severus had to wait up with Harry the first twenty-four hours, as they couldn't give him any pain potions while the Skele-Gro worked on fixing the missing bones they had to banish. "Brat, you want to get up now?" He said gently. He knew loud voices scared Harry. They found that out the hard way when Severus had yelled for Morgen to bring him some more bruise paste and Harry, in fear, fell off of the couch trying to escape from Severus, during his second day. They were afraid to move Harry off of the couch to a room until they knew he was stable enough to be moved without causing more damage.</p><p>"Sev'rus?" Harry was slowly waking up. He opened his emerald colored eyes, his brown hair sticking up at all angles.</p><p>"Yes, I locked Morgen in her room, so that I could get you ready for the day. I bet she already escaped and is down in the kitchen, having Melon making us some breakfast so we can join her in the breakfast nook if you are up for it." Severus told him as he started to pull clothing out of the wardrobe for Harry to wear. The wardrobe was near the bathroom door, which was opposite the bedroom door. There were two big comfortable forest green wingback chairs by the windows, with a table between them, on the same wall as the wardrobe, the bed was on the east wall, it had forest green sheets and blankets with matching curtains around the bed, they were currently tied back to the posts. The west wall had a desk with a chair and a bookcase for Harry to use. </p><p>He had already revamped the nutrition potions for Harry and he could see Harry had grown a bit. He was going to see if he could find a way to improve it, and one to help Harry get some of his muscle mass back. They had already fixed his eyesight. "We will need to get you some new clothes soon. I think you are outgrowing these."</p><p>They had just bought a few muggle outfits for Harry to wear until they could get him well. They wanted soft materials, that were easy to wear. Severus and Morgen bought some lightweight exercise clothing and some sleepwear, in the age of a three-year-old size, for Harry until he grew a bit and they could take him shopping.</p><p>"I'm sorry." Harry quietly said, looking down, his hands twisting in the blanket. He didn't want to get into trouble for growing.</p><p>Severus took the clothes and walked back to Harry. "Harry that is a good thing. We want you to grow." Severus reassured him. "It's also why wizard clothing as growth charms on them, unlike the muggle ones." He gave him a slight smile. If anyone from Hogwarts saw Severus now or how he usually behaved at home, they would think it was someone poly-juice. "Your birthday is coming up, do you know what you want?"</p><p>Harry looked at him, confused. "My birthday? I don't have one. My Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon said freaks like me don't get birthdays or Christmas presents. They said St. Nicholas would have no idea who I am. Freaks don't count as normal people do." </p><p>Severus could almost hear exactly how his relatives would have told Harry that bit of information. "First, I would prefer you not to refer to yourself as a freak. Wizards and you are a wizard, are not freaks. I am a wizard, and I don't consider myself a freak, Morgen is a witch and I know she isn't a freak. Second, anything your relatives have told you is wrong. Ignore anything they have called you, told you in regards to your behavior and certainly in regards to how you dress. Third, your birthday is the 31st of July, you will be six." He gave him a wiggle with his eyebrows, causing Harry to laugh a bit.</p><p>Harry gave him a sly smile as Severus pulled back the sheet and a lightweight blanket that was covering him. "Now how about we do your morning physical therapy, a bath, and breakfast? After breakfast, I do believe Morgen wants to go and visit Gringotts."</p><p>"Is that the goblin place?" Harry asked as he handed Severus a pillow to use for Severus' knees. Severus worked on getting Harry into the correct position. Harry used the daily routine helped as much as he could. </p><p>"Yes, remember she mentioned about blood adopting you." Severus knelt on the pillow, pulled out his potion bag, grabbed the container of muscle rub and started working on Harry's legs. "How do your legs and back feel?"</p><p>"I was able to move them without pain this morning." Harry answered him. "I didn't get up or anything like you said. I did call Melon to help me to the washroom earlier." He liked the little house elf, she played games with him during the day when Severus and Morgen couldn't be there with him.</p><p>"Good boy. I bet in another week, you will be running down the halls, with me telling you to walk." Severus said as he began to move the left leg, lifting it up, stretching the muscles. "You tell me if it hurts, remember our deal." </p><p>"I will. It doesn't." Harry told him. Harry was a bit surprised the first time Severus told him he wanted to know if he was in pain. No one ever cared if he was in pain before. They made a deal if Harry always said when he was in pain during the day, at the end of the day, they would read an extra story to him. "I told you yesterday when it hurt after we walked across the room."</p><p>"Yes you did." Severus gave him an encouraging smile. He continued on with the exercises as he explained what was going to happen today. Morgen already explained but they found that Harry liked listening to their voices during the physical therapy. "When we go to Diagon Alley, you will be under a glamour. Did you decide on what color hair and eyes you want?"</p><p>"Yes." Harry told him. "I want black hair like you and Morgen and brown eyes too." </p><p>"I believe we can arrange that." Severus figured that Harry would want to look like them. They were the first people that Harry could remember ever caring about him. They hadn't spoken about his real parents except to say they didn't die in a drunken car crash like his relatives told him.</p><p>Several hours later, Severus was carrying Harry through the floo and met Morgen in the main room of the Leaky Cauldron. They didn't speak as they began their trek to Gringotts. Harry had his head resting on Severus' shoulder. Morgen quietly said to Severus as they reached the white entrance to Gringotts. "We are followed."</p><p>"I am aware. It's Molly Weasley." Severus knew the woman was wondering who was in Severus' arms and who Morgen was. They had already worked out that Severus was going to say that Morgen was his aunt, she really was his many times over great aunt, and that Harry was her son. They had arrived in England and they went to Gringotts to set up their vaults if anyone saw them. Severus wasn't expecting it to be Molly, anyone else would have just seen them and been happy to pass on the details. Molly would want to find out more information. </p><p>"Nosy woman." Morgen stated. They stood in line waiting for the next available teller when Molly entered the building. Molly watched as they were finally able to speak to a teller. Morgen quietly asked to speak to Ragnok, her account manager. They were soon escorted into Ragnok's office. </p><p>Ragnok looked at Morgen and gave her a small smile. "I see you were able to save him from his relatives." Many wizards weren't aware that the goblins kept a careful eye on the important wizards in their magical world. Harry Potter was one such wizard.</p><p>"Yes, just in time too. I want to do a blood adoption on him. Is there a way to hide it until at least the wards fall at his relatives' house?" </p><p>"We can hide it so it's never found. There will be no reason to associate Harry with your new son. We will switch all the accounts except for the Potter Trust and the Potter Family vaults to his new name. We will add blood security wards to the existing Potter vaults, which will stop anyone from trying to claim them before your son is of age." Ragnok told her. "Mr. Dumbledore is his current magical guardian, but we have kept him out of the vaults so far, and the blood security will guarantee it."</p><p>"I made the potion, already, but I would like a health scan on him, checking for any binds or compulsions on Harry." Severus told him. They had already discussed the possibility that the old fool bound Harry's magic. They had already warned Harry that he might need a ritual purge. As long as they explained things to Harry, he was accepting of it.</p><p>Ragnok started pulling out the items needed for a blood test. "I would suggest an Inheritance Test too, many left things to Harry Potter after their deaths." </p><p>"Please." Morgen said she gave Harry a slight smile. "Will we have to do this later if anyone else left anything to him?"</p><p>"No, once we have his new name, we will automatically update anything that is left to him." Ragnok explained.</p><p>"Harry, Ragnok is going to need a bit of your blood. He is just going to need three drops, so he will stick your finger with a silver knife, it will sting but it won't last long." Severus told the boy who was sitting in his lap, watching Ragnok closely. Severus had felt Harry tense when he mentioned the word blood.</p><p>"Promise?" Harry asked, never taking his eyes off of Ragnok.</p><p>"I promise." Ragnok told him. "What I am going to do is add the three drops of blood into this bowl with some potion ingredients. We use knotgrass-" he held up the knotgrass "doxie wings-" he pointed to the doxie wings, "thyme, mountain dew with some fresh frog's liver." He pointed to each ingredient he named. "I use this crystal" he held up a clear crystal, "to absorb the potion. When it's filled, I can tell when it's done because it will turn green, I will place it on this parchment. The parchments have been soaked in a special solution, that will provide us with anything you have inherited." </p><p>"Can we make this potion?" Harry asked Severus. That sounded like a fun thing to make. He had been reading some of the potions in the first level potion kit that Severus had gotten him the day before.</p><p>"It's may, and we can make it but it only works with their parchments soak in their special solution. We can, however, make a genealogy potion later." </p><p>Soon they were staring at Harry's Inheritance Test and Magical Report.</p><p>Harry James Potter</p><p>Father: James Charles Potter<br/>

Core-Horcrux of Tom Marvolo Riddle</p><p>"What is a Horcrux?" Severus knew Harry would be a Lord at sixteen because he was the last of his line, so he was allowed to become a Lord earlier than twenty-one. </p><p>"Soul magic, very dark soul magic." Morgen replied. When Severus looked at her, he noticed how pale she looked, she looked like she was going to be sick. "Can you remove it?"</p><p>"Yes, we actually thought it was already removed. Mr. Dumbledore informed us that it would be removed." Ragnok stated, looking down at the results. He knew a lot of goblins were going to be upset that it wasn't removed. Soul Magic was dark magic and to leave a piece of someone's soul in another being wasn't something they didn't think anyone would do. "I will get the purging ritual set up. We can unblock everything and get Harry to his rightful self."</p><p>After Ragnok left, Morgen picked up the parchment and read through it. "Harry, can you go and play over in the corner while I talk to Severus." </p><p>"Sure." Harry got off of Severus' lap and Morgen summoned some stuff animals for him to play with while they talked. She cast a quick privacy ward. "I can't believe he did this. Does he not realize what would have happened had Harry turned eleven with these restrictions on his core?"</p><p>"I don't think he cares. It seems to me he was setting up Harry to be his little weapon. He keeps mentioning how the Dark Lord is going to return." Severus wasn't sure if the Dark Lord was defeated or not, he knew his mark never went away. Dumbledore told him it was a sign that the Dark Lord wasn't deceased.</p><p>"He knows Harry has a Horcrux in him, the scar has to be it. I know you said he told you it was a cursed scar. I think it's actually from the Horcrux. Horcruxes will allow the Dark Lord to return. He can't die as long as they exist. He needs to do a ritual to get a new body, but he is out there." Morgen replied.</p><p>"If he didn't remove the Horcrux, did he expect the Dark Lord to use Harry to come back?" Severus asked.</p><p>"No, most likely the Dark Lord doesn't even know. He must have others. I am thinking he was going to use Harry later on to find the other Horcrux or Horcruxes. Horcruxes can sense each other. Judging how he wanted Harry to be raised, Dumbledore most likely wants Harry to do a final battle with the Dark Lord and willingly walk to his death, thus killing the Horcrux in Harry. Dumbledore would work on forming a mentoring bond with Harry. As an abused child, Harry would have viewed him as a savior, since he would provide an escape from the Dursley family, even it was just for the school year."</p><p>"Killing Harry at the same time." Severus knew he looked as pale Morgen did, they were sick to their stomachs with the very idea of what Dumbledore was willing to do in the name of the greater good. Allowing a child to be abused, allowing him to remain with a piece of another person's soul in them, and in the future to have them killed. "I can't resign, not if we want to keep an eye on him. You know he will not stop looking for Harry. He will do whatever is necessary for his greater good."</p><p>"I agree. Question is, how insane do you think the Dark Lord is? Will he be stable when he returns?" Morgen asked.</p><p>"Are you going to look for him? I know you can handle him." Severus arched his left brow at her. She was the chosen one for Dark Magic. Merlin was also a dark wizard, but he didn't like a woman being in charge.</p><p>"I won't look for him. I will aid you and him when the time is right, I want to make sure Dumbledore is too busy looking for Mr. Potter before the Dark Lord returns." Morgen told him. Before Severus could reply Ragnok returned and told them the ritual room was ready.</p><p>Several hours later, they left Gringotts, with Hendrick Urien Moryen le Fey, Harry le Fey for short, who now had black hair like Morgen and Severus and his eyes were now jade, and a light red area around his former scar, that would be gone by the end of the day.</p><p>*************End Flashback**************</p><p>Harry opened his letter after he finished eating. He started reading it. "No snakes?" He questioned Severus. He thought snakes were allowed.</p><p>"Yes, a new policy the Headmaster started last year. However, you can bring Paris and Helena with you. I will say they are for potion ingredients if he asks. He allows other students to have unofficial pets, one student has a tarantula." Severus told him. "Which reminds me, we need to buy some mice for them today." He added mice to the mental list of stuff to pick up.</p><p>"Remember no hissing around anyone who isn't a snake already. You know Dumbledore will have a fit if you do." Morgen was a speaker also and taught Harry how to use parselmagic. They taught Severus a few words in the language.</p><p>"I know. Only my friends know and they won't tell anyone." Harry continued reading the list. "I can bring more than the books on my list? This list isn't very long and won't take me long to read as we already have a few of them."</p><p>"Yes, you may. We will get you a trunk with a library compartment in it." Severus told him. "I think they have a few different sizes ones, we will have to get you one of the bigger trunks, but you can also put books in my quarters. Your room will still be there, I did add another bookcase in it." Usual Harry only spent the weekends or odd nights at Hogwarts with Severus or if Morgen had to travel. </p><p>"Go, floo Draco and anyone else you want to meet you in Diagon Alley. We will leave here after lunch." Morgen instructed.</p>
