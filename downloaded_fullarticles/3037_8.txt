    <p>As Hermione drove her tiny sedan through the tree-lined streets, she felt her spirits lift at the promise of another semester at Hogwarts University. Her first two semesters had been nothing but memorable, and she was looking forward to making more memories with her best friends, Ron and Harry. She could tell that there was going to be something about this fall; something different from the past that made her extremely optimistic.</p>
<p>Until a herd of freshman pledges darted out in front of her car, forcing her to slam on the brakes. Freshmen always moved in a week before the rest of campus, and fraternities always used that early arrival as an opportunity to get all the stupidity of pledgeship started early. </p>
<p>“Goddamnit!” she hissed, listening to her belongings rattle in her trunk. </p>
<p>It was obvious to her which fraternity the group of boys was pledging; the only fraternity on campus who could get away with such open hazing was Delta Theta Iota. The Deltas, as they were known, were top house on campus and were extraordinarily brutal to their pledges. They also were known for some of the cruelest pranks on campus, especially around Homecoming. And rumor had it that Harry and Ron’s fraternity, Delta Nu Chi, was on the top of the Deltas’ hit list that year.</p>
<p>Hermione herself stayed out of Greek Life; her freshman year roommate, Lavender, had joined one of the top sororities on campus and had tried to harangue Hermione into rushing, but she had refused. Instead, Hermione had applied to become a Resident Advisor and would be supervising a whole floor of sophomore girls, Lord help her.</p>
<p>When she pulled up to the dormitory, admiring its traditional Georgian architecture, she noticed a gaggle freshmen were surrounding two figures who were standing beside two scooters. One had a mop of unruly black hair and was leaning against a brand-new Vespa, while the other had shaggy red hair and an older scooter he’d inherited from his older brothers.</p>
<p>“Harry, Ron!” Hermione shouted once she’d parked her car and climbed out. </p>
<p>“Hey, ‘Mione!” Harry called, making his way through his little circle of admirers to embrace her. Ron followed closely behind, though he kept a slight distance from Hermione.</p>
<p>They both had lost their virginities to the other very early on during freshman year, but any attempts to date and become seriously involved had blown up in Ron and Hermione’s faces. Despite the awkwardness, they had agreed to remain friends. </p>
<p>“Thanks for agreeing to help me move in,” she told them as she walked around her car to pop the trunk. “It would have taken me ages to lug these boxes up to my room.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it,” Harry grinned, grabbing a box and lifting it out of her trunk. “It’s the least we can do.” Ron nodded in agreement before taking a box as well. Hermione shouldered her backpack and led them up to the dorm. It was quiet overall, save for the first two floors that housed freshman girls and their RAs. The sophomores wouldn’t be arriving until tomorrow, which gave Hermione time to get settled and put their door decorations up and everything. </p>
<p>“So,” Hermione began, dusting off her hands when they’d finally gotten every box up to her room. “When’s the first party of the year?”</p>
<p>Harry scratched the back of his head. “I dunno, actually,” he admitted.</p>
<p>“Riddle has been plotting to ruin our first party, apparently,” Ron explained. “He’s got it out for Harry ever since we trashed their homecoming float last year.”</p>
<p>“I see,” she hummed. </p>
<p>Tom Riddle Jr. was the president of Delta Theta Iota and while Ron and Harry loathed him Hermione could admit she didn’t have much of an opinion one way or the other about him. He was a political science major, and he’d taken a few English classes that Hermione had been in. Overall, he was respectable, if not a bit of a schmoozer. They’d gotten into a fierce debate concerning Hamlet and whether or not the title character deserved the soldier’s burial Fortinbras ordered he have, but he was smart and good at voicing his opinions. Hermione could not fault him for that. </p>
<p>“I honestly don’t see why he bothers with terrorizing the other fraternities,” Ron huffed.</p>
<p>“I don’t see why Dumbledore lets him get away with it,” Harry added. </p>
<p>Hermione started unpacking her sheets and making her bed before she spoke. “Dumbledore has a lot more to worry about than one unruly fraternity,” she pointed out. “Especially when that fraternity has had no incidents of sexual assault and the top Greek GPA on campus.”</p>
<p>Naturally, Harry simply shrugged off her reasoning, but Ron spluttered in protest as he fiddled with Hermione’s printer.</p>
<p>“You’re actually defending him!” he whined. “You’re defending Tom-fucking-Riddle!”</p>
<p>“Considering I don’t know the man it would be wrong of me to condemn him personally just because his fraternity does bad things,” she said. “And those bad things are, unfortunately, not just performed by Delta but by most fraternities on this campus in the name of ‘tradition.’”</p>
<p>“‘Mione’s got a point,” Harry told Ron. </p>
<p>But Ron, of course, wasn’t really going to listen to Hermione speak reason about the Deltas. The rivalry between the Deltas and the Chis went back years, and Ron knew more about the rivalry than most. He came from a long line of Chis, including all of his older brothers, his father, grandfather and so on. So at times the rivalry could get a bit personal for him.</p>
<p>“Well,” Ron huffed, “if Hermione is so close with good old Tommy then maybe she’ll get an invitation to the Deltas’ party tonight.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid, Ron,” Hermione rolled her eyes. “I’ll be getting my room set up and preparing for my residents to arrive tomorrow.” Softly to herself she added, “As if any of them find me attractive enough to let me in...”</p>
<p>Once Hermione had assured Harry that she could handle the rest of her things herself, he and Ron left her. Ever the busybody, Hermione had her room all neat and organized in a little under an hour. Checking her phone, she realized she still had a few hours before the dining hall would open for dinner, so she grabbed her wallet and keys and headed to her favorite coffee shop on campus, Honeydukes Brew. </p>
<p>The cozy, bohemian coffee shop was fairly crowded with students who had likely stayed in Hogsmeade for the summer or with members of the Greek community who had moved in early to prepare for fall recruitment. </p>
<p>“What can I get you?” the middle-aged woman working the counter asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, a medium iced coffee, please,” Hermione told her. </p>
<p>She waited off to the side to get her drink, and when she had it in her hands she was in such a hurry to get back to the dorms that she hadn’t been paying any attention to her surroundings. After quickly pivoting in the direction of the small circular table that held sugar, creamer and other necessities, Hermione crashed into a rather tall figure. The flimsy lid that kept her coffee contained popped off and she accidentally emptied almost all the cup’s contents onto a linen shirt. </p>
<p>“Shit!” Hermione exclaimed, reaching for a napkin to dab at the stranger’s shirt. “I am so, so sorry...”</p>
<p>“You’re... You’re Harry Potter’s friend, aren’t you?” </p>
<p>Hermione looked up slowly at the victim of her clumsiness and felt her face grow warm. Tom Riddle was looking down at her with an expression that could only be one of amusement. She was happy he wasn’t angry, but the smirk on his face made her extremely uneasy. </p>
<p>He was tanner than he’d been in the class they’d shared second semester last year, but he was still rather fair-skinned. His hair was as black as ever, though, and was pushed back slightly due to the classic Ray Bans on the top of his head. Emerald green eyes twinkled down at her playfully, and all Hermione could think about was how small she felt in his presence.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she answered. “And you’re Tom Riddle.”</p>
<p>He crossed his arms and silently appraised her. It made her uneasy, especially when she was wearing her oldest pair of Birkenstocks, a well-worn Hogwarts University shirt and simple running shorts. She didn’t look like she’d just walked off the runway at Ralph Lauren’s Spring/Summer show. </p>
<p>“You were in my Shakespeare class last semester.” It wasn’t a question, but Hermione still felt compelled to answer him.</p>
<p>“Yes, I was,” she confirmed. “We had a... lively debate about Hamlet.”</p>
<p>“I remember,” Tom stated, still looking her over. “What are you doing tonight... Hermione, is it?” She nodded. “What are you doing tonight, Hermione? I don’t suppose the Chis are having their party tonight, are they?”</p>
<p>“No,” she replied. “They actually, um, aren’t sure when they’re going to have their first party.”</p>
<p>“Well that means you’re free to come party at Delta tonight.” He grinned devilishly. “The party starts at ten and will go... well, until we say it’s over.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s heart thudded rapidly in her chest. Did Tom Riddle really just invite her to come to a Delta party? Surely she was hallucinating. She wasn’t the kind of girl who was invited to party with the Deltas; even Lavender had struggled to find her way into a Delta party and Lavender was your typical cut-and-paste blonde sorority girl. Hermione was brunette, petite and a bit awkward, even if she did have a decent enough body and a nice smile. She wondered if Riddle had an ulterior motive for inviting her and bit her lip.</p>
<p>“Can I bring a friend?” she asked, thinking of Ron’s younger sister who happened to be one of the freshmen living in her building. </p>
<p>“Depends,” Tom hummed. “Is she pretty?”</p>
<p>Hermione pictured Ginny and nodded; Ron’s tall, athletic sister with long red hair and clear blue eyes... Ginny seemed more the type to party with a top house than Hermione.</p>
<p>“Then I don’t see why not,” he said. “I’ll see you tonight.”</p>
<p>By the time Riddle had walked out of the coffee shop, Hermione had all but forgotten about her spilled drink.</p>
