    <p>"You should cut your losses, Potter. She's never going to take you seriously." </p><p>Harry glanced up from his defense essay to gauge Ron's mood, "maybe, but in the end it won't matter. Because she'll know she can do better than you."</p><p>Ron scowled, "she's just a muggleborn. She won't have much choice in the matter."</p><p>"That's only true if you manage to trick her into bed and get her pregnant, which I don't see happening as she is currently in the Infirmary having a charm placed to prevent it." Harry scratched the final line of his essay, and then cast a quick drying charm Hermione had taught him. </p><p>"How did you know that?" there's desperation in Ron's voice as he leapt to his feet, chair almost toppling over. "And why did you tell her?" </p><p>"My mother was a muggleborn, Ron." The defense texts were shifted to one side to make room for his bag enabling Harry to pull out his Herbology book and another roll of blank parchment. He still had one more essay to finish before the start of class on Monday.</p><p>"Everyone knows your mother was a muggleborn. Why does that matter?" </p><p>"While I might not have my parents with me, they made sure I wouldn't be completely unprepared as I neared the age to claim my title." A scrap of parchment with his outline written on it shortens the time it takes to locate the correct section covering Fanged Geraniums, and Harry begins to flesh out the information in order to have a balanced essay. </p><p>"Stop ignoring me!" </p><p>Harry lays down his quill with a sigh, "I haven't been ignoring you, Ron; I've just got things to do." A quick look towards Madame Pince lets him know he won't have to deal with the red-head much longer. The librarian has been headed their way at steady pace since he shouted, but she seems to have been waylaid by a group of Hufflepuffs.</p><p>"Well?" Ron crosses his arms across his chest.<br/>
</p><p>"Well, what?"</p><p>"Don't play stupid, Potter. Why did you tell her about getting pregnant or anything really?"</p><p>"Hermoine found me reading a letter left in my vault," Harry began, "when I finished explaining how my parents wanted to ensure I knew an unplanned pregnancy before bonding was basically a one-way ticket to a shot-gun wedding she was horrified. The idea of being forced to bond to whoever got her pregnant wasn't even the worst part for her." </p><p>A small smirk was aimed Ron's way, "She was practically ill when she realized whoever she ended up with would most likely have control over her educational and work goals for the rest of her life. Hermoine decided then and there that she would never be in such a situation, and immediately marched off to get a permission slip for the preventative charm from Madame Pomfrey." </p><p>Ron was vibrating with barely suppressed fury, "I can't believe you."</p><p>"I don't know why this is a surprise to you. She's my best friend, and I'd never withhold information from her that could help her. She even asked me to help her compose a questionnaire for anyone she is considering dating." He leaned back in his chair as he considered his dormmate.</p><p>"We're best friends, Harry," </p><p>He interrupts Ron, "no, we're not. We haven't been best friends since fourth year, you just didn't notice."</p><p>Madame Pince has finished with the second group who stopped her, and is almost to them when Ron leans over the table with an ugly look, "You've ruined everything." </p><p>"For you, maybe."</p><p>"Mr. Weasley, that will be quite enough. Ten points from Gryffindor for disturbing others, and you'll need to vacate the library." She turns expecting him to follow her back towards the entrance. Ron scowls at him once more before stomping after her.</p><p>"Do you think either of them will figure it out?" Draco asks as he steps around the corner of the shelves.</p><p>Harry shakes his head, "I doubt it. Ron has never been in my vault, and Hermoine once told me I was 'without an ounce of guile'." </p><p>"That's absolute bullshit, Potter," </p><p>"I thought we agreed to call each other by our first names when we started plotting against our enemies together?" Harry murmurs as he begins rifling through his bag. "While I have you here, will you send this to your mother?" he presents the unsealed letter to Draco.</p><p>Draco scowls at him as he snags the letter from across the table, "stop writing my mother, Harry. She's started to complain she hears from you more than me."</p><p>"It's just a note thanking your mother for writing and sending the letter so quickly. You should write her more often so she doesn't decide she likes me better." His snort and a shake of his head have Harry huffing a small laugh. "Anyway, I'm sure Hermione would have noticed any lingering charmwork on the parchment if I had disguised the handwriting that way."</p><p>"She is clever," he concedes, "So what's next now that you've protected her from the most obvious means of trapping her in a marriage."</p><p>"I figure I'll help her with her 'intentions questionnaire' and do my best to wheedle my way into her affections." </p><p>"Oh, I'm sure that'll be hard," Draco says sarcastically.</p>
