</p><p align="justify">Hermione raised her eyes from the teacup she was holding in her hands to glance at the Headmistress.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know, Minerva. Last time he nearly hexed me,” she sighed.</p><p align="justify">“And yet, you are the only one who can get close enough to him. But this time is worse. He raised the protective wards, and no-one can penetrate them. No-one but you, that is.” Minerva looked tired, the age pronounced on her face more than usual. “He is injured and in the need of care. I am willing to give you paid leave, as much as it is needed.”</p><p align="justify">“You do realise that my original wish was to be a barrister or a politician—someone who will change this world for the better?” she replied half in annoyance, half sad.</p><p align="justify">These words were not fair, and she knew it. It was her choice to train as a potioneer, specialising at healing potions. Soon after the war was over, she realised that nothing would ever change, so she decided to choose the field that would allow her to make a difference. But at this moment, it wasn’t about fairness; it was about self-preservation.  </p><p align="justify">“Nonsense, and we both know it.” Minerva made a dismissive gesture. “I know what is this all about, and trust me—I wouldn’t ask if there is any other way.”</p><p align="justify">“He will start asking questions, you know. He will question why am I the only one who can go through his barrier.” Hermione tried, one last desperate attempt to wriggle out of what appeared to be an inescapable task.</p><p align="justify">“He won’t. No one, not even Severus Snape, knows how exactly a Life Debt works. To be honest, no one was willing to go to such lengths to save someone in a very long time.”</p><p align="justify">“Do you judge me for what I’ve done?” She blinked at the Headmistress. It never occurred to her that Minerva of all people could be resentful about what she did.</p><p align="justify">“No, and I never did. But even if that is not the case, who am I to defy the wants of one's heart?” Minerva smiled at her.  </p><p align="justify">“When I saved him I wasn’t—” She suddenly stopped, realising what Headmistress had just said.</p><p align="justify">“Oh my dear, I’ve known you since you were a wee lass. Besides, it is quite obvious for all that care to see.”   </p><p align="justify">She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. <em> This was meant to be my secret. </em></p><p align="justify">“And, even if I can’t understand, I do believe that both you and that stubborn mule do deserve happiness.” Minerva sounded nostalgic.</p><p align="justify">“Impossible...” she whispered, more to herself than to give a comment to Minerva’s words.</p><p align="justify">“There is still hope my dear girl. He may still open his eyes and notice the gem he has as his fiercest champion.”</p><p align="justify">Hermione's heart fluttered before decided to impersonate the raisin and shrink. Pain spread through her chest like acid. She had to take a few deep breaths to suppress the quiver in her voice.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, and then we could live happily ever after—me, him and the memory of Lily.” She spat out the words, sounding bitter even to herself.</p><p align="justify">“His memory of Lily is just that—a memory, one that he still holds on to. He is as fragile as any of us, and she is his shield. Even he can’t stay eternally indifferent to all that you do for him.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, he isn’t indifferent—make no mistake about it. He despises me for it.” Now, her voice quivered. <em> I won’t start crying, not in front of Minerva, not now. </em></p><p align="justify">“My dear girl, you studied Potions! You took his place in this school in every sense of that word. You gave the piece of yourself to him and to this school for him. You have forgone your own house and became the Head of Slytherin—” Minerva accused, and Hermione raised her head.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, and I can’t leave my house unattended.” The shimmer of hope filled her chest, making her heart cramp in pain, shame flooding her for forgetting about her students.  </p><p align="justify">“Draco offered to replace you, as a Head and as a teacher until this matter is resolved.”</p><p align="justify">“Malfoy! No, no that won’t do! He—”</p><p align="justify">“He is a changed man, and he is worried about Severus too. He promised to follow your instructions to the letter.” Minerva dismissed her hope with a careless wave of the hand.</p><p align="justify">Hermione sighed. “This isn’t you asking me; this isn’t a request, is it?”</p><p align="justify">“I’m afraid so. It is also a school matter; when he is weak, so are the school wards.”  Minerva’s features hardened.</p><p align="justify">She already knew that she was a part of the school’s magic just like any Headmaster or Headmistress was, just like Severus was. The school’s magic was almost like an entity, sentient and fluid. When she asked the school for a favour, to aid her in saving Severus Snape, she willingly gave part of her own magic, her own life force, in payment. At the time it was almost poetic, one wounded and one dead saving the other—she aided both of them to survive.</p><p align="justify">The flow of magic was now free, she knew; she served as a conduit for it. And even if she had no authority to aid or control Hogwarts, she was a part of it. In a way, she had robbed Minerva of her rights as Headmistress. Given that Severus couldn’t surrender his ties to the school, Minerva’s ability to master the school was diminished and reduced, and Hogwarts was and had always been—temperamental. Severus’ reckless and downright self-destructive behaviour didn’t help either. Too often for her taste, he’d do something which would retaliate on the school—lowering protections, an odd misfire of wild magic—</p><p align="justify">This took a toll, not on Severus or herself, but on Minerva, ageing her more than was natural.</p><p align="justify">Hermione realised she is staring into an empty space, leaving Minerva to wait for her reply. “Very well, I’ll be ready in an hour. You may send Malfoy an owl.” She finally placed her cold and almost untouched tea on the table.</p><p align="justify">“Use the floo, Hermione. I am grateful—” Minerva started to say, but she wasn’t in a mood for cordial pleasantries.</p><p align="justify">“Careful, Headmistress, you are starting to sound like Headmaster Dumbledore.”</p><p align="justify">“And you, my dear girl, are starting to sound like <em> him</em>.” Minerva gave her one tight smile.</p><p align="justify">Hermione tilted her head in recognition and took a pinch of floo sand calling to her room.</p><p align="justify">Once she was safe and alone she pressed both hands over her mouth, unable to calm their shaking.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> Oh, Gods! I just insulted the Headmistress. Gods, this is bad. </em>
</p><p align="justify">It took her a few minutes to regain control over her rapid breathing and shaking. It was only after an elf popped in to inform her that her things are packed that she snapped out of her panicked stupor.</p><p align="justify">Thanking the elf, she noticed with regret that she did her best to avoid her. No, the elves of Hogwarts still didn’t forgive her for S.P.E.W.</p><p align="justify">The trunk appeared next to her.</p><p align="justify">With a sigh, Hermione glanced around the room, tattered furniture, almost spartan in its functionality and walls lined in books. The books belonged to her but the furniture was the same as when Severus Snape lived in these quarters.</p><p align="justify">With a frown, she started to choose books to take with her. <em> As if I’ll be able to focus on reading. </em>Adding the few thick leather-bound books in the trunk, she curled up on the sofa, gazing at the fire. She wanted to see him, even if eight years after the war did a precious little for his nature. Severus Snape was still as prickly and unpleasant as ever.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> How did I manage to be so stupid and fall for him out of all men? </em>
</p><p align="justify">Minerva was wrong, she hadn’t been in love with him when she saved him. No, at the time she had been tired, confused but most of all stricken by the sheer injustice, unfairness—and appalled by her own behaviour and doubt in him. She’d wanted—no, she’d <em>had</em> <em>to</em> correct her mistake. So she had gone back to the Shack, and she had found him, not dead as she believed but still alive, if only barely.  And she’d made a deal, invoking the Magic of the Castle.</p><p align="justify">She knew the incantation and ritual, they were part of the same book Dumbledore suggested to her to look into regarding the Horcrux’’,she was strong enough, she had the love for the castle and its inhabitants—the castle never questioned her right to do what she did. Bargaining her own magic and sealing the deal with her own blood for the life of Severus Snape, the hero from the shadows.  By doing so, she had helped Hogwarts to mend itself. She had saved Snape’ life. She had felt good about her actions, expecting that at least she would have received some recognition for her actions, but the recognition that never came.</p><p align="justify">The Wizarding world at large wasn’t so keen on forgiving Severus Snape, or her for the fact that he survived. And that was something he had in common with Wizarding Britain—he wasn’t keen on forgiving her that fact either.</p><p align="justify">And still, she didn’t love him then. The love came later, while she and Harry worked to clear his name and keep him out of Azkaban. So, <em> he </em> became her new driving force. He <em>was</em> her inspiration when she chose Potions instead of the slow and futile Ministry career. He was the reason she applied for a job at the school, replacing his old position. She wanted to prove that being Slytherin wasn’t a bad thing when she applied for the Head of House position.</p><p align="justify">That was a blessing and a curse— the world at large despised her. Gryffindors called her a traitor, Slytherins called her an intruder, and Minerva called her a blessing. She did manage to raise the House reputation but at what cost? The Daily Prophet labelled her as “The golden ex-Gryffindor Princess of no house”.</p><p align="justify">Severus Snape called her every name she could think of but mostly referred to her as “that self-righteous meddling nuisance”.</p><p align="justify">And she still persisted, still did her best to impress the man - in spite of everyone, she still believed in the rightness of her decision. She lost her credibility as a war hero, not that she cared much about that, but it still hurt how unpopular she was now. It was junior school and a good part of Hogwarts years all over again, except—this time she didn’t have Harry and Ron by her side.</p><p align="justify">But she couldn’t go against her conscience.</p><p align="justify">During the trials, Wizengamot and newspapers tore the life of Severus Snape apart, examining and scrutinising everything. They commandeered his memories, all of them, making a good part of them public. Try as she might, she couldn’t stop them. It was a gross invasion of his privacy, especially because he wasn’t in any condition to defend himself or prevent them from taking his memories from him. It was such blatant disregard of personal rights that it left her reeling from anger on his behalf.</p><p align="justify">But at the same time, that same invasion on his privacy gave her the insight to what kind of man he was: a man that was frighteningly intelligent, capable, loyal, devoted and brave, a misunderstood and lonely soul who, from what she gathered, had never been on the receiving end of kindness or affection. Not if they didn’t come with strings attached.</p><p align="justify">Harry often joked that she had made Snape into one of her rescue projects.</p><p align="justify">She hadn’t, and he wasn’t. She found new respect for him, and after he recuperated from the near-death experience, she even found him attractive, if not conventionally handsome. Hermione couldn’t explain even to herself why or how she managed to fall in love with him. But she did. And she kept it a secret from everyone, especially him.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> Or so I thought. </em>
</p><p align="justify">Once Severus was freed, both by Wizengamot and from the hospital, she used Minerva as cover and gave him a place to stay: a small cottage on the outskirts of Forbidden Forest she’d received as a gift, in secret, from none other than Malfoy’s. As it turned out nobody, not even Voldemort himself or Severus knew that Malfoy’s possessed this cottage, and the ownership paper came with the letter, expressing very cold and nearly insulting gratitude for her efforts to save Severus. She had no desire to use that house, but she didn’t return it or sell it either, opting to rent it to Severus.</p><p align="justify">Well, maybe rent was a too strong word.</p><p align="justify">He was given permission, by Minerva as the cottage was still on the border of the school grounds, to live there free of charge. She supplied the cottage with a decent potions laboratory enabling him to open Owl post delivery potions business. And for all he knew, the cottage had belonged to Dumbledore, now school. The place was secluded and well guarded, which was good considering that many still cried out for a pound of his flesh.</p><p align="justify">At first, she tried to help him, bringing the best Muggle doctors to deal with his trauma, not an easy feat given that she had to Obliviate them later. She consulted Mediwitches and wizards all over the globe to see if there was anything that could reduce the consequences of the bite. She tried to be his friend, never for a moment forgetting that her love was all in vain.</p><p align="justify">Year, after year, she hoped to hear at least one word from him that wasn't an insult.</p><p align="justify">And finally, she gave up. Oh no, not on love, for some reason, no matter what he did it just made her love him more. She gave up on attempting to approach him. In fact, she made a firm decision not to be around him anymore. And she managed to hold on to that decision for almost a full year.</p><p align="justify">Until now.</p><p align="justify">Elf popped in again. “Tilly is to escort Potions Mistress to the gates.”</p><p align="justify">Notified her elf, tugging on her hand and her trunk. In the blink of an eye, she was transported to the cottage location.</p><p align="justify">The elf left her sitting in the middle of a large muddy puddle. Struggling to get up, she grumbled under her breath, reminding herself that elves have all the right in the world to feel angry and insulted.</p><p align="justify">Casting an angry <em> Tergeo </em> she managed to bring herself in the at least decent state. She levitated her trunk feeling like her heart had taken up residence in her throat. Her palms slickened with a sudden rush of sweat. Taking a deep breath to calm herself, Hermione walked determinedly towards the cottage.</p>
