  </p><p>Ever since she was young, Harry knew she was different. The others couldn’t make Aunt Petunia’s prized roses bloom in winter by just coaxing it gently. They couldn’t turn Mr. Smith’s hair blue when he had scolded Harry a bit too harshly in his class one day. Neither could they vanish from the sight of their bullies and appear on the rooftop in a single moment. No one could do things like Harry could do just by willing them to happen. That is why Harry was different. That is why she was a <em>freak</em>.</p><p> </p><p>But then she got the Hogwarts letter when she was eleven, and Harry realized that everything she had been told was a lie. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had told her that her parents were no-good drunks who died in a car accident –<em>when in reality they had been murdered by a psychopath</em>. They told her that because she could do impossible things –<em>things that bend and broke the laws of nature so easily when she willed it to</em>- she was a <em>freak</em>. They told her that <em>freaks</em> don’t get to wear nice clothes; that <em>freaks</em> don’t get to celebrate their birthday, or make friends. They said that it doesn’t matter that she was a girl or a boy –the only thing mattered was that she was a <em>freak</em>, and just for this reason she would never be worthy of anything in her life.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Lies.</em></strong> They kept feeding her lies for the first ten- <em>impressionable</em>- years of her life, and when the truth came out, they tried to hide it from her with all their effort. After all, who would let go of such a convenient, gullible punching bag? But then she got the letter, and their web of lies fell apart like a string of dominoes. Harry was so <em>angry</em> when she realized that everything they had told her was a lie. Just because of a decade old petty grudge they had stomped down on her pride and used her like a slave –<em>as if she owed them everything</em> –while the truth was far from it.</p><p> </p><p> So fed up with the bunch of hypocrites that were her relatives, Harry grabbed the letter addressed to her and set off towards Diagon Alley with the help of the funny half-giant who introduced himself as Hagrid. Hagrid was the one who told her the truth about her parents, about her past. He was the first person who wished her a “Happy Birthday” for the first time in her life, and even gifted her cake that must’ve tasted better than it looked –<em>too bad all of it went in Dudley’s tummy. Oh well, at least she got a laugh out of his transfigured pig-tail that Hagrid had cursed him with for stealing her first ever birthday gift.</em> Hagrid was her first friend, and she would never forget him just because of this reason alone.</p><p> </p><p>Hagrid introduced her to the Wizarding World. He also gave her beautiful owl Hedwig. He told her about Hogwarts, and sparked the hope inside her that she wasn’t unworthy, that she deserved friends and family as much as any normal person out there in the world. Even though he was sometimes air-headed and clueless –<em>and a horrible cook to boot</em>- Harry loved him for it and wouldn’t have him any other way.</p><p> </p><p>And so, remembering Hagrid’s words, Harry stepped onto the platform Nine and three-fourth and met the ones who’d forever change her life for the better.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
    <strong>II.</strong>
  </p><p> </p><p>Hogwarts was….. different. A <em>good </em>different. All her life she had been told she was unimportant, unworthy……….. but here <em>everyone</em> told her that it wasn’t so.  That she was worthy. Important –<em>if the way they looked at her in awe and reverence was any clue</em>. She was grateful that the Wizarding World –<em>and Hogwarts in turn</em>- accepted her presence with open arms. Though she could do without the ‘Celebrity-like’ treatment. It wasn’t long before it got annoying. </p><p> </p><p>To her, Hogwarts was something akin to a child’s dream come true. There was a castle –<em>filled with ghosts, secret chambers and passages, staircases that moved –as if they had a mind of their own- and even talking portraits!-</em> where children were taught how to use and wield magic. It was as if she was living in a fantastical illusion. It’d have been even better if trouble didn’t follow like a persistent Fluffy hell bent on cuddling with her. Because seriously, in her first year there was that troll, and then the chase to stop Snape from getting Philosopher’s stone –<em>only to find in the end that it was actually the cowardly, stuttering Professor Quirell who was after the stone</em>; in the second year she had to deal with Basilisk –<em>the less said about that, the better</em>; in her Third Year she was the target of an escaped convict’s attention, only to find that that escaped convict was her Godfather who had wrongly been accused for betraying her parents, while the <em>real traitor</em> was out loose, and alive as he avoided suspicion by transforming as an Animagus for the last few years; in the Fourth Year she had been <em>forced</em> to participate in a ‘Life-or-Death’ tournament even when she was underage, and it was<em> horrible </em>because no one –<em>except Hermione</em> <u>(Bless her soul</u>)- believed her when she said she didn’t put her name in that <em>thrice damned goblet</em>, and in the last stage of tournament something went wrong as Cedric died and Voldemort was resurrected; her Fifth Year had been even more horrible- having Umbridge terrorizing the whole Hogwarts with her reign, the Ministry acting like <em>stupid chickens</em> as they denied Voldemort’s return, and in the end being so fed up with <em>adults-who-did-nothing-about-all-of-this</em> she took the matter in her own hands and –along with Hermione and Ron- started the Dueling club, which they jokingly aimed as the Dumbledore’s Army. Only for their joke to backfire when Umbridge caught them and only because of Hermione’s quick thinking they managed to get out of this mess. And then she –<em>being her stupid, gullible self</em>- played right into Volemort’s hands by believing into the visions he purposely sent her about them torturing Sirius. She stormed the Ministry of Magic with her friends to rescue her Godfather, only to find that it was all a trap. Her friends almost died, <em>she</em> almost died, heck, <em>Sirius actually died</em> –all because she was a fucking gullible idiot who always played right into others hands without using her brains. All because of a Prophecy. <em>A fucking Prophecy.</em></p><p> </p><p>The Ministry finally had to admit that Voldemort had returned after they unexpectedly waked in when Harry flew into rage to chase Bellatrix –to kill that insane witch who killed Sirius, only to almost get possessed by Voldemort. Fudge resigned, and the whole Wizarding world once again shook in terror as they finally realized that the Dark Lord had once again returned. The adults planned, the children prayed, and all of the Wizarding World placed their hopes on Harry to save them once again.</p><p> </p><p>And then Dumbledore died in her sixth year –but not before informing her about Horcruxes. <em>And so the Hunt began.</em></p><p> </p><p>For months she wandered around the globe- <em>looking for clues, searching for those cursed artifacts, escaping the snatchers sent after them, trying not to worry about the remaining of her precious people –<strong>her chosen family</strong>- and praying for their survival</em>. All the while Voldemort and his army took over the Ministry of Magic in Britain, and got a hold of Hogwarts. Her friends from DA kept their heads down for a while, but behind the authorities’ backs, they plotted their counter-attack. Because they knew that it wasn’t a matter of “How” they would do it, it was only a matter of “When”. They were waiting for Harry, and while Harry hadn’t known about that at that time, she couldn’t help but broke down in happy tears when she heard about it later.</p><p> </p><p>The hunt for Horcruxes wasn’t all sunshine and daisies –<em>not that they had expected it to be</em>. They were tensed, stressed, and most of all none of them had any idea what to actually <em>do</em>. After all, they were just teenagers –<em>mere school students</em>- who were forced to take on a role much, much larger and heavy with responsibilities for their age. Hermione suppressed the guilt of obliviating her own parents -<em>even if it was for their own safety</em>- just for the sake of her friends, and used every bit of her wit and cunning to desperately search for clues. Ron tried his best to keep their morale up and drove them forwards with his loud enthusiasm –<em>hiding the fact that he was worried about his family, afraid that he would lose any of them while he was on this self-imposed task that seemed more like a wild-goose chase with their  every failure</em>. And Harry? She was worse off of them. She was still mourning Sirius’s loss; guilty of dragging her friends in this mess; worried for the friends she had left behind; angry at the Wizarding Population who placed their hopes on a mere teenager instead of solving their problems with their own hands and not willing to do anything other than criticize her and slandering her for her absence –<em>what the fuck is wrong with them?!</em> Harry <em>hated</em> the people of Wizarding world and their sheep mentality, <em>hated </em>Voldemort for being his psychopathic self, <em>hated</em> Dumbledore for believing in a half-assed prophecy and for putting such a big burden on her shoulders- but above of all, she <em>hated <strong>herself</strong></em> for being so weak and useless, and cursed her own existence –<em>because after all, if she didn’t exit, then her parents would’ve been alive, and she was sure they would’ve found a way to deal with Voldemort</em>, <em>she had heard so much about their brilliance and smart tactics</em>. This war wouldn’t have been dragged on then. No more lives would’ve been lost. Everything would’ve been fine and dandy.</p><p> </p><p>But it wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>And now it was up to three lone teenagers to shoulder the burden of freeing a whole goddamn society from the clutches of a psychopath to make everything right.</p><p> </p><p>How was <em>that</em> fair?</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
    <strong>III.</strong>
  </p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t remember much about the events that led to the Final Battle at Hogwarts. Everything after the Malfoy Manor fiasco was a bit hazy to her –<em>all she remembered were the scars o Luna’s arms and her strained smiles, Ron’s glassy eyes filled with unshed tears for his friends,  Hermione’s screams of <strong>agony</strong>, her own body twitching in pain as it <strong>hurthurthurthurthurt</strong>, Dobby’s kind smile and bat-like eyes that turned dull and lifeless when the green light of the Killing curse hit him</em>. She didn’t remember clearly how she had broken into Gringotts along with Hermione and Ron, how she escaped the Death Eaters at Hogsmeade, how she entered Hogwarts and led her friends and acquaintances –<em>they were all children –teenagers, really- and they were supposed to participate in a battle, how is that even <strong>fair?!,</strong> </em>how she dueled death Eaters left and right, how she walked into the empty clearing that fateful day to be killed by Voldemort’s hands –<em>just like Dumbledore had wanted her to</em>, how she had returned back to life in a blaze of orange fire that only she could see, and feel it coursing in her veins; how she dueled the Dark Lord Voldemort and defeated him with the Elder wand thrumming warmly in her hands –<em>as if it were meant to be there.</em></p><p> </p><p>All she remembered from the Final battle were the terrified faces of her fellow comrades-in-arms –<em>her friends and other schoolmates who shouldn’t have been dragged in a war that shouldn’t have anything to do with them!</em>- ; the despair that clung to them as they wondered if they’ll still be alive after this battle; of the corpses of friends, families, acquaintances –<em>even of enemies</em>- that littered the grounds as the battle raged on; of the bittersweet end of the battle –<em>because they might’ve won the war, but they had lost too much to enjoy the Victory.</em></p><p> </p><p>The days after the Final Battle Harry shut herself in No. 13 Grimmauld Palace after threatening Kreacher to not let anyone else in without her explicit order –<em>or so help her she would make him <strong>pay</strong> in a fashion that would impress even Sirius’s pureblood fanatic mother</em>- and for the next few weeks she cut herself off from the world and immersed in grief of what she had lost –<em>Dobby, Fred, Remus, Tonks, Snape, <strong>Sirius……</strong></em></p><p> </p><p>The people of Magical Britain demanded her presence –they wanted the Woman-Who-Conquered to lay the foundation of their newly revised Ministry of Magic and lead the efforts for reconstruction –<em>what a joke, how can Harry help others when she wasn’t even sane enough to help herself? </em>So she resolutely ignored the paperazzi who wanted to have an exclusive interview with the Golden Girl, and burned all the fan mails and newspapers that Kreacher shoved at her in sadistic glee. For weeks she cut-off all contacts with the Magical Britain, and even refused her family and friends when they tried to barge in <em>–“Grieving alone isn’t healthy for your mental state, Harry!”</em>- and drag her out to see the world instead of suffocating herself inside the Grimmauld Palace with a grumpy Kreacher and her own dark and depressing thoughts for company.</p><p> </p><p>In the end, it was Andromeda who made her get out of that damn depressing house. She somehow broke into the house –<em>using Teddy’s status as her Godson acknowledged by the family <strong>Magicks</strong> of Potter and Black Houses helped her find a loophole in the wards and hence, made it possible to break into the Grimmauld Palace </em>– and dumped Teddy on her lap. All it took Harry was one glimpse of her Godson’s chubby face as he reached his toddler hand towards her curls and babbled <em>“Godmama!” </em>at her, and she broke down crying. Teddy –<em>her little sunshine, her <strong>everything</strong></em>- just kept babbling in that cute voice of his –<em>though from the way his now tuft of red hair was changing into grey streaks, as well as ever changing green eyes that flickered to a dull color it was obvious that he wasn’t as unaffected by her cries as she had imagined him to be</em>- and she vowed that she would protect this little ray of sunshine –<em>who smiled at her as if she hung the moon and the stars in the sky, what an adorable child- </em>for all her life. For the sake of this little child –<em>whose only loved ones left were his aging and grieving Grandmother and a not-so-sane Godmother</em>- she would <strong><em>live</em>.</strong></p><p> </p><p>
    <u>(……….she could do without the orange fire, though. It had no right erupting out of nowhere and scaring her Godson like that.)</u>
  </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
    <strong>IV.</strong>
  </p><p>So, Harry picked up her broken pieces and glued them together and decided to be a responsible adult –<em>for once in her life</em>- and returned back to the Magical Society. She put a poker face on and even when she wanted to run far, <em>far</em> away at the sight of reporters –<em>she still remembered Rita Skeeter and how much trouble her overly exaggerated writings had caused her</em>- but she didn’t. For all she was more than happy to leave Wizarding World far, <em>far</em> behind her while she goes on a journey of self-discovery, she knew that there were some things that only she could do, and for that she had to remain here.</p><p> </p><p>The Wizarding world was going through a reform -<em>you can say</em>- and after Voldemort’s death, it’s obvious that the next to be purged are the Corrupted Officials of the Magical Ministry. While Hermione and Ron along with the Order –<em>and even Draco</em>- were doing remarkable jobs of cleaning up this mess, there are always some moles that hide deeply and will definitely strike when others least expect it and would definitely mess during the sessions of future reformed Wizengamot for their own gains. To say nothing of the bigot and discrimination that ran deep in some Pureblood families even after the war. And of course, you can’t forget the sheep mentality of most of the people in the Wizarding world. With Dumbledore dead for a long time and no Voldemort to forcibly suppress them with terror, they have no one to follow, and the Corrupted officials were taking advantage of this fact by appearing as magnanimous figures of public and pushing for laws and orders that would benefit them the most- which included the Marriage Law –<em>in which all Muggleborns and some HalfBloods with poor ancestries were forced to be betrothed to pureblood families as <strong>concubines </strong>to redeem them somehow for their dirty blood, or so they say</em>; then there is also Capture of Magical creatures Act where most Magical beasts or even halflings –<em>those who have blood of magical creatures flowing through their veins</em>-were to be captured and classified into ranks, and to be treated accordingly to their ranks –<em>the dangerous ones were to be slaughtered while the lower ranked ones were to be tamed and used as <strong>pets</strong></em>. Hermione and Luna –<em>along with all their friends who were in higher posts in the Ministry, because of their own skill as well as their efforts in the War-had protested heavily against it.</em> But even with the backing of the Ancient and Noble Houses of Longbottom, Malfoy, Weasley, Lovegood, Greengrass, Zabini, and many others; as well as several officials such as the new assistant DMLE Head (Susan Bones), the Head Auror-in-training (Ron Weasley), the Foreign Affairs Minister (Hannah Abott), the famous Magizoologist (Rolf Scamander) as well as some others. But those idiots in Wizengamot weren’t willing to listen to someone <em>young, impressionable</em> and obviously <em>un-experienced</em> and <em>much less knowledgeable</em> than them and were all more-than-willing to pass this ridiculous law that would not only alienate the Magical Creatures from the Magical ministry of Britain, but would also condemn Harry’s little, <em>adorable </em>godson to a worse fate just because he was a son of werewolf. It was like a ticking time bomb with the fate of activating werewolf bloodline hovering over Teddy’s neck like a noose. And well, for Harry, that was the last straw that broke the camel’s back.</p><p> </p><p><em>No one threatens her godson and gets away with it. </em>After all, Teddy was <em>hers.</em> And she would always, <em>always</em> protect what is hers, <em>with her <strong>dying will.</strong></em></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
    <strong>V.</strong>
  </p><p>That had been the first time Harry had used her seemingly worthless titles to use and with an iron fist she proved to others that she wasn’t the same naïve school girl anymore. She was now the Master of three of the Most Ancient and Noble Houses of the Wizarding World and the <em>‘Woman-who-Conquered’.</em> She deserved the respect that she had rightfully earned through sweat, blood and tears.</p><p> </p><p>And so, she led the opposition against the misguided officials and pureblood families who had agreed to such ridiculous laws. With her popularity among the public of Wizarding World as their Saviour, it was easy to bring the Wizarding populace to her side. With Hermione and Luna arranging Magical Creatures Awareness campaigns, along with Draco and Daphne Greengrass running damage control –and with harry obviously siding with them- it wasn’t long before they won the trials and hence, the proposition were cancelled.</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t like politicking, but sometimes she did have to interfere or else the bigoted, brainless fools –<em>the so called Council of Magical Britain</em>- would’ve ruined the Magical Society long ago with their brainless actions. Once even Kingsley jokingly offered her the seat as the Minister of Magic, which she stubbornly declined, because if she was forced to manage this society –full of wizards with sheep mentality – then she’d rather jump off a cliff, thank you very much.</p><p> </p><p>Between taking care of Teddy and presiding over the Wizengamot from time to time -so that they don’t make a mess of everything because of their brainless actions- as well as with her own job as an Unspeakable –she had been researching the Veil of Death- Harry had her hands full. She never had any time for a reunion with her friends, let alone visiting them, since she was always busy with one thing or other. And so, many years passed in a blur and before she knew it, her Godson grew up and was ready to start his own first year at Hogwarts. She hadn’t known when her friends had started piecing themselves back together from the horrors of the War and started forming their own families –while she was still trying to get over it. Hermione married Ron and was busy caring for their children. Ginny vowed to stay single her whole life and went to play Quidditch for professional teams. Neville studied to be a Magibotanist and was dating Susan Bones. Luna was off gallivanting around the world with Rolf Scamander, looking for unknown Magical Creatures. George had married Angelina and had put his whole mind in expanding his business of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes.  Draco married Astoria Greengrass, and was working in the Ministry as an official.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone had moved on. <em><u>(Except her.)</u></em></p><p> </p><p>And as if <em>that </em>wasn’t enough, after that particular enlightenment came <em>another </em>startling realization, something she should’ve realized a long, <em>long</em> time ago.</p><p align="center">
    <em>.</em>

    <em>As Harry watched her friends and their families –<strong>who had come to attend the small get-together Andromeda was hosting </strong><u>(after threatening Harry to be present, <strong>or else-!)</strong></u> <strong>before Teddy was off to attend his first year at Hogwarts</strong>- she couldn’t help but stare at their slightly dulling hair, as well as their aging skin –the laughing lines and slight wrinkles on their forehead- and then absently touched her own cheek. The tips of her fingers glided over her soft, supple, unblemished skin –free of any signs of aging- and blood drained from her face as a startling realization came over her like a hammer on a nail.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“<strong>No…..”</strong> Harry whispered as her eyes widened in horror.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>Wizards tended to age slower than Muggles- that was a fact. No one knew whether it was a side effect of using magic, or of something else. Magic not only slowed down the aging process of a wizard, but also increased their life expectancy. While a normal human has an average life span of eighty years, Wizards had an average life span of almost one hundred fifty years.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>But just because Wizards age slower did not mean that they didn’t age at all, which was what had startled Harry. Because compared to the aging adult-like look of her friends, Harry looked like a teenage girl in comparison -<strong>which shouldn’t even be possible</strong>. The only Magicals who don’t age are Vampires or Faes, and Harry was sure that she was neither.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>So what did this mean? This means that there was something wrong with her- because why else would she age and others won’t? It means that she was still different from her peers. And from a very young age Harry knew that being different was not always a good thing –<strong>and considering her Potter luck you can assume it’d definitely be worse.</strong></em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“Harry?” Hermione asked in concern when she saw her friend’s face pale even further. “Are you alright?”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>Harry’s eyes flickered over Hermione’s as she suppressed the urge to burst out in hysterical tears. Her eyes glanced over Teddy who had been talking eagerly with George and Ron, and pushed down her panic. She can’t ruin her Godson’s happiness with her own problems. So, putting a smile on her face, she shook her head and muttered, “It’s nothing, Hermione. I’m fine.”</em>

    <strong>VI.</strong>
  </p><p>A few days after the reunion party Harry visited a trusted medic to get herself examined, wondering if there was something wrong with her body for it to stop aging. To their surprise, there was nothing wrong with Harry’s body. She was perfectly healthy, and no diagnostic spells or tests showed that she suffered from any –<em>muggle or magical</em>- ailment. Since there was no medical problem with her body, then it’s obvious that the problem lies somewhere else. </p><p> </p><p>Harry waited until Teddy went off to Hogwarts before she grabbed Hermione and Ron about her un-aging problem. Hermione had some doubts about it since a few years ago, but hadn’t brought it up in their conversations when she had noticed that Harry didn’t seem to notice it herself, while Ron had just thought she was either using some Muggle cosmetic products or using glamour charm to make herself look young. There had been a few other people who had suspected it too –<em>some even had nefarious intent of exposing Harry’s non-aging problem by accusing her of doing dark rituals for immortality or something equally rubbish</em>-  and if Hermione –<em>along with a few other friends of hers</em>- hadn’t been troubleshooting in the background Harry might’ve been even thrown into Azkaban without a trial if the matter had been brought to public attention.</p><p> </p><p>That’s why, it didn’t take much to convince them, and once again, the once dubbed ‘Golden trio’ immersed themselves into research-<em>much to Ron’s dismay</em>. They first looked into the Black Family’s Library in the Grimmauld Palace, but other than some hints about a few <em>very</em> dubious Dark rituals there was nothing that could point them to the right direction. Since they couldn’t find what they were looking for in the Black Family’s Ancient library, they turned their attention to other sources. Ron met up with their friends and discreetly asked for their advice in their endeavor. Hermione herself turned to the Ministry of Magic’s Archives, while Harry broke into the past years’ records of Unspeakables in hopes of finding something. To their disappointment, they couldn’t find anything even after searching for months.</p><p> </p><p>Finding some clues about Harry’s supposed un-aging was like trying to look for a needle in haystack. At least during their hunt for Horcruxes, they had a vague idea of what they were supposed to look out for. But here, there was nothing that could hint them to <em>what</em> the problem actually was.</p><p> </p><p>And then Hermione became pregnant again, and the three of them decided to halt their research for a while so as not to stress her. And with Teddy’s return for the summer vacations, Harry had to divert her attention back to her Godson. Harry spent her vacations with Teddy, making happy memories, all the while hiding her problems with a smile on her face. </p><p> </p><p>When Teddy went back to Hogwarts for his Second Year, Harry applied for her resignation from the Department of Mysteries and went abroad. Since there was no clue to be found in Magical Britain, then she should look somewhere else. After all, the world is so vast, she might find her answers in some other part of the globe. Hermione and Ron had their own lives now. She can’t dump her problems on them and expect them to help her out every time. She knows that they treat her as their family, and don’t mind helping her out, and she’s really glad that they’re helping her out, but it doesn’t mean that she could get overly dependent on them. Maybe she should’ve waited until Hermione had birthed her child, but then again, it’s not like her friend would get any less busier after that. Caring for a child –<em>an infant at that</em>- must be quite tiresome. And even if she knew that Hermione would definitely somehow make up time to helpout in their research while also taking care of their child, she would rather let her focus on caring for her family than busy herself with a research that might not even bore results. Harry didn’t want to burden her friends even more than they already were.</p><p> </p><p>And so, Harry grabbed filled two enchanted bags filled with a vault worth of gold –<em>who knows what kind of currency is used in some other Magical Communities? At least Gold is universally expensive enough that she might get enough money in it’s exchange</em>- and set off for her journey. </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
    <strong>VII.</strong>
  </p><p>Harry had known there were other Magical communities out there –during her induction ceremony as an Unspeakable, she had been debriefed about the various Magical Ministries of America, Japan, Russia, Italy, Korea, Australia, and France, as well as the Magical tribes of Africa, China, India, Atlantic etc. But <em>knowing</em> about them and <em>visiting</em> them herself were two different things.</p><p> </p><p>In the years following her departure from the Magical Britain, she had first decided to try her luck out in the Magical Ministries that were a part of the International Magical society. America was certainly an experience –the Ministry there was efficiently organized and the divide between Muggleborn Wizards and Purebloods wasn’t to the extent it had been back home. The Wizards here also kept up with the latest muggle technologies, which is why it’s no wonder that the American society of Magic was leaps and bounds ahead of the Magical Britain in terms of magical technological advancements. The European Magical society had been a breath of fresh air for her. Magical Italy was beautiful and romantic and the magic duels and fights in the Grand Magic Colosseum were quite fascinating. The Magical French Society was a good place for shopping magical artifacts. Greece was more open-minded about Magical Creatures than any other Magical ministries in the world. The witches and wizards in Spain leaned more towards the entertainment industry –<em>what with having many idols, models and even actors working in magical theater groups</em> –and wasn’t that a surprise. Germany was an experience in itself –the wizards were there well trained and loved challenging her to a fight –which would usually turn into an all-out brawl- <em>especially after knowing who she exactly was</em>. Well, at least she got to learn more about hand-to-hand combat as well as became proficient in muggle and magical weaponry.</p><p> </p><p>Going to Africa’s tribal magical communities had been a huge mistake, especially when she had accidentally let slip that she was a Parselmouth–<em>though in her defense, how was she to know that a Runespoor had made it’s nest nearby?</em> She had to flee the continent in fear that she would be forced to marry those the warriors of Magical tribes who got into their heads that the one who could defeat her would win her heart.</p><p> </p><p>
    <u>(That was when she started hating translation spells and vowed to learn to be multilingual with her own skills. Spending her time learning a new language was much, much better than trusting that crappy spell. After all, it was if it wasn’t for the stupid spell that translated like a crappy version of google, she wouldn’t have mistaken the tribe leader’s words . The man had asked her to marry one of her sons if they prove their strength to her, however the stupid spell translated that he meant to ask her to stay a few days and accompany them –<em>how could it mess up ‘<strong>kuoa</strong>’ of marriage and ‘<strong>kaa</strong>’ for stay, she will never know</em>- and she had agreed, thinking that it’d be easier to ask around about her situation, then. Needless to say, her stay hadn’t been pleasant, especially with so many testosterone fueled idiots stalking her like crazy. She blamed the shitty translator spell, and vowed to work hard and learn other languages in future.)</u>
  </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately for all that valuable knowledge and experience she got in her trip there –<em>Africa didn’t count….. that was a freaking disaster!</em>- she didn’t find even a hint about her strange condition there. So, she moved through Russia, and really appreciated the designers who made amazing clothes with magical fabric, and somehow altered even the most hazardous materials into convenient clothes –<em>she could’ve done without the Magical mafia breathing down her neck though, as well as the kidnapping and assassination attempts on her person</em>- and stepped into the Asian Countries. She passed through China and it’s Magical Community that focused more towards tradition and environment, and their magical cuisine was one of the best she had ever tasted in the whole world. She asked around about her condition and was pointed by a kind potion master towards a Taoist temple somewhere in Sichuan province. She had been disappointed when the Taoist Priest said he didn’t know, but he did tell her about someone who could tell her about it.</p><p> </p><p>And so, finally after years of searching, she finally found her answers from a Buddhist monk living in isolation on one of the secluded mountain peak of the Himalayas in Nepal-</p><p align="center">

    <em>Harry sat silently before the older monk as he sat before her, counting the <strong>mala</strong> of Buddha beads in his hand. It has been a few days since she had arrived in the temple with much difficulty –<strong>the temple had actually been hidden by a devious formation that was meant to confuse travelers, how mean</strong>- and had been staying in an empty side courtyard and asking around about the older monk. Finally after much pestering, the elderly monk agreed to her meeting.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“What a curious child you are….” the older monk muttered as he stared at her and smiled. “For someone beloved by Magicks and chosen by Heavens, you have a fate full of suffering. But within that suffering you found your will to live, and lighted up your resolve for your loved ones, not knowing that you have been blessed by death.”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>Her heart tightened at his words. Blessed by death? Was he talking about how she had survived the killing curse in her toddler years? Or of the numerous narrow escapes from death in her school years? Or about how she had walked into that clearing to die by Voldemort’s hands to destroy the horcrux living inside her, only to come back to life? Or is it related to her un-aging body?</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“What do you mean?” She asked apprehensively.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“Child of Magick and Heavens, so many people have coveted the gift you have unknowingly received from Death, yet none were ever successful. This old one does not know whether you truly are blessed or not.” He spoke calmly.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>Over the years she had spent experiencing many cultures and customs, she had started understanding the words hidden beneath the cryptic language that often wise members of any Magical society spoke. His words struck deep within her core, and slowly a conjecture formed in her mind. “What is this gift that you speak of?” she asked as she pursued her lips, fearing his next words. If what she had thought is true, then she really is in a big problem this time.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“The gift of immortality,” He spoke bluntly. “-of power beyond one’s imagination that could either cause a calamity or a miracle, of the right to wield lives and deaths of every single soul in the many universes, of the chance of being one of the most supreme beings in the mortal world and beyond.” He stared straight into her green eyes that had now widened in shock, not noticing how she was paling with his every word. “Of being chosen as a vassal of Death itself.”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>A feeling of dread curled in her gut. “What are you trying to say?” she asked fearfully.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>The monk sighed and picked up a brush, before dipping it in the ink and drew something on the old parchment before him. He then handed the parchment to her and spoke, “This old one thinks you might recognize these runes. Maybe now you will understand what this old one is speaking of.”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>With trembling hands Harry took the paper from him and glanced at the diagram drawn on it. Her pupils shrank and cold sweat dripped down her temple as she let out a horrified gasp. The symbol of the Deathly Hallows was drawn on the stark white parchment. Looking at the symbol, she was suddenly reminded of words Luna’s dad had spoken to her during the time she and Ron and Hermione were on the horcruxes hunt-</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <strong> <em> <u>“The Elder Wand, the most powerful wand ever made. The Resurrection Stone. The Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one Master of Death.”</u> </em> </strong>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“No…” She whispered as she stumbled back in shock. She then shook her head and mumbled, “This is not possible…… It was just a myth…… How can this be-?”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“Every myth has a grain of truth in them.” the monk reminded her gently.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>She gasped and turned towards the monk and spoke anxiously, “Even if that is correct, there is another thing we need to keep in mind. I don’t have all the three of the Deathly Hallows! The stone was lost during the last battle somewhere in the Forbidden Forest. I myself had broken the Elder Wand and scattered it’s pieces in the valley behind the Hogwarts castle. And speaking of the invisibility cloak, I have already handed it to Teddy. Since the hallows are not together, how can I be the Master of Death?!”   </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“The artifacts of Death have chosen you. No matter what you do to them, or how much you deny their existence, they would one way or another, always return back to you –until the day Death itself takes them back.” the monk told her. "As for the reason of Death’s claim on you, isn’t it because you had chosen to die with open arms and greeted death like an old friend? The true Master does not seek to run from Death…… this is the reason why Death claimed you as it’s own. Immortality and Power is what the Master of Death deserves.”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>Immortality? Power? What kind of joke is that?! She never wanted that! She never wanted any power or immortality or any stupid gift of Death! She doesn’t want to be this whatsoever Master of Death! She wasn’t Voldemort! She never lusted for immortality or power! All she wants was to live this lifetime and protect her loved ones and die a peaceful death. What kind of gift is that supposed to be? For someone who has already accepted her death to be just a matter of time, wasn’t this gift akin to a curse?!</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>Her hands clenched into fists and she bit her lower lip. “I do not want this kind of gift!” She insisted. “There has to be a cure!”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“All the people under the heavens covet immortality, but only you treat this gift as a curse.” The older monk mused. “How perplexing….”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“Please…” She whispered pleadingly, “Do you have a way to take away this blessing?”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>The monk shook his head. “No one can deny Death’s claim. If Death itself has chosen you, then there is nothing anyone on this mortal plane that can do.”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>Her face turned ghostly pale, and her green eyes dimmed in despair. Really? Is there no other way?</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“Who should I go to, then?” She asked as she squeezed her eyes shut and sat with hunched shoulders, as if she was burdened by the weight of the world. “Where will I find my answers?”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“When you are ready, seek the gateway where death whispers and tempts the souls of the mortal realm. That is your destiny.” the monk told her before closing his eyes and resumed his chanting. His meaning was clear- this conversation was over.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>Harry sat there in a daze for a while, before she bowed to the monk and walked out of the temple. The sight of her desolate back made a young monk’s heart ache.</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>“Teacher…” he asked as he placed tea before the elderly monk. “It truly is a pity that the young lady had to leave our humble abode with such a heavy heart. Was there no way to lighten her burdens?”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>The older monk opened his eyes and sighed. “Those chosen by heavens have much more responsibility on their shoulders than ordinary mortals. For this child of Magick to have been claimed by Death, it is obvious that she would face much more than what any fateful heaven’s beloved child could ever encounter. The things that are meant to happen, will happen. Neither you, nor I have the power to lighten her burden, or even share some of them.”</em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em> </em>
  </p><p align="center">
    <em>Seeing the young disciple’s disappointed look, he just quirked his lips upwards into a small smile, and said with a faraway look in his glazed blue eyes, “However, just because we cannot share her burdens doesn’t mean she will never find anyone who would be willing to do so. After all, the heavens might test their chosen warriors, but they would never be outright cruel to their beloved little Sky.”</em>

<hr/><p> </p><p><strong>IX</strong>.</p><p>And so, Harry returned to the Magical Britain with a heavy heart. Her friends and family had been really happy seeing her return, considering that she hadn’t visited even once during the years she had been gone, and other than the few letters she sent them every once in a while –<em>only Teddy received letters from her regularly, while the others received them sporadically</em>- they had no way to ensure if she was alright. Ron and Hermione had especially given her an earful, complaining that she should’ve waited for them instead of disappearing from their lives like that, and they even managed to extort a promise from her that she’d take them with her next time, no matter whatever silly expedition she was planning. Her heart warmed at their concern, but even their kindness and worry could thaw the cold that had settled deep inside her after hearing the monk’s words.</p><p> </p><p>In the years she had been gone, her friends and family had gotten even older. Teddy was seventeen, and was about to graduate from Hogwarts. Her youngest godchildren were almost ready to start studying in Hogwarts that year. Her group of friends looked in their thirties, with even more aged lines and wrinkles on their skin. She looked like someone from younger generation, and not like someone who was a thirty-six year old who had fought a war with them. Her friends were curious about her seemingly eternal youth, and asked her about it, but she refused to say anything about it. She even turned down Ron and Hermione –<em>and even Teddy</em>- when they tried to pester her about it. She never wanted to tell them about the gift, or curse-<em>or whatever</em>- of death. She didn’t them to worry about her –<em>or worse, hate her</em>- for something that wasn’t even her fault. The emotional scars of pain and betrayal that she had suffered from in her teenage years had never healed. She knew better than anyone how weak-minded people of Wizarding Britain actually were. She was afraid that once the truth got out, it would be a repeat of her younger years –<em>of the accusations of being the ‘Heir of Slytherin’ in second year, of the mocking and bullying in her fourth year when everyone believed that she herself had put her name in that blasted goblet, of being called a liar in the fifth year and accusing her of being crazy when she said that Voldemort has returned, of being hunted like prey by the whole magical society of Britain when the Ministry fell in Voldemort’s hands</em>. After being burned too many times, how could she trust them to stay by her side if they knew that she had somehow turned Immortal? And even if they trusted her, then it is not guaranteed that her secret would not leak out. After all, the less people knew about a secret, the better. And if somehow her secret got out, then what if the people of wizarding Britain rebelled against her and proclaimed her to be the next dark lady if they ever knew that? Those morons would definitely believe such baseless rumors, and in the end, she would not only inconvenience herself, but also cause problems for the ones who would stay by her side.</p><p> </p><p>So, it was better for her to keep everything in than to tell them the actual truth. <em>After all, who would believe that she was the Master of Death?</em></p><p> </p><p>However, when their nagging got too much, she couldn’t resist joking that she found the famous “Fountain of Youth” in the lost ancient magical city of Atlantis during her journey, and to her astonishment, they actually <em>believed</em> her, saying that with her Potter Luck, anything was possible. She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when she heard them speak like that.</p><p> </p><p>She had especially dumbfounded when she heard that the people of Wizarding world themselves had actually believed this stupid explanation! She knew they were weak-minded and had sheep mentality, <em>but this was truly too much!</em> Seriously, one must be mentally ill if they actually believed in such nonsense……. Though she had a feeling that their easy acceptance of a such ridiculous thing was Hermione and Draco’s doing –<em>if their smug smirks was anything to go by</em>. Usually the two of them would bicker and scorn each other, but when they worked together, their unholy alliance would even make Kingsley hide under his desk in terror, let alone appeasing a bunch of morons of Wizarding World.   </p><p> </p><p>Maybe her loved ones had actually understood her feelings and decided not to question further. Or maybe they had believed her joke. Who knows? But what she did know was that Harry <em>loved</em> them to death, and even if she was unwilling to let them know her deepest, darkest secret, she would forever be glad for their presence in her life and for all their love and trust for her.  And for this reason, she would protect them to her best of her ability, <em>with her dying will.</em></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
    <strong>X.</strong>
  </p><p>And so, Months….. Years…… even decades passed, and Harry watched as her friends grew older day by day and in the end succumbed to death. She watched her precious godson pursue the lady of his heart, marry his girlfriend and let her play with her adorable grandchildren. She watched her godchildren settle down with their own families. Sometimes she too earned for a family like this –<em>for a lover who would whisper sweet nothings in her ears, for her own flesh and blood child she could dote on who would call her “Mother” sweetly</em>. But her desires would always remain just that – desires. Because ever since the day she became the Master of Death, she had lost the ability to conceive a child. No matter how much she tried, how many healers she visited, it didn’t work…… The title of Master of Death that had granted her Eternal youth and immortal and the ability to not die by any means, had taken something much, much precious to her- <em>her ability to conceive a child</em>. Which was why Harry could only watch over her loved ones and their descendants and could not start a family of her own. How cruel of Death to not only take away her right to die, but also her ability to conceive a child of her own.</p><p> </p><p>What use is of Immortality and power when she has no loved one she can share it with? What use is this stupid title when she cannot even keep those close to her from the embrace of death? Why does she get to suffer a lifetime of loneliness and despair while everyone else get to enjoy their mortal life with their loved ones?</p><p> </p><p>Hence, with such dark thoughts plaguing her mind, the very day Teddy’s soul left the world, Harry herself could not take it anymore and remembering the monk’s words, she went towards the “<em>the gateway where death whispers and tempts the souls of the mortal realm”. </em>And so, with her head held high, Harriel Lily Potter walked into the Veil of Death in the Department of Mysteries of the Ministry of Magic, seeking the end of this curse so that she could rest forever.</p><p> </p><p>
    <em>However, what she did not know that this is not the end, this was just the beginning.</em>
