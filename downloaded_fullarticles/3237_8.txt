          <div class="userstuff"><p>In 2008<br/>
I am a Pokemon.<br/>
Fake geek with no cards<br/>
Because I’m too scared to ask for some.<br/>
I know even then of the word economy<br/>
And that the mortgage comes first.<br/>
So I don’t ask.<br/>
But I run around the playground as Houndour<br/>
And the scraped knee hurts less when it's called battle damage.</p>
<p>In 2011,<br/>
Around twelve,<br/>
I am Annabeth<br/>
Sadie and Zia,<br/>
Hermione,<br/>
Katniss and Tris.<br/>
I learn to shoot a bow<br/>
And cast myself as the hero.<br/>
This is the age of the OC,<br/>
The days when I am powerful<br/>
And my dreams unbridled.<br/>
I am fierce<br/>
And I create<br/>
Legions of girls who<br/>
Will never leave my hard drive.<br/>
They are the dreaming of a child’s hope<br/>
That feminine doesn’t have to mean frail.<br/>
That I can be ‘not like the other girls’<br/>
And still be liked by them.<br/>
These are the days I am unafraid.</p>
<p>In 2015,<br/>
I am told<br/>
By a room of girls<br/>
That I am not what I am.<br/>
That feminine is fragile<br/>
And woman<br/>
Can only become<br/>
Wife<br/>
Never warrior.<br/>
I am told<br/>
I am meant for things,<br/>
Nothing more than a body<br/>
For others to use as they like.<br/>
My plans are irrelevant<br/>
Because they are mine.<br/>
I am female and foolish<br/>
Even though I am an academic<br/>
Ace<br/>
Flying high in thoughts of my own.<br/>
My arguments are met<br/>
With hollow smiles and harassment.<br/>
Kindness does not apply to the minority opinion here.</p>
<p>So I hide away with<br/>
Fiction and fantasy as my shields.<br/>
I am Obi-Wan<br/>
Strong and smart<br/>
Well-armed with words<br/>
And a lightsaber<br/>
As a last resort.<br/>
I am the Doctor<br/>
Warrior of wits<br/>
Armed with the power to help<br/>
Not harm.<br/>
I dream I am a Jedi and a Time Lord<br/>
And I am powerful again.<br/>
I dream of peace.<br/>
But when I sit at the lunch table and<br/>
Write of a girl who dares to dream<br/>
Dares to be a Jedi<br/>
To be strong<br/>
To be loud<br/>
My words are stolen away and twisted<br/>
Mocked<br/>
And I learn I can only be strong<br/>
If I am not what I am.<br/>
The story dies,<br/>
Unfinished<br/>
And I stop talking.<br/>
I am only safe to be strong<br/>
If I am not a girl<br/>
And I am.<br/>
So I am silent.<br/>
I retreat to darkened shadows<br/>
Safe in the silence.</p>
<p>But in 2017,<br/>
I rediscover my strength<br/>
In a dingy bedroom where,<br/>
For the first time in years,<br/>
I talk.<br/>
I reclaim my voice<br/>
To talk of fandom.<br/>
To take a first shaky step<br/>
Back into the light.<br/>
And I am loved<br/>
By a girl<br/>
Raised on Sam<br/>
And Dean<br/>
Captain America<br/>
And Iron Man<br/>
Moira<br/>
And Optimus Prime.<br/>
I am told,<br/>
For the first time in my life,<br/>
Not to be ashamed.</p>
<p>I am an Autobot,<br/>
And Autobots are not ashamed.<br/>
I transform myself<br/>
And step inside these characters<br/>
Because inside their armor,<br/>
I am safe.<br/>
The voices that scream in my ears that<br/>
Science and science fiction<br/>
Are not for girls like me<br/>
Are not for girls at all,<br/>
Cannot be heard from inside my armor.<br/>
No one tells me what I have to be.<br/>
What I have to do.<br/>
Woman can be warrior<br/>
When I hold the power of change within me.<br/>
I am a Transformer.<br/>
I am change embodied.</p>
<p>I write for days.<br/>
I write pages and pages<br/>
And with each word,<br/>
I grow stronger.<br/>
I rediscover myself<br/>
And learn to walk in the light.<br/>
Until almost a year later,<br/>
I am strong enough to share.<br/>
I give my writings to the world.<br/>
I give myself -<br/>
Hidden under<br/>
A pseudonym<br/>
And the mask of characters -<br/>
To the world.<br/>
I talk of fandom to strangers<br/>
And relearn how to live unafraid.</p>
<p>I am strong again.<br/>
I create worlds and plot lines<br/>
With nothing but my mind.<br/>
I bend language,<br/>
The tool of my critics,<br/>
To my will<br/>
Until it speaks with my voice<br/>
And I am heard.</p>
<p>I am powerful again,<br/>
Protected in my borrowed armor.<br/>
And while that fear still finds me,<br/>
It does not rule me.<br/>
I will hide my comics<br/>
And my screen in public<br/>
For now<br/>
Because the shadows of shame still linger<br/>
But I will not stop writing.<br/>
An Autobot is not ruled by fear.<br/>
I have lived too long in darkness<br/>
To ever forgo the light.</p>
<p>I am Prowl<br/>
And Jazz<br/>
And the Doctor<br/>
In all her forms.<br/>
I am Obi-Wan<br/>
Rey and Jyn<br/>
And Leia.<br/>
I am Banner and Stark,<br/>
Black Widow and Wonder Woman.</p>
<p>I find a refuge<br/>
Among a people I call my own.<br/>
These characters<br/>
Are mirrors<br/>
Reflections and celebrations<br/>
Of what I am<br/>
And what I hope to be.</p>
<p>In a world that calls them stories<br/>
I call them important.<br/>
They matter<br/>
Because they matter to me.<br/>
And that’s reason enough.</p>
<p>And that’s why we watch<br/>
And draw<br/>
And read<br/>
And write,<br/>
And create, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Because they matter.</p>
<p>Because there’s something inside of us<br/>
That identifies,<br/>
That connects,<br/>
That feels,<br/>
Not for these characters,<br/>
But with these characters.</p>
<p>Because we are them.<br/>
We make them.<br/>
And in turn,<br/>
They make us.</p></div>
