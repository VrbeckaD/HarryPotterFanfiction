    <p>‘’ Arya Lyanna Stark!’’ the voice belonged to a woman, walking in the direction of platform 9 ¾. The Hogwarts Express was expected to arrive very soon and the woman looked frustrated, to say the least. Her fiery red hair looked very pertinent to the fuming anger that clearly showed on her middle-aged, yet beautiful, face. Three other redheads could be seen along, two boys the age between 10 and 14, standing close to the woman’s right, a beautiful young girl, and not to forget the small child in her arms. The voice, however, had been focused on a dark-haired, skinny looking girl. Her name was Arya Stark.<br/>
---<br/>
Arya Stark huffed in annoyance at the voice that belonged to her mother. She loved her mom dearly but the two of them were so different that she had spent a lot of her short, young, years wondering if she was truly the daughter of the elegant and beautiful Catelyn Tully Stark.<br/>
‘’You come back here, right this instance young lady!’’ the voice continued. Arya cringed at the word use of ‘’lady’’. Gods, how she loathed that word. Her mother had a neck for getting under her skin.<br/>
‘’For the love you bear your poor mother, please get back here.’’<br/>
And dramatic, her mother could be awfully good at that too.  A few chuckles could be heard, no doubt from her brothers and some bystanders who watched open-mouthed as one of the richest and famous wizard family of Westeros made its way to platform 9 ¾.<br/>
Her family had never cared about spilling out their families name for everyone to hear. Arya hated it, from the moment that she was old enough to understand what her families name meant, she hated it. Didn’t like the things what was expected of her, the rules and tasks. Didn’t like to be judged even before somebody knew her. It had ended a lot of her early friendships and gave her a sense of insecurity. Especially because Arya knew herself that she didn’t really ‘’qualify’’ for being a ‘’lady’’. Yet almost everyone felt the need to remind her that she was, in fact, a lady and should act as such. According to Arya, it was all just a stupid title, not even relevant in this freaking twenty-first century, hello?</p><p>For a moment she wondered what would happen if she just ignored her mother further and jumped into the now opening doors of the train, the Hogwarts express. But she had promised her father, Eddard stark, called Ned by his friends and family, to behave and listen to her mother. He had wanted to see her off, had told her that he really felt bad for not being here.  Arya knew he had more important matters to attend to. As lord of Winterfell and right hand of the minister of magic, duty always called. And so she had promised him solemnly while looking into the same grey coloured eyes, that she’d behave. </p><p>‘’ Why do you always spoil things for everybody.’’ Her sister Sansa began.<br/>
Arya turned around and bit her lip from words that were about to spill. She knew that it would make her mother only angrier. Her beautiful sister stared at her with a sour look only ever reserved for Arya and her so-called ‘’ questionable friends’’, whatever the hell that means.<br/>
You see, Sansa Stark was everything Arya most certainly was not. She was beautiful, ambitious, popular, smart. Well... the last one depended on who you asked, despite the fact that Sansa was now starting her second year at Hogwarts and leaving a perfect set of first-year grades behind, Arya often wondered why her dull sister was ever sorted in the house that stood out for its intelligence and wit, house Ravenclaw. Really, Ravenclaw? Her sister had the worst taste in friends, could never tell foe from a friend and really, really had terrible instincts. But then again, Arya was the stupid one according to Sansa. Because according to Sansa, her older sister was merely a kind-hearted person, a trait that was clearly foreign to Arya. ‘Bullshit!’ ( Arya signature reply) and by far a lie, Sansa could be a real bitch. Arya did admit of having the spectacular ability to curse and knew words children her age shouldn't know, or worse, use. It was another cause for the headaches that occurred in Catelyn Stark's busy life. </p><p>‘’ It’s not always about you, you do know that right?’’ Sansa continued.<br/>
Arya walked slowly to where her family was standing. All of them, her mother with Rickon in her arms, her youngest brother who was still years apart from attending the wizarding school, looked quite bored. Bran and Rob tried but failed to hide their amusing faces standing next to a very annoyed Sansa Stark.<br/>
The boys were at least smart enough to never interfere with the ‘’ladies drama,’’ That was how Theon always liked to refer to situations like these. He was sort of a brother too, adoptive brother, he used to be a real asshole, still was some times.<br/>
She sighed again, all of them looking perfectly with their Tully blue eyes and red hair, a perfect family, Arya knew she looked nothing alike. Jon, her loving brother but really her half brother, shared the same features as her but he, just like Theon, was not included in this family union. They had already left, probably in search of their friends. Rob had wanted to follow but before he could, Catelyn had dragged him by the ear reminding him that there was still a ‘’family meeting’’ to be held. </p><p>‘’ You're spoiling it for Bran, it’s his first year too, you know?’’<br/>
No! I don’t know, Arya wanted to scream, of course, she knew, gods, she hated the voice her sister used. How could she forget? If Sansa was mothers, favourite daughter than Bran was her favourite child. And who could really blame her? Bran was sweet, smart and caring, he was one of the only students to ever attend Hogwarts a year earlier than usual. When the letter arrived for Bran everybody had been so happy that Arya had thought the school had forgotten all about her. Luckily, her letter arrived later in the evening. She had been relieved, to say the least.<br/>
Arya never understood why Sansa always needed to end her sentences with question marks, as if Arya was so stupid she needed to be asked if she understood everything.<br/>
Her mother, now silent yet still fuming looked her down and up.</p><p>‘’ Fix your stockings, a lady always looks perfect, no matter the circumstances.’’<br/>
Arya huffed again, the stupid socks were itchy, long and somehow the one on her right leg, always managed to make its way down again.<br/>
Make me! She wanted to shout, but looking at the face of her younger brother Bran, made her realise that it was hopeless. And suddenly she felt guilty and embarrassed for making everything difficult again, not for Sansa but for Bran.<br/>
‘’Sorry.’’  She mumbled softly while putting her stocking up, trying to sound sincere. She didn't need to look up to see Sansa’s triumphally smile and her mother’s relieved looking face.<br/>
‘’Thanks,’’ Bran whispered softly while boxing her elbow. She offered him a small smile usually only reserved for her father and Jon. Her mother put Rickon to the ground and looked all her children one by one in the eye.<br/>
‘’Good, now we can begin. Always remember that you are Starks, you stick together and behave accordingly. I don’t want any bad news making its way to Winterfell this year.’’ The last part she had added while looking sternly at Robb. He had the grace to blush but still muttered, ‘’ that was all Theon’s fault, ask Jon.’’ It was the wrong thing to say to Catelyn however for she grabbed his chin not unkindly, forcing him to look her in the eye. ‘’Robb! you’re in your third year now for heaven's sake! You will not be persuaded or influenced by anyone, you hear me. You are a….’’</p><p>‘’… a Stark of Winterfell the eldest and you have younger siblings who look up to you.’’ Rob finished smiling, ‘’Yes, I know mom, I'm sorry.’’ 
And just like that Catelyn Tully Stark smiled again, Rob always had a way of making females smile at his charm, even his own mother. His charming character was contagious and Catelyn could never stay angry at her first boy for too long.<br/>
‘’Good, now, I want you to…’’ Catelyn turned her head to Sansa. Arya had already lost interest and tuned out her mother’s voice, this would take some time she figured. Besides, her mother usually finished off the meeting with Arya. Her septa had told her mother once that it was most likely for Arya to 'remember' things if it was said at the end of conversations. </p><p>Arya looked around her, people looking hasty but happy while trying to get to their destinations. Families standing off to see their children. Some muggles looking shy but curious as they spoke to others while trying to subtly stare at the magic around them. Arya had always been curious about muggles, how they lived and progressed with no amount of magic whatsoever, she admired it even. Yet, she couldn’t imagine a world without it. For Arya, there didn't seem to exist a world without the splendour that magic brought and she couldn’t wait to use the wand Jon had bought for her. She had named it Needle and it was perfect. They had gone together just the two of them when they had entered Mikken’s wand collection. It was stationed at Winterfell for ages and Arya had always liked the old man.<br/>
Arya had known from as long as she could remember that she was destined to be a witch, to be one with her wand. Her parents use to be very protective of her, still are sometimes, when she gets angry or frustrated. Arya believed their worry was merely because of the safety of others. Till this day her parents are still worried that she might harm others because of her wild and sudden tantrums. Arya did her best to stay calm at those moments, she never does it on purpose. Yet, sometimes people could make her so angry.<br/>
‘’Mother, can I have some coins for the sweets?’’ Bran asked suddenly as if remembering why he had been on his best behaviour. Catelyn sighed but with good humour and made to pinch his cheeks.</p><p>‘’ We’re dismissed I reckon?’’ Arya dared ask, she had tried to sound kind but knew from the looks around her that it had only sounded cold and distant. </p><p>‘’ Arya I want you to promise me that you’ll be on your best behaviour, no bullying your sister and for the love of gods don’t play with the…’’ Her mother went on and on, Arya started to tune everything out again.<br/>
‘’…I love you but you have to remember that when you’re at Hogwarts they know you as ‘lady Arya Stark’, which means you have a…’’<br/>
‘’… reputation to uphold, yes, yes I know mother, don’t disappoint, behave, study and be nice to your siblings.’’ Arya managed to say, repeating Robs earlier attempt at a sweet smile. She was sure it came out falsely, either way, her mother mirrored one of her own. </p><p>‘’ Good, now I know that your father wanted to be here, but if we're lucky we will see each other for the holidays and…’’ Her mother went on a bit about a few other things, Catelyn hugged each of her children carefully before pulling an annoyed Rickon up again.<br/>
Rob and Sansa already left in search of their friends. Despite their differences, they were a family and Catelyn Tully Stark loved each of her children fiercely.<br/>
It didn't take long before the whistle of the train could be heard and students and family alike said their last goodbyes. 

With one look at their shoulders, Arya and Brandon Stark stepped into the opening doors of the train. The Hogwarts Express was finally ready to depart, leaving a sudden teary-eyed Catelyn and a very clueless Rickon Stark standing on Platform 9 ¾  behind.</p>
