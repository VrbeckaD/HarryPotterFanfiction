    <p>
  <span>“—Your celibacy isn't doing you any favours.” Ron continued talking to Harry about his sex life in his own office after Harry had snapped at Clara the third time that day, which was bad, even for him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry took up a quill to write a response to the letter Clara had brought to him, “My celibacy isn't the problem. Your fuck face boss is. This is the third time Robards has blocked my team from the documents we need for the court.” Harry put down the quill before he managed to break it, in either a bout of errant magic or by simply holding it too tightly. It was a cheap quill- his firm bought them wholesale each month, and Harry's foul mood had bent it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mate, do you even know how long it has been since Catherine? Three years,” Ron answered his own question, “In that time you've gone on dates with exactly seven people, of whom you went on second dates with three, and fucked the grand figure of zero. You never go out either, and you've refused eighteen offers from four friends to set you up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron took a deep breath from his monologue and looked down at Harry, who was sitting at his desk with an impressive raised eyebrow, which he had definitely picked up from Hermione. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did Hermy run the numbers?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. Gin did. We're all worried, Harry. You're chained to your job.The members of the Wizengamot and Clara, who is an intern, see you more than your best friends do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you propose I do? Take off and leave the work to Martin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Taking Sunday off to actually attend family dinners instead of sending apologetic notes with Firewhiskey would be a start.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine. I'll come tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry? It’s Sunday today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry had only been absent three Sundays, yet Molly fed him like he was back from the Dursleys in a Ford Anglia. The dinner lulled him into a relaxed state, and was as effective as a tranquilizer to his alertness. Which was what he would swear to if anyone asked him why he let himself be cornered by Hermione Granger. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time the conversation with his best friend was over, Harry was a confused jumble of impressions, but he had somehow made a promise to Hermione to call in sick the next day to take Rose to an amusement park, since she couldn't due to her pregnancy, and Ron was like a child with muggle currency himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry thanked his lucky stars that Hermione had not made any mention of his lack of bed partners in the Weasley home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rose was asleep on Harry’s back by the time he Apparated back to the Weasley-Granger home to drop her off, Harry was tired as well. Running about with an excitable five year old was a different kind of tiring than dealing with curmudgeonly politicians, but Harry infinitely preferred the former. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he appeared inside the home, he was ambushed by Rose's parents. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can not keep taking days off for food poisoning,” he told Hermione as she tucked in her daughter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We're not asking you to. I know what it is like to want to bring about change and how hard it is, but running yourself to the ground isn't going to make anything better for any of the people you represent.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And? Fucking a random stranger is going to help the war orphans?” Harry knew he was being as unreasonable as they came. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Relaxing would help. And if fucking is the way to do that, then yes, it will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry cursed his big mouth sometimes because it meant that he was outside a concept club the Friday after the amusement park. A club whose name ‘Awãr’ literally translated to Average from Arabic. It was run by Millicent Bulstrode, who was apparently a good friend of Ginny since the war. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The club was a way ‘—</span>
  <em>
    <span>for people to meet others without the lenses of first impressions, or physical appearance clouding their judgement,’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>or so it said on the brochure that came along with all the legal documentation that Harry signed. He paraphrased it as, ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>We help you pull without your scars on display.’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The charms around the club changed a person’s appearance so that they were left bereft of any features that made them distinguishable.</span>
  <em>
    <span> A new face and a new beginning for each time that you come into the club</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the brochure promised. Security of a patron’s identity was ensured by the bracelets that were compulsory to wear and were non-removable by anyone except the wearer. Removing them meant  the Glamour would come off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It all sounded fantastical and vaguely dubious, but Harry tended to trust his friend’s judgement, and he wasn't a Gryffindor for nothing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked at his hands and wondered if they would feel different after the Glamour, or if it would be like all the charms they had applied during the war. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stepped in and signed the register at the front desk. He felt something cold washing over him, and realizing the Glamour had come into effect, he looked in the mirror beside the desk, feeling self conscious. He was taller than usual and his eyes had turned dark brown. His hair was still black but it sat slicked back on his head, not a single one out of place.His jawline had become less defined. He grinned at his reflection in the mirror. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bar and dancefloor were crowded with people, and Harry got a drink before he left for the dancefloor. The bumping and grinding going on there were vaguely familiar things to him. It was weird, not being approached by people on the merit of being ‘Harry Potter’ and yet not feeling the nausea and guilt that came with polyjuice. A trio of women were dancing near him, he heard a woman talking, “Jane is that you? I swear if you're Janice I'll hex you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He screwed up his courage and tapped the woman on her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dance with me?” They danced. Once dance turned to three as Harry learnt more about her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was a researcher on magical energies mixing it with Muggle physics to understand Gamp's laws of Elemental Transfiguration and The first thermodynamic Law of Energy Conservation, and how interwoven they both were to prove the origins of magic. She laughed deeply when Harry couldn't recall Gamp’s third law, but could declare all the 12 duties of magical citizens when he was half drunk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They let out rooms here, if you want to </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck, </span>
  </em>
  <span>you know.” The woman, Tracy, murmured into his ear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry knew and he wanted to.  He wanted the woman before him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stumbled into the room. Tracy kissed Harry with gusto that he had never felt even with Ginny. He went down on her -it was something Cathy had loved while they dated- and Tracy, who was so unlike his ex, moaned with pleasure. Later, they lay together in the bed, sated. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go on a date with me, David.” She ordered him. Harry looked at the woman beside him and wondered if he was lonely and reckless, or if he was brave and reckless as he assented and kissed her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tracy was a beautiful woman, even with the scars that ran all around her face. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Souvenirs </span>
  </em>
  <span>of a snatcher werewolf, along with her preference for too rare steak. She was just as nervous about showing her face to him on the first date as Harry was about telling her his real name. They soon got over it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dating her was a whirlwind of laughing and midnight tea sessions on full moon nights when she couldn't sleep. Dating her was how it felt to live with your best friend. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She reminded Harry to leave his job at the office, even as Harry stopped her from answering 3 am calls by her lab partner. Falling in love with her was the easiest descent Harry had experienced. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tracy made friends with Harry's group and they had a standing lunch appointment with Janice and Jane, identical twins who were polar opposites. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Tracy left for America for a few months  to forward her research, they dated via international portkeys and magically adapted telephones. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They dated long distance until Tracy ended things between them when she received a permanent professorship research post in Harvard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The breakup hurt, but not how Harry once would have imagined it would. It hurt because it was a breakup. It didn't hurt because he lost Tracy, because he hadn't really lost her. They still called and flooed with almost the same regularity, but Harry increased his workload marginally after she left, though not too much -six months of a good work-life balance was difficult to upturn, even for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The international portkeys decreased though. “They made me bloody nauseated anyways,” Tracy said over the floo one day, “ Are you still going to Awãr?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven't really gone clubbing since. It's not my scene and you know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you should. If not to date anyone then at least to meet new people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I meet the twins weekly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, they've adopted you and so they don't count. I'm your </span>
  <em>
    <span>ex</span>
  </em>
  <span> and it is all kinds of weird that I'm telling you to move on with someone else, but you deserve love. Please try?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded at her, “You tell me about Manish. Did you actually say yes to dinner with him?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tracy grinned at him, and it only made Harry's stomach tighten fractionally. “I did. But he had to cancel dinner due to his son Aarav’s cultural program at school. So he invited me to that instead and Harry, please don't laugh, but I think I might have a parenting kink.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry laughed and thought of the family he wanted as well as they said their goodbyes.</span>
