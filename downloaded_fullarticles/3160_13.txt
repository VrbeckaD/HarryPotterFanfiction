    <p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Newt Scamander was not spiting himself. He was here to lure out a ghost. As the trees and their spindly, twisted shadows closed in on him, Newt reminded himself that the letter was real, not an elaborate joke.</p><p>Besides, he was already several layers deep in the forest of Snod. Turning back at this point was not only a zero option but also an immense waste of his time.</p><p>Newt really had no choice here but to be practical. He would treat this odd excursion as another of his usual adventures out in the wild, searching out rare magical creatures. Nothing unusual here. Merlin’s beard, certainly nothing mental.</p><p>Pickett seemed to disagree nonetheless. The Bowtruckle squeaked uneasily in Newt’s coat pocket.</p><p>And just as Newt was about to hiss a reprimand, he saw it.</p><p>“Leta,” he croaked. But he stepped back, not sure of what to make of the familiar silhouette.  </p><p>Leta was glowing eerily in the early moonlight. Her smile, the rare burgundy crescent reserved just for Newt for as long back since Hogwarts, played on her face. She was on the verge of tears.</p><p>“Newt.”</p><p>Newt hesitated. Neither of them moved from their spots for a tense few seconds. Then Leta, ever the more daring of the two, swooped into his arms. Newt gathered her up into a fierce embrace, fearful that she would dissipate into the night, just like it had happened in his dreams those past two years.</p><p>You are real.</p><p>Leta’s silk robes slipped from his grip with an audible rustle. She was now holding him at arm’s length, her eyes round and grave. “You came alone---no one followed you?”</p><p>Newt suddenly remembered. He gestured at his coat pocket where Pickett was still reeling from the impact of their embrace.<br/>
“Just him,” he answered breathlessly.</p><p>Just like fairy laughter, Leta’s laugh echoed lightly into the night. “Oh, Newt,” she cried, hugging him more gently this time, but no less longingly. “I missed you!”</p><p>……………………………</p><p> </p><p>Several protection spells later, they were huddled up over a fresh fire in a clearing tucked deep in the woods. </p><p>“Why’d you go?”  Why’d you leave me? Newt meant to stay.</p><p>Leta looked as though that was the last question she wanted to answer now. She drew her knees up to her chin and spoke to the fire instead. “I needed time…and space… just to breathe and figure everything out.” She held up her hands and glared at her fingers as though they were wands she had not practiced with before.</p><p>Newt swallowed thickly. “Y-you didn’t have to do it alone.”</p><p>“I have been tamed all my life, Newt,” Leta snapped. Her gaze was sharp, feistier than he remembered. “You know what that made me do! But out here I get to be free, I get to be me. It’s where I ---”</p><p>“We thought you were dead,” Newt cut in, then cringed at the echo of his own voice.</p><p> Leta’s eyes swerved to the campfire, but not even the tricks of the flickering firelight could conceal the agony and shame. An awkward silence fell between them for what seemed like forever before Leta took the jump.</p><p>“Theseus…how is he?”</p><p>“He is happy,” Newt replied, for the lack of more appropriate words. But he could not exactly think of Gertrude Holloway or her betrothal to his elder brother as inappropriate.</p><p>The ghost of a grin came to Leta’s face but her eyes remained expressionless… unreadable. The Lestrange way. “He’s always been the kind to soldier on, your brother. Except, of course, when it came to you.” Then akin to a huntress closing in on a sleeping dragon, Leta’s voice dropped to a near whisper. “How about Tina?”</p><p>Tina.</p><p>“About Tina…” Newt started to say. How he wished Leta could stop looking at him like that. Like he were a dying puppy. The lump in his throat eventually subsided and he tried, much as he could, to say anything.<br/>
“The…the ICW sent her on a mission. Percival Graves has been leading an operation across Europe ever since … ever since Grindelwald got away. Queenie Goldstein is still missing. ”</p><p>“Newt, I’m so sorry…”</p><p>“When are you coming back?” Newt blurted out.  How long do you plan to stay?<br/>
Leta’s eyes widened. She jerked her head aside as if the mere gesture would erase his implied query. Newt could no longer help himself.</p><p>“You can’t run forever, Leta.”</p><p>“Whatever from, Newt?”</p><p>“Answers!”</p><p>In spite of himself, Newt drew back. He just had to. Leta had stiffened more like how gnomes did after their masters dipped them in icy water. But Newt was no cruel person like the gnome masters were, nor was he planning to be one. So he weighed his words, cleared his throat and elaborated more calmly.</p><p>“You can’t do this all your life, Leta…run off when it’s time to confront your fears or… those you love. You’re not nearly afraid of your powers, or hurting anyone than you are of staying and experiencing hurt. You want to be lost in the wild so that no one can get close enough.  ”</p><p>“This is all Dumbledore, isn’t it?” Leta grunted.</p><p>“Don’t change the subject.” It was a plea, not an order. And Leta seemed as certain of that as Newt was. She straightened herself up, and finally turned to look at him in silent disbelief. But it was the good kind of disbelief.</p><p>Go on, she appeared to be daring him.</p><p>And Newt obliged. “I know you trust no one. Not even me. But it doesn’t have to be that way.” He bore his eyes into hers. They were the color of dark well water in a starless sky, rippling on and on. How he wished he could get through the tight vaults he knew had closed off her heart… “Let me find you, Leta. Let me help you…that’s all I ask.”</p><p>Stay.</p><p>Leta was putting up the walls again. But it was not long before they crumbled down with her. Newt swiftly reached for her face. And the swell of her cheek was wet and quivery under the touch of his fingers. She sobbed freely in the cup of his hand, then stopped as abruptly as she had started. Newt dropped his hand grudgingly.</p><p>Lowering her gaze to Newt’s coat pocket, Leta addressed Picket the Bowtruckle, whom had been watching her quietly. “Pickett, do you have room for one more?” </p><p>Pickett jumped with a chirp. After all it was not uncommon for creatures to mirror their owners’ emotions.</p><p>“Fine, Newt,” Leta answered finally. “I will stay.” </p><p>No more words were left to spend. The fire crackled on like a distant round of applause.</p>
