<p align="justify">OoOoO</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Get the post Dudley,” Vernon said, eyes on his morning paper.</p>
<p align="justify">Dudley huffed and opened his mouth even as he spun his Smelting Stick but Petunia interrupted him as she moved past Vernon, gently touching his shoulder as she passed him. “I’ll get it dear, you eat your breakfast Dudley,”</p>
<p align="justify">Harry kept his eyes on his plate as he hurriedly finished his food, there was no telling when Dudley would decide that he desperately needed Harry’s meagre food. Dudley shifted and gave Harry a sharp poke in the ribs with the Smelting Stick, Harry winced and gave Dudley dark look before shoving the last bite of his toast into his mouth. Dudley waited for Harry to take a drink of his water and gave him a harder poke with the Stick making Harry choke on his water and start coughing. Vernon didn’t even look up as he snapped at Harry for causing a commotion, Harry rolled his eyes and tried to ignore his cousin’s glee.</p>
<p align="justify">Petunia was gone for several minutes before she came back with two pieces of mail in her hand, she was even paler than usual with red splotches on her cheekbones and her pale blue eyes as hard as ice. “I’ll be taking the boy to the doctor’s today, Vernon,” She said, voice icy and hard. “He’s been accepted into my sister’s school so I’ll need to make sure his inoculations are up to date since he’s no longer going to Stonewall.” Vernon’s head had snapped up and he stared at her in mute horror as he paled rapidly. “I’ll organise somewhere for him to stay for the rest of the summer and for an appropriate wardrobe, no need to bother you or Dudley with the details,”</p>
<p align="justify">Vernon closed his open mouth that had been ready to start shouting and looked at Dudley who was looking at his mother curiously before he nodded slowly. “Whatever you think is best pet, boarding school might straighten him out and get him out of our hair,” He stood and carefully hugged her, Harry watched them out of the corner of his eye as he sipped the last of his water and wondered what the hell was happening and if he was getting kicked out. Harry noted that Vernon’s hands were shaking slightly and Petunia was so stiff and tense that it was a wonder that she didn’t shatter when Vernon touched her. They hugged for a long minute before Vernon pulled back and pressed a kiss to her forehead. “I love you,” He said quietly and she relaxed minutely. “I love you,” He repeated and they looked at each other for a long quiet moment. “I’ll take the next couple of days off and Dudley and I can have some bonding time, let you get on with it without us being under foot, okay?”</p>
<p align="justify">She nodded and relaxed a little more. “Yes, that sounds perfect,”</p>
<p align="justify">Harry and Dudley exchanged a look before going back to ignoring each other, Vernon and Petunia would do something with them once they stopped being weird but neither preteen wanted to deal with the weird before they had to. Petunia went to make a few calls and Vernon started asking Dudley whether he wanted go to the cinema or there was a boxing tournament starting today, Dudley asked if they could do both and Vernon happily agreed. Harry couldn’t help noticing that Vernon didn’t look at him, not once in the hour before they left for their day out.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">OoOoO</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Once they had left and Petunia had finished her calls she made herself a cup of tea and pulled the thick parchment envelope from her pocket, she tapped it on the table twice before flicking it towards Harry who she had called out of his cupboard to join her.</p>
<p align="justify">“Magic,” she said with disgust and revulsion. “Is real, you are a wizard, your freak parents were magical too. You will be going that boarding school where they will teach you magic along with the other freak brats. I’ve organised a hotel for you to say at for the rest of the summer as of tomorrow, you have a doctor’s appointment in two hours for your inoculations and tomorrow I will take you to get appropriate clothes for school and then take you to London, I will show you to where you can access the magical district and how to take the train to school.” She took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “I will not answer questions, you will pack what things you wish to keep into your backpack tonight to be ready first thing in the morning, everything left behind will be burned. Take this-” She shoved a piece of paper at him along with a pen. “And write an acceptance note addressed to Professor McGonagall,” Petunia watched him write it before nodding sharply. “There should be an owl somewhere close by, give it to the bird and get out of my sight,”</p>
<p align="justify">Harry scampered from the table with his letter and his acceptance note. He froze when Petunia spoke again. “You will not discuss this with Dudley, if I hear one word about this from him, I’ll drown you,” Harry had grown up with idle death wishes, the occasional death threat and the far more common occasional beating and idle smack whenever he did anything freakish or annoyed them but for the first time he really believed that Petunia would find a way to kill him if Dudley found out about magic.</p>
<p align="justify">Heart pounding Harry ducked outside to the backyard and not even three steps outside he was startled by a large barn owl who swooped over and landed on his shoulder causing him to stumble forward. “Are you here to take my note?” He asked once he had caught his balance and the owl bobbed its head at him. “Here you go, thanks!” It launched itself up off his shoulder and Harry watched it fly off with a white piece of paper in one claw.</p>
<p align="justify">A couple more steps lead to Harry sitting under the one tree in the backyard, he unfolded his letter reverently, fear for his life or not there wasn’t Harry could do about it and he was going to a <em>magic </em>school.</p>
