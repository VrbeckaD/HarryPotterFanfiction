    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>The war turned everyone upside down. People who had planned to be healers were transformed into killers. The ones who wanted to teach ended up torturing others for information. Lovers became enemies, wives became widows, families torn in two. The warmest, most open hearts were turned to ice and once in a great while, a heart hidden deep in the shadows found its way into the light.</p>
<p>Of course like any good war, it raged on for years, sometimes so quietly and so well concealed that the average wizard forgot it was even happening, imagining that it was someone else’s problem. Then a skirmish would break out in Chester or the Death Eaters would swoop in from their stronghold in Wiltshire and it would be front page news again for a week or two until something more salacious came along. As the fight raged on the final outcome of the war became a matter of faith as neither Harry Potter nor Voldemort had been seen in over a year and fanatical believers on each side were eagerly awaiting a second coming at any moment that would bring an end to it all. The battle had become a religion.</p>
<p>In the meantime, any information that could crack through the armies’ longstanding armor was an invaluable asset, and high ranking soldiers on either side were sought out for huge bounties based on what they knew or who they could give up; particularly if they had grown up in the place where the enemy currently held themselves behind impenetrable ancient wards.</p>
<p>That was how Hermione Granger found herself in the South of France at an outrageously lush and exclusive hotel in Monaco. She sat in the lobby with a glass of absurdly priced champagne and a platinum blonde wig, watching the guests file past on their way to the casinos and clubs or giggling and drunk on their way back to their rooms. It was two a.m. and her research told her that he traveled by night. Sure enough, at 2:45 she saw him emerge from the bank of elevators looking, she had to admit, breathtakingly gorgeous in a pair of black pants and black v-neck sweater that stretched perfectly across his chest. She hadn’t seen him in over two years and in that time he’d clearly adapted well to life on the run. His usually pale, sunken features had a little hint of a tan, a brightness in his eyes. His once meticulous white hair was a bit closer to golden, artfully tousled, hiding one eye. He glanced around the hotel lobby, stuck his hands in his pockets and walked right past her, heading for the gilded revolving doors. Monte Carlo was a magical place for muggles for sure, but it also had a wizard district, and when she followed him out into the evening air she knew he was headed right for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was a warm night and he walked slow, admiring the scenery, the women, the moon on the water. This was a big enough city for him to get lost in and he felt comfortable going out and enjoying himself every once in a while. He’d earned it. After hiding out in Avignon for six months he’d grown tired of rural wizard life. Yes, the wide eyed shop girls and milkmaids were easily lured into his bed and they accepted his little trinkets and kind gestures as if he were some sort of magnanimous prince and not a selfish sex starved prat, but after a while it was like hexing frogs in a cauldron. He needed a bit of a challenge…intellectually, of course. Here in Monaco he didn’t mind being a small fish in big pond, as long as there were enough female fish and enough bottles of firewhiskey to keep him in good spirits.</p>
<p>He made his way to the Avenue de la Madone where he found the entrance to the wizard district. It was small, but extremely decadent and in the short time he’d taken up residence there he’d made a name for himself in the gaming rooms and gentlemen’s clubs, so that finally he felt like the Malfoys used to feel - top of the heap, calling the shots. There was still the matter of the mark on his forearm that ached every once in a while as they tried to call him back; but he’d taught himself how to shut out everything, even the summoning of the other Death Eaters. For the first time in a long time he was comfortable in his skin. Of course, no one here knew that he was in hiding, laying low until the war was over one way or the other. He’d lost so much in the years that he fought for and, frankly against wizard England that he barely cared anymore if it survived or if every single wizard there was reduced to a pile of charred bones. Neither side could lay claim to purity or fair fighting, even the light had a dark underbelly. Maybe that’s what England needed…a fresh start. It had done wonders for him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*****</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He settled into a red velvet booth in a dark corner of The Succubus, a strip joint that offered lovely extracurriculars to the right customers for the right price. A server brought him a bottle of champagne and two glasses.</p>
<p>“I didn’t order this, love,” he said, leaning to the side to look around her, watching the show on the stage. If he didn’t know better he’d think the little minx swinging her ass around the pole was old Loony Lovegood…but…filthier. Not a bad look.</p>
<p>“It’s compliments of the woman at the bar,” the server said, nodding towards a curvy little thing perched on a stool.</p>
<p>Draco looked her over, impressed with the knee high leather boots with an impossible heel; the long legs poured into a tight black pencil skirt that was slit up almost to her hip. She had a nipped in waist and a very ‘sexy librarian’ looking white collared shirt that stretched across her perky little tits.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you tell her to come pay her compliments herself,” he said, throwing a galleon on the waitress’ tray.</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” she said, tucking the coin into her bra.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*****</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You can go over now,” the server said, approaching Hermione. “I think he’s already got a stiffy if you’re interested.”</p>
<p>“I’m not,” she said, draining her firewhiskey, “but thanks for the help."</p>
<p>The light in the club was dark and blue tinged, occasionally swirling with bursts of charmed stars or sparks that added to the lap dances going on in the various booths. The music was loud, the air filled with smoke, and her identity was easily concealed inside the club. With a quick check of her compact mirror she fixed her blood red lipstick and touched up her dark, smoky eye shadow. She smoothed the bangs on her bobbed wig and undid one last button, revealing a hint of the lace that lined the cups of her white bra.\</p>
<p>He watched her preening at the bar and poured two glasses of champagne. She wasn’t like the other strippers or escorts. First of all she was far too clothed, and her outfit was…sophisticated, not…slutty. But she wasn’t a usual customer either. He knew the ins and outs of The Succubus as well as their preferred guest list, and if he’d seen her before he’d have taken her home, or at least to one of the back rooms to take her for a spin. As she turned to approach him he stretched his arms out across the back of the booth, crossing his long legs at the ankle, his trademark arrogant smirk spreading across his lips.</p>
<p>“Can I sit down?” She asked, one hand on her hip, causing her shirt to pull across her chest, revealing the tops of her creamy, beautiful, suckable…</p>
<p>“Of course you can, sweetheart, it’s just a question of where,” he drawled, uncrossing his legs.</p>
<p>She nearly started laughing, amazed that she hadn’t been found out immediately, and even further that he was now flirting with the girl he’d all but threatened to kill for six years. </p>
<p>“Oooh, so tempting,” she purred, curling up beside him on the velvet covered seat, her legs tucked up underneath her, half of her face hidden by her hair.</p>
<p>She took one of the glasses of champagne and sipped it. It had cost half of her allotted expenses and she would be damned if she wasn’t going to partake. Draco leaned in, tucking her hair back so he could put his lips near her ear.</p>
<p>“What’s your name, darling?” he asked, struggling to be heard over the loud music.</p>
<p>His hand moved to her knee, his thumb brushing the skin of her thigh and she was shocked at how quickly goosebumps raised along her arms. Was it his touch or the feeling of his mouth against her ear, the little wet sounds of his words, the warm puffs of air over her skin?</p>
<p>“Does it matter?” she asked coyly, pulling her skirt up another inch, just baiting the trap. “Can’t we keep it anonymous? After all, we’re both only here for one thing, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>His hand roamed higher, much higher than she expected, only inches from her panties, his tongue tracing the shell of her ear. She felt the tiny muscles between her legs clench, pulsing with unexpected arousal. It had been a long time since anyone had touched her like this, flirted like this. His thumb dared to whisper a stroke along the gusset of her panties and she gasped, nearly pulling away completely. But she couldn't chicken out now. She’d come too far.</p>
<p>“And what is that, kitten?” He kissed the soft skin beneath her ear, his tongue flicking out across her jawbone, her throat.</p>
<p>Who was this Malfoy? She’d never seen Draco so much as hold a girl’s hand during their time at Hogwarts and now he was literally trying to get inside her pants twenty seconds after she sat down. The mission was quickly going off the rails. She should have revealed herself before now. She was supposed to get close, grab him and disapparate. The end. Now it seemed her pussy was running the show, wondering how far she could push him, how far she could push herself.</p>
<p>But this was Draco Malfoy. And she was Hermione Granger. And she wasn’t here to get laid. She blinked, breathed and strengthened her resolve. She could play this part and still get him secured. She would come out on top. So to speak.</p>
<p>“I’m looking to get you,” she said finally, grabbing his jaw and kissing him hard on the mouth.</p>
<p>His lips were glorious, soft and full, moving expertly against hers, his tongue warm and smooth, darting forward to tempt her, a groan vibrating against her lips. She pushed against him chest, thrusting her tongue deep into his mouth as he tangled his hands into her hair…her wig. To distract him she threw her leg over both of his, straddling his hips, pulling his hands down to hold her waist, as her skirt hiked up to her ass. He was already hard and she actually felt herself getting wet as he bucked up between her spread legs.</p>
<p>“You’ve got me, love,” he said, pulling back to look her in the eyes, “where shall we go to celebrate your victory?” </p>
<p>She pulled off her wig, shook out her hair and smiled when his eyes went wide in recognition.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking we should go back to London,” she said. “What do you say, Malfoy?”</p>
<p>Pulling her wand from the holster at the back of her skirt, she wrapped her arms loosely around his neck and with an echoing crack, the two of them were gone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*****</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As soon as their feet hit the floor in the decidedly less opulent hotel room that Hermione had rented, Draco pushed away from her hard enough that she fell to the floor.</p>
<p>“You fucking mu—bitch!”</p>
<p>But before he could get another word out she pointed her wand and yelled</p>
<p>“Stupefy!” and he fell to the floor in an angry but unconscious heap.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>****</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco blinked back to consciousness but found himself still unable to move.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna rip your fucking throat out Granger,” he growled, straining against the thick wizard shackles that she’d fastened to his wrists and threaded through the post of the headboard. They were made of a strong metal alloy that dampened magic, so any wandless jinxes or hexing, even apparating was out. He was also stripped down to his boxer briefs so she’d obviously taken his wand, money, hotel key…dignity. “Granger! Where are you?”</p>
<p>He was enraged, but a good portion of it was directed inwards. It was his own fault for letting his guard down, for accepting drinks from a stranger and following his cock right into her fucking trap. Of course, who would have expected the curvy, sexy, long legged vixen at the strip club to be Granger? When she’d pulled off her wig he’d nearly laughed, if he’d had the time. Sure, he’d imagined defiling the loudmouth bitch for years, bending her over one of her precious library tables and fucking her senseless, making her beg for his cock, but those were just jack off scenarios…nothing he would ever imagine coming to fruition. She was cold as ice in school, nose in the air, body hidden beneath black robes and big sweaters. A few of the Slytherin girls had even suggested she was a lesbian for all the care she gave to impressing boys, which only added to her mystique.</p>
<p>The door to the adjoining bathroom clicked open and she emerged from a cloud of raspberry scented steam, a towel wrapped around her hair, a white satin robe cinched at her waist, revealing her curves once again. </p>
<p>“Sorry Malfoy,” she said with a smile, “had to take a shower. I was feeling a little…filthy.”</p>
<p>He snorted and rolled his eyes at her, “I wasn’t the one crawling into your lap, darling.”</p>
<p>“And I wasn’t the one shoving my fist up your crotch.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Granger…” he said, clucking his tongue. “If you thought that was my fist, then my assumptions about your experience in this arena are confirmed.”</p>
<p>She flipped the towel off of her hair and it fell in smooth, damp waves down her back, a few strands sticking to her cheeks, still pink from the shower, a tiny cluster of soap suds stuck to the hollow above her collarbone. He was getting angry again.</p>
<p>“For fuck’s sake, Granger, let me out of these cuffs. What the hell is this all about?” He snarled, lunging forward, trying to break the headboard, the metal cuffs cutting painfully into his wrists.</p>
<p>She leaned forward, resting her hands on the mattress and Draco could see down the front of her robe to the tops of her breasts, and the look on her face let him know that she knew damn well what she was doing.</p>
<p>“It’s about taking you home to London, Malfoy, and getting 400 galleons in reward. There’s a bounty on your pretty blonde head and I’m going to get it.” </p>
<p>He let his head loll back against the headboard, closing his eyes.</p>
<p>“A bounty. You know I was cleared of all that Hogwart’s mess, Granger.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes and sat on the edge of the bed, finger combing her damp hair.</p>
<p>“I know that, but we need different information now, and I’m sure you’ll be able to give it.”</p>
<p>Hermione Granger, the queen of seeking out information. Of course she’d end up turning bounty hunter for the Order. And of course she’d come after him, probably couldn't raise her hand for the job fast enough. How fucking cold <em>was </em>this dish of revenge?</p>
<p>His voice went a bit lower, a bit sultry,</p>
<p>“Listen sweetheart, why don’t you just ask me what they need to know and I’ll tell you. You can relay the message and then we can forget this whole thing, you can buy me breakfast and I can go back to my little paradise.”</p>
<p>“Your little paradise of hanging out in brothels?” She asked, standing up again, looking out between the curtains of the front window.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t a brothel Granger,” he said with a snort. “If you have a few free minutes later I can take you to a brothel. I’m sure it would be very eye opening. Helpful even. I mean, you seem a little wound up.”</p>
<p>She spun around from the window, her eyes as fiery as second year. But it looked far sexier on a twenty five year old body, with wet hair and pink skin, fresh from the shower. He didn’t like how he reacted to it. Swotty muggle. She had no fucking business making his dick twitch.</p>
<p>“Wound up? Malfoy, I was playing a part to get your guard down,” she said, a bit too forcefully, her cheeks going red. </p>
<p>“You do a much better job getting things up, darling. I could recommend you to the owner if you like, everyone likes the naughty schoolgirl routine.”</p>
<p>She leaned in close to him, crawling across the bed but staying just out of his reach, taunting the dragon.</p>
<p>“Especially you, I noticed,” she said, her eyes flicking down to the bulge in his briefs. "You seemed to be standing at attention the minute I sat down."</p>
<p>But if she was trying to fluster him, she’d have to try a bit harder. He pulled forward on the cuffs again, a bit slower this time; his lean, muscular arms stretched out behind him, his throat and chest straining as he lunged towards her smirking face, his tongue flicking out to lick his bottom lip.</p>
<p>“And your panties were wet, little mudblood,” he said, only to be met with a sharp slap across his face.</p>
<p>He laughed and leaned back against the headboard, crossing his legs casually and closing his eyes, feigning sleep. Advantage Malfoy.</p>
