    <p>Pansy swiped her hand through her wet pixie cut trying to catch her breath as she stood in front of the bathroom mirror. The women’s restroom was packed but she paid no mind to the women around her instead, taking a moment longer than most would to straighten herself up. Her white horned mask was still perfectly in place. She had spelled her makeup to be waterproof as anything less would be foolish to wear at Club Wave. </p>
<p>Her pale hands straightened her white halter top, before smoothing down her white skirt. She had enchanted her outfit to be mostly waterproof so it didn’t show off her assets fully under the water. You could wear another color to the club but white was preferred for the black light spell they cast at midnight. Lighting up the whole club to look like the dark depths of the ocean. Shoving her anxiety away, Pansy straightened her spine before swaying out of the bathroom. </p>
<p>She tried not to squeak as strong arms pulled her into a dark corner. Her body was pushed against the cold stone wall as rough lips crashed down on her. The only thing that kept her from pulling out her wand was the flash of the iridescent dragon tooth. Her hands slipped over the man's shoulders, threading themselves through his wet hair. The kiss became hungry quickly, Pansy sinking her teeth into his bottom lip several times. He let out a growl forcing his tongue into her mouth, battling for dominance.</p>
<p>Pansy moaned softly as his hands wandered up the front of her halter top, his hands cupping her breasts roughly. Her breath came out in pants as he stepped away from her heated body. She could feel his eyes trace over her, her nipples clearly seen through her top from his touch. </p>
<p>“Come back to my place,” he told her his voice coming out in a rough husk. </p>
<p>Pansy tried to ignore the sound of blood rushing through her ears as arousal pooled between her legs. Her mind drifted to Draco when she left him though he was aggressively making out with another man. She figured he wouldn’t want to be interrupted. Figuring she could tell him later, Pansy stretched out her hand, nodding her head slightly. </p>
<p>The man’s touch was firm as he led the way to the club entrance. Not stopping once to look around for anyone or grab anything. Once outside he paused to let Pansy catch her breath. </p>
<p>“I’ll let you choose if the masks stay on or not?” he told her as he turned to look down at her. With her boots on he was only an inch or so taller than her. </p>
<p>Pansy chewed on her lower lip thinking for a moment. “They can stay on,” she told him getting into position to sidelong apparate with him. </p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>They arrived in darkness, the man telling her to hold on for a second as he flicked his wand. The light from the candles revealed a decent sized flat and the man standing next to a minibar. He gestured to the selection, asking if she wanted anything. To which she shook her head to, she had just enough at the club to give her a light buzz. She had a feeling she needed her wits about her tonight. </p>
<p>“We can do this as most do this, or I can unlock something new for you. Something you’ve probably thought of doing, but you have an image to protect. What shall it be little one?” he asked staying on the other side of the room from her. </p>
<p>Pansy paced for a moment, looking around at the flat. Taking in how impersonal it was. It was fully in order, something she had never seen before in a single man’s house. She arched her brow before sitting in one of the chairs. </p>
<p>“I need to know first if you’re attached to anyone? I don’t need anyone to get all vengeful and come after me. I have enough people who can’t stand me as is,” she mused. </p>
<p>The man chuckled, moving to the seat across from her. “No to be honest I don’t even live here full time. I reside in Romania and visit here when it suits me. I’ve been at Club Wave so frequently because someone caught my attention,” he replied with a wink from beneath his red dragon mask. </p>
<p>Pansy was thankful her mask hid her blush. She averted her eyes, unsure why she felt so flustered under this man’s gaze. “What if I want to stop during this new experience?” </p>
<p>“You only need say worm and I’ll stop or slug and I’ll slow down,” he told her his eyes watching for her reaction. He laughed as her mouth twisted in a grimace. “They’re not normal words uttered during sex makes one take notice and stop quickly,”  </p>
<p>Pansy nodded her understanding. Her eyes focused on the wall for a moment before nodding once more. “Alright.”</p>
<p>“Stand up,” the man commanded his voice firm. </p>
<p>Standing slowly, Pansy felt her breath catch in her throat as she waited. He approached his eyes flashing beneath the fierce mask as he began circling her. Stopping behind her he reached out, easily untying her top. Throwing it to the side his fingers traced over her neck, sliding slowly over the sides of her pert breasts. He pressed his firm body against her back, instructing her not to move as he removed her skirt. </p>
<p>Leaving her in her white g-string, he instructed her to kneel with her legs spread, her hands atop her thighs, palms up. He told her to wait there as he went to the far was revealing a hidden panel. Pansy’s eyes took in each of the items he took out. He returned with items in hand, kneeling in front of her with each item laid out so she could fully see them. </p>
<p>“Since this is our first time together, I’ll be taking it lightly. We need to establish trust for some of the stuff I have and enjoy doing. For now, I have a candle, a collar with a leash and a pair of handcuffs that are easy to get out of. Now if any of these are too much I can put them back. Otherwise, we can start building that trust.”</p>
<p>Pansy felt her thigh muscles straining but held her position as her eyes gazed at the items. A thrill went through her for each one but nothing close to fear. “These are alright,” she told him simply. </p>
<p>He tsked wagging a finger in front of her masked face. “I’ll need you to finish your replies from now on with Master,” he husked as he picked up the collar, standing up to look down upon her. </p>
<p>She raised her head to meet his hungry gaze, exposing her pale neck to him. “Yes, Master,” she whispered. <br/>He snapped the collar around her neck easily, before clipping on the collar. “Come pet,” he called as he scooped up the other items to lead the way to his bedroom. </p>
<p>Her new Master made a clicking sound as he motioned for her to jump on to the bed as if she were a cat. His fingers slid from her hair, down along her arched back once she was on her hands and knees on the bed. </p>
<p>“Good, girl,” he praised. “This will be a long night so I want to give you some cream before we get to it,” he told her dropping the leash to begin undressing. </p>
<p>Pansy’s hazel eyes widened a touch as his freckled skin was revealed. Her teeth sunk into her bottom lip as her eyes traveled down the trail of red hair that led to the top of his trousers. He efficiently removed his clothes, taking his time to show her exactly what she was in for. She had the urge to reach out but something in his lust-filled eyes taunted her to do it, in a way telling her she’d regret it if she did. </p>
<p>“I knew I chose well,” he growled as he stepped forward his thick cock fully at attention. </p>
<p>His fingers dug into her hair, guiding her lips to his cock slow enough that she could say the magic word if she desired. Instead Pansy darted out her tongue to lap at the precum beaded on the tip of his cock. He tsked but pushed her forward without a reprimand. Once his member passed her soft lips the Dragon began fucking her mouth at a slow pace, letting her adjust to his girth. </p>
<p>Soon he was fucking her face almost harder than anyone had fucked her cunt. All the while his opposite hand smoothed along her back, petting her as he showered her with praise. “Such a good girl. That’s it kitten, take it all. You’re such a beautiful kitten earning your treat well. Obedient little slut, get ready for your treat,” he growled finally. </p>
<p>Pansy surprised herself, swallowing the salty cream as if it really was a treat. The wetness between her legs had tripled since arriving, she was surprised she hadn’t experienced her own orgasm while being used. </p>
<p>Fingers snapped loudly in front of her face bringing her back to the present. “We’re not done yet, kitten unless you feel like saying one of those magical words,”</p>
<p>“No, Master,” she husked her voice raw from the throat fucking she received. <br/>“Wonderful, I want you to lay your head against the pillow, face down, and put your hands behind your back,” he instructed as he lit grabbed the handcuffs lined in black fur. </p>
<p>The click of the restraints, panicked Pansy for a moment before she felt the strong hand pet along her back, soothing her once more. With a flick of his wand, the red candle was lit. An unexpected sting radiated through her left ass cheek as he spanked her, followed by the same pain radiating through the right one. After several smacks, he rubbed her ass with both palms soothing her pain. His fingers hooked in the sides of her panties, pulling them down slowly. </p>
<p>With her body fully exposed he reached for the candle. Gently dripping it along her back to give her a taste of it. When he saw she was aroused from it he smirked under his mask. His free hand trailed between her ass cheeks, stopping as they reached her sopping cunt. The Dragon tilted the candle just right causing a stream of wax to drip over the curve of her backside as his finger slid easily inside of her. </p>
<p>Not waiting long he slid in a second finger, smirking at her reaction to the mix of pain and pleasure. He scissored his fingers slowly, his thumb reaching out to press against her bundle of nerves. Her cries of pleasure, was music to his ear, causing his cock to grow hard once more. With his control over her and himself firmly in place, he commanded her to come on his fingers. A groan left his throat to mix with her moans as her cunt fluttered around his fingers. </p>
<p>Setting the candle aside, he removed his fingers slowly. Reaching over, he pulled a condom from the side drawer. He preferred the first time to use the muggle way of birth control, as they were easier to have and less expensive than birth control potions. After he slid the condom on the Dragon moved to cage his new pet in, his lips trailing along her neck. </p>
<p>“Are you okay my pet? Are you ready?” he growled his questions softly as he nipped at her ear. </p>
<p>“Yes, Master,” she whispered her voice breathless. </p>
<p>With a smirk, he slowly sank into his new pet savoring the feel of her wrapped around his thick cock. Taking in the look of pleasure only her open mouth gave a hint of. He stretched her slowly easing her into it with shallow thrusts till he was fully seated inside her. He only hesitated a minute before he set a brutal pace, bringing them both to high heights before he quickly slowed to shallow thrusts once more. A whine escaped her throat as her fingers clenched the pillow when he did it the fourth time. </p>
<p>“Please, Master?” Pansy gasped as she was denied a fifth time the release she was desperate for. </p>
<p>His pace picked up once more, harder than any of the other times. Urging her to come with him. Their growls and pants filling the room as the bed squeaked, banging against the wall. He growled his praises as she clenched around his cock milking it for every last seed it could get. </p>
<p>~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Pansy sighed as her wrists were released. Her male companion told her to stay as he left the bed. He returned quickly set down a variety of items on the nightstand. She had her eyes closed, her breathing ragged, but she could make out the thud of each object. First warm cloth cleaned gently between her legs. Nimble fingers peeled away the wax gently before the freshly dipped rag cleaned up the residue from the wax. She was gently turned over and sat up before he handed her a bottle of water.</p>
<p>Once he was sure he led her to the bathroom to use it before returning her to bed. Pansy had never felt so pampered after sex or so cared for at any time in her life. The tears welled up in her eyes as he enclosed her in his embrace, the covers encasing them. </p>
<p>“You did so well, pet. May I remove your mask so you can sleep?” he whispered into the darkness of the room. </p>
<p>Seeing no harm in it, Pansy simply nodded. His fingers slid under the edge. Pulling it away to set it on the nightstand before he did it with his own mask. Pansy kept her eyes closed, not quite ready to see who she had slept with. A light kiss grazed her lips as she drifted into a deep sleep. </p>
<p>~~~~~~~</p>
<p>The next morning Pansy awoke alone in the large bed. She tried to stifle her disappointment as she clutched the blanket to her bare chest. Shimmering hazel eyes took in the scant room before turning to the nightstand. She was mildly surprised to find a note resting against her mask. </p>
<p>If you wish to continue building trust together, meet back here in five days. Leave the mask at home and dress in a red dress. </p>

<p>Charlie Weasley arrived in Romania that morning ready to get back to work, sure inside that she would do what she was told. She was a good pet after all.</p>
