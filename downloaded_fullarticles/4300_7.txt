    <p>
  <span>Percival wasn’t always like this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a time when he could walk down the street and not feel eyes on himself, when he didn’t need to pay attention to his surroundings at all times.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps being kidnapped and held prisoner by someone who stole his face and impersonated him for months really </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> changed him, in spite of what everyone else thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Most of the time, he could simply look around and see that no one was following him, that everyone else was minding their own business.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But today is… different.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It feels like a wand being held to the back of his head as he walks down the street with Newt. They aren’t quite comfortable touching in public yet, but a part of him is so excited he could sweep Newt up and kiss him for hours right there on the sidewalk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every time he’s considered it, he feels that </span>
  <em>
    <span>wrongness</span>
  </em>
  <span> behind them and stops.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival turns around and sees a long coat disappear into an alleyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He acts like he didn’t see it. If they’re this stupid, it’ll be easy to take them down, even if they </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span> one of Grindelwald’s followers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt’s apparently oblivious, carrying his suitcase with his chin held high. Percival knows some people will judge them for what they’ve decided, but they both wanted this, and neither of them is interested in what others have to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stop in front of a shop window and Newt practically presses his nose to the glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be right back,” Newt says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival smiles at him, and Newt lingers for just a moment. It’s… hard not to touch him, to feel what grows inside him even if it’s too young and small to be detected by anyone other than a mediwitch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The presence returns, closer than it’s dared to be so far, and Percival watches Newt on the other side of the glass for a moment. If they’re this bold, they might go after Newt, and he can’t risk that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He apparates to where the presence is, and is shocked when whoever it is doesn’t apparate away. Instead, they try to run, and Percival just has to reach out and grab their trailing coat to catch them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pulling them back, he spins them and slams them into the brick of the building behind which they’d been hiding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck do you want?” he asks before he even registers their face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t expect two big, brown eyes to stare back at him, or the complete terror he sees in them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“M—Mr. Graves, I…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival looks over the face again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s only seen Credence Barebone once before, when Goldstein dragged him out to prove how the boy was mistreated by his mother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival remembers the reports, how Credence had been Grindelwald’s pawn, and the damage that had been done by him. No one knew how complicit Credence had truly been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You here to finish what Grindelwald started?” Percival growls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence’s eyes twitch downwards and then back to Percival’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What poison did he leave behind in you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those eyes get even bigger and Credence opens his mouth to reply just as a shadow falls over them from the end of the alleyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it, dear?” Newt’s voice rings out, and Percival curses himself for not finishing this before Newt could get close enough to be harmed as well. “Who is…” Newt’s footsteps echo in the enclosed space before he stops a few paces away. “Credence?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence flinches and pushes himself against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not to escape, Percival realizes, but to cower.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was following us,” Percival says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt pulls Percival’s hands off of the boy’s shoulders. “I wasn’t sure you’d survived, Credence,” he says, his voice low and gentle, the way it is for all frightened creatures. “What’s wrong? What are you hiding?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival hadn’t noticed that Credence’s hands are fisted in the coat, keeping it closed over himself despite the warm day, or that his face is thinner than it had been the last time he saw him. Credence’s pale cheeks are sunken and his eyes look almost bruised with the greyish bags under them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt all but shoves Percival out of the way to get a better look at Credence. His gaze lingers on the thick coat and the holes in it, as well as where it’s been patched up and the mismatched thread is visible against the wool.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re alright, you’re safe,” Newt says. “Let me see what’s wrong so I can help you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence doesn’t look any more pleased with the situation than Percival feels, his back pressed against the wall so he can lean as far away from Newt as possible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Newt coaxes him gently, separating his hands to get a better look. Under the coat is a shirt that may have been white, once a upon a time, but is now stained a light yellow. Percival is pretty sure he would be able to see Credence’s ribs if the shirt weren’t so loose on him… except for over his belly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The buttons strain over his skin, the fabric gaping open to reveal skin that’s hardly darker than his shirt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt pulls out his wand and waves it in Credence’s direction, giving him an apologetic look when Credence flinches away from it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Egritudo</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Newt murmurs, and a gold light surrounds the young man. It glows over his head and shoulders, but it’s brightest over his belly. Newt’s eyebrows snap together as the light over Credence’s belly gathers into something that resembles a human.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence’s eyes are on the little form, wide and terrified, but he doesn’t move, hardly even breathes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Credence,” Newt says. His quiet tone carries a weight that demands attention. “Are you pregnant?”</span>
