  <span>Bellatrix stared at the little stick in her hand, the two double blue lines staring back, mockingly. Someone in the school was pregnant and when she saw a flash of blond hair, she knew exactly who it was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey, Bella, what’s—MOTHER FUCK!” Lucius screamed, doubling over and clutching his stomach after the sucker punch Bella had just thrown at it. “What the FUCK?!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Look, I love you dearly and would never do anything to hurt you but I couldn’t stand by and let you throw your life away like that!” Bella said, watching as Lucius struggled to regain his breath. “You’re too young… too beautiful.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What the fuck are you talking about?” Lucius said, gasping for air. God, she knew how to throw a punch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m talking about the demon growing inside of you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It Lucius a minute to figure out what she could be referring to.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not fucking pregnant.” Lucius gasped and Bella beamed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, not after that punch you’re not! I’m the national kickbox champion.” She said, hands on her hips in pride. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I am fucking aware of your championships!” Lucius screeched before continuing much calmer. “Bella, I wasn’t pregnant to begin with. Guy’s can’t get pregnant.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh. Right, forgot about that.” She said, not looking the least bit sorry for her actions.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom Riddle, head cheerleader and homecoming king, appeared beside them, looking annoyed. Of course, that was no different than usual.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why the fuck is everyone yelling over here?” Tom asked, even though he really didn’t give a shit. Making sure his two idiots weren’t ruining the cheerleader’ss reputation was all he cared about.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, well I found this positive pregnancy test and—” Bella didn’t finish her sentence before Tom whirled around and punched Lucius hard in the stomach, making him fall to the ground.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Look, I don’t like you very much but I’m not going to stand by and have you ruin your life.” Tom tilted his head as Lucius curled into himself, sobbing in pain when Tom delivered a pointed kick to the gut. “And you would make a horrible mother. I mean, look at you. I’m not looking after your mistake for you while you keep whoring about.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Men can’t get pregnant, why are you both this stupid?” Lucius sobbed, tears of pain streaming down his face. Lucius was sure something was broken since Tom punched much harder than Bella did.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom paused. “Oh yeah, I forgot about that.”</span>
