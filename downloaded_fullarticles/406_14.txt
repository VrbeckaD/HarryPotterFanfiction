    <p>They were all sitting in a room, waiting for Dumbledore to tell them what this was all about. The Weasleys:  Molly and Arthur, Bill (and Fleur), Charlie, Fred and George, and Ginny. Hermione and Harry. Some Order Of The Phoenix members: Mad-Eye, Sirius, Remus, Tonks(who had broken it off with Remus after they realized that he loved Sirius), and Dumbledore. Ron was also there, glaring at everyone.</p><p>         </p><p>Sitting there also were some more unfamiliar faces to the Order: Severus Snape(who had publicly renounced the Dark Lord and burned off his tattoo), Neville, Luna, Dean and Seamus, Oliver Wood, Marcus Flint(Who had made it very clear from day one that he hated Voldemort) and Draco Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>   When Draco first walked into the room, which was in a very hidden Order hideout, the entire room pulled out their wands. They were all yelling, and Harry had noticed that Draco flinched when Mad-Eye called him a Dolorem giver. He hadn't known what it meant until Hermione, noticing his confusion, told him. <em> Sorrow giver </em>. It was Mad-Eye who threw the first spell, but before it could go anywhere near Draco it was deflected. Harry had turned, surprised, to see Dumbledore. </p><p>    </p><p>He had put his arm around Draco, who was clearly shaken and gently showed to a seat next to Ron. </p><p>  </p><p> Dumbledore had slowly turned around. "<em> What </em> were you doing?" He wasn't yelling. Instead, his voice was dark and angry, and his face thunderous.</p><p> </p><p>   "He's a traitor." Tonks had said venomously, glaring at Draco.</p><p>   </p><p>    Ron stood up, shaking with barely concealed anger. "He is <em>no</em> such thing. Draco has been risking the wrath of Voldemort and his parents for longer than you could ever know. He's saved all of our arses dozens of times with no recognition. So don't you even DARE try to call him a traitor." Sitting back down, Ron put his arm around Draco, who leaned into him and closed his eyes, apparently breathing in his scent. Ron kissed the top of his head and wrapped his arms around him. </p><p> </p><p>Everyone in the room just stood there, too shocked to do anything else. Ron, who despised Draco Malfoy, was not only defending him, <em> but tucking him into his side and kissing the top of his head. </em>Dumbledore had looked around at all of them. “ Well? Sit down.” His voice was calmer, but it was obvious he was still mad. </p><p>Now they were all sitting down in their seats, occasionally glancing at Draco. Finally, Sirius broke the tense silence. “Why do you call us, Albus? Doesn’t it seem dangerous to have so many of us gathered in one spot?” <em> Especially so many important Members? </em>Went unsaid but clearly heard throughout the group.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore nodded. “I agree, Sirius. So many of us here is not normally a wise move. But nothing we are doing now is normal. Besides, they all thought that you all should know, now.” His voice was grave.</p><p> </p><p>“They who?” Asked Hermione. Molly and Arthur nodded their agreement of the question.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore sighed, looking for all its worth his age. “That, Ms. Granger, is an excellent question with a long answer.” Sighing, he sat down. </p><p>“ I suppose I should start at the beginning. Long ago, when the Order of the Phoenix was just a group of wizards, witches, and muggles devoted to doing the right thing, the leaders decided that it wasn’t enough. All of these people were good at what they did, but sometimes they needed more. More natural talent, more teamwork, more. </p><p> </p><p>So they put together a team. They call this team Delta, modeling it after the Delta Force that the American Muggle government has. This team was… extraordinary. It was composed of half a dozen incredible young men and women. These people all had different skills, both from the wizarding and the muggle world. They could grift, lie, steal, fight better than any other muggle. They could perform magic that magic experts deemed impossible with envious ease. </p><p> </p><p>And to make it more unbelievable, they were all young. The youngest, she was beginning her fourth year as a Slytherin.” </p><p>Charlie coughed at that. “A Slytherin?” Fred-or George-said incredulously.</p><p>Dumbledore smiled slightly. “Yes, Mr. Weasley. A Slytherin. There was a Gryffindor,  Ravenclaw, Slytherin, and a Hufflepuff, as well as two muggle brothers. It was amazing, having so many of different Houses and backgrounds working together.” </p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned. “With all due respect, sir, what does this have to do with us all?” </p><p> </p><p>Bill nodded. “I don’t see how a group from the past affects us today.” He said.</p><p>“Yes, well, I do suppose I’m rambling, aren’t I?” Dumbledore said with a shake of his head. “ This group eventually retired, after many, many successful missions. But Delta didn’t end there. Instead, they trained the next batch of Delta members. And they trained the group after that. And so on. Delta has always been there, in the shadows, protecting both Muggles and the Wizarding World.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, they didn’t do anything substantial, did they?” Asked Hermione, confused. “We would know about it if they had. Newspapers, reports…” She trailed off as she saw Dumbledore shake his head. “You don’t know the difference between the world that was going to happen and the world that is now <em> because </em> of how good they all were. Why do you think France is still standing after the French Revolution? How do you think The U.S. won against England in the American Revolution? If not for Delta, we would have a <em> very </em>different history.”</p><p> </p><p>Everyone’s eyes at the table were wide in astonishment. </p><p>Charlie cleared his throat. “But… that still doesn’t explain why we are here now.” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, it does,” Hermionie said slowly as realization dawned upon her. She looked at Dumbledore. “Delta-its still active, isn’t it? We still have Delta.” Everyone held their breath as Dumbledore nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. And today, the eight members of Delta wish to reveal themselves to you, as they believe you deserve to know the truth.” </p><p> </p><p>“Who are they?” Remus asked, leaning forward. Everyone obviously wanted to know the answer as well, as they all shouted their own variations of the same question. Dumbledore let it go on for a moment before he gave an imperceptible nod.</p><p> </p><p>“Us.” Although the voice was not loud, everyone in the room stopped in shock and slowly turned to look at the owner of the voice. There, standing tall, were none other than Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy, still holding each other’s hands. </p><p> </p><p>All was silent for a second. “WHAT?!” Screeched Molly, looking in shock at her 6th child. “WHAT DO YOU MEAN, US?”</p><p> </p><p>“Molly, please sit down. Let Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy explain.” Dumbledore said quietly. Quietly, Arthur pulled Molly back down, rubbing her back. </p><p> </p><p>Ron bit his lower lip. “I never wanted to hurt any of you-I swear!” He looked at Harry pleadingly. “Just… before you hear anything else, just know that.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco smiled at Ron before leaning over and peaking him on the lips. Once again, everything was dead silent. </p><p> </p><p>“You just-”</p><p> </p><p>“What in  the bloody he-”</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t beli-”</p><p> </p><p>“You and Malfoy are dating?” Hermione’s voice rung out above the rest. </p><p> </p><p>Ron smiled sheepishly while Draco blushed slightly. “Um… surprise?” He said weakly. “Just… let me explain. Everything will make sense then, okay?” Slowly, everyone nodded, some *cough cough Harry* more hesitantly than others.</p><p> </p><p>Draco squeezed Ron’s hand before addressing the group assembled before them. “We met when we were six. It was at one of those pureblood conventions. Mr. Weasley, you had just gotten a raise and they had the best carnival for miles around. I-I had been given some money to spend on games and such. I had gone into the haunted house, and then,” He grinned softly at Ron “ I met Ron for the first time.”</p><p> </p><p>Fleur awwed at them. When Bill turned to look at her, she shrugged defensively. “Eet iz coote, zeeing your brother zo deeplee in love vith another.” She said with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>Ron looked at Draco with adoration in his eyes. </p><p><br/>
