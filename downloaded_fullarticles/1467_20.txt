    <p align="justify">The sun is fucking scorching and somehow it hasn’t rained in weeks. It’s summer— the sky is clear and blue and cloudless, and the four of them are sprawled out in the tall, uncut weeds and grass by the lake in just their wet swim trunks. </p><p align="justify">To Sirius’s right, James lies with his arms and legs spread out with no regard for anyone else’s personal space. Next to James, Peter, the lump, is sleeping on his stomach. His back is lobster-red despite the sun blocking potion he’d slathered all over his pudgy body earlier in the afternoon. To Sirius’s left, there’s Remus looking completely nonchalant behind a pair of dark sunglasses. He’s lying on his back with a towel rolled up neatly under his neck like a makeshift oblong pillow, one slender, tanned leg crossed over the other at the knee, kicking his foot to an unknown rhythm. He’s conjured up a paper fan and charmed it to wave back and forth over his face. The few hours at the Potters’ have already streaked his mousy-brown hair with gold and brought out an attractive spattering of freckles over his shoulders and nose. </p><p align="justify">Remus is utterly beautiful, and this is not the first time Sirius has noticed. He noticed in fifth year, when Remus told him, James, and Pete he fancied blokes and revealed he’d been discreetly seeing Damien Rosewater, the sixth year Ravenclaw beater. Since then, Sirius had been looking at him differently, like a new world with possibilities he’d never even thought about before had suddenly opened up to him.</p><p align="justify">He noticed with more enthusiasm later, at the beginning of sixth year, when Remus boarded the Hogwarts Express looking just as tan and freckled as he is now, and taller, with broader shoulders than he had before. He still hadn’t caught up with Sirius in height and he was still skinny as ever, but there was something else that was different— something that had transformed him from a sweet teenage boy into a sort of alluring entity who straddled the chasm between boy and man. Maybe it was confidence. Maybe it was just puberty. Sirius hadn’t known at the time, but he came to discover later that it was sex. </p><p align="justify">Remus had spent that previous summer carrying on with a much older boy— a nineteen year old Muggle called William. They’d kept the relationship a secret, and Remus swore they were in love, but things with William ended with a heartbroken Remus crying on Sirius’s shoulder. Sirius, filled with anger and jealousy, fought the temptation to kiss him stupid, and resorted to comforting his distressed friend instead.</p><p align="justify">“You’re staring, Sirius,” Remus says now without even looking at him, and there is just… <em> something </em> about the way he brushes his curly fringe off of his forehead. The curve of his wrist, the graceful movement, the way his fingers trail back down over his own sweat-slicked neck. Sirius wants to kiss him stupid now— wants to taste those fingers and take that wrist and pin it into the grass above his head and just kiss and kiss and kiss until neither of them can breathe, wants to lick the salt from his neck and make him moan, make him say his name again.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, well, how can I help myself when you’re lying there half-naked in a puddle of lake water?” Sirius rolls over onto his side and props himself up onto his elbow, smirking lecherously down at his friend. “You’re a literal wet dream.” </p><p align="justify">Remus only hums in response and continues kicking his foot.</p><p align="justify">Sirius has never had a filter and lately it seems he professes his feelings to Remus daily, but he is always brushed off. He knows he isn’t what Remus wants. The blokes Remus carries on with at school are of a completely different type. Sirius is good looking, yes, and cleverer than most, but he is no academic and he is well aware of his immaturity. He could never engage Remus in conversation about iambic pentameter or the Goblin Rebellion or even sit still for five fucking minutes. Remus’s blokes... they are prefects and form study groups. They come from nice families who love them. They are book smart and sophisticated and write poetry and listen to operettas and wear sensible shoes, while Sirius clunks about in his Doc Martens and listens to The Stooges and smokes cigarettes and wears his hair much too long and spends more time serving detention than not. He isn’t someone you bring home to meet mum and dad. Never mind that he has already met Remus’s mum and dad and they both adore him.</p><p align="justify">“Fine, ignore me. But how about just a quick toss off?” Sirius jokes, falling forward and pressing his face into Remus’s neck. He breathes him in— the scent of grass and tea and summer sweat— and kisses him softly on the corner of his jaw. His hand skitters across Remus’s naked abdomen, moving lower and lower and he swears Remus shivers under his touch, but then Remus smacks his hand and pushes him away. He sits up and gathers his things— the towel, a long abandoned, dog-eared novel, his wand— and flicks the paper fan over to Sirius.</p><p align="justify">“Take my fan,” he says, not even acknowledging what Sirius has done. “I’m going to have a kip before dinner.” He hops to his feet and wraps the towel loosely around his body. Sirius snatches the fan from the air and watches him sashay away, across the field and back toward the house.</p><p align="justify">It seems this is the view of Remus he sees most often lately. Sirius will make a move or give a flirty line, and Remus just turns and leaves. He’s becoming increasingly familiar with the way Remus’s shoulders tense up and his annoyed gait. He watches the muscles in his back and legs move, watches his slender hips sway, watches him disappear. He supposes if Remus is this uninterested he should simply leave him be, but Sirius’s thick-headed, unrelenting nature won’t allow him to stop until Remus finally tells him to stop.</p><p align="justify">“You need to stop,” James mumbles, sitting up and pulling a dandelion that’s gone to seed out of his wild mop of dark hair. He’d thought James was asleep this whole time, not that he really gives a shit whether or not James knows how he feels about Remus. He’s pretty sure he knows anyway— Sirius was never one for subtleties, but then again, James is so bloody oblivious it’s a trait that will probably be passed down to his unfortunate children.</p><p align="justify">“Stop what?” he asks, tossing the fan onto the grass and looking back to the house. Remus is in there, in the guest room he’s sharing with Peter, probably peeling his wet trunks off. The thought is erotic and exciting. Sirius could casually walk in and catch him naked and vulnerable. He could go in there and kiss him properly, push him onto the bed, do all the dirty things he’s been thinking about. </p><p align="justify">He wouldn’t, of course. Not without consent. And Remus won’t let him, anyway.</p><p align="justify">“Stop fucking with Moony. Pick on someone else, alright?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, like you?” Sirius smirks and grabs his wand, flinging a jelly-legs jinx at James just as he’s standing up. He flails and stumbles over Peter’s prone body, and Peter lets out what sounds like a prepubescent squeak. </p><p align="justify">“You twat!” James hollers, waving his wand over himself with a <em> finite incantatem </em>. All three boys are suddenly on their feet and running, throwing jinxes and dodging hexes and laughing like mad.  </p><p align="justify">Eventually, Pokey, one of the Potters’ house-elves, calls them in to eat. Mr and Mrs Potter themselves are vacationing in France for the week and had given James and Sirius permission to have their friends over— with the condition that there were to be no girls, drugs, alcohol, or explosives. The last two had been neglected before Remus and Peter even arrived that afternoon, and the first two are likely to go on ignored as well.</p><p align="justify">They hurry inside the house, a hurricane of wild, teenage energy. James’s hair is standing on end, and Peter has slug antennae and a scorch mark on his cheek. Sirius is the clear winner of that three-way duel. They trudge up the stairs to their respective rooms to change into dry clothes— Peter to the guest room, Sirius and James to their separate bedrooms. After they’re dressed and Peter has woken Remus up, they file downstairs and into the dining room where Pokey and Grimace, the other elf, are magicking the roast and veggies and gravy and peach cobbler onto the table. They all dig in, and Sirius tries very hard to catch Remus’s attention. He’s sitting right across from him, and Remus hasn’t looked up once. Sirius kicks at him, tangles their feet together, attempts to slide one bare foot over his thigh.</p><p align="justify">“Moony. Why blow me off when you could just be blowing me?” Sirius asks with an eyebrow waggle. James and Peter chuckle. Remus rolls his hazel eyes and excuses himself from the table, mutters that he’s too full for dessert, then slinks upstairs with slumped shoulders, like a boy who’s much too old for his body. </p><p align="justify">James shoots Sirius a look and Sirius shrugs. When they’ve finished their cobbler they go back upstairs to James’s room. Remus protests, but Peter eventually convinces him to join them, and Sirius decides to back off a bit. James is waxing poetic about Lily sodding Evans and the three of them groan, then laugh when Sirius smacks James in the head with a pillow and his glasses fly right off of his face.</p><p align="justify">“James,” Remus snorts, “you’ve got tan lines from your specs!”</p><p align="justify">James’s hands fly up as if to conceal the evidence, then he hurries to his mirror, his face frozen in horror as the others only continue laughing. Remus throws his head back and Sirius can’t help but stare at the arch of his neck, the pink flush on his cheeks, the crinkles at the corners of his eyes, his dimples. He laughs and laughs and Sirius’s heart swells.</p><p align="justify">And it’s so fucking typical of Sirius— the pureblood traitor, the white sheep of the Black family— to not only fall for his best friend but to fall for a half-blood male werewolf. Of course it happened this way. He almost wonders if he’s forcing it on purpose to piss off his family to the fullest extent because what could possibly be worse? But then he looks at Remus, sees that smirk on his face, hears that laugh, and he knows, <em> he knows </em>, it’s not all bullshit. Sirius may not have come from a pious family, but he knows Remus is his god, his religion, his future— he has to be when he worships him so, and he will never give up on making Remus try to understand this too.</p><p align="justify">Remus eventually blesses Sirius with a smile later that night after they’ve all showered and brushed their teeth. Remus pushes the curls out of his own eyes. His hair is much longer on top than it’s ever been, but Sirius likes it. He wants to run his fingers through it. Instead, Sirius reaches up, tugs on a loose tendril, and tells Remus goodnight. Remus blinks up at him with his honey-coloured eyes and his grin lights up the entire darkened hallway like a <em> lumos maxima.</em> </p><p align="justify">“Goodnight, Sirius,” he whispers, chewing on his thumbnail, and before Sirius can do anything stupid like kiss him right there, Remus slips into the guest room and shuts the door. </p><p align="justify">He knows when Remus is going to sweep the curls from his eyes or chew on his thumb like that before he even does it and Sirius thinks he may be a little obsessed. He’s thought about these small things, fixates on them behind closed bed curtains at school, in his bedroom at Grimmauld Place, and in his current room at the Potters’ as he touches himself. His mind wanders, and it places himself and his sweet Remus into precarious situations. He imagines what kissing Remus would be like, imagines it’d be soft and wet and taste like chocolate and mischief. He thinks about that soft, wet mouth on his cock, thinks about pinning Remus’s skinny thighs into his mattress and rutting against him until they’re both gasping and trembling and coming, and before Sirius realizes what’s happened, he’s in his room, his hand is sticky, his heartbeat erratic, and he feels fucking terrible for having these dirty thoughts about Remus, like he should ask permission before fantasising.</p><p align="justify"><em>One day</em>, he thinks, he prays, <em>Remus might want me.</em></p>
