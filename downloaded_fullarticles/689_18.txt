    <p>If Robards had a sense of humor, Harry would have thought the assignment a joke. Not that a series of what seems to be homophobic murders of wizarding couples were anything to joke about - no Harry wanted to catch the bastard just as much as the rest of the office. It was who he was partnered with that was unbelievable.<br/>
Draco Malfoy had been working as an Auror only a few months less than Harry; who had joined almost as soon as the war was over. Malfoy's joining was the bigger shock of the two. Harry had caught little more than a glimpse of him around the office over the past 4 years. Malfoy had managed to keep his head down at least. All Harry has heard about him was his desk was always overflowing with files and he never kept a partner for long - no one wanted to work with an acquitted death eater. Still, out of all the complaints about Malfoy he'd overheard none were about his success rate. Most were about his abrupt personality.<br/>
Harry sighed, leaning back in his chair and to rub his hands over his face. He needed a shave.<br/>
All the missive said was, "New assignment: Active homicide investigation, transferring from Reele. Report to my office for further briefing."<br/>
Reele was the oldest Auror working and Harry had heard she was retiring soon. He just didn't figure her the type to abandon a case before it was solved. But Head Auror Robards soon explained away that mystery; Reele was in coma. She'd been hit by an unknown curse the evening before while working the case. Malfoy had been the one to find her when she didn't report in that morning.<br/>
Robards was firm in his decision that Harry take the case - the office was understaffed, the case was too big a priority for one agent to work alone, and most importantly: Harry was the only Auror not working an active case.<br/>
Harry left Robbards office with an even bigger headache than before. He and Malfoy would just have to find a way to get along. How hard could it be? It had been 4 years afterall. But to go undercover immediately together?<br/>
Harry sighed, unsure how he felt about the prospect of working with Malfoy. He only knew this was going to be awkward. </p><p>Malfoy was fuming. He'd told Eldreda not to follow any lead without backup! Now the crazy old bat was comatose and inflected with an unknown curse. He pulled at his hair. He half wanted to rip it out in his frustration. They'd been working this case for a few months and while the motive seemed clear enough and they'd narrowed down an area they still had no idea who was committing the murders. What in Merlin's name did she find that led her to that alley and why hadn't she contacted him? He'd really thought they were starting to become a team, he- no. He didn't need a partner to find this sicko.<br/>
Which is why the missive on his desk was almost the last straw. Harry. Fucking. Potter. Of course they would give the golden boy HIS case. Robards expected them to work together? What a joke. If anything he'd probably told Potter to find any evidence of him being a dark wizard or something. Just great. Draco's forehead hit his cluttered desk with a thunk. This case just got a lot more complicated.<br/>
Robards informing him of the new parameters of the mission only added more complications but he was in no position to argue with a direct order. It would be the end of his career and he wasn't going to let anyone railroad him into being fired in disgrace. He wasn't going to let that happen. He'd solve this case no matter what. Even if it meant working with Potter. </p><p>Lying to his friends and the Weasleys that he was going on an assignment out of the county went about as well as he expected. Molly cried and made him give her the exact date so she could send him food and Hermione didn't buy his story one bit. How could he tell? Well, her flooing back with him to Grimmauld Place was a hint. Her placing her hands on her hips and staring him down with her best disappointed McGonagall impression was another,<br/>
"Harry James Potter-"<br/>
"Its classified, 'Mione." He sighed, walking over to the kitchen counter to start them a pot of tea, "All I can say is I won't be here anywhere between a few weeks and months. If it makes you feel better Robards assigned me a partner so I won't be going undercover alone."<br/>
He didn't mention who, because well he doubted that knowing Draco Malfoy was going to be the one watching his back would do anything to help with Hermione's nerves. Her narrowed glare eased into an analyzing stare and she raised an eyebrow at him, clearly wanting to know more. But his hands were tied. Undercover ops were kept confidential for a reason. Hermione knew that and he knew that.<br/>
It didn't make it any easier to keep information from one of his closest friends and a woman used to knowing everything. Harry had no doubt that if she decided to look into it she'd eventually uncover what case he was assigned to. And with whom. But she wouldn't. She respected the logic behind the secrecy rules too much and wouldn't do anything that would endanger him.<br/>
Still, it was going to be a tense afternoon tea.</p>
