    <p>Lucy Kegley was just a girl, trying to enjoy life in the early thirties. It didn't matter that she was orphaned or hungry, all she wanted to do was spread happiness around New York. The Great Depression had begun, and any happiness little Lucy could muster up was enough to brighten even one busy worker's day. The folk around town all thought she was odd. After all, a little girl sitting on the steps leading up to the Steen National Bank was bound to spark some interest from even the quietest citizens. She couldn't be begging for a job; there were none left, and a girl of her size would be no use to the workplaces that could appoint her.</p><p>Lucy was a small, frail girl who looked much too young for her age. Her tan skin and thin, brown hair made her appear younger than she was. Every day she sat on the fourth step and waited for anyone to ask what she was doing at such a time of day or if she was lost.</p><p>"No," she'd reply. "I'm not lost." Then she'd compliment the person, man or woman, and send them on their way.</p><p>That unusually cold Tuesday, Lucy was watching people pass by as she normally did. Nothing seemed out of order that day, other than the temperature. Lucy looked straight ahead, observing the broad-shouldered, tall child across the street run into a taller, skinnier girl with an oddly long neck. Little Lucy found that to be quite funny. Mr. Evans fancied that girl, and would purposely get in her way at the best of times.</p><p>Lucy realized Mr. Evans schoolboy fantasies shouldn't be distracting her, so she began watching the people in the street again. Nobody interesting seemed to pass. Besides, only a few men had jobs to go to, and even fewer would even acknowledge her existence. But then, something strange happened. In the corner of her eye, Lucy saw a man in a blue overcoat appear out of thin air. Rubbing her eyes in disbelief, Lucy watched as the man in the blue looked over his shoulder, concealing a leather briefcase behind him.</p><p>She couldn't help but be curious. The oddest thing that had happened in New York was the day nobody could remember, but that had been six years ago. Peering around, she realized nobody else seemed to have noticed the man. Why would such a peculiar thing happen in the streets of New York? Where had that man come from? Her curiosity took over and she began to walk down the steps, not bothering to survey the street as she sprinted across it. Once her feet hit the sidewalk again, Lucy looked around and caught a flash of the blue coat as it dashed around the corner, into another cramped alley. She tiptoed near it, keeping her back against the cool wall. She felt like a spy from one of the novels she'd read at the library.</p><p>The young girl briskly pranced down the narrow alleyway like a spring deer on a warm day. Fire escapes and crumbling brick buildings towered over her as she wove in and out around trash cans and manholes surrounded by the old newspapers and trash that painted the dark concrete. All that remained as she reached the end was the man's briefcase... and it was suspended in the air. It was a sight unlike any she had ever seen before. It was absurd. Why would a man suddenly disappear- with his briefcase floating in midair?</p><p>"Impossible," she breathed as her hand raised to her face. Lucy took three steps forward, her body disobeying her mind. The briefcase slipped open, revealing a rodent-like creature with a long snout similar to that of a platypus and a coat of black, fluffy fur. He -Lucy inferred the creature was a he- floated towards her, his paws outstretched towards the clip in her hair. Her hands wrapped around the soft creature before he could grab the metal pin off of her small head. The critter climbed on her arm, beginning to burrow through her hair. Lucy giggled and pulled the clip out, handing it to the fluffy being, allowing it to play with it as she sighed. She heard the clip clang around in the creature's hands, but couldn't see it as he had found a spot to sit on, and that spot was her head.</p><p>The creature made a loud squawk, and Lucy had barely caught him after he fell off her head before turning around and seeing the man in the blue storming towards it. Or her. Lucy's eyes widened as she began to run out of the alley, distracting the man who still had to gather his suitcase. Many people yelled and jumped out of her way, especially a woman in red lipstick and an expensive coat, who cried out words of disgust, thinking she was carrying some sort of feral rat. Lucy held the animal close, turning around to see the man in the blue catching up to them. He seemed more concerned than upset. Maybe he's just worried about the animal. Lucy thought. After that thought crossed her head, she had become distracted again. So distracted she let herself wander into a baker, who's bakery was just opening.</p><p>"Oh!" yelled the man. Lucy worried the man would be upset and almost began to apologize before he gave her a jolly smile. "You look hungry. Come on in, I'll make you one of my famous treats."</p><p>A decline was just forming on her lips as the man put a large hand on her back and lightly pushed her inside. Lucy reluctantly sat at an empty table, concealing the creature under her shirt. She looked through the transparent glass and saw the man in blue had finally caught up and was looking at the sign that read "Kowalski Quality Baked Goods." A flash of recognition was slapped across the man's face before he entered the bakery. The doors jingled as he opened them, and the baker looked behind himself at the man.</p><p>"Jaco- Mr. Kowalski, good morning. Are you open yet?" He asked, leaning onto the glass counter. He eyed his old friend's treats, especially the ones that resembled his fantastic beasts.</p><p>The animal tucked away made a slight noise. Lucy hoped the strange man didn't hear, but she didn't see him look slowly in the corner of his eye, marking the spot where his beast was. Under the shirt, he thought, how impressive and obvious.</p><p>Mr. Kowalski rang a bell and brought a plate of rolls to Lucy. She nearly gasped but stopped herself. The rolls were in the shape of the critter she'd concealed away only moments ago. How he could've known, she didn't know.</p><p>"I... don't have any money to pay for this, Mr. Kowalski," Lucy admitted, looking down and enjoying the scent of freshly baked rolls. Heat radiated from them, warming her cheeks that had grown pink from the cool morning air. The man who'd chased her frowned, and pulled out a few gold coins.</p><p>"It's on me," he said to the baker. "This is real good, cash it in at the bank. It'll more than cover the price of your extravagant rolls. Tell me, where do you get your ideas?"</p><p>Mr. Kowalski gave the man a startled look at the pile of cool, gold cylinders on the counter. "I... um, I get them in my dreams mostly. Just bizarre, magical creatures and beasts. They stick to my mind like spat out gum on the ground. So, I bake them," he said, taking the gold and placing it behind the counter, out of sight. Lucy then realized that the creature she'd had with her vanished. She looked alarmingly around the bakery, only to see it crawling over the counter. The man was watching it, an agitated look plastered on his face.</p><p>Once the creature had managed to get itself past the glass, the man reached across and grabbed it by its back paws. He sighed and walked over to sit in the seat adjacent to Lucy's. She swallowed as he sat, anxiety taking over her.</p><p>"Thought you could steal my niffler, huh? It'll take more than that, little one," he said, giving another one of the gold coins to the niffler. "Pesky fauna can never behave himself around shiny things. Always getting out and causing trouble. Now tell me... why were you carrying my creature?"</p><p>"I never meant to- your case, it... I'm..." Lucy stuttered as the man chuckled at her misfortune with words. "What's a niffler? Or- what is that thing? It's so unordinary."</p><p> A stern look displayed itself on the man's face. "Thing? Thing?! My niffler is not just a thing, it's an amazing creature that can do much more than your muggle brain can imagine." The niffler whined, and the man pet its head softly, shushing it. "Don't worry, mummy's here. I'm not going to let this muggle insult you like that."</p><p> "Muggle?" Lucy said as she raised her left eyebrow. The door jingled as it opened again, this time a blonde woman in a long pink coat entered. Mr. Kowalski smiled at her, and nearly tripped over himself in a rush to speak with her.</p><p> "Newt?" A small voice said; it was the woman who'd walked in. "What're you doing here?" Newt looked up at the woman, recognition is his eyes. "I thought you were in Britain, advertising your book. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, right?" The blonde shifted her gaze to Lucy. "Who's this? Oh... an orphan. I'm just like you sweetie. And you- Newt! We're not supposed to be fraternizing with no-majs! That's what Tina said."</p><p> Lucy was confused. How could this woman know she was an orphan? What is a no-maj? Who's Tina?</p><p> Newt gave the woman a funny look. "Then why are you here, Queenie? Did you just decide to get some strudels from Jacob's bakery?" He asked accusingly, leaning onto the table. Both seemed to have forgotten Lucy was there, which was fine with her. </p><p> "Mr. Kowalski is different," Queenie replied, biting her lip. "I get breakfast here every morning and bring it back to Tina and I's home. Would you care to join us?" </p><p> Newt looked down, blushing slightly. "I would like to, but I have this muggle to take care of," he replied quietly, not meeting Queenie's eye. "Give Tina my-"</p><p> "You want to come, Newt. The no-maj can be dealt with later. We shouldn't even be talking about our world in the first place. It could make Ja- Mr. Kowalski, remember." A look of pain flashed on Queenie's face. "Besides, I'll bet Teen will- oh. Nevermind," Queenie said, squirming a bit.</p><p> "What're you two arguing about?" Lucy piped up, her eyes wide in curiosity. "And who's Teen?" The two adults stared at her, Queenie glaring at Newt, who had a look of shame on his face. Both of them shifted awkwardly, waiting for the other to speak. "And what's a muggle?"</p><p> "Newt!" Queenie cried through clenched teeth. "You said a magic word around her? Goodness, wait 'til I tell Tina about this. She'll be real pleased to hear you're back and already makin' her job harder." She crossed her arms, but she caught Lucy's expectant gaze and cracked. "Newt and I are not arguin', dear. Tina's my big sis, we take care of each other. And a muggle- well, I call them no-majs, well, they... Newt, you have to obliviate this girl soon," the woman said, crouching down next to the girl, her voice barely a whisper. "A muggle is a person who can't perform magic.”</p><p> This information was a lot for little Lucy to process. Magic? She’d always believed in it, but had never seen it or even heard any non-joking talk about it until that day. Did witches and wizards really roam the streets? And if so, where? She understood why they were in hiding. The Second Salemers had put up quite a fight five years ago, although Lucy could hardly remember. She was only a child when that had all happened. Anytime she asked, people would begin to explain, and then trail off, scratching their heads or beards, and then dodge the question completely. It was as if they couldn’t remember. Perhaps it has to do with the magic people, Lucy thought. Queenie stood up, and gave Newt a hard look. </p><p> “We’re not repeatin’ last time. No gettin’ attached. You know how that turns out,” Queenie said, nodding toward Mr. Kowalski. “We’ll bring her to Tina, give her a show, and then tomorrow morning she goes with Tina and all of this is over. Okay?”</p><p> Newt nodded, his head ducked. “I understand,” he replied, and looked toward Lucy. “You’re coming with us. We’re going to show you some magic,” he said, smiling. </p><p> Lucy was apprehensive about going with them, but had a strong desire to see the magic. She hesitantly got out of her seat, and followed the two out the door.</p>
