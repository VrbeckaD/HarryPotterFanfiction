    <p>"Thanks Dewlort." Harry nodded at the young wizard who had his black cloak in his outstretched hand.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged it on and strode towards the lift, the eager wizard keeping step beside him.</p>
<p>"No problem Mr. Potter." He said, keeping his tone professional, but his expression betraying the glee he felt at working with one of the most famed wizards of all time.</p>
<p>"Jason, you know I've said that Harry's fine." He said almost exasperatedly, it being the fifteenth time this week he had had to remind his colleagues. "We work together. No need to be so formal." </p>
<p>"I know, it just feels strange." Dewlort smiled ruefully, which Harry returned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They reached the lift, and the golden grilles slid apart with a clang. The pair stepped into the box, accompanied only by a few memos rushing around their heads. Harry pushed the button for the ground floor, and with a shudder, the lift began its journey.</p>
<p>"Oh, did you hear, Amanda Werthers replacement is meant to be arriving today." Dewlort said conversationally.</p>
<p>"Really? That was quick." Harry mused. Amanda had only handed in her retirement form last week, and Healers for the ministry were notoriously hard to come by, most of them preferring St.Mungos to a dreary ministry life spent healing clumsy employees. And the often gruesome injuries of the Aurors.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm not sure who it is, but Josie in the Employee Services department told me that they've been trying to get a job for months." He jumped as the lift suddenly came to a jolting stop, and golden light from Atrium filtered in.</p>
<p>"I thought St.Mungos were always on the lookout for more Healers." Harry wondered aloud, gazing at the restored Atrium. It was a far cry from Voldemort's days, but still different from the ministry of old.</p>
<p>The grisly statues of the witch and wizard were gone, and in their place was a monument, not unlike the golden fountain that was there before.<br/>
It depicted golden statues of magical folk of all kinds stood in a ring, holding hands united. </p>
<p>The gently bubbling pool had 'As Strong As We Are United' engraved around the golden edge, inlaid with silver outlined with obsidian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I think I heard that they tried to hire them, but there were complaints? Which seems a little strange, as he wouldn't have been hired if he wasn't competent enough." Jason said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They continued through the crowded Atrium, using the fireplaces to get out from the ministry. They then apparated to the address Harry had on a crumpled piece of paper he had withdrawn from his pocket.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"So what exactly are we looking for?" Asked Dewlort, looking in distaste at the crumbling houses around him.</p>
<p>"Any traces of recent magic or human life." Harry replied automatically. It had become second nature to him now; sniffing out Death Eaters in hiding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They had arrived in a street at edge of Manchester, one of the many places Voldemort and his supporters had completely desolated. Bricks and possessions from the ruined houses were strewn across the cracked tarmac, and determined weeds were attempting to reclaim the abandoned street.<br/>
It looked as if it was once a nice place to live, the faded flowers drooping from trellises and fences, the overgrown lawns with rusting Volvos and BMWs stationed beside them told a story of a well off, content neighbourhood, laid to waste by Voldemort.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these places often became congregation points for the Dark Lord's sympathisers, who revelled in the scenes of mass destruction. They wouldn't be much of a problem if some had not taken up the habit of hexing any unsuspecting muggles or wizards who opposed their 'great cause'.</p>
<p>So it had fallen to the Aurors to hunt down these communities, which was what Harry and Jason were doing at that moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a well practiced fashion, they started casting charms to detect magic traces and peering in the shattered windows.<br/>
They came to a house with a peeling red door, and a mostly intact roof. Jason walked around the back, while Harry tentatively pushed the slightly rotting door open.<br/>
A creak sounded from upstairs, followed by shuffling.</p>
<p>"Homenum Revelio." Harry whispered, feeling the charm whoosh over his head. It alerted him to a number of people in the house, some of which were upstairs, and some were making their way to the back of the house.</p>
<p>Harry cursed, turning and running as quietly as he could towards Dewlort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was too late.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A cloaked figure brandished their wand, standing over the crumpled form of Jason Dewlort. A spell aimed from an upstairs window blasted Harry to the floor, where he got a mouthful of dirt and his cheek sliced open by a large sharp stone.</p>
<p>Aiming to buy some time, he grasped the stone, throwing it through the window the spell had originated from, and advanced towards the cloaked figure.<br/>
More curses came at him, and Harry deftly repelled them all, but there were too many to be able to return in kind.<br/>
He managed to aim a full body bind at the unknown dueller, who dropped to the ground, stiff as a board. Harry knew he didn't have much time before the other duellers from the house came, so he lept forwards to grasp the unconscious Dewlort's arm, trying to twist into thin air.</p>
<p>At the last second, a figure with bright auburn hair burst from the back door brandishing her wand, a scarlet jet of light seemed to almost seek Harry out, red hot pain erupting in his side, singeing his robes and splitting his skin.</p>
<p>Before he knew it, the dilapidated houses were gone, replaced by the cold stone flagstones of the emergency Ministry entrance. Harry heaved himself to his feet to drag Dewlort through the doors where the Healers department was stationed.<br/>
His side was in agony, spasms creeping through his body, and he knew it wouldn't be long before he collapsed.</p>
<p>"Help!" Harry shouted, desperation laced through his strangled voice.</p>
<p>Blood trailed behind the pair, originating from the gash in Harry's side, and somewhere from Jason's body. His leg was also twisted at an unnatural angle.<br/>
Harry just hoped that the Healers could help him. He hadn't been able to check for a pulse yet, too intent on reaching the medics.</p>
<p>"Help us!" He saw figures rush from their rooms, towards them, towards a Harry who was swaying on his feet.<br/>
Just in time, one of them managed to catch Harry before he slumped to the hard stone floor, and black overtook his vision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>/////</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A cold shock in his side roused Harry, and his eyes cracked open, to be met with the light space of the Healers quarters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He became aware of three things consecutively.</p>
<p>One, the room was full of people, most of them gazing anxiously down at him, only some of whom he recognised.</p>
<p>Two, gentle fingers were prodding his side, and he could feel his skin begin to knit together.</p>
<p>Three, he recognised the person who was carefully mending his torn side.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Malfoy!" He exclaimed, slightly embarrassed to hear his voice so weak. Was he hallucinating? Why would Draco Malfoy, of all people, be healing him?</p>
<p>The pale blond head turned to look at him, grey eyes meeting his.</p>
<p>"Potter. Stay still, or I shall have to start the healing process all over again." He responded curtly, concentrating on the wound once again, as though Harry was of no interest to him.</p>
<p>"But- Mal- What are you doing here?!" Harry spluttered, looking from Malfoy, to his wound, to all of the concerned people in the room, most of whom he now realised were Healers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the many white robed Healers stepped forward.<br/>
"He's Amanda's replacement." Barbara McClintock, the head Healer, said, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder, soothing him somewhat. "And it was incredibly lucky that he started today, otherwise that wound would've taken a lot longer to heal. None of us have encountered that particular curse before, but luckily Draco could identify and heal it immediately."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry gazed at Malfoy in shock, who was absorbed in his work once again, muttering enchantments while tracing patterns on Harry's skin with his wand. Now, the information that Jason had told him earlier, about the new Healer being kicked out of St.Mungos, made sense. The vast majority of the population did not particularly like Malfoy at the moment, whatever side of the war they were on. Malfoy was a traitor to the dark side, and an untrustworthy intruder to everyone else. It was no wonder people complained about Malfoy being a healer at St. Mungos.</p>
<p>However, Harry was not completely inclined to distrust Malfoy. Through Voldemort's eyes, Harry had seen the torture Malfoy had gone through, the small mercies and extra food he gave to their captives. In fact, Harry had testified at Malfoys trial, to let him be allowed to walk semi-free. </p>
<p>Well, freer than the rest of the convicted Death Eaters. Because of Malfoys age, disagreement with the Dark Lord's beliefs, and Harry's and a few others testimonies, he had been let off with a month in Azkaban, and been made to complete his seventh year at Hogwarts, where he was under close supervision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"And how is Dewlort?" Harry questioned, snapping out of the almost trance he had been in, suddenly remembering his injured coworker.</p>
<p>"Nothing too bad." Barbara answered. "A mild concussion and his leg is broken in a couple of places, but he'll be as good as new in an hour or two."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry sighed with relief. Ever since so many people had sacrificed themselves for him in the Battle of Hogwarts, he had done his best to protect everybody he could, which was a big part of the reason that he became an Auror.</p>
<p>At first, he wasn't sure if he could take it, years of more conflict, being in constant danger. But then he decided that he was in danger anyway, and he might as well learn how to properly protect himself and others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Done." Malfoy stood, pulling the white sheet further up Harry's bare chest, and pocketing his wand.</p>
<p>"Well done Draco!" Barbara beamed at the wizard, but Harry noticed she was the only one to do so. The rest of the Healers looked at Malfoy with mistrust, some of them trying to look at where the wound had been, as though they expected Malfoy to have made it worse, not to have healed it perfectly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thanks." Harry said, moving to sit up.</p>
<p>"No!" Two voices shouted, and a pair of hands shot out to push Harry down again.</p>
<p>"No, you dimwitted Horklump!" Malfoy said, moving away from Harry. "With a dark curse like this, you need to rest for a while after it's been healed, just to make sure there are no after effects. I would've thought that an idiot like yourself has gotten injured often enough to know that." He explained, seeming to enjoy being able to tell Harry what to do.</p>
<p>"But I have loads to stuff to do!" Harry grumbled. "I need to assemble a bigger team and get back to Manchester before they run off!"</p>
<p>"You are not going anywhere." Barbara said in an unusually firm voice. "Draco is right, and you certainly cannot go chasing dark wizards immediately after an injury like that."<br/>
Harry sighed, but stayed put. There was no arguing with Barbara over things like this. She would take the issue to the minister for magic if she had to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After assuring herself that Malfoy was going to make sure Harry got lots of rest, she collected her things, and headed out the door, the crowd of Healers following. Harry lay in silence for the next few minutes, listening to Malfoy move around the room.</p>
<p>It was light and airy as all Healer rooms were, with tall oak shelves and covering one wall, half filled with books about various medicines and methods of healing, and half filled with jars and boxes of potion ingredients.<br/>
A large desk stood in front of the shelves, a cardboard box filled with more books, and a cauldron, sat on it. Malfoy appeared to be unpacking this, sorting the books into neat piles. Harry supposed that this was what Malfoy was doing before he burst in, bleeding all over the place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Can I get up now?" Harry complained, bored.</p>
<p>"It's only been a few minutes Potter." Draco replied, a trace of mirth in his voice.</p>
<p>"Can I at least sit up?" Harry asked, exasperated. "I hate lying flat on my back like this." He grumbled, glaring at Malfoy's back.</p>
<p>Malfoy paused.<br/>
"I suppose you could sit on my sofa over there." He gestured to an incredibly comfy looking three seater sofa that Harry hadn't been able to see from his vantage point. "Just wait for me to help you over."</p>
<p>"At last." Harry muttered, completely disregarding the second sentence and sitting up with a groan. How weak did Malfoy think he was?</p>
<p>"Wait! Merlin, do you not listen to a single thing?" Malfoy rushed over, just in time to catch Harry for the second time that day, as Harry had been caught by an unexpected dizziness, and toppled over the side of the hospital-style bed.</p>
<p>"You should probably lie down again." Malfoy suggested, trying to push Harry down.</p>
<p>"No." Harry insisted, trying to walk over to the sofa again, but Malfoy stopped him.</p>
<p>"Okay, just let me help you. I'm not letting you ruin the first day of my job, just because you couldn't sit still and reopened your wound."</p>
<p>Grudgingly, Harry agreed, letting Malfoy help him over in an awkward waddling fashion, and dragging the sheet behind him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When he was settled, Harry realised that his cloak and wand were nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only item of his he could see, was the trousers he had been wearing under his robes, which, thankfully, he was still wearing. The same couldn't be said for his shirt.</p>
<p>"Hey Malfoy. Where's all my stuff?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>Malfoy reached behind the desk, bringing back a bundle of singed robes, and Harry's wand.</p>
<p>"Your robes are pretty much beyond repair. Even if you used repairo, they still wouldn't be the same." Malfoy said, dumping the pile unceremoniously on Harry's lap, and returning to his unpacking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry pouted. He particularly liked these robes, and wasn't sure if Madam Maldkins still stocked them.</p>
<p>After checking his wand was ok, and examining the burnt hole in the robes, he wriggled on the sofa until he was lying down, but his head was propped up by the cushiony sofa arm. Malfoy glared at him for moving so much, and Harry rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>He tried shutting his eyes to sleep, but he didn't feel tired in the slightest. Plus he wasn't looking to experience another terrifying nightmare after being so badly injured.<br/>
"Malfoy." No answer. "Malfoy." He tried again. "Hey Malfoy!" </p>
<p>"What, Potter?!" Malfoy whipped around, clearly annoyed.</p>
<p>"Why do you get such a comfy sofa?" This time it was Malfoy's turn to roll his eyes. "No, seriously" Harry continued "Its basically heaven. It's like lying in a cloud. It is most definitely the comfiest sofa my arse has ever had the pleasure of touching."</p>
<p>At this, Malfoy actually cracked a grin.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's because I deserve it. Because I actually get work done." He jibed, and Harry scoffed.</p>
<p>"You've been working here one day." </p>
<p>"In which you have succeeded in injuring yourself and letting some Death Eaters escape, and I have quite possibly saved your life." Malfoy smirked.</p>
<p>"Whatever." Harry paused. "How long do I have to stay here?"</p>
<p>"Until I deem you fit enough." </p>
<p>"I am definitely fit enough." Harry protested. "I mean, you've seen me shirtless."</p>
<p>"You know that's not what I mean." Malfoy said, still emptying his box.</p>
<p>"But you're not denying it." A cheeky grin had slid onto Harry's face. Malfoy just sighed, exasperated. </p>
<p>"Seriously though, how long will that take? Minutes? Hours?" </p>
<p>"I don't think I could stand hours of being trapped in here with you." Malfoy said, his face completely serious.</p>
<p>"Only because you're devastatingly attracted to me." </p>
<p>"The thought of finding you even acceptable makes me want to projectile vomit."</p>
<p>"Sure. But can you at least tell my boss where I am? She's Lise Meitner."</p>
<p>"I know who the head of the Auror department is Potter." Draco scoffed, but grabbed a memo anyway, quickly scrawling a note, then letting it zoom out of the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry watched Malfoy organise his things for a while longer, until he got bored.</p>
<p>He looked around for something to do, and started tapping his wand on the floor, causing gold sparks to erupt from the end. Once he had got the rhythm right, Harry started whistling along to the tune of one of Mrs Weasley's favourite Celestina Warbeck tunes, which also happened to be one of the most annoying songs he knew.</p>
<p>On his third loop of the song, Malfoy growled in frustration.</p>
<p>"Merlin, Potter can you shut up!" He burst out. Harry was not a particularly good whistler.</p>
<p>"But I'm bored!" Harry complained. "I don't know what you do in your free time, but my idea of fun is not watching you unpack a load of old books! Can you please just let me go?"</p>
<p>Malfoy looked like he was about to shout something rude, but instead shut his eyes and took a deep breath, reigning his anger in.<br/>
"I just want to make a good impression on my first day, so can you please, please, just do as I say? Do you have any idea how hard it was to get this job?" He said quietly.</p>
<p>"Okay. I'm sorry." Harry apologised sincerely. "I'm just antsy because I feel like I should be out tracking those Death Eaters, not stuck in here."</p>
<p>"They probably left the moment you disapparated." Malfoy said, and Harry was not sure if he meant it to comfort or emphasise the futility of his mission. They sat in silence for a while longer, Malfoy almost finished with his packing away.</p>
<p>"So. What is your idea of fun?" Malfoy asked out of the blue.</p>
<p>"What?" Asked Harry, nonplussed.</p>
<p>"Earlier you said that this wasn't your idea of fun. So what is?" He repeated, carefully avoiding Harry's eyes.</p>
<p>"Uh..." Harry trailed off. The truth was that he had spent so much time devoted to his work recently, that in the little time off he had, he was so exhausted, he just slept. Harry realised that he missed the feel of soaring through the sky on his broomstick. He missed laughing with his friends. He missed everything he used to do in his spare time.</p>
<p>"Quidditch? But I have a feeling you won't let me play right now." Harry said, and Draco nodded.</p>
<p>"Um, I like going out with my friends. Though I haven't seen much of them recently." He said in a small voice. "Everyone lives too far away. Ron and Hermione are visiting Hermione's parents in Australia, Luna's travelling, Neville is teaching at Hogwarts and Ginny is busy with quidditch in Wales." He added in answer to Malfoy's questioning look.</p>
<p>Malfoy nodded, not pursuing the subject any further.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Why a healer?" Harry asked, breaking the silence. Malfoy looked at him, as though he was deciding what to say, and Harry almost thought he wasn't going to say anything, when he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"Well I've always liked potions, and that's a big part of the job." He paused. "I think I wanted to help people. To try and make up for what me and my family did. Maybe to prove that I wasn't as bad as they all think I am." He finished, almost whispering. Malfoy looked shocked, like he couldn't believe he was telling Harry this.</p>
<p>Harry was just about to reply, not entirely sure what he would say, when Malfoy stood up.</p>
<p>"I'm going to find Madame McClintock." He blurted out suddenly. "See if she thinks you're ok to go." And Malfoy strode out from the room.</p>
<p>When Barbara returned, she decreed him healed enough to leave, but warned him from any strenuous activity in the next few days.</p>
<p>"And that most definitely includes hunting down dangerous wizards." She said, a knowing glint in her eye. "Draco, can you find him some robes or a shirt or something?" He nodded, and she left the room, smiling at them both.</p>
<p>Malfoy rummaged in a recently packed draw, withdrawing a black cloak that Harry immediately shrugged on. It was slightly tight around his muscles, but otherwise fit fine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thank you." Harry said from by the door.</p>
<p>"With your record, I'm sure I'll see you again soon." Malfoy smirked, and Harry rolled his eyes before walking out the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the next few days, Harry was confined to desk duty, forcing him to start on his mountain of paperwork, although he kept getting interrupted by worried people asking if he was ok after his injury, and if there was anything they could do for him.</p>
<p>It was nice that they cared, Harry thought, but they didn't actually care. Not like Ron and Hermione did. They only cared about The Boy Who Lived. Not Harry.</p>
<p>Delwort was the worst. He was constantly apologising, believing that it has his fault Harry was hurt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Potter!" A commanding voice barked, and Harry's head snapped up from the files he was organising.</p>
<p>Lise Meitner strode towards his desk brandishing large photos of dark witches and wizards, her strong figure exuding power. It was no wonder she was head of the Auror department, she had a knack for commanding people.</p>
<p>"I want you to work with Jemison and Delwort to catch these people. We believe they are the ones you lost last week." She slammed the photos on top of his paperwork. "And try to get Delwort's confidence up. He's been trying to resign, but I will not let talent like that go to waste." She added in a whisper. Although Lise was fearsome, she wanted the best for her employees.</p>
<p>"Of course Auror Meitner." Harry said, getting up to find Jemison and Delwort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hey, Mae." He sat on a spare chair by Mae Jemison's desk. "Meitner wants us and Delwort to track these guys down." </p>
<p>It made sense that Meitner would choose Mae to help, although her duelling skills weren't the best, no one else could use location and tracking spells like Mae. She was even talented with Muggle tracking techniques, once following a pair of wizards who were using advanced anti-tracking spells for three days, before catching them.<br/>
Mae nodded, and studied the photos. Harry could almost see her brain whirring, coming up with spells and methods to track them.<br/>
And she only called him Mr Potter twice, a new record for her.</p>
<p>Harry thought he could understand why they all seemed so in awe of him; they had heard about him ever since they were babies, and he had defeated the greatest dark wizard of all time, but he had thought that after nearly a year of working together, they would've realised he wasn't The Great Harry Potter, and was just Harry. But not much luck so far.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After telling Delwort about the case, in which Harry had to talk down his intentions of resigning about three times, the bell rang to signal the end of the day shift, allowing most of the workers to go home, including Harry.</p>
<p>He made his way to the apparition point, appearing just inside his front door, not thinking he could withstand the London traffic today.</p>
<p>Walking into his open plan living room/dining room/kitchen, and collapsed onto his sofa with a sigh.<br/>
His house was calmly decorated with muted tones, joined by the odd splash of bright yellow. The walls were a light grey, and all the furniture made out of a light beech wood, a large contrast to the decor of No. 12 Grimmaud Place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although he still owned his godfathers house, Harry did not like living there. It brought back too many memories of Sirius, and all the other people he had lost. Sometimes when friends came to London to visit, they stayed there, since Harry's flat only had one bedroom. But otherwise, he rarely visited, leaving the house to collect dust. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The soft pad of paws approached and a large, fluffy grey cat by the name of Nettie, jumped on his chest, purring all the while.</p>
<p>"Hey Nettie." Harry smiled, running his hands through her soft fur, and she began to play with his hair.</p>
<p>After leaving Hogwarts (for they had all chosen to attend eighth year to make up for not being there in the seventh), all his friends began to part ways, some travelling, some simply moving away. This left Harry with very few friends nearby, so, just before they left for Australia, Ron and Hermione bought him a kitten.</p>
<p>Harry thought it was a guilt present, guilt for leaving him. But he wasn't bitter about it. He understood that the two of them needed time alone together, and Hermione desperately wanted to visit her parents and undo her spells.<br/>
And then, once out there, they got offered an amazing opportunity to be foreign ambassadors for the ministry, quite a high up position. But it meant they were barely home.</p>
<p>He was glad he did have Nettie, because although he also had a tawny owl, Barry (inventively named by Ginny), he was rather standoffish, not affectionate in the slightest, unlike Hedwig had been.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a while of Harry nearly dozing off, the flutter of wings was heard, and a tugging started on Harry's hair.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright. I'll make dinner." Harry sighed, getting up and glaring at the owl perched on the sofa arm.</p>
<p>Barry would not eat ordinary owl pellets, seeming to deem them beneath him. And although he could quite easily catch some of Londons plentiful rodents (and proving it by leaving them in Harry's bed) he never ate them, choosing to instead steal Harry's food. Even though it was incredibly annoying having to cook for an impatient owl every night, Harry was secretly grateful, as without Barry, he would probably forget to cook, he was so tired most nights.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once they had all finished eating, Harry washed up, and got in bed, sinking into the mattress and almost immediately falling asleep.</p>
<p>A few hours later, he was awake, screaming at the ceiling, after a particularly harrowing dream about Voldemort forcing Harry to watch him brutally murder all his friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He knew there were potions to induce a dreamless sleep, and he'd tried most of them, without much effect. The best working one had given him a dreamless sleep, but with nasty side affects of killer headaches, and constantly feeling tired, however much sleep he'd had the night before.</p>
<p>Harry forced himself to sleep again, even though he was petrified of another nightmare occurring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next few days passed in much the same fashion; unsuccessfully trying to track death eaters, paperwork, then a lonely dinner with a haughty owl, followed by constant nightmares. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At least, until Mae found them.</p>
<p>"I've got them, I've got them!" She shouted, dancing round her desk.</p>
<p>"Well done Mae!" Harry grinned, as Delwort engulfed her in a hug. "Let's get going!" He said, and they all grabbed their things, heading towards the lift.</p>
<p>"I think this group is one of the higher ranking ones. The curse they used on you isn't something anyone would know." Mae briefed them, and Harry and Jason nodded seriously. "Also, it looks like they've been heading north on foot, probably because they know we are monitoring the apparition and floo networks. You two saw them in Manchester, we got a sighting of them in Leeds, now they're in Middlesbrough." Harry and Delwort exchanged worried glances. They could all guess where they were headed.<br/>
The only place of wizarding importance that far north was Hogwarts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The street that the trio apparated into was much like the deserted one in Manchester, although the houses seemed even more wrecked.</p>
<p>"Homenum revelio." Mae whispered, and the presence of a small group of people was revealed. They appeared to be grouped in the house most intact, a medium sized, red brick affair, with ivy climbing the walls, and a buddleia bush sprouting from a gaping hole in the side of the wall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry gestured for Mae and Jason to follow him towards the front door, and they crept inside, cringing with every creak of worn wood.</p>
<p>Warily, they peeked around corners and into empty rooms, finding nothing but overturned furniture and a nest of rats.</p>
<p>Once they had checked every room downstairs, they ventured up the stairs, which were dangerously rotting.<br/>
Harry could hear his heart thumping in his chest, and was sure the others hearts were just as frantic. No matter how many times you did this, it was no less terrifying, as there was never the guarantee it would turn out okay. Anything could go wrong.</p>
<p>Straining their ears, they heard muttered voices coming from the room directly across from the stairs. The three crept towards it, wands at the ready.<br/>
Jason nudged the door open slightly with his toe, and burst through, firing stunning spells in every direction.</p>
<p>Harry and Mae were close behind, aiming more stunning spells at the Death Eaters that Jason had not hit, however the remaining witches and wizards evidently had a lot of duelling experience, and ten against three wasn't exactly fair, Harry thought.</p>
<p>A large blond that looked remarkably similar to Dolohov was the first to fall, crumpling to the ground with a well placed full body bind by Jason.</p>
<p>One by one, the Death Eaters fell, until only a skinny redhead witch and a brunette with a rather spectacular handlebar moustache were left standing. They fired jinx after curse, one of which Harry recognised to be the fiery blade that had struck him last time. He was especially careful to dodge that particular curse. </p>
<p>All of a sudden, Mae was hit by a jinx that seemed to freeze her arms and knock her off her feet, making her stumble backwards towards the stairs.</p>
<p>"Mae!" Jason and Harry shouted in unison, as Mae let out a panicked scream, and fell through the rotting stairs.</p>
<p>The pair continued duelling with renewed fury, determined to get to Mae.<br/>
The moustached wizard was trussed up with ropes that wound, snake like, around his body, leaving him unable to cast a spell. The skinny witch threw a panicked look at her companion, knowing that there was very little chance she could avoid being jinxed herself.</p>
<p>Muttering a quick protego, she turned and leaped through the shattered window, presumably using a cushioning charm to break her fall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Shit." Harry swore, undoing the shield charm. He knew there was no use chasing her, she would be long gone by now. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He pointed his wand at the rope, causing it to bind every immobile Death Eater in the room together, ready for when they were transported to Azkaban later.</p>
<p>Confident it would hold, they hurried towards the hole in the stairs, peering down at Mae's figure at the bottom.</p>
<p>"I think I've broken something." She said weakly, looking at her twisted limbs. "Scratch that, I think I've broken a lot of things." And with that, she rested her head on the debris, and closed her eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry and Jason managed to reach her, and after confirming that she was only unconscious, carefully apparated back to the ministries Healers quarters.<br/>
Healers swarmed the trio, levitating Mae into one of the treatment rooms, leaving a couple to check Harry and Jason over. Unfortunately, one of these was Malfoy and before Harry could head off with the other healer, Jason had followed her into a room, leaving Harry with Malfoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I knew I'd be seeing you soon." He smirked.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm fine, I don't need checking over." Harry pleaded, not wanting to have to spend another hour in the Healers room.</p>
<p>"Fine my arse!" Malfoy exclaimed, pushing Harry towards his room. "Your face is covered with blood!" At this Harry gingerly reached up and prodded a rather sore patch on his temple, feeling a stabbing pain and bringing his hand away to see crimson blood coating his fingers.</p>
<p>"Ouch." He muttered, thinking back to how he got it. He remembered shards of glass flying from a window hit by a stray spell, but didn't recall being hit by any.<br/>
Malfoy tried to direct Harry towards the uncomfortable hospital bed, but Harry protested.</p>
<p>"Can't I sit on your sofa?"</p>
<p>"No, Potter. You'll probably get blood all over it, and it's unprofessional." Malfoy said firmly.</p>
<p>"I'll clean the sofa if I do. And I'm not sitting on that bed, so I guess you will have to treat me stood up, which seems even more unprofessional." He argued, already heading towards the sofa.</p>
<p>"Fine." Malfoy grumbled, grabbing some sterile cloth and a small bowl of water from his desk, then joining Harry on the sofa.</p>
<p>Gently, he used a wet piece of cloth to wipe clean Harry's wound. His grey eyes studied it carefully, deciding what spell or ointment to use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry fidgeted, tapping his foot against the polished grey stone floor.</p>
<p>"Stay still." Malfoy ordered, leaning closer, his eyes still fixed on the wound. "I think I can see some glass or something in here." He conjured a pair of tweezers and began removing the pieces. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was close enough for Harry to see the barely there scattering of freckles over his nose and every different shade of silvery-grey in his iris.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"There." He finished, finally seeming to realise how close he was to Harry. Quickly, he stood up, searching for something in the various cupboards. He returned with a tub of yellow paste, unscrewing the lid and smearing it over Harry's temple.<br/>
"I would use a spell, but this has antibacterial properties, and will prevent an infection from any lingering dirt." He explained, leaning back and screwing the lid back on the tub.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thanks Malfoy. I'd better go check on Mae. She looked pretty bad." He said, and Malfoy nodded, letting him leave his office. Harry walked into the room Mae had disappeared into and saw her sleeping on another uncomfortable hospital bed, limbs back to normal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"How is she?" Harry tentatively asked one of the Healers.</p>
<p>"She should be fine, with some rest. Luckily, it was nothing more serious than some broken bones." He answered, seemingly struggling to conceal a smile, though what was funny, Harry couldn't tell. "We're going to keep her asleep for a few hours, just to let her body fully recover." The healer added, realising that Harry probably wanted to talk to her.</p>
<p>"Okay. Thank you." He said, turning back to the door, and catching sight of his reflection in the window of the door.</p>
<p>"Merlin! What has Malfoy done to me?" He exclaimed, immediately seeing what was so funny.</p>
<p>The paste that Malfoy had smeared on seemed to have quadrupled in size, making it look as though Harry had some sort of strange yellow fungus growing out the side of his head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry reached for the door handle just as Malfoy appeared on the other side of the door, walking in.</p>
<p>"Do you have the robes I-" Malfoy was cut off by Harry furiously pointing at the large yellow growth protruding from his temple.</p>
<p>"How can I go back up to work like this, Malfoy?!" He demanded. "I'll be a laughing stock! Pictures will get into the Prophet!" Malfoy just stood, his mouth opening and closing like a fish.</p>
<p>"Erm, it shouldn't have grown that much." He said worriedly, dragging Harry back into his office before anybody else could see his mistake.</p>
<p>Harry stood sullenly while Malfoy poked around at the lump, inspecting it.</p>
<p>"When can I take it off?" </p>
<p>"It should just dissolve in half an hour. But since it's double the normal size, it will most likely take double the time." Malfoy answered, turning away and deliberately not looking at Harry, pretending to busy himself with something in his desk.</p>
<p>"An hour!" Harry nearly shouted. "Is it your personal mission to disrupt my work or something?"</p>
<p>"You could still go up..." Malfoy trailed off, noticing the glare Harry was directing at him. An awkward silence ensued, while Harry paced and Malfoy thought.</p>
<p>"I could go and get whatever work you need, and you could do it in here?" Malfoy tentatively suggested, and Harry looked up at him thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Yeah, that would work." He immediately calmed down.</p>
<p>"Okay, just tell me what you need." And Harry launched into a long description of where to find his open case files.</p>
<p>"Also, in the bottom left drawer of my desk is your robes. They're washed and everything." Harry added, to which Malfoy nodded, exiting the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stood up, taking the opportunity to examine the large shelves, taking in the vast amount of books, which were mainly about potions, but there were also a few volumes about harmful curses and their cures, and medicinal plants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His head snapped up as Malfoy burst through the door, carrying a large box of files, which Harry immediately took from him, checking everything was in there and thanking him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Meitner thought I was looking through classified records at first." Malfoy grumbled. "But when I told her that you were unable to leave the Healers quarters, so sent me to fetch your work, she believed me. 'Mr Potter is an incredibly dedicated young man.'" He mimicked. "Seriously Potter, do you ever take a break?" He asked incredulously, and Harry shrugged, flicking through a file. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They sat in silence, working until Harry's bright yellow growth had almost gone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I've got so much work done!" Harry exclaimed, looking at the large pile of completed paperwork. "It must be because I don't have people interrupting me every two seconds." He mused, to which Malfoy looked up.</p>
<p>"Well they all want a bit of the scrawny git, don't they." He drawled, turning back to his own paperwork.<br/>
Harry smiled. Although it was a bit weird, Harry decided he might actually kind of like Malfoy being a twat. It was incredibly refreshing after having months of people almost worshipping him, never wanting to upset him. Having someone who didn't tiptoe around him, who didn't find any problem with mercilessly insulting him, was actually pretty great.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They carried on working long after the lump had gone, finding a comfortable kind of silence, filled only by the scratching of quills and rustling of paper.</p>
<p>Suddenly a memo came whizzing in, gliding smoothly onto Malfoy's desk.</p>
<p>"I've got a patient now. Someone managed to impale themselves with a quill." He said, almost exasperated. "The amount of injuries I get like that. I don't know if you want to stay or not?" He looked at Harry questioningly.</p>
<p>"I'd better get back up there anyway." He said reluctantly gathering his stuff. "Thanks for letting me stay here for a bit."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He trudged up the stairs, pushing open the heavy wooden doors </p>
<p>"Harry!" Jason jumped up, rushing from his desk towards him "We got them all! When we came back, Meitner sent another team to get them all to Azkaban, so it's all okay!" He said excitedly.</p>
<p>"Not all of them." Harry said sadly. "Do you remember the skinny ginger witch?" He asked, and Jason nodded "She got away. And I'm pretty sure she was the one who hit me with that curse last time."</p>
<p>"Don't worry." He said after a long pause. "We'll get her. And you can do anything! You're Harry Potter!" Jason said, going back to sit at his desk.</p>
<p>"It doesn't quite work that way." Harry muttered, setting the large box on his desk.</p>
