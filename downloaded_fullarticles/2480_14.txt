    <p>The musty air was stale, and the rain could be heard hitting the ground outside the slits for windows around the the top edge of the wall to your left. As your professor listed the steps necessary in brewing a potion you knew well, you find yourself daring to glance out the tiny window, watching the water trickle down the window pane. You always loved the rain. </p>
<p>Your attention snaps back when you hear, “Wrong again, Mr. Longbottom. How disappointing.” Professor Snape droned. </p>
<p>A deep sigh and you’re immediately back to daydreaming. It wasn’t that you didn’t try to pay attention, you just found it impossible to resist getting lost in your own head. And it was something the potions classroom that lulled you into dreamy comfort - ironically the opposite effect it had on most students. But the dim lighting, Professor Snape’s slow, deep voice, and the fact that the other students never dared to speak in more than a whisper was the perfect storm. Luckily, you were naturally gifted in the craft, but that didn’t stop your fairly consistent tendency to get points taken away or to end up detention for not paying attention. </p>
<p>“Ms. Y/L/N,” Professor Snape began, startling you out of your thoughts, “Would you care to inform us what ingredient comes next?”</p>
<p>It would help if in that moment you could recall the ingredient he just said. Or what potion he was referring to at all. Shit. You decide to take a chance with the most basic contribution you can think of and reply, “Standard ingredient?”</p>
<p>Snape rolled his eyes, “Pity. If you were going to make a fool of yourself by guessing, I would have hoped it be something more interesting. 10 points from Hufflepuff, and I would advise you to pay attention or you’ll be making up the time you’re wasting this evening.” His voice was bored, unimpressed. Damn. </p>
<p>A few snickers from the Slytherin boys at the next table and you kick yourself. For someone so bright, Snape was right, you had a knack for making a fool of yourself. But that’s ok, you think, I’ll make it up. You straighten your back, ready to prove yourself, as your professor announces, “Turn to page 262 and follow the instructions to brew the Drought of Peace. If you any of you can manage to make it correctly, I’ll take some in effort to overcome my disappointment in the rest of you.” </p>
<p>The moment he finished his sentence, you were on it, carefully snaking around the hoard of other students, gathering the ingredients and setting up your station. You may daydream during lectures, but when it came to brewing, you were in the zone. While other students were caught up in memorizing ingredient lists, you’d studied the ingredients themselves, learning the properties and functions of each one. If you knew what a potion did, chances were you could guess your way into brewing it correctly. It was intuition, a feeling, an art form - something many others failed to understand. After a deep breath, you started pouring.</p>
<p>The Draught of Peace was a difficult potion to brew. All ingredients had to be added in a very specific order, and then stirred exactly the right number of times, with exactly the right level of heat - but precision was your gift. While others were grinding moonstone, you were pouring your finished product into a bottle. You took liberties in altering the ingredients. It was a dangerous move, but your success lay in your willingness take risks and modify the existing potions. You couldn’t help but smile at the masterpiece before you - a smile that was quickly wiped away as you noticed Snape begin walking your way. It didn’t matter if you knew the potion was perfect - didn’t matter if you were confident in what you created - Professor Snape never failed to make you nervous. Part of you craved his approval for reasons you could never explain.</p>
<p>After carefully scrutinizing your potion, his expression momentarily softens, and you catch him looking almost pleased. “Well done, Ms. Y/L/N,” he states just above a whisper. “You may go.”</p>
<p>Luckily he swiftly walked away to correct a gryffindor who was about to light their hair on fire, and didn’t see your face turn pink. Quite pleased with yourself, you swiftly gathered your things and left, not letting yourself dwell on how your professor’s compliments make you feel.</p>
