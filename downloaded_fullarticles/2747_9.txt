  <strong>**Spring**</strong>
</p><p>Godric was the last one to arrive; everyone had waited a fortnight for Godric's arrival.</p><p>Salazar had used Floo powder to arrive, he thought of it as a discreet way to travel and given the situation they were in, discreetness was the only way to go; Rowena arrived using a broom, it would allow her a quick escape if she had no access to a chimney and also she loved to fly; Helga got there by using a portkey, a pendant with the noble badger on itself, Godric got there by horseback, like a bloody muggle.</p><p>As a result, Godric had arrived there a fortnight later while everyone else had arrived within the same day.</p><p>It was not a large village, the muggles there barely noted their presence and the wizard and the witch had to remain both in an inn not too far from the village, despite Salazar's protests who wanted to camp in the woods instead.</p><p>So, while they were eating, Godric took them all by surprise, he kicked down the door of the tavern.</p><p> </p><p>"Alas, I have arrived" yelled the red-haired wizard as he took off his cloak and hung it on the coat rack of the tavern, the bard stopped playing the lyre and the lute in the background, Godric was a big man, he used to say he had blood of giants in him, whether or not that was true nobody knew, not even Godric himself. But surely he knew why he said that and why people would believe him, and it certainly made an impression whenever he walked into a room.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you stop to smell the flowers?" asked Salazar with a deadpan tone in his mouth, as well as some roasted boar that the Innkeeper made for him.</p><p>"Perhaps I did, Salazar, My dear friend, perhaps I courted a lady of noble blood, perhaps I fought with pirates, or perhaps I simply enjoyed the view on the back of my horse...you ought to try it one day, my friend, you might yet discover such new joys in this world"</p><p> </p><p>"You could have taken a shortcut indeed, Godric, arriving is paramount and we mustn't waste time" added Rowena, who was sitting across Salazar.</p><p>"I assure you, my dear..." said Godric, as he got closer to the table and sat beside Salazar, his dearest friend "that I took no risks...see? I'm here, and I haven't gone anywhere. I said I would arrive and arriven I have, now, what is there to eat?"</p><p>"Rabbit mostly" added Helga, who sat right next to Ravenclaw, a woman of sturdy frame in a yellow dress, of the three she was the one who was at her fanciest, unusual for her, but the rest weren't in riding clothes either, except for Griffindor "Other than that there is some boar, the beast almost killed the inkeeper this morning, so this is truly a special ocation, and Chicken, we also have a flagon of ale that the alewife was so kind to make for us."</p><p>The Innkeeper got then closer to the table </p><p>"I Have some wine made by your countrymen that I got my hands on recently, sire, If you would like, I could have some poured for you" Salazar did not enjoy ale, so Godric knew he meant him. </p><p>"I would like that very much." he said without looking at the innkeeper at the face.</p><p>"Right away sire", the Innkeeper left, it was evident that they had some coin to spare and thus, the Innkeeper tried to make them spare as much coin as possible.</p><p>"You told the innkeeper that you are a Spaniard?"</p><p>"It's not exactly a lie, Godric"</p><p>"It's not exactly true either"</p><p> </p><p>Salazar Slytherin directed a sharp look at Godric Gryffindor "Just eat the boar and drink the ale, Godric".</p><p>Godric did exactly that as soon as the boar arrived. he stuffed his mouth and then cleared it with a second flagon of ale brought only for him.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as they finished eating and drinking the four wizards paid the innkeeper their debt, for the meals and the rooms and directed themselves to the hill in which the castle would be built. Godric then arrived earlier than everyone, since he took his chestnut horse, that he had left in the Inn stables and galloped all the way to the top, Rowena and Helga walked, and so did Salazar.</p><p> </p><p>Salazar Slytherin hated horses since he had been thrown out of one as a young lad, but he could not walk for too long either, due to his injury, produced by the war, So he walked a little before giving in, and taking a mule to the top.</p><p>Rowena had come with beautiful plans showing in detail the look of the castle and it's intricate design, they had not started yet, the elves were yet to come.</p><p>"There is still room for more things to be added" She said "All of us have put a little input, personal rooms, if you will, to the design, yours is yet to be added and the magic of it will be known only by you...and me, since I'm making this plans"</p><p>"A secret room?" asked Godric in confusion</p><p>"If you will, yes, Helga, Salazar and I have already added ours to the design, secret of course, and inaccessible to students if possible. It is paramount that you give us yours before we start construction, we cannot, after all, make the elves change the entire castle for a room, that is, of course, if you wish to have one".</p><p> "I very much do so," Said Godric.</p><p>"Then it's decided" Rowena added, she twitched her wand and Godric could see in the maps the room he wanted, the griffin guarding it and the stairs that would lead to it.</p><p>"We will be here in this village until the building is completed, the elves will arrive in a fortnight to begin construction"</p><p> </p>
