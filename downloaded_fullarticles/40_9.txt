    <p>Around us, the camp slept. Fires were out, except for the ring of small fire pits that marked the boundary of the concealment spell. Their flickering light danced on the wall of our tent, giving me just enough light to make out the sleeping forms of Hermione and Ron in their beds across the way. This wasn't a grand tent like we had at the World Cup, this was more like what I imagined camping was like when he was a child... Except for the running water, and indoor torches, and the bathroom... OK, maybe not. But for wizards, this was apparently living rough.</p><p>I turned over, pulling my fur blanket up over my ears. It wasn't really cold in the tent, not like it was outside, but I still shivered. I aways shivered, somewhere in my belly, like my insides were cold even when my skin was pleasantly warm.</p><p>Ron had given me his extra blanket.</p><p>I could hear them breathing, almost in sync, his rasp just falling after her faint whistle. She always slept with her mouth firmly closed.</p><p>Sleep dragged at me, too, and I fought to keep my eyes open. I didn't want to sleep. It had been a week since the last time I had the dream, and 3 days since I had slept, and I couldn't give in to it, I couldn't just let it <em> happen </em> and not fight. I was supposed to fight, we all were fighting...</p><p>But my eyes were so heavy, and the light flickering on the wall faded as sleep pulled me under.</p><p>Rough fingers against my face. The smell of ink and potions and that scented oil. I turned my head, captured those fingers in my mouth, sucked at the dirt and sweat on them. I couldn't tell if my eyes were shut or if it was just dark. His fingers stroked over my tongue.</p><p>"You fight sleep, and yet you're so eager once you get here. What, exactly, are you fighting, Modha? Certainly not <em> this </em>." His hand slid around the back of my neck, and he pushed his fingers deep, stretching my mouth wide around the knobs of his knuckles. I gagged, briefly, before managing to get my throat to relax. He hummed a pleased noise, and the shivering in my belly stilled.</p><p>"Still such a slut, even after all these weeks. Do they know, I wonder, that you come here, begging to be used? That you kneel and offer your body as if you never left? Do you tell them that you wake with the taste of me in your mouth, boy?" His fingers pulled back and slid in again. Tears pricked my eyes.</p><p>"Of course they don't. They'd look at you in horror if they knew. Their savior, begging for it, <em> gagging </em>for it, like some trash in a penny dreadful." His breath ghosted wet over my cheek. He smelled of smoke. I tried to take more of his fingers down my throat.</p><p>"Such a good little whore, Modha. My good, good little whore. It's OK, I'll give you what you want. You don't have to beg for it. I know what you want. I <em> know."  </em>His fingers hooked briefly, making me gag, then dragged themselves out of my mouth, slick from my throat. He wiped them on my cheek, and then stepped backward, away from me. I whimpered, hot and hard and my face wet from tears.</p><p>"Maybe next time I'll give you what you need. Sleep well, Modha."</p><p>I thrashed out of the blankets, a sob in my throat, my hands clenched into knots.  Their eyes across the tent were large and wet.</p><p>"Everything alright?" Hermione said, her voice quiet.</p><p>"Fine," I mumbled around the scar tissue in my mouth, and wrapped myself in my blanket, trying to keep the shivering out of my voice. "I'm fine."</p><p>Outside, the camp slept on.</p>
