  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco turned just in time to see the haunting green light race across the space between Potter and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.</p>
<p>He felt hope.</p>
<p>He felt desperation.</p>
<p>He felt.... excruciating, blinding pain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A wail went up, full of frenzied screams and groans and grunts of pain.</p>
<p>Draco's arm was on fire. It hurt to breathe, each torturous breath was an orchestra of pain within him.</p>
<p>He was looking up at his mother's face, not understanding the angles. Everything was wrong, everything was off somehow. It was like gravity had readjusted itself without his permission.</p>
<p>This must be the cost of having taken the mark, he thought to himself. This was the cost of saving my mother.</p>
<p>Draco closed his eyes and gave up his life, thankful he'd been able to save hers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>--------------------------------------</p>
<p>He'd done it. Voldemort had fallen, and Harry'd been the one to do it.</p>
<p>He should have felt triumph. He should've felt relief. He should've felt- so many things.</p>
<p>All he felt was loss, pain, anguish.</p>
<p>And then something sparked inside of him, and his chest was on fire.</p>
<p>There was no sensation of falling. No recognition of success. Nothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry laid, still and unmoving where he'd collapsed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
