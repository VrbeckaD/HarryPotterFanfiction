    <p>Newt's POV </p><p>Newt always knew he was different from other children. Even from wizarding children. His magic lashed out against anyone who came close to him. </p><p>He felt drawn to the creatures of the world. Humans held little interest for him. If anything they made him wary and suspicious. Not even his older brother or his parents were exempt. </p><p>By the time he was seven he spent more time out by the bowtruckle tree than in his house. When his parents came looking for him his magic would hide him. </p><p>It was on his way back to the manor that he felt a pull on his magic. Subtle but strong pull that made him curious enough to follow it. </p><p>Later he would learn that he stepped through one of the pathways. That if he focused on the untamed magic inside him while stepping through it would lead him to those like him. Celestial Spirits made from the hearts of men. Living in their own world to allow their magic and life force to renew. Some came and went between the human worlds but they were few and far between. </p><p>It seemed as if Newt had simply blinked. A completely different forest surrounded him. His magic no longer pulling trying to lead him elsewhere. Neither did he feel he could find his own way back. </p><p>Surprisingly he didn't feel any worry about not making it back. Even at the tender age of seven he knew he would not be missed. Nor did he feel he was in any danger here. His magic would protect him as it always had. </p><p>After a few minutes of wandering he heard a rustling to the left of him. Newt turned curious of what creature he might find. Instead of a creature it was a pink haired boy. </p><p>Onyx eyes met green and for a moment they just stared at each other. </p><p>Newt thought the boy was about his age. The way he dressed was strange. His shirt barely covered his any of his torso and there weren't any sleeves. He was also wearing shorts that came down to his knees. A scale like scarf was wrapped around his neck. </p><p>Newt had to wonder if the other was cold. While it wasn't winter out to be wearing so little clothes had to be chilling. Right?</p><p>The boy's name turned out to be Natsu. He was a wizard from the guild known as Fairy Tail. Having never heard of such a thing he thought the other was lying. </p><p>He was proven wrong by the other when he was dragged through the forest and out onto a road. Everything about the world felt different. This was not his own. Even at his young of an age he could tell. </p><p>Natsu dragged him to a giant building in the middle of town. The same symbol on his shoulder lay on a banner. </p><p>There he met Makarov. The old man had gentle grey eyes. When Newt explained his situation in private Makarov promised to look into it. Until then he was welcome to stay with the guild. </p><p>There were several orphaned children that called Fairy Tail home. Natsu, Gray an ice wizard, Erza who specialized in weapons and Cana. One more was welcomed greatly into their ranks. </p><p>Makarov even let him join the guild. His guild mark was on his upper right bicep. It would be easy to hide or to show if he chose to. It was two days later that they recieved an answer. </p><p>An old woman came to visit the guild with an orange haired man. The man's hazel eyes widened at the sight of him. They widened even further at the sight of his guild mark. </p><p>He introduced himself as Loke of Blue Pegasus another wizarding guild in front of the wizards. When they were alone he was told the truth.</p><p>Loke was in fact Leo the Lion. He was the Leader of the Zodiacs. Then he explained that this was not Earth. Not the one that he knew. </p><p>Leo explained that he was coming into his abilities as the 13th Zodiac. Officially he didn't exist to the wizards. Officially there were only 12 of the Zodiacs. </p><p>Unofficially there was a 13th gate. As Leo the Lion was the light. Lupus the Wolf was the darkness. They were polar opposites of each other. </p><p>Despite being the darkness Leo did not treat him any different. He taught Newt how to sense the magics around him. How to pass between the gates so that he could travel to the Celestial World. Finally how to return home. </p><p>Almost a month passed between when he left his world and when he returned to it. His magic was stronger than before his life force renewed. Due to his and lack of training his life force drained slowly. </p><p>As he grew older he would have to visit the Celestial World more often to regain his life force. Though it wouldn't be the only reason. </p><p>When he returned home his parents bombarded him with questions. Where had he been? Didn't he realize how worried they had been?</p><p>Newt honestly didn't consider the possibility that he would be missed. His parents always liked Theseus better than him. They only got worried when he didn't come back. </p><p>When they tried to ground him he just ignored it. Even the manor wards couldn't keep him from coming and going. Though he was careful not to spend so long away a second time. </p><p>The only other issue they had was with his guild mark. They couldn't believe that he had gotten a tattoo. Trying to remove it with magic had proved to be futile. The magic of the guild and his heart was far stronger. </p><p>Leo introduced him to the other spirits. He and Aries were quick to become friends. Currently she and Leo were contracted to the same wizard. </p><p>According to Aries away from the sharp ears of Leo she told him of the wizard's unkindness. It was strange to get used to hearing that a person of magic was called a wizard no matter their gender. Newt being the person he was couldn't stand to see his new friend hurt. </p><p>Newt trained hard with Leo learning about his magics. Like all Celestial spirits he had two kinds. </p><p>His beast magic that connected him to creatures and his own inner gate. It was the most difficult to control. </p><p>The second was illusion magic. Mainly used as a defense mechanism he could also magic his magic tangible to be an attack. </p><p>When he wasn't training with Leo he was learning to fight. Gray and Natsu had taken it upon themselves to teach him. It turned out both boys were a year older than him. They decided to unofficially adopt him as their brother. </p><p>For four years this went about in the same pattern. He would spend most of his time in Earthland only leaving when it would become obvious that he was missing. </p><p>By the time he was eleven he was allowed to take nearby jobs on his own. Unlike Natsu and Gray he did have a family. While they didn't really care about him like the guild did Makarov made sure that he was never far. </p><p>It was in the rare morning in early June that he recieved his Hogwarts letter. Excitement and dread filled him. He wasn't sure if he could juggle his trainings, taking jobs, and school. </p><p>It was comforting when Makarov assured him that even if he was gone for long periods of time he would always be a member of the guild. They were family. It was then that he realized what that word truly meant. </p><p>He agreed to go to Hogwarts but still wore his wizarding guild emblem with pride. Whether it was Earth or Earthland there was no way he could be ashamed of his guild. </p><p>People who had known him when he was younger didn't recognize him. Unlike most children his age he was chubby or having lots of baby fat. He was tall and lean with muscle.</p><p>Theseus was excitedly talking about classes next to him. The older Scammander was a Gryffindor, brave and true. Newt only listened with half an ear. </p><p>His main focus was on getting the books he needed. Plus the few extras the world might have on illusion and wandless magic.</p><p>In both cases they were few and far between. An interesting however had been on Celestial Spirits. It was tucked away in the myths and legends sections. </p><p>Like always his parents had begrudged him his few extra books. They weren't poor but it always seemed to put them out if he wanted more. Theseus always got what he wanted no matter how extra it was. It made him feel jealous at times but he always remembered that it was he who was welcomed in Earthland. Not his brother. </p><p>His wand surprised everyone. It was ash and shadow wolf fur. A rare combination seen only once every couple hundred years. Olivander had a knowing looking in his eyes. He warned him to keep it safe and to hide his abilities. </p><p>Once he had everything they returned to the manor. Newt holed himself up in his room to read the book on Celestial Spirits. To his disappointment there was nothing new. Though it did seem that at one time Celestial Spirits did stay on this world. </p><p>Likely due to the humans lack of knowledge they left. He wasn't surprised by it. The wizards didn't have the same acceptance that they did in Earthland. </p><p>Two months later he was on the train to Hogwarts. He met Leta Lestrange on the train and they quickly became friends. She showed interest in creatures in a way that no one had before. </p><p>Despite their quick friendship he kept his secret of Celestial Spirits close to the chest. Olivander's warning rang in the back of his mind. </p><p>He was neither offended nor surprised when he was sorted that night into Hufflepuff. Theseus who was a seventh year Gryffindor clapped for him but he was the only one. </p><p>Newt found that the Forbidden Forest held the appropriate ley lines to lead him back to Earthland. Whenever he wasn't in class or looking after the creatures of Hogwarts he was with his guild. </p><p>Fairy Tail members listened to his stories of the school with interest. To them the whole other world was exciting. </p><p>Their trainings continued as usual but he saw less and less of Leo as time passed. When he did see the Lion his friend was exhausted. It seemed Karen his wizard was pushing all of her Celestial Spirits to the point of exhaustion. </p><p>That made him weary of Celestial wizards as a whole. There had to be good ones to outweigh the bad but he didn't want his key falling into the wrong hands. For the moment he wore in on a chain around his neck. It was disillusioned using his magic. Only the strongest of his wizards would be able to detect it. While wizards on Earthland could they tended to be less nosy. </p><p>Right before the Christmas holidays he was pulled aside by Professor Dumbledore. The man had begun to notice his abrupt disappearances. How no one could find him when he decided to disappear. </p><p>Newt tried to placate the man by saying he was just good at hiding but he knew it didn't work. Dumbledore seemed to watch him even more from that day on. It became increasingly difficult for him to get away. </p><p>Before he knew it however five years passed. Despite his watcher Newt found time to visit Earthland. His magic grew faster than the other children's and thanks to his training he was able to control it. </p><p>Every professor knew him by name and reputation. They tended to look the other way when he would bring creatures in. Most of them were small and injured. He would nurse them back to health and release them. </p><p>He had done well on his OWL's and was working to do the same on his NEWT'S. It would be out of love for his friend that he wouldn't see his schooling through to his seventh year. </p><p>Leta unleashed a runespore onto another student. Newt knew of the fear she held for her father. How he would likely kill her if she was expelled. So he took the blame for the attack. </p><p>Things had begun to get more heated between Aries and Karen. More than once he was called to help her heal because the wizard had beaten her within an inch of her life. </p><p>He and Leo made a pact after the last time. If it happened again they would step in. No matter the cost. </p><p>In the end he was expelled from Hogwarts but was allowed to keep his wand. Newt didn't return to his parents after that. Instead he chose to travel. A final parting gift from Dumbledore was a suitcase that had an undetectable expansion charm on it.</p>
