    <p>The ground was scorched, flames trailed lazily along the wreckage left behind of what was once Diagon Alley. A group of blood-stained boots tread carefully through the field of corpses, battle-worn and weary yet ever vigilant for a stray surviving Death Eater. There was a stir not twenty feet away, some rubble shifted to the side as a masked figure attempted to emerge.</p><p>Eleven pairs of eyes flicked towards their leader. "Avada Kedavra," the words rolled easily from Harry's lips. The group resumed its careful march.</p><p>Two hours later official confirmation was given out, it was over, finally. Ten years to put to rest the rallying forces after Voldemort's downfall. The Wizarding World never would have guessed that the Death Eaters would so skillfully regroup after their Dark Lord's defeat, and yet, it had happened swiftly and efficiently. Followers numerous as never before imagined all heeded the call to arms, now able and willing to emerge from the shadows to leadership sound of mind and a masterful plan in place.</p><p>Two days later saw the rebuilding of an era, a school, a town, an alley. The ministry had managed to prop itself up with Potter's inner circle actively taking over the main branches and recruiting any competent wizards who were willing to show up to work.</p><p>Two weeks later and civilian wizards started emerging from their hidden homes. Those who were too untrained to fight <em> and </em> too intelligent to be caught as hostages knew well enough to disappear when the Order rolled through chasing war and bringing death to Harry's enemies.</p><p>Two months later and a functioning, if skeletal, society had emerged. It was the start of summer and school terms would begin in the fall. The blood was washed from the ground and the spots in dark corners, many which still bore a hint of gore, was hardly noticeable.</p><p>Two years later and all was as it should be. A world at peace. Wizards walked freely, be it in groups or alone, content in their business and at ease in their homes. The next generation of young magical hopefuls was being educated under the watchful eye of a ministry free of corruption. And Harry Potter? Harry Potter was gone.</p><p>Harry Potter had disappeared and none were the wiser. The papers had him down as a dangerous, war-tried, powerful wizard who had saved the world with fast dueling and efficient leadership. Where he was now was surely nothing of note for the average, peaceful citizen.</p><p>If any were curious enough to seek him out, they would find Harry hidden in plain sight under illusion charms so as to avoid the massive crush of reporters that had dogged his every step immediately following the war's victory. In fact, it was on such an outing that Harry found himself on now, sliding through the crowds of Diagon Alley with the practiced ease that one could only gain from navigating a battlefield of flying curses and fallen bodies. It was all a rather tedious affair. Harry knew better by now than to let his guard down, should someone manage to startle him his first reflex would be to whip around and raise his wand, possibly resulting in death or serious bodily harm. Wearing battle-robes was uncommon enough, having such a reflex was simply <em> not done </em> anymore, two weeks, hell, two months even after the war such a habit was more than expected from any of the jumpy veterans that walked the streets. Nowadays though? Harry found himself wondering exactly what happened to force the wizards around him into such a lull of complacency. Dark wizards still walked the world as did many dangerous and dark creatures regularly encountered in the wilds, it was one of the reasons Harry was so drawn to traveling, to avoid the tedious patter of boredom and complacency that had once again entrapped wizarding Britain.</p><p>Harry did have a job though. He was an auror. His actual assignment was a solo watch on the magical world at large keeping an eye out for anomalies or events that could have a serious impact on the future safety and existence of the wizarding community, Britain in particular.</p><p>For the moment, Harry found himself in the middle of a forest in magical Britain where he was investigating the output of a major power source of raw magic pooling out into the surrounding area.</p><p>In hindsight, continuing to approach the downtrodden shack in the middle of a clearing full of dead plants in the shape of a perfect circle surrounded by trees that were eery reflections of each other and grown completely by magic… well, it might not have been the <em> best </em>idea. Even so, monitoring these sort of threats had become his responsibility in a way— there was literally no one else either qualified or willing to look into such threats before they became a major incident.</p><p>With caution and a light step, Harry made his approach still holding his wand at the ready. None of his scans of the trees or dead clearing showed an active magic, though the strength of the lingering latent power was certainly cause for concern. He could recognize a mage circle when he saw one and, from what his diagnostic spells were able to gleam, this ritual appeared to have been a recent summoning of some sort. Harry could not say that the lack of news for an impending apocalypse was reassuring. <em> Something </em> had happened here, something powerful and hungry was forced into existence and it was his job to go looking for it.</p><p>Gently prodding the door open with a silent gesture of wandless magic, Harry saw the singular object placed within the small confines of the singular room. Standing at the very center was the Mirror of Erised and it had been very deeply corrupted. Harry raised an eyebrow at the unassuming mirror, seemingly innocent despite the erratic surges of energy it began to pulsate with from his increased proximity. Suspecting a ritual that had not fully been completed, Harry backed out slowly, noting with a breath of relief that the power had returned to its previous gentle ripple. Safely outside, Harry used his auror pin spelled with a protean charm to summon reinforcements— his calls were always answered swiftly and promptly, no questions asked, after a previous incident involving the disappearance of an entire mixed muggle-wizard village.</p><p>Kingsley Shacklebolt and Amelia Bones sighed at the summoning charm while roughly two dozen wizards ran to fetch magic-resistant gear cursing the day they were assigned to Potter’s response team.</p><p>The team of wizards used the apparition coordinates provided through the charm to group travel to Harry’s location. He huffed a small laugh in amusement at their tense postures having appeared in a defensive formation— it’s not like <em> every </em>time he summons them is to an active battle.</p><p>In short order, Harry directed them to the mirror and gave his suspicions about the latent spell circle. Once cleared, a department of mysteries representative was summoned to dictate that the mirror would be remanded into the custody of the Unspeakables for study into how exactly it came to be involved in a ritual. At this point, several hours had passed— things tended to move slowly and cautiously when Auror Potter was around— and the response team was preparing to portkey the mirror away after survey spells would be cast in the area.</p><p>That was when Harry felt the power surge— the mirror was no longer reactive to their magical proximity but the survey spells brought it out in full force. Waves of magic rolled off the mirror and the aurors quickly made a run for it, not even needed Harry’s barked order.</p><p>“Fall back, shields up!” Harry bolted in front of the stragglers, throwing up the most powerful shield he could and began warding the area for magical backlash. Even though they were out of the spell circles range, anti-apparition and anti-portkey wards seemed to have been enacted by the ritual and Harry could feel the mirror reaching out to latch onto their magical signatures. In response, Harry threw out a wall of pure energy, redirecting its attention directly to him. Unfortunately, that seemed to be what the mirror was waiting for, locating his magic specifically completed the ritual and the world spun in a flash of golden light.</p><p>Harry Potter was gone with the mirror. Later that week a memorial statue was raised in his name and the world went on.</p><p> </p>
