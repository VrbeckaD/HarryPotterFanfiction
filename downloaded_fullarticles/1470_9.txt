          <div class="userstuff"><p> </p><p>Remus Lupin had a huge crush on Sirius Black. He truly liked the mischievous Gryffindor. But in moments like these, he didn’t. He was frustrated because of Sirius, and right now Remus couldn’t stand him. </p><p>Currently, Sirius was sitting next to him in the common room, and they were accompanied by their best friends James Potter and Peter Pettigrew. James and Sirius were plotting a way to cheat on their upcoming O.W.L. exams. </p><p>“I’m telling you, it's possible,” James was claiming. Peter shook his head and said it wasn’t worth the risk, that they would certainly fail the exams if they were caught.  </p><p><em> Or maybe they'll get expelled</em>, Lupin thought. <em>That would be nice. </em> </p><p>“Come on,” Sirius groaned. “We’ve cheated countless times on all sorts of things. There’s no way we’ll get caught this time. And come on, my plan is solid.” </p><p>James smirked at his best friend. “Have to agree, it sounds good.” </p><p>Remus, who had been quiet so far, decided it was time to intervene. </p><p>“Why can’t we just use our time to study? I’m pretty sure that would be easier and less risky.” </p><p>His two “friends” looked at him like he was crazy, then glanced at each other and burst into laughter. </p><p>“Like we would ever do that, you idiot,” Sirius said, still laughing. </p><p>
  <em> If I’m an idiot, I’m surely not the only one in this room... </em>
