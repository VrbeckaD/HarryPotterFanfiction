    <p>May 1998 </p>
<p>Harry walked back through the debris of the castle, once a beautiful landmark, now home to the disaster that had unfolded less than an hour ago. They’d surely send all the students home for summer early. </p>
<p>He surveyed the people around him, the living wizards who had survived were getting their wounds tended to. Those who had died must’ve been taken to a different room. No one wanted a physical reminder of their losses. </p>
<p>God, Fred. And Tonks, and Lupin. They were gone. </p>
<p>Little Teddy was an orphan. </p>
<p>Harry mentally vowed to make sure Teddy knew just how brave and heroic his parents were. </p>
<p>Hermione and Ron were both following him, but from a distance. </p>
<p>He could feel hundreds of pairs of eyes following him as he walked through what once was the Great Hall. </p>
<p>He didn’t set out towards anyone in particular, but he had begun to gravitate towards a certain redhead, who was currently sitting at a bench facing him but looking at the floor. </p>
<p>She let her tears flow freely, not bothering to even wipe at them. It broke Harry’s heart. </p>
<p>Suddenly, he was sitting next to her. She didn’t even move. She hadn’t even realized he was there. </p>
<p>“Ginny,” he said softly, getting her attention. </p>
<p>She finally looked at him, and realizing that it was Harry that had sat next to her, she threw her arms around him. </p>
<p>“Oh my God, Harry,” Ginny held him, stilling crying. </p>
<p>“It’s okay, Gin. Everything’s gonna be okay,” Harry tried to console her. She never cried like this. </p>
<p>Ginny looked him in the eyes, and he could practically feel her pulling herself back together. </p>
<p>“I know,” she answered. “It’s over. I can’t believe the war is finally over.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about Fred,” Harry said sadly. </p>
<p>Ginny made a face, making Harry think that she might start crying again, but then she merely took a deep breath, “Thanks.”</p>
<p>Sitting there with Ginny’s head on his shoulder, he wanted to tell her that he still wanted her. She was his and he was hers. He wanted to be her boyfriend again... but maybe it was too soon for that. Ginny would probably need time to heal from her brother’s death. </p>
<p>Harry loved her. They hadn’t even dated for very long before he had left to hunt the horcruxes, but still, Harry was in love with her. </p>
<p>He hoped she would still give him the chance to tell her. </p>
<p>“I missed you,” Ginny whispered, breaking the silence. </p>
<p>“I missed you too,” he replied. </p>
<p>“Harry, I know that this is definitely not the time, but um, could we talk about... us... sometime, not now. But, soon. In a few days?” Ginny asked. </p>
<p>“Since when did you learn Legilimency?” Harry joked. </p>
<p>Ginny smiled, “I didn’t. But glad to hear we’re on the same page.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Harry finally answered. “We can talk. Soon.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Ginny laid her head back on his shoulder. </p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do now?” Ginny asked. </p>
<p>“Dunno... I didn’t think about what I would do if I actually beat Voldemort. I wasn’t entirely sure I was going to win,” Harry admitted. </p>
<p>“Well, you could always come back to Hogwarts. We could take our 7th year together,” Ginny suggested. </p>
<p>Harry, although he liked the idea of being around Ginny for the whole next year, didn’t relish in the idea of another year of school. And he didn’t want to go without Ron and Hermione... well, Hermione might want to come back, but Ron would definitely not be wanting anything to do with school. </p>
<p>“I don’t know, I reckon I would fail all my NEWTs because I took a year off,” Harry said. </p>
<p>“I’d help you study,” Ginny told him. Harry seriously doubted that he would be able to focus on anything if it was Ginny there teaching him. </p>
<p>“I’ll think about it,” Harry replied, but he was pretty sure his time at Hogwarts was over. </p>
<p>They didn’t speak for a long time after that, and it was a long while later when nearly everyone else had left, when Harry finally left. </p>
<p>At first, he wasn’t sure where to go. He thought he might end up staying with the Weasleys after all, but then Hermione suggested they go back to Grimmauld place. </p>
<p>It was Harry’s house now, which was very strange to think about. And even better, he was now safe there. </p>
<p>He laid in his bed that night, feeling the happiest he’d felt in a long time. Voldemort was dead. The danger was gone. He could live.... not a normal life, he was going to be even more famous now. But he could live however he wanted to. </p>
<p>Ginny’s question had been a good one. What was he going to do now?</p>
<p>........</p>
<p>His answer came two days later. </p>
<p>None other than Kingsley Shacklebolt, newly instated Minister of Magic, appeared in Grimmauld place, having apparated directly in the dining room. Harry had been eating breakfast. </p>
<p>“Kingsley, what can I do for you?” Harry asked. </p>
<p>“Harry, after recent events, our department of Aurors is... diminished, what with most of them dead and several compromised. We need new Aurors, and fast. We want to capture any lingering Death Eaters as soon as possible.” Kingsley told him. </p>
<p>“Okay...” Harry replies, not quite understanding why Kingsley would come to him with this particular problem. </p>
<p>“Harry, I’m offering you a job,” he explained. </p>
<p>“Oh... but I thought you had to have five NEWTs and go through three years of training to become an Auror. I’m not exactly qualified,” Harry said. </p>
<p>“We’ve decided that any witch or wizard who fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and survived is worthy of the position of an Auror,” Kingsley told him. </p>
<p>“But—Kingsley, I’m not... I really think there are others who are far better for the job than I am,” Harry pressed on. </p>
<p>“Harry, you are one of the most powerful wizards of your age. You defeated the greatest dark wizard that has ever threatened the wizarding world. You, more than anyone, are more than qualified for the job. Your friends Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom have already accepted their positions. I know that it has been your ambition to become an Auror. Believe in yourself, Harry. You’re ready.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled. Maybe being an Auror... wouldn’t be so bad. </p>
<p>“Okay... then, I accept,” Harry finally answered. </p>
<p>“Excellent. Come to the ministry next Monday and we’ll be ready to introduce you and your friends to the department,” Kingsley turned to leave. “And Harry, you have done the wizarding world a great honor. We will always be indebted to you for your bravery.”</p>
<p>With that, Kingsley  apparated and Harry was alone again, but not for very long, as Ron and Hermione returned from the Burrow. </p>
<p>“Can you believe it?!” Ron shouted when he saw Harry, pulling him into a hug. “We’re going to be Aurors!”</p>
<p>Harry grinned. “The youngest Aurors ever, I s’pose... what about you, Hermione?”</p>
<p>“They asked me if I wanted a position, but I turned them down. I want to finish my education. We did miss our NEWTs after all,” Hermione answered matter-of-factly. </p>
<p>“You’ll be in class with Ginny then?” Harry asked. </p>
<p>“Yes, oh and Harry, Ginny says she’s ready to talk whenever you are. She said you’d know what she’s talking about,” Hermione told him. </p>
<p>“Oh, um, yeah... I should probably go soon then,” Harry stuttered, suddenly a little nervous. </p>
<p>“You planning on getting back together?” Ron replied nosily. </p>
<p>“Ron,” Hermione scolded. </p>
<p>Harry couldn’t lie, “I hope so.” </p>
<p>“Well, I’m sure she’ll be more than happy to take you back, Harry,” Hermione encouraged. </p>
<p>“Thanks,” he said, turning to go back to his room. He wanted to change his clothes before he left. </p>
<p>........</p>
<p>Harry apparated onto the front lawn of the Burrow. It was quiet and the garden gnomes were asleep on varying patches of grass. He walked through the main door, which led to the kitchen, where Mrs. Weasley was working on lunch. </p>
<p>“Harry, dear!” she exclaimed as he walked through the door. “I hope your well.” She came over hugging him tightly. </p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m sure Ron has told you the news,” Harry said. </p>
<p>“Yes! Aurors! You’ll both do amazing work! The youngest Aurors of all time!” Mrs. Weasley shouted. </p>
<p>Harry grinned.</p>
<p>“Well, considering Ron and Hermione are at your house, I’ll bet your here for Ginny?” Mrs. Weasley assumed. </p>
<p>“Er, yes.”</p>
<p>“Well, dear, I want you to know. You’re always welcome,” she told him. “Oh, and lunch will be ready in a half hour.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled and nodded, before moving past her towards the stairs. </p>
<p>He walked up to Ginny’s bedroom, nervously wiping his palms on his trousers. He took a deep breath and knocked on her door. </p>
<p>“Come in,” said Ginny’s muffled voice. </p>
<p>Harry opened the door to find Ginny sitting on her bed, a book about some quidditch team on her lap. She looked up at him and suddenly, he could no longer breathe. She was just as gorgeous as ever, her eyes looking right back at his. </p>
<p>“Harry,” she said in a mere whisper. </p>
<p>“Ginny, you... you ready to talk?” he asked even though she was the one who had called out to him. </p>
<p>Ginny nodded and patted the spot next to her. “Sit.”</p>
<p>Harry closed her bedroom door and did as he was told. </p>
<p>“So...” Harry began, but never continued. </p>
<p>“So...” Ginny mimicked with a soft giggle. “I’ve really missed you... I’ve really missed us.”</p>
<p>“Me too,” Harry said. </p>
<p>“I went over this in my head about a thousand times. I know we should probably wait, and take things slow, but if Fred taught me anything it’s that anything can happen, and you can’t always stop it from happening. I’ve decided that since life is so short, I don’t want to waste any time. Now that everything is over... all the danger is gone... Harry, will you be my boyfriend again?” </p>
<p>Wow. Okay, that was fast. </p>
<p>“Of course,” Harry answered without missing a beat. </p>
<p>Ginny blushed and grinned at him. “I heard about your new job,” she changed subjects. “Guess that ruins my hopes of you coming back to Hogwarts.” </p>
<p>“I can come visit sometime,” Harry suggested. “And we can see each other during Christmas holiday.” </p>
<p>“I’m going to really miss you, but I’m happy for you. I know being an Auror is a really big deal,” Ginny laced her hand into Harry’s. </p>
<p>“And of course, we can always write... I’ll have to get a new owl though,” Harry said sadly, thinking of Hedwig. </p>
<p>“As long as I get to snog you when I come home,” Ginny said, making Harry nearly choke on his own saliva. </p>
<p>“Ginny!” Harry shouted, but Ginny was giggling and leaned against him. </p>
<p>Harry began to laugh too. Seeing her happy and knowing that she was his again made him feel so much joy. </p>
<p>Somewhere in the fits of laughter, some kissing had started. It was wonderful and Harry felt as if he had no care in the world. </p>
<p>Then of course, the moment was over when Mrs. Weasley yelled up the stairs, “Lunch is ready!” </p>
<p>They broke apart, Ginny huffing, “My mother, bloody good at interrupting things... Fred was good at that too.” </p>
<p>Ginny’s face became sad, prompting Harry to respond, “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Ginny said. “It’s just... it’ll take a long time to get used to him not being around.”</p>
<p>Harry put his arms around Ginny, bringing her into a comforting embrace. </p>
<p>Ginny took a deep breath and hugged him tightly. After a minute, Ginny let go, “C’mon. Mum will have our necks if we don’t go down now.” </p>
<p>They walked down the stairs hand-in-hand, and went to sit at the table. Mrs. Weasley eyes their intertwined hands, but didn’t say anything. Harry could’ve sworn she was trying to not smile. </p>
<p> “Here you are, dears,” she said, placing a plate of food in front of them. </p>
<p>Under the table, their hands remained together as they ate and conversed with Mrs. Weasley. About halfway through lunch, Bill arrived with Fleur and George arrived five minutes later. By late afternoon, nearly the whole family was at the Burrow. Harry spent the day with Ginny, talking and telling stories of their time apart. It was good to be able to talk to her again. </p>
<p>The family was gathering for Fred’s funeral. They had to say goodbye, but didn’t want and couldn’t afford a big funeral, so they were having a small gathering. Family and close friends only.</p>
<p>Once everyone was in attendance, they all gathered around a fire that Bill had conjured in the yard. </p>
<p>It was a rather difficult situation for them to all be in. Voldemort was dead, so they were all relieved and happy, but Fred had been lost in the process. They were all grieving as much as they were celebrating the end of the war. </p>
<p>“I want to thank you all for coming, especially Fred’s friends,” Mr. Weasley said, nodding to a group that included Angelina Johnson and Lee Jordan, among others from their class. </p>
<p>“Fred wouldn’t want us to mourn him forever, so I think that tonight, we should allow ourselves this time to grieve. Then, tomorrow when we wake up, we should know that Fred is in a better place and let ourselves move on,” he continued. </p>
<p>Ginny was clutching at Harry’s arm. It was starting to go numb, but Harry knew Ginny needed him right now, so he let her hold onto him tightly as she let her tears fall down her face. Harry looked at the others around the fire, his gaze stopping on Ron, who had a distraught expression and was practically being held up by Hermione. </p>
<p>Harry’s own tears starting flowing and he didn’t stop them. </p>
<p>They spent the next long while telling stories about Fred through the years. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley told stories from his childhood, making his old school friends laugh. His siblings told stories of his pranks on them, and how even after his pranks he would tell them they had a free pass to get him back.</p>
<p>His friends told stories of him at school. George went last, speaking of the things no one else knew. Telling everyone of Fred’s talents that he kept hidden because he thought they weren’t a big deal. He told them stories of working together in Diagon Alley. </p>
<p>“I will always miss my brother. I will always wish he had lived.... However, if Fred was going to die young, there was no more nobler way for him to go. We are all indebted to his sacrifice. Because of him, we will all be able to live our lives happily.... To Fred,” George finished, raising the cup in his hand. </p>
<p>Everyone else followed suit, lifting their own cups. “To Fred.”</p>
<p>........</p>
<p>June-September 1998</p>
<p>Harry’s summer had started off with nightmares and PTSD, but by his 18th birthday, Harry was perhaps one of the happiest blokes on Earth. </p>
<p>He and Ginny had completely reconnected, their relationship stronger than ever before. They saw each other nearly everyday. </p>
<p>Harry had started his job as an Auror and was doing quite well. He himself had already apprehended five Death Eaters and transported them to Azkaban. Ron had gotten three and Neville had gotten one. </p>
<p>Harry spent five days of the week going to work and then returning to the Burrow to spend the evening with Ginny. During the weekends, he got to spend the whole day with her, and every Saturday, they would hang out with Ron and Hermione at Grimmauld place, where the four of them would have dinner. They all took turns learning the best cooking spells and trying to out-do the previous cook. Ginny was particularly good, Harry was adequate. Ron was better at cooking than Hermione, which she absolutely couldn’t stand. </p>
<p>June turned to July then turned to August. Ginny’s birthday, the 11th, came quickly and Harry prepared a spectacular present for her. It was a brand new Firebolt 2.0 that had just been released. Harry had even went to the trouble of getting Ginny’s name engraved onto the side of it. When she opened it, she nearly cried and tackled Harry in front of her entire family, kissing him without a care in the world. </p>
<p>There had been a whistle (looking at you, George) and some mild reprimands, but mostly everyone was smiling and happy that Ginny was happy. </p>
<p>“I bet they’ll be the next ones married,” Charlie had whispered to Bill, who chuckled, shaking his head. </p>
<p>Ginny had ended up staying at Grimmauld place with Harry that night. Needless to say, her birthday had been a success. </p>
<p>Ron and Hermione were both in the process of trying to leave their parents’ houses. They spent a little more than half of their nights at Grimmauld place. </p>
<p>Harry had offered for them to move in, since he had a whole house entirely to himself. There were four bedrooms and three bathrooms, more than enough for the three of them. </p>
<p>However, Hermione didn’t end up unpacking much because she was headed back to Hogwarts soon. </p>
<p>Harry and Ron had both expressed their despair at the fact that both their respective girlfriends would be at Hogwarts for the next nine months, save Christmas. </p>
<p>“You’ll have to let me know when your Quidditch matches are in your letters,” Harry had told Ginny one day in late August as they walked around the yard of the Burrow. “I want to see you ride on that new Firebolt.”</p>
<p>“Do you think you’ll be able to come? What if you have work to do?” Ginny asked. She was always concerned about Harry’s job. She didn’t want to make him miss work for a Quidditch match. </p>
<p>“I’ll take a vacation day or something if I have to,” Harry said, looking down at their interlaced fingers. </p>
<p>Ginny gave Harry a look that said “do not do that”, and she shook her head in desperation. </p>
<p>“I probably won’t even have much work going on by then, Gin,” Harry added. “We’ve gotten almost all the Death Eaters in Azkaban.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you do come, be sure not to steal my spotlight,” Ginny joked. “I know it’ll be hard, Harry ‘the Chosen One’ Potter.”</p>
<p>“Nah, you can have all the fame if you want it,” Harry replied, grinning. </p>
<p>September 1st, unfortunately, came and Ginny and Hermione left on the train to Hogwarts, leaving Harry feeling sad. </p>
<p>But he knew, this... this was only the beginning.</p>
