    <p class="western" align="left">Of Credence’s three crappy summer jobs, the best by far was the one he didn’t get paid for. It was community service, or at least that was how he had sold it to his mother: three afternoons a week sweeping floors and cleaning windows at the library, and in return he was allowed to leave a bundle of church pamphlets on the front table beside the local newspapers and community college flyers.</p><p class="western" align="left">“I can spread the word, Ma,” he had said hopefully, when he’d broached the idea with her at the start of the summer. It had been a calculated risk. Mary-Lou Barebone approved of hard work, but she liked it better when that work benefited the church directly. Last summer it had been twelve-hour days in the soup kitchen. The summer before, Credence had trudged around town pushing pamphlets into letter boxes and getting sunburn on the back of his neck. Never mind that the congregation had been dwindling for years; never mind that her fire-and-brimstone sermons were becoming something of a joke in the town. There was always work to do.</p><p class="western" align="left">But this time, there were a few factors in Credence’s favour. With the big annual fundraiser coming up, Mary-Lou had two priorities: guilting as many sponsors as possible into donating to the church, and keeping her youngest child under <em>someone’s </em><span>eye, as her own were much too busy. Nine-year-old Modesty wasn’t like Credence and Chastity had been at that age, obediently occupied with the endless tasks that small hands could get done. She was what Mary-Lou called ‘intractable’, which meant that even when she wasn’t arguing </span><span>with you</span><span>, you could always tell that she wanted to.</span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>Chastity, who had been expected to watch both her siblings when they were younger, was needed at the church to handle the phones. Credence would have been roped into the same task if his voice had been better suited for talking people into things; as it was, his tendency to trip over his tongue when talking to strangers had disqualified him automatically. He’d arranged the timing carefully; Modesty would come with him to the library, where she could keep herself entertained easily enough, and Chastity would pick her up on the way home from church at six so that Credence could get to his night shift at the supermarket across the street. That was the better part of three days a week that neither Credence or Modesty had to spend at home.</span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">“I’m going to read <em>everything</em>,” Modesty announced solemnly, on the first afternoon. She looked around at the stacks, small hands on her hips, a determined frown taking over her face. She was half Credence’s size and at least twice as intimidating when she looked like that.</p><p class="western" align="left">“Don’t tell Ma,” he pleaded. “Tell her you’re studying, okay? Have you got your math textbook?”</p><p class="western" align="left">Modesty rolled her eyes. “Of course.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence left her sitting on the floor in the Junior Fiction, her back against the shelves,<span> reading something with dragons on the front cover that would definitely be put through the shredder if it was seen anywhere at home. Armed with Windex and a packet of scrubbing cloths, he got to work earning their keep. Cleaning was one of the few things he was actually good at. He got in plenty of practice at the church.</span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>He checked in on Modesty a few times through the afternoon, bringing her an illicit juice box at three, but she was too busy inhaling the complete works of Roald Dahl to pay him any attention. The librarian didn’t seem to care all that much either, so Credence allowed himself the occasional five minute break in the reference section (which was right at the back of the library and nearly always deserted). There was an actual lectern in the corner, dating back fifteen years to before the library had been rehoused into a much smaller building. The atlas it supported was much older, an enormous stately volume that was rarely opened any more. Credence turned the gilt-edged pages reverently, sounding out the names of cities under his breath. He’d had a plan once to go to college interstate, but in the end he’d barely scraped through high school. At twenty, his life was headed along the same nowhere track it had always been, and it was all his own fault.</span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>Chastity was exactly where she wanted to be. She had taken over the church finances straight out of school, she’d always had a head for numbers. Now that Mary-Lou was trying to expand into social media, Chastity was handling most of that too. And Modesty, she was </span>
  <em>bright –</em>
  <span> Credence was already looking into scholarships for her, so that when the time came, she’d have a ticket out of this town already lined up.</span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>He closed the atlas and got back to work. </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>When Chastity came to collect her, Modesty was bent over her math book and Credence was applying his best elbow grease to the display cabinets. “She’s behaved herself?” Chastity asked, but it was perfunctory; she was tired, with print from the church pamphlets smudged on her fingers. Credence wondered if she ever daydreamed about dropping the phone, walking out, taking the first bus to anywhere. If sometimes she listened to their mother preach and thought, </span>
  <em>but that makes no sense. </em>
  <span>If she did, it never showed.</span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>By the end of the first week, Modesty had worked her way along the Junior Fiction shelves from A to T and Mildred at the circulation desk had more or less adopted her. Where Credence was usually too nervous to start conversations, aware that he had nothing interesting to say, Modesty plunged straight in with a nine-year-old’s bull-headedness. She wanted to know what Mildred liked to read (romance novels about billionaires, mostly), and how the library decided what books to buy, and how the Dewey Decimal System worked. </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">“<span>Why are you stamping those books?” she asked, standing on tip-toe to see over the desk. “I thought you weren’t supposed to write in library books.”</span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span>These are discards.” Mildred held up an example. The book was a paperback with a knight on the front cover and some sort of beast encircling him, its scales vivid blue, close enough to a dragon to catch Modesty’s attention. “This was donated to the library a few years ago, but it’s in pretty bad shape, you see? So we have to get rid of it.”</span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span>You’re throwing a book </span><em>away</em><span>?”</span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>Mildred laughed. “Even we have to do that eventually, kid.”</span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">“<span>Hey, I’ll throw it away for you, if you want,” Modesty said in her most helpful voice, and Mildred fell for it, as people usually did. Credence, though, recognised his sister’s plotting face when he saw it, and caught her stuffing the book into her backpack.</span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span>You know you can’t bring that home,” he whispered. He understood the temptation – it was frustrating for her, having to read everything in bits at the library when other people could check out the books any time and Modesty would have to wait weeks to get them back – but Ma would find out, Ma </span><em>always </em><span>found out. No books were allowed in the house until Mary-Lou had approved them first, and Credence could tell at a glance this was not a book she was going to approve. </span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span>I want it,” Modesty hissed. “Nobody else wants it! Why can’t it be mine?”</span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>Credence hated saying no to her. He was supposed to be on her side – someone had to be – and Modesty would hold onto the grudge for weeks if he made her leave the book behind. He pulled it out of her bag. </span>
  <em>Silvertongue</em>
  <span>, said the title in big curling letters. The knight wore a black cloak and an impatient expression, like he was waiting for Credence to make up his mind as much as Modesty was. The blue beast wasn’t a dragon; it looked more like a serpentine sort of a bird. Credence ran a thumb along the spine. It was a thick book – a bit warped with water damage, like someone had left it in the rain, but holding together well just the same. He opened it to chapter one.</span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em>The courtiers of Macusa were in uproar. Rumours had reached them of a dark presence spreading westward, through the towns and villages along the border of the kingdom, and everyone had something to say. Of all the court, only Queen Seraphina and her champion, Sir Percival, were silent, for each had already decided upon what needed to be done…</em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">“<span>Okay,” Credence said. He held the book up, measuring it by eye. “Can you talk Mildred into letting us use the photocopier for free?”</span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>It wasn’t a great plan. Modesty’s math textbook was larger and the photocopied front cover didn’t fit around quite right, but with a lot of sticky tape, it held. The subterfuge put Modesty in a rare, gleeful mood. She swung on Credence’s hand like she had when she was small.</span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">“<span>Will you read it to me?” she asked.</span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span>You read so much faster than I do,” Credence said, surprised. He had not read to Modesty in years.</span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span>You’re better at doing voices,” she said. “You used to read me bedtime stories.” </span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>So he had, until Mary-Lou had rearranged the chore schedule and there wasn’t time for that in the evening any more. Credence was struck by a sudden, forceful pang of guilt. “I’ll read it if you want,” he said quickly, “but we have to be really careful. Promise?”</span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>Modesty smiled. She didn’t do that enough. “Promise!”</span>
</p><p class="western" align="center">
  <span>*</span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>It didn’t take Credence long to fall in love with the book, even harder than Modesty. This was their new schedule: they left for the library an hour earlier, so that Credence could finish at five. Then they’d go to sit in the closed stairwell that led down into the parking garage. Mary-Lou and Chastity only ever came through the front doors, never from the side, so it was a pretty safe spot for their tiny secret book club. Modesty liked to sit on the step below Credence, so that she could rest her head on his knees, and she’d close her eyes while he read to her from </span>
  <em>Silvertongue.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>It was set in the kingdom of Macusa, which was the most wonderful place Credence could never have imagined. Everyone had magic there. They used it for everything, from travelling on flying broomsticks to washing the dishes with the flip of a wand. </span>
  <span>
    <span>Strange beasts roamed the land, like the tricksy little Niffler and the fierce Occamy, lovingly described in so much detail that Modesty got impatient and demanded Credence skip back to the story. She liked the battles best. </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>
    <span>There were a lot of battles. The hero, Albus, had been tasked by Queen Seraphina to seek out a mysterious monster that was terrorising the land. It was a shape-changer, almost impossible to find, but there were plenty of other villainous characters to keep him occupied in the meantime – bandits, mercenaries, double-crossing courtiers – and he spent so much time sorrowfully reminiscing about his dearest friend who had Gone To The Bad that Credence was sure that the friend would show up at some point for a dramatic fight. </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>
    <span>Queen Seraphina, who was </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>beautiful and clever </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>and a bit manipulative, was Modesty’s favourite character. Credence’s was the Champion of the Realm, Sir Percival, who had gone to fight the monster in chapter two and promptly vanished without a trace. He had just reappeared, at the beginning of chapter seven, but Credence had a dreadful feeling that the man who returned from the forest was not really Sir Percival at all. He kept doing strange, cruel things. None of the other characters seemed to have noticed his strange behaviour at all and it was driving Credence mad.</span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">“<span><span>The monster killed him and now it’s going to </span></span><span><span>try to </span></span><span><span>kill the queen,” Modesty predicted darkly.</span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span><span>No. He has to be alive,” Credence argued. “He’s going to come back and fight it, and prove to everyone that they were wrong.”</span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span><span>Albus is the hero. That means he fights the monster,” Modesty explained. “He might save the queen, and then they’ll get married, and he won’t be sad about that friend who left him any more. Percival’s not very important to the story.”</span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span><span>He’s important!” Credence was embarrassed by how indignant he felt, but couldn’t help himself. “He knew he was probably going to fail, but he tried. People were being hurt, so he tried to do something about it. He’s brave.”</span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span><span>Maybe we find out </span></span><span><span>where he is </span></span><span><span>in the next chapter,” Modesty said cunningly.</span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>
    <span>Credence sighed. “We don’t have time, it’s nearly six. Chastity will be here soon.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">“<span><span>Ten more minutes? Please?”</span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span><span>Five minutes,” Credence said, inevitably giving in. And she was right. The next chapter opened with Percival, the real Percival, alone in the forest.</span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em>
    <span>He had lost count of the days here, in this dark place of endless trees. Percival had taken to marking his way on the trunks he passed, but a strange fancy had crept upon him, that the bark smoothed out as soon as he turned his back, to better keep him prisoner…</span>
  </em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>
    <span>The long shadows of late afternoon began to spill down the stairs. Credence needed to stop reading, he would stop reading any minute now.</span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">…<em><span>And a new dread was growing in his belly, a twisting, thorned thought: he was not alone. Percival’s hand lingered upon the hilt of his sword as he stood in the fading sunlight. Had he truly heard the sound of footsteps? Was it not more likely to be a beast retreating to its burrow for the night, cracking twigs beneath heavy paws? There had been no sign of human life in the forest in all this time: no smoke from a fire, no path pushed through the undergrowth. And yet. Percival turned a slow circle, his boots stirring the thick carpet of dried leaves. He had come to the forest hunting a monster…what, he thought, if the monster was now hunting him?</span></em></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span><span>Ohhh,” Modesty breathed. Credence barely heard her. He had to know what happened next.</span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em>
    <span>His first thought, when he saw it, was dreamlike, illogical: there was a mirror between the trees, reflecting his own face back at him as he had last seen it. But Percival had not shaved his face in many days, there were leaves in his hair and dirt on his clothes, while this vision was pristine in its elegance. The stillness was absolute. Then the man stepped forward, shedding Percival’s face as a snake sheds its skin, or a courtier drops a mask. He was older, his hair bleached white, eyes wicked with amusement. “Well, sir knight, here I am,” he said. “Are you going to fight me?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">“<em><span>What are you?” Percival breathed, his sword half-drawn. His limbs would not quite obey him; as if this man had in some way laid claim on them for himself.</span></em></p><p class="western" align="left">“<em><span>Why, don’t you know?” The white-haired man spread his hands. “I am the monster you seek. I am the Faceless, the Nameless. I am Everyone. I am No One. I am you, Sir Percival, if I want to be. I go where I will, and when I am done</span></em><span><span>,</span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span><span>Credence!”</span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em>
    <span>you will all speak my name as a god.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">“<span><span>Credence,” Chastity said, and he blinked, looking up. </span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>
    <span>They had been caught. Credence had ruined everything, though the thought of that did not immediately sink in. He saw Chastity with an unusual clarity, standing framed in the fading sunlight at the top of the stairs: her confusion turning to anger, because he’d been </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>stupid</span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span>, and now she had to do something about it, and what was worse, she had to tell on Modesty too… </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>
    <span>Credence blinked again, and she wasn’t there.</span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>The air was thick, shimmering, as if everything – the cement of the stairwell walls, the cracked tile steps, the library itself – might all dissolve at a touch. </span>
  <span>
    <span>The slight, warm weight of Modesty’s head against Credence’s legs was gone; </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>she</span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span> was gone. Where his sisters had been stood two men: one armoured and unshaven, kneeling on the step where Modesty had been, while the other was white-haired and wicked-eyed, standing above them both.</span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">“<span><span>Hm,” said the white-haired man. “This is interesting.”</span></span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>
    <span>The book dropped out of Credence’s nerveless hands. The knight at his side made a raw sound, scraping a hand across his eyes in disbelief. “What have you done, monster?”</span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>
    <span>The white-haired man turned in a controlled circle, studying his surroundings with one finger raised, as if to test the direction of the wind. “Do you know,” he said, “I cannot </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>wait</span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span> to find out.” Then he was gone too, a whisper blown away by the breeze.</span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>
    <span>Credence looked up to find a sword levelled at his throat. Dark eyes stared down at him, wild and furious. “Who the </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span> are you?” demanded Sir Percival of House Graves. “And where the hell is this?”</span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>Credence had never once in his life claimed to be good in a crisis. Fear froze him in place, left him speechless and staring. It held him obediently still when his mother reached for the belt, kept him sitting quietly in a pew while the venom of her sermon crashed down over his head – it had held him in this town all along, an inertia that he was unable to break, and it held him now, trembling beneath the sharp edge of a very real sword.</span>
</p><p class="western" align="left">“<em>Answer me</em><span>,” Percival barked.</span></p><p class="western" align="left">“Library,” Credence gabbled. “Silvertongue. I’m so sorry.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Percival lowered his sword, just a fraction. “Try again,” he said, “and this time make sense.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“You were in the book,” Credence whispered. “You were in the book, and now you’re not. I don’t know what’s happening. Please, I’m sorry, I don’t know. If you’re going to kill me, can I find my sisters first?”</p><p class="western" align="left">Percival let the sword fall to his side, frowning down at Credence. “What’s your name?”</p><p class="western" align="left">“C-Credence.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“And your sisters?”</p><p class="western" align="left">“Modesty. And Chastity. They were here – they must have run away…”</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence did not quite believe that, even as he said it. His sisters had been there, and then they weren’t, in the same absolute way that two men from a story had simply appeared from nowhere. He realised belatedly that he was shaking so hard his teeth were clicking together. This made it difficult to stand up, though that was obviously what he had to do. Whatever had happened, it was his fault. But he could not make his feet take his weight.</p><p class="western" align="left">A large hand gripped him firmly by the elbow and pulled him upright. The shock of <em>touch</em><span> – evidence that not only was Percival real, Credence was too, everything about this was </span><em>real</em><span> – left him speechless again, staring helplessly. Percival was approximately two inches shorter than Credence was. He had dark eyes beneath straight dark brows, a week’s worth of beard growth to match his uncombed hair, and there was a panther engraved on his breastplate. He was wearing a breastplate. Because he was a knight from a storybook. Credence swayed on the spot.</span></p><p class="western" align="left">“<span>Kindly don’t faint,” Percival said. “I need you to help me kill the monster.”</span></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <span>Credence fainted.</span>
</p><p class="western" align="left"> </p>
