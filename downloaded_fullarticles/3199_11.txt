    <p align="justify"><br/> ‘Ah, Ms. McGonagall!’ Her boss looked up from the stack of parchments he was organizing at the desk. The man seemed to be in a bright mood.<br/> ‘May I disturb you for a moment, sir?’<br/> ‘Please.’ Mr. Urquart waved towards the leather armchairs across his heavy wooden desk, but Minerva remained standing at the door. She got distracted by the parchments, which now were elevating into the air and whirling around him before they found their places on the mahogany shelf.<br/> ‘I am here to talk about the promotion, sir.’ She paused to recollect herself.<br/> ‘Of course, be so kind to go ahead. It is about time we knew where we stand, isn’t it?’<br/> ‘Yes. Well, yes. Sir,’ Minerva have never felt more uncomfortable, wishing to get through the mandatory courtesy round as soon as possible before she would get to the point. ‘It is indeed a generous offer, and I am truly thankful for your commendation to the position…’<br/> ‘I certainly am trying to make a way for the brightest gems of my team; and of course…’ Here he looked her up and down maybe a bit more overtly than he intended. ‘For the ones who deserve it. You have demonstrated both great competence and excellent work ethics in the past two years, Ms. McGonagall.’<br/> ‘I am pleased to hear your acknowledgment, sir’, Minerva said. Such a praise was indeed far from usual, considering his fastidious nature.<br/> ‘Well then, can I take it as accepted? The promotion offer, I mean.’<br/> ‘Not quite.’<br/> ‘Not quite?’ Mr. Urquart lifted an eyebrow.<br/> ‘In fact, no.’<br/> He was tasting her words slowly in an insolently unhurried, yet meaningfully serious way, which made Minerva holding her breath, as if she was about to hear some final verdict.<br/> He made it clear yet again that it was him who dictated the pace of the conversation.<br/> ‘Would you like to remain my assistant for life, Ms. McGonagall?’ Mr. Urquart asked finally, walking back to his desk. Apparently he deemed the topic not worthy enough for his undivided attention. ‘I can assure you without the slightest of doubt that much more potential is hiding in you.’<br/> ‘No, I am… What I am trying to say is that… I was found with an alternative offer, sir.’<br/> ‘Oh, from the Hit Wizard division, I suppose’ Mr. Urquart went on abstractedly while he was trying to lock a drawer of his desk with an odd-shaped key. ‘Alfred Devine has this rather terrible habit of attempting to scrounge or lure over to his team all my excellent human material. But if you take my... advice…’<br/> The key apparently got stuck, and while observing the little struggle, Minerva made sure he wouldn’t finish his sentence.<br/> ‘Actually, it is from outside the Ministry, sir.’<br/> Mr. Urquart seemed to be genuinely taken by surprise; at least there was a sudden, although subtle flicker of bewilderment in his eyes as he drew himself up and looked at her.<br/> ‘Is it?’ He asked slowly. ‘And from where exactly, if I may…?’<br/> ‘Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A teaching position. At the Transfiguration Department.’<br/> ‘That is… well, surely a… suitable position for you.’ He was carefully choosing his words, but his undisguised expression made her feel shamefully ungrateful and oddly uneasy.<br/> ‘Yes, it is, I guess, sir. And... I have already well, sort of... accepted it.’<br/> ‘Sort of?’ Beating around the bush was something Elphinstone Urquart had always found a mere waste of time. But the unintentional sharpness in his tone was only a result of an ill-fated attempt trying to conceal an emotion much more different than rage.<br/> ‘I did accept it in truth,’ Minerva admitted quickly. There was an awkward silence lingering between them.<br/> ‘I am here to hand in my notice, sir.’<br/> The words sounded heavier than she had planned; they were managed to be put anything but smoothly.<br/> Oh, gosh, she must be immensely disappointing him right now, the thought rushed through Minerva all at once. After all, he had put great effort in tutoring and chiseling her in his own demanding, fastidious, nevertheless strangely pleasant way, aiming at high quality at all times. Then also, he had gone to a great distance by representing her interests when it came to her possible appointment to a position many would kill at such a young age. What an ungrateful, childish move she might have just made.<br/> For a long moment, Minerva thought that Mr. Urquart did not even react at all, waiting for further explanation, but then...<br/> ‘Duly noted.’ Her boss’ voice appeared strangely rusty. He cleared his throat and squared his broad shoulders. ‘I am sure that it is a well-considered decision, however, I encourage you, Ms. McGonagall to revisit it once again before you have your final say.’</p><p align="justify">But that was her final say, and she told him so with conviction.<br/> There was no reprimand, no begging, no nothing. The rest was settled in a plain, practical, matter-of-fact manner: Minerva was informed about the contractual notice period of two months – which meant that it was impossible for her to take her new job at the school before November –; then her boss sent an urgent owl about her candidacy having been withdrawn; and then....<br/> And then there she was, standing in the middle of his mahogany-panelled office, every inch of which she knew far too well, and suddenly another sensation took grip of her.<br/> <em> She</em> <em>might</em> <em>not</em> <em>even</em> <em>want</em> <em>to</em> <em>leave</em>.<br/> Minerva almost wished that Mr. Urquart explicitly asked her to stay – a wish which almost immediately seemed so stupid and irrational, since why would she use him as a justification or pretext to stay, saving her from making an independent decision on her own future? And why would he want her to stay that badly at all? She is not more than a just-above-the-average upstart who, although performs decently, could not get to like her working environment, therefore now grabs a more enticing opportunity. That is all.<br/> By that time she had been confident about her decision. Or so she had thought, up until that point.<br/> ‘I must admit, this change of heart came out of the blue,’ Mr. Urquart said at last. ‘And again, the way in which it had been already settled in the background... But of course, who could compete with such a bid from one of world’s most prestigious teaching institutions when it comes to an animagus. Before the Wizengamot we do not perform much transfiguration, do we?’<br/> He was examining her for a while, thoughts racing around in his head; there would be so much to say or confess.<br/> ‘What a loss you will be.’</p><p align="justify"><br/> His plan to reassign her had clearly backfired. Yes, he originally wanted her to be a bit afar from him in order to be able to clear his head. That twenty year-old lass – although unknowingly and unintentionally, but slowly and steadily – enchanted his senses like no woman had done prior, and he had to admit that it annoyed him very much. Elphinstone Urquart had always been the hunter, and now, for Merlin’s sake, he had been brought down regularly by a glance, by a delicate gesture, by a certain intonation.<br/> This sensation shall pass anyway, he had kept trying to convince himself. Just a temporary affection. Although... an unprecedentedly intense, captivating… ravishing… all-devouring one... But transient! Of course, it is, what else would it be? It is going to pass sooner or later, and everything will be fine again. It will be fine.<br/> He happened to be wrong about all these.<br/> Collaborating had become increasingly difficult, for his thoughts regularly wandered away when she was nearby. And Ms. McGonagall, being his assistant, was nearby from 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. Every. Single. Day.<br/> And she continued lingering around in his thoughts long after he had closed the office door behind himself. While that young lady knew nothing about it, she invaded his most intimate and private spheres: his mind and his heart. She knew nothing about his attraction towards her; his sleepless nights; his constant struggle to suppress the most inappropriate daydreams triggered by her sheer presence. Imagining her long, raven hair freed from that chignon... the locks falling onto her fair shoulders all the way down onto her naked back... the taste of her soft, pink lips... that gasp she would make into his ear at the first thrust... Although these certainly involuntary, yet unstoppable images gave him all the right shivers, they also caused a certain disgust in himself for keep letting himself engross in them. She was so young; could easily be her daughter.<br/> But what bothered him more was not really the age difference.<br/> Because he did not fool himself that in another setting, irrespective of the years which parted them, he would not have hesitated a second to jump. But he was not allowed to move, and he did decide not to move on purpose: Starting a conquest and potentially an affair would have costed Ms. McGonagall her job due to employee conflict of interest - and possibly her reputation as well. She was too precious for him to let it happen - precious both as a colleague and expert, as well as an almost friend-like acquaintance for who he actually cared. He cared, Mr. Urquart realized step by step along the way. He had never cared for anybody. What an unfamiliar, yet strangely pleasant way it felt, caring.<br/> Therefore another section of the Department, or a whole different department would have done. But a castle far in the North... That would have practically meant a farewell for good. His plan to remove her from under his supervision and sphere of authority would have been only a prelude so that he could have her, and… his intention was definitely not to say goodbye to her.</p><p align="justify"><br/> Minerva could not let go of the inconvenient feeling emanating from not having been able to present the facts and her plans adequately, and was slightly worried about some kind of potential retorsion in the following weeks. Despite having known him as an impeccable gentleman and having had excellent, if not amicable rapport with Mr. Urquart – if amicable could be the right adjective to describe a merry and estimable, but a clearly unequal and subordinate relationship –, she knew his merciless and overpowering courtroom battleground strategies in his capacity as a criminal defense lawyer. She did not fool herself even for a brief moment about how it would take him no effort to finish her career-wise in case he wished, after what could have been perceived as back-stabbing.<br/> But there was no retorsion. Mr. Urquart did not show any signs of either resentment or regret. The only thing she noticed was his booming, rich and sonorous voice becoming somewhat muted or dull. Although it could easily have been a result of a nasty cold too. Otherwise, it was business as usual. Except for her very last day before departure.</p><p align="justify">‘I would like to have a couple of words with you, Ms. McGonagall before you leave.’ His boss was standing at the office door. Underneath his usual tranquil and almost regal demeanor Minerva could sense a bit of a discomfort this time.<br/> ‘Sir.’ She closed the box in which all her office-belongings were packed, and turned to Mr. Urquart.<br/> ‘I can see that you have charmed away all traces of you belonging to this place. No reminders intended?’ As he was walking closer, his gaze swept through her working area, now stripped of everything personal.<br/> Minerva shook her head. ‘Not my style. What matters here is how well the job has been done, not by who.’<br/> ‘And what a job has been done...! Now, now, don’t be so humble, claim the glory you deserve. Ultimately, the result of the work and the worker’s contribution are intrinsically interconnected.’<br/> ‘So aren’t we just gears in the machine? Isn’t it a job which is ungrateful, yet demanding?‘<br/> ‘Is it indeed what I said?’ he growled upon recognizing his own words once preached to her on a rainy September morning – which now felt like a lifetime ago.<br/> ‘Quote on quote, sir.’ Minerva smiled cautiously. Then, as the thought of her own ungratefulness hit her, the smile immediately vanished from her face.<br/> But Mr. Urquart seemingly chose not to make the association, and carried on leisurely with the conversation.<br/> ‘And you are lacking the passion for giving your time and energy to and for the Ministry.’ It was not quite a question. He tended to speak like that, it was a form of subtle command and control, the young witch had observed.<br/> ‘Not my words either. But I could not have phrased it better, to be honest.’<br/> ‘And speaking of being honest...’ He was taking a meaningful look around the office. Minerva’s gaze followed his instinctively.<br/> ‘How did you like it here, Ms. McGonagall?’ the man asked eventually, once his look settled on Minerva again. ‘And I do not request the good old, expected, polite answer. I’d wish to have the genuine and honest one. Since I have already given you your letter of reference, you can be candid about your impressions.’ Mr. Urquart gave her an almost waggish-like smile. Almost, since Mr. Urquart would never do such a thing; it would simply be way out of character.<br/> ‘I carry a lot of ambivalent feelings about the Department, I must admit.’ Minerva did not intend to go further, but the rest slipped out clumsily. ‘Working here did not really meet my expectations, sir. Um... in that.. not in that I’ve looked down on the position or the institution... For Merlin’s sake, it was not my intention to put it that way, really.’ She was cursing her inability to express her thoughts properly. ‘Rather, um... I think I... don’t suit this job. I don’t possess what it takes to be a legal practitioner... that is. My talents lay… elsewhere, I guess. Yes.’<br/> Her face was burning with embarrassment; this one did not go down very well, either. But Mr. Urquart was watching her and her little struggle with calm amusement instead.<br/> ‘Nice save,’ he spoke at last. ‘So if I understood correctly, you disliked working here; had a god-awful superior with insurmountable requirements; difficult, calculating colleagues with an attitude of entitlement on top of the nerv-wrecking characteristics of our lovely bureaucracy.’<br/> Minerva opened then closed her mouth opting for not to oppose him that vehemently, and let him finish.<br/> ‘Trust me, I can assume what you have felt inconvenient about.’ His tone changed from teasing to serious. ‘I have been here for about two decades. This environment requires thick skin. It is not everyone’s cup of tea, I understand, Ms. McGonagall. I do.’<br/> ‘But you endure it, sir, don’t you? You even like it, sometimes I was inclined to think.’<br/> ‘I do. I like it difficult. If it was easy, everybody could do it. Cliché it might be...,’ he leaned slightly forward as if passing a secret to her. ‘…but a cliché with a good driving force.’<br/> These last couple sentences just fitted his personality so well, Minerva thought smirking internally as she stepped back, took the box from her desk, shrank it with a wand motion, and locked it in her purse. She wanted to end it on a more positive note.<br/> ‘You are not god-awful, sir. Not even “careless about your underlings and co-workers up until the point of being insensitive”, you know.’ She grew braver by what she perceived as his tacit encouragement.<br/> ‘Is that what they say?’ he asked with counterfeit surprise. Of course, the corridors had been echoing from such characterization of him. He tended to overlook the human factor despite his excellently polished manners. Listening him while he was sending people to hell was as if witnessing a form of art in the making.<br/> ‘Elphinstone-heart Urquart, they warned me when I arrived.’<br/> ‘Yes, that one I have heard,’ his lips curled slightly upwards. As they did so, fine crow’s feet appeared around his eyes. He had quite lovely eyes, Minerva noticed suddenly. ‘And what do you think, Ms. McGonagall? Empirically verified? The stone-heart.’<br/> ‘The stone-heart? No. Maybe some lordly high-mindedness, if I may...’ she gave him an oblique glance, fearing to now overstep a demarcation line.<br/> ‘It is all right. I would normally terminate an employee’s contract within a moment for such a remark, but,’ he looked at his watch. ‘Seven and a half minutes ago I became weaponless. And frankly, I was the one who requested genuine honesty...’<br/> ‘Then allow me, sir to seize this opportunity to say...’<br/> ‘You don’t have to counterbalance it, Ms. McGonagall, you really don’t.’<br/> ‘No, I... sure.’ Minerva shrugged slightly and wrapped the strap of the leather purse around her wrist. She was almost ready to leave, but before doing so, she wanted to express her thanks in some form nevertheless.<br/> ‘You were the best thing about my time here, sir. I just want you to know that.’<br/> Mr. Urquart’s stone-heart skipped a beat.<br/> ‘And see,’ she set off towards the door, not even realizing the weight of her words previously spoken. ‘You do care about your colleagues’ opinion and perception. Otherwise we would not be having this talk.’<br/> ‘I don’t. Believe me, you were an exception. Where on earth will I find somebody like you?’<br/> ‘At the Human Resources Department, right in the pile of application parchments,’ Minerva said with a lighthearted laugh. She felt pleasantly carefree, knowing that this was going to be the last time she saw that suffocating place of hierarchy, pure-blood bigotry and egoistic, pity, cruel games played at the expense of each other in order to climb the proverbial ladder.<br/> She was about to be freed from the Ministry’s toxic environment.</p><p align="justify">As a matter of fact, Minerva did mean it when she referred to her former boss as the best thing about her time at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Although the young witch felt deep down the paradox of having been comforted by someone’s humanity and fairness, who was considered by his co-workers to be unwilling to show sympathy.<br/> Nevertheless, Minerva found this result-oriented, accomplished and formidable go-getter an honest crook, whose bible were the statute books and above all the penal code; whose words she drank in without noticing it, and whose ease in those verbal and intellectual combats she silently admired.<br/> A good lawyer never lies, he would say; they just bend the truth by putting it in different lightning, and approach from a different angle, remember that, Ms. McGonagall. And Minerva did, that is why she had left a pair of cufflinks with ‘Don’t trust me’ and ‘I’m a lawyer’ on them as a farewell present on his desk.</p><p align="justify">‘I wish you all the best, Ms. McGonagall.’<br/> ‘I wish you all the best, Mr. Urquart.’<br/> He was watching her slender figure walking away, following her with his gaze all the way down the corridor. And as she was fading away, he had an odd, but definite feeling about parts of him being taken with her.<br/> Little pieces of his stone-heart, waiting to be recollected.</p>
