    <p>Naruto Uzumaki is seen running from a mob of villagers. The chase continued until he ran into the forest, confusing the mob. One of the villagers probably shrugged, as if to say that they'll hunt for him next time.</p><p>'<em>Dammit</em>,<em> barely made it out alive.</em>' The young whiskered kid thought. He wanders around, now believing that the villagers probably gave up looking for him. However, as he walked around, he saw a cave.</p><p>"Hmm, I wonder where does this lead?" He said. After that, he entered the cave.</p><p>The cave looks rather creepy. It has moss hanging from the walls, a bunch of strange symbols and even depictions of human beings. </p><p>Naruto continued walking until he saw a glowing golden sphere. He never even saw one before.</p><p>"What does that sphere do?" he asked. But upon touching it, something random happened. The glow became intense, so Naruto had to cover his eyes to avoid being blind.</p><p>After the glow calmed down and Naruto to uncover his eyes, another strange phenomenon happened. It showed a holographic image of a man in his twenties, wears a hooded jacket, a shirt with an eagle on it, a pair of blue jeans and white sneakers. He is also wearing a satchel. The imaged man began speaking.</p><p>"Greetings, young one." He announced. This caused Naruto to stumble a bit.</p><p>"Who... who are you?" he asked.</p><p>"My name's Desmond Miles. An Assassin." The now identified Desmond introduced. However, the last part confused the whiskered boy.</p><p>"What's an Assassin?" the boy asked again, completely having no idea what is definitely the subject he's asking.</p><p>"Assassins are hooded killers who hunt from the shadows. We hunt for people known as Templars. Just in case you are wondering, the Templars are the complete opposite of us Assassins. Our motive is to let anyone feel free to do anything, but the goal of the Templars are rather aggressive. They will allow anyone to do anything they want, as long as they serve their masters often. Some people are either brainwashed, controlled or even killed. That's why the Templars are at war with us." Desmond explained.</p><p>"Interesting. But I can't kill my own people. I strive to protect the village and its' occupants." Naruto boasted. Unfortunately for him, Desmond shook his head.</p><p>"I'm afraid it's time for you to stop protecting your people, Naruto." The twenty-year-old said. </p><p>"Why? I can't!" The boy pleaded. Still, Desmond won't buy it.</p><p>"No, Naruto. Enough is enough. I've seen you abused by the corrupted hands of your fellow citizens. Hell, they won't allow you to live a normal life until they killed you." He interrupted. Naruto got bummed because of it.</p><p>'<em>I think he's right. I don't think I trust everyone in the village anymore.</em>' The latter thought.</p><p>"By the way, Naruto, would you like to join the Assassin Brotherhood to get your revenge?" Desmond requested. Naruto was currently having conflicts right now. Protect his people still, or break his ties with them and kill them all. He soon made his decision and his face turned into a look of determination.</p><p>"Sure. I'll do it." Desmond smiled after hearing that.</p><p>"Good, now go to this portal and follow me." The second Desmond finished his sentence, a portal appeared on the wall next to Naruto. With a shrug, he hopped into it and popped out on the other side.</p><p>Naruto stared in awe. He ended up in a town with medieval-esque architecture, since the castles are dead giveaways. He even saw people in medieval clothing and armored soldiers holding spears shields and other weaponry.</p><p>"Welcome to Masyaf, Naruto. This is where my Assassin ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, lived." The two teleported to another location. It is the same thing, but with more advanced clothing, military, and there are now townspeople riding on horses.</p><p>"This here is Rome. This where my other ancestor, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, resided." They vanished to another place except it looked much different than the other two places. Guards are seen carrying firearms, the townspeople once again looked different and are again seen riding horses and there seemed to be blue banners with a red cross on the front and a white X at the back.</p><p>"Right here is New York Harbor back then. My ancestor Connor Kenway's a local resident here." However, instead of going into another town, the two ended up back in the cave.</p><p>"I'll let you meet the rest of my ancestors and discover their homelands at some point, Naruto. Sorry." Desmond apologized.</p><p>"It's okay. I think I'm ready to be an Assassin and turn on against my own people." Naruto said.</p><p>"Good. Hold on tight, though." Desmond demanded before he and Naruto teleport once again.</p><p>The jinchūriki is more than ready to unleash rage to his once respected village.</p><p>
