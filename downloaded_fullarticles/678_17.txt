The young Lennon boy knew he would be sorted into the house of the cunning and ambitious. </p><p> </p><p>Gryffindor on the other hand had smooth talker and charmer young Mr Paul McCartney. Now Paul also coming from a pure blood family was aware of what that meant but he didn’t care and he was now just awaiting the sorting of his younger brother. There had been no denying that the eldest of the McCartney brothers would be sorted into the house of the brave.</p><p> </p><p>Ravenclaw, the house that valued Intelligence and wit were more than happy when quiet yet witty young Mr George Harrison joined their ranks. As a muggleborn George did not know what to expect upon entering Hogwarts but he was soon settled knowing that his best friend from home was there despite being in a different house.</p><p> </p><p>Hufflepuff, The house that values loyalty and patience were also quite happy when they let funny and lovable Mr Richard Starkey into their house. Now as a half blood, Richard had the opportunity to learn about both the muggle and the magical world, but with both muggle and magical medicine at his aid that did not stop the young boy from being a sickly child, although he was persevering and making his way through life.</p><p>All four boys had met on the Hogwarts express, well with the exception of Paul and George, growing up in the same neighbourhood meant that, the McCartney family were the Harrison family’s link to the magical world.
