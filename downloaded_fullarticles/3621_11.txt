    <p>A Moment in Time</p>
<p>The Scamander Flat</p>
<p>London, England</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Picking names went much as you would expect in the Scamander household. Newt pulled out his scientific dictionary and thesaurus, while Tina was stubbornly refusing to name their daughter anything Latin or fictional. A similar battle occurred regularly between Newt and his editor: Newt was too descriptive, and no one wanted to read lists upon lists of adjectives.</p>
<p>But Newt was never a fan of nouns. Anyone and everyone was a noun. Using only a noun, Tina was just a woman, which failed to capture Newt’s feelings for his love. With adjectives she was spectacular and stunning and beautiful; this was how Newt wished to describe both his wife and their creatures. A simple noun would not do them justice.</p>
<p>But adjectives simply did not make good names. Thus, Newt was in a conundrum. They were at such a standstill that nothing was decided when Tina woke in the middle of the night, demanding that Newt take her to St. Mungo’s <strong>right this second</strong>. It was a long and tiring process, with their little girl finally arriving just as dawn was breaking through the clouds.</p>
<p>But with her first cries came a perfect noun, one that Newt could use for all of his happiest moments: when Tina said yes, when they both said I do, and now as his daughter was brought into the world.</p>
<p><em> Felicity</em>.</p>
<p>And so she was.</p>
