    <p>It was beautiful Saturday morning, the sun was shining, and there were barely any clouds. Ava and Scorpius, her dad, were outside in the garden of the Malfoy Mansion playing Quidditch. It was the first time they played ever since Lucia Malfoy Ava's mother died, the first time they played without her. It has always been Ava's biggest dream to join the quidditch team as seeker once she'd go to Hogwarts. </p><p>The two wizards had been playing for hours, to the point where they were both sweaty. Ava once again caught the Snitch before her dad even saw it. Happily, she landed with a bright smirk on her face. Her father hated playing Quidditch, but he still woke her up for practice knowing how much it meant to her.</p><p>Not long after the young blonde reached the ground, her father joined her. Scorpius laid his arm around his daughter's shoulders and smiled at her happily. </p><p>"I can't believe that you beat me again! If you keep it up like that, they might take you in during your first year at Hogwarts." </p><p>Ava happily leaned into the touch and looked up to him. "You really think so?"</p><p>"I know so. I'm proud of you, and your mother would be too." Scorpius knelt down, and Ava hugged him at the mention of her mother. They lost her a year ago. She was so sick that even magic couldn't save her. It was tough for them, but they were able to continue without her because they had each other.</p><p>"I still miss her..." Ava whispered, burying her face deeper in her father's shoulder as memories of them playing together returned in her mind. Scorpius nodded and pushed his daughter gently away to look her in the eyes.</p><p>"We'll always miss her Ava, I know exactly how you feel, but...as I told you-" </p><p>"She'll always be with us." Ava finished for him, pointing at her father's heart and mind.</p><p>Scorpius nodded and kissed his daughter's forehead before getting back on his feet. "You did a good job today, kiddo. Now we need to change, take a shower and breakfast. I have to go to work."</p><p>"Alright."  Ava sighed while putting the golden ball back into its box. "Is uncle Albus coming for breakfast today?" she asked her usual smile immediately returning. </p><p>"We'll see."</p><p>Albus Potter was Ava's godfather and like an uncle to her. By now, he was more a member of the Malfoy family then he was one of the Potters. Ava never met the other Potters, but Albus and Scorpius both said that they were all arrogant and the biggest snobs, so did her Grandfather. She remembered that once grandpa Draco noted that the only Potter he'll ever accept in their house was Albus. </p><p>Ava only knew a few things about the Potters; <br/>Harry Potter, the head of the family and famous hero, was apparently the biggest snob of all, at least that was what Albus said. The relationship between Harry and Albus apparently ended when Harry sent Albus to Hogwarts, with the belief he'll experience the best years of his life there. She knew that his father had told Albus he wouldn't care if he became a Slytherin. Still, when it actually happened, it did matter, and Albus turned into the black sheep of the family.<br/>Albus' brother James had a daughter her age and one that was older. </p><p>Her thoughts got interrupted when Albus, who was waiting in front of their door, greeted them. Ava hadn't seen him in months, so of course, she immediately ran towards him, abandoning her broomstick on the floor and welcoming him with a scream, a hug and a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>The older wizard smiled happily and ruffled her hair. "Hey kid, how was practice?" </p><p>"Great, I won, 15 times in a row." She said, looking back at her father, who picked up her broomstick and stretched out his tongue like a child.</p><p>"I see nothing changed while I was gone. Your father has never been talented in Quidditch, you got that from your mom. Did your father ever tell you that he only went to Quidditch tryouts bec-" </p><p>"Cause she was there and then she didn't even notice him? Yeah, mom told me the story." she giggled. Scorpius just chuckled and shook his head while entering Malfoy Mansion.</p><p align="center">
  <strong><br/>[...]<br/><br/></strong>
</p><p>If someone had told Ava that the same day she never would have seen them again, she would have punched this someone in the face.</p><p>Ava waited all night for her dad to come home. Still, he never did, which wasn't unusual. She knew they were both going to be there in the morning because it was her 11th birthday, and he and uncle Albus would never miss it.</p><p>But the next morning when an exited little Ava stood up and ran downstairs in the kitchen to find her presents and birthday cake together with her family she found nothing. She ran back to her room and looked at the clock, maybe she stood up earlier than usual. But it turned out to be the opposite it was already 10 am. A familiar sickening feeling started to form in her gut, but Ava pushed it down. Ava could feel her little heart beat faster. </p><p>
  <em>'Did they forget? No! They would never forget...would they?' </em>
</p><p>Ava held her tears back and went to her father's room, but nobody was in there, his Pijama were still lying on his bed just like they did the evening before.</p><p> She went to her grandfather's room, but nobody was there as well. Once she went back downstairs, she heard voices coming from outside. She recognized a voice but couldn't recall from where. Ava could barely hear anything, so the little girl opened the front door. Once done, her naked feet stepped onto something that felt like paper. But Ava was to occupied with who was standing in front of her to look what on she had stepped. </p><p>She'd never seen them in person before, just in the daily prophet and some books, but she was sure it was them. The golden trio, they were standing right in front of her porch with her grandpa. They all looked sad.</p><p>The feeling in her gut got stronger, but she still suppressed her tears and belted her hands to fists. She had never seen Draco this pale. Ava finally made a sound so that the four adults would notice her. They all turned around and looked shocked, as if Ava was a ghost. </p><p>It was when she saw the tear that streamed down Draco's face that she knew what would follow. The feeling in her gut was now eating her organs and pulling her heartstrings. Ava looked down at her feet, and it was then that she saw a big yellow envelope, her name written on it in beautiful green ink, on which she was standing.</p><p align="center">
  <strong><br/>[...]</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p><em>'This isn't how it was supposed to be.</em><em>'</em> Ava thought as her Grandfather, and she ran together through the wall between the two Platforms 9 and 10 to get onto Platform 9¾.</p><p>The thought repeated itself in her mind like a loop.</p><p>It was supposed to be different, her mother and her father were supposed to bring her here together with Albus. But nothing in her life was like it was supposed to be. Because everybody she loved except for her Grandfather was dead. Everybody left her without even saying goodbye.</p><p>Draco smiled at her sadly, caressed her cheek, and sighed. "I know this is not how you imagined it, but trust me, it's going to be great, you're a Malfoy, you're strong, and you have a good heart, don't let anybody else tell you something else." He looked past her with a grim expression as he said the last part. Ava turned around to see Harry Potter and his family with two girls.</p><p>She turned back to Draco and swallowed, trying to suppress the bad memory of Harry Potter's face.</p><p>"If they say mean things about you, they don't matter because they don't know you got it? They are just some filfth-" He stopped himself, "Just ignore them, alright?" Draco gave the small girl a quick peck on the forehead.</p><p>Ava nodded, having a last question in the back of her head. She opened her mouth to ask it, but Draco cut her off and laid a hand on her shoulder. </p><p>"I'm not like Potter over there or like my father. Scorpius, your mom, Albus, and I never cared about which house you're going to be in. You got that?" Ava smiled and hugged him a last time. "I'll miss you, Aves, the house is gonna be empty without you." Draco sighed.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>[...]</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>After walking through the entire train, Ava finally found an empty compartment. She used the Wingardium Leviosa spell to put her heavy case over the seats in the storage place. She then sat down and put the birdcage with her owl beside her. </p><p>She immediately found her Grandfather after looking out of the window, his platinum blonde hair made him unmissable. He walked in the crowd of people looking for her in every single compartment, but before she could call out for him, the train started to move. It didn't take long before she couldn't see the station anymore.</p><p>Then she heard a knock and a boy with black hair and glasses stood in the doorway.</p><p>He smiled at her shyly. "Hi ehm...my name is Gary, I was wondering if-" Ava cut him off by taking his case and put in the middle of the room.<br/>He smiled in relief and followed her, closing the doors behind him. Ava used once again the Levitation Charm to put the boy's case in the storage place. She sat back down next to her owl and smiled at him. </p><p>"My name is Ava Malfoy." </p><p>"Gary Green" He quickly responded with an impressed voice.</p><p>"You can already do some spells?" he asked, surprised.</p><p>"Yeah, but just that one, my Grandfather taught it to me, so I don't have to lift the heavy case. Can you do a spell?" The boy seemed uncomfortable and blushed while shaking his head. "Are you parents muggles?" She asked her voice full of curiosity, Gary seemed confused by the question.</p><p>"Muggles?" </p><p>"People without Magic." Ava explained, now already knowing the answer. </p><p>"Yes, is that bad?" He asked, even more confused. "I mean, isn't that normal?" He seemed upset.</p><p>"No! Normally, a lot of students are muggle-born. I was just curious," she quickly exclaimed, not wanting to hurt his feelings. </p><p>Gary seemed to relax again. "You can't imagine how nervous I am. I don't know much about this world, and my parents thought it was all just a prank until the instructor came to explain the situation, and he showed us magic."</p><p>Ava chuckled at the thought of muggles seeing magic for the first time. "I would have loved to see that."</p><p>"So you're parents are wizards ?" He asked, excited to finally being able to talk about it with someone. The question hit hard, which Gary realized quickly since Ava's face seemed like he just slapped her.</p><p>"They were." It was barely a whisper. Gary wanted to slap himself as he saw how the girl's' eyes started filling with tears. He quickly jumped up and sat beside Ava, grabbing her hand, trying to comfort her. "I'm sorry." Ava just shook her eyes and wiped her eyes, trying to contain herself. "It's just- it happened a month ago." she whispered, and then she looked at Gary beside her. He seemed so concerned about her, which surprised the young blonde, she didn't really expect to make friends at Hogwarts, after all, she was a Malfoy.</p><p>"I know how you feel my mom died too." It was said that it sort of comforted Ava, to know that she wasn't alone.</p><p>"I'm sorry for your mom." Ava whispered. For a second, everything was quiet until Ava took all the courage that she could find in herself and extended her had to the black-haired boy. "Friends ?" Her heart was beating like crazy, but before she knew it, Gary smiled and accepted the handshake.</p><p>After 30 minutes, Ava was sure that Gary and her were soulmates or something because they had the exact same muggle interests. Ava was born a witch, but she was always interested in muggle stuff. She loved movies, tv shows, comics, and books. Until now, she had nobody to talk about it, but Gary was, as he called it, "A huge Nerd" and so they started talking about their favorites. Ava asked a lot of questions about muggles and football while Gary wanted to know everything about Quidditch and wizards.</p><p>They had reached the point when Ava wanted to explain Gary how the four house system of Hogwarts worked, but they were interrupted. A beautiful, blonde, and familiar-looking girl entered their compartment, she seemed stressed and angry.</p><p>"Hey, can I sit here? Apparently, everybody in this train is an ass, especially my sister." Ava wanted to answer and opened her mouth. Still, the blonde already closed the compartment doors, sat down in front of them, closing her eyes, and sighing in relief.</p><p>"Thank you so much."</p><p>Ava didn't answer, still trying to figure out where she knew the girl from. So Gary was the first one to speak up. "I'm Gary, and this is Ava." By the mention of Ava's name Sara opened her eyes and eyed the older blond for the first time. And she was much more beautiful than on the picture.</p><p>"I know who you're." She said, smiling sadly. "Ava Malfoy, my uncle Albus had a picture of you in his wallet."</p><p>Now Ava knew, she saw her messy blonde hair before at the station somewhere behind Harry Potter, and she knew the face from uncle Albus' wallet. At the memory of uncle Albus, she felt sad, so she only got a few words out. "He had one of you too."</p><p>Gary seemed confused, but he understood that whoever Uncle Albus was, he passed. So Gary just kept sitting there in silence, looking at the exchange between his newly acquired friend and the stranger.</p><p>Then a look of judgment came over Sara's eyes. "You weren't at his funeral." </p><p>That comment started a fire in Ava's eyes. "Yeah, 'cause you're family are a bunch of big buttholes."</p><p>Sara, to Ava's surprise, chuckled at that one. "Tell me something I don't know." </p><p>"They made his funeral at the same time in a completely different place as the one of my dad, so we couldn't go."</p><p>Sara's smile fell at that one, and she looked seriously hurt, remembering that her grandpa changed the date last minute. "You're kidding, right?" But Sara knew the other girl wasn't.</p><p>Ava just shook her head, looking out of the window, trying to suppress her tears again. That was the moment in which Gary finally jumped back into the conversation.  "What was your name again?" </p><p>"Sara." She answered Gary and looked at him as if she just acknowledged his existence. </p><p>Gary quickly stood up and looked down at her. "Yeah, Sara, great..." Sara heard the sarcasm in his voice and stood up and looked him in the eyes as if she wanted to murder him. It scared Gary because she was taller than him, but he still crossed his arms and remained where he was. "It was really nice to meet you, but I think you should go." Sara seemed surprised by that, but after sending a last death stare, she just went out. </p><p>Ava looked up to him and smiled sadly, whispering a "Thank you."<br/>And in that moment she knew, Gary was a keeper.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>[...]</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>When they finally arrived at Hogwarts Ava and Gary had already changed into there robes. During the rest of the ride, Ava told Gary about Hogwarts and the house's, and he decided that he wanted to be in Slytherin just because Ava wanted to be in there. She told him about her family's history and the Potter's and the time of Voldemort, but Gary said that she wasn't a part of that time, so it wasn't her fault. Gary was the sweetest person Ava met in her entire life. The blonde swore to herself to never let him go, to never lose him. It seemed ridiculous, she knew him for barley 8 hours, but she already felt like he was the brother she never had.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>[...]</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>When Ava entered the Great Hall together with the rest of the first-year students, she was surprised to found herself stunned by the view. It was way bigger then she expected. Gary beside her looked with open mouth at the sky, and Ava grinned. She already saw it all in Books her mother had shown her, but it was still spectacular to see in reality. Ava quickly glanced over to Sara but immediately looked away, noticing Sara was starring at her as well. The group was brought to the front of the teachers' table. Where a chair was put, on it the magic hat. Professor Hunter, the new principal of Hogwarts, quickly explained the sorting system before the first kids were called up.</p><p>Ava didn't really pay attention until. "Green Garry?" Ava gave him a reassuring smile before he stumbled towards the chair. It was clear that is was really nervous, but instead of panicking, the raven-haired boy took a deep breath before sitting down. </p><p>The hat barely touched Gary's head before screaming. "HUFFLEPUFF!" Gary stood up, and unsurely looked back to Ava, who was still smiling and applauding with everyone else. Of course, it would have been way more awesome to be in the same house as Gary, but it wasn't that important as long as they stayed friends.</p><p>A few more kids Ava didn't know the family names from were called up.<br/>Then, "Iceheat Leonard!" Ava recognized that name. His grandparents were death eaters, and in the same school year as Draco, only were their crimes far worse than the ones her grandfather committed. Ava knew that they had given birth to Leonard's father in Azkaban and that he returned there, leaving his three children alone with his mother.</p><p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p><p>"Iceheat Mick!" Was what Ava thought could only be his twin brother, though they didn't look anything alike.</p><p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p><p>"Longbottom Kara!" Another familiar name. </p><p>"GRYFFINDOR!"</p><p>"Longbottom Winn!"</p><p><br/>"RAVENCLAW!"</p><p>"Luthor Lena?" Another death eater family. Ava didn't know how they could have possibly had another child. Lionel Luthor had a son that was her father's age. But he had been locked up in Azkaban for crazy experiments that led to a loth of muggle deaths right after he graduated. The young Malfoy observed how a slim looking girl with dark brown hair and green eyes quickly walked up and sat down on the chair. The whispers in the room didn't go unnoticed. </p><p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p><p>"Malfoy Ava!" Unsurprisingly the room went silent. Everyone In her life had prepared her for this moment, she knew what they thought about her family, she knew the judgment that came with the Malfoy name. But she wasn't ashamed, it was her father's name, and her father did good things. With a confident smile, Ava went forward and sat down on the wooden chair. Once the hat was placed, the young girl expected it to scream '<em>SLYTHERIN</em>' immediately, but it didn't. Instead, she heard his voice in her head.</p><p>"Well, another Malfoy, huh?" Ava hated his voice; it was high scratchy and too loud. "You're not like the rest of your family...not like your father..." He said it like a snarky remark. </p><p>"I am!" Ava exclaimed aloud, and the hall giggled in surprise. Ava huffed. <em>'Just put me in Slytherin, and let's get over with this.' </em></p><p>"I think I can't do that." The voice continued. </p><p>That sentence alone made Ava panic. <em>'Please put me in Slytherin.'</em> She prayed over and over again, closing her eyes, not caring that everybody else was watching her. She couldn't be the first Malfoy that wasn't a Slytherin, she didn't want to be.</p><p>"I'm sorry little Malfoy, but you definitively don't have the qualities for a Slytherin. Of course, you're smart but definitely not cunning. Your most visible traits are loyalty and bravery. You lost your parents..."</p><p>The picture of a past dream with their dead bodies flashed before her. "After your father's death, you took care of your grandfather when it should have been the other way around. Even you wanting to be a Slytherin proves loyalty for your family."</p><p>The picture of Draco's depression flickered somewhere behind a usual closed door in the back of her head. Ava was about to let out a tear, but she put it together, the whole school was watching and whispering about why it took so long.</p><p>The hat's voice changed from smug to soft, also being able to feel the girl's emotions. <em>'You see that I'm right, don't you?'</em> Ava shook her head, but the hat sighed before finally exclaiming. "GRYFFINDOR !" </p><p>When Ava stood up, her vision was blurry, with shaking legs and hands turned into fists, the room became completely silent, and she slowly walked towards the Gryffindor table.</p><p>Suddenly the tall blonde girl, which she remembered, was put in Gryffindor before, stood up, and started clapping like it was usually done after each sorted student. Slowly few people began to clap with her, and soon, the awkwardness of the situation was quickly overlooked as another kid was called up. Ava sat down next to the blonde and gave her a quick thankful smile.</p><p>She smiled back and extended her hand. "Kara Zoe Longbottom" </p><p>"Ava" She whispered quietly, gladly accepting the other girl's hand.<br/>As the next first year was called up, Ava turned back to Kara. "Why did you do that back there? Stood up for me, I mean." </p><p>Kara didn't lose her smile and shrugged. "My grandmother said that we have to do what we think is right and don't give a damn about other people's judgment."</p><p>Ava nodded and couldn't help but smile a bit before another voice next to them spoke up. "If I recall it correctly, our grandmother didn't have a social life when she went to this school." For some reason, he pronounced 'our' weirdly. Ava could see that it was intended to hurt Kara since the other's girl smile seemed to become more forced. Ava turned to the left and looked at an even taller girl with short red-dyed hair, sitting two seats next to her.</p><p>"Social life is overrated." Ava managed to croak out. </p><p>"Of course, a Malfoy would say that." a boy sitting in front o her chuckled. Ava ignored him and tried to focus on the rest of the sorting ceremony again.</p><p>"That's my adoptive sister, Alex, she is really annoying." Kara explained quietly. "You looked sad when you came into Gryffindor in which ho-" </p><p>Kara got cut off by her sister once again. "Merlin! Kara, she's a Malfoy she wanted to be in Slytherin like the rest of her evil family not everybody in this world is good!" A few Gryffindors who were listening to the conversation giggled. But stopped as soon as they saw Ava's face.</p><p>Ava looked furious as soon as the older girl mentioned her family. "What did you just say about my family?" she growled quietly.</p><p>Now another Gryffindor joined in. "She said your family is evil, and she is right." And unlike her sister Ava recognized her right away, Lauren Potter. She didn't care, she wanted to stand up and beat them both, but a firm grip held her wrist.</p><p>She looked up, and of course, it was Kara. "You don't seem evil to me, just ignore them." </p><p>"I don't-" </p><p>Before Ava could finish, Kara just shook her head and let go of her wrist. "Show them they're wrong." It was barely whispered, and Ava realized Kara was right. She wasn't evil, and Draco said the same thing. "Don't become what they make you out to be." Ava looked at Kara and then at the other students, now she noticed that the whole table was looking at her. Everybody was expecting her to do something terrible, everybody was waiting for her to lash out. She sat back down next to the blonde and mumbled a thank you once again.</p><p>"Palmer Ray?"</p><p>"HUFFLEPUFF!"</p><p>And then finally, the name the young Malfoy had been secretly waiting for all this time was called up. Ava didn't know what it was about her, maybe the connection to Albus or perhaps the way she spoke about her own family that fascinated her about the other blonde. </p><p>"Potter Sara!" </p><p>Everybody looked at Sara, she could hear a few Gryffindors whisper something about two potters. Sara just rolled her eyes, and confidently walked to the chair, she sat down, and the hat was put on her head. It didn't take long, barley a second actually, but it surely wasn't what everyone expected. </p><p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p><p>The whispering started immediately, and Ava noticed the smirk on Sara's face and who she was looking at, her sister, who actually seemed relieved.</p><p>The teacher reading out the names tried to calm the crowd down by calling up the last name on her list.  "Queen Thea!" The tall boy sitting in front of her that just a few minutes ago made a comment about the Malfoys, stood up to get a better look. He was probably her brother. Unlike Laurel, he seemed to care about his sister and already smiled proudly as the small brunette sat down. </p><p>"SLYTHERIN!" </p><p>While the girl seemed fine with the choice made, her brother seemed surprised and angry as he watched her walk to the Slytherin table. He was quickly pulled back down by the older Potter girl.</p><p>Principal Hunter started his speech, and not long after, food and water appeared on the table. Ava and Kara began to talk, they kept passing each other different food they tried. It made Ava hope that maybe being in Gryffindor wouldn't be so bad after all. Of course, that hope had do be shattered right away by Laurel. "Two Orphans found each other." </p><p>As much as Ava wanted to stand up and punch the older girl in the face, she knew it wouldn't be of any use. She repeated Kara's words over and over again in her head to calm down. <em>'Show them they are wrong. Show them they are wrong. Show them they are wro-'</em><br/>When she looked at Kara, she noticed her eyes were closed, and she kept mumbling something that didn't seem to be English. The smaller blonde noticed how Kara was crunching something in her hand, and as she dropped it, Ava couldn't believe that that something was a fork.</p><p>"Awww look sunshine is getting mad." Laurel giggled.</p><p>"Will you stop it!?" Ava hissed angrily and took Kara's hand and whispered. "You told me a few seconds ago not to listen, remember?" She had no idea how an eleven-year-old was able to crush a fork without even getting some sort of wound on her hand. But she was quite sure that wouldn't be good for Kara if anybody knew.</p><p>Her adoptive sister finally noticed what was happening. As the mean girl was about to make another nasty comment, Alex snapped. "Give it a rest Laurel!" </p><p>Ava was about to comfort Kara again when the other girl suddenly opened her eyes and looked panicking at Ava. "I don't think I can hold it back for longer." She whispered it so quietly that even Ava had trouble understanding her over the noise in the hall. </p><p>She had no idea what Kara meant, but she knew it couldn't possibly be good since the girl just crushed a fork like it was a piece of paper. 'Maybe she's cursed or something...' She didn't hesitate and grabbed the other girls arm. They stood up, and Ava pulled her out of the Great Hall towards where she believed the girls' bathroom was. She pushed the now trembling Kara into the next best door and locked it behind them.</p><p>Kara ran to the window, but before she could open it, her eyes started to glow, and she screamed in rage while something that seemed like sunrays shuttered the glass. Ava, who was about to walk towards her, now stumble back in surprise. Worriedly she at Kara, who now was sitting exhausted on the floor and started crying.</p><p>Slowly Ava walked towards her, not knowing how to handle the situation. "What- what just happen-" She got interrupted by someone knocking at the door "KARA?! Are you in there?!" It was Alex. Ava didn't think about what she was doing, she just did it. </p><p>The blonde made a noise that resembled somewhat of a fake sob and screamed at the door. "Leave me alone, your stupid sister isn't here!" She held her breath and heard how Alex ran away.</p><p>"I didn't mean that stupid part." She quickly whispered, and that somehow made Kara smile.</p><p>"You're not scared?" </p><p>Ava frowned. "Not really, I mean freaked out? Sure! But yo- you don't seem evil to me." She repeated the same words as Kara. "Are you cursed?"</p><p>Kara let out a little smile and shook her head. She seemed unsure what to say next, so Ava tried to reassure her. "I won't tell anyone, you don't need to tell me if you don't want to, I'll keep it a secret."</p><p>"You won't tell anybody, promise?"</p><p>"Promise."</p><p>Kara took a deep breath before talking. "I'm-" another deep breath. "My name is Kara Zo-El, and I'm- I'm not from Earth, I'm from Krypton, which is- was another planet."</p><p>Ava didn't know how to reply to that. On the one hand, Kara just told her she was an Alien, and Ava had so many questions. But on the other, she didn't only lose her parents, she lost her entire planet.</p><p>"Are you scared now?"</p><p>"No, I- I just didn't expect that...does your adoptive family know?" </p><p>"Yes, they told me so many times not to tell anyone, and the first thing I did is-" </p><p>"I promise you I will never tell anyone, not even if they torture me."<br/> <br/>And while the others were eating in the Great Hall, Ava had found her other best friend.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>[...]</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>After knowing she already had two friends, Ava thought that Hogwarts for her wouldn't be like Hogwarts was for her father. But Laurel Potter made sure that it would be worse. She was what Ava had always feared coming to hogwarts, the reason she wanted to be a Slytherin. </p><p>At first, she seemed just annoying to Ava because everything started with stupid comments or snarky remarks, which Ava managed to ignore. But with every day, the nasty comments and snarky remarks became heavier. It didn't take long, and Laurel and her friends started to curse her books or any other stuff with stupid prank spells. Then her stuff disappeared, and another day her owl was pink, much to his dislike.</p><p>They waited for her after some classes, they waited for her to be alone to take her aside to talk to her or try out new spells they learned.<br/>Ava wanted to defend herself, but then Laurel threatened her friends Kara and Gary, to make their lives living hell, too.</p><p>Kara could probably defend herself, hell she perhaps could have protected the three of them, but there was the risk of exposing her secret. Which Ava would never let happen. After some time, Ava got used to Laurel, it was a part of her daily routine.</p>
