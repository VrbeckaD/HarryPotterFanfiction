    <p>"Now child, what does this rune mean?"</p><p>"I do not know sir, I have never seen it before and can't find it in the textbook."</p><p>"Dismissed."</p><p>The professor sighed and went in search of his partner. Eventually he remembered on Friday mornings they took first year potions for Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. As he descended to the dungeons he thought again about the clever little bits of design the founders had built in. Helga was the one to highlight the perfect use for the basements as potions classes apparently, something to do with a non magical buffer allowing for proper temperatures. As he approached the door he heard his wife's voice.</p><p>"Class, as you may notice one ingredient on the potion that you found most interesting in your textbook is highlighted. Next lesson you will present to the class a presentation on everything that is required, to be able to understand that ingredient in terms of your potions purpose, and how to use that ingredient correctly, including common mistakes. The best presenter will decide which potion we make before the Christmas break. I am also going to set you a second piece of homework, you will each write to 3 people outside of Hogwarts by Monday's lesson, I have a feeling some of you may not have been showing proper regard for your friends from home as this school has you overwhelmed. Also now that we have all had our first flying lessons I will be on the quiditch pitch this Saturday with a dozen quaffles, if anyone would like to join me." He heard her sit down and the students start to rise and entered the classroom.</p><p>"Ah hello my mighty wombat, how goes the hunt?"</p><p>"Disastrous my darling," He sat down and reached for a plate of biscuits that somehow was always full on the desk. (It's almost like a Hufflepuff may have befriended the house elves.) "I really thought that the Longbottom boy may have had a similar skill to his dads herbology. I may even have to try and recruit from abroad at this rate. Luna doesn't have any ideas, does she, dear?"</p><p>She looked up at him and then back down at the parchment in her hands. "No dear, I spoke to her in the fire last night and she doesn't know anyone else who could help, she did say she would come and help but she heard from Charlie Weasley and is now off to Romania for february."</p><p>"Bollocks."</p><p>"She did say that she is having a copy of Wand Lore and Law printed for us to borrow. She can't let us keep it unfortunately due to the terms of Ollivander's will."</p><p>"And how is the cauldron doing? Has the unicorn hair disintegrated yet? How did Luna's trip to St Mungo's go for the other half?"</p><p>His wife looked up at him with that look of love and impatience. "OK, Nearly, and she thinks it's nearly enough the water is starting to colour."</p><p>As may be obvious our champion in this endeavour was getting a little excited and nearly bouncing on his feet. Professor Estrid Johnson looked at a box in the corner, giving her partner the hint to take Page for a walk through the orchards. Estrid however, went back to the Sudoku in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>****************************************************************</p><p> </p><p>We next find Professor Samuel Johnson going through a letter from Luna.</p><p> </p><p>****************************************************************</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Hey Sam,</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>How are you and Estrid? Did the diadem help? Estrid did say there had been lots of trouble with wrackspurts and fuzzy thinking when they offered you the job. So I have been travelling a lot and thought you both may be able to help whilst at Hogwarts. I need a potion brewing and a unicorn hair exposing to the purest joy, so I was thinking, could you take it to the first years flying lessons and to quiditch matches for me? Estrid is going to purify the water for me and then dissolve the unicorn hair in it. From what I can see of the notes Olivander had in the back of the shop the healing power of the unicorn should if soaked and prepared correctly can counterbalance the temperamental nature you normal get with thestral core wands. I did try and get hold of a Heliopath's spit to help prepare the wand wood too but they seem to have gone into hiding after escaping from Fudge. My other issue is which wood to use? I originally thought that the perfect healer's wand would need elm to help guide the healers hands and prevent errors, but the arrogance you tend to find in people suited to elm would never do. They would never understand healing is there to improve life and not prolong it, it's why I picked the thestral core you know, it will never accept someone who is scared of death or thinks it is the opponent. If you see Harry ask him if he thinks this had anything to do with that wand and Voldemort please. Hawthorn is known to be a good healer but would a calm bedside manner work with it? There are far too many grumpy healers, I think it may be the infirtroo's you get in hospitals nibbling on them when it's quiet. Hawthorn may help to make sure the wand would go to someone capable of the work. Willow is another possibility as it may help to find an adaptable healer. Your mum's saying about an apple a day also rings true, and these wands and pear come so that both may help to keep to the darker bits occasionally necessary from taking over. I think leaving it with Page maybe a good idea, she is bound to have some ideas. Can you also ask Winky could get me the cinnamon pear cake recipe that I liked so much at Hogwarts. Next time I see you remind me to talk about druids, I found some great notes in a little village near Erquy.</em>

  <em>Much love but I am going to have to leave it there, it's going dark and muggles make such a fuss if they see me diving skyclad.</em>
