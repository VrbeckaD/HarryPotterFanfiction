  <b>The Battle of Azkaban</b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="left">
  <em> August 15, 1997 </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was a particularly cold morning for August. Mist had formed, and the early morning dew gave everything a wet sheen. A cool western breeze dispersed some of the salty odor in the town of Montrose. Among the ships docked in the town port, there was one ship docked at the edge of the port that towered over the rest, more than twice the size of the average fishing trawler. It was this ship that the man was approaching. He was a tall man with dark skin and a broad, sturdy frame. He wore dark purple robes and a brand new golden earring in his right ear. Thick clouds covered most of the summer sun, yet on a day such as this, Kingsley Shacklebolt was grateful for however much sunshine there was.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the side of the steamboat, the name <em>Sharon </em> was written in faded paint. Despite the fact that it was a steamboat, a wooden figurehead was strapped to the bow. Specifically, it was a gargoyle, which was humming an ominous tune under its breath. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Morning, minister,” the gargoyle croaked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Good morning, Edwin,” said Kingsley in his usual deep voice. “You had best lower your singing today. There will be many more coming soon.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Right you are sir.” None of the passerbys seemed to notice this curious exchange as they walked past, sparing not without so much as a sideways glance. Kingsley climbed up the walkway onto the <em> Sharon </em>. Despite its size, its crew consisted of only two members. It was not a position that many applied for. Most of the time, it was appointed forcefully as a form of  unofficial sentence within the Ministry of Magic. The man on the deck was one such soul. He seemed to have shrunk since Kingsley had last seen him a year ago. His hair had become far thinner and grayer, and the bowler hat he usually wore had become frayed and torn at the seams. He was mopping the deck when Kingsley approached and looked up with a start.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh! Hello, Minister,” said Cornelius Fudge, sweating. “You’re here rather early.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I hope that will not be any trouble, Vice-Warden Fudge. The others will be arriving shortly.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“N-no, of course not. I finished setting up the chairs a few minutes ago. Just come find me when we are ready to depart. I shall be, ahh, here.” Fudge glanced furtively behind Kingsley, almost as if another figure might emerge onto the ship and talk to him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Where is the Warden now?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He is in his cabin. He told me I should make myself useful here. I imagine he’s listening to his records and drinking firewhiskey, as he always does...” The last few words were more a murmur. Fudge gave a weak smile. “You can check the hall for yourself and see if it is too your liking. Best of luck, King- er, Minister.” He dropped his head dejectedly and continued to mop the grimy deck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you, Fudge.” Kingsley nodded and walked off. When the Ministry had fallen under Voldemort around a year ago, Fudge had managed to survive by staying under the radar. He had been assigned as Vice-Warden to Azkaban after the last Vice-Warden had run off to join a gang of Snatchers. Kingsley had never been an admirer of Fudge, but he could not help feeling a twinge of pity at the husk of a man Fudge had become after only a few months of his miserable position. It was small wonder that the Warden had become as reclusive as he had.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kingsley walked down a set of stairs and through a tall set of doors. He entered into a room that resembled an auditorium, big enough and with enough chairs to host almost a hundred people. The room was usually smaller, but a strong Engorgement Charm had been cast on it for the occasion. Its original purpose was a holding cell to house prisoners bound for Azkaban, but recently it had been reassigned as the conference room for those involved in today’s operation. The previous chain-linked seats had been placed in the cargo hold and replaced with folding chairs. At the front was a small platform on which stood a wooden podium. He waved his wand and Summoned an armchair and sat, waiting for the others to arrive. A clock at the back ticked away the seconds. The ship barely rocked among the waves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It had been a tumultuous past few months since the Battle of Hogwarts. So many things had to be taken care of and new legislations formed. Rare were moments like this where Kingsley had time to collect himself for a short while. Yet he was far from ungrateful, for his weariness indicated that much good work had been accomplished. It was something Dumbledore had told him once long ago. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A quarter of an hour passed until the doors opened again, and Arthur Weasley walked in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Minister! I had a feeling you would be coming in early,” said Arthur cheerily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I didn’t feel like waiting in my office,” replied Kingsley lightly. He had a deep, soothing voice that gave a quiet confidence to those that heard it. It was one of the reasons he had performed so well in his duties. “It still feels foreign to me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But surely you’ve gotten used to it a little by now, after what, three months now?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I was only acting Minister for most of it. There were no certainties that I would hold my title after the election last month.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, come now Kingsley. We all knew you would hold your position. We never had a doubt you would become Minister. George said that it’s in your name, after all. I assume that’s an inside joke?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Indeed,” laughed Kingsley. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, I called you by your name, didn’t I? Old habit. I’ll make sure not to do that in front of others.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I do not mind, but I imagine my staff would not approve. Fawley says that appearances are important.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ll make sure to keep that in mind. Molly is helping Fleur take care of Victoire, and the others will be here shortly. I wanted to arrive a little early to wish you good luck, Minister. Today is going to be a momentous day for wizarding history.” He held out his hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you, Arthur. I hope it will be as well.” He shook his hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the course of the next hour, numerous people filtered into the room. First came his new Junior Assistant to the Minister of Magic Audrey Fawley, a young woman with sharp eyes wearing butterfly frame glasses. She had worked as a secretary for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement since graduating from Hogwarts, and Kingsley had been impressed by her organizational skills for a while. After Percy Weasley had stepped down from his position, he had decided to give her a chance. She had proven herself to be quite capable and organized these last three months, especially when working independently from him. She had helped salvage him spare hours during his busy schedule to figure out the intricacies for this operation, including having an official meeting with the Warden of Azkaban. Though the final plan was quite simple and she had no obligation to do so, she had insisted on coming and making sure everything went smoothly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next came the Aurors assigned to this operation. A few Aurors had been convicted of having used an Unforgivable Curse on Muggles. He had known them for years, and he had felt no joy in snapping their wands. However, due to the current state of Azkaban, he had confined them to Nurmengard, which was now empty after the confirmed death of Grindelwald. Along with them were Death Eaters that had been detained during the Battle of Hogwarts such as Fenrir Greyback, bands of Snatchers, and other Ministry officials convicted of corruption such as Dolores Umbridge, whom he admittedly felt no guilt in snapping her wand and imprisoning in a cold cell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then at last came the remnants of the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore’s Army, who all greeted him warmly and he in turn. The Weasleys lead the group: Bill, Charlie, Percy, and George.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Like the new earring, Minister,” called out George. “We should get matching ear rings- we can save money and get one for each of us.” He tapped the stump around his left ear. The Sectumsempra curse had healed over well, leaving a hook-shaped scar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I highly doubt mum would approve,” said Percy dryly. George gave a quick wink to Kingsley and followed his brother, who was trying to catch the eye of Fawley with a wave, who gave a curt wave of acknowledgment back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then Luna Lovegood with his friends Ginny Weasley and Neville Longbottom, who had a small scar running along the left side of his head made from the Battle of Hogwarts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hello there, Minister,” said Luna breezily. “Did you read my article on how to detect Wrackspurts that was published yesterday in <em> The Quibbler </em>?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kingsley shook his head. “I am afraid not. I’ll make sure to purchase an issue tomorrow.” Before Luna could respond, Neville pulled her along by her arm while giving him an apologetic smile, saying, “Sorry Minister. We’ll find our seats soon.” Ginny giggled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, next to Ginny, who had recently turned seventeen, was the trio to whom Kingsley and the entire wizarding community owed everything: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, the two wizards and one witch who had been instrumental in the defeat of Voldemort for good this time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kingsley bowed his head as they approached. “Harry. Ron. Hermione. I trust you have all been well.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You really don’t need to do that every time you see us, Minister,” said Hermione, blushing red. “It makes people stare.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t mind it, personally,” confessed Ron. “Still feels kind of nice getting free respect from the Minister of Magic.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione jabbed him in the ribs with her elbow, making Ron wince. “Ow- alright, I won’t.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“After all the Ministry has done to hinder you three, not even a decade of bowing would be enough. It is important that the Minister of Magic is a guiding example to the Ministry for reformation,” replied Kingsley, his head still bowed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Uncomfortable truths are too easy to forget, especially when they were once deemed acceptable.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Please, Minister. You’ve been Minister for a month, and I already like you better than the last three,” said Harry. “After a coward, a hypocrite, and a puppet, you’re great, frankly. I don’t imagine your staff appreciate the bowing, though. Makes the Ministry look… submissive.” He glanced at them quickly. Fawley was giving an irked look.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kingsley couldn’t help but chuckle. “Thank you, Harry. I will do my best to make sure I stay that way,” he said, raising his head. “Has Robards been harsh on you three?” He gestured to Neville who was taking his seat next to Luna and Hannah Abbott.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No harder than usual,” replied Harry. “He’s kept us all busy enough these past few weeks, that’s for sure. Neville did mention the stress was starting to pile on.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Has to keep up appearances. Can’t go easy on three brats who skipped Auror training. Wouldn’t be fair. At least, that’s what he says to us right before piling us with work and making us write up reports,” muttered Ron. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts, Kingsley had declared Harry, Ron, and Neville as Aurors, though he did tell them in private that they would receive training in the coming years, which the three accepted after some discussion. As for Hermione, she had decided to take another year of studying at Hogwarts to finish her N.E.W.T.s, or Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests, which she had not been able to do this past year on account of their mission from Dumbledore. He wondered briefly why they Wizarding community had chosen to keep Nastily in the name all this time. Kingsley had even consulted her once about the spell he had been crafting for today along with Professor Flitwick in recognition of her abundant knowledge. He had also been lucky enough to one of the few people to hear the entire story about their mission one hot summer afternoon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trailing behind them was Lee Jordan, a friend of George and the late Fred Weasley, who shook his hand warmly. “Did you like my letter, Royal?” he whispered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I did. River,” he replied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His mind briefly flashed back to last week when he had received a letter from Lee, which said, “I kept my promise, Royal. -River.” Inside was a photograph of Lee and Fred holding ballots that had the name “Kingsley Shaklebolt” ticked. Just like they had promised a few months ago on their underground radio program Potterwatch. Kingsley had framed the letter in his office.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last to arrive was Hagrid, one of the few individuals in the room who was taller than him. “Alright there, Minister?” he said, clapping him on the back. Impressively, Kingsley managed to not make his knees buckle, a no small feat. “Sorry for the delay. Left Grawp in charge of  gamekeepin.’ I parked the bike on the deck.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’ll want to take your seat soon. It’s the big chair near the back. It’s almost time to begin. Fawley is stringent about staying on time.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“‘Course, ‘course. Wouldn’t miss this fer the world,” murmured Hagrid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kingsley went back to the deck and called to Fudge. “Everyone has arrived, Vice-Warden. Can you take me to fetch the Warden?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Right this way,” Fudge said, his bowler hat slipping to the side and revealing a bald patch. George snickered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They walked down another set of stairs and walked down a hallway, stopping in front a door with a simple wooden engraving titled “Warden.” Inside, the sound of slow, classical music was playing. Fudge knocked on the door. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Warden Bulstrode? We’re ready to depart, sir.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The sound of a record stopping was heard. Then the door opened slowly with a groan. The Warden rose from his armchair and stepped out. Roscoe Bulstrode was a man that gave the air that he was perpetually brooding due in no small part to the numerous wrinkles on his face. Black bags were engraved under his bleak, grey eyes, formed after decades of working with Dementors. His salt and pepper hair was cut razor short as if it to prevent them from becoming dishevelled. He wore dark marine robes and an officer’s hat that had a symbol with the letter “A” behind a coin: the emblem of Azkaban.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hello Minister,” he said in a dry voice that indicated it was not used to talking to humans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hello, Warden. We have all gathered at the hall.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hmph. It seems you are adamant to go through with this then, despite my warnings.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes. I am,” said Kingsley with a look of resolve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So be it. I shall be the guide to your doom then. Vice-Warden!” Bulstrode barked. “Pull up the anchor. We depart for Azkaban.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, Warden,” sighed Fudge as he trudged off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fudge’s footsteps faded. Kingsley said, “You did not forget your promise? To give everyone a chance to hear for themselves what you have told me?”</p>
<p>“A promise sworn to the Minister of Magic must be kept, regardless of my own disposition,” muttered Bulstrode. “I will disclose my warning to all those gathered. It will drive away the weak-hearted at least.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You give the witches and wizards of our time too little credit. They have fought against the forces of Voldermort and prevailed. They are not weak.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The warden gave a groan at the sound of the name of Voldemort then shook his head. “We shall see.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Kingsley returned to the conference room and Bulstrode trudged to the bridge, Fudge busied himself, waving his wand in different directions, making the gangway fold in on itself, the ropes loosen, and the anchor to rise. When Bulstrode reached the bridge, he tapped on specific points on the wooden steering wheel with his wand. With a final tap to the center of the wheel, the <em> Sharon </em> set off into the open sea, scarcely making a scuffle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bulstrode waved his wand over the steering wheel, and the wheel turned on its own, ensuring that the course was set. He turned to Fudge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ring the bell when we near the island,” ordered Bulstrode to Fudge. “Keep on the lookout for Dementors. They don’t listen to any man anymore. If you can see its hands, it’s too late.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, Warden…” Fudge stood next to the wheel, gazing out at the sea through the murky window.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Grunting, Bulstrode trudged to the room and sat in a seat reserved for him in the front row. A few eyes glanced at him with looks of caution or curiosity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was Fawley’s cue to call for silence as she announced the Minister of Magic. A round of applause echoed across the room as Kingsley took to the podium.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you all for coming,” Kingsley began. “Our operation requires as much help as we can afford from wizards and witches experienced at fighting the Dark Arts.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His voice took on a more somber tone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“For too long, the wizarding community has relied on Dementors to contain those that we have deemed necessary to imprison, on faceless apparitions that have no conscience. We have allowed them to remove the souls of those we have branded as wrongdoers, to live out the remainder of their lives as husks devoid of what gives life meaning. At its inception, I am sure previous Ministers thought such an alliance with the forces of darkness were necessary, yet as the Second Wizarding War has shown us, the Dementors are loyal only to their own desires and those that would aid in procuring them. They permitted the escape of many Death Eaters. They have tortured both wizards and Muggles alike. So today, after much discussion with both my staff and Warden Bulstrode of Azkaban, I am truly grateful that my first decree as Minister of Magic will be enacted: to banish each and every Dementor remaining on Azkaban.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A round of applause ensued with cheers, including a loud shout from Hagrid, “Its about time!” Kingsley paused for the noise to die down before he continued.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This task will prove difficult, however, as the latest report from Warden Bulstrode has confirmed that Dementors that disappeared after the Battle of Hogwarts have returned to their old posts and banded together, refusing to leave Azkaban. It seems that after centuries of habitation, they are unwilling to leave the island they have designated as their ‘nest.’ Thankfully, before the Dementors declared their revolt, the Muggles and innocents confined have been released, meaning that the prison is empty of any humans. Therefore, our objective is to secure the fortress and drive out the Dementors permanently, such that they will not return. Before I explain our plan, after his insistence, I have agreed that a final warning is necessary. Thus, I would like to introduce the man who knows more about Azkaban than any other, the Warden of Azkaban, Roscoe Bulstrode.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A scatter of unenthusiastic applause was mixed with one or two whispers of “There’s a warden for Azkaban?” “It never crossed my mind-” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kingsley took his seat as Bulstrode trudged slowly to the podium. He stared at the crowd and then spoke in a gruff tone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I imagine many of you do not know me. Frankly, my job is one that most people would not like to imagine a man must do, yet it is something someone must do. That is how it has always been. For centuries, this ship has been used to ferry prisoners to their punishments. I have buried countless bodies of those that met their demise in Azkaban, unable to bear their own minds any longer. I have performed my duties without question, and for that many innocents have suffered. But suffering has always been part of my duty.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Noone made a sound. Kingsley wondered briefly if Bulstrode had been running over this moment in his cabin. Bulstrode continued. “While no other ships can find Azkaban, the Dementors are always able to return to it despite its Unplottable location. They do this by communicating with each other. I have had the misfortune of working in the presence of Dementors for four decades, yet not even I know how exactly Dementors talk to each other. They take orders from wizards, but in reality, their true loyalty only lies with another.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bulstrode paused. A tense silence had fallen as if the audience was aware that an ancient secret was being unveiled before them. Bulstrode spoke once more, and his eyes took on a haunted look.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What I am about to tell you is a secret every Warden is told by his predecessor. I once thought I would rather die than reveal it, but it seems the justice of Azkaban has become tarnished, making it necessary to… change.” Bulstrode took a deep breath. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Dementors of Azkaban are bound together by an entity that lies on the lowest floor of Azkaban. No one but Ezkridis, the original resident of the island’s fortress, may truly know what it is. Every few months, each Dementor must go down to it. Many years ago, when I was more foolhardy, I once followed it and swore to never again. It turns the air colder and drains joy more than Dementor I have ever known.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bulstrode swallowed his breath and his hand trembled unconsciously. “The Dementors give it most of the souls they have sucked out with their Kisses. In turn, it unites the Dementors and allows them to find the island no matter how far away they are. The Wardens have named it the Despera.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He looked around at the room. “If any one of you knows in his heart he cannot fight the Despera, then leave now while your souls remain with your bodies and not in the belly of that damned monstrosity. Whatever happens on Azkaban today, I will not interfere. I will only ferry whoever is left back to shore, as it has been my duty.” His eyes scanned the faces, looking for the first signs of panic and retreat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few seconds of silence passed before a voice spoke. “Did you really think that would be enough to make us run away? Give up without a fight?” Harry stood up from his seat. His voice rose. “Every one of us here has fought Voldemort with our lives while you were taking innocent people to prison cells. I’ve seen things that will give a run for this Despera thing any day. You may not have any bloody guts to fight, but I do! If we have a chance at taking down Azkaban, a thing that’s tormented us, our families, and our friends, then there’s nothing you can say to make me run!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a moment, Bulstrode gave a stunned look before he leered. “Potter.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron stood up next and shouted, “I’m with you, mate. Through thick and thin.” “As am I,” said Hermione. Then Ginny, then Neville, then Luna, then everyone else, each saying, “As am I.” Bulstrode stared at the crowd standing before him with a look of mixed disbelief and chagrin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It seems I was right, Warden,” said Kingsley, walking up to the podium with a small smile. “We are all willing to fight once more for a better future without Dementors.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a moment, the Warden looked like he was about to rant in a tirade but then only gave a disgruntled huff and said, “So be it, Minister. They will not learn until they see- they feel for themselves. I will be at the bridge.” And before anyone could say otherwise, he trudged out of the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Now then,” called Kingsley, for a clamor had arose of cheering on Harry. The chatter died down eventually. “Now that our resolve is apparent, we must prepare. Warden Bulstrode and I discussed beforehand of the Despera and gave me a journal of Ezkridis that the wardens have guarded. After inspecting its contents with some help-” he glanced at Hermione and Fawley, “we have come up with a plan. Our objective above all is to vanquish the Despera. From what I understand, the Despera is the core that anchors the Dementors to Azkaban, helping them find their way back to the island. In turn, the Dementors give the Despera souls they have taken. Our theory is that without the Despera, the Dementors will lose what attaches them to Azkaban and scatter, no longer able to find Azkaban thanks to the spells that makes it Unplottable. We shall proceed with that theory.” And carefully yet clearly, Kingsley went through the details of the plan. It was not a terribly complicated plan, yet it required everyone to play a part. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kingsley finished by stating, “If you fail to recall a happy memory, then think back to three months ago when the reign of Voldemort was finished forever. As long as that day remains in your memories, no Dementor can overwhelm us.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t anyone here will have trouble with that, Minister!” shouted George. Scattered laughter spread across the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fair point, Weasley, but one that bears repeating,” said Kingsley, also smiling. He looked at the clock. “We shall be arriving soon. The bell will ring when the island is in sight. Keep your happy memories close to you.” Applause followed as the Minister of Magic stepped down from the platform.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fawley provided light refreshments for those who were hungry by making a table appear loaded with mini sandwiches and flagons of Butterbeer with mugs next to them. “More can be provided if needed.” A surprising number of people chose to eat, including Percy, who complimented Fawley’s eye for keeping time and skills with Summoning rather energetically. Fawley nodded with a polite smile. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kingsley and several others walked up to the deck and stared out at the murky sea. The sky was getting cloudier, and the waters murkier as they approached the island. Kingsley saw Fudge from the corner of his eye, who seemed to be trying to evade attention as much as possible, staying away from the windows at the bridge after a quick glance at the deck and contracting his body inwards whenever someone passed by.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That was quite a bold speech, Harry,” said Kingsley, turning to him, who was leaning next to the guide rail. “Not that I expected anything less.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sorry, Minister. I got worked up over thinking about the Dementors,” confessed Harry, shaking his head. “When I last fought them three months ago, I… almost gave up fighting them. I’m not sure how ready I’ll be to fight the Despera.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Neither am I, Harry. But we must do our best. We are not alone.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t want to make my friends worry, especially Ginny.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You must trust that your loved ones will accept your weakness. Remus once told me what your Dementor was.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He did?” asked Harry, his ears reddening slightly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I agree with what he said. Dementors are right to be feared. What matters is that we do not forget the greater fear.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The fear of losing those we love to them. The fear of being left behind.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nodded in understanding, his mind recalling all those that had left before him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Voldemort-.” His neck twitched ever so slightly. He was getting more used to calling He Who Must Not Be Named by his name. “Was a catalyst for the wizarding world to make us realize how much we assume Dementors will play by our rules. Now that they have no reason to restrain themselves, they will likely try to perform the Dementor’s Kiss the moment they can.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I won’t let that happen.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you certain that I cannot change your mind about our group?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m afraid not, Minister. I need every single one of them. We’ve been through too much to stop now. Not just Ron and Hermione. Neville and Luna and Ginny as well. You’re welcome to try and talk them out of it if you want.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I will take your word for it. I needed to know one more time.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry gave a quick grin. “I will say it’s nice to go along with someone else’s plan for once in my life and not having everyone look to me as the ‘Chosen One.’” He gave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p> </p>
