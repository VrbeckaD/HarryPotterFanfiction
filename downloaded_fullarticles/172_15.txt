    <p>Patroclus takes in a deep breath, air filling his thin chest before he releases it in a streaming gust from between his pursed lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He moves his head side to side trying to extinguish all eleven of the candles stabbed into the chalky white frosting of the cake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pushes the air out of his lungs as forcefully as he can, determined to blow them all out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He watches as each flame bends backward before snuffing out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is only one left, a bit apart from the others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The flame sways and flickers but Patroclus can feel his lungs emptying and the little finger of fire stubbornly lingers.</p><p>There are a couple of “aww’s” from some of the children gathered around him and nothing but a disappointed glower from his father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because Patroclus can’t even manage to blow out the candles on his own birthday cake. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No wish for you,” Clysonymus taunts, his pudgy face twisted into a mocking sneer.</p><p>Patroclus lowers his eyes and takes in another breath and blows out the final candle without looking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is fairly sure Clysonymus came to his party with the sole wish of making him miserable.</p><p>Truth be told, Patroclus did not even want to have a birthday party.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had been his father’s insistence that this pitiful event was being held.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Menoetius was a politician and a politician’s son was expected to host social events.</p><p>In this—and so many other ways—Patroclus is a grave disappointment.</p><p>Only a few of his classmates are in attendance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He suspects that this is only because their parents had insisted because they wished to garner favor with Menoetius.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patroclus does not have any friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He has always felt different from his peers, he has always been apart from them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He doesn’t know what it is but they can all seem to sense it.</p><p>The crowd moves over to open presents at his father’s suggestion and Patroclus follows, feeling no excitement.</p><p>Patroclus unwraps the gifts doing his best to keep a smile upon his face and thank the givers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this, he is at least not an embarrassment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Though, he does not feel that his father is even remotely impressed with him.</p><p>The children descend upon the open gifts upon Clysonymus’ suggestion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patroclus does not even offer a token complaint.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of the others ask him to join them as they scamper off to play with his gifts or the activities that his father has provided for them.</p><p>Patroclus glances over to his father and sees the man’s lip curl in disgust before he turns and walks off to join the other adults.</p><p>Patroclus looks at the table where the gifts had been and takes the only one that remains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is some dice game.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He takes it behind the hedge of rose bushes his mother loves to sit by. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His mother…</p><p>He wishes that his mother was allowed to be here with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She never really speaks but she’s always kind to him and sometimes she sings to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But if there is anyone who is more of a disappointment to Menoetius it is Patroclus’ mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patroclus does not understand what happened to her but he knows that whatever it was has left the woman somewhat…simple. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Patroclus does not mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He likes sitting with her in this spot saying nothing with only the bees and roses to keep them company. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Now it is only him as his mother is confined upstairs in her room.</p><p>Patroclus is pleasantly surprised to find the game is one that he can play alone. It involves rolling the dice into the felt lined box trying to roll the appropriate combination of numbers so he can flip down each of the numbered wooden pegs.</p><p>He’s actually getting close to winning, he just needs a seven and a one, when a shadow is cast over the box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He glances up and sees Clysonymus looming over him, his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>“Give me that game.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The boy commands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I want to play it with Amita.”</p><p>Normally Patroclus would have just given in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’s not entirely sure what gets into him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe it’s the fact that this is his birthday party; maybe it’s the fact that he’s tired of Clysonymus constantly bullying him; maybe he’s fed up with this awful day; maybe he’s high on too much birthday cake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever the case, Patroclus pulls the box closer to himself and shakes his head.</p><p>The larger boy frowns down at him, his hands go down to his sides and ball into fleshy balls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m not asking.”</p><p>“I said, ‘no’.” Patroclus retorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s mine.”</p><p>Clysonymus’ face goes a splotchy red, “<em>I </em>gave it to you.”</p><p>“It’s <em>my </em>birthday.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patroclus persists.</p><p>“No one cares!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one even wanted to come to your stupid birthday party because no one even likes you!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He reaches down and grabs for the box.</p><p>Patroclus grabs for it on reflex and the two of them become locked in a tug of war.</p><p>“Give it!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clysonymus snarls.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>They both pull until there is a sudden crackle as one edge of the box rips free and then Clysonymus stumbles back.</p><p>“You broke it!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He yells.</p><p>“<em>You</em> broke it!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patroclus retorts, angrier than he can ever remember being.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He feels weird, he feels warm all over, like something is roiling just underneath his skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It feels like all of his hairs are standing up on end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He feels stronger.</p><p>Clysonymus’ fist comes up and he aims it at Patroclus’ face. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>That warm feeling inside of him explodes forward and out of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s strange.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sloshes forward like a wave, tilting him forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He feels dizzy.</p><p>He hears a scream and sees Clysonymus fall backwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tears are streaming down his face and he is clutching his leg.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patroclus blinks at him in confusion.</p><p>“My leg!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He broke my leg!” The boy is screaming as the adults all rush over and bend over him.</p><p>Patroclus starts to push to his feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His father’s dark eyes find him and Patroclus feels fear cramp sickeningly in his gut.</p><p align="center">~ o ~ o ~</p><p>Patroclus is grounded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is confined to his room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is not even allowed to go downstairs for dinner, all his meals are brought up to his bedroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clysonymus was taken to the hospital after their fight and his leg was indeed broken, bent at an odd angle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Menoetius had said that parts of the bone seemed to be missing altogether somehow and that some kind of implant would be needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was as if part of the bone had disappeared.</p><p>When questioned, Patroclus had insisted that he did not know what happened but the adults concluded that he must have kicked the other boy. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Clysonymus continues to insist Patroclus hit him with his mind.</p><p>There is talk of some kind of disciplinary action outside of a grounding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patroclus has heard his father on the phone talking to military boarding schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He knows that this is the perfect excuse for his father to be rid of him. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Patroclus has never been wanted.</p><p>He takes a book from his shelf and goes to sit at the bench below his window and is looking outside when he sees a man appear suddenly in the middle of the street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He rubs at his eyes with the knuckles of his hands because the man actually just <em>appeared</em> out of thin air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But even after a vigorous rub, the man is still there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is tall and broad in chest and shoulders, he walks with a stately gait that for some reason seems odd to Patroclus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He walks right up to their front yard and Patroclus startles when the man glances up and gives him a polite nod.</p><p>He hears the doorbell ring and then the mysterious man is admitted inside of his home. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Patroclus runs to his door and grips the knob.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He bites his bottom lip as he turns it slowly trying to open the door silently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It creeks some on the hinges and his teeth dig so hard into his lip that it draws a line of pain and he fears he may have drawn blood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hears his father’s voice booming but it does not sound like it is directed at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He slinks through the hall and down the first few steps to peer over the ledge and spy upon his father and stranger in their lounge.</p><p>Menoetius is sputtering in anger at the strange man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How dare you come into my home spouting such nonsense!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I should call the police and have you removed.”</p><p>“I assure you, sir,” the stranger replies calmly in a deep voice that rolls throughout the house like distant thunder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I am quite serious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am here on behalf of the Pelion Academy of Magic to enroll your son Patroclus and explain the world of wizarding to him and his family.”</p><p>Patroclus barely surpasses a gasp, unwilling to believe what he is hearing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This has to be some kind of prank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This man has to be mad.</p><p>“Preposterous!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Menoetius booms.</p><p>The stranger sighs, the sound is exasperated and seems to come up all the way from his feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pulls out a long length of wood that Patroclus can only describe as a wand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Menoetius pulls back as the big man sweeps the wand in a few flowing gestures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The air around him glimmers and suddenly the whole bottom half of the man elongates, transforming into the body and legs of a horse.</p><p>This time Patroclus is unable to suppress the squeak of surprise and terror that scurries up and out his throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thankfully, his father is in equal shock and does not hear as he takes a few quick steps backward.</p><p>“M—m—monster…” he gasps out.</p><p>“No,” the human-horse-hybrid replies slowly, as though speaking to someone who is particularly thick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Centaur…but you may call me Chiron.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now that we have an understanding, shall we have a proper conversation?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes glance up to Patroclus’ hiding place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“<em>All </em>of us,” he swishes and flicks with his wand and says:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“<em>Wingardium Leviosa.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>To Patroclus’ horror, he is lifted up into the air with a startled yelp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The centaur moves his wand like a conductor before an orchestra, guiding Patroclus down onto one of the sofas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patroclus casts a horrified stare at his father who is no longer cowering but frowning up at the centaur fiercely.</p><p align="center">~ o ~ o ~</p><p>Chiron magics some tea and little cucumber sandwiches over to them as he patiently explains the world of magic and the school that trains them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patroclus is silent the whole time, shock numbing him and leaving his ears ringing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suddenly things begin to make sense to him: Clysonymus’ leg and a dozen other strange events that dotted his life that he could never really explain; his perpetual sense of being different from his peers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It all finally makes sense.</p><p>“What will happen to Clysonymus?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patroclus asks.</p><p>“The Accidental Magic Division has dispatched two agents to both deal with the loss of bone and alter the boy’s memory.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chiron replies evenly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And he would need to leave?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Menoetius asks, clearly concerned with something wholly different.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He would go to live at this…<em>school</em>?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Chiron, who has returned himself to his hulking human form sips politely at his tea before nodding.</p><p>“He would join this—” he sneers. “<em>Wizarding </em>community after—away from our world.”</p><p>Chiron’s eyes narrow as he places the teacup on its saucer but he nods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If the boy so chooses,” Chiron turns his head to Patroclus, his expression questioning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What do you say, Patroclus, would you like to come to Pelion?”</p><p>Patroclus looks at his father who’s frown is contemptuous as alway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He thinks of all the classmates ignore him and his lunches spent alone with no one to talk or play with; he thinks of the boarding schools his father has been looking into.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He realizes this is his chance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is his chance to go somewhere where he has the chance to truly belong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may be a long shot but it’s a shot.</p><p>He nods.</p><p>“Take him.” Menoetius dismisses with a flippant wave of his hand</p><p>“There is the matter of the boy’s supplies and—”</p><p>“I will pay it all.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Menoetius continues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I just want him gone.”</p><p>Chiron closes his eyes and places his teacup onto its saucer with a soft clink.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I see…very well.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once more his depthless brown eyes are upon Patroclus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Pack a trunk of clothes and anything else you might require and meet me at the front door in an hour.”</p><p>Patroclus looks to his father who points his finger up to his bedroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do as this <em>creature </em>says.”</p><p>Chiron snorts an affronted breath but otherwise, his composure remains intact as he lifts his teacup for another delicate sip.</p><p>The look in his father’s eyes is what finally gets Patroclus to scurry up from the couch and up the stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He rushes into his room and quickly begins tugging clothes out his drawers and closet and tossing them into a traveling trunk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The reality of it all still whirls around him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is going away, he is going to learn <em>magic</em>!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He cannot remember ever being so excited.</p><p>He’s tugging the trunk out of his room when it hits him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is one person he will miss.</p><p>He drops his trunk and turns and runs back down the hallway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pulls up short in front of his mother’s bedroom door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He takes a deep breath and pulls it open and steps inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His mother is sitting in her rocking chair swaying forward and back softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is doing nothing but staring out the window, her eyes far away.</p><p>Patroclus step in front of her and takes one of her hands in his own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her eyes drift to him for a moment before going back out the window.</p><p>“I’m going away for a while, Mother,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patroclus says.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I imagine I won’t be back till next summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m going to school…to learn…to learn something amazing.”</p><p>She does not answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She almost never does.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She begins to hum softly to herself in the same rhythm as her steady rocking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a familiar tune, if not a known one, she has hummed it as long as Patroclus can remember.</p><p>Patroclus sighs and presses a kiss to the back of her hand and she continues to hum to herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He places her hand back on the arm of the rocking chair and turns to leave when he catches sight of her violin mounted on the wall.</p><p>He remembers that she used to play.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He remembers how alive her eyes had been when she did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She has not touched the instrument since she changed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before he knows what he’s doing Patroclus snatches the instrument from the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His mother does not even glance his way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He casts one last look at her before leaving and shutting the door behind him.</p><p>He opens his trunk and places the violin inside, nestling it among his clothes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He does not play but perhaps he can learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All he knows is that he wants to take something with him, some piece of his mother, and he knows that she will not miss it.</p><p>When he gets to the top of the stairs Chiron uses the same spell he used to levitate Patroclus to float the trunk down to the front door.</p><p>Patroclus hurries down after it.</p><p>“Let’s go.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chiron says, opening the door.</p><p>“My father—”</p><p>“Will not be seeing us off.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chiron’s tone is steady but he places a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Despite his fear of the centaur earlier, the gesture is comforting.</p><p>He knows that he should not be surprised.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>They walk down the drive and out past the lawn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chiron carries the trunk as though it is but a tiny parcel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He places his hand on his shoulder once again.</p><p>“Stay close.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once more the wand is out and moving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And it might be best if you were to shut your eyes.”</p><p>Patroclus casts one last look at his house from over his shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is no one there to see him go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The world lurches around him and it all blurs and twists about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His stomach feels as though it is being wrung out and then everything goes black.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He feels as though his chest is being constricted and there is a violent pressure in his head.</p><p>He feels like he is going to be pulled inside out.</p>
