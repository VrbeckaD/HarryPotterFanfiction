    <p>“You’re fucking mental, you know that, right?” Ron said as he dumped suitcases in front of Harry. “You and my sister, both fucking mental.”</p><p>“Oh, enough, Ronald. I’ve already explained the reasons.” Hermione threw some random bags on Harry’s bed. “Everything will sort itself out right.”</p><p>“No, it’s absurd, Hermione. I thought you were the thinker out of all of us?”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Hermione stood with hands on hips, glaring at Ron. </p><p>“They’re both giving each other permission to go screw other people! Who does that?”</p><p>“Ronald Weasley!” Harry could tell Hermione was fuming but tuned out as she began a yelling match with Ron.</p><p>Admittedly, this was not what he had imagined life post-war was going to be like. The first few weeks passed by in a blur. The funerals he cannot look back on, the pain of so many lost still weighed heavily on his shoulders. Mostly, he had not really understood how much the Ministry required of him or how much he wanted to be with the Ministry.</p><p>Ginny stood by him. She comforted him, loved him, and he loved her right back. Logically, there was no reason for their break up. But Ginny was too understanding and too patient. He didn’t fight Voldemort to hold people back. When Ginny was presented with an opportunity to play on the Holyhead Harpies Quidditch team, Harry was naturally excited for her. They both knew, however, that Ginny’s schedule would be so busy and with Harry’s work at the Ministry, they agreed to separate. There was no doubt that they loved each other and wanted to be together but having the space and freedom would allow each of them to live their lives as they wanted to. They had their whole lives to be together now.</p><p>So here Harry was, moving into his own apartment in Muggle London which was enchanted to be hidden from prying Muggle eyes. His two best friends arguing over the decision of Harry and Ginny going their separate ways and Harry couldn’t help but smile. Ron loved his sister and would normally be very happy that a boy was distancing himself, but even Ron had managed to get used to his sister being with his best friend.</p><p>“No, it’s absolute fucking madness, Hermione. This whole stupid thing. We almost fucking died fighting the evilest man in the world, only to have my sister thrown out there to the wolves like a…a…” Ron stumbled on his words.</p><p>Harry reached out and gently gripped Ron’s shoulder making his friend stop what he was saying and look at Harry. “I love Ginny with all my heart. She deserves to live her life, Ron. That’s all I want her to do.”</p><p>“Even if it means she finds someone else?”</p><p>Harry nodded. “We’re still young, mate. Still teenagers. We all have an unknown future. So let's see what we can make of it.”</p><p>Ron shrugged, but shook his head. “When she breaks your heart, mate, I’ll be the one saying, ‘I told you so.’” </p><p>“I know.” Harry smiled and patted his mates shoulder. “No more arguing with the love of your life. Otherwise you’re in for months of hell.” </p><p>Ron looked back at Hermione who was still seething, even if patently, at Ron. She was tapping her foot, hands on hips, and the scowl she wore on her face made Ron gulp. “I just got used to me and you and Harry and Ginny.” Ron explained. “Now it’s me and you and Harry and whoever and my sister and whoever.”</p><p>“You’re an idiot, Ronald.” Hermione stormed out of the room with Ron hot on her heels.</p><p>Harry shook his head and began unpacking. Withdrawing his wand, and reciting a small incantation, Harry smiled as he watched his things floating around the room and settling into place. “I love magic,” he said softly.</p><p>“Good thing Muggles can't see this.”</p><p>Harry spun around and saw Pansy Parkinson standing by his door. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“I live upstairs. Apartment 32.” Pansy replied as she entered the room and examined the pictures that hung themselves on the wall.</p><p>“What are you doing? I don’t remember inviting you in.” Harry said, irritated by her lack of respect.</p><p>“You’re rude.” Pansy said. “Harry Potter, saviour of the world. A hero. Pfft!” Pansy chuckled to herself. “You’re lucky, that’s what you are. Damn, lucky.”</p><p>Harry blinked, unsure why Pansy was standing in front of him, why she was talking to him…insulting him. He couldn’t even find the words to say anything to her. He stood, staring at her, dumbfounded.</p><p>“I never knew Weasley was such a potty mouth. I bet Molly didn’t teach him that kind of language.”</p><p>Harry finally found his voice. “You and I are not friends. Why are you even speaking to me?”</p><p>Pansy laughed. “Oh, you’re so high and mighty now that us lowly witches can’t speak in your presence? You’re not fucking royalty, Potter.”</p><p>“I never claimed to be.” Harry said, his earlier irritation returning. “Get out of my house.”</p><p>“There is a party downstairs tonight. In Apartment 13. You should come.” Pansy said. “Perhaps it’ll do you some good.”</p><p>Pansy left, leaving Harry speechless once again.</p><p>**~**</p><p>Later that evening, Harry could faintly hear the thumping from the music drifting up through the floors. He had no idea why, but he couldn’t get Pansy out of his mind. She was the same girl he remembered from Hogwarts, yet different. She looked exactly the same, her hair was a little longer perhaps, but there was something about her now that he didn’t hate. </p><p>Harry tried to eat his dinner – Chinese takeaway from the restaurant across the street from his building. But the silence in his apartment was deafening, making the faint thumping more appealing. Before he knew it, he was grabbing his keys and his jacket and heading for the 13th floor.</p><p>As the elevator opened, people, music, and flashing lights greeted him. Walking into the crowd, he realised he didn’t recognise a single person and he smiled as he relaxed for the first time in a long time. There were people laughing, dancing, talking, and drinking all around him and Harry wasn’t sure where he should go.</p><p>“Glad to see you made it,” Pansy almost shouted in Harry's ear. “Here,” she trust something into Harry’s hand, took the other with hers and led him through the crowded room out onto a balcony. “We’ll pop over to the pool area. It’s much quieter there.”</p><p>Harry, again found himself speechless. They were standing on the edge of the balcony, a set of stairs appeared out of nowhere, leading up to a deck with an Olympic sized pool. Once they reached the deck, the stairs disappeared and an invisible barrier closed around them as the deck hovered away from the apartment building. Harry gasped as he floated away from the noise and above the streets of Muggle London.</p><p>“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Pansy asked, standing beside Harry.</p><p>“Who owns this place?” </p><p>Pansy shrugged. “I’m not exactly sure. I think some guy that used to work for the Ministry. But, mostly, it's one massive party – day or night.”</p><p>It was then that Harry realised he had a drink in his hand and took a sip. “What is this? He said as he held up the glass that had a bright, green swirl of liquid in it.</p><p>“It’s the Harry Potter.” Pansy tried to hide her smile, but failed miserably and began to laugh as did Harry.</p><p>“There is a drink named after me?” Harry said as he downed the last of the drink. “It tastes like lime cordial.” </p><p>“Like what?” Pansy screwed up her face. “What’s cordial?”</p><p>“It’s a Muggle drink. It’s a non-alcoholic syrup that you mix with water.” Harry explained.</p><p>“It sounds disgusting.” Pansy flicked her wand, and new drinks appeared, floating before them and Harry took his. “These are much better.”</p><p>This drink was clear, almost like water except it had a cloudy shimmer to it. “What’s this one called?” </p><p>“Dumbledore.” Pansy said as she sipped the drink.</p><p>“Are all the drinks here named after Wizards?” Harry asked.</p><p>Pansy laughed. “Mainly the famous ones.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t want to be famous. I don’t want a drink named after me. I don’t want books named after me. I just want to be left alone.” Harry ranted.</p><p>“And yet, you are here with me?” Pansy raised her glass.</p><p>Harry looked at the young woman standing beside hm for a moment, before he raised his glass to hers, clinking them together. “Yes. Yes I am.”</p><p>The night passed by in a massive blur. Harry and Pansy danced, drank, laughed, swam in the pool, before drinking some more. Harry decided that Luna was the best drink. It was just the right mixture, but also the one that made them the drunkest.</p><p>**~**</p><p>Harry woke the next day. His head heavy, the sheets silky – silky? Harry sat up quickly, his eyes not focusing he then realised he wasn’t wearing his glasses. He patted the side table till his hand landed on them and he quickly put them on. He wasn’t in his bed. The sheets were dark red, satin, and he was…Harry lifted the sheets and confirmed that he was naked. </p><p>“You look lost.” Pansy said as she entered the room in a robe and a towel wrapped around her head. “The shower is that way.” She pointed in the direction she just come from. “Your clothes are already washed and dried.</p><p>“Pansy…” Harry knew he was blushing. “Did we…”</p><p>Grinning, Pansy unwrapped the towel from her head. “Go take a shower. Your mind will clear. Luna has a way of messing with your head.”</p><p>Wrapping the top sheet around him, Harry made his way to the shower. Once under the hot stream of water, Harry’s head did indeed clear. Memories played in his head as if in a pensieve. Harry could see himself dancing with Pansy then kissing her. His feelings came rushing back as if hitting him with a curse. Passion, desire, and lust burned under his skin. </p><p>The moment was over and he saw himself arm in arm with Pansy, heading up the elevator. They were still laughing as they entered her Apartment. She plopped him down on the bed and with a flick of her wand, his clothes were gone and he was under the sheets.</p><p>“LUNA MAKES YOUR CLOTHES FALL OFF!” Harry yelled and pumped his fists in the air. Pansy giggled and Harry passed out in the bed.</p><p>Harry blinked, the hot water still streaming over him, but he was back in the present. He had never known such freedom as he had last night and he smiled. Turning off the taps, Harry stepped out of the shower into the steamy bathroom. All he knew in that moment was that he wanted Pansy.</p>
