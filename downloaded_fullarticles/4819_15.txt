  <strong>Flashback:</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Alec screamed as the nasty people tried to enter his family’s home. He could hear his parents running down the stairs behind him from where they had been attending to baby Isabelle. She was only a born 3 months ago, slightly under a year younger than Alec. He felt a small burst of power flood through his body, and held out his hand on instinct. There was a flash of white, and Alec blacked out. Later, he awoke to his parents arguing with someone, Izzy being gently rocked in Maryse’s arms.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“You can’t take him! He’s only a child!”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“He is a danger to everyone around him! Wandless magic is very unsafe!”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“She’s right, Robert. Alexander could potentially kill all of us on accident.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Alec heard his father sigh and admit defeat to whatever was going on. A beautiful woman with cruel eyes walked into the room and grabbed Alec’s arm, dragging him out of the house, his home, before disapparating to a place that was very cold and dark. Alec didn’t like it, especially when the woman, who he was beginning to realise wasn’t very nice, told the guards that he was “a very dangerous person. He has already killed 13 Death Eaters who attacked his home using wandless magic, and the Minister has decreed that he be placed in Cell 1. Move any in Cell 1 to a free cell elsewhere. There is to be no arguments on this.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The guards led Alec into the dark building and down several sets of stairs, passing black hooded figures every once in a while. Nobody talked aside from the occasional mutterings of the people in the cells they passed by. Alec began to feel really scared when there was barely enough light to for him to see 3 feet in front of him. But then he heard the harsh whispers of the cloaked figures wandering around the place, and they comforted him, making him feel not so scared anymore.</em>

<p> </p>
<p>The next few years passed by quickly, with Alec getting raised by the dementors of Azkaban and Luke Garroway, a werewolf who was put in Cell 2 for supposedly betraying his best friend and her daughter, Clarissa, to the Dark Lord, Valentine. However, Valentine failed in killing young Clarissa, instead leaving a small cut on her forehead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Maryse and Robert Lightwood quickly forgot their eldest child after he was taken to Azkaban by Lady Belcourt, and they adopted little Jonathan ‘Jace’ Wayland. They had another child, Max Lightwood, and Isabelle ‘Izzy’ Lightwood grew up with no shortage of siblings to play with. But being in Azkaban helped Alec lots as he continued on learning wandless magic and mundane languages from Luke. The Dementors had taught Alec their language, and he had adopted 2 of them as his honorary parents, naming them ‘Blackie’ and ‘Vengeance’. Growing up in Azkaban has its uses, as Alec’s memory was top-notch. He required a Dementor to sleep at night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Alec turned 11, Albus Dumbledore came to Azkaban to ask him to attend Hogwarts. Alec considered the idea, but refused when he learned that no, Dementors weren’t allowed at the school, even if he couldn’t sleep without them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>September 1<sup>st</sup>, Platform 9 ¾</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Come along, children. It’s the same every year; packed with Mundanes, of course. Come on!” Called out Maryse Lightwood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To the side, Clary Fray heard Maryse and walked towards the Lightwoods, as she didn’t know how to get to Platform 9 ¾ and figured that they must know. She followed the Lightwoods to a brick wall between platforms 9 and 10. She watched as the mother told the eldest child not wearing Hogwarts robes to “go along, Isabelle, you’re better than this!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ex-excuse me?” Clary said shyly. “Do you know how to…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How to get on the platform?” The woman guessed. Clary nodded. “Don’t worry, it’s Jace’s first time to Hogwarts too. Now, all you have to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Run if you’re nervous.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The blonde boy standing a little in front of Maryse smiled a little and waved. “I’m Jace, in case you were wondering. This is my mother, Maryse, and my little brother, Max.” He introduced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Clary ran at the wall, bracing herself for the impact. However, to her shock, Clary went straight through the wall. She quickly gathered herself and found herself a compartment, after putting her trunk away of course. In a few minutes, a blonde boy that Clary recognised as Jace opened the door slightly. “Hi, can I sit with you? Only everywhere else is full.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Of course not!” Jace smiled and came to sit down by her. “I’m Jace, by the way. Jace Lightwood.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m Clary. Clary Fray.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So it’s true then!” Jace gasped. “Do you really have the… the…” He appeared speechless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The scar?” Clary asked. Jace nodded quickly. Clary smiled and moved her hair further to the side so he could see better. “Cool” he whispered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When they got to the Hogwarts platform, they saw Hagrid yelling out “Firs’ years! Firs’ years this way! Come on, don’t be shy!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Clary smiled at Hagrid and said “Hello Hagrid”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well hello there, Clary. Come on now, this way to the boats!” Hagrid led all the first years down to the boats that were sitting on the shore. It was a short trip, around 5-10 minutes long, and everyone gasped when Hogwarts came up around the corner. It seemed like it was only a few seconds before Clary and Jace were standing towards the front of the first years before the double doors, which Jace told her led to the Great Hall. Professor McGonagall, who had taken them into the Entrance Hall, had disappeared into the Hall to check something.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, before she had left, the professor had said “Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But, before you take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. The houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. While you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you points, but any rule breaking and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the houses with the most points is awarded the House Cup.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, Professor McGonagall came back and told the first years “We’re ready for you. Follow me.” And with that, she led the newest students of Hogwarts through the doors.</p>
