    <p>Remus had a habit of waking early. Sleeping never came easy to him unless he was exhausted, like after a full moon. He rose from his four-poster bed, a dull ache in his bones. He groaned. He was too young to wake up all achy like he all too often did. Since he woke up so early, he could get dressed without anyone seeing his many scars. He pulled his sleep shirt over his head. When he looked down he didn’t like what he saw. Long, jagged scars covered his torso, wrapping his shoulders. He traced the scars from the newest moon. He shivered as he ran his fingers across the pink-brown lines.</p>
<p>“Remus?” A voice from the bed over said groggily. </p>
<p>Remus stood, paralyzed.  </p>
<p>Sirius pulled back the curtains. “Merlin. I knew it was bad but-”</p>
<p>“Stop. Please stop.” Remus covered his chest. </p>
<p>Sirius got up and walked towards his roommate. He reached his hand towards Remus. “You’re so thin,” He remarked. </p>
<p>“Yeah,”</p>
<p>“There are so many…” He noted.</p>
<p>“I know!” He shouted. “Where are you going with this” Tears filled his eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Remus. I’m so sorry” </p>
<p>“I don’t want your apology,” Remus said shaking.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Acceptance. I want you to accept me for who I am. I don’t want to be your fucking pity pet. I want you to love me as I am”</p>
<p>“You want me to love you?” He said, a range of emotions flitting across his face.</p>
<p>“Shit- I- Like a friend? Do you know? Like friends. That’s what we are, right? I mean you already knew so if you were going to say anything about me being a bloodthirsty monster you would’ve said it by now, right? Or where you just silently accepting because of what everyone else was? Or are you waiting for the right moment to kill me? Is that why you’re up at this hour? Do you want to murder me? Go ahead. Do it. I’m not scared,” He let his arms out “Come at me. Do your worst” He spat.</p>
<p>“Rem, no. You’re my best friend. Take a breath. Do you really think I would do anything to hurt you?” He stepped towards Remus.</p>
<p>Remus dropped his arms. “No. I was just overthinking.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Don’t think that I don’t lo-- like you because of who you are.” Sirius said.</p>
<p>Remus sat on his bed and sighed. The fair-skinned heir sat next to him. “You really mean it?” He asked. “What you said? I don’t want you playing with my feelings.” Remus crossed his arms in an attempt to shield himself from the chill seeping into his chest. </p>
<p>“Remus John Lupin, I am sick and tired of you selling yourself short. You need to let people in,” He said.</p>
<p>“You’re really smart. Do you know that? You’re so smart and you never show it because of your ‘tough guy’ persona or whatever’,” He turned towards Sirius and outstretched his hand and placed it on the other boy’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” He asked, curious. </p>
<p>“You’re really smart. You know a lot about… a lot of things. You’re a little socially inept sometimes, but I can tell when you’re alone with me, you mean it. You really love me don’t you?” He exhaled and looked out the window. “The sun’s rising. Better get ready before Frank and the others wake up. Don’t want them to think of anything. Imaginations run wild in a place like this.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean.” Sirius glared at Remus. </p>
<p>“Siri, you know what I mean.” He turned towards him.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think I do,” Sirius said coldly.</p>
<p>“I think you know exactly what I mean, Sirius. You’re just too scared to say it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Say what Rem? Spit it out!” Sirius stood, raising his voice. </p>
<p>“Sirius don’t,” Remus whispered frantically.</p>
<p>“You’re gay! I get it. And you think I am too?” He scoffed. “Really Rem, You know me. Straight as an arrow” He chuckled falsely. </p>
<p>“Sirius, can we please discuss this in private? I really don’t feel like having this conversation yet. Right now, I mean.” He sighed and pulled a sweater out of his trunk.</p>
<p>“What Remus? Discuss what in private? I’m straight and you know that. Don’t be making a move on me.” He said. </p>
<p>“Sirius I really don’t think it’s appropriate-”</p>
<p>“Wha’s goin’ on?” James sniffled, reaching for his glasses.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Sirius and I are just having a little row, nothing more” Remus said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not just a little row. You’re gay and trying to be all gay with me, and it’s quite frankly gross.” Sirius turned from Remus.</p>
<p>“How long have you two been up? The suns barely rose,” James sat up.</p>
<p>“Not important. Remus here is trying to make some homo move on me. Being all romantic and shit.” Sirius said.</p>
<p>Remus curled up in his bed. Sirius walked towards the stairs before turning towards the two of them. Remus clearly did not want to bring James into all of that mess.</p>
<p>“Sirius, please don’t-” He cried. Sirius opened the door and slammed it shut.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Be honest.” James got up and started towards Remus’s four-poster. </p>
<p>“I don’t know where to begin. He heard me getting up, and then- I don’t want to talk about it” Remus sighed. </p>
<p>“Moony, you know I care right? It doesn’t matter to me if you’re a homosexual.” James put his hand on his shoulder. </p>
<p>“Gay. Not a homosexual. It’s too… medical” Remus looked at the cold stone floor.</p>
<p>“Right. Gay. I don’t care if you’re gay, you’re my best friend.”</p>
<p>“No. Sirius is your best friend. I’m just the third wheel”</p>
<p>“Remus, no. That’s not how I feel. He’s more like a brother to me. We all are. Brotherhood.” James said. </p>
<p>“I don’t see him that way. I really do love him.” Remus looked out the window across the lake. “He’s a really good guy.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Look, I’m not one for grand gestures” He joked, “But maybe you should show him how you feel. Something big.”</p>
<p>“James, you heard him. ‘Straight as an arrow’? I really don’t think that would be appropriate, on either side. You don’t understand how hard this is, don’t you? This isn’t you and you’re wild goose chase with Lily. This is a real friendship that I could ruin. My life is on the line here!” Remus stood and pulled his pants on one leg at a time, zipping up the fly with care not to let James see what laid underneath. He sighed. “You don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“Ouch. I’m really trying here. I’m new to all of this too.” James stood alongside Remus.</p>
<p>“I’m not. I was born like this you know.” He walked toward the window. “There was another boy back at home. Mendel. He was special. He wasn’t scared of me, the sickly kid in the ramshackle house. I would sneak out every night just to see him.” He smiled. “He made me feel special. The way the moonlight would catch on his curls-- The look in his eyes when he caught a frog. Then my dad found out. He was really mad. Furious, even. It wasn’t even the gay thing. That’s the funny bit. He was so upset about me actually having a friend, being vulnerable with another human being.” Tears brimmed his eyes. “That I would let my guard down, leave the risk of someone finding out about- you know. ‘What if one day you eat him alive’, That’s what he said. What he really thinks of me,” He was crying now, tears gently streaming down his face. “I can’t bear to think about what would happen if he actually found out.”</p>
<p>“Remus. You should go to him. Talk to him. Alone. Explain all that.” James spoke softly. </p>
<p>“No, James. You heard Sirius. Kept calling me gay like it was dirty. Like I had done something wrong. I have, in a way.” </p>
<p>“Look I- I don’t know what you want me to say. I’m not some shrink. I’m not a doctor. I can’t diagnose you with gay.” He laughed. </p>
<p>“Not funny.” He choked.</p>
<p>“Remus, it’s 8 in the morning. I don’t understand jack squat about this shit. You just threw me into this situation that I know nothing about and expect me to be all understanding.” He paused. “Let’s go down to breakfast. Get some grub in you.” He walked out the door, expecting Remus to follow.</p>
<p> “Gross. I don’t even like grubs.” He shrugged and sat on the windowsill. Looking out on the grounds, he reminisced. In first year, when he met Sirius and the rest of them for the first time. He had never had a proper friend besides Mendel. They were so nice to him, unafraid. They didn’t know better. Sirius bragged about his state-of-the-art broomstick he had gotten over the summer. James gladly joined in and talked about different models, comparing and contrasting teams. He remembers looking out the windows of the countryside, so beautiful and only slightly different than that of his youth. </p>
<p>Flash forward to year two. The year they found out. It was pointless trying to hide it, he didn’t know why he thought he could. James and Sirius looked at each other with a sick fascination in their eyes, glazed over as they begged him to tell everything. Peter drew back. He hadn’t grown up with the horror stories of Sirius and James. He withdrew himself from them, but eventually came around along with James. Sirius took some more time. But when he did, he really wanted to be there for him. He would sit with him in the library, whispers about how to help. Sneaking into the restricted section under the dark of night. Stealing books not about dark magic, but how to help. How to help him. </p>
<p>Fourth-year, he thought. The year everything shifted. Hormones had struck all of them, yearning this way and that. It was then he realized that he was different in yet another way. He was gay.<br/>
A distinct memory floated into his head.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Remus held Sirius in his arms, curtains drawn. The rain poured down on the castle roof, large claps of thunder scattering through the night. Every single sound sent Sirius further into Remus’s arms, clinging on as if the world was ending. Remus had no idea what this meant for Sirius’s and his friendship, all he knew was that he needed to help Sirius as much as he could. The other boys were fast asleep. Another roll of thunder, and another bright flash of white light. Sirius let out a whimper and cried into Remus’s chest. Remus found his hands drawn to Sirius’s hair, gently running his fingers through the long black mane. “Shhh. It’s okay. I’m here.” Remus whispered. </p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>He wondered if Sirius remembered that. How much he meant to Remus. Remus pulled himself off of the ledge and lumbered his way down into the common room. James and Sirius sat together on a couch, hunched over in a silent conversation. They turned towards him, Sirius quickly turning away in stubbornness. </p>
<p>“Can we talk? Alone?” Remus asked. “Please?” He whispered. </p>
<p>“Sure,” Sirius said. </p>
<p>The two boys followed each other through the portrait hole and stepped into an empty classroom. </p>
<p>Sirius grabbed Remus’s tie and pulled him close and kissed him. Stumbling back, Remus fell onto a desk. “Sirius?” Remus said.<br/>
Remus got up and grabbed Sirius’s head and pressed their mouths together. They hungrily moved into the kiss, desperate for any physical contact. </p>
<p>Sirius checked his watch. “Shit! We’re gonna be late for breakfast” Sirius pulled Remus into a quick peck before rushing out the classroom.</p>
<p>Remus touched his cheek, redder than he had ever been in his life.</p>
