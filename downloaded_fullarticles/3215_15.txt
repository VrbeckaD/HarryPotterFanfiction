  <em>September 23rd, 1996.</em>
</p><p>Harry finds himself in the room of requirement, with his transfiguration books sprawled out, lost in deep thought.</p><p>When he walked in front of the room first, it wouldn't open, he tried again, and then after his third attempt, it finally did.It conjured up a big red couch in one corner of a room filled with what looked like lost things.It was quite dusty, but Harry just gave up and went in. He needed a quiet place to ponder on things, his friends would easily find him at any place within the castle, and he'd have to hear Hermione's lecture on how he should study rather than waste his time.</p><p>No matter how odd and creepy the room looked, he didn't have any choice.</p><p>He thought of snape and his Occlumency lessons.</p><p>he thought of Voldemort</p><p>he thought of <em>cedric</em>.</p><p>He thought of <em>sirius</em>.</p><p>He wept.</p><p> </p><p>Harry saw a sparkling chain in his peripheral vision and got up to grab it. On closer inspection, it looked a lot like a time turner, but larger. And just as he was about to hang it back on to the cupboard nail, the thing stated emitting white fumes.</p><p>Harry immediately dropped the object and summoned his wand and stared at the timepiece with uncertainity.He finally decided to destroy it with a <em>Reducto.</em></p><p>Just as he raised his wand and casted the spell, someone caught his arm.</p><p>"stop! you dolt!!"</p><p>Before he could see, who it was, a blinding light was emitted by the object and everything went black.</p>
