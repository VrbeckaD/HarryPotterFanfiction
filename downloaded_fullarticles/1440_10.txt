    <p>It started one Hollow's Eve, in 1981.</p><p> </p><p>The barely waxing slit in the night shown little light upon the coming horrors this Samhain.</p><p> </p><p>A great evil, by the title of Dark Lord and moniker Voldemort, descended upon the home. Once protected by magic, now revealed by a traitor, nothing was to stop the tragedy to come in Godric's Hollow. And why, might you ask, is the reason for barging into the home so late at night?</p><p> </p><p>A prophecy.</p><p> </p><p>One of an equal, born as the seventh month dies, from those who'd thrice defied him. Foretold to wield a power the Dark Lord knows not.</p><p> </p><p>Such a thing couldn't stand to exist in Voldemort's blood-colored eyes. And thus, he began his storm into the Potter's abode. A flick of his wrist and the husband was dead. He proceeded to follow the red-headed woman into the nursery.</p><p> </p><p>"Please, please! Spare him!" She used her body as a shield, standing between the crib and the monster.</p><p> </p><p>"Move aside." The man used his wand to gesture her away, his tone cold and creaking.</p><p> </p><p>"Please! Not my son! Not my baby!" The woman sobbed as she faced down the Dark Lord with tears in her eyes. She would not be moved.</p><p> </p><p>"Move, or else you will meet the same fate."</p><p> </p><p>"No! Take me instead! Kill me, but don't hurt Harry!" She begged. One could see how she bent her legs, almost on her knees, pleading the (not-quite) man.</p><p> </p><p>Green burst from the pale wand, Voldemort's patience worn thin, and the wife was gone.</p><p> </p><p>But little did he realize what he'd done. He accepted the mother's deal. Which is why, when casting the same killing curse upon the child, magic struck back at him.</p><p> </p><p>Lady Magic takes oaths seriously. Another wizard to break one would have had their magic rended from their bodies, and most probably killed. But Voldemort, cowed by death he was, had split his soul and hid them in items left scattered or guarded. Lady Magic could not take these pieces or their power. So she did the next best thing. She took a piece of the shattering soul and placed it into the babe left crying in his crib, inside a scar that was akin to lighting.</p><p> </p><p>Dark fingers gently his tracing eyebrow and cheekbone, she softly shushed the babe to calm down. "You will do more than survive my child."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh? Then Hecate, you will be able to explain to me why you resurrected the child. You know how I get about my things being touched."</p><p> </p><p>She fluidly, leisurely, turned her head towards Death, one hand still on the child.</p><p> </p><p>"Do not tell me that you are not interested. A child, born to defeat the one that smears your name. He will grow powerful, more powerful than many before him. More powerful than those to oppose him."</p><p> </p><p>"You sound more like a child giving reasons to keep a puppy than a god declaring the future."</p><p> </p><p>"Excuse you? You realize that Tom Riddle will only cause more havoc than he's worth?"</p><p> </p><p>"Since when did you care about sides in the mortal's war?" Death said snidely. Magic was having none of it.</p><p> </p><p>"I do not <em>care</em> for the mortal's war!" She spat in disgust. "What I want is for the wizarding world to be shaken."</p><p> </p><p>This caught Death's interest. "And what, pray tell, do you have in mind?"</p><p> </p><p>"I am sick of so many wizards using me as an excuse to hurt my other creations. My creatures are dying due to their negligence. They say I'm dying because of my new children, as well. They have caused so many wars on my behalf, only to take my power and use it for a selfish gain. I do not mind the murder, war is inevitable, blood is the strongest power when given. I do not favor Light nor Dark. But if things continue the way they are, there will be an extinction, and I won't be as powerful." She turns her head once again to look at the child watching her with wide green eyes. "He will be the one to bring change. I do not care how. But he will."</p><p> </p>
