  <strong>Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived</strong>
</h3><p align="center"> </p><p dir="ltr">      The Potters had many sleepless nights and stressful days. They had a young baby after all. But he was the light in the darkness of war. Little Harry knew nothing of prejudice or hatred. He knew nothing of the fights that had torn Lily’s family apart nor the sickness that had taken James’ parents before they could see their only son wed. Harry was especially ignorant of how close his family was to danger. On this particular night, Harry gummed at the tiny pumpkin his parents had sat him next to in order to take photos. Lily sat on the floor laughing as though it was the funniest thing she’d ever seen.</p><p>      James was perched on the couch with their spoilt cat, a peaceful smile on his face. Here, watching his wife and their son, it was so easy to imagine that they were a normal family instead of one hiding from a genocidal megalomaniac. Despite the happy scene they made, the voice in the back of James’ mind was telling him it could be over any moment.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">-------------------------------------------------- Sirius Black --------------------------------------------------</p><p align="center"> </p><p>      Sirius couldn’t escape the nagging feeling in the back of his mind. He tried to brush it off as he went about his usual work for the Order. After all, he hadn’t felt quite right since Remus had gone missing. Dumbledore didn’t seem to be taking Sirius’ fears, well, seriously. There had to be a spy in their midst. They all knew it. Dumbledore knew it. And now Remus was missing. Sirius had long held the whispers of doubt in his mind - he couldn’t easily play off the secretive disappearances, the long walks in the middle of the night, the full moons Remus insisted on spending alone.</p><p>      Sirius loved Remus. He tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the war was just weighing heavily on him. But then when Sirius asked him anything, Remus couldn’t meet his eyes. There was a constant guilt to his face, a tension whenever he was around Sirius. A flinch whenever Sirius touched him. Eventually, Sirius stopped trying. But he still loved him. That’s what led him to back out of being secret keeper. If Remus was working for Voldemort… it would destroy Sirius. They could use Remus against him. Peter was such a good choice, and he had been so willing. Sirius knew he was just nervous. But he would check on Peter today, like they had agreed.</p><p>      The loud POP! of apparition echoed through the dark safe house. Dark? Why was it dark? It was too early for Peter to be asleep. Peter was always up late into the night. Sirius knew that Peter wasn’t sleeping much these days at all. Peter had told him it was just the war. The nightmares of all the people they’d lost so far.</p><p>      Sirius slipped his wand out of its place, “Lumos.”</p><p>      The whole house was too dark, too quiet, and each room that went by empty filled Sirius with more and more dread. Sirius half expected to find Peter dead. But he truly feared that he wouldn’t find the smaller marauder at all.</p><p>      Finally Sirius reached the bedroom Peter had been using. The door was ajar. Sirius nudged it open. The bed was hastily made. The dresser drawers half open and askew. But empty. The closet was open and just as empty as the dresser.</p><p>      “No… No, it can’t be…”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">-------------------------------------------------- Potter House --------------------------------------------------</p><p align="center"> </p><p>      Lily was halfway up the stairs with Harry when she realized she’d left her wand downstairs, “Oh shoot, James, can you take Harry up? I’ve forgotten my wand downstairs.” James, at the mention of wands, realized they had both gotten too comfortable.</p><p>      “I think I’ve left mine downstairs, too,” he said as he patted his pockets, “Go ahead on up and I’ll get both of ours.” He made a happy face at Harry and kissed him on the head before going back down the stairs. His socked feet barely made a sound as he padded through the dark rooms towards the living room. It felt colder as he rounded the corner. His heart stopped when he realized their door was open.</p><p>      “Lily!” He yelled and turned to go back, but he was stopped by the hooded figure in the darkness.</p><p>      “I’ve found you.” That voice was unmistakable.</p><p>      “Lily!” He’s here!”</p><p>      Lily could hear James screaming for her to take Harry and run. Her hand went to her wand before she remembered that it was still downstairs.</p><p>      “I’ll hold him off!” James’ last words filled her with dread. She thought about apparating, but there was nowhere to go. Remus was missing, Sirius was in hiding, Peter was either dead or… no, there was no use thinking like that now. There was a flash of green and Lily heard a thud. She slammed the door shut - no point in locking it now, was there?</p><p>      There was one hope for her to save Harry. The magic was old. She wasn’t sure how she knew it or if she could pull off such powerful magic without her wand, but she could feel her power surging under her skin. She knelt down in front of the crib.</p><p>      “Harry,” The tears were already streaking hotly down her cheeks, “You are so loved,” She tried desperately not to think about everything she would miss - learning to walk, to ride a bike, to ride a broom, his Hogwarts letter, his first crush, “Mama loves you,” She tried not to think about how he would have to grow up without his parents in a world still burning from this war, “Dada loves you,” Harry already looks so much like James, “Harry, be safe, She put every hope she had into these words, willing them into his very being, “Be strong.”</p><p>      The door blew open and she stood up. She placed herself directly between Voldemort and Harry. Now she just had to seal the spell.</p><p dir="ltr">      “Not Harry - Not Harry, Please, not Harry.” She begged.</p><p>      “Stand aside, you silly girl,” Lily shook her head, “Stand aside, now!”</p><p>      “Not Harry! Please, have mercy…” She took a careful step forward, “have mercy…”</p><p>      Voldemort laughed cruelly and raised his wand. The room flashed green. The echo of Lily’s scream died out and Voldemort made his way towards the crib. He gazed down at the child crying in the crib. He raised his wand once more.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">------------------------------------------------ Godric’s Hollow -----------------------------------------------</p><p align="center"> </p><p>      The quiet neighborhood shook with the sound of an explosion. Muggles and wizards alike rushed to their windows to see what had happened. Bathilda Bagshot was no exception, though she moved a little slower than the others did. Looking out of her door she saw absolute chaos. People were coming out of their houses now, shouting in alarm. The roof of one of the houses had been blown out, but there was no sign of any fire. Bathilda didn’t need to go outside to know whose house it was.</p><p>      She pulled out her wand and sent an urgent message to Dumbledore. It was the only thing she could do, really. Whatever had happened at the Potter’s house was over and done with. The quicker wizards already had their wands out to set the muggles at ease and send them back indoors. None of them moved towards the house. Even though they didn’t know who lived there, they knew it was under Dumbledore’s protection. They would wait until Dumbledore cleared it.</p><p>      Bathilda watched from her window as a young man appeared before the house. She was too far away to know who it was, but she could just make out his shaggy black hair. He carefully made his way up the walk, nudging aside debris.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>      Severus Snape already felt cold and sick as he entered the Potter house. It was the call he had hoped would never come. There in the front room laid James Potter, his normally warm brown skin gone pale, his dark eyes staring off into the distance. Severus would not mourn this particular death. Instead, he stepped over the body and made his way towards the stairs. He allowed himself to hope that James had bought Lily enough time to escape, that the explosion was merely an expression of the Dark Lord’s anger at losing the child.</p><p>      That hope was quickly squashed when he heard the cries coming from upstairs. Severus took the steps slowly. Time seemed to stand still as he made his way down the hall. He saw the hole in the roof first, felt the cold air swirling in. His eyes made their way down to the crib and the small child sobbing uncontrollably. Severus made no move to comfort him. Then he saw her. The sight of her lying there, motionless, knocked the air right out of his lungs.He barely remembered to send a message to Dumbledore, letting him know the situation.</p><p>      Severus tried to go to her but his knees gave out. He knew before he touched her that she was dead. Severus cradled Lily’s body close to him as he broke down. He was crying now too, “No. No, no, no, no.”</p><p>      He stayed like that until a shadow fell over him. Looking up, he saw an enormous figure that could only be Hagrid.</p><p>      “Ye’ve got t’ let go,” Hagrid’s voice was gruffer than usual, filled with emotion, “Dumbledore’ll be wantin’ ye.” Severus nodded, but made no move for several moments. Finally, he set Lily down. With one last look, he stood up and fled the scene. He waited until he was back outside to apparate.</p><p>      Hagrid did his best not to disturb Lily as he moved towards Harry. He picked up a warm looking blanket from the basket under the crib and used to to wrap up the baby. Hagrid rocked back and forth, trying to keep Harry calm. Once Harry had settled down and fallen asleep, Hagrid started down the stairs. He was nearly to the door when the great roar of a motorbike filled the air. Hagrid met Sirius halfway down the walk.</p><p>      “Sirius? What are you doin’ ‘ere?” Hagrid ask.</p><p>      “I came to get, Harry,” Sirius spotted the infant, “I’m his godfather. It’s what… It’s what James and Lily would have wanted.”</p><p>Hagrid hesitated.</p><p>      Sirius’ voice filled with emotion, “I’m his godfather, Hagrid! Give him to me.”</p><p>      Hagrid shook his head, “Can’t. Dumbledore’s orders. I’m to bring him to Dumbledore straight away.”</p><p>      Dumbledore. Right. Dumbledore knew what he was doing. Sirius hadn’t realized he had been reaching for Harry. He put his hands back down, “Right. Best to do what Dumbledore says. Take my motorbike, Hagrid. It’ll be faster.”</p><p>      Hagrid seemed to consider it for a moment, “Alrigh’”</p><p>      Once Hagrid had settled Harry in and taken off, Sirius lost control. He had told himself to keep a level head, to be strong, for Harry. Because Harry needed him. But Harry didn’t need him right this moment. Without the weight of responsibility, Sirius caved into his own desires. He had to find Peter. Now.</p><p>      It took him nearly the whole day to find Peter. Sirius was surprised to see him, not only alive, but relatively unharmed. Peter sitting amongst a rather large celebration - twitching and nervous with a fake smile plastered onto his face. If Peter was a live it could only mean one thing.</p><p>      Peter had betrayed them.</p><p>      Sirius saw red. Rage bubbled up. The whole time, the whole bloody time, Sirius had thought it was Remus who had turned traitor. Peter, one of their closest friends since the very beginning, had watched the suspicious tear Sirius apart. Peter had watched as his friends were driven apart by fear, guilt, suspicion… he had watched them all suffer. And then he used their weaknesses to his advantage. Sirius, being afraid that Voldemort would use Remus against him, had let Peter become the secret keeper. Sweet Peter. Who would ever suspect him?</p><p>      When Peter left the pub, Sirius was right behind him. He followed him down into an alley, where Peter had turned and was waiting for him.</p><p>      “Sirius!” Peter tried to pretend to be happy to see Sirius, but his eyes betrayed his own fears, desperately searching for an exit.</p><p>      “How could you?” Sirius said, “How DARE you?”</p><p>      “Sirius? Sirius, please…”</p><p>      Sirius had his wand out now, “I would have died before… You should have died. It should be you instead of them.”</p><p>      Peter’s lip quivered, “I had to, Sirius… I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…”</p><p>      The next thing Sirius knew, his head was colliding with one of the brick walls. Where Peter had been standing was a burnt and smoking crater. Debris was falling everywhere. From the looks of it, the blast had taken out several people. Sirius rushed to the crater to see if… there! A Finger! Did Peter… But no, Sirius could see a rat scurrying away from the ditch. Sirius tried to give chase, but he found himself surrounded by aurors, their wands pointing at him.</p><p>      Sirius couldn’t help but laugh. They had all thought Peter was the sweet, caring one. He was the one full of love and light. Always soft. Sometimes a little slow, sure, but sweet. But in the end, he had pulled the biggest trick of all. He’d fooled everyone, and he’d get away with it too. He knew the picture this painted. Sirius, covered in soot, his eyes red from crying, standing in the middle of a blast and a single finger… People always underestimated Peter. He was just as smart, just as cunning and capable. He knew that Sirius would make an excellent scapegoat. And now, no one would believe Sirius was innocent.</p><p>      Sirius would only let himself think of Harry later. When he let it all hit him. When he let the pain and sadness rise up to overwhelm him. He blamed himself. After all, it had been Sirius who had suggested the change to Peter as secret keeper. It had been Sirius who ignored that nagging in the back of his mind. It had been Sirius who was too late. Too late to discover Peter. Too late to Godric’s Hollow. Too late to capture Peter. He had failed. He’d failed James. And Lily. He’d failed Remus.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">-------------------------------------------------- Remus Lupin -------------------------------------------------</p><p align="center"> </p><p>      News travelled quickly. By morning, Remus had heard news of You-Know-Who’s demise. The sad news had yet to reach him. Remus celebrated in the streets with the others witches and wizards, meeting up with other Order members who had been nearby. It wasn’t until later that he heard their names whispered with quiet reverence.</p><p>      “What’s that then?” Remus asked, still smiling, a drink in hand.</p><p>      “I was just saying it was the Potter boy, Harry Potter, who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”</p><p>      Remus laughed, “You must mean James,” Of course James would find a way to win the war, even from hiding. It would be nice to see them both again. Being deep undercover meant that he could never visit any of his friends. It had been too long since he’d seen Lily smile, heard James’ ridiculous jokes. And Harry must be getting so big now, “Harry is their son, the baby.”</p><p>      “Yes, the boy. Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived.”</p><p>      The smile slid from his face. That didn’t make sense. It wasn’t possible. Harry was just a baby, “The… the Boy Who Lived?”</p><p>      The wizard nodded, “Yes, sad really. Apparently You-Know-Who came to kill the Potters. The parents both died, poor dears. But when You-Know-Who tried to kill the boy, it didn’t work. Backfired. And that’s the end of that, I tell you.”</p><p>      “Excuse me-” Remus left in a hurry, feeling like he was going to hurl. How could no one have told him? How could they let him celebrate when… No, it can’t be true. Remus hit the ground in Godric’s Hollow with the loud POP! of apparition. The site he found there brought him to his knees. The house he’d been to, only once or twice, in shambles, roof tiles littering the yard. But if… If You-Know-Who had found them, that meant that Sirius… No, God, not Sirius, too.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">-------------------------------------------------- Privet Drive -------------------------------------------------</p><p align="center"> </p><p>      A gray tabby perched on a wall outside of the Dursley’s house. She stared off into the distance, unblinking/ Anyone watching would think the cat was a statue, if it weren’t for the slight tail twitches every so often. Her eyes never moved from the corner. It wasn’t until near midnight that she moved from her spot.</p><p>      A pop echoed down the empty street. Right on the spot the cat was watching appeared a man n flowing purple robes and high heeled buckled boots, Albus Dumbledore. His beard and hair were long and silvery with age. He rummaged about his pockets and sleeves, seemingly looking for something. Before he could find it, he looked up and made eye contact with the cat.</p><p>      “I should have known.” He chuckled. Then he found what he was looking for and with a flick, the lights on the street went out. In the comfort of darkness, he addressed the cat, “Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”</p><p>      The tabby cat was replaced by a rather grim looking woman in rich emerald green robes. Her hair was pulled back into a tight bun. Despite being in cat form all day, her appearance showed none of the ruffled distress she was currently feeling.</p><p>      “How did you know it was me?” She asked, the lilt of her accent coming through as Distinctly Scottish.</p><p>      “My dear Professor,” he smiled serenely, gazing at her over the tops of his half moon glasses,  “I have never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”</p><p>      “You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day.” McGonagall snipped.</p><p>      “All day?” Dumbledore didn’t seem the least bit surprised, “When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”</p><p>      McGonagall pushed down the angry retort with a sniff, “Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right. You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no. Even the Muggle’s have noticed. It’s been all over their news. Flocks of owls, shooting stars down in Kent - I’ll wager that was Dedalus Diggle. Never had much sense, that one.”</p><p>      Dumbledore laid a gentle hand on her shoulder, “You can’t blame them. We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.”</p><p>      “I know that!” she said irritably, “But people are being downright careless, out on the streets in broads daylight, not even trying to dress in Muggle clothes. And the rumors!” She glanced sideways at him, “I suppose he really has gone, You-Know-Who?”</p><p>      “It seems so,” Dumbledore said as he offered her a Muggle sweet.</p><p>      “You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared?” This was the part that McGonagall was most anxious to talk about. She needed to know. Why else would she be out here all day, in the cold, sitting on a hard brick wall. She refused to believe the rumours until she heard it from Dumbledore’s own mouth.</p><p>      But Dumbledore was rather stubbornly attending to his candies, so McGonagall pushed through, “They’re saying that last night Voldemort turned up at Godric’s Hollow. The rumor is that James and Lily Potter are…” She took a minute to gather herself. These were her students, children she had watched grow up and be turned into soldiers by a war they never signed up for, “That they’re dead.”</p><p>      Dumbledore bowed his head, the only sign that he had been listening at all.</p><p>      “No… Lily and James… I can’t… I didn’t want to believe it… Albus…” She took a shaky breath to still herself. She couldn’t let the grief set in, not yet, “That’s not all. They’re saying that he tried to kill the Potters’ son, but he… couldn’t. That Voldemort’s power broke and that’s why he’s gone.”</p><p>      Dumbledore nodded.</p><p>      “It’s-it’s true?” McGonagall could hardly believe it. After all the people that Voldemort had killed, how was it that a little boy could stop him? “That’s astounding… of all the things to stop him… but how in the name of Merlin did Harry survive?”</p><p>      Dumbledore shrugged, “We may never know.”</p><p>      McGonagall pulled out a handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes underneath her spectacles while Dumbledore pulled out his golden pocket watch. He watched as the little planets rotated around, closed it, and put it back in his pocket.</p><p>      “Hagrid’s late. I suppose he told you I’d be here.”</p><p>      “Yes,” McGonagall said, “And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?”</p><p>      “I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. He’s the only family he has left now.”</p><p>      “You don’t mean-” McGonagall looked back at the house in disbelief, “You can’t mean the people who live here. Dumbledore, you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You can’t find two people who are less like us. Harry Potter, come and live here?”</p><p>      “It’s the best place for him,” Dumbledore seemed certain of this, “His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.”</p><p>      “A letter?” McGonagall said faintly. How on earth could a letter possibly explain James and Lily Potter? Who they were, the tragedy that was their loss? The miracle that was Harry living? How on earth could a letter make up for the years spent away from magic? “You think you can explain this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous - a legend - I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day. There will be books written… every child in our world will know his name.”</p><p>      “Exactly. Famous before he can walk and talk. Famous for something he won’t even remember. Can’t you see how much better of he’ll be, away from all of that until he’s old enough to take it?”</p><p>      McGonagall sighed and let it go. Soon, the low rumble of a motorcycle could be heard off in the distance. It grew louder until a large motorcycle descended out of the sky and landed right in front of them. Hagrid dismounted and greeted the two professors.</p><p>      “Where did you get that motorcycle?” Dumbledore asked</p><p>      “Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir. Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir. Fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.”</p><p>      They all gathered to look at the sleeping bundle in Hagrid’s arms. Harry was light skinned, not the soft porcelain his mother had been, but not the darker brown that JAmes had been either. His hair was jet-black and tousled from sleep and wind. In the darkness, McGonagall could just make out the hint of a scar. Dumbledore took Harry from Hagrid’s arms, letting the man say goodbye, for now. With his wand in one hand, he conjured a basket large enough to and cushioned enough to cradle the little lad, and set the basket on the doorstep. Then her bent and tucked a letter into the blankets.</p><p>      The three grown wizards stood at the garden wall and watched for a few minutes. The weight of the past two days settled onto them.</p><p>      “Well,” Dumbledore said, that’s that.”</p><p>      Hagrid said his goodbyes and the motorcycle roared out of the neighborhood. Dumbledore walked to the end of the street, took out the Put-Outer and returned light to the street. Then, with whispered well wishes, he was gone. McGonagall returned to the wall.</p><p>      Harry rolled over in his basket, completely unaware of what he’d lost. His hand gripped gently at the envelope that was expected to explain his tragedies. Dumbledore and Hagrid had left to join the celebrations. But Minerva could not celebrate. Instead, she sat and watched Harry.</p><p>      In cat form, she could not shed tears that so desperately wanted to come. James and Lily had been her students. She had watched them grow up, learn to fly, make friends, fall in love. She had watched the coming war make them weary and worn. Had watched them grow fearful. Minerva had seen how they grasped at the chances to be happy - getting married younger than they might have otherwise, starting a family with the time that they had, not knowing if the next day would come for them. Minerva had never thought that they wouldn’t be here. She knew it was silly. So many of her students had died already. What was two more names?</p><p>      Minerva watched from her perch until the morning came. Until Petunia opened the door and screamed in surprise to see a baby there. Minerva prayed she was wrong and that Dumbledore was right. She hoped that the Dursleys would care for Harry. He had already lost so much. He deserved so much better.</p>
