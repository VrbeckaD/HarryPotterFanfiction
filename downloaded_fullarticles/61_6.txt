    <p>The tenth year anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts was coming up. Harry Potter still blamed himself for the events of the war, even if everyone kept saying it wasn't his fault. He had nightmares almost every night. It was always the same dream. Harry getting killed by Voldemort in the forest. He couldn't bring himself to take Dreamless Sleep because he knew based on his nightmares, he'd get addicted.</p><p>It felt as if nothing had changed yet everything did.</p><p>Him and Ginny Weasley broke up a year after the war. She had told him, "I think we should both move on, Harry. But I'll always love you." They were still good friends, as good as they can be after dating for a year and a half. It hurt Harry to see her with another man but he knew she was happier now without him. She was currently the Chaser for the Holyhead Harpies, and a bloody good one.</p><p>Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger got married and had their first kid two years ago. They named her Rose Granger-Weasley. They were currently expecting their second child. The Trio had slowly distanced themselves since the war. Ron and Hermione were more focused on their family and Harry on his job as Head Auror. Ron had worked as an Auror but decided to stop once he and Hermione found out they were gonna have a kid.</p><p>Teddy Lupin was ten years old and growing up with his grandmother instead of his parents. He knew what his parents died for, but he missed them everyday. Harry, being Teddy's godfather, visited whenever he could but never stayed for too long as he was reminded of Remus and Tonks and how he couldn't help them. Teddy asked for stories of his parents, Harry would try his best without crying but always ended up with tears down his cheeks.</p><p>Draco Malfoy was actually nice now that his father was in Azkaban. The thing was, now that his father was gone, he seems happier. He looks happier too, though the same he did during his seventh year (from all the products he uses, Harry assumed). He had been training as a Healer, taking after his mother, and had become Head Healer. He and Harry met up occasionally to discuss new procedures, like new healing spells Harry had to teach the others. After those meetings, they always went out to eat or just to talk. They had gotten rather close over the years.</p><p>And Harry Potter was the Master of Death.</p><p>He hadn't figured it out until one day on an Auror mission when he got hit with the Killing Curse, but didn't die. When he went to check where the Elder Wand was, he found it wasn't in Dumbledore's grave like it should've been. Then he realized he had it on him the whole time, wearing it as a bracelet. He had all the Hallows on him at all times. And he couldn't take the metal bracelet off. He should've realized it earlier but it never occurred to him that the bracelet he had been wearing the whole time, not able to take off, was holding the three Hallows.</p><p>He wasn't aging which he didn't notice until about 6 years ago. It really pissed him off.</p><p>It was a stressful thought, all your friends being able to die but not you. Them, all looking older and you still looking 17. Them, being able to get drinks with no question and you having to pull out your ID because you look so damn young when in reality, you're their same age. Okay, maybe not so much the last one.</p><p>Minerva McGonagall had asked Harry to make a speech at the banquet the school was hosting in honor of the anniversary of the war. Of course, Harry had to accept. He even included Hermione in writing it since he had no clue what to write about. He knew it had to be some 'we survived and we should be grateful' kinda thing, but having Hermione helping was always a good thing.</p><p>When he arrived at the banquet, Draco Malfoy and Teddy Lupin were the only ones there. Harry walked up to them and looked at Teddy.</p><p>"Hey, Ted," Harry said.</p><p>Teddy looked at Harry and smiled widely before hugging him, "Hi, Harry!"</p><p>Harry held Teddy for a while but let go before it would get too long and too suspicious. He turned to Draco, "Where's Andromeda?"</p><p>"She's sick so she asked me to bring Teddy with me." Draco had changed over the years. He visited Teddy at least once a week (from what Andromeda told him), always bringing him something new every visit. Of course, the Malfoy reputation had been severely damaged after the war, but he was slowly rebuilding it. His mother had died two years after the war, so he was the only one left of the Malfoy bloodline considering Lucius was on a life sentence in Azkaban. The Malfoy fortune had been left to him and he was putting it to good use. He donated money to St Mungo's, to Hogwarts, to small businesses who needed something to start them off, orphanages, and basically everything he saw that needed help. He was a changed man.</p><p>"Oh, that was nice of you."</p><p>"Why're you here so early?" Draco asked while turning to look at Teddy who was staring between them.</p><p>"McGonagall asked me to come early. I don't really understand why. But, whatever. What about you?"</p><p>"I'm making a speech once this thing starts. I was really confused as to why at first, but I figured it out later. She wants people to realize that not all ex-Death Eaters are bad, or something," Draco shrugged, seeming to be rather calm as an ex-Death Eater, though he still wore long-sleeves to basically everywhere he went to cover the Dark Mark. "Are you making a speech? I'm assuming you are, considering you're the one to thank for us being alive."</p><p>"Yeah. I'm making a speech. No surprise there. I'm more surprised that McGonagall didn't ask me until like three days ago." Harry chuckled slightly.</p><p>"Really? She asked me like two weeks ago. Maybe she knows you have experience writing essays twenty minutes before you have to turn it in." Draco smiled.</p><p>"Alright, that was one time! And I told you that in confidence, I didn't think you'd use that against me," Harry pouted.</p><p>Draco burst out laughing, "Oh my god! You do realize how actually stupid you are?"</p><p>"Git," Harry mumbled.</p><p>"No cursing in front of the child, <em>Harry</em>."</p><p>At that, Teddy pouted and crossed his arms over his chest, "I'm not a child! I'm a big boy who's going to Hogwarts next year!"</p><p>"You're absolutely right, Ted."</p><p>"And no child would be able to detect the sexual tension going on between you two," Teddy mumbled, but both of the men picked it up.</p><p>"<em>What</em>?" The men shrieked at the same time.</p><p>"Oh. I didn't think that was a secret. I thought everyone knew."</p><p>"There's nothing going on between us, Teddy," Draco chuckled somewhat nervously.</p><p>"Okay. Whatever you say," Teddy smirked and went to check out the food.</p><p align="center">-</p><p>When Draco was called up to make his speech, everyone went quiet. He looked out at everyone sitting at the tables. He briefly made eye contact with Harry, who gave him an encouraging smile, and Teddy before he spoke up.</p><p>"My name is Draco Malfoy, but I'm assuming you all know that. My father, Lucius Malfoy, was a Death Eater. He was the Dark Lord's right-hand-man, some would say. It was my father that forced me into getting the Dark Mark. I didn't want it. But that didn't stop my father or the Dark Lord from giving it to me. I still have it as a constant reminder of my mistakes. And my fathers. The war with the Dark Lord is a constant reminder that there are people who want us gone. But we can't fight that. I get screamed at everyday. I know people want me gone. I understand that. Believe me, sometimes I want me gone too. But then I remember that instead of wanting to die, we should live. We should live so the lives we lost during the Battle don't go unforgotten. I remember that there are things worth living for. Like family. Friends. Partners. When my mother past away, I thought to myself that I deserved to die. I would say, 'I'd die if it meant my mother would come back'. But if I did that, she'd carry the guilt that I didn't want anymore. So instead, I've decided I'm going to live for Narcissa Malfoy. I think she'd like it better that way. I think all those who we lost would like it better like that. Don't wish it was you. Don't wish you could switch places with them. Instead, decided to live for them. It's really truly better that way," He looked up and blinked a couple times to get rid of the tears, "Okay, well. I'm not supposed to make this a sappy story that'll make you feel bad about me and my sad life. So, instead let's all bask in the happiness we've surrounded ourselves with in these past years. Some would say we survived the hard part, but that's wrong. The hard part is getting used to life without the people we lost. It's learning to be happy again. From what I know of a couple of you, you've done that. So, congratulations. We're still here. Let's celebrate that." Draco smiled awkwardly, clenching a fist by his side.</p><p>He looked down for a second and canceled the Sonorous charm silently. As he was looking down, someone started clapping. When he looked back up, his eyes basically left his head.</p><p>Draco had expected it to be Harry or Teddy, seeing as they were his only two friends. But he never would've guess that the applause would be started by George Weasley.</p><p>Following his lead, Harry Potter joined in along with Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Teddy Lupin, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, and many others.</p><p>By the time he got off the stage, he received many pats on the backs, nods of approvals and the sort. He went back to his seat in between Teddy and Harry. He had been really surprised when he had been invited by Hermione Granger to sit with them but had suspected it only had to do with the fact that he was Teddy's guardian for the night.</p><p>He had been even more surprised with the fact that when he was about to sit down, Harry had pulled him into a hug. Everyone was silenced by the hug. Draco didn't know what to do except accept the hug.</p><p>He hadn't even realized he started crying until after he let go and Teddy has reached up to wipe his tears.</p><p align="center">-</p><p align="left">Harry smiled at Draco before he walked up to make his speech. He cast the Sonorous charm before he started, "Alright, so, um. I don't really know how I can top that," He chuckled a bit, "So, I'm gonna go completely off-script, sorry 'Mione, and just keep this hopefully somewhat short. I grew up with my Muggle relatives, my Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and cousin Dudley. I grew up treated like a house elf. I was forced to do the chores in the house, waking up terribly early to make breakfast and going to bed late after dinner had been cleaned up and the dishes were back in the cabinets. I slept in the cupboard under the stairs until I turned eleven when I first received my Hogwarts letter. Hogwarts was my home, since I couldn't really call the cupboard or Dudley's second room a home. I found out that the Wizarding world community knew more about me than I did. The Wizarding community treated me like a king, when I wasn't. I was only a boy who suddenly had the weight of a whole other world on his shoulders. People to this day thank me for what I did. But all I did was die. I reversed Voldemort's spell so it backfired upon himself. It was everyone else. It was Neville Longbottom, who killed Nagini, the last Horcrux. It was Ron Weasley who found the Gryffindor sword. It was Hermione Granger, who without we'd probably all died the second we stepped onto the '<em>battlefield</em>'. It was Luna Lovegood who told me to look not in Ravenclaw tower, but to speak to the Grey Lady, Helena Ravenclaw. It was Draco Malfoy for throwing me his wand after I came back from the dead. It was Narcissa Malfoy who said I was dead when in reality I wasn't. It was everyone else besides me. I don't think any of us would be here if it wasn't for everyone else. I think that if Hagrid hadn't come knocking down the door at the cabin in the middle of nowhere, I wouldn't be here. But all of you would. Everyone here was the main reason we're all here. It wasn't a one-man job. It was a job for a whole damn village. It was everyone. We're all here because we did this as a team. And we bloody well better appreciate that. I don't want to talk about those who we lost, because we all lost someone. Think about those still here. Don't think about Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks. Think about Teddy Lupin, who's still here. Don't think about Fred Weasley, think about George Weasley. Think about everything we have left. Those who we lost will always be in our hearts. But don't think about them so much that it takes over your world. Like Draco said, live for them instead," He stopped to take a breath, chuckling a bit,"I said I'd keep this somewhat short but that obviously didn't happen. So, I'm just gonna say, we're here. Be grateful. Thank you."</p><p>Teddy was the first to start clapping, followed by Draco, Hermione, Ron, George, Neville, Luna and everyone else. Harry got off stage. He smiled at everyone who looked at him and made his way back to his seat.</p><p>As soon as he sat down, a click was heard. Then a trigger being pulled. Then a gunshot.</p><p>People were screaming. Wands were out, all pointed at the man with the gun, Andrew Creevey, father of Colin and Dennis Creevey. Harry pulled his wand out, ready to cast spells to detain him when Draco fell limply on Harry's body. Draco had been shot.</p><p>"Oh, fuck, uh.." Harry gently set Draco on the floor, making sure his back was facing up, seeing as the bullet hit his backside. "Someone detain him! Who here is a Healer?! We need a Healer!" Although Aurors were trained in simple healing spells, they caught Dark Wizards and chances that Dark Wizards have a gun on them are slim to none so they didn't learn how to heal gunshots. Hannah Abbott, a healer that worked at St Mungo's and that had married Neville Longbottom, ran over and cast some spells, the only one Harry recognized was the diagnostic spell.</p><p>Harry stood up and held his wand up to Mr Creevey who had been detained by Ron and Neville, who had also been an Auror before switching to be the Herbology Professor at Hogwarts.</p><p>"Why'd you shoot him?!" He growled, not noticing that the wand he held wasn't the Holly wand, but instead it was the Elder Wand. He hadn't even noticed the screams had been replaced by whispers along the lines of 'that's the wand You-Know-Who used in the final battle'.</p><p>"It's his fault the Death Eaters got into Hogwarts and that Dumbledore is dead! If he had still been here, my Colin would still be alive. He deserves to die!"</p><p><em>He hurt Draco, </em>he's<em> the one who deserves to die.</em></p><p>That's another thing. Every time he wielded the Elder Wand, whispers were constantly telling him to do bad things. In this case, he actually listened to them. There's a reason it's also called the Deathstick.</p><p>Without using any hesitation, he whispered, "Sectumsempra."</p><p>Mr Creevey fell to the ground, bleeding from the scars that Harry had made.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Ron and Neville immediately tried to heal the cuts, yet none of the spells worked. Hannah, who had finished healing Draco had run over and cast the right spells along with McGonagall and Pomfrey who rushed over.</p><p>Harry got on his knees next to Draco who was slowly coming back into consciousness.</p><p>"Harry?" He heard a small voice from next to him, causing him to look up and see Teddy looking at him with wide eyes filled with fear. "You hurt Mr Creevey."</p><p>"He hurt Draco." Harry said quietly, turning back to look at Draco. "Hey, hey, hey, how are you?" He whispered.</p><p>"'m fine. What happened?" Draco mumbled.</p><p>"You were shot. Hannah Abbott healed you."</p><p>"Yes, she was always good at healing gunshot wounds." Harry couldn't tell if that was sarcasm or not but he doubted this was a good time to ask.</p><p>By the time Draco and Harry stood back up, nearly every wizard had their wand pointed at Harry.</p><p>"He deserved it, don't tell me otherwise." Harry scowled.</p><p>"He didn't!" Ron yelled, obviously angered by his best friend hurting a man who in his mind did nothing wrong. "If anything, we should have left Malfoy to die!"</p><p>"Well maybe you should've!" Draco yelled back, then turned to look at Harry, "Harry, say goodbye to Teddy," he whispered.</p><p>Harry nodded and pulled Teddy to him as Draco held his wand up to protect them.</p><p>"Ted, you know I would never hurt you. I love you with my whole heart and I'm sorry." Harry whispered, not wanting anyone else to hear him.</p><p>"You're leaving me? I don't care if you hurt someone, I don't want you to leave me. My parents already left me, now my godfather and my cousin are gonna leave me?" Teddy frowned, tears already forming in his eyes.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, Ted. You know I want to stay with you but I ca — <em>we</em> can't. I'm going to be sent to Azkaban for attempted murder if I stay. And Draco already stood up for me so he's gonna be hated for everything. We can't stay here."</p><p>Teddy nodded reluctantly before hugging Harry tightly, "I love you, Harry."</p><p>"I love you too, Teddy. And so do your parents, remember that. Tell your Gran to tell you more stories. Or Hermione, Ron or even McGonagall once you go to Hogwarts. I love you so, so, so much." Harry placed a kiss on his forehead before switching places with Draco.</p><p>"Harry James Potter, you're being sentenced to a lifetime in Azkaban for the murder of Tom Marvolo Riddle, attempted murder of Andrew Dennis Creevey and for assisting in the murder of Cedric Eldritch Diggory." An Auror that had hated Harry since the moment he became an Auror spoke. "Hand over your wand or wands immediately."</p><p>Draco had finished speaking to Teddy by the time the Auror was rushing over to them. Harry grabbed Draco's hand and they apparated away.</p><p align="center">-</p><p>Two years later, nothing had changed.</p><p>The Ministry was still after Draco and Harry. Draco and Harry had established that they both liked each other and had been dating for a year and a half. They moved location every week. The Ministry had no idea where they were, but once they had an idea, Draco and Harry were gone the next day. The Ministry had even gotten the American Ministry of Magic to help them, even though they were never near America. They stayed in Europe, though never in the same city.</p><p>Harry had always wondered why Draco stayed the same without his hair or skin products. He had asked Draco about it but he never answered.</p><p>"He made me," Draco spoke up, "He made me make a Horcrux. That's why I never age. He told me that if he died, I'd be the one to carry out his plans since I was the son of his right-hand-man. I tried to tell my father to convince him not to. But it didn't work. The Dark Lord told me that he'd kill my mother if I didn't do it. So, of course I did it. After he was destroyed, my mother and I achieved a couple things. One was a spell that would transfer the fragment of the soul to a different item, and I did that since I didn't want the the Malfoy heir ring to be a Horcrux. Another was a way to keep the Horcrux, while keeping me sane. We did do it. And the last was to to cancel the change in mood for whoever held it. But, I can't keep it. I wanna destroy it."</p><p>Harry was silent for a bit before speaking up, "Give it to me. The piece of your soul. I love you so much and I don't want to be on this world alone. I can't die because I'm the Master of Death, so give it to me."</p><p>"Are you sure? I could never do that to you." Draco looked up at Harry with concerned eyes.</p><p>"Yeah. You can put it on the Hallows bracelet, it never comes off and it can't be destroyed. Okay?"</p><p>"Okay." Draco smiled a bit reluctantly.</p><p> </p>
