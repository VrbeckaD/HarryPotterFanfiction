    <p>“You don’t understand Hermione” Tom said in frustration. He was 18 now, he could make this decision. He had been saving up for it for his whole life, though his father offered to pay for it himself.</p><p>“Tom, you look fine the way you are, why do you have to change your appearance?” Hermione asked standing infront of him, arms crossed. “Yes, your father has good looks, but they aren’t everything.”</p><p>“No, they aren’t everything Hermione, but women like pretty men.”</p><p>“I think you are good looking” she said.</p><p>Tom sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose “you are only saying that because you are my friend. I’m doing this Hermione. I don’t want to be like my mother, ugly and unwanted.”</p><p>“You aren’t unwanted Tom; I like you just the way you are”</p><p>Tom said nothing, watching her quietly.</p><p>Finally, she sighed softly “ok, I’ll be there for you… you know I will” she whispered.</p><p>___</p><p>The day of the surgery had been fast approaching and every day that past the knot in her stomach tightened.</p><p>She hated this, him changing himself, and he wouldn’t even tell her the real reason.</p><p>He was in love with a girl and didn’t think she would care about him back.</p><p>She and found it out from Abraxas, and she felt her heart break at the news.</p><p>Tom was in love.</p><p>She had been his friend since they were children, had loved him for nearly as long, but in the end, he didn’t see her as anything more then a friend, a supporter.</p><p>She wondered who it was, it keeping her up the night before surgery. Who would be shallow enough not to see past Tom’s looks? To see the man beneath?</p><p>She compiled a list of girls in her head, unable to think who it could possibly be. Maybe Lavender brown…</p><p>The day of the surgery she gave him a smile, telling him it would go well, she would be waiting the whole time.</p><p>He nodded back, giving her hand a squeeze” Thank you” he said softly.</p><p>She nodded, her heart aching as they took him back to prep.</p><p>She sat in the waiting room for hours, wondering if when he recovered, when he got with whoever it was would he still talk to her? Would he forget her?</p><p>Hermione wasn’t stupid. She knew she wasn’t the prettiest girl, but she had never let that bother her. Not until now, knowing that Tom would soon be able to get any woman he wanted.</p><p>She went to the bathroom and cried, unable to help it, her heart aching, knowing it was just a matter of time.</p><p>Once Tom was finished with surgery she was allowed back to the back, his face wrapped in bandages. The doctors said it would be a few weeks, but the surgery was successful.</p><p>Tom had never seemed happier.</p><p>__</p><p>The weeks passed and Hermione spent every second she could with Tom, knowing it would end too soon.</p><p>He asked her to come with him to the final checkup and she agreed.</p><p>He held her hand as the doctors unwrapped his face, showing him his features.</p><p>If Hermione was honest, she would say he was more attractive then even his father. Tom smiled brightly, looking at Hermione who smiled back, though it didn’t reach her eyes.</p><p>“No one could turn me down now” he said softly to himself, but she heard it. She said nothing.</p><p>She withdrew from him after that, letting him be, trying not to hear the gossip, but she still caught snippets, the girls at school loving his new looks, fan Girling over him.</p><p>She closed her locker as, yet another mob of girls surrounded him.</p><p>Abraxas leaned against the locked next to hers, watching Tom being flirted with “He hasn’t asked her, yet you know. You still could tell him”</p><p>Hermione scoffed, looking at the girls, at how tom smiled, liking the attention “I couldn’t compete with that. He did this for a girl Brax. I loved him as he was, and I didn’t hide it. He didn’t need me to say it out loud, I showed it every day, ever since we were children. I wasn’t good enough. To him, I’m as ugly as his mother.” She tore her eyes away from the scene infront of her, trying not to cry, to keep herself together “I wasn’t good enough.”</p><p>Abraxas frowned “Hermione…” he whispered putting a hand on her shoulder, but she shrugged him off.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. In a few weeks we will graduate, and I will move away from this place. He’ll forget about me and go on to have a wonderful life.” She said, “I have to go.” She brushed past him, unable to help it as she overheard one of the girls ask him out.</p><p>She didn’t stick around to hear the answer.</p>
