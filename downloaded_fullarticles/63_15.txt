    <p>When Draco arrived at the house, he thought he had surely made a mistake. He stood with one foot on the ground, the other still poised over the pedal of his bike. Part of him was tempted to get back on, keep on pedaling.</p><p>He sighed and fully dismounted from his bike. He no longer had the luxury of depending on his family; he was on his own now, and this was the first housing situation he’d found that fit his budget and was less than a mile from campus.</p><p>“It’s only a year,” he grumbled to himself.</p><p>He leaned his bike on the little gate at the end of the tiny fenced yard. Despite his initial impression, the closer he got to the house, the more he liked it.</p><p>It was admittedly a very old house, at least a few centuries. Drains rusted and clogged with the first autumn leaves, roof tiles discolored, paint in need of a fresh coat. A few window A/C units dotted the faced, and Draco didn’t even want to think of the state of the plumbing. But the fence was in good repair, didn’t squeak, and the yard was trim and well-kept, although upon second glance he saw it was almost all moss and clover. He could imagine the snooty, judgmental looks of his neighbors if they had seen this yard, but he liked it, it was kind of quaint. Besides, wasn’t he trying to get away from that kept life?</p><p>Under the windows on the right of the door, the last of the summer flowers bloomed in profusion, filling the air with their heady perfume. To the left of the front door, a wide porch sprawled, covered in bicycles, spare bicycle parts, and low wicker chairs. He walked up the stairs, expecting them to groan, but pleasantly surprised, and rang the bell, which sounded inside the house with a low “bong.”</p><p>After barely a few seconds, a pretty young woman in a white button-down shirt and pleated skirt answered the door. Draco tried to keep his face composed, because she was really one of the most striking people he’d ever seen. She was on the tall side, probably 5’10” or 5’11”. She had a beautiful curvy figure that Draco tried to ignore, dark brown skin that reminded Draco of polished wood, and a glorious mane of chocolate brown curls. Her light brown eyes took him in at a glance.</p><p>“Draco?”</p><p>“Yes, sorry. I’m here about the room.”</p><p>Her eyes flicked past him to his bike leaning on the outside of the fence. “Is that your bike?”</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>“You might want to bring it up to the porch. You wouldn’t be the first to have something stolen in broad daylight.”</p><p>Draco nodded and stepped quickly down the steps, lifting the bike over the fence. He carried it up the steps, fitting the front wheel into an empty slot of the bike rack.</p><p>He looked back at the young woman. “Didn’t realize it was such a bad neighborhood.”</p><p>She shrugged one shoulder in a gesture Draco found unspeakably elegant and cool. “I mean, no one’s been stabbed, as far as I know. Stuff just goes missing sometimes, you know? I’m Hermione, by the way.” She held out one slim hand.</p><p>Draco surreptitiously wiped his hand off on his jeans before taking hers, afraid of a sweaty palm. Her hand felt warm in his, soft. She had long slim fingers and her nails were short and trim, no polish.</p><p>She showed him into the house. The inside was much nicer than the outside, cozy and clean. Standing in the foyer, he looked to his right and saw a dining room, piled high with textbooks, paper, pencils, a few laptops. Straight ahead, a regal staircase led up to the second floor. To his left, a small sitting room furnished with cozy overstuffed chairs, a great profusion of end tables, bookcases overflowing with books, and several mismatched lamps. A small hallway to the left of the staircase led to the back of the house. He could see the kitchen at the end of the hallway. All of the rooms were connected by large, wood-framed doorways through which you could have pushed a refrigerator sideways with room to spare.</p><p>“We have the dining room, which is mostly used for studying, you can see. We have two living rooms.” She led him down the hallway and pointed out the second living room, separated from the first by closed sliding doors. Two low couches stood at right angles, facing an ancient TV. “We call it the TV room,” she clarified. “Front of the house is quiet space, TV room and kitchen are designated for fun and hanging out.”</p><p>Draco couldn’t help but grin at her when her back was turned. There was something very motherly and orderly about her. She seemed like the kind of person who had a nice, almost neurotically-ordered planner, but still made sure to pencil in fifteen-minute sessions labelled “relax” or “free time.”</p><p>She showed him the kitchen, not big, but lots of counter space. He stooped to inspect the chore chart on the fridge. “Wow, people really use these?” he laughed.</p><p>Hermione sighed, hands on her hips, examining the dirty dishes in the sink with distaste. “Trust me, it’s the only way to keep this place from sinking into chaos.” Her eyes flicked over the chart, down the column marked Wednesday, found the row labelled “dishes” and followed the row to the name in the far-left column.</p><p>She reached over and pounded on the wall. “Ron, dishes! And we have a guest!”</p><p>The door opened and a sleepy-looking giant a few inches taller than Draco stumbled out, scratching his auburn stubble and yawning. He was far broader in the shoulders than Draco, well-muscled, with the attitude of a wildcat that has just been woken from a nap, mostly because he had just been. He wore flannel pajamas and a shirt that proclaimed “Aggies Know Hogs”. “Don’t yell at me! I was going to do them before I went to work.”</p><p>He fixed Draco with a lopsided smile, waving his broad hand. “Ron. You play soccer?”</p><p>“Um, Draco. Yeah, I played in high school.”</p><p>“Draco’s thinking of renting the attic bedroom,” Hermione said, seeming to disapprove of Ron’s tangent.</p><p>Ron shuffled to a cookie jar on the small kitchen table, lifted the lid, broke into a grin. He reached in and took two chocolate chip cookies.</p><p>“Want one?” he offered to Draco. They did look tempting, but Draco declined out of propriety.</p><p>“You should take the room. Luna bakes, Neville gardens, and Hermione keeps this ship sailing along.” He grinned at Hermione who swatted at him playfully before heading back to the front of the house, calling over her shoulder, “Dishes!”</p><p>Ron shot a mock salute at her back. “Yes, Captain!” He winked at Draco before retreating back to his room. Draco followed Hermione to the staircase. The sound of ‘90s grunge, muffled by the walls, reached them as they climbed the stairs.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “Don’t worry! Quiet hours start at 9 PM on weekdays, 10 on weekends, unless we’re having a party. He only ever plays it that loud in the afternoons before work.”</p><p>“Where does he work?”</p><p>“Hog’s Head Pizza. Delivery driver, mostly at night. He brings home extra most nights, if you’re ever hungry.”</p><p>On the second floor, five doors greeted them on a small landing. Hermione pushed open the middle door, which had been slightly ajar. “Bathroom. Kind of small and there is only the one, so mind the schedule.” She tapped a board next to the bathroom with all six names of the roommates and a different 30-minute increment written next to each name. Draco saw Hermione had the bathroom from 6:30 to 7 AM every day, which fit his image of her as a Type-A morning person.</p><p>The bathroom itself was clean and pleasant, a narrow sink, with a shelf next to it to add more counter space, a claw-foot tub with a shower fixture and a plastic-y yellow curtain.</p><p>“We usually keep the door open if no one’s in there, so no one accidentally walks in on anyone. That said, make sure to lock the door. Ron is not good with knocking.” She pulled the door half-shut again, then pointed to the other rooms.</p><p>“Left to right, we have me, Harry, Luna, and Cho.” She turned back to</p><p>Draco. “I completely forgot to ask for your pronouns, by the way.”</p><p>Draco felt a lump rise in his throat. No one had ever asked him that before. He thought for a minute. “Um, he/him, I guess.”</p><p>She smiled, nodded. “I’m she/her. Let me know if they change, ok?”</p><p>He nodded, looked down. Hermione went on briskly, and Draco was grateful for the distraction.</p><p>“Harry works in a bike repair shop, I think he’s at work now. I work at the library on campus, Cho works at the campus coffee shop, as I’m sure you know. We get a nice discount because of her. Luna works at the school paper and at the Star as well.”</p><p>She led the way up the second set of stairs, narrower than the first, to a little landing at the top with two doors facing each other. One was open.</p><p>“Neville, you in there?”</p><p>A lanky young man with a mop of dark brown hair and dimples leaned back in his office chair, then stood and extended his hand.</p><p>“Neville will be your flat mate, if you decide to move in. The rooms are separate, of course, and you’ll never know he’s here, he’s so quiet.”</p><p>Draco looked around at the bright, cozy room, and it seemed every stable surface had a potted plant on it. “You’re the one with the green thumb, huh?”</p><p>Neville laughed. “Yeah, I love plants. Used to have them all over the house, but Hermione made me cut down. So if you ever want a few, I have plenty.”</p><p>Hermione smiled. “They were starting to take over a bit.”</p><p>She turned to the other door and pulled it open. “And this would be your room.”</p><p>An empty bedframe stood in the corner, but the room was otherwise unfurnished. The room was much brighter than Draco thought when he read the listing for an attic bedroom.</p><p>He crossed to the dormer window, which was set into the wall, due to the sloping of the ceiling. It had a wide ledge in front of it. Draco could see himself curled up there this winter, with his journal and a cup of coffee.</p><p>He opened the closet door next, small, but then, he’d never had a lot of clothes anyway.</p><p>He turned back to Hermione. “Could I move in Friday?”</p><p>“Sure. The deposit and first month is due when you move in. $200 each. Rent is due on the first of the month. If you’re ever going to be late, just tell me as soon as you can so I can work something out with Albus, the landlord. Utilities are included, Albus pays all of that, but it’s $15 for cable and internet, due to me by the 10<sup>th</sup>.”</p><p>Hermione led him back downstairs to the entryway, to a desk that stood just inside the dining room. She opened a drawer and pulled out a small stack of paper stapled together.</p><p>“Here’s the Roommate Agreement. It’s a list of house rules, and a Renter’s Contract, detailing what’s due and when and under what circumstances Albus can keep your deposit. Bring it back with you on Friday. If you have any questions, here’s my cell.” She wrote her phone number at the top and handed the packet to him.</p><p>“I’m so glad you’re moving in! Cho speaks highly of you. You do have some place to stay until Friday, right?” Her gaze was suddenly appraising and sharp. Draco froze.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Are you sure? No one’s using it, we wouldn’t charge you extra. I have an inflatable mattress you could use.” Her eyes were piercing now, like she wanted to look into his head and pluck out the information.</p><p>“No, I’m fine. Promise,” he mumbled.</p><p>Hermione smiled and the interrogation was over, replaced by her open, warm gaze. “Ok. But text me if you need anything. And let me know when you’re coming. You have furniture?”</p><p>Draco thought of his huge, heavy mahogany furniture in storage. He could bring his desk and mattress, the frame looked like it would hold a full-size mattress, and the desk was from Ikea, light and compact.</p><p>“Just a mattress and my desk. Can I use that bed frame?”</p><p>“Sure. And Luna might have an extra dresser stashed away that you can use.”</p><p>Draco looked confused for a second, then looked around and pointed. “Oh, is she the decorator?”</p><p>“Yes, she finds old furniture and fixes them up. She usually just gives them away after. How are you getting your stuff here?”</p><p>Draco shrugged. “Just rent a U-Haul, I guess.” But how much would that cost?</p><p>Hermione was already shaking her head, taking the papers back and writing another phone number at the top. “For a desk and a mattress? They’ll gouge you out of like a couple hundred dollars, especially this weekend. That’s Ron’s number, he has a truck. Text him on Friday, not too early. Oh, and we’re having a back-to-school party on Saturday. Please invite your friends. Nothing formal, just hanging out.”</p><p>Draco was starting to feel a little overwhelmed. He nodded and stuck the agreement in his messenger bag. He saw Hermione look it over appreciatively, and tried not to let her see the Gucci logo. If she noticed, she didn’t say anything, just held her hand out again, and Draco shook it before leaving.</p><p>Hermione shut the door behind him with one last wave. Draco carried his bike down the steps and over the fence, taking a moment to stare up at the house, up at the window that would soon be his. Even though it was a house he would soon be sharing with 6 other people, it felt like this was the first thing that would belong just to him.</p><p>He mounted his bike and began to peddle back to the motel.</p>
