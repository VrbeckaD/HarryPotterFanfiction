    <p>Xanxus doesn’t have a Cloud. The whole Mafia knows that.<br/><br/>What most are unaware of, is that it’s not because he hasn’t found one. It’s because the one he wants, the one that Calls him, is stubborn.<br/><br/>But so is Xanxus.<br/><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><br/>Holly glared at the door to her hotel room. She knew the presence that stood outside that door. She knew the feeling of those Flames. The way they pulsed and swelled, how they tugged at her own, pulled her attention in on the man that was a walking inferno.<br/><br/>She hated that he Called her at all.<br/><br/>She’d joined the Mafia to <em>escape</em>, not so she would find a Sky she thought might <em>actually</em> have a chance of pulling her in. (In the deepest parts of her mind, never to be voiced aloud.)<br/><br/>That honestly just made her angrier. She’d dealt with enough Skies trying to push and pull her with strings, trying to make her dance to their songs. She <strong><em>would not be chained like that again</em></strong>. She refused. It would shatter her beyond repair, especially if she knowingly and willingly chose to trust the Sky only to become a puppet.<br/><br/>She wanted a home, wanted someone who could support her, but would let her fight her own battles. She wanted people who she could count on to trust her, who she could trust with no question and without jealousy getting in the way. She wanted people who could keep up with her, who could stand in front of the biggest threats in the room and scoff at them.<br/><br/>She wanted that, but she was <em>terrified</em> of trying to find it.<br/><br/>She had Flame Scars from being fought over by Dumbledore and Voldemort- two opposing Skies- who had sensed her powerful, young, <em>impressionable</em> Cloud Flames and reached for her.<br/><br/>She was unaware of it, but the violent <em>Rejection</em> of Voldemort, the way her Flames had sensed, even young as she was, their opposing personalities, the Corrupted Flames, the fact that he would smother her, cage her…<br/><br/>Her Flames had been so opposed to the match, that when the Corrupted Sky had tried to Call her for his own, they had lashed out in defense of her. Her Mother’s Flames- another Cloud, newly Activated in the face of Voldemort coming for her baby- had joined her own, and helped her to destroy the body of the Sky. <br/><br/>And so her first ‘scar’ was made in her Flame, the mark of a Corrupted Sky lashing into her for Rejection.<br/><br/>When she turned eleven, and met Dumbledore, he tried to make her complacent to him. To make it so that she would follow him without question. It had worked for a short while, helped along by the Sky Flame he had- though Holly was mostly sure he hadn’t realized what he was doing. She was so thankful to be free of the Dursleys, so grateful to see she was not a ‘freak’ as they called her, she had been happy to follow the man who made it possible.<br/><br/>It was worse, when she found out he was leading her around by the nose, leading her to death.<br/><br/>Caging her.<br/><br/>Dumbledore left deeper scars on her than Voldemort, because Holly had <em>trusted</em> him at first.<br/><br/>The following years of Dumbledore trying to reach out to her, and Voldemort coming after her at the end of every year, gave her more scars on her Flames as she fought the two Skies to remain free. They had attacked her with Flames before she had known how to protect herself from them. Before she had even known there was anything to be shielded from.<br/><br/>And so she became a threat to the two of them. A threat to what the opposing Skies considered ‘theirs’: The Wizarding World. She was a free spirt, a piece on the chessboard that refused to follow any of the rules. And both Skies wanting her dead.<br/><br/>One for the Greater Good.<br/><br/>The other for no reason except she was a threat to him. <br/><br/>She bore the scars from it for those who knew how to look. She’d never let anyone close enough to see them, however, never let her Flames free enough for the damage to be truly evident around Flame Actives.<br/><br/>Not even with this walking Inferno that Called to her and promised a Fortress to rest and battle from.<br/><br/>This stubborn, determined Sky, with scars of his own painted across his body and in his Flames.<br/><br/>Holly’s lips pulled back into a snarl, furious with herself even as she yanked the door to her room open.<br/><br/>She pretended she couldn’t feel the small embers of hope, fanned and fed every time this powerful man came back to her. Every time he hunted her down again and again. Courted her as a Proper Sky should, no matter how harshly she spoke, how violently she swore to never bow before a Sky.<br/><br/>She’d been hurt before. She’d learned her lessons with the Wizarding World. Hope was dangerous.<br/><br/>Hope burned. It scarred. It clawed its way to life and burrowed into hearts where it sat, waiting to flare to life only to scorch until there was nothing but ashes. <br/><br/>Holly refused to let herself be devoured by the fire, refused to let herself be made nothing but dust in the wind and pain.<br/><br/>She was not a phoenix, who would rise from ashes to be reborn, and so she refused to acknowledge those embers sitting in her heart.<br/><br/>Now if only the infuriating Sky would allow the embers to die, instead of feeding them every time he hunted her down.<br/><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><br/>Xanxus was a patient man. A thorough and steadfast man.<br/><br/>He knew others would argue, but he could not be an Assassin, much less Varia Boss, without being these things.<br/><br/>He was perfectly willing to wait for things that were worth the effort. Willing to Court a skittish and vicious Cloud who called to his Sky-Wrath so intensely.<br/><br/>It was rare for an Element to Call to him at all. It took years of effort, active searching and a lot of luck before he found the Elements he had now.<br/><br/>He needed Elements who would be loyal to him, who would follow him, and were powerful. He needed Elements that wouldn’t take his shit laying down, who were able and willing to stand up to him and point out any stupidity, while also being able to acknowledge when to trust Xanxus when he made a call that might not make sense to them or seem rational.<br/><br/>So, when he was in the middle of nowhere countryside, surrounded by nature and wild things, he did not expect the sound of vicious fighting. And he definitely did not expect the dagger-sharp flare of Cloud Flames that had him moving before his conscious mind caught up.  <br/><br/>That was the first time he saw Holly Potter, though he didn’t know her name at the time.<br/><br/>It was obvious she had been living amongst the forest, leaves, twigs and dirt on her frame. She had a few superficial scrapes, but was surrounded by bleeding bodies draped in black or red. Her face was twisted with challenge, blood-red lips pulled back and gem eyes shining, purple Flames billowing around her frame.<br/><br/>Xanxus didn’t think.<br/><br/>His Intuition <em>purred</em>, his instincts hummed, and Xanxus was moving before he thought about it.<br/><br/>Gun shots rang.<br/><br/>Her body twisted like wind and grace, those burning emeralds meeting glinting rubies. She sneered at him, automatically falling into a ready stance, her stare assessing.<br/><br/>Xanxus allowed his Wrath-Sky to rise, allowed her to consciously realize what she was feeling as he reached for her tentatively. Something in the back of his head- his Intuition so honed and developed around Vongola’s, his instincts so sharpened and practiced as an Assassin- told him that Flaring his Flames quickly, or reaching out to her the way he would with other Flames would be a bad idea. <br/><br/>He saw her eyes widen, felt her Flames flare aggressively, jerking away like he was about to strike her. He knew instantly he had been right to approach her Flames slowly with his own. Especially as her Flames, even as they curled away from his own in a learned manner, even as they flared aggression at him, braced themselves, like Xanxus would try to batter them down.<br/><br/>Xanxus immediately pulled his Flames back, his iron control keeping them away from the woman who looked like he had slammed into her with a run-away tank.<br/><br/>That was the first hint Xanxus had that this Cloud had been <em>hurt</em>.<br/><br/>She got away from him, that first time. He lost her in the forest, and immediately went looking for her once he got out of it.<br/><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><br/>The second time she saw the man she would later learn to call Xanxus, Holly had attacked him.<br/><br/>She wanted nothing to do with any Sky at that point, and seeing one who had tried to reach out to her, who had Called to her Flames despite the experience she had with them…<br/><br/>She’d seen it as an attempt to cage her.<br/><br/>She had already walked away from him once, no matter how warm his Flames were, or how controlled he was with them in her presence. She had only thought about how he had gone out of his way to find her again, how no one should have known where she was.<br/><br/>And yet, there the man was, his eyes fixed on her frame and curious in the way a predator would be when considering another predator.<br/><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><br/>When the Cloud flew at him with <em>intent</em>, Xanxus rose to meet her. Usually, anyone that tried to attack him seriously, was on a one way trip to hell.<br/><br/>But this little woman…she had attacked him defensively. She may have the <em>intent</em>, but it was not to kill him. It was more a wish to <em>stop</em> him, to put him down so he could not follow her. Defensive in nature, no matter how on the offense it looked.<br/><br/>He was also curious to see how she fought. What made her tick. A lot could be learned about a person through a fight.<br/><br/>And he found himself curious, because this was not the fighting of someone with formal training. This was the down and dirty, anything goes, vicious fighting of a <em>survivor</em>. The kind of fighting one learned when they were tossed under the bus, do it or die trying, sink or swim with the highest of stakes.<br/><br/>She fought like she had faced <strong><em>war.<br/><br/></em></strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><br/>She had thrown herself at this Sky with the intent to fight him, and put him down quickly.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he seemed to have a different idea. She was matched, move for move, tactic for tactic. He was holding back, she knew, but so was she. It <em>also</em> had the side effect of making her Inner Cloud sit up curiously. <em>This</em> one could match her. And she recognized the same kind of fighting she herself used in him- the kind you learned the hard and dirty way, where if you messed up you <em>bled</em> for it, died for it.<br/><br/>It made her angry then, Holly remembered, that this Sky had caught her Cloud’s attention. She <em>appreciated</em> people who could hold their own, and pull their weight. This man could and <em>did</em>.<br/><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She escaped him then too.<br/><br/>And she had run. Far and fast, because this Sky’s Flames didn’t scorch against her own, but soothed, and she was terrified.<br/><br/>She’d never had a soft place to fall. She had fought <em>wars</em>; she had lead them. She had held friends as the bled out in her arms, stitched her own wounds, when magic was too precious to be wasted on injuries that weren’t life threatening. She had stayed awake days, as she waited for the next attack.<br/><br/>Always it had been <em>her</em> who was looked to for leadership in the war. Always it had been <em>her</em> who was called upon to make the hard choices. She had figured out later, that her Cloud Instincts had been in agreement with the war simply because her Territory was involved.<br/><br/>She had not self-destructed as most Caged Clouds did, because she had found Territory in need of protection inside that world.<br/><br/>Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Hermione.<br/><br/>Blaise.<br/><br/>Luna.<br/><br/>Neville.<br/><br/>Fred.<br/><br/>George.<br/><br/>They had looked to her for guidance, willing to pull their weight, but trusting her as Leader. So she had lead, to protect Hogwarts and those she called her own, she had marched to War.<br/><br/>This Sky was very much an Alpha to match her own. And it was terrifying to meet someone who soothed her, who welcomed her, who could and would take the lead when she couldn’t or wouldn’t.<br/><br/>Holly had run, but she had searched for information on the man. (And ignored the voice asking why she would even need that information if she wasn’t going to give him a chance to chain her.)<br/><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Perhaps Xanxus would have left the Cloud to run, had he not been so stubborn and curious. Had he not seen her pain. She was hurt, had been hurt by those she had trusted, and she was lashing out at those who could hurt her if she let them in.<br/><br/>Xanxus had done the same, he recognized why she fought so hard in himself. He could see her fighting it, could feel the way her Flames <em>wanted</em> to reach for his. He could <em>feel</em> the tentative wisps that managed it, despite the iron control she held. Had he not known that Clouds were notorious for being the most difficult to woo for a Sky in the first place.<br/><br/>And so he searched for her. And found her.<br/><br/>Again.<br/><br/>And again.<br/><br/>And <em>again</em>.<br/><br/>Slowly, he could feel her walls lowering. Fractionally. Stubbornly. And he could respect a Cloud that made him <em>work</em> for their loyalty. It was often the most difficult Elements to pull in by a Sky, that were the most loyal and protective when it was managed.<br/><br/>So when he saw those embers, gleaming with hope in her eyes after the sixth time he found her, Xanxus knew he was making the right choice.<br/><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><br/>The day Holly allows Xanxus close, allows him to touch her, extends those first, delicate threads of earned trust, is a bad one.<br/><br/>She’s been moving, two steps ahead of a decently powerful Famiglia who wants a Cloud for their ranks, outnumbered and forced to keep herself out of their clutches with wit alone.<br/><br/>She hasn’t eaten anything at all in three days. Long term starvation with the Dursleys means she has the practice to ignore it, but she doesn’t like it. She hasn’t had a chance to bathe and not just wipe herself down with paper towels in public restrooms in the same amount of time. She’s been snatching short naps, falling back on war habits as she outruns the Famiglia chasing in her footsteps.<br/><br/>And then they catch up with her, and she finds herself surrounded. She can’t use magic without alerting Britain where she is, and it doesn’t matter what she wants, or what officials’ stances are on The Woman Who Conquered being in their countries are. If Britain pings in on her magic, they will come for her, and she doesn’t need to deal with that while dealing with Mafia Famiglia. <br/><br/>So she is reduced to her daggers, her martial arts skills, her wits and her Flames.<br/><br/>She is no slouch in any of these, having learned to use all of them in a warfront, and having traveled around for the last years enhancing them and learning from others.<br/><br/>It still puts her at a disadvantage in that she is alone, already injured, and very outnumbered when they catch up with her.<br/><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><br/>Holly is kind of pissed.<br/><br/>She’s in the middle of bum-fuck-nowhere, with grunts pouring from the surroundings and intent on ‘containing’ her.<br/><br/>They’re weak, their Flames are fickle and flickering things, barely worth the Will it takes to light them. She’s come to the conclusion that the only reason this Famiglia is considered decently powered, is because of their <em>numbers</em>, and possibly some savvy politicians and money handlers. Maybe even assassins, paid the right price to ‘accident’ competition. Maybe one or two averagely powered fighters with stronger Flames then these.<br/><br/>And yet, sheer <em>numbers</em> are wearing her down. Numbers, a lack of food or sleep, and the various injuries she had attained in an earlier fight.<br/><br/>She’s slowing down, her vision blurring at the edges. Her Flames are still powerful, still strong, but weaker than full strength, having been used in the previous fight as well as to help her body recover somewhat.<br/><br/>She snarls at the grunts, lips pulled back in a sneer, and her Flames flaring aggressively.<br/><br/>She would not fall.<br/><br/>She refused. Not to this trash. Not even when her state of health was against her.<br/><br/>She shifted the hold on her daggers, eyes shining violet, as she ignored the various and dangerous injuries she had attained in her previous bout, ignored the broken ribs, ignored the blurring vision. She firmed her stance, letting her Flames scorch over anyone that approached her, a violent warning to back off.<br/><br/>And then she found one some of those ‘averagely powered Flames’ she thought may have helped this Famiglia climb the ranks.<br/><br/>A Sky, a Storm, and a Rain.  She could sense they were bonded, all of them decent hands with their Flames, no matter how much <em>less</em> they had then herself.<br/><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><br/>She was going to murder the Sky with her bare hands.<br/><br/>He thought he could Call her.<br/><br/>He wasn’t even a <em>spark</em> compared to Xanxus’ Inferno. Compared to <em>her</em> Wildfire. He had no hope of Calling her, too weak to pull her Inner Cloud’s attention, especially when one considered her history with older, more powerful Skies. Adding in the way his Flames <em>felt</em> to her, ensured she wouldn’t have even glanced at him had he tried to Court her properly.<br/><br/>And then he tried to <em>force</em> her Flames to bond with him. Tried to smother her with his Flames, to snuff her own beneath his.<br/><br/>Even as she carved her way through his lackeys, he still was trying to entice her.<br/><br/>It made her feel dirty. His Flames were nasty- like wet sludge and slimy things. Anywhere he touched her with them, she immediately wanted to wash. He was not powerful enough to support her Cloud Flames in the first place, and him attempting to force it was almost painful, like he was trying to shove her into a too small box- into a <em>cupboard which she <strong>would never go back to</strong></em>- and she wanted him to die knowing he had made a mistake.<br/><br/>The War had made her more prone to violence. Her Cloud’s very nature- to do <em>anything</em> to protect her Territory- enhanced it. The loss of her own in the war- not all of them, but most- had made her vicious in defending the rest, made her less likely to balk in the face of things that she might otherwise have. Joining the Mafia to get away from the Wizarding World, and to learn about her Flames had only sharpened her violent tendencies, making her more deadly. She had no desire to change that- her inner blade, her ‘violence’, had saved herself <em>and</em> her people too many times over the war for her to ever wish it away.<br/><br/>She knew when to sheathe her blade, knew control and balance. So, she never worried about what those who were not Her Own said, and those she called her own had walked beside her in war and understood- had their own inner-blades.<br/><br/>And for this Sky who thought to shove her into cupboard spaces, to smother her Wildfire with the slime and sludge of his own?<br/><br/>She would unsheathe her blade, and she would <em>gut</em> <em>him</em>.<br/><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><br/>Holly gasped wetly for air, choking on the blood that wanted to rush up her throat. That last injury had broken the previously cracked ribs from the fight before this one.<br/><br/><em>Pierced Lung?<br/><br/></em><strong><em>Fuck</em></strong>.<br/><br/>She’d need to stop and deal with that before she drowned in her own blood.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there were too many <em>fucking rats pouring out of the woodwork</em>. She didn’t have a moment to breathe, had no time to heal herself, to deal with her ribs. She was using her Flames to increase the amount of oxygen she was pulling in, her magic scrambling internally to fix the damage.<br/><br/>And then the very air went still, the way it did before a natural disaster.<br/><br/>There was a <em>roar</em>, and then something- some<em>one</em>- dropped from the sky like a meteor. All eyes were fixed on the dust cloud kicked up in response, but Holly knew, even before Flames flared to life and burned the dust away, who stood in front of her.<br/><br/>His Flames had flared, hard and furious, reaching for her instantly, and wrapping around her protectively.<br/><br/>She’d relaxed, her head pounding, ribs broken and throbbing, her various bruises and lacerations pulsing in time with her heartbeat. Sleep deprivation and lack of food and a possibly pierced lung held at bay by her Flames and magic made it so she just wanted to <em>sleep</em>.<br/><br/>She’d never felt <em>sheltered</em> before.<br/><br/>Never trusted someone to deal with the mess and prevent her from being hurt while they did it.<br/><br/>Perhaps that was the reason she allowed herself to fall back, wheezing wetly in a way that had Xanxus’ eyes snapping to hers, and his Flames flaring higher. The first delicate threads of trust, fought for and earned over months and months of meetings and chasing, of work and struggle on both their parts.<br/><br/>“What are you doing with that Cloud? She’s going to be <em>mine</em>.”<br/><br/>Holly almost laughs, but that would hurt her chest. The Sky is a fool. She wonders how he could <em>miss</em> the power difference, the way Xanxus’ Flames had cradled her, or how she had relaxed into it.<br/><br/>Then the slimy-sludge of his Flames approached her and she snarled, but before she could do anything Xanxus growls, and his Inferno overwhelms and destroys the other Sky’s Flame.<br/><br/>“She belongs to <em>no one</em> but herself, you fucking <em>scum</em>.”<br/><br/>And perhaps it is <em>this</em> moment, this observation Xanxus has made and spoken aloud with such conviction, while he stands in front of her, waiting for her to tell him he can eradicate the Famiglia who had tried to cage her, that makes those embers of hope flare.<br/><br/>She is not a phoenix, who can be reborn by Flames, and so as the fires of hope burn into life in her chest, she prays she will not be consumed.<br/><br/>And she reaches out, for the first time, allowing her Flames to bloom and stretch out for this walking Inferno.<br/><br/>His eyes snap to hers, and his Flames curl around the reaching tendrils of her own welcoming and careful, ready to pull away if her Flames recoil as they have every other time.<br/><br/>Instead she relaxes just a bit, forcing herself up from the ground, and murmuring “Get me out of here Xanxus?”   <br/><br/>He growls, but his Flames are all but <em>singing</em> with victory as he turns to the Famiglia who had chased her.<br/><br/>“With pleasure.”</p>
