    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her wrath was like the calm build of a Tsunami. There was no sound, and no one dared breathe. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em> <span class="s1">Smack</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A collection of gasps and it hit, her very essence, wave after wave it crashed through the Great Hall, leaving every magical being quaking in their seats. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Not him. The moment he saw McLaggen confront her, he was stepping towards them, fist colliding with the idiot’s jaw. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Without her intended outlet, Hermione’s eyes focused on him, redirecting and displaying her anger. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You loathsome little..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He's heard those words before.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"...flobberworm!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>Huh. That's new,</em> Draco mused to himself. He supposed it was an improvement considering their past. He stared at the girl, no, this goddess in front of him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"But I'm your flobber worm," he replied.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her eyes flashed in a warning.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She doesn't deny it, finally.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I don't need you to save me." </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You're not the one I'm saving, Granger."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She eyed the offending person lying on the ground, nursing his injured jaw. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"That's right. You have a thing for all things Gryffindor now."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco scoffed. "I have a thing for a particular Gryffindor." Granted, he found himself in the company of Potter and Weasley more than he cared to admit.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She sniffed and crossed her arms, but he saw her holding back a smile. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This was new ground for them. The war had ended — the road to forgiveness, the progress of grief, a long way for everyone, especially him. Draco might have spied and joined the Order, but people still got hurt, and people died. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t bring the innocents back.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Didn't know you had a death eater kink. Did you spread your legs to any old death eater or was it just Voldemort-- " McLaggen squeezed out. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco swore and looked back at McLaggen. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That idiot. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Mione," voiced Potter, standing up from his seat, his wand was already in hand, "Put your wand down."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her wand. Draco didn't see her draw it. He spared a glance at one of the Deathly Hallows. The very same that took down Voldemort from the force of nature that was Hermione Granger.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As if knowing it was gathering attention, a pulse of magic emanated from the wand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco saw Weasley in his peripheral, who sat across from Potter, reach for his wand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Granger," he grasped her wand hand, "Hermione," he whispered. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione's gaze was murderous, her wand still pointed at Mclaggen.  Slowly, she lowered her wand, "I protect what’s mine.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Giving one last glare at McLaggen, she turned and swiftly walked out of the Great Hall. Her hair billowed around her face with each step betraying her calm exterior.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco didn’t bother walking back to the Slytherin table and instead plopped down next to Weasley, stepping over McLaggen. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Bloody hell," Weasley sighed as he ran both hands through his red hair. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter sat down, looking as exhausted as Draco felt. He slid over a mug of pumpkin juice towards Draco and gave him a measured look. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco surveyed the damage around the Great Hall. </span>
  <span class="s1">"I'm going to marry her someday. </span>
