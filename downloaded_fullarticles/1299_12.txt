    <p>‘Swish and flick, swish and flick’, Sammy sat in the Gryffindor common room swishing and flicking vigorously. She had been so excited to come to Hogwarts, after everything her mother had told her. She now had a heavy feeling in her stomach something akin to a rock due to the fear that she would be rubbish at all of her subjects. She felt she was the only first year not to have mastered wingardium leviosa and yet they were two weeks into term.<br/>

‘Excuse me?’<br/>

Sammy jumped, she had been sitting at the foot of the stairs up to the boys’ dormitory, it was fairly late and she hadn’t expected anyone to come down.<br/>

‘Yes?’ Sammy squeaked, her brown eyes meeting that of a tall boy with horn-rimmed glasses who she didn’t recognise from any of her classes.<br/>

‘Could you try not to be so loud? I have double transfiguration in the morning and I need my sleep,’ He sniffed and looked down his nose at her. She flushed under his scrutiny and mumbled something about moving away. She got up to leave when-<br/>

‘Wait! I can show you how to do it properly’ his voice was softer and he dropped his snobbish gaze.<br/>

She turned around and gushed quietly so nobody would hear, ‘Oh would you please? I’m having so much trouble and I don’t think I’m very good at anything here!’<br/>

The boy looked embarrassed and slightly uncomfortable at the sight of her large, welling eyes. However, he sat her down in a squishy chair before a dying fire.<br/>

‘Okay, just show me how you do it and then I’ll just correct you,’ he was sitting stiffly but Sammy could tell he felt important, she noticed that his chest puffed out just a tiny bit with pride. She smiled widely and then continued to flourish her wand so hard that she nearly poked the boy in the eye, ‘WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!’ The boy jumped so hard that his glasses swung up and got caught in his flaming red hair. Sammy looked shocked that her obvious attempt at magic had made no progress. The boy next to her however quickly arranged his glasses and smiled, looking relaxed for the first time. ‘Well it’s obvious what you’re doing wrong! Just slow down and speak more clearly, your movements are too quick for anything to happen and the same goes for your words. Yelling is quite unnecessary as well,’ he said all this very quickly and with such a pompous tone that Sammy had to try very hard not to laugh or openly gape at him; instead she regained composure and –‘Wingardium leviosa’ she spoke clearly and she knew the boy would have smiled if she hadn’t lifted his glasses’ off his face. Blinking a few times in surprise he grabbed his glasses out of the air. He quickly smiled but caught sight of his watch which was only faintly reflecting the embers in the fireplace.<br/>

‘Merlin’s beard! I really should be in bed’ he glanced nervously up the boys’ dormitory stairs. 

‘You really should have been upstairs an hour ago’ his pompous voice back again.<br/>

‘Though you made excellent progress, really excellent, goodnight now,’ Sammy waved him goodbye but did not move up to her four-poster until she had satisfied her thirst for sending various objects flying around the room. Finally after setting down a near-by fire poker she smiled and headed upstairs. For the first time she felt comfortable at Hogwarts, she had gained that confidence you could only get from learning and achievement. She went to sleep happy, knowing that she had made a friend who had the same spark of ambition.<br/>

Sammy woke up the next day and could hear birds chirruping, surprised and nodding her head awake, she realised that she had woken up early. A rare thing but an opportunity at the same. Somewhat dozed she dressed and headed downstairs. Fingering her wand impatiently beneath her robes she quitted the Gryffindor common room opting for the fresher option of the grounds.<br/>

She took her time walking down to the entrance and by the time she had passed through the front doors a small drizzle of students had begun to trickle down to breakfast. Mainly seniors nodding to each and looking important, though she saw a few laugh openly when a particularly bleary eyed Slytherin tripped over his own feet. He looked around sheepishly and Sammy caught a glance of him telling his friends to ‘shove off’ before being enveloped by the fresh morning air.<br/>

She directed herself towards the lake, revelling in the chilly fog emitting from it. Striding purposely then, she reached a large willow tree and sat herself down under it. Striding had been good she thought, she felt she had a place to go. Frowning, she looked around her, already restless. Noticing a small twig, she picked it up and rolled it between her fingers. It was rough and blunt. She drew out her wand and decided she would practice transfiguring it into a needle. Another spell she had not mastered.<br/>

The fog had well cleared by the time Sammy got up for breakfast. Sitting down at the Gryffindor table she felt pleased with the now smooth, sharp twig in her hand. What did it matter if it were not quite metal yet?<br/>

Her smugness must have shown because when she was buttering some toast the boy from last night sat down next to her,<br/>

‘Feeling quite pleased with my tutoring then?’ he also proceeded to butter toast.<br/>

‘Well I am but look at how my transfiguration is going!’ she showed him her wooden needle.<br/>

‘Nobody in my class has managed it yet,’ she looked up proudly and saw him smile kindly.<br/>

‘Show me how you did it,’ he instructed her. Placing the twig-needle on the palm of her hand she proceeded in making a few shifty movements and muttering an incantation under her breath. There was no change in the needle. She had expected this.<br/>

‘It takes a while for it to work,’ glancing up at the horn-rimmed glasses.<br/>

‘How about you place the twig on the table and then your movements won’t be so restricted?’ the boy suggested.<br/>

Sammy did this and found it much easier; did the twig look a little shinier?<br/>

‘Hmm yes that’s better; now when you turn your wand- no the other way, make it sharper. Your turns are too sloppy.’ Sammy did not take notice of his sharp words; instead she beamed and followed the instructions. She closed her eyes when performing the spell this time and focused her attention totally on the twig-needle, hardly daring to hope. When she opened her eyes she gave a cry of delight that caused several people to look at her and a Ravenclaw student to slop porridge down his front. She picked up the metallic needle bearing no resemblance what-so-ever to a twig.<br/>

‘Thank you so much…err?’ enquiring for his name.<br/>

‘Percy, Percy Weasley’ he replied in a pompous tone, she noticed the puff of his chest.<br/>

‘I’m Sammy Burbage,’ she told him and he smiled.</p>
