    <p>“Fleur, we hardly know one another!  Why on Earth would you want <i>me</i> to be your maid of honour?  Shouldn't Ginny or Gabrielle stand up with you?”  Hermione stared at the lovely French witch and hoped, however faintly, for a logical explanation.</p>
<p>“Eet ees quite seemple,” Fleur responded, calm and composed in the face of English histronics.  “Zis tradition ees in place due to ze nature of ze magical contract Guillame and I signed for ze license to marree.  One of us <i>must</i> marry today, zough zhere can be ze...eh, zircumztances zat do no' let one of ze promized pair to wed.  If zhere ees an ancient contract or an unekzpected, bah, <i>lien de sang?”</i></p>
<p>“Blood tie?” Hermione offered.</p>
<p><i>“Oui.</i>  Blood tie between us, zhen we canno' marree each ozzer, but one of us can marree ze best man or maid of honour.  If neizzer of us can comply, zhen ze maid of honour and ze best man will marree, w'ich matchez ze contract.  Zat 'as no' 'appened in nearly seven 'undred years, zough.  A bride or groom marree-ing ze witness 'as no' 'appened in nearly two 'undred.”  </p>
<p>“That means Ginny can't stand up with you because Charlie is standing up with Bill.”  Hermione grimaced at the thought.  “Why not Gabrielle?”</p>
<p>“She ees too young,” Fleur replied with a Gallic shrug, “and anyzing zat would not allow me to marree Beel would prevent 'er marreege to 'im as well.”</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head.  “I am not going to pretend I understand that, but all right.  I'll be your maid of honour.”  She didn't bother to ask why there wasn't a matron of honour – it was one of those things that was painfully obvious after an explanation of something else.  On the other hand, explanations were sometimes fun to get anyway.  “Why not a matron of honour?” </p>
<p>“A marreed witch?”  Fleur was appalled.  “Zhe would 'ave two 'uzbands, zhen, and men are no' good when eet comes to sharing zheir witch.”</p>
<p>“The fact that it's illegal might also have something to do with it,” Hermione added dryly.</p>
<p><i>“Oui.”</i>  Fleur hugged her then, a huge smile on her face.  “I cannot zhank you enou', 'Ermione!  Come, we must 'ave you sign ze witness lines of ze contract.  Zen we will 'ave ze dress altered to fit you, and...”</p>
<p>The list had gone on and on for quite some time, but the execution of that list was frighteningly quick.</p>
<p>In less than four hours, Fleur was going to be married to Bill, and Hermione was at the French witch's mercy until then.  She considered it a kind of bloodless, fashion-based revenge for the various wars and territory the French had lost to the English over the centuries, exacted most cleverly by an enthusiastic bride on her wedding day.  By the time her hair had been twisted and pinned into place, her scalp was quite certain said revenge included torture.  The dress, a pale blue version of Fleur's wedding dress as tradition required, was gorgeous; however, when the corset top of the dress was put into place, Hermione's cinched waist, bound ribs, squeezed lungs, and squashed-into-startling-fullness breasts agreed with her scalp.  Hermione's brain most likely would have conceded the point, but it was slightly oxygen-starved by the time she was finished dressing, so it was limited in its scope to “don't trip, don't trip, breathe, don't trip, breathe, don't trip...”</p>
<p>Everything was done, no problems arose, and they were moments from the officiate's greeting to the gathering when a minor Ministry official popped in and spoke rapidly to the parents of the bride.  Fleur's mother paled significantly, and her father closed his eyes in some emotion that could have been relief or disappointment.  The official hurried up to the couple and witnesses, apologized profusely, and destroyed Hermione's life in a handful of sentences.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, Miss Delacouer, but you are not permitted to marry Mr. Weasley.  You and your sister were contracted out three hundred years ago by your Veela ancestresses, and you will be required to marry into the Malfoy line.  Gabrielle will be marrying the closest living relative to the Lestrange line, which is Marcus Flint.  Miss...”</p>
<p>“Granger,” Hermione managed.</p>
<p>“Miss Granger –  OH!”  The man's eyes went wide.  Voldemort had been defeated for only two months, and Hermione was quite the heroine from the Battle of Hogwarts.  “Yes, Miss Granger, well, I do apologize for the abrupt change of plans, but I am afraid you will be required to stand for the bride, with Miss Delacouer as your maid of honour.”</p>
<p><i>“Non,”</i> Fleur said, eyes sad and sweet, “I must go to ze Malfoy estate et marree.  Ze arrangements will be quite seemple, but ze contract.”  The Gallic shrug that accompanied that declaration somehow was made even more galling by the matter-of-fact tone of voice Fleur used.  She loved Bill, but she was going to go honour a contract her great-great-great-great-great grandmother had made for her.  <i>C'est la vie.</i>  Such was life.  </p>
<p>“Yes.  Yes, I do,” the official said.  “I will accompany you and perform the ceremony for you.  Your sister, of course, will have a few years before she is required to marry...”</p>
<p>Fleur looked at the man she had come to love, smiled at him softly, and kissed his cheek.  She stepped back as he gave her the same sad smile, turned to Hermione and performed the Bridal Charm for her.  Muriel's tiara was also transferred, and Hermione's power radiated from her in a near-blinding white light.  </p>
<p>Hermione looked like she was about to faint, so Harry hurried up beside her as Fleur and her family Disapparated.</p>
