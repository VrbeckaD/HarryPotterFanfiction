    <p>It is Christmas! Though for once, I am more nervous than excited. Scorpius will come over to meet my family and my whole family would be here for Christmas dinner. Al my cousins are here already and the parents will come in time for dinner. My grandparents are here as well. Grandma Molly is making the dishes, while granddad Arthur is doing who knows what. Probably looking over at his rubber ducks. Which I don't see the use of. There are more interesting Muggle things than bath toys. The only one of the adults, including my grandparents but excluding Teddy, who know about Scorpius and I, is my dad. Surprisingly he took it well, he said he already knew I was gay and that he trusted my instinct. That was a relieve. It still is, but he and my cousins -you can't have secrets at Hogwarts- warned me for mum and uncle Ron. So that makes me rather nervous. Therefore I am pacing in front of the fireplace right now, Scorpius can floo in at any moment. I sigh. Lily comes in and tells me that Scorpius would know what to do, before she takes me with her to the garden. 'For distractions,' in her words.<br/>
'Albus,' I hear my brother say, just a few minutes later. 'Your dearest friend is here,'<br/>
I roll my eyes at him and give Lily a knowing look, before I run. I have not seen him in a week and how cliche it may sound. This holiday I did miss him. James is sending Scorpius glares when I walk in, after slowing down in the hallway. 'James, get over it.' I say, before hugging my boyfriend.<br/>
'It might already be a year, but I will never get used to Malfoy,'<br/>
I glare at James. He is the worst yet. He keeps bugging me about us. It is a wonder that he kept his mouth shut about it. Luckily Lily and everyone else did get over it and see more than his looks and name now. Rose, Lily and Hugo even are close friends of Scorp, even though he and I are Slytherins, Lily and Rose two Ravenclaws and Hugo a Hufflepuff. For us it doesn't matter. James quickly leaves the room and I decide to let Scorp meet my grandparents. Just when I take him to the kitchen, dad apparates in the room. He smiles at me and looks at Scorp. 'Nice to meet you, mr. Potter,' Scorpius says politely. 'Nice to meet you as well, Scorpius. I heard a lot about you,'<br/>
'Dad!' I protest.<br/>
Scorpius laughs, I shake my head. 'And you can call me Harry,' Dad says, ignoring me.<br/>
Scorpius nods. Then more people start to come in.<br/>
We all take our seat for Christmas Dinner, while waiting for Ron, Hermoine and my mum. Merlin knows why they come in last. I hear them coming in and hold my breath. 'Harry, why is-' Ron starts.<br/>
'He is a friend of Albus and Lily,' and Hugo and Rose. 'So we invited him over,'<br/>
Dads interruption keeps Ron quiet. Everyone takes seat and soon the conversations are about the food. Some people look at Scorp, but so far the reactions are grown up enough.<br/>
While we're having the main dish, I decide to come clean. I look at Scorp and he looks okay with it. After a year we are finally ready. 'I want to say something,' I say loudly.<br/>
That is the only way that I get all the attention. Dad looks at me. 'What is it?' mom says.<br/>
I feel scared, but there is no way back. 'Scorpius is my boyfriend,' I say, while looking around the table, awaiting reactions.</p>
