  <em>Year Six</em>
</p><p> </p><p>                “So that’s what you’ve been hiding.” James said, leaning in with his hands clasped. “To be honest, Remus, Pete thought you might be a serial killer.”</p><p>                Peter blanched, slapping James on the arm. “I did not! Well…I might have, for a brief moment.”</p><p>                Remus was silent, deflating back deeper into the armchair he was currently sitting in. Sirius was perched on the arm, also remaining silent. Finally, the dark-haired boy spoke, turning his head to look at Remus.</p><p>                “You could have told us sooner.” He said, putting his hand on Remus’s shoulder. “There’s no harm in it. Not like you have any control over it.”</p><p>                “That’s what I was afraid of. Not having any control over it. You know…the wolf.” Remus said, rubbing his hands on his slacks nervously. “I promised myself when I knew I was coming to Hogwarts that I wouldn’t make any friends. That way I would be in less of a position to hurt people.”</p><p>                “That’s bullocks.” James said, clapping Remus on the knee, leaning forward on the couch. “Everyone needs friends. And you, my furry friend, are a Marauder. And we stick together. Right?” He looked first at Sirius and then at Peter. Peter nodded, and Sirius pumped his fist in the air.</p><p>                Remus relaxed a bit, but then winced at the nickname. “James, don’t-“</p><p>                “That’s what we’re going to call it. Your ‘furry little secret’. Not that it’s much of a problem. Not for us, anyway. And everyone else can piss off.” James said, matter-of-fact in his demeanor. Sirius stood suddenly, turning to look at Remus full on.</p><p>                “What you should really be worried about is how tall you’ve gotten since we saw you last. Summer brought a growth-spurt, eh?” He chided, pulling Remus to his feet. He still only came to Sirius’s collar bones, but last term he had barely made it to the other boy’s shoulder. He heard James laugh.</p><p>                “Pete’s still the shortest, and I don’t see that changing!”</p><p>                “Hey!”</p><p>XXX</p><p>                “You blokes go on. I’ll stay with him.” Sirius said, looking over his should at James and Peter. He was sitting in a wooden chair beside a bed in the hospital wing. It was early in the morning after the first full moon since Remus had told the boys about his lycanthropy. Remus was laying in the hospital bed, curled up on his side. A new, red, angry scar was visible on his shoulder, wrapping around down his side.</p><p>                “You sure, Sirius? You didn’t sleep at all last night. You had a light on.” James said. Sirius nodded, looking back at the unconscious Remus.</p><p>                “Yeah. S’Alright. Someone should be here when he gets up. Besides, Evans would miss you making cow-eyes at her over breakfast. She hasn’t started her morning without that since first year.” He teased.</p><p>                James smiled, rolling his eyes. “Alright, Sirius. Always the devoted friend.” James’ eyes lingered between Remus and Sirius, narrowing just a bit before he turned and grabbed Peter’s elbow, pulling the curtain closed behind him as they left.</p><p>                Sirius turned back to Remus. The boy looked very small and very vulnerable, laying there in that bed. Sirius didn’t like it. It’s not that his friend was usually anything but quiet, but seeing him like this was…well, it was awful.</p><p>                “You went through this alone?” Sirius said to the sleeping Remus. “All this time, one of us could have been with you. I could have been with you, you know I sleep for shit anyway.” He swallowed, leaning out to trace an old, silver scar on Remus’ jaw. That’s how the secret eventually came out. Remus, who always changed in private, had come out of the bathroom in just a towel when he thought the rest of his dormmates had gone to breakfast. Sirius was there, sitting on his bed and waiting for his friend. The first shock had been Remus’ state of undress. He was always more than a little shy and had blushed profusely. Then, he realized that Sirius had full view of the scars criss-crossing his torso. The scars on his jaw and neck had been easy to write off. Shaving for the first time, falling, usual boy stuff. But these? The sheer amount of them, the seriousness of some of the keloids that had formed…</p><p>                Sirius shook his head, breaking himself from the memory.</p><p>                “We’ll have to think of something, Remus, because going through this alone isn’t working. You must tear yourself to pieces, being alone out there. I don’t know what we’ll do, but we’ll figure it out. Together.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>XXX</p><p> </p><p>                “Does the wolf…you know…is it an omega, too?” Peter asked, breaking the relative silence in the common room. The four boys were studying, which consisted of Peter and Remus doing homework and James and Sirius flicking paper squares at each other.</p><p>                Remus’ head snapped up. “What?” He asked, wondering if he heard his friend correctly. Peter winced.</p><p>                “You know. You’re an omega, right? Does that mean the wolf is too? Or is it different? Like there must be some part of you in there with it.” Peter clarified.</p><p>                Remus felt all of their eyes on him. He closed his book, his shoulders shrinking in. “I, uh…I don’t actually know. I’m, well…I haven’t presented yet. Like I have some of the basic, you know, responses and stuff. But I don’t think I’ll know until I, you know, go through the change.”</p><p>                “But I thought you did change every full moon?” Peter said, and James shoved him toward the arm of the couch.</p><p>                “He means his first heat.” James said, causing Remus’ ears to get hot. It was weird to hear his friends talk about this kind of stuff, especially when it was in reference to him. He was the only omega in the group. Peter was a beta, which made him a bit oblivious to the dynamics that the other boys were more than familiar with. James and Sirius were both alphas, which was apparent when their banter would turn into a rough-and-tumble show for dominance. They kept score, of course, keeping the record on a charmed piece of parchment.</p><p>                But Remus’ heat was something private. His parents had been hush-hush about matters like that. They were prim in that regard, and Remus had grown up a bit ashamed of his social positioning. Add being a werewolf on top of that and you had the perfect mix for low self-esteem.</p><p>                “But you can scent and stuff, right? We can all do that, right off the bat. Even Pete.” James said, causing Peter to perk up.</p><p>                “Yes, I can. And my nose is a bit more sensitive than yours would be. I know that. What with the wolf. But the other stuff…I don’t know.”</p><p>                “You’re due though, aren’t you?” Sirius finally chimed in, eyes trained on Remus. “I mean, other omegas in our grade are going through it, you remember the lecture we had.”</p><p>                The other three boys cringed at the memory. All of the third and fourth years, gathered in the History of Magic classroom, being lectured on their changing bodies. Remus had been mortified. James and Sirius had snickered their way through it. Peter seemed lost.</p><p>                “I don’t know!” Remus squeaked, grabbing for his book. “Change of topic, please!”</p><p>                Sirius’ eyes lingered on Remus for few moments longer, and James noticed.</p><p> </p><p>XXX</p><p> </p><p>When James woke up, he could smell it. Remus, but sweeter. Stronger. He pulled back his curtain, and saw Sirius standing at the foot of Remus’ bed. He hadn’t moved the curtains, but he was standing there, stock-still, his hands fisted at his sides.</p><p>James looked around for Peter. He must have left for breakfast already. James’ eyes snapped back to Sirius.</p><p>“Oy!” James called out in a sharp whisper. “Let’s leave him to it. Come on, mate, you’re being a creep. It’s Remus. We’ll tell Peter to stay clear of the room until tonight.”</p><p>“Should he really be alone? It’s his first heat.” Sirius voice was heavy. James was taken aback. Sirius couldn’t mean what he thought he did…</p><p>“If you’re worried about someone coming in, we can lock the door. Tell McGonagall. We should probably have a teacher come by, anyway.” James said, standing.</p><p>“So he can spend another night alone in the infirmary?” Sirius snapped. He still wasn’t looking at James.</p><p>“I can hear you.” Came Remus’ soft voice through the curtains. It was breathy, labored.</p><p>“Oh, you’re awake.” Sirius’ voice was a bit lighter toned when talking to Remus. “Are you-what do you need?”</p><p>“I’d rather not talk about what I need.” Remus squeaked. “I think we all know. But I’m not…I don’t know.”</p><p>“I know what you need.” Sirius replied, and James stood up quickly.</p><p>“Alright! Enough of this, Sirius, come on!” James grabbed Sirius by the elbow but the taller boy pulled away, growling. He squared his shoulders in a show of dominance, and James’ hackles were raised immediately.</p><p>“Sirius, come on. This is <em>Remus</em>. You’re being a fucking <em>creep</em>.” James tried to push him toward the door, but Sirius shoved him back. James threw his hands up.</p><p>“You know I’m not a rat, but I’m getting McGonagall.” James said.</p><p>“James, I would be so embarrassed.” Remus called from behind his curtains. “Just…go. It’ll be fine, just go.”</p><p>James’ eves widened. “Remus, I really don’t think I should leave you alone. You know…with Sirius.” He pressed. James heard Remus shift in his sheets, huffing.</p><p>“I said it’s…f-fine. I know what I’m…James, just <em>go</em>.” Remus pleaded. James shook his head, giving Sirius one last look before heading to the door.</p><p>Once Sirius heard the click of the door, he moved to the side of Remus’ bed and pulled the curtain aside. Remus was in his boxers, laying on his back, fists clenching on the covers.</p><p>“It…hurts. Sirius, it hurts. Wh-what is this?” He whined, shaking his head. “Damn it, I know what it is. B-But no one warned me it would feel like this.”</p><p>“I know.” Sirius got on his knees on the bed at Remus’ feet, putting his hands on the other boy’s knees. “They don’t warn you.” Sirius inhaled through his nose deeply, taking in the almost sickly-sweet scent of Remus’ heat. He’d caught scent of other omega’s heats before, but Remus’ made his head spin. The smell had woken him up from his sleep, entangling him and all but enticing him to get up and stand by Remus’ bed.</p><p>“Can you…can you help? Isn’t it better to be…you know…with an alpha? Safer, or…something?” Remus’ skin was flush, his cheeks red and eyes blown out, almost nothing but pupil. “I know we’re not…we haven’t…”</p><p>“Shh.” Sirius soothed, rubbing Remus’ knees, down his thighs. Remus’ shuddered. “I’ve been…keeping an eye on you. James noticed. I was always a bit more protective of you than I am of the others.”</p><p>“Just because I’m the only o-omega in the group. James doesn’t need protecting, neither does Peter. You just f-feel…bad for me.” Remus said, his hips shifting.</p><p>“Not quite.” Sirius quipped, squeezing the thighs under his hands. Remus’ breath became more labored. “It’s a bit more than that. A bit more.”</p><p>Sirius pushed Remus’ legs apart and leaned down into the other boy, pushing their chests together. Remus was about to object to the sudden closeness but his protest was cut short when Sirius buried his face in Remus’ neck, inhaling his strong scent.</p><p>“Sirius? Are you going to…” He trailed off as his best friend began mouthing his neck, right over the spot where a bond mark would be. Remus shuddered.</p><p>He couldn’t deny that the pressure of Sirius’ body was exactly what he seemed to need. His panic receded of its own accord. Sirius smelled amazing. Strong and protective. Heady. But this was Sirius, his best friend. His head was swimming.</p><p>“All I’m going to do is help you, Remus. Going to help you through this.” He pulled away, and Remus involuntary whined. Sirius chuckled, using the other boys knees to lift himself up again to a kneeling position. “Switch places with me.” He directed, pulling Remus up. Remus complied and Sirius positioned himself sitting up against Remus’ headboard.</p><p>“What are we going to do?” Remus asked, nervously wrapping his arms around himself. Sirius patted his lap.</p><p>“Come here. Sit facing me.” He said. Remus hesitated but eventually crawled forward, straddling Sirius’ lap. His cheeks reddened even more as he realized that not only was his erection visible through his thin boxers, but his backside was slick with his heat. He didn’t want anyone seeing him like this. He squeezed his eyes shut and he settled in Sirius’ lap.</p><p>“Hey. Hey, come on, Remus. Open your eyes. It’s okay. It’s natural.” Sirius soothed. He put his hands on Remus’ hips, pulling him closer before pushing him back a bit. Remus’ eyes flew open.</p><p>“Sirius, th-that-“</p><p>“Feels good, yeah?” Sirius said, licking his lips. He did it again, rocking Remus’ hips, pushing his own up to meet his. Remus’ mouth fell open.</p><p>“Just keep doing it.” Sirius said, his hands massaging Remus’ hips. Remus did as he was told, rocking back and forth under the guidance of Sirius’ hands.</p><p>He was overwhelmed. This was Sirius. His best friend. But the feeling was beyond anything he’d experienced. Sirius’ hands were strong, his scent was stronger…he could feel himself being pulled hard by his instincts. He’d never really indulged in them before, hadn’t felt the need to. Now, though…now he was conflicted. He was ready to give in. But this was <em>Sirius</em>.</p><p>“I-I don’t think we should be doing this.” Remus stuttered through his words, eyes cast down to the side of the room. “This is…th-this is too intimate and we’re-“</p><p>Sirius wrapped one of his hands around Remus’ neck and pulled him down, burying his face once again against the other boys neck.</p><p>“Who better to take care of you? Let me do this. Let me help you.” Sirius whispered against the skin of Remus’ neck. Remus’ breath hitched at the feeling.</p><p>“But we aren’t…” He began.</p><p>“Aren’t what? Together?” He asked, pulling back a bit to look into Remus’ eyes. They were still grinding their hips together. “Seems like it now, hm? I feel the same way about you that James feels about Evans. Protective. Possessive. Wouldn’t let anyone hurt you. This just…solidifies that. For me at least.”</p><p>Remus pulled back, stilling his hips. Sirius frowned, swallowing thickly.</p><p>“If you don’t feel the same, tell me now, Remus. I’ll…leave, go get a teacher, whatever you need.” He rested his hands against Remus’ thighs again.</p><p>“I-It’s just…” It was hard to have this conversation while he was sitting in Sirius’ lap, on the brink of full-blown heat. “It’s all sudden. And I-“ He stopped, looking down at his body, his shame. Look what his biology was forcing him to do. <em>Weak. Pathetic</em>.</p><p>“Hey. Hey.” Sirius reached up and cupped Remus’ face with both of his hands. “Just let me take care of you. We’ll get through this and parcel it out on the other side, hm? You’re in no state to make decisions-“</p><p>“But this is a decision!” He snapped. “A big one! I don’t know how long I can hang on. I-It’s like…it feels like before I change on the full moon. I have no control over this, it’s pulling me down…”</p><p>“That’s why I want to be here. You shouldn’t have to go through this alone. You’ll be in agony.” Sirius began to rub Remus’ thighs again, slowly, massaging the flesh under his hands. Remus sighed, shifting against Sirius. He could feel Sirius hard beneath him.</p><p>Suddenly, Remus felt overwhelmed by Sirius’ scent. It was different from before. It filled his head. Strong. Heavy.<em> Alpha</em>. His eyes rolled back and he gripped Sirius’ wrists tightly.</p><p>“Is it starting?” Sirius asked. Remus just shuddered. Was this it? Was this the start of his heat? Was this what happened to all other omega? He felt his self-control fall away. He almost felt drunk, cross-eyed and helpless. Remus opened his mouth to speak but all that came out was a whine. He would have felt shame if he’d had room for it, but all he could think was <em>alpha, submit, need</em>.</p><p>He fell forward, burying his face in Sirius’ neck, nipping and biting at his jaw. This was raw instinct. It was like his body knew what to do, even if his mind didn’t. Sirius buried one hand in Remus’ dirty blond hair while the other slid down his back to the base of his spine. He flipped them, pinning Remus on his back, where he knew he wanted to be. Remus whined again, eyes rolling back in his head once more.</p><p>Remus felt some relief once he was on his back, Sirius heavy on top of him, the alpha’s scent covering him. He breathed it in deeply before continuing to lick and bit at Sirius’ jaw.</p><p>It was all Sirius could do to refrain from taking things too far. He knew this would pass. An hour at most, if not a bit more. He didn’t want to scare Remus. He did, genuinely, want to help him. And he knew this would. He presence, his touch, his scent. Remus needed it. He knew the licking and biting instinct immediately. A show of reverence. Remus was also scenting him, marking him and his clothes and his hair. He knew it would linger for days, but he found himself not minding at all. What Remus did next, however, almost made him lose his composure.</p><p>The boy beneath him turned his head to the side, baring his neck to Sirius. Kissing it before was nothing. But this? This show of submissiveness, of offering? Sirius couldn’t help but bear his teeth. He reached down and turned Remus’ face so they were eye to eye, and he saw panic there. But Sirius had to refuse the offering. Remus was in full throw of his heat now, and Sirius refused to take advantage.</p><p>“Please?” Remus’ voice was small and raspy. “You wanted to help me. Help me!”</p><p>He bared his neck again, arching his back. Sirius felt a growl rise in his throat. It would be easy. And Remus was so willing…</p><p>He shook his head. His instincts were starting to take over as well, likely a cause of Remus’ pheromones. James’ words played back in his head, <em>Come on, it’s </em>Remus<em>!, </em>but isn’t that why he was doing this? This was Remus. Remus could be his. Remus <em>was</em> his…</p><p>He bent forward and quickly sank his teeth into the flesh of Remus’ neck. The sound Remus made was unearthly. A heady mix between a moan and cry. The omega arched his back again, his fingers digging into Sirius’ back. Sirius ground his hips down, pinning Remus further, causing him to clamor. He wrapped his legs around Sirius’ waist.</p><p>Sirius’ mind went wild. A bond was a promise. A month long commitment. But what was a month? Especially with Remus.</p><p><em>Remus, Remus</em>. The name went around in his mind like a hurricane. He licked over the mark he had made. They were in this now. In for penny, in for a pound. He pulled away, and Remus whined, but Sirius made quick work. He slipped his pajama pants off, tossing them onto the foot of the bed. His cock, now free, stood up flush against his stomach. Remus stared, as if in awe. He’d seen Sirius naked before, but this was different.</p><p>“Sirius. Yes…need you.” He couldn’t string words together, but he didn’t need to. The bond made it easier to do this, it seemed, and all of Remus’ protestations were gone.</p><p>Sirius peeled off Remus’ boxers, noticing how soaked they were. He threw them down to join his pajama bottoms, and wasted no further time.</p><p>Remus was open and ready from his heat. Sirius was running on instinct. He’d never gotten this far, sure he’d had some awkward hand jobs after a house party, but this? This was beyond his realm of expertise. But he knew what he needed to do now.</p><p>XXX</p>
