    <p>Remus was having the shittest fucking day ever.</p><p>Technically, it was only nine thirty in the morning, but that didn’t matter because it was a shit as fuck morning and he was sure that meant it would be a shit as fuck day and probably a shit as fuck evening as well because <em>life</em> in general was shit as fuck.</p><p>He was also prone to being overdramatic when the situation called for it.</p><p>It had all kicked off at around seven thirty the evening before when his mum, helpless as ever whenever anyone in need came knocking on the door, had been talked into babysitting their next door neighbours’ baby while they went on date night. A favour that had meant to last until eleven pm at the latest had turned out to take up the entire night since there had been a car crash on the bloody M60 and the couple hadn’t been able to make it past the ensuing traffic jam.</p><p>Remus, who hadn’t minded the baby <em>much</em> since she had been asleep while he’d worked on the first of his assignments, quickly discovered a deep hatred for anything under eighteen months old. Dora had howled throughout the entire night, effectively butchering any chances he had of writing a coherent essay. She’d even kept him up until there had been actual <em>birds</em> tweeting outside.</p><p>Exactly two hours later, the alarm on his phone had screamed into his ear.</p><p>So of course, he had smothered it with his pillow and fallen right back asleep until his mother, on a sudden stroke of realisation, had crept into his room and tentatively shook him awake with a, “Darling, don’t you have class at nine?”</p><p>It had been eight twenty.</p><p>The uni was just under an hour away at this time.</p><p>So of course, Remus had practically flown out of bed, had the quickest shower known to man where he didn’t even get to give the writing engraved across his chest its cursory glance of the day, and had reached across Dora to grab a piece of toast from a plate on the table –</p><p>When she’d promptly thrown up on his arm.</p><p>Forty minutes later, he sat at the bus stop and scowled at the grey streets of Cokeworth. It figured that on the day when everything else in the world seemed to be going wrong for him, the bus was fucking twenty minutes late. Not five, not even ten, but fucking <em>twenty.</em> What the fuck was <em>wrong</em> with Stagecoach? What was wrong with the goddamn world in general? Was it Shit on Remus Day or something?</p><p>He tipped his head back and drew a deep breath in through his nose.</p><p>He needed to calm down. Sure, today was off to an awful start, but if he kept up like this, he’d end up taking it out on Lily when they met up at lunch and Lord knew offending Lily Evans wasn’t something anyone wanted to do. More likely than not, she’d simply brush it off with a pointed remark that would make him feel even worse than before. In the unlikely event that he did manage to hurt her, the sharp glimmer of tears in her eyes would probably destroy him before her soulmate did.</p><p>Remus had been wrapped around Lily’s finger since the very first day of secondary school when she’d sat down beside him in Maths and proudly rattled off the bloody quadratic formula – and everyone knew it.</p><p>It was a fact that had initially alarmed James, resulting in many childish barbs and inflated chests – all of which had made Lily cross her arms and ignore him and huff about him at such great length that Remus had known that she was not as impervious to Potter’s charm as she liked to believe – until Remus had finally rolled his eyes, tugged him aside and bluntly told him he was gay.</p><p>Since then, James had declared undying loyalty to him and insisted that he should hang out with ‘the gang’ sometime.</p><p>Which was a bit difficult to do when Lily kept running in the other direction whenever she saw James at uni.</p><p>Just as Remus began to ponder how to ask her just who she thought she was fooling when she claimed to hate James, the bus finally rolled to a stop in front of him. Feeling faint annoyance sizzle in him at how long it had taken, Remus jumped up and joined the queue, impatiently jiggling his leg as he mentally yelled at everyone in front of him to hurry the fuck up. Jesus Christ, did the bus driver have to count the change so <em>slowly?</em></p><p>Of course, when it was his time to flash his uni rider at the driver, he was nothing short of polite. “Thank you,” he said, none of the irritation blaring in his mind slipping into his voice.</p><p>He turned to face the bottom deck and had to bite back a groan: it was jam-packed.</p><p>The noise from upstairs let him know that it boasted a similar situation and in any case, he wasn’t feeling brave enough to go all the way up just to find himself confronted with no seats. Resigned to his fate, Remus moved forward until he found a safe-looking position by the wheelchair access area, back pressed against the nearest pole.</p><p>A minute later, the bus set off at the slowest speed known to man.</p><p>Remus gritted his teeth and turned the music on his phone as loud as it would go.</p><p>It was going to be the longest forty minutes of his life. He felt like a sardine packed into a tin of other sardines, ones who stank of piss and sweat and old newspapers – there was a white guy with dreadlocks who bobbed his head to a non-existent beat and swayed too close to him for his comfort, a small woman whose vacant stare just so happened to line up with the general position of his crotch, and the bus driver who seemed to be under the impression that he was twenty minutes <em>early</em> at the speed he was going. Words couldn’t describe the frustration Remus felt, but he was sure he’d do his best in a Twitter tirade once he was off this hellhole.</p><p>After twenty minutes of Dreads trying to melt into him by diffusion, Remus decided he’d had enough. He didn’t care if he had to fight through the fifty odd people crammed onto the bottom deck, he was going to sit on the stairs if it bloody well killed him. Steeling himself for the battle ahead, he let go of the pole behind him, took a couple of tentative steps…</p><p>And the bus slammed to a stop.</p><p>He flew forward before he had a second to think, his body slamming into the figure in front of him. Desperately, he scrambled for a grip just so he could remain upright – God, it would be just his luck to faceplant on a bloody bus, wouldn’t it? – and then he was practically wrenching the other person’s arm out of their socket and his other hand was fluttering around for a purchase and –</p><p>Jesus Christ, he was <em>holding their hand</em>.</p><p>He was holding a stranger’s hand.</p><p>On the bus.</p><p>Someone needed to <em>hit him</em> with a bus right at this second.</p><p>Horrified, Remus snatched his hand away. “Fuck! I mean – shit, I mean – oh my god, I’m so sorry, I…” He trailed off, turning red as the person turned to smirk up at him and Jesus Christ was he good looking.</p><p>Good looking in that way that didn’t make sense. Remus’ brain short-circuited as he tried to comprehend how someone could look so beautiful, beautiful in such a vicious, savage sort of way like the coldest aristocrats in the world had gathered together to carve his face. It was sharp with Roman cheekbones and a perfectly straight English nose and a plump mouth that curled at one corner with obvious amusement. Dark waves of hair tumbled down, falling into silver flints of eyes.</p><p>Remus felt something seize deep inside of him.</p><p>“Sorry,” he muttered, mortified.</p><p>He tossed a helpless glance around and noticed with some relief that the woman who had been accidentally gazing at his crotch had vacated her seat so he pounced on it, desperate to get away. It was no use, however. No sooner had he dropped down did the man next to him sharply glance up from his phone to the world outside, let out a decisively inappropriate curse and leap up to flee before the doors shut. Moments later, the beautiful boy claimed the empty seat.</p><p>He turned to Remus, still smirking in a way that made the back of Remus’ neck flush pink. “You know, I’ve always dreamt of being groped on public transport,” he said at last, “but that’s not quite what I imagined.”</p><p>Remus could only stare at him. “I – what?”</p><p>“I mean, you must’ve seen some videos about it,” the boy continued. “Boy flirts with boy on an empty bus and the next thing you know…” He made a gesture that was more inappropriate than the other man’s words.</p><p>Remus turned red. “I…” And then it dawned on him what the boy had said. “I’m sorry, what did you say?”</p><p>“I said that the flirting usually leads to se – “</p><p>“No, before that,” he said impatiently, too distracted to blush. “What you first said to me.”</p><p>“Oh.” Understanding dawned on the boy’s face. He smirked, enunciating each word so deliberately, it felt like a caress. “I said I’ve always dreamt of being groped on public transport.”</p><p>All the air was knocked out of Remus’ lungs. He couldn’t even form a coherent thought, let alone a <em>reply</em> as he stared at this viciously beautiful boy who had uttered the words that had been imprinted on his chest for as long as he could remember.</p><p>It had been something of a point of shame, his soulmate mark, as he had been growing up. His parents had winced, wondering just what kind of girl he was going to eventually bring home. His classmates had jeered in the changing rooms, some of them slapping him on the back for finding himself someone ready to get “down and dirty” as Mulciber had put it in Year Eleven. Even Lily had cocked her head to the side and commended him for managing to get something worse than hers.</p><p>(<em>Jesus Christ, woman, that was my fucking foot!</em> cried the looping script on her chest.)</p><p>“Oh,” he finally managed.</p><p>The boy’s smirk softened into a smile. “Hi,” he said much more gently. He held out his hand. “I’m Sirius.”</p><p>Still half in a daze, Remus reached out to shake it. It felt strong. Warm. “Remus.”</p><p>“Like the son of Mars.”</p><p>They were still gripping hands. “Yeah. You’re named after the star, right?”</p><p>“Orion’s dog.” Sirius’ soft smile had a bitter twang for a brief moment, his hand tightening on Remus’. He let them both relax. “So, <em>Remus – “ </em>The name left his tongue coloured with triumph. “You don’t have any plans, do you? Because there’s a great place in town called The Leaky I bet you’re dying to eat at.”</p><p>He thought of the assignments he hadn’t yet managed to get around to, to the dodgy conclusion on his essay for Capitalism In Historical Perspective class and his prior determination to get some done in the time he was supposed to spend in a Microeconomics Analysis lecture.</p><p>“Sure,” he said.</p><p>Sirius smiled at him so brilliantly that he could already feel his day looking up.</p>
