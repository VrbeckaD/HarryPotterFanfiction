  <strong> <u>Chapter 1</u> </strong>
</p><p>Hiyori, a muggle-born witch, gets an acceptance letter to Hogwarts. After going to Diagon Alley to collect her school things (and an owl called Sky) Hiyori arrives at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <u>Chapter 2 </u> </strong>
</p><p>Hiyori learns that Slytherin has a bad reputation and is known for its hatred of non-pure wizards, which bothers Hiyori as they seem to target her a bit. Hiyori later has her first flying lesson which ends in disaster as she managed to shoot across the courtyard and crash into a student, which happen to be Yato who is a Slytherin second year student. Hiyori scrambles to get off him and finds she’s hurt her wrist, and destroyed the schools broom. On the verge of tears, Yato tries to comfort her but Professor Tsuyu comes over and takes Hiyori to the infirmary.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <u>Chapter 3 </u> </strong>
</p><p>Yato is walking through the castle at night and comes across some Slytherin students bullying a first year Hufflepuff student, Yukine. Yato steps in and uses a spell to get rid of the bullies, and gives Yukine some advice that he ignores, claiming he can protect himself. A few days later Hiyori is in class and meets Yukine, and teaches him ‘Wingadrium Leviosa’. After class, they are talking and Yato appears, which scares Hiyori as Yato is a Slytherin and Hiyori is sure he’s out to get revenge on her. As she runs away, Yato follows Yukine and asks about Hiyori and tries to enlist his help to get her to talk to him, which fails.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <u>Chapter 4</u> </strong>
</p><p>Yato finds Yato after class with another Hufflepuff, Suzuha, and asks where Hiyori is. Yukine tells him what class she has and Yato goes to find her. He finds her on the staircase and tries to stop her, but she vanishes into a corridor and the staircase moves before he can catch up to her. Hiyori, not noticing that she has ran into an empty corridor, bumps into the same Slytherin students that had caused her trouble before. They push Hiyori to the ground and empty her bag, ruining her books by printing ‘Mudblood’ across the pages. Hiyori goes to her class, pretending nothing is wrong. Her friends, Aimi (Ravenclaw first year) and Yama (Hufflepuff first year) ask what happened, and who Yato, to which Hiyori responses that she doesn’t know him. After failing a transfiguration spell, Professor Kuguha reprimands her with a jibe over a muggle possessing magic.</p><p> Yato continues his search for Hiyori, but bumps into Nora who has enrolled in Hogwarts that year. She tells Yato he should be hanging around with ‘mudbloods’, and says that Father will hear about this which makes Yato tense up.</p><p>Later on Bishamon notices Hiyori is upset, and is angry when she finds out what the bullies did to her books. She fixes them and comforts Hiyori</p><p>Hiyori is still avoiding Yato, going to the extent of running from him to the girls bathroom during the Halloween feast. Halfway through the feast Kuguha runs in and shouts there is a troll in the dungeon before fainting. With the school thrown into chaos and students ordered back to their dorms, Yato slips away when he realises Hiyori hadn’t turned up and was probably still in hiding, running to the dungeons he hears a scream from a corridor and runs to it, barrelling into the girls bathroom to find Hiyori face to face with the troll. He tells her to run but she is too scared to move, narrowly being missed by the trolls club as Yato decides that the only way would be to drag her out himself. Using a variety of advanced spells Yato fights the troll, but Hiyori saves him using ‘Wingardium Leviosa’ to knock the troll out, making Yato push Hiyori out of the way before it can fall on them.</p><p>When Hiyori goes to run away again, Yato blocks the exit and forces her to talk, offhandedly saying he care if she’s a ‘mudblood’. Hiyori spills out about how Slytherins hate people like her and that she wouldn’t be in Hogwarts if she didn’t have magic. Yato is surprised by her outburst and apologises for calling her a mudblood, and tells her that he didn’t have the same narrowminded views of some Slytherin students regarding blood purity. Now at peace, Yato introduces himself to Hiyori just as the teachers arrive to the carnage of the knocked-out troll and the two students.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <u>Chapter 5</u> </strong>
</p><p>Professor Tenjin asks Yato and Hiyori what happened with the troll, and they claim that it had just ‘fainted’, which he reluctantly accepts. Professor Tsuyu takes Hiyori back to her dorms whilst professor Tenjin takes Yato back to Slytherin dorms, telling him that he knows that he wanders around at night and that he should go to class.</p><p>In a Quidditch match against Gryffindor and Slytherin, Hiyori watches from the stands and recognises Yato as Slytherins Keeper when he decides to surf his broom and catch the Snitch, falling and landing heavily on his arm in the process.</p><p>Yato pretends to have broken his arm, despite having it mended in the infirmary, so that he won’t have to write in class. When Hiyori sees it, she assumes he’s too badly hurt to have it fixed, and Yato complains he can’t get to class carrying his bag. Aimi and Yama overhear this and volunteer Hiyori to carry his bag for him, which she hurriedly does as Yato beams and strides towards his classroom.</p><p>Hiyori loses Yato in the crowd and ends up in a deserted corridor where she runs into one of the Slytherin bullies. He taunts her about being a Squib and grabs her, but Yato appears and threatens him, making him leave. Yato asks if she’s ok but Hiyori notices that Yato’s ‘injured’ arm isn’t in his sling any more. She drops his bag in disgust when he tries to justify it as a joke, but this makes hiyori even more upset to the point that she cries, telling him that being messed around with is not a joke. She leaves in tears as Yato offers a weak apology.</p><p> </p><p>

Bishamon catches sight of Yato and turns hostile to the point where her hair begins to turn red, and Hiyori recalls that she is a metamorphagus and her hair changes colour according to her mood – which is normally anger. Hiyori quickly interrupts, telling Bishamon that Yato is the one who helped her with her bully problem with pacifies Bishamon slightly but not enough for her to tolerate him.</p><p>Yukine and Hiyori have Defence Against the Dark Arts class together where they must use the Knockback Jinx which they both struggle with for the whole class. Once dismissed a snowball suddenly flies at Yukine and hits him in the back and knocks him over. Hiyori spins around to see Yato armed with more snowballs and jeering, telling Yukine to defend himself since they’re in a defence class. Yato tells them that they are holding their wands wrong and shows Yukine how to do the spell properly, and after a few tries manages it. However when Hiyori tries she can’t do it, so Yato suggests a moving target or an opponent would be move useful. Hiyori is hesitant when Yato tells her to use the spell on him, not wanting to hurt him, but when he taunts her she forgets her apprehensively and uses the spell, perfectly hitting him in the chest which surprises Yato and makes Yukine cheer.</p><p> </p><p>
