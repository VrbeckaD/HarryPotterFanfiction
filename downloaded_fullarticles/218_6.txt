    <p> </p><p>Hermione Granger did not hesitate.</p><p>Brainy bookworm though she was, she was a Gryffindor to her core: as subtle as a Bludger to the face, and as cautious as a bull at a gate. She spoke out, charged ahead, and crashed through. True, she had always had a greater tendency to pause for thought when it was warranted than either of her best friends, but she did not, ever, <em>hesitate</em>.</p><p>Yet with the door of the Potions classroom in front of her, she was hesitating now.</p><p>There was absolutely no reason to do so. The room was empty — she knew it was. Professor Slughorn had left a week ago. It was days before students would start arriving for the start of the new school year, and no other staff member would have a reason to be down here, in the dungeons, in this particular classroom.</p><p>Was it remembered nerves that held her motionless? Years of knowing that Professor Snape was on the other side of that door, ready to pounce on the slightest mistake and eager to humiliate anyone who displeased him?</p><p><em>No</em>. Because, as terrifying as he’d been — and he’d been terrifying, especially in those years when they hadn’t been entirely sure of his true loyalty — Hermione had never been frightened of his <em>classes</em>. Intimidated, yes, at times, by how very much he knew and how very paltry her own understanding of the subject was in comparison, but that had driven her to work harder and do better. She had at times feared him, but she had never feared Potions.</p><p>Even if she had feared him, even if she <em>had</em> been one of the students who had to brace themselves to step over the threshold of his classroom, that would have been no reason to stand frozen with one hand on the door now.</p><p><em>Because he isn</em><em>’t there</em>. <em>You know he isn</em><em>’t there. </em></p><p><em>You</em> <em>’re one of three people who can be surer than anyone else in the world he isn’t there. </em></p><p><em>Because you</em> <em>’re one of the three people who stood there and watched him die.</em></p><p>
