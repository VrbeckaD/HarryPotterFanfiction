    <p>Hermione sits at her desk, a large piece of parchment held in her hands. Her eyes quickly skim over the words, trying not to despair at the latest report from the MACUSA aurors on their repeated failures at defeating the dark wizard currently occupying the White House.</p><p>“Merlin’s beard, we were teenagers when we defeated the most powerful dark wizard of all time, this shouldn’t be so difficult,” she murmurs under her breath. She had complete faith in MACUSA, but almost three years into his rise to power and she was starting to get properly worried.</p><p>A quiet knock startles her out of her revery.</p><p>“Come in,” she calls out. A young man in dark green robes and carrying an even larger piece of parchment enters the room. “Ah, Tod, what is it?”</p><p>“Minister, they’ve voted,” Tod responds, a note of worry in his voice.</p><p>“And I take it Mr Cu--Fuck--Hunt didn’t win?” she asks, unhappy at the result, but silently grateful that she won’t have to spend the near future trying not to call the Other Minister a dirty word.</p><p>“Yes,” Tod answers. Hermione sighs.</p><p>“Well, that’s unfortunate, but nothing to be done. When does he move into Downing Street?”</p><p>“After his audience with the Muggle Queen, tomorrow.”</p><p>“Alright, please set up a meeting with Her Majesty for this evening.”</p><p>“Yes, Minister. Anything else?”</p><p>“Please have some appropriate Muggle clothes brought up--one of those suits Theresa always wears should do, though try for something a little less mature.”</p><p>“Yes, Minister.”</p><p>“And please send an owl to Ron and tell him I’ll be home late.”</p><p>“Yes, Minister.”</p><p>“Thank you, Tod.” </p><p>Tod leaves after depositing the report of the Muggle election on her full desk.<br/>
Hermione rests her head in her hands. “Who would have thought that I’d miss Theresa?”</p>
