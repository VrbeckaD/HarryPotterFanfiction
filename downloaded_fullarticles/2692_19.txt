          <div class="userstuff"><p>“I hoped alcohol would burn away, the thought of you... instead it fuels the fire slowly, building in the room..”<br/>——<br/>——<br/>——<br/>Sitting in a muggle bar and downing a couple more shot of fire whiskey, I begin to feel sad. The alcohol slowly burns my throat as I try to make myself feel numb. Why must Draco and I always have problems? Does he even like me? Am I really that annoying to him?? I shake my head quickly and suddenly feel dizzy. I stumble towards the bathroom and my hands clench the sink. I look like shit.. my hair is all over the place, my skin is pale, and my eyes have sunken in. I’m really going over the edge. Why’d I let myself go this long??<br/>*knock, knock, knock*<br/>“Yeah, yeah I’m getting out.”<br/>I stumble out of the bathroom and walk outside towards and alley. I take a couple deep breaths and apparate back home.<br/>The house is cold and dark. It looks like I haven’t lived here in years. Why do I even bother coming back? Oh, yeah, so I don’t have to face the world.<br/>Draco and I, man.. we were together, we really were for at least two years. Until, we had a huge fight and I can barely remember what it’s about now, but for some reason it drove us apart. We called each-other cruel names and said rude remarks and he just packed his bags and left. For the first few days I was happy as hell he was gone but now, five months later, I feel like I can’t live anymore. A piece of my soul is with him. A piece that I can’t live without. I need him, so much. What if I say something, and he doesn’t want me back? What if he’s moved on? What if he’s waiting for me?? What if he’s not? I ask myself these questions EVERYDAY. It’s to the point where I feel like I’m going insane. I barely eat, and all I do is drink. Ron and Hermione have tried to talk and help me, but I’ve blown them off so much that I haven’t seen them in about a month? I feel so isolated and it’s all my fault..<br/>——<br/>——<br/>——<br/>ANOTHER MONTH GOES BY.<br/>——<br/>——<br/>——<br/>It’s Christmas time. I’m still feeling like shit, yes, but a lot less. I think it’s time I work up the courage and talk to Draco. I believe it’s best, and it’s worth trying then not trying at all.<br/>I apparate in front of Draco’s house.<br/>His kitchen lights on. Maybe he’s baking or reading the newspaper which he tends to do a lot. Wow, just being here fills me with so many memories.<br/>I begin to breathe heavily and I start to gain up the courage.<br/>I being to knock quickly.<br/>Hopefully I didn’t startle Draco.<br/>I tried to dress somewhat my best. I wore a red jumper and some dark jeans.<br/>The door slowly opens, and Draco stares back at me with disbelief.<br/>“Uh, what a surprise. What are you doing here H-Potter.”<br/>Wow, back to a last name basis, well not on my watch.<br/>“Hi Draco, this was a last minute plan. May I come in? I’d like to talk to you if you wouldn’t mind.”<br/>“By all means, come on in.”<br/>I walked in as Draco slowly shut the door.<br/>“Do you want some tea or some coffee? I can fix you up your favorite, oh uh– I can fix you up something.”<br/>I smile softly, “no its alright Draco thank you.”<br/>He nods slowly and sits down on the couch. I motion towards the one across from his, but he stops me.<br/>“Just sit by me, I won’t bite.”<br/>I nod and sit by Draco.<br/>My heart starts to beat a mile a minute. Why is it I feel like I can’t breathe whenever I’m around him, oh that’s right.. I’m in LOVE with him. I’ve never told him I loved him, and he’s never told me he loved me out of the 2 years we were together. I think it’s time..<br/>“Listen, Draco. I have some things I want to tell you. First off, I’m sorry, so so sorry, for everything I did that night. For all the things I said to you–“<br/>I begin to tear up, as I continue on.<br/>“–you know they aren’t true. I never ever thought of you that way. I was just mad. It was pointless, and I hope you forgive me.”<br/>He looks up at me with a slight glint in his eyes and he clears his throat.<br/>“Thank you P-Harry. It means a lot coming from you, you know. I would like to apologize as well. All the remarks I said to you weren’t true and I feel incredibly sorry for all the things that happened that night.” I smile back at Draco and continue on with the second, and most important thing I have to tell him.<br/>I take a deep breath. This is hard for me because what if he doesn’t feel the same?<br/>“ I appreciate the apology Draco. Thank you. Now last thing I have to tell you. It’s pretty important and I’m not sure how you’re going to react. We were together for 2 years. The best years of my life. There was never a dull moment with you. Yeah, we’d bicker but I loved it and I know you did to. The times we’d cuddle, kiss, and spend every single moment together. I miss it. I miss it so much that I can’t stop thinking about it. Deep down inside, something I’ve realized over the past few months we’ve been apart is that I love you Draco. I truly love you. I can’t like without you and I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you that sooner. You mean to world to me and more. I’m not sure if you even feel the same, or if you’ve moved on already. I just had to let you know.”<br/>I begin to breathe quickly as I look at his face. Draco’s shocked, shit, did I do something wrong??!<br/>“Oh my god, Draco I’m sorry if I made things worse, shit I’m a terrible pers–“<br/>“Harry shut up. Just give me a couple minutes. I’m just shocked is all. In a good way.”<br/>A tear streams down his face while he smiles softly to himself.<br/>“Harry, I love you.. I love you too. God that took us forever to say didn’t it? And I could never move on, you know. You mean to much to me.”<br/>I smile brightly and lean into Draco.<br/>I hesitantly move closer and kiss him.<br/>He kisses me back.<br/>All the time spent apart, and all the pain we’ve felt being apart was in that kiss.<br/>I’ve missed him so much.<br/>Looking back at myself in May and my alcohol problem, I realize I’ve made the right choice going back to the man I love.<br/>I’ve never felt better.<br/>“Now, let’s head back to your place Harry.”<br/>He holds my hand, and I hold his.<br/>We apparate back.<br/>——<br/>——<br/>——<br/>THE END.</p></div>
