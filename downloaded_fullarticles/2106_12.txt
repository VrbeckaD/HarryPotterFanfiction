</p><p align="center">THROUGH A GLASS, DARKLY</p><p align="left">Draco walked down a corridor as dark as his mood, staring at the aged tiles spread out before him. Returning for eighth year was turning out to be the hardest thing he’d ever done. No matter where he went, she was there.<br/> <br/> Haunting him.<br/> <br/> His heart ached for her.<br/> <br/> Hearing a footstep, he followed the sound to a door hidden in the shadows. The echo could have been coming from any direction as it reverberated around the cold stone walls, but this door seemed to beckon to him. Draco turned the iron handle and stepped in, looking up to find her smiling and reaching for him. His heart leapt as he ran, only to come face to face with an image of himself appearing and embracing his witch. She laughed as this imposter swung her around, stealing a passionate kiss. Draco fell to his knees, realising he had discovered the Mirror of Erised. <em> Why? </em> Wasn’t he tormented enough?<br/> <br/> Another footstep. Tears pricked his eyes as he threw himself forward, his fingers clawing at the glass. “Please,” he cried. “Hermione! Why can’t I love you?”<br/> <br/> Images floated before him, tearing at his dying heart. More footsteps echoed in his ears as he watched; wild curls draped across silk sheets, her naked body writhing in ecstasy as his image kisses her breasts and fills her womb. A little girl with her eyes and his colouring, climbing up onto a chair in his library to mimic her mother’s love of knowledge. A smaller boy, sitting on a toy broomstick and flying around the Manor’s rose garden, his older sister chastising him with her hands on her hips.<br/> <br/> Draco bowed his head and sobbed. The footsteps were louder now and, through his tears, he heard her voice. <em> Why are the Gods torturing me? </em><br/> <br/> He felt a small hand gently rest on his shoulder. <em> Stop this fucking persecution! </em><br/> <br/> “You’re not real,” he spat. “You’re not here.”<br/> <br/> “I am.”<br/> <br/> “If you’re so fucking real—” he stabbed a finger towards the Mirror, “—then tell me what you see in <em> that.” </em><br/> <br/> “I see you, Draco. I see you swinging me around, making me laugh before you kiss me. I see us making love; I see our daughter and our son.” Hermione knelt beside him, reaching to take his tear-stained cheeks in her hands. “I see what you do... because I want it, too.”</p>
