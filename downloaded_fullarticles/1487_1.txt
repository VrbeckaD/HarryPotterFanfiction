    <p align="center">“We sit and talk,<br/>
quietly, with long lapses of silence<br/>
and I am aware of the stream<br/>
that has no language, coursing<br/>
beneath the quiet heaven of<br/>
your eyes<br/>
which has no speech.”<br/>
William Carlos Williams</p><p>As the other students pushed their way through the carriages of the Hogwarts Express, eager to get in their last goodbyes before finding their parents on the platform, Scorpius Malfoy stayed behind - slowly packing his things and stowing the food from the journey in his pockets. He was excited to see his parents, whom he hadn’t seen since Christmas, but he was reluctant to leave the relative safety of the locked compartment for the loud bustle of King’s Cross station.</p><p>His shoulders and neck were still itchy from whatever unknown powder two third year Slytherin and Gryffindor students had thrown at him as he boarded the train in Hogsmeade. He’d managed to get most of it off, but there were still irritable patches of red skin peeking out from underneath his green jumper.</p><p>Once the train seemed comparatively quiet - he lifted his suitcase and unlocked the clasp on the compartment door before stepping outside. The windows to the carriage had been thrown open as they approached the station, students eager to catch a glimpse of their envious siblings and beaming parents. He could hear the chatter of the families as he peered out of the open windows, trying in vain to spot his parents through the smoke of the train.</p><p>He could feel someone watching him, before he turned and spotted Albus Potter standing at a window just down the corridor. He still got a thrill of excitement every time he saw the Gryffindor student. He looked so much like his father, with those piercing green eyes, it was like he’d stepped right out of the history books in the Malfoy library. But he’d changed so much over their first three years at Hogwarts. His eyes were darker, his skin was sallow - he moved about the castle like a ghost.</p><p>Scorpius wouldn’t pretend to know the source of the boy’s unhappiness, he could only guess at it from what he’d observed throughout the years. He wasn’t doing well in his classes and he was almost as unpopular as Scorpius himself. He knew how it felt to be invisible at that school. So whenever he ran into Albus, he tried to communicate with him. Through stuttering conversations and furtive glances - he hoped he expressed what words could not. <em><em>‘You’re not alone. It’s okay. It’ll be okay.’ </em></em>But the message was always lost.</p><p>Albus Potter was still watching him, from across the corridor. He opened his mouth to speak. And then, suddenly, the moment was broken. Albus pulled his robes around him and glanced away, before turning and making his way off the train, and all Scorpius could do was watch in silence - lost and hopeful, all at once.</p><p align="center">─────:•☾☼☽•:─────</p><p>On the first day of September, Scorpius looked for Albus on the platform. But he couldn’t find him anywhere in the sea of families and students. He searched for the familiar sight of witches and wizards staring and pointing at what always turned out to be just another family dropping their children off for another year at Hogwarts - their dark haired father beaming down at them through round glasses. But Harry Potter was nowhere in sight.</p><p>Confused and a little heartbroken, Scorpius boarded the train and found an empty compartment - only just having the foresight to lock the door behind him before he sat down. He tossed his suitcase on the seat opposite and sighed, pulling his copy of ‘Hogwarts: A History’ out of the side pocket and glancing at the students making their way through the corridor - hoping to catch a glimpse of that familiar black hair and those deep green eyes.</p><p>Would Albus look for him? However much he wanted to be friends with him, they’d never crossed that line. All there was between them were glances in hallways and shared cauldrons in potions class when everyone else refused to sit with them. There was an afternoon in the first term of second year - he was sitting alone outside the Great Hall, when he felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Albus, warning him that three Gryffindors were about to try and sneak a potion into his lunch. Before he could thank him, he was already gone.</p><p>There was no escaping the fact that Albus Potter didn’t want to be around him. And he respected that. What little popularity the boy had would disappear as soon as he so much as acknowledged Scorpius. He tried not to be hurt by that fact, and he wasn’t. If all they would ever share was solidarity over their Hogwarts experience, he was satisfied with that. But maybe he was just fooling himself.</p><p>Scorpius looked up from his book and glanced around the sun dappled compartment. There was muffled laughter from a group of unseen students in the corridor. He absentmindedly ran his fingers down the pages of his book, breathing in the scent and thinking of home. He wondered what his mother was doing at that moment. They would have surely arrived back at the manor by now, his father returning to his office and his mother going to the library or the garden to spend her afternoon.</p><p>A lump rose in his throat at the thought of her and he blinked at the window, biting his lip. He hated leaving her at King’s Cross. She wasn’t getting any better. It hadn’t escaped his notice how different she was when he returned home after first, second, and third year. And he hated to think of her - shut away in the manor, waiting for him to come home as her health deteriorated.</p><p>There was a sudden temptation to burst out of his compartment, run to the front of the train, and beg to be taken back to London. But he pushed it away and returned to his book.</p><p>Before he knew it, they were pulling into Hogsmeade and the quiet corridor was suddenly full of students again. He waited until most of them were gone before he grabbed his suitcase and made his way off the train. In the fading light of the early evening, he searched for Albus on the platform. He spotted Polly Chapman and Yann Fredericks, two students he often saw with Albus, but he wasn’t with them.</p><p>He wasn’t at dinner either, although Scorpius told himself it was impossible to spot anyone at the welcome feast on the first day back at Hogwarts. On the way down to the Slytherin common room, he was stopped in the hallway by Craig Bowker. A student from his house - they sometimes sat together at meals or in classes. He knew Craig had other friends, and he only spoke to Scorpius when he wanted something, but he tried not to mind it.</p><p>“I didn’t see you on the train, Scorpius! You know you’re allowed to come sit with us in our compartment, don’t you?” He asked, falling into step with him.</p><p>Scorpius frowned, glancing over at him as they walked. “Your friends don’t like me. I thought you knew that.”</p><p>Craig spluttered, almost missing a step on the staircase. “That’s not true. April likes you.”</p><p>“April boiled my potions essay while I was stocking up on ingredients and then almost tripped me up the stairs before an astronomy lesson,” he replied, dodging students in the hallway. He spotted someone who looked like they could have been Hugo Granger-Weasley, Rose’s brother, and a thought occurred to him. “Have you seen Albus Potter yet?”</p><p>“No. Why? Are you looking for him?”</p><p>Scorpius shook his head and ducked into the Slytherin common room, after the group of first years and the preening prefect. “I didn’t see him on the train or at dinner. I was just wondering where he was.”</p><p>“That’s weird. Maybe he missed the train?” Craig suggested, still following after him. “I haven’t seen his brother or sister either.”</p><p>Scorpius stopped and looked at Craig with sudden concern. James and Lily Potter weren’t at school either? “Do you think something happened?”</p><p>He shrugged and stepped behind one of the large sofas, allowing a gaggle of students to push past them. “I’m sure we’ll find out by morning. They are Potters, after all. We know where they are, when they are, and what they had for breakfast - thanks to the Daily Prophet. But why are you so worried about them?”</p><p>Scorpius made an excuse and quickly extracted himself from the conversation, insisting he was tired and he had a lot of unpacking to do. Truthfully he just wanted to be alone. He went to bed that night with anxiety filling his chest and seeping into his heart. Something felt deeply wrong, but he couldn’t say how or why. Albus’ absence gnawed at his conscience and filled his dreams with traffic accidents and sudden illnesses.</p><p>The next morning, he was late for breakfast. He debated skipping it altogether and staying in the common room until his first class of the day - potions with Professor Zaveri - but eventually his stomach won out and he begrudgingly made his way upstairs to the Great Hall. By the time he arrived, half the students had already left and the rest were moving about the long tables and catching up with their friends.</p><p>He ate his pumpkin pasties in silence, looking up only when he heard another student say Albus’ name. It was the third time that morning someone had mentioned him, but Scorpius had only been able to overhear snatches of conversations. He wondered why they were talking about him. It was on his mind, as he made his way back down to the dungeons for his potions class, and stayed there throughout the lesson.</p><p>The student he was working with said something and he looked up, taking in their expression of alarm. He frowned and looked at the bubbling mixture in the cauldron. It seemed fine. But was it meant to be that colour? And why did it smell so strange? He turned to the other student and opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off when the potion exploded in his face.</p>
