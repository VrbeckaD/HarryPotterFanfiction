  <b>September 1 1996 </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione Granger stepped onto Platform Nine and Three Quarters knowing everything had changed and there was only one thing she could do now. She reached up to her chest to touch the present she had received as an early birthday present from Remus Lupin. He had told her it was a gift from an old friend to remind him there was always time for happiness in hard times, and she should take those moments and not let herself waste away studying. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>This year for Hermione was going to be different. She wasn’t going to try and be the best anymore; she could get the top grades in her sleep. This year she was going to spend time with her friends and try not to push them so hard. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Entering the train she walked to their old carriage and took her seat, looking at the carvings on the wall she noticed the nicknames of the Marauders, Lily and someone she had never heard of, Hermione Quintin. She’d have to write to Remus and ask him about the girl who had the same name as her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry, Ron and Ginny entered and took their seats, asking what she had been up to since she had left the Burrow three weeks earlier. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I had some family things to take care of, sorry I didn’t explain, with the war about to start full force I wanted to spend some time with them, in case things don’t go the way we want them to.” The looks they gave her made her angry, she didn’t want their pity. Her parents were Muggles; they were in danger, so she had to spend time with them cementing their memories in her head before Remus and Kingsley helped her take their memories and put them into hiding. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus and Kingsley had come to her at the beginning of the summer offering to help her; they knew because she was friends with Harry her parents would be placed in danger, and they weren’t going to let her do this by herself. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She was a teenager and didn’t understand the ways of memory charms. They could remove the memories in a way that she could restore them after the war was over if it went the way they hoped. If it went the other way they would be none the wiser and they would be safe in Australia. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The plan was to wait until the next summer holidays to do it...if they needed to do it before then they would find a way for Hermione to say her goodbyes, and they wouldn’t tell anyone but the three of them what had been done, in case someone accidentally let it slip. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She knew if Harry knew what she had been doing, he would feel like it was his fault, and she couldn’t have this on his shoulders on top of everything else. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione let herself drift off for a while and not let anyone break her, she knew others had entered the carriage and she probably should have said hello, but since the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and her being hit by Dolohov’s curse, she preferred to only converse with a select few. Remus had been one of those. He had been there next to her when she woke up in the Hospital Wing and hadn’t left her side for days. When he had told her Sirius had died he looked at her as if she was one crack away from breaking. Why would it affect her? She hadn’t known him that well and he seemed to dislike her. Whenever she entered a room that he was in alone, or when they were discussing something, he would clam up and race out of the room. If they were passing in the hallway he would try and stay away from her. Not wanting to touch her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>If she was honest his behaviour towards her did hurt, because he wasn’t like that with anyone else. Remus had said he’d warm up to her but it would take some time. Time that they didn’t have now. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus…that was another topic that had come up often. She would go to call him Professor Lupin, he’d smile slightly at her and say, “Now, I’m not your professor anymore, please call me Remus, it makes me uncomfortable to be called professor.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She thought this was applicable to everyone, but one day Ginny had tried to call him Remus and he scowled at her. Mrs Weasley didn’t like how often she would find the two of them in the library, but when she would try and say anything, the other order members would tell her they were simply reading at the same time. If Hermione was honest, her crush from her third year had grown in the times they spent in the library or drinking hot chocolate in the dining room. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hermione…earth to Hermione.” She heard Harry calling out to her and shook herself, “We are almost at Hogwarts! I’ve been trying to get your attention for a couple of minutes, time to get dressed.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione waited for all the males to exit the carriage and, still thinking about the weird conversations she would walk in on that Kingsley and Remus were having, she got dressed into her robes and made sure Crookshanks was ready to go up to the castle. She couldn’t wait for dinner. She was starving, having not eaten since dinner the previous night. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The sorting ceremony was over quickly (the hat song was overly depressing), and dinner encouraged a stilted atmosphere. Then it was off to bed. Hermione helped the first years up to the Common Room and then went to her room and packed her book bag for the next day, deciding she would probably sleep in so she should get everything ready for the morning. Placing her hair up in a messy bun so it didn’t get knotted, she got into her silk pyjamas, and, leaving the gold watch around her neck, she laid down, drifting off as soon as her head hit the pillow. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A moment after she went to sleep, the watch started glowing faintly, and if anyone looked at the hands of the clock they would see them turning anti-clockwise. Hermione sort of faded out of existence for a while and when she came back, she was in a completely different time. </span>
