He’s used to this by now.</p><p>“Do you not dream of your own death?”</p><p>Harry doesn’t turn. This isn’t the first time Voldemort has wandered into his dreams, and it’s best to ignore him.</p><p>Voldemort isn’t having it. He grasps Harry’s shoulder and turns him around.</p><p>“No,” Harry replies, stepping away. “I won’t survive. Why fear?”</p><p>“Pity.” Voldemort’s eyes are oddly soft. He takes Harry’s hand. “I want you to.”</p><p>“Sorry.” Harry smiles. Voldemort returns it.</p><p>Anything is possible in dreams.</p></div>
