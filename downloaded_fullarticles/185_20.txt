    <p>“It’s not that far Sev, we’ll be back in time, I promise.” Lily smiled as she extended an open hand to Severus, a playful urgency in her voice.  He took her warm palm and squeezed, letting out a tense breath as his feet picked up the familiar pace of following her lead.  </p><p>“It’ll be 7:30 soon, I really don’t think it’s such a good idea…” </p><p>Lily shot her sister a knowing look.</p><p>“Then we best hurry. Stay here if you’d like, you can time us.” She tossed Petunia her watch, turned on her heel, and flew down the hill with Severus in tow.</p><p>They briskly walked along the creek that bubbled behind their houses until reaching a familiar old willow tree with a new addition. </p><p>“I wonder who put it up?”</p><p>“Not sure, I’m just glad they did!” Lily released his hand and hopped onto the wooden seat with glee.  Severus smiled gently as he gave her a starting push.  The ropes creaked against their high branch as she flew above the flowing water.  He laughed with her as she swung back and forth, the setting sun flecking her auburn hair with golds and oranges. The colors allowed him to take a deep, grounding breath.</p><p>“Your turn!” Lily offered him the now empty seat.  Severus leaned back against her hands as she pushed him, feet dangling above the creek.  He closed his eyes, relishing the free-falling feeling in his stomach and the lightness in his chest.  Looking down at a giggling Lily, a bright smile in her emerald eyes, he felt a moment of bittersweet disbelief that she was real and he was her companion on this warm spring evening.  He reached higher and higher, his toes grazing green leaves. At the apex of an up swing, Severus glanced at his watch.</p><p>7:28</p><p>His stomach dropped like a brick, smacking him out of the previous euphoria. The feet he could no longer feel raked across the loose gravel as he practically fell off the swing and into Lily.</p><p>“Lils, m-my father, he’ll be home, we’ve gotta...” Severus fumbled out, panic rising in the empty space his stomach had left.</p><p>“I’m so sorry Sev, I lost track…” She trailed off, an ache of empathy blooming in her heart as she watched her friend close in on himself.  He was at least a head taller than her, but when he got like this his presence crumpled into a whisper.</p><p>“You’re going to make it.” The words rushed out as Lily grabbed Severus’ hand and raced back towards the hill. All she could see in her mind’s eye was his back screen door as a fire of determination spread through her and carried them along the water’s edge.</p><p>Severus was thankful Lily was pulling him, for he still could not feel his feet, only the anxiety in his chest.  <i>The hill’s too far</i>, he thought as a new sensation began to prickle around him.  It was magic; not his own or his mother’s, but warm and pressing in, cracking through the empty panic. The pressing grew, and while they were still running, the landscape around them seemed to pause and compress. In one shaky breath, the compression seemed to peak and they were at the top of the hill, clamoring up his back steps.</p><p>When he released Lily’s hand, the magic prickling quieted as he slipped inside, swiftly closing the door with a quick glance to his mother leaning against the sink.</p><p>“GodDAMNIT, Severus, what have I told you about slamming doors in my house!?” he heard his father sharply roar from the front room. His mother shivered minutely at the sound of the front door slamming shut and what Severus could only assume was his father’s briefcase hitting the foyer tile floor. He pulled in a shallow breath, looked up at the kitchen clock: 7:30. Out came an uneven, but triumphant sigh.<br/>

</center><p>“Well, I guess you made it, just in time.” Petunia greeted a flustered, out of breath Lily. Still buzzing from racing Severus home, Lily shook out her head and hands in an attempt to quell the tingling sensation.  She wasn’t sure how they had gotten back in time, just that the alternative was not an option.</p><p>“Something might be wrong with your watch, though,” Petunia said as she handed it back to Lily. “Maybe it needs a new battery? It kind of stopped for a few minutes, like the hands were twitching? But then started moving again at 7:30.”</p><p>Lily smiled at her sister, although it did not reach her eyes, as they walked back to their house.  She thumbed the smooth face of her watch, feeling the prickling in her fingertips simultaneously increase with the shame in her chest as she thought of Severus and how she had almost made him late.<br/>

</center><p>Muffled sounds of the television downstairs crept under Severus’ bedroom door.  He turned over, the weight of his blankets reminding him of the compressing magic from earlier.  In the quiet darkness of his room, he allowed himself to entertain the idea that had been tapping at the back of his mind since he looked at the kitchen clock: <i>Was that magic Lily’s?</i></p><p> </p>

</center><p> </p><p>KRACK</p><p>“Young Master, Mistress has been calling for over an hour, GET UP!” Kreacher screeched.</p><p>As his bedroom drapes were torn open by the insistent house elf, light peaked between Sirius Black’s raven hair strewn across his face. With a groan, he muttered, “Fine,” and threw a stray quaffle at Kreacher.</p><p>KRACK</p><p>Stretching out of bed, Sirius arched his feet on the floor and yawned into his hands.  He absentmindedly chewed a hangnail as he picked around his disheveled room for clean-ish trousers and a t-shirt.  A year ago he had forbidden Kreacher from cleaning his room - it was just a way for the house elf to snoop on behalf of his mother.  Walburga had been furious when Sirius figured out a way to magically block the prying elf (with the help of her “borrowed” wand no less), but his father had been mildly impressed and thus allowed the block to stay in place. Who knew what would happen when Sirius left for Hogwarts; he’d probably come home to clean sheets and boobytraps in his sock drawer.  </p><p>Pulling a white v-neck over his head, Sirius bounded down the stairs, stopping momentarily to ruffle his younger brother’s hair on his way to the dining room.  His mother was clearly already finished with breakfast, sipping her third tea of the morning - only half out of spite for Sirius’ tardiness.  </p><p>As he tucked into his eggs benedict, she said curtly, “This lack of respect for others time will not bode well when you are at Hogwarts, Son,” followed by a drawn out sip of tea.</p><p>“I haven’t even gotten my letter yet, <i>Mother</i>. Still a chance I won’t get to be fashionably late to any classes.” He winked and bit the corner of his buttered toast.</p><p>Walburga scoffed. “You’re a Black, of course you’ll get your letter. Although, I’m still unsure we made the best choice not seeking your placement at Durmstrang.  Hogwarts professors can be a bit <i>soft</i> when it comes to discipline and holding up pureblood standards.”</p><p>Heat prickled across the back of Sirius’ neck from ear to ear as he struggled to swallow his last mouthful.  It was too early to get into a row with her about pureblood elitism, which would most certainly result in an exercise of her <i>hard</i> beliefs about discipline.  He settled for rolling his eyes and changing the subject, “What’s so pressing that I needed to be up early on a Saturday?”</p><p>“We’re picking up your school items in Diagon Alley.”</p><p>“Again, <i>Mother</i>, haven’t technically gotten in yet.  No list, what books - ”</p><p>“Gaining early access to a first year’s supply list is simple, <i>dear</i>,” she snapped, “Professor Slughorn is an old friend of your father’s, he was happy to lend a hand. You will not jeopardize that connection, Sirius Orion.  Salazar help me if I get a letter from him about your tardiness... ” Walburga drained her remaining tea.</p><p>KRACK</p><p>Kreacher began to clear the breakfast dishes as Sirius sat uncomfortably in his chair.  He resented the expectation to suck up to a professor “friend-of-the-family” for special treatment he had neither earned nor asked for.</p><p>“Come on Regulus, time to go!” Walburga called as she stood and made her way towards the sitting room. “For heaven's sake, put on proper robes, Sirius.  I will not allow you out in public in common muggle attire.”</p><p>Sirius briefly wondered if your eyes could get stuck at the back of your head from rolling them too often.</p><p>Back in his room, he grabbed a black wizarding robe from his closet floor, flung it on, and unceremoniously closed it with a silver Black Family Crest pin. He hated that pin, not to mention, why would his mother trust an 11 year old with family heirloom jewelry? He couldn’t find his snitch one however, so “TOUJOURS PUR” had to do. </p><p>Regulus was fiddling with his matching crest pin at the bottom of the stairs.  Sirius helped him straighten it, muttering under his breath, “The most noble and ancient house my arse…”</p><p>“Do you really not think you’ll get your letter?” Regulus asked, clear grey eyes looking up, mirroring his brother’s matching pair.</p><p>“Gonna miss me, huh?” Sirius chuckled a moment before the real fear he had about leaving crept in - Reg would be alone in that house.  He heard the fire crackle in the sitting room, shook the thought from his mind, and hurried them in before his mother started shouting again.</p><p>“I bet you’ll get sorted into Slytherin,” Regulus whispered hopefully as he slipped his hand into his older brother’s.  Sirius held it tight; floo wasn’t Reg’s favorite way to travel.</p><p>“Blacks have been sorted into Slytherin since the founding of Hogwarts.  Your brother would never bring such disgrace upon our family by ending up in one of those riff raff houses.” Walburga stepped into the green flames and barked, “Gringotts!”</p><p>As the fire whisked her away, Sirius took a breath in the moment of reprieve. He looked down at his brother and smirked, “There’s still time. I alone could bring down the <i>Most</i> Noble and <i>Most</i> Ancient House of Black by getting sorted Hufflepuff.”</p>
