    <p>It seemed ironic that the wizarding world would hear of the new seer through a prophecy; a propechy only a few knew. It also seemed ironic that a girl fated to see all would be branded with the name Cecily: to see none.</p><p>Cecily had always hated her name. She hated how it sounded, hated how her mother used it when she was particularly angry, hated how it never seemed to quite fit. But it was a strong name, a good name—so she was told time and time again—, her mother’s loud voice hitting every syllable like it was poetry.</p><p>The children in the town, their Irish accents and their baby teeth, just couldn’t pronounce it, meaning she had so many nicknames it was hard to count. Her schoolmates called her Ceci, her friends (friend*), Sissy, the older folk, Celia—they thought that was her actual name—and her grandfather, well she liked his name for her best: Lily. It was much simpler, and ten times prettier than her own name. 
Her grandmother just called her Cecily, telling her over and over, that it was a beautiful name, and ,with a sparkle in her eye, assured her she’d understand someday. Her little gariníon (her little granddaughter)—the Gaelic language never seemed to leave her—was destined for great things. Cecily never really believed her.</p><p>The visions came when she was 4. She didn’t understand them, but it confused her mother how the young girl always seemed to know when her grandparents were coming, even when she didn’t know herself. Or how she could be found crying a day before someone’s death. Her mother found it odd; old Irish myths floated to her mind. But unlike the gullible old women, she was practical and didn’t believe in such nonsense.</p><p>And then came the magic. The flying objects, and the teleporting toys, and the constant confusion. Cecily’s mother believed, that for the first time in her life, she had been wrong about the Gaelic myths. She had heard all about the <i>asos sí</i>. The Fair Folk, who were appeased by offerings, but if angered would exchange your baby for a changeling. That’s what she thought she had: a changeling. Well, she believed that for a day. Then, upon further research she found her baby couldn’t possibly be a changeling, Cecily looked too much like her. Too much like her father.</p><p>Her father’s eyes. Eyes that constantly changed; on clear days in the little fishing village, they seemed almost blue, but on the days when storms would force people inside, her eyes would turn steely grey, making you think they had always been that way. When her mother had looked into her daughter’s eyes for the first time, she thought she had seen a ghost. That color and the same inquisitive look. Cecily’s hair was all her mother’s however. While her father’s Colombian heritage gave him dark black hair, her mother had brown hair. Nothing quite significant, and as Cecily grew, she wished for any other color. 	</p><p>There Cecily lived, with her mother and her grandparents, in the small town. The folk of Skibbereen lived simple lives. Everybody knew everyone and their mother, the population just a little over a six hundred. Not many secrets can be kept in a small town, and it seemed like there was always new gossip to share about Mrs. so and so’s problems with their husband. Though, I suppose, one secret remained hidden from the prying eyes of the little fishing village. No one knew a small witch lived in their midst. But this was for the best; the superstitious old women from the hovels of the town with their unwavering faith in the Lord their savior would have cast her out, in fear of the Devils’ presence in their quaint lives.</p><p>                                                       ___</p><p>As she aged, Cecily became closer to her grandmother, as the children thought her strange and unusual—something passed on to them by their parents. When she was younger, she had a couple of friends, but as her life became more magical, it became lonelier as well. So she stayed close to her grandmother. </p><p>Margaret Quinn, was a spirited 85-year-old women, who was always kind and understanding, but should you do anything to her granddaughter…well you best not. And she always seemed to know more than she let on about the abilities Cecily had. None of her other family members, however, could understand the impossible things she did. Once, a girl had pushed her into the mud, cackling loudly, only to be silenced when Cecily stood up perfectly clean. Another time, she had been playing by the pond near her house, during winter, and had fallen in. Her mother, hearing the splash, had run out into the yard, only to find her daughter in comfortably warm water, smiling happily. Peculiar things seemed to follow Cecily wherever she went, and no one more than Cecily herself wished for an explanation.</p><p>Her wish was granted on June 21st, her 11th birthday. Cecily woke up to the rain. She ran downstairs as the smell of breakfast filled the small house. Her mother handed her a poorly wrapped gift, which despite the odd taping, was clearly a book. She ripped it open, delighted to find a….diary. It was a diary. </p><p>“Mummmm!” she whined, “You got me a journal?” Looking at the diary with offense, “What am I supposed to do with this?!” </p><p>Her mother looked at her with amusement, “Write in it, of course”. </p><p>Cecily stomped off, huffing as she took her seat at the table, shoving food into her mouth. Two seconds later, she was screaming as an owl shot in through the open window, screeching loudly. Her mother grabbed the oatmeal-filled pot, swinging at the terrified creature, covering the house with oatmeal and feathers. Only when the owl had flown off in terror, did the two notice the letter it had left behind. </p><p>“Lily, did owls always carry letters?” Her mother asked.</p><p>Cecily shrugged, red-faced and out of breath. Her mother picked up the letter, carefully, tearing it open. She quickly scanned the letter, stopped, and read it again. Her eyes widened. </p><p>“What is it mum?” Cecily asked. </p><p>“You’re a witch” </p><p>“What?” Cecily asked affronted. </p><p>“You’re a witch” her mother repeated bluntly. </p><p>And saying nothing more, she handed her daughter the letter. Taking it cautiously in her hands, she studied the envelope, addressed in emerald green to Miss C. Quinn, The Kitchen, House-by-the-Sea, Skibbereen. She opened the letter, and began to read.</p><p> </p><p>HOGWARTS SCHOOL<br/>
of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDY<br/>
Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore<br/>
<i>(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)</i><br/>
Dear Miss Quinn,<br/>
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. </p><p>Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. I, Professor McGonagall, will be by shortly to explain this to you and your mother.<br/>
Yours sincerely,<br/>
Minerva McGonagall,<br/>
<i>Deputy Headmistress</i>	</p><p> </p><p>And she didn’t doubt it for second. Sure she was shocked, it’s not every day an owl savagely attacks her, and she finds out she’s a witch. She turned to her mother.</p><p>“I’m a witch” She affirmed.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how both her mother and she could act so calm, but she supposed that they’d been expecting this. She knew for a fact that most 5 year olds couldn’t turn their hair pink, just because they wanted to look like their My Little Pony. And so they sat down, their plates forgotten, and the oatmeal that had been flung around the room left to harden. Her mother tapped her foot.</p><p>“Stop”, insisted Cecily.</p><p>“How long is shortly?” her mother questioned.</p><p>“How would I know?” Ms. Quinn shrugged</p><p>There was a knock, and they both jumped. Her mother ran to the door, and flung it open, revealing a stern women with black hair and emerald green robes.</p><p>“Good afternoon Miss and Ms. Quinn. I am Professor McGonagall” she said with a thick Scottish accent. “I assume you got my letter?” </p><p>Cecily nodded slowly. Seeing her look of shock, the older woman’s expression softened.</p><p>“Why don’t we sit, I’ll explain” She stopped shortly, looking at the carnage left behind by the owl. “Oh my!”</p><p>“The owl” answered Ms. Quinn.</p><p>“Oh” nodded McGonagall, “Well why don’t I clean this up” </p><p>And with that, she pulled out a long brown stick, waved it, “Scourgify”</p><p>The oatmeal vanished, and any doubts that Cecily may have had along with it. Professor McGonagall led them to their sofa and handed them each a cup of tea. Cecily wondered where she had gotten the tea. Probably magic.</p><p>“As you have been told, you are a witch. Hogwarts is a school where young witches and wizards learn to control their gifts. There you will be taught the magical arts: Transfiguration—my own class—Charms, Potions, Astronomy, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, as well as flying lessons” Professor McGonagall stopped, when she noticed the Quinns’s confusion. </p><p>“Questions?”</p><p>“I take all those classes?”</p><p>“Well, in your first year, yes, those are your seven core subjects. You can choose to take different classes throughout your seven years at Hogwarts, and flying is only mandatory your first year” McGonagall explained, then waited for the young girl to say something else, when Cecily didn’t, she continued.</p><p>“Hogwarts has four houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. These houses will be like your family during your time at Hogwarts; you will sleep in the same dorm rooms and eat at the same tables.”</p><p>Her mother had been quiet, for quite some time, but finally seemed to have regained her voice, “It’s a boarding school?”</p><p>“Yes”</p><p>“Oh”, her mother seemed put off by this response.</p><p>“But, your daughter will be able to send you letters via owl,” Ms. Quinn cringed, “and can return for Christmas if she wishes”</p><p>“And where is this school” Ms. Quinn sensed her daughter’s excitement and desire to ask more about the “fun” stuff, but she had her own questions first</p><p>“Scotland, but you will not find it on a map. It is hidden from the eyes of muggles”</p><p>“Muggles?” questioned Cecily.</p><p>“Non-Magical folk. You, I presume, are a muggle-born. Someone who has non-magical parents, however you will usually find a squib or two somewhere down the line. Then there are half-bloods: those with one wizarding and one muggle or muggle-born parent. Lastly, pure-bloods: witches and wizards who come from a long line of magical folk” Finally Professor McGonagall stopped.</p><p>Muggles, squibs, pure-bloods?! Too many words that she didn’t understand. Once again that soft smile returned to Professor McGonagall’s face.</p><p>“Don’t worry, everything will make sense at Hogwarts. Last order of business, you will need to get your school supplies. You will find all of it in Diagon Alley. As it is in London, I will set up a Floo Network here, so that you can easily travel there. Your list of supplies is in the letter you received”</p><p>She pointed her wand at the fireplace, muttered a few words, and then turned and handed them a jar of green dust, “Throw this in the flames, clearly say Diagon Alley, and step in. You can exchange your money for the proper currency at Gringots, the wizarding bank, I assume your answer is yes?”</p><p>“To what?” inquired Ms. Quinn.</p><p>“To Hogwarts of course!”</p><p>“YES!” shouted Cecily.</p><p>McGonagall smiled, and without another word, exited the small house, leaving the Quinns to wonder if it was real.</p>
