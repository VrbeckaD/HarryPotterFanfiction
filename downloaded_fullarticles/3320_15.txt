    <p>"Black, Arabella"</p>
<p>The Great Hall fell silent with anticipation as the House Black heir sat on the stool, closing her eyes as the hat was placed on top her head.</p>
<p><em>Ah, the final Black has come to Hogwarts.</em> The Hat muttered to Arabella. <em>I've been looking forwards to this. </em></p>
<p>The girl bit her lip nervously, uncomfortable that the talking hat held her entire future in its metaphorical hand.</p>
<p><em>Yes, yes you're much like your parents; you inherited all the nerve and passion of a Gryffindor, and I can sense arrogance deep-seated within. But there's a thirst for knowledge, too, one not quite easily sated. </em>The talking hat paused, murmuring to itself before continuing. <em>But you won't fulfill your potential in Ravenclaw, despite your protests otherwise. You want to learn but have no desire to dedicate yourself to it. But it's not out of laziness, you're a very hard working girl. And you're longing to prove yourself to your family, despite not approving of them, shows me great loyalty. </em></p>
<p>Arabella pinched her eyes closed, sensing where this was going.</p>
<p>
  <em>It seems that you're most outspoken about your beliefs of equality. You have a strong disbelief of stereotypes, and you crave a place of belonging where no one will judge you. Hufflepuff is where you strive.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>No.</em>
</p>
<p><em>No? </em>The hat mimicked.<em> You demand me to place you elsewhere? I see. You are Sirius Black's daughter, after all. </em>The hat huffed, startling the first years below.</p>
<p>
  <em>I don't want to strive in Hufflepuff. If you refuse to make me a Ravenclaw then you must put me in Slytherin; I won't go elsewhere.</em>
</p>
<p>Slytherin, hm? The Hat growled inquisitively. <em>I must say, you're just like them; clever, proud, m</em><em>anipulative in the way only a Black could be.</em> It chuckled again, a deeper, much darker sound this time. <em>You share something with dear cousin Bellatrix it seems, Ms. Black. That fiery temper isn't just a coincidence, and neither is the hatred in your heart. But it goes much deeper than that.  </em></p>
<p>It felt like an eternity had passed. <em>You've made my choice harder, girl.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>It shouldn't be. I've made up my mind.</em>
</p>
<p>"So it seems" The Sorting Hat finally spoke, breaking the tense silence, "Arabella Black, so it shall be..." </p>
