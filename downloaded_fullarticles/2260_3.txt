    <p>Finally Harry is able to get away from the Dursley's. He never liked it there and now he has a house with his godfather to share and he can leave the Dursley's for good. After the war had ended and Harry defeated Voldermort he was still considered scum to his "family." Harry had to endorse a long and painful journey to keep everyone safe, and it was all worth it if it means that he doesn't have live with them anymore. </p><p>Harry was on the Hogwarts Express with Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny. Fred and George had came back with them on the train after the battle because they wanted to stay together for a while. Arthur and Molly had stayed a little afterwards to help the Order, they promised they would meet the children at the station when they arrived. The train was a lot quieter on this train ride than it was on any other ones they had taken together. The compartments that usually were loud with cheers and laughter from the children was gone. They were fresh from the war and wanted to go <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/17712443#" rel="nofollow">home</a> to their families. You can cut through the air with how thick the atmosphere was full of remorse. Every second you sat there it felt like a new person was dying. There were a lot of students that had died. In a way this was a moment of silence for every one of those students. </p><p>The Weasley family, Hermione, and Harry had barely talked throughout the train ride. Harry knew that they were all in their own heads, and were just letting themselves recover a little at what had just happened. Harry had defeated Lord Voldermort. The idea was absurd to him, that now he wouldn't have to constantly worry on whether his choices and decisions were going to lead him to the one guy who wanted him dead as soon as he was born. Everyone, only occasionally asked how the others were feeling. Nobody really had the energy to talk. They haven't taken the time to clean themselves up either, so they were still covered in dirt and blood.</p><p>Hermione and Ron were sitting next to each other closest to the door on the right side. Hermione’s head was resting on Ron’s right shoulder as they played with each other’s hands, comparing the sizes and things like that. Fred and George were next to the window, diagonally from Ron and Hermione, both sleeping against each other. Even though it seemed crazy that they could sleep at all. Harry had guessed that they were exhausted and were just relaxed that they hadn't lost the other. Harry was next to the window across from the twins, looking out the window and trying not to focus on the fact that all those students who died was because of him. Ginny was at across Ron and Hermione, away from Harry, and was looking through the Quibbler that Luna had given to her. Before they boarded the train, Ginny and Harry had talked a bit about their dating situation. They both agreed that this wasn’t the time for either of them to actually become a couple yet. Ginny seemed a little reluctant when talking to Harry about this, but when Harry had expressed that he didn’t feel that he should date at the moment she had relaxed and agreed quickly. They just seemed better as friends and he had told her so, they agreed to stay friends and hang out sometimes. She explained to Harry that she promised herself and Luna that she would spend more time with her over the summer, because they had grown quite close over the years. Harry understood and walked onto the train with the rest of them. When they were about an hour away from the station, there started to be movement of students gathering their things. </p><p>"You guys will visit yeah?" Ron asked Harry and Hermione.</p><p>"Of course we will Ron." Hermione answered for both Harry and herself, while she squeezed his hand in a reassuring way. They seemed a little lighter at that. </p><p>"So, Harry your gonna live with Sirius now are you?" Ron said as he woke Fred and George up, so they can began to gather their things. Subsequently, they were squishing themselves. </p><p>"Yeah, he's supposed to meet me at the platform. I suppose he's waiting with your mum and dad now." Harry let a small smile play on his lips at the thought that he would finally be able to have a proper family. For the rest of the remaining time on the train students were beginning to become anxious to see their families again, leaving the atmosphere changing from dread to anticipation. </p><p>When they made it to the platform every student had basically ran off of the train  and onto the platform to find their families. The Weasley's, the Granger's and Sirius were all standing together when the group had stepped off of the train. But, there was someone, who was unexpected, there. Remus was standing with Sirius looking around at all the students, looking for Harry, at the Station.</p><p>Harry and Remus made eye contact, both of them ran to each other clutching tightly to one another. Even though Sirius was his godfather, Harry had felt closer to Remus throughout the years. Sirius was right behind Remus and had given the two of them a hug as well. Ron, Ginny, Fred, and George had all ran to Molly and Arthur as Hermione ran to her parents. Their group was silent except for the sobs that came from the children and parents as they held their family. Harry didn’t care that he was sobbing loudly into Sirius and Remus, because now he could properly live with the people who had loved him unconditionally. Hermione was silently crying in the arms of her parents, who had all fallen to the ground holding each other. The Weasley’s were all crying and holding each other tightly like if they would let go one would leave forever. Throughout the group you could hear everyone saying their ‘I love yous' to one another. It was a long time before Molly had let go of her children and spoke. </p><p>"Hermione, Harry come here and let me give you all a hug." She spoke through the tears that were falling down her face. Harry and Hermione had walked to her tears still streaming down their faces. "You all risked your lives this year to save everyone, <em>and</em>  you better keep it to just this year. I will not <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/17712443#" rel="nofollow"> bear </a> to lose any of you." She had a look on her face that told them she wasn't kidding. She let go of the children and grabbed Remus, the Granger's and Sirius into a big hug. "You protect these children, all four of you because they are precious children and don't need to bother with <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/17712443#" rel="nofollow"> saving </a> the world anymore." Molly was now sobbing and grabbed all her children into a hug again. She was looking at all of her children and individually saying I love you to each of them when she just suddenly stopped and looked around at all of them again. "Wait, hold on someone's missing." Molly looked around at all her children and counted all their heads and names off in her head. </p><p>"Excuse me, where's Draco?" Molly asked hoping that he had gone to find his godfather. Ron seemed a little annoyed in fact. </p><p>.....</p><p>In Harry’s third year Draco had went to Remus and asked him if he can help defeat the Dark Lord in any way that he can. At first, the Order was a little skeptical. It took a while for any of them to actually trust him. They had questioned why he wanted to help them in the first place, suspecting that he was going to be a double agent. But, that was quickly forgotten when Draco had explained that Voldermort was threatening his family and he needed a way out. Over some time, and arguments over Draco, they trusted him enough for him to help fight in the war. During the summers he would secretly go to Grimmauld Place and help give as much  information as possible on what his father had heard from the other Death Eaters. Draco had played the part that he had wanted to become a Death Eater himself and convinced his father to tell him the details so that he was ready one day.</p><p>It was during the visits, when Draco would have the most valuable information that all of the Weasley's happened to be over. Ron and Draco were constantly fighting when he was there. Ron and Draco seemed to not have put away their differences. Draco apologized to all of them, mostly Hermione and Ron. He apologized to Harry as well and they seemed to get along quite well, they didn’t argue as much but they did constantly bicker and call each other names in the spirit of keeping one thing familiar. But, Ron didn't want to accept the fact that he would have to be civil to Draco. Nor, did he want to accept that Draco was now one of the good guys, after what he had said about Hermione and his family. So they had fought it out. No one broke up the fight until both boys had it out of their system. When they were done they had laughed a little and were no longer prats to each other. </p><p>.....</p><p>"I don't know mum. Its not like were dating or anything." Ron had grinned at his own little joke. Which was definitely not the right answer to give because Molly had hit Ron over the head with her hand. </p><p>"You didn't see how he was affected by all of this?” She vaguely gestured around the room. “He betrayed his father to help us and you didn't check on him?! Let's go." Molly seemed a little upset and had pulled everyone she could to follow her. No one was going to go against her, they also wanted to stay together. They all followed Molly through the crowds of crying families who had found their children and were hugging them. They went through almost the whole station before they saw a familiar blonde head. But, he wasn't alone like they all expected, there hugging him was Severus Snape. </p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>When Draco had gotten off of the train he wasn’t expecting anyone to be there for him. He just thought he might find a little help to get to a Floo. But, deep down he was hoping to see at least Molly. She had taken care of him, and seemed to care about him the most. He was a little disappointed when he didn’t see the familiar face, but he did see another one. Standing there looking around, who seemed to be on guard, was Severus Snape. Draco cautiously walked towards him. “Severus? What are you doing here?” Draco questioned Snape as he turned to look at Draco.</p><p>Before Draco could do anything Snape was holding Draco in a hug. “I am your godfather, of course I wouldn’t let you come home without seeing you off of the train. I know I may have seemed like a prick way back when, but truly Draco you are my only family. I swear that I will protect you with my life from now on.” Snape was holding Draco tightly and Draco was still in shock at the words that were coming out of the man who seemed to only know hatred. He was slowly wrapping his arms around him, when he felt Snape tense and quickly pushed Draco behind him. Draco understood quickly and he had his hand on his wand in an instant, he was prepared for what might come after he had fought on the opposite side of the war. He knew that Death Eaters, well the ones remaining, would come after him, so he was ready to protect himself against anything that might hurt him. He was surprised though when Snape had relaxed.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Snape was still murmuring promises to keep Draco safe when he caught sight of several people coming towards him. In instinct he pushed Draco behind him. Draco seemed to sense Snape’s distress and had tensed and put his hand on his wand ready to defend himself. Even though the war was over and most of the Death Eaters were caught, there were still a few out there and were bound to come looking to avenge the Dark Lords life. How better to show their loyalty than to kill the mole that had taken place in their group and had betrayed the Dark Lord. Snape had  his hand on his wand ready to protect his godson from anything that might come for him. But, he relaxed once he saw the familiar red heads walking towards him. He let his hand relax away from his wand, as did Draco, and greeted the new comers.</p><p>"Hello, Molly, Arthur, Mr. and Mrs Granger I assume. Remus." Snape noticed Sirius standing closely to Remus but didn't say a hello to him but he acknowledged him with a nod in his direction.</p><p>"Hello Severus, is Draco here?" Molly asked Snape with a worried look on her face. Snape knew of the bond that Molly had with Draco. The one that had protected him from danger when the war had begun. He felt grateful that she was there to protect him when he couldn’t. So he had trusted her enough to let his guard down, when it involved Draco, slightly around her. </p><p>"He is." Snape stepped to the side to reveal Draco, who was slightly blushing at the sound Molly had made when she saw him. Molly went straight to him and hugged him.</p><p>"Draco! Are you okay? How are you feeling?" Molly pulled back just a little so that she could get a better look at him. </p><p>"I'm fine." Draco said trying to sound nonchalant, but he ultimately failed when a crack that betrayed his voice. </p><p>"Severus would you and Draco like to come to the Burrow with us?" Draco looked at Snape with a hopeful look on his face. He had always wanted to be in the presence of Molly, she was like a mother to Draco and he would take any offer he could get to be with her. Snape looked at his face and nodded to Molly. "Fantastic! Now come along. Mr. and Mrs. Granger would you also like to come?" They took one look at Hermione. They knew she wouldn’t want to part from her friends or her parents, they didn’t want to make her choose between them so they looked back at Molly and nodded, distracted, while trying to wipe the tears that were steadily streaming down their faces while holding onto Hermione. Molly began to lead the way to where they had a portkey waiting for them. Snape, Draco, and Remus all seemed to end up at the back. Sirius was walking with Harry an arm around his shoulders and talking to him lowly. Hermione and her parents were also talking, while the rest of the Weasley’s were quietly following Molly.</p><p>"Remus, how are you?" Snape looked once over at Remus and waited for him to answer.</p><p>"I'm fine, nothing wrong physically, or at least not right now.” He smirked a little at that. “What about you? How's your arm." Remus lightly grabbed Snape's arm and slightly pulled up his sleeve only to reveal the tip of the fading Dark Mark. He ran his thumb over it and Snape took in a sharp breath. "Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn’t think that if I touched it, it would hurt." Remus covered the Mark again with Snape’s sleeve and let go of his arm. "But, really how is your arm?"</p><p>"It's a little sore. Every hour that comes it gets really bad and it hurts so much that I can't stand." Snape tells Remus in a hushed voice. Remus is the only one that Snape would be open about his feelings to. Even though a few years ago that wouldn’t have been the case. Remus nods and continues to look at his arm with this concerned look on his face. </p><p>"Well, we can talk about other things to get your mind off of it for now, yeah?" Remus smiled at Snape and the corner of Snape's mouth twisted upward.</p><p>"Let's not talk about me. What happened with you? Since apparently your not a good liar." Snape ran his fingers over the bandaged cut on Remus' arm. Remus looked down at his arm and shrugged.</p><p>"I fell into the corner of my desk when I was leaving." Snape gave him a look that always seems to say, 'Idiot, why didn't you watch where you were going.' Remus laughed at his expression and continued walking.</p><p>They finally were at the spot where the portkey was waiting. It was a little soda can in a corner. "Mr. and Mrs. Granger, this is going to feel strange. But, I inform you now not to let go no matter what. Or until we say so. Its going to be a little bumpy when we land, just warning you now." Molly had told Hermione's parents. "We don't leave for another five minutes so be ready." Everyone seemed to drift into a light conversation while holding onto each other still. They had their trunks, shrunken and delivered to the Burrow by owls. Remus had left Snape’s side and joined Sirius and Harry, while Snape clung to Draco. After the few minutes it was finally time to leave.</p>
