    <p>If pirates were to be the bloody, savage end of Harry Potter, he wished they’d get on with it.</p><p>The windswept deck was damp beneath his bare feet, prompting thoughts of the dewy grass of home. What he wouldn’t give for the freedom to run across the fields of Hogwarts, wind rushing in his ears over the steady thump of his heart, the world falling away in his wake.</p><p>Instead he was confined by an endless, restless sea taunting him with its wildness. He’d heard countless tales of villainous pirates and their dastardly deeds. People spoke as if the ocean teemed with them, but the voyage had been mile after mile of…<em>nothing.</em></p><p>Harry shook his head at his foolishness. Not that he actually wanted pirates to attack their ship and massacre them. If only he could <em>move,</em> he would keep boredom at bay.</p><p>He gripped the railing, longing for dirt beneath his nails, scratches on his palms from tree bark as he climbed and explored, wonderfully aching muscles from hours in the lake. If he could only run a simple mile. Hardly any distance at all, but trapped on the ship, that much clear land would be a marvel.</p><p>He wiped sea spray from his eyes. If only the ability to run and jump and swim was worth anything at all in his world instead of being childish folly he was supposed to have outgrown. Men did not climb trees or swim for hours, and certainly they didn’t run for the sheer pleasure of it the way he had at Hogwarts.</p><p>Of course, the estate wasn’t there anymore, sold off to pay debts, so even if he made his way back one day, he would never return to those rolling hills. Its verdant trees and round, tranquil lake would now be home to someone else.</p><p>No, for the foreseeable future, home would be a new colony, his mentor, Albus Dumbledore desperately wanted to see flourish. Albus Dumbledore had found his fortunes in England not the least bit fortunate, and as a governor in the New World had the thing he loved most dearly: power.</p><p>Harry’s future bride waited there. Ginny Weasley stood to inherit quite a fortune, and for the colony…and Albus…to thrive, alliances had to be made. So, Harry would do the only useful thing he could and marry.</p><p>He brushed a fresh spray of briny seawater from his face as he stared out at the endless night, keeping a firm hold on the rail. His untucked shirt flapped in the breeze, the lower fastenings on his breeches unbuckled under his knees.</p><p>In the dark, there was no one to comment on his state of undress, and he supposed the crew didn’t care anyway. His raven black hair curled at the ends in the dampness, and he tucked a lock behind his ear. It had been his little act of rebellion to keep it longer than most gentlemen. He certainly wouldn’t be wearing dreaded wigs, either, if he could help it.</p><p>Clouds conspired to hide the stars and razor-thin crescent of moon. He shivered in the late September night’s chill; he really should have worn his hated shoes and jacket.</p><p>At least the wind was no longer the bitter cold of the mid-Atlantic as they neared the West Indies. He shifted back and forth on his feet, lifting them like a racehorse stamping at the starting line.</p><p>The <em>Phoenix</em> was fairly large, a merchant ship carrying a cargo of salt fish and forged metal tools to the colonies. But when he’d attempted even a light trot around the main deck, the crew had reacted with consternation at best, hostility at worst. Running was his very favorite activity and the thing he excelled at most in life, much to his mentor’s disgust. Swimming in the lake in summertime, cutting through the placid water with sure, even strokes, was a joy as well.</p><p>To be surrounded now by endless water but unable to dive in and soothe his cramped muscles was the worst torture. He’d asked the captain if he could at least climb the mast or sail rigging and had been flatly refused.</p><p>So, he stood by the starboard rail and sometimes paced, careful to stay out of the crew’s way. At least he had been told their progress was swift, and that after a month’s voyage…thirty-one days and some thirteen hours since they left England, to be exact, they would reach the island in a fortnight if the wind held.</p><p>He was informed that some ships took several months to reach the colonies. Ships could leave London the same day and arrive weeks or more apart.</p><p>Staring out at the nothingness, he stopped his restless shifting and squinted. The weak sliver of moon had valiantly escaped the clouds for a moment, and Harry thought he spotted a strange kind of movement. The night took on shape before becoming uniform once more.</p><p>Perhaps it had been a great ocean creature surfacing, a whale or giant squid, or some kind of mysterious monster.</p><p>He chuckled. Earlier that evening, Luna had read aloud fables from one of the old leather-bound tomes they’d brought from Hogwarts, and his imagination was clearly running wild. She’d always been far too imaginative and indulgent, and he knew she’d packed books he’d favour, although she certainly had a taste for adventurous tales rather than the sentimental stories ladies were supposed to read. They’d both enjoyed the diary of a naval captain who’d served on several ships of the line and described life aboard in vivid detail.</p><p>Although the cabin Harry and Luna shared was tiny, at least they had privacy. He really should re-join her in their cabin to sleep and end another interminable day, but the walls closed in on him, and it felt like a prison.</p><p>For the hundredth time, he wondered what his life on the new colony would be like. The colony was only a few years old, and there had been whispers of struggles with agriculture and trade, rumours of corruption and settlers packing up already.</p><p>He’d be forced to work and acquire some respectable job procured for him, like Luna’s husband, Neville. Neville was thirty and penniless, but of good breeding and an agreeable disposition. He and Luna had insisted on each other.</p><p>Neville seemed happy enough to do Albus’s bidding, including leaving early for the new colony some months ago, not knowing at the time that Luna was with child. When Albus Dumbledore made a demand, it was met.</p><p>Luna and Neville had hated to be parted, but she was needed to oversee the packing up of the estate and auction of the more valuable items. Certainly, it couldn’t have been left to Harry, who wouldn’t have known where to begin given he’d spent as much time outside away from the ornate house as he could.</p><p>Harry had considered refusing when he and Luna were summoned. But what would he do? Where would he live? His marriage to Ginny had been agreed upon and should he fail in his duty, Albus would disown him. He’d have nothing, not even a roof over his head.</p><p>Bile rose in his throat. No, that wouldn’t do. So onward to the new colony he went, to marry as his mentor saw fit. All he knew of Ginny Weasley was that she’d lived with her wealthy family for some years in Jamaica before her father joined forces with Albus to establish a shipping company.</p><p>Well, he also knew her writing was unfailingly neat, and from Luna’s recounting of the letter, that Ginny enjoyed needlework and greatly looked forward to sharing her life with him.</p><p>He’d received her letter just before leaving England and had burned it in the grate in his room. At least the voyage was a worthy excuse for not responding. And as much as he’d wished to stay in England, he couldn’t allow Luna to sail the perilous Atlantic alone.</p><p>Although with how smooth their journey had been, completely lacking in beasts of the deep or even a gale of note, he apparently hadn’t needed to fret. Still, it was done.</p><p>He’d accepted years ago that he was feeble-minded, and although he knew he should be grateful for the opportunity to hold a position of at least some stature on the new colony, he dreaded the notion of truly being under Albus’s thumb once more.</p><p>It had been blissful having Albus overseas for years. He supposed he should feel remorse for such churlish thoughts, but there was so much else to consume his stores of guilt. So much else indeed.</p><p>He turned away from the rail, resigning himself to another long night in the swaying hammock. Luna was of course sleeping in the cot. The cry from above pierced the night, and Harry jumped a mile.</p><p>“Sails!”</p><p>In the flurry of activity and shouts, he pressed himself to the ship’s side as the crew emerged from the hull like ants. Harry squinted into the darkness, turning to and fro and seeing nothing.</p><p>Then he spotted it…the hulk of a ship emerging from the night, not a single light flickering upon it, drawn to The <em>Phoenix</em> like a moth to flame. With a sickening twist of his stomach, he realized he had indeed spotted a monster, and it was upon them.</p>
