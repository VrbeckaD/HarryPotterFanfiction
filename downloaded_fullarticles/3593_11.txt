    <hr dir="ltr"/><p align="center"> <strong>Early August, 1992</strong></p><hr/><p>'You've thought about it then?'</p><p>James took a moment to curse as he absent-mindedly shut his fingers in the kitchen drawer, both distracted by Harry talking and his own clumsiness. The space between the wood and marble neatly split the skin just above the nail of his index and he let out a hiss of pain, pulling it out again to suck away the tiny bead of blood that appeared. </p><p>'Sorry,' his son mumbled apologetically, though the cut was minor, 'but I think that proves my point, don't you?'</p><p>A wince came from James as he sucked the wound clean, 'what point was that?'</p><p>'That you were thinking of asking Professor Burbage out.'</p><p>Had James not already jammed his fingers in the kitchenware, he most certainly would have done at this declaration, 'whatever gave you <em>that</em> idea?'</p><p>'You mentioned her name when you came home the other day,' Harry propped his elbows up onto the kitchen counter, his face like a little dog waiting for tidbits, 'she works at the school doesn't she? Hermione says she teaches Muggle Studies. You could always-'</p><p>'While I appreciate your dedication to matchmaking, Harry, I have no interest in Charity Burbage or any of the other charming teachers in your school. Yes, she was able to show me a few fascinating texts on Muggle History but honestly, I find her as about attractive as a glammed-up Banshee.'</p><p>'<em>Dad</em>,' Harry reprimanded, though this was followed by a humorous snort, 'you're such an ass!'</p><p>'Language, young man. And of course I'm an ass, I'm a Potter!' James accounted as he continued raking about in the cutlery tray until he located the appropriate utensil for opening a can of tuna, 'it's in our blood to make asses of ourselves. You're wasting your time trying to find me a date anyway. What woman in her right mind would want to go out with a shrivelled old man like me?'</p><p>'Dad, you're thirty-three!'</p><p>'And not a day older I hope.' James sassed as he battled with the damned lid, trying to pull it off unsuccessfully with a can opener, 'when you get to my age, you realise how lucky you were back in school. The freedom, the irresponsibility, being able to eat all you want without worrying about excessive weight gain-'</p><p>'Not to mention all the early mornings, and the exams, and no one listening to what you have to say until you're eighteen,' Harry finished, swiping an orange from the bowl in the centre of the counter, 'being a kid isn't all fun and games either, Dad.'</p><p>'All I'm saying is, savour your youth while you can - before you know it, you'll be old and grey with a son who is determined to find you a wife before you crumble into a pile of dust.' James surrendered to the tuna can, realising he was going to lose skin if he kept persisting. With a brief glance from left to right, he quietly withdrew his wand and summoned it off wordlessly, making Harry gawp.</p><p>'Dad! You can't do that!'</p><p>'I doubt the Ministry is going to be on my tail about dislodging a tin of fish,' James replied, finally able to scrape the stuff out, 'besides, no one else saw it. You worry too much Harry. They say a lot of that stuff just to scare the students you know.'</p><p>Realising they were getting off topic, Harry began peeling the fruit in his hands, 'so when <em>are</em> you going to start...you know...looking for someone again? It's been years, Dad.'</p><p>He knew his father was still on the fence about long-term relationships, even after all this time. But James needed someone. Harry was observant, and he knew the man needed <em>someone</em> in his life other than his son, someone to hold and kiss and... do other things. It would be difficult for the both of them - James for moving on and Harry for being able to accept the possibility of a stepmother in Lily's place - but as far as the boy was concerned, it would be well worth the sacrifice.</p><p>'Wasn't planning on starting any time soon,' James finally replied, though the volume of his voice had dropped dramatically since his last speech, 'things are pleasant enough how they are. Plus, you're going back to school in three weeks-'</p><p>'But you're not happy.'</p><p>The hands holding the tuna can went still, and James felt a sigh mount at the back of his throat. Harry dropped the orange onto the counter, wishing he hadn't said anything. The whole kitchen went silent, save for the faint noise coming from the TV in the next room.</p><p>'Of course I'm happy,' said James, finally, with a calm and heavy breath, 'I know there are plenty of things to be miserable about, and we've had our problems in the past, but that doesn't mean I don't-'</p><p>'You think I don't notice,' Harry interrupted, as he felt a heat rise in his face and pool into both cheeks, 'you think I don't notice when you talk to yourself, or you talk to Mum's picture. I hear you crying at night Dad - either by yourself or to Uncle Sirius. I know that you're lonely. I know you miss her, and that you blame yourself.'</p><p>James felt his chest go tight. It wasn't as if Lily was an unspoken topic in the household; quite the contrary, they discussed her a lot. It was James's guilt that was the real burden. The guilt of being alive, of existing, of breathing when she wasn't there, when it was <em>all his fault</em>.</p><p>He never appreciated her when she was alive. He never appreciated the sacrifices she made to be with him, how she gave up her life to be a wife and mother when she was still only a child herself. It was only in the last few months before she was killed, when their marriage was on the rocks and the only thing holding it together was the baby they had made and loved so dearly, that James Potter realised how truly remarkable (and patient) Lily Evans was. And then she died, before he could tell her how sorry he was.</p><p>Sirius and Remus were always telling him to stop feeling guilty simply for being alive. Harry had a father, family to protect him; God knows what would have become of him had he lost<em> both</em> of his parents. Lily was dead. It had happened and there was nothing he or anyone else could do to change that. He had to stop living in the past. Finding somebody else to share his life with was all part of moving on.</p><p>James abandoned the tuna can and carefully took Harry's face in his hands, staring into those wonderful green orbs identical to Lily's own. It was as if Harry was the last living replica he had of his late wife - save for the seemingly artificial portraits that were hung up about the house, and the few enchanted photographs Harry possessed that simply occurred in a continuous loop.</p><p>'Hey...' he murmured as softly as he could, thumbs extending into a gentle stroke to soothe the boy, 'it's my job to worry about <em>you</em>, okay? You're always going to be the most important person in my life, Harry. We don't need anyone else meddling in with that, do we?'</p><p>Harry lowered his eyes, but he didn't want to press on the subject. He knew the situation was probably more distressing for James than himself. He never knew Lily. He never knew of her brilliance apart from what he had been told. He only knew her as a photograph, or a portrait, or a faded wish only accessible through an enchanted mirror. His bottom lip curled inwards, 'I suppose not...'</p><p>A hand reached up to ruffle the twelve-year-old's mess of dark hair, 'good lad. Now go and bother your Godfather for a bit while I figure out how to get this damn oven working.'</p><p>Harry cocked a brow, 'Uncle Sirius still trusts you around ovens?'</p><p>'Give over Harry, I'm not <em>that</em> bad,' James retorted with mock offence, sweeping over to the ageing contraption and giving its knobs a tweak, 'it's very simple once you-'</p><p>He was swiftly cut off as he tweaked one of the knobs a little too vigorously and it went flying off the utensil altogether, bouncing off each wall before slamming solidly against the kitchen door; whereupon Sirius's voice shortly followed in an annoyed huff from the next room, 'Prongs!'</p><p>'You see? It's brilliant,' James leaned on the oven thoughtfully, 'you can cook your meals <em>and</em> annoy Sirius all at once.'</p><hr/><p>On the same day, around the same time, Abraxas Malfoy knocked on the door of Malfoy Manor and was immediately greeted by his son, who promptly vomited all over the welcome mat as soon as he opened his mouth.</p><p>It was rare for Abraxas to visit the manor more than once a year; most of the time he was either too ill or too disgusted to show his face. But when he received a letter from his only child announcing the tragic demise of his daughter-in-law, he claimed "traditional values" were what dragged him there. </p><p>Draco heard Lucius retching from upstairs and came hurrying from his bedroom with the draught their physician had prescribed to prevent the bile from becoming blood; in a matter of seconds he had tipped his father's head back, poured a few drops down his throat and the gagging ceased. Abraxas, though somewhat disturbed and perhaps sympathetic, kept to the side and said nothing. </p><p>Draco wasn't stupid. He knew that his estranged grandfather was positively furious at Lucius for the state he had gotten himself into (and worried, to some extent, though he only ever seemed to show anger). Lucius's drinking was a wall between himself and the hell outside; so long as he was intoxicated, the meaningless perils of reality were non-existent, and he could forget about Narcissa and how much he missed her, until he woke up the next morning with a roaring headache.</p><p>He was a frightening drunk. Never violent; he had never raised a hand to Draco in his life. But a completely different man nonetheless. He wouldn't speak, he cried for little to no reason at all and spent the rest of the night throwing up his guts until he passed out on the bathroom floor. He seemed to find solace in destroying himself. </p><p>Abraxas's visit lasted just under a week. Draco remained by his father's side the entire time, terrified that Abraxas would attack out of nowhere if he took his eye off him for more than a second; while he was around, the old man merely stuck to the shadows, snapping about how Lucius's poor mother would be turning in her grave whenever he so much as glanced at a firewhiskey bottle.</p><p>In return, Lucius was as responsive as a ghost; spiritless, inactive, clutching Draco's little white hand as if it was a lifeline. It was only when Abraxas retired to the spare room every evening that Lucius would draw breath and Draco, whether the man was drunk or not, would help him into bed, blowing out the candle and pressing a kiss into layers of blond hair. </p><p>On the fifth night of his grandfather's stay, Draco found himself sitting at the top of the staircase with Dobby hidden underneath his robes, trying (and failing) to ignore all the curses that were coming out of Abraxas's vile mouth in the dining room below, each one more violent and brutal than the first.</p><p>An incident at dinner was the cause of this "intervention." In other words, Lucius, who had actually been sober the entire day, had poured himself a reasonably sized glass of wine and Abraxas well and truly lost it. Draco had been ordered to bed but he hung about the staircase anxiously, wishing he could see through walls. </p><p>'Such filthy words!' Dobby shrieked, voice muffled beneath the fabric of Draco's night robes, 'Dobby can't stand to hear such words! A horrible, vile man is Mr Abraxas Malfoy!' Draco hummed impatiently as the elf immediately regretted this statement and took to bonking his own head against one of the cold steps, 'bad Dobby, <em>bad</em> Dobby!'</p><p>'Shh, I can't hear!' the boy hissed to silence the creature and he quickly hastened down the staircase as soon as he heard the door to the dining room slam abruptly. He pressed his ear to the marble, trying to hear the voices inside but it was muffled, incoherent and simply words slurred by his grandfather's temper. </p><p>Perhaps it was a good thing he couldn't hear. The sound of a hand meeting flesh would have surely been enough to release the scream mounting up inside him; a scream that had been building up, ready to explode ever since his mother's demise. </p><p>Finally, he heard Lucius yell and a dull thud followed short that made Draco shake all over. He pushed the door open, casually ignoring Dobby who tugged at his robe and implored him not to enter, and slowly drank in the image of his father pressed up against the wall with one of Abraxas's quivering hands clamped around his throat.</p><p>'You are the most selfish, incompetent-' Abraxas began, before cutting off and pushing Lucius further back, until he was almost gasping for breath, 'no wonder this family is going to pieces. You think I <em>enjoy</em> treating you like a child? I certainly don't! But I do it for the good of the Malfoy lineage and if coddling prevents you from destroying everything your ancestors worked hard for, then I'll do it until the day I die!'</p><p><em>Coddling</em>. Draco tried to shout but the only sound he could make was a small, undignified squeak. Abraxas heard, however, and immediately dropped his arm down to his side, as if he had just been caught doing something as trivial as picking his nose. Heat blazed into Draco's usually porcelain face and his eyes filled with tears. </p><p>'Don't hurt my father,' he managed to babble out, but he was too scared to run over, because Abraxas would only blame Lucius and injure him further. He stayed at the door with Dobby clinging to his ankle and his lips pressed in a thin line to keep himself from sobbing aloud.</p><p>Abraxas looked right into his eyes, as if desperate to find some way to control his grandson the same way he had controlled the rest of his family for decades. It didn't work. Draco loved his grandfather but refused to be broken.</p><p>'I think it's high time we were all in bed,' Abraxas said after an extremely long period of silence; he took his hand off Lucius's neck and Draco swore he heard him mutter something awful about Narcissa under his breath as he walked past him and out into the hall. As soon as he was gone, Lucius's knees buckled, and Draco hurried over to the man before he collapsed, supporting him out of the drawing room and up the stairs as well as a twelve-year-old could. </p><p>'You're such a good boy,' Lucius blurted out unexpectedly, once they reached his bed, and before Draco could answer, the man had burst into tears. Startled, the young Slytherin awkwardly requested a handkerchief from Dobby and gently brushed away the tears that rolled down his father's ever reddening cheeks until Lucius had exhausted himself and laid his head down to sleep.  </p><p>With a soft sigh, Draco took a few moments to pull the covers over the sleeping man and kiss his temple before he glided back to his own room to look over his clothes for the funeral that was to commence the following day. But the room was so cold and the air so eerie and the furious pacing of his grandfather so loud that he became exhausted from his own emotions and threw himself into bed instead.</p><p>There was nothing for him to do. He could only take comfort in knowing that in a few days Abraxas would be leaving and his father, his poor father, wouldn't be hurt anymore. Lucius would sleep in tomorrow; then attend his late wife's funeral with his head held high after a quick spell to ward off a hangover. But he was mere pieces of the man he used to be. And Draco feared that one of these days he would end up dead, face down in puddle of his own vomit.</p><p>He didn't want his father to die. He didn't want to be looking after him for the rest of his life either. He just wanted things to go back to the way they were before.</p><p>He pulled the bed covers over his head and screamed. </p>
